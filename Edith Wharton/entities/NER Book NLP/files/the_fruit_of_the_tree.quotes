935	940	931	931	She	97	" seems to be , "

1351	1371	1398	1398	Amherst	96	" I am staying in Oak Street . But it 's just as short to go by Maplewood Avenue . "
1372	1378	1334	1334	he	96	" Yes ; and quieter . "
1411	1428	1408	1408	he	96	" I suppose you know nothing about the relation between Hope Hospital and the Westmore Mills . "
1429	1443	1408	1408	he	96	" Only that the hospital was endowed by one of the Westmore family . "
1444	1475	1476	1476	He	96	" Yes ; an old Miss Hope , a great - aunt of Westmore 's . But there is more than that between them -- all kinds of subterranean passages . "
1483	1498	1476	1476	He	96	" For instance , Dr. Disbrow married the sister of our manager 's wife . "
1499	1506	1408	1408	he	96	" Your chief at the mills ? "
1507	1510	1511	1511	he	96	" Yes , "
1518	1564	1511	1511	he	96	" So you see , if Truscomb -- the manager -- thinks one of the mill - hands is only slightly injured , it 's natural that his brother - in - law , Dr. Disbrow , should take an optimistic view of the case . "
1565	1572	1408	1408	he	96	" Natural ? I do n't know---- "
1573	1591	1408	1408	he	96	" Do n't you think it 's natural that a man should be influenced by his wife ? "
1592	1601	1602	1602	Amherst	96	" Not where his professional honour is concerned . "
1605	1672	1602	1602	Amherst	96	" That sounds very young -- if you 'll excuse my saying so . Well , I wo n't go on to insinuate that , Truscomb being high in favour with the Westmores , and the Westmores having a lien on the hospital , Disbrow 's position there is also bound up with his taking -- more or less -- the same view as Truscomb 's . "
1683	1701	1702	1702	she	97	" No , do n't go on -- if you want me to think well of you , "
1830	1838	1839	1839	he	96	" I began at the wrong end , "
1842	1855	1856	1856	She	97	" But let me put Dillon 's case before you dismiss me . "
1859	1875	1856	1856	She	97	" It is only because of my interest in that poor fellow that I am here---- "
1876	1891	1893	1893	she	97	" Because you think he needs help -- and that you can help him ? "
1899	1907	1908	1908	she	97	" Please tell me about him first , "
1922	1933	1914	1914	Amherst	96	" I wonder how much you know about factory life ? "
1934	1957	1958	1958	He	96	" Oh , next to nothing . Just what I 've managed to pick up in these two days at the hospital . "
1979	1987	1958	1958	He	96	" That might be a good deal . "
2000	2143	1996	1996	he	96	" Well , I wo n't try to put the general situation before you , though Dillon 's accident is really the result of it . He works in the carding room , and on the day of the accident his ' card ' stopped suddenly , and he put his hand behind him to get a tool he needed out of his trouser - pocket . He reached back a little too far , and the card behind him caught his hand in its million of diamond - pointed wires . Truscomb and the overseer of the room maintain that the accident was due to his own carelessness ; but the hands say that it was caused by the fact of the cards being too near together , and that just such an accident was bound to happen sooner or later . "
2151	2160	2144	2145	Miss Brent	97	" And what do _ you _ say ? "
2161	2253	1996	1996	he	96	" That they 're right : the carding - room is shamefully overcrowded . Dillon has n't been in it long -- he worked his way up at the mills from being a bobbin - boy -- and he had n't yet learned how cautious a man must be in there . The cards are so close to each other that even the old hands run narrow risks , and it takes the cleverest operative some time to learn that he must calculate every movement to a fraction of an inch . "
2254	2266	2429	2429	she	97	" But why do they crowd the rooms in that way ? "
2267	2301	2429	2429	she	97	" To get the maximum of profit out of the minimum of floor - space . It costs more to increase the floor - space than to maim an operative now and then . "
2302	2309	2310	2310	she	97	" I see . Go on , "
2313	2366	2310	2310	she	97	" That 's the first point ; here is the second . Dr. Disbrow told Truscomb this morning that Dillon 's hand would certainly be saved , and that he might get back to work in a couple of months if the company would present him with an artificial finger or two . "
2377	2392	2367	2368	Miss Brent	97	" Mr. Amherst -- who gave you this version of Dr. Disbrow 's report ? "
2393	2398	2429	2429	she	97	" The manager himself . "
2399	2402	2429	2429	she	97	" Verbally ? "
2403	2413	2367	2368	Miss Brent	97	" No -- he showed me Disbrow 's letter . "
2440	2457	2429	2429	she	97	" As I told you this afternoon , Dr. Disbrow has said nothing in my hearing . "
2458	2463	2429	2429	she	97	" And Mrs. Ogan ? "
2464	2469	2470	2470	Her	97	" Oh , Mrs. Ogan-- "
2479	2528	2470	2470	Her	97	" Mrs. Ogan ' feels it to be such a beautiful dispensation , my dear , that , owing to a death that very morning in the surgical ward , we happened to have a bed ready for the poor man within three hours of the accident . ' "
2604	2627	2628	2628	Amherst	96	" That three hours ' delay did n't help matters -- how is it there is no emergency hospital at the mills ? "
2638	2655	2656	2656	He	96	" That 's part of the larger question , which we have n't time for now . "
2665	2680	2656	2656	He	96	" You 've not yet given me your own impression of Dillon 's case . "
2681	2706	2707	2707	She	97	" You shall have it , if you saw that letter . Dillon will certainly lose his hand -- and probably the whole arm . "
2735	2745	2729	2729	Amherst	96	" Good God ! Never anything but useless lumber ? "
2746	2748	2713	2713	her	97	" Never---- "
2749	2756	2713	2713	her	97	" And he wo n't die ? "
2757	2760	2729	2729	Amherst	96	" Alas ! "
2761	2783	2784	2784	Amherst	96	" He has a consumptive wife and three children . She ruined her health swallowing cotton - dust at the factory , "
2787	2794	2784	2784	Amherst	96	" So she told me yesterday . "
2800	2809	2795	2795	He	96	" You 've had a talk with her ? "
2810	2847	2848	2849	Miss Brent	97	" I went out to Westmore last night . I was haunted by her face when she came to the hospital . She looks forty , but she told me she was only twenty - six . "
2856	2904	2905	2905	she	97	" It 's the curse of my trade that it 's always tempting me to interfere in cases where I can do no possible good . The fact is , I 'm not fit to be a nurse -- I shall live and die a wretched sentimentalist ! "
2936	2944	2933	2933	he	296	" What did you think of Westmore ? "
2945	2982	2983	2983	He	296	" I think it 's one of the worst places I ever saw -- and I am not unused to slums . It looks so dead . The slums of big cities are much more cheerful . "
2995	3006	2992	2992	she	97	" Does the cotton - dust always affect the lungs ? "
3007	3049	2933	2933	he	296	" It 's likely to , where there is the least phthisical tendency . But of course the harm could be immensely reduced by taking up the old rough floors which hold the dust , and by thorough cleanliness and ventilation . "
3050	3070	2933	2933	he	296	" What does the company do in such cases ? Where an operative breaks down at twenty - five ? "
3071	3081	2933	2933	he	296	" The company says there was a phthisical tendency . "
3082	3098	2933	2933	he	296	" And will they give nothing in return for the two lives they have taken ? "
3099	3123	2933	2933	he	296	" They will probably pay for Dillon 's care at the hospital , and they have taken the wife back as a scrubber . "
3124	3138	2933	2933	he	296	" To clean those uncleanable floors ? She 's not fit for it ! "
3139	3198	2933	2933	he	296	" She must work , fit for it or not ; and there is less strain in scrubbing than in bending over the looms or cards . The pay is lower , of course , but she 's very grateful for being taken back at all , now that she 's no longer a first - class worker . "
3209	3227	3199	3200	Miss Brent	97	" She ca n't possibly stand more than two or three months of it without breaking down ! "
3228	3251	2933	2933	he	296	" Well , you see they 've told her that in less than that time her husband will be at work again . "
3252	3275	3276	3276	Amherst	96	" And what will the company do for them when the wife is a hopeless invalid , and the husband a cripple ? "
3294	3332	3276	3276	Amherst	96	" I know what I should do if I could get anywhere near Dillon -- give him an overdose of morphine , and let the widow collect his life - insurance , and make a fresh start . "
3339	3346	3333	3333	She	97	" Should you , I wonder ? "
3347	3373	3374	3374	He	96	" If I saw the suffering as you see it , and knew the circumstances as I know them , I believe I should feel justified-- "
3378	3396	3397	3397	She	97	" In your work , do n't you ever feel tempted to set a poor devil free ? "
3400	3416	3397	3397	She	97	" One might ... but perhaps the professional instinct to save would always come first . "
3417	3432	3333	3333	She	97	" To save -- what ? When all the good of life is gone ? "
3433	3437	3438	3438	she	97	" I daresay , "
3441	3464	3438	3438	she	97	" poor Dillon would do it himself if he could -- when he realizes that all the good _ is _ gone . "
3465	3504	3333	3333	She	97	" Yes , but he ca n't do it himself ; and it 's the irony of such cases that his employers , after ruining his life , will do all they can to patch up the ruins . "
3505	3517	3333	3333	She	97	" But that at least ought to count in their favour . "
3518	3522	3523	3523	He	96	" Perhaps ; if-- "
3550	3564	3543	3543	she	97	" I did n't notice we had walked so far down Maplewood Avenue ! "
3648	3679	3639	3639	Amherst	96	" We _ have _ gone a block or two out of our way . I always forget where I am when I 'm talking about anything that interests me . "
3687	3710	3711	3711	she	97	" My friends do n't dine till seven , and I can get home in time by taking a Grove Street car , "
3714	3746	3711	3711	she	97	" If you do n't mind walking a little farther you can take a Liberty Street car instead . They run oftener , and you will get home just as soon . "
3762	3783	3759	3759	he	306	" I have n't yet explained why I am so anxious to get an unbiassed opinion of Dillon 's case . "
3791	3807	3784	3784	She	97	" What you 've told me about Dr. Disbrow and your manager is surely enough . "
3808	3877	3759	3759	he	306	" Well , hardly , considering that I am Truscomb 's subordinate . I should n't have committed a breach of professional etiquette , or asked you to do so , if I had n't a hope of bettering things ; but I have , and that is why I 've held on at Westmore for the last few months , instead of getting out of it altogether . "
3878	3885	3886	3886	she	97	" I 'm glad of that , "
3890	3905	3906	3906	he	306	" The owner of the mills -- young Richard Westmore -- died last winter , "
3910	3931	3906	3906	he	306	" and my hope -- it 's no more -- is that the new broom may sweep a little cleaner . "
3932	3939	3759	3759	he	306	" Who is the new broom ? "
3940	3965	3759	3759	he	306	" Westmore left everything to his widow , and she is coming here to - morrow to look into the management of the mills . "
3966	3977	3906	3906	he	306	" Coming ? She does n't live here , then ? "
3978	4020	3759	3759	he	306	" At Hanaford ? Heaven forbid ! It 's an anomaly nowadays for the employer to live near the employed . The Westmores have always lived in New York -- and I believe they have a big place on Long Island . "
4021	4057	3759	3759	he	306	" Well , at any rate she _ is _ coming , and that ought to be a good sign . Did she never show any interest in the mills during her husband 's life ? "
4058	4116	4117	4118	Miss Brent	97	" Not as far as I know . I 've been at Westmore three years , and she 's not been seen there in my time . She is very young , and Westmore himself did n't care . It was a case of inherited money . He drew the dividends , and Truscomb did the rest . "
4121	4161	4117	4118	Miss Brent	97	" I do n't know much about the constitution of companies -- but I suppose Mrs. Westmore does n't unite all the offices in her own person . Is there no one to stand between Truscomb and the operatives ? "
4162	4313	3759	3759	he	306	" Oh , the company , on paper , shows the usual official hierarchy . Richard Westmore , of course , was president , and since his death the former treasurer -- Halford Gaines -- has replaced him , and his son , Westmore Gaines , has been appointed treasurer . You can see by the names that it 's all in the family . Halford Gaines married a Miss Westmore , and represents the clan at Hanaford -- leads society , and keeps up the social credit of the name . As treasurer , Mr. Halford Gaines kept strictly to his special business , and always refused to interfere between Truscomb and the operatives . As president he will probably follow the same policy , the more so as it fits in with his inherited respect for the _ status quo _ , and his blissful ignorance of economics . "
4314	4336	3759	3759	he	306	" And the new treasurer -- young Gaines ? Is there no hope of his breaking away from the family tradition ? "
4337	4406	4117	4118	Miss Brent	97	" Westy Gaines has a better head than his father ; but he hates Hanaford and the mills , and his chief object in life is to be taken for a New Yorker . So far he has n't been here much , except for the quarterly meetings , and his routine work is done by another cousin -- you perceive that Westmore is a nest of nepotism . "
4429	4459	4423	4423	she	97	" Well , the outlook is not encouraging , but perhaps Mrs. Westmore 's coming will make a change . I suppose she has more power than any one . "
4460	4491	4117	4118	Miss Brent	97	" She might have , if she chose to exert it , for her husband was really the whole company . The official cousins hold only a few shares apiece . "
4492	4526	4117	4118	Miss Brent	97	" Perhaps , then , her visit will open her eyes . Who knows but poor Dillon 's case may help others -- prove a beautiful dispensation , as Mrs. Ogan would say ? "
4527	4571	4117	4118	Miss Brent	97	" It does come terribly pat as an illustration of some of the abuses I want to have remedied . The difficulty will be to get the lady 's ear . That 's her house we 're coming to , by the way . "

6310	6323	6324	6324	he	96	" I was trying to find out something about Dillon 's case , "
6346	6349	6344	6344	herself	396	" Well ? "
6350	6368	6327	6328	His mother	396	" I managed to have a talk with his nurse when she went off duty this evening . "
6369	6382	6344	6344	herself	396	" The nurse ? I wonder you could get her to speak . "
6383	6426	6327	6328	His mother	396	" Luckily she 's not the regular incumbent , but a volunteer who happened to be here on a visit . As it was , I had some difficulty in making her talk -- till I told her of Disbrow 's letter . "
6437	6445	6430	6430	her	117	" He 's very bad , then ? "
6446	6450	6451	6451	She	117	" Hopelessly maimed ! "
6459	6467	6451	6451	She	117	" Do you suppose she really knows ? "
6468	6478	6430	6430	her	117	" She struck me as quite competent to judge . "
6479	6496	6497	6497	He	397	" A volunteer , you say , here on a visit ? What is her name ? "
6506	6514	6499	6499	his	397	" I never thought of asking her . "
6519	6533	6515	6516	Mrs. Amherst	117	" How like you ! Did she say with whom she was staying ? "
6534	6551	6552	6553	Mrs. Amherst	117	" I think she said in Oak Street -- but she did n't mention any name . "
6559	6587	6552	6553	Mrs. Amherst	117	" I wonder if she 's not the thin dark girl I saw the other day with Mrs. Harry Dressel . Was she tall and rather handsome ? "
6588	6594	6596	6596	Amherst	96	" I do n't know , "
6668	6681	6683	6683	his	96	" How she can live close to such suffering and forget it ! "
6719	6752	6753	6753	His	96	" She takes her pity out in action , like that quiet nurse , who was as cool as a drum - major till she took off her uniform -- and then ! "
6831	6844	6815	6815	She	117	" John , have you considered what you mean to do next ? "
6855	6861	6862	6862	she	117	" About this Dillon case , "
6865	6876	6862	6862	she	117	" How are all these investigations going to help you ? "
6892	6904	6888	6888	he	96	" You are afraid I am going to lose my place . "
6913	6929	6905	6905	She	117	" It 's not the kind of place I ever wanted to see you in ! "
6930	6935	6936	6936	he	96	" I know it , "
6954	6992	6936	6936	he	96	" I ought to have followed a profession , like my grandfather ; but my father 's blood was too strong in me . I should never have been content as anything but a working - man . "
6993	7032	7033	7033	Amherst	96	" How can you call your father a working - man ? He had a genius for mechanics , and if he had lived he would have been as great in his way as any statesman or lawyer . "
7036	7091	7092	7092	He	96	" Greater , to my thinking ; but he gave me his hard - working hands without the genius to create with them . I wish I had inherited more from him , or less ; but I must make the best of what I am , rather than try to be somebody else . "
7101	7117	7092	7092	He	96	" It 's hard on you , mother -- but you must bear with me . "
7118	7147	7148	7148	He	96	" I have never complained , John ; but now you 've chosen your work , it 's natural that I should want you to stick to it . "
7155	7165	7148	7148	He	96	" Never fear ; I could easily get another job---- "
7166	7189	7092	7092	He	96	" What ? If Truscomb black - listed you ? Do you forget that Scotch overseer who was here when we came ? "
7190	7204	7206	7206	Amherst	96	" And whom Truscomb hounded out of the trade ? I remember him , "
7209	7225	7206	7206	Amherst	96	" but I have an idea I am going to do the hounding this time . "
7254	7259	7260	7260	he	96	" There 's Duplain , "
7293	7303	7260	7260	he	96	" Mr. Truscomb wants you to come down bimeby . "
7304	7312	7260	7260	he	96	" This evening ? To the office ? "
7313	7323	7260	7260	he	96	" No -- he 's sick a - bed . "
7345	7358	7359	7359	he	96	" Say I 'll come as soon as I 've had supper , "
7376	7407	7367	7367	Amherst	96	" Truscomb 's ill -- he has sent for me ; and I saw Mrs. Westmore arriving tonight ! Have supper , mother -- we wo n't wait for Duplain . "
7428	7435	7436	7437	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Oh , John , John ! "
7472	7489	7490	7490	she	119	" Mr. Truscomb 's very sick . He ought not to see you . The doctor thinks-- "
7533	7578	7579	7579	He	96	" Good evening , Mr. Amherst . Truscomb is pretty poorly -- on the edge of pneumonia , I 'm afraid . As he seems anxious to see you I think you 'd better go up for two minutes -- not more , please . "
7589	7601	7579	7579	He	96	" You wo n't excite him , of course -- nothing unpleasant---- "
7602	7613	7656	7657	Mrs. Truscomb	119	" He 's worried himself sick over that wretched Dillon , "
7627	7650	7651	7652	the physician	422	" That 's it -- puts too much heart into his work . But we 'll have Dillon all right before long , "
7832	7846	7856	7858	the young man	426	" Good evening , Amherst . I 'm down with a confounded cold . "
7847	7855	7856	7858	the young man	426	" I 'm sorry to hear it , "
7864	7876	7860	7860	himself	426	" Ca n't get my breath -- that 's the trouble . "
7882	7903	7860	7860	himself	426	" I 've just heard that Mrs. Westmore is here -- and I want you to go round -- tomorrow morning-- "
7912	7917	7919	7919	Amherst	96	" Yes , sir , "
7925	7970	7971	7971	He	426	" Need n't see her -- ask for her father , Mr. Langhope . Tell him what the doctor says -- I'll be on my legs in a day or two -- ask 'em to wait till I can take 'em over the mills . "
7989	8015	7971	7971	He	426	" Wait a minute . On your way there , stop and notify Mr. Gaines . He was to meet them here . You understand ? "
8016	8021	8023	8023	Amherst	96	" Yes , sir , "
8036	8048	8049	8049	she	119	" I must ask you to come now , Mr. Amherst , "
8067	8089	8057	8058	her husband	3393	" Hold on , Amherst . I hear you 've been in to Hanaford . Did you go to the hospital ? "
8090	8092	8093	8094	his wife	3350	" Ezra-- "
8102	8105	8107	8107	Amherst	96	" Yes , "
8130	8168	8119	8119	He	3393	" All right . You 'll just bear in mind that it 's Disbrow 's business to report Dillon 's case to Mrs. Westmore ? You 're to confine yourself to my message . Is that clear ? "
8169	8175	8176	8176	Amherst	96	" Perfectly clear . Goodnight , "
8257	8269	8270	8270	she	444	" Did n't I tell you it was awful , father ? "
8331	8336	8337	8337	he	120	" As an archaeologist , "
8348	8365	8337	8337	he	120	" I find it positively interesting . I should really like to come here and dig . "
8412	8416	8418	8419	Mr. Langhope	120	" All this , "
8421	8448	8418	8419	Mr. Langhope	120	" is getting to be as rare as the giant sequoias . In another fifty years we shall have collectors fighting for that Bay of Naples . "
8470	8479	8480	8480	she	122	" _ You _ can see , Maria , "
8493	8502	8480	8480	she	122	" why I could n't possibly live here . "
8660	8666	8667	8667	she	178	" It needs doing over , "
8680	8713	8667	8667	she	178	" But you are a spoilt child to complain . Think of having a house of your own to come to , instead of having to put up at the Hanaford hotel ! "
8728	8757	8758	8758	she	178	" Doing over ? Why in the world should I do it over ? No one could expect me to come here _ now_--could they , Mr. Tredegar ? "
8848	8853	8854	8854	he	125	" It all depends , "
8858	8866	8854	8854	he	125	" how large an income you require . "
8922	8937	8938	8940	the older lady	466	" Ah , that 's it , Bessy . You 've that to remember , "
8960	8973	8953	8954	Mrs. Westmore	104	" We 've always had money enough -- Dick was perfectly satisfied . "
8985	9007	8974	8974	Her	466	" And you do n't know what the place is like by daylight -- and the people who come to call ! "
9008	9021	9022	9023	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Of course you need n't see any one now , dear , "
9027	9033	9022	9023	Mrs. Ansell	178	" except the Halford Gaineses . "
9034	9088	9022	9023	Mrs. Ansell	178	" I am sure they 're bad enough . Juliana Gaines will say : ' My dear , is that the way widows ' veils are worn in New York this autumn ? ' and Halford will insist on our going to one of those awful family dinners , all Madeira and terrapin . "
9089	9097	9098	9099	Mrs. Ansell	178	" It 's too early for terrapin , "
9111	9130	9131	9131	she	178	" Besides , what difference would my coming here make ? I shall never understand anything about business , "
9145	9166	9142	9142	his	125	" The necessity has never arisen . But now that you find yourself in almost sole control of a large property---- "
9172	9189	9167	9168	Mr. Langhope	120	" Apply yourself , Bessy . Bring your masterly intellect to bear on the industrial problem . "
9216	9232	9211	9212	Mrs. Westmore	104	" Do n't tease her . She 's tired , and she misses the baby . "
9233	9242	9244	9246	the young mother	468	" I shall get a telegram tomorrow morning , "
9250	9277	9278	9278	She	178	" Of course you will . ' Cicely has just eaten two boiled eggs and a bowl of porridge , and is bearing up wonderfully . ' "
9299	9311	9312	9312	she	178	" You all think I 'm extravagant and careless about money , "
9330	9367	9312	9312	she	178	" but I know one thing : If I had my way I should begin to economize by selling this horrible house , instead of leaving it shut up from one year 's end to another . "
9392	9404	9410	9410	his	472	" What do you think of that , eh , Tredegar ? "
9414	9429	9430	9430	he	472	" From the point of view of policy , I think unfavourably of it , "
9444	9475	9439	9440	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Really , it 's too late to look so far into the future . Remember , my dear , that we are due at the mills tomorrow at ten . "
9519	9551	9511	9512	Mr. Langhope	120	" Bessy 's as hopelessly vague about business as I am , Tredegar . Why the deuce Westmore left her everything outright -- but he was only a heedless boy himself . "
9552	9581	9680	9681	Mr. Langhope	120	" Yes . The way he allowed things to go , it 's a wonder there was anything to leave . This Truscomb must be an able fellow . "
9582	9594	9511	9512	Mr. Langhope	120	" Devoted to Dick 's interests , I 've always understood . "
9595	9669	9511	9512	Mr. Langhope	120	" He makes the mills pay well , at any rate , and that 's not so easy nowadays . But on general principles it 's as well he should see that we mean to look into everything thoroughly . Of course Halford Gaines will never be more than a good figure - head , but Truscomb must be made to understand that Mrs. Westmore intends to interest herself personally in the business . "
9670	9679	9680	9681	Mr. Langhope	120	" Oh , by all means -- of course-- "
9708	9744	9696	9696	He	120	" I think I 'll turn in myself . There 's not a readable book in that God - forsaken library , and I believe Maria Ansell has gone off with my volume of Loti . "
9966	9977	9978	9978	he	96	" I do n't suppose that cost Truscomb ten dollars , "
10034	10053	10054	10054	he	96	" And what prompted the lie about her husband ? Well , perhaps he 's an incurable optimist , "
10134	10151	10152	10152	she	396	" You 'd really be handsome , Johnny , if you were only a little vainer , "
10172	10185	10186	10186	she	396	" I never heard that vanity made a man better - looking , "
10190	10214	10215	10215	she	396	" Oh , up to a certain point , because it teaches him how to use what he 's got . So remember , "
10228	10251	10215	10215	she	396	" that you 're going to see a pretty young woman , and that you 're not a hundred years old yourself . "
10252	10258	10259	10259	he	96	" I 'll try to , "
10265	10286	10259	10259	he	96	" but as I 've been forbidden to ask for her , I am afraid your efforts will be wasted . "
10591	10595	10596	10596	he	96	" Mrs. Westmore ? "
10637	10683	10625	10625	she	396	" I am Mrs. Westmore . But if you have come to see me , I ought to tell you that in a moment I shall be obliged to go out to our mills . I have a business appointment with our manager , but if---- "
10697	10714	10715	10715	he	96	" I have come from the manager ; I am John Amherst -- your assistant manager , "
10788	10812	10813	10814	his employer	500	" How stupid of me ! I took you for -- I had no idea ; I did n't expect Mr. Truscomb here , "
10827	10872	10873	10873	Amherst	96	" Mr. Truscomb sent me to tell you that he is ill , and will not be able to show you the mills today . I did n't mean to ask for you -- I was told to give the message to Mr. Langhope , "
11050	11059	11060	11060	she	104	" Ah , here is my father now , "
11124	11134	11135	11135	her	104	" If _ father _ thinks you 're a gentleman---- "
11146	11160	11143	11143	she	104	" This is Mr. Amherst , father : Mr. Truscomb has sent him . "
11161	11165	11166	11166	Langhope	120	" Mr. Amherst ? "
11242	11265	11234	11234	her	178	" Your name is unusual . I had a friend named Lucy Warne who married a very clever man -- a mechanical genius---- "
11271	11287	11288	11288	he	96	" My father _ was _ a genius ; and my mother is Lucy Warne , "
11301	11320	11321	11321	she	178	" What a delightful coincidence ! We were girls together at Albany . You must remember Judge Warne ? "
11343	11355	11321	11321	she	178	" Of course -- of course -- delightful -- most interesting . "
11420	11432	11433	11433	he	96	" Poverty is the only thing that makes people old nowadays , "
11457	11474	11475	11475	he	96	" I must go and see her -- you must let me take her by surprise , "
11479	11493	11475	11475	he	96	" We live out at the mills , a long way from here . "
11494	11504	11505	11505	she	178	" Oh , we 're going there this morning , "
11525	11549	11521	11522	Mrs. Westmore	104	" But , Maria , Mr. Truscomb is ill , and has sent Mr. Amherst to say that we are not to come . "
11550	11564	11565	11566	Mr. Langhope	120	" Yes : so Gaines has just telephoned . It 's most unfortunate , "
11626	11646	11647	11647	she	178	" But how ill is Mr. Truscomb ? Do you think he can take us over the mills tomorrow ? "
11652	11672	11647	11647	she	178	" I 'm afraid not ; I am sure he ca n't . He has a touch of bronchitis . "
11703	11707	11694	11695	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Poor man ! "
11729	11751	11725	11726	Mrs. Westmore	104	" If it 's bronchitis he may be ill for days , and what in the world are we to do ? "
11752	11760	11762	11763	Mr. Langhope	120	" Pack up and come back later , "
11770	11777	11768	11768	Bessy	125	" Oh , that dreadful journey ! "
11784	11803	11778	11779	Mr. Tredegar	125	" One moment , Langhope , please . Mr. Amherst , is Mrs. Westmore expected at the mills ? "
11804	11815	11725	11726	Mrs. Westmore	104	" Yes , I believe they know she is coming . "
11816	11849	11778	11779	Mr. Tredegar	125	" Then I think , my dear , that to go back to New York without showing yourself would , under the circumstances , be -- er -- an error in judgment . "
11850	11870	11871	11872	her father	3496	" Good Lord , Tredegar , you do n't expect to keep us kicking our heels here for days ? "
11875	11895	11897	11898	the lawyer	520	" I can certainly not afford to employ mine in that manner for even a fraction of a day , "
11913	11916	11897	11898	the lawyer	520	" but meanwhile---- "
11917	11920	11921	11921	Bessy	125	" Father , "
11930	11958	11921	11921	Bessy	125	" do n't you see that the only thing for us to do is to go over the mills now -- at once -- with Mr. Amherst ? "
11984	12034	12051	12051	his	120	" Eh -- what ? Now -- at once ? But Gaines was to have gone with us , and how on earth are we to get at him ? He telephoned me that , as the visit was given up , he should ride out to his farm . "
12035	12050	12051	12052	his daughter	514	" Oh , never mind -- or , at least , all the better ! "
12055	12077	12051	12052	his daughter	514	" We can see the mills just as well without him ; and we shall get on so much more quickly . "
12078	12090	12092	12093	Mr. Langhope	120	" Well -- well -- what do you say , Tredegar ? "
12112	12133	12102	12102	Bessy	125	" And I shall understand so much better without a lot of people trying to explain to me at once ! "
12174	12185	12186	12186	she	178	" Mrs. Westmore has left her little girl at home , "
13050	13059	13047	13047	she	104	" What a good day for a gallop ! "
13118	13128	13108	13108	Bessy	125	" You like riding too , I 'm sure ? "
13129	13152	13153	13153	he	96	" I used to ; but I have n't been in the saddle for years . Factory managers do n't keep hunters , "
13186	13225	13183	13183	he	96	" If I regretted anything in my other life , it would certainly be a gallop on a day like this ; but I chose my trade deliberately , and I 've never been sorry for my choice . "
13264	13308	13309	13309	she	104	" You find the work interesting ? I 'm sure it must be . You 'll think me very ignorant -- my husband and I came here so seldom ... I feel as if I ought to know so much more about it , "
13324	13343	13344	13344	he	96	" Wo n't you try to -- now you 're here ? There 's so much worth knowing , "
13360	13378	13379	13379	she	104	" I 'm very stupid -- I've no head for business -- but I will try to , "
13382	13448	13379	13379	she	104	" It 's not business that I mean ; it 's the personal relation -- just the thing the business point of view leaves out . Financially , I do n't suppose your mills could be better run ; but there are over seven hundred women working in them , and there 's so much to be done , just for them and their children . "
13460	13470	13457	13457	her	104	" I have always understood that Mr. Truscomb did everything---- "
13484	13501	13502	13502	he	96	" Do you leave it to your little girl 's nurses to do everything for her ? "
13533	13540	13541	13541	she	104	" Really , I do n't see-- "
13565	13595	13596	13596	Amherst	96	" I am glad you told me that , Mr. Amherst . Of course I want to do whatever I can . I should like you to point out everything---- "

I do n't mean business questions : wages and dividends and so on -- those are out of my province . I speak merely in the line of my own work -- my care of the hands , and what I believe they need and do n't get under the present system . Naturally , if Mr. Truscomb were well , I should n't have had this chance of putting the case to you ; but since it 's come my way , I must seize it and take the consequences . "

18687	18717	18718	18718	Amherst	99	" Well , her face was kinder white and small , with an awful lot of black hair fitting close to it . Said she came from Hope Hospital . "

I 'm glad to say I have been able to bring Mrs. Westmore an excellent report of both patients -- Mr. Truscomb , I mean , and poor Dillon . This mild weather is all in their favour , and I hope my brother - in - law will be about in a day or two . "
19168	19183	19150	19151	Mr. Tredegar	125	" I understood from Mrs. Westmore that she wished to see me this evening . "
19214	19226	19227	19228	Mr. Tredegar	125	" Quite so : I believe she asked you to come , "
19342	19349	19350	19350	he	96	" Perhaps I have come too early-- "
19361	19409	19354	19355	Mr. Tredegar	125	" No , I believe you are exactly on time ; but Mrs. Westmore is unexpectedly detained . The fact is , Mr. and Mrs. Halford Gaines are dining with her , and she has delegated to me the duty of hearing what you have to say . "
19419	19427	19413	19413	His	96	" There is no duty about it ! "
19509	19519	19506	19506	he	96	" Could I not speak with Mrs. Westmore later ? "
19545	19555	19556	19556	he	96	" Mrs. Westmore has asked me to replace her , "
19566	19577	19578	19578	Amherst	96	" Then I am not to see her at all ? "
19587	19598	19582	19583	the lawyer	520	" I am afraid not , as she leaves tomorrow . "
19685	19710	19711	19711	He	96	" You are perhaps not aware that I am Mrs. Westmore 's lawyer , and one of the executors under her husband 's will . "
19758	19767	19768	19768	he	96	" With that stuffed canary to advise her , "
19771	19784	19768	19768	he	96	" there 's no hope for her unless I can assert myself now "
19933	19937	19938	19938	he	96	" Mrs. Westmore , "
19941	19958	19938	19938	he	96	" asked me to let her know something about the condition of the people at the mills---- "
19965	19969	19970	19970	he	125	" Excuse me , "
19973	20003	19970	19970	he	125	" I understood from Mrs. Westmore that it was you who asked her permission to call this evening and set forth certain grievances on the part of the operatives . "
20007	20036	20004	20004	Amherst	96	" I did ask her -- yes . But I do n't in any sense represent the operatives . I simply wanted to say a word for them . "
20079	20088	20089	20089	he	125	" Does Mr. Truscomb know of your intention ? "
20093	20098	20089	20089	he	125	" No , sir , "
20116	20134	20135	20135	he	125	" I am here on my own responsibility -- and in direct opposition to my own interests , "
20142	20207	20135	20135	he	125	" I know that my proceeding is quite out of order , and that I have , personally , everything to lose by it , and in a larger way probably very little to gain ; but I thought Mrs. Westmore 's attention ought to be called to certain conditions at the mills , and no one else seemed likely to speak of them . "
20208	20228	20229	20229	Amherst	96	" May I ask why you assume that Mr. Truscomb will not do so when he has the opportunity ? "
20236	20248	20135	20135	he	125	" Because it is owing to Mr. Truscomb that they exist . "
20249	20258	20260	20261	Mr. Tredegar	125	" The real object of your visit then , "
20267	20281	20260	20261	Mr. Tredegar	125	" is -- er -- an underhand attack on your manager 's methods ? "
20293	20302	20288	20288	he	96	" I see nothing especially underhand in my course---- "
20303	20306	20307	20308	the other	736	" Except , "
20312	20331	20307	20308	the other	736	" that you have waited to speak till Mr. Truscomb was not in a position to defend himself . "
20332	20380	20381	20382	Mr. Tredegar	125	" I never had the chance before . It was at Mrs. Westmore 's own suggestion that I took her over the mills , and feeling as I do I should have thought it cowardly to shirk the chance of pointing out to her the conditions there . "
20461	20469	20450	20450	his	96	" To what conditions do you refer ? "
20470	20502	20450	20450	his	96	" To the conditions under which the mill - hands work and live -- to the whole management of the mills , in fact , in relation to the people employed . "
20503	20514	20515	20516	Mr. Tredegar	125	" That is a large question . Pardon my possible ignorance-- "
20530	20548	20515	20516	Mr. Tredegar	125	this--"but surely in this state there are liability and inspection laws for the protection of the operatives ? "
20549	20581	20515	20516	Mr. Tredegar	125	" There are such laws , yes -- but most of them are either a dead letter , or else so easily evaded that no employer thinks of conforming to them . "
20582	20606	20515	20516	Mr. Tredegar	125	" No employer ? Then your specific charge against the Westmore mills is part of a general arraignment of all employers of labour ? "
20607	20647	20515	20516	Mr. Tredegar	125	" By no means , sir . I only meant that , where the hands are well treated , it is due rather to the personal good - will of the employer than to any fear of the law . "
20648	20662	20663	20663	Amherst	96	" And in what respect do you think the Westmore hands unfairly treated ? "
20670	20683	20684	20684	he	96	" The question , as you say , is a large one , "
20687	20773	20684	20684	he	96	" It has its roots in the way the business is organized -- in the traditional attitude of the company toward the operatives . I hoped that Mrs. Westmore might return to the mills -- might visit some of the people in their houses . Seeing their way of living , it might have occurred to her to ask a reason for it -- and one enquiry would have led to another . She spoke this morning of going to the hospital to see Dillon . "
20774	20831	20832	20832	Amherst	96	" She did go to the hospital : I went with her . But as Dillon was sleeping , and as the matron told us he was much better -- a piece of news which , I am happy to say , Dr. Disbrow has just confirmed -- she did not go up to the ward . "
20841	20901	20902	20902	He	96	" I gather , from your bringing up Dillon 's case , that for some reason you consider it typical of the defects you find in Mr. Truscomb 's management . Suppose , therefore , we drop generalizations , and confine ourselves to the particular instance . What wrong , in your view , has been done the Dillons ? "
20920	20936	20937	20937	he	96	" Let me offer you one , Mr. Amherst : we shall talk more comfortably , "
21096	21109	21074	21074	he	125	" Have you ever called Mr. Gaines 's attention to these matters ? "
21110	21137	21187	21188	Mr. Tredegar	125	" No : that would have been useless . He has always refused to discuss the condition of the mills with any one but the manager . "
21138	21175	21176	21176	Amherst	96	" H'm -- that would seem to prove that Mr. Gaines , who lives here , sees as much reason for trusting Truscomb 's judgment as Mr. Westmore , who delegated his authority from a distance . "
21192	21341	21187	21188	Mr. Tredegar	125	" You know , of course , the answers I might make to such an indictment . As a lawyer , I might call your attention to the employe 's waiver of risk , to the strong chances of contributory negligence , and so on ; but happily in this case such arguments are superfluous . You are apparently not aware that Dillon 's injury is much slighter than it ought to be to serve your purpose . Dr. Disbrow has just told us that he will probably get off with the loss of a finger ; and I need hardly say that , whatever may have been Dillon 's own share in causing the accident -- and as to this , as you admit , opinions differ -- Mrs. Westmore will assume all the expenses of his nursing , besides making a liberal gift to his wife . "
21359	21365	21366	21366	he	125	" Here , in fact , "
21369	21415	21366	21366	he	125	" is a cheque which she asks you to transmit , and which , as I think you will agree , ought to silence , on your part as well as Mrs. Dillon 's , any criticism of Mrs. Westmore 's dealings with her operatives . "
21445	21473	21474	21474	he	125	" There is no question of criticizing Mrs. Westmore 's dealings with her operatives -- as far as I know , she has had none as yet , "
21488	21577	21474	21474	he	125	" And the proof of it is the impunity with which her agents deceive her -- in this case , for instance , of Dillon 's injury . Dr. Disbrow , who is Mr. Truscomb 's brother - in - law , and apt to be influenced by his views , assures you that the man will get off with the loss of a finger ; but some one equally competent to speak told me last night that he would lose not only his hand but his arm . "
21620	21637	21638	21638	Amherst	96	" Some one equally competent to speak ? Are you prepared to name this anonymous authority ? "
21641	21657	21658	21658	he	125	" No -- I shall have to ask you to take my word for it , "
21666	21668	21658	21658	he	125	" Ah-- "
21696	21706	21685	21685	Amherst	96	" It is all you have required of Dr. Disbrow-- "
21718	21770	21711	21712	Mr. Tredegar	125	" My dear sir , your resorting to such arguments convinces me that nothing is to be gained by prolonging our talk . I will not even take up your insinuations against two of the most respected men in the community -- such charges reflect only on those who make them . "
21805	21883	21793	21794	the lawyer	520	" My only specific charge from Mrs. Westmore was to hand you this cheque ; but , in spite of what has passed , I take it upon myself to add , in her behalf , that your conduct of today will not be allowed to weigh against your record at the mills , and that the extraordinary charges you have seen fit to bring against your superiors will -- if not repeated -- simply be ignored . "
21937	21953	21922	21922	she	178	" No -- I shall have to ask you to take my word for it . "
22149	22155	22156	22156	she	178	" I suppose you know , "
22160	22178	22156	22156	she	178	" that Bessy has telegraphed for Cicely , and made her arrangements to stay here another week . "
22225	22229	22230	22231	Mr. Langhope	120	" My dear Maria-- "
22242	22257	22258	22259	the lawyer	520	" She considers it , then , her duty to wait and see Truscomb ? "
22273	22281	22263	22264	Mrs. Ansell	178	" She puts it so -- yes . "
22282	22286	22287	22288	Mr. Langhope	120	" My dear Maria-- "
22305	22326	22287	22288	Mr. Langhope	120	" But it would be perfectly easy to return : it is quite unnecessary to wait here for his recovery , "
22365	22374	22360	22361	Mrs. Ansell	178	" She says she detests the long journey . "
22389	22412	22413	22413	he	125	" In that case -- if I had been notified earlier of this decision , I might have caught the morning train , "
22423	22433	22413	22413	he	125	" Oh , do n't leave us , Tredegar , "
22438	22457	22434	22435	Mr. Langhope	120	" We 'll reason with her -- we'll persuade her to go back by the three - forty . "
22462	22478	22458	22459	Mrs. Ansell	178	" She telegraphed at seven . Cicely and the governess are already on their way . "
22479	22498	22542	22542	she	178	" At seven ? But , my dear friend , why on earth did n't you tell us ? "
22499	22520	22458	22459	Mrs. Ansell	178	" I did n't know till a few minutes ago . Bessy called me in as I was coming down . "
22521	22523	22524	22525	Mr. Langhope	120	" Ah-- "
22568	22606	22562	22562	he	120	" My dear Tredegar , if we 're in a box there 's no reason why we should force you into it too . Ring for Ropes , and we 'll look up a train for you . "
22621	22668	22669	22669	he	120	" Of course , if I had been notified in advance , I might have arranged to postpone my engagements another day ; but in any case , it is quite out of the question that I should return in a week -- and quite unnecessary , "
22685	22692	22669	22669	he	120	" Oh , quite -- quite , "
22697	22766	22767	22767	he	120	" It is n't , in fact , in the least necessary for any of us either to stay on now or to return . Truscomb could come to Long Island when he recovers , and answer any questions we may have to put ; but if Bessy has sent for the child , we must of course put off going for today -- at least I must , "
22771	22809	22767	22767	he	120	" and , though I know it 's out of the question to exact such a sacrifice from you , I have a faint hope that our delightful friend here , with the altruistic spirit of her sex---- "
22810	22823	22824	22825	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Oh , I shall enjoy it -- my maid is unpacking , "
22840	22853	22834	22834	his	125	" In that case I will ring for the time - table . "
22907	22916	22917	22917	he	120	" Now what on earth does this mean ? "
22948	22960	22961	22961	she	178	" A number of things -- or any one of them , "
22975	22979	22980	22980	he	120	" For instance-- ? "
23002	23037	22993	22993	She	178	" For instance : it may mean -- don't resent the suggestion -- that you and Mr. Tredegar were not quite well - advised in persuading her not to see Mr. Amherst yesterday evening . "
23046	23113	23114	23114	he	120	" But , my dear Maria -- in the name of reason ... why , after the doctor 's visit -- after his coming here last night , at Truscomb 's request , to put the actual facts before her -- should she have gone over the whole business again with this interfering young fellow ? How , in fact , could she have done so , "
23124	23149	23114	23114	he	120	" without putting a sort of slight on Truscomb , who is , after all , the only person entitled to speak with authority ? "
23194	23213	23191	23191	she	178	" Judged by reason , your arguments are unanswerable ; but when it comes to a question of feeling---- "
23214	23235	23236	23236	She	178	" Feeling ? What kind of feeling ? You do n't mean to suggest anything so preposterous as that Bessy---- ? "
23244	23308	23191	23191	she	178	" I confess it is to be regretted that his mother is a lady , and that he looks -- you must have noticed it?--so amazingly like the portraits of the young Schiller . But I only meant that Bessy forms all her opinions emotionally ; and that she must have been very strongly affected by the scene Mr. Tredegar described to us . "
23309	23312	23313	23314	Mr. Langhope	120	" Ah , "
23323	23341	23313	23314	Mr. Langhope	120	" how a woman of your good sense stumbled on that idea of hunting up the mother-- ! "
23352	23376	23343	23344	Mrs. Ansell	178	" My dear Henry , if you could see the house they live in you 'd think I had been providentially guided there ! "
23390	23464	23385	23385	he	120	" But why , after hearing the true version of the facts , should Bessy still be influenced by that sensational scene ? Even if it was not , as Tredegar suspects , cooked up expressly to take her in , she must see that the hospital doctor is , after all , as likely as any one to know how the accident really happened , and how seriously the fellow is hurt . "
23465	23482	23313	23314	Mr. Langhope	120	" There 's the point . Why should Bessy believe Dr. Disbrow rather than Mr. Amherst ? "
23483	23529	23530	23531	Mrs. Ansell	178	" For the best of reasons -- because Disbrow has nothing to gain by distorting the facts , whereas this young Amherst , as Tredegar pointed out , has the very obvious desire to give Truscomb a bad name and shove himself into his place . "
23540	23603	23530	23531	Mrs. Ansell	178	" From what I saw of Amherst I 'm inclined to think that , if that is his object , he is too clever to have shown his hand so soon . But if you are right , was there not all the more reason for letting Bessy see him and find out as soon as possible what he was aiming at ? "
23604	23632	23530	23531	Mrs. Ansell	178	" If one could have trusted her to find out -- but you credit my poor child with more penetration than I 've ever seen in her . "
23633	23659	23530	23531	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Perhaps you 've looked for it at the wrong time -- and about the wrong things . Bessy has the penetration of the heart . "
23660	23674	23530	23531	Mrs. Ansell	178	" The heart ! You make mine jump when you use such expressions . "
23675	23703	23530	23531	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Oh , I use this one in a general sense . But I want to help you to keep it from acquiring a more restricted significance . "
23704	23713	23714	23715	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Restricted -- to the young man himself ? "
23727	23747	23714	23715	Mrs. Ansell	178	" All I ask you to consider for the present is that Bessy is quite unoccupied and excessively bored . "
23748	23762	23714	23715	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Bored ? Why , she has everything on earth she can want ! "
23763	23798	23714	23715	Mrs. Ansell	178	" The ideal state for producing boredom -- the only atmosphere in which it really thrives . And besides -- to be humanly inconsistent -- there 's just one thing she has n't got . "
23799	23802	23714	23715	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Well ? "
23814	23831	23808	23808	himself	120	" An occupation for that rudimentary little organ , the mention of which makes you jump . "
23832	23854	23714	23715	Mrs. Ansell	178	" There you go again ! Good heavens , Maria , do you want to encourage her to fall in love ? "
23855	23907	23908	23909	Mr. Langhope	120	" Not with a man , just at present , but with a hobby , an interest , by all means . If she does n't , the man will take the place of the interest -- there 's a vacuum to be filled , and human nature abhors a vacuum . "
23914	23926	23911	23911	his	120	" I do n't follow you . She adored her husband . "
23947	23966	23967	23967	he	120	" Oh , I do n't say it was a great passion -- but they got on perfectly , "
23971	24026	23969	23969	himself	120	" So perfectly that you must expect her to want a little storm and stress for a change . The mere fact that you and Mr. Tredegar objected to her seeing Mr. Amherst last night has roused the spirit of opposition in her . A year ago she had n't any spirit of opposition . "
24027	24045	23911	23911	his	120	" There was nothing for her to oppose -- poor Dick made her life so preposterously easy . "
24046	24095	23911	23911	his	120	" My ingenuous friend ! Do you still think that 's any reason ? The fact is , Bessy was n't awake , she was n't even born , then .... She is now , and you know the infant 's first conscious joy is to smash things . "
24096	24114	23969	23969	himself	120	" It will be rather an expensive joy if the mills are the first thing she smashes . "
24115	24131	24132	24133	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Oh I imagine the mills are pretty substantial . I should , I own , "
24136	24148	24132	24133	Mrs. Ansell	178	" not object to seeing her try her teeth on them . "
24149	24160	23969	23969	himself	120	" Which , in terms of practical conduct , means---- ? "
24161	24211	24132	24133	Mrs. Ansell	178	" That I advise you not to disapprove of her staying on , or of her investigating the young man 's charges . You must remember that another peculiarity of the infant mind is to tire soonest of the toy that no one tries to take away from it . "
24212	24247	24132	24133	Mrs. Ansell	178	" _ Que diable ! _ But suppose Truscomb turns rusty at this very unusual form of procedure ? Perhaps you do n't quite know how completely he represents the prosperity of the mills . "
24248	24254	24255	24256	Mrs. Ansell	178	" All the more reason , "
24269	24313	24264	24265	Mr. Tredegar	125	" For do n't you perceive , my poor distracted friend , that if Truscomb turns rusty , as he undoubtedly will , the inevitable result will be his manager 's dismissal -- and that thereafter there will presumably be peace in Warsaw ? "
24314	24322	24324	24325	Mr. Langhope	120	" Ah , you divinely wicked woman ! "
25488	25507	25470	25470	she	396	" What a face , John ! Of course I do n't often see people of that kind now-- "
25528	25604	25470	25470	she	396	more--"but I 'm sure that kind of soft loveliness is rare everywhere ; like a sweet summer morning with the mist on it . The Gaines girls , now , are my idea of the modern type ; very handsome , of course , but you see just _ how _ handsome the first minute . I like a story that keeps one wondering till the end . It was very kind of Maria Ansell , "
25611	25660	25605	25606	Mrs. Amherst	117	" to come and hunt me out yesterday , and I enjoyed our quiet talk about old times . But what I liked best was seeing Mrs. Westmore -- and , oh , John , if she came to live here , what a benediction to the mills ! "
25709	25719	25720	25720	he	96	" I shall never be as genuine as that , "
26395	26401	26389	26389	his	96	" A lady asking for you-- "
26561	26571	26572	26572	she	122	" I have come back to talk to you , "
26587	26644	26572	26572	she	122	" I knew that , in Mr. Truscomb 's absence , it would be hard for you to leave the mills , and there are one or two things I want you to explain before I go away -- some of the things , for instance , that you spoke to Mr. Tredegar about last night . "
26652	26666	26667	26667	he	96	" I 'm afraid I expressed myself badly ; I may have annoyed him-- "
26683	26705	26706	26706	She	122	" Perhaps you do n't quite understand each other -- but I am sure you can make it clear to me . "
26729	26739	26740	26740	she	122	" That is the reason why I came alone , "
26743	26807	26740	26740	she	122	" I never can understand when a lot of people are trying to tell me a thing all at once . And I do n't suppose I care as much as a man would -- a lawyer especially -- about the forms that ought to be observed . All I want is to find out what is wrong and how to remedy it . "
26919	26937	26938	26938	he	96	" It will make a great difference to the people here if you interest yourself in them , "
26941	27028	27029	27029	She	122	" I tried to explain to Mr. Tredegar that I had no wish to criticise the business management of the mills -- even if there had been any excuse for my doing so -- but that I was sure the condition of the operatives could be very much improved , without permanent harm to the business , by any one who felt a personal sympathy for them ; and in the end I believe such sympathy produces better work , and so benefits the employer materially . "
27086	27099	27100	27100	she	122	" That is just what I want you to explain to me , "
27103	27235	27100	27100	she	122	" But first I should like to know more about the poor man who was hurt . I meant to see his wife yesterday , but Mr. Gaines told me she would be at work till six , and it would have been difficult to go after that . I _ did _ go to the hospital ; but the man was sleeping -- is Dillon his name?--and the matron told us he was much better . Dr. Disbrow came in the evening and said the same thing -- told us it was all a false report about his having been so badly hurt , and that Mr. Truscomb was very much annoyed when he heard of your having said , before the operatives , that Dillon would lose his arm . "
27239	27292	27236	27236	Amherst	96	" Ah -- Mr. Truscomb heard that ? Well , he 's right to be annoyed : I ought not to have said it when I did . But unfortunately I am not the only one to be punished . The operative who tied on the black cloth was dismissed this morning . "
27298	27311	27293	27294	Mrs. Westmore	104	" Dismissed for that ? Oh , how unjust -- how cruel ! "
27312	27323	27325	27325	Amherst	96	" You must look at both sides of the case , "
27354	27375	27325	27325	Amherst	96	" Of course any act of insubordination must be reprimanded -- but I think a reprimand would have been enough . "
27397	27430	27433	27433	Amherst	96	" But he shall be put back -- I wo n't have any one discharged for such a reason ! You must find him for me at once -- you must tell him---- "
27438	27519	27433	27433	Amherst	96	" If you 'll forgive my saying so , I think it is better to let him go , and take his chance of getting work elsewhere . If he were taken back he might be made to suffer . As things are organized here , the hands are very much at the mercy of the overseers , and the overseer in that room would be likely to make it uncomfortable for a hand who had so openly defied him . "
27532	27564	27524	27524	she	104	" How complicated it is ! I wonder if I shall ever understand it all . _ You _ do n't think Dillon 's accident was his own fault , then ? "
27565	27644	27645	27645	She	104	" Certainly not ; there are too many cards in that room . I pointed out the fact to Mr. Truscomb when the new machines were set up three years ago . An operative may be ever so expert with his fingers , and yet not learn to measure his ordinary movements quite as accurately as if he were an automaton ; and that is what a man must do to be safe in the carding - room . "
27649	27674	27645	27645	She	104	" The more you tell me , the more difficult it all seems . Why is the carding - room so over - crowded ? "
27675	27682	27683	27683	Amherst	96	" To make it pay better , "
27717	27742	27710	27710	she	104	" What you say is dreadful . Each thing seems to lead back to another -- and I feel so ignorant of it all . "
27758	27805	27752	27752	her	104	" I am going to be quite frank with you , Mr. Amherst . Mr. Tredegar repeated to me what you said to him last night , and I think he was annoyed that you were unwilling to give any proof of the charges you made . "
27806	27811	27812	27812	Amherst	96	" Charges ? Ah , "
27821	27842	27812	27812	Amherst	96	" he means my refusing to say who told me that Dr. Disbrow was not telling the truth about Dillon ? "
27843	27872	27752	27752	her	104	" Yes . He said that was a very grave accusation to make , and that no one should have made it without being able to give proof . "
27873	27902	27752	27752	her	104	" That is quite true , theoretically . But in this case it would be easy for you or Mr. Tredegar to find out whether I was right . "
27903	27916	27958	27958	he	96	" But Mr. Tredegar said you refused to say who told you . "
27917	27942	27752	27752	her	104	" I was bound to , as it happened . But I am not bound to prevent your trying to get the same information . "
27943	27945	27946	27946	she	806	" Ah-- "
27969	28005	27958	27958	he	96	" If you really wish to judge for yourself , why not go to the hospital now ? I shall be free in five minutes , and could go with you if you wish it . "
28117	28132	28133	28133	she	104	" To the hospital -- now ? I should like it of all things , "
28148	28183	28133	28133	she	104	" Of course that is the best way of finding out . I ought to have insisted on seeing Dillon yesterday -- but I begin to think the matron did n't want me to . "

28605	28668	28601	28601	she	102	" do you mean the young lady you saw here yesterday ? Certainly -- I had forgotten : Miss Brent was merely a -- er -- temporary substitute . I believe she was recommended to Dr. Disbrow by one of his patients ; but we found her quite unsuitable -- in fact , unfitted -- and the doctor discharged her this morning . "
28702	28706	28707	28707	Amherst	96	" You see ? "
28712	28726	28707	28707	Amherst	96	" I see -- they have sent her away because she told you , "
28744	28753	28754	28754	Amherst	96	" Do you know where she has gone ? "
28798	28825	28795	28795	Bessy	125	" It was the nurse , of course -- if we could only find her ! Brent -- did Mrs. Ogan say her name was Brent ? "
28826	28833	28772	28772	she	102	" Do you know the name ? "
28834	28853	28772	28772	she	102	" Yes -- at least -- but it could n't , of course , be the girl I knew---- "
28854	28884	28795	28795	Bessy	125	" Miss Brent saw you the night you arrived , and thought she recognized you . She said you and she had been at some school or convent together . "
28885	28935	28772	28772	she	102	" The Sacred Heart ? Then it _ is _ Justine Brent ! I heard they had lost their money -- I have n't seen her for years . But how strange that she should be a hospital nurse ! And why is she at Hanaford , I wonder ? "
28936	28983	28772	28772	she	102	" She was here only on a visit ; she did n't tell me where she lived . She said she heard that a surgical nurse was wanted at the hospital , and volunteered her services ; I 'm afraid she got small thanks for them . "
28984	29006	28795	28795	Bessy	125	" Do you really think they sent her away for talking to you ? How do you suppose they found out ? "
29007	29039	29040	29040	Amherst	96	" I waited for her last night when she left the hospital , and I suppose Mrs. Ogan or one of the doctors saw us . It was thoughtless of me , "
29045	29093	29040	29040	Amherst	96	" I wish I had seen her -- poor Justine ! We were the greatest friends at the convent . She was the ringleader in all our mischief -- I never saw any one so quick and clever . I suppose her fun is all gone now . "
29151	29195	29142	29142	she	104	" Thank you so much , Mr. Amherst . I am glad you suggested that Mr. Truscomb should find some work for Dillon about the office . But I must talk to you about this again -- can you come in this evening ? "
30171	30177	30178	30178	he	96	" It is much better , "
30181	30215	30178	30178	he	96	" that they should all think so , and she too , for Truscomb will be on his legs again in a day or two , and then my hours will be numbered . "
30261	30297	30298	30298	he	96	" Of course we want to be up - to - date -- there 's no reason why the Westmore mills should n't do as well by their people as any mills in the country , "

30386	30459	30460	30461	Mr. Gaines	110	" My dear Bessy , we all owe you a debt of gratitude for coming here , and bringing , so to speak , a fresh eye to bear on the subject . If I 've been , perhaps , a little too exclusively absorbed in making the mills profitable , my friend Langhope will , I believe , not be the first to -- er -- cast a stone at me . "
30493	30543	30544	30544	he	110	" And in that respect , I think we can challenge comparison with any industry in the state ; but I am the first to admit that there may be another side , a side that it takes a woman -- a mother -- to see . For instance , "

30689	30712	30685	30685	she	878	" I am afraid I never should have thought of these things if Mr. Amherst had not pointed them out to me . "
30719	30776	30713	30714	Mr. Gaines	110	" Very gratifying to Mr. Amherst to have you put it in that way ; and I am sure we all appreciate his valuable hints .

Of course that loss of interest may be merely physical -- I should call it so in a nervous patient , no doubt . But in myself it seems different -- it seems to go to the roots of the world . You know it was always the imaginative side of my work that helped me over the ugly details -- the pity and beauty that disinfected the physical horror ; but now that feeling is lost , and only the mortal disgust remains . Oh , Effie , I do n't want to be a ministering angel any more -- I want to be uncertain , coy and hard to please .

Of course she would never let any one see that she 's not perfectly happy ; but I 'm told he has given them all a great deal of trouble by interfering in the management of the mills , and his manner is so cold and sarcastic -- the truth is , I suppose he 's never quite at ease in society . _ Her _ family have never been really reconciled to the marriage ; and Westy Gaines says---- "

44363	44370	44445	44445	She	100	" Ah , then do n't ! "
44371	44375	44319	44319	She	100	" Do n't ? "
44376	44379	44380	44380	He	113	" I mean-- "
44399	44436	44380	44380	He	113	" I was only thinking what risks we run when we scramble into the chariot of the gods and try to do the driving . Be passive -- be passive , and you 'll be happier ! "
44437	44444	44445	44445	She	100	" Oh , as to that-- ! "
44456	44476	44445	44445	She	100	" But Dillon , for instance -- would _ he _ have been happier if I 'd been passive ? "
44482	44491	44477	44477	Amherst	117	" There again -- how can one tell ? "
44492	44501	44452	44452	her	100	" And the risk 's not worth taking ? "
44502	44505	44506	44506	She	100	" No ! "
44517	44529	44506	44506	She	100	" Do you mean that seriously , I wonder ? Do you---- "
44530	44565	44566	44566	He	1208	" Act on it myself ? God forbid ! The gods drive so badly . There 's poor Dillon ... he happened to be in their way ... as we all are at times . "
44583	44628	44566	44566	He	1208	" In Dillon 's case , however , my axioms do n't apply . When my wife heard the truth she was , of course , immensely kind to him ; and if it had n't been for you she might never have known . "
44632	44650	44651	44651	she	100	" I think you would have found out -- I was only the humble instrument . But now-- "
44652	44661	44662	44662	Amherst	117	hesitated--"now you must be able to do so much-- "
44678	44714	44662	44662	Amherst	117	" Out at Westmore ? You 've never been there since ? Yes -- my wife has made some changes ; but it 's all so problematic -- and one would have to live here .... "
44715	44722	44723	44723	He	1208	" You do n't , then ? "
44730	44763	44764	44764	He	1208	" Of course I 'm here often ; and she comes now and then . But the journey 's tiresome , and it is not always easy for her to get away . "
44794	44804	44813	44813	he	1208	" But then we 're _ not _ strangers ! "
44830	44859	44813	44813	he	1208	" That reminds me -- I think you know my wife . I heard her asking Mrs. Dressel about you . She wants so much to see you . "
45645	45648	45635	45635	she	100	" dreadfully fond "
45652	45896	45630	45630	she	100	" And I 've wanted you so often , Justine : you 're the only clever person I 'm not afraid of , because your cleverness always used to make things clear instead of confusing them . I 've asked so many people about you -- but I never heard a word till just the other day -- wasn't it odd?--when our new doctor at Rushton happened to say that he knew you . I 've been rather unwell lately -- nervous and tired , and sleeping badly -- and he told me I ought to keep perfectly quiet , and be under the care of a nurse who could make me do as she chose : just such a nurse as a wonderful Miss Brent he had known at St. Elizabeth 's , whose patients obeyed her as if she 'd been the colonel of a regiment . His description made me laugh , it reminded me so much of the way you used to make me do what you wanted at the convent -- and then it suddenly occurred to me that I had heard of you having gone in for nursing , and we compared notes , and I found it was really you ! Was n't it odd that we should discover each other in that way ? I daresay we might have passed in the street and never known it -- I'm sure I must be horribly changed .... "
46064	46081	46082	46082	Justine	100	" You absurd child ! You 've not changed a bit except to grow more so ! "
46093	46096	46082	46082	Justine	100	" a compliment "
46106	46123	46082	46082	Justine	100	" Well , _ you _ have , then , Justine -- you've grown extraordinarily handsome ! "
46124	46135	46136	46137	the other	736	" That _ is _ extraordinary of me , certainly , "
46141	46163	46136	46137	the other	736	" But then think what room for improvement there was -- and how much time I 've had to improve in ! "
46164	46175	46176	46176	Bessy	170	" It is a long time , is n't it ? "
46179	46352	46176	46176	Bessy	170	" I feel so intimate , still , with the old Justine of the convent , and I do n't know the new one a bit . Just think -- I've a great girl of my own , almost as old as we were when we went to the Sacred Heart : But perhaps you do n't know anything about me either . You see , I married again two years ago , and my poor baby died last March ... so I have only Cicely . It was such a disappointment -- I wanted a boy dreadfully , and I understand little babies so much better than a big girl like Cicely .... Oh , dear , here is Juliana Gaines bringing up some more tiresome people ! It 's such a bore , but John says I must know them all . Well , thank goodness we 've only one more day in this dreadful place -- and of course I shall see you , dear , before we go .... "
46444	46452	46453	46457	the younger of the two	1243	" Ah , here he is now ! "
46484	46494	46495	46495	she	178	" We were not talking of you , though , "
46509	46524	46495	46495	she	178	" but of Bessy -- which , I suppose , is almost as indiscreet . "
46566	46578	46579	46580	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Indiscreet of his own mother and his wife 's friend ? "
46609	46629	46596	46597	the latter	673	" Mrs. Ansell knows that indiscretion is the last fault of which her friends are likely to accuse her . "
46630	46640	46641	46641	she	117	" _ Raison de plus _ , you mean ? "
46659	46734	46735	46735	She	117	" Well , if I take advantage of my reputation for discretion to meddle a little now and then , at least I do so in a good cause . I was just saying how much I wish that you would take Bessy to Europe ; and I am so sure of my cause , in this case , that I am going to leave it to your mother to give you my reasons . "
46779	46794	46795	46795	he	1252	" No one else will be able to put your reasons half so convincingly , "
46802	46817	46795	46795	he	1252	" and I am sure my mother would much rather be spared the attempt . "
46832	46837	46838	46838	she	178	" My dear Lucy , "
46857	46884	46885	46885	she	178	" I 'm sorry to be flattered at your expense , but it 's not in human nature to resist such an appeal . You see , "
46894	46914	46885	46885	she	178	" how sure I am of myself -- and of _ you _ , when you 've heard me . "
46915	46926	46927	46928	his mother	396	" Oh , John is always ready to hear one , "
46932	46968	46927	46928	his mother	396	" Well , I do n't know that I shall even ask him to do as much as that -- I'm so sure , after all , that my suggestion carries its explanation with it . "
46992	47003	47004	47004	He	99	" The suggestion that I should take Bessy to Europe ? "
47008	47014	47004	47004	He	99	" When -- next autumn ? "
47015	47028	47029	47029	He	99	" No : now -- at once . On a long honeymoon . "
47050	47069	47029	47029	He	99	" At once ? No -- I ca n't see that the suggestion carries its explanation with it . "
47112	47120	47121	47121	She	178	" Ah , you 'll see farther presently-- "
47142	47150	47151	47151	she	178	" It 's not , after all , "
47159	47223	47151	47151	she	178	" a case for argument , and still less for persuasion . My reasons are excellent -- I should insist on putting them to you myself if they were not ! But they 're so good that I can leave you to find them out -- and to back them up with your own , which will probably be a great deal better . "
47263	47274	47275	47275	Amherst	170	" What has she been saying to you , mother ? "
47302	47324	47293	47293	her	117	" Now , Johnny , I wo n't answer a single question till you smooth out those lines between your eyes . "
47336	47360	47328	47328	his	1257	" Well , dear , there have to be some wrinkles in every family , and as you absolutely refuse to take your share-- "
47599	47634	47635	47636	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Now , then , if I present a sufficiently unruffled surface , let us go back to Mrs. Ansell -- for I confess that her mysterious reasons are not yet apparent to me . "
47643	47653	47635	47636	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Maria Ansell is devoted to you too , John---- "
47654	47677	47635	47636	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Of course she is ! It 's her _ role _ to be devoted to everybody -- especially to her enemies . "
47678	47682	47635	47636	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Her enemies ? "
47683	47705	47635	47636	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Oh , I did n't intend any personal application . But why does she want me to take Bessy abroad ? "
47706	47719	47720	47720	Amherst	170	" She and Mr. Langhope think that Bessy is not looking well . "
47732	47742	47720	47720	Amherst	170	" What do _ you _ think , mother ? "
47743	47782	47783	47783	Amherst	170	" I had n't noticed it myself : Bessy seems to me prettier than ever . But perhaps she has less colour -- and she complains of not sleeping . Maria thinks she still frets over the baby . "
47789	47796	47783	47783	Amherst	170	" Is Europe the only panacea ? "
47797	47863	47635	47636	Mrs. Amherst	117	" You should consider , John , that Bessy is used to change and amusement . I think you sometimes forget that other people have n't your faculty of absorbing themselves in a single interest . And Maria says that the new doctor at Clifton , whom they seem to think so clever , is very anxious that Bessy should go to Europe this summer . "
47864	47891	47892	47893	Mrs. Amherst	117	" No doubt ; and so is every one else : I mean her father and old Tredegar -- and your friend Mrs. Ansell not least . "
47902	47914	47892	47893	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Well , then -- if they all think she needs it---- "
47915	47956	47957	47957	He	1270	" Good heavens , if travel were what she needed!--Why , we 've never stopped travelling since we married . We 've been everywhere on the globe except at Hanaford -- this is her second visit here in three years ! "
47969	48000	48001	48001	he	1270	" It 's not because her health requires it -- it 's to get me away from Westmore , to prevent things being done there that ought to be done ! "
48030	48044	48023	48023	her	117	" To prevent things being done ? What a strange thing to say ! "
48045	48065	48066	48067	His mother	396	" I should n't have said it if I had n't seen you falling under Mrs. Ansell 's spell . "
48082	48088	48089	48089	She	117	" Really , my son-- ! "
48104	48115	48091	48091	her	117	" If you mean that I have ever attempted to interfere---- "
48116	48128	48091	48091	her	117	" No , no : but when they pervert things so damnably---- "
48129	48132	48133	48133	He	1270	" John ! "
48151	48250	48133	48133	He	1270	" Well , then -- put it that they have as much right to their view as I have : I only want you to see what it is . Whenever I try to do anything at Westmore -- to give a real start to the work that Bessy and I planned together -- some pretext is found to stop it : to pack us off to the ends of the earth , to cry out against reducing her income , to encourage her in some new extravagance to which the work at the mills must be sacrificed ! "
48284	48300	48275	48275	her	117	" John -- are you sure you 're not sacrificing your wife to the mills ? "
48319	48329	48330	48330	he	393	" You see it as they do , then ? "
48337	48356	48330	48330	he	393	" I see it as any old woman would , who had my experiences to look back to . "
48357	48360	48361	48361	he	393	" Mother ! "
48368	48432	48364	48364	She	117	" Do you think I mean that as a reproach ? That 's because men will never understand women -- least of all , sons their mothers . No real mother wants to come first ; she puts her son 's career ahead of everything . But it 's different with a wife -- and a wife as much in love as Bessy . "
48437	48446	48433	48433	Amherst	170	" I should have thought that was a reason---- "
48447	48465	48485	48485	She	170	" That would reconcile her to being set aside , to counting only second in your plans ? "
48466	48477	48485	48485	She	170	" They were _ her _ plans when we married ! "
48478	48484	48485	48485	She	170	" Ah , my dear-- ! "
48589	48610	48582	48582	she	170	" Poor mother ! And I 've kept you to myself all this time , and spoiled your good afternoon . "
48611	48630	48631	48631	She	170	" No , dear ; I was a little tired , and had slipped away to be quiet . "
48645	48676	48631	48631	She	170	" I know how you feel about doing your duty , John ; but now that things are so comfortably settled , is n't it a pity to unsettle them ? "
48794	48801	48802	48802	he	99	" Now that things are comfortably settled-- "
49201	49208	49190	49190	she	396	" ampler ether , a diviner air "
49722	49723	49717	49717	she	3350	" enough"--and

51347	51367	51368	51368	Amherst	99	" If we men are to talk shop , is it necessary to keep Bessy in this hot room ? "
51380	51396	51397	51397	he	99	" There 's a breeze from the west -- the room will be cooler now , "
51405	51412	51397	51397	he	99	" Oh , I do n't mind-- "
51442	51464	51437	51438	Mr. Tredegar	125	" May I trouble you for that other box of cigars , Amherst ? No , _ not _ the Cabanas . "
51479	51494	51495	51495	he	99	" Ah , thank you , my dear . I was about to ask , "
51514	51533	51495	51495	he	99	" what special purpose will be served by a preliminary review of the questions to be discussed tomorrow . "
51534	51539	51541	51542	Mr. Langhope	120	" Ah -- exactly , "
51544	51558	51559	51559	Amherst	99	" The madeira , my dear John ? No -- ah--_please_--to the left ! "
51597	51625	51577	51578	Mr. Tredegar	125	" The purpose is to define my position in the matter ; and I prefer that Bessy should do this with your help rather than with mine . "
51648	51687	51688	51689	Mr. Tredegar	125	" Is not your position naturally involved in and defined by hers ? You will excuse my saying that -- technically speaking , of course -- I can not distinctly conceive of it as having any separate existence . "
51724	51732	51733	51733	Amherst	99	" Certainly it is involved in hers , "
51736	51755	51733	51733	Amherst	99	" but how far that defines it is just what I have waited till now to find out . "
51786	51803	51773	51774	her father	3496	" But surely -- according to old - fashioned ideas -- it implies identity of interests ? "
51804	51811	51812	51812	Amherst	99	" Yes ; but whose interests ? "
51815	51829	51812	51812	Amherst	99	" Why -- your wife 's , man ! She owns the mills . "
51833	51881	51830	51830	Amherst	99	" I would rather talk of my wife 's interest in the mills than of her interests there ; but we 'll keep to the plural if you prefer it . Personally , I believe the terms should be interchangeable in the conduct of such a business . "
51882	51891	51893	51894	Mr. Tredegar	125	" Ah -- I'm glad to hear that , "
51897	51908	51893	51894	Mr. Tredegar	125	" since it 's precisely the view we all take . "
51914	51919	51920	51920	he	99	" Definitions are ambiguous , "
51923	52004	52005	52005	He	99	" Before you adopt mine , perhaps I had better develop it a little farther . What I mean is , that Bessy 's interests in Westmore should be regulated by her interest in it -- in its welfare as a social body , aside from its success as a commercial enterprise . If we agree on this definition , we are at one as to the other : namely that my relation to the matter is defined by hers . "
52037	52116	52033	52033	he	99	" There is nothing new in this . I have tried to make Bessy understand from the beginning what obligations I thought the ownership of Westmore entailed , and how I hoped to help her fulfill them ; but ever since our marriage all definite discussion of the subject has been put off for one cause or another , and that is my reason for urging that it should be brought up at the directors ' meeting tomorrow . "
52142	52183	52124	52124	Bessy	125	" But , John , I sometimes think you forget how much has been done at Westmore -- the Mothers ' Club , and the play - ground , and all -- in the way of carrying out your ideas . "
52209	52240	52206	52206	Amherst	99	" No , I have not forgotten ; and I am grateful to you for giving my ideas a trial . But what has been done hitherto is purely superficial . "
52251	52334	52247	52247	he	99	" Do n't think I undervalue it for that reason -- heaven knows the surface of life needs improving ! But it 's like picking flowers and sticking them in the ground to make a garden -- unless you transplant the flower with its roots , and prepare the soil to receive it , your garden will be faded tomorrow . No radical changes have yet been made at Westmore ; and it is of radical changes that I want to speak . "
52350	52382	52343	52344	Mr. Langhope	120	" Upon my soul , Amherst , the tone you take about what your wife has done does n't strike me as the likeliest way of encouraging her to do more ! "
52383	52412	52343	52344	Mr. Langhope	120	" I do n't want to encourage her to do more on such a basis -- the sooner she sees the futility of it the better for Westmore ! "
52413	52417	52418	52418	Bessy	125	" The futility-- ? "
52454	52532	52441	52441	his	125	" My dear child , I see Amherst 's point , and it is best , as he says , that you should see it too . What he desires , as I understand it , is the complete reconstruction of the present state of things at Westmore ; and he is right in saying that all your good works there -- night - schools , and nursery , and so forth -- leave that issue untouched . "
52598	52623	52624	52624	she	1386	" I 'm sorry if all I have tried to do at Westmore is useless -- but I suppose I shall never understand business , "
52636	52642	52643	52643	Amherst	99	" This is not business , "
52647	52668	52643	52643	Amherst	99	" It 's the question of your personal relation to the people there -- the last thing that business considers . "
52676	52698	52669	52670	Mr. Langhope	120	" I wish to heaven the owner of the mills had made it clear just what that relation was to be ! "
52699	52707	52708	52708	Amherst	99	" I think he did , sir , "
52712	52724	52708	52708	Amherst	99	" in leaving his wife the unrestricted control of the property . "
52770	52777	52778	52778	she	1388	" I am sure , papa , "
52785	52808	52778	52778	she	1388	" that poor Richard , though he knew I was not clever , felt he could trust me to take the best advice---- "

52834	52864	52829	52830	Mr. Tredegar	125	" We are merely losing time by this digression . Let me suggest that Amherst should give us an idea of the changes he wishes to make at Westmore . "

54082	54103	54070	54070	she	1425	" Shall I put it out , then ? You ca n't sleep with such a glare in your eyes . "
54104	54123	54070	54070	she	1425	" I should not sleep at any rate ; and I hate to lie awake in the dark . "
54124	54131	54132	54132	He	99	" Why should n't you sleep ? "
54158	54167	54154	54154	she	1425	" B -- because I 'm so unhappy ! "
54210	54212	54213	54213	She	1425	" Bessy---- "
54414	54428	54429	54429	he	99	" Do n't be unhappy . You decided as seemed best to you , "
54446	54462	54463	54463	she	1425	" But I hate all these arguments and disputes . Why should you unsettle everything ? "
54489	54501	54502	54502	he	99	" You are right . I see the uselessness of it , "
54529	54538	54512	54512	She	1425	" You _ are _ angry with me ! "
54539	54545	54546	54546	He	99	" Was that troubling you ? "
54568	54574	54575	54575	he	99	" I am not angry , "

54612	54694	54588	54588	She	1425	" Do n't talk like that ! I ca n't endure to be humoured like a baby . I am unhappy because I ca n't see why all these wretched questions should be dragged into our life . I hate to have you always disagreeing with Mr. Tredegar , who is so clever and has so much experience ; and yet I hate to see you give way to him , because that makes it appear as if ... as if .... "
54695	54706	54707	54707	Amherst	99	" He did n't care a straw for my ideas ? "
54710	54732	54707	54707	Amherst	99	" Well , he doesn't -- and I never dreamed of making him . So do n't worry about that either . "
54733	54750	54588	54588	She	1425	" You never dreamed of making him care for your ideas ? But then why do you---- "
54751	54765	54766	54766	Amherst	99	" Why do I go on setting them forth at such great length ? "
54770	54781	54766	54766	Amherst	99	" To convince you -- that 's my only ambition . "
54821	54839	54818	54818	her	1435	" To convince _ me _ ? But you know I am so ignorant of such things . "
54840	54845	54782	54782	She	1435	" Most women are . "
54846	54863	54785	54785	him	99	" I never pretended to understand anything about -- economics , or whatever you call it . "
54864	54867	54818	54818	her	1435	" No . "
54868	54871	54872	54872	He	99	" Then how---- "
54880	54895	54872	54872	He	99	" I thought you might have begun to understand something about _ me _ . "
54896	54900	54818	54818	her	1435	" About you ? "
54910	54935	54936	54936	He	99	" About what my ideas on such subjects were likely to be worth -- judging from what you know of me in other respects . "
54944	54947	54948	54948	he	99	" Well , "
54952	54962	54948	54948	he	99	" I suppose I 've had my answer tonight . "
54963	54968	54969	54969	He	99	" Oh , John---- ! "
55099	55111	55112	55112	he	99	" Well -- isn't it natural that I should think so ? "
55122	55228	55112	55112	he	99	" When we married I never expected you to care or know much about economics . It is n't a quality a man usually chooses his wife for . But I had a fancy -- perhaps it shows my conceit -- that when we had lived together a year or two , and you 'd found out what kind of a fellow I was in other ways -- ways any woman can judge of -- I had a fancy that you might take my opinions on faith when it came to my own special business -- the thing I 'm generally supposed to know about . "
55284	55325	55265	55266	a god	1440	" I _ do _ feel sure you know -- about the treatment of the hands and all that ; but you said yourself once -- the first time we ever talked about Westmore -- that the business part was different---- "
55410	55474	55385	55385	Amherst	99	" It was my situation that was different ; not what you call the business part . That is inextricably bound up with the treatment of the hands . If I am to have anything to do with the mills now I can deal with them only as your representative ; and as such I am bound to take in the whole question . "
55498	55564	55489	55489	he	99	" That was what I meant by saying that I hoped you would take me on faith . If I want the welfare of Westmore it 's above all , I believe , because I want Westmore to see you as _ I _ do -- as the dispenser of happiness , who could not endure to benefit by any wrong or injustice to others . "
55565	55580	55489	55489	he	99	" Of course , of course I do n't want to do them injustice ! "
55581	55585	55586	55586	He	99	" Well , then---- "
55627	55663	55619	55619	her	1438	" But I care for what people say of you too ! And you know -- it 's horrid , but one must consider it -- if they say you 're spending my money imprudently .... "
55673	55708	55619	55619	her	1438	" I do n't mind for myself ... even if I have to give up as many things as papa and Mr. Tredegar think ... but there is Cicely ... and if people said .... "
55709	55737	55738	55738	Amherst	99	" If people said I was spending Cicely 's money on improving the condition of the people to whose work she will some day owe all her wealth-- "
55741	55764	55738	55738	Amherst	99	" Well , I would rather hear that said of me than any other thing I can think of , except one . "
55765	55769	55619	55619	her	1438	" Except what ? "
55770	55784	55785	55785	She	1438	" That I was doing it with her mother 's help and approval . "
55818	55841	55619	55619	her	1438	" I should always want to help you , of course ; but if Mr. Tredegar and Halford Gaines think your plan unbusinesslike---- "
55842	55889	55890	55890	She	1438	" Mr. Tredegar and Halford Gaines are certain to think it so . And that is why I said , just now , that it comes , in the end , to your choosing between us ; taking them on experience or taking me on faith . "
55896	55916	55890	55890	She	1438	" Of course I should expect to give up things .... You would n't want me to live here ? "
55917	55925	55926	55926	he	99	" I should not ask you to , "
55933	55947	55926	55926	he	99	" I suppose there would be a good many things we could n't do---- "
55948	56003	55890	55890	She	1438	" You would certainly have less money for a number of years ; after that , I believe you would have more rather than less ; but I should not want you to think that , beyond a reasonable point , the prosperity of the mills was ever to be measured by your dividends . "
56004	56007	56008	56008	She	1438	" No . "
56016	56033	56008	56008	She	1438	" I suppose , for instance , we should have to give up Europe this summer---- ? "
56089	56101	56102	56102	he	99	" I do n't see how you could go to Europe , "
56105	56113	56114	56114	she	1438	" The doctor thinks I need it , "
56117	56124	56114	56114	she	1438	" In that case , of course-- "
56149	56164	56165	56165	he	99	" What you need most , in the meantime , is a little sleep , "
56168	56182	56183	56183	He	99	" I will tell your maid not to disturb you in the morning . "
56204	56212	56213	56213	he	99	" And I will say goodbye now , "
56216	56229	56213	56213	he	99	" because I shall probably take an early train , before you wake---- "
56237	56249	56230	56230	She	1438	" An early train ? Why , where are you going ? "
56250	56288	56289	56289	Bessy	125	" I must go to Chicago some time this month , and as I shall not be wanted here tomorrow I might as well run out there at once , and join you next week at Lynbrook . "
56294	56300	56289	56289	Bessy	125	" But I do n't understand---- "
56305	56330	56331	56331	he	99	" Ca n't you understand that I am human enough to prefer , under the circumstances , not being present at tomorrow 's meeting ? "
56360	56368	56369	56369	he	99	" Shall I put the light out ? "
56381	56386	56369	56369	he	99	" Yes , please . "
56421	56428	56429	56429	He	99	" John -- oh , John ! "
56432	56441	56429	56429	He	99	" I ca n't _ bear _ it ! "
56446	56450	56429	56429	He	99	" Bear what ? "
56451	56457	56429	56429	He	99	" That you should hate me---- "
56458	56464	56465	56465	he	99	" Do n't be foolish , "
56475	56487	56465	56465	he	99	" But you do hate me -- and I deserve it ! "
56488	56497	56429	56429	He	99	" Nonsense , dear . Try to sleep . "
56498	56529	56530	56530	He	99	" I ca n't sleep till you 've forgiven me . Say you do n't hate me ! I 'll do anything ... only say you do n't hate me ! "
56579	56585	56586	56586	she	1446	" I 'll do anything ... "
57113	57133	57134	57135	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Dear Miss Brent ! I was just wondering how it was that I had n't seen you before . "
57210	57226	57185	57185	she	100	" I was out with Cicely when you arrived . We 've just come in . "
57227	57239	57240	57241	Mrs. Ansell	178	" The dear child ! I have n't seen her either . "
57269	57285	57286	57286	Justine	100	" I hear you are teaching her botany , and all kinds of wonderful things . "
57290	57312	57286	57286	Justine	100	" I am trying to teach her to wonder : that is the hardest faculty to cultivate in the modern child . "
57313	57323	57324	57325	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Yes -- I suppose so ; in myself , "
57332	57347	57348	57348	She	178	" I find it develops with age . The world is a remarkable place . "
57387	57394	57395	57395	she	178	" It 's a great thing , "
57398	57442	57395	57395	she	178	" for Bessy to have had your help -- for Cicely , and for herself too . There is so much that I want you to tell me about her . As an old friend I want the benefit of your fresher eye . "
57443	57447	57448	57448	Justine	100	" About Bessy ? "
57467	57476	57448	57448	Justine	100	" Do n't you find her looking better ? "
57477	57520	57395	57395	she	178	" Than when I left ? So much so that I was unduly disturbed , just now , by seeing that clever little doctor -- it _ was _ he , was n't it , who came up the lawn with you ? "
57521	57527	57528	57529	Miss Brent	97	" Dr. Wyant ? Yes . "
57533	57543	57528	57529	Miss Brent	97	" But he merely called -- with a message . "
57544	57594	57395	57395	she	178	" Not professionally ? _ Tant mieux ! _ The truth is , I was anxious about Bessy when I left -- I thought she ought to have gone abroad for a change . But , as it turns out , her little excursion with you did as well . "
57595	57615	57528	57529	Miss Brent	97	" I think she only needed rest . Perhaps her six weeks in the Adirondacks were better than Europe . "
57616	57630	57528	57529	Miss Brent	97	" Ah , under _ your _ care -- that made them better ! "
57692	57786	57657	57657	she	178	" I have always thought that Bessy , for all her health and activity , needs as much care as Cicely -- the kind of care a clever friend can give . She is so wasteful of her strength and her nerves , and so unwilling to listen to reason . Poor Dick Westmore watched over her as if she were a baby ; but perhaps Mr. Amherst , who must have been used to such a different type of woman , does n't realize ... and then he 's so little here .... "
57803	57836	57840	57840	her	97	" As an old friend I ca n't help telling you how much I hope she is to have you with her for a long time -- a long , long time . "
57849	57859	57840	57840	her	97	" Oh , soon she will not need any care---- "
57860	57872	57873	57874	Mrs. Ansell	178	" My dear Miss Brent , she will always need it ! "
57899	57916	57917	57917	She	178	" But perhaps there is not enough in such a life to satisfy your professional energies . "
57934	57950	57951	57951	she	178	" I am very glad , just now , to give my energies a holiday , "
57964	57990	57951	57951	she	178	" You are tired too ? Bessy wrote me you had been quite used up by a trying case after we saw you at Hanaford . "
57995	58014	57991	57992	Miss Brent	97	" When a nurse is fit for work she calls a trying case a ' beautiful ' one . "
58015	58019	58020	58021	Mrs. Ansell	178	" But meanwhile-- ? "
58031	58057	58020	58021	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Meanwhile , why not stay on with Cicely -- above all , with Bessy ? Surely she 's a ' beautiful ' case too . "
58058	58063	58064	58064	Justine	100	" Is n't she ? "
58068	58076	58064	58064	Justine	100	" And if you want to be tried-- "
58089	58097	58087	58087	her	178	shoulders--"you'll find there are trials enough everywhere . "
58113	58148	58098	58099	Her companion	296	" One of them is that it 's already after four , and that I must see that tea is sent down to the tennis - ground , and the new arrivals looked after . "
58149	58167	58087	58087	her	178	" I saw the omnibus on its way to the station . Are many more people coming ? "
58168	58184	58185	58186	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Five or six , I believe . The house is usually full for Sunday . "
58195	58203	58185	58186	Mrs. Ansell	178	" And when is Mr. Amherst expected ? "
58238	58245	58246	58246	she	178	" Bessy has not told me , "
58249	58251	58252	58254	the older woman	1491	" Ah-- "
58415	58425	58409	58410	Mr. Langhope	120	" Well , what do you make of it ? "
58426	58433	58434	58434	she	97	" What do _ you _ ? "
58476	58483	58469	58470	Mr. Langhope	120	" I want your fresher impressions . "
58484	58496	58409	58410	Mr. Langhope	120	" That 's what I just now said to Miss Brent . "
58497	58506	58469	58470	Mr. Langhope	120	" You 've been talking to Miss Brent ? "
58507	58524	58525	58526	Mr. Langhope	120	" Only a flying word -- she had to go and look after the new arrivals . "
58531	58541	58525	58526	Mr. Langhope	120	" Well , what did you say to her ? "
58542	58556	58557	58557	He	120	" Would n't you rather hear what she said to _ me _ ? "
58560	58585	58557	58557	He	120	" A good cross - examiner always gets the answers he wants . Let me hear your side , and I shall know hers . "
58586	58620	58469	58470	Mr. Langhope	120	" I should say that applied only to stupid cross - examiners ; or to those who have stupid subjects to deal with . And Miss Brent is not stupid , you know . "
58621	58633	58469	58470	Mr. Langhope	120	" Far from it ! What else do you make out ? "
58634	58644	58557	58557	He	120	" I make out that she 's in possession . "
58645	58648	58469	58470	Mr. Langhope	120	" Here ? "
58649	58660	58469	58470	Mr. Langhope	120	" Do n't look startled . Do you dislike her ? "
58661	58688	58557	58557	He	120	" Heaven forbid -- with those eyes ! She has a wit of her own , too -- and she certainly makes things easier for Bessy . "
58689	58705	58469	58470	Mr. Langhope	120	" She guards her carefully , at any rate . I could find out nothing . "
58706	58710	58469	58470	Mr. Langhope	120	" About Bessy ? "
58711	58717	58557	58557	He	120	" About the general situation . "
58718	58723	58724	58725	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Including Miss Brent ? "
58729	58738	58724	58725	Mrs. Ansell	178	" I made one little discovery about her . "
58739	58742	58557	58557	He	120	" Well ? "
58743	58752	58557	58557	He	120	" She 's intimate with the new doctor . "
58753	58756	58757	58758	Mr. Langhope	120	" Wyant ? "
58763	58775	58757	58758	Mr. Langhope	120	" What of that ? I believe she knew him before . "
58776	58806	58807	58808	Mr. Langhope	120	" I daresay . It 's of no special importance , except as giving us a possible clue to her character . She strikes me as interesting and mysterious . "
58811	58820	58807	58808	Mr. Langhope	120	" The things your imagination does for you ! "
58821	58838	58807	58808	Mr. Langhope	120	" It helps me to see that we may find Miss Brent useful as a friend . "
58839	58843	58807	58808	Mr. Langhope	120	" A friend ? "
58844	58848	58849	58849	She	1501	" An ally . "
58859	58866	58849	58849	She	1501	" She may restore the equilibrium . "
58874	58885	58886	58886	he	120	" Open Bessy 's eyes to Amherst ? Damn him ! "
58897	58904	58905	58905	she	178	" When was he last here ? "
58908	58930	58905	58905	she	178	" Five or six weeks ago -- for one night . His only visit since she came back from the Adirondacks . "
58931	58953	58849	58849	She	1501	" What do you think his motive is ? He must know what he risks in losing his hold on Bessy . "
58954	59112	59113	59114	Mr. Langhope	120	" His motive ? With your eye for them , can you ask ? A devouring ambition , that 's all ! Have n't you noticed that , in all except the biggest minds , ambition takes the form of wanting to command where one has had to obey ? Amherst has been made to toe the line at Westmore , and now he wants Truscomb -- yes , and Halford Gaines , too!--to do the same . That 's the secret of his servant - of - the - people pose -- gad , I believe it 's the whole secret of his marriage ! He 's devouring my daughter 's substance to pay off an old score against the mills . He 'll never rest till he has Truscomb out , and some creature of his own in command -- and then , _ vogue la galere _ ! If it were women , now , "
59119	59162	59113	59114	Mr. Langhope	120	" one could understand it , at his age , and with that damned romantic head -- but to be put aside for a lot of low mongrelly socialist mill - hands -- ah , my poor girl -- my poor girl ! "
59167	59186	59187	59187	she	178	" You did n't write me that things were so bad . There 's been no actual quarrel ? "
59190	59216	59187	59187	she	178	" How can there be , when the poor child does all he wants ? He 's simply too busy to come and thank her ! "

69626	69664	69623	69623	Amherst	170	" Yes ; but you must remember that it 's against all her habits -- and against the point of view of every one about her -- that she should lead that kind of life ; and meanwhile---- "
69665	69668	69697	69697	His	1689	" Well ? "
69669	69687	69623	69623	Amherst	170	" Meanwhile , is n't it expedient that you should , a little more , lead hers ? "
69738	69769	69771	69771	he	1689	" But Westmore is my life -- hers too , if she knew it ! I ca n't desert it now without being as false to her as to myself ! "
70014	70094	70007	70007	Justine	100	" Westmore must be foremost to both of you in time ; I do n't see how either of you can escape that . But the realization of it must come to Bessy through _ you _ , and for that reason I think that you ought to be more patient -- that you ought even to put the question aside for a time and enter a little more into her life while she is learning to understand yours . "
70136	70157	70132	70132	she	100	" But you have done just that in coming back now -- that is the real solution of the problem . "
70457	70490	70491	70491	Amherst	170	" I sometimes think it tires her more than she knows ; but I hope she can be persuaded to take better care of herself now that Mrs. Ansell has come back . "
70495	70501	70491	70491	Amherst	170	" Is Mrs. Ansell here ? "
70502	70509	70533	70533	Amherst	170	" She arrived from Europe today . "
70510	70519	70491	70491	Amherst	170	" And Mr. Langhope too , I suppose ? "
70520	70532	70533	70533	Amherst	170	" Yes . He came from Newport about ten days ago . "
70659	70679	70680	70680	she	100	" I am sure of one thing -- Bessy will be very , very glad that you have come , "
70683	70687	70688	70688	he	1714	" Thank you , "
71254	71266	71245	71245	herself	170	" You do n't seem a bit glad to see me ! "
71299	71315	71288	71288	Cicely	167	" Why should I be gladder than other days ? It is n't a birthday . "
71327	71367	71317	71317	Cordelia	189	" You horrid child to say such a cruel thing when you know I love you better and better every minute ! But you do n't care for me any longer because Justine has taken you away from me ! "
71443	71481	71482	71482	She	170	" I know she 's cleverer than I am , and more amusing , and can tell you about plants and animals and things ... and I daresay she tells you how tiresome and stupid I am .... "
71510	71513	71574	71574	she	170	" Mamma 's "
71518	71564	71482	71482	She	170	" Do n't mind me -- my head aches horribly . I think I 'll rush off for a gallop on Impulse before dinner . Miss Dill , Cicely 's nails are a sight -- I suppose that comes of grubbing up wild - flowers . "
71614	71627	71605	71606	Miss Dill	191	" Mother 's prettiest -- but I do like Justine the best . "
72049	72062	72038	72039	Mr. Langhope	120	" Ah , that 's the test -- I always said so ! "
72857	72872	72873	72873	Amherst	170	" When did you get here ? You never wrote me you were coming ! "
72883	72897	72898	72898	he	3393	" No ; you must forgive me . I have been very busy , "
72936	72949	72950	72950	she	170	" You are always too busy to let me hear from you , "
72978	72990	72972	72972	he	3393	" It was too difficult -- I did n't know how , "
73032	73044	73045	73045	he	3393	" I am sorry -- I'm a bad hand at writing , "
73057	73066	73053	73053	him	3393	" I hope my coming is not inconvenient ? "
73075	73099	73053	73053	him	3393	" Of course not . But it must seem rather odd to our visitors that I should know so little of your plans . "
73108	73128	73102	73102	he	3393	" I know I do n't think enough about appearances -- I'll try to do better the next time . "
73324	73336	73310	73310	He	3393	" You look tired . Why do you ride so late ? "
73337	73373	73374	73374	Amherst	170	" Oh , I just wanted to give Impulse a gallop . I had n't time to take her out earlier , and if I let the grooms exercise her they 'll spoil her mouth . "
73377	73396	73374	73374	Amherst	170	" You ought not to ride that mare alone at night . She shies at everything after dark . "
73397	73413	73414	73414	she	170	" She 's the only horse I care for -- the others are all cows , "
73422	73438	73414	73414	she	170	" Well , you must take me with you the next time you ride her . "
73482	73498	73499	73499	she	170	" Yes , we 'll go tomorrow . How long do you mean to stay ? "
73561	73566	73567	73567	she	170	" I only asked , "
73570	73598	73567	73567	she	170	" because there is to be a fancy ball at the Hunt Club on the twentieth , and I thought of giving a big dinner here first . "
73685	73714	73681	73681	he	1775	" Fancy balls are a little out of my line ; but at any rate I shall have to be back at the mills the day after tomorrow . "
73726	73746	73681	73681	he	1775	" The day after tomorrow ? It seems hardly worth while to have come so far for two days ! "
73747	73770	73784	73784	Amherst	170	" Oh , I do n't mind the journey -- and there are one or two matters I must consult you about . "
73899	73935	73936	73936	Amherst	170	" I do n't see why you still go through the form of consulting me about Westmore , when you have always done just as you pleased there , without regard to me or Cicely . "
73973	73988	73989	73989	she	170	" It does n't matter -- of course I 'll do whatever you wish , "
73994	74010	73989	73989	she	170	" But I could have sent my signature , if that is all you came for---- "
74011	74014	74016	74016	Amherst	170	" Thanks , "
74019	74028	74016	74016	Amherst	170	" I shall remember that the next time . "
74063	74071	74059	74059	she	170	" We shall be late for dinner , "
74091	74094	74095	74095	he	1780	" Bessy ! "
75702	75715	75688	75689	Fenton Carbury	193	" Yes , I understand the flat - tread tire is best , "
75718	75732	75688	75689	Fenton Carbury	193	" There 's a good deal to be said for the low tension magneto---- "
75834	75857	75858	75858	She	1828	" Westmore must be foremost to you both in time -- I do n't see how either of you can escape it . "
75941	75950	75938	75938	Justine	100	" Westmore must be foremost to you both , "
76214	76220	76221	76221	he	120	" I told you so , "
76336	76349	76326	76326	he	120	" It 's as well I saved that Ming from the ruins . "
76350	76354	76355	76355	she	178	" What ruins ? "
76388	76470	76375	76375	He	120	" Truscomb is down and out -- resigned , ' the wise it call . ' And the alterations at Westmore are going to cost a great deal more than my experienced son - in - law expected . This is Westy 's morning budget -- he and Amherst had it out last night . I tell my poor girl that at least she 'll lose nothing when the _ bibelots _ I 've bought for her go up the spout . "
76480	76495	76471	76472	Mrs. Ansell	178	" What has become of Bessy ? I 've not seen her since luncheon . "
76496	76515	76375	76375	He	120	" No . She and Blanche Carbury have motored over to dine with the Nick Ledgers at Islip . "
76516	76525	76375	76375	He	120	" Did you see her before she left ? "
76526	76559	76375	76375	He	120	" For a moment , but she said very little . Westy tells me that Amherst hints at leasing the New York house . One can understand that she 's left speechless . "
76570	76576	76560	76561	Mrs. Ansell	178	" The New York house ? "
76588	76598	76578	76578	she	178	" If you knew how I detest Blanche Carbury ! "
76609	76633	76599	76600	Mr. Langhope	120	" She is not the friend I should have chosen for Bessy -- but we know that Providence makes use of strange instruments . "
76634	76640	76641	76641	She	178	" Providence and Blanche Carbury ? "
76646	76654	76641	76641	She	178	" Ah , you are profoundly corrupt ! "
76655	76691	76599	76600	Mr. Langhope	120	" I have the coarse masculine habit of looking facts in the face . Woman - like , you prefer to make use of them privately , and cut them when you meet in public . "
76692	76712	76599	76600	Mr. Langhope	120	" Blanche is not the kind of fact I should care to make use of under any circumstances whatever ! "
76713	76744	76745	76745	She	178	" No one asks you to . Simply regard her as a force of nature -- let her alone , and do n't put up too many lightning - rods . "
76753	76767	76745	76745	She	178	" Do you really mean that you want Bessy to get a divorce ? "
76768	76796	76599	76600	Mr. Langhope	120	" Your style is elliptical , dear Maria ; but divorce does not frighten me very much . It has grown almost as painless as modern dentistry . "
76797	76808	76745	76745	She	178	" It 's our odious insensibility that makes it so ! "
76820	76840	76809	76810	Mr. Langhope	120	" How else , then , do you propose that Bessy shall save what is left of her money ? "
76841	76865	76745	76745	She	178	" I would rather see her save what is left of her happiness . Bessy will never be happy in the new way . "
76866	76875	76599	76600	Mr. Langhope	120	" What do you call the new way ? "
76876	76895	76809	76810	Mr. Langhope	120	" Launching one 's boat over a human body -- or several , as the case may be ! "
76896	76913	76745	76745	She	178	" But do n't you see that , as an expedient to bring this madman to reason---- "
76914	76926	76599	76600	Mr. Langhope	120	" I 've told you that you do n't understand him ! "
76951	76964	76927	76928	Mr. Langhope	120	" Well , then , explain him , for God 's sake ! "
76965	76981	76745	76745	She	178	" I might explain him by saying that she 's still in love with him . "
76982	76995	76996	76997	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Ah , if you 're still imprisoned in the old formulas ! "
77005	77071	76996	76997	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Is n't that precisely what Bessy is ? Is n't she one of the most harrowing victims of the plan of bringing up our girls in the double bondage of expediency and unreality , corrupting their bodies with luxury and their brains with sentiment , and leaving them to reconcile the two as best they can , or lose their souls in the attempt ? "
77076	77114	77072	77073	Mr. Langhope	120	" I may observe that , with my poor child so early left alone to me , I supposed I was doing my best in committing her guidance to some of the most admirable women I know . "
77115	77144	77145	77146	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Of whom I was one -- and not the least lamentable example of the system ! Of course the only thing that saves us from their vengeance , "
77149	77161	77145	77146	Mrs. Ansell	178	" is that so few of them ever stop to think .... "
77162	77181	77072	77073	Mr. Langhope	120	" And yet , as I make out , it 's precisely what you would have Bessy do ! "
77182	77227	77229	77230	Mrs. Ansell	178	" It 's what neither you nor I can help her doing . You 've given her just acuteness enough to question , without consecutiveness enough to explain . But if she must perish in the struggle -- and I see no hope for her-- "
77240	77273	77229	77230	Mrs. Ansell	178	" at least let her perish defending her ideals and not denying them -- even if she has to sell the New York house and all your china pots into the bargain ! "
77285	77306	77282	77282	his	120	" If that 's what you call saving me from her vengeance -- sending the crockery crashing round my ears ! "
77331	77344	77321	77321	he	120	" I suppose you 're going to the Hunt ball as Cassandra ? "
77812	77847	77848	77848	he	120	" I was stupid and disagreeable last night . I can never say what I want when I have to count the minutes , and I 've come back now for a quiet talk , "
77861	77865	77866	77866	she	3350	" About business ? "
77877	77887	77866	77866	she	3350	" Do n't let us give it that name ! "
77901	77922	77899	77899	his	120	" You used to call it our work -- won't you go back to that way of looking at it ? "
77929	77949	77899	77899	his	120	" I did n't know , then , that it was going to be the only thing you cared for---- "
77963	77986	77987	77987	he	120	" Some day I shall make you see how much my caring for it means my caring for you . But meanwhile , "
77990	78021	77987	77987	he	120	" wo n't you overcome your aversion to the subject , and bear with it as my work , if you no longer care to think of it as yours ? "
78053	78102	78103	78103	Amherst	170	" I know you think me stupid -- but wives are not usually expected to go into all the details of their husband 's business . I have told you to do whatever you wish at Westmore , and I ca n't see why that is not enough . "
78184	78279	78280	78280	Bessy	170	" I know that , among your friends , wives are not expected to interest themselves in their husbands ' work , and if the mills were mine I should try to conform to the custom , though I should always think it a pity that the questions that fill a man 's thoughts should be ruled out of his talk with his wife ; but as it is , I am only your representative at Westmore , and I do n't see how we can help having the subject come up between us . "
78477	78494	78463	78463	she	170	" I always expected that you would need a great deal more money than you thought . "
78505	78521	78463	78463	she	170	" But you see why ? You understand how the work has gone on growing-- ? "
78535	78544	78545	78545	she	3350	" I am not sure that I understand , "
78549	78567	78545	78545	she	3350	" but if another loan is necessary , of course I will sign the note for it . "
78677	78716	78671	78671	He	1853	" Another loan _ is _ necessary ; but if any proper provision is to be made for paying it back , your expenses will have to be cut down a good deal for the next few months . "
78725	78744	78671	78671	He	1853	" My expenses ? You seem to forget how much I 've had to cut them down already . "
78745	78771	78661	78661	she	3350	" The household bills certainly do n't show it . They are increasing steadily , and there have been some very heavy incidental payments lately . "
78772	78781	78671	78671	He	1853	" What do you mean by incidental payments ? "
78782	78795	78796	78796	She	3350	" Well , there was the pair of cobs you bought last month---- "
78808	78823	78796	78796	She	3350	" With only one motor , one must have more horses , of course . "
78824	78870	78871	78871	Bessy	170	" The stables seemed to me fairly full before . But if you required more horses , I do n't see why , at this particular moment , it was also necessary to buy a set of Chinese vases for twenty - five hundred dollars . "
78909	78958	78902	78902	she	3350	" I know you do n't care about such things ; but I had an exceptional chance of securing the vases at a low price -- they are really worth twice as much -- and Dick always wanted a set of Ming for the drawing - room mantelpiece . "
79042	79100	79026	79026	she	170	" I have left you perfectly free to do as you think best at the mills , but this perpetual discussion of my personal expenses is very unpleasant to me , as I am sure it must be to you , and in future I think it would be much better for us to have separate accounts . "
79101	79105	79106	79106	Amherst	170	" Separate accounts ? "
79112	79140	79106	79106	Amherst	170	" I should like my personal expenses to be under my own control again -- I have never been used to accounting for every penny I spend . "
79150	79186	79187	79187	Her	1860	" You are of course free to spend your money as you like -- and I thought you were doing so when you authorized me , last spring , to begin the changes at Westmore . "
79191	79208	79187	79187	Her	1860	" Do you reproach me for that ? I did n't understand ... you took advantage .... "
79209	79212	79213	79213	he	1861	" Oh ! "
79227	79242	79243	79243	Amherst	170	" It was my fault , of course -- I only wanted to please you---- "
79309	79401	79305	79305	him	1861	" I am willing to take any blame you think I deserve ; but it wo n't help us now to go back to the past . It is more important that we should come to an understanding about the future . If by keeping your personal account separate , you mean that you wish to resume control of your whole income , then you ought to understand that the improvements at the mills will have to be dropped at once , and things there go back to their old state . "
79410	79424	79402	79402	She	1860	" Oh , I should like never to hear of the mills again ! "
79434	79444	79445	79445	She	1860	" Am I to take that as your answer ? "
79455	79459	79460	79460	she	1860	" Of course , "
79463	79473	79460	79460	she	1860	" you will end by doing as you please . "
79590	79593	79594	79594	he	1861	" Bessy , "
79600	79609	79594	79594	he	1861	" do n't let us part in this way---- "
79622	79631	79632	79632	she	1860	" It is time to dress for church , "
79649	79653	79632	79632	she	1860	" For church ? "
79676	79680	79681	79681	she	1860	" You forget , "
79691	79708	79681	79681	she	1860	" that before we married I was in the habit of going to church every Sunday . "
79709	79726	79727	79727	he	1861	" Yes -- to be sure . Would you not like me to go with you ? "
79779	79791	79792	79792	she	170	" I much prefer that you should do what you like , "
79828	79836	79837	79837	he	1861	" That 's the end of it ! "
80300	80303	80299	80301	a " quitter	4272	" quitter . "
80583	80591	80564	80564	Justine	100	" But you will come back soon ? "
80592	80599	80600	80600	he	1861	" I shall certainly come back , "
80610	80623	80607	80607	he	1861	" I shall find you here ? You will remain at Lynbrook ? "
80642	80649	80636	80636	she	100	" Yes , I shall stay . "
80654	80670	80636	80636	she	100	" And you 'll write me if anything -- if Bessy should not be well ? "
80671	80677	80678	80678	she	100	" I will write you , "
80792	80820	80782	80782	Amherst	170	" I have succeeded in dispersing the people who are always keeping you and your wife apart ; now is your chance : come and take it . "

82742	83014	82736	82736	Amherst	170	" Oh , I do n't know -- I should love it all ! Think of the joy of skimming over half the earth -- seeing it born again out of darkness every morning ! Sometimes , when I 've been up all night with a patient , and have seen the world _ come back to me _ like that , I 've been almost mad with its beauty ; and then the thought that I 've never seen more than a little corner of it makes me feel as if I were chained . But I think if I had wings I should choose to be a house - swallow ; and then , after I 'd had my fill of wonders , I should come back to my familiar corner , and my house full of busy humdrum people , and fly low to warn them of rain , and wheel up high to show them it was good haying weather , and know what was going on in every room in the house , and every house in the village ; and all the while I should be hugging my wonderful big secret -- the secret of snow - plains and burning deserts , and coral islands and buried cities -- and should put it all into my chatter under the eaves , that the people in the house were always too busy to stop and listen to -- and when winter came I 'm sure I should hate to leave them , even to go back to my great Brazilian forests full of orchids and monkeys !

83218	83256	83257	83257	Her	100	" that the bird whose wings carry him farthest and show him the most wonderful things , is the one who always comes back to the eaves , and is happiest in the thick of everyday life ? "
83263	83269	83270	83270	he	1941	" It seems to me , "
83273	83293	83270	83270	he	1941	" that you 're like that yourself -- loving long flights , yet happiest in the thick of life . "
83301	83318	83294	83294	She	100	" So I imagine -- but then you see I 've never had the long flight ! "
83322	83395	83396	83396	She	100	" Ah , there it is -- one never knows -- one never says , _ This is the moment _ ! because , however good it is , it always seems the door to a better one beyond . Faust never said it till the end , when he 'd nothing left of all he began by thinking worth while ; and then , with what a difference it was said ! "
83399	83422	83396	83396	She	100	" Yes -- but it _ was _ the best , after all -- the moment in which he had nothing left .... "

In such matters , as you know , it has mercifully been decided that the husband 's attitude shall determine other people 's ; otherwise we should be deprived of the legitimate pleasure of slandering our neighbours .

88261	88269	88270	88270	she	3350	" Honour ? What an odd expression ! "

Heaven knows I 've never looked at another woman -- but , by my reading of our compact , I should n't be keeping faith with you if I did n't help you to keep faith with better things . And you owe me the same help -- the same chance to rise through you , and not sink by you -- else we 've betrayed each other more deeply than any adultery could make us ! "
88495	88652	88653	88653	He	2063	" You 'll say that what I 'm asking you is to give me back the free use of your money . Well ! Why not ? Is it so much for a wife to give ? I know you all think that a man who marries a rich woman forfeits his self - respect if he spends a penny without her approval . But that 's because money is so sacred to you all ! It seems to me the least important thing that a woman entrusts to her husband . What of her dreams and her hopes , her belief in justice and goodness and decency ? If he takes those and destroys them , he 'd better have had a mill - stone about his neck . But nobody has a word to say till he touches her dividends -- then he 's a calculating brute who has married her for her fortune ! "
88673	88703	88653	88653	He	2063	" Do n't you see that I ca n't go on in this way -- that I 've _ no right _ to let you keep me from Westmore ? "
88720	88771	88704	88704	Bessy	170	" I hardly know what you mean -- you use such peculiar words ; but I do n't see why you should expect me to give up all the ideas I was brought up in . Our standards _ are _ different -- but why should yours always be right ? "

88859	88907	88908	88908	Amherst	170	" It seems to me that should be a reason for your not asking me to make other sacrifices ! When I gave up Blanche I thought you would see that I wanted to please you -- and that you would do something for me in return .... "
88915	88944	88908	88908	Amherst	170	" Thank you for telling me your real reasons . I was fool enough to think you acted from conviction -- not that you were simply striking a bargain---- "

Do n't tell me that I do n't understand -- or that I 'm meddling in what does n't concern me . I do n't care a fig for that ! I 've always meddled in what did n't concern me -- I always shall , I suppose , till I die ! And I understand enough to know that Bessy is very unhappy -- and that you 're the wiser and stronger of the two . I know what it 's been to you to give up your work -- to feel yourself useless , "

92134	92141	92142	92142	Amherst	96	" But I do n't think , "
92146	92195	92142	92142	Amherst	96	" that anything can be said to convince me that I ought to alter my decision . These months of idleness have shown me that I 'm one of the members of society who are a danger to the community if their noses are not kept to the grindstone---- "

92238	92280	92232	92232	she	100	" But if you decide to go away for a time -- surely it ought to be in such a way that your going does not seem to cast any reflection on Bessy , or subject her to any unkind criticism . "
92292	92310	92311	92311	he	96	" I do n't think you need fear that -- I shall be the only one criticized , "
92315	92369	92311	92311	he	96	" Are you sure -- if you take such a position as you spoke of ? So few people understand the love of hard work for its own sake . They will say that your quarrel with your wife has driven you to support yourself -- and that will be cruel to Bessy . "
92375	92412	92413	92413	he	96	" They 'll be more likely to say I tried to play the gentleman and failed , and was n't happy till I got back to my own place in life -- which is true enough , "
92421	92484	92485	92485	she	2128	" They may say that too ; but they will make Bessy suffer first -- and it will be your fault if she is humiliated in that way . If you decide to take up your factory work for a time , ca n't you do so without -- without accepting a salary ? Oh , you see I stick at nothing , "
92494	92520	92485	92485	she	2128	" and Bessy has said things which make me see that she would suffer horribly if -- if you put such a slight on her . "
92531	92581	92526	92526	she	2128	" From Bessy 's standpoint it would mean a decisive break -- the repudiating of your whole past . And it is a question on which you can afford to be generous , because I know ... I think ... it 's less important in your eyes than hers .... "
92588	92598	92582	92582	Amherst	96	" That particular form of indebtedness , you mean ? "
92602	92623	92599	92599	She	2128	" The easiest to cancel , and therefore the least galling ; is n't that the way you regard it ? "

92668	92692	92693	92693	She	2128	" There 's my point ! To see their limitation is to allow for it , since every enlightenment brings a corresponding obligation . "

93583	93597	93537	93538	the butler	753	" Yes , sir , by motor -- to stay with Mrs. Carbury . "
93680	93689	93690	93691	The butler	753	" At what time did Mrs. Amherst leave ? "
93694	93712	93690	93691	The butler	753	" Sharp at four , sir . The maid took the three - forty with the luggage . "
93836	93845	93789	93790	The butler	753	" Did Mrs. Amherst receive my telephone message ? "
93846	93858	93865	93869	a well - bred man	2161	" Yes , sir . I gave it to her myself . "
93973	93982	93983	93983	he	2149	" My letters are here , I suppose ? "
94015	94027	94001	94001	he	2149	" She has left a line -- there will be some explanation---- "
95400	95431	95384	95384	Justine	100	" You do n't look as well as when I went away , Bessy . Are you sure you 've done wisely in beginning your house - parties so soon ? "
95462	95499	95448	95448	she	100	" I am quite well , on the contrary ; but I was dying of inanition in this big empty house , and I suppose I have n't got the boredom out of my system yet ! "
95510	95519	95520	95520	she	100	" Even if you _ were _ bored , "
95523	95545	95546	95546	She	100	" the inanition was probably good for you . What does Dr. Wyant say to your breaking away from his regime ? "
95586	95608	95579	95580	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Oh , I have n't seen Dr. Wyant lately . His interest in me died out the day you left . "
95634	95674	95675	95675	Bessy	170	" Do n't be a goose , Bessy . If he has n't come , it must be because you 've told him not to -- because you 're afraid of letting him see that you 're disobeying him . "
95679	95751	95675	95675	Bessy	170	" My dear , I 'm afraid of nothing -- nothing ! Not even of your big eyes when they glare at me like coals . I suppose you must have looked at poor Wyant like that to frighten him away ! And yet the last time we talked of him you seemed to like him -- you even hinted that it was because of him that Westy had no chance . "
95758	95789	95752	95752	Justine	100	" If neither of them existed it would n't affect the other 's chances in the least . Their only merit is that they both enhance the charms of celibacy ! "
95805	95822	95796	95796	she	170	" Ah , most men do that -- you're so clever to have found it out ! "
95831	95854	95825	95825	Justine	100	" Oh , but I haven't -- as a generalization . I mean to marry as soon as I get the chance ! "
95855	95859	95796	95796	she	170	" The chance---- ? "
95860	95878	95879	95880	Mrs. Amherst	117	" To meet the right man . I 'm gambler enough to believe in my luck yet ! "
95884	95940	95879	95880	Mrs. Amherst	117	" There _ is _ no right man ! As Blanche says , matrimony 's as uncomfortable as a ready - made shoe . How can one and the same institution fit every individual case ? And why should we all have to go lame because marriage was once invented to suit an imaginary case ? "
95947	95984	95985	95985	She	100	" You talk of walking lame -- how else do we all walk ? It seems to me that life 's the tight boot , and marriage the crutch that may help one to hobble along ! "
95997	96058	96059	96059	She	100	" When you philosophize I always know you 're tired . No one who feels well stops to generalize about symptoms . If you wo n't let your doctor prescribe for you , your nurse is going to carry out his orders . What you want is quiet . Be reasonable and send away everybody before Mr. Amherst comes back ! "
96089	96111	96059	96059	She	100	" Thanks for your advice . It would be excellent but for one thing -- my husband is not coming back ! "
96168	96180	96135	96135	Justine	100	" Bessy ! What do you mean by not coming back ? "
96181	96211	96217	96218	Blanche Carbury	180	" I mean he 's had the tact to see that we shall be more comfortable apart -- without putting me to the unpleasant necessity of telling him so . "
96273	96281	96282	96282	she	100	" Please tell me what has happened , "
96297	96322	96287	96287	Bessy	170	" John has gone back to the life he prefers -- which I take to be a hint to me to do the same . "
96338	96385	96386	96386	She	100	" Bessy -- I ought to tell you that I saw Mr. Amherst in town the day I went to Philadelphia . He spoke of going away for a time ... he seemed unhappy ... but he told me he was coming back to see you first-- "
96418	96424	96425	96425	she	100	" Surely he came back ? "
96429	96438	96425	96425	she	100	" Oh , yes -- he came back ! "
96471	96477	96454	96454	she	100	" Well -- and then ? "
96478	96491	96454	96454	she	100	" Then -- nothing ! I was not here when he came . "
96492	96502	96454	96454	she	100	" You were not here ? What had happened ? "
96503	96542	96543	96543	Justine	100	" I had gone over to Blanche Carbury 's for a day or two . I was just leaving when I heard he was coming back , and I could n't throw her over at the last moment . "
96557	96576	96543	96543	Justine	100	" You knew he was coming -- and you chose that time to go to Mrs. Carbury 's ? "
96577	96630	96454	96454	she	100	" I did n't choose , my dear -- it just happened ! And it really happened for the best . I suppose he was annoyed at my going -- you know he has a ridiculous prejudice against Blanche -- and so the next morning he rushed off to his cotton mill . "
96657	96677	96654	96654	Justine	100	" Did Mr. Amherst know that you knew he was coming back before you left for Mrs. Carbury 's ? "
96685	96696	96697	96697	she	170	" Did he know that I knew that he knew ? "
96700	96712	96697	96697	she	170	" Yes -- I suppose so -- he must have known . "
96727	96736	96719	96719	she	100	" Then he took that as your answer ? "
96737	96741	96763	96763	Bessy	170	" My answer---- ? "
96742	96747	96719	96719	she	100	" To his coming back---- "
96748	96762	96763	96763	Bessy	170	" So it appears . I told you he had shown unusual tact . "
96783	96814	96815	96815	She	170	" But it 's almost morning -- it 's wicked of me to have kept you so late , when you must be up to look after all those people ! "
96837	96871	96872	96872	she	170	" Do n't look at me with those big eyes -- they've eaten up the whole of your face ! And you need n't think I 'm sorry for what I 've done , "
96875	96891	96872	96872	she	170	" I 'm _ not_--the -- least -- little -- atom -- of a bit ! "
97485	97494	97495	97496	Blanche Carbury	180	" Why not build a squash - court ? "
97845	97861	97862	97863	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Shall we sit by the fire ? I am glad to find you alone , "
97903	97937	97886	97886	she	178	" I have been rather suddenly asked by an invalid cousin to go to Europe with her next week , and I ca n't go contentedly without being at peace about our friends . "
98052	98076	98042	98043	the latter	673	" I am the more concerned because I believe I must hold myself , in a small degree , responsible for Bessy 's marriage-- "
98090	98111	98087	98087	she	100	" I thought she could never be happy unless her affections were satisfied -- and even now I believe so . "
98112	98118	98119	98119	Justine	100	" I believe so too , "
98134	98147	98148	98150	the older woman	1491	" Well , then -- since we are agreed in our diagnosis , "
98156	98172	98148	98150	the older woman	1491	" what remedy do you suggest ? Or rather , how can we administer it ? "
98173	98177	98178	98178	Justine	100	" What remedy ? "
98181	98206	98207	98207	She	100	" Oh , I believe we are agreed on that too . Mr. Amherst must be brought back -- but how to bring him ? "
98222	98251	98207	98207	She	100	" I ask you , because I believe you to be the only one of Bessy 's friends who is in the least in her husband 's confidence . "
98300	98325	98326	98326	Justine	100	" Bessy has spoken to me once or twice -- but I know very little of Mr. Amherst 's point of view ; except , "
98337	98354	98326	98326	Justine	100	" that I believe he suffers most from being cut off from his work at Westmore . "
98355	98400	98401	98401	Justine	100	" Yes -- so I think ; but that is a difficulty that time and expediency must adjust . All _ we _ can do -- their friends , I mean -- is to get them together again before the breach is too wide . "
98515	98526	98527	98527	Justine	100	" I really know very little of the present situation , "
98535	98557	98527	98527	Justine	100	" Bessy merely told me that Mr. Amherst had taken up his old work in a cotton mill in the south . "
98608	98617	98618	98618	she	100	" Ah -- I hoped you knew more , "
98622	98679	98618	98618	she	100	" for , like you , I have only heard from Bessy that her husband went away suddenly to help a friend who is reorganizing some mills in Georgia . Of course , under the circumstances , such a temporary break is natural enough -- perhaps inevitable -- only he must not stay away too long . "
98768	98777	98778	98778	He	96	" I will remember all you have said . "
98877	98883	98884	98885	Mrs. Ansell	178	" I am not sure , "
98893	98924	98925	98925	She	178	" that I think it unwise of him to have gone ; but if he stays too long Bessy may listen to bad advice -- advice disastrous to her happiness . "
98937	98944	98945	98945	she	178	" As far as I know , "
98956	98968	98945	98945	she	178	" you are the only person who can tell him this . "
98969	98972	98974	98974	Justine	100	" I ? "
98995	99050	98986	98987	Mrs. Ansell	178	" My dear Miss Brent , Bessy has told me something of the wise counsels you have given her . Mr. Amherst is also your friend . As I said just now , you are the only person who might act as a link between them -- surely you will not renounce the role . "
99055	99081	99053	99053	herself	100	" My only role , as you call it , has been to urge Bessy to -- to try to allow for her husband 's views---- "
99082	99095	99099	99101	the two women	808	" And have you not given the same advice to Mr. Amherst ? "
99104	99107	99109	99109	Justine	100	" Yes , "
99115	99128	99109	99109	Justine	100	" Then why refuse your help now ? The moment is crucial . "
99166	99189	99190	99191	Mrs. Ansell	178	" I put it to you as one old friend to another -- will you write to Mr. Amherst to come back ? "
99236	99239	99240	99240	she	100	" No , "
99244	99249	99240	99240	she	100	" I can not . "
99250	99263	99270	99270	she	178	" You can not ? With a friend 's happiness in extremity ? "
99273	99284	99270	99270	she	178	" Unless you believe that Bessy would be happier divorced ? "
99285	99292	99293	99293	Justine	100	" Divorced-- ? Oh , no , "
99296	99305	99270	99270	she	178	" That is what it will come to . "
99306	99313	99270	99270	she	178	" No , no ! In time---- "
99314	99331	99332	99332	Justine	100	" Time is what I am most afraid of , when Blanche Carbury disposes of it . "
99338	99343	99332	99332	Justine	100	" You 'll write ? "
99356	99364	99344	99345	Mrs. Ansell	178	" I have not the influence you think---- "
99365	99374	99344	99345	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Can you do any harm by trying ? "
99375	99378	99379	99379	Justine	100	" I might-- "
99392	99395	99396	99397	the other	736	" Ah , "
99401	99416	99396	99397	the other	736	" then you _ have _ influence ! Why will you not use it ? "
99430	99452	99396	99397	the other	736	" If I have any influence , I am not sure it would be well to use it as you suggest . "
99453	99462	99479	99480	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Not to urge Mr. Amherst 's return ? "
99463	99469	99470	99470	She	100	" No -- not now . "
99489	99497	99498	99499	Mrs. Ansell	178	" It must be now or never , "
99502	99509	99510	99510	Justine	100	" I ca n't think so , "
99514	99521	99510	99510	Justine	100	" Nevertheless -- will you try ? "
99522	99532	99560	99561	Mrs. Ansell	178	" No -- no ! It might be fatal . "
99533	99537	99560	99561	Mrs. Ansell	178	" To whom ? "
99538	99542	99543	99543	She	100	" To both . "
99546	99559	99543	99543	She	100	" If he came back now I know he would not stay . "
99567	99579	99560	99561	Mrs. Ansell	178	" You _ know _ ? Then you speak with authority ? "

99605	99615	99616	99616	She	1491	" Ah -- then you shoulder a great responsibility ! "

101991	102195	101986	101987	my wife	3819	" Latent under Justine 's acute consciousness of what this letter meant , was the sense of Bessy 's inferences and conjectures . She could feel them actually piercing the page in her hand like some hypersensitive visual organ to which matter offers no obstruction . Or rather , baffled in their endeavour , they were evoking out of the unseen , heaven knew what fantastic structure of intrigue -- scrawling over the innocent page with burning evidences of perfidy and collusion .... One thing became instantly clear to her : she must show the letter to Bessy . She ran her eyes over it again , trying to disentangle the consequences . There was the allusion to their talk in town -- well , she had told Bessy of that ! But the careless reference to their woodland excursions -- what might not Bessy , in her present mood , make of it ? Justine 's uppermost thought was of distress at the failure of her plan . Perhaps she might still have induced Amherst to come back , had it not been for this accident ; but now that hope was destroyed . She raised her eyes and met Bessy 's . "
102201	102293	102197	102197	you	2333	" she said , holding out the letter . Bessy received it with lifted brows , and a protesting murmur -- but as she read , Justine saw the blood mount under her clear skin , invade the temples , the nape , even the little flower - like ears ; then it receded as suddenly , ebbing at last from the very lips , so that the smile with which she looked up from her reading was as white as if she had been under the stress of physical pain .

It was her rare gift , at such moments , to forget her own relation to the person for whose fate she was concerned , to cast aside all consciousness of criticism and distrust in the heart she strove to reach , as pitiful people forget their physical timidity in the attempt to help a wounded animal . For a moment Bessy seemed to waver . The colour flickered faintly up her cheek , her long lashes drooped -- she had the tenderest lids!--and all her face seemed melting under the beams of Justine 's ardour . But the letter was still in her hand -- her eyes , in sinking , fell upon it , and she sounded beneath her breath the fatal phrase : "

111199	111257	111108	111108	she	100	" I understand your feeling -- but you need have no doubt . Human life is sacred , and the fact that , even in this materialistic age , science is continually struggling to preserve and prolong it , shows -- very beautifully , I think -- how all things work together to fulfill the divine will .

111258	111281	111108	111108	she	100	" Then you believe that the divine will delights in mere pain -- mere meaningless animal suffering -- for its own sake ? "

But where the body has been crushed to a pulp , and the mind is no more than a machine for the registering of sense - impressions of physical anguish , of what use can such suffering be to its owner -- or to the divine will ? "
111405	111427	111428	111428	Justine	100	" There , Miss Brent , we touch on inscrutable things , and human reason must leave the answer to faith . "

113591	113614	113615	113615	He	125	" No , I do n't , sir ; because the case , as I see it , presents certain definite indications . "
113679	113701	113667	113668	Mr. Tredegar	125	" Then , today even , you believe not only in the possibility of prolonging life , but of ultimate recovery ? "
113705	113721	113702	113702	Wyant	165	" I wo n't call it recovery -- today . Say -- life indefinitely prolonged . "
113722	113727	113667	113668	Mr. Tredegar	125	" And the paralysis ? "
113728	113743	113667	113668	Mr. Tredegar	125	" It might disappear -- after a few months -- or a few years . "
113744	113752	113702	113702	Wyant	165	" Such an outcome would be unusual ? "
113753	113775	113667	113668	Mr. Tredegar	125	" Exceptional . But then there _ are _ exceptions . And I 'm straining every nerve to make this one ! "
113776	113792	113667	113668	Mr. Tredegar	125	" And the suffering -- such as today 's , for instance -- is unavoidable ? "
113793	113796	113702	113702	Wyant	165	" Unhappily . "
113797	113803	113667	113668	Mr. Tredegar	125	" And bound to increase ? "
113804	113814	113667	113668	Mr. Tredegar	125	" Well -- as the anaesthetics lose their effect .... "
113854	113868	113848	113848	He	125	" That young fellow seems sure of himself . You believe in him ? "
113872	113884	113848	113848	He	125	" Not in his expectation of recovery -- no one does . "
113885	113904	113848	113848	He	125	" But you think they can keep the poor child alive till Langhope and her husband get back ? "
113916	113925	113913	113913	Justine	100	" It can be done ... I think .... "
113926	113933	113935	113936	Mr. Tredegar	125	" Yes -- it 's horrible , "
113990	113999	113984	113984	she	100	" These new devices for keeping people alive , "
114004	114013	114000	114001	Mr. Tredegar	125	" they increase the suffering besides prolonging it ? "
114014	114021	113973	113973	Her	100	" Yes -- in some cases . "
114022	114027	114000	114001	Mr. Tredegar	125	" In this case ? "
114028	114034	114035	114036	The lawyer	520	" I am afraid so . "
114054	114064	114065	114065	he	520	" I wish to God she had been killed ! "
114079	114084	114068	114068	Justine	100	" Oh , yes ! "
114085	114098	114070	114070	her	100	" It 's infernal -- the time they can make it last . "
114099	114104	114105	114105	Justine	100	" It 's useless ! "
114109	114112	114113	114113	He	125	" Useless ? "
114121	114135	114115	114115	his	125	" Well , that 's beside the point -- since it 's inevitable . "
114161	114165	114142	114142	his	125	" Why inevitable ? "
114205	114211	114212	114212	he	125	" Human life is sacred , "
114216	114232	114233	114233	Justine	100	" Ah , that must have been decreed by some one who had never suffered ! "
114264	114273	114274	114274	he	125	" Society decreed it -- not one person , "
114277	114284	114285	114285	she	100	" Society -- science -- religion ! "
114293	114342	114285	114285	she	100	" Precisely . It 's the universal consensus -- the result of the world 's accumulated experience . Cruel in individual instances -- necessary for the general welfare . Of course your training has taught you all this ; but I can understand that at such a time .... "
114343	114346	114347	114347	she	100	" Yes , "
114831	114849	114850	114850	Wyant	165	" Yes -- I say it can be done : tonight I say it more than ever , "
114878	114932	114933	114933	He	165	" I say the way the heart has rallied proves that we 've got more strength to draw on than any of them have been willing to admit . The breathing 's better too . If we can fight off the degenerative processes -- and , by George , I believe we can ! "
114940	114973	114933	114933	He	165	" With you to work with , I believe I could do anything . How you do back a man up ! You think with your hands -- with every individual finger ! "
115089	115096	115097	115097	she	100	" Why do you do it ? "
115117	115121	115100	115100	He	165	" Do what ? "
115122	115135	115100	115100	He	165	" It 's so useless ... you all know she must die . "
115136	115154	115155	115155	He	165	" I know nothing of the kind ... and even the others are not so sure today . "
115221	115229	115230	115230	he	165	" Well -- don't you believe me ? "
115237	115248	115230	115230	he	165	" I do n't know ... I ca n't tell .... "
115249	115280	115215	115215	he	165	" But as long as there 's a doubt , even -- a doubt my way -- and I 'll show you there is , if you 'll give me time---- "
115281	115286	115287	115287	she	100	" How much time ? "
115295	115370	115287	115287	she	100	" Ah -- that depends on ourselves : on you and me chiefly . That 's what Garford admits . _ They _ ca n't do much now -- they've got to leave the game to us . It 's a question of incessant vigilance ... of utilizing every hour , every moment .... Time 's all I ask , and _ you _ can give it to me , if any one can ! "
115389	115397	115377	115377	Justine	100	" Ah , do n't ask me ! "
115398	115404	115377	115377	Justine	100	" Do n't ask you---- ? "
115405	115413	115414	115414	Wyant	165	" I can't -- I ca n't . "
115426	115432	115414	115414	Wyant	165	" You ca n't what-- ? "
115496	115507	115508	115508	she	100	" I can't ... talk of it ... any longer , "
115570	115577	115578	115578	he	165	" You 're over - tired , "
115582	115607	115578	115578	he	165	" Take tonight to rest . Miss Mace can replace you for the next few hours -- and I may need you more tomorrow . "
115719	115725	115708	115708	she	100	" I want to die , "
116159	116167	116153	116153	Justine	100	" She is beginning to suffer terribly . "
116198	116206	116168	116168	He	95	" We are doing all we can . "
116207	116210	116211	116211	She	100	" Yes . "
116225	116231	116217	116217	her	100	" Is there any hope ? "
116243	116283	116217	116217	her	100	" The next ten days will tell -- the fight is on , as Wyant says . And if any one can do it , that young fellow can . There 's stuff in him -- and infernal ambition . "
116284	116297	116349	116349	he	95	" Yes : but do _ you _ believe she can live-- ? "
116320	116326	116327	116327	he	95	" My dear Miss Brent , "
116330	116347	116327	116327	he	95	" I have reached the age when one always leaves a door open to the unexpected . "
116418	116423	116424	116424	he	95	" Hello , Wyant ? "
116427	116431	116433	116433	Wyant	165	" Line busy , "
116507	116518	116519	116519	he	165	" You know you 're taking a chance from her , "
116525	116529	116530	116530	He	165	" Oh , no---- "
116536	116545	116530	116530	He	165	" You do n't feel up to it ? "
116546	116549	116550	116550	He	165	" No . "

117404	117460	117461	117461	She	100	" There has been a motor accident beyond Clifton , and I have been sent for . I think I can safely be away for two or three hours , but ring me up at Clifton if you want me . Miss Mace has instructions , and Garford 's assistant will be down at seven . "
117554	117559	117560	117560	she	100	" You 're ill ! "

118749	118755	118695	118695	he	165	" What had you done ? "
118756	118764	118695	118695	he	165	" Nothing -- there was no time . "
118765	118769	118770	118770	He	165	" No time ? "

118800	118810	118797	118797	he	165	" It came suddenly . I was going to call---- "
118874	118896	118897	118897	he	165	" This has been too much for you -- go and send one of the others .... It 's all over , "

119609	119622	119606	119606	Amherst	117	" I should have been sorry if Cicely had not been here . "
119623	119630	119631	119632	his mother	396	" Mr. Langhope is coming too , "
119635	119644	119631	119632	his mother	396	" I 'm glad of that , John . "
119645	119648	119649	119649	Amherst	99	" Yes , "
119830	119839	119840	119841	Mrs. Amherst	117	" I am glad Mr. Langhope is coming , "
119851	119870	119871	119871	She	117	" It shows , dear -- doesn't it?--that he 's really gratified -- that he appreciates your motive .... "
119953	119965	119966	119966	he	99	" It shows -- well , yes -- what you say ! "
120104	120133	120099	120100	His mother	396	" You 're going back to the mills at once ? I wanted to consult you about the rooms . Miss Brent had better be next to Cicely ? "

120218	120231	120233	120234	Mrs. Dressel	118	" I 'm so delighted to hear that you 're expecting Justine , "
120246	120254	120255	120256	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Ah , you 've heard too ? "
120279	120329	120255	120256	Mrs. Amherst	117	" I had n't till this moment ; in fact I flew in to ask for news , and on the door - step there was such a striking - looking young man enquiring for her , and I heard the parlour - maid say she was arriving tomorrow . "
120330	120342	120255	120256	Mrs. Amherst	117	" A young man ? Some one you did n't know ? "
120375	120408	120368	120368	her	117	" Oh , no -- I'm sure he was a stranger . Extremely slight and pale , with remarkable eyes . He was so disappointed -- he seemed sure of finding her . "
120409	120427	120429	120430	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Well , no doubt he 'll come back tomorrow.--You know we 're expecting the whole party , "
120453	120460	120445	120446	Mrs. Dressel	118	" Really ? Mr. Langhope too ? "
120461	120473	120368	120368	her	117	" Yes . It 's a great pleasure to my son . "
120474	120503	120504	120505	Mrs. Amherst	117	" It must be ! I 'm so glad . I suppose in a way it will be rather sad for Mr. Langhope -- seeing everything here so unchanged---- "
120511	120522	120523	120523	she	117	" I think he will prefer to find it so , "
120534	120551	120523	120523	she	117	" Oh , I do n't know . They were never very fond of this house . "
120657	120701	120646	120646	she	118	" Dear Mrs. Amherst -- you know I ca n't help saying what I think -- and I 've so often wondered why you do n't do this room over . With these high ceilings you could do something lovely in Louis Seize . "
120712	120728	120729	120729	she	118	" I do n't think my son would ever care to make any changes here , "
120732	120759	120729	120729	she	118	" Oh , I understand his feeling ; but when he begins to entertain -- and you know poor Bessy always _ hated _ this furniture . "
120765	120771	120772	120772	she	118	" Perhaps if he marries again-- "
120813	120833	120793	120793	she	118	" _ Marries again ? _ Why -- you do n't mean-- ? He does n't think of it ? "
120834	120844	120845	120846	her hostess	2720	" Not in the least -- I spoke figuratively , "
120852	120887	120888	120889	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Oh , of course -- I see . He really _ could n't _ marry , could he ? I mean , it would be so wrong to Cicely -- under the circumstances . "
120964	120995	120996	120996	she	117	" I had not thought of it in that light -- but it 's really of no consequence how one looks at a thing that is not going to happen , "
121000	121023	120996	120996	she	117	" No -- naturally ; I see you were only joking . He 's so devoted to Cicely , is n't he ? "
121043	121053	121054	121054	he	2722	" I 'm afraid I must be off , mother-- "
121071	121103	121104	121105	Mrs. Dressel	118	" Oh , Mr. Amherst , how d'you do ? I suppose you 're very busy about tomorrow ? I just flew in to find out if Justine was really coming , "
121125	121135	121136	121136	Amherst	96	" I believe my mother expects the whole party , "
121152	121175	121176	121177	Mrs. Dressel	118	" How delightful ! And it 's so nice to think that Mr. Langhope 's arrangement with Justine still works so well , "
121198	121214	121215	121216	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Mr. Langhope is lucky in having persuaded Miss Brent to take charge of Cicely , "
121220	121258	121215	121216	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Yes -- and it was so lucky for Justine too ! When she came back from Europe with us last autumn , I could see she simply hated the idea of taking up her nursing again . "
121273	121310	121259	121259	Amherst	96	" Ah , she was tired , poor child ; but I 'm only afraid that , after the summer 's rest , she may want some more active occupation than looking after a little girl . "
121311	121339	121340	121341	Mrs. Amherst	117	" Oh , I think not -- she 's so fond of Cicely . And of course it 's everything to her to have a comfortable home . "
121344	121355	121340	121341	Mrs. Amherst	117	" At her age , it 's not always everything . "
121361	121381	121382	121382	she	118	" Oh , Justine 's twenty - seven , you know ; she 's not likely to marry now , "
121407	121446	121395	121395	She	118	" You must be so busy preparing for the great day ... if only it does n't rain ! ... No , _ please _ , Mr. Amherst ! ... It 's a mere step -- I'm walking .... "
122437	122452	122432	122433	Mrs. Dressel	118	" Justine is twenty - seven -- she 's not likely to marry now . "

123948	123980	123981	123981	She	97	" Thank you so much ; but there 's some one here I want to see first -- one of the operatives -- and I can easily take a Hanaford car . "

124102	124116	124117	124117	she	100	" I do want to see the Dillons -- how did you guess ? "
124129	124141	124117	124117	she	100	" For the same reason that made you think of them . "
124175	124202	124203	124203	he	96	" I suppose I 'm rather self - conscious about the Dillons , because they 're one of my object lessons -- they illustrate the text , "

127669	127683	127684	127684	he	120	" As if any good governess could n't have done that for me ! "

127807	127865	127790	127791	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Mr. Amherst , as a father , will take a more conservative view of his duties . Every one agrees that , in spite of his theories , he has a good head for business ; and whatever he does at Westmore for the advantage of his children will naturally be for Cicely 's advantage too .

127873	127882	127883	127883	he	120	" There 's something in what you say , "
127889	127920	127883	127883	he	120	" But it does n't alter the fact that , with Amherst unmarried , the whole of the Westmore fortune would have gone back to Cicely -- where it belongs . "
127921	127935	127790	127791	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Possibly . But it was so unlikely that he would remain unmarried . "
127936	127958	127790	127791	Mrs. Ansell	178	" I do n't see why ! A man of honour would have felt bound to keep the money for Cicely . "
127959	127982	127883	127883	he	120	" But you must remember that , from Mr. Amherst 's standpoint , the money belongs rather to Westmore than to Cicely . "
127983	127994	127790	127791	Mrs. Ansell	178	" He 's no better than a socialist , then ! "
127995	128014	127790	127791	Mrs. Ansell	178	" Well -- supposing he is n't : the birth of a son and heir will cure that . "
128024	128034	128020	128020	she	178	" It 's really safer for Cicely as it is-- "
128052	128091	128044	128044	himself	120	" Well , since he had n't the decency to remain single , I 'm thankful he has n't inflicted a stranger on us ; and I shall never forget what Miss Brent did for my poor Bessy .... "

129310	129319	129299	129299	she	100	" But why should not Cicely come here ? "
129320	129343	129227	129227	she	100	" If Mr. Langhope is cut off from his usual amusements , I 'm afraid that would only make him more lonely . "

129518	129528	129529	129529	she	100	" Then you feel they _ are _ jealous ? "

My wife was confined three weeks ago , and has been desperately ill ever since . She is in no state to move , but we shall be put out of these rooms unless I can get money or work at once . A word from you would have given me a start in New York -- and I 'd be willing to begin again as an interne or a doctor 's assistant . "
131372	131417	131361	131361	You	2964	" Justine laid down the letter and looked up . Her eyes rested on her own reflection in the glass , and it frightened her . She sat motionless , with a thickly - beating heart , one hand clenched on the letter . _ "
131433	131518	131420	131420	you	2964	" _ That was what his importunity meant , then ! She had been paying blackmail all this time .... Somewhere , from the first , in an obscure fold of consciousness , she had felt the stir of an unnamed , unacknowledged fear ; and now the fear raised its head and looked at her . Well ! She would look back at it , then : look it straight in the malignant eye . What was it , after all , but a "
131522	132284	131420	131420	you	2964	children"--the ghost of the opinion of the many ? She had suspected from the first that Wyant knew of her having shortened the term of Bessy Amherst 's sufferings -- returning to the room when he did , it was almost impossible that he should not have guessed what had happened ; and his silence had made her believe that he understood her motive and approved it . But , supposing she had been mistaken , she still had nothing to fear , since she had done nothing that her own conscience condemned . If the act were to do again she would do it -- she had never known a moment 's regret ! Suddenly she heard Amherst 's step in the passage -- heard him laughing and talking as he chased Cicely up the stairs to the nursery . _ If she was not afraid , why had she never told Amherst ? _ Why , the answer to that was simple enough ! She had not told him _ because she was not afraid _ . From the first she had retained sufficient detachment to view her act impartially , to find it completely justified by circumstances , and to decide that , since those circumstances could be but partly and indirectly known to her husband , she not only had the right to keep her own counsel , but was actually under a kind of obligation not to force on him the knowledge of a fact that he could not alter and could not completely judge .... Was there any flaw in this line of reasoning ? Did it not show a deliberate weighing of conditions , a perfect rectitude of intention ? And , after all , she had had Amherst 's virtual consent to her act ! She knew his feelings on such matters -- his independence of traditional judgments , his horror of inflicting needless pain -- she was as sure of his intellectual assent as of her own . She was even sure that , when she told him , he would appreciate her reasons for not telling him before .... For now of course he must know everything -- this horrible letter made it inevitable . She regretted that she had decided , though for the best of reasons , not to speak to him of her own accord ; for it was intolerable that he should think of any external pressure as having brought her to avowal . But no ! he would not think that . The understanding between them was so complete that no deceptive array of circumstances could ever make her motives obscure to him . She let herself rest a moment in the thought .... Presently she heard him moving in the next room -- he had come back to dress for dinner . She would go to him now , at once -- she could not bear this weight on her mind the whole evening . She pushed back her chair , crumpling the letter in her hand ; but as she did so , her eyes again fell on her reflection . She could not go to her husband with such a face ! If she was not afraid , why did she look like that ? Well -- she was afraid ! It would be easier and simpler to admit it . She was afraid -- afraid for the first time -- afraid for her own happiness ! She had had just eight months of happiness -- it was horrible to think of losing it so soon .... Losing it ? But why should she lose it ? The letter must have affected her brain ... all her thoughts were in a blur of fear .... Fear of what ? Of the man who understood her as no one else understood her ? The man to whose wisdom and mercy she trusted as the believer trusts in God ? This was a kind of abominable nightmare -- even Amherst 's image had been distorted in her mind ! The only way to clear her brain , to recover the normal sense of things , was to go to him now , at once , to feel his arms about her , to let his kiss dispel her fears .... She rose with a long breath of relief . She had to cross the length of the room to reach his door , and when she had gone half - way she heard him knock . "

132313	132509	132286	132286	I	0	" she answered ; and as she did so , she turned and dropped Wyant 's letter into the fire . Her hand had crushed it into a little ball , and she saw the flames spring up and swallow it before her husband entered . It was not that she had changed her mind -- she still meant to tell him everything . But to hold the letter was like holding a venomous snake -- she wanted to exterminate it , to forget that she had ever seen the blotted repulsive characters . And she could not bear to have Amherst 's eyes rest on it , to have him know that any man had dared to write to her in that tone . What vile meanings might not be read between Wyant 's phrases ? She had a right to tell the story in her own way -- the true way .... As Amherst approached , in his evening clothes , the heavy locks smoothed from his forehead , a flower of Cicely 's giving in his button - hole , she thought she had never seen him look so kind and handsome .

Nothing remained of it -- no , nothing . But suppose it was against herself that his anger turned ? The idea was preposterous , yet she trembled at it . It was clear that she must say _ something _ at once -- must somehow account for her agitation . But the sense that she was unnerved -- no longer in control of her face , her voice -- made her feel that she would tell her story badly if she told it now .... Had she not the right to gain a respite , to choose her own hour ? Weakness -- weakness again ! Every delay would only increase the phantom terror . Now , _ now_--with her head on his breast ! She turned toward him and began to speak impulsively . "

She felt the touch of a narcotic in her veins . How calm and peaceful the room was -- and how delicious to think that her life would go on in it , safely and peacefully , in the old familiar way ! As she swept up her hair , passing the comb through it , and flinging it dexterously over her lifted wrist , she heard Amherst cross the floor behind her , and pause to lay something on her writing - table . "
133435	133680	133433	133433	you	120	" she murmured again , lowering her head as he passed . When the door had closed on him she thrust the last pin into her hair , dashed some drops of Cologne on her face , and went over to the writing - table . As she picked up the cheque she saw it was for three hundred dollars . XXXIV ONCE or twice , in the days that followed , Justine found herself thinking that she had never known happiness before . The old state of secure well - being seemed now like a dreamless sleep ; but this new bliss , on its sharp pinnacle ringed with fire -- this thrilling conscious joy , daily and hourly snatched from fear -- this was living , not sleeping ! Wyant acknowledged her gift with profuse , almost servile thanks . She had sent it without a word -- saying to herself that pity for his situation made it possible to ignore his baseness . And the days went on as before . She was not conscious of any change , save in the heightened , almost artificial quality of her happiness , till one day in March , when Mr. Langhope announced that he was going for two or three weeks to a friend 's shooting - box in the south . The anniversary of Bessy 's death was approaching , and Justine knew that at that time he always absented himself . "
133739	133782	133724	133724	She	167	" This was a great concession on Mr. Langhope 's part , and Justine saw the pleasure in her husband 's face . It was the first time that his father - in - law had suggested Cicely 's going to Hanaford . "

133844	134423	134424	134425	A gentleman	4571	" It was nearly three months since Justine had left Hanaford -- and now she was to return there alone with her husband ! There would be hours , of course , when the child 's presence was between them -- or when , again , his work would keep him at the mills . But in the evenings , when Cicely was in bed -- when he and she sat alone , together in the Westmore drawing - room -- in Bessy 's drawing - room ! ... No -- she must find some excuse for remaining away till she had again grown used to the idea of being alone with Amherst . Every day she was growing a little more used to it ; but it would take time -- time , and the full assurance that Wyant was silenced . Till then she could not go back to Hanaford . She found a pretext in her own health . She pleaded that she was a little tired , below par ... and to return to Hanaford meant returning to hard work ; with the best will in the world she could not be idle there . Might she not , she suggested , take Cicely to Tuxedo or Lakewood , and thus get quite away from household cares and good works ? The pretext rang hollow -- it was so unlike her ! She saw Amherst 's eyes rest anxiously on her as Mr. Langhope uttered his prompt assent . Certainly she did look tired -- Mr. Langhope himself had noticed it . Had he perhaps over - taxed her energies , left the household too entirely on her shoulders ? Oh , no -- it was only the New York air ... like Cicely , she pined for a breath of the woods .... And so , the day Mr. Langhope left , she and Cicely were packed off to Lakewood . They stayed there a week : then a fit of restlessness drove Justine back to town . She found an excuse in the constant rain -- it was really useless , as she wrote Mr. Langhope , to keep the child imprisoned in an over - heated hotel while they could get no benefit from the outdoor life . In reality , she found the long lonely hours unendurable . She pined for a sight of her husband , and thought of committing Cicely to Mrs. Ansell 's care , and making a sudden dash for Hanaford . But the vision of the long evenings in the Westmore drawing - room again restrained her . No -- she would simply go back to New York , dine out occasionally , go to a concert or two , trust to the usual demands of town life to crowd her hours with small activities .... And in another week Mr. Langhope would be back and the days would resume their normal course . On arriving , she looked feverishly through the letters in the hall . None from Wyant -- that fear was allayed ! Every day added to her reassurance . By this time , no doubt , he was on his feet again , and ashamed -- unutterably ashamed -- of the threat that despair had wrung from him . She felt almost sure that his shame would keep him from ever attempting to see her , or even from writing again . "
134440	134471	134434	134434	he	4571	" the parlour - maid said . And there was the sick fear back on her again ! She could hardly control the trembling of her lips as she asked : "

134495	134501	134484	134484	he	4571	" She longed to return : "
134508	135074	134504	134504	you	4571	" but restrained herself , and passed into the drawing - room . After all , the parlour - maid had not described the caller -- why jump to the conclusion that it was Wyant ? Three days passed , and no letter came -- no sign . She struggled with the temptation to describe Wyant to the servants , and to forbid his admission . But it would not do . They were nearly all old servants , in whose eyes she was still the intruder , the upstart sick - nurse -- she could not wholly trust them . And each day she felt a little easier , a little more convinced that the unknown visitor had not been Wyant . On the fourth day she received a letter from Amherst . He hoped to be back on the morrow , but as his plans were still uncertain he would telegraph in the morning -- and meanwhile she must keep well , and rest , and amuse herself .... Amuse herself ! That evening , as it happened , she was going to the theatre with Mrs. Ansell . She and Mrs. Ansell , though outwardly on perfect terms , had not greatly advanced in intimacy . The agitated , decentralized life of the older woman seemed futile and trivial to Justine ; but on Mr. Langhope 's account she wished to keep up an appearance of friendship with his friend , and the same motive doubtless inspired Mrs. Ansell . Just now , at any rate , Justine was grateful for her attentions , and glad to go about with her . Anything -- anything to get away from her own thoughts ! That was the pass she had come to . At the theatre , in a proscenium box , the publicity , the light and movement , the action of the play , all helped to distract and quiet her . At such moments she grew ashamed of her fears . Why was she tormenting herself ? If anything happened she had only to ask her husband for more money . She never spoke to him of her good works , and there would be nothing to excite suspicion in her asking help again for the friend whose secret she was pledged to keep .... But nothing was going to happen . As the play progressed , and the stimulus of talk and laughter flowed through her veins , she felt a complete return of confidence . And then suddenly she glanced across the house , and saw Wyant looking at her . He sat rather far back , in one of the side rows just beneath the balcony , so that his face was partly shaded . But even in the shadow it frightened her . She had been prepared for a change , but not for this ghastly deterioration . And he continued to look at her . She began to be afraid that he would do something conspicuous -- point at her , or stand up in his seat . She thought he looked half - mad -- or was it her own hallucination that made him appear so ? She and Mrs. Ansell were alone in the box for the moment , and she started up , pushing back her chair .... Mrs. Ansell leaned forward . "

135093	135821	135086	135086	I'll	2983	" But as she withdrew into the back of the box , she was seized by a new fear . If he was still watching , might he not come to the door and try to speak to her ? Her only safety lay in remaining in full view of the audience ; and she returned to Mrs. Ansell 's side . The other members of the party came back -- the bell rang , the foot - lights blazed , the curtain rose . She lost herself in the mazes of the play . She sat so motionless , her face so intently turned toward the stage , that the muscles at the back of her neck began to stiffen . And then , quite suddenly , toward the middle of the act , she felt an undefinable sense of relief . She could not tell what caused it -- but slowly , cautiously , while the eyes of the others were intent upon the stage , she turned her head and looked toward Wyant 's seat . It was empty . Her first thought was that he had gone to wait for her outside . But no -- there were two more acts : why should he stand at the door for half the evening ? At last the act ended ; the entr'acte elapsed ; the play went on again -- and still the seat was empty . Gradually she persuaded herself that she had been mistaken in thinking that the man who had occupied it was Wyant . Her self - command returned , she began to think and talk naturally , to follow the dialogue on the stage -- and when the evening was over , and Mrs. Ansell set her down at her door , she had almost forgotten her fears . The next morning she felt calmer than for many days . She was sure now that if Wyant had wished to speak to her he would have waited at the door of the theatre ; and the recollection of his miserable face made apprehension yield to pity . She began to feel that she had treated him coldly , uncharitably . They had been friends once , as well as fellow - workers ; but she had been false even to the comradeship of the hospital . She should have sought him out and given him sympathy as well as money ; had she shown some sign of human kindness his last letter might never have been written . In the course of the morning Amherst telegraphed that he hoped to settle his business in time to catch the two o'clock express , but that his plans were still uncertain . Justine and Cicely lunched alone , and after luncheon the little girl was despatched to her dancing - class . Justine herself meant to go out when the brougham returned . She went up to her room to dress , planning to drive in the park , and to drop in on Mrs. Ansell before she called for Cicely ; but on the way downstairs she saw the servant opening the door to a visitor . It was too late to draw back ; and descending the last steps she found herself face to face with Wyant . They looked at each other a moment in silence ; then Justine murmured a word of greeting and led the way to the drawing - room . It was a snowy afternoon , and in the raw ash - coloured light she thought he looked more changed than at the theatre . She remarked , too , that his clothes were worn and untidy , his gloveless hands soiled and tremulous . None of the degrading signs of his infirmity were lacking ; and she saw at once that , while in the early days of the habit he had probably mixed his drugs , so that the conflicting symptoms neutralized each other , he had now sunk into open morphia - taking . She felt profoundly sorry for him ; yet as he followed her into the room physical repulsion again mastered the sense of pity . But where action was possible she was always self - controlled , and she turned to him quietly as they seated themselves . "

137678	137964	137674	137674	I	0	" For the last five minutes Justine had foreseen this threat , and had tried to force her mind to face dispassionately the chances it involved . After all , why not let him write to Amherst ? The very vileness of the deed must rouse an indignation which would be all in her favour , would inevitably dispose her husband to readier sympathy with the motive of her act , as contrasted with the base insinuations of her slanderer . It seemed impossible that Amherst should condemn her when his condemnation involved the fulfilling of Wyant 's calculations : a reaction of scorn would throw him into unhesitating championship of her conduct . All this was so clear that , had she been advising any one else , her confidence in the course to be taken might have strengthened the feeblest will ; but with the question lying between herself and Amherst -- with the vision of those soiled hands literally laid on the spotless fabric of her happiness , judgment wavered , foresight was obscured -- she felt tremulously unable to face the steps between exposure and vindication . Her final conclusion was that she must , at any rate , gain time : buy off Wyant till she had been able to tell her story in her own way , and at her own hour , and then defy him when he returned to the assault . The idea that whatever concession she made would be only provisional , helped to excuse the weakness of making it , and enabled her at last , without too painful a sense of falling below her own standards , to reply in a low voice : "
137979	138003	137971	137971	I	0	" But Wyant did not respond as readily as she had expected . He merely asked , without altering his insolently easy attitude : "

138042	138062	138014	138014	I	0	me"--Why could she not even say in her own heart : _ I will tell my husband tonight ? _ "
138067	138077	138063	138063	You	3010	" said Wyant , as if answering her thought . "
138130	138169	138114	138114	you	3010	" Justine 's heart sank . She had reached the point of being ready to appeal again to Amherst -- but on what pretext could she ask for such a sum ? In a lifeless voice she said : "
138182	138198	138201	138201	you	3010	" Wyant scrutinized her a moment : her despair must have rung true to him . "
138219	138241	138211	138211	your	3010	" he said . So it had been he -- and he had sat there appraising her value like a murderer ! "

138314	138459	138460	138460	You	0	" she was about to exclaim ; when suddenly her eyes fell on the clock . If Amherst had caught the two o'clock express he would be at the house within the hour ; and the only thing that seemed of consequence now , was that he should not meet Wyant . Supposing she still found courage to refuse -- there was no knowing how long the humiliating scene might be prolonged : and she must be rid of the creature at any cost . After all , she seldom wore the sapphire -- months might pass without its absence being noted by Amherst 's careless eye ; and if Wyant should pawn it , she might somehow save money to buy it back before it was missed . She went through these calculations with feverish rapidity ; then she turned again to Wyant . "

Once outside the door she was in such haste that she stumbled on the stairs , and had to pause on the landing to regain her breath . In her room she found one of the housemaids busy , and at first could think of no pretext for dismissing her . Then she bade the woman go down and send the brougham away , telling the coachman to call for Miss Cicely at six . Left alone , she bolted the door , and as if with a thief 's hand , opened her wardrobe , unlocked her jewel - box , and drew out the sapphire in its flat morocco case . She restored the box to its place , the key to its ring -- then she opened the case and looked at the sapphire . As she did so , a little tremor ran over her neck and throat , and closing her eyes she felt her husband 's kiss , and the touch of his hands as he fastened on the jewel . She unbolted the door , listened intently on the landing , and then went slowly down the stairs . None of the servants were in sight , yet as she reached the lower hall she was conscious that the air had grown suddenly colder , as though the outer door had just been opened . She paused , and listened again . There was a sound of talking in the drawing - room . Could it be that in her absence a visitor had been admitted ? The possibility frightened her at first -- then she welcomed it as an unexpected means of ridding herself of her tormentor . She opened the drawing - room door , and saw her husband talking with Wyant . XXXV AMHERST , his back to the threshold , sat at a table writing : Wyant stood a few feet away , staring down at the fire . Neither had heard the door open ; and before they were aware of her entrance Justine had calculated that she must have been away for at least five minutes , and that in that space of time almost anything might have passed between them . For a moment the power of connected thought left her ; then her heart gave a bound of relief . She said to herself that Wyant had doubtless made some allusion to his situation , and that her husband , conscious only of a great debt of gratitude , had at once sat down to draw a cheque for him . The idea was so reassuring that it restored all her clearness of thought . Wyant was the first to see her . He made an abrupt movement , and Amherst , rising , turned and put an envelope in his hand . "
138994	139005	138472	138472	I	0	" As he turned he caught sight of his wife . "
139021	139025	139015	139015	you	3368	" he asked . "
139028	139052	139015	139015	you	3368	" she faltered , pressing her left hand , with the little case in it , close to the folds of her dress . "
139075	139114	139067	139067	they	3016	" At the same moment she found Wyant advancing with extended hand , and understood that he had concealed the fact of having already seen her . She accepted the cue , and shook his hand , murmuring : "
139120	139132	139117	139117	you	0	" Amherst looked at her , perhaps struck by her manner . "
139142	139143	139137	139138	Dr. Wyant	165	" "
139146	139159	139137	139138	Dr. Wyant	165	" she answered , thankful to have this pretext for her emotion . "

139245	139299	139243	139243	you	0	" Wyant murmured , passing his hand over his forehead . Justine stood silent . She wondered that her husband had not noticed that tremulous degraded hand . But he was always so blind to externals -- and he had no medical experience to sharpen his perceptions . Suddenly she felt impelled to speak "
139336	139337	139338	139338	Wyant	165	" "
139377	139378	139368	139368	she	3023	" "
139396	139428	139390	139391	Mr. Langhope	120	" She felt Wyant 's face change : his eyes settled on her in a threatening stare . Amherst looked at her also , and there was surprise in his glance . "
139458	139530	139442	139442	He	3026	" He seldom spoke of Mr. Langhope as his father - in - law , and the chance designation seemed to mark a closer tie between them , to exclude Justine from what was after all a family affair . For a moment she felt tempted to accept the suggestion , and let the responsibility fall where it would . But it would fall on Amherst -- and that was intolerable . "
139538	139558	139533	139533	you	0	" she insisted . An embarrassed silence settled on the three . Wyant broke it by advancing toward Amherst . "
139566	139570	139563	139563	your	0	" he said ; "
139585	139615	139572	139572	I	0	" The words were well chosen , and well spoken ; Justine saw that they produced a good effect . Amherst grasped the physician 's hand with a smile . "

139651	139677	139678	139679	Dr. Wyant	165	" said Wyant gratefully . He bowed slightly to Justine and turned to go ; but as he reached the threshold she moved after him . "
139688	139714	139715	139716	Dr. Wyant	165	" He stopped short with a whitening face . She felt Amherst 's eyes on her again ; and she said desperately , addressing him : "
139721	139731	139733	139733	you	165	" Her husband 's glance turned abruptly to Wyant . "
139735	139767	139733	139733	you	165	" he asked after a pause . Wyant looked from one to the other . The moisture came out on his forehead , and he passed his hand over it again . "
139770	139778	139779	139780	Mrs. Amherst	117	" he said in a dry voice . "
139791	139792	139779	139780	Mrs. Amherst	117	" "
139803	139814	139800	139800	you	165	" Justine interposed hastily , before the answer could come . "

139845	139864	139837	139837	he	165	" There was another silence ; and again Wyant broke in , this time with a slight laugh . "
139901	139920	139893	139893	she	117	" Amherst turned on the speaker ; and , as she had foreseen , his look was terrible . "
139928	139932	139921	139921	You	165	" he said . "
139938	139944	139935	139935	I	0	" Wyant waited another moment . "
139952	139970	139945	139945	I	0	" he declared . There was a low exclamation from Justine , and Amherst strode toward Wyant . "
139975	139979	139971	139971	You	165	" he cried . "
139983	139994	139971	139971	You	165	" Wyant muttered , flinching back from his outstretched arm . "
140008	140013	140017	140017	God	156	" Wyant straightened himself . "
140023	140028	140019	140019	I	0	" he retorted furiously . "
140089	140098	140076	140076	She	4011	" Amherst 's arm fell to his side . "
140102	140119	140124	140124	she	4011	" Behind him there was a sound of inarticulate appeal -- but he took no notice . "
140149	140156	140141	140141	She	4011	" Amherst looked at him confusedly . "
140160	140161	140141	140141	She	4011	" "
140192	140193	140194	140194	John	159	" "
140196	140219	140194	140194	John	159	" Justine gasped out , pressing between them . Amherst gently put aside the hand with which she had caught his arm . "
140237	140246	140230	140230	You	117	" he said to her in an undertone . "
140262	140270	140258	140258	I	0	" she breathed back with trembling lips . "
140280	140323	140271	140271	You	117	" Wyant threw in with a sneer . Amherst remained silent for a brief space ; then he turned his eyes once more to his wife . Justine lifted her face : it looked small and spent , like an extinguished taper . "
140328	140332	140271	140271	You	117	" she said . "
140335	140336	140337	140337	I	0	" "
140386	140407	140411	140411	you	0	" There was another silence ; then she went on in a stronger voice , looking straight at her husband : "
140417	140425	140411	140411	you	0	" Amherst glanced at Wyant without moving . "
140428	140442	140411	140411	you	0	" he said curtly . Wyant , instead , moved a step nearer . "
140489	140510	140511	140512	Dr. Garford	95	" Again Amherst 's eyes addressed themselves slowly to Justine ; and she forced her lips to articulate an answer . "
140537	140538	140523	140523	he	95	" "
140544	140556	140557	140557	You	3042	" said Wyant grimly . Amherst strode up to him again . "
140564	140576	140557	140557	You	3042	" he commanded . But still Wyant sneeringly stood his ground . "
140679	140680	140666	140666	she	117	" "
140682	140686	140687	140687	I	0	" Justine moaned . "
140721	140732	140714	140714	she	117	" He thrust his shaking hand into an inner pocket . "
140808	140843	140792	140792	you	3049	" Amherst did not heed this injunction . He stood motionless , gripping the back of a chair , as if his next gesture might be to lift and hurl it at the speaker . "
140846	140936	140937	140938	You hound	3052	" Wyant repeated . Amherst turned his head slowly , and his dull gaze rested on his wife . His face looked years older -- lips and eyes moved as heavily as an old man 's . As he looked at her , Justine came forward without speaking , and laid the little morocco case in his hand . He held it there a moment , as if hardly understanding her action -- then he tossed it on the table at his elbow , and walked up to Wyant . "
140940	140942	140937	140937	You	3051	" he said--"now
140945	140970	140937	140937	You	3051	" XXXVI WHEN Wyant had left the room , and the house - door had closed on him , Amherst spoke to his wife . "
140974	141126	141127	141127	John	159	" he said . Justine followed him , scarcely conscious where she went , but moving already with a lighter tread . Part of her weight of misery had been lifted with Wyant 's going . She had suffered less from the fear of what her husband might think than from the shame of making her avowal in her defamer 's presence . And her faith in Amherst 's comprehension had begun to revive . He had dismissed Wyant with scorn and horror -- did not that show that he was on her side already ? And how many more arguments she had at her call ! Her brain hummed with them as she followed him up the stairs . In her bedroom he closed the door and stood motionless , the same heavy half - paralyzed look on his face . It frightened her and she went up to him . "
141129	141142	141127	141127	John	159	" she said timidly . He put his hand to his head . "
141146	141187	141127	141127	John	159	" he returned ; and she waited , her heart slowly sinking again . The moment over , he seemed to recover his power of movement . He crossed the room and threw himself into the armchair near the hearth . "
141193	141232	141127	141127	John	159	" He sat thrown back , his eyes fixed on the fire , and the vertical lines between his brows forming a deep scar in his white face . Justine moved nearer , and touched his arm beseechingly . "
141240	141261	141235	141235	you	159	" He turned his head slowly , as if with an effort , and his eyes rested reluctantly on hers . "
141268	141284	141235	141235	you	159	" she exclaimed . He seemed to make a stronger effort at self - control . "
141299	141329	141330	141330	I	0	" he said in a level voice , his gaze on the fire . She stood before him , her arms hanging down , her clasped fingers twisting restlessly . "
141348	141373	141343	141343	I	0	" There was a slight sound in Amherst 's throat , like the ghost of a derisive laugh . After another interval he said : "
141382	141584	141374	141374	I	0	" She seated herself on the edge of a chair near by , bending forward , with hands interlocked and arms extended on her knees -- every line reaching out to him , as though her whole slight body were an arrow winged with pleadings . It was a relief to speak at last , even face to face with the stony image that sat in her husband 's place ; and she told her story , detail by detail , omitting nothing , exaggerating nothing , speaking slowly , clearly , with precision , aware that the bare facts were her strongest argument . Amherst , as he listened , shifted his position once , raising his hand so that it screened his face ; and in that attitude he remained when she had ended . As she waited for him to speak , Justine realized that her heart had been alive with tremulous hopes . All through her narrative she had counted on a murmur of perception , an exclamation of pity : she had felt sure of melting the stony image . But Amherst said no word . At length he spoke , still without turning his head . "
141597	141615	141585	141585	You	3054	" A sob formed in her throat , and she had to wait to steady her voice . "

141952	141962	141936	141936	I	0	" There was another pause . Then Amherst said : "
141970	141997	141936	141936	I	0	" It was the word for which she had waited -- the word of her inmost fears . She felt the blood mount to her face . "

142015	142019	141999	141999	you	0	" she faltered . "

142029	142056	142021	142021	you	0	" Silence again . Her eyes strayed to the clock , and some dim association of ideas told her that Cicely would soon be coming in . "

142208	142237	142204	142204	I	0	" She spoke the words proudly , strongly , and for the first time the hard lines of his face relaxed , and a slight tremor crossed it . "

142312	142351	142300	142300	I	0	" he echoed ironically , as though she had presumed to apply to herself a word of which he had the grim monopoly . He rose and took a few aimless steps ; then he halted before her . "

142372	142383	142384	142384	You	0	" she said , her head sinking . He laughed . "

142429	142480	142482	142482	you	0	" he groaned , turning away with clenched hands . Justine had risen also , and she stood motionless , her hands clasped against her breast , in the drawn shrinking attitude of a fugitive overtaken by a blinding storm . He moved back to her with an appealing gesture . "
142515	142525	142499	142499	you	0	" She cut him short with an indignant cry . "
142567	142568	142565	142565	Bessy	170	" "
142576	142642	142643	142643	John	159	" broke from him harshly , and she drew back , cut to the heart . There was another pause , during which he seemed to fall into a kind of dazed irresolution , his head on his breast , as though unconscious of her presence . Then he roused himself and went to the door . As he passed her she sprang after him . "
142655	142656	142650	142650	you	159	" "
142662	142663	142650	142650	you	159	" "
142766	142782	142785	142785	you	159	" He moved another step without speaking , and she caught him by the arm . "
142793	142840	142785	142785	you	159	" She turned and crossed the room . On the lower shelf of the little table by her bed a few books were ranged : she stooped and drew one hurriedly forth , opening it at the fly - leaf as she went back to Amherst . "
142867	142898	142785	142785	you	159	" It was the little volume of Bacon which she was thrusting at him . He took it with a bewildered look , as if scarcely following what she said . "
142905	142920	142785	142785	you	159	" she commanded ; and mechanically he read out the words he had written . "
142951	142979	142981	142981	you	159	" he exclaimed , flinging the book from him with a gesture of abhorrence . Justine watched him with panting lips , her knees trembling under her . "
142995	144515	142991	142991	you	159	" she cried , as the book spun across a table and dropped to the floor . He looked at her coldly , almost apprehensively , as if she had grown suddenly dangerous and remote ; then he turned and walked out of the room . * * * * * The striking of the clock roused her . She rose to her feet , rang the bell , and told the maid , through the door , that she had a headache , and was unable to see Miss Cicely . Then she turned back into the room , and darkness closed on her . She was not the kind to take grief passively -- it drove her in anguished pacings up and down the floor . She walked and walked till her legs flagged under her ; then she dropped stupidly into the chair where Amherst had sat .... All her world had crumbled about her . It was as if some law of mental gravity had been mysteriously suspended , and every firmly - anchored conviction , every accepted process of reasoning , spun disconnectedly through space . Amherst had not understood her -- worse still , he had judged her as the world might judge her ! The core of her misery was there . With terrible clearness she saw the suspicion that had crossed his mind -- the suspicion that she had kept silence in the beginning because she loved him , and feared to lose him if she spoke . And what if it were true ? What if her unconscious guilt went back even farther than his thought dared to track it ? She could not now recall a time when she had not loved him . Every chance meeting with him , from their first brief talk at Hanaford , stood out embossed and glowing against the blur of lesser memories . Was it possible that she had loved him during Bessy 's life -- that she had even , sub - consciously , blindly , been urged by her feeling for him to perform the act ? But she shook herself free from this morbid horror -- the rebound of health was always prompt in her , and her mind instinctively rejected every form of moral poison . No ! Her motive had been normal , sane and justifiable -- completely justifiable . Her fault lay in having dared to rise above conventional restrictions , her mistake in believing that her husband could rise with her . These reflections steadied her but they did not bring much comfort . For her whole life was centred in Amherst , and she saw that he would never be able to free himself from the traditional view of her act . In looking back , and correcting her survey of his character in the revealing light of the last hours , she perceived that , like many men of emancipated thought , he had remained subject to the old conventions of feeling . And he had probably never given much thought to women till he met her -- had always been content to deal with them in the accepted currency of sentiment . After all , it was the currency they liked best , and for which they offered their prettiest wares ! But what of the intellectual accord between himself and her ? She had not been deceived in that ! He and she had really been wedded in mind as well as in heart . But until now there had not arisen in their lives one of those searching questions which call into play emotions rooted far below reason and judgment , in the dark primal depths of inherited feeling . It is easy to judge impersonal problems intellectually , turning on them the full light of acquired knowledge ; but too often one must still grope one 's way through the personal difficulty by the dim taper carried in long - dead hands .... But was there then no hope of lifting one 's individual life to a clearer height of conduct ? Must one be content to think for the race , and to feel only -- feel blindly and incoherently -- for one 's self ? And was it not from such natures as Amherst's -- natures in which independence of judgment was blent with strong human sympathy -- that the liberating impulse should come ? Her mind grew weary of revolving in this vain circle of questions . The fact was that , in their particular case , Amherst had not risen above prejudice and emotion ; that , though her act was one to which his intellectual sanction was given , he had turned from her with instinctive repugnance , had dishonoured her by the most wounding suspicions . The tie between them was forever stained and debased . Justine 's long hospital - discipline made it impossible for her to lose consciousness of the lapse of time , or to let her misery thicken into mental stupor . She could not help thinking and moving ; and she presently lifted herself to her feet , turned on the light , and began to prepare for dinner . It would be terrible to face her husband across Mr. Langhope 's pretty dinner - table , and afterward in the charming drawing - room , with its delicate old ornaments and intimate luxurious furniture ; but she could not continue to sit motionless in the dark : it was her innermost instinct to pick herself up and go on . While she dressed she listened anxiously for Amherst 's step in the next room ; but there was no sound , and when she dragged herself downstairs the drawing - room was empty , and the parlour - maid , after a decent delay , came to ask if dinner should be postponed . She said no , murmuring some vague pretext for her husband 's absence , and sitting alone through the succession of courses which composed the brief but carefully - studied _ menu _ . When this ordeal was over she returned to the drawing - room and took up a book . It chanced to be a new volume on labour problems , which Amherst must have brought back with him from Westmore ; and it carried her thoughts instantly to the mills . Would this disaster poison their work there as well as their personal relation ? Would he think of her as carrying contamination even into the task their love had illumined ? The hours went on without his returning , and at length it occurred to her that he might have taken the night train to Hanaford . Her heart contracted at the thought : she remembered -- though every nerve shrank from the analogy -- his sudden flight at another crisis in his life , and she felt obscurely that if he escaped from her now she would never recover her hold on him . But could he be so cruel -- could he wish any one to suffer as she was suffering ? At ten o'clock she could endure the drawing - room no longer , and went up to her room again . She undressed slowly , trying to prolong the process as much as possible , to put off the period of silence and inaction which would close in on her when she lay down on her bed . But at length the dreaded moment came -- there was nothing more between her and the night . She crept into bed and put out the light ; but as she slipped between the cold sheets a trembling seized her , and after a moment she drew on her dressing - gown again and groped her way to the lounge by the fire . She pushed the lounge closer to the hearth and lay down , still shivering , though she had drawn the quilted coverlet up to her chin . She lay there a long time , with closed eyes , in a mental darkness torn by sudden flashes of memory . In one of these flashes a phrase of Amherst 's stood out -- a word spoken at Westmore , on the day of the opening of the Emergency Hospital , about a good - looking young man who had called to see her . She remembered Amherst 's boyish burst of jealousy , his sudden relief at the thought that the visitor might have been Wyant . And no doubt it _ was _ Wyant -- Wyant who had come to Hanaford to threaten her , and who , baffled by her non - arrival , or for some other unexplained reason , had left again without carrying out his purpose . It was dreadful to think by how slight a chance her first draught of happiness had escaped that drop of poison ; yet , when she understood , her inward cry was : "
144528	144726	142991	142991	you	159	" ... Already she was feeling Amherst 's pain more than her own , understanding that it was harder to bear than hers because it was at war with all the reflective part of his nature . As she lay there , her face pressed into the cushions , she heard a sound through the silent house -- the opening and closing of the outer door . She turned cold , and lay listening with strained ears .... Yes ; now there was a step on the stairs -- her husband 's step ! She heard him turn into his own room . The throbs of her heart almost deafened her -- she only distinguished confusedly that he was moving about within , so close that it was as if she felt his touch . Then her door opened and he entered . He stumbled slightly in the darkness before he found the switch of the lamp ; and as he bent over it she saw that his face was flushed , and that his eyes had an excited light which , in any one less abstemious , might almost have seemed like the effect of wine . "
144731	144752	144728	144728	you	3075	" he asked . She started up against the cushions , her black hair streaming about her small ghostly face . "
144755	144771	144728	144728	you	3075	" He walked over to the lounge and dropped into the low chair beside it . "
144784	144807	144772	144772	I	0	" he exclaimed , breathing hard , the redness deepening in his face . She turned on him in joy and trembling . "
144828	144829	144825	144825	you	159	" "
144876	144924	144869	144869	I	0	" He spoke in a strong clear voice that had a brightness like the brightness in his eyes . She felt its heat in her veins -- the primitive woman in her glowed at contact with the primitive man . But reflection chilled her the next moment . "
144948	144996	144934	144934	you	159	" As she questioned him , there rose before her the terrified vision of a crowd gathering -- the police , newspapers , a hideous publicity . He must have been mad to do it -- and yet he must have done it because he loved her ! "
145031	145140	145141	145141	Justine	100	" She trembled , fearing yet adoring him . Nothing could have been more unlike the Amherst she fancied she knew than this act of irrational anger which had magically lifted the darkness from his spirit ; yet , magically also , it gave him back to her , made them one flesh once more . And suddenly the pressure of opposed emotions became too strong , and she burst into tears . She wept painfully , violently , with the resistance of strong natures unused to emotional expression ; till at length , through the tumult of her tears , she felt her husband 's reassuring touch . "
145143	145170	145141	145141	Justine	100	" he said , speaking once more in his natural voice . She raised her face from her hands , and they looked at each other . "
145186	145213	145176	145176	I	0	" Her lips parted , but her throat was still full of sobs , and she could only look at him while the tears ran down . "
145220	145244	145216	145216	I	0	" he continued , in the same quiet tone . Her hand shrank from his clasp , and she began to tremble again . "
145264	145277	145278	145278	I	0	" He sat down beside her and drew her into his arms . "
145282	145300	145278	145278	I	0	" he whispered , holding her close , and pressing his lips against her face and hair . "
145316	145328	145309	145309	You	3575	" He answered her with more kisses , murmuring through them : "
145338	145362	145363	145363	I	0	" while he held her fast . With her face against him she yielded to the childish luxury of murmuring out unjustified fears . "
145372	145373	145332	145333	poor child	2134	" "
145379	145380	145332	145333	poor child	2134	" "
145386	145407	145332	145333	poor child	2134	" She felt a contraction of the arm embracing her , as though a throb of pain had stiffened it . "
145415	145445	145408	145408	I	0	" he said abruptly ; but as he felt in her a responsive shrinking he gathered her close again , whispering through the hair that fell about her cheek : "
145460	145746	145749	145749	you	3090	" And in the clasp of his arms her terror and anguish subsided , giving way , not to the deep peace of tranquillized thought , but to a confused well - being that lulled all thought to sleep . XXXVII BUT thought could never be long silent between them ; and Justine 's triumph lasted but a day . With its end she saw what it had been made of : the ascendency of youth and sex over his subjugated judgment . Her first impulse was to try and maintain it -- why not use the protective arts with which love inspired her ? She who lived so keenly in the brain could live as intensely in her feelings ; her quick imagination tutored her looks and words , taught her the spells to weave about shorn giants . And for a few days she and Amherst lost themselves in this self - evoked cloud of passion , both clinging fast to the visible , the palpable in their relation , as if conscious already that its finer essence had fled . Amherst made no allusion to what had passed , asked for no details , offered no reassurances -- behaved as if the whole episode had been effaced from his mind . And from Wyant there came no sound : he seemed to have disappeared from life as he had from their talk . Toward the end of the week Amherst announced that he must return to Hanaford ; and Justine at once declared her intention of going with him . He seemed surprised , disconcerted almost ; and for the first time the shadow of what had happened fell visibly between them . "
145759	145763	145764	145764	He	120	" he suggested . "
145772	145773	145764	145764	He	120	" "
145782	145783	145775	145775	he	120	" "
145819	146069	145808	145808	I	0	" There was in fact no reason that he could produce ; and the next day they returned to Hanaford together . With her perceptions strung to the last pitch of sensitiveness , she felt a change in Amherst as soon as they re - entered Bessy 's house . He was still scrupulously considerate , almost too scrupulously tender ; but with a tinge of lassitude , like a man who tries to keep up under the stupefying approach of illness . And she began to hate the power by which she held him . It was not thus they had once walked together , free in mind though so linked in habit and feeling ; when their love was not a deadening drug but a vivifying element that cleared thought instead of stifling it . There were moments when she felt that open alienation would be easier , because it would be nearer the truth . And at such moments she longed to speak , to beg him to utter his mind , to go with her once for all into the depths of the subject they continued to avoid . But at the last her heart always failed her : she could not face the thought of losing him , of hearing him speak estranging words to her . They had been at Hanaford for about ten days when , one morning at breakfast , Amherst uttered a sudden exclamation over a letter he was reading . "
146074	146107	145808	145808	I	0	" she asked in a tremor . He had grown very pale , and was pushing the hair from his forehead with the gesture habitual to him in moments of painful indecision . "
146112	146120	145808	145808	I	0	" Justine repeated , her fear growing . "
146122	146155	146156	146157	Mr. Langhope	120	" he began , thrusting the letter under the pile of envelopes by his plate ; but she continued to look at him anxiously , till she drew his eyes to hers . "
146169	146174	146160	146160	they	3092	" he said abruptly . "
146185	146189	146180	146180	we	3094	" she cried . "
146197	146198	146192	146192	we	3094	" "
146204	146231	146234	146234	you	3096	" Amherst said nothing , but the long silence between them seemed full of ironic answers , till she brought out , hardly above her breath : "
146237	146238	146234	146234	you	3096	" "
146254	146255	146234	146234	you	3096	" "
146258	146357	146358	146358	John	159	" she murmured . He went on tearing open his other letters , and glancing at their contents . She leaned back in her chair , her cup of coffee untasted , listening to the recurrent crackle of torn paper as he tossed aside one letter after another . Presently he rose from his seat , and as she followed him from the dining - room she noticed that his breakfast had also remained untasted . He gathered up his letters and walked toward the smoking - room ; and after a moment 's hesitation she joined him . "
146360	146409	146358	146358	John	159	" she said from the threshold . He was just seating himself at his desk , but he turned to her with an obvious effort at kindness which made the set look of his face the more marked . She closed the door and went up to him . "
146426	146430	146358	146358	John	159	" she said . "
146440	146472	146475	146475	you	3099	" She was silent , and Amherst flung himself down on the leather ottoman against the wall . She stood before him , clasping and unclasping her hands in speechless distress . "
146480	146489	146475	146475	you	3099	" he asked at length , almost irritably . "
146509	146525	146494	146494	he	120	" she faltered out . Amherst lifted his head slowly , and looked at her . "
146539	146549	146550	146550	I	0	" She moved nearer to him with beseeching eyes . "
146567	146608	146609	146609	John	159	" she broke out passionately . He made no answer , but she could see a look of suffering cross his face , and coming still closer , she sank down on the ottoman , laying her hand on his . "
146618	146644	146613	146613	John	159	" she whispered . For a moment his hand lay quiet under hers ; then he drew it out , and enclosed her trembling fingers . "
146658	146768	146654	146654	I'll	3102	" he said , suddenly putting his other arm about her . The reaction caught her by the throat , forcing out a dry sob or two ; and as she pressed her face against him he raised it up and gently kissed her . But even as their lips met she felt that they were sealing a treaty with dishonour . That his kiss should come to mean that to her ! It was unbearable -- worse than any personal pain -- the thought of dragging him down to falsehood through her weakness . She drew back and rose to her feet , putting aside his detaining hand . "
146789	146798	146803	146803	I	0	" Her voice gathered strength as she spoke . "
146812	146832	146833	146833	John	159	" But again he seemed sunk in inaction , like a man over whom some baneful lethargy is stealing . "
146839	146850	146851	146851	You	0	" she repeated urgently . He looked up at her . "
146858	146859	146851	146851	You	0	" "
146882	146883	146851	146851	You	0	" "
146892	146897	146851	146851	You	0	" he answered apathetically . "
146916	146989	146911	146911	I	0	" He rose slowly to his feet , without looking at her again , and walked over to the desk . She sank down on the ottoman and watched him with burning eyes while he drew forth a sheet of note - paper and began to write . But after he had written a few words he laid down his pen , and swung his chair about so that he faced her . "
146999	147003	146990	146990	I	0	" he exclaimed . "
147012	147024	147009	147009	you	0	" she said , starting up . He looked at her . "
147035	147036	147026	147026	you	0	" "
147038	147048	147049	147049	You	0	" She looked back at him with sudden insight . "
147057	147058	147055	147055	yourself	0	" "
147074	147097	147061	147061	I	0	" Her trembling increased so much that she had to rest her hands against the edge of the ottoman to steady herself . "
147110	147111	147105	147105	Wyant	165	" "
147131	147132	147120	147120	you	0	" "
147135	147136	147120	147120	you	0	" "
147155	147177	147120	147120	you	0	" She sat silent , letting the bitter truth of this sink into her till it poured courage into her veins . "
147185	147189	147120	147120	you	0	" she confessed . "
147197	147198	147191	147191	you	0	" "

147211	147232	147200	147200	you	0	" The words struck down her last illusion , and she rose and went over to the writing - table . "
147237	147263	147200	147200	you	0	" she said . He stood up also , and took both her hands , not in a caress , but gravely , almost severely . "
147342	147353	147334	147334	I	0	" Her heart sank with a foreboding of new peril . "

147378	147392	147367	147367	you	100	" He dropped her hands and took an abrupt turn across the room . "
147399	147404	147397	147397	her	3109	" he broke out , "
147433	147434	147423	147423	I	0	" "
147439	147454	147423	147423	I	0	" she cried , lifting her hands as if to keep off a blow . "
147467	147472	147462	147462	We	3111	" he said doggedly . "

147509	147538	147503	147503	he	3496	" Amherst asked with a terrible laugh . But at that she recovered her courage , as she always did when an extreme call was made on it . "
147562	147579	147582	147582	you	100	" Her voice sank , and she lifted her hands and pressed them to her temples . "
147595	147606	147582	147582	you	100	" She paused , and her voice regained its strength . "
147638	147659	147631	147631	You	100	" Amherst , at the challenge , remained silent , while a slow red crept to his cheek - bones . "
147673	147678	147662	147662	I	0	" he said slowly . "
147752	147763	147741	147741	I	0	" He stood motionless , staring moodily at the floor . "

147841	147876	147877	147877	I	0	" She saw in his face how he shrank from the least allusion to the act about which their torment revolved . But he forced himself to raise his head and look at her . "
147902	147903	147906	147906	John	159	" "
147910	147938	147908	147908	John	159	" she broke out in the wild joy of hearing herself absolved ; but the next instant her subtle perceptions felt the unconscious reserve behind his admission . "
147956	147986	147953	147953	your	0	" she said . He looked at her almost piteously , as if , in the last resort , it was from her that light must come to him . "
148039	148045	148038	148038	God----	239	" She interrupted him sobbingly . "
148099	148125	148133	148133	Justine	100	" Her sudden outbreak seemed to restore his self - possession . He went up to her and took her hand with a quieting touch . "
148209	148210	148211	148211	Our	3115	" "
148214	148218	148211	148211	Our	3115	" She started . "
148226	148245	148221	148221	I	0	" Amherst paused a moment , as if trying to choose the words least likely to pain her . "
148301	148302	148267	148267	he	120	" "

148373	148532	148533	148533	I	0	" For an instant a mad hope swelled in her -- the vision of escaping with him into new scenes , a new life , away from the coil of memories that bound them down as in a net . But the reaction of reason came at once -- she saw him cut off from his chosen work , his career destroyed , his honour clouded , above all -- ah , this was what wrung them both!--his task undone , his people flung back into the depths from which he had lifted them . And all through her doing -- all because she had clutched at happiness with too rash a hand ! The thought stung her to passionate activity of mind -- made her resolve to risk anything , dare anything , before she involved him farther in her own ruin . She felt her brain clear gradually , and the thickness dissolve in her throat . "
148536	148550	148533	148533	I	0	" she said in a low voice , raising her eyes to his . "

XXXVIII AT half - past six that afternoon , just as Amherst , on his return from the mills , put the key into his door at Hanaford , Mrs. Ansell , in New York , was being shown into Mr. Langhope 's library . As she entered , her friend rose from his chair by the fire , and turned on her a face so disordered by emotion that she stopped short with an exclamation of alarm . "

151154	153167	153168	153168	I	0	" He let her hand rest there a moment ; then he turned , and drawing it into his own tremulous fingers , pressed it silently , with a clinging helpless grasp that drew the tears to her eyes . * * * * * Justine Brent , in her earliest girlhood , had gone through one of those emotional experiences that are the infantile diseases of the heart . She had fancied herself beloved of a youth of her own age ; had secretly returned his devotion , and had seen it reft from her by another . Such an incident , as inevitable as the measles , sometimes , like that mild malady , leaves traces out of all proportion to its actual virulence . The blow fell on Justine with tragic suddenness , and she reeled under it , thinking darkly of death , and renouncing all hopes of future happiness . Her ready pen often beguiled her into recording her impressions , and she now found an escape from despair in writing the history of a damsel similarly wronged . In her tale , the heroine killed herself ; but the author , saved by this vicarious sacrifice , lived , and in time even smiled over her manuscript . It was many years since Justine Amherst had recalled this youthful incident ; but the memory of it recurred to her as she turned from Mr. Langhope 's door . For a moment death seemed the easiest escape from what confronted her ; but though she could no longer medicine her despair by turning it into fiction , she knew at once that she must somehow transpose it into terms of action , that she must always escape from life into more life , and not into its negation . She had been carried into Mr. Langhope 's presence by that expiatory passion which still burns so high , and draws its sustenance from so deep down , in the unsleeping hearts of women . Though she had never wavered in her conviction that her act had been justified her ideas staggered under the sudden comprehension of its consequences . Not till that morning had she seen those consequences in their terrible , unsuspected extent , had she understood how one stone rashly loosened from the laboriously erected structure of human society may produce remote fissures in that clumsy fabric . She saw that , having hazarded the loosening of the stone , she should have held herself apart from ordinary human ties , like some priestess set apart for the service of the temple . And instead , she had seized happiness with both hands , taken it as the gift of the very fate she had herself precipitated ! She remembered some old Greek saying to the effect that the gods never forgive the mortal who presumes to love and suffer like a god . She had dared to do both , and the gods were bringing ruin on that deeper self which had its life in those about her . So much had become clear to her when she heard Amherst declare his intention of laying the facts before Mr. Langhope . His few broken words lit up the farthest verge of their lives . She saw that his retrospective reverence for his wife 's memory , which was far as possible removed from the strong passion of the mind and senses that bound him to herself , was indelibly stained and desecrated by the discovery that all he had received from the one woman had been won for him by the deliberate act of the other . This was what no reasoning , no appeal to the calmer judgment , could ever , in his inmost thoughts , undo or extenuate . It could find appeasement only in the renunciation of all that had come to him from Bessy ; and this renunciation , so different from the mere sacrifice of material well - being , was bound up with consequences so far - reaching , so destructive to the cause which had inspired his whole life , that Justine felt the helpless terror of the mortal who has launched one of the heavenly bolts . She could think of no way of diverting it but the way she had chosen . She must see Mr. Langhope first , must clear Amherst of the least faint association with her act or her intention . And to do this she must exaggerate , not her own compunction -- for she could not depart from the exact truth in reporting her feelings and convictions -- but her husband 's first instinctive movement of horror , the revulsion of feeling her confession had really produced in him . This was the most painful part of her task , and for this reason her excited imagination clothed it with a special expiatory value . If she could purchase Amherst 's peace of mind , and the security of his future , by confessing , and even over - emphasizing , the momentary estrangement between them there would be a bitter joy in such payment ! Her hour with Mr. Langhope proved the correctness of her intuition . She could save Amherst only by effacing herself from his life : those about him would be only too ready to let her bear the full burden of obloquy . She could see that , for a dozen reasons , Mr. Langhope , even in the first shock of his dismay , unconsciously craved a way of exonerating Amherst , of preserving intact the relation on which so much of his comfort had come to depend . And she had the courage to make the most of his desire , to fortify it by isolating Amherst 's point of view from hers ; so that , when the hour was over , she had the solace of feeling that she had completely freed him from any conceivable consequence of her act . So far , the impetus of self - sacrifice had carried her straight to her goal ; but , as frequently happens with such atoning impulses , it left her stranded just short of any subsequent plan of conduct . Her next step , indeed , was clear enough : she must return to Hanaford , explain to her husband that she had felt impelled to tell her own story to Mr. Langhope , and then take up her ordinary life till chance offered her a pretext for fulfilling her promise . But what pretext was likely to present itself ? No symbolic horn would sound the hour of fulfillment ; she must be her own judge , and hear the call in the depths of her own conscience . XXXIX WHEN Amherst , returning late that afternoon from Westmore , learned of his wife 's departure , and read the note she had left , he found it , for a time , impossible to bring order out of the confusion of feeling produced in him . His mind had been disturbed enough before . All day , through the routine of work at the mills , he had laboured inwardly with the difficulties confronting him ; and his unrest had been increased by the fact that his situation bore an ironic likeness to that in which , from a far different cause , he had found himself at the other crisis of his life . Once more he was threatened with the possibility of having to give up Westmore , at a moment when concentration of purpose and persistency of will were at last beginning to declare themselves in tangible results . Before , he had only given up dreams ; now it was their fruition that he was asked to surrender . And he was fixed in his resolve to withdraw absolutely from Westmore if the statement he had to make to Mr. Langhope was received with the least hint of an offensive mental reservation . All forms of moral compromise had always been difficult to Amherst , and like many men absorbed in large and complicated questions he craved above all clearness and peace in his household relation . The first months of his second marriage had brought him , as a part of richer and deeper joys , this enveloping sense of a clear moral medium , in which no subterfuge or equivocation could draw breath . He had felt that henceforth he could pour into his work all the combative energy , the powers of endurance , resistance , renovation , which had once been unprofitably dissipated in the vain attempt to bring some sort of harmony into life with Bessy . Between himself and Justine , apart from their love for each other , there was the wider passion for their kind , which gave back to them an enlarged and deepened reflection of their personal feeling . In such an air it had seemed that no petty egotism could hamper their growth , no misintelligence obscure their love ; yet all the while this pure happiness had been unfolding against a sordid background of falsehood and intrigue from which his soul turned with loathing . Justine was right in assuming that Amherst had never thought much about women . He had vaguely regarded them as meant to people that hazy domain of feeling designed to offer the busy man an escape from thought . His second marriage , leading him to the blissful discovery that woman can think as well as feel , that there are beings of the ornamental sex in whom brain and heart have so enlarged each other that their emotions are as clear as thought , their thoughts as warm as emotions -- this discovery had had the effect of making him discard his former summary conception of woman as a bundle of inconsequent impulses , and admit her at a stroke to full mental equality with her lord . The result of this act of manumission was , that in judging Justine he could no longer allow for what was purely feminine in her conduct . It was incomprehensible to him that she , to whom truth had seemed the essential element of life , should have been able to draw breath , and find happiness , in an atmosphere of falsehood and dissimulation . His mind could assent -- at least in the abstract -- to the reasonableness of her act ; but he was still unable to understand her having concealed it from him . He could enter far enough into her feelings to allow for her having kept silence on his first return to Lynbrook , when she was still under the strain of a prolonged and terrible trial ; but that she should have continued to do so when he and she had discovered and confessed their love for each other , threw an intolerable doubt on her whole course . He stayed late at the mills , finding one pretext after another for delaying his return to Hanaford , and trying , while he gave one part of his mind to the methodical performance of his task , to adjust the other to some definite view of the future . But all was darkened and confused by the sense that , between himself and Justine , complete communion of thought was no longer possible . It had , in fact , never existed ; there had always been a locked chamber in her mind , and he knew not yet what other secrets might inhabit it . The shock of finding her gone when he reached home gave a new turn to his feelings . She had made no mystery of her destination , leaving word with the servants that she had gone to town to see Mr. Langhope ; and Amherst found a note from her on his study table . "
153171	153175	153168	153168	I	0	" she wrote , "
153255	154203	153234	153234	I	0	" The brevity and simplicity of the note were characteristic ; in moments of high tension Justine was always calm and direct . And it was like her , too , not to make any covert appeal to his sympathy , not to seek to entrap his judgment by caressing words and plaintive allusions . The quiet tone in which she stated her purpose matched the firmness and courage of the act , and for a moment Amherst was shaken by a revulsion of feeling . Her heart was level with his , after all -- if she had done wrong she would bear the brunt of it alone . It was so exactly what he himself would have felt and done in such a situation that faith in her flowed back through all the dried channels of his heart . But an instant later the current set the other way . The wretched years of his first marriage had left in him a residue of distrust , a tendency to dissociate every act from its ostensible motive . He had been too profoundly the dupe of his own enthusiasm not to retain this streak of scepticism , and it now moved him to ask if Justine 's sudden departure had not been prompted by some other cause than the one she avowed . Had that alone actuated her , why not have told it to him , and asked his consent to her plan ? Why let him leave the house without a hint of her purpose , and slip off by the first train as soon as he was safe at Westmore ? Might it not be that she had special reasons for wishing Mr. Langhope to _ hear her own version first_--that there were questions she wished to parry herself , explanations she could trust no one to make for her ? The thought plunged Amherst into deeper misery . He knew not how to defend himself against these disintegrating suspicions -- he felt only that , once the accord between two minds is broken , it is less easy to restore than the passion between two hearts . He dragged heavily through his solitary evening , and awaited with dread and yet impatience a message announcing his wife 's return . * * * * * It would have been easier -- far easier -- when she left Mr. Langhope 's door , to go straight out into the darkness and let it close in on her for good . Justine felt herself yielding to the spell of that suggestion as she walked along the lamplit pavement , hardly conscious of the turn her steps were taking . The door of the house which a few weeks before had been virtually hers had closed on her without a question . She had been suffered to go out into the darkness without being asked whither she was going , or under what roof her night would be spent . The contrast between her past and present sounded through the tumult of her thoughts like the evil laughter of temptation . The house at Hanaford , to which she was returning , would look at her with the same alien face -- nowhere on earth , at that moment , was a door which would open to her like the door of home . In her painful self - absorption she followed the side street toward Madison Avenue , and struck southward down that tranquil thoroughfare . There was a physical relief in rapid motion , and she walked on , still hardly aware of her direction , toward the clustered lights of Madison Square . Should she return to Hanaford , she had still several hours to dispose of before the departure of the midnight train ; and if she did not return , hours and dates no longer existed for her . It would be easier -- infinitely easier -- not to go back . To take up her life with Amherst would , under any circumstances , be painful enough ; to take it up under the tacit restriction of her pledge to Mr. Langhope seemed more than human courage could face . As she approached the square she had almost reached the conclusion that such a temporary renewal was beyond her strength -- beyond what any standard of duty exacted . The question of an alternative hardly troubled her . She would simply go on living , and find an escape in work and material hardship . It would not be hard for so inconspicuous a person to slip back into the obscure mass of humanity . She paused a moment on the edge of the square , vaguely seeking a direction for her feet that might permit the working of her thoughts to go on uninterrupted ; and as she stood there , her eyes fell on the bench near the corner of Twenty - sixth Street , where she had sat with Amherst on the day of his flight from Lynbrook . He too had dreamed of escaping from insoluble problems into the clear air of hard work and simple duties ; and she remembered the words with which she had turned him back . The cases , of course , were not identical , since he had been flying in anger and wounded pride from a situation for which he was in no wise to blame ; yet , if even at such a moment she had insisted on charity and forbearance , how could she now show less self - denial than she had exacted of him ? "
154234	154753	154754	154754	I	0	" That was how she had put it to him , and how , with the mere change of a name , she must now , for reasons as cogent , put it to herself . It was just as much a part of the course she had planned to return to her husband now , and take up their daily life together , as it would , later on , be her duty to drop out of that life , when her doing so could no longer involve him in the penalty to be paid . She stood a little while looking at the bench on which they had sat , and giving thanks in her heart for the past strength which was now helping to build up her failing courage : such a patchwork business are our best endeavours , yet so faithfully does each weak upward impulse reach back a hand to the next . * * * * * Justine 's explanation of her visit to Mr. Langhope was not wholly satisfying to her husband . She did not conceal from him that the scene had been painful , but she gave him to understand , as briefly as possible , that Mr. Langhope , after his first movement of uncontrollable distress , had seemed able to make allowances for the pressure under which she had acted , and that he had , at any rate , given no sign of intending to let her confession make any change in the relation between the households . If she did not -- as Amherst afterward recalled -- put all this specifically into words , she contrived to convey it in her manner , in her allusions , above all in her recovered composure . She had the demeanour of one who has gone through a severe test of strength , but come out of it in complete control of the situation . There was something slightly unnatural in this prompt solution of so complicated a difficulty , and it had the effect of making Amherst ask himself what , to produce such a result , must have been the gist of her communication to Mr. Langhope . If the latter had shown any disposition to be cruel , or even unjust , Amherst 's sympathies would have rushed instantly to his wife 's defence ; but the fact that there was apparently to be no call on them left his reason free to compare and discriminate , with the final result that the more he pondered on his father - in - law 's attitude the less intelligible it became . A few days after Justine 's return he was called to New York on business ; and before leaving he told her that he should of course take the opportunity of having a talk with Mr. Langhope . She received the statement with the gentle composure from which she had not departed since her return from town ; and he added tentatively , as if to provoke her to a clearer expression of feeling : "

This was , after all , the turning - point in their lives : everything depended on how Mr. Langhope had "

Amherst 's face showed signs of emotional havoc : when feeling once broke out in him it had full play , and she could see that his hour with Mr. Langhope had struck to the roots of life . But the resultant expression was one of invigoration , not defeat ; and she gathered at a glance that her partner had not betrayed her . She drew a tragic solace from the success of her achievement ; yet it flung her into her husband 's arms with a passion of longing to which , as she instantly felt , he did not as completely respond . There was still , then , something "

The perception was painful enough , yet not as painful as another discovery that awaited her . She too had her tasks at Westmore : the supervision of the hospital , the day nursery , the mothers ' club , and the various other organizations whereby she and Amherst were trying to put some sort of social unity into the lives of the mill - hands ; and when , on the day after his return from New York , she presented herself , as usual , at the Westmore office , where she was in the habit of holding a brief consultation with him before starting on her rounds , she was at once aware of a new tinge of constraint in his manner . It hurt him , then , to see her at Westmore -- hurt him more than to live with her , at Hanaford , under Bessy 's roof ! For it was there , at the mills , that his real life was led , the life with which Justine had been most identified , the life that had been made possible for both by the magnanimity of that other woman whose presence was now forever between them . Justine made no sign . She resumed her work as though unconscious of any change ; but whereas in the past they had always found pretexts for seeking each other out , to discuss the order of the day 's work , or merely to warm their hearts by a rapid word or two , now each went a separate way , sometimes not meeting till they regained the house at night - fall . And as the weeks passed she began to understand that , by a strange inversion of probability , the relation between Amherst and herself was to be the means of holding her to her compact with Mr. Langhope -- if indeed it were not nearer the truth to say that it had made such a compact unnecessary . Amherst had done his best to take up their life together as though there had been no break in it ; but slowly the fact was being forced on her that by remaining with him she was subjecting him to intolerable suffering -- was coming to be the personification of the very thoughts and associations from which he struggled to escape . Happily her promptness of action had preserved Westmore to him , and in Westmore she believed that he would in time find a refuge from even the memory of what he was now enduring . But meanwhile her presence kept the thought alive ; and , had every other incentive lost its power , this would have been enough to sustain her . Fate had , ironically enough , furnished her with an unanswerable reason for leaving Amherst ; the impossibility of their keeping up such a relation as now existed between them would soon become too patent to be denied . Meanwhile , as summer approached , she knew that external conditions would also call upon her to act . The visible signal for her withdrawal would be Cicely 's next visit to Westmore . The child 's birthday fell in early June ; and Amherst , some months previously , had asked that she should be permitted to spend it at Hanaford , and that it should be chosen as the date for the opening of the first model cottages at Hopewood . It was Justine who had originated the idea of associating Cicely 's anniversaries with some significant moment in the annals of the mill colony ; and struck by the happy suggestion , he had at once applied himself to hastening on the work at Hopewood . The eagerness of both Amherst and Justine that Cicely should be identified with the developing life of Westmore had been one of the chief influences in reconciling Mr. Langhope to his son - in - law 's second marriage . Husband and wife had always made it clear that they regarded themselves as the mere trustees of the Westmore revenues , and that Cicely 's name should , as early as possible , be associated with every measure taken for the welfare of the people . But now , as Justine knew , the situation was changed ; and Cicely would not be allowed to come to Hanaford until she herself had left it . The manifold threads of divination that she was perpetually throwing out in Amherst 's presence told her , without word or sign on his part , that he also awaited Cicely 's birthday as a determining date in their lives . He spoke confidently , and as a matter of course , of Mr. Langhope 's bringing his grand - daughter at the promised time ; but Justine could hear a note of challenge in his voice , as though he felt that Mr. Langhope 's sincerity had not yet been put to the test . As the time drew nearer it became more difficult for her to decide just how she should take the step she had determined on . She had no material anxiety for the future , for although she did not mean to accept a penny from her husband after she had left him , she knew it would be easy for her to take up her nursing again ; and she knew also that her hospital connections would enable her to find work in a part of the country far enough distant to remove her entirely from his life . But she had not yet been able to invent a reason for leaving that should be convincing enough to satisfy him , without directing his suspicions to the truth . As she revolved the question she suddenly recalled an exclamation of Amherst's -- a word spoken as they entered Mr. Langhope 's door , on the fatal afternoon when she had found Wyant 's letter awaiting her . "
156638	156882	156634	156636	you little Jesuit	4570	" She had laughed in pure joy at his praise of her ; for every bantering phrase had then been a caress . But now the words returned with a sinister meaning . She knew they were true as far as Amherst was concerned : in the arts of casuistry and equivocation a child could have outmatched him , and she had only to exert her will to dupe him as deeply as she pleased . Well ! the task was odious , but it was needful : it was the bitterest part of her expiation that she must deceive him once more to save him from the results of her former deception . This decision once reached , every nerve in her became alert for an opportunity to do the thing and have it over ; so that , whenever they were alone together , she was in an attitude of perpetual tension , her whole mind drawn up for its final spring . The decisive word came , one evening toward the end of May , in the form of an allusion on Amherst 's part to Cicely 's approaching visit . Husband and wife were seated in the drawing - room after dinner , he with a book in hand , she bending , as usual , over the needlework which served at once as a pretext for lowered eyes , and as a means of disguising her fixed preoccupation .

But suddenly , as she was about to speak , there came to her the feeling which , up to one fatal moment in their lives , had always ruled their intercourse -- the feeling that there must be truth , and absolute truth , between them . Absolute , indeed , it could never be again , since he must never know of the condition exacted by Mr. Langhope ; but that , at the moment , seemed almost a secondary motive compared to the deeper influences that were inexorably forcing them apart . At any rate , she would trump up no trivial excuse for the step she had resolved on ; there should be truth , if not the whole truth , in this last decisive hour between them . "

Oh , if he refused to let her go -- if he caught her to him , and defied the world to part them -- what then of her pledge to Mr. Langhope , what then of her resolve to pay the penalty alone ? But in the space of a heart - beat she knew that peril -- that longed - for peril!--was past . Her husband had remained silent -- he neither moved toward her nor looked at her ; and she felt in every slackening nerve that in the end he would let her go . XL MR . LANGHOPE , tossing down a note on Mrs. Ansell 's drawing - room table , commanded imperiously : "

Mr. Langhope had changed greatly in the last three months ; and as he stood there in the clear light of the June afternoon it came to her that he had at last suffered the sudden collapse which is the penalty of youth preserved beyond its time .

It was becoming difficult for Mr. Langhope to guide his movements about her small encumbered room ; and he had always liked being waited on . * * * * * Mrs. Ansell 's prognostication proved correct . When Mr. Langhope and Cicely arrived at Hanaford they found Amherst alone to receive them . He explained briefly that his wife had been unwell , and had gone to seek rest and change at the house of an old friend in the west . Mr. Langhope expressed a decent amount of regret , and the subject was dropped as if by common consent . Cicely , however , was not so easily silenced . Poor Bessy 's uncertain fits of tenderness had produced more bewilderment than pleasure in her sober - minded child ; but the little girl 's feelings and perceptions had developed rapidly in the equable atmosphere of her step - mother 's affection . Cicely had reached the age when children put their questions with as much ingenuity as persistence , and both Mr. Langhope and Amherst longed for Mrs. Ansell 's aid in parrying her incessant interrogations as to the cause and length of Justine 's absence , what she had said before going , and what promise she had made about coming back . But Mrs. Ansell had not come to Hanaford . Though it had become a matter of habit to include her in the family pilgrimages to the mills she had firmly maintained the plea of more urgent engagements ; and the two men , with only Cicely between them , had spent the long days and longer evenings in unaccustomed and unmitigated propinquity . Mr. Langhope , before leaving , thought it proper to touch tentatively on his promise of giving Cicely to Amherst for the summer ; but to his surprise the latter , after a moment of hesitation , replied that he should probably go to Europe for two or three months .

During his previous European pilgrimages his interest had by no means been restricted to sociological questions : the appeal of an old civilization , reaching him through its innumerable forms of tradition and beauty , had roused that side of his imagination which his work at home left untouched . But upon his present state of deep moral commotion the spells of art and history were powerless to work . The foundations of his life had been shaken , and the fair exterior of the world was as vacant as a maniac 's face . He could only take refuge in his special task , barricading himself against every expression of beauty and poetry as so many poignant reminders of a phase of life that he was vainly trying to cast off and forget . Even his work had been embittered to him , thrust out of its place in the ordered scheme of things . It had cost him a hard struggle to hold fast to his main purpose , to convince himself that his real duty lay , not in renouncing the Westmore money and its obligations , but in carrying out his projected task as if nothing had occurred to affect his personal relation to it . The mere fact that such a renunciation would have been a deliberate moral suicide , a severing once for all of every artery of action , made it take on , at first , the semblance of an obligation , a sort of higher duty to the abstract conception of what he owed himself . But Justine had not erred in her forecast . Once she had passed out of his life , it was easier for him to return to a dispassionate view of his situation , to see , and boldly confess to himself that he saw , the still higher duty of sticking to his task , instead of sacrificing it to any ideal of personal disinterestedness . It was this gradual process of adjustment that saved him from the desolating scepticism which falls on the active man when the sources of his activity are tainted . Having accepted his fate , having consented to see in himself merely the necessary agent of a good to be done , he could escape from self - questioning only by shutting himself up in the practical exigencies of his work , closing his eyes and his thoughts to everything which had formerly related it to a wider world , had given meaning and beauty to life as a whole . The return from Europe , and the taking up of the daily routine at Hanaford , were the most difficult phases in this process of moral adaptation . Justine 's departure had at first brought relief . He had been too sincere with himself to oppose her wish to leave Hanaford for a time , since he believed that , for her as well as for himself , a temporary separation would be less painful than a continuance of their actual relation . But as the weeks passed into months he found he was no nearer to a clear view of his own case : the future was still dark and enigmatic . Justine 's desire to leave him had revived his unformulated distrust of her . What could it mean but that there were thoughts within her which could not be at rest in his presence ? He had given her every proof of his wish to forget the past , and Mr. Langhope had behaved with unequalled magnanimity . Yet Justine 's unhappiness was evident : she could not conceal her longing to escape from the conditions her act had created . Was it because , in reality , she was conscious of other motives than the one she acknowledged ? She had insisted , almost unfeelingly as it might have seemed , on the abstract rightness of what she had done , on the fact that , ideally speaking , her act could not be made less right , less justifiable , by the special accidental consequences that had flowed from it . Because these consequences had caught her in a web of tragic fatality she would not be guilty of the weakness of tracing back the disaster to any intrinsic error in her original motive . Why , then , if this was her real , her proud attitude toward the past -- and since those about her believed in her sincerity , and accepted her justification as valid from her point of view if not from theirs -- why had she not been able to maintain her posture , to carry on life on the terms she had exacted from others ? A special circumstance contributed to this feeling of distrust ; the fact , namely , that Justine , a week after her departure from Hanaford , had written to say that she could not , from that moment till her return , consent to accept any money from Amherst . As her manner was , she put her reasons clearly and soberly , without evasion or ambiguity . "
160050	160054	160100	160100	you	3209	" she wrote , "
160188	161353	160186	160186	Westmore	167	" On reading this , Amherst 's mind had gone through the strange dual process which now marked all his judgments of his wife . At first he had fancied he understood her , and had felt that he should have done as she did ; then the usual reaction of distrust set in , and he asked himself why she , who had so little of the conventional attitude toward money , should now develop this unexpected susceptibility . And so the old question presented itself in another shape : if she had nothing to reproach herself for , why was it intolerable to her to live on Bessy 's money ? The fact that she was doing no actual service at Westmore did not account for her scruples -- she would have been the last person to think that a sick servant should be docked of his pay . Her reluctance could come only from that hidden cause of compunction which had prompted her departure , and which now forced her to sever even the merely material links between herself and her past . Amherst , on his return to Hanaford , had tried to find in these considerations a reason for his deep unrest . It was his wife 's course which still cast a torturing doubt on what he had braced his will to accept and put behind him . And he now told himself that the perpetual galling sense of her absence was due to this uneasy consciousness of what it meant , of the dark secrets it enveloped and held back from him . In actual truth , every particle of his being missed her , he lacked her at every turn . She had been at once the partner of his task , and the _ pays bleu _ into which he escaped from it ; the vivifying thought which gave meaning to the life he had chosen , yet never let him forget that there was a larger richer life outside , to which he was rooted by deeper and more intrinsic things than any abstract ideal of altruism . His love had preserved his identity , saved him from shrinking into the mere nameless unit which the social enthusiast is in danger of becoming unless the humanitarian passion is balanced , and a little overweighed , by a merely human one . And now this equilibrium was lost forever , and his deepest pain lay in realizing that he could not regain it , even by casting off Westmore and choosing the narrower but richer individual existence that her love might once have offered . His life was in truth one indivisible organism , not two halves artificially united . Self and other - self were ingrown from the roots -- whichever portion fate restricted him to would be but a mutilated half - live fragment of the whole . Happily for him , chance made this crisis of his life coincide with a strike at Westmore . Soon after his return to Hanaford he found himself compelled to grapple with the hardest problem of his industrial career , and he was carried through the ensuing three months on that tide of swift obligatory action that sweeps the ship - wrecked spirit over so many sunken reefs of fear and despair . The knowledge that he was better able to deal with the question than any one who might conceivably have taken his place -- this conviction , which was presently confirmed by the peaceable adjustment of the strike , helped to make the sense of his immediate usefulness outbalance that other , disintegrating doubt as to the final value of such efforts . And so he tried to settle down into a kind of mechanical altruism , in which the reflexes of habit should take the place of that daily renewal of faith and enthusiasm which had been fed from the springs of his own joy . * * * * * The autumn came and passed into winter ; and after Mr. Langhope 's re - establishment in town Amherst began to resume his usual visits to his step - daughter . His natural affection for the little girl had been deepened by the unforeseen manner in which her fate had been entrusted to him . The thought of Bessy , softened to compunction by the discovery that her love had persisted under their apparently hopeless estrangement -- this feeling , intensified to the verge of morbidness by the circumstances attending her death , now sought expression in a passionate devotion to her child . Accident had , in short , created between Bessy and himself a retrospective sympathy which the resumption of life together would have dispelled in a week -- one of the exhalations from the past that depress the vitality of those who linger too near the grave of dead experiences . Since Justine 's departure Amherst had felt himself still more drawn to Cicely ; but his relation to the child was complicated by the fact that she would not be satisfied as to the cause of her step - mother 's absence . Whenever Amherst came to town , her first question was for Justine ; and her memory had the precocious persistence sometimes developed in children too early deprived of their natural atmosphere of affection . Cicely had always been petted and adored , at odd times and by divers people ; but some instinct seemed to tell her that , of all the tenderness bestowed on her , Justine 's most resembled the all - pervading motherly element in which the child 's heart expands without ever being conscious of its needs . If it had been embarrassing to evade Cicely 's questions in June it became doubly so as the months passed , and the pretext of Justine 's ill - health grew more and more difficult to sustain . And in the following March Amherst was suddenly called from Hanaford by the news that the little girl herself was ill . Serious complications had developed from a protracted case of scarlet fever , and for two weeks the child 's fate was uncertain . Then she began to recover , and in the joy of seeing life come back to her , Mr. Langhope and Amherst felt as though they must not only gratify every wish she expressed , but try to guess at those they saw floating below the surface of her clear vague eyes . It was noticeable to Mrs. Ansell , if not to the others , that one of these unexpressed wishes was the desire to see her stepmother . Cicely no longer asked for Justine ; but something in her silence , or in the gesture with which she gently put from her other offers of diversion and companionship , suddenly struck Mrs. Ansell as more poignant than speech .

XLI AMHERST , Cicely 's convalescence once assured , had been obliged to go back to Hanaford ; but some ten days later , on hearing from Mrs. Ansell that the little girl 's progress was less rapid than had been hoped , he returned to his father - in - law 's for a Sunday . He came two days after the talk recorded in the last chapter -- a talk of which Mrs. Ansell 's letter to him had been the direct result . She had promised Mr. Langhope that , in writing to Amherst , she would not go beyond the briefest statement of fact ; and she had kept her word , trusting to circumstances to speak for her . Mrs. Ansell , during Cicely 's illness , had formed the habit of dropping in on Mr. Langhope at the tea hour instead of awaiting him in her own drawing - room ; and on the Sunday in question she found him alone . Beneath his pleasure in seeing her , which had grown more marked as his dependence on her increased , she at once discerned traces of recent disturbance ; and her first question was for Cicely . He met it with a discouraged gesture . "

As the cup passed between them she dropped her eyes to his with a quick flash of interrogation ; but he sat staring moodily before him , and she moved back to the sofa without a word . * * * * * On the way downstairs she met Amherst descending from Cicely 's room . Since the early days of his first marriage there had always been , on Amherst 's side , a sense of obscure antagonism toward Mrs. Ansell . She was almost the embodied spirit of the world he dreaded and disliked : her serenity , her tolerance , her adaptability , seemed to smile away and disintegrate all the high enthusiasms , the stubborn convictions , that he had tried to plant in the shifting sands of his married life . And now that Bessy 's death had given her back the attributes with which his fancy had originally invested her , he had come to regard Mrs. Ansell as embodying the evil influences that had come between himself and his wife . Mrs. Ansell was probably not unaware of the successive transitions of feeling which had led up to this unflattering view ; but her life had been passed among petty rivalries and animosities , and she had the patience and adroitness of the spy in a hostile camp . She and Amherst exchanged a few words about Cicely ; then she exclaimed , with a glance through the panes of the hall door : "
163332	163391	163325	163326	the crossings	3240	" He could do no less , at that , than offer to guide her across the perils of Fifth Avenue ; and still talking of Cicely , she led him down the thronged thoroughfare till her own corner was reached , and then her own door ; turning there to ask , as if by an afterthought : "
163408	163509	163403	163403	I	0	" A shade of reluctance crossed his face , which , as the vestibule light fell on it , looked hard and tired , like a face set obstinately against a winter gale ; but he murmured a word of assent , and followed her into the shining steel cage of the lift . In her little drawing - room , among the shaded lamps and bowls of spring flowers , she pushed a chair forward , settled herself in her usual corner of the sofa , and said with a directness that seemed an echo of his own tone : "
163527	163567	163568	163568	You	0	" Amherst looked at her in surprise . Though his father - in - law 's health had been more or less unsatisfactory for the last year , all their concern , of late , had been for Cicely . "
163574	163603	163568	163568	You	0	" he enquired . She waited to draw off and smooth her gloves , with one of the deliberate gestures that served to shade and supplement her speech . "
163610	163656	163604	163604	I	0	" Amherst moved uneasily in his seat . He did not know where she meant the talk to lead them , but he guessed that it would be over painful places , and he saw no reason why he should be forced to follow her . "

163749	163758	163759	163759	She	3698	" Mrs. Ansell glanced up at him quickly . "
163764	163821	163759	163759	She	3698	" she said . The blood rose to his neck and temples , and he tightened his hand on the arm of his chair . But it was a part of Mrs. Ansell 's expertness to know when such danger signals must be heeded and when they might be ignored , and she went on quietly : "
163906	164168	163902	163902	Justine	241	" It was the first time in months that Amherst had heard his wife 's name spoken outside of his own house . No one but his mother mentioned Justine to him now ; and of late even his mother had dropped her enquiries and allusions , prudently acquiescing in the habit of silence which his own silence had created about him . To hear the name again -- the two little syllables which had been the key of life to him , and now shook him as the turning of a rusted lock shakes a long - closed door -- to hear her name spoken familiarly , affectionately , as one speaks of some one who may come into the room the next moment -- gave him a shock that was half pain , and half furtive unacknowledged joy . Men whose conscious thoughts are mostly projected outward , on the world of external activities , may be more moved by such a touch on the feelings than those who are perpetually testing and tuning their emotional chords . Amherst had foreseen from the first that Mrs. Ansell might mean to speak of his wife ; but though he had intended , if she did so , to cut their talk short , he now felt himself irresistibly constrained to hear her out . Mrs. Ansell , having sped her shaft , followed its flight through lowered lashes , and saw that it had struck a vulnerable point ; but she was far from assuming that the day was won . "

164208	164310	164199	164199	he	120	" No one but Mrs. Ansell -- and perhaps she knew it -- could have pushed so far beyond the conventional limits of discretion without seeming to overstep them by a hair ; and she had often said , when pressed for the secret of her art , that it consisted simply in knowing the pass - word . That word once spoken , she might have added , the next secret was to give the enemy no time for resistance ; and though she saw the frown reappear between Amherst 's eyes , she went on , without heeding it : "
164325	164341	164311	164311	I	0	" He reddened again , and pushed back his chair , as if to rise . "

Why else , indeed , should she have left him ? He stood motionless for a while ; then he approached Mrs. Ansell and said : "
164826	164879	164695	164695	His----	3252	" She drew farther back into her corner of the sofa , waving him to a seat beside her , as though to bring his inquisitory eyes on a level where her own could command them ; but he stood where he was , unconscious of her gesture , and merely repeating : "
164883	164914	164695	164695	His----	3252	" She may have said to herself that a woman would have needed no farther telling ; but to him she only replied , slanting her head up to his : "
164940	164997	164999	164999	he	3256	" He dropped down beside her at that , grasping the back of the sofa as if he wanted something to clutch and throttle . The veins swelled in his temples , and as he pushed back his tossed hair Mrs. Ansell noticed for the first time how gray it had grown on the under side . "

And her resolve to discharge the debt had been taken in a flash , as soon as she had seen that man can commit no act alone , whether for good or evil . The extent to which Amherst 's fate was involved in hers had become clear to her with his first word of reassurance , of faith in her motive . And instantly a plan for releasing him had leapt full - formed into her mind , and had been carried out with swift unflinching resolution . As he forced himself , now , to look down the suddenly illuminated past to the weeks which had elapsed between her visit to Mr. Langhope and her departure from Hanaford , he wondered not so much at her swiftness of resolve as at her firmness in carrying out her plan -- and he saw , with a blinding flash of insight , that it was in her love for him that she had found her strength . In all moments of strong mental tension he became totally unconscious of time and place , and he now remained silent so long , his hands clasped behind him , his eyes fixed on an indeterminate point in space , that Mrs. Ansell at length rose and laid a questioning touch on his arm .

XLII JUSTINE 'S answer to her husband 's letter bore a New York address ; and the surprise of finding her in the same town with himself , and not half an hour 's walk from the room in which he sat , was so great that it seemed to demand some sudden and violent outlet of physical movement . He thrust the letter in his pocket , took up his hat , and leaving the house , strode up Fifth Avenue toward the Park in the early spring sunlight . The news had taken five days to reach him , for in order to reestablish communication with his wife he had been obliged to write to Michigan , with the request that his letter should be forwarded . He had never supposed that Justine would be hard to find , or that she had purposely enveloped her movements in mystery . When she ceased to write he had simply concluded that , like himself , she felt the mockery of trying to keep up a sort of distant , semi - fraternal relation , marked by the occasional interchange of inexpressive letters . The inextricable mingling of thought and sensation which made the peculiar closeness of their union could never , to such direct and passionate natures , be replaced by the pretense of a temperate friendship . Feeling thus himself , and instinctively assuming the same feeling in his wife , Amherst had respected her silence , her wish to break definitely with their former life . She had written him , in the autumn , that she intended to leave Michigan for a few months , but that , in any emergency , a letter addressed to her friend 's house would reach her ; and he had taken this as meaning that , unless the emergency arose , she preferred that their correspondence should cease . Acquiescence was all the easier because it accorded with his own desire . It seemed to him , as he looked back , that the love he and Justine had felt for each other was like some rare organism which could maintain life only in its special element ; and that element was neither passion nor sentiment , but truth . It was only on the heights that they could breathe . Some men , in his place , even while accepting the inevitableness of the moral rupture , would have felt concerned for the material side of the case . But it was characteristic of Amherst that this did not trouble him . He took it for granted that his wife would return to her nursing . From the first he had felt certain that it would be intolerable to her to accept aid from him , and that she would choose rather to support herself by the exercise of her regular profession ; and , aside from such motives , he , who had always turned to hard work as the rarest refuge from personal misery , thought it natural that she should seek the same means of escape . He had therefore not been surprised , on opening her letter that morning , to learn that she had taken up her hospital work ; but in the amazement of finding her so near he hardly grasped her explanation of the coincidence . There was something about a Buffalo patient suddenly ordered to New York for special treatment , and refusing to go in with a new nurse -- but these details made no impression on his mind , which had only room for the fact that chance had brought his wife back at the very moment when his whole being yearned for her . She wrote that , owing to her duties , she would be unable to see him till three that afternoon ; and he had still six hours to consume before their meeting . But in spirit they had met already -- they were one in an intensity of communion which , as he strode northward along the bright crowded thoroughfare , seemed to gather up the whole world into one throbbing point of life . He had a boyish wish to keep the secret of his happiness to himself , not to let Mr. Langhope or Mrs. Ansell know of his meeting with Justine till it was over ; and after twice measuring the length of the Park he turned in at one of the little wooden restaurants which were beginning to unshutter themselves in anticipation of spring custom . If only he could have seen Justine that morning ! If he could have brought her there , and they could have sat opposite each other , in the bare empty room , with sparrows bustling and twittering in the lilacs against the open window ! The room was ugly enough -- but how she would have delighted in the delicate green of the near slopes , and the purplish haze of the woods beyond ! She took a childish pleasure in such small adventures , and had the knack of giving a touch of magic to their most commonplace details . Amherst , as he finished his cold beef and indifferent eggs , found himself boyishly planning to bring her back there the next day .... Then , over the coffee , he re - read her letter . The address she gave was that of a small private hospital , and she explained that she would have to receive him in the public parlour , which at that hour was open to other visitors . As the time approached , the thought that they might not be alone when they met became insufferable ; and he determined , if he found any one else , in possession of the parlour , to wait in the hall , and meet her as she came down the stairs . He continued to elaborate this plan as he walked back slowly through the Park , He had timed himself to reach the hospital a little before three ; but though it lacked five minutes to the hour when he entered the parlour , two women were already seated in one of its windows . They looked around as he came in , evidently as much annoyed by his appearance as he had been to find them there . The older of the two showed a sallow middle - aged face beneath her limp crape veil ; the other was a slight tawdry creature , with nodding feathers , and innumerable chains and bracelets which she fingered ceaselessly as she talked . They eyed Amherst with resentment , and then turned away , continuing their talk in low murmurs , while he seated himself at the marble - topped table littered with torn magazines . Now and then the younger woman 's voice rose in a shrill staccato , and a phrase or two floated over to him . "

167445	167464	167439	167439	he	3269	" the older woman protestingly murmured ; but the other , unappeased , rejoined with ominously nodding plumes : "
167486	167621	167623	167623	you	3269	" Amherst started up nervously , and as he did so the clock struck three , and he opened the door and passed out into the hall . It was paved with black and white marble ; the walls were washed in a dull yellowish tint , and the prevalent odour of antiseptics was mingled with a stale smell of cooking . At the back rose a straight staircase carpeted with brass - bound India - rubber , like a ship 's companion - way ; and down that staircase she would come in a moment -- he fancied he heard her step now .... But the step was that of an elderly black - gowned woman in a cap -- the matron probably . She glanced at Amherst in surprise , and asked : "
167629	167646	167623	167623	you	3269	" He made a motion of assent , and she opened the parlour door , saying : "

167660	167671	167654	167654	I	0	" he urged . She looked at him more attentively . "
167691	167998	167681	167681	You	3269	" Mildly but firmly she drove him in before her , and closing the door , advanced to the two women in the window . Amherst 's hopes leapt up : perhaps she had come to fetch the visitors upstairs ! He strained his ears to catch what was being said , and while he was thus absorbed the door opened , and turning at the sound he found himself face to face with his wife . He had not reflected that Justine would be in her nurse 's dress ; and the sight of the dark blue uniform and small white cap , in which he had never seen her since their first meeting in the Hope Hospital , obliterated all bitter and unhappy memories , and gave him the illusion of passing back at once into the clear air of their early friendship . Then he looked at her and remembered . He noticed that she had grown thinner than ever , or rather that her thinness , which had formerly had a healthy reed - like strength , now suggested fatigue and languor . And her face was spent , extinguished -- the very eyes were lifeless . All her vitality seemed to have withdrawn itself into the arch of dense black hair which still clasped her forehead like the noble metal of some antique bust . The sight stirred him with a deeper pity , a more vehement compunction ; but the impulse to snatch her to him , and seek his pardon on her lips , was paralyzed by the sense that the three women in the window had stopped talking and turned their heads toward the door . He held his hand out , and Justine 's touched it for a moment ; then he said in a low voice : "
168010	168017	168018	168018	I	0	" She made a negative gesture . "
168026	168065	168018	168018	I	0	" Ah , her deep sweet voice -- how completely his ear had lost the sound of it ! She looked doubtfully about the room , and pointed to a sofa at the end farthest from the windows . "
168071	168439	168018	168018	I	0	" she said . He followed her in silence , and they sat down side by side . The matron had drawn up a chair and resumed her whispered conference with the women in the window . Between the two groups stretched the bare length of the room , broken only by a few arm - chairs of stained wood , and the marble - topped table covered with magazines . The impossibility of giving free rein to his feelings developed in Amherst an unwonted intensity of perception , as though a sixth sense had suddenly emerged to take the place of those he could not use . And with this new - made faculty he seemed to gather up , and absorb into himself , as he had never done in their hours of closest communion , every detail of his wife 's person , of her face and hands and gestures . He noticed how her full upper lids , of the tint of yellowish ivory , had a slight bluish discolouration , and how little thread - like blue veins ran across her temples to the roots of her hair . The emaciation of her face , and the hollow shades beneath her cheek - bones , made her mouth seem redder and fuller , though a little line on each side , where it joined the cheek , gave it a tragic droop . And her hands ! When her fingers met his he recalled having once picked up , in the winter woods , the little feather - light skeleton of a frozen bird -- and that was what her touch was like . And it was he who had brought her to this by his cruelty , his obtuseness , his base readiness to believe the worst of her ! He did not want to pour himself out in self - accusation -- that seemed too easy a way of escape . He wanted simply to take her in his arms , to ask her to give him one more chance -- and then to show her ! And all the while he was paralyzed by the group in the window . "

The anniversary was to coincide , this year , with the opening of the old house at Hopewood , as a kind of pleasure - palace -- gymnasium , concert - hall and museum -- for the recreation of the mill - hands . The idea had first come to Amherst on the winter afternoon when Bessy Westmore had confessed her love for him under the snow - laden trees of Hopewood . Even then the sense that his personal happiness was enlarged and secured by its promise of happiness to others had made him wish that the scene associated with the opening of his new life should be made to commemorate a corresponding change in the fortunes of Westmore . But when the control of the mills passed into his hands other and more necessary improvements pressed upon him ; and it was not till now that the financial condition of the company had permitted the execution of his plan . Justine , on her return to Hanaford , had found the work already in progress , and had been told by her husband that he was carrying out a projected scheme of Bessy 's . She had felt a certain surprise , but had concluded that the plan in question dated back to the early days of his first marriage , when , in his wife 's eyes , his connection with the mills still invested them with interest . Since Justine had come back to her husband , both had tacitly avoided all allusions to the past , and the recreation - house at Hopewood being , as she divined , in some sort an expiatory offering to Bessy 's plaintive shade , she had purposely refrained from questioning Amherst about its progress , and had simply approved the plans he submitted to her . Fourteen months had passed since her return , and now , as she sat beside her husband in the carriage which was conveying them to Hopewood , she said to herself that her life had at last fallen into what promised to be its final shape -- that as things now were they would probably be to the end . And outwardly at least they were what she and Amherst had always dreamed of their being . Westmore prospered under the new rule . The seeds of life they had sown there were springing up in a promising growth of bodily health and mental activity , and above all in a dawning social consciousness . The mill - hands were beginning to understand the meaning of their work , in its relation to their own lives and to the larger economy . And outwardly , also , the new growth was showing itself in the humanized aspect of the place . Amherst 's young maples were tall enough now to cast a shade on the grass - bordered streets ; and the well - kept turf , the bright cottage gardens , the new central group of library , hospital and club - house , gave to the mill - village the hopeful air of a "
169939	170702	170706	170706	thou	3286	" residential suburb . In the bright June light , behind their fresh green mantle of trees and creepers , even the factory buildings looked less stern and prison - like than formerly ; and the turfing and planting of the adjoining river - banks had transformed a waste of foul mud and refuse into a little park where the operatives might refresh themselves at midday . Yes -- Westmore was alive at last : the dead city of which Justine had once spoken had risen from its grave , and its blank face had taken on a meaning . As Justine glanced at her husband she saw that the same thought was in his mind . However achieved , at whatever cost of personal misery and error , the work of awakening and freeing Westmore was done , and that work had justified itself . She looked from Amherst to Cicely , who sat opposite , eager and rosy in her mourning frock -- for Mr. Langhope had died some two months previously -- and as intent as her step - parents on the scene before her . Cicely was old enough now to regard her connection with Westmore as something more than a nursery game . She was beginning to learn a great deal about the mills , and to understand , in simple , friendly ways , something of her own relation to them . The work and play of the children , the interests and relaxations provided for their elders , had been gradually explained to her by Justine , and she knew that this shining tenth birthday of hers was to throw its light as far as the clouds of factory - smoke extended . As they mounted the slope to Hopewood , the spacious white building , with its enfolding colonnades , its broad terraces and tennis - courts , shone through the trees like some bright country - house adorned for its master 's home - coming ; and Amherst and his wife might have been driving up to the house which had been built to shelter their wedded happiness . The thought flashed across Justine as their carriage climbed the hill . She was as much absorbed as Amherst in the welfare of Westmore , it had become more and more , to both , the refuge in which their lives still met and mingled ; but for a moment , as they paused before the flower - decked porch , and he turned to help her from the carriage , it occurred to her to wonder what her sensations would have been if he had been bringing her home -- to a real home of their own -- instead of accompanying her to another philanthropic celebration . But what need had they of a real home , when they no longer had any real life of their own ? Nothing was left of that secret inner union which had so enriched and beautified their outward lives . Since Justine 's return to Hanaford they had entered , tacitly , almost unconsciously , into a new relation to each other : a relation in which their personalities were more and more merged in their common work , so that , as it were , they met only by avoiding each other . From the first , Justine had accepted this as inevitable ; just as she had understood , when Amherst had sought her out in New York , that his remaining at Westmore , which had once been contingent on her leaving him , now depended on her willingness to return and take up their former life . She accepted the last condition as she had accepted the other , pledged to the perpetual expiation of an act for which , in the abstract , she still refused to hold herself to blame . But life is not a matter of abstract principles , but a succession of pitiful compromises with fate , of concessions to old tradition , old beliefs , old charities and frailties . That was what her act had taught her -- that was the word of the gods to the mortal who had laid a hand on their bolts . And she had humbled herself to accept the lesson , seeing human relations at last as a tangled and deep - rooted growth , a dark forest through which the idealist can not cut his straight path without hearing at each stroke the cry of the severed branch : "
170710	171030	169352	169352	you	0	" * * * * * The lawns leading up to the house were already sprinkled with holiday - makers , while along the avenue came the rolling of wheels , the throb of motor - cars ; and Justine , with Cicely beside her , stood in the wide hall to receive the incoming throng , in which Hanaford society was indiscriminately mingled with the operatives in their Sunday best . While his wife welcomed the new arrivals , Amherst , supported by some young Westmore cousins , was guiding them into the concert - hall , where he was to say a word on the uses of the building before declaring it open for inspection . And presently Justine and Cicely , summoned by Westy Gaines , made their way through the rows of seats to a corner near the platform . Her husband was there already , with Halford Gaines and a group of Hanaford dignitaries , and just below them sat Mrs. Gaines and her daughters , the Harry Dressels , and Amherst 's radiant mother . As Justine passed between them , she wondered how much they knew of the events which had wrought so profound and permanent change in her life . She had never known how Hanaford explained her absence or what comments it had made on her return . But she saw to - day more clearly than ever that Amherst had become a power among his townsmen , and that if they were still blind to the inner meaning of his work , its practical results were beginning to impress them profoundly . Hanaford 's sociological creed was largely based on commercial considerations , and Amherst had won Hanaford 's esteem by the novel feat of defying its economic principles and snatching success out of his defiance . And now he had advanced a step or two in front of the "
171032	171243	169352	169352	you	0	" semi - circle on the platform , and was beginning to speak . Justine did not hear his first words . She was looking up at him , trying to see him with the eyes of the crowd , and wondering what manner of man he would have seemed to her if she had known as little as they did of his inner history . He held himself straight , the heavy locks thrown back from his forehead , one hand resting on the table beside him , the other grasping a folded blue - print which the architect of the building had just advanced to give him . As he stood there , Justine recalled her first sight of him in the Hope Hospital , five years earlier -- was it only five years ? They had dealt deep strokes to his face , hollowing the eye - sockets , accentuating the strong modelling of nose and chin , fixing the lines between the brows ; but every touch had a meaning -- it was not the languid hand of time which had remade his features , but the sharp chisel of thought and action . She roused herself suddenly to the consciousness of what he was saying . "

171570	172084	172091	172091	I	0	" Justine had listened with deepening amazement . She was seated so close to her husband that she had recognized the blue - print the moment he unrolled it . There was no mistaking its origin -- it was simply the plan of the gymnasium which Bessy had intended to build at Lynbrook , and which she had been constrained to abandon owing to her husband 's increased expenditure at the mills . But how was it possible that Amherst knew nothing of the original purpose of the plans , and by what mocking turn of events had a project devised in deliberate defiance of his wishes , and intended to declare his wife 's open contempt for them , been transformed into a Utopian vision for the betterment of the Westmore operatives ? A wave of anger swept over Justine at this last derisive stroke of fate . It was grotesque and pitiable that a man like Amherst should create out of his regrets a being who had never existed , and then ascribe to her feelings and actions of which the real woman had again and again proved herself incapable ! Ah , no , Justine had suffered enough -- but to have this imaginary Bessy called from the grave , dressed in a semblance of self - devotion and idealism , to see her petty impulses of vindictiveness disguised as the motions of a lofty spirit -- it was as though her small malicious ghost had devised this way of punishing the wife who had taken her place ! Justine had suffered enough -- suffered deliberately and unstintingly , paying the full price of her error , not seeking to evade its least consequence . But no sane judgment could ask her to sit quiet under this last hallucination . What ! This unreal woman , this phantom that Amherst 's uneasy imagination had evoked , was to come between himself and her , to supplant her first as his wife , and then as his fellow - worker ? Why should she not cry out the truth to him , defend herself against the dead who came back to rob her of such wedded peace as was hers ? She had only to tell the true story of the plans to lay poor Bessy 's ghost forever ! The confused throbbing impulses within her were stifled under a long burst of applause -- then she saw Westy Gaines at her side again , and understood that he had come to lead Cicely to the platform . For a moment she clung jealously to the child 's hand , hardly aware of what she did , feeling only that she was being thrust farther and farther into the background of the life she had helped to call out of chaos . Then a contrary impulse moved her . She gently freed Cicely 's hand , and a moment later , as she sat with bent head and throbbing breast , she heard the child 's treble piping out above her : "

172127	172411	172412	172412	You	3302	" ah , he had done poor Bessy justice ! And to think that till now Hanaford had never fully known how she had the welfare of the mills at heart -- how it was really only _ her _ work that he was carrying on there ! Well , he had made that perfectly clear -- and no doubt Cicely was being taught to follow in her mother 's footsteps : everyone had noticed how her step - father was associating her with the work at the mills . And his little speech would , as it were , consecrate the child 's relation to that work , make it appear to her as the continuance of a beautiful , a sacred tradition .... * * * * * And now it was over . The building had been inspected , the operatives had dispersed , the Hanaford company had rolled off down the avenue , Cicely , among them , driving away tired and happy in Mrs. Dressel 's victoria , and Amherst and his wife were alone . Amherst , after bidding good - bye to his last guests , had gone back to the empty concert - room to fetch the blue - print lying on the platform . He came back with it , between the uneven rows of empty chairs , and joined Justine , who stood waiting in the hall . His face was slightly flushed , and his eyes had the light which in happy moments burned through their veil of thought . He laid his hand on his wife 's arm , and drawing her toward a table spread out the blueprint before her . "
