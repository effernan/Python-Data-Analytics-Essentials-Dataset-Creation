My wife frets , and thinks she 's drowned herself , but I tell her , folks do n't care to put on their best clothes to drown themselves ; and Mrs. Bradshaw ( where she lodged , you know ) says the last time she set eyes on her was last Tuesday , when she came down stairs , dressed in her Sunday gown , and with a new ribbon in her bonnet , and gloves on her hands , like the lady she was so fond of thinking herself .

I never seed two such pretty women for sisters ; never . Not but what beauty is a sad snare . Here was Esther so puffed up , that there was no holding her in . Her spirit was always up , if I spoke ever so little in the way of advice to her ; my wife spoiled her , it is true , for you see she was so much older than Esther she was more like a mother to her , doing every thing for her .

My Mary shall never work in a factory , that I 'm determined on . You see Esther spent her money in dress , thinking to set off her pretty face ; and got to come home so late at night , that at last I told her my mind : my missis thinks I spoke crossly , but I meant right , for I loved Esther , if it was only for Mary 's sake . Says I , ' Esther , I see what you 'll end at with your artificials , and your fly - away veils , and stopping out when honest women are in their beds ; you 'll be a street - walker , Esther , and then , do n't you go to think I 'll have you darken my door , though my wife is your sister . ' So says she , ' Do n't trouble yourself , John . I 'll pack up and be off now , for I 'll never stay to hear myself called as you call me . ' She flushed up like a turkey - cock , and I thought fire would come out of her eyes ; but when she saw Mary cry ( for Mary ca n't abide words in a house ) , she went and kissed her , and said she was not so bad as I thought her . So we talked more friendly , for , as I said , I liked the lass well enough , and her pretty looks , and her cheery ways .

I have thought several times since , that she was a bit quieter , and more womanly - like ; more gentle , and more blushing , and not so riotous and noisy . She comes in , toward four o'clock , when afternoon church was loosing , and she goes and hangs her bonnet up on the old nail we used to call hers , while she lived with us . I remember thinking what a pretty lass she was , as she sat on a low stool by Mary , who was rocking herself , and in rather a poor way . She laughed and cried by turns , but all so softly and gently , like a child , that I could n't find in my heart to scold her , especially as Mary was fretting already .

4111	4549	4058	4058	he	557	" Why , she took leave of us that Sunday night in a very loving way , kissing both wife Mary , and daughter Mary ( if I must not call her little ) , and shaking hands with me ; but all in a cheerful sort of manner , so we thought nothing about her kisses and shakes . But on Wednesday night comes Mrs. Bradshaw 's son with Esther 's box , and presently Mrs. Bradshaw follows with the key ; and when we began to talk , we found Esther told her she was coming back to live with us , and would pay her week 's money for not giving notice ; and on Tuesday night she carried off a little bundle ( her best clothes were on her back , as I said before ) , and told Mrs. Bradshaw not to hurry herself about the big box , but bring it when she had time . So of course she thought she should find Esther with us ; and when she told her story , my missis set up such a screech , and fell down in a dead swoon . Mary ran up with water for her mother , and I thought so much about my wife , I did not seem to care at all for Esther . But the next day I asked all the neighbours ( both our own and Bradshaw 's ) , and they 'd none of 'em heard or seen nothing of her . I even went to a policeman , a good enough sort of man , but a fellow I 'd never spoke to before because of his livery , and I asks him if his ' cuteness could find any thing out for us . So I believe he asks other policemen ; and one on 'em had seen a wench , like our Esther , walking very quickly , with a bundle under her arm , on Tuesday night , toward eight o'clock , and get into a hackney coach , near Hulme Church , and we do n't know th ' number , and ca n't trace it no further . I 'm sorry enough for the girl , for bad 's come over her , one way or another , but I 'm sorrier for my wife . She loved her next to me and Mary , and she 's never been the same body since poor Tom 's death . However , let 's go back to them ; your old woman may have done her good . "

Tom , that 's Will 's father ( you do n't know Will , but he 's a sailor to foreign parts ) , had come to Manchester , and sent word what terrible lots of work was to be had , both for lads and lasses . So father sent George first ( you know George , well enough , Mary ) , and then work was scarce out toward Burton , where we lived , and father said I maun try and get a place . And George wrote as how wages were far higher in Manchester than Milnthorpe or Lancaster ; and , lasses , I was young and thoughtless , and thought it was a fine thing to go so far from home . So , one day , th ' butcher he brings us a letter fra George , to say he 'd heard on a place -- and I was all agog to go , and father was pleased , like ; but mother said little , and that little was very quiet .

But she packed up my clothes , and some o ' the better end of her own as would fit me , in yon little paper box up there -- it 's good for nought now , but I would liefer live without fire than break it up to be burnt ; and yet it 's going on for eighty years old , for she had it when she was a girl , and brought all her clothes in it to father 's , when they were married . But , as I was saying , she did not cry , though the tears was often in her eyes ; and I seen her looking after me down the lane as long as I were in sight , with her hand shading her eyes -- and that were the last look I ever had on her .

I used to try and save money enough to go for a week when I was in service ; but first one thing came , and then another . First , missis 's children fell ill of the measles , just when th ' week I 'd ask'd for came , and I could n't leave them , for one and all cried for me to nurse them . Then missis herself fell sick , and I could go less than ever .

Mother used to send Sally and me out to gather ling and heather for besoms , and it was such pleasant work ! We used to come home of an evening loaded so as you could not see us , for all that it was so light to carry . And then mother would make us sit down under the old hawthorn tree ( where we used to make our house among the great roots as stood above th ' ground ) , to pick and tie up the heather . It seems all like yesterday , and yet it 's a long long time agone . Poor sister Sally has been in her grave this forty year and more . But I often wonder if the hawthorn is standing yet , and if the lasses still go to gather heather , as we did many and many a year past and gone . I sicken at heart to see the old spot once again . May be next summer I may set off , if God spares me to see next summer . "

15994	16396	15607	15607	Mary	145	" Why , lass ! first one wanted me and then another ; and I could n't go without money either , and I got very poor at times . Tom was a scapegrace , poor fellow , and always wanted help of one kind or another ; and his wife ( for I think scapegraces are always married long before steady folk ) was but a helpless kind of body . She were always ailing , and he were always in trouble ; so I had enough to do with my hands and my money too , for that matter . They died within twelvemonth of each other , leaving one lad ( they had had seven , but the Lord had taken six to Himself ) , Will , as I was telling you on ; and I took him myself , and left service to make a bit on a home - place for him , and a fine lad he was , the very spit of his father as to looks , only steadier . For he was steady , although nought would serve him but going to sea . I tried all I could to set him again a sailor 's life . Says I , ' Folks is as sick as dogs all the time they 're at sea . Your own mother telled me ( for she came from foreign parts , being a Manx woman ) that she 'd ha thanked any one for throwing her into the water . ' Nay , I sent him a ' the way to Runcorn by th ' Duke 's canal , that he might know what th ' sea were ; and I looked to see him come back as white as a sheet wi ' vomiting . But the lad went on to Liverpool and saw real ships , and came back more set than ever on being a sailor , and he said as how he had never been sick at all , and thought he could stand the sea pretty well . So I telled him he mun do as he liked ; and he thanked me and kissed me , for all I was very frabbit [ 4 ] with him ; and now he 's gone to South America , at t'other side of the sun , they tell me .

Grandfather went to Liverpool one Whitsun - week to go strolling about the docks and pick up what he could from the sailors , who often bring some queer thing or another from the hot countries they go to ; and so he sees a chap with a bottle in his hand , like a druggist 's physic - bottle ; and says grandfather , ' What have ye gotten there ? ' So the sailor holds it up , and grandfather knew it was a rare kind o ' scorpion , not common even in the East Indies where the man came from ; and says he , ' How did ye catch this fine fellow , for he would n't be taken for nothing I 'm thinking ? ' And the man said as how when they were unloading the ship he 'd found him lying behind a bag of rice , and he thought the cold had killed him , for he was not squashed nor injured a bit . He did not like to part with any of the spirit out of his grog to put the scorpion in , but slipped him into the bottle , knowing there were folks enow who would give him something for him . So grandfather gives him a shilling . "

But you see th ' scorpion were doubled up , and grandfather thought I could n't fairly see how big he was . So he shakes him out right before the fire ; and a good warm one it was , for I was ironing , I remember . I left off ironing , and stooped down over him , to look at him better , and grandfather got a book , and began to read how this very kind were the most poisonous and vicious species , how their bite were often fatal , and then went on to read how people who were bitten got swelled , and screamed with pain . I was listening hard , but as it fell out , I never took my eyes off the creature , though I could not ha ' told I was watching it . Suddenly it seemed to give a jerk , and before I could speak , it gave another , and in a minute it was as wild as could be , running at me just like a mad dog . "

19464	19619	18892	18892	Margaret	157	" Well , I begged grandfather to crush it , and I had the iron right over it once , ready to drop , but grandfather begged me not to hurt it in that way . So I could n't think what he 'd have , for he hopped round the room as if he were sore afraid , for all he begged me not to injure it . At last he goes to th ' kettle , and lifts up the lid , and peeps in . What on earth is he doing that for , thinks I ; he 'll never drink his tea with a scorpion running free and easy about the room . Then he takes the tongs , and he settles his spectacles on his nose , and in a minute he had lifted the creature up by th ' leg , and dropped him into the boiling water . "

Besides , the cook , who , when she had had time to think , after breakfast was sent in , had noticed his paleness , had had meat and bread ready to put in his hand when he came out of the parlour ; and a full stomach makes every one of us more hopeful .

Their eyes were all fixed on the yet living one , whose moments of life were passing so rapidly away . At length he brought ( with jerking , convulsive effort ) his two hands into the attitude of prayer . They saw his lips move , and bent to catch the words , which came in gasps , and not in tones .

They knew what he meant , and guided it to her head , bowed and hidden in her hands , when she had sunk in her woe . It rested there , with a feeble pressure of endearment . The face grew beautiful , as the soul neared God . A peace beyond understanding came over it . The hand was a heavy , stiff weight on the wife 's head . No more grief or sorrow for him . They reverently laid out the corpse -- Wilson fetching his only spare shirt to array it in . The wife still lay hidden in the clothes , in a stupor of agony . There was a knock at the door , and Barton went to open it . It was Mary , who had received a message from her father , through a neighbour , telling her where he was ; and she had set out early to come and have a word with him before her day 's work ; but some errands she had to do for Miss Simmonds had detained her until now .

And Mary forgot all purposed meeting with her gay lover , Harry Carson ; forgot Miss Simmonds ' errands , and her anger , in the anxious desire to comfort the poor lone woman . Never had her sweet face looked more angelic , never had her gentle voice seemed so musical as when she murmured her broken sentences of comfort . "

It was agreed that the town must bury him ; he had paid to a burial club as long as he could ; but by a few weeks ' omission , he had forfeited his claim to a sum of money now . Would Mrs. Davenport and the little child go home with Mary ? The latter brightened up as she urged this plan ; but no ! where the poor , fondly loved remains were , there would the mourner be ; and all that they could do was to make her as comfortable as their funds would allow , and to beg a neighbour to look in and say a word at times . So she was left alone with her dead , and they went to work that had work , and he who had none , took upon him the arrangements for the funeral . Mary had many a scolding from Miss Simmonds that day for her absence of mind . To be sure Miss Simmonds was much put out by Mary 's non - appearance in the morning with certain bits of muslin , and shades of silk which were wanted to complete a dress to be worn that night ; but it was true enough that Mary did not mind what she was about ; she was too busy planning how her old black gown ( her best when her mother died ) might be spunged , and turned , and lengthened into something like decent mourning for the widow . And when she went home at night ( though it was very late , as a sort of retribution for her morning 's negligence ) , she set to work at once , and was so busy , and so glad over her task , that she had , every now and then , to check herself in singing merry ditties , that she felt little accorded with the sewing on which she was engaged . So when the funeral day came , Mrs. Davenport was neatly arrayed in black , a satisfaction to her poor heart in the midst of her sorrow . Barton and Wilson both accompanied her , as she led her two elder boys , and followed the coffin . It was a simple walking funeral , with nothing to grate on the feelings of any ; far more in accordance with its purpose , to my mind , than the gorgeous hearses , and nodding plumes , which form the grotesque funeral pomp of respectable people . There was no "

The only mark of pauperism attendant on the burial concerned the living and joyous , far more than the dead , or the sorrowful . When they arrived in the churchyard , they halted before a raised and handsome tombstone ; in reality a wooden mockery of stone respectabilities which adorned the burial - ground . It was easily raised in a very few minutes , and below was the grave in which pauper bodies were piled until within a foot or two of the surface ; when the soil was shovelled over , and stamped down , and the wooden cover went to do temporary duty over another hole . [ 19 ] But little they recked of this who now gave up their dead . [ Footnote 19 : The case , to my certain knowledge , in one churchyard in Manchester . There may be more . ] CHAPTER VII .

36420	36660	36417	36418	THE TWINS	142	" The ghoul - like fever was not to be braved with impunity , and baulked of its prey . The widow had reclaimed her children ; her neighbours , in the good Samaritan sense of the word , had paid her little arrears of rent , and made her a few shillings beforehand with the world . She determined to flit from that cellar to another less full of painful associations , less haunted by mournful memories . The board , not so formidable as she had imagined , had inquired into her case ; and , instead of sending her to Stoke Claypole , her husband 's Buckinghamshire parish , as she had dreaded , had agreed to pay her rent . So food for four mouths was all she was now required to find ; only for three she would have said ; for herself and the unweaned child were but reckoned as one in her calculation . She had a strong heart , now her bodily strength had been recruited by a week or two of food , and she would not despair . So she took in some little children to nurse , who brought their daily food with them , which she cooked for them , without wronging their helplessness of a crumb ; and when she had restored them to their mothers at night , she set to work at plain sewing , "
36669	37374	37377	37378	poor lad	1482	" and sat thinking how she might best cheat the factory inspector , and persuade him that her strong , big , hungry Ben was above thirteen . Her plan of living was so far arranged , when she heard , with keen sorrow , that Wilson 's twin lads were ill of the fever . They had never been strong . They were like many a pair of twins , and seemed to have but one life divided between them . One life , one strength , and in this instance , I might almost say , one brain ; for they were helpless , gentle , silly children , but not the less dear to their parents and to their strong , active , manly , elder brother . They were late on their feet , late in talking , late every way ; had to be nursed and cared for when other lads of their age were tumbling about in the street , and losing themselves , and being taken to the police - office miles away from home . Still want had never yet come in at the door to make love for these innocents fly out at the window . Nor was this the case even now , when Jem Wilson 's earnings , and his mother 's occasional charrings were barely sufficient to give all the family their fill of food . But when the twins , after ailing many days , and caring little for their meat , fell sick on the same afternoon , with the same heavy stupor of suffering , the three hearts that loved them so , each felt , though none acknowledged to the other , that they had little chance for life . It was nearly a week before the tale of their illness spread as far as the court where the Wilsons had once dwelt , and the Bartons yet lived . Alice had heard of the illness of her little nephews several days before , and had locked her cellar door , and gone off straight to her brother 's house , in Ancoats ; but she was often absent for days , sent for , as her neighbours knew , to help in some sudden emergency of illness or distress , so that occasioned no surprise . Margaret met Jem Wilson several days after his brothers were seriously ill , and heard from him the state of things at his home . She told Mary of it as she entered the court late that evening ; and Mary listened with saddened heart to the strange contrast which such woeful tidings presented to the gay and loving words she had been hearing on her walk home . She blamed herself for being so much taken up with visions of the golden future , that she had lately gone but seldom on Sunday afternoons , or other leisure time , to see Mrs. Wilson , her mother 's friend ; and with hasty purpose of amendment she only stayed to leave a message for her father with the next - door neighbour , and then went off at a brisk pace on her way to the house of mourning . She stopped with her hand on the latch of the Wilsons ' door , to still her beating heart , and listened to the hushed quiet within . She opened the door softly : there sat Mrs. Wilson in the old rocking - chair , with one sick , death - like boy lying on her knee , crying without let or pause , but softly , gently , as fearing to disturb the troubled , gasping child ; while behind her , old Alice let her fast - dropping tears fall down on the dead body of the other twin , which she was laying out on a board , placed on a sort of sofa - settee in a corner of the room . Over the child , which yet breathed , the father bent , watching anxiously for some ground of hope , where hope there was none . Mary stepped slowly and lightly across to Alice . "

She next endeavoured to lift the little body , and carry it to its old accustomed bed in its parents ' room . But earnest as the father was in watching the yet - living , he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead , and sprang gently up , and took his dead son on his hard couch in his arms with tender strength , and carried him upstairs as if afraid of wakening him . The other child gasped longer , louder , with more of effort . "

But the mother would not let him go , and looking in Alice 's face with brimming and imploring eyes , declared in earnest whispers , that she was not wishing him , that she would fain have him released from his suffering . Alice and Mary stood by with eyes fixed on the poor child , whose struggles seemed to increase , till at last his mother said with a choking voice , "

Nature 's struggles were soon exhausted , and he breathed his little life away in peace . Then the mother lifted up her voice and wept . Her cries brought her husband down to try with his aching heart to comfort hers . Again Alice laid out the dead , Mary helping with reverent fear . The father and mother carried him up - stairs to the bed , where his little brother lay in calm repose . Mary and Alice drew near the fire , and stood in quiet sorrow for some time . Then Alice broke the silence by saying , "

Mary helped her in all these little offices . They were busy in this way when the door was softly opened , and Jem came in , all grimed and dirty from his night - work , his soiled apron wrapped round his middle , in guise and apparel in which he would have been sorry at another time to have been seen by Mary . But just now he hardly saw her ; he went straight up to Alice , and asked how the little chaps were . They had been a shade better at dinner - time , and he had been working away through the long afternoon , and far into the night , in the belief that they had taken the turn . He had stolen out during the half - hour allowed at the works for tea , to buy them an orange or two , which now puffed out his jacket - pocket . He would make his aunt speak ; he would not understand her shakes of the head and fast coursing tears . "

But he stayed long there , and at last his sturdy frame shook with his strong agony . The two women were frightened , as women always are , on witnessing a man 's overpowering grief . They cried afresh in company . Mary 's heart melted within her as she witnessed Jem 's sorrow , and she stepped gently up to the corner where he stood , with his back turned to them , and putting her hand softly on his arm , said , "
38839	38943	38831	38831	I	0	" Jem felt a strange leap of joy in his heart , and knew the power she had of comforting him . He did not speak , as though fearing to destroy by sound or motion the happiness of that moment , when her soft hand 's touch thrilled through his frame , and her silvery voice was whispering tenderness in his ear . Yes ! it might be very wrong ; he could almost hate himself for it ; with death and woe so surrounding him , it yet was happiness , was bliss , to be so spoken to by Mary . "
38953	39000	39001	39001	Mary	145	" whispered she again , believing that his silence was only another form of grief . He could not contain himself . He took her hand in his firm yet trembling grasp , and said , in tones that instantly produced a revulsion in her mood , "
39065	39129	39048	39048	she	145	" She did know -- he was right there . But as he turned to catch a look at her sweet face , he saw that it expressed unfeigned distress , almost amounting to vexation ; a dread of him , that he thought was almost repugnance . He let her hand go , and she quickly went away to Alice 's side . "
39170	39336	39161	39161	she	1517	" Partly to relieve her from his presence , and partly from natural desire , and partly , perhaps , from a penitent wish to share to the utmost his parents ' sorrow , he soon went up - stairs to the chamber of death . Mary mechanically helped Alice in all the duties she performed through the remainder of that long night , but she did not see Jem again . He remained up - stairs until after the early dawn showed Mary that she need have no fear of going home through the deserted and quiet streets , to try and get a little sleep before work hour . So leaving kind messages to George and Jane Wilson , and hesitating whether she might dare to send a few kind words to Jem , and deciding that she had better not , she stepped out into the bright morning light , so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had been . "
39344	39431	39337	39337	They	1518	" Mary lay down on her bed in her clothes ; and whether it was this , or the broad daylight that poured in through the sky - window , or whether it was over - excitement , it was long before she could catch a wink of sleep . Her thoughts ran on Jem 's manner and words ; not but what she had known the tale they told for many a day ; but still she wished he had not put it so plainly . "
39435	39441	39337	39337	They	1518	" said she to herself , "
39741	40417	39737	39737	I	0	" So she turned on her pillow , and fell asleep , and dreamt of what was often in her waking thoughts ; of the day when she should ride from church in her carriage , with wedding - bells ringing , and take up her astonished father , and drive away from the old dim work - a - day court for ever , to live in a grand house , where her father should have newspapers , and pamphlets , and pipes , and meat dinners every day,--and all day long if he liked . Such thoughts mingled in her predilection for the handsome young Mr. Carson , who , unfettered by work - hours , let scarcely a day pass without contriving a meeting with the beautiful little milliner he had first seen while lounging in a shop where his sisters were making some purchases , and afterwards never rested till he had freely , though respectfully , made her acquaintance in her daily walks . He was , to use his own expression to himself , quite infatuated by her , and was restless each day till the time came when he had a chance , and , of late , more than a chance of meeting her . There was something of keen practical shrewdness about her , which contrasted very bewitchingly with the simple , foolish , unworldly ideas she had picked up from the romances which Miss Simmonds ' young ladies were in the habit of recommending to each other . Yes ! Mary was ambitious , and did not favour Mr. Carson the less because he was rich and a gentleman . The old leaven , infused years ago by her aunt Esther , fermented in her little bosom , and perhaps all the more , for her father 's aversion to the rich and the gentle . Such is the contrariness of the human heart , from Eve downwards , that we all , in our old - Adam state , fancy things forbidden sweetest . So Mary dwelt upon and enjoyed the idea of some day becoming a lady , and doing all the elegant nothings appertaining to ladyhood . It was a comfort to her , when scolded by Miss Simmonds , to think of the day when she would drive up to the door in her own carriage , to order her gowns from the hasty tempered yet kind dressmaker . It was a pleasure to her to hear the general admiration of the two elder Miss Carsons , acknowledged beauties in ball - room and street , on horseback and on foot , and to think of the time when she should ride and walk with them in loving sisterhood . But the best of her plans , the holiest , that which in some measure redeemed the vanity of the rest , were those relating to her father ; her dear father , now oppressed with care , and always a disheartened , gloomy person . How she would surround him with every comfort she could devise ( of course , he was to live with them ) , till he should acknowledge riches to be very pleasant things , and bless his lady - daughter ! Every one who had shown her kindness in her low estate should then be repaid a hundred - fold . Such were the castles in air , the Alnaschar - visions in which Mary indulged , and which she was doomed in after days to expiate with many tears . Meanwhile , her words -- or , even more , her tones -- would maintain their hold on Jem Wilson 's memory . A thrill would yet come over him when he remembered how her hand had rested on his arm . The thought of her mingled with all his grief , and it was profound , for the loss of his brothers . CHAPTER VIII . MARGARET 'S DEBUT AS A PUBLIC SINGER . "
40499	40755	41060	41060	Star	231	" LOVE THOUGHTS . One Sunday afternoon , about three weeks after that mournful night , Jem Wilson set out with the ostensible purpose of calling on John Barton . He was dressed in his best , his Sunday suit of course ; while his face glittered with the scrubbing he had bestowed on it . His dark black hair had been arranged and re - arranged before the household looking - glass , and in his button - hole he stuck a narcissus ( a sweet Nancy is its pretty Lancashire name ) , hoping it would attract Mary 's notice , so that he might have the delight of giving it her . It was a bad beginning of his visit of happiness that Mary saw him some minutes before he came into her father 's house . She was sitting at the end of the dresser , with the little window - blind drawn on one side , in order that she might see the passers - by , in the intervals of reading her Bible , which lay open before her . So she watched all the greeting a friend gave Jem ; she saw the face of condolence , the sympathetic shake of the hand , and had time to arrange her own face and manner before Jem came in , which he did , as if he had eyes for no one but her father , who sat smoking his pipe by the fire , while he read an old "
40759	41050	41060	41060	Star	231	" borrowed from a neighbouring public - house . Then he turned to Mary , who , he felt by the sure instinct of love , by which almost his body thought , was present . Her hands were busy adjusting her dress ; a forced and unnecessary movement Jem could not help thinking . Her accost was quiet and friendly , if grave ; she felt that she reddened like a rose , and wished she could prevent it , while Jem wondered if her blushes arose from fear , or anger , or love . She was very cunning , I am afraid . She pretended to read diligently , and not to listen to a word that was said , while , in fact , she heard all sounds , even to Jem 's long , deep sighs , which wrung her heart . At last she took up her Bible , and as if their conversation disturbed her , went up - stairs to her little room . And she had scarcely spoken a word to Jem ; scarcely looked at him ; never noticed his beautiful sweet Nancy , which only awaited her least word of praise to be hers ! He did not know -- that pang was spared -- that in her little dingy bed - room , stood a white jug , filled with a luxuriant bunch of early spring roses , making the whole room fragrant and bright . They were the gift of her richer lover . So Jem had to go on sitting with John Barton , fairly caught in his own trap , and had to listen to his talk , and answer him as best he might . "

41704	42881	41701	41702	higher folk	1551	" Still Jem was not curious . He gave up hope of seeing Mary again by her own good free will ; and the next best thing would be , to be alone to think of her . So , muttering something which he meant to serve as an excuse for his sudden departure , he hastily wished John good afternoon , and left him to resume his pipe and his politics . For three years past , trade had been getting worse and worse , and the price of provisions higher and higher . This disparity between the amount of the earnings of the working classes and the price of their food , occasioned , in more cases than could well be imagined , disease and death . Whole families went through a gradual starvation . They only wanted a Dante to record their sufferings . And yet even his words would fall short of the awful truth ; they could only present an outline of the tremendous facts of the destitution that surrounded thousands upon thousands in the terrible years 1839 , 1840 , and 1841 . Even philanthropists who had studied the subject , were forced to own themselves perplexed in their endeavour to ascertain the real causes of the misery ; the whole matter was of so complicated a nature , that it became next to impossible to understand it thoroughly . It need excite no surprise then to learn that a bad feeling between working - men and the upper classes became very strong in this season of privation . The indigence and sufferings of the operatives induced a suspicion in the minds of many of them , that their legislators , their magistrates , their employers , and even the ministers of religion , were , in general , their oppressors and enemies ; and were in league for their prostration and enthralment . The most deplorable and enduring evil that arose out of the period of commercial depression to which I refer , was this feeling of alienation between the different classes of society . It is so impossible to describe , or even faintly to picture , the state of distress which prevailed in the town at that time , that I will not attempt it ; and yet I think again that surely , in a Christian land , it was not known even so feebly as words could tell it , or the more happy and fortunate would have thronged with their sympathy and their aid . In many instances the sufferers wept first , and then they cursed . Their vindictive feelings exhibited themselves in rabid politics . And when I hear , as I have heard , of the sufferings and privations of the poor , of provision shops where ha'porths of tea , sugar , butter , and even flour , were sold to accommodate the indigent,--of parents sitting in their clothes by the fire - side during the whole night for seven weeks together , in order that their only bed and bedding might be reserved for the use of their large family,--of others sleeping upon the cold hearth - stone for weeks in succession , without adequate means of providing themselves with food or fuel ( and this in the depth of winter),--of others being compelled to fast for days together , uncheered by any hope of better fortune , living , moreover , or rather starving , in a crowded garret , or damp cellar , and gradually sinking under the pressure of want and despair into a premature grave ; and when this has been confirmed by the evidence of their care - worn looks , their excited feelings , and their desolate homes,--can I wonder that many of them , in such times of misery and destitution , spoke and acted with ferocious precipitation ? An idea was now springing up among the operatives , that originated with the Chartists , but which came at last to be cherished as a darling child by many and many a one . They could not believe that government knew of their misery ; they rather chose to think it possible that men could voluntarily assume the office of legislators for a nation , ignorant of its real state ; as who should make domestic rules for the pretty behaviour of children , without caring to know that those children had been kept for days without food . Besides , the starving multitudes had heard , that the very existence of their distress had been denied in Parliament ; and though they felt this strange and inexplicable , yet the idea that their misery had still to be revealed in all its depths , and that then some remedy would be found , soothed their aching hearts , and kept down their rising fury . So a petition was framed , and signed by thousands in the bright spring days of 1839 , imploring Parliament to hear witnesses who could testify to the unparalleled destitution of the manufacturing districts . Nottingham , Sheffield , Glasgow , Manchester , and many other towns , were busy appointing delegates to convey this petition , who might speak , not merely of what they had seen , and had heard , but from what they had borne and suffered . Life - worn , gaunt , anxious , hunger - stamped men , were those delegates . One of them was John Barton . He would have been ashamed to own the flutter of spirits his appointment gave him . There was the childish delight of seeing London -- that went a little way , and but a little way . There was the vain idea of speaking out his notions before so many grand folk -- that went a little further ; and last , there was the really pure gladness of heart , arising from the idea that he was one of those chosen to be instruments in making known the distresses of the people , and consequently in procuring them some grand relief , by means of which they should never suffer want or care any more . He hoped largely , but vaguely , of the results of his expedition . An argosy of the precious hopes of many otherwise despairing creatures , was that petition to be heard concerning their sufferings . The night before the morning on which the Manchester delegates were to leave for London , Barton might be said to hold a levée , so many neighbours came dropping in . Job Legh had early established himself and his pipe by John Barton 's fire , not saying much , but puffing away , and imagining himself of use in adjusting the smoothing - irons that hung before the fire , ready for Mary when she should want them . As for Mary , her employment was the same as that of Beau Tibbs ' wife , "

Mary watched him set off , with her hands over her eyes to shade them from the bright slanting rays of the morning sun , and then she turned into the house to arrange its disorder before going to her work . She wondered if she should like or dislike the evening and morning solitude ; for several hours when the clock struck she thought of her father , and wondered where he was ; she made good resolutions according to her lights ; and by - and - bye came the distractions and events of the broad full day to occupy her with the present , and to deaden the memory of the absent . One of Mary 's resolutions was , that she would not be persuaded or induced to see Mr. Harry Carson during her father 's absence . There was something crooked in her conscience after all ; for this very resolution seemed an acknowledgment that it was wrong to meet him at any time ; and yet she had brought herself to think her conduct quite innocent and proper , for although unknown to her father , and certain , even did he know it , to fail of obtaining his sanction , she esteemed her love - meetings with Mr. Carson as sure to end in her father 's good and happiness . But now that he was away , she would do nothing that he would disapprove of ; no , not even though it was for his own good in the end . Now , amongst Miss Simmonds ' young ladies was one who had been from the beginning a confidant in Mary 's love affair , made so by Mr. Carson himself . He had felt the necessity of some third person to carry letters and messages , and to plead his cause when he was absent . In a girl named Sally Leadbitter he had found a willing advocate . She would have been willing to have embarked in a love - affair herself ( especially a clandestine one ) , for the mere excitement of the thing ; but her willingness was strengthened by sundry half - sovereigns , which from time to time Mr. Carson bestowed upon her . Sally Leadbitter was vulgar - minded to the last degree ; never easy unless her talk was of love and lovers ; in her eyes it was an honour to have had a long list of wooers . So constituted , it was a pity that Sally herself was but a plain , red - haired , freckled girl ; never likely , one would have thought , to become a heroine on her own account . But what she lacked in beauty she tried to make up for by a kind of witty boldness , which gave her what her betters would have called piquancy . Considerations of modesty or propriety never checked her utterance of a good thing . She had just talent enough to corrupt others . Her very good - nature was an evil influence . They could not hate one who was so kind ; they could not avoid one who was so willing to shield them from scrapes by any exertion of her own ; whose ready fingers would at any time make up for their deficiencies , and whose still more convenient tongue would at any time invent for them . The Jews , or Mohammedans ( I forget which ) , believe that there is one little bone of our body , one of the vertebræ , if I remember rightly , which will never decay and turn to dust , but will lie incorrupt and indestructible in the ground until the Last Day : this is the Seed of the Soul . The most depraved have also their Seed of the Holiness that shall one day overcome their evil , their one good quality , lurking hidden , but safe , among all the corrupt and bad . Sally 's seed of the future soul was her love for her mother , an aged bedridden woman . For her she had self - denial ; for her , her good - nature rose into tenderness ; to cheer her lonely bed , her spirits , in the evenings when her body was often woefully tired , never flagged , but were ready to recount the events of the day , to turn them into ridicule , and to mimic , with admirable fidelity , any person gifted with an absurdity who had fallen under her keen eye . But the mother was lightly principled like Sally herself ; nor was there need to conceal from her the reason why Mr. Carson gave her so much money . She chuckled with pleasure , and only hoped that the wooing would be long a - doing . Still neither she , nor her daughter , nor Harry Carson liked this resolution of Mary , not to see him during her father 's absence . One evening ( and the early summer evenings were long and bright now ) , Sally met Mr. Carson by appointment , to be charged with a letter for Mary , imploring her to see him , which Sally was to back with all her powers of persuasion . After parting from him she determined , as it was not so very late , to go at once to Mary 's , and deliver the message and letter . She found Mary in great sorrow . She had just heard of George Wilson 's sudden death : her old friend , her father 's friend , Jem 's father -- all his claims came rushing upon her . Though not guarded from unnecessary sight or sound of death , as the children of the rich are , yet it had so often been brought home to her this last three or four months . It was so terrible thus to see friend after friend depart . Her father , too , who had dreaded Jane Wilson 's death the evening before he set off . And she , the weakly , was left behind while the strong man was taken . At any rate the sorrow her father had so feared for him was spared . Such were the thoughts which came over her . She could not go to comfort the bereaved , even if comfort were in her power to give ; for she had resolved to avoid Jem ; and she felt that this of all others was not the occasion on which she could keep up a studiously cold manner . And in this shock of grief , Sally Leadbitter was the last person she wished to see . However , she rose to welcome her , betraying her tear - swollen face . "

48680	49154	48675	48678	CHILD OF THE ISLANDS	1706	" The next evening it was a warm , pattering , incessant rain , just the rain to waken up the flowers . But in Manchester , where , alas ! there are no flowers , the rain had only a disheartening and gloomy effect ; the streets were wet and dirty , the drippings from the houses were wet and dirty , and the people were wet and dirty . Indeed , most kept within - doors ; and there was an unusual silence of footsteps in the little paved courts . Mary had to change her clothes after her walk home ; and had hardly settled herself before she heard some one fumbling at the door . The noise continued long enough to allow her to get up , and go and open it . There stood -- could it be ? yes it was , her father ! Drenched and way - worn , there he stood ! He came in with no word to Mary in return for her cheery and astonished greeting . He sat down by the fire in his wet things , unheeding . But Mary would not let him so rest . She ran up and brought down his working - day clothes , and went into the pantry to rummage up their little bit of provision while he changed by the fire , talking all the while as gaily as she could , though her father 's depression hung like lead on her heart . For Mary , in her seclusion at Miss Simmonds',--where the chief talk was of fashions , and dress , and parties to be given , for which such and such gowns would be wanted , varied with a slight whispered interlude occasionally about love and lovers,--had not heard the political news of the day : that Parliament had refused to listen to the working - men , when they petitioned with all the force of their rough , untutored words to be heard concerning the distress which was riding , like the Conqueror on his Pale Horse , among the people ; which was crushing their lives out of them , and stamping woe - marks over the land . When he had eaten and was refreshed , they sat in silence for some time ; for Mary wished him to tell her what oppressed him so , yet durst not ask . In this she was wise ; for when we are heavy laden in our hearts , it falls in better with our humour to reveal our case in our own way , and our own time . Mary sat on a stool at her father 's feet in old childish guise , and stole her hand into his , while his sadness infected her , and she "

She did not know what to say , and was so afraid of speaking wrongly , that she was silent . But when his attitude had remained unchanged for more than half - an - hour , his eyes gazing vacantly and fixedly at the fire , no sound but now and then a deep drawn sigh to break the weary ticking of the clock , and the drip - drop from the roof without , Mary could bear it no longer .

Well , t ' make a long story short , Old Jennings and I went up by that night 's coach . So you see , Mary , that was the way I got to London . "

It grew dark while I sat there ; and at last th ' landlady come up again , and said , ' Come here . ' So I got up and walked into th ' light , but I had to hold by th ' stair - rails , I were so weak and dizzy . She led me into a room , where Jennings lay on a sofa fast asleep , wi ' his pocket handkercher over his head for a night - cap . She said he 'd cried himself fairly off to sleep . There were tea on th ' table all ready ; for she were a kind - hearted body . But she still said , ' Come here , ' and took hold o ' my arm . So I went round the table , and there were a clothes - basket by th ' fire , wi ' a shawl put o'er it . ' Lift that up , ' says she , and I did ; and there lay a little wee babby fast asleep . My heart gave a leap , and th ' tears comed rushing into my eyes first time that day . ' Is it hers ? ' said I , though I knew it were . ' Yes , ' said she . ' She were getting a bit better o ' the fever , and th ' babby were born ; and then the poor young man took worse and died , and she were not many hours behind . ' "

But when th ' coach stopped for dinner it were awake , and crying for its pobbies . [ 32 ] So we asked for some bread and milk , and Jennings took it first for to feed it ; but it made its mouth like a square , and let it run out at each o ' th ' four corners . ' Shake it , Jennings , ' says I ; ' that 's the way they make water run through a funnel , when it 's o'er full ; and a child 's mouth is broad end o ' th ' funnel , and th ' gullet the narrow one . ' So he shook it , but it only cried th ' more . ' Let me have it , ' says I , thinking he were an awkward oud chap . But it were just as bad wi ' me . By shaking th ' babby we got better nor a gill into its mouth , but more nor that came up again , wetting a ' th ' nice dry clothes landlady had put on . Well , just as we 'd gotten to th ' dinner - table , and helped oursels , and eaten two mouthful , came in th ' guard , and a fine chap wi ' a sample o ' calico flourishing in his hand . ' Coach is ready ! ' says one ; ' Half - a - crown your dinner ! ' says th ' other . Well , we thought it a deal for both our dinners , when we 'd hardly tasted 'em ; but , bless your life , it were half - a - crown apiece , and a shilling for th ' bread and milk as were possetted all over babby 's clothes . We spoke up again [ 33 ] it ; but every body said it were the rule , so what could two poor oud chaps like us do again it ? Well , poor babby cried without stopping to take breath , fra ' that time till we got to Brummagem for the night . My heart ached for th ' little thing . It caught wi ' its wee mouth at our coat sleeves and at our mouths , when we tried t ' comfort it by talking to it . Poor little wench ! It wanted its mammy , as were lying cold in th ' grave . ' Well , ' says I , ' it 'll be clemmed to death , if it lets out its supper as it did its dinner . Let 's get some woman to feed it ; it comes natural to women to do for babbies . ' So we asked th ' chamber - maid at the inn , and she took quite kindly to it ; and we got a good supper , and grew rare and sleepy , what wi ' th ' warmth , and wi ' our long ride i ' th ' open air . Th ' chamber - maid said she would like t ' have it t ' sleep wi ' her , only missis would scold so ; but it looked so quiet and smiling like , as it lay in her arms , that we thought ' twould be no trouble to have it wi ' us . I says : ' See , Jennings , how women - folk do quieten babbies ; it 's just as I said . ' He looked grave ; he were always thoughtful - looking , though I never heard him say any thing very deep .

Howe'er he 'd not be laughed out on't , so I held th ' babby till he were in bed . Such a night as we had on it ! Babby began to scream o ' th ' oud fashion , and we took it turn and turn about to sit up and rock it . My heart were very sore for th ' little one , as it groped about wi ' its mouth ; but for a ' that I could scarce keep fra ' smiling at th ' thought o ' us two oud chaps , th ' one wi ' a woman 's night - cap on , sitting on our hinder ends for half th ' night , hushabying a babby as would n't be hushabied . Toward morning , poor little wench ! it fell asleep , fairly tired out wi ' crying , but even in its sleep it gave such pitiful sobs , quivering up fra ' the very bottom of its little heart , that once or twice I almost wished it lay on its mother 's breast , at peace for ever . Jennings fell asleep too ; but I began for to reckon up our money . It were little enough we had left , our dinner the day afore had ta'en so much . I did n't know what our reckoning would be for that night lodging , and supper , and breakfast . Doing a sum alway sent me asleep ever sin ' I were a lad ; so I fell sound in a short time , and were only wakened by chambermaid tapping at th ' door , to say she 'd dress the babby afore her missis were up if we liked . But bless yo ' , we 'd never thought o ' undressing it th ' night afore , and now it were sleeping so sound , and we were so glad o ' the peace and quietness , that we thought it were no good to waken it up to screech again .

He seem'd as though he 'd shake it off by a jerk on his elbow , but she said quite low , ' For poor little Johnnie 's sake , Richard . ' He did not move or speak again , and after looking in his face for a minute , she turned away , swallowing deep in her throat . She kissed th ' sleeping babby as she passed , when I paid her . To quieten th ' gruff husband , and stop him if he rated her , I could na help slipping another sixpence under th ' loaf , and then we set off again .

So I naturally wished her to know what a sacrifice of prejudice , of -- of myself , in short , I was willing to make for her sake ; yet I do n't think she was aware of it after all . I believe I might have any lady in Manchester if I liked , and yet I was willing and ready to marry a poor dress - maker .

I am more in love with her than ever ; even for this charming capricious ebullition of hers . She 'll come round , you may depend upon it . Women always do .

The evening then would be a blank ; at least so she thought for the first five minutes ; but she soon forgot her disappointment in the cheerful meeting of old friends , all , except herself , with some cause for rejoicing at that very time . Margaret , who could not be idle , was knitting away , with her face looking full into the room , away from her work . Alice sat meek and patient with her dimmed eyes and gentle look , trying to see and to hear , but never complaining ; indeed , in her inner self she was blessing God for her happiness ; for the joy of having her nephew , her child , near her , was far more present to her mind , than her deprivations of sight and hearing . Job was in the full glory of host and hostess too , for by a tacit agreement he had roused himself from his habitual abstraction , and had assumed many of Margaret 's little household duties . While he moved about he was deep in conversation with the young sailor , trying to extract from him any circumstances connected with the natural history of the different countries he had visited . "

He won the sailor 's heart by getting up to shake both his hands in his vehement gratitude , puzzling poor old Alice , who yet smiled through her wonder ; for she understood the action to indicate some kindly feeling towards her nephew . Job wanted to prove his gratitude , and was puzzled how to do it . He feared the young man would not appreciate any of his duplicate Araneides ; not even the great American Mygale , one of his most precious treasures ; or else he would gladly have bestowed any duplicate on the donor of a real dried Exocetus . What could he do for him ? He could ask Margaret to sing . Other folks beside her old doating grandfather thought a deal of her songs . So Margaret began some of her noble old - fashioned songs . She knew no modern music ( for which her auditors might have been thankful ) , but she poured her rich voice out in some of the old canzonets she had lately learnt while accompanying the musical lecturer on his tour . Mary was amused to see how the young sailor sat entranced ; mouth , eyes , all open , in order to catch every breath of sound . His very lids refused to wink , as if afraid in that brief proverbial interval to lose a particle of the rich music that floated through the room . For the first time the idea crossed Mary 's mind that it was possible the plain little sensible Margaret , so prim and demure , might have power over the heart of the handsome , dashing , spirited Will Wilson . Job , too , was rapidly changing his opinion of his new guest . The flying fish went a great way , and his undisguised admiration for Margaret 's singing carried him still further . It was amusing enough to see these two , within the hour so barely civil to each other , endeavouring now to be ultra - agreeable . Will , as soon as he had taken breath ( a long , deep gasp of admiration ) after Margaret 's song , sidled up to Job , and asked him in a sort of doubting tone , "

Or if it did , how changed from the fond anticipation of what it was to have been ! It would be a mockery to the blind and deaf Alice . The evening came quickly to an end . There was the humble cheerful meal , and then the bustling merry farewell , and Mary was once more in the quietness and solitude of her own dingy , dreary - looking home ; her father still out , the fire extinguished , and her evening 's task of work lying all undone upon the dresser . But it had been a pleasant little interlude to think upon . It had distracted her attention for a few hours from the pressure of many uneasy thoughts , of the dark , heavy , oppressive times , when sorrow and want seemed to surround her on every side ; of her father , his changed and altered looks , telling so plainly of broken health , and an embittered heart ; of the morrow , and the morrow beyond that , to be spent in that close monotonous work - room , with Sally Leadbitter 's odious whispers hissing in her ear ; and of the hunted look , so full of dread , from Miss Simmonds ' door - step up and down the street , lest her persecuting lover should be near : for he lay in wait for her with wonderful perseverance , and of late had made himself almost hateful , by the unmanly force which he had used to detain her to listen to him , and the indifference with which he exposed her to the remarks of the passers - by , any one of whom might circulate reports which it would be terrible for her father to hear -- and worse than death should they reach Jem Wilson . And all this she had drawn upon herself by her giddy flirting . Oh ! how she loathed the recollection of the hot summer evening , when , worn out by stitching and sewing , she had loitered homewards with weary languor , and first listened to the voice of the tempter . And Jem Wilson ! Oh , Jem , Jem , why did you not come to receive some of the modest looks and words of love which Mary longed to give you , to try and make up for the hasty rejection which you as hastily took to be final , though both mourned over it with many tears .

An overseer of a foundry , an aged man , with hoary hair , has spent his Sabbaths , for many years , in visiting the prisoners and the afflicted in Manchester New Bailey ; not merely advising and comforting , but putting means into their power of regaining the virtue and the peace they had lost ; becoming himself their guarantee in obtaining employment , and never deserting those who have once asked help from him . [ 43 ] [ Footnote 43 : Vide _ Manchester Guardian _ , of Wednesday , March 18 , 1846 ; and also the Reports of Captain Williams , prison inspector . ] Esther 's term of imprisonment was ended . She received a good character in the governor 's books ; she had picked her daily quantity of oakum , had never deserved the extra punishment of the tread - mill , and had been civil and decorous in her language . And once more she was out of prison . The door closed behind her with a ponderous clang , and in her desolation she felt as if shut out of home -- from the only shelter she could meet with , houseless and pennyless as she was , on that dreary day . But it was but for an instant that she stood there doubting . One thought had haunted her both by night and by day , with monomaniacal incessancy ; and that thought was how to save Mary ( her dead sister 's only child , her own little pet in the days of her innocence ) from following in the same downward path to vice . To whom could she speak and ask for aid ? She shrank from the idea of addressing John Barton again ; her heart sank within her , at the remembrance of his fierce repulsing action , and far fiercer words . It seemed worse than death to reveal her condition to Mary , else she sometimes thought that this course would be the most terrible , the most efficient warning . She must speak ; to that she was soul - compelled ; but to whom ? She dreaded addressing any of her former female acquaintance , even supposing they had sense , or spirit , or interest enough to undertake her mission . To whom shall the outcast prostitute tell her tale ? Who will give her help in her day of need ? Hers is the leper - sin , and all stand aloof dreading to be counted unclean . In her wild night wanderings , she had noted the haunts and habits of many a one who little thought of a watcher in the poor forsaken woman . You may easily imagine that a double interest was attached by her to the ways and companionships of those with whom she had been acquainted in the days which , when present , she had considered hardly - worked and monotonous , but which now in retrospection seemed so happy and unclouded . Accordingly , she had , as we have seen , known where to meet with John Barton on that unfortunate night , which had only produced irritation in him , and a month 's imprisonment to her . She had also observed that he was still intimate with the Wilsons . She had seen him walking and talking with both father and son ; her old friends too ; and she had shed unregarded , unvalued tears , when some one had casually told her of George Wilson 's sudden death . It now flashed across her mind , that to the son , to Mary 's play - fellow , her elder brother in the days of childhood , her tale might be told , and listened to with interest , and some mode of action suggested by him by which Mary might be guarded and saved . All these thoughts had passed through her mind while yet she was in prison ; so when she was turned out , her purpose was clear , and she did not feel her desolation of freedom as she would otherwise have done . That night she stationed herself early near the foundry where she knew Jem worked ; he stayed later than usual , being detained by some arrangements for the morrow . She grew tired and impatient ; many workmen had come out of the door in the long , dead , brick wall , and eagerly had she peered into their faces , deaf to all insult or curse . He must have gone home early ; one more turn in the street , and she would go . During that turn he came out , and in the quiet of that street of workshops and warehouses , she directly heard his steps . Now her heart failed her for an instant ; but still she was not daunted from her purpose , painful as its fulfilment was sure to be . She laid her hand on his arm . As she expected , after a momentary glance at the person who thus endeavoured to detain him , he made an effort to shake it off , and pass on . But trembling as she was , she had provided against this by a firm and unusual grasp . "

But he controlled himself to silence . After awhile , she spoke again , and in a calmer voice . "

84814	84854	84805	84805	Jem	154	" With heart and soul , though in few words , Jem promised that if aught earthly could keep her from falling , he would do it . Then she blessed him , and bade him good - night . "

85010	86068	85002	85002	I	0	" Again she rapidly turned off , and Jem also went on his way . But before he reached the end of the street , even in the midst of the jealous anguish that filled his heart , his conscience smote him . He had not done enough to save her . One more effort , and she might have come . Nay , twenty efforts would have been well rewarded by her yielding . He turned back , but she was gone . In the tumult of his other feelings , his self - reproach was deadened for the time . But many and many a day afterwards he bitterly regretted his omission of duty ; his weariness of well - doing . Now , the great thing was to reach home , and solitude . Mary loved another ! Oh ! how should he bear it ? He had thought her rejection of him a hard trial , but that was nothing now . He only remembered it , to be thankful he had not yielded to the temptation of trying his fate again , not in actual words , but in a meeting , where her manner should tell far more than words , that her sweeter smiles , her dainty movements , her pretty household ways , were all to be reserved to gladden another 's eyes and heart . And he must live on ; that seemed the strangest . That a long life ( and he knew men did live long , even with deep , biting sorrow corroding at their hearts ) must be spent without Mary ; nay , with the consciousness she was another 's ! That hell of thought he would reserve for the quiet of his own room , the dead stillness of night . He was on the threshold of home now . He entered . There were the usual faces , the usual sights . He loathed them , and then he cursed himself because he loathed them . His mother 's love had taken a cross turn , because he had kept the tempting supper she had prepared for him waiting until it was nearly spoilt . Alice , her dulled senses deadening day by day , sat mutely near the fire ; her happiness , bounded by the circle of the consciousness of the presence of her foster child , knowing that his voice repeated what was passing to her deafened ear , that his arm removed each little obstacle to her tottering steps . And Will , out of the very kindness of his heart , talked more and more merrily than ever . He saw Jem was downcast , and fancied his rattling might cheer him ; at any rate , it drowned his aunt 's muttered grumblings , and in some measure concealed the blank of the evening . At last , bed - time came ; and Will withdrew to his neighbouring lodging ; and Jane and Alice Wilson had raked the fire , and fastened doors and shutters , and pattered up stairs , with their tottering foot - steps , and shrill voices . Jem , too , went to the closet termed his bed - room . There was no bolt to the door ; but by one strong effort of his right arm , a heavy chest was moved against it , and he could sit down on the side of his bed , and think . Mary loved another ! That idea would rise uppermost in his mind , and had to be combated in all its forms of pain . It was , perhaps , no great wonder that she should prefer one so much above Jem in the external things of life . But the gentleman ; why did he , with his range of choice among the ladies of the land , why did he stoop down to carry off the poor man 's darling ? With all the glories of the garden at his hand , why did he prefer to cull the wild - rose,--Jem 's own fragrant wild - rose ? His _ own ! _ Oh ! never now his own!--Gone for evermore ! Then uprose the guilty longing for blood!--The frenzy of jealousy!--Some one should die . He would rather Mary were dead , cold in her grave , than that she were another 's . A vision of her pale , sweet face , with her bright hair all bedabbled with gore , seemed to float constantly before his aching eyes . But hers were ever open , and contained , in their soft , deathly look , such mute reproach ! What had she done to deserve such cruel treatment from him ? She had been wooed by one whom Jem knew to be handsome , gay , and bright , and she had given him her love . That was all ! It was the wooer who should die . Yes , die , knowing the cause of his death . Jem pictured him ( and gloated on the picture ) , lying smitten , yet conscious ; and listening to the upbraiding accusation of his murderer . How he had left his own rank , and dared to love a maiden of low degree ; and -- oh ! stinging agony of all -- how she , in return , had loved him ! Then the other nature spoke up , and bade him remember the anguish he should so prepare for Mary ! At first he refused to listen to that better voice ; or listened only to pervert . He would glory in her wailing grief ! he would take pleasure in her desolation of heart ! No ! he could not , said the still small voice . It would be worse , far worse , to have caused such woe , than it was now to bear his present heavy burden . But it was too heavy , too grievous to be borne , and live . He would slay himself , and the lovers should love on , and the sun shine bright , and he with his burning , woeful heart would be at rest . "
86079	86688	86077	86077	God	224	" Had he not promised with such earnest purpose of soul , as makes words more solemn than oaths , to save Mary from becoming such as Esther ? Should he shrink from the duties of life , into the cowardliness of death ? Who would then guard Mary , with her love and her innocence ? Would it not be a goodly thing to serve her , although she loved him not ; to be her preserving angel , through the perils of life ; and she , unconscious all the while ? He braced up his soul , and said to himself , that with God 's help he would be that earthly keeper . And now the mists and the storms seemed clearing away from his path , though it still was full of stinging thorns . Having done the duty nearest to him ( of reducing the tumult of his own heart to something like order ) , the second became more plain before him . Poor Esther 's experience had led her , perhaps , too hastily to the conclusion , that Mr. Carson 's intentions were evil towards Mary ; at least she had given no just ground for the fears she entertained that such was the case . It was possible , nay , to Jem 's heart , very probable , that he might only be too happy to marry her . She was a lady by right of nature , Jem thought ; in movement , grace , and spirit . what was birth to a Manchester manufacturer , many of whom glory , and justly too , in being the architects of their own fortunes ? And , as far as wealth was concerned , judging another by himself , Jem could only imagine it a great privilege to lay it at the feet of the loved one . Harry Carson 's mother had been a factory girl ; so , after all , what was the great reason for doubting his intentions towards Mary ? There might probably be some little awkwardness about the affair at first : Mary 's father having such strong prejudices on the one hand ; and something of the same kind being likely to exist on the part of Mr. Carson 's family . But Jem knew he had power over John Barton 's mind ; and it would be something to exert that power in promoting Mary 's happiness , and to relinquish all thought of self in so doing . Oh ! why had Esther chosen him for this office ? It was beyond his strength to act rightly ! Why had she singled him out ? The answer came when he was calm enough to listen for it . Because Mary had no other friend capable of the duty required of him ; the duty of a brother , as Esther imagined him to be in feeling , from his long friendship . He would be unto her as a brother . As such , he ought to ascertain Harry Carson 's intentions towards her in winning her affections . He would ask him , straightforwardly , as became man speaking to man , not concealing , if need were , the interest he felt in Mary . Then , with the resolve to do his duty to the best of his power , peace came into his soul ; he had left the windy storm and tempest behind . Two hours before day - dawn he fell asleep . CHAPTER XV . A VIOLENT MEETING BETWEEN THE RIVALS . "

86780	88191	86724	86724	Them	2523	" We must return to John Barton . Poor John ! He never got over his disappointing journey to London . The deep mortification he then experienced ( with , perhaps , as little selfishness for its cause as mortification ever had ) was of no temporary nature ; indeed , few of his feelings were . Then came a long period of bodily privation ; of daily hunger after food ; and though he tried to persuade himself he could bear want himself with stoical indifference , and did care about it as little as most men , yet the body took its revenge for its uneasy feelings . The mind became soured and morose , and lost much of its equipoise . It was no longer elastic , as in the days of youth , or in times of comparative happiness ; it ceased to hope . And it is hard to live on when one can no longer hope . The same state of feeling which John Barton entertained , if belonging to one who had had leisure to think of such things , and physicians to give names to them , would have been called monomania ; so haunting , so incessant , were the thoughts that pressed upon him . I have somewhere read a forcibly described punishment among the Italians , worthy of a Borgia . The supposed or real criminal was shut up in a room , supplied with every convenience and luxury ; and at first mourned little over his imprisonment . But day by day he became aware that the space between the walls of his apartment was narrowing , and then he understood the end . Those painted walls would come into hideous nearness , and at last crush the life out of him . And so day by day , nearer and nearer , came the diseased thoughts of John Barton . They excluded the light of heaven , the cheering sounds of earth . They were preparing his death . It is true , much of their morbid power might be ascribed to the use of opium . But before you blame too harshly this use , or rather abuse , try a hopeless life , with daily cravings of the body for food . Try , not alone being without hope yourself , but seeing all around you reduced to the same despair , arising from the same circumstances ; all around you telling ( though they use no words or language ) , by their looks and feeble actions , that they are suffering and sinking under the pressure of want . Would you not be glad to forget life , and its burdens ? And opium gives forgetfulness for a time . It is true they who thus purchase it pay dearly for their oblivion ; but can you expect the uneducated to count the cost of their whistle ? Poor wretches ! They pay a heavy price . Days of oppressive weariness and languor , whose realities have the feeble sickliness of dreams ; nights , whose dreams are fierce realities of agony ; sinking health , tottering frames , incipient madness , and worse , the _ consciousness _ of incipient madness ; this is the price of their whistle . But have you taught them the science of consequences ? John Barton 's overpowering thought , which was to work out his fate on earth , was rich and poor ; why are they so separate , so distinct , when God has made them all ? It is not His will , that their interests are so far apart . Whose doing is it ? And so on into the problems and mysteries of life , until , bewildered and lost , unhappy and suffering , the only feeling that remained clear and undisturbed in the tumult of his heart , was hatred to the one class and keen sympathy with the other . But what availed his sympathy ? No education had given him wisdom ; and without wisdom , even love , with all its effects , too often works but harm . He acted to the best of his judgment , but it was a widely - erring judgment . The actions of the uneducated seem to me typified in those of Frankenstein , that monster of many human qualities , ungifted with a soul , a knowledge of the difference between good and evil . The people rise up to life ; they irritate us , they terrify us , and we become their enemies . Then , in the sorrowful moment of our triumphant power , their eyes gaze on us with a mute reproach . Why have we made them what they are ; a powerful monster , yet without the inner means for peace and happiness ? John Barton became a Chartist , a Communist , all that is commonly called wild and visionary . Ay ! but being visionary is something . It shows a soul , a being not altogether sensual ; a creature who looks forward for others , if not for himself . And with all his weakness he had a sort of practical power , which made him useful to the bodies of men to whom he belonged . He had a ready kind of rough Lancashire eloquence , arising out of the fulness of his heart , which was very stirring to men similarly circumstanced , who liked to hear their feelings put into words . He had a pretty clear head at times , for method and arrangement ; a necessary talent to large combinations of men . And what perhaps more than all made him relied upon and valued , was the consciousness which every one who came in contact with him felt , that he was actuated by no selfish motives ; that his class , his order , was what he stood by , not the rights of his own paltry self . For even in great and noble men , as soon as self comes into prominent existence , it becomes a mean and paltry thing . A little time before this , there had come one of those occasions for deliberation among the employed , which deeply interested John Barton ; and the discussions concerning which had caused his frequent absence from home of late . I am not sure if I can express myself in the technical terms of either masters or workmen , but I will try simply to state the case on which the latter deliberated . An order for coarse goods came in from a new foreign market . It was a large order , giving employment to all the mills engaged in that species of manufacture : but it was necessary to execute it speedily , and at as low prices as possible , as the masters had reason to believe a duplicate order had been sent to one of the continental manufacturing towns , where there were no restrictions on food , no taxes on building or machinery , and where consequently they dreaded that the goods could be made at a much lower price than they could afford them for ; and that , by so acting and charging , the rival manufacturers would obtain undivided possession of the market . It was clearly their interest to buy cotton as cheaply , and to beat down wages as low as possible . And in the long run the interests of the workmen would have been thereby benefited . Distrust each other as they may , the employers and the employed must rise or fall together . There may be some difference as to chronology , none as to fact . But the masters did not choose to make all these facts known . They stood upon being the masters , and that they had a right to order work at their own prices , and they believed that in the present depression of trade , and unemployment of hands , there would be no great difficulty in getting it done . Now let us turn to the workmen 's view of the question . The masters ( of the tottering foundation of whose prosperity they were ignorant ) seemed doing well , and like gentlemen , "
88198	89061	86724	86724	Them	2523	" while they were starving , gasping on from day to day ; and there was a foreign order to be executed , the extent of which , large as it was , was greatly exaggerated ; and it was to be done speedily . Why were the masters offering such low wages under these circumstances ? Shame upon them ! It was taking advantage of their work - people being almost starved ; but they would starve entirely rather than come into such terms . It was bad enough to be poor , while by the labour of their thin hands , the sweat of their brows , the masters were made rich ; but they would not be utterly ground down to dust . No ! they would fold their hands , and sit idle , and smile at the masters , whom even in death they could baffle . With Spartan endurance they determined to let the employers know their power , by refusing to work . So class distrusted class , and their want of mutual confidence wrought sorrow to both . The masters would not be bullied , and compelled to reveal why they felt it wisest and best to offer only such low wages ; they would not be made to tell that they were even sacrificing capital to obtain a decisive victory over the continental manufacturers . And the workmen sat silent and stern with folded hands , refusing to work for such pay . There was a strike in Manchester . Of course it was succeeded by the usual consequences . Many other Trades ' Unions , connected with different branches of business , supported with money , countenance , and encouragement of every kind , the stand which the Manchester power - loom weavers were making against their masters . Delegates from Glasgow , from Nottingham , and other towns , were sent to Manchester , to keep up the spirit of resistance ; a committee was formed , and all the requisite officers elected ; chairman , treasurer , honorary secretary:--among them was John Barton . The masters , meanwhile , took their measures . They placarded the walls with advertisements for power - loom weavers . The workmen replied by a placard in still larger letters , stating their grievances . The masters met daily in town , to mourn over the time ( so fast slipping away ) for the fulfilment of the foreign orders ; and to strengthen each other in their resolution not to yield . If they gave up now , they might give up always . It would never do . And amongst the most energetic of the masters , the Carsons , father and son , took their places . It is well known , that there is no religionist so zealous as a convert ; no masters so stern , and regardless of the interests of their work - people , as those who have risen from such a station themselves . This would account for the elder Mr. Carson 's determination not to be bullied into yielding ; not even to be bullied into giving reasons for acting as the masters did . It was the employer 's will , and that should be enough for the employed . Harry Carson did not trouble himself much about the grounds for his conduct . He liked the excitement of the affair . He liked the attitude of resistance . He was brave , and he liked the idea of personal danger , with which some of the more cautious tried to intimidate the violent among the masters . Meanwhile , the power - loom weavers living in the more remote parts of Lancashire , and the neighbouring counties , heard of the masters ' advertisements for workmen ; and in their solitary dwellings grew weary of starvation , and resolved to come to Manchester . Foot - sore , way - worn , half - starved looking men they were , as they tried to steal into town in the early dawn , before people were astir , or late in the dusk of evening . And now began the real wrong - doing of the Trades ' Unions . As to their decision to work , or not , at such a particular rate of wages , that was either wise or unwise ; all error of judgment at the worst . But they had no right to tyrannise over others , and tie them down to their own procrustean bed . Abhorring what they considered oppression in the masters , why did they oppress others ? Because , when men get excited , they know not what they do . Judge , then , with something of the mercy of the Holy One , whom we all love . In spite of policemen set to watch over the safety of the poor country weavers,--in spite of magistrates , and prisons , and severe punishments,--the poor depressed men tramping in from Burnley , Padiham , and other places , to work at the condemned "
89065	89233	86724	86724	Them	2523	" were waylaid , and beaten , and left almost for dead by the road - side . The police broke up every lounging knot of men:--they separated quietly , to reunite half - a - mile further out of town . Of course the feeling between the masters and workmen did not improve under these circumstances . Combination is an awful power . It is like the equally mighty agency of steam ; capable of almost unlimited good or evil . But to obtain a blessing on its labours , it must work under the direction of a high and intelligent will ; incapable of being misled by passion , or excitement . The will of the operatives had not been guided to the calmness of wisdom . So much for generalities . Let us now return to individuals . A note , respectfully worded , although its tone of determination was strong , had been sent from the power - loom weavers , requesting that a "
89235	89510	86724	86724	Them	2523	" of them might have a meeting with the masters , to state the conditions they must have fulfilled before they would end the turn - out . They thought they had attained a sufficiently commanding position to dictate . John Barton was appointed one of the deputation . The masters agreed to this meeting , being anxious to end the strife , although undetermined among themselves how far they should yield , or whether they should yield at all . Some of the old , whose experience had taught them sympathy , were for concession . Others , white - headed men too , had only learnt hardness and obstinacy from the days of the years of their lives , and sneered at the more gentle and yielding . The younger men were one and all for an unflinching resistance to claims urged with so much violence . Of this party Harry Carson was the leader . But like all energetic people , the more he had to do the more time he seemed to find . With all his letter - writing , his calling , his being present at the New Bailey , when investigations of any case of violence against knob - sticks [ 44 ] were going on , he beset Mary more than ever . She was weary of her life for him . From blandishments he had even gone to threats -- threats that whether she would or not she should be his ; he showed an indifference that was almost insulting to every thing that might attract attention and injure her character . [ Footnote 44 : "
89515	90724	90725	90726	a man	4855	" those who consent to work at lower wages . ] And still she never saw Jem . She knew he had returned home . She heard of him occasionally through his cousin , who roved gaily from house to house , finding and making friends everywhere . But she never saw him . What was she to think ? Had he given her up ? Were a few hasty words , spoken in a moment of irritation , to stamp her lot through life ? At times she thought that she could bear this meekly , happy in her own constant power of loving . For of change or of forgetfulness she did not dream . Then at other times her state of impatience was such , that it required all her self - restraint to prevent her from going and seeking him out , and ( as man would do to man , or woman to woman ) begging him to forgive her hasty words , and allow her to retract them , and bidding him accept of the love that was filling her whole heart . She wished Margaret had not advised her against such a manner of proceeding ; she believed it was her friend 's words that seemed to make such a simple action impossible , in spite of all the internal urgings . But a friend 's advice is only thus powerful , when it puts into language the secret oracle of our souls . It was the whisperings of her womanly nature that caused her to shrink from any unmaidenly action , not Margaret 's counsel . All this time , this ten days or so , of Will 's visit to Manchester , there was something going on which interested Mary even now , and which , in former times , would have exceedingly amused and excited her . She saw as clearly as if told in words , that the merry , random , boisterous sailor had fallen deeply in love with the quiet , prim , somewhat plain Margaret : she doubted if Margaret was aware of it , and yet , as she watched more closely , she began to think some instinct made the blind girl feel whose eyes were so often fixed upon her pale face ; that some inner feeling made the delicate and becoming rose - flush steal over her countenance . She did not speak so decidedly as before ; there was a hesitation in her manner , that seemed to make her very attractive ; as if something softer , more loveable than excellent sense , were coming in as a motive for speech ; her eyes had always been soft , and were in no ways disfigured by her blindness , and now seemed to have a new charm , as they quivered under their white down - cast lids . She must be conscious , thought Mary,--heart answering heart . Will 's love had no blushings , no downcast eyes , no weighing of words ; it was as open and undisguised as his nature ; yet he seemed afraid of the answer its acknowledgment might meet with . It was Margaret 's angelic voice that had entranced him , and which made him think of her as a being of some other sphere , that he feared to woo . So he tried to propitiate Job in all manner of ways . He went over to Liverpool to rummage in his great sea - chest for the flying - fish ( no very odorous present by the way ) . He hesitated over a child 's caul for some time , which was , in his eyes , a far greater treasure than any Exocetus . What use could it be of to a landsman ? Then Margaret 's voice rang in his ears ; and he determined to sacrifice it , his most precious possession , to one whom she loved , as she did her grandfather . It was rather a relief to him , when , having put it and the flying - fish together in a brown paper parcel , and sat upon them for security all the way in the railroad , he found that Job was so indifferent to the precious caul , that he might easily claim it again . He hung about Margaret , till he had received many warnings and reproaches from his conscience in behalf of his dear aunt Alice 's claims upon his time . He went away , and then he bethought him of some other little word with Job . And he turned back , and stood talking once more in Margaret 's presence , door in hand , only waiting for some little speech of encouragement to come in and sit down again . But as the invitation was not given , he was forced to leave at last , and go and do his duty . Four days had Jem Wilson watched for Mr. Harry Carson without success ; his hours of going and returning to his home were so irregular , owing to the meetings and consultations among the masters , which were rendered necessary by the turn - out . On the fifth , without any purpose on Jem 's part , they met . It was the workmen 's dinner - hour , the interval between twelve and one ; when the streets of Manchester are comparatively quiet , for a few shopping ladies and lounging gentlemen count for nothing in that busy , bustling , living place . Jem had been on an errand for his master , instead of returning to his dinner ; and in passing along a lane , a road ( called , in compliment to the intentions of some future builder , a street ) , he encountered Harry Carson , the only person , as far as he saw beside himself , treading the unfrequented path . Along one side ran a high broad fence , blackened over by coal - tar , and spiked and stuck with pointed nails at the top , to prevent any one from climbing over into the garden beyond . By this fence was the foot - path . The carriage road was such as no carriage , no , not even a cart , could possibly have passed along , without Hercules to assist in lifting it out of the deep clay ruts . On the other side of the way was a dead brick wall ; and a field after that , where there was a sawpit , and joiner 's shed . Jem 's heart beat violently when he saw the gay , handsome young man approaching , with a light , buoyant step . This , then , was he whom Mary loved . It was , perhaps , no wonder ; for he seemed to the poor smith so elegant , so well - appointed , that he felt his superiority in externals , strangely and painfully , for an instant . Then something uprose within him , and told him , that "
90749	90798	90725	90726	a man	4855	" And he no longer felt troubled by the outward appearance of his rival . Harry Carson came on , lightly bounding over the dirty places with almost a lad 's buoyancy . To his surprise the dark , sturdy - looking artisan stopped him by saying respectfully , "
90810	90811	90800	90800	I	0	" "
90818	90838	90800	90800	I	0	" looking his astonishment ; then finding that the promised speech did not come very quickly , he added , "
90850	90890	90891	90891	I	0	" Jem had cast about for some less abrupt way of broaching the subject uppermost in his mind than he now found himself obliged to use . With a husky voice that trembled as he spoke , he said , "
90908	91053	90905	90906	Mary Barton	145	" A light broke in upon Harry Carson 's mind , and he paused before he gave the answer for which the other waited . Could this man be a lover of Mary 's ? And ( strange , stinging thought ) could he be beloved by her , and so have caused her obstinate rejection of himself ? He looked at Jem from head to foot , a black , grimy mechanic , in dirty fustian clothes , strongly built , and awkward ( according to the dancing - master ) ; then he glanced at himself , and recalled the reflection he had so lately quitted in his bed - room . It was impossible . No woman with eyes could choose the one when the other wooed . It was Hyperion to a Satyr . That quotation came aptly ; he forgot "
91065	91109	91058	91059	a man	4855	" And yet here was a clue , which he had often wanted , to her changed conduct towards him . If she loved this man . If-- he hated the fellow , and longed to strike him . He would know all . "
91148	91219	91142	91143	Mary Barton	145	" Jem bit his lips . Was it then so ; that Mary was a flirt , the giddy creature of whom he spoke ? He would not believe it , and yet how he wished the suggestive words unspoken . That thought must keep now , though . Even if she were , the more reason for there being some one to protect her ; poor , faulty darling . "
91251	91283	91286	91288	my fine fellow	2545	" he stopped ; he did not like to express suspicion , and yet he was determined he would be certain there was ground for none . What should he say ? "
91333	91398	91399	91399	I	0	" He seemed as though he would have gone on , but Jem put his black , working , right hand upon his arm to detain him . The haughty young man shook it off , and with his glove pretended to brush away the sooty contamination that might be left upon his light great - coat sleeve . The little action aroused Jem . "
91657	91879	91881	91881	I	0	" Jem 's voice quivered with the earnestness with which he spoke , and he eagerly waited for some answer . Harry Carson , meanwhile , instead of attending very particularly to the purpose the man had in addressing him , was trying to gather from his speech what was the real state of the case . He succeeded so far as to comprehend that Jem inclined to believe that Mary loved his rival ; and consequently , that if the speaker were attached to her himself , he was not a favoured admirer . The idea came into Mr. Carson 's mind , that perhaps , after all , Mary loved him in spite of her frequent and obstinate rejections ; and that she had employed this person ( whoever he was ) to bully him into marrying her . He resolved to try and ascertain more correctly the man 's relation to her . Either he was a lover , and if so , not a favoured one ( in which case Mr. Carson could not at all understand the man 's motives for interesting himself in securing her marriage ) ; or he was a friend , an accomplice , whom she had employed to bully him . So little faith in goodness have the mean and selfish ! "
91892	91902	91883	91883	you	2556	" said Mr. Carson , in a contemptuous tone , "
91936	91973	91923	91923	I	0	" He paused ; he wanted a distinct answer to this last supposition . None came ; so he began to imagine he was to be threatened into some engagement , and his angry spirit rose . "
92033	92053	92054	92054	You	2556	" Again he would have passed on , but Jem stood in a determined way before him , saying , "
92156	92157	92152	92152	I	0	" "
92165	92206	92207	92207	Father	4863	" replied Mr. Carson , who , having discovered what he wanted to know ( namely , that Jem was a lover of Mary 's , and that she was not encouraging his suit ) , wished to pass on . "
92214	92225	92226	92227	no one	1202	" ( with an emphasis on the word rejected ) , "
92261	92272	92256	92256	I	0	" as Jem still obstructed his path with dogged determination . "
92289	92323	92280	92280	you	5232	" replied the mechanic , grinding his words out between his teeth , and the livid paleness of the anger he could no longer keep down covering his face till he looked ghastly . "
92328	92336	92338	92338	I	0	" ( with a taunting laugh ) , "
92343	92482	92338	92338	I	0	" The young man raised his slight cane , and smote the artisan across the face with a stinging stroke . An instant afterwards he lay stretched in the muddy road , Jem standing over him , panting with rage . What he would have done next in his moment of ungovernable passion , no one knows ; but a policeman from the main street , into which this road led , had been sauntering about for some time , unobserved by either of the parties , and expecting some kind of conclusion like the present to the violent discussion going on between the two young men . In a minute he had pinioned Jem , who sullenly yielded to the surprise . Mr. Carson was on his feet directly , his face glowing with rage or shame . "
92497	92502	92484	92484	I	0	" said the policeman . "
92507	92512	92513	92513	I	0	" exclaimed Mr. Carson ; "
92528	92557	92558	92558	I	0	" he continued , hissing out his words to Jem , who even hated freedom procured for him , however justly , at the intervention of his rival , "
92570	92580	92568	92568	me	0	" he gasped the words in excess of passion , "
92591	92607	92609	92609	you	2578	" He laughed , as if with the consciousness of power . Jem replied with equal excitement--"And
92638	92694	92631	92631	God	224	" The policeman now interfered with persuasions and warnings . He locked his arm in Jem 's to lead him away in an opposite direction to that in which he saw Mr. Carson was going . Jem submitted gloomily , for a few steps , then wrenched himself free . The policeman shouted after him , "
92721	92738	92744	92745	the scorner	2586	" But Jem was out of hearing . CHAPTER XVI . MEETING BETWEEN MASTERS AND WORKMEN . "
92782	92783	92744	92745	the scorner	2586	" "
92788	93366	92744	92745	the scorner	2586	" The day arrived on which the masters were to have an interview with a deputation of the work - people . The meeting was to take place in a public room , at an hotel ; and there , about eleven o'clock , the mill - owners , who had received the foreign orders , began to collect . Of course , the first subject , however full their minds might be of another , was the weather . Having done their duty by all the showers and sunshine which had occurred during the past week , they fell to talking about the business which brought them together . There might be about twenty gentlemen in the room , including some by courtesy , who were not immediately concerned in the settlement of the present question ; but who , nevertheless , were sufficiently interested to attend . These were divided into little groups , who did not seem unanimous by any means . Some were for a slight concession , just a sugar - plum to quieten the naughty child , a sacrifice to peace and quietness . Some were steadily and vehemently opposed to the dangerous precedent of yielding one jot or one tittle to the outward force of a turn - out . It was teaching the work - people how to become masters , said they . Did they want the wildest thing heareafter , they would know that the way to obtain their wishes would be to strike work . Besides , one or two of those present had only just returned from the New Bailey , where one of the turn - outs had been tried for a cruel assault on a poor north - country weaver , who had attempted to work at the low price . They were indignant , and justly so , at the merciless manner in which the poor fellow had been treated ; and their indignation at wrong , took ( as it so often does ) the extreme form of revenge . They felt as if , rather than yield to the body of men who were resorting to such cruel measures towards their fellow - workmen , they , the masters , would sooner relinquish all the benefits to be derived from the fulfilment of the commission , in order that the workmen might suffer keenly . They forgot that the strike was in this instance the consequence of want and need , suffered unjustly , as the endurers believed ; for , however insane , and without ground of reason , such was their belief , and such was the cause of their violence . It is a great truth , that you can not extinguish violence by violence . You may put it down for a time ; but while you are crowing over your imaginary success , see if it does not return with seven devils worse than its former self ! No one thought of treating the workmen as brethren and friends , and openly , clearly , as appealing to reasonable men , stating the exact and full circumstances which led the masters to think it was the wise policy of the time to make sacrifices themselves , and to hope for them from the operatives . In going from group to group in the room , you caught such a medley of sentences as the following : "

93678	94803	93671	93671	I	0	" The door was now opened , and a waiter announced that the men were below , and asked if it were the pleasure of the gentlemen that they should be shown up . They assented , and rapidly took their places round the official table ; looking , as like as they could , to the Roman senators who awaited the irruption of Brennus and his Gauls . Tramp , tramp , came the heavy clogged feet up the stairs ; and in a minute five wild , earnest - looking men stood in the room . John Barton , from some mistake as to time , was not among them . Had they been larger boned men , you would have called them gaunt ; as it was , they were little of stature , and their fustian clothes hung loosely upon their shrunk limbs . In choosing their delegates , too , the operatives had had more regard to their brains , and power of speech , than to their wardrobes ; they might have read the opinions of that worthy Professor Teufelsdruch , in Sartor Resartus , to judge from the dilapidated coats and trousers , which yet clothed men of parts and of power . It was long since many of them had known the luxury of a new article of dress ; and air - gaps were to be seen in their garments . Some of the masters were rather affronted at such a ragged detachment coming between the wind and their nobility ; but what cared they ? At the request of a gentleman hastily chosen to officiate as chairman , the leader of the delegates read , in a high - pitched , psalm - singing voice , a paper , containing the operatives ' statement of the case at issue , their complaints , and their demands , which last were not remarkable for moderation . He was then desired to withdraw for a few minutes , with his fellow delegates , to another room , while the masters considered what should be their definitive answer . When the men had left the room , a whispered earnest consultation took place , every one re - urging his former arguments . The conceders carried the day , but only by a majority of one . The minority haughtily and audibly expressed their dissent from the measures to be adopted , even after the delegates re - entered the room ; their words and looks did not pass unheeded by the quick - eyed operatives ; their names were registered in bitter hearts . The masters could not consent to the advance demanded by the workmen . They would agree to give one shilling per week more than they had previously offered . Were the delegates empowered to accept such offer ? They were empowered to accept or decline any offer made that day by the masters . Then it might be as well for them to consult among themselves as to what should be their decision . They again withdrew . It was not for long . They came back , and positively declined any compromise of their demands . Then up sprang Mr. Henry Carson , the head and voice of the violent party among the masters , and addressing the chairman , even before the scowling operatives , he proposed some resolutions , which he , and those who agreed with him , had been concocting during this last absence of the deputation . They were , firstly , withdrawing the proposal just made , and declaring all communication between the masters and that particular Trades ' Union at an end ; secondly , declaring that no master would employ any workman in future , unless he signed a declaration that he did not belong to any Trades ' Union , and pledged himself not to assist or subscribe to any society , having for its object interference with the masters ' powers ; and , thirdly , that the masters should pledge themselves to protect and encourage all workmen willing to accept employment on those conditions , and at the rate of wages first offered . Considering that the men who now stood listening with lowering brows of defiance were all of them leading members of the Union , such resolutions were in themselves sufficiently provocative of animosity : but not content with simply stating them , Harry Carson went on to characterise the conduct of the workmen in no measured terms ; every word he spoke rendering their looks more livid , their glaring eyes more fierce . One among them would have spoken , but checked himself in obedience to the stern glance and pressure on his arm , received from the leader . Mr. Carson sat down , and a friend instantly got up to second the motion . It was carried , but far from unanimously . The chairman announced it to the delegates ( who had been once more turned out of the room for a division ) . They received it with deep brooding silence , but spake never a word , and left the room without even a bow . Now there had been some by - play at this meeting , not recorded in the Manchester newspapers , which gave an account of the more regular part of the transaction . While the men had stood grouped near the door , on their first entrance , Mr. Harry Carson had taken out his silver pencil , and had drawn an admirable caricature of them -- lank , ragged , dispirited , and famine - stricken . Underneath he wrote a hasty quotation from the fat knight 's well - known speech in Henry IV . He passed it to one of his neighbours , who acknowledged the likeness instantly , and by him it was sent round to others , who all smiled and nodded their heads . When it came back to its owner he tore the back of the letter on which it was drawn , in two ; twisted them up , and flung them into the fire - place ; but , careless whether they reached their aim or not , he did not look to see that they fell just short of any consuming cinders . This proceeding was closely observed by one of the men . He watched the masters as they left the hotel ( laughing , some of them were , at passing jokes ) , and when all had gone , he re - entered . He went to the waiter , who recognised him . "
94846	94894	94839	94839	I	0	" The waiter , good - natured and sympathetic , accompanied him up - stairs ; saw the paper picked up and untwisted , and then being convinced , by a hasty glance at its contents , that it was only what the man had called it , "
94901	94937	94837	94837	your	2603	" he allowed him to bear away his prize . Towards seven o'clock that evening many operatives began to assemble in a room in the Weavers ' Arms public - house , a room appropriated for "
94941	95144	94839	94839	I	0	" as the landlord , in his circular , on opening the premises , had described it . But , alas ! it was on no festive occasion that they met there on this night . Starved , irritated , despairing men , they were assembling to hear the answer that morning given by the masters to their delegates ; after which , as was stated in the notice , a gentleman from London would have the honour of addressing the meeting on the present state of affairs between the employers and the employed , or ( as he chose to term them ) the idle and the industrious classes . The room was not large , but its bareness of furniture made it appear so . Unshaded gas flared down upon the lean and unwashed artisans as they entered , their eyes blinking at the excess of light . They took their seats on benches , and awaited the deputation . The latter , gloomily and ferociously , delivered the masters ' ultimatum , adding thereunto not one word of their own ; and it sank all the deeper into the sore hearts of the listeners for their forbearance . Then the "
95148	95464	94839	94839	I	0	" ( who had been previously informed of the masters ' decision ) entered . You would have been puzzled to define his exact position , or what was the state of his mind as regarded education . He looked so self - conscious , so far from earnest , among the group of eager , fierce , absorbed men , among whom he now stood . He might have been a disgraced medical student of the Bob Sawyer class , or an unsuccessful actor , or a flashy shopman . The impression he would have given you would have been unfavourable , and yet there was much about him that could only be characterised as doubtful . He smirked in acknowledgment of their uncouth greetings , and sat down ; then glancing round , he inquired whether it would not be agreeable to the gentlemen present to have pipes and liquor handed round ; adding , that he would stand treat . As the man who has had his taste educated to love reading , falls devouringly upon books after a long abstinence , so these poor fellows , whose tastes had been left to educate themselves into a liking for tobacco , beer , and similar gratifications , gleamed up at the proposal of the London delegate . Tobacco and drink deaden the pangs of hunger , and make one forget the miserable home , the desolate future . They were now ready to listen to him with approbation . He felt it ; and rising like a great orator , with his right arm outstretched , his left in the breast of his waistcoat , he began to declaim , with a forced theatrical voice . After a burst of eloquence , in which he blended the deeds of the elder and the younger Brutus , and magnified the resistless might of the "
95469	95779	95780	95780	He	2604	" the Londoner descended to matter - of - fact business , and in his capacity this way he did not belie the good judgment of those who had sent him as delegate . Masses of people , when left to their own free choice , seem to have discretion in distinguishing men of natural talent ; it is a pity they so little regard temper and principles . He rapidly dictated resolutions , and suggested measures . He wrote out a stirring placard for the walls . He proposed sending delegates to entreat the assistance of other Trades ' Unions in other towns . He headed the list of subscribing Unions , by a liberal donation from that with which he was especially connected in London ; and what was more , and more uncommon , he paid down the money in real , clinking , blinking , golden sovereigns ! The money , alas , was cravingly required ; but before alleviating any private necessities on the morrow , small sums were handed to each of the delegates , who were in a day or two to set out on their expeditions to Glasgow , Newcastle , Nottingham , & amp;c . These men were most of them members of the deputation who had that morning waited upon the masters . After he had drawn up some letters , and spoken a few more stirring words , the gentleman from London withdrew , previously shaking hands all round ; and many speedily followed him out of the room , and out of the house . The newly - appointed delegates , and one or two others , remained behind to talk over their respective missions , and to give and exchange opinions in more homely and natural language than they dared to use before the London orator .

Deeper and darker grew the import of their speeches , as they stood hoarsely muttering their meaning out , and glaring , with eyes that told the terror their own thoughts were to them , upon their neighbours . Their clenched fists , their set teeth , their livid looks , all told the suffering their minds were voluntarily undergoing in the contemplation of crime , and in familiarising themselves with its details . Then came one of those fierce terrible oaths which bind members of Trades ' Unions to any given purpose . Then , under the flaring gaslight , they met together to consult further . With the distrust of guilt , each was suspicious of his neighbour ; each dreaded the treachery of another . A number of pieces of paper ( the identical letter on which the caricature had been drawn that very morning ) were torn up , and _ one was marked _ . Then all were folded up again , looking exactly alike . They were shuffled together in a hat . The gas was extinguished ; each drew out a paper . The gas was re - lighted . Then each went as far as he could from his fellows , and examined the paper he had drawn without saying a word , and with a countenance as stony and immovable as he could make it . Then , still rigidly silent , they each took up their hats and went every one his own way . He who had drawn the marked paper had drawn the lot of the assassin ! and he had sworn to act according to his drawing ! But no one save God and his own conscience knew who was the appointed murderer ! CHAPTER XVII . BARTON 'S NIGHT - ERRAND . "

She wondered if he disliked Will being there ; or if he were vexed to find that she had not got further on with her work .

She finished her bit of ironing , and began preparing the food she was sure her father needed ; for by this time her experience in the degrees of hunger had taught her that his present irritability was increased , if not caused , by want of food . He had had a sovereign given him to pay his expenses as delegate to Glasgow , and out of this he had given Mary a few shillings in the morning ; so she had been able to buy a sufficient meal , and now her care was to cook it so as most to tempt him .

He became again restless and fidgetty , scarcely giving Job Legh the greeting necessary for a host in his own house . Job , however , did not stand upon ceremony . He had come to pay a visit , and was not to be daunted from his purpose . He was interested in John Barton 's mission to Glasgow , and wanted to hear all about it ; so he sat down , and made himself comfortable , in a manner that Mary saw was meant to be stationary . "

So much the better , and perhaps she could cover her father 's rudeness by her own civility to so kind a friend . So half listening to her father 's movements up - stairs , ( passionate , violent , restless motions they were ) and half attending to Job Legh , she tried to pay him all due regard . "

Her father , as soon as he was out of sight , slackened his pace , and fell into that heavy listless step , which told as well as words could do , of hopelessness and weakness . It was getting dark , but he loitered on , returning no greeting to any one . A child 's cry caught his ear . His thoughts were running on little Tom ; on the dead and buried child of happier years .

So , aided by inquiries here and there from a passer - by , he led and carried the little fellow home , where his mother had been too busy to miss him , but now received him with thankfulness , and with an eloquent Irish blessing . When John heard the words of blessing , he shook his head mournfully , and turned away to retrace his steps . Let us leave him . Mary took her sewing after he had gone , and sat on , and sat on , trying to listen to Job , who was more inclined to talk than usual . She had conquered her feeling of impatience towards him so far as to be able to offer him her father 's rejected supper ; and she even tried to eat herself . But her heart failed her . A leaden weight seemed to hang over her ; a sort of presentiment of evil , or perhaps only an excess of low - spirited feeling in consequence of the two departures which had taken place that afternoon . She wondered how long Job Legh would sit . She did not like putting down her work , and crying before him , and yet she had never in her life longed so much to be alone in order to indulge in a good hearty burst of tears . "

Everything seemed going wrong . Will gone ; her father gone -- and so strangely too ! And to a place so mysteriously distant as Glasgow seemed to be to her ! She had felt his presence as a protection against Harry Carson and his threats ; and now she dreaded lest he should learn she was alone . Her heart began to despair , too , about Jem . She feared he had ceased to love her ; and she -- she only loved him more and more for his seeming neglect .

There sat her father , the shaded light of the candle - lamp falling upon , and softening his marked features , while his snowy hair contrasted well with the deep crimson morocco of the chair . The newspaper he had been reading had dropped on the carpet by his side . He breathed regularly and deeply . At that instant the words of Mrs. Hemans 's song came full into Sophy 's mind . "

He sank back in his chair , and hid his face in his hands , and bowed his head upon the table . The strong mahogany dining - table shook and rattled under his agony . Sophy went and put her arms round his bowed neck . "

Then he turned back and poured out a glass of wine from the decanter which yet remained on the table . His eye caught the wine - glass which Harry had used but two or three hours before . He sighed a long quivering sigh . And then mastering himself again , he left the room . "
106791	106979	106788	106789	Miss Sophy	213	" said nurse . Miss Carson went . She could not face death yet . The nurse followed Mr. Carson to the servants ' hall . There , on their dinner - table , lay the poor dead body . The men who had brought it were sitting near the fire , while several of the servants stood round the table , gazing at the remains . _ The remains ! _ One or two were crying ; one or two were whispering ; awed into a strange stillness of voice and action by the presence of the dead . When Mr. Carson came in they all drew back and looked at him with the reverence due to sorrow . He went forward and gazed long and fondly on the calm , dead face ; then he bent down and kissed the lips yet crimson with life . The policemen had advanced and stood ready to be questioned . But at first the old man 's mind could only take in the idea of death ; slowly , slowly came the conception of violence , of murder . "
106985	107247	106982	106982	he	2898	" he groaned forth . The policemen looked at each other . Then one began , and stated that having heard the report of a gun in Turner Street , he had turned down that way ( a lonely , unfrequented way Mr. Carson knew , but a short cut to his garden - door , of which Harry had a key ) ; that as he ( the policeman ) came nearer , he had heard footsteps as of a man running away ; but the evening was so dark ( the moon not having yet risen ) that he could see no one twenty yards off . That he had even been startled when close to the body by seeing it lying across the path at his feet . That he had sprung his rattle ; and when another policeman came up , by the light of the lantern they had discovered who it was that had been killed . That they believed him to be dead when they first took him up , as he had never moved , spoken , or breathed . That intelligence of the murder had been sent to the superintendent , who would probably soon be here . That two or three policemen were still about the place where the murder was committed , seeking out for some trace of the murderer . Having said this , they stopped speaking . Mr. Carson had listened attentively , never taking his eyes off the dead body . When they had ended , he said , "
107253	107305	107250	107250	he	2899	" They lifted up some of the thick chestnut curls , and showed a blue spot ( you could hardly call it a hole , the flesh had closed so much over it ) in the left temple . A deadly aim ! And yet it was so dark a night ! "

107330	107447	107323	107323	him	2899	" added the other . There was a little commotion at the door of the room , and there stood poor Mrs. Carson , the mother . She had heard unusual noises in the house , and had sent down her maid ( much more a companion to her than her highly - educated daughters ) to discover what was going on . But the maid either forgot , or dreaded , to return ; and with nervous impatience Mrs. Carson came down herself , and had traced the hum and buzz of voices to the servants ' hall . Mr. Carson turned round . But he could not leave the dead for any one living . "
107470	107586	107462	107463	Miss Sophy	213	" His eyes were again fixed on the dead face of his son . Presently Mrs. Carson 's hysterical cries were heard all over the house . Her husband shuddered at the outward expression of the agony which was rending his heart . Then the police superintendent came , and after him the doctor . The latter went through all the forms of ascertaining death , without uttering a word , and when at the conclusion of the operation of opening a vein , from which no blood flowed , he shook his head , all present understood the confirmation of their previous belief . The superintendent asked to speak to Mr. Carson in private . "
107599	107650	107591	107591	I	0	" answered he ; so he led the way into the dining - room , with the wine - glass still on the table . The door was carefully shut , and both sat down , each apparently waiting for the other to begin . At last Mr. Carson spoke . "

108045	108091	108092	108092	She	2928	" There was some one knocking at the door of the room . It was Sophy , who beckoned her father out , and then asked him , in an awe - struck whisper , to come up - stairs and speak to her mother . "
108117	108125	108114	108114	her	2928	" And the poor girl sobbed bitterly . "

108140	108351	108137	108137	his	209	" They went up stairs rapidly and silently . It was a large , comfortable bedroom ; too large to be well lighted by the flaring , flickering kitchen - candle which had been hastily snatched up , and now stood on the dressing - table . On the bed , surrounded by its heavy , pall - like green curtains , lay the dead son . They had carried him up , and laid him down , as tenderly as though they feared to waken him ; and , indeed , it looked more like sleep than death , so very calm and full of repose was the face . You saw , too , the chiselled beauty of the features much more perfectly than when the brilliant colouring of life had distracted your attention . There was a peace about him which told that death had come too instantaneously to give any previous pain . In a chair , at the head of the bed , sat the mother,--smiling . She held one of the hands ( rapidly stiffening , even in her warm grasp ) , and gently stroked the back of it , with the endearing caress she had used to all her children when young . "

Then the three sisters burst into unrestrained wailings . They were startled into the reality of life and death . And yet , in the midst of shrieks and moans , of shivering , and chattering of teeth , Sophy 's eye caught the calm beauty of the dead ; so calm amidst such violence , and she hushed her emotion . "

It was so common to him to be acquainted with crime , that he was far from feeling all his interest absorbed in the present case of violence , although he could not help having much anxiety to detect the murderer . He was busy looking at the only oil - painting in the room ( a youth of eighteen or so , in a fancy dress ) , and conjecturing its identity with the young man so mysteriously dead , when the door opened , and Mr. Carson returned . Stern as he had looked before leaving the room , he looked far sterner now . His face was hardened into deep - purposed wrath . "
108967	109121	108956	108956	I	0	" The superintendent bowed . They sat down , and spoke long together . One by one the policemen were called in , and questioned . All through the night there was bustle and commotion in the house . Nobody thought of going to bed . It seemed strange to Sophy to hear nurse summoned from her mother 's side to supper , in the middle of the night , and still stranger that she could go . The necessity of eating and drinking seemed out of place in the house of death . When night was passing into morning , the dining - room door opened , and two persons ' steps were heard along the hall . The superintendent was leaving at last . Mr. Carson stood on the front door - step , feeling the refreshment of the cooler morning air , and seeing the starlight fade away into dawn . "

To avenge his child 's death , the old man lived on ; with the single purpose in his heart of vengeance on the murderer . True , his vengeance was sanctioned by law , but was it the less revenge ? Are we worshippers of Christ ? or of Alecto ? Oh ! Orestes ! you would have made a very tolerable Christian of the nineteenth century ! CHAPTER XIX . JEM WILSON ARRESTED ON SUSPICION . "
109536	109724	109725	109725	Margaret	157	" COLERIDGE . I left Mary , on that same Thursday night which left its burden of woe at Mr. Carson 's threshold , haunted with depressing thoughts . All through the night she tossed restlessly about , trying to get quit of the ideas that harassed her , and longing for the light when she could rise , and find some employment . But just as dawn began to appear , she became more quiet , and fell into a sound heavy sleep , which lasted till she was sure it was late in the morning by the full light that shone in . She dressed hastily , and heard the neighbouring church - clock strike eight . It was far too late to do as she had planned ( after inquiring how Alice was , to return and tell Margaret ) , and she accordingly went in to inform the latter of her change of purpose , and the cause of it ; but on entering the house she found Job sitting alone , looking sad enough . She told him what she came for . "
109770	110180	110181	110181	I	0	" Mary could do nothing but feel guilty of her long morning nap , and hasten to follow Margaret 's steps ; for late as it was , she felt she could not settle well to her work , unless she learnt how kind good Alice Wilson was going on . So , eating her crust - of - bread breakfast , she passed rapidly along the streets . She remembered afterwards the little groups of people she had seen , eagerly hearing , and imparting news ; but at the time her only care was to hasten on her way , in dread of a reprimand from Miss Simmonds . She went into the house at Jane Wilson 's , her heart at the instant giving a strange knock , and sending the rosy flush into her face , at the thought that Jem might possibly be inside the door . But I do assure you , she had not thought of it before . Impatient and loving as she was , her solicitude about Alice on that hurried morning had not been mingled with any thought of him . Her heart need not have leaped , her colour need not have rushed so painfully to her cheeks , for he was not there . There was the round table , with a cup and saucer , which had evidently been used , and there was Jane Wilson sitting on the other side , crying quietly , while she ate her breakfast with a sort of unconscious appetite . And there was Mrs. Davenport washing away at a night - cap or so , which , by their simple , old - world make , Mary knew at a glance were Alice 's . But nothing -- no one else . Alice was much the same , or rather better of the two , they told her ; at any rate she could speak , though it was sad rambling talk . Would Mary like to see her ? Of course she would . Many are interested by seeing their friends under the new aspect of illness ; and among the poor there is no wholesome fear of injury or excitement to restrain this wish . So Mary went up - stairs , accompanied by Mrs. Davenport , wringing the suds off her hands , and speaking in a loud whisper far more audible than her usual voice . "
110259	110318	110253	110253	she	2960	" The room up - stairs held two beds , one superior in the grandeur of four posts and checked curtains to the other , which had been occupied by the twins in their brief life - time . The smaller had been Alice 's bed since she had lived there ; but with the natural reverence to one "
110325	110514	110253	110253	she	2960	" she had been installed since her paralytic stroke the evening before in the larger and grander bed , while Jane Wilson had taken her short broken rest on the little pallet . Margaret came forwards to meet her friend , whom she half expected , and whose step she knew . Mrs. Davenport returned to her washing . The two girls did not speak ; the presence of Alice awed them into silence . There she lay with the rosy colour , absent from her face since the days of childhood , flushed once more into it by her sickness nigh unto death . She lay on the affected side , and with her other arm she was constantly sawing the air , not exactly in a restless manner , but in a monotonous , incessant way , very trying to a watcher . She was talking away , too , almost as constantly , in a low , indistinct tone . But her face , her profiled countenance , looked calm and smiling , even interested by the ideas that were passing through her clouded mind . "
110517	110535	110538	110538	mother	4845	" said Margaret , as she stooped her head down to catch the muttered words more distinctly . "
110650	110764	110767	110767	Sally	162	" Margaret touched Mary 's hand , and the pressure in return told her that they understood each other ; that they knew how in this illness to the old , world - weary woman , God had sent her a veiled blessing : she was once more in the scenes of her childhood , unchanged and bright as in those long departed days ; once more with the sister of her youth , the playmate of fifty years ago , who had for nearly as many years slept in a grassy grave in the little church - yard beyond Burton . Alice 's face changed ; she looked sorrowful , almost penitent . "
110893	110973	110977	110977	mother	4845	" She stopped , and a few tears came stealing down the old withered cheek , at the thought of the temptation and deceit of her childhood . Surely , many sins could not have darkened that innocent child - like spirit since . Mary found a red - spotted pocket - handkerchief , and put it into the hand which sought about for something to wipe away the trickling tears . She took it with a gentle murmur . "

Oh ! happy night ! when would it come ? Many hours had yet to pass . Then she saw Alice , and repented , with a bitter self - reproach . But she could not help having gladness in the depths of her heart , blame herself as she would . So she tried not to think , as she hurried along to Miss Simmonds ' , with a dancing step of lightness . She was late -- that she knew she should be . Miss Simmonds was vexed and cross . That also she had anticipated , but she had intended to smooth her raven down by extraordinary diligence and attention . But there was something about the girls she did not understand -- had not anticipated . They stopped talking when she came in ; or rather , I should say , stopped listening , for Sally Leadbitter was the talker to whom they were hearkening with intense attention . At first they eyed Mary , as if she had acquired some new interest to them , since the day before . Then they began to whisper ; and , absorbed as Mary had been in her own thoughts , she could not help becoming aware that it was of her they spoke . At last Sally Leadbitter asked Mary if she had heard the news ? "
111568	111586	111292	111292	Mary	145	" answered she . The girls looked at each other with gloomy mystery . Sally went on . "
111600	111786	111592	111594	young Mr. Carson	209	" Mary 's lips could not utter a negative , but no one who looked at her pale and terror - stricken face could have doubted that she had not heard before of the fearful occurrence . Oh , it is terrible , that sudden information , that one you have known has met with a bloody death ! You seem to shrink from the world where such deeds can be committed , and to grow sick with the idea of the violent and wicked men of earth . Much as Mary had learned to dread him lately , now he was dead ( and dead in such a manner ) her feeling was that of oppressive sorrow for him . The room went round and round , and she felt as though she should faint ; but Miss Simmonds came in , bringing a waft of fresher air as she opened the door , to refresh the body , and the certainty of a scolding for inattention to brace the sinking mind . She , too , was full of the morning 's news . "
111800	111844	111797	111798	Miss Barton	329	" asked she , as she settled to her work . Mary tried to speak ; at first she could not , and when she succeeded in uttering a sentence , it seemed as though it were not her own voice that spoke . "

Mary took the print , and naturally enough , having had leave given her to cry over it , rather checked the inclination to weep . Every body was full of the one subject . The girl sent out to match silk , came back with the account gathered at the shop , of the coroner 's inquest then sitting ; the ladies who called to speak about gowns first began about the murder , and mingled details of that , with directions for their dresses . Mary felt as though the haunting horror were a nightmare , a fearful dream , from which awakening would relieve her . The picture of the murdered body , far more ghastly than the reality , seemed to swim in the air before her eyes . Sally Leadbitter looked and spoke of her , almost accusingly , and made no secret now of Mary 's conduct , more blameable to her fellow - workwomen for its latter changeableness , than for its former giddy flirting .

She longed for the peace of Alice 's sick room . No more thinking with infinite delight of her anticipated meeting with Jem , she felt too much shocked for that now ; but longing for peace and kindness , for the images of rest and beauty , and sinless times long ago , which the poor old woman 's rambling presented , she wished to be as near death as Alice ; and to have struggled through this world , whose sufferings she had early learnt , and whose crimes now seemed pressing close upon her . Old texts from the Bible that her mother used to read ( or rather spell out ) aloud , in the days of childhood , came up to her memory . "

112561	112850	112368	112368	his	2994	" & amp;c . And it was to that world Alice was hastening ! Oh ! that she were Alice ! I must return to the Wilsons ' house , which was far from being the abode of peace that Mary was picturing it to herself . You remember the reward Mr. Carson offered for the apprehension of the murderer of his son ? It was in itself a temptation , and to aid its efficacy came the natural sympathy for the aged parents mourning for their child , for the young man cut off in the flower of his days ; and besides this , there is always a pleasure in unravelling a mystery , in catching at the gossamer clue which will guide to certainty . This feeling , I am sure , gives much impetus to the police . Their senses are ever and always on the qui - vive , and they enjoy the collecting and collating evidence , and the life of adventure they experience : a continual unwinding of Jack Sheppard romances , always interesting to the vulgar and uneducated mind , to which the outward signs and tokens of crime are ever exciting . There was no lack of clue or evidence at the coroner 's inquest that morning . The shot , the finding of the body , the subsequent discovery of the gun , were rapidly deposed to ; and then the policeman who had interrupted the quarrel between Jem Wilson and the murdered young man was brought forward , and gave his evidence , clear , simple , and straightforward . The coroner had no hesitation , the jury had none , but the verdict was cautiously worded . "
112858	113158	112854	112856	some person unknown	2996	" This very cautiousness , when he deemed the thing so sure as to require no caution , irritated Mr. Carson . It did not soothe him that the superintendent called the verdict a mere form,--exhibited a warrant empowering him to seize the body of Jem Wilson , committed on suspicion,--declared his intention of employing a well - known officer in the Detective Service to ascertain the ownership of the gun , and to collect other evidence , especially as regarded the young woman , about whom the policeman deposed that the quarrel had taken place : Mr. Carson was still excited and irritable ; restless in body and mind . He made every preparation for the accusation of Jem the following morning before the magistrates : he engaged attorneys skilled in criminal practice to watch the case and prepare briefs ; he wrote to celebrated barristers coming the Northern Circuit , to bespeak their services . A speedy conviction , a speedy execution , seemed to be the only things that would satisfy his craving thirst for blood . He would have fain been policeman , magistrate , accusing speaker , all ; but most of all , the judge , rising with full sentence of death on his lips . That afternoon , as Jane Wilson had begun to feel the effect of a night 's disturbed rest , evinced in frequent droppings off to sleep while she sat by her sister - in - law 's bed - side , lulled by the incessant crooning of the invalid 's feeble voice , she was startled by a man speaking in the house - place below , who , wearied of knocking at the door , without obtaining any answer , had entered and was calling lustily for "
113163	113222	112854	112856	some person unknown	2996	" When Mrs. Wilson caught a glimpse of the intruder through the stair - rails , she at once saw he was a stranger , a working - man , it might be a fellow - labourer with her son , for his dress was grimy enough for the supposition . He held a gun in his hand . "
113237	113285	113224	113224	I	0	" She first looked at the man , and then , weary and half asleep , not seeing any reason for refusing to answer the inquiry , she moved forward to examine it , talking while she looked for certain old - fashioned ornaments on the stock . "
113388	113800	113368	113368	He	2919	" and the immediate cause for her anxiety being thus recalled to her mind , she entered on a long story of Alice 's illness , interspersed with recollections of her husband 's and her children 's deaths . The disguised policeman listened for a minute or two , to glean any further information he could ; and then , saying he was in a hurry , he turned to go away . She followed him to the door , still telling him her troubles , and was never struck , until it was too late to ask the reason , with the unaccountableness of his conduct , in carrying the gun away with him . Then , as she heavily climbed the stairs , she put away the wonder and the thought about his conduct , by determining to believe he was some workman with whom her son had made some arrangement about shooting at the gallery ; or mending the old weapon ; or something or other . She had enough to fret her , without moidering herself about old guns . Jem had given it him to bring to her ; so it was safe enough ; or , if it was not , why she should be glad never to set eyes on it again , for she could not abide fire - arms , they were so apt to shoot people . So , comforting herself for her want of thought in not making further inquiry , she fell off into another doze , feverish , dream - haunted , and unrefreshing . Meanwhile , the policeman walked off with his prize , with an odd mixture of feelings ; a little contempt , a little disappointment , and a good deal of pity . The contempt and the disappointment were caused by the widow 's easy admission of the gun being her son 's property , and her manner of identifying it by the ornaments . He liked an attempt to baffle him ; he was accustomed to it ; it gave some exercise to his wits and his shrewdness . There would be no fun in fox - hunting , if Reynard yielded himself up without any effort to escape . Then , again , his mother 's milk was yet in him , policeman , officer of the Detective Service though he was ; and he felt sorry for the old woman , whose "
113802	114208	114209	114209	Missis	211	" had given such material assistance in identifying her son as the murderer . However , he conveyed the gun , and the intelligence he had gained , to the superintendent ; and the result was , that , in a short time afterwards , three policemen went to the works at which Jem was foreman , and announced their errand to the astonished overseer , who directed them to the part of the foundry where Jem was then superintending a casting . Dark , black were the walls , the ground , the faces around them , as they crossed the yard . But , in the furnace - house a deep and lurid red glared over all ; the furnace roared with mighty flame . The men , like demons , in their fire - and - soot colouring , stood swart around , awaiting the moment when the tons of solid iron should have melted down into fiery liquid , fit to be poured , with still , heavy sound , into the delicate moulding of fine black sand , prepared to receive it . The heat was intense , and the red glare grew every instant more fierce ; the policemen stood awed with the novel sight . Then , black figures , holding strange - shaped bucket shovels , came athwart the deep - red furnace light , and clear and brilliant flowed forth the iron into the appropriate mould . The buzz of voices rose again ; there was time to speak , and gasp , and wipe the brows ; and then , one by one , the men dispersed to some other branch of their employment . No . B. 72 pointed out Jem as the man he had seen engaged in a scuffle with Mr. Carson , and then the other two stepped forward and arrested him , stating of what he was accused , and the grounds of the accusation . He offered no resistance , though he seemed surprised ; but calling a fellow - workman to him , he briefly requested him to tell his mother he had got into trouble , and could not return home at present . He did not wish her to hear more at first . So Mrs. Wilson 's sleep was next interrupted in almost an exactly similar way to the last , like a recurring nightmare . "

169712	170361	169591	169591	he	4197	" BURNS . She was where no words of peace , no soothing hopeful tidings could reach her ; in the ghastly spectral world of delirium . Hour after hour , day after day , she started up with passionate cries on her father to save Jem ; or rose wildly , imploring the winds and waves , the pitiless winds and waves , to have mercy ; and over and over again she exhausted her feverish fitful strength in these agonised entreaties , and fell back powerless , uttering only the wailing moans of despair . They told her Jem was safe , they brought him before her eyes ; but sight and hearing were no longer channels of information to that poor distracted brain , nor could human voice penetrate to her understanding . Jem alone gathered the full meaning of some of her strange sentences , and perceived that by some means or other she , like himself , had divined the truth of her father being the murderer . Long ago ( reckoning time by events and thoughts , and not by clock or dial - plate ) , Jem had felt certain that Mary 's father was Harry Carson 's murderer ; and although the motive was in some measure a mystery , yet a whole train of circumstances ( the principal of which was that John Barton had borrowed the fatal gun only two days before ) had left no doubt in Jem 's mind . Sometimes he thought that John had discovered , and thus bloodily resented , the attentions which Mr. Carson had paid to his daughter ; at others , he believed the motive to exist in the bitter feuds between the masters and their work - people , in which Barton was known to take so keen an interest . But if he had felt himself pledged to preserve this secret , even when his own life was the probable penalty , and he believed he should fall , execrated by Mary as the guilty destroyer of her lover , how much more was he bound now to labour to prevent any word of hers from inculpating her father , now that she was his own ; now that she had braved so much to rescue him ; and now that her poor brain had lost all guiding and controlling power over her words . All that night long Jem wandered up and down the narrow precincts of Ben Sturgis 's house . In the little bed - room where Mrs. Sturgis alternately tended Mary , and wept over the violence of her illness , he listened to her ravings ; each sentence of which had its own peculiar meaning and reference , intelligible to his mind , till her words rose to the wild pitch of agony , that no one could alleviate , and he could bear it no longer , and stole , sick and miserable down stairs , where Ben Sturgis thought it his duty to snore away in an arm - chair instead of his bed , under the idea that he should thus be more ready for active service , such as fetching the doctor to revisit his patient . Before it was fairly light , Jem ( wide - awake , and listening with an earnest attention he could not deaden , however painful its results proved ) heard a gentle subdued knock at the house door ; it was no business of his , to be sure , to open it , but as Ben slept on , he thought he would see who the early visitor might be , and ascertain if there was any occasion for disturbing either host or hostess . It was Job Legh who stood there , distinct against the outer light of the street . "

He saw her sitting up in bed , her golden hair , dimmed with her one day 's illness , floating behind her , her head bound round with wetted cloths , her features all agitated , even to distortion , with the pangs of her anxiety . Her lover 's eyes filled with tears . He could not hope . The elasticity of his heart had been crushed out of him by early sorrows ; and now , especially , the dark side of every thing seemed to be presented to him . What if she died , just when he knew the treasure , the untold treasure he possessed in her love ! What if ( worse than death ) she remained a poor gibbering maniac all her life long ( and mad people do live to be old sometimes , even under all the pressure of their burden ) , terror - distracted as she was now , and no one able to comfort her ! "
171391	171405	171406	171406	Jem	154	" said Job , partly guessing the other 's feelings by his own . "
171408	171437	171406	171406	Jem	154	" repeated he , arresting his attention before he spoke . Jem turned round , the little motion causing the tears to overflow and trickle down his cheeks . "
171451	172002	171438	171438	Thou	4237	" He spoke hushed , and low ; but the words sank all the more into Jem 's heart , and gave him strength to tear himself away . He found his mother ( notwithstanding that she had but just regained her child through Mary 's instrumentality ) half inclined to resent his having passed the night in anxious devotion to the poor invalid . She dwelt on the duties of children to their parents ( above all others ) , till Jem could hardly believe the relative positions they had held only yesterday , when she was struggling with and controlling every instinct of her nature , only because _ he _ wished it . However , the recollection of that yesterday , with its hair 's breadth between him and a felon 's death , and the love that had lightened the dark shadow , made him bear with the meekness and patience of a true - hearted man all the worrying little acerbities of to - day ; and he had no small merit in so doing ; for in him , as in his mother , the re - action after intense excitement had produced its usual effect in increased irritability of the nervous system . They found Alice alive , and without pain . And that was all . A child of a few weeks old would have had more bodily strength ; a child of a very few months old , more consciousness of what was passing before her . But even in this state she diffused an atmosphere of peace around her . True , Will , at first , wept passionate tears at the sight of her , who had been as a mother to him , so standing on the confines of life . But even now , as always , loud passionate feeling could not long endure in the calm of her presence . The firm faith which her mind had no longer power to grasp , had left its trail of glory ; for by no other word can I call the bright happy look which illumined the old earth - worn face . Her talk , it is true , bore no more that constant earnest reference to God and His holy Word which it had done in health , and there were no death - bed words of exhortation from the lips of one so habitually pious . For still she imagined herself once again in the happy , happy realms of childhood ; and again dwelling in the lovely northern haunts where she had so often longed to be . Though earthly sight was gone away , she beheld again the scenes she had loved from long years ago ! she saw them without a change to dim the old radiant hues . The long dead were with her , fresh and blooming as in those bygone days . And death came to her as a welcome blessing , like as evening comes to the weary child . Her work here was finished , and faithfully done . What better sentence can an emperor wish to have said over his bier ? In second childhood ( that blessing clouded by a name ) , she said her "

172037	172393	172394	172394	Margaret	157	" She never spoke again on this side Heaven . She died the day after their return from Liverpool . From that time , Jem became aware that his mother was jealously watching for some word or sign which should betoken his wish to return to Mary . And yet go to Liverpool he must and would , as soon as the funeral was over , if but for a single glimpse of his darling . For Job had never written ; indeed , any necessity for his so doing had never entered his head . If Mary died , he would announce it personally ; if she recovered , he meant to bring her home with him . Writing was to him little more than an auxiliary to natural history ; a way of ticketing specimens , not of expressing thoughts . The consequence of this want of intelligence as to Mary 's state was , that Jem was constantly anticipating that every person and every scrap of paper was to convey to him the news of her death . He could not endure this state long ; but he resolved not to disturb the house by announcing to his mother his purposed intention of returning to Liverpool , until the dead had been carried forth . On Sunday afternoon they laid her low with many tears . Will wept as one who would not be comforted . The old childish feeling came over him , the feeling of loneliness at being left among strangers . By and bye , Margaret timidly stole near him , as if waiting to console ; and soon his passion sank down to grief , and grief gave way to melancholy , and though he felt as if he never could be joyful again , he was all the while unconsciously approaching nearer to the full happiness of calling Margaret his own , and a golden thread was interwoven even now with the darkness of his sorrow . Yet it was on his arm that Jane Wilson leant on her return homewards . Jem took charge of Margaret . "

He found he had better speak out , and put his intention at once to the right motive ; the subterfuge about setting Job Legh at liberty had done him harm instead of good . "

She disliked the idea of seeming to throw herself in his way ; and yet she did not like to say any thing of this feeling to Jem , who had all along seemed perfectly unconscious of any love - affair , besides his own , in progress . So Margaret gave a reluctant consent . "

But the object was accomplished by Will 's going up - stairs immediately on their return to the house , to indulge his mournful thoughts alone . As soon as Jem and his mother were left by themselves , he began on the subject uppermost in his mind . "
173196	173239	173240	173240	Mother	4845	" She put her handkerchief from her eyes , and turned quickly round so as to face him where he stood , thinking what best to say . The little action annoyed him , and he rushed at once into the subject . "

For an instant his mother was interested by his words ; and then came back the old jealousy of being supplanted in the affections of that son , who had been , as it were , newly born to her , by the escape he had so lately experienced from danger . So she hardened her heart against entertaining any feeling of sympathy ; and turned away from the face , which recalled the earnest look of his childhood , when he had come to her in some trouble , sure of help and comfort . And coldly she spoke , in those tones which Jem knew and dreaded , even before the meaning they expressed was fully shaped . "

175108	175906	175106	175106	Margaret	157	" She let him out and bolted the door behind him . He stood on the steps to adjust some fastening about the bundle . The court , the street , was deeply still . Long ago had all retired to rest on that quiet Sabbath evening . The stars shone down on the silent deserted streets , and the soft clear moonlight fell in bright masses , leaving the steps on which Jem stood in shadow . A foot - fall was heard along the pavement ; slow and heavy was the sound . Before Jem had ended his little piece of business , a form had glided into sight ; a wan , feeble figure , bearing , with evident and painful labour , a jug of water from the neighbouring pump . It went before Jem , turned up the court at the corner of which he was standing , passed into the broad , calm light ; and there , with bowed head , sinking and shrunk body , Jem recognised John Barton . No haunting ghost could have had less of the energy of life in its involuntary motions than he , who , nevertheless , went on with the same measured clock - work tread until the door of his own house was reached . And then he disappeared , and the latch fell feebly to , and made a faint and wavering sound , breaking the solemn silence of the night . Then all again was still . For a minute or two Jem stood motionless , stunned by the thoughts which the sight of Mary 's father had called up . Margaret did not know he was at home : had he stolen like a thief by dead of night into his own dwelling ? Depressed as Jem had often and long seen him , this night there was something different about him still ; beaten down by some inward storm , he seemed to grovel along , all self - respect lost and gone . Must he be told of Mary 's state ? Jem felt he must not ; and this for many reasons . He could not be informed of her illness without many other particulars being communicated at the same time , of which it were better he should be kept in ignorance ; indeed , of which Mary herself could alone give the full explanation . No suspicion that he was the criminal seemed hitherto to have been excited in the mind of any one . Added to these reasons was Jem 's extreme unwillingness to face him , with the belief in his breast that he , and none other , had done the fearful deed . It was true that he was Mary 's father , and as such had every right to be told of all concerning her ; but supposing he were , and that he followed the impulse so natural to a father , and wished to go to her , what might be the consequences ? Among the mingled feelings she had revealed in her delirium , ay , mingled even with the most tender expressions of love for her father , was a sort of horror of him ; a dread of him as a blood - shedder , which seemed to separate him into two persons,--one , the father who had dandled her on his knee , and loved her all her life long ; the other , the assassin , the cause of all her trouble and woe . If he presented himself before her while this idea of his character was uppermost , who might tell the consequence ? Jem could not , and would not , expose her to any such fearful chance : and to tell the truth , I believe he looked upon her as more his own , to guard from all shadow of injury with most loving care , than as belonging to any one else in this world , though girt with the reverend name of Father , and guiltless of aught that might have lessened such reverence . If you think this account of mine confused , of the half - feelings , half - reasons , which passed through Jem 's mind , as he stood gazing at the empty space , where that crushed form had so lately been seen,--if you are perplexed to disentangle the real motives , I do assure you it was from just such an involved set of thoughts that Jem drew the resolution to act as if he had not seen that phantom likeness of John Barton ; himself , yet not himself . CHAPTER XXXIV . THE RETURN HOME . "
175965	175968	175969	175969	KERHONAH	404	" ELLIOTT 'S "
175971	177090	175969	175969	KERHONAH	404	" Mary still hovered between life and death when Jem arrived at the house where she lay ; and the doctors were as yet unwilling to compromise their wisdom by allowing too much hope to be entertained . But the state of things , if not less anxious , was less distressing than when Jem had quitted her . She lay now in a stupor , which was partly disease , and partly exhaustion after the previous excitement . And now Jem found the difficulty which every one who has watched by a sick bed knows full well ; and which is perhaps more insurmountable to men than it is to women,--the difficulty of being patient , and trying not to expect any visible change for long , long hours of sad monotony . But after awhile the reward came . The laboured breathing became lower and softer , the heavy look of oppressive pain melted away from the face , and a languor that was almost peace took the place of suffering . She slept a natural sleep ; and they stole about on tip - toe , and spoke low , and softly , and hardly dared to breathe , however much they longed to sigh out their thankful relief . She opened her eyes . Her mind was in the tender state of a lately - born infant 's . She was pleased with the gay but not dazzling colours of the paper ; soothed by the subdued light ; and quite sufficiently amused by looking at all the objects in the room,--the drawing of the ships , the festoons of the curtain , the bright flowers on the painted backs of the chairs,--to care for any stronger excitement . She wondered at the ball of glass , containing various coloured sands from the Isle of Wight , or some such place , which hung suspended from the middle of the little valance over the window . But she did not care to exert herself to ask any questions , although she saw Mrs. Sturgis standing at the bed - side with some tea , ready to drop it into her mouth by spoonfuls . She did not see the face of honest joy , of earnest thankfulness,--the clasped hands,--the beaming eyes,--the trembling eagerness of gesture , of one who had long awaited her awakening , and who now stood behind the curtains watching through some little chink her every faint motion ; or if she had caught a glimpse of that loving , peeping face , she was in too exhausted a state to have taken much notice , or have long retained the impression that he she loved so well was hanging about her , and blessing God for every conscious look which stole over her countenance . She fell softly into slumber , without a word having been spoken by any one during that half hour of inexpressible joy . And again the stillness was enforced by sign and whispered word , but with eyes that beamed out their bright thoughts of hope . Jem sat by the side of the bed , holding back the little curtain , and gazing as if he could never gaze his fill at the pale , wasted face , so marbled and so chiselled in its wan outline . She wakened once more ; her soft eyes opened , and met his over - bending look . She smiled gently , as a baby does when it sees its mother tending its little cot ; and continued her innocent , infantine gaze into his face , as if the sight gave her much unconscious pleasure . But by - and - by a different expression came into her sweet eyes ; a look of memory and intelligence ; her white face flushed the brightest rosy red , and with feeble motion she tried to hide her head in the pillow . It required all Jem 's self - control to do what he knew and felt to be necessary , to call Mrs. Sturgis , who was quietly dozing by the fireside ; and that done , he felt almost obliged to leave the room to keep down the happy agitation which would gush out in every feature , every gesture , and every tone . From that time forward Mary 's progress towards health was rapid . There was every reason , but one , in favour of her speedy removal home . All Jem 's duties lay in Manchester . It was his mother 's dwelling - place , and there his plans for life had been to be worked out ; plans , which the suspicion and imprisonment he had fallen into , had thrown for a time into a chaos , which his presence was required to arrange into form . For he might find , in spite of a jury 's verdict , that too strong a taint was on his character for him ever to labour in Manchester again . He remembered the manner in which some one suspected of having been a convict was shunned by masters and men , when he had accidentally met with work in their foundry ; the recollection smote him now , how he himself had thought that it did not become an honest upright man to associate with one who had been a prisoner . He could not choose but think on that poor humble being , with his downcast conscious look ; hunted out of the work - shop , where he had sought to earn an honest livelihood , by the looks , and half - spoken words , and the black silence of repugnance ( worse than words to bear ) , that met him on all sides . Jem felt that his own character had been attainted ; and that to many it might still appear suspicious . He knew that he could convince the world , by a future as blameless as his past had been , that he was innocent . But at the same time he saw that he must have patience , and nerve himself for some trials ; and the sooner these were undergone , the sooner he was aware of the place he held in men 's estimation , the better . He longed to have presented himself once more at the foundry ; and then the reality would drive away the pictures that would ( unbidden ) come of a shunned man , eyed askance by all , and driven forth to shape out some new career . I said every reason "
177093	177433	177436	177436	Jem	154	" inclined Jem to hasten Mary 's return as soon as she was sufficiently convalescent . That one was the meeting which awaited her at home . Turn it over as Jem would , he could not decide what was the best course to pursue . He could compel himself to any line of conduct that his reason and his sense of right told him to be desirable ; but they did not tell him it was desirable to speak to Mary , in her tender state of mind and body , of her father . How much would be implied by the mere mention of his name ! Speak it as calmly , and as indifferently as he might , he could not avoid expressing some consciousness of the terrible knowledge she possessed . She , for her part , was softer and gentler than she had ever been in her gentlest mood ; since her illness , her motions , her glances , her voice were all tender in their languor . It seemed almost a trouble to her to break the silence with the low sounds of her own sweet voice , and her words fell sparingly on Jem 's greedy , listening ear . Her face was , however , so full of love and confidence , that Jem felt no uneasiness at the state of silent abstraction into which she often fell . If she did but love him , all would yet go right ; and it was better not to press for confidence on that one subject which must be painful to both . There came a fine , bright , balmy day . And Mary tottered once more out into the open air , leaning on Jem 's arm , and close to his beating heart . And Mrs. Sturgis watched them from her door , with a blessing on her lips , as they went slowly up the street . They came in sight of the river . Mary shuddered . "

Then again he felt as if she were the best judge , and knowing all ( perhaps more than even he did ) might be forming plans which his interference would mar . One thing was certain ! it was a miserable thing to have this awful forbidden ground of discourse ; to guess at each other 's thoughts , when eyes were averted , and cheeks blanched , and words stood still , arrested in their flow by some casual allusion . At last a day , fine enough for Mary to travel on , arrived . She had wished to go , but now her courage failed her . How could she have said she was weary of that quiet house , where even Ben Sturgis ' grumblings only made a kind of harmonious bass in the concord between him and his wife , so thoroughly did they know each other with the knowledge of many years ! How could she have longed to quit that little peaceful room where she had experienced such loving tendence ! Even the very check bed - curtains became dear to her under the idea of seeing them no more . If it was so with inanimate objects , if they had such power of exciting regret , what were her feelings with regard to the kind old couple , who had taken the stranger in , and cared for her , and nursed her , as though she had been a daughter ? Each wilful sentence spoken in the half unconscious irritation of feebleness came now with avenging self - reproach to her memory , as she hung about Mrs. Sturgis , with many tears , which served instead of words to express her gratitude and love . Ben bustled about with the square bottle of Goldenwasser in one of his hands , and a small tumbler in the other ; he went to Mary , Jem , and his wife in succession , pouring out a glass for each and bidding them drink it to keep their spirits up : but as each severally refused , he drank it himself ; and passed on to offer the same hospitality to another with the like refusal , and the like result . When he had swallowed the last of the three draughts , he condescended to give his reasons for having done so . "
178216	178288	178213	178213	my	0	" So saying , he replaced the bottle in the cupboard . It was he who in a firm commanding voice at last told Jem and Mary to be off , or they would be too late . Mrs. Sturgis had kept up till then ; but as they left her house , she could no longer restrain her tears , and cried aloud in spite of her husband 's upbraiding . "
178300	178316	178290	178290	they	4342	" exclaimed she , with a degree of hope , as the clock struck two . "
178401	178773	178392	178392	Jack	332	" When they reached Manchester , Mary looked very white , and the expression on her face was almost stern . She was in fact summoning up her resolution to meet her father if he were at home . Jem had never named his midnight glimpse of John Barton to human being ; but Mary had a sort of presentiment that wander where he would , he would seek his home at last . But in what mood she dreaded to think . For the knowledge of her father 's capability of guilt seemed to have opened a dark gulf in his character , into the depths of which she trembled to look . At one moment she would fain have claimed protection against the life she must lead , for some time at least , alone with a murderer ! She thought of his gloom , before his mind was haunted by the memory of so terrible a crime ; his moody , irritable ways . She imagined the evenings as of old : she , toiling at some work , long after houses were shut , and folks abed ; he , more savage than he had ever been before with the inward gnawing of his remorse . At such times she could have cried aloud with terror , at the scenes her fancy conjured up . But her filial duty , nay , her love and gratitude for many deeds of kindness done to her as a little child , conquered all fear . She would endure all imaginable terrors , although of daily occurrence . And she would patiently bear all wayward violence of temper ; more than patiently would she bear it -- pitifully , as one who knew of some awful curse awaiting the blood - shedder . She would watch over him tenderly , as the Innocent should watch over the Guilty ; awaiting the gracious seasons , wherein to pour oil and balm into the bitter wounds . With the untroubled peace which the resolve to endure to the end gives , she approached the house that from habit she still called home , but which possessed the holiness of home no longer . "
178776	178797	178774	178774	Jem	154	" said she , as they stood at the entrance to the court , close by Job Legh 's door , "
178850	178855	178856	178856	Mary	145	" She sighed heavily . "
178900	178948	178949	178950	Dear Jem	147	" She put her hand on his arm , as he spoke in a loud agitated tone ; she looked into his face with upbraiding love in her eyes , and then she said , while her lips quivered , and he felt her whole frame trembling : "
179064	179685	179062	179062	you	147	" And so saying she left him . She went quicker than she would otherwise have passed over those few yards of ground , for fear he should still try to accompany her . Her hand was on the latch , and in a breath the door was opened . There sat her father , still and motionless -- not even turning his head to see who had entered ; but perhaps he recognised the foot - step,--the trick of action . He sat by the fire ; the grate I should say , for fire there was none . Some dull , gray ashes , negligently left , long days ago , coldly choked up the bars . He had taken the accustomed seat from mere force of habit , which ruled his automaton - body . For all energy , both physical and mental , seemed to have retreated inwards to some of the great citadels of life , there to do battle against the Destroyer , Conscience . His hands were crossed , his fingers interlaced ; usually a position implying some degree of resolution , or strength ; but in him it was so faintly maintained , that it appeared more the result of chance ; an attitude requiring some application of outward force to alter,--and a blow with a straw seemed as though it would be sufficient . And as for his face , it was sunk and worn,--like a skull , with yet a suffering expression that skulls have not ! Your heart would have ached to have seen the man , however hardly you might have judged his crime . But crime and all was forgotten by his daughter , as she saw his abashed look , his smitten helplessness . All along she had felt it difficult ( as I may have said before ) to reconcile the two ideas , of her father and a blood - shedder . But now it was impossible . He was her father ! her own dear father ! and in his sufferings , whatever their cause , more dearly loved than ever before . His crime was a thing apart , never more to be considered by her . And tenderly did she treat him , and fondly did she serve him in every way that heart could devise , or hand execute . She had some money about her , the price of her strange services as a witness ; and when the lingering dusk drew on , she stole out to effect some purchases necessary for her father 's comfort . For how body and soul had been kept together , even as much as they were , during the days he had dwelt alone , no one can say . The house was bare as when Mary had left it , of coal , or of candle , of food , or of blessing in any shape . She came quickly home ; but as she passed Job Legh 's door , she stopped . Doubtless Jem had long since gone ; and doubtless , too , he had given Margaret some good reason for not intruding upon her friend for this night at least , otherwise Mary would have seen her before now . But to - morrow,--would she not come in to - morrow ? And who so quick as blind Margaret in noticing tones , and sighs , and even silence ? She did not give herself time for further thought , her desire to be once more with her father was too pressing ; but she opened the door , before she well knew what to say . "
179705	179745	179702	179703	Mary Barton	145	" Margaret 's joy at meeting her , the open demonstration of her love , affected Mary much ; she could not keep from crying , and sat down weak and agitated on the first chair she could find . "
179819	179845	179846	179846	Thou	4357	" Margaret held her hand , and gently smiled into her face . Job Legh took the candle up , and began a leisurely inspection . "
179909	179934	179935	179935	Father	245	" For Mary had sickened at the mention of that name ; yet she felt that now or never was the time to speak . "
179940	179944	179935	179935	Father	245	" she said , "
179977	180039	179962	179962	I	0	" She spoke hastily , and ( to her own idea ) in an unnatural manner . But they did not seem to notice it , nor to take the hint she had thrown out of company being unacceptable ; for Job Legh directly put down some insect , which he was impaling on a corking - pin , and exclaimed , "
180083	180084	180073	180073	I	0	" "
180120	180139	180140	180140	you	156	" said she at last , in despair , seeing Job still persevere in putting away his things ; "
180220	180955	180215	180215	you	156	" For Job was muttering away in high dudgeon , and even Margaret 's tone was altered as she wished Mary good night . Just then she could ill brook coldness from any one , and least of all bear the idea of being considered ungrateful by so kind and zealous a friend as Job had been ; so she turned round suddenly , even when her hand was on the latch of the door , and ran back , and threw her arms about his neck , and kissed him first , and then Margaret . And then , the tears fast - falling down her cheeks , but no word spoken , she hastily left the house , and went back to her home . There was no change in her father 's position , or in his spectral look . He had answered her questions ( but few in number , for so many subjects were unapproachable ) by monosyllables , and in a weak , high , childish voice ; but he had not lifted his eyes ; he could not meet his daughter 's look . And she , when she spoke , or as she moved about , avoided letting her eyes rest upon him . She wished to be her usual self ; but while every thing was done with a consciousness of purpose , she felt it was impossible . In this manner things went on for some days . At night he feebly clambered up stairs to bed ; and during those long dark hours Mary heard those groans of agony which never escaped his lips by day , when they were compressed in silence over his inward woe . Many a time she sat up listening , and wondering if it would ease his miserable heart if she went to him , and told him she knew all , and loved and pitied him more than words could tell . By day the monotonous hours wore on in the same heavy , hushed manner as on that first dreary afternoon . He ate,--but without relish ; and food seemed no longer to nourish him , for each morning his face had caught more of the ghastly fore - shadowing of Death . The neighbours kept strangely aloof . Of late years John Barton had had a repellent power about him , felt by all , except to the few who had either known him in his better and happier days , or those to whom he had given his sympathy and his confidence . People did not care to enter the doors of one whose very depth of thoughtfulness rendered him moody and stern . And now they contented themselves with a kind inquiry when they saw Mary in her goings - out or in her comings - in . With her oppressing knowledge , she imagined their reserved conduct stranger than it was in reality . She missed Job and Margaret too ; who , in all former times of sorrow or anxiety since their acquaintance first began , had been ready with their sympathy . But most of all she missed the delicious luxury she had lately enjoyed in having Jem 's tender love at hand every hour of the day , to ward off every wind of heaven , and every disturbing thought . She knew he was often hovering about the house ; though the knowledge seemed to come more by intuition , than by any positive sight or sound for the first day or two . On the third day she met him at Job Legh 's . They received her with every effort of cordiality ; but still there was a cobweb - veil of separation between them , to which Mary was morbidly acute ; while in Jem 's voice , and eyes , and manner , there was every evidence of most passionate , most admiring , and most trusting love . The trust was shown by his respectful silence on that one point of reserve on which she had interdicted conversation . He left Job Legh 's house when she did . They lingered on the step , he holding her hand between both of his , as loth to let her go ; he questioned her as to when he should see her again . "
180964	180968	180956	180956	Mother	161	" whispered he . "

181018	181152	181016	181016	Jem	147	" The next day , the fourth from Mary 's return home , as she was sitting near the window , sadly dreaming over some work , she caught a glimpse of the last person she wished to see -- of Sally Leadbitter ! She was evidently coming to their house ; another moment , and she tapped at the door . John Barton gave an anxious , uneasy side - glance . Mary knew that if she delayed answering the knock , Sally would not scruple to enter ; so as hastily as if the visit had been desired , she opened the door , and stood there with the latch in her hand , barring up all entrance , and as much as possible obstructing all curious glances into the interior . "
181184	181272	181174	181174	I	0	" She was bent on coming in , and saw Mary 's preventive design . So she stood on tip - toe , looking over Mary 's shoulders into the room where she suspected a lover to be lurking ; but instead , she saw only the figure of the stern , gloomy father she had always been in the habit of avoiding ; and she dropped down again , content to carry on the conversation where Mary chose , and as Mary chose , in whispers . "
181319	181447	181303	181303	You	145	" Mary gave a low moan,--and then implored Sally to change the subject ; for unpleasant as it always was , it was doubly unpleasant in the manner in which she was treating it . If they had been alone , Mary would have borne it patiently,--or so she thought,--but now she felt almost certain her father was listening ; there was a subdued breathing , a slight bracing - up of the listless attitude . But there was no arresting Sally 's curiosity to hear all she could respecting the adventures Mary had experienced . She , in common with the rest of Miss Simmonds ' young ladies , was almost jealous of the fame that Mary had obtained ; to herself , such miserable notoriety . "

Only his head was more bowed towards the ground . She put on her bonnet to go to Ancoats ; for see , and question , and comfort , and worship Jem , she must . As she hung about her father for an instant before leaving him , he spoke -- voluntarily spoke for the first time since her return ; but his head was drooping so low she could not hear what he said , so she stooped down ; and after a moment 's pause , he repeated the words , "
182316	182351	182304	182305	Jem Wilson	154	" Could he have overheard her conversation with Sally Leadbitter ? They had whispered low , she thought . Pondering on this , and many other things , she reached Ancoats . CHAPTER XXXV . "

183039	183081	183037	183037	father	4863	" said Mary , suddenly breaking that delicious silence with the one sharp discord in her present life . She looked up at her lover 's grave face ; and then the message her father had sent flashed across her memory . "

Yet a little more lovers ' loitering ; a few more words , in themselves nothing -- to you nothing , but to those two what tender passionate language can I use to express the feelings which thrilled through that young man and maiden , as they listened to the syllables made dear and lovely through life by that hour 's low - whispered talk . It struck the half hour past seven . "
183331	183463	183327	183327	Mary	145	" So they went in . Jane Wilson was rather chafed at her son 's delay in returning home , for as yet he had managed to keep her in ignorance of his dismissal from the foundry ; and it was her way to prepare some little pleasure , some little comfort for those she loved ; and if they , unwittingly , did not appear at the proper time to enjoy her preparation , she worked herself up into a state of fretfulness which found vent in upbraidings as soon as ever the objects of her care appeared , thereby marring the peace which should ever be the atmosphere of a home , however humble ; and causing a feeling almost amounting to loathing to arise at the sight of the "
183467	183640	183327	183327	Mary	145	" which , though an effect and proof of careful love , has been the cause of so much disturbance . Mrs. Wilson had first sighed , and then grumbled to herself , over the increasing toughness of the potato - cakes she had made for her son 's tea . The door opened , and he came in ; his face brightening into proud smiles , Mary Barton hanging on his arm , blushing and dimpling , with eye - lids veiling the happy light of her eyes,--there was around the young couple a radiant atmosphere -- a glory of happiness . Could his mother mar it ? Could she break into it with her Martha - like cares ? Only for one moment did she remember her sense of injury,--her wasted trouble,--and then , her whole woman 's heart heaving with motherly love and sympathy , she opened her arms , and received Mary into them , as , shedding tears of agitated joy , she murmured in her ear , "

But the time for his meeting John Barton drew on : and it was a long way to his house . As they walked briskly thither they hardly spoke ; though many thoughts were in their minds . The sun had not long set , but the first faint shade of twilight was over all ; and when they opened the door , Jem could hardly perceive the objects within by the waning light of day , and the flickering fire - blaze . But Mary saw all at a glance ! Her eye , accustomed to what was usual in the aspect of the room , saw instantly what was unusual,--saw , and understood it all . Her father was standing behind his habitual chair , holding by the back of it as if for support . And opposite to him there stood Mr. Carson ; the dark out - line of his stern figure looming large against the light of the fire in that little room . Behind her father sat Job Legh , his head in his hands , and resting his elbows on the little family table,--listening evidently ; but as evidently deeply affected by what he heard . There seemed to be some pause in the conversation . Mary and Jem stood at the half - open door , not daring to stir ; hardly to breathe . "

John Barton gasped , but not with fear . It was only that he felt it terrible to have inspired such hatred , as was concentrated into every word , every gesture of Mr. Carson 's . "

But as Mr. Carson was on the point of leaving the house with no sign of relenting about him , he was again stopped by John Barton , who had risen once more from his chair , and stood supporting himself on Jem , while he spoke .

185233	185743	185224	185225	my God	4466	" cried the old man aloud . The eyes of John Barton grew dim with tears . Rich and poor , masters and men , were then brothers in the deep suffering of the heart ; for was not this the very anguish he had felt for little Tom , in years so long gone by that they seemed like another life ! The mourner before him was no longer the employer ; a being of another race , eternally placed in antagonistic attitude ; going through the world glittering like gold , with a stony heart within , which knew no sorrow but through the accidents of Trade ; no longer the enemy , the oppressor , but a very poor and desolate old man . The sympathy for suffering , formerly so prevalent a feeling with him , again filled John Barton 's heart , and almost impelled him to speak ( as best he could ) some earnest , tender words to the stern man , shaking in his agony . But who was he , that he should utter sympathy or consolation ? The cause of all this woe . Oh blasting thought ! Oh miserable remembrance ! He had forfeited all right to bind up his brother 's wounds . Stunned by the thought , he sank upon the seat , almost crushed with the knowledge of the consequences of his own action ; for he had no more imagined to himself the blighted home , and the miserable parents , than does the soldier , who discharges his musket , picture to himself the desolation of the wife , and the pitiful cries of the helpless little ones , who are in an instant to be made widowed and fatherless . To intimidate a class of men , known only to those below them as desirous to obtain the greatest quantity of work for the lowest wages,--at most to remove an overbearing partner from an obnoxious firm , who stood in the way of those who struggled as well as they were able to obtain their rights,--this was the light in which John Barton had viewed his deed ; and even so viewing it , after the excitement had passed away , the Avenger , the sure Avenger , had found him out . But now he knew that he had killed a man , and a brother,--now he knew that no good thing could come out of this evil , even to the sufferers whose cause he had so blindly espoused . He lay across the table , broken - hearted . Every fresh quivering sob of Mr. Carson 's stabbed him to his soul . He felt execrated by all ; and as if he could never lay bare the perverted reasonings which had made the performance of undoubted sin appear a duty . The longing to plead some faint excuse grew stronger and stronger . He feebly raised his head , and looking at Job Legh , he whispered out , "
185766	185780	185764	185764	sir	5232	" said he wildly , almost throwing himself at Mr. Carson 's feet , "

185907	186125	185830	185830	we	4469	" There are blasphemous actions as well as blasphemous words : all unloving , cruel deeds are acted blasphemy . Mr. Carson left the house . And John Barton lay on the ground as one dead . They lifted him up , and almost hoping that that deep trance might be to him the end of all earthly things , they bore him to his bed . For a time they listened with divided attention to his faint breathings ; for in each hasty hurried step that echoed in the street outside , they thought they heard the approach of the officers of justice . When Mr. Carson left the house he was dizzy with agitation ; the hot blood went careering through his frame . He could not see the deep blue of the night - heavens for the fierce pulses which throbbed in his head . And partly to steady and calm himself , he leaned against a railing , and looked up into those calm majestic depths with all their thousand stars . And by - and - by his own voice returned upon him , as if the last words he had spoken were being uttered through all that infinite space ; but in their echoes there was a tone of unutterable sorrow . "
186144	186494	186495	186495	You	4473	" He tried to shake off the spiritual impression made by this imagination . He was feverish and ill,--and no wonder . So he turned to go homewards ; not , as he had threatened , to the police - office . After all ( he told himself ) , that would do in the morning . No fear of the man 's escaping , unless he escaped to the grave . So he tried to banish the phantom voices and shapes which came unbidden to his brain , and to recall his balance of mind by walking calmly and slowly , and noticing every thing which struck his senses . It was a warm soft evening in spring , and there were many persons in the streets . Among others , a nurse with a little girl in her charge , conveying her home from some children 's gaiety ; a dance most likely , for the lovely little creature was daintily decked out in soft , snowy muslin ; and her fairy feet tripped along by her nurse 's side as if to the measure of some tune she had lately kept time to . Suddenly up behind her there came a rough , rude errand - boy , nine or ten years of age ; a giant he looked by the fairy - child , as she fluttered along . I do n't know how it was , but in some awkward way he knocked the poor little girl down upon the hard pavement as he brushed rudely past , not much caring whom he hurt , so that he got along . The child arose sobbing with pain ; and not without cause , for blood was dropping down from the face , but a minute before so fair and bright -- dropping down on the pretty frock , making those scarlet marks so terrible to little children . The nurse , a powerful woman , had seized the boy , just as Mr. Carson ( who had seen the whole transaction ) came up . "
186526	186585	186524	186524	you	4473	" accompanying every sentence with a violent jerk of passionate anger . The lad looked hard and defying ; but withal terrified at the threat of the policeman , those ogres of our streets to all unlucky urchins . The nurse saw it , and began to drag him along , with a view of making what she called "
186590	186620	186524	186524	you	4473	" His terror increased , and with it his irritation ; when the little sweet face , choking away its sobs , pulled down nurse 's head and said , "
186680	186706	186662	186662	you	2842	" And she put up her little mouth to be kissed by her injurer , just as she had been taught to do at home to "

The latter took no apparent heed of the remark , but passed on . But the child 's pleading reminded him of the low , broken voice he had so lately heard , penitently and humbly urging the same extenuation of his great guilt . "
186819	186932	186734	186736	that little lady	4481	" He had some association with those words ; he had heard , or read of that plea somewhere before . Where was it ? Could it be-- ? He would look when he got home . So when he entered his house he went straight and silently up - stairs to his library , and took down the great large handsome Bible , all grand and golden , with its leaves adhering together from the bookbinder 's press , so little had it been used . On the first page ( which fell open to Mr. Carson 's view ) were written the names of his children , and his own . "
186952	187259	187260	187260	They	4483	" To make the entry complete , his death should now be added . But the page became hidden by the gathering mist of tears . Thought upon thought , and recollection upon recollection came crowding in , from the remembrance of the proud day when he had purchased the costly book , in order to write down the birth of the little babe of a day old . He laid his head down on the open page , and let the tears fall slowly on the spotless leaves . His son 's murderer was discovered ; had confessed his guilt ; and yet ( strange to say ) he could not hate him with the vehemence of hatred he had felt , when he had imagined him a young man , full of lusty life , defying all laws , human and divine . In spite of his desire to retain the revengeful feeling he considered as a duty to his dead son , something of pity would steal in for the poor , wasted skeleton of a man , the smitten creature , who had told him of his sin , and implored his pardon that night . In the days of his childhood and youth , Mr. Carson had been accustomed to poverty ; but it was honest , decent poverty ; not the grinding squalid misery he had remarked in every part of John Barton 's house , and which contrasted strangely with the pompous sumptuousness of the room in which he now sat . Unaccustomed wonder filled his mind at the reflection of the different lots of the brethren of mankind . Then he roused himself from his reverie , and turned to the object of his search -- the Gospel , where he half expected to find the tender pleading : "
187267	187463	187464	187464	You	4484	" It was murk midnight by this time , and the house was still and quiet . There was nothing to interrupt the old man in his unwonted study . Years ago , the Gospel had been his task - book in learning to read . So many years ago , that he had become familiar with the events before he could comprehend the Spirit that made the Life . He fell to the narrative now afresh , with all the interest of a little child . He began at the beginning , and read on almost greedily , understanding for the first time the full meaning of the story . He came to the end ; the awful End . And there were the haunting words of pleading . He shut the book , and thought deeply . All night long , the Archangel combated with the Demon . All night long , others watched by the bed of Death . John Barton had revived to fitful intelligence . He spoke at times with even something of his former energy ; and in the racy Lancashire dialect he had always used when speaking freely . "

Mary and Jem together waited the approach of death ; but as the final struggle drew on , and morning dawned , Jem suggested some alleviation to the gasping breath , to purchase which he left the house in search of a druggist 's shop , which should be open at that early hour . During his absence , Barton grew worse ; he had fallen across the bed , and his breathing seemed almost stopped ; in vain did Mary strive to raise him , her sorrow and exhaustion had rendered her too weak . So , on hearing some one enter the house - place below , she cried out for Jem to come to her assistance . A step , which was not Jem 's , came up the stairs . Mr. Carson stood in the door - way . In one instant he comprehended the case . He raised up the powerless frame ; and the departing soul looked out of the eyes with gratitude . He held the dying man propped in his arms . John Barton folded his hands as if in prayer . "

188470	189060	188438	188438	He	224	" BYRON . Although Mary had hardly been conscious of her thoughts , and it had been more like a secret instinct informing her soul , than the result of any process of reasoning , she had felt for some time ( ever since her return from Liverpool , in fact ) , that for her father there was but one thing to be desired and anticipated , and that was death ! She had seen that Conscience had given the mortal wound to his earthly frame ; she did not dare to question of the infinite mercy of God , what the Future Life would be to him . Though at first desolate and stunned by the blow which had fallen on herself , she was resigned and submissive as soon as she recovered strength enough to ponder and consider a little ; and you may be sure that no tenderness or love was wanting on Jem 's part , and no consideration and sympathy on that of Job and Margaret , to soothe and comfort the girl who now stood alone in the world as far as blood - relations were concerned . She did not ask or care to know what arrangements they were making in whispered tones with regard to the funeral . She put herself into their hands with the trust of a little child ; glad to be undisturbed in the reveries and remembrances which filled her eyes with tears , and caused them to fall quietly down her pale cheeks . It was the longest day she had ever known in her life ; every charge and every occupation was taken away from her : but perhaps the length of quiet time thus afforded was really good , although its duration weighed upon her ; for by this means she contemplated her situation in every light , and fully understood that the morning 's event had left her an orphan ; and thus she was spared the pangs caused to us by the occurrence of death in the evening , just before we should naturally , in the usual course of events , lie down to slumber . For in such case , worn out by anxiety , and it may be by much watching , our very excess of grief rocks itself to sleep , before we have had time to realise its cause ; and we waken , with a start of agony like a fresh stab , to the consciousness of the one awful vacancy , which shall never , while the world endures , be filled again . The day brought its burden of duty to Mrs. Wilson . She felt bound by regard , as well as by etiquette , to go and see her future daughter - in - law . And by an old association of ideas ( perhaps of death with church - yards , and churches with Sunday ) she thought it necessary to put on her best , and latterly unused clothes , the airing of which on a little clothes - horse before the fire seemed to give her a not unpleasing occupation . When Jem returned home late in the evening succeeding John Barton 's death , weary and oppressed with the occurrences and excitements of the day , he found his mother busy about her mourning , and much inclined to talk . Although he longed for quiet , he could not avoid sitting down and answering her questions . "

Many of the difficulties to be anticipated in preserving the secret would be obviated , if he could induce his mother to fall into the plan he had named to Mary of emigrating to Canada . The reasons which rendered this secrecy desirable related to the domestic happiness he hoped for . With his mother 's irritable temper he could hardly expect that all allusion to the crime of John Barton would be for ever restrained from passing her lips , and he knew the deep trial such references would be to Mary . Accordingly he resolved as soon as possible in the morning to go to Job and beseech his silence ; he trusted that secrecy in that quarter , even if the knowledge had been extended to Margaret , might be easily secured . But what would be Mr. Carson 's course ? Were there any means by which he might be persuaded to spare John Barton 's memory ? He was roused up from this train of thought by his mother 's more irritated tone of voice . "

The first thing was to seek an interview with Mr. Duncombe , his former master . Accordingly , early the next morning Jem set off on his walk to the works , where for so many years his days had been spent ; where for so long a time his thoughts had been thought , his hopes and fears experienced . It was not a cheering feeling to remember that henceforward he was to be severed from all these familiar places ; nor were his spirits enlivened by the evident feelings of the majority of those who had been his fellow - workmen . As he stood in the entrance to the foundry , awaiting Mr. Duncombe 's leisure , many of those employed in the works passed him on their return from breakfast ; and with one or two exceptions , without any acknowledgment of former acquaintance beyond a distant nod at the utmost .

And with his path growing clearer and clearer before him the longer he contemplated it , he went to see Mary , and if he judged it fit , to tell her what he had decided upon . Margaret was sitting with her . "

Meanwhile Jane Wilson had donned her Sunday suit of black , and set off on her errand of condolence . She felt nervous and uneasy at the idea of the moral sayings and texts which she fancied were expected from visitors on occasions like the present ; and prepared many a good set speech as she walked towards the house of mourning . As she gently opened the door , Mary , sitting idly by the fire , caught a glimpse of her,--of Jem 's mother,--of the early friend of her dead parents,--of the kind minister to many a little want in days of childhood,--and rose and came and fell about her neck , with many a sob and moan , saying , "

190951	190960	190943	190944	Poor wench	4866	" said Jane Wilson , tenderly kissing her . "
191098	191822	191823	191825	The rich man	4785	" Mrs. Wilson was weeping herself long before she had ended this speech , which was so different to all she had planned to say , and from all the formal piety she had laid in store for the visit ; for this was heart 's piety , and needed no garnish of texts to make it true religion , pure and undefiled . They sat together on the same chair , their arms encircling each other ; they wept for the same dead ; they had the same hope , and trust , and overflowing love in the living . From that time forward , hardly a passing cloud dimmed the happy confidence of their intercourse ; even by Jem would his mother 's temper sooner be irritated than by Mary ; before the latter she repressed her occasional nervous ill - humour till the habit of indulging it was perceptibly decreased . Years afterwards in conversation with Jem , he was startled by a chance expression which dropped from his mother 's lips ; it implied a knowledge of John Barton 's crime . It was many a long day since they had seen any Manchester people who could have revealed the secret ( if indeed it was known in Manchester , against which Jem had guarded in every possible way ) . And he was led to inquire first as to the extent , and then as to the source of her knowledge . It was Mary herself who had told all . For on the morning to which this chapter principally relates , as Mary sat weeping , and as Mrs. Wilson comforted her by every tenderest word and caress , she revealed to the dismayed and astonished Jane , the sting of her deep sorrow ; the crime which stained her dead father 's memory . She was quite unconscious that Jem had kept it secret from his mother ; she had imagined it bruited abroad as the suspicion against her lover had been ; so word after word ( dropped from her lips in the supposition that Mrs. Wilson knew all ) had told the tale and revealed the cause of her deep anguish ; deeper than is ever caused by Death alone . On large occasions like the present , Mrs. Wilson 's innate generosity came out . Her weak and ailing frame imparted its irritation to her conduct in small things , and daily trifles ; but she had deep and noble sympathy with great sorrows , and even at the time that Mary spoke she allowed no expression of surprise or horror to escape her lips . She gave way to no curiosity as to the untold details ; she was as secret and trustworthy as her son himself ; and if in years to come her anger was occasionally excited against Mary , and she , on rare occasions , yielded to ill - temper against her daughter - in - law , she would upbraid her for extravagance , or stinginess , or over - dressing , or under - dressing , or too much mirth or too much gloom , but never , never in her most uncontrolled moments did she allude to any one of the circumstances relating to Mary 's flirtation with Harry Carson , or his murderer ; and always when she spoke of John Barton , named him with the respect due to his conduct before the last , miserable , guilty month of his life . Therefore it came like a blow to Jem when , after years had passed away , he gathered his mother 's knowledge of the whole affair . From the day when he learnt ( not without remorse ) what hidden depths of self - restraint she had in her soul , his manner to her , always tender and respectful , became reverential ; and it was more than ever a loving strife between him and Mary which should most contribute towards the happiness of the declining years of their mother . But I am speaking of the events which have occurred only lately , while I have yet many things to tell you that happened six or seven years ago . CHAPTER XXXVII . DETAILS CONNECTED WITH THE MURDER .

191866	192596	191847	191847	he	5145	" Mr. Carson stood at one of the breathing - moments of life . The object of the toils , the fears , and the wishes of his past years , was suddenly hidden from his sight,--vanished into the deep mystery which circumscribes existence . Nay , even the vengeance which he had proposed to himself as an aim for exertion , had been taken away from before his eyes , as by the hand of God . Events like these would have startled the most thoughtless into reflection , much more such a man as Mr. Carson , whose mind , if not enlarged , was energetic ; indeed , whose very energy , having been hitherto the cause of the employment of his powers in only one direction , had prevented him from becoming largely and philosophically comprehensive in his views . But now the foundations of his past life were razed to the ground , and the place they had once occupied was sown with salt , to be for ever rebuilt no more . It was like the change from this Life to that other hidden one , when so many of the motives which have actuated all our earthly existence , will have become more fleeting than the shadows of a dream . With a wrench of his soul from the past , so much of which was as nothing , and worse than nothing to him now , Mr. Carson took some hours , after he had witnessed the death of his son 's murderer , to consider his situation . But suddenly , while he was deliberating , and searching for motives which should be effective to compel him to exertion and action once more ; while he contemplated the desire after riches , social distinction , a name among the merchant - princes amidst whom he moved , and saw these false substances fade away into the shadows they truly are , and one by one disappear into the grave of his son,--suddenly , I say , the thought arose within him that more yet remained to be learned about the circumstances and feelings which had prompted John Barton 's crime ; and when once this mournful curiosity was excited , it seemed to gather strength in every moment that its gratification was delayed . Accordingly he sent a message to summon Job Legh and Jem Wilson , from whom he promised himself some elucidation of what was as yet unexplained ; while he himself set forth to call on Mr. Bridgenorth , whom he knew to have been Jem 's attorney , with a glimmering suspicion intruding on his mind , which he strove to repel , that Jem might have had some share in his son 's death . He had returned before his summoned visitors arrived ; and had time enough to recur to the evening on which John Barton had made his confession . He remembered with mortification how he had forgotten his proud reserve , and his habitual concealment of his feelings , and had laid bare his agony of grief in the presence of these two men who were coming to see him by his desire ; and he entrenched himself behind stiff barriers of self - control , through which he hoped no appearance of emotion would force its way in the conversation he anticipated . Nevertheless , when the servant announced that two men were there by appointment to speak to him , and he had desired that they might be shown into the library where he sat , any watcher might have perceived by the trembling hands , and shaking head , not only how much he was aged by the occurrences of the last few weeks , but also how much he was agitated at the thought of the impending interview . But he so far succeeded in commanding himself at first , as to appear to Jem Wilson and Job Legh one of the hardest and most haughty men they had ever spoken to , and to forfeit all the interest which he had previously excited in their minds by his unreserved display of deep and genuine feeling . When he had desired them to be seated , he shaded his face with his hand for an instant before speaking . "

195869	196447	195854	195854	God	224	" Jem had maintained a manly and dignified reserve ever since he had made his open statement of all he knew . Now both the men rose and bowed low , looking at Mr. Carson with the deep human interest they could not fail to take in one who had endured and forgiven a deep injury ; and who struggled hard , as it was evident he did , to bear up like a man under his affliction . He bowed low in return to them . Then he suddenly came forward and shook them by the hand ; and thus , without a word more , they parted . There are stages in the contemplation and endurance of great sorrow , which endow men with the same earnestness and clearness of thought that in some of old took the form of Prophecy . To those who have large capability of loving and suffering , united with great power of firm endurance , there comes a time in their woe , when they are lifted out of the contemplation of their individual case into a searching inquiry into the nature of their calamity , and the remedy ( if remedy there be ) which may prevent its recurrence to others as well as to themselves . Hence the beautiful , noble efforts which are from time to time brought to light , as being continuously made by those who have once hung on the cross of agony , in order that others may not suffer as they have done ; one of the grandest ends which sorrow can accomplish ; the sufferer wrestling with God 's messenger until a blessing is left behind , not for one alone but for generations . It took time before the stern nature of Mr. Carson was compelled to the recognition of this secret of comfort , and that same sternness prevented his reaping any benefit in public estimation from the actions he performed ; for the character is more easily changed than the habits and manners originally formed by that character , and to his dying day Mr. Carson was considered hard and cold by those who only casually saw him , or superficially knew him . But those who were admitted into his confidence were aware , that the wish which lay nearest to his heart was that none might suffer from the cause from which he had suffered ; that a perfect understanding , and complete confidence and love , might exist between masters and men ; that the truth might be recognised that the interests of one were the interests of all , and as such , required the consideration and deliberation of all ; that hence it was most desirable to have educated workers , capable of judging , not mere machines of ignorant men ; and to have them bound to their employers by the ties of respect and affection , not by mere money bargains alone ; in short , to acknowledge the Spirit of Christ as the regulating law between both parties . Many of the improvements now in practice in the system of employment in Manchester , owe their origin to short , earnest sentences spoken by Mr. Carson . Many and many yet to be carried into execution , take their birth from that stern , thoughtful mind , which submitted to be taught by suffering . CHAPTER XXXVIII . CONCLUSION . "
196492	196665	196486	196486	us	4680	" BARRY CORNWALL . Not many days after John Barton 's funeral was over , all was arranged respecting Jem 's appointment at Toronto ; and the time was fixed for his sailing . It was to take place almost immediately : yet much remained to be done ; many domestic preparations were to be made ; and one great obstacle , anticipated by both Jem and Mary , to be removed . This was the opposition they expected from Mrs. Wilson , to whom the plan had never yet been named . They were most anxious that their home should continue ever to be hers , yet they feared that her dislike to a new country might be an insuperable objection to this . At last Jem took advantage of an evening of unusual placidity , as he sat alone with his mother just before going to bed , to broach the subject ; and to his surprise she acceded willingly to his proposition of her accompanying himself and his wife . "

The next day he applied to the police ; and at last they recognised under his description of her , a woman known to them under the name of the "
197547	197642	197476	197476	your	4705	" from the gaiety of her dress a year or two ago . By their help he traced out one of her haunts , a low lodging - house behind Peter Street . He and his companion , a kind - hearted policeman , were admitted , suspiciously enough , by the landlady , who ushered them into a large garret where twenty or thirty people of all ages and both sexes lay and dozed away the day , choosing the evening and night for their trades of beggary , thieving , or prostitution .

Leaving many messages for her , and directions that he was to be sent for if either the policeman or the landlady obtained any clue to her where - abouts , Jem bent his steps towards Mary 's house ; for he had not seen her all that long day of search . He told her of his proceedings and want of success ; and both were saddened at the recital , and sat silent for some time . After a while they began talking over their plans . In a day or two , Mary was to give up house , and go and live for a week or so with Job Legh , until the time of her marriage , which would take place immediately before sailing ; they talked themselves back into silence and delicious reverie . Mary sat by Jem , his arm round her waist , her head on his shoulder ; and thought over the scenes which had passed in that home she was so soon to leave for ever . Suddenly she felt Jem start , and started too without knowing why ; she tried to see his countenance , but the shades of evening had deepened so much she could read no expression there . It was turned to the window ; she looked and saw a white face pressed against the panes on the outside , gazing intently into the dusky chamber . While they watched , as if fascinated by the appearance , and unable to think or stir , a film came over the bright , feverish , glittering eyes outside , and the form sank down to the ground without a struggle of instinctive resistance . "
198167	198380	198165	198165	Esther	132	" exclaimed they , both at once . They rushed outside ; and , fallen into what appeared simply a heap of white or light - coloured clothes , fainting or dead , lay the poor crushed Butterfly -- the once innocent Esther . She had come ( as a wounded deer drags its heavy limbs once more to the green coolness of the lair in which it was born , there to die ) to see the place familiar to her innocence , yet once again before her death . Whether she was indeed alive or dead , they knew not now . Job came in with Margaret , for it was bed - time . He said Esther 's pulse beat a little yet . They carried her upstairs and laid her on Mary 's bed , not daring to undress her , lest any motion should frighten the trembling life away ; but it was all in vain . Towards midnight , she opened wide her eyes and looked around on the once familiar room ; Job Legh knelt by the bed praying aloud and fervently for her , but he stopped as he saw her roused look . She sat up in bed with a sudden convulsive motion . "
198388	198548	198549	198549	He	4717	" asked she wildly . Then with a habit , which came like instinct even in that awful dying hour , her hand sought for a locket which hung concealed in her bosom , and , finding that , she knew all was true which had befallen her since last she lay an innocent girl on that bed . She fell back , and spoke word never more . She held the locket containing her child 's hair still in her hand , and once or twice she kissed it with a long soft kiss . She cried feebly and sadly as long as she had any strength to cry , and then she died . They laid her in one grave with John Barton . And there they lie without name , or initial , or date . Only this verse is inscribed upon the stone which covers the remains of these two wanderers . Psalm ciii . v. 9.--"For
