2852	2856	2828	2828	he	232	“ What ones ? ”
2857	2870	2828	2828	he	232	“ Oh , a number ; I do n't know how many . ”
2871	2881	2828	2828	he	232	“ Will you let us see you do them ? ”
2882	2887	2888	2889	the others	240	“ Do -- please ! ”
2892	2900	2888	2889	the others	240	“ You wo n't run away again ? ”
2901	2916	2828	2828	he	232	“ No -- indeed we wo n't . Please do . Wo n't you ? ”
2917	2934	2888	2889	the others	240	“ Yes , with pleasure ; but you must n't forget your promise , you know . ”

3117	3152	3114	3114	he	232	“ and everything else your appetites call for ; and you need not name the thing you wish ; as long as I am with you , you have only to wish and find . ”
3327	3331	3332	3332	he	232	“ An angel , ”
3658	3661	3653	3653	he	260	“ Satan , ”
3691	3709	3653	3653	he	260	“ She is an idiot to step backward like that and not notice what she is about . ”
3755	3768	3752	3752	I	0	“ Nothing , only it seemed a strange name for an angel . ”
3773	3789	3769	3769	He	19	“ Because it's -- it's -- well , it 's his name , you know . ”
3790	3798	3799	3799	He	19	“ Yes -- he is my uncle . ”
3845	3857	3818	3818	He	19	“ Do n't you remember?--he was an angel himself , once . ”
3858	3865	3867	3867	Seppi	26	“ Yes -- it 's true , ”
3869	3877	3867	3867	Seppi	26	“ I did n't think of that . ”
3878	3886	3818	3818	He	19	“ Before the Fall he was blameless . ”
3887	3890	3892	3892	Nikolaus	25	“ Yes , ”
3894	3900	3892	3892	Nikolaus	25	“ he was without sin . ”
3901	3910	3912	3912	Satan	19	“ It is a good family -- ours , ”
3914	3933	3912	3912	Satan	19	“ there is not a better . He is the only member of it that has ever sinned . ”
4075	4154	4062	4062	he	19	“ It would n't be a rudeness , and I should forgive it if it was . Have I seen him ? Millions of times . From the time that I was a little child a thousand years old I was his second favorite among the nursery angels of our blood and lineage -- to use a human phrase -- yes , from that time until the Fall , eight thousand years , measured as you count time . ”
4155	4160	4056	4056	Satan	19	“ Eight -- thousand ! ”
4161	4164	4165	4165	He	19	“ Yes . ”
4184	4227	4165	4165	He	19	“ Why , naturally I look like a boy , for that is what I am . With us what you call time is a spacious thing ; it takes a long stretch of it to grow an angel to full age . ”
4245	4258	4237	4237	he	19	“ I am sixteen thousand years old -- counting as you count . ”
4267	4341	4260	4260	he	19	“ No , the Fall did not affect me nor the rest of the relationship . It was only he that I was named for who ate of the fruit of the tree and then beguiled the man and the woman with it . We others are still ignorant of sin ; we are not able to commit it ; we are without blemish , and shall abide in that estate always . We-- ”
4425	4450	4420	4420	he	19	“ We can not do wrong ; neither have we any disposition to do it , for we do not know what it is . ”
5364	5367	5368	5368	he	19	“ Manners ! ”
5371	5401	5368	5368	he	19	“ Why , it is merely the truth , and truth is good manners ; manners are a fiction . The castle is done . Do you like it ? ”
5900	5905	5906	5906	Satan	19	“ Do n't cry , ”
5909	5916	5906	5906	Satan	19	“ they were of no value . ”
5917	5925	5964	5964	He	19	“ But they are gone to hell ! ”
5926	5940	5906	5906	Satan	19	“ Oh , it is no matter ; we can make plenty more . ”
6323	6367	6315	6315	he	19	“ No , all these matters are a secret among us four . I do not mind your trying to tell them , if you like , but I will protect your tongues , and nothing of the secret will escape from them . ”
6432	6518	6425	6425	he	19	“ No , it would be wonderful for you , but it is not wonderful for me . I am not limited like you . I am not subject to human conditions . I can measure and understand your human weaknesses , for I have studied them ; but I have none of them . My flesh is not real , although it would seem firm to your touch ; my clothes are not real ; I am a spirit . Father Peter is coming . ”
6530	6545	6425	6425	he	19	“ He is not in sight yet , but you will see him presently . ”
6546	6554	6656	6656	Satan	19	“ Do you know him , Satan ? ”
6555	6558	6656	6656	Satan	19	“ No . ”
6559	6593	6425	6425	he	19	“ Wo n't you talk with him when he comes ? He is not ignorant and dull , like us , and he would so like to talk with you . Will you ? ”
6594	6633	6634	6634	We	346	“ Another time , yes , but not now . I must go on my errand after a little . There he is now ; you can see him . Sit still , and do n't say anything . ”
6726	6779	6723	6723	he	20	“ I ca n't think what brought me here ; it seems as if I were in my study a minute ago -- but I suppose I have been dreaming along for an hour and have come all this stretch without noticing ; for I am not myself in these troubled days . ”
6858	6872	6855	6855	Satan	19	“ It is as I told you -- I am only a spirit . ”
6873	6881	6883	6883	Nikolaus	25	“ Yes , one perceives it now , ”
6885	6922	6855	6855	Satan	19	“ but we are not spirits . It is plain he did not see you , but were we invisible , too ? He looked at us , but he did n't seem to see us . ”
6923	6940	6855	6855	Satan	19	“ No , none of us was visible to him , for I wished it so . ”
7320	7344	7317	7317	he	25	“ The difference between man and me ? The difference between a mortal and an immortal ? between a cloud and a spirit ? ”
7361	7371	7372	7372	I	0	“ What is the difference between Caesar and this ? ”
7375	7395	7372	7372	I	0	“ One can not compare things which by their nature and by the interval between them are not comparable . ”
7396	7404	7405	7405	he	25	“ You have answered your own question , ”
7408	7504	7405	7405	he	25	“ I will expand it . Man is made of dirt -- I saw him made . I am not made of dirt . Man is a museum of diseases , a home of impurities ; he comes to - day and is gone to - morrow ; he begins as dirt and departs as stench ; I am of the aristocracy of the Imperishables . And man has the Moral Sense . You understand ? He has the moral Sense . That would seem to be difference enough between us , all by itself . ”
7731	7740	7728	7728	he	25	“ I am going on my errand now . ”
7741	7745	7746	7746	we	365	“ Do n't ! ”
7750	7765	7728	7728	he	25	“ Do n't go ; stay with us . You wo n't come back . ”
7766	7778	7728	7728	he	25	“ Yes , I will ; I give you my word . ”
7779	7789	7728	7728	he	25	“ When ? To - night ? Say when . ”
7790	7801	7728	7728	he	25	“ It wo n't be long . You will see . ”
7802	7807	7728	7728	he	25	“ We like you . ”
7808	7850	7851	7851	He	368	“ And I you . And as a proof of it I will show you something fine to see . Usually when I go I merely vanish ; but now I will dissolve myself and let you see me do it . ”
8031	8040	8022	8022	Seppi	26	“ I suppose none of it has happened . ”
8110	8120	8100	8100	he	20	“ How long have you been here , boys ? ”
8121	8128	8100	8100	he	20	“ A little while , Father . ”
8129	8153	8100	8100	he	20	“ Then it is since I came by , and maybe you can help me . Did you come up by the path ? ”
8154	8159	8100	8100	he	20	“ Yes , Father . ”
8160	8210	8100	8100	he	20	“ That is good . I came the same way . I have lost my wallet . There was n't much in it , but a very little is much to me , for it was all I had . I suppose you have n't seen anything of it ? ”
8211	8223	8100	8100	he	20	“ No , Father , but we will help you hunt . ”
8224	8241	8242	8242	We	372	“ It is what I was going to ask you . Why , here it is ! ”
8285	8290	8291	8291	he	20	“ It is mine , ”
8294	8316	8291	8291	he	20	“ but not the contents . This is fat ; mine was flat ; mine was light ; this is heavy . ”
8368	8373	8397	8397	he	19	“ Satan did it ! ”
8403	8411	8397	8397	he	19	“ Boys , did you do this ? ”
8437	8443	8428	8428	he	20	“ Who has been here ? ”
8463	8466	8488	8490	the right one	374	“ Nobody , ”
8496	8502	8485	8485	I	0	“ Not a human being . ”
8503	8508	8510	8511	the others	240	“ That is so , ”
8520	8526	8528	8529	Father Peter	20	“ It is not so , ”
8538	8613	8528	8529	Father Peter	20	“ I came by here a while ago , and there was no one here , but that is nothing ; some one has been here since . I do n't mean to say that the person did n't pass here before you came , and I do n't mean to say you saw him , but some one did pass , that I know . On your honor -- you saw no one ? ”
8614	8620	8528	8529	Father Peter	20	“ Not a human being . ”
8621	8635	8636	8636	He	376	“ That is sufficient ; I know you are telling me the truth . ”
8659	8667	8668	8668	he	376	“ It 's eleven hundred ducats odd ! ”
8671	8687	8668	8668	he	376	“ Oh dear ! if it were only mine -- and I need it so ! ”
8697	8704	8705	8705	we	378	“ It is yours , sir ! ”
8712	8716	8705	8705	we	378	“ every heller ! ”
8717	8735	8736	8736	He	376	“ No -- it is n't mine . Only four ducats are mine ; the rest ... ! ”
8779	8782	8783	8783	he	376	“ No , ”
8789	8813	8783	8783	he	376	“ it is n't mine . I ca n't account for it . I think some enemy ... it must be a trap . ”
8817	8876	8814	8814	Nikolaus	25	“ Father Peter , with the exception of the astrologer you have n't a real enemy in the village -- nor Marget , either . And not even a half - enemy that 's rich enough to chance eleven hundred ducats to do you a mean turn . I 'll ask you if that 's so or not ? ”
8891	8910	8911	8911	He	376	“ But it is n't mine , you see -- it is n't mine , in any case . ”
8937	8958	8911	8911	He	376	“ It is yours , Father Peter , and we are witness to it . Are n't we , boys ? ”
8959	8974	8911	8911	He	376	“ Yes , we are -- and we 'll stand by it , too . ”
8975	9038	8911	8911	He	376	“ Bless your hearts , you do almost persuade me ; you do , indeed . If I had only a hundred - odd ducats of it ! The house is mortgaged for it , and we 've no home for our heads if we do n't pay to - morrow . And that four ducats is all we 've got in the-- ”
9039	9078	8911	8911	He	376	“ It 's yours , every bit of it , and you 've got to take it -- we are bail that it 's all right . Are n't we , Theodor ? Are n't we , Seppi ? ”
9336	9341	9321	9321	Some	76	“ tell the truth ; ”
9773	9782	9783	9783	He	20	“ What is the Moral Sense , sir ? ”
9797	9813	9783	9783	He	20	“ Why , it is the faculty which enables us to distinguish good from evil . ”
9859	9864	9856	9856	I	0	“ Is it valuable ? ”
9865	9892	9856	9856	I	0	“ Valuable ? Heavens ! lad , it is the one thing that lifts man above the beasts that perish and makes him heir to immortality ! ”
10313	10321	10310	10310	he	23	“ How many ducats did you say ? ”
10322	10330	10332	10332	he	23	“ Eleven hundred and seven , sir . ”
10343	10360	10332	10332	he	23	“ It is ver - y singular . Yes ... very strange . A curious coincidence . ”
10387	10400	10384	10384	he	23	“ Eleven hundred and six ducats . It is a large sum . ”
10401	10404	10406	10406	Seppi	26	“ Seven , ”
10411	10440	10406	10406	Seppi	26	“ Oh , seven , was it ? Of course a ducat more or less is n't of consequence , but you said eleven hundred and six before . ”
10464	10479	10461	10461	Nikolaus	25	“ We ask pardon for the mistake , but we meant to say seven . ”
10480	10534	10451	10451	he	23	“ Oh , it is no matter , lad ; it was merely that I noticed the discrepancy . It is several days , and you can not be expected to remember precisely . One is apt to be inexact when there is no particular circumstance to impress the count upon the memory . ”
10535	10543	10545	10545	Seppi	26	“ But there was one , sir , ”
10549	10557	10559	10560	the astrologer	142	“ What was it , my son ? ”
10564	10658	10559	10560	the astrologer	142	“ First , we all counted the piles of coin , each in turn , and all made it the same -- eleven hundred and six . But I had slipped one out , for fun , when the count began , and now I slipped it back and said , ' I think there is a mistake -- there are eleven hundred and seven ; let us count again . ' We did , and of course I was right . They were astonished ; then I told how it came about . ”
10674	10679	10680	10680	he	142	“ That settles it , ”
10683	10697	10680	10680	he	142	“ I know the thief now . Lads , the money was stolen . ”
11473	11476	11471	11471	he	142	“ found . ”
12011	12041	12008	12008	Satan	19	“ I understand you are very poor . Why do you want to add another mouth to feed ? Why do n't you give it to some rich person ? ”
12049	12071	12042	12042	Ursula	38	“ Perhaps you would like to have it . You must be rich , with your fine clothes and quality airs . ”
12078	12126	12073	12073	she	38	“ Give it to the rich -- the idea ! The rich do n't care for anybody but themselves ; it 's only the poor that have feeling for the poor , and help them . The poor and God . God will provide for this kitten . ”
12127	12134	12135	12135	Ursula	38	“ What makes you think so ? ”
12142	12148	12149	12149	she	38	“ Because I know it ! ”
12152	12165	12149	12149	she	38	“ Not a sparrow falls to the ground without His seeing it . ”
12166	12182	12183	12184	Old Ursula	38	“ But it falls , just the same . What good is seeing it fall ? ”
12216	12234	12212	12212	she	38	“ Go about your business , you puppy , or I will take a stick to you ! ”
12271	12274	12249	12249	his	490	“ plenty more ”
12426	12433	12434	12434	she	38	“ What 's come over it ? ”
12437	12445	12434	12434	she	38	“ Awhile ago it could hardly walk . ”
12446	12458	12460	12460	Satan	19	“ You have not seen a kitten of that breed before , ”
12484	12518	12475	12475	she	38	“ Who asked you to come here and pester me , I 'd like to know ? And what do you know about what I 've seen and what I have n't seen ? ”
12519	12542	12589	12589	Satan	19	“ You have n't seen a kitten with the hair - spines on its tongue pointing to the front , have you ? ”
12543	12551	12589	12589	Satan	19	“ No -- nor you , either . ”
12552	12561	12562	12562	Ursula	38	“ Well , examine this one and see . ”
12592	12604	12589	12589	Satan	19	“ Give it a name , and maybe it will come . ”
12617	12625	12611	12612	the kitten	497	“ Call it Agnes . Try that . ”
12640	12649	12650	12650	she	38	“ Upon my word , it 's true ! ”
12653	12669	12635	12635	Ursula	38	“ I have not seen this kind of a cat before . Is it yours ? ”
12670	12673	12726	12726	her	38	“ No . ”
12674	12685	12635	12635	Ursula	38	“ Then how did you know its name so pat ? ”
12686	12705	12706	12706	Ursula	38	“ Because all cats of that breed are named Agnes ; they will not answer to any other . ”
12710	12718	12706	12706	Ursula	38	“ It is the most wonderful thing ! ”
12745	12797	12736	12736	she	38	“ I suppose I must let it go ; I am not afraid -- no , not exactly that , though the priest -- well , I 've heard people -- indeed , many people ... And , besides , it is quite well now and can take care of itself . ”
12808	12854	12798	12798	She	38	“ It is such a pretty one , too , and would be such company -- and the house is so sad and lonesome these troubled days ... Miss Marget so mournful and just a shadow , and the old master shut up in jail . ”
12855	12865	12867	12867	Satan	19	“ It seems a pity not to keep it , ”
12885	12888	12889	12889	she	38	“ Why ? ”
12894	12901	12889	12889	she	38	“ Because this breed brings luck . ”
12902	12927	12876	12876	she	38	“ Does it ? Is it true ? Young man , do you know it to be true ? How does it bring luck ? ”
12928	12937	12938	12938	Ursula	38	“ Well , it brings money , anyway . ”
12942	12975	12976	12976	She	38	“ Money ? A cat bring money ? The idea ! You could never sell it here ; people do not buy cats here ; one ca n't even give them away . ”
12981	13017	12976	12976	She	38	“ I do n't mean sell it . I mean have an income from it . This kind is called the Lucky Cat . Its owner finds four silver groschen in his pocket every morning . ”
13168	13191	13163	13163	she	492	“ It 's true -- it 's true -- and I 'm ashamed and beg forgiveness , O dear master and benefactor ! ”
13707	13712	13714	13714	Marget	22	“ Maybe they will , ”

13724	13738	13694	13694	he	33	“ Oh yes , he goes all about ; he has business everywhere . ”
13860	13877	13878	13878	he	33	“ but just show this paper and pass in , and show it again when you come out”--and
13997	14004	13987	13987	her	38	“ Supper 's ready , miss . ”
14230	14243	14212	14212	she	38	afterward--“Send him away , Miss Marget ; there 's not victuals enough . ”
14282	14294	14279	14279	He	19	“ Did n't I see you down the road awhile ago ? ”
14295	14300	14249	14249	Satan	19	“ Yes , sir . ”
14301	14314	14315	14315	He	19	“ Ah , that pleases me ; I see you remember me . ”
14322	14341	14315	14315	He	19	“ I told you it is a Lucky Cat . Do n't be troubled ; it will provide . ”
14805	14817	14819	14819	Marget	22	“ But your uncle is a gentleman , is n't he ? ”
14821	14824	14826	14826	Satan	19	“ Yes , ”
14829	14857	14826	14826	Satan	19	“ some even call him a Prince , out of compliment , but he is not bigoted ; to him personal merit is everything , rank nothing . ”
14887	14916	14882	14882	I	0	“ It is all a mistake ; this is just a common , ordinary cat ; the hair - needles on her tongue point inward , not outward . ”
15189	15218	15181	15181	I	0	“ No , it was a human thing . You should not insult the brutes by such a misuse of that word ; they have not deserved it , ”
15227	15444	15220	15220	he	19	“ It is like your paltry race -- always lying , always claiming virtues which it has n't got , always denying them to the higher animals , which alone possess them . No brute ever does a cruel thing -- that is the monopoly of those with the Moral Sense . When a brute inflicts pain he does it innocently ; it is not wrong ; for him there is no such thing as wrong . And he does not inflict pain for the pleasure of inflicting it -- only man does that . Inspired by that mongrel Moral Sense of his ! A sense whose function is to distinguish between right and wrong , with liberty to choose which of them he will do . Now what advantage can he get out of that ? He is always choosing , and in nine cases out of ten he prefers the wrong . There should n't be any wrong ; and without the Moral Sense there could n't be any . And yet he is such an unreasoning creature that he is not able to perceive that the Moral Sense degrades him to the bottom layer of animated beings and is a shameful possession . Are you feeling better ? Let me show you something . ”
15515	15854	15856	15856	he	573	“ It is some more Moral Sense . The proprietors are rich , and very holy ; but the wage they pay to these poor brothers and sisters of theirs is only enough to keep them from dropping dead with hunger . The work - hours are fourteen per day , winter and summer -- from six in the morning till eight at night -- little children and all . And they walk to and from the pigsties which they inhabit -- four miles each way , through mud and slush , rain , snow , sleet , and storm , daily , year in and year out . They get four hours of sleep . They kennel together , three families in a room , in unimaginable filth and stench ; and disease comes , and they die off like flies . Have they committed a crime , these mangy things ? No . What have they done , that they are punished so ? Nothing at all , except getting themselves born into your foolish race . You have seen how they treat a misdoer there in the jail ; now you see how they treat the innocent and the worthy . Is your race logical ? Are these ill - smelling innocents better off than that heretic ? Indeed , no ; his punishment is trivial compared with theirs . They broke him on the wheel and smashed him to rags and pulp after we left , and he is dead now , and free of your precious race ; but these poor slaves here -- why , they have been dying for years , and some of them will not escape from life for years to come . It is the Moral Sense which teaches the factory proprietors the difference between right and wrong -- you perceive the result . They think themselves better than dogs . Ah , you are such an illogical , unreasoning race ! And paltry -- oh , unspeakably ! ”
15924	15964	15917	15917	he	573	“ But , after all , it is not all ridiculous ; there is a sort of pathos about it when one remembers how few are your days , how childish your pomps , and what shadows you are ! ”
16017	16023	16026	16027	Seppi Wohlmeyer	26	“ He 's come again ! ”
16186	16198	16199	16199	he	26	“ Not since he did that brutal thing , you know , ”
16202	16207	16199	16199	he	26	“ What brutal thing ? ”
16214	16341	16210	16210	Satan	19	“ Well , he is always clubbing his dog , which is a good dog , and his only friend , and is faithful , and loves him , and does no one any harm ; and two days ago he was at it again , just for nothing -- just for pleasure -- and the dog was howling and begging , and Theodor and I begged , too , but he threatened us , and struck the dog again with all his might and knocked one of his eyes out , and he said to us , ' There , I hope you are satisfied now ; that 's what you have got for him by your damned meddling'--and he laughed , the heartless brute . ”
16363	16386	16359	16359	he	19	“ There is that misused word again -- that shabby slander . Brutes do not act like that , but only men . ”
16387	16396	16354	16354	Satan	19	“ Well , it was inhuman , anyway . ”
16397	16476	16477	16477	He	19	“ No , it was n't , Seppi ; it was human -- quite distinctly human . It is not pleasant to hear you libel the higher animals by attributing to them dispositions which they are free from , and which are found nowhere but in the human heart . None of the higher animals is tainted with the disease called the Moral Sense . Purify your language , Seppi ; drop those lying phrases out of it . ”
16681	16689	16678	16678	Satan	19	“ He says his master was drunk . ”
16690	16696	16698	16698	we	590	“ Yes , he was , ”
16700	16716	16678	16678	Satan	19	“ And an hour later he fell over the precipice there beyond the Cliff Pasture . ”
16717	16730	16656	16656	he	19	“ We know the place ; it is three miles from here . ”
16731	16759	16678	16678	Satan	19	“ And the dog has been often to the village , begging people to go there , but he was only driven away and not listened to . ”
16772	16851	16852	16852	He	19	“ He only wanted help for the man who had misused him , and he thought only of that , and has had no food nor sought any . He has watched by his master two nights . What do you think of your race ? Is heaven reserved for it , and this dog ruled out , as your teachers tell you ? Can your race add anything to this dog 's stock of morals and magnanimities ? ”
16877	16909	16852	16852	He	19	“ Get some men ; go with the dog -- he will show you that carrion ; and take a priest along to arrange about insurance , for death is near . ”
18122	18130	18119	18119	They	648	“ Did you do so and so ? ”
18256	18267	18237	18238	her mother	656	“ Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! ”
18524	18531	18511	18511	He	233	“ Then why did you confess ? ”
18532	18540	18541	18541	she	657	“ I am old and very poor , ”
18544	18645	18541	18541	she	657	“ and I work for my living . There was no way but to confess . If I had n't they might have set me free . That would ruin me , for no one would forget that I had been suspected of being a witch , and so I would get no more work , and wherever I went they would set the dogs on me . In a little while I would starve . The fire is best ; it is soon over . You have been good to me , you two , and I thank you . ”
18836	18932	18817	18817	he	19	“ There -- he would n't drive children mad with hunger and fright and loneliness , and then burn them for confessing to things invented for them which had never happened . And neither would he break the hearts of innocent , poor old women and make them afraid to trust themselves among their own race ; and he would not insult them in their death - agony . For he is not besmirched with the Moral Sense , but is as the angels are , and knows no wrong , and never does it . ”
19108	19111	19112	19112	he	42	“ Money ! ”
19115	19159	19112	19112	he	42	“ they 've got plenty of it . They pay me two groschen a week , besides my keep . And they live on the fat of the land , I can tell you ; the prince himself ca n't beat their table . ”
19190	19197	19182	19182	He	18	“ This must be looked into . ”
20712	20719	20720	20720	he	18	“ Bring me what you will , ”

22821	22830	22742	22742	Wohlmeyer	26	“ That can come -- to finish us ! ”

23092	23149	23089	23089	She	22	“ I have been begging him to go , and come no more , and so save himself alive . I can not bear to be his murderer . This house is bewitched , and no inmate will escape the fire . But he will not go , and he will be lost with the rest . ”
23442	23452	23434	23434	Satan	19	“ Come with me . Where shall we go ? ”
23453	23462	23434	23434	Satan	19	“ Anywhere -- so it is with you . ”
23476	23481	23473	23473	he	19	“ This is China . ”
23843	23881	23833	23833	he	19	“ What ? I do random things ? Indeed , I never do . I stop and consider possible consequences ? Where is the need ? I know what the consequences are going to be -- always . ”
23882	23895	23833	23833	he	19	“ Oh , Satan , then how could you do these things ? ”
23896	24151	24152	24152	I	0	“ Well , I will tell you , and you must understand if you can . You belong to a singular race . Every man is a suffering - machine and a happiness - machine combined . The two functions work together harmoniously , with a fine and delicate precision , on the give - and - take principle . For every happiness turned out in the one department the other stands ready to modify it with a sorrow or a pain -- maybe a dozen . In most cases the man 's life is about equally divided between happiness and unhappiness . When this is not the case the unhappiness predominates -- always ; never the other . Sometimes a man 's make and disposition are such that his misery - machine is able to do nearly all the business . Such a man goes through life almost ignorant of what happiness is . Everything he touches , everything he does , brings a misfortune upon him . You have seen such people ? To that kind of a person life is not an advantage , is it ? It is only a disaster . Sometimes for an hour 's happiness a man 's machinery makes him pay years of misery . Do n't you know that ? It happens every now and then . I will give you a case or two presently . Now the people of your village are nothing to me -- you know that , do n't you ? ”
24170	24208	24163	24163	I	0	“ Well , it is true that they are nothing to me . It is not possible that they should be . The difference between them and me is abysmal , immeasurable . They have no intellect . ”
24209	24213	23833	23833	he	19	“ No intellect ? ”
24214	24555	24163	24163	I	0	“ Nothing that resembles it . At a future time I will examine what man calls his mind and give you the details of that chaos , then you will see and understand . Men have nothing in common with me -- there is no point of contact ; they have foolish little feelings and foolish little vanities and impertinences and ambitions ; their foolish little life is but a laugh , a sigh , and extinction ; and they have no sense . Only the Moral Sense . I will show you what I mean . Here is a red spider , not so big as a pin 's head . Can you imagine an elephant being interested in him -- caring whether he is happy or is n't , or whether he is wealthy or poor , or whether his sweetheart returns his love or not , or whether his mother is sick or well , or whether he is looked up to in society or not , or whether his enemies will smite him or his friends desert him , or whether his hopes will suffer blight or his political ambitions fail , or whether he shall die in the bosom of his family or neglected and despised in a foreign land ? These things can never be important to the elephant ; they are nothing to him ; he can not shrink his sympathies to the microscopic size of them . Man is to me as the red spider is to the elephant . The elephant has nothing against the spider -- he can not get down to that remote level ; I have nothing against man . The elephant is indifferent ; I am indifferent . The elephant would not take the trouble to do the spider an ill turn ; if he took the notion he might do him a good turn , if it came in his way and cost nothing . I have done men good service , but no ill turns . “
24615	24733	24734	24734	I	0	“ Man 's mind clumsily and tediously and laboriously patches little trivialities together and gets a result -- such as it is . My mind creates ! Do you get the force of that ? Creates anything it desires -- and in a moment . Creates without material . Creates fluids , solids , colors -- anything , everything -- out of the airy nothing which is called Thought . A man imagines a silk thread , imagines a machine to make it , imagines a picture , then by weeks of labor embroiders it on canvas with the thread . I think the whole thing , and in a moment it is before you -- created . “
24899	25062	25063	25063	He	847	“ Now , then , I perceive by your thoughts that you are understanding me fairly well . Let us proceed . Circumstances might so fall out that the elephant could like the spider -- supposing he can see it -- but he could not love it . His love is for his own kind -- for his equals . An angel 's love is sublime , adorable , divine , beyond the imagination of man -- infinitely beyond it ! But it is limited to his own august order . If it fell upon one of your race for only an instant , it would consume its object to ashes . No , we can not love men , but we can be harmlessly indifferent to them ; we can also like them , sometimes . I like you and the boys , I like father Peter , and for your sakes I am doing all these things for the villagers . ”
25078	25349	25073	25073	he	847	“ I have wrought well for the villagers , though it does not look like it on the surface . Your race never know good fortune from ill . They are always mistaking the one for the other . It is because they can not see into the future . What I am doing for the villagers will bear good fruit some day ; in some cases to themselves ; in others , to unborn generations of men . No one will ever know that I was the cause , but it will be none the less true , for all that . Among you boys you have a game : you stand a row of bricks on end a few inches apart ; you push a brick , it knocks its neighbor over , the neighbor knocks over the next brick -- and so on till all the row is prostrate . That is human life . A child 's first act knocks over the initial brick , and the rest will follow inexorably . If you could see into the future , as I can , you would see everything that was going to happen to that creature ; for nothing can change the order of its life after the first event has determined it . That is , nothing will change it , because each act unfailingly begets an act , that act begets another , and so on to the end , and the seer can look forward down the line and see just when each act is to have birth , from cradle to grave . ”
25350	25357	25063	25063	He	847	“ Does God order the career ? ”
25358	25686	25063	25063	He	847	“ Foreordain it ? No . The man 's circumstances and environment order it . His first act determines the second and all that follow after . But suppose , for argument 's sake , that the man should skip one of these acts ; an apparently trifling one , for instance ; suppose that it had been appointed that on a certain day , at a certain hour and minute and second and fraction of a second he should go to the well , and he did n't go . That man 's career would change utterly , from that moment ; thence to the grave it would be wholly different from the career which his first act as a child had arranged for him . Indeed , it might be that if he had gone to the well he would have ended his career on a throne , and that omitting to do it would set him upon a career that would lead to beggary and a pauper 's grave . For instance : if at any time -- say in boyhood -- Columbus had skipped the triflingest little link in the chain of acts projected and made inevitable by his first childish act , it would have changed his whole subsequent life , and he would have become a priest and died obscure in an Italian village , and America would not have been discovered for two centuries afterward . I know this . To skip any one of the billion acts in Columbus 's chain would have wholly changed his life . I have examined his billion of possible careers , and in only one of them occurs the discovery of America . You people do not suspect that all of your acts are of one size and importance , but it is true ; to snatch at an appointed fly is as big with fate for you as is any other appointed act-- ”
25687	25698	25073	25073	he	847	“ As the conquering of a continent , for instance ? ”
25699	25842	25063	25063	He	847	“ Yes . Now , then , no man ever does drop a link -- the thing has never happened ! Even when he is trying to make up his mind as to whether he will do a thing or not , that itself is a link , an act , and has its proper place in his chain ; and when he finally decides an act , that also was the thing which he was absolutely certain to do . You see , now , that a man will never drop a link in his chain . He can not . If he made up his mind to try , that project would itself be an unavoidable link -- a thought bound to occur to him at that precise moment , and made certain by the first act of his babyhood . ”
25848	25856	25857	25857	I	0	“ He is a prisoner for life , ”
25861	25868	25857	25857	I	0	“ and can not get free . ”
25869	25894	25895	25895	I	0	“ No , of himself he can not get away from the consequences of his first childish act . But I can free him . ”
25900	25913	25895	25895	I	0	“ I have changed the careers of a number of your villagers . ”
25930	25945	25914	25914	I	0	“ I shall make some other changes . You know that little Lisa Brandt ? ”
25946	25999	25857	25857	I	0	“ Oh yes , everybody does . My mother says she is so sweet and so lovely that she is not like any other child . She says she will be the pride of the village when she grows up ; and its idol , too , just as she is now . ”
26000	26007	25918	25918	him	848	“ I shall change her future . ”
26008	26013	26014	26014	I	0	“ Make it better ? ”
26017	26029	26030	26030	I	0	“ Yes . And I will change the future of Nikolaus . ”
26040	26061	26030	26030	I	0	“ I do n't need to ask about his case ; you will be sure to do generously by him . ”
26062	26068	26030	26030	I	0	“ It is my intention . ”
26145	26156	26139	26139	He	19	“ Nicky 's appointed life is sixty - two years . ”
26157	26162	26163	26163	I	0	“ That 's grand ! ”
26166	26289	26163	26163	I	0	“ Lisa 's , thirty - six . But , as I told you , I shall change their lives and those ages . Two minutes and a quarter from now Nikolaus will wake out of his sleep and find the rain blowing in . It was appointed that he should turn over and go to sleep again . But I have appointed that he shall get up and close the window first . That trifle will change his career entirely . He will rise in the morning two minutes later than the chain of his life had appointed him to rise . By consequence , thenceforth nothing will ever happen to him in accordance with the details of the old chain . ”
26307	26332	26290	26290	He	19	“ Nikolaus has risen to close the window . His life is changed , his new career has begun . There will be consequences . ”
26343	26436	26290	26290	He	19	“ But for this change certain things would happen twelve days from now . For instance , Nikolaus would save Lisa from drowning . He would arrive on the scene at exactly the right moment -- four minutes past ten , the long - ago appointed instant of time -- and the water would be shoal , the achievement easy and certain . But he will arrive some seconds too late , now ; Lisa will have struggled into deeper water . He will do his best , but both will drown . ”
26437	26447	26448	26448	I	0	“ Oh , Satan ! Oh , dear Satan ! ”
26459	26493	26448	26448	I	0	“ save them ! Do n't let it happen . I ca n't bear to lose Nikolaus , he is my loving playmate and friend ; and think of Lisa 's poor mother ! ”
26525	26620	26509	26509	He	851	“ I have changed Nikolaus 's life , and this has changed Lisa 's . If I had not done this , Nikolaus would save Lisa , then he would catch cold from his drenching ; one of your race 's fantastic and desolating scarlet fevers would follow , with pathetic after - effects ; for forty - six years he would lie in his bed a paralytic log , deaf , dumb , blind , and praying night and day for the blessed relief of death . Shall I change his life back ? ”
26621	26642	26509	26509	He	851	“ Oh no ! Oh , not for the world ! In charity and pity leave it as it is . ”
26643	26779	26780	26780	I	0	“ It is best so . I could not have changed any other link in his life and done him so good a service . He had a billion possible careers , but not one of them was worth living ; they were charged full with miseries and disasters . But for my intervention he would do his brave deed twelve days from now -- a deed begun and ended in six minutes -- and get for all reward those forty - six years of sorrow and suffering I told you of . It is one of the cases I was thinking of awhile ago when I said that sometimes an act which brings the actor an hour 's happiness and self - satisfaction is paid for -- or punished -- by years of suffering . ”
26799	26861	26794	26794	He	852	“ From ten years of pain and slow recovery from an accident , and then from nineteen years ' pollution , shame , depravity , crime , ending with death at the hands of the executioner . Twelve days hence she will die ; her mother would save her life if she could . Am I not kinder than her mother ? ”
26862	26873	26780	26780	I	0	“ Yes -- oh , indeed yes ; and wiser . ”
26874	26896	26780	26780	I	0	“ Father Peter 's case is coming on presently . He will be acquitted , through unassailable proofs of his innocence . ”
26897	26913	26794	26794	He	852	“ Why , Satan , how can that be ? Do you really think it ? ”
26914	26938	26780	26780	I	0	“ Indeed , I know it . His good name will be restored , and the rest of his life will be happy . ”
26939	26955	26780	26780	I	0	“ I can believe it . To restore his good name will have that effect . ”
26956	26989	26780	26780	I	0	“ His happiness will not proceed from that cause . I shall change his life that day , for his good . He will never know his good name has been restored . ”

27048	27155	27035	27035	Satan	19	“ I 've got him on the cold side of it , too . He does n't know where he is , and is not having a pleasant time ; still , it is good enough for him , a good place for his star studies . I shall need him presently ; then I shall bring him back and possess him again . He has a long and cruel and odious life before him , but I will change that , for I have no feeling against him and am quite willing to do him a kindness . I think I shall get him burned . ”
27235	27239	27241	27241	Satan	19	“ Far away ? ”
27243	27327	27241	27241	Satan	19	“ To me no place is far away ; distance does not exist for me . The sun is less than a hundred million miles from here , and the light that is falling upon us has taken eight minutes to come ; but I can make that flight , or any other , in a fraction of time so minute that it can not be measured by a watch . I have but to think the journey , and it is accomplished . ”
27336	27353	27328	27328	I	0	“ The light lies upon it ; think it into a glass of wine , Satan . ”
27363	27368	27369	27369	he	19	“ Break the glass , ”
27376	27431	27372	27372	I	0	“ There -- you see it is real . The villagers thought the brass balls were magic stuff and as perishable as smoke . They were afraid to touch them . You are a curious lot -- your race . But come along ; I have business . I will put you to bed . ”
27455	27465	27442	27442	his	19	“ Yes , tell Seppi , but no other . ”

28643	28659	28638	28638	He	26	“ Hi - hi ! What is the matter ? Have you seen a ghost ? ”
28882	28892	28868	28868	we	886	“ Wait , let me do that for you , ”
29026	29047	29023	29023	Seppi	26	“ We always prized him , but never so much as now , when we are going to lose him . ”
29120	29126	29101	29103	two of us	894	“ Only ten days left ; ”
29127	29133	29150	29150	Nikolaus	25	“ only nine days left ; ”
29134	29138	29150	29150	Nikolaus	25	“ only eight ; ”
29139	29143	29101	29103	two of us	894	“ only seven . ”
29398	29401	29408	29408	He	25	“ Why ? ”
29662	29673	29658	29658	our	886	“ If he only knew -- if he only knew ! ”
29704	29802	29700	29701	His mother	1504	“ His father is out of all patience with these goings - on , and will not have any more of it . Half the time when Nick is needed he is not to be found ; then it turns out that he has been gadding around with you two . His father gave him a flogging last night . It always grieved me before , and many 's the time I have begged him off and saved him , but this time he appealed to me in vain , for I was out of patience myself . ”
29803	29815	29816	29816	I	0	“ I wish you had saved him just this one time , ”
29825	29840	29816	29816	I	0	“ it would ease a pain in your heart to remember it some day . ”
29871	29879	29856	29856	She	909	“ What do you mean by that ? ”
29913	29991	29906	29906	Seppi	26	“ Why , of course it would be pleasant to remember , for the very reason we were out so late was that Nikolaus got to telling how good you are to him , and how he never got whipped when you were by to save him ; and he was so full of it , and we were so full of the interest of it , that none of us noticed how late it was getting . ”
29992	30001	30003	30003	she	909	“ Did he say that ? Did he ? ”
30011	30024	30003	30003	she	909	“ You can ask Theodor -- he will tell you the same . ”
30025	30037	30038	30038	she	909	“ It is a dear , good lad , my Nick , ”
30041	30129	30038	30038	she	909	“ I am sorry I let him get whipped ; I will never do it again . To think -- all the time I was sitting here last night , fretting and angry at him , he was loving me and praising me ! Dear , dear , if we could only know ! Then we should n't ever go wrong ; but we are only poor , dumb beasts groping around and making mistakes . I sha n't ever think of last night without a pang . ”
30162	30166	30160	30160	They	912	“ groping around , ”
30193	30198	30199	30199	she	909	“ I am sorry , ”
30202	30229	30199	30199	she	909	“ but he ca n't . To punish him further , his father does n't allow him to go out of the house to - day . ”

30270	30283	30263	30263	Seppi	26	“ Must he stay in all day , or only the morning ? ”
30284	30337	30338	30338	Seppi	26	“ All day . It 's such a pity , too ; it 's a beautiful day , and he is so unused to being shut up . But he is busy planning his party , and maybe that is company for him . I do hope he is n't too lonesome . ”
30361	30365	30366	30366	she	913	“ And welcome ! ”
30372	30436	30366	30366	she	913	“ Now I call that real friendship , when you might be abroad in the fields and the woods , having a happy time . You are good boys , I 'll allow that , though you do n't always find satisfactory ways of improving it . Take these cakes -- for yourselves -- and give him this one , from his mother . ”
30505	30509	30510	30510	he	25	“ Sit down , ”
30513	30550	30510	30510	he	25	“ and look at what I 've been doing . And I 've finished a kite that you will say is a beauty . It 's drying , in the kitchen ; I 'll fetch it . ”
30589	30615	30586	30586	He	25	“ Examine them at your leisure while I get mother to touch up the kite with her iron if it is n't dry enough yet . ”
30697	30728	30689	30689	Seppi	26	“ Two minutes to ten . Seven minutes more and he will pass the death - point . Theodor , he is going to be saved ! He 's going to-- ”
30729	30744	30689	30689	Seppi	26	“ Hush ! I 'm on needles . Watch the clock and keep still . ”
30772	30775	30785	30787	The old mother	916	“ Saved ! ”
30794	30801	30802	30802	she	916	“ Is n't it a beauty ? ”
30805	30834	30835	30835	She	916	“ And , dear me , how he has slaved over it -- ever since daylight , I think , and only finished it awhile before you came . ”
30852	30919	30835	30835	She	916	“ He drew the pictures his own self , and I think they are very good . The church is n't so very good , I 'll have to admit , but look at the bridge -- any one can recognize the bridge in a minute . He asked me to bring it up .... Dear me ! it 's seven minutes past ten , and I-- ”
30920	30926	31046	31046	her	918	“ But where is he ? ”
30927	30945	31046	31046	her	918	“ He ? Oh , he 'll be here soon ; he 's gone out a minute . ”
30946	30950	30835	30835	She	916	“ Gone out ? ”
30951	31041	31042	31042	She	918	“ Yes . Just as he came down - stairs little Lisa 's mother came in and said the child had wandered off somewhere , and as she was a little uneasy I told Nikolaus to never mind about his father 's orders -- go and look her up .... Why , how white you two do look ! I do believe you are sick . Sit down ; I 'll fetch something . That cake has disagreed with you . It is a little heavy , but I thought-- ”
31088	31114	31078	31078	people	119	“ Oh , it is all over -- poor Nikolaus ! Why , oh , why did she let him get out of the house ! ”
31115	31119	31121	31121	Seppi	26	“ Come away , ”
31126	31145	31121	31121	Seppi	26	“ come quick -- we ca n't bear to meet her ; in five minutes she will know . ”
31255	31261	31235	31236	a crowd	925	“ Oh , my God ! ”
31292	31355	31276	31276	her	927	“ Oh , it was I that sent him , and I have been his death . If I had obeyed , and kept him in the house , this would not have happened . And I am rightly punished ; I was cruel to him last night , and him begging me , his own mother , to be his friend . ”
31565	31628	31562	31562	she	51	“ For nearly two weeks I have had dreams and presentiments and warnings that death was going to strike what was most precious to me , and day and night and night and day I have groveled in the dirt before Him praying Him to have pity on my innocent child and save it from harm -- and here is His answer ! ”
31682	31698	31674	31674	she	51	“ But in His hard heart is no compassion . I will never pray again . ”
32322	32326	32318	32318	we	972	“ Do it ! ”
32327	32332	32333	32333	he	19	“ It is done , ”
32336	32356	32333	32333	he	19	“ she was going around a corner ; I have turned her back ; it has changed her career . ”
32357	32365	32303	32303	he	19	“ Then what will happen , Satan ? ”
32366	32416	32318	32318	we	972	“ It is happening now . She is having words with Fischer , the weaver . In his anger Fischer will straightway do what he would not have done but for this accident . He was present when she stood over her child 's body and uttered those blasphemies . ”
32417	32423	32333	32333	he	19	“ What will he do ? ”
32424	32444	32445	32445	We	975	“ He is doing it now -- betraying her . In three days she will go to the stake . ”
32482	32545	32474	32474	Satan	19	“ What you are thinking is strictly human - like -- that is to say , foolish . The woman is advantaged . Die when she might , she would go to heaven . By this prompt death she gets twenty - nine years more of heaven than she is entitled to , and escapes twenty - nine years of misery here . ”
32636	32649	32623	32623	I	0	“ Does this episode change Fischer 's life - scheme , Satan ? ”
32650	32707	32708	32708	We	975	“ Change it ? Why , certainly . And radically . If he had not met Frau Brandt awhile ago he would die next year , thirty - four years of age . Now he will live to be ninety , and have a pretty prosperous and comfortable life of it , as human lives go . ”
32792	32819	32778	32778	Satan	19	“ Well , the fact is , it is a delicate point . Under his several former possible life - careers he was going to heaven . ”
32824	32833	32778	32778	Satan	19	“ Oh , Satan ! and under this one-- ”
32834	32858	32778	32778	Satan	19	“ There , do n't be so distressed . You were sincerely trying to do him a kindness ; let that comfort you . ”
32859	32891	32778	32778	Satan	19	“ Oh , dear , dear , that can not comfort us . You ought to have told us what we were doing , then we would n't have acted so . ”
33023	33027	33000	33000	He	19	“ plenty there . ”
33206	33211	33195	33196	A mob	986	“ Blasphemer and heretic ! ”
33250	33258	33266	33266	he	27	“ Oh , stop them , Satan ! ”
33351	33382	33338	33338	We	990	“ Yes , entirely . Some have gained years , some have lost them . Some few will profit in various ways by the change , but only that few . ”
33588	33631	33584	33584	She	51	“ No . If I had that power would any of you holy hypocrites be alive five minutes ? No ; I would strike you all dead . Pronounce your sentence and let me go ; I am tired of your society . ”
33733	33761	33717	33717	she	51	“ We played together once , in long - agone days when we were innocent little creatures . For the sake of that , I forgive you . ”

33898	33922	33895	33895	he	19	“ would you like to see a history of the progress of the human race?--its development of that product which it calls civilization ? ”
34129	34147	34126	34126	Satan	19	“ The progress of your race was not satisfactory . It is to have another chance now . ”

34468	34501	34465	34465	Satan	19	“ sometimes to crush a weak nation ; but never a war started by the aggressor for any clean purpose -- there is no such war in the history of the race . ”

34509	34540	34541	34541	He	19	“ you have seen your progress down to the present , and you must confess that it is wonderful -- in its way . We must now exhibit the future . ”
34567	34571	34572	34572	he	19	“ You perceive , ”
34575	34669	34572	34572	he	19	“ that you have made continual progress . Cain did his murder with a club ; the Hebrews did their murders with javelins and swords ; the Greeks and Romans added protective armor and the fine arts of military organization and generalship ; the Christian has added guns and gunpowder ; a few centuries from now he will have so greatly improved the deadly effectiveness of his weapons of slaughter that all men will confess that without Christian civilization war must have remained a poor and trifling thing to the end of time . ”
34856	35004	34853	34853	he	19	“ It is a remarkable progress . In five or six thousand years five or six high civilizations have risen , flourished , commanded the wonder of the world , then faded out and disappeared ; and not one of them except the latest ever invented any sweeping and adequate way to kill people . They all did their best -- to kill being the chiefest ambition of the human race and the earliest incident in its history -- but only the Christian civilization has scored a triumph to be proud of . Two or three centuries from now it will be recognized that all the competent killers are Christians ; then the pagan world will go to school to the Christian -- not to acquire his religion , but his guns . The Turk and the Chinaman will buy those to kill missionaries and converts with . ”
35084	35092	35094	35094	Satan	19	“ And what does it amount to ? ”
35101	35337	35094	35094	Satan	19	“ Nothing at all . You gain nothing ; you always come out where you went in . For a million years the race has gone on monotonously propagating itself and monotonously reperforming this dull nonsense -- to what end ? No wisdom can guess ! Who gets a profit out of it ? Nobody but a parcel of usurping little monarchs and nobilities who despise you ; would feel defiled if you touched them ; would shut the door in your face if you proposed to call ; whom you slave for , fight for , die for , and are not ashamed of it , but proud ; whose existence is a perpetual insult to you and you are afraid to resent it ; who are mendicants supported by your alms , yet assume toward you the airs of benefactor toward beggar ; who address you in the language of master to slave , and are answered in the language of slave to master ; who are worshiped by you with your mouth , while in your heart -- if you have one -- you despise yourselves for it . The first man was a hypocrite and a coward , qualities which have not yet failed in his line ; it is the foundation upon which all civilizations have been built . Drink to their perpetuation ! Drink to their augmentation ! Drink to-- ”
35370	35431	35365	35365	He	1031	“ No , we will drink one another 's health , and let civilization go . The wine which has flown to our hands out of space by desire is earthly , and good enough for that other toast ; but throw away the glasses ; we will drink this one in wine which has not visited this world before . ”
35587	35597	35583	35583	he	26	“ We shall be there some day , and then-- ”
35613	35623	35609	35609	Satan	19	“ Yes , you will be there some day , ”
36145	36167	36134	36134	his	1058	“ What are you laughing at ? Answer ! Moreover , please explain to the company why you threw no stone . ”

36180	36200	36134	36134	his	1058	“ Yes . You need n't try to get out of it ; I had my eye on you . ”

36300	36305	36307	36308	the crowd	673	“ That 's so ! ”
36324	36334	36336	36337	the blacksmith	1683	“ And first you will answer that other question , ”
36354	36361	36362	36362	Satan	19	“ What are you laughing at ? ”
36369	36386	36362	36362	Satan	19	“ To see three cowards stoning a dying lady when they were so near death themselves . ”
36415	36425	36404	36405	The blacksmith	1683	“ Pooh ! What do you know about it ? ”
36426	36496	36404	36405	The blacksmith	1683	“ I ? Everything . By profession I am a fortune - teller , and I read the hands of you three -- and some others -- when you lifted them to stone the woman . One of you will die to - morrow week ; another of you will die to - night ; the third has but five minutes to live -- and yonder is the clock ! ”
36538	36571	36528	36529	the blacksmith	1683	“ It is not long to wait for prediction number one . If it fails , young master , you will not live a whole minute after , I promise you that . ”

36855	36898	36852	36852	he	1086	“ Yes , I was laughing at you , because , in fear of what others might report about you , you stoned the woman when your heart revolted at the act -- but I was laughing at the others , too . ”
36899	36902	36852	36852	he	1086	“ Why ? ”
36903	36910	36852	36852	he	1086	“ Because their case was yours . ”

36917	36946	36852	36852	he	1086	“ Well , there were sixty - eight people there , and sixty - two of them had no more desire to throw a stone than you had . ”
36947	36950	36852	36852	he	1086	“ Satan ! ”
36951	37234	36852	36852	he	1086	“ Oh , it 's true . I know your race . It is made up of sheep . It is governed by minorities , seldom or never by majorities . It suppresses its feelings and its beliefs and follows the handful that makes the most noise . Sometimes the noisy handful is right , sometimes wrong ; but no matter , the crowd follows it . The vast majority of the race , whether savage or civilized , are secretly kind - hearted and shrink from inflicting pain , but in the presence of the aggressive and pitiless minority they do n't dare to assert themselves . Think of it ! One kind - hearted creature spies upon another , and sees to it that he loyally helps in iniquities which revolt both of them . Speaking as an expert , I know that ninety - nine out of a hundred of your race were strongly against the killing of witches when that foolishness was first agitated by a handful of pious lunatics in the long ago . And I know that even to - day , after ages of transmitted prejudice and silly teaching , only one person in twenty puts any real heart into the harrying of a witch . And yet apparently everybody hates witches and wants them killed . Some day a handful will rise up on the other side and make the most noise -- perhaps even a single daring man with a big voice and a determined front will do it -- and in a week all the sheep will wheel and follow him , and witch - hunting will come to a sudden end . “
37337	37358	37365	37365	lamb	1098	” I did not like to hear our race called sheep , and said I did not think they were . “
37367	37371	37365	37365	lamb	1098	” said Satan . “
37387	37388	37365	37365	lamb	1098	” “
37394	37395	37365	37365	lamb	1098	” “

37759	38555	38569	38569	he	1115	” Chapter 10 Days and days went by now , and no Satan . It was dull without him . But the astrologer , who had returned from his excursion to the moon , went about the village , braving public opinion , and getting a stone in the middle of his back now and then when some witch - hater got a safe chance to throw it and dodge out of sight . Meantime two influences had been working well for Marget . That Satan , who was quite indifferent to her , had stopped going to her house after a visit or two had hurt her pride , and she had set herself the task of banishing him from her heart . Reports of Wilhelm Meidling 's dissipation brought to her from time to time by old Ursula had touched her with remorse , jealousy of Satan being the cause of it ; and so now , these two matters working upon her together , she was getting a good profit out of the combination -- her interest in Satan was steadily cooling , her interest in Wilhelm as steadily warming . All that was needed to complete her conversion was that Wilhelm should brace up and do something that should cause favorable talk and incline the public toward him again . The opportunity came now . Marget sent and asked him to defend her uncle in the approaching trial , and he was greatly pleased , and stopped drinking and began his preparations with diligence . With more diligence than hope , in fact , for it was not a promising case . He had many interviews in his office with Seppi and me , and threshed out our testimony pretty thoroughly , thinking to find some valuable grains among the chaff , but the harvest was poor , of course . If Satan would only come ! That was my constant thought . He could invent some way to win the case ; for he had said it would be won , so he necessarily knew how it could be done . But the days dragged on , and still he did not come . Of course I did not doubt that it would be won , and that Father Peter would be happy for the rest of his life , since Satan had said so ; yet I knew I should be much more comfortable if he would come and tell us how to manage it . It was getting high time for Father Peter to have a saving change toward happiness , for by general report he was worn out with his imprisonment and the ignominy that was burdening him , and was like to die of his miseries unless he got relief soon . At last the trial came on , and the people gathered from all around to witness it ; among them many strangers from considerable distances . Yes , everybody was there except the accused . He was too feeble in body for the strain . But Marget was present , and keeping up her hope and her spirit the best she could . The money was present , too . It was emptied on the table , and was handled and caressed and examined by such as were privileged . The astrologer was put in the witness - box . He had on his best hat and robe for the occasion . QUESTION . You claim that this money is yours ? ANSWER . I do . Q. How did you come by it ? A. I found the bag in the road when I was returning from a journey . Q. When ? A. More than two years ago . Q. What did you do with it ? A. I brought it home and hid it in a secret place in my observatory , intending to find the owner if I could . Q. You endeavored to find him ? A. I made diligent inquiry during several months , but nothing came of it . Q. And then ? A. I thought it not worth while to look further , and was minded to use the money in finishing the wing of the foundling - asylum connected with the priory and nunnery . So I took it out of its hiding - place and counted it to see if any of it was missing . And then-- Q. Why do you stop ? Proceed . A. I am sorry to have to say this , but just as I had finished and was restoring the bag to its place , I looked up and there stood Father Peter behind me . Several murmured , “
38560	38565	38569	38569	he	1115	” but others answered , “
38575	39243	38569	38569	he	1115	” Q. That made you uneasy ? A. No ; I thought nothing of it at the time , for Father Peter often came to me unannounced to ask for a little help in his need . Marget blushed crimson at hearing her uncle falsely and impudently charged with begging , especially from one he had always denounced as a fraud , and was going to speak , but remembered herself in time and held her peace . Q. Proceed . A. In the end I was afraid to contribute the money to the foundling - asylum , but elected to wait yet another year and continue my inquiries . When I heard of Father Peter 's find I was glad , and no suspicion entered my mind ; when I came home a day or two later and discovered that my own money was gone I still did not suspect until three circumstances connected with Father Peter 's good fortune struck me as being singular coincidences . Q. Pray name them . A. Father Peter had found his money in a path -- I had found mine in a road . Father Peter 's find consisted exclusively of gold ducats -- mine also . Father Peter found eleven hundred and seven ducats -- I exactly the same . This closed his evidence , and certainly it made a strong impression on the house ; one could see that . Wilhelm Meidling asked him some questions , then called us boys , and we told our tale . It made the people laugh , and we were ashamed . We were feeling pretty badly , anyhow , because Wilhelm was hopeless , and showed it . He was doing as well as he could , poor young fellow , but nothing was in his favor , and such sympathy as there was was now plainly not with his client . It might be difficult for court and people to believe the astrologer 's story , considering his character , but it was almost impossible to believe Father Peter 's . We were already feeling badly enough , but when the astrologer 's lawyer said he believed he would not ask us any questions -- for our story was a little delicate and it would be cruel for him to put any strain upon it -- everybody tittered , and it was almost more than we could bear . Then he made a sarcastic little speech , and got so much fun out of our tale , and it seemed so ridiculous and childish and every way impossible and foolish , that it made everybody laugh till the tears came ; and at last Marget could not keep up her courage any longer , but broke down and cried , and I was so sorry for her . Now I noticed something that braced me up . It was Satan standing alongside of Wilhelm ! And there was such a contrast!--Satan looked so confident , had such a spirit in his eyes and face , and Wilhelm looked so depressed and despondent . We two were comfortable now , and judged that he would testify and persuade the bench and the people that black was white and white black , or any other color he wanted it . We glanced around to see what the strangers in the house thought of him , for he was beautiful , you know -- stunning , in fact -- but no one was noticing him ; so we knew by that that he was invisible . The lawyer was saying his last words ; and while he was saying them Satan began to melt into Wilhelm . He melted into him and disappeared ; and then there was a change , when his spirit began to look out of Wilhelm 's eyes . That lawyer finished quite seriously , and with dignity . He pointed to the money , and said : “
39319	39329	39339	39339	he	1120	” He sat down . Wilhelm rose and said : “
39362	39373	39358	39358	I	0	” The astrologer said his understanding of it was correct . “
39410	39425	39401	39401	me	0	” The astrologer nodded his head . Wilhelm turned to the bench and said : “
39444	39445	39427	39427	I	0	” “
39475	39527	39462	39462	your	1348	” He broke off and began to consult with the other judges . Meantime that other lawyer got up excited and began to protest against allowing new witnesses to be brought into the case at this late stage . The judges decided that his contention was just and must be allowed . “
39536	39540	39532	39534	a new witness	1125	” said Wilhelm . “
39554	39555	39548	39548	I	0	” “
39565	39566	39567	39567	It	1126	” “
39600	39659	39595	39595	it	1126	” And it was so ! There was the greatest excitement in the court while that lawyer and the judges were reaching for coins and examining them and exclaiming . And everybody was full of admiration of Wilhelm 's brightness in happening to think of that neat idea . At last order was called and the court said : “
39716	40065	39675	39676	The court	451	” So the money could speak , after all , though that lawyer thought it could n't . The court rose , and almost everybody came forward to shake hands with Marget and congratulate her , and then to shake with Wilhelm and praise him ; and Satan had stepped out of Wilhelm and was standing around looking on full of interest , and people walking through him every which way , not knowing he was there . And Wilhelm could not explain why he only thought of the date on the coins at the last moment , instead of earlier ; he said it just occurred to him , all of a sudden , like an inspiration , and he brought it right out without any hesitation , for , although he did n't examine the coins , he seemed , somehow , to know it was true . That was honest of him , and like him ; another would have pretended he had thought of it earlier , and was keeping it back for a surprise . He had dulled down a little now ; not much , but still you could notice that he had n't that luminous look in his eyes that he had while Satan was in him . He nearly got it back , though , for a moment when Marget came and praised him and thanked him and could n't keep him from seeing how proud she was of him . The astrologer went off dissatisfied and cursing , and Solomon Isaacs gathered up the money and carried it away . It was Father Peter 's for good and all , now . Satan was gone . I judged that he had spirited himself away to the jail to tell the prisoner the news ; and in this I was right . Marget and the rest of us hurried thither at our best speed , in a great state of rejoicing . Well , what Satan had done was this : he had appeared before that poor prisoner , exclaiming , “
40086	40208	39675	39676	The court	451	” The shock unseated the old man 's reason . When we arrived , ten minutes later , he was parading pompously up and down and delivering commands to this and that and the other constable or jailer , and calling them Grand chamberlain , and Prince This and Prince That , and Admiral of the Fleet , Field Marshal in Command , and all such fustian , and was as happy as a bird . He thought he was Emperor ! Marget flung herself on his breast and cried , and indeed everybody was moved almost to heartbreak . He recognized Marget , but could not understand why she should cry . He patted her on the shoulder and said : “
40251	40276	40245	40246	the Emperor	967	” Then he looked around and saw old Ursula with her apron to her eyes . He was puzzled at that , and said , “
40285	40300	40245	40246	the Emperor	967	” Through her sobs she got out words explaining that she was distressed to see him--“so
40302	40318	40245	40246	the Emperor	967	” He reflected over that a moment , then muttered , as if to himself : “
40353	40360	40348	40348	she	1463	” His eyes fell on Wilhelm . “
40365	40369	40348	40348	she	1463	” he said , “
40431	40546	40422	40422	You	1141	” He petted Marget and kissed her , and was so contented with himself and with everybody that he could not do enough for us all , but began to give away kingdoms and such things right and left , and the least that any of us got was a principality . And so at last , being persuaded to go home , he marched in imposing state ; and when the crowds along the way saw how it gratified him to be hurrahed at , they humored him to the top of his desire , and he responded with condescending bows and gracious smiles , and often stretched out a hand and said , “
40553	40606	40422	40422	You	1141	” As pitiful a sight as ever I saw . And Marget , and old Ursula crying all the way . On my road home I came upon Satan , and reproached him with deceiving me with that lie . He was not embarrassed , but said , quite simply and composedly : “
40676	40677	40684	40684	Satan	19	” “
40702	40715	40691	40691	you	19	” It was difficult to irritate Satan , but that accomplished it . “
40722	40726	40691	40691	you	19	” he said . “
40902	40912	40897	40897	you	1142	” He heaved a discouraged sigh , and said , “
40925	41094	40897	40897	you	1142	” There it was , you see . He did n't seem to know any way to do a person a favor except by killing him or making a lunatic out of him . I apologized , as well as I could ; but privately I did not think much of his processes -- at that time . Satan was accustomed to say that our race lived a life of continuous and uninterrupted self - deception . It duped itself from cradle to grave with shams and delusions which it mistook for realities , and this made its entire life a sham . Of the score of fine qualities which it imagined it had and was vain of , it really possessed hardly one . It regarded itself as gold , and was only brass . One day when he was in this vein he mentioned a detail -- the sense of humor . I cheered up then , and took issue . I said we possessed it . “
41100	41104	40897	40897	you	1142	” he said ; “
41345	41507	41510	41510	you	1164	” We were traveling at the time and stopped at a little city in India and looked on while a juggler did his tricks before a group of natives . They were wonderful , but I knew Satan could beat that game , and I begged him to show off a little , and he said he would . He changed himself into a native in turban and breech - cloth , and very considerately conferred on me a temporary knowledge of the language . The juggler exhibited a seed , covered it with earth in a small flower - pot , then put a rag over the pot ; after a minute the rag began to rise ; in ten minutes it had risen a foot ; then the rag was removed and a little tree was exposed , with leaves upon it and ripe fruit . We ate the fruit , and it was good . But Satan said : “
41525	41526	41517	41517	you	1164	” “
41529	41534	41517	41517	you	1164	” said the juggler ; “
41541	41542	41517	41517	you	1164	” “
41566	41574	41561	41561	I	0	” He took the seed and said , “
41582	41583	41577	41577	I	0	” “
41598	41599	41592	41592	you	1164	” “
41624	41625	41615	41615	I	0	” “
41629	41635	41615	41615	I	0	” and the juggler laughed . “
41649	41650	41638	41638	I	0	” “
41655	41680	41652	41652	God	17	” and they all laughed . Satan put the seed in the ground , put a handful of dust on it , and said , “
41683	41882	41652	41652	God	17	” A tiny stem shot up and began to grow , and grew so fast that in five minutes it was a great tree , and we were sitting in the shade of it . There was a murmur of wonder , then all looked up and saw a strange and pretty sight , for the branches were heavy with fruits of many kinds and colors -- oranges , grapes , bananas , peaches , cherries , apricots , and so on . Baskets were brought , and the unlading of the tree began ; and the people crowded around Satan and kissed his hand , and praised him , calling him the prince of jugglers . The news went about the town , and everybody came running to see the wonder -- and they remembered to bring baskets , too . But the tree was equal to the occasion ; it put out new fruits as fast as any were removed ; baskets were filled by the score and by the hundred , but always the supply remained undiminished . At last a foreigner in white linen and sun - helmet arrived , and exclaimed , angrily : “
41904	41938	41890	41891	you dogs	1169	” The natives put down their baskets and made humble obeisance . Satan made humble obeisance , too , with his fingers to his forehead , in the native way , and said : “
41983	41996	41999	41999	you	1348	” This made the foreigner very angry , and he cried out , “
42018	42071	41999	41999	you	1348	” and he struck Satan with his cane and followed this error with a kick . The fruits rotted on the branches , and the leaves withered and fell . The foreigner gazed at the bare limbs with the look of one who is surprised , and not gratified . Satan said : “
42210	42285	42286	42286	I	0	” The foreigner was proud and would n't beg , but I thought he looked as if he would like to . While he stood gazing at Satan we vanished away and landed in Ceylon . I was sorry for that man ; sorry Satan had n't been his customary self and killed him or made him a lunatic . It would have been a mercy . Satan overheard the thought , and said : “
42356	42357	42358	42358	He	0	” “
42364	42365	42366	42366	He	0	” “
42403	42404	42378	42378	he	0	” “
42417	42418	42406	42409	none of those natives	1187	” “
42481	42505	42473	42473	I	0	” It grieved me , though not sharply , to see him take such a malicious satisfaction in his plans for this foreigner . “
42516	42517	42518	42518	He	0	” “
42604	42605	42589	42589	he	0	” “
42610	42611	42612	42612	He	0	” “
42638	42639	42641	42641	he	0	” “
42646	42647	42641	42641	he	0	” “
42706	42707	42736	42736	he	0	” “
42728	42729	42720	42720	he	292	” “
42773	42782	42759	42760	The man	1318	” I reflected a little , then said , “
42796	42797	42785	42785	you	19	” “
42809	43023	42785	42785	you	19	” We flitted from place to place around the world as we had done before , Satan showing me a hundred wonders , most of them reflecting in some way the weakness and triviality of our race . He did this now every few days -- not out of malice -- I am sure of that -- it only seemed to amuse and interest him , just as a naturalist might be amused and interested by a collection of ants . Chapter 11 For as much as a year Satan continued these visits , but at last he came less often , and then for a long time he did not come at all . This always made me lonely and melancholy . I felt that he was losing interest in our tiny world and might at any time abandon his visits entirely . When one day he finally came to me I was overjoyed , but only for a little while . He had come to say good - by , he told me , and for the last time . He had investigations and undertakings in other corners of the universe , he said , that would keep him busy for a longer period than I could wait for his return . “
43038	43039	43025	43025	you	1204	” “
43042	43046	43025	43025	you	1204	” he said . “
43079	43080	43070	43070	we	1205	” “
43099	43113	43091	43091	We	1205	” Then , all tranquilly and soberly , he made the strange answer , “
43119	43156	43091	43091	We	1205	” A subtle influence blew upon my spirit from his , bringing with it a vague , dim , but blessed and hopeful feeling that the incredible words might be true -- even must be true . “
43165	43166	43158	43158	you	1204	” “
43180	43181	43091	43091	We	1205	” “
43186	43212	43091	43091	We	1205	” A gust of thankfulness rose in my breast , but a doubt checked it before it could issue in words , and I said , “
43232	43233	43091	43091	We	1205	” “
43244	43259	43091	43091	We	1205	” I could hardly breathe for the great hope that was struggling in me . “
43263	43264	43158	43158	you	1204	” “
43275	43296	43346	43346	I	0	” It was electrical . By God ! I had had that very thought a thousand times in my musings ! “
43344	43345	43346	43346	I	0	” “
43348	43349	43346	43346	I	0	” “
43424	43506	43403	43403	you	1212	“ I am perishing already -- I am failing -- I am passing away . In a little while you will be alone in shoreless space , to wander its limitless solitudes without friend or comrade forever -- for you will remain a thought , the only existent thought , and by your nature inextinguishable , indestructible . But I , your poor servant , have revealed you to yourself and set you free . Dream other dreams , and better ! “
43765	43838	43853	43854	no God	1228	“ You perceive , now , that these things are all impossible except in a dream . You perceive that they are pure and puerile insanities , the silly creations of an imagination that is not conscious of its freaks -- in a word , that they are a dream , and you the maker of it . The dream - marks are all present ; you should have recognized them earlier . “
43916	43972	43891	43891	you	1227	” He vanished , and left me appalled ; for I knew , and realized , that all he had said was true . A FABLE Once upon a time an artist who had painted a small and very beautiful picture placed it so that he could see it in the mirror . He said , “
43992	44091	43891	43891	you	1227	” The animals out in the woods heard of this through the housecat , who was greatly admired by them because he was so learned , and so refined and civilized , and so polite and high - bred , and could tell them so much which they did n't know before , and were not certain about afterward . They were much excited about this new piece of gossip , and they asked questions , so as to get at a full understanding of it . They asked what a picture was , and the cat explained . “
44098	44102	43891	43891	you	1227	” he said ; “
44121	44147	43891	43891	you	1227	” That excited them almost to a frenzy , and they said they would give the world to see it . Then the bear asked : “
44157	44158	43891	43891	you	1227	” “
44166	44192	43891	43891	you	1227	” said the cat . This filled them with admiration and uncertainty , and they were more excited than ever . Then the cow asked : “
44198	44199	43891	43891	you	1227	” “
44208	44213	44214	44214	You	1230	” said the cat . “
44256	44525	44526	44527	The cat	1871	” The ass had not said anything as yet ; he now began to throw doubts . He said there had never been anything as beautiful as this before , and probably was n't now . He said that when it took a whole basketful of sesquipedalian adjectives to whoop up a thing of beauty , it was time for suspicion . It was easy to see that these doubts were having an effect upon the animals , so the cat went off offended . The subject was dropped for a couple of days , but in the meantime curiosity was taking a fresh start , and there was a revival of interest perceptible . Then the animals assailed the ass for spoiling what could possibly have been a pleasure to them , on a mere suspicion that the picture was not beautiful , without any evidence that such was the case . The ass was not troubled ; he was calm , and said there was one way to find out who was in the right , himself or the cat : he would go and look in that hole , and come back and tell what he found there . The animals felt relieved and grateful , and asked him to go at once -- which he did . But he did not know where he ought to stand ; and so , through error , he stood between the picture and the mirror . The result was that the picture had no chance , and did n't show up . He returned home and said : “
44569	44574	44576	44576	you	1232	” The elephant asked : “
44589	44590	44591	44591	I	0	” “
44616	44617	44610	44610	I	0	” “
44623	44628	44651	44651	Baloo	64	” said the elephant ; “
44663	44677	44651	44651	Baloo	64	” So the bear went . When he came back , he said : “
44697	45113	44651	44651	Baloo	64	” Great was the surprise and puzzlement of the animals . Each was now anxious to make the test himself and get at the straight truth . The elephant sent them one at a time . First , the cow . She found nothing in the hole but a cow . The tiger found nothing in it but a tiger . The lion found nothing in it but a lion . The leopard found nothing in it but a leopard . The camel found a camel , and nothing more . Then Hathi was wroth , and said he would have the truth , if he had to go and fetch it himself . When he returned , he abused his whole subjectry for liars , and was in an unappeasable fury with the moral and mental blindness of the cat . He said that anybody but a near - sighted fool could see that there was nothing in the hole but an elephant . MORAL , BY THE CAT You can find in a text whatever you bring , if you will stand between it and the mirror of your imagination . You may not see your ears , but they will be there . HUNTING THE DECEITFUL TURKEY When I was a boy my uncle and his big boys hunted with the rifle , the youngest boy Fred and I with a shotgun -- a small single - barrelled shotgun which was properly suited to our size and strength ; it was not much heavier than a broom . We carried it turn about , half an hour at a time . I was not able to hit anything with it , but I liked to try . Fred and I hunted feathered small game , the others hunted deer , squirrels , wild turkeys , and such things . My uncle and the big boys were good shots . They killed hawks and wild geese and such like on the wing ; and they did n't wound or kill squirrels , they stunned them . When the dogs treed a squirrel , the squirrel would scamper aloft and run out on a limb and flatten himself along it , hoping to make himself invisible in that way -- and not quite succeeding . You could see his wee little ears sticking up . You could n't see his nose , but you knew where it was . Then the hunter , despising a “
45115	45448	44651	44651	Baloo	64	” for his rifle , stood up and took offhand aim at the limb and sent a bullet into it immediately under the squirrel 's nose , and down tumbled the animal , unwounded , but unconscious ; the dogs gave him a shake and he was dead . Sometimes when the distance was great and the wind not accurately allowed for , the bullet would hit the squirrel 's head ; the dogs could do as they pleased with that one -- the hunter 's pride was hurt , and he would n't allow it to go into the gamebag . In the first faint gray of the dawn the stately wild turkeys would be stalking around in great flocks , and ready to be sociable and answer invitations to come and converse with other excursionists of their kind . The hunter concealed himself and imitated the turkey - call by sucking the air through the leg - bone of a turkey which had previously answered a call like that and lived only just long enough to regret it . There is nothing that furnishes a perfect turkey - call except that bone . Another of Nature 's treacheries , you see . She is full of them ; half the time she does n't know which she likes best -- to betray her child or protect it . In the case of the turkey she is badly mixed : she gives it a bone to be used in getting it into trouble , and she also furnishes it with a trick for getting itself out of the trouble again . When a mamma - turkey answers an invitation and finds she has made a mistake in accepting it , she does as the mamma - partridge does -- remembers a previous engagement -- and goes limping and scrambling away , pretending to be very lame ; and at the same time she is saying to her not - visible children , “
45478	46435	46436	46436	I	0	” When a person is ignorant and confiding , this immoral device can have tiresome results . I followed an ostensibly lame turkey over a considerable part of the United States one morning , because I believed in her and could not think she would deceive a mere boy , and one who was trusting her and considering her honest . I had the single - barrelled shotgun , but my idea was to catch her alive . I often got within rushing distance of her , and then made my rush ; but always , just as I made my final plunge and put my hand down where her back had been , it was n't there ; it was only two or three inches from there and I brushed the tail - feathers as I landed on my stomach -- a very close call , but still not quite close enough ; that is , not close enough for success , but just close enough to convince me that I could do it next time . She always waited for me , a little piece away , and let on to be resting and greatly fatigued ; which was a lie , but I believed it , for I still thought her honest long after I ought to have begun to doubt her , suspecting that this was no way for a high - minded bird to be acting . I followed , and followed , and followed , making my periodical rushes , and getting up and brushing the dust off , and resuming the voyage with patient confidence ; indeed , with a confidence which grew , for I could see by the change of climate and vegetation that we were getting up into the high latitudes , and as she always looked a little tireder and a little more discouraged after each rush , I judged that I was safe to win , in the end , the competition being purely a matter of staying power and the advantage lying with me from the start because she was lame . Along in the afternoon I began to feel fatigued myself . Neither of us had had any rest since we first started on the excursion , which was upwards of ten hours before , though latterly we had paused awhile after rushes , I letting on to be thinking about something else ; but neither of us sincere , and both of us waiting for the other to call game but in no real hurry about it , for indeed those little evanescent snatches of rest were very grateful to the feelings of us both ; it would naturally be so , skirmishing along like that ever since dawn and not a bite in the meantime ; at least for me , though sometimes as she lay on her side fanning herself with a wing and praying for strength to get out of this difficulty a grasshopper happened along whose time had come , and that was well for her , and fortunate , but I had nothing -- nothing the whole day . More than once , after I was very tired , I gave up taking her alive , and was going to shoot her , but I never did it , although it was my right , for I did not believe I could hit her ; and besides , she always stopped and posed , when I raised the gun , and this made me suspicious that she knew about me and my marksmanship , and so I did not care to expose myself to remarks . I did not get her , at all . When she got tired of the game at last , she rose from almost under my hand and flew aloft with the rush and whir of a shell and lit on the highest limb of a great tree and sat down and crossed her legs and smiled down at me , and seemed gratified to see me so astonished . I was ashamed , and also lost ; and it was while wandering the woods hunting for myself that I found a deserted log cabin and had one of the best meals there that in my life - days I have eaten . The weed - grown garden was full of ripe tomatoes , and I ate them ravenously , though I had never liked them before . Not more than two or three times since have I tasted anything that was so delicious as those tomatoes . I surfeited myself with them , and did not taste another one until I was in middle life . I can eat them now , but I do not like the look of them . I suppose we have all experienced a surfeit at one time or another . Once , in stress of circumstances , I ate part of a barrel of sardines , there being nothing else at hand , but since then I have always been able to get along without sardines . THE McWILLIAMSES AND THE BURGLAR ALARM The conversation drifted smoothly and pleasantly along from weather to crops , from crops to literature , from literature to scandal , from scandal to religion ; then took a random jump , and landed on the subject of burglar alarms . And now for the first time Mr. McWilliams showed feeling . Whenever I perceive this sign on this man 's dial , I comprehend it , and lapse into silence , and give him opportunity to unload his heart . Said he , with but ill - controlled emotion : “
46760	46833	46834	46834	He	1318	“ I said : ' Smoke along , then , if it is the custom , though I think that the conceding of a privilege to a burglar which is denied to a bishop is a conspicuous sign of the looseness of the times . But waiving all that , what business have you to be entering this house in this furtive and clandestine way , without ringing the burglar alarm ? ' “
46941	47009	46933	46933	I	0	“ I said : ' Your sentiments do you honor , but if you will allow me to say it , metaphor is not your best hold . Spare your thigh ; this kind light only on the box , and seldom there , in fact , if my experience may be trusted . But to return to business : how did you get in here ? ' “
47019	47285	46933	46933	I	0	“ It was even so . I redeemed the tinware at pawnbroker 's rates , less cost of advertising , bade the burglar good - night , closed the window after him , and retired to headquarters to report . Next morning we sent for the burglar - alarm man , and he came up and explained that the reason the alarm did not ' go off ' was that no part of the house but the first floor was attached to the alarm . This was simply idiotic ; one might as well have no armor on at all in battle as to have it only on his legs . The expert now put the whole second story on the alarm , charged three hundred dollars for it , and went his way . By and by , one night , I found a burglar in the third story , about to start down a ladder with a lot of miscellaneous property . My first impulse was to crack his head with a billiard cue ; but my second was to refrain from this attention , because he was between me and the cue rack . The second impulse was plainly the soundest , so I refrained , and proceeded to compromise . I redeemed the property at former rates , after deducting ten per cent . for use of ladder , it being my ladder , and , next day we sent down for the expert once more , and had the third story attached to the alarm , for three hundred dollars . “
47374	47675	47706	47706	he	1928	“ We should have been comfortable now but for one defect . Every morning at five the cook opened the kitchen door , in the way of business , and rip went that gong ! The first time this happened I thought the last day was come sure . I did n't think it in bed -- no , but out of it -- for the first effect of that frightful gong is to hurl you across the house , and slam you against the wall , and then curl you up , and squirm you like a spider on a stove lid , till somebody shuts the kitchen door . In solid fact , there is no clamor that is even remotely comparable to the dire clamor which that gong makes . Well , this catastrophe happened every morning regularly at five o'clock , and lost us three hours sleep ; for , mind you , when that thing wakes you , it does n't merely wake you in spots ; it wakes you all over , conscience and all , and you are good for eighteen hours of wide - awakeness subsequently -- eighteen hours of the very most inconceivable wide - awakeness that you ever experienced in your life . A stranger died on our hands one time , and we vacated and left him in our room overnight . Did that stranger wait for the general judgment ? No , sir ; he got up at five the next morning in the most prompt and unostentatious way . I knew he would ; I knew it mighty well . He collected his life - insurance , and lived happy ever after , for there was plenty of proof as to the perfect squareness of his death . “
47890	48027	48030	48030	I	0	“ Sent down for the expert again , and this time he struck a most dazzling idea -- he fixed the thing so that opening the kitchen door would take off the alarm . It was a noble idea , and he charged accordingly . But you already foresee the result . I switched on the alarm every night at bed - time , no longer trusting on Thomas 's frail memory ; and as soon as the lights were out the burglars walked in at the kitchen door , thus taking the alarm off without waiting for the cook to do it in the morning . You see how aggravatingly we were situated . For months we could n't have any company . Not a spare bed in the house ; all occupied by burglars . “
48098	48382	48383	48384	The expert	1928	“ But by and by the irrepressible alarm invented a new kink . One winter 's night we were flung out of bed by the sudden music of that awful gong , and when we hobbled to the annunciator , turned up the gas , and saw the word ' Nursery ' exposed , Mrs. McWilliams fainted dead away , and I came precious near doing the same thing myself . I seized my shotgun , and stood timing the coachman whilst that appalling buzzing went on . I knew that his gong had flung him out , too , and that he would be along with his gun as soon as he could jump into his clothes . When I judged that the time was ripe , I crept to the room next the nursery , glanced through the window , and saw the dim outline of the coachman in the yard below , standing at present - arms and waiting for a chance . Then I hopped into the nursery and fired , and in the same instant the coachman fired at the red flash of my gun . Both of us were successful ; I crippled a nurse , and he shot off all my back hair . We turned up the gas , and telephoned for a surgeon . There was not a sign of a burglar , and no window had been raised . One glass was absent , but that was where the coachman 's charge had come through . Here was a fine mystery -- a burglar alarm ' going off ' at midnight of its own accord , and not a burglar in the neighborhood ! “
48424	48580	48408	48408	he	1928	“ What we suffered from false alarms for the next three years no stylographic pen can describe . During the next three months I always flew with my gun to the room indicated , and the coachman always sallied forth with his battery to support me . But there was never anything to shoot at -- windows all tight and secure . We always sent down for the expert next day , and he fixed those particular windows so they would keep quiet a week or so , and always remembered to send us a bill about like this : Wire ............................ $ 2.15 Nipple ........................... .75 Two hours ’ labor ................ 1.50 Wax .............................. .47 Tape ............................. .34 Screws ........................... .15 Recharging battery .............. .98 Three hours ’ labor .............. 2.25 String ........................... .02 Lard ............................ .66 Pond 's Extract .................. 1.25 Springs at 50 .................... 2.00 Railroad fares ................... 7.25 — — — 19.77 “
48704	48801	48802	48802	We	1284	“ It was at this unprotected time that the heaviest calamity of all happened . The burglars walked in one night and carried off the burglar alarm ! yes , sir , every hide and hair of it : ripped it out , tooth and nail ; springs , bells , gongs , battery , and all ; they took a hundred and fifty miles of copper wire ; they just cleaned her out , bag and baggage , and never left us a vestige of her to swear at -- swear by , I mean . “
49034	49257	49286	49286	sir,--and	1299	“ After that we had a most tranquil season during three months . The bill was prodigious , of course , and I had said I would not pay it until the new machinery had proved itself to be flawless . The time stipulated was three months . So I paid the bill , and the very next day the alarm went to buzzing like ten thousand bee swarms at ten o'clock in the morning . I turned the hands around twelve hours , according to instructions , and this took off the alarm ; but there was another hitch at night , and I had to set her ahead twelve hours once more to get her to put the alarm on again . That sort of nonsense went on a week or two , then the expert came up and put in a new clock . He came up every three months during the next three years , and put in a new clock . But it was always a failure . His clocks all had the same perverse defect : they would put the alarm on in the daytime , and they would not put it on at night ; and if you forced it on yourself , they would take it off again the minute your back was turned . “
