6622	6625	6546	6546	he	576	“ Yes . ”
6626	6668	6546	6546	he	576	“ Yes , sir . We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris , sir . A vast deal of travelling , sir , in Tellson and Company ’s House . ”
6669	6686	6546	6546	he	576	“ Yes . We are quite a French House , as well as an English one . ”
6687	6707	6546	6546	he	576	“ Yes , sir . Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself , I think , sir ? ”
6708	6729	6546	6546	he	576	“ Not of late years . It is fifteen years since we -- since I -- came last from France . ”
6730	6765	6546	6546	he	576	“ Indeed , sir ? That was before my time here , sir . Before our people ’s time here , sir . The George was in other hands at that time , sir . ”
6766	6771	6546	6546	he	576	“ I believe so . ”
6772	6806	6546	6546	he	576	“ But I would hold a pretty wager , sir , that a House like Tellson and Company was flourishing , a matter of fifty , not to speak of fifteen years ago ? ”
6807	6828	6546	6546	he	576	“ You might treble that , and say a hundred and fifty , yet not be far from the truth . ”
6829	6834	6546	6546	he	576	“ Indeed , sir ! ”
7293	7298	7300	7300	he	133	“ This is Mam’selle ! ”
7333	7337	7338	7339	Miss Manette	140	“ So soon ? ”
7794	7802	7785	7785	he	133	“ Pray take a seat , sir . ”
7825	7833	7835	7836	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I kiss your hand , miss , ”
7859	7880	7835	7836	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I received a letter from the Bank , sir , yesterday , informing me that some intelligence -- or discovery-- ”
7881	7895	7915	7916	Mr. Lorry	133	“ The word is not material , miss ; either word will do . ”
7896	7914	7915	7916	Mr. Lorry	133	“ --respecting the small property of my poor father , whom I never saw -- so long dead-- ”
7950	7983	7915	7916	Mr. Lorry	133	“ --rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris , there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank , so good as to be despatched to Paris for the purpose . ”
7984	7987	8022	8022	she	637	“ Myself . ”
7988	7998	7999	7999	She	637	“ As I was prepared to hear , sir . ”
8040	8146	8034	8034	He	133	“ I replied to the Bank , sir , that as it was considered necessary , by those who know , and who are so kind as to advise me , that I should go to France , and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me , I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself , during the journey , under that worthy gentleman ’s protection . The gentleman had left London , but I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here . ”
8147	8152	8154	8155	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I was happy , ”
8157	8174	8154	8155	Mr. Lorry	133	“ to be entrusted with the charge . I shall be more happy to execute it . ”
8175	8247	8034	8034	He	133	“ Sir , I thank you indeed . I thank you very gratefully . It was told me by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business , and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature . I have done my best to prepare myself , and I naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are . ”
8248	8251	8253	8254	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Naturally , ”
8256	8260	8265	8265	he	133	“ Yes -- I-- ”
8278	8286	8265	8265	he	133	“ It is very difficult to begin . ”
8345	8356	8324	8324	she	639	“ Are you quite a stranger to me , sir ? ”
8357	8362	8324	8324	she	639	“ Am I not ? ”
8445	8471	8426	8426	He	133	“ In your adopted country , I presume , I can not do better than address you as a young English lady , Miss Manette ? ”
8472	8479	8555	8555	He	640	“ If you please , sir . ”
8480	8550	8562	8562	she	641	“ Miss Manette , I am a man of business . I have a business charge to acquit myself of . In your reception of it , do n’t heed me any more than if I was a speaking machine -- truly , I am not much else . I will , with your leave , relate to you , miss , the story of one of our customers . ”
8551	8554	8555	8555	He	640	“ Story ! ”
8574	8610	8567	8567	he	640	“ Yes , customers ; in the banking business we usually call our connection our customers . He was a French gentleman ; a scientific gentleman ; a man of great acquirements -- a Doctor . ”
8611	8616	8562	8562	she	641	“ Not of Beauvais ? ”
8617	8690	8562	8562	she	641	“ Why , yes , of Beauvais . Like Monsieur Manette , your father , the gentleman was of Beauvais . Like Monsieur Manette , your father , the gentleman was of repute in Paris . I had the honour of knowing him there . Our relations were business relations , but confidential . I was at that time in our French House , and had been -- oh ! twenty years . ”
8691	8706	8562	8562	she	641	“ At that time -- I may ask , at what time , sir ? ”
8707	8854	8562	8562	she	641	“ I speak , miss , of twenty years ago . He married -- an English lady -- and I was one of the trustees . His affairs , like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families , were entirely in Tellson ’s hands . In a similar way I am , or I have been , trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers . These are mere business relations , miss ; there is no friendship in them , no particular interest , nothing like sentiment . I have passed from one to another , in the course of my business life , just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day ; in short , I have no feelings ; I am a mere machine . To go on-- ”
8855	8870	8562	8562	she	641	“ But this is my father ’s story , sir ; and I begin to think”--the
8878	8913	8562	8562	she	641	him--“that when I was left an orphan through my mother ’s surviving my father only two years , it was you who brought me to England . I am almost sure it was you . ”
9001	9115	8994	8994	she	642	“ Miss Manette , it _ was _ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself just now , in saying I had no feelings , and that all the relations I hold with my fellow - creatures are mere business relations , when you reflect that I have never seen you since . No ; you have been the ward of Tellson ’s House since , and I have been busy with the other business of Tellson ’s House since . Feelings ! I have no time for them , no chance of them . I pass my whole life , miss , in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle . ”
9164	9208	9209	9209	She	644	“ So far , miss ( as you have remarked ) , this is the story of your regretted father . Now comes the difference . If your father had not died when he did -- Don’t be frightened ! How you start ! ”
9226	9229	9231	9232	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Pray , ”
9265	9280	9281	9281	Her	644	“ pray control your agitation -- a matter of business . As I was saying-- ”
9296	9457	9287	9287	he	643	“ As I was saying ; if Monsieur Manette had not died ; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared ; if he had been spirited away ; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place , though no art could trace him ; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper , across the water there ; for instance , the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time ; if his wife had implored the king , the queen , the court , the clergy , for any tidings of him , and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman , the Doctor of Beauvais . ”
9458	9469	9231	9232	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I entreat you to tell me more , sir . ”
9470	9484	9287	9287	he	643	“ I will . I am going to . You can bear it ? ”
9485	9501	9231	9232	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment . ”
9502	9516	9519	9519	his	645	“ You speak collectedly , and you--_are _ collected . That ’s good ! ”
9529	9578	9519	9519	his	645	“ A matter of business . Regard it as a matter of business -- business that must be done . Now if this doctor ’s wife , though a lady of great courage and spirit , had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born-- ”
9579	9589	9287	9287	he	643	“ The little child was a daughter , sir . ”
9590	9678	9231	9232	Mr. Lorry	133	“ A daughter . A - a - matter of business -- don’t be distressed . Miss , if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born , that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of , by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead -- No , do n’t kneel ! In Heaven ’s name why should you kneel to me ! ”
9679	9696	9519	9519	his	645	“ For the truth . O dear , good , compassionate sir , for the truth ! ”
9697	9772	9287	9287	he	643	“ A -- a matter of business . You confuse me , and how can I transact business if I am confused ? Let us be clear - headed . If you could kindly mention now , for instance , what nine times ninepence are , or how many shillings in twenty guineas , it would be so encouraging . I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind . ”
9823	9926	9814	9814	she	646	“ That ’s right , that ’s right . Courage ! Business ! You have business before you ; useful business . Miss Manette , your mother took this course with you . And when she died -- I believe broken - hearted -- having never slackened her unavailing search for your father , she left you , at two years old , to grow to be blooming , beautiful , and happy , without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison , or wasted there through many lingering years . ”
9963	10005	9949	9949	he	133	“ You know that your parents had no great possession , and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you . There has been no new discovery , of money , or of any other property ; but-- ”
10046	10132	10146	10146	She	648	“ But he has been -- been found . He is alive . Greatly changed , it is too probable ; almost a wreck , it is possible ; though we will hope the best . Still , alive . Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris , and we are going there : I , to identify him if I can : you , to restore him to life , love , duty , rest , comfort . ”
10170	10188	10146	10146	She	648	“ I am going to see his Ghost ! It will be his Ghost -- not him ! ”
10200	10260	10261	10261	She	648	“ There , there , there ! See now , see now ! The best and the worst are known to you , now . You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman , and , with a fair sea voyage , and a fair land journey , you will be soon at his dear side . ”
10273	10292	10261	10261	She	648	“ I have been free , I have been happy , yet his Ghost has never haunted me ! ”
10293	10299	10301	10302	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Only one thing more , ”
10317	10507	10301	10302	Mr. Lorry	133	“ he has been found under another name ; his own , long forgotten or long concealed . It would be worse than useless now to inquire which ; worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked , or always designedly held prisoner . It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries , because it would be dangerous . Better not to mention the subject , anywhere or in any way , and to remove him -- for a while at all events -- out of France . Even I , safe as an Englishman , and even Tellson ’s , important as they are to French credit , avoid all naming of the matter . I carry about me , not a scrap of writing openly referring to it . This is a secret service altogether . My credentials , entries , and memoranda , are all comprehended in the one line , ‘ Recalled to Life ; ’ which may mean anything . But what is the matter ! She does n’t notice a word ! Miss Manette ! ”
10702	10712	10714	10715	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I really think this must be a man ! ”
10729	10737	10739	10740	this figure	654	“ Why , look at you all ! ”
10747	10812	10739	10740	this figure	654	“ Why do n’t you go and fetch things , instead of standing there staring at me ? I am not so much to look at , am I ? Why do n’t you go and fetch things ? I ’ll let you know , if you do n’t bring smelling - salts , cold water , and vinegar , quick , I will . ”
10843	10847	10823	10823	she	653	“ my precious ! ”
10849	10853	10823	10823	she	653	“ my bird ! ”
10869	10875	10876	10876	she	653	“ And you in brown ! ”
10885	10928	10876	10876	she	653	“ could n’t you tell her what you had to tell her , without frightening her to death ? Look at her , with her pretty pale face and her cold hands . Do you call _ that _ being a Banker ? ”
10976	10980	10962	10964	the strong woman	657	“ letting them know ”
11013	11022	11024	11025	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I hope she will do well now , ”
11027	11043	11024	11025	Mr. Lorry	133	“ No thanks to you in brown , if she does . My darling pretty ! ”
11044	11048	11050	11051	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I hope , ”
11062	11071	11050	11051	Mr. Lorry	133	“ that you accompany Miss Manette to France ? ”
11072	11079	11081	11083	the strong woman	657	“ A likely thing , too ! ”
11085	11112	11081	11083	the strong woman	657	“ If it was ever intended that I should go across salt water , do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island ? ”
12804	12811	12813	12813	he	745	“ It ’s not my affair , ”
12823	12837	12840	12840	his	745	“ The people from the market did it . Let them bring another . ”
12861	12875	12853	12853	he	745	“ Say , then , my Gaspard , what do you do there ? ”
12914	12927	12929	12933	the wine - shop keeper	751	“ What now ? Are you a subject for the mad hospital ? ”
12960	12988	12992	12992	he	751	“ Why do you write in the public streets ? Is there -- tell me thou -- is there no other place to write such words in ? ”
13071	13080	13082	13083	the other	756	“ Put it on , put it on , ”
13085	13095	13100	13100	he	751	“ Call wine , wine ; and finish there . ”
13614	13620	13602	13604	the elderly gentleman	780	“ This is our man . ”
13621	13635	13640	13640	himself	147	“ What the devil do _ you _ do in that galley there ? ”
13642	13649	13637	13638	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ I do n’t know you . ”
13677	13684	13691	13692	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ How goes it , Jacques ? ”
13694	13702	13691	13692	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ Is all the spilt wine swallowed ? ”
13703	13709	13711	13712	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ Every drop , Jacques , ”
13750	13756	13758	13762	the second of the three	784	“ It is not often , ”
13768	13797	13758	13762	the second of the three	784	“ that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine , or of anything but black bread and death . Is it not so , Jacques ? ”
13798	13805	13806	13807	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ It is so , Jacques , ”
13870	13907	13858	13858	he	785	“ Ah ! So much the worse ! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths , and hard lives they live , Jacques . Am I right , Jacques ? ”
13908	13915	13920	13921	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ You are right , Jacques , ”
13955	13961	13963	13964	her husband	770	“ Hold then ! True ! ”
13966	13972	13963	13964	her husband	770	“ Gentlemen -- my wife ! ”

14054	14103	14047	14047	his	770	“ good day . The chamber , furnished bachelor - fashion , that you wished to see , and were inquiring for when I stepped out , is on the fifth floor . The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here , ”
14109	14143	14047	14047	his	770	“ near to the window of my establishment . But , now that I remember , one of you has already been there , and can show the way . Gentlemen , adieu ! ”
14184	14189	14191	14192	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ Willingly , sir , ”
14426	14443	14446	14447	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ It is very high ; it is a little difficult . Better to begin slowly . ”
14465	14470	14471	14472	the latter	809	“ Is he alone ? ”
14475	14488	14490	14491	the other	756	“ Alone ! God help him , who should be with him ! ”
14499	14507	14490	14491	the other	756	“ Is he always alone , then ? ”
14508	14511	14446	14447	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ Yes . ”
14512	14518	14490	14491	the other	756	“ Of his own desire ? ”
14519	14566	14490	14491	the other	756	“ Of his own necessity . As he was , when I first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if I would take him , and , at my peril be discreet -- as he was then , so he is now . ”
14567	14573	14446	14447	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ He is greatly changed ? ”
14574	14577	14490	14491	the other	756	“ Changed ! ”
15011	15021	15023	15024	Mr. Lorry	133	“ The door is locked then , my friend ? ”
15028	15033	15039	15040	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ Ay . Yes , ”
15042	15055	15039	15040	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired ? ”
15056	15066	15067	15068	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ I think it necessary to turn the key . ”
15080	15083	15067	15068	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ Why ? ”
15084	15127	15039	15040	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ Why ! Because he has lived so long , locked up , that he would be frightened -- rave -- tear himself to pieces -- die -- come to I know not what harm -- if his door was left open . ”
15128	15133	15135	15136	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Is it possible ! ”
15138	15143	15145	15145	Defarge	147	“ Is it possible ! ”
15149	15205	15145	15145	Defarge	147	“ Yes . And a beautiful world we live in , when it _ is _ possible , and when many other such things are possible , and not only possible , but done -- done , see you!--under that sky there , every day . Long live the Devil . Let us go on . ”
15279	15364	15365	15365	They	829	“ Courage , dear miss ! Courage ! Business ! The worst will be over in a moment ; it is but passing the room - door , and the worst is over . Then , all the good you bring to him , all the relief , all the happiness you bring to him , begin . Let our good friend here , assist you on that side . That ’s well , friend Defarge . Come , now . Business , business ! ”
15478	15489	15491	15492	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ I forgot them in the surprise of your visit , ”
15494	15506	15507	15508	The three	396	“ Leave us , good boys ; we have business here . ”
15560	15570	15547	15548	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette ? ”
15571	15588	15696	15696	he	811	“ I show him , in the way you have seen , to a chosen few . ”
15589	15594	15696	15696	he	811	“ Is that well ? ”
15595	15604	15547	15548	Mr. Lorry	133	“ _ I _ think it is well . ”
15605	15617	15696	15696	he	811	“ Who are the few ? How do you choose them ? ”
15618	15667	15677	15677	he	811	“ I choose them as real men , of my name -- Jacques is my name -- to whom the sight is likely to do good . Enough ; you are English ; that is another thing . Stay there , if you please , a little moment . ”
15828	15839	15840	15840	he	811	“ A - a - a - business , business ! ”
15856	15863	15840	15840	he	811	“ Come in , come in ! ”
15864	15871	15872	15872	she	840	“ I am afraid of it , ”
15877	15883	15872	15872	she	840	“ Of it ? What ? ”
15884	15894	15912	15912	he	811	“ I mean of him . Of my father . ”
16242	16246	16248	16249	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ Good day ! ”
16289	16293	16248	16249	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ Good day ! ”
16294	16305	16248	16249	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ You are still hard at work , I see ? ”
16324	16331	16380	16380	their	854	“ Yes -- I am working . ”
16557	16561	16563	16563	Defarge	147	“ I want , ”
16575	16592	16563	16563	Defarge	147	“ to let in a little more light here . You can bear a little more ? ”
16636	16642	16633	16634	the speaker	865	“ What did you say ? ”
16643	16652	16633	16634	the speaker	865	“ You can bear a little more light ? ”
16653	16665	16633	16634	the speaker	865	“ I must bear it , if you let it in . ”
16980	16994	16996	16996	Defarge	147	“ Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to - day ? ”
17006	17012	16996	16996	Defarge	147	“ What did you say ? ”
17013	17027	16996	16996	Defarge	147	“ Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to - day ? ”
17028	17047	17065	17066	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I ca n’t say that I mean to . I suppose so . I do n’t know . ”
17172	17181	17183	17184	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ You have a visitor , you see , ”
17186	17192	17183	17184	Monsieur Defarge	147	“ What did you say ? ”
17193	17199	17200	17201	The shoemaker	852	“ Here is a visitor . ”
17216	17219	17221	17221	Defarge	147	“ Come ! ”
17223	17254	17221	17221	Defarge	147	“ Here is monsieur , who knows a well - made shoe when he sees one . Show him that shoe you are working at . Take it , monsieur . ”
17263	17279	17255	17256	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is , and the maker ’s name . ”
17293	17308	17289	17290	the shoemaker	852	“ I forget what it was you asked me . What did you say ? ”
17309	17327	17221	17221	Defarge	147	“ I said , could n’t you describe the kind of shoe , for monsieur ’s information ? ”
17328	17368	17369	17369	He	133	“ It is a lady ’s shoe . It is a young lady ’s walking - shoe . It is in the present mode . I never saw the mode . I have had a pattern in my hand . ”
17382	17389	17391	17391	Defarge	147	“ And the maker ’s name ? ”
17505	17514	17561	17561	he	147	“ Did you ask me for my name ? ”
17515	17520	17593	17593	His	133	“ Assuredly I did . ”
17521	17530	17561	17561	he	147	“ One Hundred and Five , North Tower . ”
17531	17536	17561	17561	he	147	“ Is that all ? ”
17537	17546	17561	17561	he	147	“ One Hundred and Five , North Tower . ”
17574	17583	17585	17586	Mr. Lorry	133	“ You are not a shoemaker by trade ? ”
17632	17666	17667	17667	He	147	“ I am not a shoemaker by trade ? No , I was not a shoemaker by trade . I - I learnt it here . I taught myself . I asked leave to-- ”
17734	17762	17764	17764	he	147	“ I asked leave to teach myself , and I got it with much difficulty after a long while , and I have made shoes ever since . ”
17790	17801	17779	17780	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Monsieur Manette , do you remember nothing of me ? ”
17818	17821	17810	17810	he	147	“ Monsieur Manette ”
17833	17876	17823	17824	Mr. Lorry	133	“ do you remember nothing of this man ? Look at him . Look at me . Is there no old banker , no old business , no old servant , no old time , rising in your mind , Monsieur Manette ? ”
18135	18143	18145	18145	Defarge	147	“ Have you recognised him , monsieur ? ”
18150	18195	18196	18196	She	882	“ Yes ; for a moment . At first I thought it quite hopeless , but I have unquestionably seen , for a single moment , the face that I once knew so well . Hush ! Let us draw further back . Hush ! ”
18426	18431	18420	18420	he	147	“ What is this ? ”
18471	18480	18481	18481	She	882	“ You are not the gaoler ’s daughter ? ”
18483	18486	18499	18499	her	882	“ No . ”
18487	18492	18499	18499	her	882	“ Who are you ? ”
18747	18766	18732	18732	He	147	“ It is the same . How can it be ! When was it ! How was it ! ”
18801	18887	18788	18788	He	147	“ She had laid her head upon my shoulder , that night when I was summoned out -- she had a fear of my going , though I had none -- and when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve . ‘ You will leave me them ? They can never help me to escape in the body , though they may in the spirit . ’ Those were the words I said . I remember them very well . ”
18922	18930	18913	18913	they	886	“ How was this?--_Was it you _ ? ”
18967	18989	18950	18950	she	888	“ I entreat you , good gentlemen , do not come near us , do not speak , do not move ! ”
18990	18993	18994	18994	he	147	“ Hark ! ”
18997	19003	19004	19004	His	147	“ Whose voice was that ? ”
19072	19155	19069	19069	his	147	“ No , no , no ; you are too young , too blooming . It ca n’t be . See what the prisoner is . These are not the hands she knew , this is not the face she knew , this is not a voice she ever heard . No , no . She was -- and He was -- before the slow years of the North Tower -- ages ago . What is your name , my gentle angel ? ”
19180	19273	19274	19274	His	890	“ O , sir , at another time you shall know my name , and who my mother was , and who my father , and how I never knew their hard , hard history . But I can not tell you at this time , and I can not tell you here . All that I may tell you , here and now , is , that I pray to you to touch me and to bless me . Kiss me , kiss me ! O my dear , my dear ! ”
19301	19446	19447	19447	She	892	“ If you hear in my voice -- I do n’t know that it is so , but I hope it is -- if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears , weep for it , weep for it ! If you touch , in touching my hair , anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free , weep for it , weep for it ! If , when I hint to you of a Home that is before us , where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service , I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate , while your poor heart pined away , weep for it , weep for it ! ”
19465	19665	19447	19447	She	892	“ If , when I tell you , dearest dear , that your agony is over , and that I have come here to take you from it , and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest , I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste , and of our native France so wicked to you , weep for it , weep for it ! And if , when I shall tell you of my name , and of my father who is living , and of my mother who is dead , you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father , and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night , because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me , weep for it , weep for it ! Weep for her , then , and for me ! Good gentlemen , thank God ! I feel his sacred tears upon my face , and his sobs strike against my heart . O , see ! Thank God for us , thank God ! ”
19818	19825	19826	19826	she	896	“ If , without disturbing him , ”
19848	19873	19826	19826	she	896	“ all could be arranged for our leaving Paris at once , so that , from the very door , he could be taken away-- ”
19874	19886	19888	19889	Mr. Lorry	133	“ But , consider . Is he fit for the journey ? ”
19891	19912	19888	19889	Mr. Lorry	133	“ More fit for that , I think , than to remain in this city , so dreadful to him . ”
19913	19918	19920	19920	Defarge	147	“ It is true , ”
19931	19961	19920	19920	Defarge	147	“ More than that ; Monsieur Manette is , for all reasons , best out of France . Say , shall I hire a carriage and post - horses ? ”
19962	19967	19969	19970	Mr. Lorry	133	“ That ’s business , ”
19981	19996	19969	19970	Mr. Lorry	133	“ and if business is to be done , I had better do it . ”
19997	20003	20005	20006	Miss Manette	140	“ Then be so kind , ”
20008	20097	20005	20006	Miss Manette	140	“ as to leave us here . You see how composed he has become , and you can not be afraid to leave him with me now . Why should you be ? If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption , I do not doubt that you will find him , when you come back , as quiet as you leave him . In any case , I will take care of him until you return , and then we will remove him straight . ”
20569	20584	20555	20555	he	899	“ You remember the place , my father ? You remember coming up here ? ”
20585	20591	20607	20607	she	889	“ What did you say ? ”
20612	20629	20601	20601	he	899	“ Remember ? No , I do n’t remember . It was so very long ago . ”
20658	20667	20655	20655	him	899	“ One Hundred and Five , North Tower ; ”

22861	22875	22809	22810	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ I was not praying against you ; I was praying for you . ”

Here ! your mother ’s a nice woman , young Jerry , going a praying agin your father ’s prosperity . You ’ve got a dutiful mother , you have , my son . You ’ve got a religious mother , you have , my boy : going and flopping herself down , and praying that the bread - and - butter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child . ”
23001	23012	23014	23015	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ And what do you suppose , you conceited female , ”
23021	23045	23014	23015	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ that the worth of _ your _ prayers may be ? Name the price that you put _ your _ prayers at ! ”
23046	23064	22809	22810	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ They only come from the heart , Jerry . They are worth no more than that . ”
23065	23072	23074	23075	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ Worth no more than that , ”
23077	23202	23204	23205	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ They ai n’t worth much , then . Whether or no , I wo n’t be prayed agin , I tell you . I ca n’t afford it . I ’m not a going to be made unlucky by _ your _ sneaking . If you must go flopping yourself down , flop in favour of your husband and child , and not in opposition to ’em . If I had had any but a unnat’ral wife , and this poor boy had had any but a unnat’ral mother , I might have made some money last week instead of being counter - prayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck . B - u - u - ust me ! ”

Young Jerry , dress yourself , my boy , and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then , and if you see any signs of more flopping , give me a call . For , I tell you , ”
23310	23426	23303	23303	he	156	“ I wo n’t be gone agin , in this manner . I am as rickety as a hackney - coach , I ’m as sleepy as laudanum , my lines is strained to that degree that I should n’t know , if it was n’t for the pain in ’em , which was me and which somebody else , yet I ’m none the better for it in pocket ; and it ’s my suspicion that you ’ve been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket , and I wo n’t put up with it , Aggerawayter , and what do you say now ! ”
23435	23468	23303	23303	he	156	“ Ah ! yes ! You ’re religious , too . You would n’t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child , would you ? Not you ! ”

24356	24388	24258	24261	the oldest of clerks	1044	“ Very well . Find the door where the witnesses go in , and show the door - keeper this note for Mr. Lorry . He will then let you in . ”

24454	24512	24444	24444	he	156	“ I am going to tell you . The door - keeper will pass the note to Mr. Lorry , and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry ’s attention , and show him where you stand . Then what you have to do , is , to remain there until he wants you . ”

24631	24665	24599	24599	Jerry	156	“ It ’s hard in the law to spile a man , I think . It ’s hard enough to kill him , but it ’s wery hard to spile him , sir . ”

24677	24712	24673	24675	the ancient clerk	1050	“ Speak well of the law . Take care of your chest and voice , my good friend , and leave the law to take care of itself . I give you that advice . ”
24713	24729	24731	24731	Jerry	156	“ It ’s the damp , sir , what settles on my chest and voice , ”

That ’s the sentence . ”
25451	25463	25464	25464	Jerry	156	“ If he ’s found Guilty , you mean to say ? ”
25472	25481	25483	25484	the other	756	“ Oh ! they ’ll find him guilty , ”
25486	25495	25483	25484	the other	756	“ Do n’t you be afraid of that . ”
25640	25653	25657	25657	he	133	“ What ’s _ he _ got to do with the case ? ”
25662	25668	25670	25670	Jerry	133	“ Blest if I know , ”
25672	25692	25670	25670	Jerry	133	“ What have _ you _ got to do with it , then , if a person may inquire ? ”
25693	25701	25703	25703	Jerry	133	“ Blest if I know that either , ”
27049	27054	27055	27055	Jerry	133	“ Who are they ? ”
27131	27134	27129	27129	Jerry	133	“ Witnesses . ”

28922	28936	28918	28920	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	133	“ Mr. Jarvis Lorry , are you a clerk in Tellson ’s bank ? ”
28937	28941	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ I am . ”
28942	28973	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy - five , did business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail ? ”
28974	28978	28918	28920	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	133	“ It did . ”
28979	28989	28918	28920	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	133	“ Were there any other passengers in the mail ? ”
28990	28993	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ Two . ”
28994	29008	28918	28920	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	133	“ Did they alight on the road in the course of the night ? ”
29009	29013	28918	28920	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	133	“ They did . ”
29014	29031	28918	28920	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	133	“ Mr. Lorry , look upon the prisoner . Was he one of those two passengers ? ”
29032	29043	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ I can not undertake to say that he was . ”
29044	29054	28918	28920	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	133	“ Does he resemble either of these two passengers ? ”
29055	29086	28918	28920	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	133	“ Both were so wrapped up , and the night was so dark , and we were all so reserved , that I can not undertake to say even that . ”
29087	29126	28918	28920	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	133	“ Mr. Lorry , look again upon the prisoner . Supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were , is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them ? ”
29127	29130	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ No . ”
29131	29148	28918	28920	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	133	“ You will not swear , Mr. Lorry , that he was not one of them ? ”
29149	29152	28918	28920	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	133	“ No . ”
29153	29167	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ So at least you say he may have been one of them ? ”
29168	29197	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ Yes . Except that I remember them both to have been -- like myself -- timorous of highwaymen , and the prisoner has not a timorous air . ”
29198	29211	28918	28920	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	133	“ Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity , Mr. Lorry ? ”
29212	29219	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ I certainly have seen that . ”
29220	29243	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ Mr. Lorry , look once more upon the prisoner . Have you seen him , to your certain knowledge , before ? ”
29244	29248	28918	28920	Mr. Jarvis Lorry	133	“ I have . ”
29249	29252	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ When ? ”
29253	29290	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ I was returning from France a few days afterwards , and , at Calais , the prisoner came on board the packet - ship in which I returned , and made the voyage with me . ”
29291	29301	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ At what hour did he come on board ? ”
29302	29309	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ At a little after midnight . ”
29310	29332	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ In the dead of the night . Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour ? ”
29333	29342	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ He happened to be the only one . ”
29343	29370	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ Never mind about ‘ happening , ’ Mr. Lorry . He was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night ? ”
29371	29375	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ He was . ”
29376	29390	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ Were you travelling alone , Mr. Lorry , or with any companion ? ”
29391	29405	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ With two companions . A gentleman and lady . They are here . ”
29406	29419	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ They are here . Had you any conversation with the prisoner ? ”
29420	29449	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ Hardly any . The weather was stormy , and the passage long and rough , and I lay on a sofa , almost from shore to shore . ”
29450	29454	28913	28916	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ Miss Manette ! ”
29496	29505	29481	29482	Her father	5008	“ Miss Manette , look upon the prisoner . ”
29624	29635	29703	29704	the Judge	1094	“ Miss Manette , have you seen the prisoner before ? ”
29636	29641	29703	29704	the Judge	1094	“ Yes , sir . ”
29642	29645	29703	29704	the Judge	1094	“ Where ? ”
29646	29667	29703	29704	the Judge	1094	“ On board of the packet - ship just now referred to , sir , and on the same occasion . ”
29668	29679	29703	29704	the Judge	1094	“ You are the young lady just now referred to ? ”
29680	29689	29694	29694	her	1258	“ O ! most unhappily , I am ! ”
29712	29727	29707	29707	he	5008	“ Answer the questions put to you , and make no remark upon them . ”
29728	29746	29703	29704	the Judge	1094	“ Miss Manette , had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the Channel ? ”
29747	29752	29703	29704	the Judge	1094	“ Yes , sir . ”
29753	29757	29707	29707	he	5008	“ Recall it . ”
29770	29777	29766	29766	she	1258	“ When the gentleman came on board-- ”
29778	29785	29787	29788	the Judge	1094	“ Do you mean the prisoner ? ”
29794	29800	29787	29788	the Judge	1094	“ Yes , my Lord . ”
29801	29807	29766	29766	she	1258	“ Then say the prisoner . ”
29808	29822	29787	29788	the Judge	1094	“ When the prisoner came on board , he noticed that my father , ”
29835	30000	29787	29788	the Judge	1094	“ was much fatigued and in a very weak state of health . My father was so reduced that I was afraid to take him out of the air , and I had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps , and I sat on the deck at his side to take care of him . There were no other passengers that night , but we four . The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter my father from the wind and weather , better than I had done . I had not known how to do it well , not understanding how the wind would set when we were out of the harbour . He did it for me . He expressed great gentleness and kindness for my father ’s state , and I am sure he felt it . That was the manner of our beginning to speak together . ”
30001	30017	29766	29766	she	1258	“ Let me interrupt you for a moment . Had he come on board alone ? ”
30018	30021	29766	29766	she	1258	“ No . ”
30022	30029	29787	29788	the Judge	1094	“ How many were with him ? ”
30030	30035	29766	29766	she	1258	“ Two French gentlemen . ”
30036	30042	29766	29766	she	1258	“ Had they conferred together ? ”
30043	30068	29787	29788	the Judge	1094	“ They had conferred together until the last moment , when it was necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat . ”
30069	30084	29766	29766	she	1258	“ Had any papers been handed about among them , similar to these lists ? ”
30085	30103	29766	29766	she	1258	“ Some papers had been handed about among them , but I do n’t know what papers . ”
30104	30112	29787	29788	the Judge	1094	“ Like these in shape and size ? ”
30113	30184	29787	29788	the Judge	1094	“ Possibly , but indeed I do n’t know , although they stood whispering very near to me : because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there ; it was a dull lamp , and they spoke very low , and I did not hear what they said , and saw only that they looked at papers . ”
30185	30197	29766	29766	she	1258	“ Now , to the prisoner ’s conversation , Miss Manette . ”
30198	30235	29787	29788	the Judge	1094	“ The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me -- which arose out of my helpless situation -- as he was kind , and good , and useful to my father . I hope , ”
30240	30254	29787	29788	the Judge	1094	“ I may not repay him by doing him harm to - day . ”
30262	30319	29787	29788	the Judge	1094	“ Miss Manette , if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to give -- which you must give -- and which you can not escape from giving -- with great unwillingness , he is the only person present in that condition . Please to go on . ”
30320	30394	29766	29766	she	1258	“ He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature , which might get people into trouble , and that he was therefore travelling under an assumed name . He said that this business had , within a few days , taken him to France , and might , at intervals , take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long time to come . ”
30395	30409	29766	29766	she	1258	“ Did he say anything about America , Miss Manette ? Be particular . ”
30410	30496	29787	29788	the Judge	1094	“ He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen , and he said that , so far as he could judge , it was a wrong and foolish one on England ’s part . He added , in a jesting way , that perhaps George Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the Third . But there was no harm in his way of saying this : it was said laughingly , and to beguile the time . ”
30664	30680	30635	30635	he	1125	“ Doctor Manette , look upon the prisoner . Have you ever seen him before ? ”
30681	30705	30635	30635	he	1125	“ Once . When he called at my lodgings in London . Some three years , or three years and a half ago . ”
30706	30730	30635	30635	he	1125	“ Can you identify him as your fellow - passenger on board the packet , or speak to his conversation with your daughter ? ”
30731	30739	30635	30635	he	1125	“ Sir , I can do neither . ”
30740	30756	30757	30757	He	170	“ Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either ? ”
30765	30769	30757	30757	He	170	“ There is . ”
30770	30797	30798	30798	He	170	“ Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment , without trial , or even accusation , in your native country , Doctor Manette ? ”
30810	30815	30798	30798	He	170	“ A long imprisonment . ”
30816	30827	30635	30635	he	1125	“ Were you newly released on the occasion in question ? ”
30828	30834	30635	30635	he	1125	“ They tell me so . ”
30835	30844	30798	30798	He	170	“ Have you no remembrance of the occasion ? ”
30845	30933	30934	30937	Mr. Attorney - General	1125	“ None . My mind is a blank , from some time -- I can not even say what time -- when I employed myself , in my captivity , in making shoes , to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here . She had become familiar to me , when a gracious God restored my faculties ; but , I am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar . I have no remembrance of the process . ”
31166	31180	31154	31155	the counsel	1269	“ You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner ? ”
31187	31198	31209	31209	he	1272	“ Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner ? ”
31214	31226	31209	31209	he	1272	“ Look well upon that gentleman , my learned friend there , ”
31237	31257	31209	31209	he	1272	“ and then look well upon the prisoner . How say you ? Are they very like each other ? ”
32175	32211	32162	32163	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ I ’d hold half a guinea that _ he _ do n’t get no law - work to do . Do n’t look like the sort of one to get any , do he ? ”
32261	32286	32248	32248	he	1354	“ Officer ! look to that young lady . Help the gentleman to take her out . Do n’t you see she will fall ! ”
32523	32597	32598	32598	Jerry	133	“ Jerry , if you wish to take something to eat , you can . But , keep in the way . You will be sure to hear when the jury come in . Do n’t be a moment behind them , for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank . You are the quickest messenger I know , and will get to Temple Bar long before I can . ”
32635	32642	32619	32620	Mr. Carton	172	“ How is the young lady ? ”
32643	32667	32619	32620	Mr. Carton	172	“ She is greatly distressed ; but her father is comforting her , and she feels the better for being out of court . ”
32668	32699	32700	32701	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I ’ll tell the prisoner so . It wo n’t do for a respectable bank gentleman like you , to be seen speaking to him publicly , you know . ”
32753	32757	32758	32759	The prisoner	5091	“ Mr. Darnay ! ”
32764	32794	32758	32759	The prisoner	5091	“ You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness , Miss Manette . She will do very well . You have seen the worst of her agitation . ”
32795	32821	32837	32838	Mr. Carton	172	“ I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it . Could you tell her so for me , with my fervent acknowledgments ? ”
32822	32836	32837	32838	Mr. Carton	172	“ Yes , I could . I will , if you ask it . ”
32867	32878	32850	32850	He	172	“ I do ask it . Accept my cordial thanks . ”
32879	32882	32884	32884	Carton	172	“ What , ”
32893	32901	32884	32884	Carton	172	“ do you expect , Mr. Darnay ? ”
32902	32906	32850	32850	He	172	“ The worst . ”
32907	32930	32884	32884	Carton	172	“ It ’s the wisest thing to expect , and the likeliest . But I think their withdrawing is in your favour . ”
33053	33058	33036	33036	people	360	“ Jerry ! Jerry ! ”
33072	33092	33059	33060	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Here , sir ! It ’s a fight to get back again . Here I am , sir ! ”
33103	33111	33093	33094	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Quick ! Have you got it ? ”
33112	33117	33100	33101	the throng	1385	“ Yes , sir . ”
33126	33129	33093	33094	Mr. Lorry	133	“ ACQUITTED . ”
33130	33146	33148	33148	Jerry	133	“ If you had sent the message , ‘ Recalled to Life , ’ again , ”
33154	33166	33148	33148	Jerry	133	“ I should have known what you meant , this time . ”
33698	33733	33686	33686	he	171	“ I am glad to have brought you off with honour , Mr. Darnay . It was an infamous prosecution , grossly infamous ; but not the less likely to succeed on that account . ”
33734	33751	33753	33755	his late client	1400	“ You have laid me under an obligation to you for life -- in two senses , ”
33761	33787	33753	33755	his late client	1400	“ I have done my best for you , Mr. Darnay ; and my best is as good as another man ’s , I believe . ”
33798	33802	33803	33804	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Much better , ”
33824	33829	33831	33832	Mr. Stryver	171	“ You think so ? ”
33834	33859	33831	33832	Mr. Stryver	171	“ Well ! you have been present all day , and you ought to know . You are a man of business , too . ”
33860	33865	33867	33868	Mr. Lorry	133	“ And as such , ”
33894	33934	33831	33832	Mr. Stryver	171	it--“as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette , to break up this conference and order us all to our homes . Miss Lucie looks ill , Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day , we are worn out . ”
33935	33943	33945	33945	Stryver	171	“ Speak for yourself , Mr. Lorry , ”
33947	33962	33945	33945	Stryver	171	“ I have a night ’s work to do yet . Speak for yourself . ”
33963	33969	33971	33972	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I speak for myself , ”
33974	34001	34002	34002	He	133	“ and for Mr. Darnay , and for Miss Lucie , and -- Miss Lucie , do you not think I may speak for us all ? ”
34066	34070	34072	34072	Lucie	175	“ My father , ”
34093	34102	34108	34108	he	133	“ Shall we go home , my father ? ”
34110	34113	34108	34108	he	133	“ Yes . ”
34316	34332	34300	34300	He	171	“ So , Mr. Lorry ! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now ? ”
34369	34406	34407	34408	Mr. Lorry	133	“ If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind , when the business mind is divided between good - natured impulse and business appearances , you would be amused , Mr. Darnay . ”
34416	34452	34407	34408	Mr. Lorry	133	“ You have mentioned that before , sir . We men of business , who serve a House , are not our own masters . We have to think of the House more than ourselves . ”
34453	34464	34466	34467	Mr. Carton	172	“ _ I _ know , _ I _ know , ”
34471	34498	34466	34467	Mr. Carton	172	“ Do n’t be nettled , Mr. Lorry . You are as good as another , I have no doubt : better , I dare say . ”
34499	34505	34507	34508	Mr. Lorry	133	“ And indeed , sir , ”
34514	34556	34507	34508	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I really do n’t know what you have to do with the matter . If you ’ll excuse me , as very much your elder , for saying so , I really do n’t know that it is your business . ”
34557	34570	34572	34573	Mr. Carton	172	“ Business ! Bless you , _ I _ have no business , ”
34575	34586	34572	34573	Mr. Carton	172	“ It is a pity you have not , sir . ”
34587	34594	34507	34508	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I think so , too . ”
34595	34600	34602	34603	Mr. Lorry	133	“ If you had , ”
34605	34613	34602	34603	Mr. Lorry	133	“ perhaps you would attend to it . ”
34614	34623	34625	34626	Mr. Carton	172	“ Lord love you , no!--I should n’t , ”
34628	34633	34635	34636	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Well , sir ! ”
34644	34718	34635	34636	Mr. Lorry	133	“ business is a very good thing , and a very respectable thing . And , sir , if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments , Mr. Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance . Mr. Darnay , good night , God bless you , sir ! I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life.--Chair there ! ”
34773	34806	34771	34771	Darnay	162	“ This is a strange chance that throws you and me together . This must be a strange night to you , standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones ? ”
34807	34813	34815	34816	Charles Darnay	162	“ I hardly seem yet , ”
34818	34826	34815	34816	Charles Darnay	162	“ to belong to this world again . ”
34827	34856	34922	34922	he	162	“ I do n’t wonder at it ; it ’s not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another . You speak faintly . ”
34857	34868	34922	34922	he	162	“ I begin to think I _ am _ faint . ”
34869	34914	34922	34922	he	162	“ Then why the devil do n’t you dine ? I dined , myself , while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to -- this , or some other . Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at . ”
35003	35022	34994	34994	his	172	“ Do you feel , yet , that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again , Mr. Darnay ? ”
35023	35044	35062	35062	his	172	“ I am frightfully confused regarding time and place ; but I am so far mended as to feel that . ”
35045	35053	35054	35054	He	172	“ It must be an immense satisfaction ! ”
35072	35139	35054	35054	He	172	“ As to me , the greatest desire I have , is to forget that I belong to it . It has no good in it for me -- except wine like this -- nor I for it . So we are not much alike in that particular . Indeed , I begin to think we are not much alike in any particular , you and I. ”
35183	35190	35191	35191	Carton	172	“ Now your dinner is done , ”
35195	35215	35191	35191	Carton	172	“ why do n’t you call a health , Mr. Darnay ; why do n’t you give your toast ? ”
35216	35223	35280	35280	Carton	172	“ What health ? What toast ? ”
35224	35252	35191	35191	Carton	172	“ Why , it ’s on the tip of your tongue . It ought to be , it must be , I ’ll swear it ’s there . ”
35253	35259	35191	35191	Carton	172	“ Miss Manette , then ! ”
35260	35266	35280	35280	Carton	172	“ Miss Manette , then ! ”
35308	35327	35328	35328	he	172	“ That ’s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark , Mr. Darnay ! ”
35342	35345	35328	35328	he	172	“ Yes , ”
35350	35394	35328	35328	he	172	“ That ’s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by ! How does it feel ? Is it worth being tried for one ’s life , to be the object of such sympathy and compassion , Mr. Darnay ? ”
35402	35432	35396	35396	Darnay	162	“ She was mightily pleased to have your message , when I gave it her . Not that she showed she was pleased , but I suppose she was . ”
35477	35488	35490	35492	the careless rejoinder	1435	“ I neither want any thanks , nor merit any , ”
35494	35530	35490	35492	the careless rejoinder	1435	“ It was nothing to do , in the first place ; and I do n’t know why I did it , in the second . Mr. Darnay , let me ask you a question . ”
35531	35543	35490	35492	the careless rejoinder	1435	“ Willingly , and a small return for your good offices . ”
35544	35553	35490	35492	the careless rejoinder	1435	“ Do you think I particularly like you ? ”
35554	35560	35562	35563	the other	756	“ Really , Mr. Carton , ”
35568	35577	35562	35563	the other	756	“ I have not asked myself the question . ”
35578	35586	35490	35492	the careless rejoinder	1435	“ But ask yourself the question now . ”
35587	35604	35490	35492	the careless rejoinder	1435	“ You have acted as if you do ; but I do n’t think you do . ”
35605	35615	35617	35617	Carton	172	“ _ I _ do n’t think I do , ”
35619	35632	35617	35617	Carton	172	“ I begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding . ”
35633	35636	35638	35638	Darnay	162	“ Nevertheless , ”
35646	35674	35675	35675	Carton	172	“ there is nothing in that , I hope , to prevent my calling the reckoning , and our parting without ill - blood on either side . ”
35678	35683	35684	35684	Darnay	162	“ Nothing in life ! ”
35687	35695	35697	35697	Carton	172	“ Do you call the whole reckoning ? ”
35706	35727	35700	35700	his	162	“ Then bring me another pint of this same wine , drawer , and come and wake me at ten . ”
35765	35779	35747	35747	Carton	172	“ A last word , Mr. Darnay : you think I am drunk ? ”
35780	35791	35759	35759	his	172	“ I think you have been drinking , Mr. Carton . ”
35792	35802	35759	35759	his	172	“ Think ? You know I have been drinking . ”
35803	35814	35747	35747	Carton	172	“ Since I must say so , I know it . ”
35815	35848	35759	35759	his	172	“ Then you shall likewise know why . I am a disappointed drudge , sir . I care for no man on earth , and no man on earth cares for me . ”
35849	35863	35759	35759	his	172	“ Much to be regretted . You might have used your talents better . ”
35864	35900	35747	35747	Carton	172	“ May be so , Mr. Darnay ; may be not . Do n’t let your sober face elate you , however ; you do n’t know what it may come to . Good night ! ”
35932	35940	35941	35941	he	1438	“ Do you particularly like the man ? ”
35949	36060	35941	35941	he	1438	“ why should you particularly like a man who resembles you ? There is nothing in you to like ; you know that . Ah , confound you ! What a change you have made in yourself ! A good reason for taking to a man , that he shows you what you have fallen away from , and what you might have been ! Change places with him , and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was , and commiserated by that agitated face as he was ? Come on , and have it out in plain words ! You hate the fellow . ”
36623	36629	36631	36635	the man at the tavern	1460	“ Ten o’clock , sir , ”
36643	36648	36631	36635	the man at the tavern	1460	him--“ten o’clock , sir . ”
36649	36657	36631	36635	the man at the tavern	1460	“ _ What ’s _ the matter ? ”
36658	36664	36631	36635	the man at the tavern	1460	“ Ten o’clock , sir . ”
36665	36676	36631	36635	the man at the tavern	1460	“ What do you mean ? Ten o’clock at night ? ”
36677	36690	36631	36635	the man at the tavern	1460	“ Yes , sir . Your honour told me to call you . ”
36691	36703	36631	36635	the man at the tavern	1460	“ Oh ! I remember . Very well , very well . ”
36874	36883	36885	36885	Stryver	171	“ You are a little late , Memory , ”
36887	36903	36885	36885	Stryver	171	“ About the usual time ; it may be a quarter of an hour later . ”
36964	36976	37071	37072	Mr. Stryver	171	“ You have had your bottle , I perceive , Sydney . ”
36977	37006	37071	37072	Mr. Stryver	171	“ Two to - night , I think . I have been dining with the day ’s client ; or seeing him dine -- it ’s all one ! ”
37007	37038	37071	37072	Mr. Stryver	171	“ That was a rare point , Sydney , that you brought to bear upon the identification . How did you come by it ? When did it strike you ? ”
37039	37070	37071	37072	Mr. Stryver	171	“ I thought he was rather a handsome fellow , and I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow , if I had had any luck . ”
37081	37097	37075	37075	he	171	“ You and your luck , Sydney ! Get to work , get to work . ”
37168	37174	37146	37146	he	1474	“ Now I am ready ! ”
37175	37189	37197	37197	he	171	“ Not much boiling down to be done to - night , Memory , ”
37203	37207	37197	37197	he	171	“ How much ? ”
37208	37215	37146	37146	he	1474	“ Only two sets of them . ”
37216	37223	37197	37197	he	171	“ Give me the worst first . ”
37224	37234	37235	37236	The lion	1476	“ There they are , Sydney . Fire away ! ”
37574	37589	37591	37592	Mr. Stryver	171	“ And now we have done , Sydney , fill a bumper of punch , ”
37619	37642	37708	37708	he	171	“ You were very sound , Sydney , in the matter of those crown witnesses to - day . Every question told . ”
37643	37653	37703	37703	his	171	“ I always am sound ; am I not ? ”
37654	37677	37708	37708	he	171	“ I do n’t gainsay it . What has roughened your temper ? Put some punch to it and smooth it again . ”
37688	37698	37700	37700	Stryver	171	“ The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School , ”
37718	37740	37708	37708	he	171	“ the old seesaw Sydney . Up one minute and down the next ; now in spirits and now in despondency ! ”
37741	37744	37746	37747	the other	756	“ Ah ! ”
37751	37779	37746	37747	the other	756	“ yes ! The same Sydney , with the same luck . Even then , I did exercises for other boys , and seldom did my own . ”
37780	37785	37708	37708	he	171	“ And why not ? ”
37786	37798	37799	37799	He	1474	“ God knows . It was my way , I suppose . ”

37879	37903	38054	38054	he	177	“ your way is , and always was , a lame way . You summon no energy and purpose . Look at me . ”
37904	37909	37911	37911	Sydney	177	“ Oh , botheration ! ”
37923	37932	37911	37911	Sydney	177	“ do n’t _ you _ be moral ! ”
37933	37943	37945	37945	Stryver	171	“ How have I done what I have done ? ”
37947	37956	37945	37945	Stryver	171	“ how do I do what I do ? ”
37957	38010	38054	38054	he	177	“ Partly through paying me to help you , I suppose . But it ’s not worth your while to apostrophise me , or the air , about it ; what you want to do , you do . You were always in the front rank , and I was always behind . ”
38011	38030	37945	37945	Stryver	171	“ I had to get into the front rank ; I was not born there , was I ? ”
38031	38047	38049	38049	Carton	177	“ I was not present at the ceremony ; but my opinion is you were , ”
38063	38076	38078	38078	Carton	177	“ Before Shrewsbury , and at Shrewsbury , and ever since Shrewsbury , ”
38080	38142	38078	38078	Carton	177	“ you have fallen into your rank , and I have fallen into mine . Even when we were fellow - students in the Student - Quarter of Paris , picking up French , and French law , and other French crumbs that we did n’t get much good of , you were always somewhere , and I was always nowhere . ”
38143	38150	38049	38049	Carton	177	“ And whose fault was that ? ”
38151	38226	38078	38078	Carton	177	“ Upon my soul , I am not sure that it was not yours . You were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing , to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose . It ’s a gloomy thing , however , to talk about one ’s own past , with the day breaking . Turn me in some other direction before I go . ”
38227	38238	38240	38240	Stryver	171	“ Well then ! Pledge me to the pretty witness , ”
38247	38256	38240	38240	Stryver	171	“ Are you turned in a pleasant direction ? ”
38266	38270	38271	38271	he	171	“ Pretty witness , ”
38280	38301	38271	38271	he	171	“ I have had enough of witnesses to - day and to - night ; who ’s your pretty witness ? ”
38302	38312	38383	38384	Mr. Stryver	171	“ The picturesque doctor ’s daughter , Miss Manette . ”
38313	38319	38383	38384	Mr. Stryver	171	“ _ She _ pretty ? ”
38320	38325	38271	38271	he	171	“ Is she not ? ”
38326	38329	38383	38384	Mr. Stryver	171	“ No . ”
38330	38345	38383	38384	Mr. Stryver	171	“ Why , man alive , she was the admiration of the whole Court ! ”
38346	38373	38271	38271	he	171	“ Rot the admiration of the whole Court ! Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty ? She was a golden - haired doll ! ”
38374	38381	38383	38384	Mr. Stryver	171	“ Do you know , Sydney , ”
38403	38440	38383	38384	Mr. Stryver	171	“ do you know , I rather thought , at the time , that you sympathised with the golden - haired doll , and were quick to see what happened to the golden - haired doll ? ”
38441	38504	38383	38384	Mr. Stryver	171	“ Quick to see what happened ! If a girl , doll or no doll , swoons within a yard or two of a man ’s nose , he can see it without a perspective - glass . I pledge you , but I deny the beauty . And now I ’ll have no more drink ; I ’ll get to bed . ”
39594	39600	39574	39574	he	133	“ Doctor Manette at home ? ”
39604	39610	39574	39574	he	133	“ Miss Lucie at home ? ”
39614	39620	39658	39659	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Miss Pross at home ? ”
39648	39656	39658	39659	Mr. Lorry	133	“ As I am at home myself , ”
39661	39667	39658	39659	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I ’ll go upstairs . ”
40015	40019	40021	40022	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I wonder , ”
40030	40042	40021	40022	Mr. Lorry	133	“ that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him ! ”
40043	40050	40057	40057	him	133	“ And why wonder at that ? ”
40094	40099	40100	40101	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I should have thought-- ”
40104	40112	40114	40115	Miss Pross	183	“ Pooh ! You ’d have thought ! ”
40123	40129	40131	40132	that lady	1588	“ How do you do ? ”
40150	40160	40162	40163	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I am pretty well , I thank you , ”
40168	40173	40162	40163	Mr. Lorry	133	“ how are you ? ”
40174	40180	40182	40183	Miss Pross	183	“ Nothing to boast of , ”
40185	40188	40182	40183	Miss Pross	183	“ Indeed ? ”
40189	40194	40196	40197	Miss Pross	183	“ Ah ! indeed ! ”
40199	40210	40196	40197	Miss Pross	183	“ I am very much put out about my Ladybird . ”
40211	40214	40162	40163	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Indeed ? ”
40215	40235	40237	40238	Miss Pross	183	“ For gracious sake say something else besides ‘ indeed , ’ or you ’ll fidget me to death , ”
40250	40255	40257	40258	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Really , then ? ”
40264	40271	40273	40274	Miss Pross	183	“ Really , is bad enough , ”
40276	40289	40273	40274	Miss Pross	183	“ but better . Yes , I am very much put out . ”
40290	40297	40257	40258	Mr. Lorry	133	“ May I ask the cause ? ”
40298	40322	40324	40325	Miss Pross	183	“ I do n’t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird , to come here looking after her , ”
40327	40337	40324	40325	Miss Pross	183	“ _ Do _ dozens come for that purpose ? ”
40338	40341	40343	40344	Miss Pross	183	“ Hundreds , ”
40376	40380	40382	40383	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Dear me ! ”
40394	40458	40460	40461	Miss Pross	183	“ I have lived with the darling -- or the darling has lived with me , and paid me for it ; which she certainly should never have done , you may take your affidavit , if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her for nothing -- since she was ten years old . And it ’s really very hard , ”
40495	40517	40519	40520	Miss Pross	183	“ All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet , are always turning up , ”
40522	40527	40519	40520	Miss Pross	183	“ When you began it-- ”
40528	40538	40472	40473	Mr. Lorry	133	“ _ I _ began it , Miss Pross ? ”
40539	40551	40519	40520	Miss Pross	183	“ Did n’t you ? Who brought her father to life ? ”
40552	40562	40564	40565	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Oh ! If _ that _ was beginning it-- ”
40567	40672	40564	40565	Mr. Lorry	133	“ It was n’t ending it , I suppose ? I say , when you began it , it was hard enough ; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette , except that he is not worthy of such a daughter , which is no imputation on him , for it was not to be expected that anybody should be , under any circumstances . But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him ( I could have forgiven him ) , to take Ladybird ’s affections away from me . ”
40857	40873	40875	40876	Miss Pross	183	“ There never was , nor will be , but one man worthy of Ladybird , ”
40878	40896	40875	40876	Miss Pross	183	“ and that was my brother Solomon , if he had n’t made a mistake in life . ”
40992	41010	41011	41011	he	133	“ As we happen to be alone for the moment , and are both people of business , ”
41033	41057	41011	41011	he	133	“ let me ask you -- does the Doctor , in talking with Lucie , never refer to the shoemaking time , yet ? ”
41058	41061	41011	41011	he	133	“ Never . ”
41062	41074	41011	41011	he	133	“ And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him ? ”
41075	41078	41084	41084	her	183	“ Ah ! ”
41087	41102	41084	41084	her	183	“ But I do n’t say he do n’t refer to it within himself . ”
41103	41114	41011	41011	he	133	“ Do you believe that he thinks of it much ? ”
41115	41119	41121	41122	Miss Pross	183	“ I do , ”
41124	41128	41121	41122	Miss Pross	183	“ Do you imagine-- ”
41143	41154	41135	41136	Miss Pross	183	“ Never imagine anything . Have no imagination at all . ”
41155	41174	41191	41192	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I stand corrected ; do you suppose -- you go so far as to suppose , sometimes ? ”
41175	41180	41182	41183	Miss Pross	183	“ Now and then , ”
41185	41190	41182	41183	Miss Pross	183	“ Do you suppose , ”
41212	41249	41201	41201	his	133	“ that Doctor Manette has any theory of his own , preserved through all those years , relative to the cause of his being so oppressed ; perhaps , even to the name of his oppressor ? ”
41250	41264	41201	41201	his	133	“ I do n’t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me . ”
41265	41270	41201	41201	his	133	“ And that is-- ? ”
41271	41278	41201	41201	his	133	“ That she thinks he has . ”
41279	41310	41201	41201	his	133	“ Now do n’t be angry at my asking all these questions ; because I am a mere dull man of business , and you are a woman of business . ”
41311	41314	41315	41316	Miss Pross	183	“ Dull ? ”
41333	41448	41329	41330	Mr. Lorry	133	“ No , no , no . Surely not . To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor Manette , unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is , should never touch upon that question ? I will not say with me , though he had business relations with me many years ago , and we are now intimate ; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached , and who is so devotedly attached to him ? Believe me , Miss Pross , I do n’t approach the topic with you , out of curiosity , but out of zealous interest . ”
41449	41470	41472	41473	Miss Pross	183	“ Well ! To the best of my understanding , and bad ’s the best , you ’ll tell me , ”
41483	41492	41472	41473	Miss Pross	183	“ he is afraid of the whole subject . ”
41493	41496	41329	41330	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Afraid ? ”
41497	41567	41329	41330	Mr. Lorry	133	“ It ’s plain enough , I should think , why he may be . It ’s a dreadful remembrance . Besides that , his loss of himself grew out of it . Not knowing how he lost himself , or how he recovered himself , he may never feel certain of not losing himself again . That alone would n’t make the subject pleasant , I should think . ”
41580	41583	41585	41585	he	133	“ True , ”
41587	41645	41585	41585	he	133	“ and fearful to reflect upon . Yet , a doubt lurks in my mind , Miss Pross , whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up within him . Indeed , it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence . ”
41646	41652	41654	41655	Miss Pross	183	“ Ca n’t be helped , ”
41661	41836	41658	41658	her	183	“ Touch that string , and he instantly changes for the worse . Better leave it alone . In short , must leave it alone , like or no like . Sometimes , he gets up in the dead of the night , and will be heard , by us overhead there , walking up and down , walking up and down , in his room . Ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down , walking up and down , in his old prison . She hurries to him , and they go on together , walking up and down , walking up and down , until he is composed . But he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness , to her , and she finds it best not to hint at it to him . In silence they go walking up and down together , walking up and down together , till her love and company have brought him to himself . ”
41930	41935	41937	41938	Miss Pross	183	“ Here they are ! ”
41947	41959	41937	41938	Miss Pross	183	“ and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon ! ”
42805	42812	42797	42797	she	183	“ a fit of the jerks . ”
42890	42896	42898	42899	Mr. Darnay	162	“ Pray , Doctor Manette , ”
42932	42940	42911	42911	he	162	London--“have you seen much of the Tower ? ”
42941	42971	42911	42911	he	162	“ Lucie and I have been there ; but only casually . We have seen enough of it , to know that it teems with interest ; little more . ”
42972	42984	42986	42986	Darnay	162	“ _ I _ have been there , as you remember , ”
42998	43028	42986	42986	Darnay	162	“ in another character , and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it . They told me a curious thing when I was there . ”
43029	43034	43035	43035	Lucie	175	“ What was that ? ”
43038	43289	43035	43035	Lucie	175	“ In making some alterations , the workmen came upon an old dungeon , which had been , for many years , built up and forgotten . Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners -- dates , names , complaints , and prayers . Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall , one prisoner , who seemed to have gone to execution , had cut as his last work , three letters . They were done with some very poor instrument , and hurriedly , with an unsteady hand . At first , they were read as D. I. C. ; but , on being more carefully examined , the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials , and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been . At length , it was suggested that the letters were not initials , but the complete word , DIG . The floor was examined very carefully under the inscription , and , in the earth beneath a stone , or tile , or some fragment of paving , were found the ashes of a paper , mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag . What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read , but he had written something , and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler . ”
43290	43294	43296	43296	Lucie	175	“ My father , ”
43298	43303	43296	43296	Lucie	175	“ you are ill ! ”
43327	43356	43357	43357	He	162	“ No , my dear , not ill . There are large drops of rain falling , and they made me start . We had better go in . ”
43668	43684	43686	43687	Doctor Manette	170	“ The rain - drops are still falling , large , heavy , and few , ”
43689	43694	43686	43687	Doctor Manette	170	“ It comes slowly . ”
43695	43700	43702	43702	Carton	172	“ It comes surely , ”
43774	43785	43787	43787	Darnay	162	“ A multitude of people , and yet a solitude ! ”
43797	43806	43808	43808	Lucie	175	“ Is it not impressive , Mr. Darnay ? ”
43810	43848	43808	43808	Lucie	175	“ Sometimes , I have sat here of an evening , until I have fancied -- but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to - night , when all is so black and solemn-- ”
43849	43862	43956	43956	his	177	“ Let us shudder too . We may know what it is . ”
43863	43930	43956	43956	his	177	“ It will seem nothing to you . Such whims are only impressive as we originate them , I think ; they are not to be communicated . I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening , listening , until I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by - and - bye into our lives . ”
43931	43949	43956	43956	his	177	“ There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives , if that be so , ”
44035	44060	44198	44198	he	172	“ Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us , Miss Manette , or are we to divide them among us ? ”
44061	44122	44198	44198	he	172	“ I do n’t know , Mr. Darnay ; I told you it was a foolish fancy , but you asked for it . When I have yielded myself to it , I have been alone , and then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life , and my father ’s . ”
44123	44130	44132	44132	Carton	172	“ I take them into mine ! ”
44134	44168	44169	44169	He	172	“ _ I _ ask no questions and make no stipulations . There is a great crowd bearing down upon us , Miss Manette , and I see them -- by the Lightning . ”
44191	44197	44198	44198	he	172	“ And I hear them ! ”
44208	44220	44198	44198	he	172	“ Here they come , fast , fierce , and furious ! ”
44369	44383	44385	44386	Mr. Lorry	133	“ What a night it has been ! Almost a night , Jerry , ”
44388	44398	44385	44386	Mr. Lorry	133	“ to bring the dead out of their graves . ”
44399	44422	44424	44424	Jerry	133	“ I never see the night myself , master -- nor yet I do n’t expect to -- what would do that , ”
44426	44433	44435	44438	the man of business	1660	“ Good night , Mr. Carton , ”
44440	44458	44435	44438	the man of business	1660	“ Good night , Mr. Darnay . Shall we ever see such a night again , together ! ”
44974	44987	44955	44955	his	188	“ The earth and the fulness thereof are mine , saith Monseigneur . ”

47305	47319	47292	47296	a ragged and submissive man	1819	“ Why does he make that abominable noise ? Is it his child ? ”
47320	47335	47292	47296	a ragged and submissive man	1819	“ Excuse me , Monsieur the Marquis -- it is a pity -- yes . ”

47801	47810	47716	47718	the last comer	1835	“ Monsieur the Marquis , vendor of wine . ”
47811	47822	47824	47825	the Marquis	1836	“ Pick up that , philosopher and vendor of wine , ”
47833	47849	47824	47825	the Marquis	1836	“ and spend it as you will . The horses there ; are they right ? ”
47924	47927	47929	47931	Monsieur the Marquis	193	“ Hold ! ”
47933	47942	47943	47943	He	193	“ Hold the horses ! Who threw that ? ”
47995	47999	48001	48002	the Marquis	1836	“ You dogs ! ”
48022	48067	48001	48002	the Marquis	1836	“ I would ride over any of you very willingly , and exterminate you from the earth . If I knew which rascal threw at the carriage , and if that brigand were sufficiently near it , he should be crushed under the wheels . ”
48176	48180	48164	48164	he	1836	“ Go on ! ”
48598	48604	48606	48608	Monsieur the Marquis	193	“ It will die out , ”
48615	48618	48606	48608	Monsieur the Marquis	193	“ directly . ”
49179	49186	49188	49189	the Marquis	1836	“ Bring me hither that fellow ! ”
49225	49233	49218	49223	the people at the Paris fountain	1931	“ I passed you on the road ? ”
49234	49252	49188	49189	the Marquis	1836	“ Monseigneur , it is true . I had the honour of being passed on the road . ”
49253	49269	49218	49223	the people at the Paris fountain	1931	“ Coming up the hill , and at the top of the hill , both ? ”
49270	49277	49218	49223	the people at the Paris fountain	1931	“ Monseigneur , it is true . ”
49278	49288	49188	49189	the Marquis	1836	“ What did you look at , so fixedly ? ”
49289	49298	49299	49299	He	748	“ Monseigneur , I looked at the man . ”
49325	49336	49315	49317	All his fellows	1934	“ What man , pig ? And why look there ? ”
49337	49354	49188	49189	the Marquis	1836	“ Pardon , Monseigneur ; he swung by the chain of the shoe -- the drag . ”
49355	49358	49360	49361	the traveller	1936	“ Who ? ”
49363	49369	49360	49361	the traveller	1936	“ Monseigneur , the man . ”
49370	49402	49188	49189	the Marquis	1836	“ May the Devil carry away these idiots ! How do you call the man ? You know all the men of this part of the country . Who was he ? ”
49403	49432	49188	49189	the Marquis	1836	“ Your clemency , Monseigneur ! He was not of this part of the country . Of all the days of my life , I never saw him . ”
49433	49443	49360	49361	the traveller	1936	“ Swinging by the chain ? To be suffocated ? ”
49444	49467	49468	49468	He	1937	“ With your gracious permission , that was the wonder of it , Monseigneur . His head hanging over -- like this ! ”
49509	49515	49497	49497	himself	1937	“ What was he like ? ”
49516	49541	49549	49551	the little crowd	1939	“ Monseigneur , he was whiter than the miller . All covered with dust , white as a spectre , tall as a spectre ! ”
49583	49590	49592	49593	the Marquis	1836	“ Truly , you did well , ”
49606	49633	49592	49593	the Marquis	1836	“ to see a thief accompanying my carriage , and not open that great mouth of yours . Bah ! Put him aside , Monsieur Gabelle ! ”
49676	49682	49684	49685	Monsieur Gabelle	195	“ Bah ! Go aside ! ”
49687	49716	49684	49685	Monsieur Gabelle	195	“ Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to - night , and be sure that his business is honest , Gabelle . ”
49717	49730	49751	49756	some half - dozen particular friends	1946	“ Monseigneur , I am flattered to devote myself to your orders . ”
49731	49742	49743	49744	The accursed	1944	“ Did he run away , fellow?--where is that Accursed ? ”
49788	49804	49784	49786	Monsieur the Marquis	193	“ Did the man run away , Dolt , when we stopped for the drag ? ”
49805	49828	49767	49773	Some half - dozen other particular friends	1947	“ Monseigneur , he precipitated himself over the hill - side , head first , as a person plunges into the river . ”
49829	49839	49784	49786	Monsieur the Marquis	193	“ See to it , Gabelle . Go on ! ”
50109	50121	50130	50130	his	1958	“ It is you , Monseigneur ! Monseigneur , a petition . ”
50138	50150	50134	50134	Monseigneur	188	“ How , then ! What is it ? Always petitions ! ”
50151	50168	50130	50130	his	1958	“ Monseigneur . For the love of the great God ! My husband , the forester . ”
50169	50191	50134	50134	Monseigneur	188	“ What of your husband , the forester ? Always the same with you people . He can not pay something ? ”
50192	50204	50134	50134	Monseigneur	188	“ He has paid all , Monseigneur . He is dead . ”
50205	50219	50130	50130	his	1958	“ Well ! He is quiet . Can I restore him to you ? ”
50220	50240	50134	50134	Monseigneur	188	“ Alas , no , Monseigneur ! But he lies yonder , under a little heap of poor grass . ”
50241	50244	50134	50134	Monseigneur	188	“ Well ? ”
50245	50258	50130	50130	his	1958	“ Monseigneur , there are so many little heaps of poor grass ? ”
50259	50264	50265	50265	She	1961	“ Again , well ? ”
50331	50363	50285	50285	she	1961	“ Monseigneur , hear me ! Monseigneur , hear my petition ! My husband died of want ; so many die of want ; so many more will die of want . ”
50364	50374	50285	50285	she	1961	“ Again , well ? Can I feed them ? ”
50375	50476	50477	50478	The valet	1829	“ Monseigneur , the good God knows ; but I do n’t ask it . My petition is , that a morsel of stone or wood , with my husband ’s name , may be placed over him to show where he lies . Otherwise , the place will be quickly forgotten , it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady , I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass . Monseigneur , they are so many , they increase so fast , there is so much want . Monseigneur ! Monseigneur ! ”
50720	50734	50745	50746	The Gorgon	199	“ Monsieur Charles , whom I expect ; is he arrived from England ? ”
50735	50741	50745	50746	The Gorgon	199	“ Monseigneur , not yet . ”
51274	51278	51280	51281	the Marquis	1836	“ My nephew , ”
51289	51297	51280	51281	the Marquis	1836	“ they said he was not arrived . ”
51311	51345	51309	51309	Monseigneur	188	“ Ah ! It is not probable he will arrive to - night ; nevertheless , leave the table as it is . I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour . ”
51399	51404	51405	51405	he	188	“ What is that ? ”
51422	51427	51405	51405	he	188	“ Monseigneur ? That ? ”
51428	51437	51490	51490	him	2012	“ Outside the blinds . Open the blinds . ”
51442	51445	51490	51490	him	2012	“ Well ? ”
51446	51464	51465	51468	The servant who spoke	2012	“ Monseigneur , it is nothing . The trees and the night are all that are here . ”
51497	51500	51502	51504	the imperturbable master	2013	“ Good , ”
51506	51511	51502	51504	the imperturbable master	2013	“ Close them again . ”
51565	51571	51550	51550	It	2015	“ Ask who is arrived . ”
51690	51698	51699	51699	he	2017	“ You left Paris yesterday , sir ? ”
51712	51718	51699	51699	he	2017	“ Yesterday . And you ? ”
51719	51724	51699	51699	he	2017	“ I come direct . ”
51725	51729	51699	51699	he	2017	“ From London ? ”
51730	51733	51699	51699	he	2017	“ Yes . ”
51734	51743	51745	51746	the Marquis	1836	“ You have been a long time coming , ”
51752	51761	51745	51746	the Marquis	1836	“ On the contrary ; I come direct . ”
51762	51784	51699	51699	he	2017	“ Pardon me ! I mean , not a long time on the journey ; a long time intending the journey . ”
51785	51790	51745	51746	the Marquis	1836	“ I have been detained by”--the
51797	51800	51699	51699	he	2017	answer--“various business . ”
51801	51805	51807	51809	the polished uncle	2022	“ Without doubt , ”
51862	51914	51922	51923	the uncle	2026	“ I have come back , sir , as you anticipate , pursuing the object that took me away . It carried me into great and unexpected peril ; but it is a sacred object , and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me . ”
51915	51920	51922	51923	the uncle	2026	“ Not to death , ”
51925	51936	51922	51923	the uncle	2026	“ it is not necessary to say , to death . ”
51937	51943	51945	51946	the nephew	2025	“ I doubt , sir , ”
51948	51972	51945	51946	the nephew	2025	“ whether , if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death , you would have cared to stop me there . ”
52024	52029	52031	52032	the nephew	2025	“ Indeed , sir , ”
52034	52059	52031	52032	the nephew	2025	“ for anything I know , you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me . ”
52060	52067	52069	52070	the uncle	2026	“ No , no , no , ”
52074	52082	52084	52085	the nephew	2025	“ But , however that may be , ”
52094	52116	52084	52085	the nephew	2025	“ I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means , and would know no scruple as to means . ”
52117	52126	52128	52129	the uncle	2026	“ My friend , I told you so , ”
52140	52156	52128	52129	the uncle	2026	“ Do me the favour to recall that I told you so , long ago . ”
52157	52162	52084	52085	the nephew	2025	“ I recall it . ”
52163	52167	52169	52170	the Marquis	1836	“ Thank you , ”
52192	52198	52200	52201	the nephew	2025	“ In effect , sir , ”
52203	52232	52200	52201	the nephew	2025	“ I believe it to be at once your bad fortune , and my good fortune , that has kept me out of a prison in France here . ”
52233	52240	52242	52243	the uncle	2026	“ I do not quite understand , ”
52249	52257	52242	52243	the uncle	2026	“ Dare I ask you to explain ? ”
52258	52297	52200	52201	the nephew	2025	“ I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court , and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past , a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely . ”
52298	52303	52305	52306	the uncle	2026	“ It is possible , ”
52312	52335	52305	52306	the uncle	2026	“ For the honour of the family , I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent . Pray excuse me ! ”
52336	52361	52363	52364	the nephew	2025	“ I perceive that , happily for me , the Reception of the day before yesterday was , as usual , a cold one , ”
52366	52376	52378	52379	the uncle	2026	“ I would not say happily , my friend , ”
52385	52632	52378	52379	the uncle	2026	“ I would not be sure of that . A good opportunity for consideration , surrounded by the advantages of solitude , might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself . But it is useless to discuss the question . I am , as you say , at a disadvantage . These little instruments of correction , these gentle aids to the power and honour of families , these slight favours that might so incommode you , are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity . They are sought by so many , and they are granted ( comparatively ) to so few ! It used not to be so , but France in all such things is changed for the worse . Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar . From this room , many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged ; in the next room ( my bedroom ) , one fellow , to our knowledge , was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his _ daughter ? We have lost many privileges ; a new philosophy has become the mode ; and the assertion of our station , in these days , might ( I do not go so far as to say would , but might ) cause us real inconvenience . All very bad , very bad ! ”
52669	52689	52691	52692	the nephew	2025	“ We have so asserted our station , both in the old time and in the modern time also , ”
52696	52712	52691	52692	the nephew	2025	“ that I believe our name to be more detested than any name in France . ”
52713	52719	52721	52722	the uncle	2026	“ Let us hope so , ”
52724	52737	52721	52722	the uncle	2026	“ Detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low . ”
52738	52743	52745	52746	the nephew	2025	“ There is not , ”
52753	52787	52745	52746	the nephew	2025	“ a face I can look at , in all this country round about us , which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery . ”
52788	52792	52794	52795	the Marquis	1836	“ A compliment , ”
52797	52820	52794	52795	the Marquis	1836	“ to the grandeur of the family , merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur . Hah ! ”
52890	52909	52911	52912	the Marquis	1836	“ Repression is the only lasting philosophy . The dark deference of fear and slavery , my friend , ”
52914	52930	52911	52912	the Marquis	1836	“ will keep the dogs obedient to the whip , as long as this roof , ”
52936	52942	52911	52912	the Marquis	1836	“ shuts out the sky . ”
53073	53076	53078	53079	the Marquis	1836	“ Meanwhile , ”
53081	53113	53078	53079	the Marquis	1836	“ I will preserve the honour and repose of the family , if you will not . But you must be fatigued . Shall we terminate our conference for the night ? ”
53114	53119	53078	53079	the Marquis	1836	“ A moment more . ”
53120	53128	53078	53079	the Marquis	1836	“ An hour , if you please . ”
53129	53132	53134	53135	the nephew	2025	“ Sir , ”
53137	53151	53134	53135	the nephew	2025	“ we have done wrong , and are reaping the fruits of wrong . ”
53152	53160	53162	53163	the Marquis	1836	“ _ We _ have done wrong ? ”
53183	53274	53181	53181	himself	1836	“ Our family ; our honourable family , whose honour is of so much account to both of us , in such different ways . Even in my father ’s time , we did a world of wrong , injuring every human creature who came between us and our pleasure , whatever it was . Why need I speak of my father ’s time , when it is equally yours ? Can I separate my father ’s twin - brother , joint inheritor , and next successor , from himself ? ”
53275	53281	53283	53284	the Marquis	1836	“ Death has done that ! ”
53286	53292	53294	53295	the nephew	2025	“ And has left me , ”
53297	53362	53294	53295	the nephew	2025	“ bound to a system that is frightful to me , responsible for it , but powerless in it ; seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother ’s lips , and obey the last look of my dear mother ’s eyes , which implored me to have mercy and to redress ; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain . ”
53363	53372	53374	53375	the Marquis	1836	“ Seeking them from me , my nephew , ”
53392	53404	53294	53295	the nephew	2025	hearth--“you will for ever seek them in vain , be assured . ”
53483	53500	53473	53473	he	1836	“ My friend , I will die , perpetuating the system under which I have lived . ”
53523	53531	53532	53532	he	1836	“ Better to be a rational creature , ”
53545	53563	53532	53532	he	1836	“ and accept your natural destiny . But you are lost , Monsieur Charles , I see . ”
53564	53574	53576	53577	the nephew	2025	“ This property and France are lost to me , ”
53581	53586	53576	53577	the nephew	2025	“ I renounce them . ”
53587	53616	53532	53532	he	1836	“ Are they both yours to renounce ? France may be , but is the property ? It is scarcely worth mentioning ; but , is it yet ? ”
53617	53645	53532	53532	he	1836	“ I had no intention , in the words I used , to claim it yet . If it passed to me from you , to - morrow-- ”
53646	53658	53576	53577	the nephew	2025	“ Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable . ”
53659	53664	53532	53532	he	1836	“ --or twenty years hence-- ”
53665	53673	53675	53676	the Marquis	1836	“ You do me too much honour , ”
53678	53686	53675	53676	the Marquis	1836	“ still , I prefer that supposition . ”
53687	53716	53532	53532	he	1836	“ --I would abandon it , and live otherwise and elsewhere . It is little to relinquish . What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin ! ”
53717	53720	53722	53723	the Marquis	1836	“ Hah ! ”
53731	53782	53722	53723	the Marquis	1836	“ To the eye it is fair enough , here ; but seen in its integrity , under the sky , and by the daylight , it is a crumbling tower of waste , mismanagement , extortion , debt , mortgage , oppression , hunger , nakedness , and suffering . ”
53783	53786	53788	53789	the Marquis	1836	“ Hah ! ”
53799	53887	53788	53789	the Marquis	1836	“ If it ever becomes mine , it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly ( if such a thing is possible ) from the weight that drags it down , so that the miserable people who can not leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance , may , in another generation , suffer less ; but it is not for me . There is a curse on it , and on all this land . ”
53888	53892	53894	53895	the uncle	2026	“ And you ? ”
53897	53915	53894	53895	the uncle	2026	“ Forgive my curiosity ; do you , under your new philosophy , graciously intend to live ? ”
53916	53946	53788	53789	the Marquis	1836	“ I must do , to live , what others of my countrymen , even with nobility at their backs , may have to do some day -- work . ”
53947	53954	53788	53789	the Marquis	1836	“ In England , for example ? ”
53955	53991	53788	53789	the Marquis	1836	“ Yes . The family honour , sir , is safe from me in this country . The family name can suffer from me in no other , for I bear it in no other . ”
54035	54051	54052	54052	he	1836	“ England is very attractive to you , seeing how indifferently you have prospered there , ”
54067	54100	54052	54052	he	1836	“ I have already said , that for my prospering there , I am sensible I may be indebted to you , sir . For the rest , it is my Refuge . ”
54101	54131	54052	54052	he	1836	“ They say , those boastful English , that it is the Refuge of many . You know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there ? A Doctor ? ”
54132	54135	54184	54184	he	1836	“ Yes . ”

54142	54145	54052	54052	he	1836	“ Yes . ”
54146	54149	54151	54152	the Marquis	1836	“ Yes , ”
54154	54162	54151	54152	the Marquis	1836	“ You are fatigued . Good night ! ”
54243	54246	54248	54249	the Marquis	1836	“ Yes , ”
54251	54273	54248	54249	the Marquis	1836	“ A Doctor with a daughter . Yes . So commences the new philosophy ! You are fatigued . Good night ! ”
54314	54318	54320	54321	the uncle	2026	“ Good night ! ”
54323	54360	54361	54361	he	1836	“ I look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning . Good repose ! Light Monsieur my nephew to his chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed , if you will , ”
54583	54586	54577	54577	his	1822	“ Dead ! ”
54587	54593	54595	54595	Monsieur	2094	“ I am cool now , ”
54599	54606	54595	54595	Monsieur	2094	“ and may go to bed . ”
55811	55824	55844	55846	Mr. Charles Darnay	162	“ Drive him fast to his tomb . This , from Jacques . ”
56600	56645	56589	56589	he	162	“ Charles Darnay ! I rejoice to see you . We have been counting on your return these three or four days past . Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday , and both made you out to be more than due . ”
56646	56659	56660	56660	he	162	“ I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter , ”
56678	56681	56660	56660	he	162	“ Miss Manette-- ”
56682	56686	56688	56689	the Doctor	1514	“ Is well , ”
56696	56720	56688	56689	the Doctor	1514	“ and your return will delight us all . She has gone out on some household matters , but will soon be home . ”
56721	56749	56660	56660	he	162	“ Doctor Manette , I knew she was from home . I took the opportunity of her being from home , to beg to speak to you . ”
56756	56759	56761	56762	the Doctor	1514	“ Yes ? ”
56768	56778	56779	56779	He	162	“ Bring your chair here , and speak on . ”
56796	56812	56814	56814	he	162	“ I have had the happiness , Doctor Manette , of being so intimate here , ”
56819	56841	56814	56814	he	162	“ for some year and a half , that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may not-- ”
56874	56880	56867	56867	he	162	“ Is Lucie the topic ? ”
56881	56885	56867	56867	he	162	“ She is . ”
56886	56920	56951	56952	her father	5008	“ It is hard for me to speak of her at any time . It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours , Charles Darnay . ”
56921	56940	56941	56941	he	162	“ It is a tone of fervent admiration , true homage , and deep love , Doctor Manette ! ”
56955	56969	56970	56970	His	5008	“ I believe it . I do you justice ; I believe it . ”
57000	57008	56951	56952	her father	5008	“ Shall I go on , sir ? ”
57012	57018	56951	56952	her father	5008	“ Yes , go on . ”
57019	57107	57108	57109	The Doctor	1514	“ You anticipate what I would say , though you can not know how earnestly I say it , how earnestly I feel it , without knowing my secret heart , and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden . Dear Doctor Manette , I love your daughter fondly , dearly , disinterestedly , devotedly . If ever there were love in the world , I love her . You have loved yourself ; let your old love speak for me ! ”
57142	57161	57130	57130	he	1514	“ Not that , sir ! Let that be ! I adjure you , do not recall that ! ”
57218	57224	57226	57227	the Doctor	1514	“ I ask your pardon , ”
57238	57254	57226	57227	the Doctor	1514	“ I do not doubt your loving Lucie ; you may be satisfied of it . ”
57290	57297	57275	57275	His	1514	“ Have you spoken to Lucie ? ”
57298	57301	57275	57275	His	1514	“ No . ”
57302	57306	57275	57275	His	1514	“ Nor written ? ”
57307	57310	57275	57275	His	1514	“ Never . ”
57311	57342	57343	57343	He	1514	“ It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self - denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father . Her father thanks you . ”
57357	57361	57363	57363	Darnay	162	“ I know , ”
57367	57669	57363	57363	Darnay	162	“ how can I fail to know , Doctor Manette , I who have seen you together from day to day , that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual , so touching , so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured , that it can have few parallels , even in the tenderness between a father and child . I know , Doctor Manette -- how can I fail to know -- that , mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman , there is , in her heart , towards you , all the love and reliance of infancy itself . I know that , as in her childhood she had no parent , so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character , united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her . I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life , you could hardly be invested , in her sight , with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her . I know that when she is clinging to you , the hands of baby , girl , and woman , all in one , are round your neck . I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age , sees and loves you at my age , loves her mother broken - hearted , loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration . I have known this , night and day , since I have known you in your home . ”
57697	57789	57689	57689	he	5008	“ Dear Doctor Manette , always knowing this , always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you , I have forborne , and forborne , as long as it was in the nature of man to do it . I have felt , and do even now feel , that to bring my love -- even mine -- between you , is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself . But I love her . Heaven is my witness that I love her ! ”
57790	57795	57797	57798	her father	5008	“ I believe it , ”
57802	57814	57797	57798	her father	5008	“ I have thought so before now . I believe it . ”
57815	57822	57824	57824	Darnay	162	“ But , do not believe , ”
57838	57955	57956	57956	He	5008	“ that if my fortune were so cast as that , being one day so happy as to make her my wife , I must at any time put any separation between her and you , I could or would breathe a word of what I now say . Besides that I should know it to be hopeless , I should know it to be a baseness . If I had any such possibility , even at a remote distance of years , harboured in my thoughts , and hidden in my heart -- if it ever had been there -- if it ever could be there -- I could not now touch this honoured hand . ”
57966	58079	57958	57958	his	5008	“ No , dear Doctor Manette . Like you , a voluntary exile from France ; like you , driven from it by its distractions , oppressions , and miseries ; like you , striving to live away from it by my own exertions , and trusting in a happier future ; I look only to sharing your fortunes , sharing your life and home , and being faithful to you to the death . Not to divide with Lucie her privilege as your child , companion , and friend ; but to come in aid of it , and bind her closer to you , if such a thing can be . ”
58153	58196	58555	58555	her	2205	“ You speak so feelingly and so manfully , Charles Darnay , that I thank you with all my heart , and will open all my heart -- or nearly so . Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you ? ”
58197	58205	58555	58555	her	2205	“ None . As yet , none . ”
58206	58228	58555	58555	her	2205	“ Is it the immediate object of this confidence , that you may at once ascertain that , with my knowledge ? ”
58229	58261	58555	58555	her	2205	“ Not even so . I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks ; I might ( mistaken or not mistaken ) have that hopefulness to - morrow . ”
58262	58271	58555	58555	her	2205	“ Do you seek any guidance from me ? ”
58272	58306	58555	58555	her	2205	“ I ask none , sir . But I have thought it possible that you might have it in your power , if you should deem it right , to give me some . ”
58307	58316	58555	58555	her	2205	“ Do you seek any promise from me ? ”
58317	58323	58555	58555	her	2205	“ I do seek that . ”
58324	58329	58555	58555	her	2205	“ What is it ? ”
58330	58390	58555	58555	her	2205	“ I well understand that , without you , I could have no hope . I well understand that , even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart -- do not think I have the presumption to assume so much -- I could retain no place in it against her love for her father . ”
58391	58412	58555	58555	her	2205	“ If that be so , do you see what , on the other hand , is involved in it ? ”
58413	58446	58448	58448	Darnay	162	“ I understand equally well , that a word from her father in any suitor ’s favour , would outweigh herself and all the world . For which reason , Doctor Manette , ”
58454	58467	58448	58448	Darnay	162	“ I would not ask that word , to save my life . ”
58468	58537	58555	58555	her	2205	“ I am sure of it . Charles Darnay , mysteries arise out of close love , as well as out of wide division ; in the former case , they are subtle and delicate , and difficult to penetrate . My daughter Lucie is , in this one respect , such a mystery to me ; I can make no guess at the state of her heart . ”
58538	58550	58448	58448	Darnay	162	“ May I ask , sir , if you think she is-- ”
58561	58569	58555	58556	her father	5008	“ Is sought by any other suitor ? ”
58570	58579	58580	58581	Her father	5008	“ It is what I meant to say . ”
58589	58622	58586	58586	he	5008	“ You have seen Mr. Carton here , yourself . Mr. Stryver is here too , occasionally . If it be at all , it can only be by one of these . ”
58623	58627	58629	58629	Darnay	162	“ Or both , ”
58631	58660	58629	58629	Darnay	162	“ I had not thought of both ; I should not think either , likely . You want a promise from me . Tell me what it is . ”
58661	58771	58555	58556	her father	5008	“ It is , that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time , on her own part , such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you , you will bear testimony to what I have said , and to your belief in it . I hope you may be able to think so well of me , as to urge no influence against me . I say nothing more of my stake in this ; this is what I ask . The condition on which I ask it , and which you have an undoubted right to require , I will observe immediately . ”
58772	58778	58780	58781	the Doctor	1514	“ I give the promise , ”
58783	58862	58780	58781	the Doctor	1514	“ without any condition . I believe your object to be , purely and truthfully , as you have stated it . I believe your intention is to perpetuate , and not to weaken , the ties between me and my other and far dearer self . If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness , I will give her to you . If there were -- Charles Darnay , if there were-- ”
58881	58953	58877	58878	the Doctor	1514	“ --any fancies , any reasons , any apprehensions , anything whatsoever , new or old , against the man she really loved -- the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head -- they should all be obliterated for her sake . She is everything to me ; more to me than suffering , more to me than wrong , more to me -- Well ! This is idle talk . ”
58997	59004	59006	59007	Doctor Manette	170	“ You said something to me , ”
59014	59023	59006	59007	Doctor Manette	170	“ What was it you said to me ? ”
59053	59109	59050	59050	he	162	“ Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part . My present name , though but slightly changed from my mother ’s , is not , as you will remember , my own . I wish to tell you what that is , and why I am in England . ”
59110	59113	59115	59118	the Doctor of Beauvais	4994	“ Stop ! ”
59120	59141	59115	59118	the Doctor of Beauvais	4994	“ I wish it , that I may the better deserve your confidence , and have no secret from you . ”
59142	59145	59150	59151	the Doctor	1514	“ Stop ! ”
59176	59212	59167	59167	his	1514	“ Tell me when I ask you , not now . If your suit should prosper , if Lucie should love you , you shall tell me on your marriage morning . Do you promise ? ”
59213	59216	59219	59219	your	162	“ Willingly . “
59248	59299	59246	59246	you	162	” It was dark when Charles Darnay left him , and it was an hour later and darker when Lucie came home ; she hurried into the room alone -- for Miss Pross had gone straight up - stairs -- and was surprised to find his reading - chair empty . “
59303	59309	59310	59310	Father	202	” she called to him . “
59313	59360	59310	59310	Father	202	” Nothing was said in answer , but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom . Passing lightly across the intermediate room , she looked in at his door and came running back frightened , crying to herself , with her blood all chilled , “
59371	59470	59368	59368	I	0	” Her uncertainty lasted but a moment ; she hurried back , and tapped at his door , and softly called to him . The noise ceased at the sound of her voice , and he presently came out to her , and they walked up and down together for a long time . She came down from her bed , to look at him in his sleep that night . He slept heavily , and his tray of shoemaking tools , and his old unfinished work , were all as usual . CHAPTER XI . A Companion Picture “
59473	59492	59368	59368	I	0	” said Mr. Stryver , on that self - same night , or morning , to his jackal ; “
59507	59673	59499	59499	I	0	” Sydney had been working double tides that night , and the night before , and the night before that , and a good many nights in succession , making a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver ’s papers before the setting in of the long vacation . The clearance was effected at last ; the Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up ; everything was got rid of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric , and fogs legal , and bring grist to the mill again . Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application . It had taken a deal of extra wet - towelling to pull him through the night ; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling ; and he was in a very damaged condition , as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours . “
59683	59708	59709	59709	I	0	” said Stryver the portly , with his hands in his waistband , glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back . “

60431	60445	60423	60423	You	0	” was his friend ’s answer , delivered in no very soothing tone . “
60461	60466	60457	60457	I	0	” said Sydney Carton . “

The Fellow of Delicacy Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the Doctor ’s daughter , resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the Long Vacation . After some mental debating of the point , he came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with , and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two before Michaelmas Term , or in the little Christmas vacation between it and Hilary . As to the strength of his case , he had not a doubt about it , but clearly saw his way to the verdict . Argued with the jury on substantial worldly grounds -- the only grounds ever worth taking into account -- it was a plain case , and had not a weak spot in it . He called himself for the plaintiff , there was no getting over his evidence , the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief , and the jury did not even turn to consider . After trying it , Stryver , C. J. , was satisfied that no plainer case could be . Accordingly , Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens ; that failing , to Ranelagh ; that unaccountably failing too , it behoved him to present himself in Soho , and there declare his noble mind . Towards Soho , therefore , Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple , while the bloom of the Long Vacation ’s infancy was still upon it . Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet on Saint Dunstan ’s side of Temple Bar , bursting in his full - blown way along the pavement , to the jostlement of all weaker people , might have seen how safe and strong he was . His way taking him past Tellson ’s , and he both banking at Tellson ’s and knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes , it entered Mr. Stryver ’s mind to enter the bank , and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness of the Soho horizon . So , he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat , stumbled down the two steps , got past the two ancient cashiers , and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr. Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures , with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too , and everything under the clouds were a sum . “
61734	61739	61257	61257	I	0	” said Mr. Stryver . “
61751	61855	61745	61745	I	0	” It was Stryver ’s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place , or space . He was so much too big for Tellson ’s , that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance , as though he squeezed them against the wall . The House itself , magnificently reading the paper quite in the far - off perspective , lowered displeased , as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat . The discreet Mr. Lorry said , in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances , “
61871	61927	61866	61866	you	2256	” and shook hands . There was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands , always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson ’s who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air . He shook in a self - abnegating way , as one who shook for Tellson and Co. “
61938	61948	61935	61936	Mr. Stryver	171	” asked Mr. Lorry , in his business character . “
61975	61976	61967	61967	I	0	” “
61980	62000	61967	61967	I	0	” said Mr. Lorry , bending down his ear , while his eye strayed to the House afar off . “
62005	62039	62001	62001	I	0	” said Mr. Stryver , leaning his arms confidentially on the desk : whereupon , although it was a large double one , there appeared to be not half desk enough for him : “
62063	62064	62060	62061	Mr. Lorry	133	” “
62069	62085	62060	62061	Mr. Lorry	133	” cried Mr. Lorry , rubbing his chin , and looking at his visitor dubiously . “
62092	62099	62090	62090	sir	4862	” repeated Stryver , drawing back . “
62115	62116	62112	62113	Mr. Lorry	133	” “
62120	62127	62117	62117	My	0	” answered the man of business , “
62168	62197	62198	62198	you	4862	” Mr. Lorry paused , and shook his head at him in the oddest manner , as if he were compelled against his will to add , internally , “
62210	62211	62198	62198	you	4862	” “
62214	62237	62198	62198	you	4862	” said Stryver , slapping the desk with his contentious hand , opening his eyes wider , and taking a long breath , “
62251	62276	62243	62244	Mr. Lorry	133	” Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end , and bit the feather of a pen . “
62285	62293	62243	62244	Mr. Lorry	133	” said Stryver , staring at him , “
62299	62300	62243	62244	Mr. Lorry	133	” “
62314	62319	62310	62310	you	4862	” said Mr. Lorry . “
62329	62330	62310	62310	you	4862	” “
62336	62340	62310	62310	you	4862	” asked Stryver . “
62353	62358	62349	62349	you	4862	” said Mr. Lorry . “
62362	62363	62365	62365	you	4862	” “
62372	62386	62369	62369	you	4862	” said Mr. Lorry , delighted to be able to make another admission , “
62392	62393	62365	62365	you	4862	” “
62405	62412	62402	62403	Mr. Lorry	133	” demanded Stryver , perceptibly crestfallen . “
62423	62428	62418	62418	you	4862	” asked Mr. Lorry . “
62431	62445	62418	62418	you	4862	” said Stryver , with a plump of his fist on the desk . “
62458	62459	62456	62456	you	4862	” “
62462	62466	62456	62456	you	4862	” said Stryver . “
62477	62485	62469	62469	I	0	” forensically shaking a forefinger at him . “
62509	62510	62506	62506	you	4862	” “
62513	62518	62519	62519	I	0	” said Mr. Lorry , “
62538	62539	62544	62544	me	0	” “
62547	62551	62544	62544	me	0	” cried Stryver , “
62557	62573	62576	62579	a man of business	4935	” Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House , and glanced at the angry Stryver . “
62594	62598	62610	62610	he	4935	” said Stryver ; “
62626	62652	62622	62622	his	4935	” Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off . “
62705	62716	62717	62719	the young lady	642	” said Mr. Lorry , mildly tapping the Stryver arm , “
62728	62729	62721	62723	The young lady	642	” “
62740	62748	62731	62731	you	2271	” said Stryver , squaring his elbows , “
62768	62769	62764	62766	a mincing Fool	2275	” “
62783	62790	62774	62774	I	0	” said Mr. Lorry , reddening , “
62866	62921	62853	62853	Tellson	134	” The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver ’s blood - vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry ; Mr. Lorry ’s veins , methodical as their courses could usually be , were in no better state now it was his turn . “
62933	62938	62925	62925	I	0	” said Mr. Lorry . “
62948	62990	62925	62925	I	0	” Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while , and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it , which probably gave him the toothache . He broke the awkward silence by saying : “
63023	63024	63001	63001	You	133	” “
63036	63037	63026	63026	you	133	” “
63043	63044	63040	63040	I	0	” “
63060	63061	63054	63054	you	133	” “
63071	63079	63064	63064	I	0	” laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh , “
63095	63096	63064	63064	I	0	” “
63101	63106	63099	63099	me	0	” pursued Mr. Lorry . “
63202	63203	63205	63205	I	0	” “
63207	63213	63205	63205	I	0	” said Stryver , whistling . “
63266	63267	63258	63258	you	133	” “
63288	63297	63286	63286	sir	4862	” said Mr. Lorry , quickly flushing again , “
63317	63318	63313	63314	any gentleman	2290	” “
63326	63330	63323	63323	your	133	” said Stryver . “
63505	63506	63502	63502	you	171	” “
63516	63517	63510	63510	you	171	” “

63553	63557	63549	63549	I	0	” said Stryver : “
63597	63737	63583	63583	I	0	” Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank , causing such a concussion of air on his passage through , that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters , required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks . Those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing , and were popularly believed , when they had bowed a customer out , still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in . The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty . Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow , he got it down . “
63741	63761	63583	63583	I	0	” said Mr. Stryver , shaking his forensic forefinger at the Temple in general , when it was down , “
63778	63799	63800	63800	You	2294	” It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician , in which he found great relief . “
63812	63817	63800	63800	You	2294	” said Mr. Stryver ; “
63825	63891	63818	63818	I	0	” Accordingly , when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o’clock , Mr. Stryver , among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the purpose , seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning . He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry , and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state . “
63894	63919	63818	63818	I	0	” said that good - natured emissary , after a full half - hour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the question . “
63926	63927	63920	63920	I	0	” “
63931	63938	63920	63920	I	0	” repeated Mr. Stryver , coldly . “
63951	63952	63947	63947	I	0	” “
63959	63964	63947	63947	I	0	” said Mr. Lorry , “
63986	63987	63981	63981	I	0	” “
63992	64002	64004	64004	I	0	” returned Mr. Stryver , in the friendliest way , “
64045	64046	64047	64047	I	0	” “
64053	64058	64047	64047	I	0	” said Mr. Lorry . “
64064	64078	64059	64059	I	0	” rejoined Stryver , nodding his head in a smoothing and final way ; “
64085	64086	64059	64059	I	0	” “
64092	64097	64059	64059	I	0	” Mr. Lorry urged . “
64393	64432	64383	64383	you	0	” Mr. Lorry was so taken aback , that he looked quite stupidly at Mr. Stryver shouldering him towards the door , with an appearance of showering generosity , forbearance , and goodwill , on his erring head . “
64443	64447	64455	64455	you	4862	” said Stryver ; “
64467	64749	64750	64750	he	2307	” Mr. Lorry was out in the night , before he knew where he was . Mr. Stryver was lying back on his sofa , winking at his ceiling . CHAPTER XIII . The Fellow of No Delicacy If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere , he certainly never shone in the house of Doctor Manette . He had been there often , during a whole year , and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there . When he cared to talk , he talked well ; but , the cloud of caring for nothing , which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness , was very rarely pierced by the light within him . And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house , and for the senseless stones that made their pavements . Many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there , when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him ; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there , and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief , removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings , as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things , else forgotten and unattainable , into his mind . Of late , the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him more scantily than ever ; and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes , he had got up again , and haunted that neighbourhood . On a day in August , when Mr. Stryver ( after notifying to his jackal that “
64758	64911	64750	64750	he	2307	” ) had carried his delicacy into Devonshire , and when the sight and scent of flowers in the City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst , of health for the sickliest , and of youth for the oldest , Sydney ’s feet still trod those stones . From being irresolute and purposeless , his feet became animated by an intention , and , in the working out of that intention , they took him to the Doctor ’s door . He was shown up - stairs , and found Lucie at her work , alone . She had never been quite at her ease with him , and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table . But , looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few common - places , she observed a change in it . “
64922	64923	64919	64920	Mr. Carton	172	” “
64954	64955	64750	64750	he	2307	” “
64980	64981	64963	64963	I	0	” “
64989	64990	64963	64963	I	0	” “
64997	65031	64963	64963	I	0	” Looking gently at him again , she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes . There were tears in his voice too , as he answered : “
65057	65110	65048	65048	I	0	” He leaned an elbow on her table , and covered his eyes with his hand . The table trembled in the silence that followed . She had never seen him softened , and was much distressed . He knew her to be so , without looking at her , and said : “
65138	65139	65134	65134	you	140	” “
65165	65166	65167	65167	God	149	” “
65175	65189	65167	65167	God	149	” He unshaded his face after a little while , and spoke steadily . “
65221	65222	65225	65226	Mr. Carton	172	” “
65255	65256	65261	65262	Miss Manette	140	” “
65289	65320	65283	65283	I	0	” She was pale and trembling . He came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden . “
65434	65435	65440	65440	I	0	” “
65477	65492	65470	65470	I	0	” she modestly said , after a little hesitation , and in earnest tears , “
65518	65524	65505	65505	I	0	” He shook his head . “
65713	65714	65709	65709	you	140	” “
65731	65732	65735	65736	Miss Manette	140	” “

66028	66029	66025	66026	Mr. Carton	172	” “

66118	66119	66063	66063	you	140	” “
66133	66134	66135	66136	Mr. Carton	172	” “
66138	66147	66135	66136	Mr. Carton	172	” she answered , after an agitated pause , “
66163	66164	66157	66157	I	0	” “
66175	66190	66173	66173	you	140	” He put her hand to his lips , and moved towards the door . “
66297	66351	66367	66368	Miss Manette	140	” He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be , and it was so sad to think how much he had thrown away , and how much he every day kept down and perverted , that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he stood looking back at her . “
66355	66359	66360	66360	I	0	” he said , “
66462	66463	66464	66464	I	0	” “
66470	66471	66472	66472	My	0	” “
66711	66715	66699	66699	his	2324	” He said , “
66718	66722	66699	66699	his	2324	” said a last “
66727	67098	66699	66699	his	2324	” and left her . CHAPTER XIV . The Honest Tradesman To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher , sitting on his stool in Fleet - street with his grisly urchin beside him , a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented . Who could sit upon anything in Fleet - street during the busy hours of the day , and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions , one ever tending westward with the sun , the other ever tending eastward from the sun , both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down ! With his straw in his mouth , Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams , like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream -- saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry . Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind , since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women ( mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life ) from Tellson ’s side of the tides to the opposite shore . Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance , Mr. Cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health . And it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose , that he recruited his finances , as just now observed . Time was , when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place , and mused in the sight of men . Mr. Cruncher , sitting on a stool in a public place , but not being a poet , mused as little as possible , and looked about him . It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few , and belated women few , and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs. Cruncher must have been “
67100	67152	67153	67154	Young Jerry	159	” in some pointed manner , when an unusual concourse pouring down Fleet - street westward , attracted his attention . Looking that way , Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along , and that there was popular objection to this funeral , which engendered uproar . “
67156	67166	67153	67154	Young Jerry	159	” said Mr. Cruncher , turning to his offspring , “
67173	67174	67153	67154	Young Jerry	159	” “
67179	67219	67177	67177	father	5144	” cried Young Jerry . The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance . The elder gentleman took the cry so ill , that he watched his opportunity , and smote the young gentleman on the ear . “
67257	67265	67266	67266	Him	2329	” said Mr. Cruncher , surveying him . “
67293	67294	67295	67295	I	0	” “
67301	67310	67295	67295	I	0	” Young Jerry protested , rubbing his cheek . “
67315	67320	67321	67321	I	0	” said Mr. Cruncher ; “
67347	67432	67344	67345	the crowd	1386	” His son obeyed , and the crowd approached ; they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach , in which mourning coach there was only one mourner , dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position . The position appeared by no means to please him , however , with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach , deriding him , making grimaces at him , and incessantly groaning and calling out : “
67443	67510	67441	67441	Spies	2331	” with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat . Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher ; he always pricked up his senses , and became excited , when a funeral passed Tellson ’s . Naturally , therefore , a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly , and he asked of the first man who ran against him : “
67522	67523	67525	67525	I	0	” “
67531	67536	67537	67537	Spies	2331	” said the man . “
67545	67551	67543	67543	Spies	2331	” He asked another man . “
67556	67557	67559	67559	I	0	” “
67565	67590	67559	67559	I	0	” returned the man , clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless , and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour , “
67603	67639	67641	67641	he	2338	” At length , a person better informed on the merits of the case , tumbled against him , and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one Roger Cly . “
67645	67650	67651	67653	Old Bailey spy	2340	” asked Mr. Cruncher . “
67655	67660	67651	67653	Old Bailey spy	2340	” returned his informant . “
67675	67676	67667	67673	Old Bailey Spi -- i -- ies	2341	” “
67683	67696	67697	67697	I	0	” exclaimed Jerry , recalling the Trial at which he had assisted . “
67707	67708	67705	67705	he	2338	” “
67713	67718	67705	67705	he	2338	” returned the other , “
67742	68530	67740	67740	Spies	2331	” The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea , that the crowd caught it up with eagerness , and loudly repeating the suggestion to have ’em out , and to pull ’em out , mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop . On the crowd ’s opening the coach doors , the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands for a moment ; but he was so alert , and made such good use of his time , that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye - street , after shedding his cloak , hat , long hatband , white pocket - handkerchief , and other symbolical tears . These , the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment , while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops ; for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing , and was a monster much dreaded . They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out , when some brighter genius proposed instead , its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing . Practical suggestions being much needed , this suggestion , too , was received with acclamation , and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out , while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it . Among the first of these volunteers was Jerry Cruncher himself , who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of Tellson ’s , in the further corner of the mourning coach . The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies ; but , the river being alarmingly near , and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason , the protest was faint and brief . The remodelled procession started , with a chimney - sweep driving the hearse -- advised by the regular driver , who was perched beside him , under close inspection , for the purpose -- and with a pieman , also attended by his cabinet minister , driving the mourning coach . A bear - leader , a popular street character of the time , was impressed as an additional ornament , before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand ; and his bear , who was black and very mangy , gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked . Thus , with beer - drinking , pipe - smoking , song - roaring , and infinite caricaturing of woe , the disorderly procession went its way , recruiting at every step , and all the shops shutting up before it . Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras , far off in the fields . It got there in course of time ; insisted on pouring into the burial - ground ; finally , accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way , and highly to its own satisfaction . The dead man disposed of , and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself , another brighter genius ( or perhaps the same ) conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers - by , as Old Bailey spies , and wreaking vengeance on them . Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives , in the realisation of this fancy , and they were roughly hustled and maltreated . The transition to the sport of window - breaking , and thence to the plundering of public - houses , was easy and natural . At last , after several hours , when sundry summer - houses had been pulled down , and some area - railings had been torn up , to arm the more belligerent spirits , a rumour got about that the Guards were coming . Before this rumour , the crowd gradually melted away , and perhaps the Guards came , and perhaps they never came , and this was the usual progress of a mob . Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports , but had remained behind in the churchyard , to confer and condole with the undertakers . The place had a soothing influence on him . He procured a pipe from a neighbouring public - house , and smoked it , looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot . “
68533	68545	68546	68546	you	156	” said Mr. Cruncher , apostrophising himself in his usual way , “
68575	68720	68562	68562	he	2344	” Having smoked his pipe out , and ruminated a little longer , he turned himself about , that he might appear , before the hour of closing , on his station at Tellson ’s . Whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver , or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss , or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man , is not so much to the purpose , as that he made a short call upon his medical adviser -- a distinguished surgeon -- on his way back . Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest , and reported No job in his absence . The bank closed , the ancient clerks came out , the usual watch was set , and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea . “
68730	68741	68723	68723	I	0	” said Mr. Cruncher to his wife , on entering . “
68787	68796	68781	68781	I	0	” The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head . “
68807	68818	68819	68819	I	0	” said Mr. Cruncher , with signs of angry apprehension . “
68824	68825	68819	68819	I	0	” “
68859	68860	68863	68863	Jerry	156	” “
68865	68866	68863	68863	Jerry	156	” “
68871	68880	68869	68869	Jerry	156	” repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea . “
68903	68933	68896	68896	You	2346	” Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations , but made use of them , as people not unfrequently do , to express general ironical dissatisfaction . “
68941	68974	68939	68939	Jerry	156	” said Mr. Cruncher , taking a bite out of his bread - and - butter , and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer . “
68985	68986	68981	68981	I	0	” “
68995	69007	68987	68987	You	0	” asked his decent wife , when he took another bite . “
69013	69014	68987	68987	You	0	” “
69023	69030	69021	69021	father	5144	” asked his son , briskly . “
69062	69063	69064	69064	Your	0	” “
69078	69079	69076	69076	father	5144	” “
69084	69085	69076	69076	father	5144	” “
69095	69096	69093	69093	father	5144	” “
69112	69121	69093	69093	father	5144	” returned that gentleman , shaking his head ; “
69143	69275	69129	69129	I	0	” He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher , and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage . With this view , he urged his son to hold her in conversation also , and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her , rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections . The devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife . It was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story . “
69280	69285	69278	69278	you	2353	” said Mr. Cruncher . “
69379	69386	69388	69388	your	2353	” Then he began grumbling again : “
69471	70724	70725	70725	I	0	” This touched Young Jerry on a tender place ; who adjured his mother to perform her first duty , and , whatever else she did or neglected , above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent . Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family , until Young Jerry was ordered to bed , and his mother , laid under similar injunctions , obeyed them . Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes , and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one o’clock . Towards that small and ghostly hour , he rose up from his chair , took a key out of his pocket , opened a locked cupboard , and brought forth a sack , a crowbar of convenient size , a rope and chain , and other fishing tackle of that nature . Disposing these articles about him in skilful manner , he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher , extinguished the light , and went out . Young Jerry , who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed , was not long after his father . Under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room , followed down the stairs , followed down the court , followed out into the streets . He was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again , for it was full of lodgers , and the door stood ajar all night . Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his father ’s honest calling , Young Jerry , keeping as close to house fronts , walls , and doorways , as his eyes were close to one another , held his honoured parent in view . The honoured parent steering Northward , had not gone far , when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton , and the two trudged on together . Within half an hour from the first starting , they were beyond the winking lamps , and the more than winking watchmen , and were out upon a lonely road . Another fisherman was picked up here -- and that so silently , that if Young Jerry had been superstitious , he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have , all of a sudden , split himself into two . The three went on , and Young Jerry went on , until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road . Upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall , surmounted by an iron railing . In the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road , and up a blind lane , of which the wall -- there , risen to some eight or ten feet high -- formed one side . Crouching down in a corner , peeping up the lane , the next object that Young Jerry saw , was the form of his honoured parent , pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon , nimbly scaling an iron gate . He was soon over , and then the second fisherman got over , and then the third . They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate , and lay there a little -- listening perhaps . Then , they moved away on their hands and knees . It was now Young Jerry ’s turn to approach the gate : which he did , holding his breath . Crouching down again in a corner there , and looking in , he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass ! and all the gravestones in the churchyard -- it was a large churchyard that they were in -- looking on like ghosts in white , while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant . They did not creep far , before they stopped and stood upright . And then they began to fish . They fished with a spade , at first . Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew . Whatever tools they worked with , they worked hard , until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry , that he made off , with his hair as stiff as his father ’s . But , his long - cherished desire to know more about these matters , not only stopped him in his running away , but lured him back again . They were still fishing perseveringly , when he peeped in at the gate for the second time ; but , now they seemed to have got a bite . There was a screwing and complaining sound down below , and their bent figures were strained , as if by a weight . By slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it , and came to the surface . Young Jerry very well knew what it would be ; but , when he saw it , and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it open , he was so frightened , being new to the sight , that he made off again , and never stopped until he had run a mile or more . He would not have stopped then , for anything less necessary than breath , it being a spectral sort of race that he ran , and one highly desirable to get to the end of . He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him ; and , pictured as hopping on behind him , bolt upright , upon its narrow end , always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his side -- perhaps taking his arm -- it was a pursuer to shun . It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too , for , while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful , he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys , fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy ’s kite without tail and wings . It hid in doorways too , rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors , and drawing them up to its ears , as if it were laughing . It got into shadows on the road , and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up . All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him , so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead . And even then it would not leave him , but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair , scrambled into bed with him , and bumped down , dead and heavy , on his breast when he fell asleep . From his oppressed slumber , Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise , by the presence of his father in the family room . Something had gone wrong with him ; at least , so Young Jerry inferred , from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears , and knocking the back of her head against the head - board of the bed . “
70731	70736	70738	70738	I	0	” said Mr. Cruncher , “
70741	70742	70743	70743	Jerry	159	” “
70749	70754	70747	70747	Jerry	159	” his wife implored . “
70765	70769	70747	70747	Jerry	159	” said Jerry , “
70791	70792	70793	70793	I	0	” “
70803	70812	70801	70801	Jerry	159	” the poor woman protested , with tears . “
70852	70853	70854	70854	You	159	” “
70866	70867	70854	70854	You	159	” “
70874	70879	70854	70854	You	159	” retorted Mr. Cruncher , “
70971	71210	71211	71211	Father	5144	” The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice , and terminated in the honest tradesman ’s kicking off his clay - soiled boots , and lying down at his length on the floor . After taking a timid peep at him lying on his back , with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow , his son lay down too , and fell asleep again . There was no fish for breakfast , and not much of anything else . Mr. Cruncher was out of spirits , and out of temper , and kept an iron pot - lid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher , in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace . He was brushed and washed at the usual hour , and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling . Young Jerry , walking with the stool under his arm at his father ’s side along sunny and crowded Fleet - street , was a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night , running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer . His cunning was fresh with the day , and his qualms were gone with the night -- in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet - street and the City of London , that fine morning . “
71213	71240	71211	71211	Father	5144	” said Young Jerry , as they walked along : taking care to keep at arm ’s length and to have the stool well between them : “
71248	71262	71243	71246	a Resurrection - Man	2374	” Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered , “
71268	71269	71265	71265	I	0	” “
71278	71284	71285	71285	Hem	209	” said the artless boy . “
71289	71310	71311	71311	he	2374	” returned Mr. Cruncher , going on again , and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play , “
71316	71317	71313	71314	a tradesman	2376	” “
71325	71332	71333	71333	His	2374	” asked the brisk Young Jerry . “
71336	71349	71333	71333	His	2374	” said Mr. Cruncher , after turning it over in his mind , “
71357	71358	71333	71333	His	2374	” “
71369	71375	71367	71367	father	5144	” asked the lively boy . “
71385	71390	71376	71376	I	0	” said Mr. Cruncher . “
71412	71429	71401	71404	a Resurrection - Man	2374	” Mr. Cruncher was soothed , but shook his head in a dubious and moral way . “
71478	71511	71512	71512	Jerry	159	” As Young Jerry , thus encouraged , went on a few yards in advance , to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar , Mr. Cruncher added to himself : “
71541	72141	71514	71516	you honest tradesman	4870	” CHAPTER XV . Knitting There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine - shop of Monsieur Defarge . As early as six o’clock in the morning , sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within , bending over measures of wine . Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times , but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time . A sour wine , moreover , or a souring , for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy . No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge : but , a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark , lay hidden in the dregs of it . This had been the third morning in succession , on which there had been early drinking at the wine - shop of Monsieur Defarge . It had begun on Monday , and here was Wednesday come . There had been more of early brooding than drinking ; for , many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door , who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls . These were to the full as interested in the place , however , as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine ; and they glided from seat to seat , and from corner to corner , swallowing talk in lieu of drink , with greedy looks . Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company , the master of the wine - shop was not visible . He was not missed ; for , nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him , nobody asked for him , nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in her seat , presiding over the distribution of wine , with a bowl of battered small coins before her , as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come . A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind , were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine - shop , as they looked in at every place , high and low , from the king ’s palace to the criminal ’s gaol . Games at cards languished , players at dominoes musingly built towers with them , drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine , Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick , and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off . Thus , Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his , until midday . It was high noontide , when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps : of whom , one was Monsieur Defarge : the other a mender of roads in a blue cap . All adust and athirst , the two entered the wine - shop . Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of Saint Antoine , fast spreading as they came along , which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows . Yet , no one had followed them , and no man spoke when they entered the wine - shop , though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them . “
72147	72170	71514	71516	you honest tradesman	4870	” said Monsieur Defarge . It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue . It elicited an answering chorus of “
72174	72175	71514	71516	you honest tradesman	4870	” “
72183	72223	72181	72181	gentlemen	4849	” said Defarge , shaking his head . Upon which , every man looked at his neighbour , and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent . Except one man , who got up and went out . “
72227	72236	72224	72225	My wife	5044	” said Defarge aloud , addressing Madame Defarge : “
72291	72441	72288	72289	my wife	5044	” A second man got up and went out . Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques , who doffed his blue cap to the company , and drank . In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread ; he ate of this between whiles , and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defarge ’s counter . A third man got up and went out . Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine -- but , he took less than was given to the stranger , as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity -- and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast . He looked at no one present , and no one now looked at him ; not even Madame Defarge , who had taken up her knitting , and was at work . “
72450	72458	72443	72443	you	2393	” he asked , in due season . “
72464	72465	72443	72443	you	2393	” “
72491	72624	72625	72626	Jacques One	148	” Out of the wine - shop into the street , out of the street into a courtyard , out of the courtyard up a steep staircase , out of the staircase into a garret -- formerly the garret where a white - haired man sat on a low bench , stooping forward and very busy , making shoes . No white - haired man was there now ; but , the three men were there who had gone out of the wine - shop singly . And between them and the white - haired man afar off , was the one small link , that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall . Defarge closed the door carefully , and spoke in a subdued voice : “
72659	72680	72656	72657	Jacques Five	148	” The mender of roads , blue cap in hand , wiped his swarthy forehead with it , and said , “
72688	72689	72683	72683	I	0	” “
72692	72701	72683	72683	I	0	” was Monsieur Defarge ’s not unreasonable reply , “
72706	72707	72683	72683	I	0	” “
72715	72722	72708	72708	I	0	” began the mender of roads , “
72781	72840	72772	72772	he	1272	” Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance ; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time , seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year . Jacques One struck in , and asked if he had ever seen the man before ? “
72843	72864	72772	72772	he	1272	” answered the mender of roads , recovering his perpendicular . Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then ? “
72870	72887	72866	72866	his	1272	” said the mender of roads , softly , and with his finger at his nose . “
72916	72917	72905	72905	I	0	” “
72928	72933	72918	72918	You	2405	” returned Jacques Two . “
73004	73005	73000	73000	I	0	” “
73013	73023	73011	73011	Jacques	148	” murmured Defarge , to him who had interrupted . “
73027	73028	73011	73011	Jacques	148	” “
73031	73044	73045	73047	The tall man	1822	” said the mender of roads , with an air of mystery . “
73066	73067	73045	73047	The tall man	1822	” “
73074	73078	73045	73047	The tall man	1822	” said Defarge . “
73095	73096	73097	73097	I	0	” “
73178	73208	73209	73209	I	0	” With the aid of his indispensable cap , he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips , with cords that were knotted behind him . “
73422	73452	73453	73453	I	0	” He described it as if he were there , and it was evident that he saw it vividly ; perhaps he had not seen much in his life . “
73568	73588	73590	73590	they	2418	” He imitated the action of a man ’s being impelled forward by the butt - ends of muskets . “
73681	73719	73723	73723	Jacques	148	” He opened his mouth as wide as he could , and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth . Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again , Defarge said , “
73725	73726	73723	73723	Jacques	148	” “
73731	73746	73723	73723	Jacques	148	” pursued the mender of roads , on tiptoe and in a low voice , “
73884	74037	74041	74041	Jacques	148	” Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another . The looks of all of them were dark , repressed , and revengeful , as they listened to the countryman ’s story ; the manner of all of them , while it was secret , was authoritative too . They had the air of a rough tribunal ; Jacques One and Two sitting on the old pallet - bed , each with his chin resting on his hand , and his eyes intent on the road - mender ; Jacques Three , equally intent , on one knee behind them , with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose ; Defarge standing between them and the narrator , whom he had stationed in the light of the window , by turns looking from him to them , and from them to him . “
74043	74047	74041	74041	Jacques	148	” said Defarge . “
74209	74210	74181	74181	they	2458	” “
74216	74225	74214	74214	Jacques	148	” Number One of that name sternly interposed . “
74292	74293	74289	74289	his	147	” “
74301	74339	74340	74341	the guard	340	” said the kneeling Number Three : his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves , with a strikingly greedy air , as if he hungered for something -- that was neither food nor drink ; “
74359	74360	74356	74356	You	148	” “
74366	74367	74356	74356	You	148	” “
74372	74376	74356	74356	You	148	” said Defarge . “
74390	74395	74384	74384	they	2475	” resumed the countryman , “
74575	74576	74569	74569	I	0	” “
74584	74597	74582	74582	Jacques	148	” said the man with the restless hand and the craving air . “
74695	74696	74693	74693	you	148	” “
74701	74712	74693	74693	you	148	” said the mender of roads , who looked sixty . “
74731	74732	74725	74725	you	148	” “
74735	74743	74725	74725	you	148	” said Defarge , with grim impatience . “
74752	74753	74746	74747	the Devil	5059	” “
74846	74877	74817	74817	workmen	2498	” The mender of roads looked _ through _ rather than _ at _ the low ceiling , and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky . “
74961	74985	75060	75060	messieurs	2399	” He suggested it , by creasing his face with his two thumbs , from the corners of his mouth to his ears . “
75024	75055	75007	75007	He	2508	” They looked at one another , as he used his blue cap to wipe his face , on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle . “
75145	75174	75179	75179	messieurs	2399	” The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three , and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him . “
75250	75261	75246	75246	you	2399	” After a gloomy silence , the first Jacques said , “
75283	75284	75272	75272	you	2399	” “
75288	75331	75272	75272	you	2399	” said the mender of roads . Whom Defarge escorted to the top of the stairs , and , leaving seated there , returned . The three had risen , and their heads were together when he came back to the garret . “
75338	75343	75334	75334	you	2399	” demanded Number One . “
75348	75349	75334	75334	you	2399	” “
75359	75363	75426	75426	you	2399	” returned Defarge . “
75366	75374	75426	75426	you	2399	” croaked the man with the craving . “
75383	75388	75426	75426	you	2399	” inquired the first . “
75396	75400	75426	75426	you	2399	” returned Defarge . “
75403	75414	75426	75426	you	2399	” The hungry man repeated , in a rapturous croak , “
75417	75424	75426	75426	you	2399	” and began gnawing another finger . “
75429	75437	75426	75426	you	2399	” asked Jacques Two , of Defarge , “
75486	75487	75488	75488	Jacques	148	” “
75490	75498	75488	75488	Jacques	148	” returned Defarge , drawing himself up , “
75591	75610	75588	75589	Madame Defarge	146	” There was a murmur of confidence and approval , and then the man who hungered , asked : “
75636	75637	75630	75630	he	2528	” “
75642	75646	75630	75630	he	2528	” said Defarge ; “
75714	75715	75708	75708	him	2528	” “
75718	75726	75708	75708	him	2528	” exclaimed the hungry man , staring . “
75742	75743	75744	75744	Jacques	148	” “
75746	75750	75744	75744	Jacques	148	” said Defarge ; “
75785	76080	76081	76081	You	2535	” Nothing more was said , and the mender of roads , being found already dozing on the topmost stair , was advised to lay himself down on the pallet - bed and take some rest . He needed no persuasion , and was soon asleep . Worse quarters than Defarge ’s wine - shop , could easily have been found in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree . Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted , his life was very new and agreeable . But , madame sat all day at her counter , so expressly unconscious of him , and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface , that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her . For , he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next ; and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim , she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out . Therefore , when Sunday came , the mender of roads was not enchanted ( though he said he was ) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to Versailles . It was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there , in a public conveyance ; it was additionally disconcerting yet , to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon , still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the King and Queen . “
76087	76094	76085	76085	madame	5936	” said a man near her . “
76097	76102	76103	76103	I	0	” answered Madame Defarge ; “
76111	76112	76103	76103	I	0	” “
76120	76121	76115	76115	you	0	” “
76125	76126	76115	76115	you	0	” “
76129	76130	76115	76115	you	0	” “
76134	76141	76115	76115	you	0	” returned Madame Defarge , composedly , “
76144	76403	76404	76404	Bravo	216	” The man moved a little further away , as soon as he could , and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap : feeling it mightily close and oppressive . If he needed a King and Queen to restore him , he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand ; for , soon the large - faced King and the fair - faced Queen came in their golden coach , attended by the shining Bull ’s Eye of their Court , a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords ; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes , the mender of roads bathed himself , so much to his temporary intoxication , that he cried Long live the King , Long live the Queen , Long live everybody and everything ! as if he had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his time . Then , there were gardens , courtyards , terraces , fountains , green banks , more King and Queen , more Bull ’s Eye , more lords and ladies , more Long live they all ! until he absolutely wept with sentiment . During the whole of this scene , which lasted some three hours , he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company , and throughout Defarge held him by the collar , as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces . “
76406	76424	76404	76404	Bravo	216	” said Defarge , clapping him on the back when it was over , like a patron ; “
76431	76458	76427	76429	a good boy	2538	” The mender of roads was now coming to himself , and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations ; but no . “
76466	76474	76459	76459	You	216	” said Defarge , in his ear ; “
76502	76503	76489	76489	they	2541	” “
76506	76515	76489	76489	they	2541	” cried the mender of roads , reflectively ; “
76520	76521	76522	76523	These fools	2541	” “
76589	76603	76634	76634	you	216	” Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client , and nodded in confirmation . “
76608	76612	76613	76613	you	216	” said she , “
76637	76638	76634	76634	you	216	” “
76651	76652	76643	76643	I	0	” “
76696	76697	76701	76701	madame	5936	” “
76703	76704	76701	76701	madame	5936	” “
76752	76753	76758	76758	madame	5936	” “
76760	76761	76758	76758	madame	5936	” “
76773	76794	76758	76758	madame	5936	” said Madame Defarge , with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent ; “
76800	77391	77395	77396	my friend	492	” CHAPTER XVI . Still Knitting Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of Saint Antoine , while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness , and through the dust , and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside , slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis , now in his grave , listened to the whispering trees . Such ample leisure had the stone faces , now , for listening to the trees and to the fountain , that the few village scarecrows who , in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn , strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase , had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered . A rumour just lived in the village -- had a faint and bare existence there , as its people had -- that when the knife struck home , the faces changed , from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain ; also , that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain , they changed again , and bore a cruel look of being avenged , which they would henceforth bear for ever . In the stone face over the great window of the bed - chamber where the murder was done , two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose , which everybody recognised , and which nobody had seen of old ; and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified , a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute , before they all started away among the moss and leaves , like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there . Chateau and hut , stone face and dangling figure , the red stain on the stone floor , and the pure water in the village well -- thousands of acres of land -- a whole province of France -- all France itself -- lay under the night sky , concentrated into a faint hair - breadth line . So does a whole world , with all its greatnesses and littlenesses , lie in a twinkling star . And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition , so , sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours , every thought and act , every vice and virtue , of every responsible creature on it . The Defarges , husband and wife , came lumbering under the starlight , in their public vehicle , to that gate of Paris whereunto their journey naturally tended . There was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse , and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination and inquiry . Monsieur Defarge alighted ; knowing one or two of the soldiery there , and one of the police . The latter he was intimate with , and affectionately embraced . When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings , and they , having finally alighted near the Saint ’s boundaries , were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets , Madame Defarge spoke to her husband : “
77407	77408	77400	77400	Jacques	148	” “
77448	77449	77473	77473	him	148	” “
77453	77467	77473	77473	him	148	” said Madame Defarge , raising her eyebrows with a cool business air . “
77482	77483	77484	77484	He	148	” “
77488	77489	77484	77484	He	148	” “
77498	77499	77500	77500	Barsad	167	” “
77502	77533	77500	77500	Barsad	167	” said Defarge , making it French by pronunciation . But , he had been so careful to get it accurately , that he then spelt it with perfect correctness . “
77536	77540	77500	77500	Barsad	167	” repeated madame . “
77546	77547	77548	77548	John	167	” “
77550	77551	77548	77548	John	167	” “
77555	77566	77552	77553	John Barsad	167	” repeated madame , after murmuring it once to herself . “
77576	77577	77569	77569	His	148	” “
77636	77637	77983	77984	the men	1834	” “
77647	77653	77654	77654	He	148	” said madame , laughing . “
77662	77905	77654	77654	He	148	” They turned into the wine - shop , which was closed ( for it was midnight ) , and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk , counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence , examined the stock , went through the entries in the book , made other entries of her own , checked the serving man in every possible way , and finally dismissed him to bed . Then she turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time , and began knotting them up in her handkerchief , in a chain of separate knots , for safe keeping through the night . All this while , Defarge , with his pipe in his mouth , walked up and down , complacently admiring , but never interfering ; in which condition , indeed , as to the business and his domestic affairs , he walked up and down through life . The night was hot , and the shop , close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood , was ill - smelling . Monsieur Defarge ’s olfactory sense was by no means delicate , but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted , and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed . He whiffed the compound of scents away , as he put down his smoked - out pipe . “
77910	77923	77906	77906	You	2556	” said madame , raising her glance as she knotted the money . “
77931	77932	77933	77933	I	0	” “
77939	77944	77933	77933	I	0	” her husband acknowledged . “
77953	77980	77945	77945	You	2556	” said madame , whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts , but they had had a ray or two for him . “
77989	77990	77986	77987	the men	1834	” “
77995	77999	77986	77987	the men	1834	” began Defarge . “
78004	78011	77986	77987	the men	1834	” repeated madame , nodding firmly ; “
78028	78029	78016	78016	You	5097	” “
78034	78049	78016	78016	You	5097	” said Defarge , as if a thought were wrung out of his breast , “
78058	78059	78016	78016	You	5097	” “
78066	78071	78016	78016	You	5097	” repeated his wife ; “
78094	78095	78016	78016	You	5097	” “
78110	78114	78016	78016	You	5097	” said Defarge . “
78118	78124	78016	78016	You	5097	” demanded madame , composedly , “
78138	78154	78016	78016	You	5097	” Defarge raised his head thoughtfully , as if there were something in that too . “
78163	78167	78016	78016	You	5097	” said madame , “
78190	78191	78196	78196	I	0	” “
78199	78203	78196	78196	I	0	” said Defarge . “
78247	78263	78264	78264	I	0	” She tied a knot with flashing eyes , as if it throttled a foe . “
78268	78280	78264	78264	I	0	” said madame , extending her right hand , for emphasis , “
78375	78376	78371	78371	I	0	” “
78381	78413	78371	78371	I	0	” returned Defarge , standing before her with his head a little bent , and his hands clasped at his back , like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist , “
78455	78456	78438	78439	my wife	5044	” “
78463	78479	78438	78439	my wife	5044	” demanded madame , tying another knot , as if there were another enemy strangled . “
78482	78495	78496	78496	We	2568	” said Defarge , with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug . “
78503	78504	78496	78496	We	2568	” “
78511	78523	78505	78505	We	2568	” returned madame , with her extended hand in strong action . “
78575	78591	78573	78573	I	0	” Then madame , with her teeth set , tied a very terrible knot indeed . “
78594	78609	78573	78573	I	0	” cried Defarge , reddening a little as if he felt charged with cowardice ; “
78621	78622	78610	78610	I	0	” “
78684	78973	78977	78977	madame	5936	” Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out , and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene manner , and observing that it was time to go to bed . Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the wine - shop , knitting away assiduously . A rose lay beside her , and if she now and then glanced at the flower , it was with no infraction of her usual preoccupied air . There were a few customers , drinking or not drinking , standing or seated , sprinkled about . The day was very hot , and heaps of flies , who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame , fell dead at the bottom . Their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading , who looked at them in the coolest manner ( as if they themselves were elephants , or something as far removed ) , until they met the same fate . Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they thought as much at Court that sunny summer day . A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she felt to be a new one . She laid down her knitting , and began to pin her rose in her head - dress , before she looked at the figure . It was curious . The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose , the customers ceased talking , and began gradually to drop out of the wine - shop . “
78979	78986	78977	78977	madame	5936	” said the new - comer . “
78992	79009	78990	78990	monsieur	5071	” She said it aloud , but added to herself , as she resumed her knitting : “
79073	79074	79111	79111	madame	5936	” “
79098	79106	79096	79096	madame	5936	” Madame complied with a polite air . “
79113	79176	79096	79096	madame	5936	” It was the first time it had ever been so complimented , and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better . She said , however , that the cognac was flattered , and took up her knitting . The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments , and took the opportunity of observing the place in general . “
79185	79186	79183	79183	madame	5936	” “
79193	79194	79183	79183	madame	5936	” “
79200	79201	79203	79203	You	5071	” “
79208	79219	79096	79096	madame	5936	” said madame , looking at him with a smile . “
79230	79231	79203	79203	You	5071	” “
79234	79251	79203	79203	You	5071	” said madame , still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly . “
79256	79257	79203	79203	You	5071	” “
79277	79295	79296	79296	I	0	” said madame , drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry , “
79301	79436	79438	79438	John	167	” It was remarkable ; but , the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head - dress of Madame Defarge . Two men had entered separately , and had been about to order drink , when , catching sight of that novelty , they faltered , made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there , and went away . Nor , of those who had been there when this visitor entered , was there one left . They had all dropped off . The spy had kept his eyes open , but had been able to detect no sign . They had lounged away in a poverty - stricken , purposeless , accidental manner , quite natural and unimpeachable . “
79441	79462	79438	79438	John	167	” thought madame , checking off her work as her fingers knitted , and her eyes looked at the stranger . “
79478	79479	79468	79468	I	0	” “
79487	79488	79489	79489	I	0	” “
79492	79493	79494	79494	Children	683	” “
79496	79497	79498	79499	No children	2586	” “
79501	79502	79498	79499	No children	2586	” “
79507	79508	79498	79499	No children	2586	” “
79520	79521	79536	79536	you	167	” “
79539	79540	79536	79536	you	167	” “
79547	79569	79543	79543	you	167	” madame retorted , correcting him , and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good . “
79590	79591	79593	79593	I	0	” “
79597	79606	79593	79593	I	0	” returned madame , in a high voice . “
79680	79738	79670	79670	I	0	” The spy , who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make , did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face ; but , stood with an air of gossiping gallantry , leaning his elbow on Madame Defarge ’s little counter , and occasionally sipping his cognac . “
79757	79765	79766	79766	My	0	” With a sigh of great compassion . “
79769	79777	79766	79766	My	0	” returned madame , coolly and lightly , “
79810	79811	79812	79812	I	0	” “
79815	79845	79812	79812	I	0	” said the spy , dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence , and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face : “
79866	79867	79812	79812	I	0	” “
79871	79877	79812	79812	I	0	” asked madame , vacantly . “
79882	79883	79812	79812	I	0	” “
79889	79924	79812	79812	I	0	” said Madame Defarge . As the keeper of the wine - shop entered at the door , the spy saluted him by touching his hat , and saying , with an engaging smile , “
79930	79940	79928	79928	Jacques	148	” Defarge stopped short , and stared at him . “
79946	79968	79944	79944	Jacques	148	” the spy repeated ; with not quite so much confidence , or quite so easy a smile under the stare . “
79975	79985	79986	79986	You	148	” returned the keeper of the wine - shop . “
80003	80004	80000	80001	Ernest Defarge	221	” “
80011	80022	80000	80001	Ernest Defarge	221	” said the spy , airily , but discomfited too : “
80026	80027	80000	80001	Ernest Defarge	221	” “
80031	80037	80038	80038	I	0	” answered Defarge , drily . “
80081	80082	80083	80084	No one	330	” “
80090	80098	80083	80084	No one	330	” said Defarge , shaking his head . “
80105	80219	80099	80099	I	0	” Having said it , he passed behind the little counter , and stood with his hand on the back of his wife ’s chair , looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed , and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction . The spy , well used to his business , did not change his unconscious attitude , but drained his little glass of cognac , took a sip of fresh water , and asked for another glass of cognac . Madame Defarge poured it out for him , took to her knitting again , and hummed a little song over it . “
80238	80242	80099	80099	I	0	” observed Defarge . “
80265	80266	80255	80255	I	0	” “
80269	80273	80255	80255	I	0	” muttered Defarge . “
80288	80293	80281	80282	Monsieur Defarge	147	” pursued the spy , “
80308	80309	80281	80282	Monsieur Defarge	147	” “
80312	80320	80281	80282	Monsieur Defarge	147	” said Defarge , with much indifference . “
80361	80362	80352	80352	You	2606	” “
80370	80410	80352	80352	You	2606	” said Defarge . He had had it conveyed to him , in an accidental touch of his wife ’s elbow as she knitted and warbled , that he would do best to answer , but always with brevity . “
80416	80421	80414	80414	you	2606	” said the spy , “
80468	80469	80448	80448	he	170	” “
80475	80479	80448	80448	he	170	” repeated Defarge . “
80484	80489	80448	80448	he	170	” said the spy . “
80502	80503	80493	80494	Doctor Manette	170	” “
80506	80510	80493	80494	Doctor Manette	170	” said Defarge . “
80520	80525	80511	80511	You	0	” said the spy . “
80528	80532	80511	80511	You	0	” said Defarge . “
80536	80551	80511	80511	You	0	” madame struck in , looking up from her work and her little song , “
80601	80602	80606	80606	madame	5936	” “
80608	80613	80606	80606	madame	5936	” replied the spy . “
80621	80622	80614	80614	She	2619	” “
80625	80629	80614	80614	She	2619	” echoed madame . “
80651	80652	80641	80641	You	2620	” “
80661	80662	80663	80663	I	0	” “
80669	80673	80665	80665	your	2620	” returned madame ; “
80686	80724	80682	80683	the man	472	” He did not take the identification as a compliment ; but he made the best of it , and turned it off with a laugh . After sipping his cognac to the end , he added : “
80839	81020	80834	80837	his mother ’s family	2627	” Madame Defarge knitted steadily , but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband . Do what he would , behind the little counter , as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe , he was troubled , and his hand was not trustworthy . The spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it , or to record it in his mind . Having made , at least , this one hit , whatever it might prove to be worth , and no customers coming in to help him to any other , Mr. Barsad paid for what he had drunk , and took his leave : taking occasion to say , in a genteel manner , before he departed , that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again . For some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine , the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them , lest he should come back . “
81026	81054	81056	81056	he	2628	” said Defarge , in a low voice , looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair : “
81063	81064	81056	81056	he	2628	” “
81071	81081	81066	81066	he	2628	” returned madame , lifting her eyebrows a little , “
81093	81094	81056	81056	he	2628	” “
81098	81105	81066	81066	he	2628	” Defarge began , and stopped . “
81110	81115	81066	81066	he	2628	” repeated his wife . “
81146	81147	81137	81137	Destiny	224	” “
81153	81163	81137	81137	Destiny	224	” said Madame Defarge , with her usual composure , “
81192	81193	81137	81137	Destiny	224	” “
81209	81224	81137	81137	Destiny	224	strange”--said Defarge , rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it , “
81267	81268	81285	81285	I	0	” “
81280	81284	81285	81285	I	0	” answered madame . “
81308	81588	81589	81591	A great woman	2636	” She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words , and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head . Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone , or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its disappearance ; howbeit , the Saint took courage to lounge in , very shortly afterwards , and the wine - shop recovered its habitual aspect . In the evening , at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned himself inside out , and sat on door - steps and window - ledges , and came to the corners of vile streets and courts , for a breath of air , Madame Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group : a Missionary -- there were many like her -- such as the world will do well never to breed again . All the women knitted . They knitted worthless things ; but , the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking ; the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus : if the bony fingers had been still , the stomachs would have been more famine - pinched . But , as the fingers went , the eyes went , and the thoughts . And as Madame Defarge moved on from group to group , all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with , and left behind . Her husband smoked at his door , looking after her with admiration . “
81593	81597	81598	81600	a strong woman	2637	” said he , “
81611	81855	81606	81609	a frightfully grand woman	2639	” Darkness closed around , and then came the ringing of church bells and the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard , as the women sat knitting , knitting . Darkness encompassed them . Another darkness was closing in as surely , when the church bells , then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France , should be melted into thundering cannon ; when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice , that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty , Freedom and Life . So much was closing in about the women who sat knitting , knitting , that they their very selves were closing in around a structure yet unbuilt , where they were to sit knitting , knitting , counting dropping heads . CHAPTER XVII . One Night Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in Soho , than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat under the plane - tree together . Never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great London , than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree , and shone upon their faces through its leaves . Lucie was to be married to - morrow . She had reserved this last evening for her father , and they sat alone under the plane - tree . “
81864	81865	81856	81856	You	2640	” “
81871	81953	81856	81856	You	2640	” They had said little , though they had been there a long time . When it was yet light enough to work and read , she had neither engaged herself in her usual work , nor had she read to him . She had employed herself in both ways , at his side under the tree , many and many a time ; but , this time was not quite like any other , and nothing could make it so . “
82050	82115	82116	82117	Dearest dear	5101	” Even as it was , she could not command her voice . In the sad moonlight , she clasped him by the neck , and laid her face upon his breast . In the moonlight which is always sad , as the light of the sun itself is -- as the light called human life is -- at its coming and its going . “
82179	82196	82174	82174	you	2643	” Her father answered , with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed , “
82207	82217	82224	82224	Lucie	174	” he added , as he tenderly kissed her : “
82247	82248	82257	82258	my father!--	2649	” “
82259	82260	82257	82258	my father!--	2649	” “
82311	82332	82335	82336	my child	2642	” She moved her hand towards his lips , but he took it in his , and repeated the word . “
82389	82390	82375	82375	yourself	2643	” “
82410	82433	82434	82434	My	0	” He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles , having seen him ; and replied : “
82499	82547	82569	82569	her	2642	” It was the first time , except at the trial , of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering . It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears ; and she remembered it long afterwards . “
82550	82564	82569	82569	her	2642	” said the Doctor of Beauvais , raising his hand towards the moon . “
82668	82685	82764	82764	her	2642	” He added in his inward and pondering manner , as he looked at the moon , “
82704	82759	82760	82760	I	0	” The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time , deepened as he dwelt upon it ; but , there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference . He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over . “
82882	82897	82898	82898	I	0	” She drew closer to him , and kissed his cheek and his hand . “
82976	82977	82978	82979	My father	4969	” “
83008	83009	83010	83010	You	4969	” “
83050	83051	83045	83045	I	0	” “
83064	83065	83058	83058	She	5576	” “
83187	83188	83189	83190	The figure	6042	” “
83203	83204	83189	83190	The figure	6042	” “
83300	83325	83291	83293	a solitary prisoner	2677	” His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold , as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition . “
83400	83401	83402	83402	I	0	” “
83424	83425	83427	83427	she	5576	” “
83433	83440	83427	83427	she	5576	” said the Doctor of Beauvais , “
83525	83526	83515	83515	I	0	” “
83555	83556	83557	83557	Lucie	174	” “
83617	84149	83590	83590	My	0	” He embraced her , solemnly commended her to Heaven , and humbly thanked Heaven for having bestowed her on him . By - and - bye , they went into the house . There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry ; there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross . The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence ; they had been able to extend it , by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger , and they desired nothing more . Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper . They were only three at table , and Miss Pross made the third . He regretted that Charles was not there ; was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away ; and drank to him affectionately . So , the time came for him to bid Lucie good night , and they separated . But , in the stillness of the third hour of the morning , Lucie came downstairs again , and stole into his room ; not free from unshaped fears , beforehand . All things , however , were in their places ; all was quiet ; and he lay asleep , his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow , and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet . She put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance , crept up to his bed , and put her lips to his ; then , leaned over him , and looked at him . Into his handsome face , the bitter waters of captivity had worn ; but , he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong , that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep . A more remarkable face in its quiet , resolute , and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant , was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep , that night . She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast , and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be , and as his sorrows deserved . Then , she withdrew her hand , and kissed his lips once more , and went away . So , the sunrise came , and the shadows of the leaves of the plane - tree moved upon his face , as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him . CHAPTER XVIII . Nine Days The marriage - day was shining brightly , and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctor ’s room , where he was speaking with Charles Darnay . They were ready to go to church ; the beautiful bride , Mr. Lorry , and Miss Pross -- to whom the event , through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable , would have been one of absolute bliss , but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have been the bridegroom . “
84153	84185	83590	83590	My	0	” said Mr. Lorry , who could not sufficiently admire the bride , and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet , pretty dress ; “
84237	84238	84234	84235	Mr. Charles	162	” “
84245	84256	84239	84239	You	0	” remarked the matter - of - fact Miss Pross , “
84267	84268	84261	84261	you	0	” “
84278	84285	84286	84286	I	0	” said the gentle Mr. Lorry . “
84291	84296	84298	84298	you	0	” said Miss Pross ; “
84302	84303	84304	84304	I	0	” “
84309	84328	84329	84329	You	0	” ( By this time , Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her , on occasion . ) “
84382	84387	84389	84389	I	0	” said Miss Pross , “
84409	84410	84411	84411	I	0	” “
84416	84421	84411	84411	I	0	” said Mr. Lorry , “
84486	84487	84476	84477	Mrs. Lorry	226	” “
84492	84497	84498	84498	You	0	” From Miss Pross . “
84509	84517	84505	84507	a Mrs. Lorry	226	” asked the gentleman of that name . “
84520	84525	84505	84507	a Mrs. Lorry	226	” rejoined Miss Pross ; “
84534	84535	84526	84526	you	0	” “
84538	84549	84526	84526	you	0	” observed Mr. Lorry , beamingly adjusting his little wig , “
84556	84557	84526	84526	you	0	” “
84567	84572	84559	84559	you	0	” pursued Miss Pross , “
84581	84582	84559	84559	you	0	” “
84588	84593	84559	84559	you	0	” said Mr. Lorry , “
84626	84635	84624	84624	Lucie	174	” drawing his arm soothingly round her waist , “
84816	85160	84809	84809	Somebody	405	” For a moment , he held the fair face from him to look at the well - remembered expression on the forehead , and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig , with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which , if such things be old - fashioned , were as old as Adam . The door of the Doctor ’s room opened , and he came out with Charles Darnay . He was so deadly pale -- which had not been the case when they went in together -- that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face . But , in the composure of his manner he was unaltered , except that to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him , like a cold wind . He gave his arm to his daughter , and took her down - stairs to the chariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day . The rest followed in another carriage , and soon , in a neighbouring church , where no strange eyes looked on , Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married . Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done , some diamonds , very bright and sparkling , glanced on the bride ’s hand , which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry ’s pockets . They returned home to breakfast , and all went well , and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker ’s white locks in the Paris garret , were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight , on the threshold of the door at parting . It was a hard parting , though it was not for long . But her father cheered her , and said at last , gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms , “
85170	85348	85349	85349	I	0	” And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window , and she was gone . The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious , and the preparations having been very simple and few , the Doctor , Mr. Lorry , and Miss Pross , were left quite alone . It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall , that Mr. Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor ; as if the golden arm uplifted there , had struck him a poisoned blow . He had naturally repressed much , and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone . But , it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry ; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up - stairs , Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wine - shop keeper , and the starlight ride . “
85352	85363	85349	85349	I	0	” he whispered to Miss Pross , after anxious consideration , “
85424	85490	85491	85492	Good God	149	” It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson ’s , than to look out of Tellson ’s . He was detained two hours . When he came back , he ascended the old staircase alone , having asked no question of the servant ; going thus into the Doctor ’s rooms , he was stopped by a low sound of knocking . “
85494	85502	85491	85492	Good God	149	” he said , with a start . “
85507	85521	85491	85492	Good God	149	” Miss Pross , with a terrified face , was at his ear . “
85532	85540	85491	85492	Good God	149	” cried she , wringing her hands . “
85560	85616	85617	85618	Doctor Manette	170	” Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her , and went himself into the Doctor ’s room . The bench was turned towards the light , as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before , and his head was bent down , and he was very busy . “
85627	85758	85624	85625	Doctor Manette	170	” The Doctor looked at him for a moment -- half inquiringly , half as if he were angry at being spoken to -- and bent over his work again . He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat ; his shirt was open at the throat , as it used to be when he did that work ; and even the old haggard , faded surface of face had come back to him . He worked hard -- impatiently -- as if in some sense of having been interrupted . Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand , and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape . He took up another that was lying by him , and asked what it was . “
85766	85774	85624	85625	Doctor Manette	170	” he muttered , without looking up . “
85788	85789	85792	85793	Doctor Manette	170	” “
85799	85816	85817	85817	You	170	” He obeyed , in the old mechanically submissive manner , without pausing in his work . “
85840	86388	85837	85838	dear friend	2728	” Nothing would induce him to speak more . He looked up , for an instant at a time , when he was requested to do so ; but , no persuasion would extract a word from him . He worked , and worked , and worked , in silence , and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall , or on the air . The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover , was , that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked . In that , there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity -- as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind . Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry , as important above all others ; the first , that this must be kept secret from Lucie ; the second , that it must be kept secret from all who knew him . In conjunction with Miss Pross , he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution , by giving out that the Doctor was not well , and required a few days of complete rest . In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter , Miss Pross was to write , describing his having been called away professionally , and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand , represented to have been addressed to her by the same post . These measures , advisable to be taken in any case , Mr. Lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself . If that should happen soon , he kept another course in reserve ; which was , to have a certain opinion that he thought the best , on the Doctor ’s case . In the hope of his recovery , and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable , Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him attentively , with as little appearance as possible of doing so . He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson ’s for the first time in his life , and took his post by the window in the same room . He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him , since , on being pressed , he became worried . He abandoned that attempt on the first day , and resolved merely to keep himself always before him , as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen , or was falling . He remained , therefore , in his seat near the window , reading and writing , and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of , that it was a free place . Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink , and worked on , that first day , until it was too dark to see -- worked on , half an hour after Mr. Lorry could not have seen , for his life , to read or write . When he put his tools aside as useless , until morning , Mr. Lorry rose and said to him : “
86394	86426	86390	86390	you	2729	” He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner , looked up in the old manner , and repeated in the old low voice : “
86429	86430	86390	86390	you	2729	” “
86442	86501	86390	86390	you	2729	” He made no effort to say why not , and said not a word more . But , Mr. Lorry thought he saw , as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk , with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands , that he was in some misty way asking himself , “
86505	86760	86761	86762	Dear Doctor	2730	” The sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here , and determined to hold it . Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches , and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room . He paced up and down for a long time before he lay down ; but , when he did finally lay himself down , he fell asleep . In the morning , he was up betimes , and went straight to his bench and to work . On this second day , Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name , and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them . He returned no reply , but it was evident that he heard what was said , and that he thought about it , however confusedly . This encouraged Mr. Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work , several times during the day ; at those times , they quietly spoke of Lucie , and of her father then present , precisely in the usual manner , and as if there were nothing amiss . This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment , not long enough , or often enough to harass him ; and it lightened Mr. Lorry ’s friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener , and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him . When it fell dark again , Mr. Lorry asked him as before : “
86769	86776	86765	86765	you	2730	” As before , he repeated , “
86779	86780	86765	86765	you	2730	” “
86792	87638	87639	87639	My	0	” This time , Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him , and , after remaining absent for an hour , returned . In the meanwhile , the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window , and had sat there looking down at the plane - tree ; but , on Mr. Lorry ’s return , he slipped away to his bench . The time went very slowly on , and Mr. Lorry ’s hope darkened , and his heart grew heavier again , and grew yet heavier and heavier every day . The third day came and went , the fourth , the fifth . Five days , six days , seven days , eight days , nine days . With a hope ever darkening , and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier , Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time . The secret was well kept , and Lucie was unconscious and happy ; but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker , whose hand had been a little out at first , was growing dreadfully skilful , and that he had never been so intent on his work , and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert , as in the dusk of the ninth evening . CHAPTER XIX . An Opinion Worn out by anxious watching , Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post . On the tenth morning of his suspense , he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night . He rubbed his eyes and roused himself ; but he doubted , when he had done so , whether he was not still asleep . For , going to the door of the Doctor ’s room and looking in , he perceived that the shoemaker ’s bench and tools were put aside again , and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window . He was in his usual morning dress , and his face ( which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see ) , though still very pale , was calmly studious and attentive . Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake , Mr. Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own ; for , did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect , and employed as usual ; and was there any sign within their range , that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened ? It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment , the answer being obvious . If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause , how came he , Jarvis Lorry , there ? How came he to have fallen asleep , in his clothes , on the sofa in Doctor Manette ’s consulting - room , and to be debating these points outside the Doctor ’s bedroom door in the early morning ? Within a few minutes , Miss Pross stood whispering at his side . If he had had any particle of doubt left , her talk would of necessity have resolved it ; but he was by that time clear - headed , and had none . He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast - hour , and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred . If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind , Mr. Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been , in his anxiety , so anxious to obtain . Miss Pross , submitting herself to his judgment , the scheme was worked out with care . Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette , Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast - hour in his usual white linen , and with his usual neat leg . The Doctor was summoned in the usual way , and came to breakfast . So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe advance , he at first supposed that his daughter ’s marriage had taken place yesterday . An incidental allusion , purposely thrown out , to the day of the week , and the day of the month , set him thinking and counting , and evidently made him uneasy . In all other respects , however , he was so composedly himself , that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid he sought . And that aid was his own . Therefore , when the breakfast was done and cleared away , and he and the Doctor were left together , Mr. Lorry said , feelingly : “
87690	87724	87725	87726	Doctor Manette	170	” Glancing at his hands , which were discoloured by his late work , the Doctor looked troubled , and listened attentively . He had already glanced at his hands more than once . “
87728	87740	87725	87726	Doctor Manette	170	” said Mr. Lorry , touching him affectionately on the arm , “
87785	87786	87783	87783	Manette	170	” “
87791	87801	87783	87783	Manette	170	” said the Doctor , in a subdued tone , “
87806	87807	87783	87783	Manette	170	” “
87810	87811	87783	87783	Manette	170	” “
87815	87820	87783	87783	Manette	170	” said the Doctor . “
87825	87838	87841	87841	Manette	170	” Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another , and proceeded . “
88025	88032	88068	88068	I	0	” he paused and took a deep breath--“a
88036	88047	88068	88068	I	0	” The Doctor , in a low voice , asked , “
88053	88054	88068	88068	I	0	” “
88060	88061	88068	88068	I	0	” “
88071	88078	88068	88068	I	0	” glancing at his hands again , “
88091	88092	88068	88068	I	0	” “
88098	88099	88068	88068	I	0	” “
88108	88124	88106	88106	him	2737	” asked the Doctor , distinctly and collectedly , though in the same low voice , “
88131	88132	88103	88103	you	0	” “
88135	88136	88103	88103	you	0	” “
88161	88162	88163	88163	I	0	” “
88169	88170	88171	88171	You	0	” “
88185	88186	88178	88179	his daughter	889	” “
88222	88232	88268	88268	Manette	170	” The Doctor grasped his hand , and murmured , “
88243	88263	88268	88268	Manette	170	” Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return , and neither of the two spoke for a little while . “
88270	88287	88268	88268	Manette	170	” said Mr. Lorry , at length , in his most considerate and most affectionate way , “
88428	88507	88508	88509	Doctor Manette	170	“ But I do n’t know how to originate , in such a case . If your sagacity , knowledge , and experience , could put me on the right track , I might be able to do so much ; unenlightened and undirected , I can do so little . Pray discuss it with me ; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly , and teach me how to be a little more useful . ”
88527	88533	88535	88536	the Doctor	1514	“ I think it probable , ”
88544	88564	88535	88536	the Doctor	1514	“ that the relapse you have described , my dear friend , was not quite unforeseen by its subject . ”
88565	88572	88573	88574	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Was it dreaded by him ? ”
88579	88583	88584	88584	He	133	“ Very much . ”
88592	88635	88584	88584	He	133	“ You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer ’s mind , and how difficult -- how almost impossible -- it is , for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him . ”
88636	88640	88642	88643	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Would he , ”
88645	88670	88642	88643	Mr. Lorry	133	“ be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one , when it is on him ? ”
88671	88704	88710	88711	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I think so . But it is , as I have told you , next to impossible . I even believe it -- in some cases -- to be quite impossible . ”
88705	88708	88710	88711	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Now , ”
88732	88741	88715	88715	his	133	“ to what would you refer this attack ? ”
88742	88746	88748	88749	Doctor Manette	170	“ I believe , ”
88751	88849	88748	88749	Doctor Manette	170	“ that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady . Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled , I think . It is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind , that those associations would be recalled -- say , under certain circumstances -- say , on a particular occasion . He tried to prepare himself in vain ; perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it . ”
88850	88861	88863	88864	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Would he remember what took place in the relapse ? ”
88890	88895	88879	88879	his	1514	“ Not at all . ”
88896	88904	88906	88907	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Now , as to the future , ”
88909	88915	88917	88918	the Doctor	1514	“ As to the future , ”
88923	88989	88917	88918	the Doctor	1514	“ I should have great hope . As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon , I should have great hope . He , yielding under the pressure of a complicated something , long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against , and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed , I should hope that the worst was over . ”
88990	89004	89006	89007	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Well , well ! That ’s good comfort . I am thankful ! ”
89009	89014	89016	89017	the Doctor	1514	“ I am thankful ! ”
89025	89032	89034	89035	Mr. Lorry	133	“ There are two other points , ”
89037	89052	89034	89035	Mr. Lorry	133	“ on which I am anxious to be instructed . I may go on ? ”
89053	89064	89065	89066	The Doctor	1514	“ You can not do your friend a better service . ”
89072	89121	89065	89066	The Doctor	1514	“ To the first , then . He is of a studious habit , and unusually energetic ; he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge , to the conducting of experiments , to many things . Now , does he do too much ? ”
89122	89198	89034	89035	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I think not . It may be the character of his mind , to be always in singular need of occupation . That may be , in part , natural to it ; in part , the result of affliction . The less it was occupied with healthy things , the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction . He may have observed himself , and made the discovery . ”
89199	89213	89034	89035	Mr. Lorry	133	“ You are sure that he is not under too great a strain ? ”
89214	89224	89065	89066	The Doctor	1514	“ I think I am quite sure of it . ”
89225	89235	89034	89035	Mr. Lorry	133	“ My dear Manette , if he were overworked now-- ”
89236	89265	89034	89035	Mr. Lorry	133	“ My dear Lorry , I doubt if that could easily be . There has been a violent stress in one direction , and it needs a counterweight . ”
89266	89300	89065	89066	The Doctor	1514	“ Excuse me , as a persistent man of business . Assuming for a moment , that he _ was _ overworked ; it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder ? ”
89301	89313	89315	89316	Doctor Manette	170	“ I do not think so . I do not think , ”
89325	89399	89400	89400	He	170	“ that anything but the one train of association would renew it . I think that , henceforth , nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it . After what has happened , and after his recovery , I find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again . I trust , and I almost believe , that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted . ”
89518	89534	89536	89537	Mr. Lorry	133	“ The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from , ”
89543	89615	89540	89540	his	133	“ we will call -- Blacksmith ’s work , Blacksmith ’s work . We will say , to put a case and for the sake of illustration , that he had been used , in his bad time , to work at a little forge . We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again . Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him ? ”
89634	89643	89645	89646	Mr. Lorry	133	“ He has always kept it by him , ”
89656	89671	89645	89646	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Now , would it not be better that he should let it go ? ”
89689	89700	89702	89703	Mr. Lorry	133	“ You do not find it easy to advise me ? ”
89705	89720	89702	89703	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I quite understand it to be a nice question . And yet I think-- ”
89731	89735	89737	89738	Doctor Manette	170	“ You see , ”
89748	89919	89920	89920	He	133	“ it is very hard to explain , consistently , the innermost workings of this poor man ’s mind . He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation , and it was so welcome when it came ; no doubt it relieved his pain so much , by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain , and by substituting , as he became more practised , the ingenuity of the hands , for the ingenuity of the mental torture ; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach . Even now , when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been , and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence , the idea that he might need that old employment , and not find it , gives him a sudden sense of terror , like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child . ”
89937	90021	89927	89927	he	133	“ But may not -- mind ! I ask for information , as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas , shillings , and bank - notes -- may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea ? If the thing were gone , my dear Manette , might not the fear go with it ? In short , is it not a concession to the misgiving , to keep the forge ? ”
90027	90033	90035	90036	the Doctor	1514	“ You see , too , ”
90040	90048	90035	90036	the Doctor	1514	“ it is such an old companion . ”
90049	90056	90058	90059	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I would not keep it , ”
90077	90123	90071	90071	he	133	“ I would recommend him to sacrifice it . I only want your authority . I am sure it does no good . Come ! Give me your authority , like a dear good man . For his daughter ’s sake , my dear Manette ! ”
90136	90185	90186	90187	Mr. Lorry	133	“ In her name , then , let it be done ; I sanction it . But , I would not take it away while he was present . Let it be removed when he is not there ; let him miss his old companion after an absence . ”
90557	90561	90563	90563	Carton	177	“ Mr. Darnay , ”
90565	90573	90563	90563	Carton	177	“ I wish we might be friends . ”
90574	90583	90631	90632	Charles Darnay	162	“ We are already friends , I hope . ”
90584	90630	90563	90563	Carton	177	“ You are good enough to say so , as a fashion of speech ; but , I do n’t mean any fashion of speech . Indeed , when I say I wish we might be friends , I scarcely mean quite that , either . ”
90656	90661	90663	90663	Carton	177	“ Upon my life , ”
90667	90707	90663	90663	Carton	177	“ I find that easier to comprehend in my own mind , than to convey to yours . However , let me try . You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than -- than usual ? ”
90708	90727	90563	90563	Carton	177	“ I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking . ”
90728	90783	90663	90663	Carton	177	“ I remember it too . The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me , for I always remember them . I hope it may be taken into account one day , when all days are at an end for me ! Do n’t be alarmed ; I am not going to preach . ”
90784	90803	90663	90663	Carton	177	“ I am not at all alarmed . Earnestness in you , is anything but alarming to me . ”
90804	90807	90809	90809	Carton	177	“ Ah ! ”
90826	90864	90821	90821	he	177	“ On the drunken occasion in question ( one of a large number , as you know ) , I was insufferable about liking you , and not liking you . I wish you would forget it . ”
90865	90872	90663	90663	Carton	177	“ I forgot it long ago . ”
90873	90921	90663	90663	Carton	177	“ Fashion of speech again ! But , Mr. Darnay , oblivion is not so easy to me , as you represent it to be to you . I have by no means forgotten it , and a light answer does not help me to forget it . ”
90922	90930	90821	90821	he	177	“ If it was a light answer , ”
90934	91019	90821	90821	he	177	“ I beg your forgiveness for it . I had no other object than to turn a slight thing , which , to my surprise , seems to trouble you too much , aside . I declare to you , on the faith of a gentleman , that I have long dismissed it from my mind . Good Heaven , what was there to dismiss ! Have I had nothing more important to remember , in the great service you rendered me that day ? ”
91020	91027	91029	91029	Carton	177	“ As to the great service , ”
91031	91087	91029	91029	Carton	177	“ I am bound to avow to you , when you speak of it in that way , that it was mere professional claptrap , I do n’t know that I cared what became of you , when I rendered it.--Mind ! I say when I rendered it ; I am speaking of the past . ”
91088	91096	90821	90821	he	177	“ You make light of the obligation , ”
91100	91113	90821	90821	he	177	“ but I will not quarrel with _ your _ light answer . ”
91114	91176	91029	91029	Carton	177	“ Genuine truth , Mr. Darnay , trust me ! I have gone aside from my purpose ; I was speaking about our being friends . Now , you know me ; you know I am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men . If you doubt it , ask Stryver , and he ’ll tell you so . ”
91177	91192	90821	90821	he	177	“ I prefer to form my own opinion , without the aid of his . ”
91193	91218	90821	90821	he	177	“ Well ! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog , who has never done any good , and never will . ”
91219	91231	91029	91029	Carton	177	“ I do n’t know that you ‘ never will . ’ ”
91232	91383	90821	90821	he	177	“ But I do , and you must take my word for it . Well ! If you could endure to have such a worthless fellow , and a fellow of such indifferent reputation , coming and going at odd times , I should ask that I might be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here ; that I might be regarded as an useless ( and I would add , if it were not for the resemblance I detected between you and me , an unornamental ) piece of furniture , tolerated for its old service , and taken no notice of . I doubt if I should abuse the permission . It is a hundred to one if I should avail myself of it four times in a year . It would satisfy me , I dare say , to know that I had it . ”
91384	91389	90821	90821	he	177	“ Will you try ? ”
91390	91423	91029	91029	Carton	177	“ That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have indicated . I thank you , Darnay . I may use that freedom with your name ? ”
91424	91435	90821	90821	he	177	“ I think so , Carton , by this time . ”
91590	91598	91600	91600	Darnay	162	“ We are thoughtful to - night ! ”
91608	91614	91616	91616	her	2784	“ Yes , dearest Charles , ”
91632	91652	91616	91616	her	2784	“ we are rather thoughtful to - night , for we have something on our mind to - night . ”
91653	91661	91704	91704	his	162	“ What is it , my Lucie ? ”
91662	91683	91704	91704	his	162	“ Will you promise not to press one question on me , if I beg you not to ask it ? ”
91684	91698	91704	91704	his	162	“ Will I promise ? What will I not promise to my Love ? ”
91727	91750	91704	91704	his	162	“ I think , Charles , poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to - night . ”
91751	91760	91704	91704	his	162	“ Indeed , my own ? Why so ? ”
91761	91782	91704	91704	his	162	“ That is what you are not to ask me . But I think -- I know -- he does . ”
91783	91803	91704	91704	his	162	“ If you know it , it is enough . What would you have me do , my Life ? ”
91804	91868	91704	91704	his	162	“ I would ask you , dearest , to be very generous with him always , and very lenient on his faults when he is not by . I would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very , very seldom reveals , and that there are deep wounds in it . My dear , I have seen it bleeding . ”
91869	91878	91880	91881	Charles Darnay	162	“ It is a painful reflection to me , ”
91886	91903	91880	91881	Charles Darnay	162	“ that I should have done him any wrong . I never thought this of him . ”
91904	91957	91958	91958	She	2787	“ My husband , it is so . I fear he is not to be reclaimed ; there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable now . But , I am sure that he is capable of good things , gentle things , even magnanimous things . ”
91987	91995	91996	91996	she	2787	“ And , O my dearest Love ! ”
92018	92037	91996	91996	she	2787	“ remember how strong we are in our happiness , and how weak he is in his misery ! ”
92044	92064	92065	92065	He	770	“ I will always remember it , dear Heart ! I will remember it as long as I live . ”
92150	92159	92128	92128	he	770	“ God bless her for her sweet compassion ! ”
92648	92680	92640	92640	he	2809	“ Dear papa and mamma , I am very sorry to leave you both , and to leave my pretty sister ; but I am called , and I must go ! ”

We have been so full of business all day , that we have not known what to do first , or which way to turn . There is such an uneasiness in Paris , that we have actually a run of confidence upon us ! Our customers over there , seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough . There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England . ”

Now , come and take your place in the circle , and let us sit quiet , and hear the echoes about which you have your theory . ”

It is safe enough for me ; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with . As to its being a disorganised city , if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there , who knows the city and the business , of old , and is in Tellson ’s confidence . As to the uncertain travelling , the long journey , and the winter weather , if I were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson ’s , after all these years , who ought to be ? ”

The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people , if some of our documents were seized or destroyed ; and they might be , at any time , you know , for who can say that Paris is not set afire to - day , or sacked to - morrow ! Now , a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay , and the burying of them , or otherwise getting of them out of harm ’s way , is within the power ( without loss of precious time ) of scarcely any one but myself , if any one . And shall I hang back , when Tellson ’s knows this and says this -- Tellson ’s , whose bread I have eaten these sixty years -- because I am a little stiff about the joints ? Why , I am a boy , sir , to half a dozen old codgers here ! ”

Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here ( I speak in strict confidence ; it is not business - like to whisper it , even to you ) , by the strangest bearers you can imagine , every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers . At another time , our parcels would come and go , as easily as in business - like Old England ; but now , everything is stopped . ”

It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them , and not against , according to your commands . It is in vain I represent that , before the sequestration of emigrant property , I had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay ; that I had collected no rent ; that I had had recourse to no process . The only response is , that I have acted for an emigrant , and where is that emigrant ? “
106587	106650	106561	106561	I	0	“ For the love of Heaven , of justice , of generosity , of the honour of your noble name , I supplicate you , Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , to succour and release me .

106687	106691	106692	106692	Gabelle	195	“ Your afflicted , “
106694	107781	106692	106692	Gabelle	195	” The latent uneasiness in Darnay ’s mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter . The peril of an old servant and a good one , whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family , stared him so reproachfully in the face , that , as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do , he almost hid his face from the passersby . He knew very well , that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house , in his resentful suspicions of his uncle , and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold , he had acted imperfectly . He knew very well , that in his love for Lucie , his renunciation of his social place , though by no means new to his own mind , had been hurried and incomplete . He knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it , and that he had meant to do it , and that it had never been done . The happiness of his own chosen English home , the necessity of being always actively employed , the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast , that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week , and the events of the week following made all new again ; he knew very well , that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded:--not without disquiet , but still without continuous and accumulating resistance . That he had watched the times for a time of action , and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by , and the nobility were trooping from France by every highway and byway , and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction , and their very names were blotting out , was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that might impeach him for it . But , he had oppressed no man , he had imprisoned no man ; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues , that he had relinquished them of his own will , thrown himself on a world with no favour in it , won his own private place there , and earned his own bread . Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions , to spare the people , to give them what little there was to give -- such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter , and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer -- and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof , for his own safety , so that it could not but appear now . This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make , that he would go to Paris . Yes . Like the mariner in the old story , the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock , and it was drawing him to itself , and he must go . Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on , faster and faster , more and more steadily , to the terrible attraction . His latent uneasiness had been , that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments , and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they , was not there , trying to do something to stay bloodshed , and assert the claims of mercy and humanity . With this uneasiness half stifled , and half reproaching him , he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong ; upon that comparison ( injurious to himself ) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur , which had stung him bitterly , and those of Stryver , which above all were coarse and galling , for old reasons . Upon those , had followed Gabelle ’s letter : the appeal of an innocent prisoner , in danger of death , to his justice , honour , and good name . His resolution was made . He must go to Paris . Yes . The Loadstone Rock was drawing him , and he must sail on , until he struck . He knew of no rock ; he saw hardly any danger . The intention with which he had done what he had done , even although he had left it incomplete , presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert it . Then , that glorious vision of doing good , which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds , arose before him , and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution that was running so fearfully wild . As he walked to and fro with his resolution made , he considered that neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone . Lucie should be spared the pain of separation ; and her father , always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old , should come to the knowledge of the step , as a step taken , and not in the balance of suspense and doubt . How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father , through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind , he did not discuss with himself . But , that circumstance too , had had its influence in his course . He walked to and fro , with thoughts very busy , until it was time to return to Tellson ’s and take leave of Mr. Lorry . As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend , but he must say nothing of his intention now . A carriage with post - horses was ready at the Bank door , and Jerry was booted and equipped . “
107788	107796	107782	107782	I	0	” said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry . “

107943	107982	107935	107936	Any person	3352	” He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks , and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank , into the misty air of Fleet - street . “
107993	108000	107935	107936	Any person	3352	” said Mr. Lorry at parting , “
108012	108360	108008	108008	I	0	” Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled , as the carriage rolled away . That night -- it was the fourteenth of August -- he sat up late , and wrote two fervent letters ; one was to Lucie , explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris , and showing her , at length , the reasons that he had , for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there ; the other was to the Doctor , confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care , and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances . To both , he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety , immediately after his arrival . It was a hard day , that day of being among them , with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind . It was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious . But , an affectionate glance at his wife , so happy and busy , made him resolute not to tell her what impended ( he had been half moved to do it , so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid ) , and the day passed quickly . Early in the evening he embraced her , and her scarcely less dear namesake , pretending that he would return by - and - bye ( an imaginary engagement took him out , and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready ) , and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets , with a heavier heart . The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself , now , and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it . He left his two letters with a trusty porter , to be delivered half an hour before midnight , and no sooner ; took horse for Dover ; and began his journey . “
108381	108957	108958	108958	Emigrant	3355	” was the poor prisoner ’s cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart , as he left all that was dear on earth behind him , and floated away for the Loadstone Rock . The end of the second book . Book the Third -- the Track of a Storm CHAPTER I. In Secret The traveller fared slowly on his way , who fared towards Paris from England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety - two . More than enough of bad roads , bad equipages , and bad horses , he would have encountered to delay him , though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory ; but , the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these . Every town - gate and village taxing - house had its band of citizen - patriots , with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness , who stopped all comers and goers , cross - questioned them , inspected their papers , looked for their names in lists of their own , turned them back , or sent them on , or stopped them and laid them in hold , as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and Indivisible , of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death . A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished , when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris . Whatever might befall now , he must on to his journey ’s end . Not a mean village closed upon him , not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him , but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and England . The universal watchfulness so encompassed him , that if he had been taken in a net , or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage , he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone . This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage , but retarded his progress twenty times in a day , by riding after him and taking him back , riding before him and stopping him by anticipation , riding with him and keeping him in charge . He had been days upon his journey in France alone , when he went to bed tired out , in a little town on the high road , still a long way from Paris . Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle ’s letter from his prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far . His difficulty at the guard - house in this small place had been such , that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis . And he was , therefore , as little surprised as a man could be , to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning , in the middle of the night . Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths , who sat down on the bed . “
108960	108965	108958	108958	Emigrant	3355	” said the functionary , “
108980	108981	108982	108982	Citizen	3357	” “
109002	109003	109036	109038	the good patriot	3360	” “
109006	109026	109036	109038	the good patriot	3360	” growled a red - cap , striking at the coverlet with the butt - end of his musket . “
109031	109032	109029	109029	aristocrat	3359	” “
109041	109047	109036	109038	the good patriot	3360	” observed the timid functionary . “
109065	109066	109067	109067	I	0	” “
109072	109077	109067	109067	I	0	” said Charles Darnay . “
109084	109093	109082	109082	him	3360	” cried the same scowling red - cap . “
109110	109111	109116	109118	the good patriot	3360	” “
109121	109126	109116	109118	the good patriot	3360	” observed the functionary . “
109134	109533	109132	109132	emigrant	3355	” Darnay complied , and was taken back to the guard - house , where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking , drinking , and sleeping , by a watch - fire . Here he paid a heavy price for his escort , and hence he started with it on the wet , wet roads at three o’clock in the morning . The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri - coloured cockades , armed with national muskets and sabres , who rode one on either side of him . The escorted governed his own horse , but a loose line was attached to his bridle , the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist . In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces : clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement , and out upon the mire - deep roads . In this state they traversed without change , except of horses and pace , all the mire - deep leagues that lay between them and the capital . They travelled in the night , halting an hour or two after daybreak , and lying by until the twilight fell . The escort were so wretchedly clothed , that they twisted straw round their bare legs , and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off . Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended , and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk , and carrying his musket very recklessly , Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast ; for , he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated , and of representations , confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye , that were not yet made . But when they came to the town of Beauvais -- which they did at eventide , when the streets were filled with people -- he could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming . An ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the posting - yard , and many voices called out loudly , “
109539	109564	109565	109565	Emigrant	3355	” He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle , and , resuming it as his safest place , said : “
109585	109586	109571	109571	you	3367	” “
109593	109613	109615	109615	you	3365	” cried a farrier , making at him in a furious manner through the press , hammer in hand ; “
109621	109647	109615	109615	you	3365	” The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider ’s bridle ( at which he was evidently making ) , and soothingly said , “
109663	109664	109656	109656	He	3365	” “
109667	109676	109656	109656	He	3365	” repeated the farrier , swinging his hammer . “
109685	109741	109682	109683	a traitor	3370	” At this the crowd roared approval . Checking the postmaster , who was for turning his horse ’s head to the yard ( the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on , with the line round his wrist ) , Darnay said , as soon as he could make his voice heard : “
109759	109760	109761	109761	He	0	” “
109764	109769	109761	109761	He	0	” cried the smith . “
109794	109873	109879	109880	the smith	725	” At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd , which another instant would have brought upon him , the postmaster turned his horse into the yard , the escort rode in close upon his horse ’s flanks , and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates . The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer , and the crowd groaned ; but , no more was done . “
109884	109904	109879	109880	the smith	725	” Darnay asked the postmaster , when he had thanked him , and stood beside him in the yard . “
109916	109917	109879	109880	the smith	725	” “
109921	109922	109879	109880	the smith	725	” “
109927	109928	109879	109880	the smith	725	” “
109935	109936	109937	109937	Everybody	1759	” “
109986	109987	109977	109977	he	725	” “
109996	109997	109977	109977	he	725	” “
110003	110012	109977	109977	he	725	” said the postmaster , shrugging his shoulders ; “
110033	110266	110030	110030	you	3381	” They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night , and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep . Among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal , not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep . After long and lonely spurring over dreary roads , they would come to a cluster of poor cottages , not steeped in darkness , but all glittering with lights , and would find the people , in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night , circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty , or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song . Happily , however , there was sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness : jingling through the untimely cold and wet , among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year , diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses , and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade , and sharp reining up across their way , of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads . Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris . The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it . “
110275	110342	110030	110030	you	3381	” demanded a resolute - looking man in authority , who was summoned out by the guard . Naturally struck by the disagreeable word , Charles Darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen , in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him , and which he had paid for . “
110345	110359	110030	110030	you	3381	” repeated the same personage , without taking any heed of him whatever , “
110367	110799	110030	110030	you	3381	” The drunken patriot had them in his cap , and produced them . Casting his eyes over Gabelle ’s letter , the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise , and looked at Darnay with a close attention . He left escort and escorted without saying a word , however , and went into the guard - room ; meanwhile , they sat upon their horses outside the gate . Looking about him while in this state of suspense , Charles Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots , the latter far outnumbering the former ; and that while ingress into the city for peasants ’ carts bringing in supplies , and for similar traffic and traffickers , was easy enough , egress , even for the homeliest people , was very difficult . A numerous medley of men and women , not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts , was waiting to issue forth ; but , the previous identification was so strict , that they filtered through the barrier very slowly . Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off , that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke , while others talked together , or loitered about . The red cap and tri - colour cockade were universal , both among men and women . When he had sat in his saddle some half - hour , taking note of these things , Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority , who directed the guard to open the barrier . Then he delivered to the escort , drunk and sober , a receipt for the escorted , and requested him to dismount . He did so , and the two patriots , leading his tired horse , turned and rode away without entering the city . He accompanied his conductor into a guard - room , smelling of common wine and tobacco , where certain soldiers and patriots , asleep and awake , drunk and sober , and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking , drunkenness and sobriety , were standing and lying about . The light in the guard - house , half derived from the waning oil - lamps of the night , and half from the overcast day , was in a correspondingly uncertain condition . Some registers were lying open on a desk , and an officer of a coarse , dark aspect , presided over these . “
110803	110822	110800	110801	Citizen Defarge	247	” said he to Darnay ’s conductor , as he took a slip of paper to write on . “
110829	110830	110833	110834	the man	472	” “
110836	110837	110833	110834	the man	472	” “
110843	110844	110838	110838	Your	3386	” “

110886	110887	110879	110879	Evrémonde	248	” “
110904	110905	110838	110838	Your	3386	” “
110909	110913	110838	110838	Your	3386	” exclaimed Darnay . “
110923	110937	110938	110938	We	3389	” The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment . “
110954	110968	110969	110969	I	0	” He said it with a hard smile , and went on writing . “
111016	111017	111018	111018	Emigrants	3376	” “
111025	111060	111023	111023	Evrémonde	248	” was the stolid reply . The officer wrote until he had finished , read over to himself what he had written , sanded it , and handed it to Defarge , with the words “
111064	111093	111023	111023	Evrémonde	248	” Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him . The prisoner obeyed , and a guard of two armed patriots attended them . “
111098	111119	111096	111096	you	3386	” said Defarge , in a low voice , as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into Paris , “
111139	111140	111125	111126	Doctor Manette	170	” “
111143	111153	111125	111126	Doctor Manette	170	” replied Darnay , looking at him with surprise . “
111179	111180	111173	111173	you	3386	” “
111194	111197	111198	111198	wife	6006	” The word “
111199	111216	111173	111173	you	3386	” seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge , to say with sudden impatience , “
111240	111241	111244	111244	me	0	” “
111261	111262	111253	111253	you	3386	” “
111269	111284	111253	111253	you	3386	” said Defarge , speaking with knitted brows , and looking straight before him . “
111319	111320	111312	111312	you	3386	” “
111323	111333	111312	111312	you	3386	” Defarge spoke , always looking straight before him . “
111342	111343	111335	111335	you	3386	” “
111358	111359	111351	111351	You	3386	” “
111382	111383	111384	111384	You	3386	” “
111388	111389	111384	111384	You	3386	” “
111409	111410	111411	111411	You	3386	” “
111433	111434	111420	111421	Other people	586	” “
111443	111498	111420	111421	Other people	586	” Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer , and walked on in a steady and set silence . The deeper he sank into this silence , the fainter hope there was -- or so Darnay thought -- of his softening in any slight degree . He , therefore , made haste to say : “
111577	111578	111568	111568	you	3386	” “
111583	111588	111568	111568	you	3386	” Defarge doggedly rejoined , “
111621	112002	111614	111614	I	0	” Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further , and his pride was touched besides . As they walked on in silence , he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets . The very children scarcely noticed him . A few passers turned their heads , and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat ; otherwise , that a man in good clothes should be going to prison , was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work . In one narrow , dark , and dirty street through which they passed , an excited orator , mounted on a stool , was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people , of the king and the royal family . The few words that he caught from this man ’s lips , first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison , and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris . On the road ( except at Beauvais ) he had heard absolutely nothing . The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him . That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left England , he of course knew now . That perils had thickened about him fast , and might thicken faster and faster yet , he of course knew now . He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey , if he could have foreseen the events of a few days . And yet his misgivings were not so dark as , imagined by the light of this later time , they would appear . Troubled as the future was , it was the unknown future , and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope . The horrible massacre , days and nights long , which , within a few rounds of the clock , was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest , was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away . The “
112014	112147	112011	112012	La Guillotine	249	” was hardly known to him , or to the generality of people , by name . The frightful deeds that were to be soon done , were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers . How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind ? Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship , and in cruel separation from his wife and child , he foreshadowed the likelihood , or the certainty ; but , beyond this , he dreaded nothing distinctly . With this on his mind , which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard , he arrived at the prison of La Force . A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket , to whom Defarge presented “
112152	112153	112155	112156	the Devil	5059	” “
112164	112192	112194	112195	the Devil	5059	” exclaimed the man with the bloated face . Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation , and withdrew , with his two fellow - patriots . “
112201	112211	112197	112197	I	0	” exclaimed the gaoler , left with his wife . “
112216	112234	112197	112197	I	0	” The gaoler ’s wife , being provided with no answer to the question , merely replied , “
112243	112263	112235	112235	One	4965	” Three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang , echoed the sentiment , and one added , “
112270	112328	112235	112235	One	4965	” which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion . The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison , dark and filthy , and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it . Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep , becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for ! “
112334	112345	112235	112235	One	4965	” grumbled the gaoler , looking at the written paper . “
112356	112420	112235	112235	One	4965	” He stuck the paper on a file , in an ill - humour , and Charles Darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour : sometimes , pacing to and fro in the strong arched room : sometimes , resting on a stone seat : in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates . “
112423	112435	112235	112235	One	4965	” said the chief , at length taking up his keys , “
112442	112816	112438	112438	me	0	” Through the dismal prison twilight , his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase , many doors clanging and locking behind them , until they came into a large , low , vaulted chamber , crowded with prisoners of both sexes . The women were seated at a long table , reading and writing , knitting , sewing , and embroidering ; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs , or lingering up and down the room . In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace , the new - comer recoiled from this company . But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride , was , their all at once rising to receive him , with every refinement of manner known to the time , and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life . So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom , so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen , that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead . Ghosts all ! The ghost of beauty , the ghost of stateliness , the ghost of elegance , the ghost of pride , the ghost of frivolity , the ghost of wit , the ghost of youth , the ghost of age , all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore , all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there . It struck him motionless . The gaoler standing at his side , and the other gaolers moving about , who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions , looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there -- with the apparitions of the coquette , the young beauty , and the mature woman delicately bred -- that the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented , was heightened to its utmost . Surely , ghosts all . Surely , the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades ! “
112827	112840	112438	112438	me	0	” said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address , coming forward , “
112895	112916	112918	112918	I	0	” Charles Darnay roused himself , and gave the required information , in words as suitable as he could find . “
112921	112940	112918	112918	I	0	” said the gentleman , following the chief gaoler with his eyes , who moved across the room , “
112948	112949	112950	112950	I	0	” “
112968	112969	112964	112964	them	3427	” “
113008	113017	113018	113018	I	0	” Then he added , raising his voice , “
113028	113163	113164	113164	Yours	3430	” There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him , and many voices -- among which , the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous -- gave him good wishes and encouragement . He turned at the grated door , to render the thanks of his heart ; it closed under the gaoler ’s hand ; and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever . The wicket opened on a stone staircase , leading upward . When they had ascended forty steps ( the prisoner of half an hour already counted them ) , the gaoler opened a low black door , and they passed into a solitary cell . It struck cold and damp , but was not dark . “
113166	113171	113164	113164	Yours	3430	” said the gaoler . “
113178	113179	113164	113164	Yours	3430	” “
113185	113186	113187	113187	I	0	” “
113197	113198	113187	113187	I	0	” “
113228	113328	113218	113218	you	3430	” There were in the cell , a chair , a table , and a straw mattress . As the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects , and of the four walls , before going out , a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him , that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated , both in face and person , as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water . When the gaoler was gone , he thought in the same wandering way , “
113340	113363	113331	113331	I	0	” Stopping then , to look down at the mattress , he turned from it with a sick feeling , and thought , “
113380	113381	113450	113450	he	0	” “
113406	113441	113442	113442	He	0	” The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell , counting its measurement , and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them . “
113454	113477	113450	113450	he	0	” The prisoner counted the measurement again , and paced faster , to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition . “
113580	114508	113556	113556	He	0	” With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind , the prisoner walked faster and faster , obstinately counting and counting ; and the roar of the city changed to this extent -- that it still rolled in like muffled drums , but with the wail of voices that he knew , in the swell that rose above them . CHAPTER II . The Grindstone Tellson ’s Bank , established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris , was in a wing of a large house , approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate . The house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles , in his own cook ’s dress , and got across the borders . A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters , he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur , the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question . Monseigneur gone , and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages , by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death , Monseigneur ’s house had been first sequestrated , and then confiscated . For , all things moved so fast , and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation , that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September , patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneur ’s house , and had marked it with the tri - colour , and were drinking brandy in its state apartments . A place of business in London like Tellson ’s place of business in Paris , would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette . For , what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orange - trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard , and even to a Cupid over the counter ? Yet such things were . Tellson ’s had whitewashed the Cupid , but he was still to be seen on the ceiling , in the coolest linen , aiming ( as he very often does ) at money from morning to night . Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan , in Lombard - street , London , and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy , and also of a looking - glass let into the wall , and also of clerks not at all old , who danced in public on the slightest provocation . Yet , a French Tellson ’s could get on with these things exceedingly well , and , as long as the times held together , no man had taken fright at them , and drawn out his money . What money would be drawn out of Tellson ’s henceforth , and what would lie there , lost and forgotten ; what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellson ’s hiding - places , while the depositors rusted in prisons , and when they should have violently perished ; how many accounts with Tellson ’s never to be balanced in this world , must be carried over into the next ; no man could have said , that night , any more than Mr. Jarvis Lorry could , though he thought heavily of these questions . He sat by a newly - lighted wood fire ( the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold ) , and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw , or any object in the room distortedly reflect -- a shade of horror . He occupied rooms in the Bank , in his fidelity to the House of which he had grown to be a part , like strong root - ivy . It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building , but the true - hearted old gentleman never calculated about that . All such circumstances were indifferent to him , so that he did his duty . On the opposite side of the courtyard , under a colonnade , was extensive standing -- for carriages -- where , indeed , some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood . Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux , and in the light of these , standing out in the open air , was a large grindstone : a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy , or other workshop . Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects , Mr. Lorry shivered , and retired to his seat by the fire . He had opened , not only the glass window , but the lattice blind outside it , and he had closed both again , and he shivered through his frame . From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate , there came the usual night hum of the city , with now and then an indescribable ring in it , weird and unearthly , as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to Heaven . “
114512	114521	114510	114510	God	149	” said Mr. Lorry , clasping his hands , “
114550	114566	114540	114540	He	3438	” Soon afterwards , the bell at the great gate sounded , and he thought , “
114572	114731	114540	114540	He	3438	” and sat listening . But , there was no loud irruption into the courtyard , as he had expected , and he heard the gate clash again , and all was quiet . The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the Bank , which a great change would naturally awaken , with such feelings roused . It was well guarded , and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it , when his door suddenly opened , and two figures rushed in , at sight of which he fell back in amazement . Lucie and her father ! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him , and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified , that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life . “
114736	114745	114540	114540	He	3438	” cried Mr. Lorry , breathless and confused . “
114769	114792	114798	114798	My	0	” With the look fixed upon him , in her paleness and wildness , she panted out in his arms , imploringly , “
114801	114802	114803	114804	Your husband	5131	” “
114808	114809	114810	114810	Charles	162	” “
114812	114813	114810	114810	Charles	162	” “
114818	114819	114816	114816	Charles	162	” “
114822	114828	114816	114816	Charles	162	“ Here , in Paris ? ”
114829	114877	114878	114880	The old man	3445	“ Has been here some days -- three or four -- I do n’t know how many -- I ca n’t collect my thoughts . An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us ; he was stopped at the barrier , and sent to prison . ”
114915	114921	114923	114924	the Doctor	1514	“ What is that noise ? ”
114931	114936	114938	114939	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Do n’t look ! ”
114941	114959	114938	114939	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Do n’t look out ! Manette , for your life , do n’t touch the blind ! ”
114984	115103	115104	115104	His	3449	“ My dear friend , I have a charmed life in this city . I have been a Bastille prisoner . There is no patriot in Paris -- in Paris ? In France -- who , knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille , would touch me , except to overwhelm me with embraces , or carry me in triumph . My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier , and gained us news of Charles there , and brought us here . I knew it would be so ; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger ; I told Lucie so.--What is that noise ? ”
115112	115117	115119	115120	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Do n’t look ! ”
115125	115136	115137	115137	He	3449	“ No , Lucie , my dear , nor you ! ”
115148	115194	115137	115137	He	3449	“ Do n’t be so terrified , my love . I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles ; that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place . What prison is he in ? ”
115195	115199	115139	115139	his	3449	“ La Force ! ”
115200	115356	115137	115137	He	3449	“ La Force ! Lucie , my child , if ever you were brave and serviceable in your life -- and you were always both -- you will compose yourself now , to do exactly as I bid you ; for more depends upon it than you can think , or I can say . There is no help for you in any action on your part to - night ; you can not possibly stir out . I say this , because what I must bid you to do for Charles ’s sake , is the hardest thing to do of all . You must instantly be obedient , still , and quiet . You must let me put you in a room at the back here . You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes , and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not delay . ”
115357	115387	115388	115390	The old man	3445	“ I will be submissive to you . I see in your face that you know I can do nothing else than this . I know you are true . ”
115949	115953	115937	115938	the Doctor	1514	“ They are , ”
115968	116033	115954	115955	Mr. Lorry	133	“ murdering the prisoners . If you are sure of what you say ; if you really have the power you think you have -- as I believe you have -- make yourself known to these devils , and get taken to La Force . It may be too late , I do n’t know , but let it not be a minute later ! ”
116163	116196	116122	116122	his	133	of--“Live the Bastille prisoner ! Help for the Bastille prisoner ’s kindred in La Force ! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there ! Save the prisoner Evrémonde at La Force ! ”
116394	116399	116401	116401	Lucie	174	“ What is it ? ”
116405	116416	116418	116419	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Hush ! The soldiers ’ swords are sharpened there , ”
116421	116440	116418	116419	Mr. Lorry	133	“ The place is national property now , and used as a kind of armoury , my love . ”
117092	117096	117098	117099	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Your servant , ”
117101	117107	117098	117099	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Do you know me ? ”

117412	117435	117401	117402	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Yes . That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons . It is for their safety . ”
117553	117581	117605	117605	Defarge	146	“ DEAREST,--Take courage . I am well , and your father has influence around me . You can not answer this . Kiss our child for me . ”
117706	117710	117712	117713	Mr. Lorry	133	“ My dear , ”
117720	117777	117779	117780	Mr. Lorry	133	“ there are frequent risings in the streets ; and , although it is not likely they will ever trouble you , Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times , to the end that she may know them -- that she may identify them . I believe , ”
117805	117814	117815	117815	Defarge	247	“ I state the case , Citizen Defarge ? ”

117977	117983	117985	117986	Madame Defarge	146	“ Is that his child ? ”
118015	118020	118022	118023	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Yes , madame , ”
118025	118039	118022	118023	Mr. Lorry	133	“ this is our poor prisoner ’s darling daughter , and only child . ”

118219	118233	118208	118209	Madame Defarge	146	“ It is the daughter of your father who is my business here . ”
118234	118277	118278	118279	Madame Defarge	146	“ For my sake , then , be merciful to my husband . For my child ’s sake ! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful . We are more afraid of you than of these others . ”
118316	118329	118331	118332	Madame Defarge	146	“ What is it that your husband says in that little letter ? ”
118339	118348	118331	118332	Madame Defarge	146	“ Influence ; he says something touching influence ? ”
118349	118354	118356	118356	Lucie	174	“ That my father , ”
118379	118386	118368	118368	her	174	“ has much influence around him . ”
118387	118394	118396	118397	Madame Defarge	146	“ Surely it will release him ! ”
118399	118405	118396	118397	Madame Defarge	146	“ Let it do so . ”
118406	118413	118415	118415	Lucie	174	“ As a wife and mother , ”

118490	118580	118468	118469	Madame Defarge	146	“ The wives and mothers we have been used to see , since we were as little as this child , and much less , have not been greatly considered ? We have known _ their _ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them , often enough ? All our lives , we have seen our sister - women suffer , in themselves and in their children , poverty , nakedness , hunger , thirst , sickness , misery , oppression and neglect of all kinds ? ”

118593	118602	118604	118605	Madame Defarge	146	“ We have borne this a long time , ”
118614	118636	118637	118637	She	174	“ Judge you ! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now ? ”
118658	118665	118667	118668	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Courage , my dear Lucie , ”
118675	118712	118667	118668	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Courage , courage ! So far all goes well with us -- much , much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls . Cheer up , and have a thankful heart . ”
118713	118739	118747	118748	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I am not thankless , I hope , but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes . ”
118740	118745	118747	118748	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Tut , tut ! ”
118750	118772	118747	118748	Mr. Lorry	133	“ what is this despondency in the brave little breast ? A shadow indeed ! No substance in it , Lucie . ”
119687	119744	119665	119665	he	1514	“ It all tended to a good end , my friend ; it was not mere waste and ruin . As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself , I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her ; by the aid of Heaven I will do it ! ”
120195	120201	120203	120204	Mr. Lorry	133	“ All curious to see , ”
120212	120241	120207	120207	his	133	“ but all natural and right ; so , take the lead , my dear friend , and keep it ; it could n’t be in better hands . ”
121767	121788	121762	121762	He	5008	“ Nothing can happen to him without my knowledge , and I know that I can save him , Lucie . ”
121815	121913	121803	121804	her father	5008	“ My dear , there is an upper window in the prison , to which Charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon . When he can get to it -- which depends on many uncertainties and incidents -- he might see you in the street , he thinks , if you stood in a certain place that I can show you . But you will not be able to see him , my poor child , and even if you could , it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition . ”
121914	121932	121803	121804	her father	5008	“ O show me the place , my father , and I will go there every day . ”

129202	129246	129194	129195	the first	1574	“ ask no more . If the Republic demands sacrifices from you , without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them . The Republic goes before all . The People is supreme . Evrémonde , we are pressed . ”
129247	129251	129252	129253	the Doctor	1514	“ One word , ”
129256	129265	129252	129253	the Doctor	1514	“ Will you tell me who denounced him ? ”
129266	129272	129274	129275	the first	1574	“ It is against rule , ”
129277	129288	129274	129275	the first	1574	“ but you can ask Him of Saint Antoine here . ”
129316	129345	129306	129306	his	2555	“ Well ! Truly it is against rule . But he is denounced -- and gravely -- by the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge . And by one other . ”

130489	130551	130487	130487	Solomon	186	“ I am not surprised ; I knew you were here ; I know of most people who are here . If you really do n’t want to endanger my existence -- which I half believe you do -- go your ways as soon as possible , and let me go mine . I am busy . I am an official . ”
130552	130558	130560	130561	Miss Pross	183	“ My English brother Solomon , ”
130571	130613	130565	130565	her	183	“ that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country , an official among foreigners , and such foreigners ! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his-- ”

130672	130725	130669	130670	Miss Pross	183	“ Far rather would I never see you again , dear Solomon , though I have ever loved you truly , and ever shall . Say but one affectionate word to me , and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us , and I will detain you no longer . ”
130842	130865	130823	130824	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ I say ! Might I ask the favour ? As to whether your name is John Solomon , or Solomon John ? ”
130883	130886	130888	130889	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ Come ! ”
130891	130898	130888	130889	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ Speak out , you know . ”
130915	130973	130888	130889	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ John Solomon , or Solomon John ? She calls you Solomon , and she must know , being your sister . And _ I _ know you ’re John , you know . Which of the two goes first ? And regarding that name of Pross , likewise . That warn’t your name over the water . ”
130974	130980	130888	130889	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ What do you mean ? ”
130981	131008	131106	131110	The speaker who struck in	4090	“ Well , I do n’t know all I mean , for I ca n’t call to mind what your name was , over the water . ”
131009	131012	130888	130889	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ No ? ”
131013	131028	130888	130889	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ No . But I ’ll swear it was a name of two syllables . ”
131029	131032	131106	131110	The speaker who struck in	4090	“ Indeed ? ”
131033	131080	130888	130889	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ Yes . T’other one ’s was one syllable . I know you . You was a spy -- witness at the Bailey . What , in the name of the Father of Lies , own father to yourself , was you called at that time ? ”
131081	131084	131106	131110	The speaker who struck in	4090	“ Barsad , ”
131092	131102	131104	131104	Jerry	156	“ That ’s the name for a thousand pound ! ”
131152	131239	131142	131142	he	177	“ Do n’t be alarmed , my dear Miss Pross . I arrived at Mr. Lorry ’s , to his surprise , yesterday evening ; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well , or unless I could be useful ; I present myself here , to beg a little talk with your brother . I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr. Barsad . I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons . ”
131273	131279	131281	131281	Sydney	177	“ I ’ll tell you , ”
131283	131433	131281	131281	Sydney	177	“ I lighted on you , Mr. Barsad , coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls , an hour or more ago . You have a face to be remembered , and I remember faces well . Made curious by seeing you in that connection , and having a reason , to which you are no stranger , for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate , I walked in your direction . I walked into the wine - shop here , close after you , and sat near you . I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation , and the rumour openly going about among your admirers , the nature of your calling . And gradually , what I had done at random , seemed to shape itself into a purpose , Mr. Barsad . ”
131434	131438	131439	131440	the spy	6057	“ What purpose ? ”
131443	131486	131439	131440	the spy	6057	“ It would be troublesome , and might be dangerous , to explain in the street . Could you favour me , in confidence , with some minutes of your company -- at the office of Tellson ’s Bank , for instance ? ”
131487	131492	131281	131281	Sydney	177	“ Under a threat ? ”
131493	131501	131281	131281	Sydney	177	“ Oh ! Did I say that ? ”
131502	131511	131439	131440	the spy	6057	“ Then , why should I go there ? ”
131512	131528	131281	131281	Sydney	177	“ Really , Mr. Barsad , I ca n’t say , if you ca n’t . ”
131529	131541	131542	131543	the spy	6057	“ Do you mean that you wo n’t say , sir ? ”
131547	131561	131542	131543	the spy	6057	“ You apprehend me very clearly , Mr. Barsad . I wo n’t . ”
131615	131623	131625	131626	the spy	6057	“ Now , I told you so , ”
131636	131649	131625	131626	the spy	6057	“ if any trouble comes of this , it ’s your doing . ”
131650	131658	131660	131660	Sydney	177	“ Come , come , Mr. Barsad ! ”
131662	131708	131660	131660	Sydney	177	“ Do n’t be ungrateful . But for my great respect for your sister , I might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction . Do you go with me to the Bank ? ”
131709	131728	131625	131626	the spy	6057	“ I ’ll hear what you have got to say . Yes , I ’ll go with you . ”
131729	131802	131660	131660	Sydney	177	“ I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street . Let me take your arm , Miss Pross . This is not a good city , at this time , for you to be out in , unprotected ; and as your escort knows Mr. Barsad , I will invite him to Mr. Lorry ’s with us . Are we ready ? Come then ! ”
132027	132035	132037	132037	Sydney	177	“ Miss Pross ’s brother , sir , ”
132039	132043	132037	132037	Sydney	177	“ Mr. Barsad . ”
132044	132047	132049	132051	the old gentleman	4108	“ Barsad ? ”
132053	132069	132049	132051	the old gentleman	4108	“ Barsad ? I have an association with the name -- and with the face . ”
132070	132083	132085	132085	Carton	177	“ I told you you had a remarkable face , Mr. Barsad , ”
132089	132094	132102	132102	he	177	“ Pray sit down . ”
132119	132125	132102	132102	he	177	“ Witness at that trial . ”
132143	132161	132163	132163	Sydney	177	“ Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of , ”
132165	132184	132163	132163	Sydney	177	“ and has acknowledged the relationship . I pass to worse news . Darnay has been arrested again . ”
132194	132220	132189	132191	the old gentleman	4108	“ What do you tell me ! I left him safe and free within these two hours , and am about to return to him ! ”
132221	132235	132189	132191	the old gentleman	4108	“ Arrested for all that . When was it done , Mr. Barsad ? ”
132236	132244	132189	132191	the old gentleman	4108	“ Just now , if at all . ”
132245	132256	132258	132258	Sydney	177	“ Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible , sir , ”
132260	132315	132258	132258	Sydney	177	“ and I have it from Mr. Barsad ’s communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine , that the arrest has taken place . He left the messengers at the gate , and saw them admitted by the porter . There is no earthly doubt that he is retaken . ”
132362	132368	132370	132370	Sydney	177	“ Now , I trust , ”
132374	132409	132370	132370	Sydney	177	“ that the name and influence of Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to - morrow -- you said he would be before the Tribunal again to - morrow , Mr. Barsad?-- ”
132410	132417	132511	132512	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Yes ; I believe so . ”
132418	132464	132370	132370	Sydney	177	“ --In as good stead to - morrow as to - day . But it may not be so . I own to you , I am shaken , Mr. Lorry , by Doctor Manette ’s not having had the power to prevent this arrest . ”
132465	132475	132477	132478	Mr. Lorry	133	“ He may not have known of it beforehand , ”
132480	132504	132477	132478	Mr. Lorry	133	“ But that very circumstance would be alarming , when we remember how identified he is with his son - in - law . ”
132505	132510	132511	132512	Mr. Lorry	133	“ That ’s true , ”
132530	132534	132536	132536	Sydney	177	“ In short , ”
132538	132632	132536	132536	Sydney	177	“ this is a desperate time , when desperate games are played for desperate stakes . Let the Doctor play the winning game ; I will play the losing one . No man ’s life here is worth purchase . Any one carried home by the people to - day , may be condemned tomorrow . Now , the stake I have resolved to play for , in case of the worst , is a friend in the Conciergerie . And the friend I purpose to myself to win , is Mr. Barsad . ”
132633	132642	132644	132645	the spy	6057	“ You need have good cards , sir , ”
132647	132681	132644	132645	the spy	6057	“ I ’ll run them over . I ’ll see what I hold,--Mr . Lorry , you know what a brute I am ; I wish you ’d give me a little brandy . ”
132706	132710	132711	132711	he	6057	“ Mr. Barsad , ”
132730	132910	132711	132711	he	6057	“ Sheep of the prisons , emissary of Republican committees , now turnkey , now prisoner , always spy and secret informer , so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman , represents himself to his employers under a false name . That ’s a very good card . Mr. Barsad , now in the employ of the republican French government , was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government , the enemy of France and freedom . That ’s an excellent card . Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion , that Mr. Barsad , still in the pay of the aristocratic English government , is the spy of Pitt , the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom , the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find . That ’s a card not to be beaten . Have you followed my hand , Mr. Barsad ? ”
132911	132918	132920	132921	the spy	6057	“ Not to understand your play , ”
132926	132960	132961	132961	He	6057	“ I play my Ace , Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section Committee . Look over your hand , Mr. Barsad , and see what you have . Do n’t hurry . ”
133012	133025	133004	133004	he	6057	“ Look over your hand carefully , Mr. Barsad . Take time . ”
133415	133424	133426	133426	Sydney	177	“ You scarcely seem to like your hand , ”
133433	133438	133426	133426	Sydney	177	“ Do you play ? ”
133439	133445	133447	133448	the spy	6057	“ I think , sir , ”
133462	133556	133456	133456	he	6057	“ I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence , to put it to this other gentleman , so much your junior , whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of which he has spoken . I admit that _ I _ am a spy , and that it is considered a discreditable station -- though it must be filled by somebody ; but this gentleman is no spy , and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one ? ”
133557	133566	133568	133568	Carton	177	“ I play my Ace , Mr. Barsad , ”

133659	133670	133605	133606	the spy	6057	“ I have thoroughly made up my mind about it . ”
133738	133786	133727	133727	Carton	177	“ And indeed , now I think again , I have a strong impression that I have another good card here , not yet enumerated . That friend and fellow - Sheep , who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons ; who was he ? ”
133787	133796	133798	133799	the spy	6057	“ French . You do n’t know him , ”
133803	133808	133810	133810	Carton	177	“ French , eh ? ”
133829	133836	133824	133824	he	177	“ Well ; he may be . ”
133837	133844	133846	133847	the spy	6057	“ Is , I assure you , ”

134045	134134	134028	134028	Barsad	222	“ there you really give me an advantage over you . Cly ( who I will unreservedly admit , at this distance of time , was a partner of mine ) has been dead several years . I attended him in his last illness . He was buried in London , at the church of Saint Pancras - in - the - Fields . His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains , but I helped to lay him in his coffin . ”
134189	134195	134197	134198	the spy	6057	“ Let us be reasonable , ”
134200	134247	134252	134252	he	6057	“ and let us be fair . To show you how mistaken you are , and what an unfounded assumption yours is , I will lay before you a certificate of Cly ’s burial , which I happened to have carried in my pocket - book , ”
134258	134289	134252	134252	he	6057	“ ever since . There it is . Oh , look at it , look at it ! You may take it in your hand ; it ’s no forgery . ”
134366	134374	134376	134377	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ That there Roger Cly , master , ”
134388	134399	134376	134377	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ So _ you _ put him in his coffin ? ”
134400	134404	134348	134349	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ I did . ”
134405	134413	134414	134414	Barsad	222	“ Who took him out of it ? ”

134431	134435	134437	134438	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ I mean , ”
134440	134468	134437	134438	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ that he warn’t never in it . No ! Not he ! I ’ll have my head took off , if he was ever in it . ”

134543	134552	134554	134555	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ What ’s that to you ? Ecod ! ”
134557	134594	134554	134555	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ it ’s you I have got a old grudge again , is it , with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen ! I ’d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea . ”
134626	134633	134634	134634	he	177	“ At another time , sir , ”
134639	134706	134634	134634	he	177	“ the present time is ill - conwenient for explainin ’ . What I stand to , is , that he knows well wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin .

134718	134727	134707	134708	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ or I ’ll out and announce him . ”

134740	134829	134738	134738	Carton	177	“ I hold another card , Mr. Barsad . Impossible , here in raging Paris , with Suspicion filling the air , for you to outlive denunciation , when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself , who , moreover , has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again ! A plot in the prisons , of the foreigner against the Republic . A strong card -- a certain Guillotine card ! Do you play ? ”
134830	134833	134835	134836	the spy	6057	“ No ! ”
134838	134913	134835	134836	the spy	6057	“ I throw up . I confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob , that I only got away from England at the risk of being ducked to death , and that Cly was so ferreted up and down , that he never would have got away at all but for that sham . Though how this man knows it was a sham , is a wonder of wonders to me . ”
134914	134924	134926	134929	the contentious Mr. Cruncher	156	“ Never you trouble your head about this man , ”
134931	134950	134926	134929	the contentious Mr. Cruncher	156	“ you ’ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman . And look here ! Once more!”--Mr

134999	135136	134989	134990	Sydney Carton	177	“ It has come to a point . I go on duty soon , and ca n’t overstay my time . You told me you had a proposal ; what is it ? Now , it is of no use asking too much of me . Ask me to do anything in my office , putting my head in great extra danger , and I had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent . In short , I should make that choice . You talk of desperation . We are all desperate here . Remember ! I may denounce you if I think proper , and I can swear my way through stone walls , and so can others . Now , what do you want with me ? ”
135137	135150	135252	135252	he	177	“ Not very much . You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie ? ”

135450	135453	135455	135456	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Jerry , ”
135458	135462	135455	135456	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Come here . ”
135479	135489	135463	135464	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ What have you been , besides a messenger ? ”

135536	135605	135526	135527	Mr. Lorry	133	“ that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson ’s as a blind , and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description . If you have , do n’t expect me to befriend you when you get back to England . If you have , do n’t expect me to keep your secret . Tellson ’s shall not be imposed upon . ”
135606	135612	135614	135617	the abashed Mr. Cruncher	156	“ I hope , sir , ”
135619	136005	135614	135617	the abashed Mr. Cruncher	156	“ that a gentleman like yourself wot I ’ve had the honour of odd jobbing till I ’m grey at it , would think twice about harming of me , even if it wos so -- I do n’t say it is , but even if it wos . And which it is to be took into account that if it wos , it would n’t , even then , be all o ’ one side . There ’d be two sides to it . There might be medical doctors at the present hour , a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman do n’t pick up his fardens -- fardens ! no , nor yet his half fardens -- half fardens ! no , nor yet his quarter -- a banking away like smoke at Tellson ’s , and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly , a going in and going out to their own carriages -- ah ! equally like smoke , if not more so . Well , that ’ ud be imposing , too , on Tellson ’s . For you can not sarse the goose and not the gander . And here ’s Mrs. Cruncher , or leastways wos in the Old England times , and would be to - morrow , if cause given , a floppin ’ again the business to that degree as is ruinating -- stark ruinating ! Whereas them medical doctors ’ wives do n’t flop -- catch ’em at it ! Or , if they flop , their floppings goes in favour of more patients , and how can you rightly have one without t’other ? Then , wot with undertakers , and wot with parish clerks , and wot with sextons , and wot with private watchmen ( all awaricious and all in it ) , a man would n’t get much by it , even if it wos so . And wot little a man did get , would never prosper with him , Mr. Lorry . He ’d never have no good of it ; he ’d want all along to be out of the line , if he , could see his way out , being once in -- even if it wos so . ”
136006	136009	136011	136012	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Ugh ! ”
136019	136029	136011	136012	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I am shocked at the sight of you . ”
136030	136043	136045	136046	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ Now , what I would humbly offer to you , sir , ”
136048	136062	136045	136046	Mr. Cruncher	156	“ even if it wos so , which I do n’t say it is-- ”

136073	136084	136086	136087	Mr. Crunches	160	“ No , I will _ not _ , sir , ”
136097	136293	136295	136296	Mr. Cruncher	156	practice--“which I do n’t say it is -- wot I would humbly offer to you , sir , would be this . Upon that there stool , at that there Bar , sets that there boy of mine , brought up and growed up to be a man , wot will errand you , message you , general - light - job you , till your heels is where your head is , if such should be your wishes . If it wos so , which I still do n’t say it is ( for I will not prewaricate to you , sir ) , let that there boy keep his father ’s place , and take care of his mother ; do n’t blow upon that boy ’s father -- do not do it , sir -- and let that father go into the line of the reg’lar diggin ’ , and make amends for what he would have undug -- if it wos so -- by diggin ’ of ’em in with a will , and with conwictions respectin ’ the futur ’ keepin ’ of ’em safe . That , Mr. Lorry , ”
136319	136424	136309	136309	he	156	“ is wot I would respectfully offer to you , sir . A man do n’t see all this here a goin’ on dreadful round him , in the way of Subjects without heads , dear me , plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that , without havin’ his serious thoughts of things . And these here would be mine , if it wos so , entreatin ’ of you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now , I up and said in the good cause when I might have kep ’ it back . ”
136425	136432	136434	136435	Mr. Lorry	133	“ That at least is true , ”
136437	136474	136434	136435	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Say no more now . It may be that I shall yet stand your friend , if you deserve it , and repent in action -- not in words . I want no more words . ”
136493	136499	136501	136502	the former	6554	“ Adieu , Mr. Barsad , ”
136504	136518	136519	136519	He	6554	“ our arrangement thus made , you have nothing to fear from me . ”
136548	136570	136539	136540	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Not much . If it should go ill with the prisoner , I have ensured access to him , once . ”
136577	136585	136587	136587	Carton	177	“ It is all I could do , ”
136589	136641	136587	136587	Carton	177	“ To propose too much , would be to put this man ’s head under the axe , and , as he himself said , nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced . It was obviously the weakness of the position . There is no help for it . ”
136642	136648	136650	136651	Mr. Lorry	133	“ But access to him , ”
136653	136668	136650	136651	Mr. Lorry	133	“ if it should go ill before the Tribunal , will not save him . ”
136669	136676	136677	136678	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I never said it would . ”
136723	136734	136736	136736	Carton	177	“ You are a good man and a true friend , ”
136743	136792	136736	136736	Carton	177	“ Forgive me if I notice that you are affected . I could not see my father weep , and sit by , careless . And I could not respect your sorrow more , if you were my father . You are free from that misfortune , however . ”
136855	136862	136864	136864	Carton	177	“ To return to poor Darnay , ”
136866	136914	136864	136864	Carton	177	“ Do n’t tell Her of this interview , or this arrangement . It would not enable Her to go to see him . She might think it was contrived , in case of the worse , to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence . ”
136953	136961	136962	136962	Carton	177	“ She might think a thousand things , ”
136965	137046	136962	136962	Carton	177	“ and any of them would only add to her trouble . Do n’t speak of me to her . As I said to you when I first came , I had better not see her . I can put my hand out , to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do , without that . You are going to her , I hope ? She must be very desolate to - night . ”
137047	137055	136943	136943	he	133	“ I am going now , directly . ”
137056	137081	136962	136962	Carton	177	“ I am glad of that . She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you . How does she look ? ”
137082	137091	136962	136962	Carton	177	“ Anxious and unhappy , but very beautiful . ”
137092	137095	136943	136943	he	133	“ Ah ! ”
137276	137281	137282	137282	he	177	“ I forgot it , ”
137330	137343	137345	137345	Carton	177	“ And your duties here have drawn to an end , sir ? ”
137351	137410	137345	137345	Carton	177	“ Yes . As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly , I have at length done all that I can do here . I hoped to have left them in perfect safety , and then to have quitted Paris . I have my Leave to Pass . I was ready to go . ”
137416	137429	137431	137431	Carton	177	“ Yours is a long life to look back upon , sir ? ”
137435	137445	137431	137431	Carton	177	“ I am in my seventy - eighth year . ”
137446	137469	137345	137345	Carton	177	“ You have been useful all your life ; steadily and constantly occupied ; trusted , respected , and looked up to ? ”
137470	137503	137345	137345	Carton	177	“ I have been a man of business , ever since I have been a man . Indeed , I may say that I was a man of business when a boy . ”
137504	137528	137431	137431	Carton	177	“ See what a place you fill at seventy - eight . How many people will miss you when you leave it empty ! ”
137529	137535	137537	137538	Mr. Lorry	133	“ A solitary old bachelor , ”
137544	137553	137541	137541	his	133	“ There is nobody to weep for me . ”
137554	137573	137345	137345	Carton	177	“ How can you say that ? Would n’t She weep for you ? Would n’t her child ? ”
137574	137591	137345	137345	Carton	177	“ Yes , yes , thank God . I did n’t quite mean what I said . ”
137592	137608	137345	137345	Carton	177	“ It _ is _ a thing to thank God for ; is it not ? ”
137609	137614	137345	137345	Carton	177	“ Surely , surely . ”
137615	137696	137345	137345	Carton	177	“ If you could say , with truth , to your own solitary heart , to - night , ‘ I have secured to myself the love and attachment , the gratitude or respect , of no human creature ; I have won myself a tender place in no regard ; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by ! ’ your seventy - eight years would be seventy - eight heavy curses ; would they not ? ”
137697	137711	137712	137712	Sydney	177	“ You say truly , Mr. Carton ; I think they would be . ”
137733	137765	137714	137714	his	177	“ I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off ? Do the days when you sat at your mother ’s knee , seem days of very long ago ? ”
137776	137889	137772	137773	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Twenty years back , yes ; at this time of my life , no . For , as I draw closer and closer to the end , I travel in the circle , nearer and nearer to the beginning . It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings of the way . My heart is touched now , by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep , of my pretty young mother ( and I so old ! ) , and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not so real with me , and my faults were not confirmed in me . ”
137890	137896	137898	137898	Carton	172	“ I understand the feeling ! ”
137905	137914	137898	137898	Carton	172	“ And you are the better for it ? ”
137915	137920	137921	137921	Carton	172	“ I hope so . ”
137938	137942	137944	137945	Mr. Lorry	133	“ But you , ”
137952	137957	137944	137945	Mr. Lorry	133	“ you are young . ”
137958	137961	137963	137963	Carton	172	“ Yes , ”
137965	137986	137963	137963	Carton	172	“ I am not old , but my young way was never the way to age . Enough of me . ”
137987	137996	137998	137999	Mr. Lorry	133	“ And of me , I am sure , ”
138001	138007	137998	137999	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Are you going out ? ”
138008	138058	137963	137963	Carton	172	“ I ’ll walk with you to her gate . You know my vagabond and restless habits . If I should prowl about the streets a long time , do n’t be uneasy ; I shall reappear in the morning . You go to the Court to - morrow ? ”
138059	138064	137998	137999	Mr. Lorry	133	“ Yes , unhappily . ”
138065	138094	138095	138096	Mr. Lorry	133	“ I shall be there , but only as one of the crowd . My Spy will find a place for me . Take my arm , sir . ”
138163	138169	138170	138170	he	172	“ She came out here , ”
138177	138197	138170	138170	he	172	“ turned this way , must have trod on these stones often . Let me follow in her steps . ”

He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five , North Tower , when he made shoes under my care . As I serve my gun that day , I resolve , when the place shall fall , to examine that cell . It falls . I mount to the cell , with a fellow - citizen who is one of the Jury , directed by a gaoler . I examine it , very closely . In a hole in the chimney , where a stone has been worked out and replaced , I find a written paper . This is that written paper . I have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of Doctor Manette . This is the writing of Doctor Manette . I confide this paper , in the writing of Doctor Manette , to the hands of the President . ”

I write it at stolen intervals , under every difficulty . I design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney , where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it . Some pitying hand may find it there , when I and my sorrows are dust . “
141409	141527	141534	141535	the driver	381	“ One cloudy moonlight night , in the third week of December ( I think the twenty - second of the month ) in the year 1757 , I was walking on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air , at an hour ’s distance from my place of residence in the Street of the School of Medicine , when a carriage came along behind me , driven very fast . As I stood aside to let that carriage pass , apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down , a head was put out at the window , and a voice called to the driver to stop . “
141584	141655	141664	141664	one	4965	“ I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks , and appeared to conceal themselves . As they stood side by side near the carriage door , I also observed that they both looked of about my own age , or rather younger , and that they were greatly alike , in stature , manner , voice , and ( as far as I could see ) face too . “
141666	141670	141664	141664	one	4965	“ I am . ”
141671	141711	141664	141664	one	4965	“ ‘ Doctor Manette , formerly of Beauvais , ’ said the other ; ‘ the young physician , originally an expert surgeon , who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris ? ’ “
141733	141790	141794	141794	both	5188	“ ‘ We have been to your residence , ’ said the first , ‘ and not being so fortunate as to find you there , and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction , we followed , in the hope of overtaking you . Will you please to enter the carriage ? ’ “
141829	141870	141825	141825	I	0	“ ‘ Gentlemen , ’ said I , ‘ pardon me ; but I usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance , and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned . ’ “
141934	141979	141980	141980	I	0	“ I could do nothing but comply , and I entered it in silence . They both entered after me -- the last springing in , after putting up the steps . The carriage turned about , and drove on at its former speed . “
142055	142187	142231	142231	his	472	“ The carriage left the streets behind , passed the North Barrier , and emerged upon the country road . At two - thirds of a league from the Barrier -- I did not estimate the distance at that time , but afterwards when I traversed it -- it struck out of the main avenue , and presently stopped at a solitary house , We all three alighted , and walked , by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed , to the door of the house . It was not opened immediately , in answer to the ringing of the bell , and one of my two conductors struck the man who opened it , with his heavy riding glove , across the face . “
142258	142338	142339	142340	The patient	656	“ From the time of our alighting at the outer gate ( which we found locked , and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us , and had relocked ) , I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber . I was conducted to this chamber straight , the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs , and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain , lying on a bed . “
142420	142504	142505	142505	I	0	“ I saw this , within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient ; for , in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed , had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth , and was in danger of suffocation . My first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing ; and in moving the scarf aside , the embroidery in the corner caught my sight . “
142663	142678	142695	142696	the elder	4347	“ ‘ How long , ’ I asked , ‘ has this lasted ? ’ “
142723	142738	142709	142720	the elder who replied , ‘ Since about this hour last night	4350	“ ‘ She has a husband , a father , and a brother ? ’ “
142744	142754	142755	142755	He	4347	“ ‘ I do not address her brother ? ’ “
142765	142778	142779	142781	The younger brother	4352	“ ‘ She has some recent association with the number twelve ? ’ “
142791	142860	142779	142781	The younger brother	4352	“ ‘ See , gentlemen , ’ said I , still keeping my hands upon her breast , ‘ how useless I am , as you have brought me ! If I had known what I was coming to see , I could have come provided . As it is , time must be lost . There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place . ’ “
142902	142946	142955	142957	the younger brother	4352	“ I opened some of the bottles , smelt them , and put the stoppers to my lips . If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves , I would not have administered any of those . “
142959	142982	142955	142957	the younger brother	4352	“ ‘ You see , monsieur , I am going to use them , ’ I replied , and said no more . “
143222	143263	143289	143289	You	0	“ For the reason that my hand had this effect ( I assume ) , I had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour , with the two brothers looking on , before the elder said : “
143271	143287	143289	143289	You	0	“ I was startled , and asked , ‘ Is it a pressing case ? ’ “
143310	143450	143289	143289	You	0	“ The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase , which was a species of loft over a stable . There was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it ; the rest was open , to the ridge of the tiled roof , and there were beams across . Hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place , fagots for firing , and a heap of apples in sand . I had to pass through that part , to get at the other . My memory is circumstantial and unshaken . I try it with these details , and I see them all , in this my cell in the Bastille , near the close of the tenth year of my captivity , as I saw them all that night . “
143545	143566	143576	143576	he	4368	“ ‘ I am a doctor , my poor fellow , ’ said I. ‘ Let me examine it . ’ “
143585	143695	143576	143576	he	4368	“ It was under his hand , and I soothed him to let me move his hand away . The wound was a sword - thrust , received from twenty to twenty - four hours before , but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay . He was then dying fast . As I turned my eyes to the elder brother , I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out , as if he were a wounded bird , or hare , or rabbit ; not at all as if he were a fellow - creature . “
143708	143741	143707	143707	I.	4372	“ ‘ A crazed young common dog ! A serf ! Forced my brother to draw upon him , and has fallen by my brother ’s sword -- like a gentleman . ’ “
143816	143839	143799	143799	He	865	“ The boy ’s eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken , and they now slowly moved to me . “
143894	143924	143925	143925	I	0	“ The shrieks and the cries were audible there , though subdued by the distance . He referred to them , as if she were lying in our presence . “
143935	144037	143932	143932	her	4379	“ ‘ She is my sister , Doctor . They have had their shameful rights , these Nobles , in the modesty and virtue of our sisters , many years , but we have had good girls among us . I know it , and have heard my father say so . She was a good girl . She was betrothed to a good young man , too : a tenant of his . We were all tenants of his -- that man ’s who stands there . The other is his brother , the worst of a bad race . ’ “
144063	144243	144055	144055	his	5819	“ ‘ We were so robbed by that man who stands there , as all we common dogs are by those superior Beings -- taxed by him without mercy , obliged to work for him without pay , obliged to grind our corn at his mill , obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops , and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own , pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat , we ate it in fear , with the door barred and the shutters closed , that his people should not see it and take it from us -- I say , we were so robbed , and hunted , and were made so poor , that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world , and that what we should most pray for , was , that our women might be barren and our miserable race die out ! ’ “
144293	144426	144427	144428	The boy	5819	“ ‘ Nevertheless , Doctor , my sister married . He was ailing at that time , poor fellow , and she married her lover , that she might tend and comfort him in our cottage -- our dog - hut , as that man would call it . She had not been married many weeks , when that man ’s brother saw her and admired her , and asked that man to lend her to him -- for what are husbands among us ! He was willing enough , but my sister was good and virtuous , and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine . What did the two then , to persuade her husband to use his influence with her , to make her willing ? ’ “
144502	144638	144639	144640	Nothing human	4391	“ ‘ You know , Doctor , that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to harness us common dogs to carts , and drive us . They so harnessed him and drove him . You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their grounds all night , quieting the frogs , in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed . They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at night , and ordered him back into his harness in the day . But he was not persuaded . No ! Taken out of harness one day at noon , to feed -- if he could find food -- he sobbed twelve times , once for every stroke of the bell , and died on her bosom . ’ “
144683	144856	144667	144667	he	5819	“ ‘ Then , with that man ’s permission and even with his aid , his brother took her away ; in spite of what I know she must have told his brother -- and what that is , will not be long unknown to you , Doctor , if it is now -- his brother took her away -- for his pleasure and diversion , for a little while . I saw her pass me on the road . When I took the tidings home , our father ’s heart burst ; he never spoke one of the words that filled it . I took my young sister ( for I have another ) to a place beyond the reach of this man , and where , at least , she will never be _ his _ vassal . Then , I tracked the brother here , and last night climbed in -- a common dog , but sword in hand.--Where is the loft window ? It was somewhere here ? ’ “
144898	144998	144999	144999	My	0	“ ‘ She heard me , and ran in . I told her not to come near us till he was dead . He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money ; then struck at me with a whip . But I , though a common dog , so struck at him as to make him draw . Let him break into as many pieces as he will , the sword that he stained with my common blood ; he drew to defend himself -- thrust at me with all his skill for his life . ’ “
145047	145066	145074	145074	I	0	“ ‘ Now , lift me up , Doctor ; lift me up . Where is he ? ’ “
145090	145122	145123	145123	I	0	“ ‘ He ! Proud as these nobles are , he is afraid to see me . Where is the man who was here ? Turn my face to him . ’ “
145166	145289	145292	145292	he	4402	“ ‘ Marquis , ’ said the boy , turned to him with his eyes opened wide , and his right hand raised , ‘ in the days when all these things are to be answered for , I summon you and yours , to the last of your bad race , to answer for them . I mark this cross of blood upon you , as a sign that I do it . In the days when all these things are to be answered for , I summon your brother , the worst of the bad race , to answer for them separately . I mark this cross of blood upon him , as a sign that I do it . ’ “
145347	145394	145395	145395	I	0	“ When I returned to the bedside of the young woman , I found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity . I knew that this might last for many hours , and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave . “
145483	145549	145446	145447	My husband	5455	“ This lasted twenty - six hours from the time when I first saw her . I had come and gone twice , and was again sitting by her , when she began to falter . I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity , and by - and - bye she sank into a lethargy , and lay like the dead . “
145634	145664	145671	145671	I	0	“ ‘ Is she dead ? ’ asked the Marquis , whom I will still describe as the elder brother , coming booted into the room from his horse . “
145680	145703	145671	145671	I	0	“ ‘ What strength there is in these common bodies ! ’ he said , looking down at her with some curiosity . “
145722	145759	145711	145711	I	0	“ He first laughed at my words , and then frowned at them . He moved a chair with his foot near to mine , ordered the woman away , and said in a subdued voice , “
145826	145839	145842	145842	you	4327	“ I listened to the patient ’s breathing , and avoided answering . “
145852	145898	145842	145842	you	4327	“ ‘ Monsieur , ’ said I , ‘ in my profession , the communications of patients are always received in confidence . ’ I was guarded in my answer , for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen . “
145947	146015	146016	146016	She	4414	“ I write with so much difficulty , the cold is so severe , I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness , that I must abridge this narrative . There is no confusion or failure in my memory ; it can recall , and could detail , every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers . “
146101	146204	146081	146081	She	4414	“ I had no opportunity of asking her any question , until I had told the brothers she was sinking fast , and could not live another day . Until then , though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself , one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there . But when it came to that , they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her ; as if -- the thought passed through my mind -- I were dying too . “
146329	146385	146386	146387	The brothers	4334	“ My patient died , two hours before midnight -- at a time , by my watch , answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her . I was alone with her , when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side , and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended . “
146427	146445	146405	146405	them	4334	“ ‘ At last she is dead ? ’ said the elder , when I went in . “
146454	146472	146473	146473	He	4432	“ ‘ I congratulate you , my brother , ’ were his words as he turned round . “
146522	146539	146540	146540	They	4433	“ ‘ Pray excuse me , ’ said I. ‘ Under the circumstances , no . ’ “
146572	146599	146546	146546	their	4433	“ I am weary , weary , weary -- worn down by misery . I can not read what I have written with this gaunt hand . “
146783	146851	146852	146852	I	0	“ I was much engaged that day , and could not complete my letter that night . I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it . It was the last day of the year . The letter was lying before me just completed , when I was told that a lady waited , who wished to see me . * * * * * “
146890	146969	146970	146970	My	0	“ The lady was young , engaging , and handsome , but not marked for long life . She was in great agitation . She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St. Evrémonde . I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother , with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf , and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately . “
147100	147190	147059	147059	she	4441	“ She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living , and her greatest desire was , to help that sister . I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister ; beyond that , I knew nothing . Her inducement to come to me , relying on my confidence , had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode . Whereas , to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both . * * * * * “
147219	147299	147308	147308	she	4447	“ She was a good , compassionate lady , and not happy in her marriage . How could she be ! The brother distrusted and disliked her , and his influence was all opposed to her ; she stood in dread of him , and in dread of her husband too . When I handed her down to the door , there was a child , a pretty boy from two to three years old , in her carriage . “
147421	147486	147488	147488	she	4450	“ She kissed the boy , and said , caressing him , ‘ It is for thine own dear sake . Thou wilt be faithful , little Charles ? ’ The child answered her bravely , ‘ Yes ! ’ I kissed her hand , and she took him in her arms , and went away caressing him . I never saw her more . “
147535	147628	147638	147638	he	4452	“ That night , the last night of the year , towards nine o’clock , a man in a black dress rang at my gate , demanded to see me , and softly followed my servant , Ernest Defarge , a youth , up - stairs . When my servant came into the room where I sat with my wife -- O my wife , beloved of my heart ! My fair young English wife!--we saw the man , who was supposed to be at the gate , standing silent behind him . “
147654	147767	147647	147647	he	4452	“ It brought me here , it brought me to my grave . When I was clear of the house , a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind , and my arms were pinioned . The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner , and identified me with a single gesture . The Marquis took from his pocket the letter I had written , showed it me , burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held , and extinguished the ashes with his foot . Not a word was spoken . I was brought here , I was brought to my living grave . “
147915	148202	148209	148210	that Doctor	4464	” A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done . A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood . The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time , and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it . Little need , in presence of that tribunal and that auditory , to show how the Defarges had not made the paper public , with the other captured Bastille memorials borne in procession , and had kept it , biding their time . Little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by Saint Antoine , and was wrought into the fatal register . The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day , against such denunciation . And all the worse for the doomed man , that the denouncer was a well - known citizen , his own attached friend , the father of his wife . One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was , for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity , and for sacrifices and self - immolations on the people ’s altar . Therefore when the President said ( else had his own head quivered on his shoulders ) , that the good physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats , and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan , there was wild excitement , patriotic fervour , not a touch of human sympathy . “
148212	148222	148209	148210	that Doctor	4464	” murmured Madame Defarge , smiling to The Vengeance . “
148233	148426	148209	148210	that Doctor	4464	” At every juryman ’s vote , there was a roar . Another and another . Roar and roar . Unanimously voted . At heart and by descent an Aristocrat , an enemy of the Republic , a notorious oppressor of the People . Back to the Conciergerie , and Death within four - and - twenty hours ! CHAPTER XI . Dusk The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die , fell under the sentence , as if she had been mortally stricken . But , she uttered no sound ; and so strong was the voice within her , representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it , that it quickly raised her , even from that shock . The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors , the Tribunal adjourned . The quick noise and movement of the court ’s emptying itself by many passages had not ceased , when Lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband , with nothing in her face but love and consolation . “
148455	148499	148501	148501	her	4469	” There was but a gaoler left , along with two of the four men who had taken him last night , and Barsad . The people had all poured out to the show in the streets . Barsad proposed to the rest , “
148512	148550	148501	148501	her	4469	” It was silently acquiesced in , and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place , where he , by leaning over the dock , could fold her in his arms . “
148578	148594	148595	148595	I	0	” They were her husband ’s words , as he held her to his bosom . “
148622	148623	148624	148624	I	0	” “
148646	148647	148638	148638	I	0	” “
148656	148665	148666	148666	We	4471	” He was tearing himself apart from her . “
148717	148749	148712	148712	He	149	” Her father had followed her , and would have fallen on his knees to both of them , but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him , crying : “
148841	148866	148839	148839	you	4476	” Her father ’s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair , and wring them with a shriek of anguish . “
148873	148878	148839	148839	you	4476	” said the prisoner . “
148945	149096	148943	148943	you	4476	” As he was drawn away , his wife released him , and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer , and with a radiant look upon her face , in which there was even a comforting smile . As he went out at the prisoners ’ door , she turned , laid her head lovingly on her father ’s breast , tried to speak to him , and fell at his feet . Then , issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved , Sydney Carton came and took her up . Only her father and Mr. Lorry were with her . His arm trembled as it raised her , and supported her head . Yet , there was an air about him that was not all of pity -- that had a flush of pride in it . “
149112	149220	149105	149105	I	0	” He carried her lightly to the door , and laid her tenderly down in a coach . Her father and their old friend got into it , and he took his seat beside the driver . When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before , to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden , he lifted her again , and carried her up the staircase to their rooms . There , he laid her down on a couch , where her child and Miss Pross wept over her . “
149228	149238	149226	149226	herself	4482	” he said , softly , to the latter , “
149256	149257	149260	149260	Carton	177	” “
149267	149288	149264	149265	dear Carton	177	” cried little Lucie , springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him , in a burst of grief . “
149336	149366	149320	149320	you	177	” He bent over the child , and laid her blooming cheek against his face . He put her gently from him , and looked at her unconscious mother . “
149371	149376	149320	149320	you	177	” he said , and paused--“I
149381	149435	149379	149379	her	4482	” It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips , he murmured some words . The child , who was nearest to him , told them afterwards , and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady , that she heard him say , “
149441	149472	149379	149379	her	4482	” When he had gone out into the next room , he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry and her father , who were following , and said to the latter : “
149517	149518	149514	149514	they	4486	” “
149543	149556	149558	149558	them	4488	” He returned the answer in great trouble , and very slowly . “
149578	149579	149580	149580	I	0	” “
149592	149593	149585	149585	I	0	” “
149614	149626	149604	149604	yours	4485	” he added , with a smile and a sigh together , “
149665	149666	149667	149667	I	0	” “
149671	149676	149667	149667	I	0	” said Doctor Manette , “
149726	149727	149678	149679	the Prosecutor	4490	” “
149785	149786	149773	149773	you	4485	” “
149803	149804	149791	149791	I	0	” “
149847	149848	149832	149832	I	0	” “
149851	149852	149832	149832	I	0	” “
149857	149885	149886	149886	I	0	” Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door , and , touching him on the shoulder as he was going away , caused him to turn . “
149891	149903	149886	149886	I	0	” said Mr. Lorry , in a low and sorrowful whisper . “
149907	149908	149906	149906	I.	0	” “
149959	149960	149964	149964	I.	4502	” “
149976	149995	149965	149965	I	0	” Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door - post , and bowed his face upon it . “
150000	150007	149965	149965	I	0	” said Carton , very gently ; “
150055	150056	150035	150035	she	4503	” “
150063	150072	150073	150073	you	0	” returned Mr. Lorry , drying his eyes , “
150088	150089	150092	150092	He	133	” “
150102	150135	150092	150092	He	133	” echoed Carton . And walked with a settled step , down - stairs . CHAPTER XII . Darkness Sydney Carton paused in the street , not quite decided where to go . “
150145	150154	150092	150092	He	133	” he said , with a musing face . “
150216	150259	150273	150274	these people	6564	” Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object , he took a turn or two in the already darkening street , and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences . His first impression was confirmed . “
150264	150271	150273	150274	these people	6564	” he said , finally resolved , “
150286	150629	150279	150284	such a man as I here	4506	” And he turned his face towards Saint Antoine . Defarge had described himself , that day , as the keeper of a wine - shop in the Saint Antoine suburb . It was not difficult for one who knew the city well , to find his house without asking any question . Having ascertained its situation , Carton came out of those closer streets again , and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner . For the first time in many years , he had no strong drink . Since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine , and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry ’s hearth like a man who had done with it . It was as late as seven o’clock when he awoke refreshed , and went out into the streets again . As he passed along towards Saint Antoine , he stopped at a shop - window where there was a mirror , and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat , and his coat - collar , and his wild hair . This done , he went on direct to Defarge ’s , and went in . There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three , of the restless fingers and the croaking voice . This man , whom he had seen upon the Jury , stood drinking at the little counter , in conversation with the Defarges , man and wife . The Vengeance assisted in the conversation , like a regular member of the establishment . As Carton walked in , took his seat and asked ( in very indifferent French ) for a small measure of wine , Madame Defarge cast a careless glance at him , and then a keener , and then a keener , and then advanced to him herself , and asked him what it was he had ordered . He repeated what he had already said . “
150632	150676	150279	150284	such a man as I here	4506	” asked Madame Defarge , inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows . After looking at her , as if the sound of even a single French word were slow to express itself to him , he answered , in his former strong foreign accent . “
150687	150724	150725	150725	I	0	” Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine , and , as he took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning , he heard her say , “
150733	150746	150731	150731	Evrémonde	248	” Defarge brought him the wine , and gave him Good Evening . “
150749	150750	150731	150731	Evrémonde	248	” “
150754	150755	150731	150731	Evrémonde	248	” “
150763	150768	150761	150761	citizen	3357	” filling his glass . “
150781	150792	150778	150779	the Republic	3844	” Defarge went back to the counter , and said , “
150799	150804	150805	150805	I	0	” Madame sternly retorted , “
150813	150819	150805	150805	I	0	” Jacques Three pacifically remarked , “
150833	150843	150831	150831	madame	5936	” The amiable Vengeance added , with a laugh , “
150867	150936	150941	150941	madame	5936	” Carton followed the lines and words of his paper , with a slow forefinger , and with a studious and absorbed face . They were all leaning their arms on the counter close together , speaking low . After a silence of a few moments , during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor , they resumed their conversation . “
150944	150949	150941	150941	madame	5936	” observed Jacques Three . “
150963	150964	150941	150941	madame	5936	” “
150969	150973	150941	150941	madame	5936	” reasoned Defarge , “
150989	150990	150941	150941	madame	5936	” “
150994	150998	150941	150941	madame	5936	” said madame . “
151001	151014	150941	150941	madame	5936	” croaked Jacques Three . The Vengeance , also , highly approved . “
151023	151030	151020	151021	my wife	5044	” said Defarge , rather troubled ; “
151066	151067	151055	151055	you	5044	” “
151074	151082	151068	151068	I	0	” repeated madame , contemptuously and angrily . “
151117	151118	151110	151110	him	4996	” “
151127	151136	151120	151120	you	5044	” said Defarge , in a deprecatory manner , “
151152	151153	151154	151154	I	0	” “
151160	151164	151154	151154	I	0	” repeated madame ; “
151221	151260	151261	151262	The citizeness	4527	” She seemed to raise it ( the listener ’s eyes were always on his paper ) , and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her , as if the axe had dropped . “
151266	151271	151272	151272	She	889	” croaked the Juryman . “
151277	151286	151274	151275	an Angel	2822	” said The Vengeance , and embraced her . “
151291	151301	151289	151289	thee	4529	” pursued madame , implacably , addressing her husband , “
151324	151325	151316	151316	thou	4529	” “
151328	151332	151316	151316	thou	4529	” protested Defarge . “
151357	151358	151351	151351	I	0	” “
151365	151372	151363	151363	Jacques	148	” said Madame Defarge , wrathfully ; “
151422	151423	151415	151416	my husband	5455	” “
151428	151436	151415	151416	my husband	5455	” assented Defarge , without being asked . “
151503	151504	151497	151497	him	5455	” “
151509	151513	151517	151517	I	0	” assented Defarge . “
151566	151567	151560	151560	him	5455	” “
151572	151577	151578	151578	I	0	” assented Defarge again . “
151711	151712	151705	151705	him	2794	” “
151717	151723	151705	151705	him	2794	” assented Defarge once more . “
151733	151737	151705	151705	him	2794	” returned madame ; “
151744	151814	151705	151705	him	2794	” Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath -- the listener could feel how white she was , without seeing her -- and both highly commended it . Defarge , a weak minority , interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis ; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply . “
151828	152242	152243	152243	I	0	” Customers entered , and the group was broken up . The English customer paid for what he had had , perplexedly counted his change , and asked , as a stranger , to be directed towards the National Palace . Madame Defarge took him to the door , and put her arm on his , in pointing out the road . The English customer was not without his reflections then , that it might be a good deed to seize that arm , lift it , and strike under it sharp and deep . But , he went his way , and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall . At the appointed hour , he emerged from it to present himself in Mr. Lorry ’s room again , where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety . He said he had been with Lucie until just now , and had only left her for a few minutes , to come and keep his appointment . Her father had not been seen , since he quitted the banking - house towards four o’clock . She had some faint hopes that his mediation might save Charles , but they were very slight . He had been more than five hours gone : where could he be ? Mr. Lorry waited until ten ; but , Doctor Manette not returning , and he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer , it was arranged that he should go back to her , and come to the banking - house again at midnight . In the meanwhile , Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor . He waited and waited , and the clock struck twelve ; but Doctor Manette did not come back . Mr. Lorry returned , and found no tidings of him , and brought none . Where could he be ? They were discussing this question , and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence , when they heard him on the stairs . The instant he entered the room , it was plain that all was lost . Whether he had really been to any one , or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets , was never known . As he stood staring at them , they asked him no question , for his face told them everything . “
152249	152253	152255	152255	I	0	” said he , “
152264	152299	152255	152255	I	0	” His head and throat were bare , and , as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around , he took his coat off , and let it drop on the floor . “
152338	152352	152332	152332	I	0	” They looked at one another , and their hearts died within them . “
152357	152367	152332	152332	I	0	” said he , in a whimpering miserable way ; “
152379	152402	152332	152332	I	0	” Receiving no answer , he tore his hair , and beat his feet upon the ground , like a distracted child . “
152411	152421	152332	152332	I	0	” he implored them , with a dreadful cry ; “
152445	152629	152649	152649	her	4560	” Lost , utterly lost ! It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him , or try to restore him , that -- as if by agreement -- they each put a hand upon his shoulder , and soothed him to sit down before the fire , with a promise that he should have his work presently . He sank into the chair , and brooded over the embers , and shed tears . As if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy , or a dream , Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping . Affected , and impressed with terror as they both were , by this spectacle of ruin , it was not a time to yield to such emotions . His lonely daughter , bereft of her final hope and reliance , appealed to them both too strongly . Again , as if by agreement , they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces . Carton was the first to speak : “
152703	152704	152705	152705	I	0	” “
152711	152716	152705	152705	I	0	” answered Mr. Lorry . “
152720	152827	152705	152705	I	0	” The figure in the chair between them , was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro , and moaning . They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick - bed in the night . Carton stooped to pick up the coat , which lay almost entangling his feet . As he did so , a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to carry the lists of his day ’s duties , fell lightly on the floor . Carton took it up , and there was a folded paper in it . “
152834	152851	152828	152828	We	4562	” he said . Mr. Lorry nodded his consent . He opened it , and exclaimed , “
152857	152858	152854	152854	God	149	” “
152863	152870	152854	152854	God	149	” asked Mr. Lorry , eagerly . “
152885	152901	152828	152828	We	4562	” he put his hand in his coat , and took another paper from it , “
152929	152945	152926	152927	an Englishman	5026	” Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand , gazing in his earnest face . “
152977	152978	152967	152967	I	0	” “
152982	152983	152967	152967	I	0	” “

153143	153144	153137	153137	They	4570	” “
153247	153252	153240	153241	Madame Defarge	146	Her”--he never mentioned Lucie ’s name--“making

153475	153485	153448	153448	You	0	” touching the back of the Doctor ’s chair , “

153561	153584	153603	153603	her	3973	” His manner was so fervent and inspiring , that Mr. Lorry caught the flame , and was as quick as youth . “
153641	153654	153628	153628	she	3973	” He faltered for an instant ; then went on as before . “
153731	153732	153728	153728	you	0	” “

153841	153856	153800	153800	You	0	” said Mr. Lorry , grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand , “
153880	153881	153871	153875	a young and ardent man	4603	” “

153985	155303	153978	153978	mine	0	” Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness , and though he even put the old man ’s hand to his lips , he did not part from him then . He helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers , as to get a cloak and hat put upon it , and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have . He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart -- so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it -- outwatched the awful night . He entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone , looking up at the light in the window of her room . Before he went away , he breathed a blessing towards it , and a Farewell . CHAPTER XIII . Fifty - two In the black prison of the Conciergerie , the doomed of the day awaited their fate . They were in number as the weeks of the year . Fifty - two were to roll that afternoon on the life - tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea . Before their cells were quit of them , new occupants were appointed ; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday , the blood that was to mingle with theirs to - morrow was already set apart . Two score and twelve were told off . From the farmer - general of seventy , whose riches could not buy his life , to the seamstress of twenty , whose poverty and obscurity could not save her . Physical diseases , engendered in the vices and neglects of men , will seize on victims of all degrees ; and the frightful moral disorder , born of unspeakable suffering , intolerable oppression , and heartless indifference , smote equally without distinction . Charles Darnay , alone in a cell , had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal . In every line of the narrative he had heard , he had heard his condemnation . He had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him , that he was virtually sentenced by the millions , and that units could avail him nothing . Nevertheless , it was not easy , with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him , to compose his mind to what it must bear . His hold on life was strong , and it was very , very hard , to loosen ; by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here , it clenched the tighter there ; and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded , this was closed again . There was a hurry , too , in all his thoughts , a turbulent and heated working of his heart , that contended against resignation . If , for a moment , he did feel resigned , then his wife and child who had to live after him , seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing . But , all this was at first . Before long , the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet , and that numbers went the same road wrongfully , and trod it firmly every day , sprang up to stimulate him . Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones , depended on his quiet fortitude . So , by degrees he calmed into the better state , when he could raise his thoughts much higher , and draw comfort down . Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation , he had travelled thus far on his last way . Being allowed to purchase the means of writing , and a light , he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished . He wrote a long letter to Lucie , showing her that he had known nothing of her father ’s imprisonment , until he had heard of it from herself , and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father ’s and uncle ’s responsibility for that misery , until the paper had been read . He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished , was the one condition -- fully intelligible now -- that her father had attached to their betrothal , and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage . He entreated her , for her father ’s sake , never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper , or had had it recalled to him ( for the moment , or for good ) , by the story of the Tower , on that old Sunday under the dear old plane - tree in the garden . If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it , there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille , when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there , and which had been described to all the world . He besought her -- though he added that he knew it was needless -- to console her father , by impressing him through every tender means she could think of , with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself , but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes . Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing , and her overcoming of her sorrow , to devote herself to their dear child , he adjured her , as they would meet in Heaven , to comfort her father . To her father himself , he wrote in the same strain ; but , he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care . And he told him this , very strongly , with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending . To Mr. Lorry , he commended them all , and explained his worldly affairs . That done , with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment , all was done . He never thought of Carton . His mind was so full of the others , that he never once thought of him . He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out . When he lay down on his straw bed , he thought he had done with this world . But , it beckoned him back in his sleep , and showed itself in shining forms . Free and happy , back in the old house in Soho ( though it had nothing in it like the real house ) , unaccountably released and light of heart , he was with Lucie again , and she told him it was all a dream , and he had never gone away . A pause of forgetfulness , and then he had even suffered , and had come back to her , dead and at peace , and yet there was no difference in him . Another pause of oblivion , and he awoke in the sombre morning , unconscious where he was or what had happened , until it flashed upon his mind , “
155312	155779	153978	153978	mine	0	” Thus , had he come through the hours , to the day when the fifty - two heads were to fall . And now , while he was composed , and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism , a new action began in his waking thoughts , which was very difficult to master . He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life . How high it was from the ground , how many steps it had , where he would be stood , how he would be touched , whether the touching hands would be dyed red , which way his face would be turned , whether he would be the first , or might be the last : these and many similar questions , in nowise directed by his will , obtruded themselves over and over again , countless times . Neither were they connected with fear : he was conscious of no fear . Rather , they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came ; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred ; a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his , than his own . The hours went on as he walked to and fro , and the clocks struck the numbers he would never hear again . Nine gone for ever , ten gone for ever , eleven gone for ever , twelve coming on to pass away . After a hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him , he had got the better of it . He walked up and down , softly repeating their names to himself . The worst of the strife was over . He could walk up and down , free from distracting fancies , praying for himself and for them . Twelve gone for ever . He had been apprised that the final hour was Three , and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier , inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets . Therefore , he resolved to keep Two before his mind , as the hour , and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able , after that time , to strengthen others . Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast , a very different man from the prisoner , who had walked to and fro at La Force , he heard One struck away from him , without surprise . The hour had measured like most other hours . Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his recovered self - possession , he thought , “
155786	155838	155839	155839	He	4606	” and turned to walk again . Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door . He stopped . The key was put in the lock , and turned . Before the door was opened , or as it opened , a man said in a low voice , in English : “
155867	155968	155859	155859	I	0	” The door was quickly opened and closed , and there stood before him face to face , quiet , intent upon him , with the light of a smile on his features , and a cautionary finger on his lip , Sydney Carton . There was something so bright and remarkable in his look , that , for the first moment , the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining . But , he spoke , and it was his voice ; he took the prisoner ’s hand , and it was his real grasp . “
155983	155987	155976	155976	you	4608	” he said . “
156006	156012	156013	156013	prisoner	7003	not”--the apprehension came suddenly into his mind--“a
156015	156016	156013	156013	prisoner	7003	” “
156054	156061	156062	156062	I	0	” The prisoner wrung his hand . “
156070	156071	156068	156068	her	4611	” “
156076	156077	156068	156068	her	4611	” “
156109	156118	156119	156119	You	4608	” The prisoner turned his face partly aside . “
156164	156207	156144	156144	You	4608	” There was a chair against the wall of the cell , behind the prisoner . Carton , pressing forward , had already , with the speed of lightning , got him down into it , and stood over him , barefoot . “
156229	156230	156231	156231	Carton	177	” “
156258	156259	156273	156273	I	0	” “
156334	156373	156374	156374	Carton	177	” With wonderful quickness , and with a strength both of will and action , that appeared quite supernatural , he forced all these changes upon him . The prisoner was like a young child in his hands . “
156419	156420	156405	156405	I	0	” “
156461	156462	156454	156454	your	4608	” “
156470	156471	156454	156454	your	4608	” “
156489	156520	156485	156485	friend	5569	” Pressing his hand to his bewildered head , Darnay sat down at the table . Carton , with his right hand in his breast , stood close beside him . “
156527	156528	156524	156524	I	0	” “
156536	156537	156532	156532	I	0	” “
156542	156552	156532	156532	I	0	” Carton still had his hand in his breast . “
156558	156559	156554	156554	I	0	” “
156562	156587	156532	156532	I	0	” The prisoner looked up , at each question . Carton , standing over him with his hand in his breast , looked down . “
156594	156600	156532	156532	I	0	” said Carton , dictating , “
156641	156673	156675	156675	you	0	” He was drawing his hand from his breast ; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote , the hand stopped , closing upon something . “
156682	156686	156675	156675	you	0	” Carton asked . “
156698	156699	156702	156702	I	0	” “
156707	156708	156702	156702	I	0	” “
156716	156717	156718	156718	You	5569	” “
156734	156739	156702	156702	I	0	” He dictated again . “
156769	156815	156702	156702	I	0	” As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer , his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer ’s face . The pen dropped from Darnay ’s fingers on the table , and he looked about him vacantly . “
156821	156825	156702	156702	I	0	” he asked . “
156828	156829	156702	156702	I	0	” “
156835	156836	156837	156837	I	0	” “
156860	156913	156702	156702	I	0	” As if his memory were impaired , or his faculties disordered , the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention . As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing , Carton -- his hand again in his breast -- looked steadily at him . “
156918	156929	156702	156702	I	0	” The prisoner bent over the paper , once more . “
156938	156950	156952	156952	I	0	” Carton ’s hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down ; “
156968	156978	156952	156952	I	0	” the hand was at the prisoner ’s face ; “
156999	157144	156952	156952	I	0	” Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs . Carton ’s hand moved back to his breast no more . The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look , but Carton ’s hand was close and firm at his nostrils , and Carton ’s left arm caught him round the waist . For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him ; but , within a minute or so , he was stretched insensible on the ground . Quickly , but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was , Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside , combed back his hair , and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn . Then , he softly called , “
157151	157158	157159	157159	You	4620	” and the Spy presented himself . “
157162	157187	157159	157159	You	4620	” said Carton , looking up , as he kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure , putting the paper in the breast : “
157194	157195	157196	157197	Mr. Carton	172	” “
157199	157212	157196	157197	Mr. Carton	172	” the Spy answered , with a timid snap of his fingers , “
157239	157240	157229	157229	you	172	” “
157254	157255	157256	157256	You	172	” “
157290	157291	157284	157284	I	0	” “
157332	157333	157334	157334	You	172	” “
157336	157342	157343	157343	Him	4622	” said the Spy nervously . “
157366	157367	157353	157353	You	172	” “
157371	157372	157353	157353	You	172	” “
157427	157428	157429	157429	You	172	” “
157436	157450	157429	157429	You	172	” said the trembling Spy , as he paused for a last moment . “
157455	157463	157453	157453	man	5564	” returned Carton , stamping his foot ; “
157542	157571	157532	157532	his	4626	” The Spy withdrew , and Carton seated himself at the table , resting his forehead on his hands . The Spy returned immediately , with two men . “
157576	157587	157532	157532	his	4626	” said one of them , contemplating the fallen figure . “
157606	157607	157608	157610	A good patriot	6917	” “
157612	157617	157608	157610	A good patriot	6917	” said the other , “
157632	157658	157625	157626	the Aristocrat	4631	” They raised the unconscious figure , placed it on a litter they had brought to the door , and bent to carry it away . “
157666	157676	157664	157664	Evrémonde	248	” said the Spy , in a warning voice . “
157682	157686	157677	157677	I	0	” answered Carton . “
157701	157702	157693	157693	I	0	” “
157710	157714	157707	157708	my children	4634	” said Barsad . “
157722	157855	157707	157708	my children	4634	” The door closed , and Carton was left alone . Straining his powers of listening to the utmost , he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm . There was none . Keys turned , doors clashed , footsteps passed along distant passages : no cry was raised , or hurry made , that seemed unusual . Breathing more freely in a little while , he sat down at the table , and listened again until the clock struck Two . Sounds that he was not afraid of , for he divined their meaning , then began to be audible . Several doors were opened in succession , and finally his own . A gaoler , with a list in his hand , looked in , merely saying , “
157861	158061	157859	157859	Evrémonde	248	” and he followed into a large dark room , at a distance . It was a dark winter day , and what with the shadows within , and what with the shadows without , he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound . Some were standing ; some seated . Some were lamenting , and in restless motion ; but , these were few . The great majority were silent and still , looking fixedly at the ground . As he stood by the wall in a dim corner , while some of the fifty - two were brought in after him , one man stopped in passing , to embrace him , as having a knowledge of him . It thrilled him with a great dread of discovery ; but the man went on . A very few moments after that , a young woman , with a slight girlish form , a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour , and large widely opened patient eyes , rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting , and came to speak to him . “
158065	158076	158062	158063	Citizen Evrémonde	272	” she said , touching him with her cold hand . “
158092	158098	158077	158077	I	0	” He murmured for answer : “
158109	158110	158104	158104	you	0	” “
158143	158164	158165	158165	I	0	” The forlorn smile with which she said it , so touched him , that tears started from his eyes . “
158228	158254	158255	158255	I	0	” As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to , it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl . “
158270	158271	158264	158264	I	0	” “
158284	158285	158277	158277	I	0	” “
158324	158365	158367	158367	you	4638	” As the patient eyes were lifted to his face , he saw a sudden doubt in them , and then astonishment . He pressed the work - worn , hunger - worn young fingers , and touched his lips . “
158372	158376	158367	158367	you	4638	” she whispered . “
158387	158388	158390	158390	you	4638	” “
158401	158402	158390	158390	you	4638	” “
158415	158465	158390	158390	you	4638	” * * * * * The same shadows that are falling on the prison , are falling , in that same hour of the early afternoon , on the Barrier with the crowd about it , when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined . “
158477	158487	158488	158489	Alexandre Manette	234	” The papers are handed out , and read . “
158499	158516	158518	158521	the Citizen - Doctor	4650	” This is he ; this helpless , inarticulately murmuring , wandering old man pointed out . “
158541	158548	158518	158521	the Citizen - Doctor	4650	” Greatly too much for him . “
158567	158572	158565	158565	she	889	” This is she . “
158589	158593	158578	158578	Lucie	174	” It is . “
158613	158619	158611	158611	she	889	” She and no other . “
158656	158676	158678	158680	the English advocate	4660	” He lies here , in this corner of the carriage . He , too , is pointed out . “
158686	158725	158678	158680	the English advocate	4660	” It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air . It is represented that he is not in strong health , and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the Republic . “
158768	158769	158772	158772	he	4659	” “
158780	158894	158899	158900	Jarvis Lorry	133	” It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions . It is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door , replying to a group of officials . They leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely mount the box , to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof ; the country - people hanging about , press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in ; a little child , carried by its mother , has its short arm held out for it , that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine . “
158904	158905	158899	158900	Jarvis Lorry	133	” “
158912	158913	158914	158914	One	4965	” “
158927	158928	158929	158929	I	0	” “
158939	158980	158929	158929	I	0	” These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry , as he clasps his hands , and looks upward . There is terror in the carriage , there is weeping , there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller . “
158997	159007	158989	158989	they	4669	” asks Lucie , clinging to the old man . “
159030	159031	159017	159017	I	0	” “
159045	159046	159017	159017	I	0	” “
159063	159437	159468	159468	they	4675	” Houses in twos and threes pass by us , solitary farms , ruinous buildings , dye - works , tanneries , and the like , open country , avenues of leafless trees . The hard uneven pavement is under us , the soft deep mud is on either side . Sometimes , we strike into the skirting mud , to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us ; sometimes , we stick in ruts and sloughs there . The agony of our impatience is then so great , that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running -- hiding -- doing anything but stopping . Out of the open country , in again among ruinous buildings , solitary farms , dye - works , tanneries , and the like , cottages in twos and threes , avenues of leafless trees . Have these men deceived us , and taken us back by another road ? Is not this the same place twice over ? Thank Heaven , no . A village . Look back , look back , and see if we are pursued ! Hush ! the posting - house . Leisurely , our four horses are taken out ; leisurely , the coach stands in the little street , bereft of horses , and with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again ; leisurely , the new horses come into visible existence , one by one ; leisurely , the new postilions follow , sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips ; leisurely , the old postilions count their money , make wrong additions , and arrive at dissatisfied results . All the time , our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled . At length the new postilions are in their saddles , and the old are left behind . We are through the village , up the hill , and down the hill , and on the low watery grounds . Suddenly , the postilions exchange speech with animated gesticulation , and the horses are pulled up , almost on their haunches . We are pursued ? “
159448	159449	159468	159468	they	4675	” “
159454	159464	159468	159468	they	4675	” asks Mr. Lorry , looking out at window . “
159471	159472	159468	159468	they	4675	” “
159479	159480	159468	159468	they	4675	” “
159495	159496	159468	159468	they	4675	” “
159501	159502	159468	159468	they	4675	” “
159544	159762	159765	159765	Defarge	146	” The night comes on dark . He moves more ; he is beginning to revive , and to speak intelligibly ; he thinks they are still together ; he asks him , by his name , what he has in his hand . O pity us , kind Heaven , and help us ! Look out , look out , and see if we are pursued . The wind is rushing after us , and the clouds are flying after us , and the moon is plunging after us , and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us ; but , so far , we are pursued by nothing else . CHAPTER XIV . The Knitting Done In that same juncture of time when the Fifty - Two awaited their fate Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury . Not in the wine - shop did Madame Defarge confer with these ministers , but in the shed of the wood - sawyer , erst a mender of roads . The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference , but abided at a little distance , like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required , or to offer an opinion until invited . “
159767	159772	159765	159765	Defarge	146	” said Jacques Three , “
159781	159782	159775	159777	a good Republican	4657	” “
159788	159798	159775	159777	a good Republican	4657	” the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill notes , “
159802	159803	159775	159777	a good Republican	4657	” “
159809	159827	159829	159829	me	0	” said Madame Defarge , laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenant ’s lips , “
159880	159881	159869	159869	he	5455	” “
159888	159907	159913	159915	a good citizen	6464	” croaked Jacques Three , dubiously shaking his head , with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth ; “
159924	159925	159927	159927	you	4688	” “
159929	159933	159927	159927	you	4688	” said madame , “
159988	159989	159990	159990	She	4996	” “
159998	160003	159990	159990	She	4996	” croaked Jacques Three . “
160024	160048	160019	160019	Samson	283	” Ogre that he was , he spoke like an epicure . Madame Defarge cast down her eyes , and reflected a little . “
160053	160066	160049	160050	The child	3495	” observed Jacques Three , with a meditative enjoyment of his words , “
160088	160089	160019	160019	Samson	283	” “
160094	160106	160019	160019	Samson	283	” said Madame Defarge , coming out of her short abstraction , “
160163	160164	160153	160153	his	5455	” “
160170	160175	160153	160153	his	5455	” croaked Jacques Three ; “
160199	160200	160229	160229	his	5455	” “
160205	160211	160229	160229	his	5455	” Madame Defarge went on , “
160253	160285	160250	160251	little citizen	4704	” The wood - sawyer , who held her in the respect , and himself in the submission , of mortal fear , advanced with his hand to his red cap . “
160293	160300	160302	160302	she	4996	” said Madame Defarge , sternly , “
160320	160321	160308	160308	you	4704	” “
160329	160334	160308	160308	you	4704	” cried the sawyer . “
160372	160403	160365	160365	I	0	” He made all manner of gestures while he spoke , as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen . “
160407	160412	160365	160365	I	0	” said Jacques Three . “
160415	160416	160422	160423	the Jury	1124	” “
160425	160441	160422	160423	the Jury	1124	” inquired Madame Defarge , letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile . “
160459	160460	160451	160451	I	0	” “
160467	160475	160451	160451	I	0	” said Madame Defarge , pondering again . “
160501	160502	160503	160503	He	4996	” “
160510	160520	160503	160503	He	4996	” observed Jacques Three , in a low voice . “
160537	160538	160539	160539	He	4996	” “
160549	160554	160539	160539	He	4996	” argued Madame Defarge ; “
160594	160636	160587	160587	I	0	” The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses . The little citizen , not to be outdone , declared her to be a celestial witness . “
160643	160648	160637	160637	He	4996	” said Madame Defarge . “
160677	160795	160796	160796	I	0	” The question was addressed to the wood - sawyer , who hurriedly replied in the affirmative : seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of Republicans , and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans , if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber . He was so very demonstrative herein , that he might have been suspected ( perhaps was , by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge ’s head ) of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety , every hour in the day . “
160798	160802	160796	160796	I	0	” said madame , “
160844	160923	160924	160924	She	4720	” The wood - sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness . The citizeness looking at him , he became embarrassed , evaded her glance as a small dog would have done , retreated among his wood , and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw . Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to the door , and there expounded her further views to them thus : “
160977	160978	160971	160971	I	0	” “
160989	160996	160985	160987	an adorable woman	4727	” exclaimed Jacques Three , rapturously . “
161002	161011	160971	160971	I	0	” cried The Vengeance ; and embraced her . “
161017	161030	160971	160971	I	0	” said Madame Defarge , placing it in her lieutenant ’s hands , “
161069	161070	161071	161071	I	0	” “
161080	161092	161093	161093	You	0	” said The Vengeance with alacrity , and kissing her cheek . “
161099	161100	161101	161101	I	0	” “
161109	161110	161101	161101	I	0	” “
161126	161144	161119	161119	you	4729	” said The Vengeance , calling after her , for she had already turned into the street , “
161150	161935	161939	161939	you	4732	” Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand , to imply that she heard , and might be relied upon to arrive in good time , and so went through the mud , and round the corner of the prison wall . The Vengeance and the Juryman , looking after her as she walked away , were highly appreciative of her fine figure , and her superb moral endowments . There were many women at that time , upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand ; but , there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman , now taking her way along the streets . Of a strong and fearless character , of shrewd sense and readiness , of great determination , of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity , but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities ; the troubled time would have heaved her up , under any circumstances . But , imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong , and an inveterate hatred of a class , opportunity had developed her into a tigress . She was absolutely without pity . If she had ever had the virtue in her , it had quite gone out of her . It was nothing to her , that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers ; she saw , not him , but them . It was nothing to her , that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan ; that was insufficient punishment , because they were her natural enemies and her prey , and as such had no right to live . To appeal to her , was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity , even for herself . If she had been laid low in the streets , in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged , she would not have pitied herself ; nor , if she had been ordered to the axe to - morrow , would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there . Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe . Carelessly worn , it was a becoming robe enough , in a certain weird way , and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap . Lying hidden in her bosom , was a loaded pistol . Lying hidden at her waist , was a sharpened dagger . Thus accoutred , and walking with the confident tread of such a character , and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood , bare - foot and bare - legged , on the brown sea - sand , Madame Defarge took her way along the streets . Now , when the journey of the travelling coach , at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load , had been planned out last night , the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry ’s attention . It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach , but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers , should be reduced to the utmost ; since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there . Finally , he had proposed , after anxious consideration , that Miss Pross and Jerry , who were at liberty to leave the city , should leave it at three o’clock in the lightest - wheeled conveyance known to that period . Unencumbered with luggage , they would soon overtake the coach , and , passing it and preceding it on the road , would order its horses in advance , and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night , when delay was the most to be dreaded . Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency , Miss Pross hailed it with joy . She and Jerry had beheld the coach start , had known who it was that Solomon brought , had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense , and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach , even as Madame Defarge , taking her way through the streets , now drew nearer and nearer to the else - deserted lodging in which they held their consultation . “
161945	161970	161939	161939	you	4732	” said Miss Pross , whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak , or stand , or move , or live : “
161999	162000	161973	161973	you	4732	” “
162006	162011	162014	162014	you	4912	” returned Mr. Cruncher , “
162030	162031	162032	162032	I	0	” “
162045	162053	162032	162032	I	0	” said Miss Pross , wildly crying , “
162079	162080	162076	162077	Mr. Cruncher	156	” “
162092	162097	162090	162090	miss	4912	” returned Mr. Cruncher , “
162153	162154	162123	162123	you	4912	” “
162161	162170	162123	162123	you	4912	” cried Miss Pross , still wildly crying , “
162189	162190	162185	162187	an excellent man	4741	” “
162193	162215	162185	162187	an excellent man	4741	” said Mr. Cruncher , who was all in a tremble , and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage , “
162237	162238	162239	162239	I	0	” “
162247	162252	162239	162239	I	0	” returned Miss Pross , “
162282	162283	162286	162286	miss	4912	” “
162288	162292	162286	162286	miss	4912	” returned Jerry , “
162329	162330	162320	162321	Mrs. Cruncher	155	” “
162338	162352	162320	162321	Mrs. Cruncher	155	” said Miss Pross , striving to dry her eyes and compose herself , “
162375	162376	162377	162377	I	0	” “
162389	162405	162377	162377	I	0	” proceeded Mr. Cruncher , with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--“and
162454	162455	162443	162444	Mrs. Cruncher	155	” “
162471	162478	162462	162462	I	0	” cried the distracted Miss Pross , “
162489	162490	162480	162480	I	0	” “
162494	162516	162480	162480	I	0	” proceeded Mr. Cruncher , with additional solemnity , additional slowness , and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out , “
162578	162614	162571	162571	I	0	” This was Mr. Cruncher ’s conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one . And still Madame Defarge , pursuing her way along the streets , came nearer and nearer . “
162625	162630	162571	162571	I	0	” said Miss Pross , “
162698	162716	162691	162692	Mr. Cruncher	156	” Still , Madame Defarge , pursuing her way along the streets , came nearer and nearer . “
162724	162729	162718	162718	you	4752	” said Miss Pross , “
162754	162763	162766	162766	you	4752	” Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best . “
162771	162811	162766	162766	you	4752	” asked Miss Pross . Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but Temple Bar . Alas ! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away , and Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed . “
162817	162822	162766	162766	you	4752	” said Miss Pross . “
162847	162848	162851	162851	miss	4912	” “
162853	162858	162851	162851	miss	4912	” answered Mr. Cruncher . “
162867	162872	162851	162851	miss	4912	” said Miss Pross , “
162886	162887	162888	162888	I	0	” “
162892	162903	162888	162888	I	0	” said Mr. Cruncher , hesitating and shaking his head , “
162920	162921	162912	162912	We	4758	” “
162928	162933	162912	162912	We	4758	” returned Miss Pross , “
163006	163288	163289	163292	The wife of Evrémonde	4653	” This exordium , and Miss Pross ’s two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his , decided Mr. Cruncher . With an encouraging nod or two , he immediately went out to alter the arrangements , and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed . The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution , was a great relief to Miss Pross . The necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets , was another relief . She looked at her watch , and it was twenty minutes past two . She had no time to lose , but must get ready at once . Afraid , in her extreme perturbation , of the loneliness of the deserted rooms , and of half - imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them , Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes , which were swollen and red . Haunted by her feverish apprehensions , she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water , but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her . In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out , for she saw a figure standing in the room . The basin fell to the ground broken , and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge . By strange stern ways , and through much staining blood , those feet had come to meet that water . Madame Defarge looked coldly at her , and said , “
163298	163426	163292	163292	Evrémonde	272	” It flashed upon Miss Pross ’s mind that the doors were all standing open , and would suggest the flight . Her first act was to shut them . There were four in the room , and she shut them all . She then placed herself before the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied . Madame Defarge ’s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement , and rested on her when it was finished . Miss Pross had nothing beautiful about her ; years had not tamed the wildness , or softened the grimness , of her appearance ; but , she too was a determined woman in her different way , and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes , every inch . “
163440	163449	163427	163427	You	4762	” said Miss Pross , in her breathing . “
163466	163554	163463	163464	an Englishwoman	4764	” Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully , but still with something of Miss Pross ’s own perception that they two were at bay . She saw a tight , hard , wiry woman before her , as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand , in the years gone by . She knew full well that Miss Pross was the family ’s devoted friend ; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family ’s malevolent enemy . “
163560	163577	163579	163579	they	4765	” said Madame Defarge , with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot , “
163607	163608	163605	163605	her	4766	” “
163617	163622	163612	163612	your	0	” said Miss Pross , “
163638	163673	163633	163633	my	0	” Each spoke in her own language ; neither understood the other ’s words ; both were very watchful , and intent to deduce from look and manner , what the unintelligible words meant . “
163690	163695	163677	163677	her	4766	” said Madame Defarge . “
163723	163724	163720	163720	you	0	” “
163735	163740	163729	163729	yours	0	” returned Miss Pross , “
163771	163802	163766	163766	I	0	” Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail ; but , she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught . “
163810	163817	163818	163818	I	0	” said Madame Defarge , frowning . “
163857	163870	163871	163871	I	0	” This , with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm . “
163875	163880	163893	163893	I	0	” said Miss Pross , “
163920	163962	163909	163909	you	0	” Neither of them for a single moment released the other ’s eyes . Madame Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross first became aware of her ; but , she now advanced one step . “
163968	163973	163974	163974	I	0	” said Miss Pross , “
164029	164108	164022	164022	you	0	” Thus Miss Pross , with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence , and every rapid sentence a whole breath . Thus Miss Pross , who had never struck a blow in her life . But , her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes . This was a courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness . “
164113	164117	164022	164022	you	0	” she laughed , “
164134	164144	164131	164132	that Doctor	4464	” Then she raised her voice and called out , “
164168	164217	164164	164166	the Citizeness Defarge	294	” Perhaps the following silence , perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross ’s face , perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion , whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone . Three of the doors she opened swiftly , and looked in . “
164254	164255	164251	164251	me	0	” “
164258	164276	164251	164251	me	0	” said Miss Pross , who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer . “
164297	164304	164251	164251	me	0	” said Madame Defarge to herself . “
164328	164335	164321	164321	you	0	” said Miss Pross to herself ; “
164371	164372	164373	164373	I	0	” “
164404	164409	164396	164396	I	0	” said Madame Defarge . “
164460	164604	164434	164434	I	0	” said Miss Pross . Madame Defarge made at the door . Miss Pross , on the instinct of the moment , seized her round the waist in both her arms , and held her tight . It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike ; Miss Pross , with the vigorous tenacity of love , always so much stronger than hate , clasped her tight , and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had . The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her face ; but , Miss Pross , with her head down , held her round the waist , and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman . Soon , Madame Defarge ’s hands ceased to strike , and felt at her encircled waist . “
164611	164620	164621	164621	you	4794	” said Miss Pross , in smothered tones , “
164652	165056	164639	164639	I	0	” Madame Defarge ’s hands were at her bosom . Miss Pross looked up , saw what it was , struck at it , struck out a flash and a crash , and stood alone -- blinded with smoke . All this was in a second . As the smoke cleared , leaving an awful stillness , it passed out on the air , like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground . In the first fright and horror of her situation , Miss Pross passed the body as far from it as she could , and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help . Happily , she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did , in time to check herself and go back . It was dreadful to go in at the door again ; but , she did go in , and even went near it , to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear . These she put on , out on the staircase , first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key . She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry , and then got up and hurried away . By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet , or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped . By good fortune , too , she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman . She needed both advantages , for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face , and her hair was torn , and her dress ( hastily composed with unsteady hands ) was clutched and dragged a hundred ways . In crossing the bridge , she dropped the door key in the river . Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort , and waiting there , she thought , what if the key were already taken in a net , what if it were identified , what if the door were opened and the remains discovered , what if she were stopped at the gate , sent to prison , and charged with murder ! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts , the escort appeared , took her in , and took her away . “
165065	165070	164639	164639	I	0	” she asked him . “
165075	165091	164639	164639	I	0	” Mr. Cruncher replied ; and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect . “
165098	165103	165092	165092	I	0	” said Miss Pross . “
165109	165130	165106	165106	you	4797	” It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said ; Miss Pross could not hear him . “
165138	165145	165132	165132	I	0	” thought Mr. Cruncher , amazed , “
165154	165159	165149	165149	she	4798	” And she did . “
165169	165184	165185	165185	I	0	” asked Miss Pross again , presently . Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head . “
165191	165192	165185	165185	I	0	” “
165199	165212	165149	165149	she	4798	” said Mr. Cruncher , ruminating , with his mind much disturbed ; “
165219	165220	165221	165221	I	0	” “
165224	165229	165221	165221	I	0	” said Miss Pross , “
165256	165257	165221	165221	I	0	” “
165268	165278	165221	165221	I	0	” said Mr. Cruncher , more and more disturbed . “
165312	165313	165305	165305	You	0	” “
165318	165330	165305	165305	You	0	” said Miss Pross , seeing that he spoke to her , “
165375	165376	165378	165378	she	4798	” “
165397	165407	165378	165378	she	4798	” said Mr. Cruncher , glancing over his shoulder , “
165424	165675	165414	165414	she	4798	” And indeed she never did . CHAPTER XV . The Footsteps Die Out For Ever Along the Paris streets , the death - carts rumble , hollow and harsh . Six tumbrils carry the day ’s wine to La Guillotine . All the devouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself , are fused in the one realisation , Guillotine . And yet there is not in France , with its rich variety of soil and climate , a blade , a leaf , a root , a sprig , a peppercorn , which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror . Crush humanity out of shape once more , under similar hammers , and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms . Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again , and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind . Six tumbrils roll along the streets . Change these back again to what they were , thou powerful enchanter , Time , and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs , the equipages of feudal nobles , the toilettes of flaring Jezebels , the churches that are not my father ’s house but dens of thieves , the huts of millions of starving peasants ! No ; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the Creator , never reverses his transformations . “
165689	165703	165414	165414	she	4798	” say the seers to the enchanted , in the wise Arabian stories , “
165726	166278	166280	166280	he	4805	” Changeless and hopeless , the tumbrils roll along . As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round , they seem to plough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets . Ridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that , and the ploughs go steadily onward . So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle , that in many windows there are no people , and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended , while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils . Here and there , the inmate has visitors to see the sight ; then he points his finger , with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent , to this cart and to this , and seems to tell who sat here yesterday , and who there the day before . Of the riders in the tumbrils , some observe these things , and all things on their last roadside , with an impassive stare ; others , with a lingering interest in the ways of life and men . Some , seated with drooping heads , are sunk in silent despair ; again , there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres , and in pictures . Several close their eyes , and think , or try to get their straying thoughts together . Only one , and he a miserable creature , of a crazed aspect , is so shattered and made drunk by horror , that he sings , and tries to dance . Not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture , to the pity of the people . There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils , and faces are often turned up to some of them , and they are asked some question . It would seem to be always the same question , for , it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart . The horsemen abreast of that cart , frequently point out one man in it with their swords . The leading curiosity is , to know which is he ; he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down , to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart , and holds his hand . He has no curiosity or care for the scene about him , and always speaks to the girl . Here and there in the long street of St. Honore , cries are raised against him . If they move him at all , it is only to a quiet smile , as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face . He can not easily touch his face , his arms being bound . On the steps of a church , awaiting the coming - up of the tumbrils , stands the Spy and prison - sheep . He looks into the first of them : not there . He looks into the second : not there . He already asks himself , “
166284	166297	166280	166280	he	4805	” when his face clears , as he looks into the third . “
166302	166309	166300	166300	Evrémonde	272	” says a man behind him . “
166317	166318	166320	166320	his	4805	” “
166327	166328	166320	166320	his	4805	” “
166331	166336	166320	166320	his	4805	” The man cries , “
166351	166352	166342	166343	the Guillotine	3937	” “
166357	166365	166342	166343	the Guillotine	3937	” the Spy entreats him , timidly . “
166372	166373	166374	166374	He	4805	” “
166397	166405	166320	166320	his	4805	” But the man continuing to exclaim , “
166410	166549	166320	166320	his	4805	” the face of Evrémonde is for a moment turned towards him . Evrémonde then sees the Spy , and looks attentively at him , and goes his way . The clocks are on the stroke of three , and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round , to come on into the place of execution , and end . The ridges thrown to this side and to that , now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on , for all are following to the Guillotine . In front of it , seated in chairs , as in a garden of public diversion , are a number of women , busily knitting . On one of the fore - most chairs , stands The Vengeance , looking about for her friend . “
166552	166561	166320	166320	his	4805	” she cries , in her shrill tones . “
166570	166571	166572	166572	She	4805	” “
166577	166587	166572	166572	She	4805	” says a knitting - woman of the sisterhood . “
166596	166603	166572	166572	She	4805	” cries The Vengeance , petulantly . “
166606	166607	166572	166572	She	4805	” “
166610	166694	166572	166572	She	4805	” the woman recommends . Ay ! Louder , Vengeance , much louder , and still she will scarcely hear thee . Louder yet , Vengeance , with a little oath or so added , and yet it will hardly bring her . Send other women up and down to seek her , lingering somewhere ; and yet , although the messengers have done dread deeds , it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her ! “
166698	166710	166572	166572	She	4805	” cries The Vengeance , stamping her foot in the chair , “
166753	166908	166746	166746	I	0	” As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it , the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads . The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are robed and ready . Crash!--A head is held up , and the knitting - women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak , count One . The second tumbril empties and moves on ; the third comes up . Crash!--And the knitting - women , never faltering or pausing in their Work , count Two . The supposed Evrémonde descends , and the seamstress is lifted out next after him . He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out , but still holds it as he promised . He gently places her with her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls , and she looks into his face and thanks him . “
166976	166977	166974	166974	Heaven	225	” “
166983	166988	166979	166979	you	4810	” says Sydney Carton . “
167004	167005	167006	167006	I	0	” “
167030	167031	167020	167020	I	0	” “
167040	167113	167114	167117	Brave and generous friend	4817	” The two stand in the fast - thinning throng of victims , but they speak as if they were alone . Eye to eye , voice to voice , hand to hand , heart to heart , these two children of the Universal Mother , else so wide apart and differing , have come together on the dark highway , to repair home together , and to rest in her bosom . “
167143	167144	167155	167156	a cousin	4818	” “
167151	167152	167155	167156	a cousin	4818	” “
167231	167232	167200	167200	she	4818	” “
167242	167243	167200	167200	she	4818	” “
167319	167320	167324	167326	my gentle sister	4827	” “
167328	167329	167331	167331	you	4827	” “
167334	167360	167331	167331	you	4827	” the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance , fill with tears , and the lips part a little more and tremble : “
167390	167391	167397	167398	my child	2642	” “
167411	167412	167413	167413	You	4825	” “
167436	167437	167425	167425	I	0	” “
167440	167499	167425	167425	I	0	” She kisses his lips ; he kisses hers ; they solemnly bless each other . The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it ; nothing worse than a sweet , bright constancy is in the patient face . She goes next before him -- is gone ; the knitting - women count Twenty - Two . “
167539	167687	167688	167688	I	0	” The murmuring of many voices , the upturning of many faces , the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd , so that it swells forward in a mass , like one great heave of water , all flashes away . Twenty - Three . * * * * * They said of him , about the city that night , that it was the peacefullest man ’s face ever beheld there . Many added that he looked sublime and prophetic . One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe -- a woman -- had asked at the foot of the same scaffold , not long before , to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her . If he had given any utterance to his , and they were prophetic , they would have been these : “
167803	167907	167908	167908	I	0	“ I see the lives for which I lay down my life , peaceful , useful , prosperous and happy , in that England which I shall see no more . I see Her with a child upon her bosom , who bears my name . I see her father , aged and bent , but otherwise restored , and faithful to all men in his healing office , and at peace . I see the good old man , so long their friend , in ten years ’ time enriching them with all he has , and passing tranquilly to his reward . “
167996	168130	167970	167970	I	0	“ I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name , a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine . I see him winning it so well , that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his . I see the blots I threw upon it , faded away . I see him , fore - most of just judges and honoured men , bringing a boy of my name , with a forehead that I know and golden hair , to this place -- then fair to look upon , with not a trace of this day ’s disfigurement -- and I hear him tell the child my story , with a tender and a faltering voice . “
