Once , in England , we went to stay with the Duke of Humber , at Humber Castle -- one of those huge parties , royalties and everything -- golf and polo all day , and a ball every night ; and , will you believe it , _ we had to walk up and down stairs _ ! I do n't know what English people are made of . I suppose they 've never been used to what we call comfort . The second day I told Herman I could n't stand those awful slippery stairs after two rounds of golf , and dancing till four in the morning . It was simply destroying my heart -- the doctor has warned me so often ! I wanted to leave right away -- but Herman said it would offend the Duke . The Duke 's such a sweet old man .

40524	40541	40517	40518	The girl	299	" But all this is weeks away . And meanwhile I 'm afraid -- I'm afraid . "
40542	40571	40517	40518	The girl	299	" Little girls must n't be afraid . If you are , send Lita to _ me _ . I 'm sure it 's just a case of frustration-- "
40572	40575	40517	40518	The girl	299	" Frustration ? "
40576	40629	40630	40630	Pauline	108	" Yes ; the new psychological thing . I 'll take her with me to see Alvah Loft . He 's the great Inspirational Healer . I 've only had three treatments , and it 's miraculous . It does n't take ten minutes , and all one 's burdens are lifted . "
40650	40663	40664	40664	she	108	" I wish I could take you _ all _ to him ! "
40667	40678	40664	40664	she	108	" Well , perhaps you 'd better begin with Lita . "
40698	40720	40721	40721	Pauline	108	" I wish the poor child were more constructive -- but I suppose she 's inherited her father 's legal mind , "

40749	40866	40867	40867	She	1299	" There you are again -- jumping at the conclusion that things will go wrong ! As for Lita , to me it 's a clear case of frustration . She says she wants to express her personality ? Well , every one has the right to do that -- I should think it wrong of me to interfere . That would n't be the way to make Jim happy . What Lita needs is to have her frustrations removed . That will open her eyes to her happiness , and make her see what a perfect home she has . I wonder where my engagement - list is ? Maisie ! ... Oh , here ... "
40876	40952	40953	40953	Nona	102	" I 'll see Lita tomorrow -- I'll make a point of it . We 'll have a friendly simple talk -- perfectly frank and affectionate . Let me see : at what time should I be likely to find her ? ... And , no , of course not , darling ; I would n't think of saying a word to Jim . But your father -- surely I may speak to your father ? "
40956	40970	40971	40971	she	102	" I think father knows about it -- as much as he need , "

41961	41980	41925	41925	He	1340	" Because I never saw you here before . I 've tried often enough to get you to come-- "

42143	42149	42140	42140	He	1340	" Why , have you-- ? "
42150	42188	42089	42089	She	108	" Come about Lita ? Well , yes . She 's been getting rather out of hand , has n't she ? Of course a divorce would kill poor Jim -- otherwise I should n't so much mind-- "
42189	42193	42140	42140	He	1340	" A divorce ? "
42194	42228	42140	42140	He	1340	" Nona tells me it 's Lita 's idea . Foolish child ! I 'm to have a talk with her this afternoon . I came here first to see if Kitty 's influence-- "
42229	42236	42089	42089	She	108	" Oh : Kitty 's influence ! "
42237	42243	42244	42244	She	1348	" Yes ; I know . "
42254	42272	42244	42244	She	1348	" But if you do n't believe in her influence , why did you come here yourself ? "

42432	42496	42497	42497	She	108	" Perhaps she might . What I came for was to say that if Lita does n't quiet down and behave reasonably she may find herself thrown on her aunt 's hands again . I think that will produce an effect on Kitty . I shall make it perfectly clear that they are not to count on me financially if Lita leaves Jim . "
42535	42546	42532	42532	he	1353	" It 's all very unfortunate ... a stupid muddle ... "

43307	43403	43289	43289	her	128	" No , dear ; I mean they were not of the period . I always suspected it , and Dr. Ygrid Bjornsted , the great authority on Nordic art , who was here the other day , told me that the only existing pair is in the Museum at Christiania . So I have sent an order to have them copied . But you _ are _ cold , Pauline ! Shall we go and sit in the kitchen ? We shall be quite by ourselves , because the cook has just given notice . "

43752	43759	43760	43760	she	108	" It was too screamingly funny , "
43825	43881	43822	43823	Stanley Heuston	137	" She did n't hesitate for more than half a second -- just long enough to catch my eye -- then round she jerked , grabbed hold of her last word and fitted it into a beautiful new appeal to the Mothers . Oh -- oh -- oh ! If you could have seen them ! "

44244	44266	44294	44294	he	110	" I know , Exhibit dear . It 'll be jolly enough when you get down there , you and Jim . "
44267	44283	44284	44284	Jim	110	" Yes ; I only wish you were coming too . Why do n't you ? "
44301	44351	44294	44294	he	110	" Because mother and Manford have planned to carry off Lita and the kid to Cedarledge at the same time . Good scheme , is n't it ? I wish I could be in both places at once . We 're all of us fed up with New York . "
44358	44402	44294	44294	he	110	" Look here , my boy , there 's no difficulty about your being in the same place as your wife . I can take my old bones down to Georgia without your help , since Manford 's kind enough to invite me . "
44403	44472	44473	44473	He	1380	" Thanks a lot , dad ; but part of Lita 's holiday is getting away from domestic cares , and I 'm the principal one . She has to order dinner for me . And I do n't say I sha n't like my holiday too ... sand and sun , any amount of 'em . That 's my size at present . No more superhuman efforts . "
44484	44507	44473	44473	He	1380	" But I thought Manford was off to the south too -- to his tarpon ? Is n't this Cedarledge idea new ? "
44508	44550	44551	44551	Wyant	110	" It 's part of his general kindness . He wanted me to go with an easy mind , so he 's chucked his fishing and mobilized the whole group to go and lead the simple life at Cedarledge with Lita . "
44560	44584	44551	44551	Wyant	110	" It 's awfully kind , as you say ; but if my going south is to result in upsetting everybody else 's arrangements-- "

44599	44636	44593	44593	Jim	110	" Manford would hate it if you chucked now ; would n't he , Nona ? And I do want Lita to get away somewhere , and I 'd rather it was to Cedarledge than anywhere . "
44666	44673	44674	44674	he	110	" Jove -- I must jump ! "
44677	44727	44674	44674	he	110	" We 're due at some cabaret show that begins early ; and I believe we dine at Ardwin 's first , with a bunch of freaks . By - bye , Nona ... Stan ... Goodbye , father . Only a fortnight now before we cut it all ! "
44758	44781	44755	44755	Wyant	110	" Look here -- why is Jim being shipped off to the island with me when his wife 's going to Cedarledge ? "
44795	44813	44782	44782	Nona	102	" Simply for the reasons he told you . They both want a holiday from each other . "
44814	44826	44872	44872	he	110	" I do n't believe Jim really wants one from Lita . "
44827	44861	44862	44862	Wyant	110	" Well , so much the worse for Jim . Lita 's temporarily tired of dancing and domesticity , and the doctor says she ought to go off for a while by herself . "
44875	44891	44872	44872	he	110	" Your mother 's doctor told her that once ; and she never came back . "
45019	45028	45029	45029	He	137	" I suppose we 're dining somewhere too-- . "
45032	45034	45029	45029	He	137	" we "
45058	45175	45052	45052	Wyant	110	" Do n't go , Stan . Nona and I have no secrets -- if we had , you should share them . Why do you look so savage , Nona ? I suppose I 've said something stupid ... Fact is , I 'm old - fashioned ; and this idea of people who 've chosen to live together having perpetually to get away from each other ... When I remember my father and mother , for sixty - odd years ... New York in winter , Hudson in summer ... Staple topics : snow for six months , mosquitoes the other . I suppose that 's the reason your generation have got the fidgets ! "
45179	45198	45176	45176	Nona	102	" It 's a good enough reason ; and anyhow there 's nothing to be done about it . "
45202	45245	45199	45199	Wyant	110	" Nothing to be done about it -- in Lita 's case ? I hope you do n't mean that . My son -- God , if ever a man has slaved for a woman , made himself a fool for her ... "
45254	45279	45246	45246	Heuston	137	" Well , sir , you would n't deprive him of man 's peculiar privilege : the right to make a fool of himself ? "
45288	45299	45300	45300	he	110	" I do n't understand you , any of you , "
45311	45355	45357	45357	Nona	102	" Well , Exhibit dear , strictly speaking you do n't have to . We 're old enough to run the show for ourselves , and all you 've got to do is to look on from the front row and admire us , "
45571	45587	45588	45588	she	102	" Oh , well -- it wo n't last ; nothing lasts for our lot , "
45595	45622	45588	45588	she	102	" Or at the worst it will only last as long as I do ; and that 's a date I can fix as I choose . "
45753	45787	45793	45793	Her	102	" Look here , Nona : my dinner - engagement was a fable . Would the heavens fall if you and I went and dined somewhere by ourselves , just as we are ? "
45788	45792	45793	45793	Her	102	" Oh , Stan-- "
45856	45859	45869	45869	Heuston	137	" No . "
45928	45931	45922	45922	She	102	" like the others"--but
46017	46025	46026	46026	she	102	" How mid - Victorian , Stan ! "
46029	46075	46026	46026	she	102	" As if there were any heavens to fall ! Where shall we go ? It will be the greatest fun . Is n't there rather a good little Italian restaurant somewhere near here ? And afterward there 's that nigger dancing at the Housetop . "
46076	46082	46083	46083	She	102	" Come along , then ! "
46170	46180	46181	46181	he	1405	" You really want to go to the Housetop ? "
46354	46363	46364	46364	she	102	" Let 's get some fresh air first , "
46367	46378	46364	46364	she	102	" All right . We 'll walk for a while . "
46421	46431	46432	46432	Nona	102	" Oh , dear -- the Housetop , then ! "
46463	46474	46457	46457	Heuston	137	" A turn , first -- just round the Park ? "

47203	47256	47257	47257	She	102	" Well , do n't that crowd always keep on going to the same shows over and over again ? There 's nothing they hate as much as novelty -- they're so fed up with it ! And besides , what on earth do you care ? They wo n't bother us . "
47266	47275	47257	47257	She	102	" You see , Lita always bothers me . "

58318	58335	58229	58229	she	102	" Imagining things-- . What a complicated world our ancestors lived in , did n't they ? "
58336	58354	58282	58282	she	102	" Well , I do n't know . Mother 's world always seems to me alarmingly simple . "
58358	58401	58355	58355	He	110	" Yes -- that 's pioneering and motor - building , I suppose . It 's the old New York blood that 's so clogged with taboos . Poor father always wants me to behave like a Knight of the Round Table . "
58412	58418	58355	58355	He	110	" How did they behave ? "
58419	58431	58229	58229	she	102	" They were always hitting some other fellow over the head . "
58441	58456	58229	58229	she	102	" Who -- particularly -- does he want you to hit over the head ? "
58457	58485	58355	58355	He	110	" Oh , we have n't got as far as that yet . It 's just the general principle . Anybody who looks too hard at Lita . "
58486	58512	58229	58229	she	102	" You _ would _ have to be hitting about ! Everybody looks hard at Lita . How in the world can she help it ? "
58513	58542	58543	58543	He	1645	" That 's what I tell him . But he says I have n't got the feelings of a gentleman . Guts , he means , I suppose . "
58568	58577	58578	58578	he	1645	" Do you suppose Lita feels that too ? "
58585	58607	58578	58578	he	1645	" That you ought to break people 's heads for her ? She 'd be the first to laugh at you ! "
58608	58626	58627	58627	Nona	102	" So I told him . But he says women despise a man who is n't jealous . "
58640	58647	58648	58648	she	102	" Why should you be jealous ? "
58693	58706	58707	58707	he	1645	" I suppose it 's never got much to do with reasons , "
58713	58727	58707	58707	he	1645	" No ; that 's why it 's so silly -- and ungenerous . "
58728	58770	58707	58707	he	1645	" It does n't matter what it is . She does n't care a hang if I 'm jealous or if I 'm not . She does n't care anything about me . I 've simply ceased to exist for her . "
58771	58783	58707	58707	he	1645	" Well , then you ca n't be in her way . "
58784	58817	58707	58707	he	1645	" It seems I am , though . Because I do exist , for the world ; and as the boy 's father . And the mere idea gets on her nerves . "
58824	58848	58818	58818	Nona	102	" She wants a good deal of elbow - room , does n't she ? And how does she propose to eliminate you ? "
58849	58858	58707	58707	he	1645	" Oh , that 's easy . Divorce . "
58932	58942	58943	58943	He	726	" Old Jim -- it hurts such a lot ? "
58951	58984	58943	58943	He	726	" Hurt ? A fellow can stand being hurt . It ca n't hurt more than feeling her chained to me . But if she goes -- what does she go to ? "
59053	59067	59068	59068	he	726	" I suppose she 's talked to you -- told you her ideas ? "
59074	59088	59071	59071	Nona	102	" Well , what 's to be done : can you tell me ? "
59089	59101	59071	59071	Nona	102	" She must n't go -- we must n't let her . "
59102	59112	59071	59071	Nona	102	" But if she stays -- stays hating me ? "
59113	59122	59071	59071	Nona	102	" Oh , Jim , not _ hating_-- ! "
59123	59140	59071	59071	Nona	102	" You know well enough that she gets to hate anything that does n't amuse her . "
59141	59154	59155	59155	He	726	" But there 's the baby . The baby still amuses her . "
59162	59229	59155	59155	He	726	" Ah , that 's what father says : he calls the baby , poor old chap , my hostage . What rot ! As if I 'd take her baby from her -- and just because she cares for it . If I do n't know how to keep her , I do n't see that I 've got any right to keep her child . "
59343	59356	59374	59374	Her	102	" Oh Jim , how I wish you did n't care so ! "
59391	59396	59397	59397	he	305	" Good old girl ! "
59499	59589	59483	59483	Jim	232	" That 's _ that _ . And now , my child , what can I do ? What I 'd honestly like , if she wants her freedom , is to give it to her , and yet be able to go on looking after her . But I do n't see how that can be worked out . Father says it 's madness . He says I 'm a morbid coward and talk like the people in the Russian novels . He wants to speak to her himself-- "
59590	59605	59606	59606	Jim	232	" Oh , no ! He and she do n't talk the same language ... "
59623	59654	59606	59606	Jim	232	" That 's what I feel . But there 's _ your _ father ; he 's been so awfully good to us ; and his ideas are less archaic ... "
59673	59676	59668	59668	She	102	" No ! "
59681	59690	59677	59677	He	232	" You think he would n't understand either ? "
59691	59715	59757	59757	Nona	102	" I do n't mean that ... But , after all , it 's not his job ... Have you spoken to mother ? "
59716	59756	59757	59757	Nona	102	" Mother ? Oh , she always thinks everything 's all right . She 'd give me a cheque , and tell me to buy Lita a new motor or to let her do over the drawing - room . "
59774	59832	59833	59833	He	1661	" All the same , Jim : mother 's mother . She 's always been awfully good to both of us , and you ca n't let this go on without her knowing , without consulting her . She has a right to your confidence -- she has a right to hear what Lita has to say . "
59859	59865	59866	59866	he	1661	" What 's the use ? "
59869	59887	59866	59866	he	1661	" Let me consult her , then : at least let me see how she takes it . "
59899	59911	59912	59912	He	1661	" I 've got to run ; it 's nearly nine . "
59922	59942	59912	59912	He	1661	" Whatever you like , old girl . But do n't imagine it 's going to be any use . "
59957	59962	59963	59963	she	342	" Give me time , "
60172	60183	60184	60185	Mrs. Manford	103	" LITA ? But of course I 'll talk to Lita-- "
60288	60291	60260	60260	Nona	102	" double treatment "
60428	60456	60457	60457	Nona	102	" But of course I 'll talk to Lita , dear ; I always meant to . The silly goose ! I 've waited only because your father-- "
60467	60470	60457	60457	Nona	102	" Father ? "
60471	60497	60498	60498	Nona	102	" Oh , he 's helping us so splendidly about it . And he asked me to wait ; to do nothing in a hurry ... "
60505	60549	60498	60498	Nona	102	" All the same -- I think you ought to hear what Lita has to say . She 's trying to persuade Jim to let her divorce him ; and he thinks he ought to , if he ca n't make her happy . "
60550	60567	60569	60569	Pauline	108	" But he _ must _ make her happy ! I 'll talk to Jim too , "
60575	60606	60569	60569	Pauline	108	" I 'd try Lita first , mother . Ask her to postpone her decision . If we can get her to come to Cedarledge for a few weeks ' rest-- "
60607	60617	60498	60498	Nona	102	" Yes ; that 's what your father says . "
60618	60668	60669	60669	Pauline	108	" But I do n't think father ought to give up his fishing to join us . Have n't you noticed how tired he looks ? He ought to get away from all of us for a few weeks . Why should n't you and I look after Lita ? "
60713	60759	60699	60699	Nona	102	" Your father loves Cedarledge . It 's quite his own idea to go there . He thinks Easter in the country with us all will be more restful than California . I have n't influenced him in the least to give up his fishing . "
60760	60770	60771	60771	Nona	102	" Oh , I did n't suppose you had . "
60801	60829	60798	60798	her	276	" Is there anything else , dear ? Because I 've got to go over my Birth Control speech , and at eleven there 's a delegation from-- "
60845	60860	60830	60830	Nona	102	" Are you really going to preside at that Birth Control dinner , mother ? "
60861	60873	60874	60874	Pauline	108	" Preside ? Why not ? I happen to be chairman , "
60883	60925	60874	60874	Pauline	108	" I know . Only -- the other day you were preaching unlimited families . Do n't the two speeches come rather close together ? You might expose yourself to some newspaper chaff if any one put you in parallel columns . "
61013	61025	61290	61290	Maisie	104	" I do n't think you always grasp things , Nona . "
61039	61049	61290	61290	Maisie	104	" I 'm afraid I do n't , mother . "
61050	61091	61235	61235	she	1684	" Then , perhaps -- I just suggest it -- you ought n't to be quite so ready to criticize . You seem to imagine there is a contradiction in my belonging to these two groups of ... of thought ... "
61092	61101	61235	61235	she	1684	" They do seem to contradict each other . "
61102	61160	61290	61290	Maisie	104	" Not in reality . The principles are different , of course ; but , you see , they are meant to apply to -- to different categories of people . It 's all a little difficult to explain to any one as young as you are ... a girl naturally ca n't be expected to know ... "
61161	61173	61290	61290	Maisie	104	" Oh , what we girls do n't know , mother ! "
61174	61226	61235	61235	she	1684	" Well , dear , I 've always approved of outspokenness on such matters . The real nastiness is in covering things up . But all the same , age and experience _ do _ teach one ... You children must n't hope to get at all your elders ' reasons ... "
61244	61289	61290	61290	Maisie	104	" I wish there were time to go into it all with you now ; but if I 'm to keep up with today 's engagements , and crowd in a talk with Lita besides -- Maisie ! Will you call up Mrs. Jim ? "
61297	61312	61290	61290	Maisie	104	" The delegation of the League For Discovering Genius is waiting downstairs , Mrs. Manford-- "
61313	61529	61290	61290	Maisie	104	" Oh , to be sure ! This is rather an important movement , Nona ; a new thing . I do believe there 's something helpful to be done for genius . They 're just organizing their first drive : I heard of it through that wonderful Mrs. Swoffer . You would n't care to come down and see the delegation with me ? No ... I sometimes think you 'd be happier if you interested yourself a little more in other people ... in all the big humanitarian movements that make one so proud to be an American . Do n't you think it 's glorious to belong to the only country where everybody is absolutely free , and yet we 're all made to do exactly what is best for us ? I say that somewhere in my speech ... Well , I promise to have my talk with Lita before dinner ; whatever happens , I 'll squeeze her in . And you and Jim need n't be afraid of my saying anything to set her against us . Your father has impressed that on me already . After all , I 've always preached the respect of every one 's personality ; only Lita must begin by respecting Jim 's . "
61648	61662	61664	61665	Mrs. Swoffer	198	" The great thing is to believe that they _ will _ be , "
61733	61758	61759	61759	Pauline	108	" It seems simpler just to ask her for a cup of tea -- as if I were dropping in to see the baby , "
61985	61997	61998	61998	she	108	" I 'll give her a cheque for it at once , "
62002	62014	61998	61998	she	108	" All young people begin by making mistakes of this kind . "
62121	62124	62125	62125	she	108	" Hullo , "
62128	62144	62125	62125	she	108	" I did n't know you were here . Am I late , I wonder ? "
62153	62175	62145	62145	Pauline	108	" How can you ever tell if you are ? I do n't believe there 's a clock in the house . "
62176	62186	62188	62188	Lita	105	" Yes , there is ; in the nursery , "
62190	62201	62203	62208	her mother - in - law	904	" Well , my dear , that one 's stopped , "
62212	62229	62203	62208	her mother - in - law	904	" You 've been seeing the boy ? Oh , then you have n't missed me , "
62265	62293	62294	62294	she	105	" Tea 's coming sooner or later , I suppose . Unless -- a cocktail ? No ? Would n't you be more comfortable on the floor ? "
62316	62326	62327	62327	She	105	" Thank you ; I 'm very well here . "
62342	62407	62327	62327	She	105	" I 'm so glad to have the chance of a little talk . In this rushing life we all tend to lose sight of each other , do n't we ? But I hear about you so constantly from Nona that I feel we 're very close even when we do n't meet . Nona 's devoted to you -- we all are . "
62408	62416	62418	62418	Lita	105	" That 's awfully sweet of you , "
62426	62437	62420	62420	her	105	" Well , my dear , we hope you reciprocate , "
62504	62517	62518	62518	Lita	105	" Am I expected to be devoted to you _ all _ ? "
62521	62530	62518	62518	Lita	105	" No , dear ; only to Jim . "
62531	62533	62535	62535	Jim	110	" Oh-- "
62552	62601	62547	62547	Pauline	108	" I wo n't pretend not to know something of what 's been happening . I came here today to talk things over with you , quietly and affectionately -- like an older sister . Try not to think of me as a mother - in - law ! "
62610	62635	62602	62602	Lita	105	" Oh , I 'm not afraid of mothers - in - law ; they 're not as permanent as they used to be . "
62660	62692	62651	62651	she	108	" I 'm glad you 're not afraid of me , because I want you to tell me perfectly frankly what it is that 's bothering you ... you and Jim ... "
62693	62708	62710	62710	Lita	105	" Nothing is bothering me particularly ; but I suppose I 'm bothering Jim , "
62713	62736	62710	62710	Lita	105	" You 're doing more than that , dear ; you 're making him desperately unhappy . This talk of wanting to separate-- "
62766	62794	62748	62748	her	105	" Separations are idiotic . What I want is a hundred per cent New York divorce . And he could let me have it just as easily ... "
62795	62814	62748	62748	her	105	" Lita ! You do n't know how wretched it makes me to hear you say such things . "
62815	62881	62748	62748	her	105	" Does it ? Sorry ! But it 's Jim 's own fault . Heaps of other girls would jump at him if he was free . And if I 'm bored , what 's the use of trying to keep me ? What on earth can we do about it , either of us ? You ca n't take out an insurance against boredom . "
62882	62895	62896	62896	Pauline	108	" But why should you be bored ? With everything on earth ... "
62905	62921	62896	62896	Pauline	108	" Well ; that 's it , I suppose . Always the same old everything ! "
62935	62975	62929	62929	her	1712	" Of course , if it 's this house you 're tired of ... Nona told me something about your wanting to redecorate some of the rooms ; and I can understand , for instance , that this one ... "
62976	63002	63003	63003	Lita	105	" Oh , this is the only one I do n't utterly loathe . But I 'm not divorcing Jim on account of the house , "
63016	63028	63003	63003	Lita	105	" Then what is the reason ? I do n't understand . "
63029	63048	63049	63049	Pauline	108	" I 'm not much good at reasons . I want a new deal , that 's all . "
63101	63116	63117	63117	she	108	" If you had only yourself to think of , what should you do ? "
63120	63147	63117	63117	she	108	" Do ? Be myself , I suppose ! I ca n't be , here . I 'm a sort of all - round fake . I-- "
63148	63176	63220	63220	she	108	" We none of us want you to be that -- Jim least of all . He wants you to feel perfectly free to express your personality . "
63177	63184	63185	63185	Her	108	" Here -- in this house ? "
63199	63215	63216	63216	Pauline	108	" And looking at him across the dinner - table every night of my life ? "
63224	63234	63220	63220	she	108	" And can you face giving up your baby ? "
63235	63254	63220	63220	she	108	" Baby ? Why should I ? You do n't suppose I 'd ever give up my baby ? "
63255	63279	63220	63220	she	108	" Then you mean to ask Jim to give up his wife and child , and to assume all the blame as well ? "
63280	63306	63308	63308	Lita	105	" Oh , dear , no . Where 's the blame ? I do n't see any ! All I want is a new deal , "
63311	63375	63220	63220	she	108	" My dear , I 'm sure you do n't know what you 're saying . Your husband has the misfortune to be passionately in love with you . The divorce you talk of so lightly would nearly kill him . Even if he does n't interest you any longer , he did once . Ought n't you to take that into account ? "
63385	63403	63382	63382	she	105	" But ought n't he to take into account that he does n't interest me any longer ? "
63414	63556	63404	63404	Pauline	108	" Yes , dear ; if it 's really so . But if he goes away for a time ... You know he 's to have a long holiday soon , and my husband has arranged to have him go down with Mr. Wyant to the island . All I ask is that you should n't decide anything till he comes back . See how you feel about him when he 's been away for two or three weeks . Perhaps you 've been too much together -- perhaps New York has got too much on both your nerves . At any rate , do let him go off on his holiday without the heartbreak of feeling it 's good - bye ... My husband begs you to do this . You know he loves Jim as if he were his son-- "
63565	63571	63572	63572	she	105	" Well -- isn't he ? "
63655	63658	63659	63659	she	105	" Lita ... "
63662	63666	63659	63659	she	105	" this insult ... "
63680	63724	63671	63671	her	105	" Oh , no ! An insult ! Why ? I 've always thought it would be so wonderful to have a love - child . I supposed that was why you both worshipped Jim . And now he is n't even that ! "
63738	63801	63725	63725	She	105	" I _ am _ sorry to have said the wrong thing -- honestly I am ! But it just shows we can never understand each other . For me the real wickedness is to go on living with a man you do n't love . And now I 've offended you by supposing you once felt in the same way yourself ... "
63815	63929	63930	63930	Lita	105	" You have n't offended me -- I'm not going to allow myself to be offended . I 'd rather think we do n't understand each other , as you say . But surely it 's not too late to try . I do n't want to discuss things with you ; I do n't want to nag or argue ; I only want you to wait , to come with the baby to Cedarledge , and spend a few quiet weeks with us . Nona will be there , and my husband ... there 'll be no reproaches , no questions ... but we 'll do our best to make you happy ... "
63947	63967	63968	63968	She	105	" Why , you 're actually crying ! I do n't believe you do that often , do you ? "
63982	64019	63968	63968	She	105	" All right -- I'll come to Cedarledge . I am dead - beat and fed - up , and I daresay it 'll do me a lot of good to lie up for a while ... "
64058	64066	64067	64067	she	108	" We shall all be very glad , "
64090	64096	64078	64078	she	108	" _ Well_--_isn't he _ ? "
64520	64528	64529	64529	she	108	" It 's all right , darling , "
64532	64550	64529	64529	she	108	" just a little summer shower ; I always told you there was nothing to worry about . "

78218	78460	78118	78118	she	108	" My boy 's to do Cæsar Borgia in the new film . Klawhammer cabled a definite offer the day you left for the country . And of course I insisted on Michelangelo 's sailing instantly , though he 'd planned to spend the spring in Paris and was rather cross at having to give it up . But as I told him , now is the moment to secure a lovely American bride . We all know what your rich papas - in - law over here always ask : ' What debts ? What prospects ? What other women ? ' The woman matter can generally be arranged . The debts _ are _ , in this case -- thanks to your generosity . But the prospects -- what were _ they _ , I ask you ? Months of green mould at San Fedele for a fortnight 's splash in Rome ... oh , I do n't disguise it ! And what American bride would accept _ that _ ? The San Fedele pearls , yes -- but where is the San Fedele plumbing ? But now , my dear , Michelangelo presents himself as an equal ... superior , I might say , if I were n't afraid of being partial . Cæsar Borgia in a Klawhammer film -- no one knows how many millions it may mean ! And of course Michelangelo is the very type ... "
78461	78485	78486	78487	Inwardly Pauline	108	" _ To do me the favour to transmit to his Eminence _ ... Yes ; this really is a surprise , Amalasuntha . "
78491	78532	78533	78533	She	2065	" After all , why not ? If his own mother does n't mind seeing him all over the place on film posters . And perhaps now he may pay us back -- in common decency he 'll have to ! "

78665	78782	78783	78784	The Marchesa	114	" No , dear . I ran across him yesterday in town . You did n't know Arthur'd come back ? I thought he said he 'd telephoned to Nona , or somebody . A touch of gout -- got fidgety because he could n't see his doctor . But he looked remarkably well , I thought -- so handsome still , in his _ élancé _ Wyant way ; only a little too flushed , perhaps . Yes ... poor Eleanor ... Oh , no ; he said Jim was still on the island . Perfectly contented fishing . Jim 's the only person I know who 's always perfectly contented ... such a lesson ... "
78791	78807	78783	78784	The Marchesa	114	" Very restful -- but how I should despise him if he were my Michelangelo ! "
78885	78920	78882	78882	Pauline	108	" I 'll write to Jim again , and tell him how perfect Dexter has been about Lita and the baby , and that will convince him there 's no need to hurry back . "
79243	79266	79267	79267	She	105	" Besides , what 's the use of knowing what time it is in the country ? Time for _ what _ ? "

79977	80058	79974	79974	Amalasuntha	117	" Then I must produce mine . But I daresay Pauline 's told you . About Michelangelo and Klawhammer ... Cæsar Borgia ... such a sum that I do n't dare to mention it -- you'd think I was mixing up the figures . But I 've got them down in black and white . Of course , as the producers say , Michelangelo 's so supremely the type -- it 's more than they ever could have hoped for . "

Perhaps you 've noticed the likeness ? You remember that wonderful profile portrait of Cæsar Borgia in black velvet ? What gallery is it in ? Oh , I know -- it came out in ' Vogue ' ! "
80265	80312	80313	80313	Manford	103	" I remember being so struck by it at the time -- I said to Venturino : ' But it 's the image of our boy ! ' Though Michelangelo will have to grow a beard , which makes him furious ... But then the millions ! "
80414	80456	80457	80457	Manford	103	" The offers those fellows make -- right and left -- nobody takes much account of them . Wait till I see your contract , as you call it ... If you really think it 's a job for a gentleman , "
80460	80624	80457	80457	Manford	103	" But , my friend , gentlemen ca n't be choosers ! Who are the real working - class today ? Our old aristocracies , alas ! And besides , is it ever degrading to create a work of art ? I thought in America you made so much of creativeness -- constructiveness -- what do you call it ? Is it less creative to turn a film than to manufacture bathtubs ? Can there be a nobler mission than to teach history to the millions by means of beautiful pictures ? ... Yes ! I see Lita listening , and I know she agrees with me ... Lita ! What a Lucrezia for his Cæsar ! But why look shocked , dear Dexter ? Of course you know that Lucrezia Borgia has been entirely rehabilitated ? I saw that also in ' Vogue . ' She was a perfectly pure woman -- and her hair was exactly the colour of Lita 's . "
80673	80701	80702	80703	The women	2100	" Oh , what is it ? Not a fire ? ... A chimney in the house ? ... But it 's actually here ... Not a ... "

80885	80936	80871	80871	She	108	" I ca n't tell you how I congratulate you -- every one of you ! Such an achievement ... you really manœuvre like professionals . No one would have believed it was the first time ! Dexter , will you tell them a hot supper has been prepared downstairs ! "
80948	81058	80940	80940	she	108	" I wanted to give them the chance to show off their new toy ... Yes , I believe it 's absolutely the most perfected thing in fire - engines . Dexter and I thought it was time the village was properly equipped . It 's really more on account of the farmers -- such a sense of safety for the neighbourhood ... Oh , Mr. Motts , I think you 're simply wonderful , all of you . Mr. Manford and my daughter are going to show you the way to supper ... Yes , yes , you _ must _ ! Just a sandwich and something hot .

But I do n't believe she has , for she and Nona and Dexter are riding or golfing or racing over the country from morning to night like a pack of children . You ca n't think how jolly and hungry and sleepy they all are when they get home for tea .

92693	92715	92716	92716	He	107	" That Raeburn , though -- yes . That used to be in the dining - room , did n't it ? "
92741	92785	92786	92786	He	107	" Wait a bit . It 's in the place where the Sargent of Jim as a youngster used to hang -- Jim on his pony . Just over my writing - table , so that I saw it whenever I looked up ... "
92791	92809	92810	92810	Pauline	108	" Jolly picture . What have you done with it ? Why did you take it away ? "
92824	92849	92850	92850	She	108	" I did n't . That is -- Dexter wanted it . It 's in his room ; it 's been there for years . "
92857	92867	92850	92850	She	108	" You know how devoted Dexter is to Jim . "
92892	92941	92882	92882	Pauline	108	" Stupid of me ... of course ... Fact is , I was rather rattled when I came in , seeing everything so much the same ... You must excuse my turning up in this way ; I had to see you about something important ... Hullo , Nona-- "
92942	92986	92987	92987	Pauline	108	" Of course I excuse you , Arthur . Do sit down -- here by the fire . You must be cold after your wet journey ... so unseasonable , after the weather we 've been having . Nona will ring for tea , "
93017	93026	92998	92998	NONA	102	" Well , then -- goodnight , mother . "

93183	93190	93191	93191	she	108	" Well , it 's over , "
93271	93285	93258	93258	she	108	" I 'm so thankful you 've never bobbed your hair , mother . "
93322	93332	93333	93333	Nona	102	" You 're so handsome just as you are , "
93336	93381	93333	93333	Nona	102	" I can understand dear old Exhibit 's being upset when he saw you here , in the same surroundings , and looking , after all , so much as you must have in his day ... And when he himself is so changed ... "
93390	93396	93384	93384	her	108	" Yes . Poor Arthur ! "
93444	93489	93434	93434	She	108	" It was certainly unfortunate , his taking it into his head to come out here . I did n't suppose he would have remembered so clearly how everything looked ... The Sargent of Jim on the pony ... Do you think he minded ? "
93490	93507	93434	93434	She	108	" Its having been moved to father 's room ? Yes ; I think he did . "
93508	93548	93434	93434	She	108	" But , Nona , he 's always been so grateful to your father for what he 's done for Jim -- and for Lita . He _ admires _ your father . He 's often told me so . "
93549	93552	93434	93434	She	108	" Yes . "
93553	93576	93434	93434	She	108	" At any rate , once he was here , I could n't do less than ask him to stay to dine . "
93577	93595	93434	93434	She	108	" No ; you could n't . Especially as there was no train back till after dinner . "
93596	93616	93617	93617	Nona	102	" And , after all , I do n't , to this minute , know what he came for ! "
93629	93634	93619	93619	her	102	" You do n't ? "
93635	93768	93434	93434	She	108	" Oh , of course , in a vague way , to talk about Jim and Lita . The same old things we 've heard so many times . But I quieted him very soon about that . I told him Lita had been perfectly happy here -- that the experiment had been a complete success . He seemed surprised that she had given up all her notions about Hollywood and Klawhammer ... apparently Amalasuntha has been talking a lot of nonsense to him ... but when I said that Lita had never once spoken of Hollywood , and that she was going home the day after tomorrow to join her husband , it seemed to tranquillize him completely . Did n't he seem to you much quieter when he drove off ? "
93769	93787	93788	93788	Pauline	108	" Yes ; he was certainly quieter . But he seemed to want particularly to see Lita . "
93794	93886	93887	93887	She	108	" Yes . On the whole I was glad she was n't here . Lita has never known how to manage Arthur , and her manner is sometimes so irritating . She might have said something that would have upset him again . It was really a relief when your father telephoned that they had decided to dine at Greystock -- though I could see that Arthur thought that funny too . His ideas have never progressed an inch ; he 's always remained as old - fashioned as his mother . "
93897	93928	93887	93887	She	108	" I saw you were a little startled when I asked him if he would n't like to spend the night . But I did n't want to appear inhospitable . "
93929	93937	93941	93941	her	102	" No ; not in this house , "
93945	93953	93954	93954	Pauline	108	" And of course one knew he wouldn't-- "
93957	93967	93954	93954	Pauline	108	" Poor Arthur ! He 's always so punctilious . "
93968	93980	93887	93887	She	108	" It was n't only that . He was suffering horribly . "
93981	93997	93941	93941	her	102	" About Lita ? So foolish ! As if he could n't trust her to us-- "
93998	94071	93954	93954	Pauline	108	" Not only about Lita . But just from the fact of being here -- of having all his old life thrust back on him . He seemed utterly unprepared for it -- as if he 'd really succeeded in not thinking about it at all for years . And suddenly there it was : like the drowning man 's vision . A drowning man -- that 's what he was like . "
94088	94117	94080	94080	her	108	" What dreadful ideas you have ! I thought I 'd never seen him looking better ; and certainly he did n't take too much wine at dinner . "
94118	94127	93954	93954	Pauline	108	" No ; he was careful about that . "
94128	94144	94145	94145	Her	108	" And I was careful too . I managed to give a hint to Powder . "
94232	94247	94222	94222	She	108	" I have n't told you yet . On the way down to dinner ... "
94248	94253	94222	94222	She	108	" What , dear ? "
94254	94274	94275	94275	Pauline	108	" I met him on the upper landing . He asked to see the baby ... that was natural ... "
94305	94309	94299	94299	She	108	" Perfectly natural . "
94310	94338	94299	94299	She	108	" The baby was asleep , looking red and jolly . He stood over the crib a long time . Luckily it was n't the old nursery . "
94339	94348	94299	94299	She	108	" Really , Nona ! He could hardly expect-- "
94349	94401	94299	94299	She	108	" No ; of course not . Then , just as we were going downstairs , he said : ' Funny , how like Jim the child is growing . Reminds me of that old portrait . ' And he jerked out at me : ' Could I see it ? ' "
94402	94408	94299	94299	She	108	" What -- the Sargent ? "
94412	94418	94409	94409	Nona	102	" Could I refuse him ? "
94419	94427	94299	94299	She	108	" I suppose that was natural too . "
94428	94481	94299	94299	She	108	" So I took him into father 's study . He seemed to remember every step of the way . He stood and looked and looked at the picture . He did n't say anything ... did n't answer when I spoke ... I saw that it went through and through him . "
94482	94500	94299	94299	She	108	" Well , Nona , byegones are byegones . But people do bring things upon themselves , sometimes-- "
94501	94509	94299	94299	She	108	" Oh , I know , mother . "
94510	94553	94554	94554	Pauline	108	" Some people might think it peculiar , his rambling about the house like that -- his coming here at all , with his ideas of delicacy ! But I do n't blame him ; and I do n't want you to , "
94558	94617	94618	94618	She	108	" After all , it 's just as well he came . He may have been a little upset at the moment ; but I managed to calm him down ; and I certainly proved to him that everything 's all right , and that Dexter and I can be trusted to know what 's best for Lita . "
94625	94658	94618	94618	She	108	" Do you know , I 'm rather inclined not to mention his visit to your father -- or to Lita . Now it 's over , why should they be bothered ? "
94659	94665	94666	94666	Nona	102	" No reason at all . "
94684	94743	94678	94678	her	102	" I 'll see that Powder does n't say anything . And besides , he would n't . He always seems to know what needs explaining and what does n't . He ought to be kept to avert cataclysms , like those fire - extinguishers in the passages ... Goodnight , mother -- I'm beginning to be sleepy . "

94968	94986	94989	94989	she	2403	" My dear -- you must excuse me . I 'm only an intruder here , I know-- "
