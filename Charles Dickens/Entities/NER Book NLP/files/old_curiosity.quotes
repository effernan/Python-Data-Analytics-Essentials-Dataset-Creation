2724	2783	2711	2711	I	0	‘ it always grieves me to contemplate the initiation of children into the ways of life , when they are scarcely more than infants . It checks their confidence and simplicity -- two of the best qualities that Heaven gives them -- and demands that they share our sorrows before they are capable of entering into our enjoyments . ’
2784	2791	2793	2795	the old man	384	‘ It will never check hers , ’
2801	2833	2793	2795	the old man	384	‘ the springs are too deep . Besides , the children of the poor know but few pleasures . Even the cheap delights of childhood must be bought and paid for . ’

3762	3800	3749	3750	the grandfather	436	‘ Is it because thou know’st I love thee , and dost not like that I should seem to doubt it by my question ? Well , well -- then let us say I love thee dearly . ’
3801	3808	3810	3811	the child	324	‘ Indeed , indeed you do , ’

3896	3911	3913	3913	I	0	‘ She is poor now’--said the old man , patting the child ’s cheek , ‘
3974	3975	3976	3976	I	0	’ ‘
3986	3991	3976	3976	I	0	’ said the child . ‘

4012	4021	4010	4010	thou	441	’ then he muttered again between his teeth , ‘
4043	4097	4101	4101	sir	5863	’ ; and then he sighed and fell into his former musing state , and still holding the child between his knees appeared to be insensible to everything around him . By this time it wanted but a few minutes of midnight and I rose to go , which recalled him to himself . ‘
4103	4107	4101	4101	sir	5863	’ he said , ‘
4163	4164	4168	4168	Kit	75	’ ‘
4170	4184	4168	4168	Kit	75	’ said the child , her eyes lighting up with merriment and kindness . ‘
4191	4196	4188	4189	Miss Nell	72	’ returned the boy . ‘
4202	4208	4199	4200	this gentleman	447	’ interposed the old man , ‘
4224	4225	4230	4230	master	5881	’ ‘
4232	4236	4230	4230	master	5881	’ said Kit , ‘
4246	4247	4250	4250	you	75	’ ‘
4253	4259	4250	4250	you	75	’ cried the old man . ‘
4268	4272	4266	4266	master	5881	’ said Kit , ‘
4309	4373	4374	4374	I	0	’ Once more opening his mouth and shutting his eyes , and laughing like a stentor , Kit gradually backed to the door , and roared himself out . Free of the room , the boy was not slow in taking his departure ; when he had gone , and the child was occupied in clearing the table , the old man said : ‘
4444	4460	4439	4439	I	0	’ I was sure of that , I said , from what I had seen . ‘
4463	4467	4439	4439	I	0	’ I added , ‘
4475	4476	4469	4469	I	0	’ ‘
4481	4487	4479	4479	sir	5863	’ replied the old man , ‘
4492	4493	4494	4496	This delicate child	456	’ ‘
4498	4502	4494	4496	This delicate child	456	’ said I , ‘
4528	4529	4521	4521	she	456	’ ‘
4532	4542	4521	4521	she	456	’ he returned , looking anxiously in my face , ‘
4551	4552	4546	4546	she	456	’ ‘
4559	4563	4555	4555	you	0	’ said I , ‘
4652	4653	4625	4625	you	0	’ ‘
4656	4667	4654	4654	Sir	5863	’ rejoined the old man after a moment ’s silence . ‘
4783	4847	4778	4778	I	0	’ Seeing that he was in a state of excitement and impatience , I turned to put on an outer coat which I had thrown off on entering the room , purposing to say no more . I was surprised to see the child standing patiently by with a cloak upon her arm , and in her hand a hat , and stick . ‘
4856	4859	4851	4851	mine	0	’ said I. ‘
4862	4867	4851	4851	mine	0	’ returned the child , ‘
4873	4874	4870	4870	grandfather	382	’ ‘
4885	4886	4891	4891	he	382	’ ‘
4894	4903	4891	4891	he	382	’ said the child , with a smile . ‘
4914	4915	4916	4916	Me	0	’ ‘
4928	5130	4924	4924	I	0	’ I looked in astonishment towards the old man , but he was , or feigned to be , busied in the arrangement of his dress . From him I looked back to the slight gentle figure of the child . Alone ! In that gloomy place all the long , dreary night . She evinced no consciousness of my surprise , but cheerfully helped the old man with his cloak , and when he was ready took a candle to light us out . Finding that we did not follow as she expected , she looked back with a smile and waited for us . The old man showed by his face that he plainly understood the cause of my hesitation , but he merely signed to me with an inclination of the head to pass out of the room before him , and remained silent . I had no resource but to comply . When we reached the door , the child setting down the candle , turned to say good night and raised her face to kiss me . Then she ran to the old man , who folded her in his arms and bade God bless her . ‘
5136	5144	5134	5134	Nell	72	’ he said in a low voice , ‘
5160	5161	5157	5158	my sweet	470	’ ‘
5166	5172	5157	5158	my sweet	470	’ answered the child fervently , ‘
5180	5181	5173	5173	they	471	’ ‘
5194	5200	5157	5158	my sweet	470	’ said the old man . ‘
5216	5217	5218	5218	You	0	’ ‘
5224	5229	5218	5218	You	0	’ returned the child . ‘
5243	5909	5218	5218	You	0	’ With this , they separated . The child opened the door ( now guarded by a shutter which I had heard the boy put up before he left the house ) and with another farewell whose clear and tender note I have recalled a thousand times , held it until we had passed out . The old man paused a moment while it was gently closed and fastened on the inside , and satisfied that this was done , walked on at a slow pace . At the street - corner he stopped , and regarding me with a troubled countenance said that our ways were widely different and that he must take his leave . I would have spoken , but summoning up more alacrity than might have been expected in one of his appearance , he hurried away . I could see that twice or thrice he looked back as if to ascertain if I were still watching him , or perhaps to assure himself that I was not following at a distance . The obscurity of the night favoured his disappearance , and his figure was soon beyond my sight . I remained standing on the spot where he had left me , unwilling to depart , and yet unknowing why I should loiter there . I looked wistfully into the street we had lately quitted , and after a time directed my steps that way . I passed and repassed the house , and stopped and listened at the door ; all was dark , and silent as the grave . Yet I lingered about , and could not tear myself away , thinking of all possible harm that might happen to the child -- of fires and robberies and even murder -- and feeling as if some evil must ensue if I turned my back upon the place . The closing of a door or window in the street brought me before the curiosity - dealer ’s once more ; I crossed the road and looked up at the house to assure myself that the noise had not come from there . No , it was black , cold , and lifeless as before . There were few passengers astir ; the street was sad and dismal , and pretty well my own . A few stragglers from the theatres hurried by , and now and then I turned aside to avoid some noisy drunkard as he reeled homewards , but these interruptions were not frequent and soon ceased . The clocks struck one . Still I paced up and down , promising myself that every time should be the last , and breaking faith with myself on some new plea as often as I did so . The more I thought of what the old man had said , and of his looks and bearing , the less I could account for what I had seen and heard . I had a strong misgiving that his nightly absence was for no good purpose . I had only come to know the fact through the innocence of the child , and though the old man was by at the time , and saw my undisguised surprise , he had preserved a strange mystery upon the subject and offered no word of explanation . These reflections naturally recalled again more strongly than before his haggard face , his wandering manner , his restless anxious looks . His affection for the child might not be inconsistent with villany of the worst kind ; even that very affection was in itself an extraordinary contradiction , or how could he leave her thus ? Disposed as I was to think badly of him , I never doubted that his love for her was real . I could not admit the thought , remembering what had passed between us , and the tone of voice in which he had called her by her name . ‘
5915	5926	5927	5927	I	0	’ the child had said in answer to my question , ‘
5931	6444	6445	6445	You	474	’ What could take him from home by night , and every night ! I called up all the strange tales I had ever heard of dark and secret deeds committed in great towns and escaping detection for a long series of years ; wild as many of these stories were , I could not find one adapted to this mystery , which only became the more impenetrable , in proportion as I sought to solve it . Occupied with such thoughts as these , and a crowd of others all tending to the same point , I continued to pace the street for two long hours ; at length the rain began to descend heavily , and then over - powered by fatigue though no less interested than I had been at first , I engaged the nearest coach and so got home . A cheerful fire was blazing on the hearth , the lamp burnt brightly , my clock received me with its old familiar welcome ; everything was quiet , warm and cheering , and in happy contrast to the gloom and darkness I had quitted . But all that night , waking or in my sleep , the same thoughts recurred and the same images retained possession of my brain . I had ever before me the old dark murky rooms -- the gaunt suits of mail with their ghostly silent air -- the faces all awry , grinning from wood and stone -- the dust and rust and worm that lives in wood -- and alone in the midst of all this lumber and decay and ugly age , the beautiful child in her gentle slumber , smiling through her light and sunny dreams . CHAPTER 2 After combating , for nearly a week , the feeling which impelled me to revisit the place I had quitted under the circumstances already detailed , I yielded to it at length ; and determining that this time I would present myself by the light of day , bent my steps thither early in the morning . I walked past the house , and took several turns in the street , with that kind of hesitation which is natural to a man who is conscious that the visit he is about to pay is unexpected , and may not be very acceptable . However , as the door of the shop was shut , and it did not appear likely that I should be recognized by those within , if I continued merely to pass up and down before it , I soon conquered this irresolution , and found myself in the Curiosity Dealer ’s warehouse . The old man and another person were together in the back part , and there seemed to have been high words between them , for their voices which were raised to a very high pitch suddenly stopped on my entering , and the old man advancing hastily towards me , said in a tremulous tone that he was very glad I had come . ‘
6453	6470	6445	6445	You	474	’ said he , pointing to the man whom I had found in company with him ; ‘
6495	6496	6491	6491	he	476	’ ‘
6509	6524	6499	6499	You	474	’ returned the other , after bestowing a stare and a frown on me ; ‘
6530	6531	6532	6532	I	0	’ ‘
6538	6549	6532	6532	I	0	’ cried the old man , turning feebly upon him . ‘
6584	6585	6586	6586	I	0	’ ‘
6590	6595	6586	6586	I	0	’ returned the other . ‘
6628	6629	6620	6620	I	0	’ ‘
6635	6649	6620	6620	I	0	’ cried the old man , passionately clasping his hands and looking upward ; ‘
6657	6729	6620	6620	I	0	’ The other stood lounging with his foot upon a chair , and regarded him with a contemptuous sneer . He was a young man of one - and - twenty or thereabouts ; well made , and certainly handsome , though the expression of his face was far from prepossessing , having in common with his manner and even his dress , a dissipated , insolent air which repelled one . ‘
6735	6741	6620	6620	I	0	’ said the young fellow , ‘
6791	6792	6784	6784	I	0	’ ‘
6796	6803	6784	6784	I	0	’ said the old man bitterly . ‘
6813	6818	6806	6806	You	480	’ returned the other . ‘
6892	6893	6889	6889	I	0	’ ‘
6916	6928	6929	6930	A profligate	486	’ cried the old man , turning from him to me . ‘
6969	6984	6965	6966	A liar	489	’ he added , in a lower voice as he drew closer to me , ‘
7009	7010	7005	7007	a stranger nearby	490	’ ‘
7019	7029	7011	7011	Strangers	491	’ said the young fellow catching at the word , ‘
7090	7201	7083	7083	him	493	’ Saying this , he stepped to the door , and looking down the street beckoned several times to some unseen person , who , to judge from the air of impatience with which these signals were accompanied , required a great quantity of persuasion to induce him to advance . At length there sauntered up , on the opposite side of the way -- with a bad pretense of passing by accident -- a figure conspicuous for its dirty smartness , which after a great many frowns and jerks of the head , in resistance of the invitation , ultimately crossed the road and was brought into the shop . ‘
7209	7219	7206	7207	Dick Swiveller	77	’ said the young fellow , pushing him in . ‘
7225	7226	7223	7223	Swiveller	77	’ ‘
7234	7360	7366	7366	his	77	’ said Mr Swiveller in an undertone . Mr Swiveller complied , and looking about him with a propitiatory smile , observed that last week was a fine week for the ducks , and this week was a fine week for the dust ; he also observed that whilst standing by the post at the street - corner , he had observed a pig with a straw in his mouth issuing out of the tobacco - shop , from which appearance he augured that another fine week for the ducks was approaching , and that rain would certainly ensue . He furthermore took occasion to apologize for any negligence that might be perceptible in his dress , on the ground that last night he had had ‘
7368	7397	7223	7223	Swiveller	77	’ ; by which expression he was understood to convey to his hearers in the most delicate manner possible , the information that he had been extremely drunk . ‘
7401	7409	7206	7207	Dick Swiveller	77	’ said Mr Swiveller with a sigh , ‘
7468	7469	7470	7470	You	77	’ ‘
7478	7486	7487	7487	Fred	79	’ said his friend , half aside . ‘
7489	7498	7474	7475	the chairman	497	’ cried Mr Swiveller , tapping his nose , ‘
7548	7549	7543	7546	the old min friendly	499	’ ‘
7554	7559	7543	7546	the old min friendly	499	’ replied his friend . ‘
7566	7571	7543	7546	the old min friendly	499	’ said Mr Swiveller , ‘
7583	8132	8133	8133	Fred	79	’ with that , he winked as if in preservation of some deep secret , and folding his arms and leaning back in his chair , looked up at the ceiling with profound gravity . It was perhaps not very unreasonable to suspect from what had already passed , that Mr Swiveller was not quite recovered from the effects of the powerful sunlight to which he had made allusion ; but if no such suspicion had been awakened by his speech , his wiry hair , dull eyes , and sallow face would still have been strong witnesses against him . His attire was not , as he had himself hinted , remarkable for the nicest arrangement , but was in a state of disorder which strongly induced the idea that he had gone to bed in it . It consisted of a brown body - coat with a great many brass buttons up the front and only one behind , a bright check neckerchief , a plaid waistcoat , soiled white trousers , and a very limp hat , worn with the wrong side foremost , to hide a hole in the brim . The breast of his coat was ornamented with an outside pocket from which there peeped forth the cleanest end of a very large and very ill - favoured handkerchief ; his dirty wristbands were pulled on as far as possible and ostentatiously folded back over his cuffs ; he displayed no gloves , and carried a yellow cane having at the top a bone hand with the semblance of a ring on its little finger and a black ball in its grasp . With all these personal advantages ( to which may be added a strong savour of tobacco - smoke , and a prevailing greasiness of appearance ) Mr Swiveller leant back in his chair with his eyes fixed on the ceiling , and occasionally pitching his voice to the needful key , obliged the company with a few bars of an intensely dismal air , and then , in the middle of a note , relapsed into his former silence . The old man sat himself down in a chair , and with folded hands , looked sometimes at his grandson and sometimes at his strange companion , as if he were utterly powerless and had no resource but to leave them to do as they pleased . The young man reclined against a table at no great distance from his friend , in apparent indifference to everything that had passed ; and I -- who felt the difficulty of any interference , notwithstanding that the old man had appealed to me , both by words and looks -- made the best feint I could of being occupied in examining some of the goods that were disposed for sale , and paying very little attention to a person before me . The silence was not of long duration , for Mr Swiveller , after favouring us with several melodious assurances that his heart was in the Highlands , and that he wanted but his Arab steed as a preliminary to the achievement of great feats of valour and loyalty , removed his eyes from the ceiling and subsided into prose again . ‘
8135	8162	8164	8167	the old min friendly	499	’ said Mr Swiveller stopping short , as if the idea had suddenly occurred to him , and speaking in the same audible whisper as before , ‘
8169	8170	8164	8167	the old min friendly	499	’ ‘
8176	8182	8187	8187	he	499	’ returned his friend peevishly . ‘
8189	8193	8187	8187	he	499	’ said Dick . ‘
8209	8470	8201	8201	I	0	’ Emboldened as it seemed by this reply to enter into a more general conversation , Mr Swiveller plainly laid himself out to captivate our attention . He began by remarking that soda - water , though a good thing in the abstract , was apt to lie cold upon the stomach unless qualified with ginger , or a small infusion of brandy , which latter article he held to be preferable in all cases , saving for the one consideration of expense . Nobody venturing to dispute these positions , he proceeded to observe that the human hair was a great retainer of tobacco - smoke , and that the young gentlemen of Westminster and Eton , after eating vast quantities of apples to conceal any scent of cigars from their anxious friends , were usually detected in consequence of their heads possessing this remarkable property ; when he concluded that if the Royal Society would turn their attention to the circumstance , and endeavour to find in the resources of science a means of preventing such untoward revelations , they might indeed be looked upon as benefactors to mankind . These opinions being equally incontrovertible with those he had already pronounced , he went on to inform us that Jamaica rum , though unquestionably an agreeable spirit of great richness and flavour , had the drawback of remaining constantly present to the taste next day ; and nobody being venturous enough to argue this point either , he increased in confidence and became yet more companionable and communicative . ‘
8481	8486	8201	8201	I	0	’ said Mr Swiveller , ‘
8551	8552	8554	8554	your	501	’ ‘
8557	8562	8554	8554	your	501	’ said his friend . ‘
8565	8570	8563	8563	Sir	5863	’ replied Mr Swiveller , ‘
8696	8716	8683	8686	The wild young grandson	510	’re as rich as rich can be ; you have been at no uncommon expense on my account , you ’re
8864	8910	8913	8913	you	510	’ Having delivered this oration with a great many waves and flourishes of the hand , Mr Swiveller abruptly thrust the head of his cane into his mouth as if to prevent himself from impairing the effect of his speech by adding one other word . ‘
8923	8933	8913	8913	you	510	’ said the old man turning to his grandson . ‘
8968	8969	8946	8946	I	0	’ ‘
8978	8988	8973	8973	I	0	’ returned the other , looking coldly at him , ‘
8994	8995	8990	8990	I	0	’ ‘
9003	9009	8990	8990	I	0	’ said the old man . ‘
9022	9023	9024	9024	Nell	72	’ ‘
9031	9036	9027	9028	a woman	520	’ returned the other , ‘
9055	9056	9044	9044	she	72	’ ‘
9060	9069	9044	9044	she	72	’ said the old man with sparkling eyes , ‘
9112	9113	9101	9101	she	72	’ ‘
9122	9127	9117	9117	she	72	’ retorted the other . ‘
9136	9137	9133	9133	he	524	’ ‘
9141	9157	9133	9133	he	524	’ said the old man dropping his voice and speaking like one who thinks aloud , ‘
9199	9254	9255	9256	a clincher	527	’ These words were uttered in too low a tone to reach the ears of the young men . Mr Swiveller appeared to think that they implied some mental struggle consequent upon the powerful effect of his address , for he poked his friend with his cane and whispered his conviction that he had administered ‘
9258	9634	9255	9256	a clincher	527	’ and that he expected a commission on the profits . Discovering his mistake after a while , he appeared to grow rather sleepy and discontented , and had more than once suggested the propriety of an immediate departure , when the door opened , and the child herself appeared . CHAPTER 3 The child was closely followed by an elderly man of remarkably hard features and forbidding aspect , and so low in stature as to be quite a dwarf , though his head and face were large enough for the body of a giant . His black eyes were restless , sly , and cunning ; his mouth and chin , bristly with the stubble of a coarse hard beard ; and his complexion was one of that kind which never looks clean or wholesome . But what added most to the grotesque expression of his face was a ghastly smile , which , appearing to be the mere result of habit and to have no connection with any mirthful or complacent feeling , constantly revealed the few discoloured fangs that were yet scattered in his mouth , and gave him the aspect of a panting dog . His dress consisted of a large high - crowned hat , a worn dark suit , a pair of capacious shoes , and a dirty white neckerchief sufficiently limp and crumpled to disclose the greater portion of his wiry throat . Such hair as he had was of a grizzled black , cut short and straight upon his temples , and hanging in a frowzy fringe about his ears . His hands , which were of a rough , coarse grain , were very dirty ; his fingernails were crooked , long , and yellow . There was ample time to note these particulars , for besides that they were sufficiently obvious without very close observation , some moments elapsed before any one broke silence . The child advanced timidly towards her brother and put her hand in his , the dwarf ( if we may call him so ) glanced keenly at all present , and the curiosity - dealer , who plainly had not expected his uncouth visitor , seemed disconcerted and embarrassed . ‘
9637	9659	9255	9256	a clincher	527	’ said the dwarf , who with his hand stretched out above his eyes had been surveying the young man attentively , ‘
9668	9669	9673	9673	he	529	’ ‘
9678	9684	9673	9673	he	529	’ replied the old man . ‘
9689	9690	9686	9686	he	529	’ ‘
9694	9704	9705	9708	Some friend of his	531	’ said the dwarf , pointing to Dick Swiveller . ‘
9716	9722	9705	9708	Some friend of his	531	’ said the old man . ‘
9726	9739	9705	9708	Some friend of his	531	’ inquired the dwarf , wheeling round and pointing straight at me . ‘
9765	9804	9757	9757	her	72	’ The little man turned to the child as if to chide her or express his wonder , but as she was talking to the young man , held his peace , and bent his head to listen . ‘
9809	9816	9807	9807	Nelly	72	’ said the young fellow aloud . ‘
9827	9828	9818	9818	they	535	’ ‘
9840	9845	9818	9818	they	535	’ cried the child . ‘
9852	9860	9818	9818	they	535	’ pursued her brother with a sneer . ‘
9865	9869	9870	9870	They	535	’ she returned . ‘
9883	9884	9879	9879	they	535	’ ‘
9892	9904	9885	9885	I	0	’ he said , darting a bitter look at the grandfather . ‘
9920	9921	9917	9917	you	0	’ ‘
9930	9935	9928	9928	Fred	79	’ said the child . ‘
9939	9940	9941	9941	I	0	’ ‘
9949	9957	9941	9941	I	0	’ the child repeated with great emotion , ‘
9980	9981	9974	9974	I	0	’ ‘
9985	10009	9982	9982	I	0	’ said the young man , as he stooped carelessly over the child , and having kissed her , pushed her from him : ‘
10039	10072	10073	10073	Harkee	81	’ He remained silent , following her with his eyes , until she had gained her little room and closed the door ; and then turning to the dwarf , said abruptly , ‘
10076	10077	10075	10075	Mr--	82	’ ‘
10081	10086	10075	10075	Mr--	82	’ returned the dwarf . ‘
10106	10107	10103	10104	Daniel Quilp	84	’ ‘
10115	10120	10108	10108	Harkee	81	’ pursued the other , ‘
10130	10131	10132	10132	Some	540	’ ‘
10134	10140	10132	10132	Some	540	’ said Mr Quilp emphatically . ‘
10152	10153	10132	10132	Some	540	’ ‘
10157	10165	10132	10132	Some	540	’ replied Quilp , with equal dryness . ‘
10370	10371	10368	10368	Dick	77	’ ‘
10374	10387	10388	10388	Sir	5863	’ cried Mr Swiveller , as his companion turned toward the door . ‘
10390	10391	10392	10392	Sir	5863	’ ‘
10400	10412	10394	10394	I	0	’ said Mr Quilp , to whom the monosyllable was addressed . ‘
10430	10435	10428	10428	sir	5863	’ said Mr Swiveller , ‘
10466	10467	10460	10462	the old min	495	’ ‘
10472	10486	10470	10470	sir	5863	’ said Daniel Quilp ; for the orator had made a sudden stop . ‘
10566	10609	10555	10555	you	5863	’ Without waiting for the permission he sought , Mr Swiveller stepped up to the dwarf , and leaning on his shoulder and stooping down to get at his ear , said in a voice which was perfectly audible to all present , ‘
10622	10623	10555	10555	you	5863	’ ‘
10627	10631	10555	10555	you	5863	’ demanded Quilp . ‘
10639	10647	10637	10637	fork	558	’ replied Mr Swiveller slapping his pocket . ‘
10654	10749	10652	10652	sir	5863	’ The dwarf nodded . Mr Swiveller drew back and nodded likewise , then drew a little further back and nodded again , and so on . By these means he in time reached the door , where he gave a great cough to attract the dwarf ’s attention and gain an opportunity of expressing in dumb show , the closest confidence and most inviolable secrecy . Having performed the serious pantomime that was necessary for the due conveyance of these idea , he cast himself upon his friend ’s track , and vanished . ‘
10752	10767	10652	10652	sir	5863	’ said the dwarf with a sour look and a shrug of his shoulders , ‘
10785	10795	10652	10652	sir	5863	’ he added , turning to the old man , ‘
10811	10812	10815	10815	you	5863	’ ‘
10820	10830	10815	10815	you	5863	’ he retorted in a kind of helpless desperation . ‘
10846	10847	10841	10841	you	5863	’ ‘
10859	10864	10850	10850	I	0	’ said the dwarf . ‘
10871	10872	10850	10850	I	0	’ ‘
10874	10878	10880	10882	the little man	6029	’re right there , ’
10910	10965	10903	10903	he	6029	‘ Ask Mrs Quilp , pretty Mrs Quilp , obedient , timid , loving Mrs Quilp . But that reminds me -- I have left her all alone , and she will be anxious and know not a moment ’s peace till I return . I know she ’s always in that condition when I ’m
11006	11081	11003	11004	Mrs Quilp	83	’ The creature appeared quite horrible with his monstrous head and little body , as he rubbed his hands slowly round , and round , and round again -- with something fantastic even in his manner of performing this slight action -- and , dropping his shaggy brows and cocking his chin in the air , glanced upward with a stealthy look of exultation that an imp might have copied and appropriated to himself . ‘
11084	11105	11106	11106	I	0	’ he said , putting his hand into his breast and sidling up to the old man as he spoke ; ‘
11157	11158	11145	11145	neighbor	563	’ ‘
11168	11179	11164	11164	I	0	’ said the old man with something like a groan . ‘
11183	11194	11195	11195	neighbour	530	’ echoed the dwarf , approaching close to his ear ; ‘
11224	11225	11212	11212	you	563	’ ‘
11229	11238	11212	11212	you	563	’ said the other with a haggard look . ‘
11242	11256	11257	11257	He	0	’re right -- I -- I -- keep it close -- very close . ’
11350	11356	11357	11357	he	0	‘ And so , neighbour , ’
11360	11397	11357	11357	he	0	‘ I ’ll turn my face homewards , leaving my love for Nelly and hoping she may never lose her way again , though her doing so HAS procured me an honour I did n’t expect . ’
11707	11717	11718	11718	he	384	‘ I ’ll be of better cheer , Nell , ’
11721	11771	11718	11718	he	384	‘ there must be good fortune in store for thee -- I do not ask it for myself , but thee . Such miseries must fall on thy innocent head without it , that I can not believe but that , being tempted , it will come at last ! ’
11784	11789	11791	11791	he	384	‘ When I think , ’
11793	11872	11791	11791	he	384	‘ of the many years -- many in thy short life -- that thou has lived with me ; of my monotonous existence , knowing no companions of thy own age nor any childish pleasures ; of the solitude in which thou has grown to be what thou art , and in which thou hast lived apart from nearly all thy kind but one old man ; I sometimes fear I have dealt hardly by thee , Nell . ’
11873	11876	11878	11879	the child	324	‘ Grandfather ! ’
11884	11892	11894	11894	he	384	‘ Not in intention -- no no , ’
11896	11998	11999	11999	She	324	‘ I have ever looked forward to the time that should enable thee to mix among the gayest and prettiest , and take thy station with the best . But I still look forward , Nell , I still look forward , and if I should be forced to leave thee , meanwhile , how have I fitted thee for struggles with the world ? The poor bird yonder is as well qualified to encounter it , and be turned adrift upon its mercies -- Hark ! I hear Kit outside . Go to him , Nell , go to him . ’
12041	12050	12052	12054	the old man	384	‘ A word in your ear , sir , ’
12060	12224	12052	12054	the old man	384	‘ I have been rendered uneasy by what you said the other night , and can only plead that I have done all for the best -- that it is too late to retract , if I could ( though I cannot)--and that I hope to triumph yet . All is for her sake . I have borne great poverty myself , and would spare her the sufferings that poverty carries with it . I would spare her the miseries that brought her mother , my own dear child , to an early grave . I would leave her -- not with resources which could be easily spent or squandered away , but with what would place her beyond the reach of want for ever . You mark me sir ? She shall have no pittance , but a fortune -- Hush ! I can say no more than that , now or at any other time , and she is here again ! ’
12923	12954	13756	13756	her	608	‘ Change with men in glazed hats and round jackets pretty well every day . On the Surrey side of the river was a small rat - infested dreary yard called ‘
12959	13694	13756	13756	her	608	’ in which were a little wooden counting - house burrowing all awry in the dust as if it had fallen from the clouds and ploughed into the ground ; a few fragments of rusty anchors ; several large iron rings ; some piles of rotten wood ; and two or three heaps of old sheet copper , crumpled , cracked , and battered . On Quilp ’s Wharf , Daniel Quilp was a ship - breaker , yet to judge from these appearances he must either have been a ship - breaker on a very small scale , or have broken his ships up very small indeed . Neither did the place present any extraordinary aspect of life or activity , as its only human occupant was an amphibious boy in a canvas suit , whose sole change of occupation was from sitting on the head of a pile and throwing stones into the mud when the tide was out , to standing with his hands in his pockets gazing listlessly on the motion and on the bustle of the river at high - water . The dwarf ’s lodging on Tower hill comprised , besides the needful accommodation for himself and Mrs Quilp , a small sleeping - closet for that lady ’s mother , who resided with the couple and waged perpetual war with Daniel ; of whom , notwithstanding , she stood in no slight dread . Indeed , the ugly creature contrived by some means or other -- whether by his ugliness or his ferocity or his natural cunning is no great matter -- to impress with a wholesome fear of his anger , most of those with whom he was brought into daily contact and communication . Over nobody had he such complete ascendance as Mrs Quilp herself -- a pretty little , mild - spoken , blue - eyed woman , who having allied herself in wedlock to the dwarf in one of those strange infatuations of which examples are by no means scarce , performed a sound practical penance for her folly , every day of her life . It has been said that Mrs Quilp was pining in her bower . In her bower she was , but not alone , for besides the old lady her mother of whom mention has recently been made , there were present some half - dozen ladies of the neighborhood who had happened by a strange accident ( and also by a little understanding among themselves ) to drop in one after another , just about tea - time . This being a season favourable to conversation , and the room being a cool , shady , lazy kind of place , with some plants at the open window shutting out the dust , and interposing pleasantly enough between the tea table within and the old Tower without , it is no wonder that the ladies felt an inclination to talk and linger , especially when there are taken into account the additional inducements of fresh butter , new bread , shrimps , and watercresses . Now , the ladies being together under these circumstances , it was extremely natural that the discourse should turn upon the propensity of mankind to tyrannize over the weaker sex , and the duty that developed upon the weaker sex to resist that tyranny and assert their rights and dignity . It was natural for four reasons : firstly , because Mrs Quilp being a young woman and notoriously under the dominion of her husband ought to be excited to rebel ; secondly , because Mrs Quilp ’s parent was known to be laudably shrewish in her disposition and inclined to resist male authority ; thirdly , because each visitor wished to show for herself how superior she was in this respect to the generality of her sex ; and fourthly , because the company being accustomed to scandalise each other in pairs , were deprived of their usual subject of conversation now that they were all assembled in close friendship , and had consequently no better employment than to attack the common enemy . Moved by these considerations , a stout lady opened the proceedings by inquiring , with an air of great concern and sympathy , how Mr Quilp was ; whereunto Mr Quilp ’s wife ’s mother replied sharply , ‘
13719	13742	13769	13770	Miss Jiniwin	87	’ All the ladies then sighed in concert , shook their heads gravely , and looked at Mrs Quilp as a martyr . ‘
13745	13750	13769	13770	Miss Jiniwin	87	’ said the spokeswoman , ‘
13789	13790	13794	13794	ma’am	609	’ ‘
13796	13801	13794	13794	ma’am	609	’ replied Mrs Jiniwin . ‘
13828	13886	13887	13887	You	0	’ The good old lady did not finish the sentence , but she twisted off the head of a shrimp with a vindictiveness which seemed to imply that the action was in some degree a substitute for words . In this light it was clearly understood by the other party , who immediately replied with great approbation , ‘
13906	13907	13904	13904	myself	0	’ ‘
13917	13922	13909	13909	you	0	’ said Mrs Jiniwin . ‘
13939	13940	13936	13936	I	0	’ ‘
13953	13959	13947	13947	she	616	’ rejoined the stout lady . ‘
13967	13977	13965	13965	Betsy	89	’ said Mrs Jiniwin , in a warning voice . ‘
13998	14001	13996	13996	I	0	‘ em ! ’
14263	14271	14273	14273	I	0	’ said Mrs Quilp with much simplicity , ‘
14300	14364	14294	14294	he	627	’ There was quite a scream of indignation at this idea . Marry whom he pleased ! They would like to see him dare to think of marrying any of them ; they would like to see the faintest approach to such a thing . One lady ( a widow ) was quite certain she should stab him if he hinted at it . ‘
14368	14377	14379	14379	I	0	’ said Mrs Quilp , nodding her head , ‘
14401	14446	14392	14392	I	0	’m sure -- Quilp has such a way with him when he likes , that the best looking woman here could n’t refuse him if I was dead , and she was free , and he chose to make love to her . Come ! ’
14460	14475	14447	14447	Everybody	617	‘ I know you mean me . Let him try -- that ’s all . ’
14521	14525	14527	14528	Mrs Quilp	83	‘ Mother knows , ’
14530	14557	14527	14528	Mrs Quilp	83	‘ that what I say is quite correct , for she often said so before we were married . Did n’t you say so , mother ? ’
14690	14708	14710	14712	the old lady	642	‘ Oh ! It ’s a sensible and proper thing indeed , what Mrs George has said ! ’
14714	14734	14710	14712	the old lady	642	‘ If women are only true to themselves!--But Betsy is n’t , and more ’s the shame and pity . ’
14735	14750	14752	14753	Mrs George	91	‘ Before I ’d let a man order me about as Quilp orders her , ’
14755	14790	14752	14753	Mrs George	91	‘ before I ’d consent to stand in awe of a man as she does of him , I’d -- I’d kill myself , and write a letter first to say he did it ! ’
14812	14822	14824	14825	this lady	645	‘ Mr Quilp may be a very nice man , ’
14827	14922	14824	14825	this lady	645	‘ and I supposed there ’s no doubt he is , because Mrs Quilp says he is , and Mrs Jiniwin says he is , and they ought to know , or nobody does . But still he is not quite a -- what one calls a handsome man , nor quite a young man neither , which might be a little excuse for him if anything could be ; whereas his wife is young , and is good - looking , and is a woman -- which is the greatest thing after all . ’
14964	14969	14971	14972	the mother	650	‘ If he is ! ’
14996	15058	14971	14972	the mother	650	‘ If he is ! He is the greatest tyrant that every lived , she dare n’t call her soul her own , he makes her tremble with a word and even with a look , he frightens her to death , and she has n’t the spirit to give him a word back , no , not a single word . ’
15159	15187	15154	15154	she	91	‘ No , Henrietta Simmons , unless I see it with my own eyes and hear it with my own ears , I never will believe it . ’
15453	15462	15464	15464	Daniel	84	‘ Go on , ladies , go on , ’
15466	15491	15464	15464	Daniel	84	‘ Mrs Quilp , pray ask the ladies to stop to supper , and have a couple of lobsters and something light and palatable . ’
15492	15505	15507	15508	his wife	6127	‘ I -- I -- didn’t ask them to tea , Quilp , ’
15510	15517	15507	15508	his wife	6127	‘ It ’s quite an accident . ’
15518	15535	15537	15538	the dwarf	6020	‘ So much the better , Mrs Quilp ; these accidental parties are always the pleasantest , ’
15568	15583	15546	15546	he	6020	‘ What ! Not going , ladies , you are not going , surely ! ’
15627	15637	15639	15641	the old lady	642	‘ And why not stop to supper , Quilp , ’
15643	15651	15639	15641	the old lady	642	‘ if my daughter had a mind ? ’
15652	15657	15659	15659	Daniel	84	‘ To be sure , ’
15661	15665	15659	15659	Daniel	84	‘ Why not ? ’
15666	15680	15682	15683	Mrs Jiniwin	88	‘ There ’s nothing dishonest or wrong in a supper , I hope ? ’
15685	15689	15691	15692	the dwarf	6020	‘ Surely not , ’
15694	15717	15659	15659	Daniel	84	‘ Why should there be ? Nor anything unwholesome , either , unless there ’s lobster - salad or prawns , which I ’m
15725	15726	15659	15659	Daniel	84	’ ‘
15751	15756	15749	15749	you	6020	’ said Mrs Jiniwin . ‘
15764	15772	15749	15749	you	6020	’ replied the dwarf with a grin . ‘
15798	15799	15800	15800	My	0	’ ‘
15811	15836	15806	15807	Mr Quilp	84	’ said the old lady with a giggle , meant for satirical and to imply that he needed to be reminded of the fact ; ‘
15841	15842	15806	15807	Mr Quilp	84	’ ‘
15853	15858	15850	15850	she	6133	’ observed the dwarf . ‘
15875	15900	15873	15873	Quilp	84	’ said the old lady trembling , partly with anger and partly with a secret fear of her impish son - in - law . ‘
15905	15909	15926	15927	Mrs Jiniwin	88	’ he replied . ‘
15929	15952	15926	15927	Mrs Jiniwin	88	‘ I know she ought to have , Quilp , and would have , if she was of my way of thinking . ’
15953	15968	15970	15971	the dwarf	6020	‘ Why an’t you of your mother ’s way of thinking , my dear ? ’
15980	16017	15970	15971	the dwarf	6020	‘ why do n’t you always imitate your mother , my dear ? She ’s the ornament of her sex -- your father said so every day of his life . I am sure he did . ’
16018	16036	16038	16039	Mrs Jiniwin	88	‘ Her father was a blessed creetur , Quilp , and worthy twenty thousand of some people , ’
16041	16047	16038	16039	Mrs Jiniwin	88	‘ twenty hundred million thousand . ’
16048	16057	16059	16060	the dwarf	6020	‘ I should like to have known him , ’
16062	16075	15970	15971	the dwarf	6020	‘ I dare say he was a blessed creature then ; but I ’m
16096	16129	16087	16087	I	0	’ The old lady gave a gasp , but nothing came of it ; Quilp resumed , with the same malice in his eye and the same sarcastic politeness on his tongue . ‘
16165	16166	16167	16167	I	0	’ ‘
16180	16181	16174	16174	Quilp	84	’ ‘
16194	16287	16288	16289	Mrs Quilp	83	’ said the dwarf . The old woman looked angrily at him , but retreated as he advanced , and falling back before him , suffered him to shut the door upon her and bolt her out among the guests , who were by this time crowding downstairs . Being left along with his wife , who sat trembling in a corner with her eyes fixed upon the ground , the little man planted himself before her , and folding his arms looked steadily at her for a long time without speaking . ‘
16291	16297	16288	16289	Mrs Quilp	83	’ he said at last . ‘
16302	16345	16346	16347	Mrs Quilp	83	’ she replead meekly . Instead of pursuing the theme he had in his mind , Quilp folded his arms again , and looked at her more sternly than before , while she averted her eyes and kept them on the ground . ‘
16349	16350	16353	16353	Quilp	83	’ ‘
16355	16356	16353	16353	Quilp	83	’ ‘
16371	16461	16366	16366	I	0	’ With this laconic threat , which he accompanied with a snarl that gave him the appearance of being particularly in earnest , Mr Quilp bade her clear the teaboard away , and bring the rum . The spirit being set before him in a huge case - bottle , which had originally come out of some ship ’s locker , he settled himself in an arm - chair with his large head and face squeezed up against the back , and his little legs planted on the table . ‘
16467	16471	16464	16465	Mrs Quilp	83	’ he said ; ‘
16503	16513	16516	16516	Quilp	83	’ His wife returned no other reply than the necessary ‘
16518	16940	16516	16516	Quilp	83	’ and the small lord of the creation took his first cigar and mixed his first glass of grog . The sun went down and the stars peeped out , the Tower turned from its own proper colours to grey and from grey to black , the room became perfectly dark and the end of the cigar a deep fiery red , but still Mr Quilp went on smoking and drinking in the same position , and staring listlessly out of window with the doglike smile always on his face , save when Mrs Quilp made some involuntary movement of restlessness or fatigue ; and then it expanded into a grin of delight . CHAPTER 5 Whether Mr Quilp took any sleep by snatches of a few winks at a time , or whether he sat with his eyes wide open all night long , certain it is that he kept his cigar alight , and kindled every fresh one from the ashes of that which was nearly consumed , without requiring the assistance of a candle . Nor did the striking of the clocks , hour after hour , appear to inspire him with any sense of drowsiness or any natural desire to go to rest , but rather to increase his wakefulness , which he showed , at every such indication of the progress of the night , by a suppressed cackling in his throat , and a motion of his shoulders , like one who laughs heartily but the same time slyly and by stealth . At length the day broke , and poor Mrs Quilp , shivering with cold of early morning and harassed by fatigue and want of sleep , was discovered sitting patiently on her chair , raising her eyes at intervals in mute appeal to the compassion and clemency of her lord , and gently reminding him by an occasion cough that she was still unpardoned and that her penance had been of long duration . But her dwarfish spouse still smoked his cigar and drank his rum without heeding her ; and it was not until the sun had some time risen , and the activity and noise of city day were rife in the street , that he deigned to recognize her presence by any word or sign . He might not have done so even then , but for certain impatient tapping at the door he seemed to denote that some pretty hard knuckles were actively engaged upon the other side . ‘
16945	16955	16943	16943	me	0	’ he said looking round with a malicious grin , ‘
16968	17111	16964	16966	sweet Mrs Quilp	83	’ His obedient wife withdrew the bolt , and her lady mother entered . Now , Mrs Jiniwin bounced into the room with great impetuosity ; for , supposing her son - in - law to be still a - bed , she had come to relieve her feelings by pronouncing a strong opinion upon his general conduct and character . Seeing that he was up and dressed , and that the room appeared to have been occupied ever since she quitted it on the previous evening , she stopped short , in some embarrassment . Nothing escaped the hawk ’s eye of the ugly little man , who , perfectly understanding what passed in the old lady ’s mind , turned uglier still in the fulness of his satisfaction , and bade her good morning , with a leer or triumph . ‘
17116	17122	17114	17114	Betsy	89	’ said the old woman , ‘
17138	17139	17128	17128	you	89	’ ‘
17145	17156	17128	17128	you	89	’ said Quilp , supplying the conclusion of the sentence . ‘
17161	17162	17158	17158	she	687	’ ‘
17166	17171	17158	17158	she	687	’ cried Mrs Jiniwin . ‘
17184	17198	17178	17181	the dear old lady	688	’ said Quilp , with a smile of which a frown was part . ‘
17216	17217	17218	17218	You	89	’ ‘
17219	17223	17225	17226	Mrs Jiniwin	88	’re a brute ! ’
17228	17232	17234	17234	Quilp	83	‘ Come come , ’
17243	17305	17234	17234	Quilp	83	‘ you must n’t call her names . She ’s married now , you know . And though she did beguile the time and keep me from my bed , you must not be so tenderly careful of me as to be out of humour with her . Bless you for a dear old lady . Here ’s to your health ! ’
17306	17314	17316	17318	the old woman	6151	‘ I am much obliged to you , ’
17344	17348	17333	17333	her	6151	‘ Oh ! I ’m
17355	17356	17357	17358	Grateful soul	693	’ ‘
17360	17365	17366	17367	Mrs Quilp	83	’ cried the dwarf . ‘
17369	17370	17366	17367	Mrs Quilp	83	’ ‘
17375	17381	17373	17373	Quilp	83	’ said the timid sufferer . ‘
17410	17605	17389	17390	Mrs Quilp	83	’ Mrs Jiniwin made a faint demonstration of rebellion by sitting down in a chair near the door and folding her arms as if in a resolute determination to do nothing . But a few whispered words from her daughter , and a kind inquiry from her son - in - law whether she felt faint , with a hint that there was abundance of cold water in the next apartment , routed these symptoms effectually , and she applied herself to the prescribed preparations with sullen diligence . While they were in progress , Mr Quilp withdrew to the adjoining room , and , turning back his coat - collar , proceeded to smear his countenance with a damp towel of very unwholesome appearance , which made his complexion rather more cloudy than it was before . But , while he was thus engaged , his caution and inquisitiveness did not forsake him , for with a face as sharp and cunning as ever , he often stopped , even in this short process , and stood listening for any conversation in the next room , of which he might be the theme . ‘
17608	17618	17389	17390	Mrs Quilp	83	’ he said after a short effort of attention , ‘
17635	17652	17634	17634	I	0	’m a little hunchy villain and a monster , am I , Mrs Jiniwin ? Oh ! ’
17827	17838	17806	17817	the dwarf , turning about with a perfectly bland and placid look	699	‘ How are you now , my dear old darling ? ’
18567	18570	18553	18554	Mr Quilp	84	‘ punched it ’
18574	18582	18584	18585	the boy	423	‘ Come , you let me alone , ’
18597	18616	18584	18585	the boy	423	‘ You ’ll get something you wo n’t like if you do n’t and so I tell you . ’
18617	18621	18623	18623	Quilp	84	‘ You dog , ’
18625	18659	18623	18623	Quilp	84	‘ I ’ll beat you with an iron rod , I ’ll scratch you with a rusty nail , I ’ll pinch your eyes , if you talk to me -- I will . ’
18713	18721	18723	18724	the boy	423	‘ You wo n’t do it agin , ’
18743	18745	18723	18724	the boy	423	‘ now-- ’
18746	18753	18755	18755	Quilp	84	‘ Stand still , you dog , ’
18757	18782	18755	18755	Quilp	84	‘ I wo n’t do it again , because I ’ve done it as often as I want . Here . Take the key . ’
18783	18794	18796	18797	the boy	423	‘ Why do n’t you hit one of your size ? ’
18802	18814	18816	18816	Quilp	84	‘ Where is there one of my size , you dog ? ’
18818	18843	18816	18816	Quilp	84	‘ Take the key , or I ’ll brain you with it’--indeed he gave him a smart tap with the handle as he spoke . ‘
18852	18977	18816	18816	Quilp	84	’ The boy sulkily complied , muttering at first , but desisting when he looked round and saw that Quilp was following him with a steady look . And here it may be remarked , that between this boy and the dwarf there existed a strange kind of mutual liking . How born or bred , and or nourished upon blows and threats on one side , and retorts and defiances on the other , is not to the purpose . Quilp would certainly suffer nobody to contract him but the boy , and the boy would assuredly not have submitted to be so knocked about by anybody but Quilp , when he had the power to run away at any time he chose . ‘
18980	18992	18993	18993	you	731	’ said Quilp , passing into the wooden counting - house , ‘
19014	19351	19005	19005	I	0	’ The boy made no answer , but directly Quilp had shut himself in , stood on his head before the door , then walked on his hands to the back and stood on his head there , and then to the opposite side and repeated the performance . There were indeed four sides to the counting - house , but he avoided that one where the window was , deeming it probable that Quilp would be looking out of it . This was prudent , for in point of fact , the dwarf , knowing his disposition , was lying in wait at a little distance from the sash armed with a large piece of wood , which , being rough and jagged and studded in many parts with broken nails , might possibly have hurt him . It was a dirty little box , this counting - house , with nothing in it but an old ricketty desk and two stools , a hat - peg , an ancient almanack , an inkstand with no ink , and the stump of one pen , and an eight - day clock which had n’t gone for eighteen years at least , and of which the minute - hand had been twisted off for a tooth - pick . Daniel Quilp pulled his hat over his brows , climbed on to the desk ( which had a flat top ) and stretching his short length upon it went to sleep with ease of an old practitioner ; intending , no doubt , to compensate himself for the deprivation of last night ’s rest , by a long and sound nap . Sound it might have been , but long it was not , for he had not been asleep a quarter of an hour when the boy opened the door and thrust in his head , which was like a bundle of badly - picked oakum . Quilp was a light sleeper and started up directly . ‘
19358	19363	19005	19005	I	0	’ said the boy . ‘
19366	19367	19368	19368	I	0	’ ‘
19373	19374	19368	19368	I	0	’ ‘
19377	19414	19368	19368	I	0	’ said Quilp , seizing the trifle of wood before mentioned and throwing it at him with such dexterity that it was well the boy disappeared before it reached the spot on which he had stood . ‘
19420	19454	19457	19457	Nelly	72	’ Not caring to venture within range of such missles again , the boy discreetly sent in his stead the first cause of the interruption , who now presented herself at the door . ‘
19459	19463	19457	19457	Nelly	72	’ cried Quilp . ‘
19466	19513	19520	19520	Quilp	84	’ said the child , hesitating whether to enter or retreat , for the dwarf just roused , with his dishevelled hair hanging all about him and a yellow handkerchief over his head , was something fearful to behold ; it ’s only me , sir . ’
19514	19518	19520	19520	Quilp	84	‘ Come in , ’
19528	19553	19520	19520	Quilp	84	‘ Come in . Stay . Just look out into the yard , and see whether there ’s a boy standing on his head . ’
19554	19559	19561	19561	Nell	72	‘ No , sir , ’
19563	19570	19561	19561	Nell	72	‘ He ’s on his feet . ’
19571	19573	19520	19520	Quilp	84	‘ You ’re
19578	19582	19520	19520	Quilp	84	’ said Quilp . ‘
19601	19926	19599	19599	Nelly	72	’ The child handed him a letter . Mr Quilp , without changing his position further than to turn over a little more on his side and rest his chin on his hand , proceeded to make himself acquainted with its contents . CHAPTER 6 Little Nell stood timidly by , with her eyes raised to the countenance of Mr Quilp as he read the letter , plainly showing by her looks that while she entertained some fear and distrust of the little man , she was much inclined to laugh at his uncouth appearance and grotesque attitude . And yet there was visible on the part of the child a painful anxiety for his reply , and consciousness of his power to render it disagreeable or distressing , which was strongly at variance with this impulse and restrained it more effectually than she could possibly have done by any efforts of her own . That Mr Quilp was himself perplexed , and that in no small degree , by the contents of the letter , was sufficiently obvious . Before he had got through the first two or three lines he began to open his eyes very wide and to frown most horribly , the next two or three caused him to scratch his head in an uncommonly vicious manner , and when he came to the conclusion he gave a long dismal whistle indicative of surprise and dismay . After folding and laying it down beside him , he bit the nails of all of his ten fingers with extreme voracity ; and taking it up sharply , read it again . The second perusal was to all appearance as unsatisfactory as the first , and plunged him into a profound reverie from which he awakened to another assault upon his nails and a long stare at the child , who with her eyes turned towards the ground awaited his further pleasure . ‘
19930	19962	19963	19963	Nelly	72	’ he said at length , in a voice , and with a suddenness , which made the child start as though a gun had been fired off at her ear . ‘
19965	19966	19969	19969	sir	5863	’ ‘
19971	19972	19969	19969	sir	5863	’ ‘
19984	19985	19974	19974	you	72	’ ‘
19990	19991	19988	19988	sir	5863	’ ‘
20006	20007	20011	20011	sir	5863	’ ‘
20013	20014	20011	20011	sir	5863	’ ‘
20028	20033	20016	20016	you	72	’ said the dwarf . ‘
20040	20045	20035	20035	I	0	’ returned the child . ‘
20048	20058	20059	20059	I	0	’ muttered Quilp as he marked her earnest look . ‘
20091	20159	20160	20160	You	72	’ This reflection set him scratching his head and biting his nails once more . While he was thus employed his features gradually relaxed into what was with him a cheerful smile , but which in any other man would have been a ghastly grin of pain , and when the child looked up again she found that he was regarding her with extraordinary favour and complacency . ‘
20179	20180	20177	20177	Nelly	72	’ ‘
20186	20204	20185	20185	I	0	’m in a hurry to get back , for he will be anxious while I am away . ’
20205	20219	20221	20221	Quilp	84	‘ There ’s no hurry , little Nell , no hurry at all , ’
20223	20236	20221	20221	Quilp	84	‘ How should you like to be my number two , Nelly ? ’
20237	20244	20185	20185	I	0	‘ To be what , sir ? ’
20245	20259	20261	20262	the dwarf	6020	‘ My number two , Nelly , my second , my Mrs Quilp , ’
20289	20308	20310	20310	Quilp	83	‘ To be Mrs Quilp the second , when Mrs Quilp the first is dead , sweet Nell , ’
20326	20399	20310	20310	Quilp	83	‘ to be my wife , my little cherry - cheeked , red - lipped wife . Say that Mrs Quilp lives five year , or only four , you ’ll be just the proper age for me . Ha ha ! Be a good girl , Nelly , a very good girl , and see if one of these days you do n’t come to be Mrs Quilp of Tower Hill . ’
20501	20519	20521	20522	the dwarf	6020	‘ You shall come with me to Tower Hill and see Mrs Quilp that is , directly , ’
20524	20549	20521	20522	the dwarf	6020	‘ She ’s very fond of you , Nell , though not so fond as I am . You shall come home with me . ’
20550	20557	20559	20560	the child	324	‘ I must go back indeed , ’
20562	20574	20559	20560	the child	324	‘ He told me to return directly I had the answer . ’
20575	20584	20586	20587	the dwarf	6020	‘ But you have n’t it , Nelly , ’
20589	20637	20586	20587	the dwarf	6020	‘ and wo n’t have it , and ca n’t have it , until I have been home , so you see that to do your errand , you must go with me . Reach me yonder hat , my dear , and we ’ll go directly . ’
20724	20729	20731	20731	Nelly	72	‘ It ’s Kit ! ’
20737	20754	20731	20731	Nelly	72	‘ poor Kit who came with me ! Oh , pray stop them , Mr Quilp ! ’
20755	20759	20731	20731	Nelly	72	‘ I ’ll stop ‘
20762	20780	20731	20731	Nelly	72	’ cried Quilp , diving into the little counting - house and returning with a thick stick , ‘
20784	20814	20731	20731	Nelly	72	‘ em . Now , my boys , fight away . I ’ll fight you both . I ’ll take both of you , both together , both together ! ’
20911	20923	20925	20925	Quilp	84	‘ I ’ll beat you to a pulp , you dogs , ’
20940	20947	20925	20925	Quilp	84	‘ I ’ll bruise you until you ’re
20969	20970	20966	20966	I	0	’ ‘
20985	21001	21002	21002	you	755	’ said his boy , dodging round him and watching an opportunity to rush in ; ‘
21007	21008	21002	21002	you	755	’ ‘
21026	21034	21023	21023	you	755	’ said Quilp , with gleaming eyes ; ‘
21042	21149	21023	21023	you	755	’ But the boy declined the invitation until his master was apparently a little off his guard , when he darted in and seizing the weapon tried to wrest it from his grasp . Quilp , who was as strong as a lion , easily kept his hold until the boy was tugging at it with his utmost power , when he suddenly let it go and sent him reeling backwards , so that he fell violently upon his head . The success of this manoeuvre tickled Mr Quilp beyond description , and he laughed and stamped upon the ground as at a most irresistible jest . ‘
21153	21169	21170	21170	you	755	’ said the boy , nodding his head and rubbing it at the same time ; ‘
21184	21201	21181	21181	they	451	’re an uglier dwarf than can be seen anywheres for a penny , that ’s all . ’
21202	21210	21213	21213	you	755	‘ Do you mean to say , I ’m
21216	21220	21213	21213	you	755	’ returned Quilp . ‘
21223	21228	21213	21213	you	755	’ retorted the boy . ‘
21242	21246	21248	21248	he	760	’ said Quilp . ‘
21252	21261	21248	21248	he	760	’ replied the boy , pointing to Kit , ‘
21267	21268	21248	21248	he	760	’ ‘
21275	21279	21272	21272	he	760	’ bawled Kit , ‘
21307	21308	21303	21303	he	760	’ ‘
21328	21342	21321	21321	you	755	’re very wise and clever -- almost too clever to live , unless you ’re
21350	21373	21348	21348	Kit	75	’ said Quilp , with great suavity in his manner , but still more of quiet malice about his eyes and mouth . ‘
21412	21568	21403	21403	you	755	’ The other boy , to whom this order was addressed , did as he was told , and was rewarded for his partizanship in behalf of his master , by a dexterous rap on the nose with the key , which brought the water into his eyes . Then Mr Quilp departed with the child and Kit in a boat , and the boy revenged himself by dancing on his head at intervals on the extreme verge of the wharf , during the whole time they crossed the river . There was only Mrs Quilp at home , and she , little expecting the return of her lord , was just composing herself for a refreshing slumber when the sound of his footsteps roused her . She had barely time to seem to be occupied in some needle - work , when he entered , accompanied by the child ; having left Kit downstairs . ‘
21578	21583	21575	21576	Mrs Quilp	83	’ said her husband . ‘
21619	21656	21604	21604	She	97	’ Mrs Quilp looked tremblingly in her spouse ’s face to know what this unusual courtesy might portend , and obedient to the summons she saw in his gesture , followed him into the next room . ‘
21664	21668	21659	21659	I	0	’ whispered Quilp . ‘
21743	21744	21740	21740	you	83	’ ‘
21749	21750	21747	21747	Quilp	83	’ ‘
21760	21761	21762	21763	Dear Quilp	98	’ ‘
21765	21770	21762	21763	Dear Quilp	98	’ faltered his wife . ‘
21785	21831	21784	21784	her--	774	’ The dwarf muttering a terrible oath looked round as if for some weapon with which to inflict condign punishment upon his disobedient wife . The submissive little woman hurriedly entreated him not to be angry , and promised to do as he bade her . ‘
21837	21847	21835	21835	me	0	’ whispered Quilp , nipping and pinching her arm ; ‘
21860	21867	21835	21835	me	0	’m listening , recollect . If you ’re
21892	21987	21835	21835	me	0	’ Mrs Quilp departed according to order , and her amiable husband , ensconcing himself behind the partly opened door , and applying his ear close to it , began to listen with a face of great craftiness and attention . Poor Mrs Quilp was thinking , however , in what manner to begin or what kind of inquiries she could make ; and it was not until the door , creaking in a very urgent manner , warned her to proceed without further consideration , that the sound of her voice was heard . ‘
22005	22006	21991	21991	you	83	’ ‘
22018	22023	22007	22007	I	0	’ returned Nell innocently . ‘
22032	22033	22027	22027	he	382	’ ‘
22081	22082	22101	22101	your	83	’ ‘
22087	22099	22101	22101	your	83	’ returned Mrs Quilp , with an uneasy glance towards it . ‘
22112	22113	22104	22104	he	382	’ ‘
22118	22124	22104	22104	he	382	’ said the child eagerly , ‘
22154	22155	22156	22156	I	0	’ ‘
22173	22184	22165	22165	you	83	’ said Mrs Quilp . And she spoke the truth . ‘
22188	22197	22198	22198	you	83	’ returned the child , kissing her cheek , ‘
22261	22262	22263	22263	He	382	’ ‘
22270	22275	22263	22263	He	382	’ said Mrs Quilp , ‘
22283	22284	22268	22268	Nelly	97	’ ‘
22296	22304	22288	22288	God	71	’ said the child with streaming eyes ; ‘
22327	22328	22321	22321	I	0	’ ‘
22334	22341	22321	22321	I	0	’ said Mrs Quilp , faintly . ‘
22344	22345	22321	22321	I	0	’ ‘
22368	22373	22374	22374	I	0	’ said the child . ‘
22472	22473	22474	22474	Nelly	97	’ ‘
22478	22484	22476	22476	Nelly	97	’ said the poor woman , ‘
22504	22505	22506	22506	I	0	’ ‘
22512	22516	22506	22506	I	0	’ said Nell , ‘
22575	22587	22553	22553	I	0	’ Mrs Quilp turned away her head and made no answer . ‘
22590	22595	22553	22553	I	0	’ said the child , ‘
22705	22724	22726	22726	you	791	’ She paused here , but though the door creaked more than once , Mrs Quilp said nothing . ‘
22731	22737	22765	22765	he	382	’ said the child earnestly , ‘
22782	22783	22777	22777	he	382	’ ‘
22792	22797	22787	22787	he	382	’ said Mrs Quilp . ‘
22804	22808	22801	22801	he	382	’ cried Nell , ‘
22872	22873	22874	22874	Nelly	97	’ ‘
22876	22877	22874	22874	Nelly	97	’ ‘
22880	22895	22874	22874	Nelly	97	’ said the child , laying her finger on her lip and looking round . ‘
23024	23140	23141	23141	She	324	’ The fountains of her heart were opened ; the child , overpowered by the weight of her sorrows and anxieties , by the first confidence she had ever shown , and the sympathy with which her little tale had been received , hid her face in the arms of her helpless friend , and burst into a passion of tears . In a few minutes Mr Quilp returned , and expressed the utmost surprise to find her in this condition , which he did very naturally and with admirable effect , for that kind of acting had been rendered familiar to him by long practice , and he was quite at home in it . ‘
23150	23171	23147	23148	Mrs Quilp	83	’ said the dwarf , squinting in a hideous manner to imply that his wife was to follow his lead . ‘
23219	23295	23216	23217	Poor Nell	72	’ Mr Quilp unintentionally adopted the very best means he could have devised for the recovery of his young visitor , by patting her on the head . Such an application from any other hand might not have produced a remarkable effect , but the child shrank so quickly from his touch and felt such an instinctive desire to get out of his reach , that she rose directly and declared herself ready to return . ‘
23310	23315	23305	23306	Mrs Quilp	83	’ said the dwarf . ‘
23327	23335	23323	23323	sir	5863	’ returned Nell , drying her eyes . ‘
23338	23343	23349	23349	you	72	’ said Mr Quilp , ‘
23410	23496	23497	23497	You	72	’ Kit , who appeared at the summons , deigned to make no reply to so needless an injunction , and after staring at Quilp in a threatening manner , as if he doubted whether he might not have been the cause of Nelly shedding tears , and felt more than half disposed to revenge the fact upon him on the mere suspicion , turned about and followed his young mistress , who had by this time taken her leave of Mrs Quilp and departed . ‘
23498	23509	23511	23512	the dwarf	6020	’re a keen questioner , an’t you , Mrs Quilp ? ’
23525	23532	23534	23535	his wife	6127	‘ What more could I do ? ’
23538	23545	23547	23547	Quilp	83	‘ What more could you do ! ’
23549	23582	23547	23547	Quilp	83	‘ could n’t you have done something less ? Could n’t you have done what you had to do , without appearing in your favourite part of the crocodile , you minx ? ’
23583	23594	23596	23597	his wife	6127	‘ I am very sorry for the child , Quilp , ’
23599	23630	23596	23597	his wife	6127	‘ Surely I ’ve done enough . I ’ve led her on to tell her secret she supposed we were alone ; and you were by , God forgive me . ’
23631	23644	23646	23646	Quilp	83	‘ You led her on ! You did a great deal truly ! ’
23648	23701	23646	23646	Quilp	83	‘ What did I tell you about making me creak the door ? It ’s lucky for you that from what she let fall , I ’ve got the clue I want , for if I had n’t , I ’d have visited the failure upon you , I can tell you . ’
23721	23745	23714	23715	Her husband	6101	‘ But you may thank your fortunate stars -- the same stars that made you Mrs Quilp -- you may thank them that I ’m
23795	23968	23969	23969	Fred	79	’ So saying , Mr Quilp put his hat on and took himself off , and Mrs Quilp , who was afflicted beyond measure by the recollection of the part she had just acted , shut herself up in her chamber , and smothering her head in the bed - clothes bemoaned her fault more bitterly than many less tender - hearted persons would have mourned a much greater offence ; for , in the majority of cases , conscience is an elastic and very flexible article , which will bear a deal of stretching and adapt itself to a great variety of circumstances . Some people by prudent management and leaving it off piece by piece like a flannel waistcoat in warm weather , even contrive , in time , to dispense with it altogether ; but there be others who can assume the garment and throw it off at pleasure ; and this , being the greatest and most convenient improvement , is the one most in vogue . CHAPTER 7 ‘
23971	23976	23969	23969	Fred	79	’ said Mr Swiveller , ‘
24005	24226	23969	23969	Fred	79	’ Mr Richard Swiveller ’s apartments were in the neighbourhood of Drury Lane , and in addition to this convenience of situation had the advantage of being over a tobacconist ’s shop , so that he was enabled to procure a refreshing sneeze at any time by merely stepping out upon the staircase , and was saved the trouble and expense of maintaining a snuff - box . It was in these apartments that Mr Swiveller made use of the expressions above recorded for the consolation and encouragement of his desponding friend ; and it may not be uninteresting or improper to remark that even these brief observations partook in a double sense of the figurative and poetical character of Mr Swiveller ’s mind , as the rosy wine was in fact represented by one glass of cold gin - and - water , which was replenished as occasion required from a bottle and jug upon the table , and was passed from one to another , in a scarcity of tumblers which , as Mr Swiveller ’s was a bachelor ’s establishment , may be acknowledged without a blush . By a like pleasant fiction his single chamber was always mentioned in a plural number . In its disengaged times , the tobacconist had announced it in his window as ‘
24228	24464	24465	24465	Fred	79	’ for a single gentleman , and Mr Swiveller , following up the hint , never failed to speak of it as his rooms , his lodgings , or his chambers , conveying to his hearers a notion of indefinite space , and leaving their imaginations to wander through long suites of lofty halls , at pleasure . In this flight of fancy , Mr Swiveller was assisted by a deceptive piece of furniture , in reality a bedstead , but in semblance a bookcase , which occupied a prominent situation in his chamber and seemed to defy suspicion and challenge inquiry . There is no doubt that by day Mr Swiveller firmly believed this secret convenience to be a bookcase and nothing more ; that he closed his eyes to the bed , resolutely denied the existence of the blankets , and spurned the bolster from his thoughts . No word of its real use , no hint of its nightly service , no allusion to its peculiar properties , had ever passed between him and his most intimate friends . Implicit faith in the deception was the first article of his creed . To be the friend of Swiveller you must reject all circumstantial evidence , all reason , observation , and experience , and repose a blind belief in the bookcase . It was his pet weakness , and he cherished it . ‘
24467	24484	24465	24465	Fred	79	’ said Mr Swiveller , finding that his former adjuration had been productive of no effect . ‘
24489	24517	24465	24465	Fred	79	’ Young Trent with an impatient gesture pushed the glass towards him , and fell again in the moody attitude from which he had been unwillingly roused . ‘
24525	24534	24523	24523	Fred	79	’ said his friend , stirring the mixture , ‘
24547	24548	24549	24549	Pshaw	101	’ ‘
24551	24556	24557	24557	You	79	’ interposed the other . ‘
24574	24575	24566	24566	You	79	’ ‘
24581	24585	24578	24579	Mr Trent	102	’ returned Dick , ‘
24631	24644	24578	24579	Mr Trent	102	’m one of the first sort . If the proverb ’s a good ‘
24683	24684	24678	24679	neither one	813	’ ‘
24687	24694	24678	24679	neither one	813	’ muttered his friend , peevishly . ‘
24700	24705	24678	24679	neither one	813	’ said Mr Swiveller . ‘
24738	24755	24734	24734	yourself	79	’ adding to this retort an observation to the effect that his friend appeared to be rather ‘
24757	24797	24798	24798	Gentlemen	501	’ in point of temper , Richard Swiveller finished the rosy and applied himself to the composition of another glassful , in which , after tasting it with great relish , he proposed a toast to an imaginary company . ‘
24832	24839	24827	24828	Mr Richard	78	’ said Dick with great emphasis , ‘
24859	24860	24861	24861	Dick	77	’ ‘
24863	24881	24861	24861	Dick	77	’ said the other , returning to his seat after having paced the room twice or thrice , ‘
24905	24906	24907	24907	You	0	’ ‘
24914	24918	24907	24907	You	0	’ returned Dick ; ‘
24927	24932	24954	24955	his companion	6044	‘ em but empty pockets-- ’
24933	24952	24954	24955	his companion	6044	‘ You ’ll tell a different story of this one , before a very long time is over , ’
24964	24971	24954	24955	his companion	6044	‘ You saw my sister Nell ? ’
24972	24977	24979	24979	Dick	77	‘ What about her ? ’
24981	24992	24979	24979	Dick	77	‘ She has a pretty face , has she not ? ’
24993	24998	25000	25000	Dick	77	‘ Why , certainly , ’
25002	25022	25000	25000	Dick	77	‘ I must say for her that there ’s not any very strong family likeness between her and you . ’
25023	25030	25032	25033	his friend	5985	‘ Has she a pretty face , ’
25036	25039	25041	25041	Dick	77	‘ Yes , ’
25043	25059	25041	25041	Dick	77	‘ she has a pretty face , a very pretty face . What of that ? ’
25060	25066	25068	25069	his friend	5985	‘ I ’ll tell you , ’
25071	25111	25068	25069	his friend	5985	‘ It ’s very plain that the old man and I will remain at daggers drawn to the end of our lives , and that I have nothing to expect from him . You see that , I suppose ? ’
25112	25124	25126	25126	Dick	77	‘ A bat might see that , with the sun shining , ’
25128	25168	25126	25126	Dick	77	‘ It ’s equally plain that the money which the old flint -- rot him -- first taught me to expect that I should share with her at his death , will all be hers , is it not ? ’
25169	25176	25178	25178	Dick	77	‘ I should said it was , ’
25180	25209	25178	25178	Dick	77	‘ unless the way in which I put the case to him , made an impression . It may have done so . It was powerful , Fred . ‘
25235	25236	25230	25230	you	77	’ ‘
25243	25248	25241	25241	him	824	’ returned the other , ‘
25265	25266	25260	25260	Nell	72	’ ‘
25276	25282	25270	25270	her	72	’ observed Richard Swiveller parenthetically . ‘
25296	25314	25316	25316	I	0	’ returned Trent , fretting at the slight interest the other appeared to take in the conversation . ‘
25317	25323	25316	25316	I	0	’m coming to the point . ’
25324	25329	25331	25331	Dick	77	‘ That ’s right , ’
25333	25413	25331	25331	Dick	77	‘ The girl has strong affections , and brought up as she has been , may , at her age , be easily influenced and persuaded . If I take her in hand , I will be bound by a very little coaxing and threatening to bend her to my will . Not to beat about the bush ( for the advantages of the scheme would take a week to tell ) what ’s to prevent your marrying her ? ’
25463	25466	25450	25450	he	78	‘ What ! ’
25467	25476	25478	25479	the other	5966	‘ I say , what ’s to prevent , ’
25502	25511	25478	25479	the other	5966	‘ what ’s to prevent your marrying her ? ’
25512	25520	25522	25522	Dick	77	‘ And she “ nearly fourteen ” ! ’
25524	25536	25522	25522	Dick	77	‘ I do n’t mean marrying her now’--returned the brother angrily ; ‘
25561	25562	25563	25563	He	384	’ ‘
25570	25577	25563	25563	He	384	’ said Dick shaking his head , ‘
25621	25646	25616	25616	her	832	’re so aggravating , so unprincipled , so spiteful -- unless there ’s apoplexy in the family , Fred , you ca n’t calculate upon ‘
25661	25662	25652	25652	they	831	’ ‘
25673	25689	25652	25652	they	831	’ said Trent as steadily as before , and keeping his eyes upon his friend . ‘
25694	25695	25691	25691	he	833	’ ‘
25700	25704	25691	25691	he	833	’ said Dick . ‘
25710	25711	25712	25712	I	0	’ ‘
25715	25720	25712	25712	I	0	’ resumed his friend , ‘
25755	25756	25748	25748	you	79	’ ‘
25768	25772	25774	25775	Richard Swiveller	78	‘ em on , ’
25780	25785	25787	25788	the other	5966	‘ I tell you , ’
25811	25890	25787	25788	the other	5966	‘ that he lives for her , that his whole energies and thoughts are bound up in her , that he would no more disinherit her for an act of disobedience than he would take me into his favour again for any act of obedience or virtue that I could possibly be guilty of . He could not do it . You or any other man with eyes in his head may see that , if he chooses . ’
25891	25897	25899	25899	Dick	77	‘ It seems improbable certainly , ’
25903	25912	25913	25914	his friend	5985	‘ It seems improbable because it is improbable , ’
25917	26046	25913	25914	his friend	5985	‘ If you would furnish him with an additional inducement to forgive you , let there be an irreconcilable breach , a most deadly quarrel , between you and me -- let there be a pretense of such a thing , I mean , of course -- and he ’ll do fast enough . As to Nell , constant dropping will wear away a stone ; you know you may trust to me as far as she is concerned . So , whether he lives or dies , what does it come to ? That you become the sole inheritor of the wealth of this rich old hunks , that you and I spend it together , and that you get into the bargain a beautiful young wife . ’
26047	26060	26064	26064	you	838	‘ I suppose there ’s no doubt about his being rich’--said Dick . ‘
26088	26333	26086	26086	Dick	77	’ It would be tedious to pursue the conversation through all its artful windings , or to develope the gradual approaches by which the heart of Richard Swiveller was gained . It is sufficient to know that vanity , interest , poverty , and every spendthrift consideration urged him to look upon the proposal with favour , and that where all other inducements were wanting , the habitual carelessness of his disposition stepped in and still weighed down the scale on the same side . To these impulses must be added the complete ascendancy which his friend had long been accustomed to exercise over him -- an ascendancy exerted in the beginning sorely at the expense of his friend ’s vices , and was in nine cases out of ten looked upon as his designing tempter when he was indeed nothing but his thoughtless , light - headed tool . The motives on the other side were something deeper than any which Richard Swiveller entertained or understood , but these being left to their own development , require no present elucidation . The negotiation was concluded very pleasantly , and Mr Swiveller was in the act of stating in flowery terms that he had no insurmountable objection to marrying anybody plentifully endowed with money or moveables , who could be induced to take him , when he was interrupted in his observations by a knock at the door , and the consequent necessity of crying ‘
26337	26497	26498	26498	Her	842	’ The door was opened , but nothing came in except a soapy arm and a strong gush of tobacco . The gush of tobacco came from the shop downstairs , and the soapy arm proceeded from the body of a servant - girl , who being then and there engaged in cleaning the stairs had just drawn it out of a warm pail to take in a letter , which letter she now held in her hand , proclaiming aloud with that quick perception of surnames peculiar to her class that it was for Mister Snivelling . Dick looked rather pale and foolish when he glanced at the direction , and still more so when he came to look at the inside , observing that it was one of the inconveniences of being a lady ’s man , and that it was very easy to talk as they had been talking , but he had quite forgotten her . ‘
26502	26506	26507	26508	Sophy Wackles	106	’ demanded Trent . ‘
26510	26514	26507	26508	Sophy Wackles	106	’ said Dick . ‘
26519	26520	26517	26517	she	842	’ ‘
26537	26547	26534	26534	she	842	’ said Mr Swiveller , taking a long pull at ‘
26550	26558	26559	26559	She	842	’ and looking gravely at his friend . ‘
26571	26572	26569	26569	her	842	’ ‘
26576	26582	26569	26569	her	842	’ said his companion carelessly . ‘

26593	26597	26591	26591	sir	5863	’ returned Dick , ‘

26677	26682	26674	26674	you	5863	’ demanded his friend ; ‘
26699	26700	26683	26683	you	5863	’ ‘
26711	26715	26674	26674	you	5863	’ said Dick . ‘

26750	26751	26755	26755	Fred	79	’ ‘
26842	27297	26840	26840	Fred	79	’ To solve this question , Mr Swiveller summoned the handmaid and ascertained that Miss Sophy Wackles had indeed left the letter with her own hands ; and that she had come accompanied , for decorum ’s sake no doubt , by a younger Miss Wackles ; and that on learning that Mr Swiveller was at home and being requested to walk upstairs , she was extremely shocked and professed that she would rather die . Mr Swiveller heard this account with a degree of admiration not altogether consistent with the project in which he had just concurred , but his friend attached very little importance to his behavior in this respect , probably because he knew that he had influence sufficient to control Richard Swiveller ’s proceedings in this or any other matter , whenever he deemed it necessary , for the advancement of his own purposes , to exert it . CHAPTER 8 Business disposed of , Mr Swiveller was inwardly reminded of its being nigh dinner - time , and to the intent that his health might not be endangered by longer abstinence , dispatched a message to the nearest eating - house requiring an immediate supply of boiled beef and greens for two . With this demand , however , the eating - house ( having experience of its customer ) declined to comply , churlishly sending back for answer that if Mr Swiveller stood in need of beef perhaps he would be so obliging as to come there and eat it , bringing with him , as grace before meat , the amount of a certain small account which had long been outstanding . Not at all intimidated by this rebuff , but rather sharpened in wits and appetite , Mr Swiveller forwarded the same message to another and more distant eating - house , adding to it by way of rider that the gentleman was induced to send so far , not only by the great fame and popularity its beef had acquired , but in consequence of the extreme toughness of the beef retailed at the obdurant cook ’s shop , which rendered it quite unfit not merely for gentlemanly food , but for any human consumption . The good effect of this politic course was demonstrated by the speedy arrival of a small pewter pyramid , curiously constructed of platters and covers , whereof the boiled - beef - plates formed the base , and a foaming quart - pot the apex ; the structure being resolved into its component parts afforded all things requisite and necessary for a hearty meal , to which Mr Swiveller and his friend applied themselves with great keenness and enjoyment . ‘
27303	27316	26840	26840	Fred	79	’ said Dick , sticking his fork into a large carbuncular potato , ‘
27330	27389	27438	27438	I	0	‘ em with the peel on ; there ’s a charm in drawing a potato from its native element ( if I may so express it ) to which the rich and powerful are strangers . Ah ! “ Man wants but little here below , nor wants that little long ! ” How true that is!--after dinner . ’
27390	27412	27414	27415	his companion	6044	‘ I hope the eating - house keeper will want but little and that he may not want that little long , ’

27442	27451	27438	27438	I	0	’ said Dick , winking his eye significantly . ‘
27473	27534	27463	27463	Fred	79	’ In point of fact , it would seem that the waiter felt this wholesome truth , for when he returned for the empty plates and dishes and was informed by Mr Swiveller with dignified carelessness that he would call and settle when he should be passing presently , he displayed some perturbation of spirit and muttered a few remarks about ‘
27538	27540	27463	27463	Fred	79	’ and ‘
27544	27652	27463	27463	Fred	79	’ and other unpleasant subjects , but was fain to content himself with inquiring at what hour it was likely that the gentleman would call , in order that being presently responsible for the beef , greens , and sundries , he might take to be in the way at the time . Mr Swiveller , after mentally calculating his engagements to a nicety , replied that he should look in at from two minutes before six and seven minutes past ; and the man disappearing with this feeble consolation , Richard Swiveller took a greasy memorandum - book from his pocket and made an entry therein . ‘
27666	27673	27677	27677	Fred	79	’ said Trent with a sneer . ‘
27679	27693	27694	27694	I	0	’ replied the imperturbable Richard , continuing to write with a businesslike air . ‘

28037	28043	28045	28045	Dick	77	‘ It ’s rather sudden , ’
28081	28235	28047	28047	his	77	‘ when the heart of a man is depressed with fears , the mist is dispelled when Miss Wackles appears ; she ’s a very nice girl . She ’s like the red red rose that ’s newly sprung in June -- there ’s no denying that -- she ’s also like a melody that ’s sweetly played in tune . It ’s really very sudden . Not that there ’s any need , on account of Fred ’s little sister , to turn cool directly , but its better not to go too far . If I begin to cool at all I must begin at once , I see that . There ’s the chance of an action for breach , that ’s another . There ’s the chance of -- no , there ’s no chance of that , but it ’s as well to be on the safe side . ’

The several duties of instruction in this establishment were thus discharged . English grammar , composition , geography , and the use of the dumb - bells , by Miss Melissa Wackles ; writing , arithmetic , dancing , music , and general fascination , by Miss Sophia Wackles ; the art of needle - work , marking , and samplery , by Miss Jane Wackles ; corporal punishment , fasting , and other tortures and terrors , by Mrs Wackles . Miss Melissa Wackles was the eldest daughter , Miss Sophy the next , and Miss Jane the youngest . Miss Melissa might have seen five - and - thirty summers or thereabouts , and verged on the autumnal ; Miss Sophy was a fresh , good humoured , buxom girl of twenty ; and Miss Jane numbered scarcely sixteen years .

It ’s all your fault , you naughty thing . ’

29958	29961	29955	29956	Miss Sophy	106	‘ Nonsense ! ’
29966	30022	29955	29956	Miss Sophy	106	‘ Why should n’t Mr Cheggs be jealous if he likes ? I like that , certainly . Mr Cheggs has a good a right to be jealous as anyone else has , and perhaps he may have a better right soon if he has n’t already . You know best about that , Sophy ! ’
30110	30119	30121	30122	Mr Cheggs	111	‘ Did you speak to me , sir ? ’
30130	30155	30121	30122	Mr Cheggs	111	‘ Have the kindness to smile , sir , in order that we may not be suspected . Did you speak to me , sir ’
30246	30255	30242	30242	he	116	‘ No , sir , I did n’t . ’

At these words Richard Swiviller withdrew his eyes from Mr Chegg ’s face , and travelling down the middle of his nose and down his waistcoat and down his right leg , reached his toes again , and carefully surveyed him ; this done , he crossed over , and coming up the other leg , and thence approaching by the waistcoat as before , said when had got to his eyes , ‘

31505	31506	31494	31494	I	0	’ ‘
31509	32961	31494	31494	I	0	’ came almost as soon as it was courted . In a very few minutes Mr Swiviller was fast asleep , dreaming that he had married Nelly Trent and come into the property , and that his first act of power was to lay waste the market - garden of Mr Cheggs and turn it into a brick - field . CHAPTER 9 The child , in her confidence with Mrs Quilp , had but feebly described the sadness and sorrow of her thoughts , or the heaviness of the cloud which overhung her home , and cast dark shadows on its hearth . Besides that it was very difficult to impart to any person not intimately acquainted with the life she led , an adequate sense of its gloom and loneliness , a constant fear of in some way committing or injuring the old man to whom she was so tenderly attached , had restrained her , even in the midst of her heart ’s overflowing , and made her timid of allusion to the main cause of her anxiety and distress . For , it was not the monotonous days unchequered by variety and uncheered by pleasant companionship , it was not the dark dreary evenings or the long solitary nights , it was not the absence of every slight and easy pleasure for which young hearts beat high , or the knowing nothing of childhood but its weakness and its easily wounded spirit , that had wrung such tears from Nell . To see the old man struck down beneath the pressure of some hidden grief , to mark his wavering and unsettled state , to be agitated at times with a dreadful fear that his mind was wandering , and to trace in his words and looks the dawning of despondent madness ; to watch and wait and listen for confirmation of these things day after day , and to feel and know that , come what might , they were alone in the world with no one to help or advise or care about them -- these were causes of depression and anxiety that might have sat heavily on an older breast with many influences at work to cheer and gladden it , but how heavily on the mind of a young child to whom they were ever present , and who was constantly surrounded by all that could keep such thoughts in restless action ! And yet , to the old man ’s vision , Nell was still the same . When he could , for a moment , disengage his mind from the phantom that haunted and brooded on it always , there was his young companion with the same smile for him , the same earnest words , the same merry laugh , the same love and care that , sinking deep into his soul , seemed to have been present to him through his whole life . And so he went on , content to read the book of her heart from the page first presented to him , little dreaming of the story that lay hidden in its other leaves , and murmuring within himself that at least the child was happy . She had been once . She had gone singing through the dim rooms , and moving with gay and lightsome step among their dusty treasures , making them older by her young life , and sterner and more grim by her gay and cheerful presence . But , now , the chambers were cold and gloomy , and when she left her own little room to while away the tedious hours , and sat in one of them , she was still and motionless as their inanimate occupants , and had no heart to startle the echoes -- hoarse from their long silence -- with her voice . In one of these rooms , was a window looking into the street , where the child sat , many and many a long evening , and often far into the night , alone and thoughtful . None are so anxious as those who watch and wait ; at these times , mournful fancies came flocking on her mind , in crowds . She would take her station here , at dusk , and watch the people as they passed up and down the street , or appeared at the windows of the opposite houses ; wondering whether those rooms were as lonesome as that in which she sat , and whether those people felt it company to see her sitting there , as she did only to see them look out and draw in their heads again . There was a crooked stack of chimneys on one of the roofs , in which , by often looking at them , she had fancied ugly faces that were frowning over at her and trying to peer into the room ; and she felt glad when it grew too dark to make them out , though she was sorry too , when the man came to light the lamps in the street -- for it made it late , and very dull inside . Then , she would draw in her head to look round the room and see that everything was in its place and had n’t moved ; and looking out into the street again , would perhaps see a man passing with a coffin on his back , and two or three others silently following him to a house where somebody lay dead ; which made her shudder and think of such things until they suggested afresh the old man ’s altered face and manner , and a new train of fears and speculations . If he were to die -- if sudden illness had happened to him , and he were never to come home again , alive -- if , one night , he should come home , and kiss and bless her as usual , and after she had gone to bed and had fallen asleep and was perhaps dreaming pleasantly , and smiling in her sleep , he should kill himself and his blood come creeping , creeping , on the ground to her own bed - room door ! These thoughts were too terrible to dwell upon , and again she would have recourse to the street , now trodden by fewer feet , and darker and more silent than before . The shops were closing fast , and lights began to shine from the upper windows , as the neighbours went to bed . By degrees , these dwindled away and disappeared or were replaced , here and there , by a feeble rush - candle which was to burn all night . Still , there was one late shop at no great distance which sent forth a ruddy glare upon the pavement even yet , and looked bright and companionable . But , in a little time , this closed , the light was extinguished , and all was gloomy and quiet , except when some stray footsteps sounded on the pavement , or a neighbour , out later than his wo nt , knocked lustily at his house - door to rouse the sleeping inmates . When the night had worn away thus far ( and seldom now until it had ) the child would close the window , and steal softly down stairs , thinking as she went that if one of those hideous faces below , which often mingled with her dreams , were to meet her by the way , rendering itself visible by some strange light of its own , how terrified she would be . But these fears vanished before a well - trimmed lamp and the familiar aspect of her own room . After praying fervently , and with many bursting tears , for the old man , and the restoration of his peace of mind and the happiness they had once enjoyed , she would lay her head upon the pillow and sob herself to sleep : often starting up again , before the day - light came , to listen for the bell and respond to the imaginary summons which had roused her from her slumber . One night , the third after Nelly ’s interview with Mrs Quilp , the old man , who had been weak and ill all day , said he should not leave home . The child ’s eyes sparkled at the intelligence , but her joy subsided when they reverted to his worn and sickly face . ‘
32965	32969	32987	32987	he	935	’ he said , ‘

33117	33214	33037	33037	he	935	’ Twould be of no use , my dear , no earthly use . But if he deserts me , Nell , at this moment -- if he deserts me now , when I should , with his assistance , be recompensed for all the time and money I have lost , and all the agony of mind I have undergone , which makes me what you see , I am ruined , and -- worse , far worse than that -- have ruined thee , for whom I ventured all . If we are beggars-- ! ’
33215	33221	33223	33224	the child	324	‘ What if we are ? ’
33227	33237	33223	33224	the child	324	‘ Let us be beggars , and be happy . ’
33238	33244	33246	33248	the old man	384	‘ Beggars -- and happy ! ’
33250	33254	33246	33248	the old man	384	‘ Poor child ! ’

33280	33328	33269	33269	her	575	‘ I am not a child in that I think , but even if I am , oh hear me pray that we may beg , or work in open roads or fields , to earn a scanty living , rather than live as we do now . ’
33329	33332	33334	33336	the old man	384	‘ Nelly ! ’
33338	33351	33352	33353	the child	324	‘ Yes , yes , rather than live as we do now , ’
33361	33467	33352	33353	the child	324	‘ If you are sorrowful , let me know why and be sorrowful too ; if you waste away and are paler and weaker every day , let me be your nurse and try to comfort you . If you are poor , let us be poor together ; but let me be with you , do let me be with you ; do not let me see such change and not know why , or I shall break my heart and die . Dear grandfather , let us leave this sad place to - morrow , and beg our way from door to door . ’
33492	33498	33500	33501	the child	324	‘ Let us be beggars , ’
33509	33634	33500	33501	the child	324	‘ I have no fear but we shall have enough , I am sure we shall . Let us walk through country places , and sleep in fields and under trees , and never think of money again , or anything that can make you sad , but rest at nights , and have the sun and wind upon our faces in the day , and thank God together ! Let us never set foot in dark rooms or melancholy houses , any more , but wander up and down wherever we like to go ; and when you are tired , you shall stop to rest in the pleasantest place that we can find , and I will go and beg for both . ’

34101	34110	34075	34076	little Nelly	97	’ said the dwarf , smacking his lips , ‘
34129	34170	34181	34181	neighbour	530	’ Nell was none the slower in going away , for this remark . Quilp looked after her with an admiring leer , and when she had closed the door , fell to complimenting the old man upon her charms . ‘
34183	34200	34181	34181	neighbour	530	’ said Quilp , nursing his short leg , and making his eyes twinkle very much ; ‘
34212	34259	34260	34260	She	968	’ The old man answered by a forced smile , and was plainly struggling with a feeling of the keenest and most exquisite impatience . It was not lost upon Quilp , who delighted in torturing him , or indeed anybody else , when he could . ‘
34264	34282	34260	34260	She	968	’ said Quilp , speaking very slowly , and feigning to be quite absorbed in the subject , ‘
34321	34337	34339	34340	the dwarf	6020	’re nervous ! Why neighbour , what ’s the matter ? I swear to you , ’
34370	34423	34339	34340	the dwarf	6020	‘ I swear to you that I had no idea old blood ran so fast or kept so warm . I thought it was sluggish in its course , and cool , quite cool . I am pretty sure it ought to be . Yours must be out of order , neighbour . ’
34424	34430	34432	34434	the old man	384	‘ I believe it is , ’
34443	34464	34432	34434	the old man	384	‘ There ’s burning fever here , and something now and then to which I fear to give a name . ’
34516	34531	34494	34494	he	6020	‘ Once , and once for all , have you brought me any money ? ’
34532	34535	34537	34537	Quilp	84	‘ No ! ’
34539	34542	34544	34546	the old man	384	‘ Then , ’
34557	34565	34544	34546	the old man	384	‘ the child and I are lost ! ’
34566	34569	34571	34571	Quilp	84	‘ Neighbour , ’
34593	34632	34571	34571	Quilp	84	‘ let me be plain with you , and play a fairer game than when you held all the cards , and I saw but the backs and nothing more . You have no secret from me now . ’
34641	34646	34648	34648	Quilp	84	‘ You are surprised , ’
34650	34715	34648	34648	Quilp	84	‘ Well , perhaps that ’s natural . You have no secret from me now , I say ; no , not one . For now , I know , that all those sums of money , that all those loans , advances , and supplies that you have had from me , have found their way to -- shall I say the word ? ’
34716	34719	34721	34723	the old man	384	‘ Aye ! ’
34725	34733	34721	34723	the old man	384	‘ say it , if you will . ’
34734	34741	34743	34743	Quilp	84	‘ To the gaming - table , ’
34745	34807	34743	34743	Quilp	84	‘ your nightly haunt . This was the precious scheme to make your fortune , was it ; this was the secret certain source of wealth in which I was to have sunk my money ( if I had been the fool you took me for ) ; this was your inexhaustible mine of gold , your El Dorado , eh ? ’
34808	34811	34813	34815	the old man	384	‘ Yes , ’
34824	34839	34813	34815	the old man	384	‘ it was . It is . It will be , till I die . ’
34840	34848	34850	34850	Quilp	84	‘ That I should have been blinded , ’
34856	34863	34850	34850	Quilp	84	‘ by a mere shallow gambler ! ’
34864	34870	34872	34874	the old man	384	‘ I am no gambler , ’
34877	35033	34872	34874	the old man	384	‘ I call Heaven to witness that I never played for gain of mine , or love of play ; that at every piece I staked , I whispered to myself that orphan ’s name and called on Heaven to bless the venture;--which it never did . Whom did it prosper ? Who were those with whom I played ? Men who lived by plunder , profligacy , and riot ; squandering their gold in doing ill , and propagating vice and evil . My winnings would have been from them , my winnings would have been bestowed to the last farthing on a young sinless child whose life they would have sweetened and made happy . What would they have contracted ? The means of corruption , wretchedness , and misery . Who would not have hoped in such a cause ? Tell me that ! Who would not have hoped as I did ? ’
35034	35044	35046	35046	Quilp	84	‘ When did you first begin this mad career ? ’
35066	35073	35074	35074	he	84	‘ When did I first begin ? ’
35084	35174	35074	35074	he	84	‘ When was it , that I first began ? When should it be , but when I began to think how little I had saved , how long a time it took to save at all , how short a time I might have at my age to live , and how she would be left to the rough mercies of the world , with barely enough to keep her from the sorrows that wait on poverty ; then it was that I began to think about it . ’
35175	35192	35194	35194	Quilp	84	‘ After you first came to me to get your precious grandson packed off to sea ? ’
35196	35201	35203	35205	the old man	384	‘ Shortly after that , ’
35207	35269	35203	35205	the old man	384	‘ I thought of it a long time , and had it in my sleep for months . Then I began . I found no pleasure in it , I expected none . What has it ever brought me but anxious days and sleepless nights ; but loss of health and peace of mind , and gain of feebleness and sorrow ! ’
35270	35345	35347	35347	Quilp	84	‘ You lost what money you had laid by , first , and then came to me . While I thought you were making your fortune ( as you said you were ) you were making yourself a beggar , eh ? Dear me ! And so it comes to pass that I hold every security you could scrape together , and a bill of sale upon the -- upon the stock and property , ’
35369	35376	35203	35205	the old man	384	‘ But did you never win ? ’
35377	35380	35382	35384	the old man	384	‘ Never ! ’
35386	35393	35382	35384	the old man	384	‘ Never won back my loss ! ’
35394	35398	35400	35401	the dwarf	6020	‘ I thought , ’
35403	35432	35400	35401	the dwarf	6020	‘ that if a man played long enough he was sure to win at last , or , at the worst , not to come off a loser . ’
35433	35439	35441	35443	the old man	384	‘ And so he is , ’
35462	35560	35561	35562	The dwarf	6020	‘ so he is ; I have felt that from the first , I have always known it , I ’ve seen it , I never felt it half so strongly as I feel it now . Quilp , I have dreamed , three nights , of winning the same large sum , I never could dream that dream before , though I have often tried . Do not desert me , now I have this chance . I have no resource but you , give me some help , let me try this one last hope . ’
35571	35582	35584	35586	the old man	384	‘ See , Quilp , good tender - hearted Quilp , ’
35608	35655	35584	35586	the old man	384	‘ only see here . Look at these figures , the result of long calculation , and painful and hard experience . I MUST win . I only want a little help once more , a few pounds , but two score pounds , dear Quilp . ’
35656	35663	35665	35666	the dwarf	6020	‘ The last advance was seventy , ’
35668	35676	35665	35666	the dwarf	6020	‘ and it went in one night . ’
35677	35683	35685	35687	the old man	384	‘ I know it did , ’
35689	35714	35715	35717	the old man	384	‘ but that was the very worst fortune of all , and the time had not come then . Quilp , consider , consider , ’
35742	35828	35715	35717	the old man	384	‘ that orphan child ! If I were alone , I could die with gladness -- perhaps even anticipate that doom which is dealt out so unequally : coming , as it does , on the proud and happy in their strength , and shunning the needy and afflicted , and all who court it in their despair -- but what I have done , has been for her . Help me for her sake I implore you ; not for mine ; for hers ! ’
35829	35831	35886	35887	good Quilp	84	‘ I ’m
35842	35856	35833	35833	I	0	’ said Quilp , looking at his watch with perfect self - possession , ‘
35880	35881	35858	35858	I	0	’ ‘
35889	35900	35886	35887	good Quilp	84	’ gasped the old man , catching at his skirts , ‘
35967	35968	35969	35969	I	0	’ ‘
35976	35983	35969	35969	I	0	’ said Quilp with unusual politeness , ‘
36028	36029	36027	36027	Nelly--	122	’ ‘
36046	36052	36027	36027	Nelly--	122	’ cried the old man . ‘
36062	36066	36057	36057	I	0	’ said Quilp ; ‘
36153	36154	36140	36140	I	0	’ ‘
36159	36166	36140	36140	I	0	’ retorted the old man desperately , ‘
36188	36238	36185	36186	the person	633	’ The crafty dwarf , bethinking himself that his giving up the child would lead to the disclosure of the artifice he had employed , which , as nothing was to be gained by it , it was well to conceal , stopped short in his answer and said , ‘
36246	36247	36243	36243	you	991	’ ‘
36270	36276	36259	36259	he	423	’ said the old man . ‘
36285	36296	36301	36301	Kit	75	’ said the dwarf in a tone of great commiseration . ‘
36306	36340	36341	36342	Poor Kit	75	’ So saying , he nodded in a friendly manner , and took his leave : stopping when he had passed the outer door a little distance , and grinning with extraordinary delight . ‘
36344	36348	36341	36342	Poor Kit	75	’ muttered Quilp . ‘
36381	36883	36378	36379	Poor Kit	75	’ And with that he went his way , still chuckling as he went . CHAPTER 10 Daniel Quilp neither entered nor left the old man ’s house , unobserved . In the shadow of an archway nearly opposite , leading to one of the many passages which diverged from the main street , there lingered one , who , having taken up his position when the twilight first came on , still maintained it with undiminished patience , and leaning against the wall with the manner of a person who had a long time to wait , and being well used to it was quite resigned , scarcely changed his attitude for the hour together . This patient lounger attracted little attention from any of those who passed , and bestowed as little upon them . His eyes were constantly directed towards one object ; the window at which the child was accustomed to sit . If he withdrew them for a moment , it was only to glance at a clock in some neighbouring shop , and then to strain his sight once more in the old quarter with increased earnestness and attention . It had been remarked that this personage evinced no weariness in his place of concealment ; nor did he , long as his waiting was . But as the time went on , he manifested some anxiety and surprise , glancing at the clock more frequently and at the window less hopefully than before . At length , the clock was hidden from his sight by some envious shutters , then the church steeples proclaimed eleven at night , then the quarter past , and then the conviction seemed to obtrude itself on his mind that it was no use tarrying there any longer . That the conviction was an unwelcome one , and that he was by no means willing to yield to it , was apparent from his reluctance to quit the spot ; from the tardy steps with which he often left it , still looking over his shoulder at the same window ; and from the precipitation with which he as often returned , when a fancied noise or the changing and imperfect light induced him to suppose it had been softly raised . At length , he gave the matter up , as hopeless for that night , and suddenly breaking into a run as though to force himself away , scampered off at his utmost speed , nor once ventured to look behind him lest he should be tempted back again . Without relaxing his pace , or stopping to take breath , this mysterious individual dashed on through a great many alleys and narrow ways until he at length arrived in a square paved court , when he subsided into a walk , and making for a small house from the window of which a light was shining , lifted the latch of the door and passed in . ‘
36887	36895	36378	36379	Poor Kit	75	’ cried a woman turning sharply round , ‘
36908	36909	36904	36904	you	1000	’ ‘
36918	36919	36916	36916	me	0	’ ‘
36930	36931	36924	36924	you	1000	’ ‘
36941	36945	36948	36948	she	1003	’ said Kit ; ‘
36958	37321	36948	36948	she	1003	’ With which words , he sat down by the fire and looked very mournful and discontented . The room in which Kit sat himself down , in this condition , was an extremely poor and homely place , but with that air of comfort about it , nevertheless , which -- or the spot must be a wretched one indeed -- cleanliness and order can always impart in some degree . Late as the Dutch clock showed it to be , the poor woman was still hard at work at an ironing - table ; a young child lay sleeping in a cradle near the fire ; and another , a sturdy boy of two or three years old , very wide awake , with a very tight night - cap on his head , and a night - gown very much too small for him on his body , was sitting bolt upright in a clothes - basket , staring over the rim with his great round eyes , and looking as if he had thoroughly made up his mind never to go to sleep any more ; which , as he had already declined to take his natural rest and had been brought out of bed in consequence , opened a cheerful prospect for his relations and friends . It was rather a queer - looking family : Kit , his mother , and the children , being all strongly alike . Kit was disposed to be out of temper , as the best of us are too often -- but he looked at the youngest child who was sleeping soundly , and from him to his other brother in the clothes - basket , and from him to their mother , who had been at work without complaint since morning , and thought it would be a better and kinder thing to be good - humoured . So he rocked the cradle with his foot ; made a face at the rebel in the clothes - basket , which put him in high good - humour directly ; and stoutly determined to be talkative and make himself agreeable . ‘
37326	37358	37324	37324	mother	6118	’ said Kit , taking out his clasp - knife , and falling upon a great piece of bread and meat which she had had ready for him , hours before , ‘
37375	37376	37377	37377	I	0	’ ‘
37389	37394	37387	37387	Kit	75	’ said Mrs Nubbles ; ‘
37406	37415	37387	37387	Kit	75	’ to what the parson at chapel says . ’
37416	37423	37425	37425	Kit	75	‘ Much he knows about it , ’
37428	37479	37425	37425	Kit	75	‘ Wait till he ’s a widder and works like you do , and gets as little , and does as much , and keeps his spirit up the same , and then I ’ll ask him what ’s o’clock and trust him for being right to half a second . ’
37480	37483	37485	37486	Mrs Nubbles	123	‘ Well , ’
37492	37504	37485	37486	Mrs Nubbles	123	‘ your beer ’s down there by the fender , Kit . ’
37505	37509	37511	37512	her son	1006	‘ I see , ’
37520	37549	37511	37512	her son	1006	‘ my love to you , mother . And the parson ’s health too if you like . I do n’t bear him any malice , not I ! ’
37550	37570	37572	37573	Mrs Nubbles	123	‘ Did you tell me , just now , that your master had n’t gone out to - night ? ’
37575	37578	37580	37580	Kit	75	‘ Yes , ’
37582	37586	37580	37580	Kit	75	‘ worse luck ! ’
37587	37597	37599	37600	his mother	479	‘ You should say better luck , I think , ’
37602	37613	37599	37600	his mother	479	‘ because Miss Nelly wo n’t have been left alone . ’
37614	37617	37619	37619	Kit	75	‘ Ah ! ’
37621	37647	37619	37619	Kit	75	‘ I forgot that . I said worse luck , because I ’ve been watching ever since eight o’clock , and seen nothing of her . ’
37648	37656	37663	37663	her	479	‘ I wonder what she ’d say , ’
37669	37721	37663	37663	her	479	‘ if she knew that every night , when she -- poor thing -- is sitting alone at that window , you are watching in the open street for fear any harm should come to her , and that you never leave the place or come home to your bed though you ’re
37738	37739	37658	37659	his mother	479	’ ‘
37747	37761	37743	37743	she	479	’ replied Kit , with something like a blush on his uncouth face ; ‘
37777	37858	37859	37859	I	0	’ Mrs Nubbles ironed away in silence for a minute or two , and coming to the fireplace for another iron , glanced stealthily at Kit while she rubbed it on a board and dusted it with a duster , but said nothing until she had returned to her table again : when , holding the iron at an alarmingly short distance from her cheek , to test its temperature , and looking round with a smile , she observed : ‘
37868	37869	37867	37867	Kit--	124	’ ‘
37872	37885	37889	37889	they	6147	’ interposed Kit with a perfect apprehension of what was to follow . ‘
37911	37923	37893	37894	Some people	6147	’ To this , Kit only replied by bashfully bidding his mother ‘
37927	37994	37893	37894	Some people	6147	’ and forming sundry strange figures with his legs and arms , accompanied by sympathetic contortions of his face . Not deriving from these means the relief which he sought , he bit off an immense mouthful from the bread and meat , and took a quick drink of the porter ; by which artificial aids he choked himself and effected a diversion of the subject . ‘
38001	38016	37999	37999	Kit	75	’ said his mother , taking up the theme afresh , after a time , ‘
38064	38108	37999	37999	Kit	75	’m sure she would be very grateful to you and feel it very much . It ’s a cruel thing to keep the dear child shut up there . I do n’t wonder that the old gentleman wants to keep it from you . ’
38109	38121	38123	38123	Kit	75	‘ He do n’t think it ’s cruel , bless you , ’
38125	38180	38123	38123	Kit	75	‘ and do n’t mean it to be so , or he would n’t do it -- I do consider , mother , that he would n’t do it for all the gold and silver in the world . No , no , that he would n’t . I know him better than that . ’
38181	38201	38203	38204	Mrs Nubbles	123	‘ Then what does he do it for , and why does he keep it so close from you ? ’
38206	38213	38215	38216	her son	1006	‘ That I do n’t know , ’
38218	38278	38203	38204	Mrs Nubbles	123	‘ If he had n’t tried to keep it so close though , I should never have found it out , for it was his getting me away at night and sending me off so much earlier than he used to , that first made me curious to know what was going on . Hark ! what ’s that ? ’
38279	38286	38123	38123	Kit	75	‘ It ’s only somebody outside . ’
38287	38295	38297	38297	Kit	75	‘ It ’s somebody crossing over here , ’
38304	38329	38297	38297	Kit	75	‘ and coming very fast too . He ca n’t have gone out after I left , and the house caught fire , mother ! ’
38392	38401	38403	38403	mother	6118	‘ Miss Nelly ! What is the matter ! ’
38408	38416	38417	38417	she	324	‘ I must not stay a moment , ’
38420	38437	38417	38417	she	324	‘ grandfather has been taken very ill . I found him in a fit upon the floor-- ’
38438	38452	38453	38453	I	0	‘ I ’ll run for a doctor’--said Kit , seizing his brimless hat . ‘
38460	38461	38459	38459	I’ll--	0	’ ‘
38466	38470	38476	38476	you	423	’ cried Nell , ‘
38477	38493	38476	38476	you	423	’re not wanted , you -- you -- must never come near us any more ! ’
38494	38497	38499	38499	Kit	75	‘ What ! ’
38501	38505	38507	38508	the child	324	‘ Never again , ’
38510	38553	38507	38508	the child	324	‘ Do n’t ask me why , for I do n’t know . Pray do n’t ask me why , pray do n’t be sorry , pray do n’t be vexed with me ! I have nothing to do with it indeed ! ’
38583	38591	38593	38594	the child	324	‘ He complains and raves of you , ’
38596	38615	38593	38594	the child	324	‘ I do n’t know what you have done , but I hope it ’s nothing very bad . ’
38616	38620	38622	38622	Kit	75	‘ I done ! ’
38624	38629	38622	38622	Kit	75	‘ He cried that you ’re
38637	38645	38646	38646	he	75	’ returned the child with tearful eyes ; ‘
38724	38752	38753	38753	I	0	’ The unfortunate Kit looked at his young mistress harder and harder , and with eyes growing wider and wider , but was perfectly motionless and silent . ‘
38762	38840	38846	38846	her	1023	’ said the child , looking to the woman and laying it on the table--‘and -- and -- a little more , for he was always good and kind to me . I hope he will be sorry and do well somewhere else and not take this to heart too much . It grieves me very much to part with him like this , but there is no help . It must be done . Good night ! ’
39961	39968	39970	39970	Quilp	84	‘ Smoke away , you dog , ’
39977	40016	39970	39970	Quilp	84	‘ fill your pipe again and smoke it fast , down to the last whiff , or I ’ll put the sealing - waxed end of it in the fire and rub it red hot upon your tongue . ’
40061	40084	40086	40086	Quilp	84	‘ Is it good , Brass , is it nice , is it fragrant , do you feel like the Grand Turk ? ’
40128	40138	40140	40140	Quilp	84	‘ This is the way to keep off fever , ’

40209	40226	40228	40228	Quilp	84	‘ We must stop , I suppose , till the old gentleman up stairs is dead , ’
40230	40235	40228	40228	Quilp	84	‘ He he he ! ’
40240	40246	40237	40238	Mr Brass	127	‘ oh ! very good ! ’
40247	40251	40253	40253	Quilp	84	‘ Smoke away ! ’
40255	40271	40253	40253	Quilp	84	‘ Never stop ! You can talk as you smoke . Do n’t lose time . ’

40292	40303	40283	40283	he	127	‘ But if he should get better , Mr Quilp ? ’
40304	40317	40319	40320	the dwarf	6020	‘ Then we shall stop till he does , and no longer , ’
40322	40337	40339	40339	Brass	127	‘ How kind it is of you , Sir , to wait till then ! ’
40341	40364	40365	40365	em	1076	‘ Some people , Sir , would have sold or removed the goods -- oh dear , the very instant the law allowed ‘

40414	40418	40412	40412	he	1082	’ cried Brass . ‘
40424	40447	40419	40419	You	6020	’ The smoking sentinel at the door interposed in this place , and without taking his pipe from his lips , growled , ‘
40454	40457	40419	40419	You	6020	’ down . ’
40458	40465	40467	40467	Quilp	84	‘ The what , you dog ? ’
40469	40473	40475	40476	the boy	423	‘ The gal , ’
40478	40483	40475	40476	the boy	423	‘ Are you deaf ? ’
40484	40487	40489	40489	Quilp	84	‘ Oh ! ’
40505	40547	40500	40500	he	84	‘ you and I will have such a settling presently ; there ’s such a scratching and bruising in store for you , my dear young friend ! Aha ! Nelly ! How is he now , my duck of diamonds ? ’
40548	40554	40556	40558	the weeping child	1085	‘ He ’s very bad , ’
40560	40567	40569	40569	Quilp	84	‘ What a pretty little Nell ! ’
40571	40580	40582	40582	Brass	127	‘ Oh beautiful , sir , beautiful indeed , ’
40584	40588	40582	40582	Brass	127	‘ Quite charming . ’
40589	40600	40602	40603	the dwarf	6020	‘ Has she come to sit upon Quilp ’s knee , ’
40615	40638	40602	40603	the dwarf	6020	‘ or is she going to bed in her own little room inside here ? Which is poor Nelly going to do ? ’
40639	40650	40652	40652	Brass	127	‘ What a remarkable pleasant way he has with children ! ’
40664	40677	40652	40652	Brass	127	‘ upon my word it ’s quite a treat to hear him . ’
40678	40680	40602	40603	the dwarf	6020	‘ I ’m
40688	40692	40693	40693	I	0	’ faltered Nell . ‘
40716	40717	40707	40707	I	0	’ ‘
40727	40739	40741	40742	a bower	1090	’ said the dwarf looking into it as the child entered . ‘
40745	40748	40799	40799	She	72	’re sure you ’re
40756	40759	40744	40744	You	0	’re sure you ’re

40770	40790	40764	40764	Nelly	72	’ replied the child , hurrying away , with the few articles of dress she had come to remove ; ‘
40797	40798	40799	40799	She	72	’ ‘
40804	40812	40799	40799	She	72	’ said Quilp , looking after her . ‘
40839	41358	40831	40831	I	0	’ Mr Brass encouraging this idea , as he would have encouraged any other emanating from the same source , the dwarf walked in to try the effect . This he did , by throwing himself on his back upon the bed with his pipe in his mouth , and then kicking up his legs and smoking violently . Mr Brass applauding this picture very much , and the bed being soft and comfortable , Mr Quilp determined to use it , both as a sleeping place by night and as a kind of Divan by day ; and in order that it might be converted to the latter purpose at once , remained where he was , and smoked his pipe out . The legal gentleman being by this time rather giddy and perplexed in his ideas ( for this was one of the operations of the tobacco on his nervous system ) , took the opportunity of slinking away into the open air , where , in course of time , he recovered sufficiently to return with a countenance of tolerable composure . He was soon led on by the malicious dwarf to smoke himself into a relapse , and in that state stumbled upon a settee where he slept till morning . Such were Mr Quilp ’s first proceedings on entering upon his new property . He was , for some days , restrained by business from performing any particular pranks , as his time was pretty well occupied between taking , with the assistance of Mr Brass , a minute inventory of all the goods in the place , and going abroad upon his other concerns which happily engaged him for several hours at a time . His avarice and caution being , now , thoroughly awakened , however , he was never absent from the house one night ; and his eagerness for some termination , good or bad , to the old man ’s disorder , increasing rapidly , as the time passed by , soon began to vent itself in open murmurs and exclamations of impatience . Nell shrank timidly from all the dwarf ’s advances towards conversation , and fled from the very sound of his voice ; nor were the lawyer ’s smiles less terrible to her than Quilp ’s grimaces . She lived in such continual dread and apprehension of meeting one or other of them on the stairs or in the passages if she stirred from her grandfather ’s chamber , that she seldom left it , for a moment , until late at night , when the silence encouraged her to venture forth and breathe the purer air of some empty room . One night , she had stolen to her usual window , and was sitting there very sorrowfully -- for the old man had been worse that day -- when she thought she heard her name pronounced by a voice in the street . Looking down , she recognised Kit , whose endeavours to attract her attention had roused her from her sad reflections . ‘
41362	41371	40831	40831	I	0	’ said the boy in a low voice . ‘
41374	41400	40831	40831	I	0	’ replied the child , doubtful whether she ought to hold any communication with the supposed culprit , but inclining to her old favourite still ; ‘
41406	41407	41403	41403	you	1093	’ ‘
41423	41428	41408	41408	I	0	’ the boy replied , ‘

41482	41487	41477	41477	I	0	’ returned the child . ‘

41506	41510	41511	41511	I	0	’ replied Kit . ‘
41512	41562	41491	41491	grandfather	382	’m sure I never deserved it from him , no , nor from you . I can say that , with a true and honest heart , any way . And then to be driven from the door , when I only came to ask how old master was-- ! ’
41563	41570	41572	41573	the child	324	‘ They never told me that , ’
41575	41595	41572	41573	the child	324	‘ I did n’t know it indeed . I would n’t have had them do it for the world . ’
41596	41601	41491	41491	grandfather	382	‘ Thank’ee , miss , ’
41605	41627	41491	41491	grandfather	382	‘ it ’s comfortable to hear you say that . I said I never would believe that it was your doing . ’
41628	41633	41635	41636	the child	324	‘ That was right ! ’
41639	41643	41645	41657	the boy coming under the window , and speaking in a lower tone	1099	‘ Miss Nell , ’
41659	41674	41645	41657	the boy coming under the window , and speaking in a lower tone	1099	‘ there are new masters down stairs . It ’s a change for you . ’
41675	41680	41682	41683	the child	324	‘ It is indeed , ’
41685	41698	41700	41701	the boy	423	‘ And so it will be for him when he gets better , ’
41709	41715	41717	41718	the child	324	‘ --If he ever does , ’
41726	41739	41741	41741	Kit	75	‘ Oh , he ’ll do that , he ’ll do that , ’
41743	41745	41747	41747	he	1104	‘ I ’m
41767	41797	41798	41798	He	1104	’ These words of encouragement and consolation were few and roughly said , but they affected the child and made her , for the moment , weep the more . ‘
41807	41813	41798	41798	He	1104	’ said the boy anxiously , ‘
41863	41864	41865	41865	They	1105	’ ‘
41884	41889	41890	41890	I	0	’ rejoined the child , ‘
41925	41926	41917	41917	We	1106	’ ‘
41937	41942	41944	41944	I	0	’ said the boy , ‘
41995	42013	42047	42047	he	1108	’ The child looked gratefully and kindly at him , but waited that he might speak again . ‘
42021	42026	42047	42047	he	1108	’ said Kit hesitating , ‘
42077	42108	42110	42110	he	1108	’ Here Kit faltered so long that the child entreated him to speak out , and quickly , for it was very late , and time to shut the window . ‘
42129	42136	42110	42110	he	1108	’ cried Kit with sudden boldness . ‘
42187	42221	42222	42222	You	1111	’ The child did not speak . Kit , in the relief of having made his proposition , found his tongue loosened , and spoke out in its favour with his utmost eloquence . ‘
42225	42230	42222	42222	You	1111	’ said the boy , ‘
42298	42309	42315	42316	Miss Nell	72	‘ em . They would n’t vex you much , I ’m
42396	42444	42395	42395	you	1111	’re not to think of that ! Will you try him , Miss Nell ? Only say you ’ll try him . Do try to make old master come , and ask him first what I have done . Will you only promise that , Miss Nell ? ’
42477	42482	42466	42466	his	127	‘ Who ’s there ! ’
43062	43066	43067	43067	he	384	‘ O yes , ’

43153	43156	43157	43157	he	384	‘ Yes , ’
43162	43182	43157	43157	he	384	‘ it was Quilp , he knew . Quilp was master there . Of course he might come in . ’

43202	43212	43200	43200	neighbour	530	’ said the dwarf , sitting down opposite him . ‘

43220	43223	43225	43227	the old man	384	‘ Yes , ’

43234	43248	43250	43251	the dwarf	6020	‘ I do n’t want to hurry you , you know , neighbour , ’
43270	43286	43254	43254	his	6020	‘ but , as soon as you can arrange your future proceedings , the better . ’
43287	43290	43292	43294	the old man	384	‘ Surely , ’
43296	43303	43292	43294	the old man	384	‘ The better for all parties . ’
43304	43308	43310	43310	Quilp	84	‘ You see , ’
43316	43333	43310	43310	Quilp	84	‘ the goods being once removed , this house would be uncomfortable ; uninhabitable in fact . ’
43334	43339	43341	43343	the old man	384	‘ You say true , ’
43345	43355	43341	43343	the old man	384	‘ Poor Nell too , what would she do ? ’
43356	43359	43361	43362	the dwarf	6020	‘ Exactly , ’
43367	43383	43364	43364	his	6020	‘ that ’s very well observed . Then will you consider about it , neighbour ? ’
43384	43390	43392	43394	the old man	384	‘ I will , certainly , ’
43396	43403	43392	43394	the old man	384	‘ We shall not stop here . ’
43404	43409	43411	43412	the dwarf	6020	‘ So I supposed , ’
43414	43464	43411	43412	the dwarf	6020	‘ I have sold the things . They have not yielded quite as much as they might have done , but pretty well -- pretty well . To - day ’s Tuesday . When shall they be moved ? There ’s no hurry -- shall we say this afternoon ? ’
43465	43470	43392	43394	the old man	384	‘ Say Friday morning , ’
43476	43480	43482	43483	the dwarf	6020	‘ Very good , ’
43485	43508	43482	43483	the dwarf	6020	‘ So be it -- with the understanding that I ca n’t go beyond that day , neighbour , on any account . ’
43509	43512	43514	43516	the old man	384	‘ Good , ’
43518	43524	43514	43516	the old man	384	‘ I shall remember it . ’

44158	44167	44150	44150	Nell	72	‘ Oh grandfather , what should I forgive ? ’
44168	44192	44194	44196	the old man	384	‘ All that is past , all that has come upon thee , Nell , all that was done in that uneasy dream , ’
44198	44204	44206	44207	the child	324	‘ Do not talk so , ’
44209	44221	44206	44207	the child	324	‘ Pray do not . Let us speak of something else . ’
44222	44230	44231	44231	he	384	‘ Yes , yes , we will , ’
44234	44265	44206	44207	the child	324	‘ And it shall be of what we talked of long ago -- many months -- months is it , or weeks , or days ? which is it Nell ? ’
44266	44273	44275	44276	the child	324	‘ I do not understand you , ’
44278	44309	44275	44276	the child	324	‘ It has come back upon me to - day , it has all come back since we have been sitting here . I bless thee for it , Nell ! ’
44310	44317	44206	44207	the child	324	‘ For what , dear grandfather ? ’
44318	44377	44206	44207	the child	324	‘ For what you said when we were first made beggars , Nell . Let us speak softly . Hush ! for if they knew our purpose down stairs , they would cry that I was mad and take thee from me . We will not stop here another day . We will go far away from here . ’
44378	44385	44387	44388	the child	324	‘ Yes , let us go , ’
44391	44422	44387	44388	the child	324	‘ Let us begone from this place , and never turn back or think of it again . Let us wander barefoot through the world , rather than linger here . ’
44423	44427	44429	44431	the old man	384	‘ We will , ’
44433	44530	44429	44431	the old man	384	‘ we will travel afoot through the fields and woods , and by the side of rivers , and trust ourselves to God in the places where He dwells . It is far better to lie down at night beneath an open sky like that yonder -- see how bright it is -- than to rest in close rooms which are always full of care and weary dreams . Thou and I together , Nell , may be cheerful and happy yet , and learn to forget this time , as if it had never been . ’
44531	44537	44539	44540	the child	324	‘ We will be happy , ’
44542	44549	44539	44540	the child	324	‘ We never can be here . ’
44550	44566	44568	44570	the old man	384	‘ No , we never can again -- never again -- that ’s truly said , ’
44572	44678	44568	44570	the old man	384	‘ Let us steal away to - morrow morning -- early and softly , that we may not be seen or heard -- and leave no trace or track for them to follow by . Poor Nell ! Thy cheek is pale , and thy eyes are heavy with watching and weeping for me -- I know -- for me ; but thou wilt be well again , and merry too , when we are far away . To - morrow morning , dear , we ’ll turn our faces from this scene of sorrow , and be as free and happy as the birds . ’
45804	45808	45810	45811	the child	324	‘ Which way ? ’
46456	46462	46451	46452	Mr Brass	127	‘ what ’s the matter ? ’
46463	46467	46469	46470	the dwarf	6020	‘ The key , ’
46477	46494	46469	46470	the dwarf	6020	‘ the door - key -- that ’s the matter . D’ye know anything of it ? ’
46495	46506	46508	46509	Mr Brass	127	‘ How should I know anything of it , sir ? ’
46511	46516	46518	46518	Quilp	84	‘ How should you ? ’
46523	46525	46518	46518	Quilp	84	‘ You ’re
46538	46995	46535	46535	you	84	’ Not caring to represent to the dwarf in his present humour , that the loss of a key by another person could scarcely be said to affect his ( Brass ’s ) legal knowledge in any material degree , Mr Brass humbly suggested that it must have been forgotten over night , and was , doubtless , at that moment in its native key - hole . Notwithstanding that Mr Quilp had a strong conviction to the contrary , founded on his recollection of having carefully taken it out , he was fain to admit that this was possible , and therefore went grumbling to the door where , sure enough , he found it . Now , just as Mr Quilp laid his hand upon the lock , and saw with great astonishment that the fastenings were undone , the knocking came again with the most irritating violence , and the daylight which had been shining through the key - hole was intercepted on the outside by a human eye . The dwarf was very much exasperated , and wanting somebody to wreak his ill - humour upon , determined to dart out suddenly , and favour Mrs Quilp with a gentle acknowledgment of her attention in making that hideous uproar . With this view , he drew back the lock very silently and softly , and opening the door all at once , pounced out upon the person on the other side , who had at that moment raised the knocker for another application , and at whom the dwarf ran head first : throwing out his hands and feet together , and biting the air in the fulness of his malice . So far , however , from rushing upon somebody who offered no resistance and implored his mercy , Mr Quilp was no sooner in the arms of the individual whom he had taken for his wife than he found himself complimented with two staggering blows on the head , and two more , of the same quality , in the chest ; and closing with his assailant , such a shower of buffets rained down upon his person as sufficed to convince him that he was in skilful and experienced hands . Nothing daunted by this reception , he clung tight to his opponent , and bit and hammered away with such good - will and heartiness , that it was at least a couple of minutes before he was dislodged . Then , and not until then , Daniel Quilp found himself , all flushed and dishevelled , in the middle of the street , with Mr Richard Swiveller performing a kind of dance round him and requiring to know ‘
47002	47003	46535	46535	you	84	’ ‘
47015	47030	47088	47088	you	0	’ said Mr Swiveller , by turns advancing and retreating in a threatening attitude , ‘

47076	47084	47088	47088	you	0	’ said Quilp , rubbing his shoulders , ‘

47131	47143	47125	47125	you	0	’ said the dwarf , getting up with a short groan , ‘

47180	47200	47170	47170	she	6082	’ As he said this , he pointed towards Mrs Quilp , who stood trembling at a little distance . ‘
47203	47216	47170	47170	she	6082	’ muttered the dwarf , darting an angry look at his wife , ‘

47255	47259	47244	47244	you	0	’ answered Dick , ‘

47309	47314	47304	47306	the old gentleman	808	’ rejoined Mr Swiveller , ‘
47334	47346	47380	47380	sir	5863	’m a friend of the family , sir -- at least I ’m
47362	47363	47333	47333	I	0	’ ‘
47371	47376	47364	47364	You	0	’ said the dwarf . ‘
47395	47521	47387	47388	Mrs Quilp	83	’ Mrs Quilp hesitated , but Mr Quilp insisted . And it was not a contest of politeness , or by any means a matter of form , for she knew very well that her husband wished to enter the house in this order , that he might have a favourable opportunity of inflicting a few pinches on her arms , which were seldom free from impressions of his fingers in black and blue colours . Mr Swiveller , who was not in the secret , was a little surprised to hear a suppressed scream , and , looking round , to see Mrs Quilp following him with a sudden jerk ; but he did not remark on these appearances , and soon forgot them . ‘
47527	47538	47524	47525	Mrs Quilp	83	’ said the dwarf when they had entered the shop , ‘
47561	47562	47555	47555	her	72	’ ‘
47572	47585	47563	47563	You	0	’ said Dick , who was unacquainted with Mr Quilp ’s authority . ‘
47594	47636	47591	47592	young gentleman	1271	’ returned the dwarf . Dick was pondering what these words might mean , and still more what the presence of Mr Brass might mean , when Mrs Quilp came hurrying down stairs , declaring that the rooms above were empty . ‘
47642	47647	47639	47640	you fool	1272	’ said the dwarf . ‘
47656	47662	47651	47651	my	0	’ answered his trembling wife , ‘
47681	47682	47664	47664	I	0	’ ‘
47686	47700	47664	47664	I	0	’ said Mr Brass , clapping his hands once , with an emphasis , ‘
47708	47757	47664	47664	I	0	’ Quilp looked frowningly at him , and frowningly at his wife , and frowningly at Richard Swiveller ; but , receiving no enlightenment from any of them , hurried up stairs , whence he soon hurried down again , confirming the report which had already been made . ‘
47766	47774	47817	47817	he	1275	’ he said , glancing at Swiveller , ‘
47831	47876	47829	47829	Nell	72	’ Mr Swiveller looked , as he was , all open - mouthed astonishment . Still glancing furtively at him , Quilp turned to Mr Brass and observed , with assumed carelessness , that this need not interfere with the removal of the goods . ‘
47880	47884	47829	47829	Nell	72	’ he added , ‘
47920	47921	47915	47915	they	1277	’ ‘
47932	47968	47924	47925	the devil	1278	’ said the wondering Dick . Quilp shook his head , and pursed up his lips , in a manner which implied that he knew very well , but was not at liberty to say . ‘
47972	47983	47986	47986	you	1279	’ said Dick , looking at the confusion about him , ‘
47993	47994	47986	47986	you	1279	’ ‘
47999	48004	48006	48006	Quilp	83	‘ em , Sir , ’
48008	48014	48006	48006	Quilp	83	‘ Eh ? What then ? ’
48015	48047	48049	48049	Dick	77	‘ Has the sly old fox made his fortune then , and gone to live in a tranquil cot in a pleasant spot with a distant view of the changing sea ? ’
48055	48082	48084	48085	the dwarf	6020	‘ Keeping his place of retirement very close , that he may not be visited too often by affectionate grandsons and their devoted friends , eh ? ’
48092	48103	48084	48085	the dwarf	6020	‘ I say nothing , but is that your meaning ? ’
48534	48537	48539	48539	Dick	77	‘ Well , ’
48546	48558	48539	48539	Dick	77	‘ I suppose it ’s of no use my staying here . ’
48559	48567	48569	48570	the dwarf	6020	‘ Not the least in the world , ’
48572	48582	48584	48584	Dick	77	‘ You ’ll mention that I called , perhaps ? ’
48604	48608	48610	48611	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ And say , ’
48613	48678	48610	48611	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ say , sir , that I was wafted here upon the pinions of concord ; that I came to remove , with the rake of friendship , the seeds of mutual violence and heart - burning , and to sow in their place , the germs of social harmony . Will you have the goodness to charge yourself with that commission , Sir ? ’
48679	48682	48684	48684	Quilp	84	‘ Certainly ! ’
48686	48699	48701	48701	Dick	77	‘ Will you be kind enough to add to it , Sir , ’
48710	48778	48701	48701	Dick	77	‘ that that is my address , and that I am to be found at home every morning . Two distinct knocks , sir , will produce the slavey at any time . My particular friends , Sir , are accustomed to sneeze when the door is opened , to give her to understand that they ARE my friends and have no interested motives in asking if I ’m
48798	48799	48788	48788	you	1295	’ ‘
48806	48810	48788	48788	you	1295	’ rejoined Quilp . ‘
48821	48831	48819	48819	sir	5863	’ said Dick , substituting another in its stead , ‘
48871	49197	48866	48866	Sir	5863	’ Quilp bade him good day ; the perpetual Grand Master of the Glorious Apollers , elevating his hat in honour of Mrs Quilp , dropped it carelessly on the side of his head again , and disappeared with a flourish . By this time , certain vans had arrived for the conveyance of the goods , and divers strong men in caps were balancing chests of drawers and other trifles of that nature upon their heads , and performing muscular feats which heightened their complexions considerably . Not to be behind - hand in the bustle , Mr Quilp went to work with surprising vigour ; hustling and driving the people about , like an evil spirit ; setting Mrs Quilp upon all kinds of arduous and impracticable tasks ; carrying great weights up and down , with no apparent effort ; kicking the boy from the wharf , whenever he could get near him ; and inflicting , with his loads , a great many sly bumps and blows on the shoulders of Mr Brass , as he stood upon the door - steps to answer all the inquiries of curious neighbours , which was his department . His presence and example diffused such alacrity among the persons employed , that , in a few hours , the house was emptied of everything , but pieces of matting , empty porter - pots , and scattered fragments of straw . Seated , like an African chief , on one of these pieces of matting , the dwarf was regaling himself in the parlour , with bread and cheese and beer , when he observed without appearing to do so , that a boy was prying in at the outer door . Assured that it was Kit , though he saw little more than his nose , Mr Quilp hailed him by his name ; whereupon Kit came in and demanded what he wanted . ‘
49204	49209	49201	49202	you sir	802	’ said the dwarf . ‘
49222	49223	49217	49218	young mistress	1303	’ ‘
49226	49233	49235	49235	you	1300	’ rejoined Kit , looking round . ‘
49245	49250	49235	49235	you	1300	’ answered Quilp sharply . ‘
49258	49259	49260	49260	I	0	’ ‘
49265	49269	49260	49260	I	0	’ said Kit . ‘
49272	49276	49286	49286	you	1300	’ retorted Quilp , ‘
49310	49311	49286	49286	you	1300	’ ‘
49314	49323	49286	49286	you	1300	’ said the boy , in evident surprise . ‘
49330	49334	49324	49324	You	1300	’ cried Quilp . ‘
49362	49363	49358	49358	you	1300	’ ‘
49366	49371	49358	49358	you	1300	’ replied the boy . ‘
49376	49380	49372	49372	You	1300	’ said Quilp . ‘
49393	49429	49389	49389	you	1300	’ Kit , who knew no particular reason why he should keep the matter secret now , related the purpose for which he had come on that occasion , and the proposal he had made . ‘
49432	49441	49389	49389	you	1300	’ said the dwarf after a little consideration . ‘
49453	49454	49458	49458	they	1304	’ ‘
49461	49466	49456	49456	you	0	’ cried Kit eagerly . ‘
49474	49479	49469	49469	I	0	’ returned the dwarf . ‘
49508	49518	49532	49532	I	0	‘ em a kindness , and I ca n’t do ‘
49535	49586	49532	49532	I	0	’ Kit might have returned some answer which would not have been agreeable to his irascible questioner , if the boy from the wharf , who had been skulking about the room in search of anything that might have been left about by accident , had not happened to cry , ‘
49600	49601	49665	49665	He	1308	’ ‘
49606	49610	49665	49665	He	1308	’ rejoined Quilp . ‘
49619	49626	49650	49650	You	1300	’ said Kit , stepping forward . ‘
49632	49633	49650	49650	You	1300	’ ‘
49641	49647	49637	49637	I	0	’ cried the other boy . ‘
49681	49682	49673	49673	You	1300	’ ‘
49695	49699	49692	49692	you	1300	’ roared Quilp . ‘
49715	49855	49859	49859	Kit	75	’ Without further persuasion , the two boys fell upon each other , tooth and nail , while Quilp , holding up the cage in one hand , and chopping the ground with his knife in an ecstasy , urged them on by his taunts and cries to fight more fiercely . They were a pretty equal match , and rolled about together , exchanging blows which were by no means child ’s play , until at length Kit , planting a well - directed hit in his adversary ’s chest , disengaged himself , sprung nimbly up , and snatching the cage from Quilp ’s hands made off with his prize . He did not stop once until he reached home , where his bleeding face occasioned great consternation , and caused the elder child to howl dreadfully . ‘
49872	49877	49882	49882	mother	6118	’ cried Mrs Nubbles . ‘
49884	49901	49882	49882	mother	6118	’ answered her son , wiping his face on the jack - towel behind the door . ‘
49903	49920	49882	49882	mother	6118	’m not hurt , do n’t you be afraid for me . I ’ve been a fightin ’
49951	49952	49942	49945	such a naughty boy	1311	’ ‘
49961	49966	49953	49953	You	75	’ exclaimed his mother . ‘
49970	49975	49977	49977	Kit	75	’ for a bird ! ’
49979	49996	49977	49977	Kit	75	‘ and here he is -- Miss Nelly ’s bird , mother , that they was agoin ’
50044	50164	50012	50012	They	1312	’ Kit laughing so heartily , with his swoln and bruised face looking out of the towel , made little Jacob laugh , and then his mother laughed , and then the baby crowed and kicked with great glee , and then they all laughed in concert : partly because of Kit ’s triumph , and partly because they were very fond of each other . When this fit was over , Kit exhibited the bird to both children , as a great and precious rarity -- it was only a poor linnet -- and looking about the wall for an old nail , made a scaffolding of a chair and table and twisted it out with great exultation . ‘
50169	50174	50166	50166	me	0	’ said the boy , ‘
50221	50297	50208	50208	He	135	’ So , the scaffolding was made again , and Kit , climbing up with the poker for a hammer , knocked in the nail and hung up the cage , to the immeasurable delight of the whole family . When it had been adjusted and straightened a great many times , and he had walked backwards into the fire - place in his admiration of it , the arrangement was pronounced to be perfect . ‘
50303	50308	50301	50301	mother	6118	’ said the boy , ‘
50351	50646	50332	50332	I	0	’ CHAPTER 14 As it was very easy for Kit to persuade himself that the old house was in his way , his way being anywhere , he tried to look upon his passing it once more as a matter of imperative and disagreeable necessity , quite apart from any desire of his own , to which he could not choose but yield . It is not uncommon for people who are much better fed and taught than Christopher Nubbles had ever been , to make duties of their inclinations in matters of more doubtful propriety , and to take great credit for the self - denial with which they gratify themselves . There was no need of any caution this time , and no fear of being detained by having to play out a return match with Daniel Quilp ’s boy . The place was entirely deserted , and looked as dusty and dingy as if it had been so for months . A rusty padlock was fastened on the door , ends of discoloured blinds and curtains flapped drearily against the half - opened upper windows , and the crooked holes cut in the closed shutters below , were black with the darkness of the inside . Some of the glass in the window he had so often watched , had been broken in the rough hurry of the morning , and that room looked more deserted and dull than any . A group of idle urchins had taken possession of the door - steps ; some were plying the knocker and listening with delighted dread to the hollow sounds it spread through the dismantled house ; others were clustered about the keyhole , watching half in jest and half in earnest for ‘
50650	51053	50332	50332	I	0	’ which an hour ’s gloom , added to the mystery that hung about the late inhabitants , had already raised . Standing all alone in the midst of the business and bustle of the street , the house looked a picture of cold desolation ; and Kit , who remembered the cheerful fire that used to burn there on a winter ’s night and the no less cheerful laugh that made the small room ring , turned quite mournfully away . It must be especially observed in justice to poor Kit that he was by no means of a sentimental turn , and perhaps had never heard that adjective in all his life . He was only a soft - hearted grateful fellow , and had nothing genteel or polite about him ; consequently , instead of going home again , in his grief , to kick the children and abuse his mother ( for , when your finely strung people are out of sorts , they must have everybody else unhappy likewise ) , he turned his thoughts to the vulgar expedient of making them more comfortable if he could . Bless us , what a number of gentlemen on horseback there were riding up and down , and how few of them wanted their horses held ! A good city speculator or a parliamentary commissioner could have told to a fraction , from the crowds that were cantering about , what sum of money was realised in London , in the course of a year , by holding horses alone . And undoubtedly it would have been a very large one , if only a twentieth part of the gentlemen without grooms had had occasion to alight ; but they had not ; and it is often an ill - natured circumstance like this , which spoils the most ingenious estimate in the world . Kit walked about , now with quick steps and now with slow ; now lingering as some rider slackened his horse ’s pace and looked about him ; and now darting at full speed up a bye - street as he caught a glimpse of some distant horseman going lazily up the shady side of the road , and promising to stop , at every door . But on they all went , one after another , and there was not a penny stirring . ‘
51057	51062	50332	50332	I	0	’ thought the boy , ‘
51102	51346	51347	51347	I	0	’ He was quite tired out with pacing the streets , to say nothing of repeated disappointments , and was sitting down upon a step to rest , when there approached towards him a little clattering jingling four - wheeled chaise , drawn by a little obstinate - looking rough - coated pony , and driven by a little fat placid - faced old gentleman . Beside the little old gentleman sat a little old lady , plump and placid like himself , and the pony was coming along at his own pace and doing exactly as he pleased with the whole concern . If the old gentleman remonstrated by shaking the reins , the pony replied by shaking his head . It was plain that the utmost the pony would consent to do , was to go in his own way up any street that the old gentleman particularly wished to traverse , but that it was an understanding between them that he must do this after his own fashion or not at all . As they passed where he sat , Kit looked so wistfully at the little turn - out , that the old gentleman looked at him . Kit rising and putting his hand to his hat , the old gentleman intimated to the pony that he wished to stop , to which proposal the pony ( who seldom objected to that part of his duty ) graciously acceded . ‘
51354	51358	51359	51359	I	0	’ said Kit . ‘
51360	51377	51349	51349	your	1319	’m sorry you stopped , sir . I only meant did you want your horse minded . ’
51378	51380	51349	51349	your	1319	‘ I ’m
51390	51396	51349	51349	your	1319	’ returned the old gentleman . ‘
51412	51483	51406	51406	you	0	’ Kit thanked him , and joyfully obeyed . The pony ran off at a sharp angle to inspect a lamp - post on the opposite side of the way , and then went off at a tangent to another lamp - post on the other side . Having satisfied himself that they were of the same pattern and materials , he came to a stop apparently absorbed in meditation . ‘
51491	51499	51485	51485	you	0	’ said the old gentleman , gravely , ‘
51517	51523	51525	51525	you	0	’ The pony remained immoveable . ‘
51529	51535	51525	51525	you	0	’ said the old lady . ‘
51541	51547	51540	51540	I	0	’m ashamed of such conduct . ’
51591	51596	51562	51562	he	0	‘ Witherden -- Notary . ’
51782	51787	51998	52000	the old lady	642	‘ oh , delicious ! ’
51788	51795	51998	52000	the old lady	642	‘ oh , fragrant , indeed ! ’
51823	51835	51837	51839	the old lady	642	‘ I brought it in honour of the occasion , Sir , ’
51841	51864	51837	51839	the old lady	642	‘ Ah ! an occasion indeed , ma’am , an occasion which does honour to me , ma’am , honour to me , ’
51872	51991	51837	51839	the old lady	642	‘ I have had many a gentleman articled to me , ma’am , many a one . Some of them are now rolling in riches , unmindful of their old companion and friend , ma’am , others are in the habit of calling upon me to this day and saying , “ Mr Witherden , some of the pleasantest hours I ever spent in my life were spent in this office -- were spent , Sir , upon this very stool ” ; but there was never one among the number , ma’am , attached as I have been to many of them , of whom I augured such bright things as I do of your only son . ’
51992	51996	51998	52000	the old lady	642	‘ Oh dear ! ’
52002	52019	51998	52000	the old lady	642	‘ How happy you do make us when you tell us that , to be sure ! ’
52020	52027	52029	52030	Mr Witherden	137	‘ I tell you , ma’am , ’
52032	52102	52029	52030	Mr Witherden	137	‘ what I think as an honest man , which , as the poet observes , is the noblest work of God . I agree with the poet in every particular , ma’am . The mountainous Alps on the one hand , or a humming - bird on the other , is nothing , in point of workmanship , to an honest man -- or woman -- or woman . ’
52103	52113	51998	52000	the old lady	642	‘ Anything that Mr Witherden can say of me , ’
52120	52135	51998	52000	the old lady	642	‘ I can say , with interest , of him , I am sure . ’
52136	52148	52150	52151	the Notary	1334	‘ It ’s a happy circumstance , a truly happy circumstance , ’
52153	52198	52150	52151	the Notary	1334	‘ to happen too upon his eight - and - twentieth birthday , and I hope I know how to appreciate it . I trust , Mr Garland , my dear Sir , that we may mutually congratulate each other upon this auspicious occasion . ’
52264	52333	52243	52243	he	808	‘ Marrying as his mother and I did , late in life , sir , after waiting for a great many years , until we were well enough off -- coming together when we were no longer young , and then being blessed with one child who has always been dutiful and affectionate -- why , it ’s a source of great happiness to us both , sir . ’
52334	52347	52349	52350	the Notary	1334	‘ Of course it is , I have no doubt of it , ’
52356	52413	52349	52350	the Notary	1334	‘ It ’s the contemplation of this sort of thing , that makes me deplore my fate in being a bachelor . There was a young lady once , sir , the daughter of an outfitting warehouse of the first respectability -- but that ’s a weakness . Chuckster , bring in Mr Abel ’s articles . ’
52414	52421	52423	52425	the old lady	642	‘ You see , Mr Witherden , ’
52427	52476	52423	52425	the old lady	642	‘ that Abel has not been brought up like the run of young men . He has always had a pleasure in our society , and always been with us . Abel has never been absent from us , for a day ; has he , my dear ? ’
52477	52483	52485	52487	the old gentleman	808	‘ Never , my dear , ’
52489	52540	52485	52487	the old gentleman	808	‘ except when he went to Margate one Saturday with Mr Tomkinley that had been a teacher at that school he went to , and came back upon the Monday ; but he was very ill after that , you remember , my dear ; it was quite a dissipation . ’
52541	52552	52554	52556	the old lady	642	‘ He was not used to it , you know , ’
52558	52593	52554	52556	the old lady	642	‘ and he could n’t bear it , that ’s the truth . Besides he had no comfort in being there without us , and had nobody to talk to or enjoy himself with . ’
52594	52602	52423	52425	the old lady	642	‘ That was it , you know , ’
52615	52656	52423	52425	the old lady	642	‘ I was quite abroad , mother , quite desolate , and to think that the sea was between us -- oh , I never shall forget what I felt when I first thought that the sea was between us ! ’
52657	52664	52666	52667	the Notary	1334	‘ Very natural under the circumstances , ’
52669	52821	52666	52667	the Notary	1334	‘ Mr Abel ’s feelings did credit to his nature , and credit to your nature , ma’am , and his father ’s nature , and human nature . I trace the same current now , flowing through all his quiet and unobtrusive proceedings.--I am about to sign my name , you observe , at the foot of the articles which Mr Chuckster will witness ; and placing my finger upon this blue wafer with the vandyked corners , I am constrained to remark in a distinct tone of voice -- don’t be alarmed , ma’am , it is merely a form of law -- that I deliver this , as my act and deed . Mr Abel will place his name against the other wafer , repeating the same cabalistic words , and the business is over . Ha ha ha ! You see how easily these things are done ! ’

53823	54694	55453	55453	Christian	75	’ eyes , shed light even into dreams , and chased away the shadows of the night . Birds in hot rooms , covered up close and dark , felt it was morning , and chafed and grew restless in their little cells ; bright - eyed mice crept back to their tiny homes and nestled timidly together ; the sleek house - cat , forgetful of her prey , sat winking at the rays of sun starting through keyhole and cranny in the door , and longed for her stealthy run and warm sleek bask outside . The nobler beasts confined in dens , stood motionless behind their bars and gazed on fluttering boughs , and sunshine peeping through some little window , with eyes in which old forests gleamed -- then trod impatiently the track their prisoned feet had worn -- and stopped and gazed again . Men in their dungeons stretched their cramp cold limbs and cursed the stone that no bright sky could warm . The flowers that sleep by night , opened their gentle eyes and turned them to the day . The light , creation ’s mind , was everywhere , and all things owned its power . The two pilgrims , often pressing each other ’s hands , or exchanging a smile or cheerful look , pursued their way in silence . Bright and happy as it was , there was something solemn in the long , deserted streets , from which , like bodies without souls , all habitual character and expression had departed , leaving but one dead uniform repose , that made them all alike . All was so still at that early hour , that the few pale people whom they met seemed as much unsuited to the scene , as the sickly lamp which had been here and there left burning , was powerless and faint in the full glory of the sun . Before they had penetrated very far into the labyrinth of men ’s abodes which yet lay between them and the outskirts , this aspect began to melt away , and noise and bustle to usurp its place . Some straggling carts and coaches rumbling by , first broke the charm , then others came , then others yet more active , then a crowd . The wonder was , at first , to see a tradesman ’s window open , but it was a rare thing soon to see one closed ; then , smoke rose slowly from the chimneys , and sashes were thrown up to let in air , and doors were opened , and servant girls , looking lazily in all directions but their brooms , scattered brown clouds of dust into the eyes of shrinking passengers , or listened disconsolately to milkmen who spoke of country fairs , and told of waggons in the mews , with awnings and all things complete , and gallant swains to boot , which another hour would see upon their journey . This quarter passed , they came upon the haunts of commerce and great traffic , where many people were resorting , and business was already rife . The old man looked about him with a startled and bewildered gaze , for these were places that he hoped to shun . He pressed his finger on his lip , and drew the child along by narrow courts and winding ways , nor did he seem at ease until they had left it far behind , often casting a backward look towards it , murmuring that ruin and self - murder were crouching in every street , and would follow if they scented them ; and that they could not fly too fast . Again this quarter passed , they came upon a straggling neighbourhood , where the mean houses parcelled off in rooms , and windows patched with rags and paper , told of the populous poverty that sheltered there . The shops sold goods that only poverty could buy , and sellers and buyers were pinched and griped alike . Here were poor streets where faded gentility essayed with scanty space and shipwrecked means to make its last feeble stand , but tax - gatherer and creditor came there as elsewhere , and the poverty that yet faintly struggled was hardly less squalid and manifest than that which had long ago submitted and given up the game . This was a wide , wide track -- for the humble followers of the camp of wealth pitch their tents round about it for many a mile -- but its character was still the same . Damp rotten houses , many to let , many yet building , many half - built and mouldering away -- lodgings , where it would be hard to tell which needed pity most , those who let or those who came to take -- children , scantily fed and clothed , spread over every street , and sprawling in the dust -- scolding mothers , stamping their slipshod feet with noisy threats upon the pavement -- shabby fathers , hurrying with dispirited looks to the occupation which brought them ‘
54697	55412	55413	55414	Dear grandfather	937	’ and little more -- mangling - women , washer - women , cobblers , tailors , chandlers , driving their trades in parlours and kitchens and back room and garrets , and sometimes all of them under the same roof -- brick - fields skirting gardens paled with staves of old casks , or timber pillaged from houses burnt down , and blackened and blistered by the flames -- mounds of dock - weed , nettles , coarse grass and oyster - shells , heaped in rank confusion -- small dissenting chapels to teach , with no lack of illustration , the miseries of Earth , and plenty of new churches , erected with a little superfluous wealth , to show the way to Heaven . At length these streets becoming more straggling yet , dwindled and dwindled away , until there were only small garden patches bordering the road , with many a summer house innocent of paint and built of old timber or some fragments of a boat , green as the tough cabbage - stalks that grew about it , and grottoed at the seams with toad - stools and tight - sticking snails . To these succeeded pert cottages , two and two with plots of ground in front , laid out in angular beds with stiff box borders and narrow paths between , where footstep never strayed to make the gravel rough . Then came the public - house , freshly painted in green and white , with tea - gardens and a bowling green , spurning its old neighbour with the horse - trough where the waggons stopped ; then , fields ; and then , some houses , one by one , of goodly size with lawns , some even with a lodge where dwelt a porter and his wife . Then came a turnpike ; then fields again with trees and hay - stacks ; then , a hill , and on the top of that , the traveller might stop , and -- looking back at old Saint Paul ’s looming through the smoke , its cross peeping above the cloud ( if the day were clear ) , and glittering in the sun ; and casting his eyes upon the Babel out of which it grew until he traced it down to the furthest outposts of the invading army of bricks and mortar whose station lay for the present nearly at his feet -- might feel at last that he was clear of London . Near such a spot as this , and in a pleasant field , the old man and his little guide ( if guide she were , who knew not whither they were bound ) sat down to rest . She had had the precaution to furnish her basket with some slices of bread and meat , and here they made their frugal breakfast . The freshness of the day , the singing of the birds , the beauty of the waving grass , the deep green leaves , the wild flowers , and the thousand exquisite scents and sounds that floated in the air -- deep joys to most of us , but most of all to those whose life is in a crowd or who live solitarily in great cities as in the bucket of a human well -- sunk into their breasts and made them very glad . The child had repeated her artless prayers once that morning , more earnestly perhaps than she had ever done in all her life , but as she felt all this , they rose to her lips again . The old man took off his hat -- he had no memory for the words -- but he said amen , and that they were very good . There had been an old copy of the Pilgrim ’s Progress , with strange plates , upon a shelf at home , over which she had often pored whole evenings , wondering whether it was true in every word , and where those distant countries with the curious names might be . As she looked back upon the place they had left , one part of it came strongly on her mind . ‘

55688	55745	55685	55686	the grandfather	436	‘ I do n’t know how it is , I could once , but the time ’s gone . Do n’t leave me , Nell ; say that thou’lt not leave me . I loved thee all the while , indeed I did . If I lose thee too , my dear , I must die ! ’

It was not easy to determine , for she was timid and fearful of being repulsed . Here was a crying child , and there a noisy wife . In this , the people seemed too poor ; in that , too many . At length she stopped at one where the family were seated round the table -- chiefly because there was an old man sitting in a cushioned chair beside the hearth , and she thought he was a grandfather and would feel for hers . There were besides , the cottager and his wife , and three young sturdy children , brown as berries . The request was no sooner preferred , than granted . The eldest boy ran out to fetch some milk , the second dragged two stools towards the door , and the youngest crept to his mother ’s gown , and looked at the strangers from beneath his sunburnt hand . ‘
56506	56517	56504	56504	master	5881	’ said the old cottager in a thin piping voice ; ‘

He did n’t wish to trouble nobody , and if he had troubled anybody by what he said , he asked pardon , that was all . The milk arrived , and the child producing her little basket , and selecting its best fragments for her grandfather , they made a hearty meal . The furniture of the room was very homely of course -- a few rough chairs and a table , a corner cupboard with their little stock of crockery and delf , a gaudy tea - tray , representing a lady in bright red , walking out with a very blue parasol , a few common , coloured scripture subjects in frames upon the wall and chimney , an old dwarf clothes - press and an eight - day clock , with a few bright saucepans and a kettle , comprised the whole . But everything was clean and neat , and as the child glanced round , she felt a tranquil air of comfort and content to which she had long been unaccustomed . ‘
57053	57060	57097	57099	the old man	384	’ she asked of the husband . ‘
57071	57076	57097	57099	the old man	384	’ was the reply , ‘

57189	57196	57139	57140	the man	325	’ returned the old man fretfully . ‘

57216	57227	57209	57209	We	1464	’ said the child , yielding to his restless wish . ‘

To them the jolting cart was a luxurious carriage , and the ride the most delicious in the world . Nell had scarcely settled herself on a little heap of straw in one corner , when she fell asleep , for the first time that day . She was awakened by the stopping of the cart , which was about to turn up a bye - lane . The driver kindly got down to help her out , and pointing to some trees at a very short distance before them , said that the town lay there , and that they had better take the path which they would see leading through the churchyard . Accordingly , towards this spot , they directed their weary steps . CHAPTER 16 The sun was setting when they reached the wicket - gate at which the path began , and , as the rain falls upon the just and unjust alike , it shed its warm tint even upon the resting - places of the dead , and bade them be of good hope for its rising on the morrow . The church was old and grey , with ivy clinging to the walls , and round the porch . Shunning the tombs , it crept about the mounds , beneath which slept poor humble men : twining for them the first wreaths they had ever won , but wreaths less liable to wither and far more lasting in their kind , than some which were graven deep in stone and marble , and told in pompous terms of virtues meekly hidden for many a year , and only revealed at last to executors and mourning legatees . The clergyman ’s horse , stumbling with a dull blunt sound among the graves , was cropping the grass ; at once deriving orthodox consolation from the dead parishioners , and enforcing last Sunday ’s text that this was what all flesh came to ; a lean ass who had sought to expound it also , without being qualified and ordained , was pricking his ears in an empty pound hard by , and looking with hungry eyes upon his priestly neighbour . The old man and the child quitted the gravel path , and strayed among the tombs ; for there the ground was soft , and easy to their tired feet . As they passed behind the church , they heard voices near at hand , and presently came on those who had spoken . They were two men who were seated in easy attitudes upon the grass , and so busily engaged as to be at first unconscious of intruders . It was not difficult to divine that they were of a class of itinerant showmen -- exhibitors of the freaks of Punch -- for , perched cross - legged upon a tombstone behind them , was a figure of that hero himself , his nose and chin as hooked and his face as beaming as usual . Perhaps his imperturbable character was never more strikingly developed , for he preserved his usual equable smile notwithstanding that his body was dangling in a most uncomfortable position , all loose and limp and shapeless , while his long peaked cap , unequally balanced against his exceedingly slight legs , threatened every instant to bring him toppling down . In part scattered upon the ground at the feet of the two men , and in part jumbled together in a long flat box , were the other persons of the Drama . The hero ’s wife and one child , the hobby - horse , the doctor , the foreign gentleman who not being familiar with the language is unable in the representation to express his ideas otherwise than by the utterance of the word ‘
58206	58482	58485	58485	you	1480	’ three distinct times , the radical neighbour who will by no means admit that a tin bell is an organ , the executioner , and the devil , were all here . Their owners had evidently come to that spot to make some needful repairs in the stage arrangements , for one of them was engaged in binding together a small gallows with thread , while the other was intent upon fixing a new black wig , with the aid of a small hammer and some tacks , upon the head of the radical neighbour , who had been beaten bald . They raised their eyes when the old man and his young companion were close upon them , and pausing in their work , returned their looks of curiosity . One of them , the actual exhibitor no doubt , was a little merry - faced man with a twinkling eye and a red nose , who seemed to have unconsciously imbibed something of his hero ’s character . The other -- that was he who took the money -- had rather a careful and cautious look , which was perhaps inseparable from his occupation also . The merry man was the first to greet the strangers with a nod ; and following the old man ’s eyes , he observed that perhaps that was the first time he had ever seen a Punch off the stage . ( Punch , it may be remarked , seemed to be pointing with the tip of his cap to a most flourishing epitaph , and to be chuckling over it with all his heart . ) ‘
58492	58512	58485	58485	you	1480	’ said the old man , sitting down beside them , and looking at the figures with extreme delight . ‘
58517	58523	58514	58514	you	1480	’ rejoined the little man , ‘
58525	58546	58514	58514	you	1480	’re putting up for to - night at the public - house yonder , and it would n’t do to let ‘
58555	58556	58547	58547	em	1482	’ ‘
58559	58572	58547	58547	em	1482	’ cried the old man , making signs to Nell to listen , ‘

58602	58608	58610	58610	you	1480	’ replied the little man . ‘

58634	58658	58610	58610	you	1480	’ said the old man , venturing to touch one of the puppets , and drawing away his hand with a shrill laugh . ‘
58664	58673	58684	58685	the other	5966	‘ em to - night ? are you ? ’
58674	58682	58684	58685	the other	5966	‘ That is the intention , governor , ’

58778	58793	58765	58765	he	144	‘ I do n’t care if we have n’t lost a farden , but you ’re

58824	58843	58845	58846	his companion	6044	‘ Ah ! it ’s been the spoiling of you , Tommy , your taking to that branch , ’
58848	58873	58874	58876	a universal mistruster	1489	‘ When you played the ghost in the reg’lar drama in the fairs , you believed in everything -- except ghosts . But now you ’re

58950	58977	58934	58935	Mr Codlin	144	‘ Look here ; here ’s all this judy ’s clothes falling to pieces again . You have n’t got a needle and thread I suppose ? ’
59013	59051	59008	59009	the child	324	‘ I have a needle , Sir , in my basket , and thread too . Will you let me try to mend it for you ? I think I could do it neater than you could . ’
59136	59148	59150	59151	the child	324	‘ N -- no further to - night , I think , ’
59158	59161	59150	59151	the child	324	‘ If you ’re

59207	59473	59474	59476	These two gentlemen	1504	’ The old man , notwithstanding his fatigue , would have remained in the churchyard all night if his new acquaintances had remained there too . As he yielded to this suggestion a ready and rapturous assent , they all rose and walked away together ; he keeping close to the box of puppets in which he was quite absorbed , the merry little man carrying it slung over his arm by a strap attached to it for the purpose , Nelly having hold of her grandfather ’s hand , and Mr Codlin sauntering slowly behind , casting up at the church tower and neighbouring trees such looks as he was accustomed in town - practice to direct to drawing - room and nursery windows , when seeking for a profitable spot on which to plant the show . The public - house was kept by a fat old landlord and landlady who made no objection to receiving their new guests , but praised Nelly ’s beauty and were at once prepossessed in her behalf . There was no other company in the kitchen but the two showmen , and the child felt very thankful that they had fallen upon such good quarters . The landlady was very much astonished to learn that they had come all the way from London , and appeared to have no little curiosity touching their farther destination . The child parried her inquiries as well as she could , and with no great trouble , for finding that they appeared to give her pain , the old lady desisted . ‘
59486	59496	59474	59476	These two gentlemen	1504	’ she said , taking her into the bar ; ‘
59525	59564	59569	59570	the child	324	’m sure you must want it after all you ’ve gone through to - day . Now , do n’t look after the old gentleman , because when you ’ve drank that , he shall have some too . ’

61057	61066	61067	61067	She	6151	‘ I was his wife , my dear . ’
61093	61102	61104	61106	the old woman	6151	‘ You wonder to hear me say that , ’

61674	61686	61688	61689	the child	324	‘ Indeed I hardly know -- we have not determined yet , ’

61770	61858	61762	61762	Nell	72	’ The child considered for a moment , and reflecting that she must shortly beg , and could scarcely hope to do so at a better place than where crowds of rich ladies and gentlemen were assembled together for purposes of enjoyment and festivity , determined to accompany these men so far . She therefore thanked the little man for his offer , and said , glancing timidly towards his friend , that if there was no objection to their accompanying them as far as the race town-- ‘
61861	61867	61762	61762	Nell	72	’ said the little man . ‘

Short Trotters however , being a compound name , inconvenient of use in friendly dialogue , the gentleman on whom it had been bestowed was known among his intimates either as ‘
62101	62103	62104	62104	Trotters	145	’ or ‘
62106	62364	62365	62365	master	5881	’ and was seldom accosted at full length as Short Trotters , except in formal conversations and on occasions of ceremony . Short , then , or Trotters , as the reader pleases , returned unto the remonstrance of his friend Mr Thomas Codlin a jocose answer calculated to turn aside his discontent ; and applying himself with great relish to the cold boiled beef , the tea , and bread and butter , strongly impressed upon his companions that they should do the like . Mr Codlin indeed required no such persuasion , as he had already eaten as much as he could possibly carry and was now moistening his clay with strong ale , whereof he took deep draughts with a silent relish and invited nobody to partake -- thus again strongly indicating his misanthropical turn of mind . Breakfast being at length over , Mr Codlin called the bill , and charging the ale to the company generally ( a practice also savouring of misanthropy ) divided the sum - total into two fair and equal parts , assigning one moiety to himself and friend , and the other to Nelly and her grandfather . These being duly discharged and all things ready for their departure , they took farewell of the landlord and landlady and resumed their journey . And here Mr Codlin ’s false position in society and the effect it wrought upon his wounded spirit , were strongly illustrated ; for whereas he had been last night accosted by Mr Punch as ‘
62367	63066	62365	62365	master	5881	’ and had by inference left the audience to understand that he maintained that individual for his own luxurious entertainment and delight , here he was , now , painfully walking beneath the burden of that same Punch ’s temple , and bearing it bodily upon his shoulders on a sultry day and along a dusty road . In place of enlivening his patron with a constant fire of wit or the cheerful rattle of his quarter - staff on the heads of his relations and acquaintance , here was that beaming Punch utterly devoid of spine , all slack and drooping in a dark box , with his legs doubled up round his neck , and not one of his social qualities remaining . Mr Codlin trudged heavily on , exchanging a word or two at intervals with Short , and stopping to rest and growl occasionally . Short led the way ; with the flat box , the private luggage ( which was not extensive ) tied up in a bundle , and a brazen trumpet slung from his shoulder - blade . Nell and her grandfather walked next him on either hand , and Thomas Codlin brought up the rear . When they came to any town or village , or even to a detached house of good appearance , Short blew a blast upon the brazen trumpet and carolled a fragment of a song in that hilarious tone common to Punches and their consorts . If people hurried to the windows , Mr Codlin pitched the temple , and hastily unfurling the drapery and concealing Short therewith , flourished hysterically on the pipes and performed an air . Then the entertainment began as soon as might be ; Mr Codlin having the responsibility of deciding on its length and of protracting or expediting the time for the hero ’s final triumph over the enemy of mankind , according as he judged that the after - crop of half - pence would be plentiful or scant . When it had been gathered in to the last farthing , he resumed his load and on they went again . Sometimes they played out the toll across a bridge or ferry , and once exhibited by particular desire at a turnpike , where the collector , being drunk in his solitude , paid down a shilling to have it to himself . There was one small place of rich promise in which their hopes were blighted , for a favourite character in the play having gold - lace upon his coat and being a meddling wooden - headed fellow was held to be a libel on the beadle , for which reason the authorities enforced a quick retreat ; but they were generally well received , and seldom left a town without a troop of ragged children shouting at their heels . They made a long day ’s journey , despite these interruptions , and were yet upon the road when the moon was shining in the sky . Short beguiled the time with songs and jests , and made the best of everything that happened . Mr Codlin on the other hand , cursed his fate , and all the hollow things of earth ( but Punch especially ) , and limped along with the theatre on his back , a prey to the bitterest chagrin . They had stopped to rest beneath a finger - post where four roads met , and Mr Codlin in his deep misanthropy had let down the drapery and seated himself in the bottom of the show , invisible to mortal eyes and disdainful of the company of his fellow creatures , when two monstrous shadows were seen stalking towards them from a turning in the road by which they had come . The child was at first quite terrified by the sight of these gaunt giants -- for such they looked as they advanced with lofty strides beneath the shadow of the trees -- but Short , telling her there was nothing to fear , blew a blast upon the trumpet , which was answered by a cheerful shout . ‘
63076	63085	63069	63069	Grinder	148	’ cried Mr Short in a loud key . ‘
63088	63096	63069	63069	Grinder	148	’ replied a couple of shrill voices . ‘
63101	63105	62365	62365	master	5881	’ said Short . ‘
63120	63124	63118	63118	you	1603	’ Thus invited , ‘
63128	63267	62365	62365	master	5881	’ approached with redoubled speed and soon came up with the little party . Mr Grinder ’s company , familiarly termed a lot , consisted of a young gentleman and a young lady on stilts , and Mr Grinder himself , who used his natural legs for pedestrian purposes and carried at his back a drum . The public costume of the young people was of the Highland kind , but the night being damp and cold , the young gentleman wore over his kilt a man ’s pea jacket reaching to his ankles , and a glazed hat ; the young lady too was muffled in an old cloth pelisse and had a handkerchief tied about her head . Their Scotch bonnets , ornamented with plumes of jet black feathers , Mr Grinder carried on his instrument . ‘
63276	63286	63289	63289	we	1604	’ said Mr Grinder coming up out of breath . ‘
63297	63351	63293	63293	you	0	’ With that they shook hands in a very friendly manner . The young people being too high up for the ordinary salutations , saluted Short after their own fashion . The young gentleman twisted up his right stilt and patted him on the shoulder , and the young lady rattled her tambourine . ‘
63354	63363	63427	63427	Short	149	’ said Short , pointing to the stilts . ‘
63366	63370	63427	63427	Short	149	’ returned Grinder . ‘
63376	63378	63427	63427	Short	149	’ in ‘
63382	63384	63427	63427	Short	149	’ of ‘
63391	63393	63427	63427	Short	149	’ in ‘
63410	63417	63427	63427	Short	149	’ ? We go the nighest . ’
63418	63425	63427	63427	Short	149	‘ Why , the fact is , ’
63429	63488	63427	63427	Short	149	‘ that we are going the longest way , because then we could stop for the night , a mile and a half on . But three or four mile gained to - night is so many saved to - morrow , and if you keep on , I think our best way is to do the same . ’
63489	63495	63497	63497	Grinder	148	‘ Where ’s your partner ? ’
63499	63504	63506	63508	Mr Thomas Codlin	144	‘ Here he is , ’
63533	63557	63427	63427	Short	149	‘ and he ’ll see his partner boiled alive before he ’ll go on to - night . That ’s what he says . ’
63558	63579	63581	63581	Short	149	‘ Well , do n’t say such things as them , in a spear which is dewoted to something pleasanter , ’
63583	63597	63581	63581	Short	149	‘ Respect associations , Tommy , even if you do cut up rough . ’
63598	63603	63605	63606	Mr Codlin	144	‘ Rough or smooth , ’
63643	63706	63616	63616	Punch	143	‘ rough or smooth , I wo n’t go further than the mile and a half to - night . I put up at the Jolly Sandboys and nowhere else . If you like to come there , come there . If you like to go on by yourself , go on by yourself , and do without me if you can . ’
64118	64122	64124	64125	Mr Codlin	144	‘ All alone ? ’
64136	64142	64144	64145	the landlord	1518	‘ All alone as yet , ’
64152	64196	64144	64145	the landlord	1518	‘ but we shall have more company to - night I expect . Here one of you boys , carry that show into the barn . Make haste in out of the wet , Tom ; when it came on to rain I told ‘
64219	64485	64214	64214	I	0	’ Mr Codlin followed with a willing mind , and soon found that the landlord had not commended his preparations without good reason . A mighty fire was blazing on the hearth and roaring up the wide chimney with a cheerful sound , which a large iron cauldron , bubbling and simmering in the heat , lent its pleasant aid to swell . There was a deep red ruddy blush upon the room , and when the landlord stirred the fire , sending the flames skipping and leaping up -- when he took off the lid of the iron pot and there rushed out a savoury smell , while the bubbling sound grew deeper and more rich , and an unctuous steam came floating out , hanging in a delicious mist above their heads -- when he did this , Mr Codlin ’s heart was touched . He sat down in the chimney - corner and smiled . Mr Codlin sat smiling in the chimney - corner , eyeing the landlord as with a roguish look he held the cover in his hand , and , feigning that his doing so was needful to the welfare of the cookery , suffered the delightful steam to tickle the nostrils of his guest . The glow of the fire was upon the landlord ’s bald head , and upon his twinkling eye , and upon his watering mouth , and upon his pimpled face , and upon his round fat figure . Mr Codlin drew his sleeve across his lips , and said in a murmuring voice , ‘
64490	64491	64214	64214	I	0	’ ‘
64499	64507	64214	64214	I	0	’ said the landlord smacking his lips , ‘
64513	64518	64214	64214	I	0	’ smacking them again , ‘
64522	64528	64719	64719	his	144	’ smacking them once more , ‘
64532	64540	64719	64719	his	144	’ smacking them for the fourth time , ‘
64563	64610	64719	64719	his	144	’ Having come to the climax , he smacked his lips a great many times , and taking a long hearty sniff of the fragrance that was hovering about , put on the cover again with the air of one whose toils on earth were over . ‘
64619	64625	64719	64719	his	144	’ asked Mr Codlin faintly . ‘
64634	64679	64719	64719	his	144	’ said the landlord looking up to the clock -- and the very clock had a colour in its fat white face , and looked a clock for jolly Sandboys to consult--‘it’ll be done to a turn at twenty - two minutes before eleven . ’
64680	64683	64685	64686	Mr Codlin	144	‘ Then , ’
64688	64717	64685	64686	Mr Codlin	144	‘ fetch me a pint of warm ale , and do n’t let nobody bring into the room even so much as a biscuit till the time arrives . ’
65003	65009	64997	64997	Short	149	‘ What a delicious smell ! ’
65119	65124	65126	65127	the landlord	1518	‘ Who are they ? ’
65140	65146	65148	65149	the host	1646	‘ Do n’t you know ? ’
65156	65160	65161	65161	he	144	‘ Not I , ’
65164	65166	65161	65161	he	144	‘ They ’re
65173	65174	65175	65175	They	1647	’ ‘
65176	65180	65182	65182	Short	149	’re no harm , ’
65184	65206	65182	65182	Short	149	‘ Depend upon that . I tell you what -- it ’s plain that the old man an’t in his right mind-- ’
65207	65220	65222	65223	Mr Codlin	144	‘ If you have n’t got anything newer than that to say , ’
65230	65248	65222	65223	Mr Codlin	144	‘ you ’d better let us fix our minds upon the supper , and not disturb us . ’
65249	65258	65260	65261	his friend	5985	‘ Hear me out , wo n’t you ? ’
65263	65275	65260	65261	his friend	5985	‘ It ’s very plain to me , besides , that they ’re
65315	65316	65311	65311	I	0	’ ‘
65326	65343	65311	65311	I	0	’ growled Mr Codlin , again glancing at the clock and from it to the cauldron , ‘
65361	65364	65346	65346	you	0	‘ em ? ’
65365	65375	65377	65377	Short	149	‘ I wish somebody would give you your supper , ’
65379	65420	65377	65377	Short	149	‘ for there ’ll be no peace till you ’ve got it . Have you seen how anxious the old man is to get on -- always wanting to be furder away -- furder away . Have you seen that ? ’
65421	65427	65429	65430	Thomas Codlin	144	‘ Ah ! what then ? ’
65432	65437	65439	65439	Short	149	‘ This , then , ’
65441	65500	65439	65439	Short	149	‘ He has given his friends the slip . Mind what I say -- he has given his friends the slip , and persuaded this delicate young creetur all along of her fondness for him to be his guide and travelling companion -- where to , he knows no more than the man in the moon . Now I ’m
65508	65509	65510	65510	YOU’RE	1650	’ ‘
65518	65562	65510	65510	YOU’RE	1650	’ cried Mr Codlin , glancing at the clock again and pulling his hair with both hands in a kind of frenzy , but whether occasioned by his companion ’s observation or the tardy pace of Time , it was difficult to determine . ‘
65571	65572	65573	65573	I	0	’ ‘
65575	65582	65510	65510	YOU’RE	1650	’ repeated Short emphatically and slowly , ‘

65687	65736	65685	65685	Short	149	’ said Mr Codlin , who with his head upon his hands , and his elbows on his knees , had been shaking himself impatiently from side to side up to this point and occasionally stamping on the ground , but who now looked up with eager eyes ; ‘
65769	65774	65775	65775	His	149	’re partners in everything ! ’
66211	66224	66226	66226	Short	149	‘ Your people do n’t usually travel in character , do they ? ’
66236	66245	66226	66226	Short	149	‘ It must come expensive if they do ? ’
66246	66249	66251	66251	Jerry	151	‘ No , ’
66253	66307	66251	66251	Jerry	151	‘ no , it ’s not the custom with us . But we ’ve been playing a little on the road to - day , and we come out with a new wardrobe at the races , so I did n’t think it worth while to stop to undress . Down , Pedro ! ’
66364	66372	66374	66374	Jerry	151	‘ I ’ve got a animal here , ’
66409	66424	66394	66394	he	151	‘ a animal here , wot I think you know something of , Short . ’
66425	66428	66430	66430	Short	149	‘ Ah ! ’
66432	66441	66430	66430	Short	149	‘ let ’s have a look at him . ’
66442	66447	66449	66449	Jerry	151	‘ Here he is , ’
66459	66471	66449	66449	Jerry	151	‘ He was once a Toby of yours , warn’t he ! ’
66928	66952	66954	66954	Jerry	151	‘ No , my dear , no , not an atom from anybody ’s hand but mine if you please . That dog , ’
66972	66986	66954	66954	Jerry	151	‘ lost a halfpenny to - day . He goes without his supper . ’
67009	67018	67020	67020	Jerry	151	‘ You must be more careful , Sir , ’
67039	67065	67066	67067	The dog	1699	‘ Come here . Now , Sir , you play away at that , while we have supper , and leave off if you dare . ’
67111	67116	67118	67118	Jerry	151	‘ Now , gentlemen , ’
67125	67147	67118	67118	Jerry	151	‘ The dog whose name ’s called , eats . The dogs whose names an’t called , keep quiet . Carlo ! ’
67450	67456	67458	67458	Short	149	‘ How ’s the Giant ? ’
67469	67476	67458	67458	Short	149	‘ Rather weak upon his legs , ’
67481	67494	67478	67479	Mr Vuffin	155	‘ I begin to be afraid he ’s going at the knees . ’
67495	67504	67506	67506	Short	149	‘ That ’s a bad look - out , ’
67508	67514	67516	67517	Mr Vuffin	155	‘ Aye ! Bad indeed , ’
67526	67553	67516	67517	Mr Vuffin	155	‘ Once get a giant shaky on his legs , and the public care no more about him than they do for a dead cabbage stalk . ’
67554	67561	67563	67563	Short	149	‘ What becomes of old giants ? ’
67574	67576	67563	67563	Short	149	‘ They ’re
67587	67592	67516	67517	Mr Vuffin	155	’ said Mr Vuffin . ‘

67705	67710	67681	67681	he	1726	’ pursued Mr Vuffin , ‘
67734	67735	67727	67727	you	1728	’ ‘
67743	67754	67736	67736	I	0	’ said Short . And the landlord said so too . ‘
67761	67774	67758	67758	you	1728	’ said Mr Vuffin , waving his pipe with an argumentative air , ‘
67822	67863	67865	67866	Mr Vuffin	155	‘ un -- as left his carawan some year ago and took to carrying coach - bills about London , making himself as cheap as crossing - sweepers . He died . I make no insinuation against anybody in particular , ’
67872	67882	67865	67866	Mr Vuffin	155	‘ but he was ruining the trade;--and he died . ’
67908	67916	67918	67919	Mr Vuffin	155	‘ I know you do , Jerry , ’
67924	68078	67918	67919	Mr Vuffin	155	‘ I know you remember it , Jerry , and the universal opinion was , that it served him right . Why , I remember the time when old Maunders as had three - and - twenty wans -- I remember the time when old Maunders had in his cottage in Spa Fields in the winter time , when the season was over , eight male and female dwarfs setting down to dinner every day , who was waited on by eight old giants in green coats , red smalls , blue cotton stockings , and high - lows : and there was one dwarf as had grown elderly and wicious who whenever his giant was n’t quick enough to please him , used to stick pins in his legs , not being able to reach up any higher . I know that ’s a fact , for Maunders told it me himself . ’
68079	68089	68091	68092	the landlord	1518	‘ What about the dwarfs when they get old ? ’
68094	68107	68109	68110	Mr Vuffin	155	‘ The older a dwarf is , the better worth he is , ’
68112	68160	68109	68110	Mr Vuffin	155	‘ a grey - headed dwarf , well wrinkled , is beyond all suspicion . But a giant weak in the legs and not standing upright!--keep him in the carawan , but never show him , never show him , for any persuasion that can be offered . ’
68334	68340	68342	68343	the child	324	‘ What is the matter ? ’
68345	68354	68342	68343	the child	324	‘ Nothing ’s the matter , my dear , ’
68359	68361	68342	68343	the child	324	‘ I ’m

68389	68394	68395	68395	Short	149	’ the child inquired . ‘

68430	68450	68429	68429	I	0	’m the real , open - hearted man . I may n’t look it , but I am indeed . ’
68479	68489	68491	68492	the misanthrope	1511	‘ Short ’s very well , and seems kind , ’
68494	68505	68491	68492	the misanthrope	1511	‘ but he overdoes it . Now I do n’t . ’
68550	68555	68557	68557	Codlin	144	‘ Take my advice , ’
68559	68607	68557	68557	Codlin	144	‘ do n’t ask me why , but take it . As long as you travel with us , keep as near me as you can . Do n’t offer to leave us -- not on any account -- but always stick to me and say that I ’m

68642	68648	68612	68612	you	324	’ inquired the child innocently . ‘
68655	68670	68612	68612	you	324	’ replied Codlin , a little put out as it seemed by the question ; ‘
68672	68719	68612	68612	you	324	’m only anxious that you should think me so , and do me justice . You ca n’t think what an interest I have in you . Why did n’t you tell me your little history -- that about you and the poor old gentleman ? I ’m

68919	68922	68924	68927	the child from within	1764	‘ Yes , ’
68929	68941	68924	68927	the child from within	1764	‘ It ’s me -- Short’--a voice called through the keyhole . ‘
69001	69012	68996	68996	I	0	’ The child answered in the affirmative , and returning his ‘
69015	70422	70423	70423	Grandfather	85	’ heard him creep away . She felt some uneasiness at the anxiety of these men , increased by the recollection of their whispering together down stairs and their slight confusion when she awoke , nor was she quite free from a misgiving that they were not the fittest companions she could have stumbled on . Her uneasiness , however , was nothing , weighed against her fatigue ; and she soon forgot it in sleep . Very early next morning , Short fulfilled his promise , and knocking softly at her door , entreated that she would get up directly , as the proprietor of the dogs was still snoring , and if they lost no time they might get a good deal in advance both of him and the conjuror , who was talking in his sleep , and from what he could be heard to say , appeared to be balancing a donkey in his dreams . She started from her bed without delay , and roused the old man with so much expedition that they were both ready as soon as Short himself , to that gentleman ’s unspeakable gratification and relief . After a very unceremonious and scrambling breakfast , of which the staple commodities were bacon and bread , and beer , they took leave of the landlord and issued from the door of the jolly Sandboys . The morning was fine and warm , the ground cool to the feet after the late rain , the hedges gayer and more green , the air clear , and everything fresh and healthful . Surrounded by these influences , they walked on pleasantly enough . They had not gone very far , when the child was again struck by the altered behaviour of Mr Thomas Codlin , who instead of plodding on sulkily by himself as he had heretofore done , kept close to her , and when he had an opportunity of looking at her unseen by his companion , warned her by certain wry faces and jerks of the head not to put any trust in Short , but to reserve all confidences for Codlin . Neither did he confine himself to looks and gestures , for when she and her grandfather were walking on beside the aforesaid Short , and that little man was talking with his accustomed cheerfulness on a variety of indifferent subjects , Thomas Codlin testified his jealousy and distrust by following close at her heels , and occasionally admonishing her ankles with the legs of the theatre in a very abrupt and painful manner . All these proceedings naturally made the child more watchful and suspicious , and she soon observed that whenever they halted to perform outside a village alehouse or other place , Mr Codlin while he went through his share of the entertainments kept his eye steadily upon her and the old man , or with a show of great friendship and consideration invited the latter to lean upon his arm , and so held him tight until the representation was over and they again went forward . Even Short seemed to change in this respect , and to mingle with his good - nature something of a desire to keep them in safe custody . This increased the child ’s misgivings , and made her yet more anxious and uneasy . Meanwhile , they were drawing near the town where the races were to begin next day ; for , from passing numerous groups of gipsies and trampers on the road , wending their way towards it , and straggling out from every by - way and cross - country lane , they gradually fell into a stream of people , some walking by the side of covered carts , others with horses , others with donkeys , others toiling on with heavy loads upon their backs , but all tending to the same point . The public - houses by the wayside , from being empty and noiseless as those in the remoter parts had been , now sent out boisterous shouts and clouds of smoke ; and , from the misty windows , clusters of broad red faces looked down upon the road . On every piece of waste or common ground , some small gambler drove his noisy trade , and bellowed to the idle passersby to stop and try their chance ; the crowd grew thicker and more noisy ; gilt gingerbread in blanket - stalls exposed its glories to the dust ; and often a four - horse carriage , dashing by , obscured all objects in the gritty cloud it raised , and left them , stunned and blinded , far behind . It was dark before they reached the town itself , and long indeed the few last miles had been . Here all was tumult and confusion ; the streets were filled with throngs of people -- many strangers were there , it seemed , by the looks they cast about -- the church - bells rang out their noisy peals , and flags streamed from windows and house - tops . In the large inn - yards waiters flitted to and fro and ran against each other , horses clattered on the uneven stones , carriage steps fell rattling down , and sickening smells from many dinners came in a heavy lukewarm breath upon the sense . In the smaller public - houses , fiddles with all their might and main were squeaking out the tune to staggering feet ; drunken men , oblivious of the burden of their song , joined in a senseless howl , which drowned the tinkling of the feeble bell and made them savage for their drink ; vagabond groups assembled round the doors to see the stroller woman dance , and add their uproar to the shrill flageolet and deafening drum . Through this delirious scene , the child , frightened and repelled by all she saw , led on her bewildered charge , clinging close to her conductor , and trembling lest in the press she should be separated from him and left to find her way alone . Quickening their steps to get clear of all the roar and riot , they at length passed through the town and made for the race - course , which was upon an open heath , situated on an eminence , a full mile distant from its furthest bounds . Although there were many people here , none of the best favoured or best clad , busily erecting tents and driving stakes in the ground , and hurrying to and fro with dusty feet and many a grumbled oath -- although there were tired children cradled on heaps of straw between the wheels of carts , crying themselves to sleep -- and poor lean horses and donkeys just turned loose , grazing among the men and women , and pots and kettles , and half - lighted fires , and ends of candles flaring and wasting in the air -- for all this , the child felt it an escape from the town and drew her breath more freely . After a scanty supper , the purchase of which reduced her little stock so low , that she had only a few halfpence with which to buy a breakfast on the morrow , she and the old man lay down to rest in a corner of a tent , and slept , despite the busy preparations that were going on around them all night long . And now they had come to the time when they must beg their bread . Soon after sunrise in the morning she stole out from the tent , and rambling into some fields at a short distance , plucked a few wild roses and such humble flowers , purposing to make them into little nosegays and offer them to the ladies in the carriages when the company arrived . Her thoughts were not idle while she was thus employed ; when she returned and was seated beside the old man in one corner of the tent , tying her flowers together , while the two men lay dozing in another corner , she plucked him by the sleeve , and slightly glancing towards them , said , in a low voice-- ‘
70486	70531	70474	70474	they	1771	’ The old man turned to her with an aspect of wild terror ; but she checked him by a look , and bidding him hold some flowers while she tied them up , and so bringing her lips closer to his ear , said-- ‘
70614	70626	70632	70634	the old man	384	’re only quiet now , we shall do so , easily . ’
70627	70630	70632	70634	the old man	384	‘ How ? ’
70636	70679	70632	70634	the old man	384	‘ Dear Nelly , how ? They will shut me up in a stone room , dark and cold , and chain me up to the wall , Nell -- flog me with whips , and never let me see thee more ! ’
70680	70682	70632	70634	the old man	384	‘ You ’re
70686	70691	70632	70634	the old man	384	’ said the child . ‘
70748	70749	70750	70750	Halloa	95	’ ‘
70761	70789	70792	70793	the friend	7232	’ said Mr Codlin , raising his head , and yawning . Then observing that his companion was fast asleep , he added in an earnest whisper , ‘
70800	70801	70790	70790	Codlin	144	’ ‘
70806	70811	70790	70790	Codlin	144	’ the child replied ; ‘
70839	70895	70896	70897	Tom Codlin	144	’ Mr Codlin would have risen to receive it , but the child hurried towards him and placed it in his hand . He stuck it in his buttonhole with an air of ineffable complacency for a misanthrope , and leering exultingly at the unconscious Short , muttered , as he laid himself down again , ‘
70905	71104	70899	70900	the friend	7232	’ As the morning wore on , the tents assumed a gayer and more brilliant appearance , and long lines of carriages came rolling softly on the turf . Men who had lounged about all night in smock - frocks and leather leggings , came out in silken vests and hats and plumes , as jugglers or mountebanks ; or in gorgeous liveries as soft - spoken servants at gambling booths ; or in sturdy yeoman dress as decoys at unlawful games . Black - eyed gipsy girls , hooded in showy handkerchiefs , sallied forth to tell fortunes , and pale slender women with consumptive faces lingered upon the footsteps of ventriloquists and conjurors , and counted the sixpences with anxious eyes long before they were gained . As many of the children as could be kept within bounds , were stowed away , with all the other signs of dirt and poverty , among the donkeys , carts , and horses ; and as many as could not be thus disposed of ran in and out in all intricate spots , crept between people ’s legs and carriage wheels , and came forth unharmed from under horses ’
71286	71294	71295	71295	they	1783	‘ See , what a pretty face ! ’
71939	71953	71955	71955	Kit	75	‘ I think they must certainly come to - morrow , eh mother ? ’
71971	71994	71995	71996	The mother	650	‘ They have been gone a week . They surely could n’t stop away more than a week , could they now ? ’
72012	72019	72021	72021	Kit	75	‘ For the matter of that , ’
72023	72051	72052	72052	em	1824	‘ you speak true and sensible enough , as you always do , mother . Still , I do consider that a week is quite long enough for ‘
72064	72065	72060	72060	you	75	’ ‘
72086	72142	72146	72146	you	75	’ Kit was for a moment disposed to be vexed by this contradiction , and not the less so from having anticipated it in his own mind and knowing how just it was . But the impulse was only momentary , and the vexed look became a kind one before it had crossed the room . ‘
72154	72169	72149	72149	mother	6118	‘ em ? You do n’t think they ’ve gone to sea , anyhow ? ’
72170	72178	72180	72181	the mother	650	‘ Not gone for sailors , certainly , ’
72186	72202	72180	72181	the mother	650	‘ But I ca n’t help thinking that they have gone to some foreign country . ’
72203	72207	72209	72209	Kit	75	‘ I say , ’
72215	72224	72209	72209	Kit	75	‘ do n’t talk like that , mother . ’
72225	72238	72239	72239	she	650	‘ I am afraid they have , and that ’s the truth , ’
72242	72300	72239	72239	she	650	‘ It ’s the talk of all the neighbours , and there are some even that know of their having been seen on board ship , and can tell you the name of the place they ’ve gone to , which is more than I can , my dear , for it ’s a very hard one . ’
72301	72308	72310	72310	Kit	75	‘ I do n’t believe it , ’
72312	72330	72310	72310	Kit	75	‘ Not a word of it . A set of idle chatterboxes , how should they know ! ’
72331	72339	72341	72342	the mother	650	‘ They may be wrong of course , ’
72344	72364	72341	72342	the mother	650	‘ I ca n’t tell about that , though I do n’t think it ’s at all unlikely that they ’re
72449	72833	72856	72858	the old gentleman	808	’ Kit scratched his head mournfully , in reluctant admission that it did not , and clambering up to the old nail took down the cage and set himself to clean it and to feed the bird . His thoughts reverting from this occupation to the little old gentleman who had given him the shilling , he suddenly recollected that that was the very day -- nay , nearly the very hour -- at which the little old gentleman had said he should be at the Notary ’s house again . He no sooner remembered this , than he hung up the cage with great precipitation , and hastily explaining the nature of his errand , went off at full speed to the appointed place . It was some two minutes after the time when he reached the spot , which was a considerable distance from his home , but by great good luck the little old gentleman had not yet arrived ; at least there was no pony - chaise to be seen , and it was not likely that he had come and gone again in so short a space . Greatly relieved to find that he was not too late , Kit leant against a lamp - post to take breath , and waited the advent of the pony and his charge . Sure enough , before long the pony came trotting round the corner of the street , looking as obstinate as pony might , and picking his steps as if he were spying about for the cleanest places , and would by no means dirty his feet or hurry himself inconveniently . Behind the pony sat the little old gentleman , and by the old gentleman ’s side sat the little old lady , carrying just such a nosegay as she had brought before . The old gentleman , the old lady , the pony , and the chaise , came up the street in perfect unanimity , until they arrived within some half a dozen doors of the Notary ’s house , when the pony , deceived by a brass - plate beneath a tailor ’s knocker , came to a halt , and maintained by a sturdy silence , that that was the house they wanted . ‘
72841	72854	72856	72858	the old gentleman	808	’ the goodness to go on ; this is not the place , ’
72886	72895	72897	72899	the old lady	642	‘ Oh dear , such a naughty Whisker ! ’
72901	72938	72897	72899	the old lady	642	‘ After being so good too , and coming along so well ! I am quite ashamed of him . I do n’t know what we are to do with him , I really do n’t . ’
73103	73109	73111	73113	the old gentleman	808	‘ Why , bless me , ’
73115	73128	73111	73113	the old gentleman	808	‘ the lad is here ! My dear , do you see ? ’
73129	73139	73141	73141	Kit	75	‘ I said I ’d be here , Sir , ’
73148	73168	73141	73141	Kit	75	‘ I hope you ’ve had a pleasant ride , sir . He ’s a very nice little pony . ’
73169	73173	73175	73177	the old gentleman	808	‘ My dear , ’
73179	73191	73175	73177	the old gentleman	808	‘ This is an uncommon lad ; a good lad , I ’m

73208	73224	73204	73206	the old lady	642	‘ A very good lad , and I am sure he is a good son . ’
73462	73465	73444	73444	he	139	‘ precious raw ’
73467	73471	73457	73457	he	75	‘ precious deep , ’

73567	73581	73564	73565	Mr Witherden	137	‘ you came to work out that shilling;--not to get another , hey ? ’
73582	73588	73590	73590	Kit	75	‘ No indeed , sir , ’
73598	73607	73590	73590	Kit	75	‘ I never thought of such a thing . ’
73608	73612	73614	73615	the Notary	1334	‘ Father alive ? ’
73617	73622	73614	73615	the Notary	1334	‘ Dead , sir . ’

73627	73632	73590	73590	Kit	75	‘ Yes , sir . ’
73633	73639	73640	73640	Kit	75	‘ Married again -- eh ? ’
73716	73719	73721	73722	Mr Garland	138	‘ Now , ’
73733	73742	73721	73722	Mr Garland	138	‘ I am not going to give you anything-- ’
73743	73749	73750	73750	Kit	75	‘ Thank you , sir , ’
73774	73777	73779	73781	the old gentleman	808	‘ --But , ’
73783	73814	73815	73815	Kit	75	‘ perhaps I may want to know something more about you , so tell me where you live , and I ’ll put it down in my pocket - book . ’
73904	73913	73885	73885	his	139	‘ Stand still,’--‘Be quiet,’--‘Woa - a - a , ’
74469	74481	74483	74484	Mr Garland	138	‘ We are here before you , you see , Christopher , ’
74487	74492	74494	74494	Kit	75	‘ Yes , sir , ’
74514	74525	74527	74527	she	479	‘ The gentleman ’s been kind enough , my dear , ’
74536	74576	74527	74527	she	479	‘ to ask me whether you were in a good place , or in any place at all , and when I told him no , you were not in any , he was so good as to say that-- ’
74577	74588	74590	74592	the old gentleman	808	‘ --That we wanted a good lad in our house , ’
74600	74622	74590	74592	the old gentleman	808	‘ and that perhaps we might think of it , if we found everything as we would wish it to be . ’
74682	74690	74692	74693	Mrs Garland	161	‘ You see , my good woman , ’
74699	74719	74692	74693	Mrs Garland	161	‘ that it ’s necessary to be very careful and particular in such a matter as this , for we ’re
74758	75124	75129	75129	mother	6118	’ To this , Kit ’s mother replied , that certainly it was quite true , and quite right , and quite proper , and Heaven forbid that she should shrink , or have cause to shrink , from any inquiry into her character or that of her son , who was a very good son though she was his mother , in which respect , she was bold to say , he took after his father , who was not only a good son to HIS mother , but the best of husbands and the best of fathers besides , which Kit could and would corroborate she knew , and so would little Jacob and the baby likewise if they were old enough , which unfortunately they were not , though as they did n’t know what a loss they had had , perhaps it was a great deal better that they should be as young as they were ; and so Kit ’s mother wound up a long story by wiping her eyes with her apron , and patting little Jacob ’s head , who was rocking the cradle and staring with all his might at the strange lady and gentleman . When Kit ’s mother had done speaking , the old lady struck in again , and said that she was quite sure she was a very honest and very respectable person or she never would have expressed herself in that manner , and that certainly the appearance of the children and the cleanliness of the house deserved great praise and did her the utmost credit , whereat Kit ’s mother dropped a curtsey and became consoled . Then the good woman entered in a long and minute account of Kit ’s life and history from the earliest period down to that time , not omitting to make mention of his miraculous fall out of a back - parlour window when an infant of tender years , or his uncommon sufferings in a state of measles , which were illustrated by correct imitations of the plaintive manner in which he called for toast and water , day and night , and said , ‘
75137	75485	75488	75488	mother	6118	’ for proof of which statements reference was made to Mrs Green , lodger , at the cheesemonger ’s round the corner , and divers other ladies and gentlemen in various parts of England and Wales ( and one Mr Brown who was supposed to be then a corporal in the East Indies , and who could of course be found with very little trouble ) , within whose personal knowledge the circumstances had occurred . This narration ended , Mr Garland put some questions to Kit respecting his qualifications and general acquirements , while Mrs Garland noticed the children , and hearing from Kit ’s mother certain remarkable circumstances which had attended the birth of each , related certain other remarkable circumstances which had attended the birth of her own son , Mr Abel , from which it appeared that both Kit ’s mother and herself had been , above and beyond all other women of what condition or age soever , peculiarly hemmed in with perils and dangers . Lastly , inquiry was made into the nature and extent of Kit ’s wardrobe , and a small advance being made to improve the same , he was formally hired at an annual income of Six Pounds , over and above his board and lodging , by Mr and Mrs Garland , of Abel Cottage , Finchley . It would be difficult to say which party appeared most pleased with this arrangement , the conclusion of which was hailed with nothing but pleasant looks and cheerful smiles on both sides . It was settled that Kit should repair to his new abode on the next day but one , in the morning ; and finally , the little old couple , after bestowing a bright half - crown on little Jacob and another on the baby , took their leaves ; being escorted as far as the street by their new attendant , who held the obdurate pony by the bridle while they took their seats , and saw them drive away with a lightened heart . ‘
75490	75500	75488	75488	mother	6118	’ said Kit , hurrying back into the house , ‘
75510	75511	75501	75501	I	0	’ ‘
75521	75526	75519	75519	Kit	75	’ rejoined his mother . ‘
75535	75536	75519	75519	Kit	75	’ ‘
75539	75566	75519	75519	Kit	75	’ said Kit , trying to maintain the gravity which the consideration of such a sum demanded , but grinning with delight in spite of himself . ‘
75572	75626	75519	75519	Kit	75	’ Kit drew a long breath when he had said this , and putting his hands deep into his pockets as if there were one year ’s wages at least in each , looked at his mother , as though he saw through her , and down an immense perspective of sovereigns beyond . ‘
75669	75670	75671	75671	Hem	119	’ ‘
75673	75679	75671	75671	Hem	119	’ croaked a strange voice . ‘
75696	75716	75738	75740	the old man	384	’ And as the voice made this inquiry , Daniel Quilp walked in with Richard Swiveller at his heels . ‘
75728	75736	75738	75740	the old man	384	’ said Quilp , looking sharply round . ‘
75767	75873	75738	75740	the old man	384	’ The good woman was so much alarmed by the sudden apparition of this unknown piece of ugliness , that she hastily caught the baby from its cradle and retreated into the furthest corner of the room ; while little Jacob , sitting upon his stool with his hands on his knees , looked full at him in a species of fascination , roaring lustily all the time . Richard Swiveller took an easy observation of the family over Mr Quilp ’s head , and Quilp himself , with his hands in his pockets , smiled in an exquisite enjoyment of the commotion he occasioned . ‘
75881	75889	75879	75879	mistress	1913	’ said Quilp , after a pause . ‘
75905	75941	75901	75901	I	0	‘ em . It will be as well to stop that young screamer though , in case I should be tempted to do him a mischief . Holloa , sir ! Will you be quiet ? ’
75967	75979	75981	75981	Quilp	84	‘ Mind you do n’t break out again , you villain , ’
75988	76020	75981	75981	Quilp	84	‘ or I ’ll make faces at you and throw you into fits , I will . Now you sir , why have n’t you been to me as you promised ? ’
76021	76028	76030	76030	Kit	75	‘ What should I come for ? ’
76032	76049	76030	76030	Kit	75	‘ I had n’t any business with you , no more than you had with me . ’
76050	76055	76057	76057	Quilp	84	‘ Here , mistress , ’
76071	76096	76057	76057	Quilp	84	‘ When did his old master come or send here last ? Is he here now ? If not , where ’s he gone ? ’
76097	76106	76107	76107	she	479	‘ He has not been here at all , ’
76110	76140	76107	76107	she	479	‘ I wish we knew where they have gone , for it would make my son a good deal easier in his mind , and me too . If you ’re
76166	76167	76158	76158	I	0	’ ‘
76170	76183	76158	76158	I	0	’ muttered Quilp , evidently disappointed to believe that this was true . ‘
76196	76197	76187	76187	you	479	’ ‘
76230	76272	76222	76222	I	0	’ was the reply . Quilp glanced at Richard Swiveller , and observed that having met him on the threshold , he assumed that he had come in search of some intelligence of the fugitives . He supposed he was right ? ‘
76275	76279	76222	76222	I	0	’ said Dick , ‘
76308	76309	76303	76303	I	0	’ ‘
76314	76318	76319	76320	A baffler	1922	’ observed Quilp . ‘
76331	76335	76322	76322	Sir	5863	’ returned Dick . ‘
76372	76483	76370	76370	sir	5863	’ The dwarf eyed Richard with a sarcastic smile , but Richard , who had been taking a rather strong lunch with a friend , observed him not , and continued to deplore his fate with mournful and despondent looks . Quilp plainly discerned that there was some secret reason for this visit and his uncommon disappointment , and , in the hope that there might be means of mischief lurking beneath it , resolved to worm it out . He had no sooner adopted this resolution , than he conveyed as much honesty into his face as it was capable of expressing , and sympathised with Mr Swiveller exceedingly . ‘
76489	76493	76487	76487	myself	0	’ said Quilp , ‘
76527	76528	76503	76503	you	1929	’ ‘
76536	76542	76544	76544	my	0	’ Dick observed , testily . ‘
76548	76556	76544	76544	my	0	’m very sorry , very sorry . I ’m
76597	76621	76582	76582	you	1929	’ urged Quilp , plucking him by the sleeve and looking slyly up into his face out of the corners of his eyes , ‘
76743	77165	76738	76739	Mr Swiveller	78	’ As the dwarf spoke , Dick ’s face relaxed into a compliant smile , and his brows slowly unbent . By the time he had finished , Dick was looking down at Quilp in the same sly manner as Quilp was looking up at him , and there remained nothing more to be done but to set out for the house in question . This they did , straightway . The moment their backs were turned , little Jacob thawed , and resumed his crying from the point where Quilp had frozen him . The summer - house of which Mr Quilp had spoken was a rugged wooden box , rotten and bare to see , which overhung the river ’s mud , and threatened to slide down into it . The tavern to which it belonged was a crazy building , sapped and undermined by the rats , and only upheld by great bars of wood which were reared against its walls , and had propped it up so long that even they were decaying and yielding with their load , and of a windy night might be heard to creak and crack as if the whole fabric were about to come toppling down . The house stood -- if anything so old and feeble could be said to stand -- on a piece of waste ground , blighted with the unwholesome smoke of factory chimneys , and echoing the clank of iron wheels and rush of troubled water . Its internal accommodations amply fulfilled the promise of the outside . The rooms were low and damp , the clammy walls were pierced with chinks and holes , the rotten floors had sunk from their level , the very beams started from their places and warned the timid stranger from their neighbourhood . To this inviting spot , entreating him to observe its beauties as they passed along , Mr Quilp led Richard Swiveller , and on the table of the summer - house , scored deep with many a gallows and initial letter , there soon appeared a wooden keg , full of the vaunted liquor . Drawing it off into the glasses with the skill of a practised hand , and mixing it with about a third part of water , Mr Quilp assigned to Richard Swiveller his portion , and lighting his pipe from an end of a candle in a very old and battered lantern , drew himself together upon a seat and puffed away . ‘
77170	77181	76738	76739	Mr Swiveller	78	’ said Quilp , as Richard Swiveller smacked his lips , ‘
77211	77212	77242	77242	you	665	’ ‘
77216	77237	77242	77242	you	665	’ cried Dick , throwing away part of the contents of his glass , and filling it up with water , ‘
77257	77258	77242	77242	you	665	’ ‘
77261	77265	77242	77242	you	665	’ rejoined Quilp , ‘
77284	77349	77242	77242	you	665	’ As he spoke , Daniel Quilp drew off and drank three small glassfuls of the raw spirit , and then with a horrible grimace took a great many pulls at his pipe , and swallowing the smoke , discharged it in a heavy cloud from his nose . This feat accomplished he drew himself together in his former position , and laughed excessively . ‘
77355	77380	77381	77382	a woman	520	’ cried Quilp , rattling on the table in a dexterous manner with his fist and elbow alternately , in a kind of tune , ‘
77409	77410	77404	77404	Her	520	’ ‘
77417	77421	77412	77412	you	665	’ said Dick , ‘
77427	77428	77424	77425	Sophy Wackles	106	’ ‘
77432	77437	77429	77430	Sophy Wackles	106	’ screamed the dwarf , ‘
77459	77460	77429	77430	Sophy Wackles	106	’ ‘
77463	77467	77429	77430	Sophy Wackles	106	’ said Dick , ‘
77495	77496	77489	77489	herself	1945	’ ‘
77506	77510	77511	77511	I	0	’ rejoined Quilp . ‘
77571	77572	77568	77569	the dregs	1952	’ ‘
77575	77611	77612	77612	you	1953	’ said Richard Swiveller , stopping short in the act of raising the glass to his lips and looking at the dwarf in a species of stupor as he flourished his arms and legs about : ‘
77613	77648	77568	77569	the dregs	1952	’re a jolly fellow , but of all the jolly fellows I ever saw or heard of , you have the queerest and most extraordinary way with you , upon my life you have . ’
77773	77776	77778	77778	Quilp	84	‘ Stop ! ’
77780	77818	77778	77778	Quilp	84	‘ That ’s the thing , that ’s the thing . It can be brought about , it shall be brought about . There ’s my hand upon it ; I am your friend from this minute . ’
77819	77831	77833	77833	Dick	77	‘ What ! do you think there ’s still a chance ? ’
77841	77845	77847	77848	the dwarf	6020	‘ A chance ! ’
77850	77885	77886	77888	a made man	1956	‘ a certainty ! Sophy Wackles may become a Cheggs or anything else she likes , but not a Swiveller . Oh you lucky dog ! He ’s richer than any Jew alive ; you ’re

77931	77935	77918	77918	my	0	’ said Dick . ‘
77942	77947	77918	77918	my	0	’ rejoined the dwarf , ‘
77973	77984	77972	77972	I	0	’m gone . I shall be back directly -- directly . ’
78020	78025	78026	78026	he	84	‘ Here ’s sport ! ’
78029	78157	78158	78158	em	1961	‘ sport ready to my hand , all invented and arranged , and only to be enjoyed . It was this shallow - pated fellow who made my bones ache t’other day , was it ? It was his friend and fellow - plotter , Mr Trent , that once made eyes at Mrs Quilp , and leered and looked , was it ? After labouring for two or three years in their precious scheme , to find that they ’ve got a beggar at last , and one of them tied for life . Ha ha ha ! He shall marry Nell . He shall have her , and I ’ll be the first man , when the knot ’s tied hard and fast , to tell ‘
78168	78188	78189	78189	em	1961	‘ em to . Here will be a clearing of old scores , here will be a time to remind ‘
78210	78311	78315	78315	you	0	’ In the height of his ecstasy , Mr Quilp had like to have met with a disagreeable check , for rolling very near a broken dog - kennel , there leapt forth a large fierce dog , who , but that his chain was of the shortest , would have given him a disagreeable salute . As it was , the dwarf remained upon his back in perfect safety , taunting the dog with hideous faces , and triumphing over him in his inability to advance another inch , though there were not a couple of feet between them . ‘
78335	78350	78324	78324	you	0	’ said Quilp , hissing and worrying the animal till he was nearly mad . ‘
78352	78359	78324	78324	you	0	’re afraid , you bully , you ’re
78367	78712	78713	78713	I	0	’ The dog tore and strained at his chain with starting eyes and furious bark , but there the dwarf lay , snapping his fingers with gestures of defiance and contempt . When he had sufficiently recovered from his delight , he rose , and with his arms a - kimbo , achieved a kind of demon - dance round the kennel , just without the limits of the chain , driving the dog quite wild . Having by this means composed his spirits and put himself in a pleasant train , he returned to his unsuspicious companion , whom he found looking at the tide with exceeding gravity , and thinking of that same gold and silver which Mr Quilp had mentioned . CHAPTER 22 The remainder of that day and the whole of the next were a busy time for the Nubbles family , to whom everything connected with Kit ’s outfit and departure was matter of as great moment as if he had been about to penetrate into the interior of Africa , or to take a cruise round the world . It would be difficult to suppose that there ever was a box which was opened and shut so many times within four - and - twenty hours , as that which contained his wardrobe and necessaries ; and certainly there never was one which to two small eyes presented such a mine of clothing , as this mighty chest with its three shirts and proportionate allowance of stockings and pocket - handkerchiefs , disclosed to the astonished vision of little Jacob . At last it was conveyed to the carrier ’s , at whose house at Finchley Kit was to find it next day ; and the box being gone , there remained but two questions for consideration : firstly , whether the carrier would lose , or dishonestly feign to lose , the box upon the road ; secondly , whether Kit ’s mother perfectly understood how to take care of herself in the absence of her son . ‘
78743	78756	78736	78736	they	1965	’ said Mrs Nubbles apprehensively , in reference to the first point . ‘
78762	78771	78736	78736	they	1965	’ returned Kit , with a serious look ; ‘
78800	78803	78799	78799	I	0	’m afraid . ’
78804	78812	78814	78815	his mother	479	‘ We ca n’t help it now , ’
78817	78832	78814	78815	his mother	479	‘ but it was foolish and wrong . People ought n’t to be tempted . ’
78868	78888	78859	78859	he	75	‘ _ You _ know you must keep up your spirits , mother , and not be lonesome because I ’m

78980	78992	78977	78978	Mrs Nubbles	123	‘ I know who has been putting that in your head , ’
78998	79105	78977	78978	Mrs Nubbles	123	‘ that ’s Little Bethel again . Now I say , mother , pray do n’t take to going there regularly , for if I was to see your good - humoured face that has always made home cheerful , turned into a grievous one , and the baby trained to look grievous too , and to call itself a young sinner ( bless its heart ) and a child of the devil ( which is calling its dead father names ) ; if I was to see this , and see little Jacob looking grievous likewise , I should so take it to heart that I ’m

Ha ha ha ! An’t that as nat’ral as walking , and as good for the health ? Ha ha ha ! An’t that as nat’ral as a sheep ’s bleating , or a pig ’s grunting , or a horse ’s neighing , or a bird ’s singing ? Ha ha ha ! Is n’t it , mother ? ’
80134	80212	80213	80213	I	0	’ castles , and princesses tied up to pegs by the hair of their heads , and dragons bursting out from behind gates , and other incidents of the like nature , common in story - books to youths of low degree on their first visit to strange houses , the door was gently opened , and a little servant - girl , very tidy , modest , and demure , but very pretty too , appeared . ‘
80216	80221	80223	80226	the servant - girl	2007	’re Christopher , sir , ’
80241	80243	80238	80238	he	75	‘ I ’m
80254	80258	80245	80245	you	75	’ she rejoined , ‘
80274	81217	80238	80238	he	75	’ Kit rather wondered what this meant , but as he could n’t stop there , asking questions , he shouldered the box again and followed the girl into the hall , where through a back - door he descried Mr Garland leading Whisker in triumph up the garden , after that self - willed pony had ( as he afterwards learned ) dodged the family round a small paddock in the rear , for one hour and three quarters . The old gentleman received him very kindly and so did the old lady , whose previous good opinion of him was greatly enhanced by his wiping his boots on the mat until the soles of his feet burnt again . He was then taken into the parlour to be inspected in his new clothes ; and when he had been surveyed several times , and had afforded by his appearance unlimited satisfaction , he was taken into the stable ( where the pony received him with uncommon complaisance ) ; and thence into the little chamber he had already observed , which was very clean and comfortable : and thence into the garden , in which the old gentleman told him he would be taught to employ himself , and where he told him , besides , what great things he meant to do to make him comfortable , and happy , if he found he deserved it . All these kindnesses , Kit acknowledged with various expressions of gratitude , and so many touches of the new hat , that the brim suffered considerably . When the old gentleman had said all he had to say in the way of promise and advice , and Kit had said all he had to say in the way of assurance and thankfulness , he was handed over again to the old lady , who , summoning the little servant - girl ( whose name was Barbara ) instructed her to take him down stairs and give him something to eat and drink , after his walk . Down stairs , therefore , Kit went ; and at the bottom of the stairs there was such a kitchen as was never before seen or heard of out of a toy - shop window , with everything in it as bright and glowing , and as precisely ordered too , as Barbara herself . And in this kitchen , Kit sat himself down at a table as white as a tablecloth , to eat cold meat , and drink small ale , and use his knife and fork the more awkwardly , because there was an unknown Barbara looking on and observing him . It did not appear , however , that there was anything remarkably tremendous about this strange Barbara , who having lived a very quiet life , blushed very much and was quite as embarrassed and uncertain what she ought to say or do , as Kit could possibly be . When he had sat for some little time , attentive to the ticking of the sober clock , he ventured to glance curiously at the dresser , and there , among the plates and dishes , were Barbara ’s little work - box with a sliding lid to shut in the balls of cotton , and Barbara ’s prayer - book , and Barbara ’s hymn - book , and Barbara ’s Bible . Barbara ’s little looking - glass hung in a good light near the window , and Barbara ’s bonnet was on a nail behind the door . From all these mute signs and tokens of her presence , he naturally glanced at Barbara herself , who sat as mute as they , shelling peas into a dish ; and just when Kit was looking at her eyelashes and wondering -- quite in the simplicity of his heart -- what colour her eyes might be , it perversely happened that Barbara raised her head a little to look at him , when both pair of eyes were hastily withdrawn , and Kit leant over his plate , and Barbara over her pea - shells , each in extreme confusion at having been detected by the other . CHAPTER 23 Mr Richard Swiveller wending homeward from the Wilderness ( for such was the appropriate name of Quilp ’s choice retreat ) , after a sinuous and corkscrew fashion , with many checks and stumbles ; after stopping suddenly and staring about him , then as suddenly running forward for a few paces , and as suddenly halting again and shaking his head ; doing everything with a jerk and nothing by premeditation;--Mr Richard Swiveller wending his way homeward after this fashion , which is considered by evil - minded men to be symbolical of intoxication , and is not held by such persons to denote that state of deep wisdom and reflection in which the actor knows himself to be , began to think that possibly he had misplaced his confidence and that the dwarf might not be precisely the sort of person to whom to entrust a secret of such delicacy and importance . And being led and tempted on by this remorseful thought into a condition which the evil - minded class before referred to would term the maudlin state or stage of drunkenness , it occurred to Mr Swiveller to cast his hat upon the ground , and moan , crying aloud that he was an unhappy orphan , and that if he had not been an unhappy orphan things had never come to this . ‘
81230	81240	81296	81298	a miserable orphan	2015	’ said Mr Swiveller , bewailing his hard lot , ‘
81277	81294	81296	81298	a miserable orphan	2015	’ said Mr Swiveller raising his voice to a high pitch , and looking sleepily round , ‘
81300	81301	81296	81298	a miserable orphan	2015	’ ‘
81304	81310	81296	81298	a miserable orphan	2015	’ said somebody hard by , ‘
81319	81453	81296	81298	a miserable orphan	2015	’ Mr Swiveller swayed himself to and fro to preserve his balance , and , looking into a kind of haze which seemed to surround him , at last perceived two eyes dimly twinkling through the mist , which he observed after a short time were in the neighbourhood of a nose and mouth . Casting his eyes down towards that quarter in which , with reference to a man ’s face , his legs are usually to be found , he observed that the face had a body attached ; and when he looked more intently he was satisfied that the person was Mr Quilp , who indeed had been in his company all the time , but whom he had some vague idea of having left a mile or two behind . ‘
81462	81468	81460	81460	Sir	5863	’ said Mr Swiveller solemnly . ’
81469	81473	81296	81298	a miserable orphan	2015	‘ I ! I ’m
81480	81484	81296	81298	a miserable orphan	2015	’ replied Quilp . ‘
81491	81495	81489	81489	Sir	5863	’ retorted Dick . ‘
81514	81515	81512	81512	Sir	5863	’ ‘
81523	81527	81530	81530	Sir	5863	’ cried Quilp . ‘
81532	81545	81530	81530	Sir	5863	’ returned Dick , leaning against a post and waving his hand . ‘
81581	81729	81730	81730	I	0	’ The dwarf taking no heed of this adjuration , Mr Swiveller advanced with the view of inflicting upon him condign chastisement . But forgetting his purpose or changing his mind before he came close to him , he seized his hand and vowed eternal friendship , declaring with an agreeable frankness that from that time forth they were brothers in everything but personal appearance . Then he told his secret over again , with the addition of being pathetic on the subject of Miss Wackles , who , he gave Mr Quilp to understand , was the occasion of any slight incoherency he might observe in his speech at that moment , which was attributable solely to the strength of his affection and not to rosy wine or other fermented liquor . And then they went on arm - in - arm , very lovingly together . ‘
81731	81735	81737	81737	Quilp	84	’m as sharp , ’
81744	81768	81769	81770	his friend	5985	‘ as sharp as a ferret , and as cunning as a weazel . You bring Trent to me ; assure him that I ’m

81815	81819	81798	81798	you	2031	’ returned Dick . ‘

81846	81854	81855	81855	You	2031	’ said Quilp , pressing his arm . ‘

81882	81886	81878	81878	D’ye	2032	’ said Dick . ‘
81905	81910	81898	81898	I	0	’ returned the dwarf . ‘
81932	81933	81918	81918	him	102	’ ‘
81945	81949	81939	81939	you	2031	’ replied Dick , ‘

81995	82002	82004	82004	Quilp	84	‘ I not a choice spirit ? ’
82006	82013	82015	82015	Dick	77	‘ Devil a bit , sir , ’
82017	82029	82015	82015	Dick	77	‘ A man of your appearance could n’t be . If you ’re
82038	82046	82048	82048	Dick	77	’re an evil spirit . Choice spirits , ’
82056	82076	82048	82048	Dick	77	‘ are quite a different looking sort of people , you may take your oath of that , sir . ’
82266	82275	82277	82279	the penitent Richard	2046	‘ I do n’t defend myself , Fred , ’
82281	82364	82277	82279	the penitent Richard	2046	‘ but the fellow has such a queer way with him and is such an artful dog , that first of all he set me upon thinking whether there was any harm in telling him , and while I was thinking , screwed it out of me . If you had seen him drink and smoke , as I did , you could n’t have kept anything from him . He ’s a Salamander you know , that ’s what he is . ’
82998	83005	83007	83007	Quilp	84	‘ Why , let me see , ’
83009	83025	83007	83007	Quilp	84	‘ It must be a matter of nearly two years since we were first acquainted . ’
83026	83033	83035	83035	Trent	132	‘ Nearer three , I think , ’
83037	83041	83043	83043	Quilp	84	‘ Nearer three ! ’
83045	83064	83043	83043	Quilp	84	‘ How fast time flies . Does it seem as long as that to you , Mrs Quilp ? ’
83065	83078	83007	83007	Quilp	84	‘ Yes , I think it seems full three years , Quilp , ’
83084	83090	83092	83092	Quilp	83	‘ Oh indeed , ma’am , ’
83094	83108	83092	83092	Quilp	83	‘ you have been pining , have you ? Very good , ma’am . ’
83109	83127	83129	83129	Quilp	83	‘ It seems to me but yesterday that you went out to Demerara in the Mary Anne , ’
83131	83152	83129	83129	Quilp	83	‘ but yesterday , I declare . Well , I like a little wildness . I was wild myself once . ’
83223	83239	83241	83241	Quilp	84	‘ I thought you ’d come back directly , Fred . I always thought that , ’
83247	83298	83241	83241	Quilp	84	‘ And when the Mary Anne returned with you on board , instead of a letter to say what a contrite heart you had , and how happy you were in the situation that had been provided for you , I was amused -- exceedingly amused . Ha ha ha ! ’
83332	83338	83339	83339	he	84	‘ I always will say , ’
83342	83382	83339	83339	he	84	‘ that when a rich relation having two young people -- sisters or brothers , or brother and sister -- dependent on him , attaches himself exclusively to one , and casts off the other , he does wrong . ’
83416	83422	83424	83424	Quilp	84	‘ It ’s very true , ’
83426	83505	83424	83424	Quilp	84	‘ that your grandfather urged repeated forgiveness , ingratitude , riot , and extravagance , and all that ; but as I told him “ these are common faults . ” “ But he ’s a scoundrel , ” said he . “ Granting that , ” said I ( for the sake of argument of course ) , “ a great many young noblemen and gentlemen are scoundrels too ! ” But he would n’t be convinced . ’
83506	83515	83517	83519	the young man	5991	‘ I wonder at that , Mr Quilp , ’
83522	83532	83517	83519	the young man	5991	‘ Well , so did I at the time , ’
83536	83576	83534	83534	Quilp	84	‘ but he was always obstinate . He was in a manner a friend of mine , but he was always obstinate and wrong - headed . Little Nell is a nice girl , a charming girl , but you ’re

83660	83744	83658	83658	Quilp	84	‘ agreed on my part readily . Why have I alluded to it ? Just to show you , Frederick , that I have always stood your friend . You little knew who was your friend , and who your foe ; now did you ? You thought I was against you , and so there has been a coolness between us ; but it was all on your side , entirely on your side . Let ’s shake hands again , Fred . ’
84524	84542	84544	84544	Quilp	84	‘ It ’s as well not to say more than one can help before our worthy friend , ’

84674	84681	84683	84683	Quilp	84	‘ It ’s done , Fred , ’

84903	84918	84900	84901	the dwarf	6020	‘ Which is more extraordinary , as I know how rich he really is . ’
84919	84925	84927	84927	Trent	132	‘ I suppose you should , ’
84929	84936	84938	84939	the dwarf	6020	‘ I think I should indeed , ’
85612	85629	85630	85630	she	324	‘ We are quite safe now , and have nothing to fear indeed , dear grandfather , ’
85633	85638	85630	85630	she	324	‘ Nothing to fear ! ’
85644	85678	85630	85630	she	324	‘ Nothing to fear if they took me from thee ! Nothing to fear if they parted us ! Nobody is true to me . No , not one . Not even Nell ! ’
85679	85687	85689	85690	the child	324	‘ Oh ! do not say that , ’
85692	85716	85689	85690	the child	324	‘ for if ever anybody was true at heart , and earnest , I am . I am sure you know I am . ’
85717	85721	85723	85725	the old man	384	‘ Then how , ’
85731	85764	85723	85725	the old man	384	‘ how can you bear to think that we are safe , when they are searching for me everywhere , and may come here , and steal upon us , even while we ’re
85767	85768	85723	85725	the old man	384	’ ‘
85771	85779	85781	85782	the child	324	’m sure we have not been followed , ’
85784	85836	85781	85782	the child	324	‘ Judge for yourself , dear grandfather : look round , and see how quiet and still it is . We are alone together , and may ramble where we like . Not safe ! Could I feel easy -- did I feel at ease -- when any danger threatened you ? ’
85837	85842	85843	85843	he	384	‘ True , too , ’
85856	85862	85843	85843	he	384	‘ What noise was that ? ’
85863	85867	85869	85870	the child	324	‘ A bird , ’
85872	85887	85869	85870	the child	324	‘ flying into the wood , and leading the way for us to follow . ’
85977	86404	85964	85964	he	2141	’ When they rose up from the ground , and took the shady track which led them through the wood , she bounded on before , printing her tiny footsteps in the moss , which rose elastic from so light a pressure and gave it back as mirrors throw off breath ; and thus she lured the old man on , with many a backward look and merry beck , now pointing stealthily to some lone bird as it perched and twittered on a branch that strayed across their path , now stopping to listen to the songs that broke the happy silence , or watch the sun as it trembled through the leaves , and stealing in among the ivied trunks of stout old trees , opened long paths of light . As they passed onward , parting the boughs that clustered in their way , the serenity which the child had first assumed , stole into her breast in earnest ; the old man cast no longer fearful looks behind , but felt at ease and cheerful , for the further they passed into the deep green shade , the more they felt that the tranquil mind of God was there , and shed its peace on them . At length the path becoming clearer and less intricate , brought them to the end of the wood , and into a public road . Taking their way along it for a short distance , they came to a lane , so shaded by the trees on either hand that they met together over - head , and arched the narrow way . A broken finger - post announced that this led to a village three miles off ; and thither they resolved to bend their steps . The miles appeared so long that they sometimes thought they must have missed their road . But at last , to their great joy , it led downwards in a steep descent , with overhanging banks over which the footpaths led ; and the clustered houses of the village peeped from the woody hollow below . It was a very small place . The men and boys were playing at cricket on the green ; and as the other folks were looking on , they wandered up and down , uncertain where to seek a humble lodging . There was but one old man in the little garden before his cottage , and him they were timid of approaching , for he was the schoolmaster , and had ‘
86406	86457	86462	86462	dear	6657	’ written up over his window in black letters on a white board . He was a pale , simple - looking man , of a spare and meagre habit , and sat among his flowers and beehives , smoking his pipe , in the little porch before his door . ‘
86464	86470	86462	86462	dear	6657	’ the old man whispered . ‘
86479	86485	86471	86471	I	0	’ said the child timidly . ‘
86507	86827	86501	86501	he	2142	’ They waited , but the schoolmaster cast no look towards them , and still sat , thoughtful and silent , in the little porch . He had a kind face . In his plain old suit of black , he looked pale and meagre . They fancied , too , a lonely air about him and his house , but perhaps that was because the other people formed a merry company upon the green , and he seemed the only solitary man in all the place . They were very tired , and the child would have been bold enough to address even a schoolmaster , but for something in his manner which seemed to denote that he was uneasy or distressed . As they stood hesitating at a little distance , they saw that he sat for a few minutes at a time like one in a brown study , then laid aside his pipe and took a few turns in his garden , then approached the gate and looked towards the green , then took up his pipe again with a sigh , and sat down thoughtfully as before . As nobody else appeared and it would soon be dark , Nell at length took courage , and when he had resumed his pipe and seat , ventured to draw near , leading her grandfather by the hand . The slight noise they made in raising the latch of the wicket - gate , caught his attention . He looked at them kindly but seemed disappointed too , and slightly shook his head . Nell dropped a curtsey , and told him they were poor travellers who sought a shelter for the night which they would gladly pay for , so far as their means allowed . The schoolmaster looked earnestly at her as she spoke , laid aside his pipe , and rose up directly . ‘
86837	86842	86829	86829	you	2145	’ said the child , ‘
86850	86851	86829	86829	you	2145	’ ‘
86860	86865	86852	86852	You	2148	’ said the schoolmaster . ‘
86872	86877	86878	86878	You	2148	’ the child replied . ‘
86879	86887	86888	86888	he	5863	’re a young traveller , my child , ’
86899	86905	86888	86888	he	5863	‘ Your grandchild , friend ? ’
86906	86911	86913	86915	the old man	384	‘ Aye , Sir , ’
86917	86927	86913	86915	the old man	384	‘ and the stay and comfort of my life . ’
86928	86932	86934	86935	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ Come in , ’
87229	87232	87234	87236	the old schoolmaster	2164	‘ Yes , ’
87249	87258	87234	87236	the old schoolmaster	2164	‘ That ’s beautiful writing , my dear . ’
87259	87264	87266	87267	the child	324	‘ Very , Sir , ’
87270	87275	87266	87267	the child	324	‘ is it yours ? ’
87276	87279	87280	87280	he	2164	‘ Mine ! ’
87306	87323	87234	87236	the old schoolmaster	2164	‘ I could n’t write like that , now - a - days . No . They ’re
87348	87440	87469	87469	he	2164	’ As the schoolmaster said this , he saw that a small blot of ink had been thrown on one of the copies , so he took a penknife from his pocket , and going up to the wall , carefully scraped it out . When he had finished , he walked slowly backward from the writing , admiring it as one might contemplate a beautiful picture , but with something of sadness in his voice and manner which quite touched the child , though she was unacquainted with its cause . ‘
87446	87452	87469	87469	he	2164	’ said the poor schoolmaster . ‘
87494	87517	87518	87518	I	0	’ and there the schoolmaster stopped , and took off his spectacles to wipe them , as though they had grown dim . ‘
87528	87533	87518	87518	I	0	’ said Nell anxiously . ‘
87540	87545	87518	87518	I	0	’ returned the schoolmaster . ‘
87575	87576	87567	87567	he	2164	’ ‘
87582	87594	87567	87567	he	2164	’ asked the child , with a child ’s quick sympathy . ‘
87644	87673	87675	87675	he	2164	’ The child was silent . He walked to the door , and looked wistfully out . The shadows of night were gathering , and all was still . ‘
87692	87701	87683	87683	he	2164	’ he said , returning into the room . ‘
87760	87929	87930	87932	My favourite scholar	2175	’ The schoolmaster lighted a candle , fastened the window - shutter , and closed the door . But after he had done this , and sat silent a little time , he took down his hat , and said he would go and satisfy himself , if Nell would sit up till he returned . The child readily complied , and he went out . She sat there half - an - hour or more , feeling the place very strange and lonely , for she had prevailed upon the old man to go to bed , and there was nothing to be heard but the ticking of an old clock , and the whistling of the wind among the trees . When he returned , he took his seat in the chimney corner , but remained silent for a long time . At length he turned to her , and speaking very gently , hoped she would say a prayer that night for a sick child . ‘
87934	87957	87930	87932	My favourite scholar	2175	’ said the poor schoolmaster , smoking a pipe he had forgotten to light , and looking mournfully round upon the walls . ‘
87984	88130	88146	88146	They	2176	’ CHAPTER 25 After a sound night ’s rest in a chamber in the thatched roof , in which it seemed the sexton had for some years been a lodger , but which he had lately deserted for a wife and a cottage of his own , the child rose early in the morning and descended to the room where she had supped last night . As the schoolmaster had already left his bed and gone out , she bestirred herself to make it neat and comfortable , and had just finished its arrangement when the kind host returned . He thanked her many times , and said that the old dame who usually did such offices for him had gone to nurse the little scholar whom he had told her of . The child asked how he was , and hoped he was better . ‘
88133	88142	88146	88146	They	2176	’ rejoined the schoolmaster shaking his head sorrowfully , ‘
88153	88154	88146	88146	They	2176	’ ‘
88164	88208	88210	88210	my	0	’ said the child . The poor schoolmaster appeared to be gratified by her earnest manner , but yet rendered more uneasy by it , for he added hastily that anxious people often magnified an evil and thought it greater than it was ; ‘
88213	88224	88210	88210	my	0	’ he said , in his quiet , patient way , ‘
88241	88292	88232	88232	I	0	’ The child asked his leave to prepare breakfast , and her grandfather coming down stairs , they all three partook of it together . While the meal was in progress , their host remarked that the old man seemed much fatigued , and evidently stood in need of rest . ‘
88305	88309	88319	88319	you	2179	’ he said , ‘
88320	88340	88319	88319	you	2179	’re very welcome to pass another night here . I should really be glad if you would , friend . ’
88363	88428	88344	88346	the old man	384	‘ I shall be glad to have your young companion with me for one day . If you can do a charity to a lone man , and rest yourself at the same time , do so . If you must proceed upon your journey , I wish you well through it , and will walk a little way with you before school begins . ’
88429	88438	88440	88442	the old man	384	‘ What are we to do , Nell ? ’
88445	88449	88344	88346	the old man	384	‘ say what we ’re
88455	88659	88440	88442	the old man	384	’ It required no great persuasion to induce the child to answer that they had better accept the invitation and remain . She was happy to show her gratitude to the kind schoolmaster by busying herself in the performance of such household duties as his little cottage stood in need of . When these were done , she took some needle - work from her basket , and sat herself down upon a stool beside the lattice , where the honeysuckle and woodbine entwined their tender stems , and stealing into the room filled it with their delicious breath . Her grandfather was basking in the sun outside , breathing the perfume of the flowers , and idly watching the clouds as they floated on before the light summer wind . As the schoolmaster , after arranging the two forms in due order , took his seat behind his desk and made other preparations for school , the child was apprehensive that she might be in the way , and offered to withdraw to her little bedroom . But this he would not allow , and as he seemed pleased to have her there , she remained , busying herself with her work . ‘
88667	88688	88440	88442	the old man	384	’ she asked . The poor schoolmaster shook his head , and said that they barely filled the two forms . ‘
88696	88709	88690	88691	the others	1868	’ asked the child , glancing at the trophies on the wall . ‘
88713	88718	88719	88720	good boys	2188	’ returned the schoolmaster , ‘
88734	89849	88727	88727	they	2188	’ A small white - headed boy with a sunburnt face appeared at the door while he was speaking , and stopping there to make a rustic bow , came in and took his seat upon one of the forms . The white - headed boy then put an open book , astonishingly dog’s - eared upon his knees , and thrusting his hands into his pockets began counting the marbles with which they were filled ; displaying in the expression of his face a remarkable capacity of totally abstracting his mind from the spelling on which his eyes were fixed . Soon afterwards another white - headed little boy came straggling in , and after him a red - headed lad , and after him two more with white heads , and then one with a flaxen poll , and so on until the forms were occupied by a dozen boys or thereabouts , with heads of every colour but grey , and ranging in their ages from four years old to fourteen years or more ; for the legs of the youngest were a long way from the floor when he sat upon the form , and the eldest was a heavy good - tempered foolish fellow , about half a head taller than the schoolmaster . At the top of the first form -- the post of honour in the school -- was the vacant place of the little sick scholar , and at the head of the row of pegs on which those who came in hats or caps were wo nt to hang them up , one was left empty . No boy attempted to violate the sanctity of seat or peg , but many a one looked from the empty spaces to the schoolmaster , and whispered his idle neighbour behind his hand . Then began the hum of conning over lessons and getting them by heart , the whispered jest and stealthy game , and all the noise and drawl of school ; and in the midst of the din sat the poor schoolmaster , the very image of meekness and simplicity , vainly attempting to fix his mind upon the duties of the day , and to forget his little friend . But the tedium of his office reminded him more strongly of the willing scholar , and his thoughts were rambling from his pupils -- it was plain . None knew this better than the idlest boys , who , growing bolder with impunity , waxed louder and more daring ; playing odd - or - even under the master ’s eye , eating apples openly and without rebuke , pinching each other in sport or malice without the least reserve , and cutting their autographs in the very legs of his desk . The puzzled dunce , who stood beside it to say his lesson out of book , looked no longer at the ceiling for forgotten words , but drew closer to the master ’s elbow and boldly cast his eye upon the page ; the wag of the little troop squinted and made grimaces ( at the smallest boy of course ) , holding no book before his face , and his approving audience knew no constraint in their delight . If the master did chance to rouse himself and seem alive to what was going on , the noise subsided for a moment and no eyes met his but wore a studious and a deeply humble look ; but the instant he relapsed again , it broke out afresh , and ten times louder than before . Oh ! how some of those idle fellows longed to be outside , and how they looked at the open door and window , as if they half meditated rushing violently out , plunging into the woods , and being wild boys and savages from that time forth . What rebellious thoughts of the cool river , and some shady bathing - place beneath willow trees with branches dipping in the water , kept tempting and urging that sturdy boy , who , with his shirt - collar unbuttoned and flung back as far as it could go , sat fanning his flushed face with a spelling - book , wishing himself a whale , or a tittlebat , or a fly , or anything but a boy at school on that hot , broiling day ! Heat ! ask that other boy , whose seat being nearest to the door gave him opportunities of gliding out into the garden and driving his companions to madness by dipping his face into the bucket of the well and then rolling on the grass -- ask him if there were ever such a day as that , when even the bees were diving deep down into the cups of flowers and stopping there , as if they had made up their minds to retire from business and be manufacturers of honey no more . The day was made for laziness , and lying on one ’s back in green places , and staring at the sky till its brightness forced one to shut one ’s eyes and go to sleep ; and was this a time to be poring over musty books in a dark room , slighted by the very sun itself ? Monstrous ! Nell sat by the window occupied with her work , but attentive still to all that passed , though sometimes rather timid of the boisterous boys . The lessons over , writing time began ; and there being but one desk and that the master ’s , each boy sat at it in turn and laboured at his crooked copy , while the master walked about . This was a quieter time ; for he would come and look over the writer ’s shoulder , and tell him mildly to observe how such a letter was turned in such a copy on the wall , praise such an up - stroke here and such a down - stroke there , and bid him take it for his model . Then he would stop and tell them what the sick child had said last night , and how he had longed to be among them once again ; and such was the poor schoolmaster ’s gentle and affectionate manner , that the boys seemed quite remorseful that they had worried him so much , and were absolutely quiet ; eating no apples , cutting no names , inflicting no pinches , and making no grimaces , for full two minutes afterwards . ‘
89855	89865	89850	89850	I	0	’ said the schoolmaster when the clock struck twelve , ‘
89878	89961	89867	89867	I	0	’ At this intelligence , the boys , led on and headed by the tall boy , raised a great shout , in the midst of which the master was seen to speak , but could not be heard . As he held up his hand , however , in token of his wish that they should be silent , they were considerate enough to leave off , as soon as the longest - winded among them were quite out of breath . ‘
89968	89973	90034	90034	they	2193	’ said the schoolmaster , ‘
90007	90019	90006	90006	I	0	’m sure you would n’t disturb your old playmate and companion . ’
90071	90084	90086	90087	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ Then pray do n’t forget , there ’s my dear scholars , ’
90089	90129	90086	90087	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ what I have asked you , and do it as a favour to me . Be as happy as you can , and do n’t be unmindful that you are blessed with health . Good - bye all ! ’
90130	90135	90086	90087	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ Thank’ee , Sir , ’
90137	90144	90086	90087	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ good - bye , Sir , ’
90299	90307	90309	90311	the poor schoolmaster	7646	‘ It ’s natural , thank Heaven ! ’
90317	90319	90309	90311	the poor schoolmaster	7646	‘ I ’m
90328	90814	90817	90817	dame	2205	’ It is difficult , however , to please everybody , as most of us would have discovered , even without the fable which bears that moral , and in the course of the afternoon several mothers and aunts of pupils looked in to express their entire disapproval of the schoolmaster ’s proceeding . A few confined themselves to hints , such as politely inquiring what red - letter day or saint ’s day the almanack said it was ; a few ( these were the profound village politicians ) argued that it was a slight to the throne and an affront to church and state , and savoured of revolutionary principles , to grant a half - holiday upon any lighter occasion than the birthday of the Monarch ; but the majority expressed their displeasure on private grounds and in plain terms , arguing that to put the pupils on this short allowance of learning was nothing but an act of downright robbery and fraud : and one old lady , finding that she could not inflame or irritate the peaceable schoolmaster by talking to him , bounced out of his house and talked at him for half - an - hour outside his own window , to another old lady , saying that of course he would deduct this half - holiday from his weekly charge , or of course he would naturally expect to have an opposition started against him ; there was no want of idle chaps in that neighbourhood ( here the old lady raised her voice ) , and some chaps who were too idle even to be schoolmasters , might soon find that there were other chaps put over their heads , and so she would have them take care , and look pretty sharp about them . But all these taunts and vexations failed to elicit one word from the meek schoolmaster , who sat with the child by his side -- a little more dejected perhaps , but quite silent and uncomplaining . Towards night an old woman came tottering up the garden as speedily as she could , and meeting the schoolmaster at the door , said he was to go to Dame West ’s directly , and had best run on before her . He and the child were on the point of going out together for a walk , and without relinquishing her hand , the schoolmaster hurried away , leaving the messenger to follow as she might . They stopped at a cottage - door , and the schoolmaster knocked softly at it with his hand . It was opened without loss of time . They entered a room where a little group of women were gathered about one , older than the rest , who was crying very bitterly , and sat wringing her hands and rocking herself to and fro . ‘
90819	90829	90817	90817	dame	2205	’ said the schoolmaster , drawing near her chair , ‘
90837	90838	90817	90817	dame	2205	’ ‘
90844	90850	90839	90839	He	2206	’ cried the old woman ; ‘
90901	90902	90894	90894	dear	6657	’ ‘
90913	90921	90907	90907	I	0	’ urged the gentle school - master . ‘
90956	90957	90958	90958	I	0	’ ‘
90961	90967	90958	90958	I	0	’ returned the old woman . ‘
91002	91194	90999	90999	he	2206	’ The schoolmaster looked round upon the other women as if to entreat some one among them to say a kind word for him , but they shook their heads , and murmured to each other that they never thought there was much good in learning , and that this convinced them . Without saying a word in reply , or giving them a look of reproach , he followed the old woman who had summoned him ( and who had now rejoined them ) into another room , where his infant friend , half - dressed , lay stretched upon a bed . He was a very young boy ; quite a little child . His hair still hung in curls about his face , and his eyes were very bright ; but their light was of Heaven , not earth . The schoolmaster took a seat beside him , and stooping over the pillow , whispered his name . The boy sprung up , stroked his face with his hand , and threw his wasted arms round his neck , crying out that he was his dear kind friend . ‘
91209	91215	91201	91201	I	0	’ said the poor schoolmaster . ‘
91220	91228	91229	91229	I	0	’ said the boy , seeing Nell . ‘
91251	91283	91284	91284	You	0	’ The sobbing child came closer up , and took the little languid hand in hers . Releasing his again after a time , the sick boy laid him gently down . ‘
91291	91310	91289	91289	Harry	146	’ whispered the schoolmaster , anxious to rouse him , for a dulness seemed gathering upon the child , ‘
91367	91432	91365	91365	you	0	’ The boy smiled faintly -- so very , very faintly -- and put his hand upon his friend ’s grey head . He moved his lips too , but no voice came from them ; no , not a sound . In the silence that ensued , the hum of distant voices borne upon the evening air came floating through the open window . ‘
91437	91447	91448	91454	The boys at play upon the green	2213	’ said the sick child , opening his eyes . ‘
91456	91482	91448	91454	The boys at play upon the green	2213	’ He took a handkerchief from his pillow , and tried to wave it above his head . But the feeble arm dropped powerless down . ‘
91488	91493	91484	91484	I	0	’ said the schoolmaster . ‘
91501	91507	91484	91484	I	0	’ was the faint reply . ‘
91534	92217	91523	91523	they	2213	’ He raised his head , and glanced from the fluttering signal to his idle bat , that lay with slate and book and other boyish property upon a table in the room . And then he laid him softly down once more , and asked if the little girl were there , for he could not see her . She stepped forward , and pressed the passive hand that lay upon the coverlet . The two old friends and companions -- for such they were , though they were man and child -- held each other in a long embrace , and then the little scholar turned his face towards the wall , and fell asleep . The poor schoolmaster sat in the same place , holding the small cold hand in his , and chafing it . It was but the hand of a dead child . He felt that ; and yet he chafed it still , and could not lay it down . CHAPTER 26 Almost broken - hearted , Nell withdrew with the schoolmaster from the bedside and returned to his cottage . In the midst of her grief and tears she was yet careful to conceal their real cause from the old man , for the dead boy had been a grandchild , and left but one aged relative to mourn his premature decay . She stole away to bed as quickly as she could , and when she was alone , gave free vent to the sorrow with which her breast was overcharged . But the sad scene she had witnessed , was not without its lesson of content and gratitude ; of content with the lot which left her health and freedom ; and gratitude that she was spared to the one relative and friend she loved , and to live and move in a beautiful world , when so many young creatures -- as young and full of hope as she -- were stricken down and gathered to their graves . How many of the mounds in that old churchyard where she had lately strayed , grew green above the graves of children ! And though she thought as a child herself , and did not perhaps sufficiently consider to what a bright and happy existence those who die young are borne , and how in death they lose the pain of seeing others die around them , bearing to the tomb some strong affection of their hearts ( which makes the old die many times in one long life ) , still she thought wisely enough , to draw a plain and easy moral from what she had seen that night , and to store it , deep in her mind . Her dreams were of the little scholar : not coffined and covered up , but mingling with angels , and smiling happily . The sun darting his cheerful rays into the room , awoke her ; and now there remained but to take leave of the poor schoolmaster and wander forth once more . By the time they were ready to depart , school had begun . In the darkened room , the din of yesterday was going on again : a little sobered and softened down , perhaps , but only a very little , if at all . The schoolmaster rose from his desk and walked with them to the gate . It was with a trembling and reluctant hand , that the child held out to him the money which the lady had given her at the races for her flowers : faltering in her thanks as she thought how small the sum was , and blushing as she offered it . But he bade her put it up , and stooping to kiss her cheek , turned back into his house . They had not gone half - a - dozen paces when he was at the door again ; the old man retraced his steps to shake hands , and the child did the same . ‘
92226	92232	92224	92224	you	2215	’ said the poor schoolmaster . ‘
92259	92260	92261	92261	We	2218	’ ‘
92269	92273	92261	92261	We	2218	’ rejoined Nell ; ‘
92288	92289	92290	92290	I	0	’ ‘
92303	92316	92290	92290	I	0	’ said the schoolmaster , shaking his head , and smiling thoughtfully , ‘
92348	93012	92344	92344	God	71	’ They bade him farewell very many times , and turned away , walking slowly and often looking back , until they could see him no more . At length they had left the village far behind , and even lost sight of the smoke among the trees . They trudged onward now , at a quicker pace , resolving to keep the main road , and go wherever it might lead them . But main roads stretch a long , long way . With the exception of two or three inconsiderable clusters of cottages which they passed , without stopping , and one lonely road - side public - house where they had some bread and cheese , this highway had led them to nothing -- late in the afternoon -- and still lengthened out , far in the distance , the same dull , tedious , winding course , that they had been pursuing all day . As they had no resource , however , but to go forward , they still kept on , though at a much slower pace , being very weary and fatigued . The afternoon had worn away into a beautiful evening , when they arrived at a point where the road made a sharp turn and struck across a common . On the border of this common , and close to the hedge which divided it from the cultivated fields , a caravan was drawn up to rest ; upon which , by reason of its situation , they came so suddenly that they could not have avoided it if they would . It was not a shabby , dingy , dusty cart , but a smart little house upon wheels , with white dimity curtains festooning the windows , and window - shutters of green picked out with panels of a staring red , in which happily - contrasted colours the whole concern shone brilliant . Neither was it a poor caravan drawn by a single donkey or emaciated horse , for a pair of horses in pretty good condition were released from the shafts and grazing on the frouzy grass . Neither was it a gipsy caravan , for at the open door ( graced with a bright brass knocker ) sat a Christian lady , stout and comfortable to look upon , who wore a large bonnet trembling with bows . And that it was not an unprovided or destitute caravan was clear from this lady ’s occupation , which was the very pleasant and refreshing one of taking tea . The tea - things , including a bottle of rather suspicious character and a cold knuckle of ham , were set forth upon a drum , covered with a white napkin ; and there , as if at the most convenient round - table in all the world , sat this roving lady , taking her tea and enjoying the prospect . It happened that at that moment the lady of the caravan had her cup ( which , that everything about her might be of a stout and comfortable kind , was a breakfast cup ) to her lips , and that having her eyes lifted to the sky in her enjoyment of the full flavour of the tea , not unmingled possibly with just the slightest dash or gleam of something out of the suspicious bottle -- but this is mere speculation and not distinct matter of history -- it happened that being thus agreeably engaged , she did not see the travellers when they first came up . It was not until she was in the act of getting down the cup , and drawing a long breath after the exertion of causing its contents to disappear , that the lady of the caravan beheld an old man and a young child walking slowly by , and glancing at her proceedings with eyes of modest but hungry admiration . ‘
93015	93039	92344	92344	God	71	’ cried the lady of the caravan , scooping the crumbs out of her lap and swallowing the same before wiping her lips . ‘
93056	93057	93054	93054	child	352	’ ‘
93063	93067	93061	93061	ma’am	609	’ asked Nell . ‘
93090	93091	93097	93097	ma’am	609	’ ‘
93099	93100	93097	93097	ma’am	609	’ ‘
93109	93119	93097	93097	ma’am	609	’ repeated the lady with an air of impatience . ‘
93133	93139	93097	93097	ma’am	609	’re asked the question civilly ? ’
93140	93148	93156	93160	the lady of the caravan	7887	‘ I do n’t know , ma’am . ’
93149	93154	93156	93160	the lady of the caravan	7887	‘ Do n’t know ! ’
93162	93177	93156	93160	the lady of the caravan	7887	‘ why , you were there . I saw you with my own eyes . ’
93212	93219	93221	93225	the lady of the caravan	7887	‘ And very sorry I was , ’
93227	93253	93221	93225	the lady of the caravan	7887	‘ to see you in company with a Punch ; a low , practical , wulgar wretch , that people should scorn to look at . ’
93254	93262	93264	93265	the child	324	‘ I was not there by choice , ’
93267	93302	93264	93265	the child	324	‘ we did n’t know our way , and the two men were very kind to us , and let us travel with them . Do you -- do you know them , ma’am ? ’
93303	93305	93221	93225	the lady of the caravan	7887	‘ Know ‘
93310	93323	93264	93265	the child	324	’ cried the lady of the caravan in a sort of shriek . ‘
93329	93352	93353	93353	em	2232	’re young and inexperienced , and that ’s your excuse for asking sich a question . Do I look as if I know’d ‘
93363	93366	93328	93328	you	352	‘ em ? ’
93367	93374	93376	93377	the child	324	‘ No , ma’am , no , ’
93387	93393	93376	93377	the child	324	‘ I beg your pardon . ’
93654	93661	93663	93663	she	7887	‘ Come nearer , nearer still , ’
93673	93680	93663	93663	she	7887	‘ Are you hungry , child ? ’
93681	93699	93643	93647	the lady of the caravan	7887	‘ Not very , but we are tired , and it’s -- it IS a long way . ’
93700	93714	93744	93748	The lady of the caravan	7887	‘ Well , hungry or not , you had better have some tea , ’
93720	93732	93733	93734	The grandfather	436	‘ I suppose you are agreeable to that , old gentleman ? ’
93826	93828	93814	93814	she	7887	‘ Set ‘
93844	93855	93836	93836	child	352	’ said their friend , superintending the arrangements from above . ‘
93903	94050	94051	94051	George	91	’ They might perhaps have carried out the lady ’s wish , if it had been less freely expressed , or even if it had not been expressed at all . But as this direction relieved them from any shadow of delicacy or uneasiness , they made a hearty meal and enjoyed it to the utmost . While they were thus engaged , the lady of the caravan alighted on the earth , and with her hands clasped behind her , and her large bonnet trembling excessively , walked up and down in a measured tread and very stately manner , surveying the caravan from time to time with an air of calm delight , and deriving particular gratification from the red panels and the brass knocker . When she had taken this gentle exercise for some time , she sat down upon the steps and called ‘
94052	94132	94135	94135	Missus	2256	’ ; whereupon a man in a carter ’s frock , who had been so shrouded in a hedge up to this time as to see everything that passed without being seen himself , parted the twigs that concealed him , and appeared in a sitting attitude , supporting on his legs a baking - dish and a half - gallon stone bottle , and bearing in his right hand a knife , and in his left a fork . ‘
94137	94141	94135	94135	Missus	2256	’ said George . ‘
94152	94153	94144	94144	you	2256	’ ‘
94160	94161	94158	94158	mum	2257	’ ‘
94166	94188	94135	94135	Missus	2256	’ said the lady of the caravan , with an appearance of being more interested in this question than the last ; ‘
94195	94196	94193	94193	George	91	’ ‘
94206	94210	94193	94193	George	91	’ George returned , ‘
94220	94313	94315	94315	you	91	’ To set the mind of his mistress at rest , he took a sip ( amounting in quantity to a pint or thereabouts ) from the stone bottle , and then smacked his lips , winked his eye , and nodded his head . No doubt with the same amiable desire , he immediately resumed his knife and fork , as a practical assurance that the beer had wrought no bad effect upon his appetite . The lady of the caravan looked on approvingly for some time , and then said , ‘
94319	94320	94315	94315	you	91	’ ‘
94326	94403	94324	94324	mum	2257	’ And indeed , after scraping the dish all round with his knife and carrying the choice brown morsels to his mouth , and after taking such a scientific pull at the stone bottle that , by degrees almost imperceptible to the sight , his head went further and further back until he lay nearly at his full length upon the ground , this gentleman declared himself quite disengaged , and came forth from his retreat . ‘
94414	94431	94412	94412	George	91	’ said his mistress , who appeared to have a great sympathy with his late pursuit . ‘
94436	94452	94412	94412	George	91	’ returned the follower , wisely reserving himself for any favourable contingency that might occur , ‘
94466	94467	94412	94412	George	91	’ ‘
94477	94478	94475	94475	George	91	’ ‘
94487	94512	94483	94484	the ladies	6097	’ replied the man , looking a long way round , as if he were appealing to Nature in general against such monstrous propositions . ‘
94574	94575	94577	94579	these two travellers	2265	’ ‘
94594	94627	94577	94579	these two travellers	2265	’ asked his mistress , offering no reply to the philosophical inquiry , and pointing to Nell and the old man , who were painfully preparing to resume their journey on foot . ‘
94636	94641	94628	94628	They	2265	’ said George doggedly . ‘
94648	94653	94654	94654	They	2265	’ repeated his mistress . ‘
94661	94662	94654	94654	They	2265	’ ‘
94666	94672	94674	94674	George	91	’ the pair , mum , ’
94694	94705	94674	94674	George	91	‘ would be a trifle under that of Oliver Cromwell . ’
95224	95229	95230	95230	she	7887	‘ Well , child , ’
95233	95243	95230	95230	she	7887	‘ how do you like this way of travelling ? ’
95319	95329	95330	95330	she	7887	‘ That ’s the happiness of you young people , ’
95333	95362	95330	95330	she	7887	‘ You do n’t know what it is to be low in your feelings . You always have your appetites too , and what a comfort that is . ’
95512	95517	95518	95518	she	72	‘ There , child , ’
95521	95525	95518	95518	she	72	‘ read that . ’
95543	95545	95518	95518	she	72	‘ JARLEY ’S
95550	95551	95526	95526	Nell	72	’ ‘
95556	95563	95526	95526	Nell	72	’ said the lady , complacently . ‘
95570	95574	95526	95526	Nell	72	’ repeated Nell . ‘
95579	95584	95577	95577	me	0	’ said the lady . ‘
95590	95647	95585	95585	I	0	’ Giving the child an encouraging look , intended to reassure her and let her know , that , although she stood in the presence of the original Jarley , she must not allow herself to be utterly overwhelmed and borne down , the lady of the caravan unfolded another scroll , whereon was the inscription , ‘
95657	95668	95585	95585	I	0	’ and then another scroll , on which was written , ‘
95682	95692	95585	95585	I	0	’ and then several smaller scrolls with such inscriptions as ‘
95719	95765	95699	95699	Jarley’--‘Jarley	179	’ When she had exhibited these leviathans of public announcement to the astonished child , she brought forth specimens of the lesser fry in the shape of hand - bills , some of which were couched in the form of parodies on popular melodies , as ‘
95788	95818	95699	95699	Jarley’--‘Jarley	179	’ while , to consult all tastes , others were composed with a view to the lighter and more facetious spirits , as a parody on the favourite air of ‘
95825	95841	95699	95699	Jarley’--‘Jarley	179	’ beginning , If I know’d a donkey wot would n’t go To see Mrs JARLEY ’S

96066	96187	96063	96064	Mrs Jarley	178	‘ It ’s calm and -- what ’s that word again -- critical?--no -- classical , that ’s it -- it ’s calm and classical . No low beatings and knockings about , no jokings and squeakings like your precious Punches , but always the same , with a constantly unchanging air of coldness and gentility ; and so like life , that if wax - work only spoke and walked about , you ’d hardly know the difference . I wo n’t go so far as to say , that , as it is , I ’ve seen wax - work quite like life , but I ’ve certainly seen some life that was exactly like wax - work . ’
96188	96195	96197	96197	Nell	72	‘ Is it here , ma’am ? ’
96207	96214	96197	96197	Nell	72	‘ Is what here , child ? ’
96215	96223	96063	96064	Mrs Jarley	178	‘ The wax - work , ma’am . ’
96224	96341	96197	96197	Nell	72	‘ Why , bless you , child , what are you thinking of ? How could such a collection be here , where you see everything except the inside of one little cupboard and a few boxes ? It ’s gone on in the other wans to the assembly - rooms , and there it ’ll be exhibited the day after to - morrow . You are going to the same town , and you ’ll see it I dare say . It ’s natural to expect that you ’ll see it , and I ’ve no doubt you will . I suppose you could n’t stop away if you was to try ever so much . ’
96342	96356	96358	96359	the child	324	‘ I shall not be in the town , I think , ma’am , ’

96378	96392	96197	96197	Nell	72	‘ I -- I -- don’t quite know . I am not certain . ’

96423	96463	96417	96421	the lady of the caravan	7887	‘ What curious people you are ! What line are you in ? You looked to me at the races , child , as if you were quite out of your element , and had got there by accident . ’
96464	96472	96474	96474	Nell	72	‘ We were there quite by accident , ’

It ’s not a common offer , bear in mind , ’
97368	97491	97349	97350	the lady	647	‘ it ’s Jarley ’s wax - work , remember . The duty ’s very light and genteel , the company particularly select , the exhibition takes place in assembly - rooms , town - halls , large rooms at inns , or auction galleries . There is none of your open - air wagrancy at Jarley ’s , recollect ; there is no tarpaulin and sawdust at Jarley ’s , remember . Every expectation held out in the handbills is realised to the utmost , and the whole forms an effect of imposing brilliancy hitherto unrivalled in this kingdom . Remember that the price of admission is only sixpence , and that this is an opportunity which may never occur again ! ’
97681	97686	97688	97689	Mrs Jarley	178	‘ Now , child ? ’
97701	97712	97714	97714	Nell	72	‘ We are very much obliged to you , ma’am , ’
97716	97723	97714	97714	Nell	72	‘ and thankfully accept your offer . ’
97724	97734	97736	97737	Mrs Jarley	178	‘ And you ’ll never be sorry for it , ’
97739	97741	97736	97737	Mrs Jarley	178	‘ I ’m
97762	97913	97714	97714	Nell	72	’ In the meanwhile , the caravan blundered on as if it too had been drinking strong beer and was drowsy , and came at last upon the paved streets of a town which were clear of passengers , and quiet , for it was by this time near midnight , and the townspeople were all abed . As it was too late an hour to repair to the exhibition room , they turned aside into a piece of waste ground that lay just within the old town - gate , and drew up there for the night , near to another caravan , which , notwithstanding that it bore on the lawful panel the great name of Jarley , and was employed besides in conveying from place to place the wax - work which was its country ’s pride , was designated by a grovelling stamp - office as a ‘
97918	98405	98408	98408	sirrah	2341	’ and numbered too -- seven thousand odd hundred -- as though its precious freight were mere flour or coals ! This ill - used machine being empty ( for it had deposited its burden at the place of exhibition , and lingered here until its services were again required ) was assigned to the old man as his sleeping - place for the night ; and within its wooden walls , Nell made him up the best bed she could , from the materials at hand . For herself , she was to sleep in Mrs Jarley ’s own travelling - carriage , as a signal mark of that lady ’s favour and confidence . She had taken leave of her grandfather and was returning to the other waggon , when she was tempted by the coolness of the night to linger for a little while in the air . The moon was shining down upon the old gateway of the town , leaving the low archway very black and dark ; and with a mingled sensation of curiosity and fear , she slowly approached the gate , and stood still to look up at it , wondering to see how dark , and grim , and old , and cold , it looked . There was an empty niche from which some old statue had fallen or been carried away hundreds of years ago , and she was thinking what strange people it must have looked down upon when it stood there , and how many hard struggles might have taken place , and how many murders might have been done , upon that silent spot , when there suddenly emerged from the black shade of the arch , a man . The instant he appeared , she recognised him -- Who could have failed to recognise , in that instant , the ugly misshapen Quilp ! The street beyond was so narrow , and the shadow of the houses on one side of the way so deep , that he seemed to have risen out of the earth . But there he was . The child withdrew into a dark corner , and saw him pass close to her . He had a stick in his hand , and , when he had got clear of the shadow of the gateway , he leant upon it , looked back -- directly , as it seemed , towards where she stood -- and beckoned . To her ? oh no , thank God , not to her ; for as she stood , in an extremity of fear , hesitating whether to scream for help , or come from her hiding - place and fly , before he should draw nearer , there issued slowly forth from the arch another figure -- that of a boy -- who carried on his back a trunk . ‘
98410	98448	98408	98408	sirrah	2341	’ cried Quilp , looking up at the old gateway , and showing in the moonlight like some monstrous image that had come down from its niche and was casting a backward glance at its old house , ‘
98451	98452	98408	98408	sirrah	2341	’ ‘
98462	98467	98460	98460	Sir	5863	’ the boy pleaded . ‘
98477	98478	98480	98480	You	0	’ ‘
98488	98492	98493	98493	you	0	’ retorted Quilp ; ‘
98520	98563	98585	98585	me	0	’ He stopped to listen , and then turning upon the boy with a suddenness and ferocity that made him start , asked at what hour that London coach passed the corner of the road . The boy replied , at one . ‘
98568	98572	98585	98585	me	0	’ said Quilp , ‘
98589	99163	98583	98583	you	0	’ The boy made all the speed he could , and Quilp led onward , constantly turning back to threaten him , and urge him to greater haste . Nell did not dare to move until they were out of sight and hearing , and then hurried to where she had left her grandfather , feeling as if the very passing of the dwarf so near him must have filled him with alarm and terror . But he was sleeping soundly , and she softly withdrew . As she was making her way to her own bed , she determined to say nothing of this adventure , as upon whatever errand the dwarf had come ( and she feared it must have been in search of them ) it was clear by his inquiry about the London coach that he was on his way homeward , and as he had passed through that place , it was but reasonable to suppose that they were safer from his inquiries there , than they could be elsewhere . These reflections did not remove her own alarm , for she had been too much terrified to be easily composed , and felt as if she were hemmed in by a legion of Quilps , and the very air itself were filled with them . The delight of the Nobility and Gentry and the patronised of Royalty had , by some process of self - abridgment known only to herself , got into her travelling bed , where she was snoring peacefully , while the large bonnet , carefully disposed upon the drum , was revealing its glories by the light of a dim lamp that swung from the roof . The child ’s bed was already made upon the floor , and it was a great comfort to her to hear the steps removed as soon as she had entered , and to know that all easy communication between persons outside and the brass knocker was by this means effectually prevented . Certain guttural sounds , too , which from time to time ascended through the floor of the caravan , and a rustling of straw in the same direction , apprised her that the driver was couched upon the ground beneath , and gave her an additional feeling of security . Notwithstanding these protections , she could get none but broken sleep by fits and starts all night , for fear of Quilp , who throughout her uneasy dreams was somehow connected with the wax - work , or was wax - work himself , or was Mrs Jarley and wax - work too , or was himself , Mrs Jarley , wax - work , and a barrel organ all in one , and yet not exactly any of them either . At length , towards break of day , that deep sleep came upon her which succeeds to weariness and over - watching , and which has no consciousness but one of overpowering and irresistible enjoyment . CHAPTER 28 Sleep hung upon the eyelids of the child so long , that , when she awoke , Mrs Jarley was already decorated with her large bonnet , and actively engaged in preparing breakfast . She received Nell ’s apology for being so late with perfect good humour , and said that she should not have roused her if she had slept on until noon . ‘
99170	99178	99180	99180	you	2343	’ said the lady of the caravan , ‘
99181	99218	98585	98585	me	0	’re tired , to sleep as long as ever you can , and get the fatigue quite off ; and that ’s another blessing of your time of life -- you can sleep so very sound . ’
99219	99229	99231	99231	Nell	72	‘ Have you had a bad night , ma’am ? ’
99233	99242	99244	99245	Mrs Jarley	178	‘ I seldom have anything else , child , ’
99254	99263	99244	99245	Mrs Jarley	178	‘ I sometimes wonder how I bear it . ’
99384	99395	99397	99398	Mrs Jarley	178	‘ The wan will come on to bring the boxes , ’
99454	100205	99449	99449	I	0	’ Nell returned a satisfactory reply , and Mrs Jarley , after sticking a great many pins into various parts of her figure , and making several abortive attempts to obtain a full view of her own back , was at last satisfied with her appearance , and went forth majestically . The caravan followed at no great distance . As it went jolting through the streets , Nell peeped from the window , curious to see in what kind of place they were , and yet fearful of encountering at every turn the dreaded face of Quilp . It was a pretty large town , with an open square which they were crawling slowly across , and in the middle of which was the Town - Hall , with a clock - tower and a weather - cock . There were houses of stone , houses of red brick , houses of yellow brick , houses of lath and plaster ; and houses of wood , many of them very old , with withered faces carved upon the beams , and staring down into the street . These had very little winking windows , and low - arched doors , and , in some of the narrower ways , quite overhung the pavement . The streets were very clean , very sunny , very empty , and very dull . A few idle men lounged about the two inns , and the empty market - place , and the tradesmen ’s doors , and some old people were dozing in chairs outside an alms - house wall ; but scarcely any passengers who seemed bent on going anywhere , or to have any object in view , went by ; and if perchance some straggler did , his footsteps echoed on the hot bright pavement for minutes afterwards . Nothing seemed to be going on but the clocks , and they had such drowzy faces , such heavy lazy hands , and such cracked voices that they surely must have been too slow . The very dogs were all asleep , and the flies , drunk with moist sugar in the grocer ’s shop , forgot their wings and briskness , and baked to death in dusty corners of the window . Rumbling along with most unwonted noise , the caravan stopped at last at the place of exhibition , where Nell dismounted amidst an admiring group of children , who evidently supposed her to be an important item of the curiosities , and were fully impressed with the belief that her grandfather was a cunning device in wax . The chests were taken out with all convenient despatch , and taken in to be unlocked by Mrs Jarley , who , attended by George and another man in velveteen shorts and a drab hat ornamented with turnpike tickets , were waiting to dispose their contents ( consisting of red festoons and other ornamental devices in upholstery work ) to the best advantage in the decoration of the room . They all got to work without loss of time , and very busy they were . As the stupendous collection were yet concealed by cloths , lest the envious dust should injure their complexions , Nell bestirred herself to assist in the embellishment of the room , in which her grandfather also was of great service . The two men being well used to it , did a great deal in a short time ; and Mrs Jarley served out the tin tacks from a linen pocket like a toll - collector ’s which she wore for the purpose , and encouraged her assistants to renewed exertion . While they were thus employed , a tallish gentleman with a hook nose and black hair , dressed in a military surtout very short and tight in the sleeves , and which had once been frogged and braided all over , but was now sadly shorn of its garniture and quite threadbare -- dressed too in ancient grey pantaloons fitting tight to the leg , and a pair of pumps in the winter of their existence -- looked in at the door and smiled affably . Mrs Jarley ’s back being then towards him , the military gentleman shook his forefinger as a sign that her myrmidons were not to apprise her of his presence , and stealing up close behind her , tapped her on the neck , and cried playfully ‘
100208	100209	99449	99449	I	0	’ ‘
100215	100225	100226	100226	Lot	2356	’ cried the lady of the wax - work . ‘
100237	100238	100248	100249	Mr Slum	182	’ ‘
100239	100246	100248	100249	Mr Slum	182	’ Pon my soul and honour , ’
100251	100258	100248	100249	Mr Slum	182	‘ that ’s a good remark . ‘
100286	100315	100276	100276	George	91	’ George received this advance with a surly indifference , observing that he was well enough for the matter of that , and hammering lustily all the time . ‘
100320	100373	100276	100276	George	91	’ said the military gentleman turning to Mrs Jarley--‘’pon my soul and honour I hardly know what I came here for . It would puzzle me to tell you , it would by Gad . I wanted a little inspiration , a little freshening up , a little change of ideas , and-- ‘
100380	100394	100276	100276	George	91	’ said the military gentleman , checking himself and looking round the room , ‘
100411	100412	100404	100404	Gad	184	’ ‘
100425	100430	100404	100404	Gad	184	’ observed Mrs Jarley . ‘
100434	100439	100404	100404	Gad	184	’ said Mr Slum . ‘
100491	100492	100485	100485	I	0	’ ‘
100501	100506	100508	100508	I	0	’ replied Mrs Jarley , ‘
100518	100519	100508	100508	I	0	’ ‘
100526	100535	100508	100508	I	0	’ returned Mr Slum , elevating his hand . ‘
100563	100564	100565	100565	I	0	’ ‘
100572	100577	100565	100565	I	0	’ said Mrs Jarley . ‘
100582	100587	100588	100588	you	2359	’ cried Mr Slum , ‘

100625	100681	100565	100565	I	0	‘ em what my poetry has done for him , and mark my words , he blesses the name of Slum . If he ’s an honest man , he raises his eyes to heaven , and blesses the name of Slum -- mark that ! You are acquainted with Westminster Abbey , Mrs Jarley ? ’
100682	100687	100613	100619	the old lottery - office - keepers	2364	‘ Yes , surely . ’
100688	100712	100565	100565	I	0	‘ Then upon my soul and honour , ma’am , you ’ll find in a certain angle of that dreary pile , called Poets ’
100722	100746	100565	100565	I	0	’ retorted that gentleman , tapping himself expressively on the forehead to imply that there was some slight quantity of brain behind it . ‘
100757	100774	100613	100619	the old lottery - office - keepers	2364	’ said Mr Slum , taking off his hat which was full of scraps of paper , ‘
100839	100840	100841	100841	I	0	’ ‘
100848	100853	100841	100841	I	0	’ said Mrs Jarley . ‘
100857	100869	100841	100841	I	0	’ returned Mr Slum , using his pencil as a toothpick . ‘
100875	100876	100877	100877	I	0	’ ‘
100885	100890	100877	100877	I	0	’ said Mrs Jarley . ‘
100894	100898	100877	100877	I	0	’ retorted Slum . ‘
100907	101241	100877	100877	I	0	’ Mrs Jarley was not proof against the poet ’s insinuating manner , and Mr Slum entered the order in a small note - book as a three - and - sixpenny one . Mr Slum then withdrew to alter the acrostic , after taking a most affectionate leave of his patroness , and promising to return , as soon as he possibly could , with a fair copy for the printer . As his presence had not interfered with or interrupted the preparations , they were now far advanced , and were completed shortly after his departure . When the festoons were all put up as tastily as they might be , the stupendous collection was uncovered , and there were displayed , on a raised platform some two feet from the floor , running round the room and parted from the rude public by a crimson rope breast high , divers sprightly effigies of celebrated characters , singly and in groups , clad in glittering dresses of various climes and times , and standing more or less unsteadily upon their legs , with their eyes very wide open , and their nostrils very much inflated , and the muscles of their legs and arms very strongly developed , and all their countenances expressing great surprise . All the gentlemen were very pigeon - breasted and very blue about the beards ; and all the ladies were miraculous figures ; and all the ladies and all the gentlemen were looking intensely nowhere , and staring with extraordinary earnestness at nothing . When Nell had exhausted her first raptures at this glorious sight , Mrs Jarley ordered the room to be cleared of all but herself and the child , and , sitting herself down in an arm - chair in the centre , formally invested Nell with a willow wand , long used by herself for pointing out the characters , and was at great pains to instruct her in her duty . ‘
101244	101265	101267	101271	an unfortunate Maid of Honour	2367	’ said Mrs Jarley in her exhibition tone , as Nell touched a figure at the beginning of the platform , ‘
101320	101350	101315	101315	she	89	’ All this , Nell repeated twice or thrice : pointing to the finger and the needle at the right times : and then passed on to the next . ‘
101357	101362	101364	101365	Jasper Packlemerton	187	’ said Mrs Jarley , ‘
101429	101501	101423	101423	he	2371	‘ em off so easy , and hoped all Christian husbands would pardon him the offence . Let this be a warning to all young ladies to be particular in the character of the gentlemen of their choice . Observe that his fingers are curled as if in the act of tickling , and that his face is represented with a wink , as he appeared when committing his barbarous murders . ’
101874	101881	102269	102270	Mrs Jarley	178	‘ If I know’d a donkey , ’
101895	102262	102269	102270	Mrs Jarley	178	’ clerks and choice spirits of the place . When this had been done , and Mrs Jarley had waited upon the boarding - schools in person , with a handbill composed expressly for them , in which it was distinctly proved that wax - work refined the mind , cultivated the taste , and enlarged the sphere of the human understanding , that indefatigable lady sat down to dinner , and drank out of the suspicious bottle to a flourishing campaign . CHAPTER 29 Unquestionably Mrs Jarley had an inventive genius . In the midst of the various devices for attracting visitors to the exhibition , little Nell was not forgotten . The light cart in which the Brigand usually made his perambulations being gaily dressed with flags and streamers , and the Brigand placed therein , contemplating the miniature of his beloved as usual , Nell was accommodated with a seat beside him , decorated with artificial flowers , and in this state and ceremony rode slowly through the town every morning , dispersing handbills from a basket , to the sound of drum and trumpet . The beauty of the child , coupled with her gentle and timid bearing , produced quite a sensation in the little country place . The Brigand , heretofore a source of exclusive interest in the streets , became a mere secondary consideration , and to be important only as a part of the show of which she was the chief attraction . Grown - up folks began to be interested in the bright - eyed girl , and some score of little boys fell desperately in love , and constantly left enclosures of nuts and apples , directed in small - text , at the wax - work door . This desirable impression was not lost on Mrs Jarley , who , lest Nell should become too cheap , soon sent the Brigand out alone again , and kept her in the exhibition room , where she described the figures every half - hour to the great satisfaction of admiring audiences . And these audiences were of a very superior description , including a great many young ladies ’
103619	103629	103601	103610	not a man , who was standing at the door	2442	‘ Your ears ought to be better than other folks ’
103647	103669	103601	103610	not a man , who was standing at the door	2442	’ he said , retreating from the door and shading his eyes with his hands as the jagged lightning came again . ‘
103679	103700	103672	103672	you	2443	’ he added , as he closed the door and led the way along a passage to a room behind . ‘
103716	103720	103713	103713	you	5863	’ Nell replied . ‘
103724	103729	103713	103713	you	5863	’ said the man , ‘
103814	103815	103805	103807	The Valiant Soldier	2448	’ ‘
103826	103830	103824	103824	Sir	5863	’ asked Nell . ‘
103837	103842	103831	103831	I	0	’ replied the landlord . ‘
104093	104099	104101	104102	Mr Groves	195	‘ There an’t many men , ’

104176	104192	104172	104172	he	2461	’ In return for this complimentary address , a very gruff hoarse voice bade Mr Groves ‘
104201	104211	104215	104215	his	2461	’ And the same voice remarked that the same gentleman ‘
104235	104236	104237	104237	Nell	72	’ ‘
104245	104254	104259	104259	them	2464	’ whispered the old man , suddenly interested . ‘
104261	104262	104259	104259	them	2464	’ ‘
104269	104274	104259	104259	them	2464	’ said the voice ; ‘

104350	104369	104343	104343	Nell	72	’ whispered the old man again , with increased earnestness , as the money chinked upon the table . ‘
104380	104401	104370	104370	I	0	’ said a sharp cracked voice of most disagreeable quality , when a tremendous peal of thunder had died away , ‘
104463	104464	104449	104449	he	197	’ ‘
104467	104473	104449	104449	he	197	’ returned the gruff voice ; ‘
104530	104531	104519	104519	he	197	’ ‘
104539	104545	104536	104536	he	197	’ whispered the old man . ‘
104553	104612	104547	104547	you	2471	’ The child saw with astonishment and alarm that his whole appearance had undergone a complete change . His face was flushed and eager , his eyes were strained , his teeth set , his breath came short and thick , and the hand he laid upon her arm trembled so violently that she shook beneath its grasp . ‘
104616	104623	104613	104614	Bear witness	2472	’ he muttered , looking upward , ‘
104678	104679	104689	104689	grandfather	382	’ ‘
104691	104697	104689	104689	grandfather	382	’ said the frightened child . ‘

104726	104733	104723	104723	I	0	’ returned the old man fiercely . ‘

104793	104798	104777	104777	I	0	’ said the child . ‘

104852	104858	104872	104872	Nell	72	’ returned the old man , ‘
104891	105115	105116	105118	Now old gentleman	2479	’ She took from her pocket a little purse . He seized it with the same rapid impatience which had characterised his speech , and hastily made his way to the other side of the screen . It was impossible to restrain him , and the trembling child followed close behind . The landlord had placed a light upon the table , and was engaged in drawing the curtain of the window . The speakers whom they had heard were two men , who had a pack of cards and some silver money between them , while upon the screen itself the games they had played were scored in chalk . The man with the rough voice was a burly fellow of middle age , with large black whiskers , broad cheeks , a coarse wide mouth , and bull neck , which was pretty freely displayed as his shirt collar was only confined by a loose red neckerchief . He wore his hat , which was of a brownish - white , and had beside him a thick knotted stick . The other man , whom his companion had called Isaac , was of a more slender figure -- stooping , and high in the shoulders -- with a very ill - favoured face , and a most sinister and villainous squint . ‘
105120	105127	105116	105118	Now old gentleman	2479	’ said Isaac , looking round . ‘

105170	105178	105164	105164	sir	5863	’ said the other , interrupting him , ‘

105258	105275	105278	105278	you	5863	’ said the stout man , raising his eyes from his cards for the first time , ‘
105283	105314	105278	105278	you	5863	’ The landlord , who had apparently resolved to remain neutral until he knew which side of the question the stout man would espouse , chimed in at this place with ‘
105331	105332	105323	105323	you	5863	’ ‘
105340	105364	105335	105335	I	0	’ sneered Isaac in reply , mimicking as nearly as he could , in his shrill voice , the tones of the landlord . ‘

105387	105432	105385	105385	you	5863	’ said the landlord . Mr List ’s squint assumed a portentous character , which seemed to threaten a prolongation of this controversy , when his companion , who had been looking sharply at the old man , put a timely stop to it . ‘
105436	105445	105385	105385	you	5863	’ said he , with a cunning look , ‘

105530	105567	105512	105513	the gentleman	518	’ The old man replied by shaking the little purse in his eager hand , and then throwing it down upon the table , and gathering up the cards as a miser would clutch at gold . ‘
105573	105577	105512	105513	the gentleman	518	’ said Isaac ; ‘
105612	105626	105582	105583	the gentleman	518	’ added Isaac , throwing it into the air and catching it dexterously , ‘

105658	105664	105656	105656	Groves	198	’ said the stout man . ‘
105669	105719	105667	105667	Jemmy	198	’ The landlord , who conducted himself like one who was well used to such little parties , approached the table and took his seat . The child , in a perfect agony , drew her grandfather aside , and implored him , even then , to come away . ‘
105729	105734	105735	105735	We	2490	’ said the child . ‘
105740	105747	105735	105735	We	2490	’ replied the old man hastily . ‘

105814	105819	105803	105803	thee	72	’ cried the child . ‘

105833	105845	105803	105803	thee	72	’ rejoined the old man laying his hand upon her mouth , ‘

105875	105881	105873	105873	mister	2498	’ said the stout man . ‘
105884	105897	105905	105907	the old man	384	’re not coming yourself , give us the cards , will you ? ’
105898	105903	105905	105907	the old man	384	‘ I am coming , ’
105909	105987	105905	105907	the old man	384	‘ Sit thee down , Nell , sit thee down and look on . Be of good heart , it ’s all for thee -- all -- every penny . I do n’t tell them , no , no , or else they would n’t play , dreading the chance that such a cause must give me . Look at them . See what they are and what thou art . Who doubts that we must win ! ’
105988	106002	106004	106004	Isaac	196	‘ The gentleman has thought better of it , and is n’t coming , ’
106016	106018	106004	106004	Isaac	196	‘ I ’m

106052	106058	106044	106044	You	2502	’ said the old man . ‘
106069	106577	106068	106068	I.	0	’ As he spoke he drew a chair to the table ; and the other three closing round it at the same time , the game commenced . The child sat by , and watched its progress with a troubled mind . Regardless of the run of luck , and mindful only of the desperate passion which had its hold upon her grandfather , losses and gains were to her alike . Exulting in some brief triumph , or cast down by a defeat , there he sat so wild and restless , so feverishly and intensely anxious , so terribly eager , so ravenous for the paltry stakes , that she could have almost better borne to see him dead . And yet she was the innocent cause of all this torture , and he , gambling with such a savage thirst for gain as the most insatiable gambler never felt , had not one selfish thought ! On the contrary , the other three -- knaves and gamesters by their trade -- while intent upon their game , were yet as cool and quiet as if every virtue had been centered in their breasts . Sometimes one would look up to smile to another , or to snuff the feeble candle , or to glance at the lightning as it shot through the open window and fluttering curtain , or to listen to some louder peal of thunder than the rest , with a kind of momentary impatience , as if it put him out ; but there they sat , with a calm indifference to everything but their cards , perfect philosophers in appearance , and with no greater show of passion or excitement than if they had been made of stone . The storm had raged for full three hours ; the lightning had grown fainter and less frequent ; the thunder , from seeming to roll and break above their heads , had gradually died away into a deep hoarse distance ; and still the game went on , and still the anxious child was quite forgotten . CHAPTER 30 At length the play came to an end , and Mr Isaac List rose the only winner . Mat and the landlord bore their losses with professional fortitude . Isaac pocketed his gains with the air of a man who had quite made up his mind to win , all along , and was neither surprised nor pleased . Nell ’s little purse was exhausted ; but although it lay empty by his side , and the other players had now risen from the table , the old man sat poring over the cards , dealing them as they had been dealt before , and turning up the different hands to see what each man would have held if they had still been playing . He was quite absorbed in this occupation , when the child drew near and laid her hand upon his shoulder , telling him it was near midnight . ‘
106586	106602	106584	106584	Nell	72	’ he said , pointing to the packs he had spread out upon the table . ‘
106650	106651	106584	106584	Nell	72	’ ‘
106656	106661	106584	106584	Nell	72	’ urged the child . ‘
106667	106668	106584	106584	Nell	72	’ ‘
106674	106693	106584	106584	Nell	72	’ he rejoined , raising his haggard face to hers , and regarding her with an incredulous stare . ‘
106710	106719	106724	106724	Nell	72	’ The child could only shake her head . ‘
106726	106736	106724	106724	Nell	72	’ said the old man , patting her cheek ; ‘
106798	106799	106794	106794	I	0	’ ‘
106808	106820	106801	106801	you	2505	’ said Mr Groves , who was smoking with his friends . ‘
106824	106825	106801	106801	you	2505	’ ‘
106831	106837	106838	106840	The Valiant Soldier	2448	’ added the stout man . ‘
106856	106867	106838	106840	The Valiant Soldier	2448	’ said Mr Groves , quoting his sign - board . ‘
106874	106875	106838	106840	The Valiant Soldier	2448	’ ‘
106881	106887	106888	106888	I	0	’ said the uneasy child . ‘
106926	106927	106897	106897	they	2509	’ ‘
106950	107120	107170	107170	I	0	’ replied the Valiant Soldier . Now , Nell had still the piece of gold sewn in her dress ; and when she came to consider the lateness of the hour , and the somnolent habits of Mrs Jarley , and to imagine the state of consternation in which they would certainly throw that good lady by knocking her up in the middle of the night -- and when she reflected , on the other hand , that if they remained where they were , and rose early in the morning , they might get back before she awoke , and could plead the violence of the storm by which they had been overtaken , as a good apology for their absence -- she decided , after a great deal of hesitation , to remain . She therefore took her grandfather aside , and telling him that she had still enough left to defray the cost of their lodging , proposed that they should stay there for the night . ‘
107142	107148	107149	107149	We	2512	’ muttered the old man . ‘
107159	107169	107149	107149	We	2512	’ said Nell , turning hastily to the landlord . ‘
107176	107181	107170	107170	I	0	’ returned Mr Groves . ‘
107189	107382	107185	107185	your	2514	’ Accordingly , when Mr Groves had smoked his pipe out , knocked out the ashes , and placed it carefully in a corner of the fire - place , with the bowl downwards , he brought in the bread and cheese , and beer , with many high encomiums upon their excellence , and bade his guests fall to , and make themselves at home . Nell and her grandfather ate sparingly , for both were occupied with their own reflections ; the other gentlemen , for whose constitutions beer was too weak and tame a liquid , consoled themselves with spirits and tobacco . As they would leave the house very early in the morning , the child was anxious to pay for their entertainment before they retired to bed . But as she felt the necessity of concealing her little hoard from her grandfather , and had to change the piece of gold , she took it secretly from its place of concealment , and embraced an opportunity of following the landlord when he went out of the room , and tendered it to him in the little bar . ‘
107395	107690	107384	107384	you	2515	’ said the child . Mr James Groves was evidently surprised , and looked at the money , and rang it , and looked at the child , and at the money again , as though he had a mind to inquire how she came by it . The coin being genuine , however , and changed at his house , he probably felt , like a wise landlord , that it was no business of his . At any rate , he counted out the change , and gave it her . The child was returning to the room where they had passed the evening , when she fancied she saw a figure just gliding in at the door . There was nothing but a long dark passage between this door and the place where she had changed the money , and , being very certain that no person had passed in or out while she stood there , the thought struck her that she had been watched . But by whom ? When she re - entered the room , she found its inmates exactly as she had left them . The stout fellow lay upon two chairs , resting his head on his hand , and the squinting man reposed in a similar attitude on the opposite side of the table . Between them sat her grandfather , looking intently at the winner with a kind of hungry admiration , and hanging upon his words as if he were some superior being . She was puzzled for a moment , and looked round to see if any else were there . No . Then she asked her grandfather in a whisper whether anybody had left the room while she was absent . ‘
107693	107697	107698	107698	nobody	5885	’ he said , ‘
107700	108007	107698	107698	nobody	5885	’ It must have been her fancy then ; and yet it was strange , that , without anything in her previous thoughts to lead to it , she should have imagined this figure so very distinctly . She was still wondering and thinking of it , when a girl came to light her to bed . The old man took leave of the company at the same time , and they went up stairs together . It was a great , rambling house , with dull corridors and wide staircases which the flaring candles seemed to make more gloomy . She left her grandfather in his chamber , and followed her guide to another , which was at the end of a passage , and approached by some half - dozen crazy steps . This was prepared for her . The girl lingered a little while to talk , and tell her grievances . She had not a good place , she said ; the wages were low , and the work was hard . She was going to leave it in a fortnight ; the child could n’t recommend her to another , she supposed ? Instead she was afraid another would be difficult to get after living there , for the house had a very indifferent character ; there was far too much card - playing , and such like . She was very much mistaken if some of the people who came there oftenest were quite as honest as they might be , but she would n’t have it known that she had said so , for the world . Then there were some rambling allusions to a rejected sweetheart , who had threatened to go a soldiering -- a final promise of knocking at the door early in the morning -- and ‘
108011	109690	107698	107698	nobody	5885	’ The child did not feel comfortable when she was left alone . She could not help thinking of the figure stealing through the passage down stairs ; and what the girl had said did not tend to reassure her . The men were very ill - looking . They might get their living by robbing and murdering travellers . Who could tell ? Reasoning herself out of these fears , or losing sight of them for a little while , there came the anxiety to which the adventures of the night gave rise . Here was the old passion awakened again in her grandfather ’s breast , and to what further distraction it might tempt him Heaven only knew . What fears their absence might have occasioned already ! Persons might be seeking for them even then . Would they be forgiven in the morning , or turned adrift again ! Oh ! why had they stopped in that strange place ? It would have been better , under any circumstances , to have gone on ! At last , sleep gradually stole upon her -- a broken , fitful sleep , troubled by dreams of falling from high towers , and waking with a start and in great terror . A deeper slumber followed this -- and then -- What ! That figure in the room . A figure was there . Yes , she had drawn up the blind to admit the light when it should be dawn , and there , between the foot of the bed and the dark casement , it crouched and slunk along , groping its way with noiseless hands , and stealing round the bed . She had no voice to cry for help , no power to move , but lay still , watching it . On it came -- on , silently and stealthily , to the bed ’s head . The breath so near her pillow , that she shrunk back into it , lest those wandering hands should light upon her face . Back again it stole to the window -- then turned its head towards her . The dark form was a mere blot upon the lighter darkness of the room , but she saw the turning of the head , and felt and knew how the eyes looked and the ears listened . There it remained , motionless as she . At length , still keeping the face towards her , it busied its hands in something , and she heard the chink of money . Then , on it came again , silent and stealthy as before , and replacing the garments it had taken from the bedside , dropped upon its hands and knees , and crawled away . How slowly it seemed to move , now that she could hear but not see it , creeping along the floor ! It reached the door at last , and stood upon its feet . The steps creaked beneath its noiseless tread , and it was gone . The first impulse of the child was to fly from the terror of being by herself in that room -- to have somebody by -- not to be alone -- and then her power of speech would be restored . With no consciousness of having moved , she gained the door . There was the dreadful shadow , pausing at the bottom of the steps . She could not pass it ; she might have done so , perhaps , in the darkness without being seized , but her blood curdled at the thought . The figure stood quite still , and so did she ; not boldly , but of necessity ; for going back into the room was hardly less terrible than going on . The rain beat fast and furiously without , and ran down in plashing streams from the thatched roof . Some summer insect , with no escape into the air , flew blindly to and fro , beating its body against the walls and ceiling , and filling the silent place with murmurs . The figure moved again . The child involuntarily did the same . Once in her grandfather ’s room , she would be safe . It crept along the passage until it came to the very door she longed so ardently to reach . The child , in the agony of being so near , had almost darted forward with the design of bursting into the room and closing it behind her , when the figure stopped again . The idea flashed suddenly upon her -- what if it entered there , and had a design upon the old man ’s life ! She turned faint and sick . It did . It went in . There was a light inside . The figure was now within the chamber , and she , still dumb -- quite dumb , and almost senseless -- stood looking on . The door was partly open . Not knowing what she meant to do , but meaning to preserve him or be killed herself , she staggered forward and looked in . What sight was that which met her view ! The bed had not been lain on , but was smooth and empty . And at a table sat the old man himself ; the only living creature there ; his white face pinched and sharpened by the greediness which made his eyes unnaturally bright -- counting the money of which his hands had robbed her . CHAPTER 31 With steps more faltering and unsteady than those with which she had approached the room , the child withdrew from the door , and groped her way back to her own chamber . The terror she had lately felt was nothing compared with that which now oppressed her . No strange robber , no treacherous host conniving at the plunder of his guests , or stealing to their beds to kill them in their sleep , no nightly prowler , however terrible and cruel , could have awakened in her bosom half the dread which the recognition of her silent visitor inspired . The grey - headed old man gliding like a ghost into her room and acting the thief while he supposed her fast asleep , then bearing off his prize and hanging over it with the ghastly exultation she had witnessed , was worse -- immeasurably worse , and far more dreadful , for the moment , to reflect upon -- than anything her wildest fancy could have suggested . If he should return -- there was no lock or bolt upon the door , and if , distrustful of having left some money yet behind , he should come back to seek for more -- a vague awe and horror surrounded the idea of his slinking in again with stealthy tread , and turning his face toward the empty bed , while she shrank down close at his feet to avoid his touch , which was almost insupportable . She sat and listened . Hark ! A footstep on the stairs , and now the door was slowly opening . It was but imagination , yet imagination had all the terrors of reality ; nay , it was worse , for the reality would have come and gone , and there an end , but in imagination it was always coming , and never went away . The feeling which beset the child was one of dim uncertain horror . She had no fear of the dear old grandfather , in whose love for her this disease of the brain had been engendered ; but the man she had seen that night , wrapt in the game of chance , lurking in her room , and counting the money by the glimmering light , seemed like another creature in his shape , a monstrous distortion of his image , a something to recoil from , and be the more afraid of , because it bore a likeness to him , and kept close about her , as he did . She could scarcely connect her own affectionate companion , save by his loss , with this old man , so like yet so unlike him . She had wept to see him dull and quiet . How much greater cause she had for weeping now ! The child sat watching and thinking of these things , until the phantom in her mind so increased in gloom and terror , that she felt it would be a relief to hear the old man ’s voice , or , if he were asleep , even to see him , and banish some of the fears that clustered round his image . She stole down the stairs and passage again . The door was still ajar as she had left it , and the candle burning as before . She had her own candle in her hand , prepared to say , if he were waking , that she was uneasy and could not rest , and had come to see if his were still alight . Looking into the room , she saw him lying calmly on his bed , and so took courage to enter . Fast asleep . No passion in the face , no avarice , no anxiety , no wild desire ; all gentle , tranquil , and at peace . This was not the gambler , or the shadow in her room ; this was not even the worn and jaded man whose face had so often met her own in the grey morning light ; this was her dear old friend , her harmless fellow - traveller , her good , kind grandfather . She had no fear as she looked upon his slumbering features , but she had a deep and weighty sorrow , and it found its relief in tears . ‘
109695	109708	109693	109693	him	2517	’ said the child , stooping softly to kiss his placid cheek . ‘
109753	109910	109911	109911	Grandfather	85	’ Lighting her candle , she retreated as silently as she had come , and , gaining her own room once more , sat up during the remainder of that long , long , miserable night . At last the day turned her waning candle pale , and she fell asleep . She was quickly roused by the girl who had shown her up to bed ; and , as soon as she was dressed , prepared to go down to her grandfather . But first she searched her pocket and found that her money was all gone -- not a sixpence remained . The old man was ready , and in a few seconds they were on their road . The child thought he rather avoided her eye , and appeared to expect that she would tell him of her loss . She felt she must do that , or he might suspect the truth . ‘
109913	109931	109933	109933	you	85	’ she said in a tremulous voice , after they had walked about a mile in silence , ‘
109944	109945	109935	109935	they	2520	’ ‘
109948	109955	109957	109957	I	0	’ returned the old man trembling . ‘

110076	110093	110074	110074	dear	6657	’ said the child , whose last hope was destroyed by the manner of this reply . ‘
110102	110108	110100	110100	Nell	72	’ said the old man ; ‘
110128	110129	110155	110155	Nell	72	’ ‘
110132	110137	110155	110155	Nell	72	’ replied the child . ‘
110143	110149	110138	110138	We	2529	’ said the old man , ‘
110225	110249	110212	110212	they	2532	’ he added in a compassionate tone , very different from the secret , cunning way in which he had spoken until now . ‘
110257	110303	110255	110255	Nell	72	’ The child hung down her head and wept . The sympathising tone in which he spoke , was quite sincere ; she was sure of that . It was not the lightest part of her sorrow to know that this was done for her . ‘
110315	110321	110255	110255	Nell	72	’ said the old man , ‘
110329	110334	110255	110255	Nell	72	’ he added hastily , ‘

110377	110384	110255	110255	Nell	72	’ said the child looking up . ‘

110416	110433	110395	110395	I	0	’ returned the old man , checking himself as some impetuous answer rose to his lips , ‘

110454	110460	110462	110462	you	0	’ said the child earnestly , ‘

110533	110538	110529	110529	me	0	’ said the child , ‘

110568	110583	110562	110562	We	2539	’ retorted her grandfather , still looking away and seeming to confer with himself . ‘
110590	110591	110562	110562	We	2539	’ ‘
110598	110603	110562	110562	We	2539	’ resumed the child , ‘
110649	110650	110651	110651	She	2542	’ ‘
110656	110668	110651	110651	She	2542	’ murmured the old man in the same tone as before . ‘
110686	110687	110651	110651	She	2542	’ ‘
110710	110714	110651	110651	She	2542	’ said Nell , ‘
110797	111080	111081	111081	We	2543	’ He stopped her with a motion of his hand , and bade her talk to him no more just then , for he was busy . After a time he kissed her cheek , still motioning her to silence , and walked on , looking far before him , and sometimes stopping and gazing with a puckered brow upon the ground , as if he were painfully trying to collect his disordered thoughts . Once she saw tears in his eyes . When he had gone on thus for some time , he took her hand in his as he was accustomed to do , with nothing of the violence or animation of his late manner ; and so , by degrees so fine that the child could not trace them , he settled down into his usual quiet way , and suffered her to lead him where she would . When they presented themselves in the midst of the stupendous collection , they found , as Nell had anticipated , that Mrs Jarley was not yet out of bed , and that , although she had suffered some uneasiness on their account overnight , and had indeed sat up for them until past eleven o’clock , she had retired in the persuasion , that , being overtaken by storm at some distance from home , they had sought the nearest shelter , and would not return before morning . Nell immediately applied herself with great assiduity to the decoration and preparation of the room , and had the satisfaction of completing her task , and dressing herself neatly , before the beloved of the Royal Family came down to breakfast . ‘
111086	111096	111081	111081	We	2543	’ said Mrs Jarley when the meal was over , ‘
111121	111151	111117	111122	twenty - six of ‘ em	8342	‘ em , as I was told by the cook when I asked her a question or two and put her on the free - list . We must try ‘
111176	111179	111196	111196	her	178	‘ em . ’
111556	111558	111566	111566	you	72	‘ You ’re
111569	111574	111566	111566	you	72	’ said Miss Monflathers . ‘
111579	111607	111566	111566	you	72	’ replied Nell , colouring deeply , for the young ladies had collected about her , and she was the centre on which all eyes were fixed . ‘
111622	111651	111611	111611	you	72	’ said Miss Monflathers , who was of rather uncertain temper , and lost no opportunity of impressing moral truths upon the tender minds of the young ladies , ‘
111662	111690	111611	111611	you	72	’ Poor Nell had never viewed her position in this light , and not knowing what to say , remained silent , blushing more deeply than before . ‘
111696	111701	111693	111693	you	72	’ said Miss Monflathers , ‘
111739	111831	111834	111834	you	72	’ The two teachers murmured their respectful approval of this home - thrust , and looked at Nell as though they would have said that there indeed Miss Monflathers had hit her very hard . Then they smiled and glanced at Miss Monflathers , and then , their eyes meeting , they exchanged looks which plainly said that each considered herself smiler in ordinary to Miss Monflathers , and regarded the other as having no right to smile , and that her so doing was an act of presumption and impertinence . ‘
111843	111848	111834	111834	you	72	’ resumed Miss Monflathers , ‘
111933	111934	111938	111939	the little--	2573	’ ‘
111941	111954	111938	111939	the little--	2573	’ murmured one of the teachers , in quotation from Doctor Watts . ‘
111957	111966	111938	111939	the little--	2573	’ said Miss Monflathers , turning smartly round . ‘
111971	112010	112011	112014	The little busy bee	2574	’ Of course the teacher who had not said it , indicated the rival who had , whom Miss Monflathers frowningly requested to hold her peace ; by that means throwing the informing teacher into raptures of joy . ‘
112016	112025	112011	112014	The little busy bee	2574	’ said Miss Monflathers , drawing herself up , ‘
112076	112085	112050	112050	they	2575	’ pointing to Nell , with her parasol , ‘
112135	112298	112301	112302	Miss Edwards	202	’ A deep hum of applause rose not only from the two teachers , but from all the pupils , who were equally astonished to hear Miss Monflathers improvising after this brilliant style ; for although she had been long known as a politician , she had never appeared before as an original poet . Just then somebody happened to discover that Nell was crying , and all eyes were again turned towards her . There were indeed tears in her eyes , and drawing out her handkerchief to brush them away , she happened to let it fall . Before she could stoop to pick it up , one young lady of about fifteen or sixteen , who had been standing a little apart from the others , as though she had no recognised place among them , sprang forward and put it in her hand . She was gliding timidly away again , when she was arrested by the governess . ‘
112310	112316	112301	112302	Miss Edwards	202	’ said Miss Monflathers predictively . ‘
112326	112349	112323	112324	Miss Edwards	202	’ It was Miss Edwards , and everybody said it was Miss Edwards , and Miss Edwards herself admitted that it was . ‘
112354	112372	112323	112324	Miss Edwards	202	’ said Miss Monflathers , putting down her parasol to take a severer view of the offender , ‘
112441	112442	112443	112443	I	0	’ ‘
112451	112457	112443	112443	I	0	’ said a sweet voice . ‘
112466	112467	112494	112495	the teachers	8350	’ ‘
112471	112477	112478	112478	I	0	’ repeated Miss Monflathers scornfully . ‘
112527	112538	112540	112541	the governess	8361	‘ But I would have you know , Miss Edwards , ’
112549	112645	112540	112541	the governess	8361	‘ that you can not be permitted -- if it be only for the sake of preserving a proper example and decorum in this establishment -- that you can not be permitted , and that you shall not be permitted , to fly in the face of your superiors in this exceedingly gross manner . If you have no reason to feel a becoming pride before wax - work children , there are young ladies here who have , and you must either defer to those young ladies or leave the establishment , Miss Edwards . ’
113047	113061	113063	113064	Miss Monflathers	193	‘ You will not take the air to - day , Miss Edwards , ’
113066	113085	113063	113064	Miss Monflathers	193	‘ Have the goodness to retire to your own room , and not to leave it without permission . ’
113103	113106	113095	113095	she	2620	‘ brought to ’
113115	113124	113126	113127	the governess	8361	‘ She has passed me without any salute ! ’
113136	113150	113126	113127	the governess	8361	‘ She has actually passed me without the slightest acknowledgment of my presence ! ’
113221	113230	113232	113233	Miss Monflathers	193	‘ As for you , you wicked child , ’
113239	113309	113232	113233	Miss Monflathers	193	‘ tell your mistress that if she presumes to take the liberty of sending to me any more , I will write to the legislative authorities and have her put in the stocks , or compelled to do penance in a white sheet ; and you may depend upon it that you shall certainly experience the treadmill if you dare to come here again . Now ladies , on . ’
113493	113499	113501	113502	Mrs Jarley	178	‘ I am a’most inclined , ’
113520	113530	113501	113502	Mrs Jarley	178	‘ to turn atheist when I think of it ! ’
113686	113698	113700	113701	Mrs Jarley	178	‘ For which of us is best off , I wonder , ’
113703	113762	113700	113701	Mrs Jarley	178	‘ she or me ! It ’s only talking , when all is said and done , and if she talks of me in the stocks , why I can talk of her in the stocks , which is a good deal funnier if we come to that . Lord , what does it matter , after all ! ’
113942	113947	113948	113948	he	768	‘ Get me money , ’
113959	114012	113948	113948	he	768	‘ I must have money , Nell . It shall be paid thee back with gallant interest one day , but all the money that comes into thy hands , must be mine -- not for myself , but to use for thee . Remember , Nell , to use for thee ! ’
114649	114654	114657	114657	sister	7570	‘ Are you sure you ’re
114659	114671	114657	114657	sister	7570	’ said the child as they passed where Nell was standing . ‘
114676	114680	114657	114657	sister	7570	’ she answered . ‘
114684	114689	114696	114696	you	7570	’ said the child . ‘
114702	114737	114696	114696	you	7570	’ Nell could not help following at a little distance . They went to the house of an old nurse , where the elder sister had engaged a bed - room for the child . ‘
114747	114751	114738	114738	I	0	’ she said , ‘
114761	114762	114738	114738	I	0	’ ‘
114783	115172	114775	114775	they	2673	’ Why were the eyes of little Nell wet , that night , with tears like those of the two sisters ? Why did she bear a grateful heart because they had met , and feel it pain to think that they would shortly part ? Let us not believe that any selfish reference -- unconscious though it might have been -- to her own trials awoke this sympathy , but thank God that the innocent joys of others can strongly move us , and that we , even in our fallen nature , have one source of pure emotion which must be prized in Heaven ! By morning ’s cheerful glow , but oftener still by evening ’s gentle light , the child , with a respect for the short and happy intercourse of these two sisters which forbade her to approach and say a thankful word , although she yearned to do so , followed them at a distance in their walks and rambles , stopping when they stopped , sitting on the grass when they sat down , rising when they went on , and feeling it a companionship and delight to be so near them . Their evening walk was by a river ’s side . Here , every night , the child was too , unseen by them , unthought of , unregarded ; but feeling as if they were her friends , as if they had confidences and trusts together , as if her load were lightened and less hard to bear ; as if they mingled their sorrows , and found mutual consolation . It was a weak fancy perhaps , the childish fancy of a young and lonely creature ; but night after night , and still the sisters loitered in the same place , and still the child followed with a mild and softened heart . She was much startled , on returning home one night , to find that Mrs Jarley had commanded an announcement to be prepared , to the effect that the stupendous collection would only remain in its present quarters one day longer ; in fulfilment of which threat ( for all announcements connected with public amusements are well known to be irrevocable and most exact ) , the stupendous collection shut up next day . ‘
115183	115187	115181	115181	ma’am	609	’ said Nell . ‘
115193	115198	115191	115191	child	352	’ returned Mrs Jarley . ‘
115204	115263	115191	115191	child	352	’ And so saying Mrs Jarley produced another announcement , wherein it was stated , that , in consequence of numerous inquiries at the wax - work door , and in consequence of crowds having been disappointed in obtaining admission , the Exhibition would be continued for one week longer , and would re - open next day . ‘
115280	115285	115191	115191	child	352	’ said Mrs Jarley , ‘
115298	115760	115294	115294	they	2680	’ Upon the following day at noon , Mrs Jarley established herself behind the highly - ornamented table , attended by the distinguished effigies before mentioned , and ordered the doors to be thrown open for the readmission of a discerning and enlightened public . But the first day ’s operations were by no means of a successful character , inasmuch as the general public , though they manifested a lively interest in Mrs Jarley personally , and such of her waxen satellites as were to be seen for nothing , were not affected by any impulses moving them to the payment of sixpence a head . Thus , notwithstanding that a great many people continued to stare at the entry and the figures therein displayed ; and remained there with great perseverance , by the hour at a time , to hear the barrel - organ played and to read the bills ; and notwithstanding that they were kind enough to recommend their friends to patronise the exhibition in the like manner , until the door - way was regularly blockaded by half the population of the town , who , when they went off duty , were relieved by the other half ; it was not found that the treasury was any the richer , or that the prospects of the establishment were at all encouraging . In this depressed state of the classical market , Mrs Jarley made extraordinary efforts to stimulate the popular taste , and whet the popular curiosity . Certain machinery in the body of the nun on the leads over the door was cleaned up and put in motion , so that the figure shook its head paralytically all day long , to the great admiration of a drunken , but very Protestant , barber over the way , who looked upon the said paralytic motion as typical of the degrading effect wrought upon the human mind by the ceremonies of the Romish Church and discoursed upon that theme with great eloquence and morality . The two carters constantly passed in and out of the exhibition - room , under various disguises , protesting aloud that the sight was better worth the money than anything they had beheld in all their lives , and urging the bystanders , with tears in their eyes , not to neglect such a brilliant gratification . Mrs Jarley sat in the pay - place , chinking silver moneys from noon till night , and solemnly calling upon the crowd to take notice that the price of admission was only sixpence , and that the departure of the whole collection , on a short tour among the Crowned Heads of Europe , was positively fixed for that day week . ‘
115774	115786	115294	115294	they	2680	’ said Mrs Jarley at the close of every such address . ‘
115832	116284	115294	115294	they	2680	’ CHAPTER 33 As the course of this tale requires that we should become acquainted , somewhere hereabouts , with a few particulars connected with the domestic economy of Mr Sampson Brass , and as a more convenient place than the present is not likely to occur for that purpose , the historian takes the friendly reader by the hand , and springing with him into the air , and cleaving the same at a greater rate than ever Don Cleophas Leandro Perez Zambullo and his familiar travelled through that pleasant region in company , alights with him upon the pavement of Bevis Marks . The intrepid aeronauts alight before a small dark house , once the residence of Mr Sampson Brass . In the parlour window of this little habitation , which is so close upon the footway that the passenger who takes the wall brushes the dim glass with his coat sleeve -- much to its improvement , for it is very dirty -- in this parlour window in the days of its occupation by Sampson Brass , there hung , all awry and slack , and discoloured by the sun , a curtain of faded green , so threadbare from long service as by no means to intercept the view of the little dark room , but rather to afford a favourable medium through which to observe it accurately . There was not much to look at . A rickety table , with spare bundles of papers , yellow and ragged from long carriage in the pocket , ostentatiously displayed upon its top ; a couple of stools set face to face on opposite sides of this crazy piece of furniture ; a treacherous old chair by the fire - place , whose withered arms had hugged full many a client and helped to squeeze him dry ; a second - hand wig box , used as a depository for blank writs and declarations and other small forms of law , once the sole contents of the head which belonged to the wig which belonged to the box , as they were now of the box itself ; two or three common books of practice ; a jar of ink , a pounce box , a stunted hearth - broom , a carpet trodden to shreds but still clinging with the tightness of desperation to its tacks -- these , with the yellow wainscot of the walls , the smoke - discoloured ceiling , the dust and cobwebs , were among the most prominent decorations of the office of Mr Sampson Brass . But this was mere still - life , of no greater importance than the plate , ‘
116289	116298	115294	115294	they	2680	’ upon the door , and the bill , ‘
116308	116982	115294	115294	they	2680	’ which was tied to the knocker . The office commonly held two examples of animated nature , more to the purpose of this history , and in whom it has a stronger interest and more particular concern . Of these , one was Mr Brass himself , who has already appeared in these pages . The other was his clerk , assistant , housekeeper , secretary , confidential plotter , adviser , intriguer , and bill of cost increaser , Miss Brass -- a kind of amazon at common law , of whom it may be desirable to offer a brief description . Miss Sally Brass , then , was a lady of thirty - five or thereabouts , of a gaunt and bony figure , and a resolute bearing , which if it repressed the softer emotions of love , and kept admirers at a distance , certainly inspired a feeling akin to awe in the breasts of those male strangers who had the happiness to approach her . In face she bore a striking resemblance to her brother , Sampson -- so exact , indeed , was the likeness between them , that had it consorted with Miss Brass ’s maiden modesty and gentle womanhood to have assumed her brother ’s clothes in a frolic and sat down beside him , it would have been difficult for the oldest friend of the family to determine which was Sampson and which Sally , especially as the lady carried upon her upper lip certain reddish demonstrations , which , if the imagination had been assisted by her attire , might have been mistaken for a beard . These were , however , in all probability , nothing more than eyelashes in a wrong place , as the eyes of Miss Brass were quite free from any such natural impertinencies . In complexion Miss Brass was sallow -- rather a dirty sallow , so to speak -- but this hue was agreeably relieved by the healthy glow which mantled in the extreme tip of her laughing nose . Her voice was exceedingly impressive -- deep and rich in quality , and , once heard , not easily forgotten . Her usual dress was a green gown , in colour not unlike the curtain of the office window , made tight to the figure , and terminating at the throat , where it was fastened behind by a peculiarly large and massive button . Feeling , no doubt , that simplicity and plainness are the soul of elegance , Miss Brass wore no collar or kerchief except upon her head , which was invariably ornamented with a brown gauze scarf , like the wing of the fabled vampire , and which , twisted into any form that happened to suggest itself , formed an easy and graceful head - dress . Such was Miss Brass in person . In mind , she was of a strong and vigorous turn , having from her earliest youth devoted herself with uncommon ardour to the study of law ; not wasting her speculations upon its eagle flights , which are rare , but tracing it attentively through all the slippery and eel - like crawlings in which it commonly pursues its way . Nor had she , like many persons of great intellect , confined herself to theory , or stopped short where practical usefulness begins ; inasmuch as she could ingross , fair - copy , fill up printed forms with perfect accuracy , and , in short , transact any ordinary duty of the office down to pouncing a skin of parchment or mending a pen . It is difficult to understand how , possessed of these combined attractions , she should remain Miss Brass ; but whether she had steeled her heart against mankind , or whether those who might have wooed and won her , were deterred by fears that , being learned in the law , she might have too near her fingers ’
117137	117145	117147	117148	Miss Brass	125	‘ Have you nearly done , Sammy ? ’
117169	117172	117174	117175	her brother	521	‘ No , ’
117177	117195	117174	117175	her brother	521	‘ It would have been all done though , if you had helped at the right time . ’
117196	117202	117204	117205	Miss Sally	125	‘ Oh yes , indeed , ’
117207	117227	117204	117205	Miss Sally	125	‘ you want my help , do n’t you?--YOU , too , that are going to keep a clerk ! ’
117228	117252	117254	117255	Mr Brass	127	‘ Am I going to keep a clerk for my own pleasure , or because of my own wish , you provoking rascal ! ’
117271	117285	117254	117255	Mr Brass	127	‘ What do you taunt me about going to keep a clerk for ? ’
117407	117417	117378	117379	Miss Brass	125	‘ What do you taunt me , after three hours ’
117430	117453	117378	117379	Miss Brass	125	’ repeated Mr Brass , grinning again with the pen in his mouth , like some nobleman ’s or gentleman ’s crest . ‘
117459	117460	117378	117379	Miss Brass	125	’ ‘
117466	117486	117378	117379	Miss Brass	125	’ said Miss Sally , smiling drily , for she delighted in nothing so much as irritating her brother , ‘
117535	117536	117561	117561	you	2706	’ ‘
117546	117550	117561	117561	you	2706	’ said Brass . ‘
117566	117567	117561	117561	you	2706	’ ‘
117575	117580	117582	117582	I	0	’ said his sister . ‘
117588	117609	117582	117582	I	0	’ sneered Sampson Brass , reaching over to take up the bill - book , and fluttering its leaves rapidly . ‘
117660	117680	117623	117624	Daniel Quilp	84	’ Miss Sally deigned to make no reply , but smiled again , and went on with her work . ‘
117688	117696	117682	117682	I	0	’ resumed Brass after a short silence . ‘
117698	117729	117623	117624	Daniel Quilp	84	’re afraid you wo n’t have as long a finger in the business as you ’ve been used to have . Do you think I do n’t see through that ? ’
117730	117746	117748	117749	his sister	883	‘ The business would n’t go on very long , I expect , without me , ’
117752	117769	117748	117749	his sister	883	‘ Do n’t you be a fool and provoke me , Sammy , but mind what you ’re
117776	117804	117748	117749	his sister	883	’ Sampson Brass , who was at heart in great fear of his sister , sulkily bent over his writing again , and listened as she said : ‘
117838	117871	117872	117875	a much better fellow	2711	’ Mr Brass received this observation with increased meekness , merely remarking , under his breath , that he did n’t like that kind of joking , and that Miss Sally would be ‘
117876	117991	117872	117875	a much better fellow	2711	’ if she forbore to aggravate him . To this compliment Miss Sally replied , that she had a relish for the amusement , and had no intention to forego its gratification . Mr Brass not caring , as it seemed , to pursue the subject any further , they both plied their pens at a great pace , and there the discussion ended . While they were thus employed , the window was suddenly darkened , as by some person standing close against it . As Mr Brass and Miss Sally looked up to ascertain the cause , the top sash was nimbly lowered from without , and Quilp thrust in his head . ‘
117994	118016	117872	117875	a much better fellow	2711	’ he said , standing on tip - toe on the window - sill , and looking down into the room . ‘
118041	118042	118034	118034	Brass	125	’ ‘
118049	118058	118034	118034	Brass	125	’ laughed the lawyer in an affected ecstasy . ‘
118083	118084	118080	118080	he	2717	’ ‘
118090	118101	118088	118088	Sally	125	’ croaked the dwarf , ogling the fair Miss Brass . ‘

118144	118148	118131	118133	Virgin of Bevis	205	’ cried Brass . ‘

118229	118295	118217	118217	he	2717	’ It is probable that the loss of the phoenix of clerks , even to a rival practitioner , would not have broken Mr Brass ’s heart ; but , pretending great alacrity , he rose from his seat , and going to the door , returned , introducing his client , who led by the hand no less a person than Mr Richard Swiveller . ‘
118300	118322	118297	118297	she	2722	’ said Quilp , stopping short at the door , and wrinkling up his eyebrows as he looked towards Miss Sally ; ‘
118362	118371	118358	118358	Sally	125	’ To this amorous address Miss Brass briefly responded ‘
118374	118375	118358	118358	Sally	125	’ ‘
118389	118393	118358	118358	Sally	125	’ said Quilp . ‘

118422	118432	118417	118418	Mr Quilp	84	’ returned Miss Sally , with a grim smile . ‘
118436	118447	118456	118456	Quilp	84	’re not ashamed of yourself before a strange young man . ’
118448	118454	118456	118456	Quilp	84	‘ The strange young man , ’
118463	118529	118456	118456	Quilp	84	‘ is too susceptible himself not to understand me well . This is Mr Swiveller , my intimate friend -- a gentleman of good family and great expectations , but who , having rather involved himself by youthful indiscretion , is content for a time to fill the humble station of a clerk -- humble , but here most enviable . What a delicious atmosphere ! ’
118678	118682	118684	118684	Quilp	84	‘ Mr Swiveller , ’
118686	118745	118684	118684	Quilp	84	‘ being pretty well accustomed to the agricultural pursuits of sowing wild oats , Miss Sally , prudently considers that half a loaf is better than no bread . To be out of harm ’s way he prudently thinks is something too , and therefore he accepts your brother ’s offer . Brass , Mr Swiveller is yours . ’
118746	118754	118756	118757	Mr Brass	127	‘ I am very glad , Sir , ’
118759	118793	118756	118757	Mr Brass	127	‘ very glad indeed . Mr Swiveller , Sir , is fortunate enough to have your friendship . You may be very proud , Sir , to have the friendship of Mr Quilp . ’

118947	118962	118964	118964	Quilp	84	‘ Miss Sally will teach him law , the delightful study of the law , ’
118966	118994	118964	118964	Quilp	84	‘ she ’ll be his guide , his friend , his companion , his Blackstone , his Coke upon Littleton , his Young Lawyer ’s Best Companion . ’

119134	119141	119143	119143	Quilp	84	‘ Where will Mr Swiveller sit ? ’
119148	119159	119161	119161	Brass	125	‘ Why , we ’ll buy another stool , sir , ’
119163	119241	119161	119161	Brass	125	‘ We had n’t any thoughts of having a gentleman with us , sir , until you were kind enough to suggest it , and our accommodation ’s not extensive . We ’ll look about for a second - hand stool , sir . In the meantime , if Mr Swiveller will take my seat , and try his hand at a fair copy of this ejectment , as I shall be out pretty well all the morning-- ’
119242	119247	119249	119249	Quilp	84	‘ Walk with me , ’
119251	119273	119249	119249	Quilp	84	‘ I have a word or two to say to you on points of business . Can you spare the time ? ’
119274	119288	119161	119161	Brass	125	‘ Can I spare the time to walk with you , sir ? You ’re

119360	120373	119357	119358	Mr Quilp	84	’ The dwarf glanced sarcastically at his brazen friend , and , with a short dry cough , turned upon his heel to bid adieu to Miss Sally . After a very gallant parting on his side , and a very cool and gentlemanly sort of one on hers , he nodded to Dick Swiveller , and withdrew with the attorney . Dick stood at the desk in a state of utter stupefaction , staring with all his might at the beauteous Sally , as if she had been some curious animal whose like had never lived . When the dwarf got into the street , he mounted again upon the window - sill , and looked into the office for a moment with a grinning face , as a man might peep into a cage . Dick glanced upward at him , but without any token of recognition ; and long after he had disappeared , still stood gazing upon Miss Sally Brass , seeing or thinking of nothing else , and rooted to the spot . Miss Brass being by this time deep in the bill of costs , took no notice whatever of Dick , but went scratching on , with a noisy pen , scoring down the figures with evident delight , and working like a steam - engine . There stood Dick , gazing now at the green gown , now at the brown head - dress , now at the face , and now at the rapid pen , in a state of stupid perplexity , wondering how he got into the company of that strange monster , and whether it was a dream and he would ever wake . At last he heaved a deep sigh , and began slowly pulling off his coat . Mr Swiveller pulled off his coat , and folded it up with great elaboration , staring at Miss Sally all the time ; then put on a blue jacket with a double row of gilt buttons , which he had originally ordered for aquatic expeditions , but had brought with him that morning for office purposes ; and , still keeping his eye upon her , suffered himself to drop down silently upon Mr Brass ’s stool . Then he underwent a relapse , and becoming powerless again , rested his chin upon his hand , and opened his eyes so wide , that it appeared quite out of the question that he could ever close them any more . When he had looked so long that he could see nothing , Dick took his eyes off the fair object of his amazement , turned over the leaves of the draft he was to copy , dipped his pen into the inkstand , and at last , and by slow approaches , began to write . But he had not written half - a - dozen words when , reaching over to the inkstand to take a fresh dip , he happened to raise his eyes . There was the intolerable brown head - dress -- there was the green gown -- there , in short , was Miss Sally Brass , arrayed in all her charms , and more tremendous than ever . This happened so often , that Mr Swiveller by degrees began to feel strange influences creeping over him -- horrible desires to annihilate this Sally Brass -- mysterious promptings to knock her head - dress off and try how she looked without it . There was a very large ruler on the table ; a large , black , shining ruler . Mr Swiveller took it up and began to rub his nose with it . From rubbing his nose with the ruler , to poising it in his hand and giving it an occasional flourish after the tomahawk manner , the transition was easy and natural . In some of these flourishes it went close to Miss Sally ’s head ; the ragged edges of the head - dress fluttered with the wind it raised ; advance it but an inch , and that great brown knot was on the ground : yet still the unconscious maiden worked away , and never raised her eyes . Well , this was a great relief . It was a good thing to write doggedly and obstinately until he was desperate , and then snatch up the ruler and whirl it about the brown head - dress with the consciousness that he could have it off if he liked . It was a good thing to draw it back , and rub his nose very hard with it , if he thought Miss Sally was going to look up , and to recompense himself with more hardy flourishes when he found she was still absorbed . By these means Mr Swiveller calmed the agitation of his feelings , until his applications to the ruler became less fierce and frequent , and he could even write as many as half - a - dozen consecutive lines without having recourse to it -- which was a great victory . CHAPTER 34 In course of time , that is to say , after a couple of hours or so , of diligent application , Miss Brass arrived at the conclusion of her task , and recorded the fact by wiping her pen upon the green gown , and taking a pinch of snuff from a little round tin box which she carried in her pocket . Having disposed of this temperate refreshment , she arose from her stool , tied her papers into a formal packet with red tape , and taking them under her arm , marched out of the office . Mr Swiveller had scarcely sprung off his seat and commenced the performance of a maniac hornpipe , when he was interrupted , in the fulness of his joy at being again alone , by the opening of the door , and the reappearance of Miss Sally ’s head . ‘
120379	120384	119357	119358	Mr Quilp	84	’ said Miss Brass . ‘
120390	120394	119357	119358	Mr Quilp	84	’ returned Dick . ‘
120409	120414	120407	120407	ma’am	609	’ he added inwardly . ‘
120445	120450	120443	120443	you	609	’ said Miss Brass . ‘
120456	120460	120451	120451	I	0	’ replied Dick . ‘
120468	120475	120476	120476	I	0	’ said Miss Brass , retiring . ‘
120477	120485	120489	120489	she	609	’m sorry to hear it , ma’am , ’
120495	120526	120489	120489	she	609	‘ I hope you may be unexpectedly detained , ma’am . If you could manage to be run over , ma’am , but not seriously , so much the better . ’
120567	120570	120571	120573	Brass ’s clerk	2752	‘ So I ’m
120578	120582	120583	120585	Brass ’s clerk	2752	’ said Dick . ‘
120691	120797	120798	120798	Quilp	84	’ As he was entirely alone , it may be presumed that , in these remarks , Mr Swiveller addressed himself to his fate or destiny , whom , as we learn by the precedents , it is the custom of heroes to taunt in a very bitter and ironical manner when they find themselves in situations of an unpleasant nature . This is the more probable from the circumstance of Mr Swiveller directing his observations to the ceiling , which these bodily personages are usually supposed to inhabit -- except in theatrical cases , when they live in the heart of the great chandelier . ‘
120812	120837	120838	120838	Fred	79	’ resumed Dick after a thoughtful silence , and telling off the circumstances of his position , one by one , upon his fingers ; ‘
120989	121027	121029	121030	Mr Swiveller	78	’m very glad that mine has brought all this upon itself , and I shall be as careless as I can , and make myself quite at home to spite it . So go on my buck , ’
121043	121056	121029	121030	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ and let us see which of us will be tired first ! ’
121511	121515	121517	121517	Dick	77	‘ Come in ! ’
121519	121542	121517	121517	Dick	77	‘ Do n’t stand upon ceremony . The business will get rather complicated if I ’ve many more customers . Come in ! ’

121560	121569	121493	121497	twin sister to the Dragon	2783	‘ will you come and show the lodgings ? ’
121615	121622	121624	121624	Dick	77	‘ Why , who are you ? ’
121633	121645	121624	121624	Dick	77	‘ Oh , please will you come and show the lodgings ? ’
121686	121697	121699	121699	Dick	77	‘ I hav’n’t got anything to do with the lodgings , ’

122262	122268	122270	122271	Richard Swiveller	78	‘ I believe , sir , ’
122281	122348	122270	122271	Richard Swiveller	78	‘ that you desire to look at these apartments . They are very charming apartments , sir . They command an uninterrupted view of -- of over the way , and they are within one minute ’s walk of -- of the corner of the street . There is exceedingly mild porter , sir , in the immediate vicinity , and the contingent advantages are extraordinary . ’
122349	122355	122357	122359	the single gentleman	2796	‘ What ’s the rent ? ’
122361	122367	122369	122369	Dick	77	‘ One pound per week , ’

122411	122417	122369	122369	Dick	77	’ answered the single gentleman . ‘
122422	122426	122369	122369	Dick	77	’ said Dick , ‘

122434	122448	122369	122369	Dick	77	’ cried the single gentleman gruffly , eyeing him from top to toe . ‘

122477	122481	122474	122474	you	2809	’ said Dick , ‘

122523	122528	122530	122532	the single gentleman	2796	’m glad of it , ’
122534	122556	122530	122532	the single gentleman	2796	‘ it ’s a good name for a lawyer . Coachman , you may go . So may you , Sir . ’
122696	122702	122704	122704	his	2796	‘ Take down the bill , ’
122717	122729	122709	122709	he	2796	‘ and let nobody call me till I ring the bell . ’
122743	122755	122761	122761	he	78	‘ This is a most remarkable and supernatural sort of house ! ’
122773	122891	122761	122761	he	78	‘ She - dragons in the business , conducting themselves like professional gentlemen ; plain cooks of three feet high appearing mysteriously from under ground ; strangers walking in and going to bed without leave or licence in the middle of the day ! If he should be one of the miraculous fellows that turn up now and then , and has gone to sleep for two years , I shall be in a pleasant situation . It ’s my destiny , however , and I hope Brass may like it . I shall be sorry if he do n’t . But it ’s no business of mine -- I have nothing whatever to do with it ! ’
122994	123000	122971	122971	he	127	‘ one of these days , ’
123135	123417	123439	123439	Sally	125	’ ends , he might certainly be said to have it anywhere but in his face : which being , as we have already seen , of a harsh and repulsive character , was not oiled so easily , but frowned above all the smooth speeches -- one of nature ’s beacons , warning off those who navigated the shoals and breakers of the World , or of that dangerous strait the Law , and admonishing them to seek less treacherous harbours and try their fortune elsewhere . While Mr Brass by turns overwhelmed his clerk with compliments and inspected the ten - pound note , Miss Sally showed little emotion and that of no pleasurable kind , for as the tendency of her legal practice had been to fix her thoughts on small gains and gripings , and to whet and sharpen her natural wisdom , she was not a little disappointed that the single gentleman had obtained the lodgings at such an easy rate , arguing that when he was seen to have set his mind upon them , he should have been at the least charged double or treble the usual terms , and that , in exact proportion as he pressed forward , Mr Swiveller should have hung back . But neither the good opinion of Mr Brass , nor the dissatisfaction of Miss Sally , wrought any impression upon that young gentleman , who , throwing the responsibility of this and all other acts and deeds thereafter to be done by him , upon his unlucky destiny , was quite resigned and comfortable : fully prepared for the worst , and philosophically indifferent to the best . ‘
123424	123438	123421	123422	Mr Richard	78	’ said Brass , on the second day of Mr Swiveller ’s clerkship . ‘

123633	123637	123631	123631	Sir	5863	’ retorted Brass . ‘

124019	124039	124017	124017	Dick	77	‘ I suppose he may sleep his ten pound out , in peace and quietness , if he likes . ’

124253	124281	124230	124231	the gentleman	518	’ Dick did so , and handed it to Mr Brass , who had dismounted from his stool , and was walking up and down the office . ‘
124292	124303	124230	124231	the gentleman	518	’ said Brass , running his eye over the document . ‘

124354	124358	124352	124352	Sir	5863	’ replied Dick . ‘
124364	124368	124352	124352	Sir	5863	’ said Brass ; ‘

124512	124537	124461	124462	the gentleman	518	’ said Miss Sally . Dick looked at her , and then at Brass , and then at Miss Sally again , and still said ‘
124540	124541	124461	124462	the gentleman	518	’ ‘
124558	124567	124569	124569	he	518	’ cried Brass , relaxing into a smile . ‘
124576	124577	124569	124569	he	518	’ ‘
124586	124596	124598	124598	he	518	’ said Miss Sally , nodding to her brother . ‘
124604	124729	124731	124731	Brass	125	’ added Brass , in a kind of comfortable , cozy tone--‘I do n’t assert that he did say so , mind ; I only ask you , to refresh your memory -- did he say , for instance , that he was a stranger in London -- that it was not his humour or within his ability to give any references -- that he felt we had a right to require them -- and that , in case anything should happen to him , at any time , he particularly desired that whatever property he had upon the premises should be considered mine , as some slight recompense for the trouble and annoyance I should sustain -- and were you , in short , ’
124741	124760	124731	124731	Brass	125	‘ were you induced to accept him on my behalf , as a tenant , upon those conditions ? ’
124761	124765	124767	124767	Dick	77	‘ Certainly not , ’
124769	124776	124778	124778	Brass	125	‘ Why then , Mr Richard , ’
124789	124808	124778	124778	Brass	125	‘ it ’s my opinion that you ’ve mistaken your calling , and will never make a lawyer . ’
124809	124818	124820	124821	Miss Sally	125	‘ Not if you live a thousand years , ’
124920	124924	124926	124926	Brass	125	‘ Mr Richard , ’
124928	124949	124926	124926	Brass	125	‘ this man ’s not up yet . Nothing will wake him , sir . What ’s to be done ? ’
124950	124960	124962	124962	Dick	77	‘ I should let him have his sleep out , ’
124964	124968	124970	124970	Brass	125	‘ Sleep out ! ’
124972	125042	124970	124970	Brass	125	‘ why he has been asleep now , six - and - twenty hours . We have been moving chests of drawers over his head , we have knocked double knocks at the street - door , we have made the servant - girl fall down stairs several times ( she ’s a light weight , and it do n’t hurt her much , ) but nothing wakes him . ’
125043	125048	125050	125050	Dick	77	‘ Perhaps a ladder , ’
125052	125062	125050	125050	Dick	77	‘ and getting in at the first - floor window-- ’
125063	125082	125084	125084	Brass	125	‘ But then there ’s a door between ; besides , the neighbours would be up in arms , ’
125086	125111	125113	125113	Dick	77	‘ What do you say to getting on the roof of the house through the trap - door , and dropping down the chimney ? ’
125115	125123	125125	125125	Brass	125	‘ That would be an excellent plan , ’
125127	125132	125125	125125	Brass	125	‘ if anybody would be-- ’
125171	125303	125156	125156	I	0	’ Dick had made the suggestion , thinking that the duty might possibly fall within Miss Sally ’s department . As he said nothing further , and declined taking the hint , Mr Brass was fain to propose that they should go up stairs together , and make a last effort to awaken the sleeper by some less violent means , which , if they failed on this last trial , must positively be succeeded by stronger measures . Mr Swiveller , assenting , armed himself with his stool and the large ruler , and repaired with his employer to the scene of action , where Miss Brass was already ringing a hand - bell with all her might , and yet without producing the smallest effect upon their mysterious lodger . ‘
125312	125316	125309	125310	Mr Richard	78	’ said Brass . ‘
125326	125391	125392	125392	I	0	’ quoth Richard Swiveller . And truly , they were as sturdy and bluff a pair of boots as one would wish to see ; as firmly planted on the ground as if their owner ’s legs and feet had been in them ; and seeming , with their broad soles and blunt toes , to hold possession of their place by main force . ‘
125404	125418	125392	125392	I	0	’ said Brass , applying his eye to the keyhole of the door . ‘

126039	126080	126023	126025	the single gentleman	2796	‘ I do n’t wish to hold out any threats , sir -- indeed the law does not allow of threats , for to threaten is an indictable offence -- but if ever you do that again , take care you ’re
126110	126120	126108	126108	Sir	5863	’ said Dick , gently sliding to the ground , ‘

126158	126163	126166	126166	Sir	5863	’ cried the lodger . ‘
126170	126184	126166	126166	Sir	5863	’ returned Dick , yielding to his destiny and saying whatever came uppermost ; ‘
126203	126221	126234	126235	the lodger	8555	’re going to sleep in that way , you must pay for a double - bedded room . ’
126393	126401	126408	126408	he	8555	‘ Come here , you impudent rascal ! ’
126462	126468	126470	126470	his	78	‘ Can you drink anything ? ’
126496	126501	126517	126518	the lodger	8555	‘ a modest quencher , ’
126685	126688	126690	126691	the lodger	8555	‘ Hot water-- ’
126728	126783	126784	126788	The man of the house	2915	’ Dick complied , his eyes wandering all the time from the temple on the table , which seemed to do everything , to the great trunk which seemed to hold everything . The lodger took his breakfast like a man who was used to work these miracles , and thought nothing of them . ‘
126797	126810	126811	126815	The woman of the house	2917	’ said the lodger . Dick nodded . The rum was amazing . ‘

126826	126862	126823	126824	A dragon	2919	’ said Dick . The single gentleman , perhaps because he had met with such things in his travels , or perhaps because he WAS a single gentleman , evinced no surprise , but merely inquired ‘
126867	126874	126876	126878	the single gentleman	2796	’ said Dick.--‘So much the better , ’
126880	126891	126876	126878	the single gentleman	2796	‘ he can get rid of her when he likes . ’
126892	126904	126905	126905	he	2796	‘ I want to do as I like , young man , ’
126912	126967	126905	126905	he	2796	‘ to go to bed when I like , get up when I like , come in when I like , go out when I like -- to be asked no questions and be surrounded by no spies . In this last respect , servants are the devil . There ’s only one here . ’
126968	126975	126977	126977	Dick	77	‘ And a very little one , ’
126979	126986	126988	126989	the lodger	8555	‘ And a very little one , ’
126991	127003	126988	126989	the lodger	8555	‘ Well , the place will suit me , will it ? ’
127004	127007	127009	127009	Dick	77	‘ Yes , ’
127011	127017	127019	127020	the lodger	8555	‘ Sharks , I suppose ? ’

127098	127104	127106	127106	Dick	77	‘ I beg your pardon , ’

127135	127141	127040	127042	the single gentleman	2796	‘ What do you mean ? ’
127142	127147	127149	127149	Dick--‘has	215	‘ --But the name , ’

127168	127173	127163	127163	I	0	’ returned the lodger . ‘
127182	127183	127178	127178	anybody	451	’ ‘
127190	127191	127184	127184	Nobody	5885	’ ‘
127213	127223	127211	127211	Sir	5863	’ added Dick , still lingering.--‘Oh blame not the bard-- ’
127224	127230	127232	127233	the lodger	8555	‘ I ’ll blame nobody , ’
127665	127822	127823	127823	Swiveller	78	’ occupation of his lodgings , still declined to correspond , by word or gesture , either with Mr Brass or his sister Sally , but invariably chose Richard Swiveller as his channel of communication ; and as he proved himself in all respects a highly desirable inmate , paying for everything beforehand , giving very little trouble , making no noise , and keeping early hours ; Mr Richard imperceptibly rose to an important position in the family , as one who had influence over this mysterious lodger , and could negotiate with him , for good or evil , when nobody else durst approach his person . If the truth must be told , even Mr Swiveller ’s approaches to the single gentleman were of a very distant kind , and met with small encouragement ; but , as he never returned from a monosyllabic conference with the unknown , without quoting such expressions as ‘
127862	128189	127858	127858	I	0	’ with many other short speeches of the same familiar and confiding kind , purporting to have been addressed by the single gentleman to himself , and to form the staple of their ordinary discourse , neither Mr Brass nor Miss Sally for a moment questioned the extent of his influence , but accorded to him their fullest and most unqualified belief . But quite apart from , and independent of , this source of popularity , Mr Swiveller had another , which promised to be equally enduring , and to lighten his position considerably . He found favour in the eyes of Miss Sally Brass . Let not the light scorners of female fascination erect their ears to listen to a new tale of love which shall serve them for a jest ; for Miss Brass , however accurately formed to be beloved , was not of the loving kind . That amiable virgin , having clung to the skirts of the Law from her earliest youth ; having sustained herself by their aid , as it were , in her first running alone , and maintained a firm grasp upon them ever since ; had passed her life in a kind of legal childhood . She had been remarkable , when a tender prattler for an uncommon talent in counterfeiting the walk and manner of a bailiff : in which character she had learned to tap her little playfellows on the shoulder , and to carry them off to imaginary sponging - houses , with a correctness of imitation which was the surprise and delight of all who witnessed her performances , and which was only to be exceeded by her exquisite manner of putting an execution into her doll ’s house , and taking an exact inventory of the chairs and tables . These artless sports had naturally soothed and cheered the decline of her widowed father : a most exemplary gentleman ( called ‘
128192	128877	127858	127858	I	0	’ by his friends from his extreme sagacity , ) who encouraged them to the utmost , and whose chief regret , on finding that he drew near to Houndsditch churchyard , was , that his daughter could not take out an attorney ’s certificate and hold a place upon the roll . Filled with this affectionate and touching sorrow , he had solemnly confided her to his son Sampson as an invaluable auxiliary ; and from the old gentleman ’s decease to the period of which we treat , Miss Sally Brass had been the prop and pillar of his business . It is obvious that , having devoted herself from infancy to this one pursuit and study , Miss Brass could know but little of the world , otherwise than in connection with the law ; and that from a lady gifted with such high tastes , proficiency in those gentler and softer arts in which women usually excel , was scarcely to be looked for . Miss Sally ’s accomplishments were all of a masculine and strictly legal kind . They began with the practice of an attorney and they ended with it . She was in a state of lawful innocence , so to speak . The law had been her nurse . And , as bandy - legs or such physical deformities in children are held to be the consequence of bad nursing , so , if in a mind so beautiful any moral twist or handiness could be found , Miss Sally Brass ’s nurse was alone to blame . It was upon this lady , then , that Mr Swiveller burst in full freshness as something new and hitherto undreamed of , lighting up the office with scraps of song and merriment , conjuring with inkstands and boxes of wafers , catching three oranges in one hand , balancing stools upon his chin and penknives on his nose , and constantly performing a hundred other feats with equal ingenuity ; for with such unbendings did Richard , in Mr Brass ’s absence , relieve the tedium of his confinement . These social qualities , which Miss Sally first discovered by accident , gradually made such an impression upon her , that she would entreat Mr Swiveller to relax as though she were not by , which Mr Swiveller , nothing loth , would readily consent to do . By these means a friendship sprung up between them . Mr Swiveller gradually came to look upon her as her brother Sampson did , and as he would have looked upon any other clerk . He imparted to her the mystery of going the odd man or plain Newmarket for fruit , ginger - beer , baked potatoes , or even a modest quencher , of which Miss Brass did not scruple to partake . He would often persuade her to undertake his share of writing in addition to her own ; nay , he would sometimes reward her with a hearty slap on the back , and protest that she was a devilish good fellow , a jolly dog , and so forth ; all of which compliments Miss Sally would receive in entire good part and with perfect satisfaction . One circumstance troubled Mr Swiveller ’s mind very much , and that was that the small servant always remained somewhere in the bowels of the earth under Bevis Marks , and never came to the surface unless the single gentleman rang his bell , when she would answer it and immediately disappear again . She never went out , or came into the office , or had a clean face , or took off the coarse apron , or looked out of any one of the windows , or stood at the street - door for a breath of air , or had any rest or enjoyment whatever . Nobody ever came to see her , nobody spoke of her , nobody cared about her . Mr Brass had said once , that he believed she was a ‘
128881	128904	128971	128971	She	2784	’ ( which means anything but a child of love ) , and that was all the information Richard Swiveller could obtain . ‘
128914	128931	128932	128932	I	0	’ thought Dick one day , as he sat contemplating the features of Miss Sally Brass . ‘
129018	129019	129015	129016	a dragon	2919	’ ‘
129028	129052	129025	129026	old fellow	2947	’ said Dick aloud , as Miss Sally wiped her pen as usual on the green dress , and uprose from her seat . ‘
129056	129061	129025	129026	old fellow	2947	’ answered the dragon . ‘
129065	129069	129015	129016	a dragon	2919	’ thought Dick , ‘
129088	129089	129075	129075	I	0	’ ‘
129096	129101	129090	129090	Sammy	127	’ said Miss Brass . ‘
129113	129148	129108	129108	I	0	’ Dick nodded , and followed Miss Brass -- with his eyes to the door , and with his ears to a little back parlour , where she and her brother took their meals . ‘
129151	129166	129108	129108	I	0	’ said Dick , walking up and down with his hands in his pockets , ‘
129206	129236	129238	129239	Mr Swiveller	78	’m marked with a note of interrogation somewhere . My feelings I smother , but thou hast been the cause of this anguish , my -- upon my word , ’
129252	129263	129238	129239	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ I should like to know how they use her ! ’
129323	129328	129330	129330	Dick	77	‘ And by Jove ! ’
129332	129346	129330	129330	Dick	77	‘ she ’s going to feed the small servant . Now or never ! ’
129578	129583	129585	129586	Miss Sally	125	‘ Are you there ? ’
129588	129593	129585	129586	Miss Sally	125	‘ Yes , ma’am , ’
129602	129622	129624	129625	Miss Sally	125	‘ Go further away from the leg of mutton , or you ’ll be picking it , I know , ’
129705	129711	129713	129714	Miss Brass	125	‘ Do you see this ? ’
129769	129772	129751	129751	her	2874	‘ yes . ’
129773	129783	129785	129786	Miss Sally	125	‘ Then do n’t you ever go and say , ’
129788	129802	129785	129786	Miss Sally	125	‘ that you had n’t meat here . There , eat it up . ’
129808	129817	129819	129820	Miss Sally	125	‘ Now , do you want any more ? ’
129829	129832	129822	129824	The hungry creature	2969	‘ No . ’
129842	129851	129853	129854	Miss Brass	125	‘ You ’ve been helped once to meat , ’
129861	129873	129853	129854	Miss Brass	125	‘ you have had as much as you can eat , you ’re
129885	129888	129882	129882	you	2874	‘ no ! ’
129904	130790	129882	129882	you	2874	’ With those words , Miss Sally put the meat away and locked the safe , and then drawing near to the small servant , overlooked her while she finished the potatoes . It was plain that some extraordinary grudge was working in Miss Brass ’s gentle breast , and that it was that which impelled her , without the smallest present cause , to rap the child with the blade of the knife , now on her hand , now on her head , and now on her back , as if she found it quite impossible to stand so close to her without administering a few slight knocks . But Mr Swiveller was not a little surprised to see his fellow - clerk , after walking slowly backwards towards the door , as if she were trying to withdraw herself from the room but could not accomplish it , dart suddenly forward , and falling on the small servant give her some hard blows with her clenched hand . The victim cried , but in a subdued manner as if she feared to raise her voice , and Miss Sally , comforting herself with a pinch of snuff , ascended the stairs , just as Richard had safely reached the office . CHAPTER 37 The single gentleman among his other peculiarities -- and he had a very plentiful stock , of which he every day furnished some new specimen -- took a most extraordinary and remarkable interest in the exhibition of Punch . If the sound of a Punch ’s voice , at ever so remote a distance , reached Bevis Marks , the single gentleman , though in bed and asleep , would start up , and , hurrying on his clothes , make for the spot with all speed , and presently return at the head of a long procession of idlers , having in the midst the theatre and its proprietors . Straightway , the stage would be set up in front of Mr Brass ’s house ; the single gentleman would establish himself at the first floor window ; and the entertainment would proceed , with all its exciting accompaniments of fife and drum and shout , to the excessive consternation of all sober votaries of business in that silent thoroughfare . It might have been expected that when the play was done , both players and audience would have dispersed ; but the epilogue was as bad as the play , for no sooner was the Devil dead , than the manager of the puppets and his partner were summoned by the single gentleman to his chamber , where they were regaled with strong waters from his private store , and where they held with him long conversations , the purport of which no human being could fathom . But the secret of these discussions was of little importance . It was sufficient to know that while they were proceeding , the concourse without still lingered round the house ; that boys beat upon the drum with their fists , and imitated Punch with their tender voices ; that the office - window was rendered opaque by flattened noses , and the key - hole of the street - door luminous with eyes ; that every time the single gentleman or either of his guests was seen at the upper window , or so much as the end of one of their noses was visible , there was a great shout of execration from the excluded mob , who remained howling and yelling , and refusing consolation , until the exhibitors were delivered up to them to be attended elsewhere . It was sufficient , in short , to know that Bevis Marks was revolutionised by these popular movements , and that peace and quietness fled from its precincts . Nobody was rendered more indignant by these proceedings than Mr Sampson Brass , who , as he could by no means afford to lose so profitable an inmate , deemed it prudent to pocket his lodger ’s affront along with his cash , and to annoy the audiences who clustered round his door by such imperfect means of retaliation as were open to him , and which were confined to the trickling down of foul water on their heads from unseen watering pots , pelting them with fragments of tile and mortar from the roof of the house , and bribing the drivers of hackney cabriolets to come suddenly round the corner and dash in among them precipitately . It may , at first sight , be matter of surprise to the thoughtless few that Mr Brass , being a professional gentleman , should not have legally indicted some party or parties , active in the promotion of the nuisance , but they will be good enough to remember , that as Doctors seldom take their own prescriptions , and Divines do not always practise what they preach , so lawyers are shy of meddling with the Law on their own account : knowing it to be an edged tool of uncertain application , very expensive in the working , and rather remarkable for its properties of close shaving , than for its always shaving the right person . ‘
130793	130800	129882	129882	you	2874	’ said Mr Brass one afternoon , ‘
130810	130817	129882	129882	you	2874	’m in hopes he has run through ‘
130824	130825	130809	130809	I	0	’ ‘
130832	130837	130828	130828	you	0	’ returned Miss Sally . ‘
130844	130845	130841	130841	they	2971	’ ‘
130855	130866	130848	130853	a pretty sort of a fellow	2972	’ cried Brass , laying down his pen in despair . ‘
130874	130875	130870	130872	an aggravating animal	2973	’ ‘
130884	130888	130881	130881	they	2971	’ retorted Sally . ‘
130892	130896	130881	130881	they	2971	’ cried Brass . ‘
130962	130963	130964	130964	Brass	125	’ ‘
130966	130971	130964	130964	Brass	125	’ suggested Mr Swiveller . ‘
130977	131005	130964	130964	Brass	125	’ said the lawyer , glancing at his clerk , to assure himself that he had suggested the word in good faith and without any sinister intention . ‘
131011	131052	130964	130964	Brass	125	’ The lawyer stopped short in his invective , and listening for a moment , and recognising the well - known voice , rested his head upon his hand , raised his eyes to the ceiling , and muttered faintly , ‘
131057	131067	130964	130964	Brass	125	’ Up went the single gentleman ’s window directly . ‘
131072	131076	130964	130964	Brass	125	’ repeated Brass ; ‘
131112	131167	130964	130964	Brass	125	’ The distant squeak was heard again . The single gentleman ’s door burst open . He ran violently down the stairs , out into the street , and so past the window , without any hat , towards the quarter whence the sound proceeded -- bent , no doubt , upon securing the strangers ’
131171	131182	131184	131184	Sampson	127	‘ I wish I only knew who his friends were , ’
131192	131235	131184	131184	Sampson	127	‘ if they ’d just get up a pretty little Commission de lunatico at the Gray ’s Inn Coffee House and give me the job , I ’d be content to have the lodgings empty for one while , at all events . ’
131648	131653	131654	131654	he	8555	‘ Both of you , ’
131677	131690	131654	131654	he	8555	‘ I want to talk to you . Come both of you ! ’
131691	131696	131698	131700	the little man	6029	‘ Come , Tommy , ’
131702	131708	131710	131711	the other	5966	‘ I an’t a talker , ’
131713	131726	131710	131711	the other	5966	‘ Tell him so . What should I go and talk for ? ’
131727	131743	131745	131747	the little man	6029	‘ Do n’t you see the gentleman ’s got a bottle and glass up there ? ’
131749	131760	131762	131763	the other	5966	‘ And could n’t you have said so at first ? ’
131768	131795	131762	131763	the other	5966	‘ Now , what are you waiting for ? Are you going to keep the gentleman expecting us all day ? have n’t you no manners ? ’
131842	131848	131850	131852	the single gentleman	2796	‘ Now , my men , ’
131854	131877	131850	131852	the single gentleman	2796	‘ you have done very well . What will you take ? Tell that little man behind , to shut the door . ’
131878	131887	131889	131890	Mr Codlin	144	‘ Shut the door , ca n’t you ? ’
131898	131918	131889	131890	Mr Codlin	144	‘ You might have knowed that the gentleman wanted the door shut , without being told , I think . ’
131932	131935	131928	131929	his friend	5985	‘ cranky , ’
132050	132052	132026	132028	the single gentleman	2796	‘ You ’re
132064	132069	132062	132062	you	3008	’ said their entertainer . ‘
132075	132114	132071	132071	you	3008	’ Mr Short replied in the affirmative with a nod and a smile . Mr Codlin added a corroborative nod and a short groan , as if he still felt the weight of the Temple on his shoulders . ‘
132129	132135	132138	132138	sir	5863	’ pursued the single gentleman . ‘
132140	132144	132138	132138	sir	5863	’ returned Short , ‘
132154	132155	132138	132138	sir	5863	’ ‘
132172	132183	132156	132156	I	0	’ returned their host , in rather a hasty manner ; ‘
132195	132196	132185	132185	I	0	’ ‘
132209	132213	132207	132207	master	5881	’ said Short ; ‘
132269	132270	132272	132272	me	0	’ ‘
132278	132279	132272	132272	me	0	’ ‘
132291	132307	132308	132308	I	0	’ said Mr Codlin , suddenly thrusting in his own and turning Short ’s aside . ‘
132309	132403	132272	132272	me	0	’m the sufferer , sir , in all the travelling , and in all the staying at home . In town or country , wet or dry , hot or cold , Tom Codlin suffers . But Tom Codlin is n’t to complain for all that . Oh , no ! Short may complain , but if Codlin grumbles by so much as a word -- oh dear , down with him , down with him directly . It is n’t his place to grumble . That ’s quite out of the question . ’
132404	132411	132413	132413	Short	149	‘ Codlin an’t without his usefulness , ’
132419	132445	132413	132413	Short	149	‘ but he do n’t always keep his eyes open . He falls asleep sometimes , you know . Remember them last races , Tommy . ’
132446	132456	132458	132458	Codlin	144	‘ Will you never leave off aggravating a man ? ’
132460	132555	132458	132458	Codlin	144	‘ It ’s very like I was asleep when five - and - tenpence was collected , in one round , is n’t it ? I was attending to my business , and could n’t have my eyes in twenty places at once , like a peacock , no more than you could . If I an’t a match for an old man and a young child , you an’t neither , so do n’t throw that out against me , for the cap fits your head quite as correct as it fits mine . ’
132556	132567	132569	132569	Short	149	‘ You may as well drop the subject , Tom , ’
132571	132585	132569	132569	Short	149	‘ It is n’t particular agreeable to the gentleman , I dare say . ’
132586	132596	132598	132599	Mr Codlin	144	‘ Then you should n’t have brought it up , ’
132601	132640	132598	132599	Mr Codlin	144	‘ and I ask the gentleman ’s pardon on your account , as a giddy chap that likes to hear himself talk , and do n’t much care what he talks about , so that he does talk . ’
132723	132732	132733	132733	he	144	‘ You are the two men I want , ’
132736	132762	132733	132733	he	144	‘ the two men I have been looking for , and searching after ! Where are that old man and that child you speak of ? ’
132763	132766	132768	132768	Short	149	‘ Sir ? ’
132778	132861	132768	132768	Short	149	‘ The old man and his grandchild who travelled with you -- where are they ? It will be worth your while to speak out , I assure you ; much better worth your while than you believe . They left you , you say -- at those races , as I understand . They have been traced to that place , and there lost sight of . Have you no clue , can you suggest no clue , to their recovery ? ’
132862	132870	132872	132872	Short	149	‘ Did I always say , Thomas , ’
132884	132898	132872	132872	Short	149	‘ that there was sure to be an inquiry after them two travellers ? ’
132899	132903	132905	132906	Mr Codlin	144	‘ YOU said ! ’
132908	132915	132905	132906	Mr Codlin	144	‘ Did I always say that that ‘
133031	133093	133012	133012	she	3028	’ Repeating these words with great emotion , Mr Codlin rubbed the bridge of his nose with his coat - sleeve , and shaking his head mournfully from side to side , left the single gentleman to infer that , from the moment when he lost sight of his dear young charge , his peace of mind and happiness had fled . ‘
133097	133110	133012	133012	she	3028	’ said the single gentleman , pacing up and down the room , ‘
133166	133167	133177	133183	A man of the name of Jerry	3032	’ ‘
133172	133176	133177	133183	A man of the name of Jerry	3032	’ said Short . ‘
133191	133192	133187	133187	Jerry	151	’ ‘
133203	133208	133187	133187	Jerry	151	’ replied Mr Codlin . ‘
133225	133278	133280	133281	that gentleman	903	‘ ere darling child ? “ Codlin ’s my friend , ” she says , “ dear , good , kind Codlin , as is always a devising pleasures for me ! I do n’t object to Short , ” she says , “ but I cotton to Codlin . ” Once , ’
133284	133298	133280	133281	that gentleman	903	‘ she called me Father Codlin . I thought I should have bust ! ’
133299	133310	133312	133312	Short	149	‘ A man of the name of Jerry , sir , ’
133324	133411	133312	133312	Short	149	‘ wot keeps a company of dancing dogs , told me , in a accidental sort of way , that he had seen the old gentleman in connexion with a travelling wax - work , unbeknown to him . As they ’d given us the slip , and nothing had come of it , and this was down in the country that he ’d been seen , I took no measures about it , and asked no questions -- But I can , if you like . ’
133412	133419	133421	133424	the impatient single gentleman	3037	‘ Is this man in town ? ’
133426	133430	133421	133424	the impatient single gentleman	3037	‘ Speak faster . ’
133431	133452	133454	133455	Mr Short	149	‘ No he is n’t , but he will be to - morrow , for he lodges in our house , ’
133458	133464	133466	133468	the single gentleman	2796	‘ Then bring him here , ’
133470	133543	133466	133468	the single gentleman	2796	‘ Here ’s a sovereign a - piece . If I can find these people through your means , it is but a prelude to twenty more . Return to me to - morrow , and keep your own counsel on this subject -- though I need hardly tell you that ; for you ’ll do so for your own sakes . Now , give me your address , and leave me . ’
134832	134837	134858	134859	the Notary	1334	‘ taking a sight , ’
134902	134944	134892	134893	Mr Chuckster	139	‘ Woa - a - a - a - a - a!’--dwelling upon the note a long time , for the purpose of striking terror into the pony ’s heart , and asserting the supremacy of man over the inferior animals . ‘
134950	134960	134892	134893	Mr Chuckster	139	’ cried Mr Chuckster , addressing himself to Kit . ‘
134962	134967	134892	134893	Mr Chuckster	139	’re wanted inside here . ’
134968	134978	134980	134980	Kit	75	‘ Has Mr Abel forgotten anything , I wonder ? ’
134985	134992	134994	134995	Mr Chuckster	139	‘ Ask no questions , Snobby , ’
134997	135024	134994	134995	Mr Chuckster	139	‘ but go and see . Woa - a - a then , will you ? If that pony was mine , I ’d break him . ’
135025	135038	135040	135040	Kit	75	‘ You must be very gentle with him , if you please , ’
135042	135070	135040	135040	Kit	75	‘ or you ’ll find him troublesome . You ’d better not keep on pulling his ears , please . I know he wo n’t like it . ’
135091	135095	135083	135083	Kit	75	‘ young feller , ’
135109	135112	135108	135112	The ‘ young feller ’	8771	‘ young feller ’
135189	135197	135199	135200	Mr Witherden	137	‘ Oh ! come in , Christopher , ’
135202	135208	135210	135212	an elderly gentleman	3120	‘ Is that the lad ? ’
135228	135234	135236	135237	Mr Witherden	137	‘ That ’s the lad , ’
135239	135308	135310	135311	the Notary	1334	‘ He fell in with my client , Mr Garland , sir , at this very door . I have reason to think he is a good lad , sir , and that you may believe what he says . Let me introduce Mr Abel Garland , sir -- his young master ; my articled pupil , sir , and most particular friend:--my most particular friend , sir , ’
135325	135331	135333	135335	the stranger gentleman	3124	‘ Your servant , sir , ’
135337	135343	135333	135335	the stranger gentleman	3124	‘ Yours , sir , I ’m
135346	135352	135333	135335	the stranger gentleman	3124	’ replied Mr Abel mildly . ‘
135363	135364	135361	135361	sir	5863	’ ‘
135375	135376	135371	135371	I	0	’ ‘

135401	135418	135390	135390	I	0	’ said the stranger , observing that Mr Abel and the Notary were preparing to retire . ‘
135474	135475	135469	135469	you	3124	’ ‘

135571	135572	135573	135573	I	0	’ ‘
135583	135588	135581	135581	sir	5863	’ said the Notary , ‘
135598	135599	135600	135600	Sir	5863	’ ‘
135602	135607	135600	135600	Sir	5863	’ retorted the stranger , ‘
135641	135642	135643	135643	Hem	119	’ ‘
135645	135650	135651	135651	You	5863	’ coughed the Notary . ‘
135652	135659	135643	135643	Hem	119	’re a plain speaker , sir . ’
135660	135666	135668	135669	the stranger	8786	‘ And a plain dealer , ’
135671	135727	135668	135669	the stranger	8786	‘ It may be my long absence and inexperience that lead me to the conclusion ; but if plain speakers are scarce in this part of the world , I fancy plain dealers are still scarcer . If my speaking should offend you , sir , my dealing , I hope , will make amends . ’
135809	135874	135875	135875	he	137	‘ If you think , my lad , that I am pursuing these inquiries with any other view than that of serving and reclaiming those I am in search of , you do me a very great wrong , and deceive yourself . Do n’t be deceived , I beg of you , but rely upon my assurance . The fact is , gentlemen , ’
135887	136040	135875	135875	he	137	‘ that I am in a very painful and wholly unexpected position . I came to this city with a darling object at my heart , expecting to find no obstacle or difficulty in the way of its attainment . I find myself suddenly checked and stopped short , in the execution of my design , by a mystery which I can not penetrate . Every effort I have made to penetrate it , has only served to render it darker and more obscure ; and I am afraid to stir openly in the matter , lest those whom I anxiously pursue , should fly still farther from me . I assure you that if you could give me any assistance , you would not be sorry to do so , if you knew how greatly I stand in need of it , and what a load it would relieve me from . ’
136226	136231	136233	136234	the gentleman	518	‘ Not by inquiry , ’
136239	136244	136233	136234	the gentleman	518	‘ I live there . ’
136245	136254	136256	136257	Mr Witherden	137	‘ Live at Brass ’s the attorney ’s ! ’
136271	136274	136233	136234	the gentleman	518	‘ Aye , ’
136279	136345	136233	136234	the gentleman	518	‘ I entered on his lodgings t’other day , chiefly because I had seen this very board . It matters little to me where I live , and I had a desperate hope that some intelligence might be cast in my way there , which would not reach me elsewhere . Yes , I live at Brass’s -- more shame for me , I suppose ? ’
136346	136355	136357	136358	the Notary	1334	‘ That ’s a mere matter of opinion , ’
136364	136375	136357	136358	the Notary	1334	‘ He is looked upon as rather a doubtful character . ’
136376	136379	136381	136382	the other	5966	‘ Doubtful ? ’
136384	136423	136381	136382	the other	5966	‘ I am glad to hear there ’s any doubt about it . I supposed that had been thoroughly settled , long ago . But will you let me speak a word or two with you in private ? ’
136488	136498	136499	136499	he	8786	‘ I ’ll not detain you any longer now , ’
136516	136540	136499	136499	he	8786	‘ You shall hear from me again . Not a word of this , you know , except to your master and mistress . ’
136541	136551	136553	136553	Kit	75	‘ Mother , sir , would be glad to know-- ’
136557	136563	136553	136553	Kit	75	‘ Glad to know what ? ’
136564	136578	136499	136499	he	8786	‘ Anything -- so that it was no harm -- about Miss Nell . ’
136579	136617	136499	136499	he	8786	‘ Would she ? Well then , you may tell her if she can keep a secret . But mind , not a word of this to anybody else . Do n’t forget that . Be particular . ’
136618	136626	136628	136628	Kit	75	‘ I ’ll take care , sir , ’
136630	136639	136628	136628	Kit	75	‘ Thankee , sir , and good morning . ’
136860	136863	136865	136865	Dick	77	‘ Hallo ! ’
136867	136872	136865	136865	Dick	77	‘ who is that ? ’
136873	136883	136885	136886	Mr Chuckster	139	‘ He called to see my Governor this morning , ’
136888	136900	136885	136886	Mr Chuckster	139	‘ beyond that , I do n’t know him from Adam . ’
136901	136909	136911	136911	Dick	77	‘ At least you know his name ? ’
136932	136935	136930	136930	he	139	‘ everlastingly blessed ’
136940	136949	136951	136952	Mr Chuckster	139	‘ All I know , my dear feller , ’
136961	137005	136951	136952	Mr Chuckster	139	‘ is , that he is the cause of my having stood here twenty minutes , for which I hate him with a mortal and undying hatred , and would pursue him to the confines of eternity if I could afford the time . ’
137057	137067	137069	137069	Kit	75	‘ He is a very nice gentleman , Sir , ’
137071	137081	137069	137069	Kit	75	‘ and that ’s all I know about him . ’
137390	137396	137398	137398	Richard	78	‘ It ’s hard work , ’
137400	137409	137398	137398	Richard	78	‘ What do you say to some beer ? ’
137428	137440	137442	137442	Dick	77	‘ We ’ll drink our friend what’s - his - name , ’
137451	137484	137485	137485	Kit	75	‘ --that was talking to you this morning , you know -- I know him -- a good fellow , but eccentric -- very -- here ’s what’s - his - name ! ’
137489	137496	137498	137498	Dick	77	‘ He lives in my house , ’
137500	137513	137498	137498	Dick	77	‘ at least in the house occupied by the firm in which I ’m
137542	137543	137544	137544	I	0	’ ‘
137555	137562	137549	137549	sir	5863	’ said Kit , moving away . ‘
137572	137577	137570	137570	Christopher	75	’ replied his patron , ‘
137584	137585	137581	137582	your mother	6139	’ ‘
137591	137592	137589	137589	sir	5863	’ ‘
137603	137608	137601	137601	Christopher	75	’ said Mr Swiveller . ‘
137660	137686	137654	137654	he	3198	’ Kit shook his head , and glancing slyly at his questioner , thanked him , and made off before he could say another word . ‘
137689	137695	137654	137654	he	3198	’ said Mr Swiveller pondering , ‘
137748	138352	137743	137743	Queer	3204	’ After pondering deeply and with a face of exceeding wisdom for some time , Mr Swiveller drank some more of the beer , and summoning a small boy who had been watching his proceedings , poured forth the few remaining drops as a libation on the gravel , and bade him carry the empty vessel to the bar with his compliments , and above all things to lead a sober and temperate life , and abstain from all intoxicating and exciting liquors . Having given him this piece of moral advice for his trouble ( which , as he wisely observed , was far better than half - pence ) the Perpetual Grand Master of the Glorious Apollos thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntered away : still pondering as he went . CHAPTER 39 All that day , though he waited for Mr Abel until evening , Kit kept clear of his mother ’s house , determined not to anticipate the pleasures of the morrow , but to let them come in their full rush of delight ; for to - morrow was the great and long looked - for epoch in his life -- to - morrow was the end of his first quarter -- the day of receiving , for the first time , one fourth part of his annual income of Six Pounds in one vast sum of Thirty Shillings -- to - morrow was to be a half - holiday devoted to a whirl of entertainments , and little Jacob was to know what oysters meant , and to see a play . All manner of incidents combined in favour of the occasion : not only had Mr and Mrs Garland forewarned him that they intended to make no deduction for his outfit from the great amount , but to pay it him unbroken in all its gigantic grandeur ; not only had the unknown gentleman increased the stock by the sum of five shillings , which was a perfect god - send and in itself a fortune ; not only had these things come to pass which nobody could have calculated upon , or in their wildest dreams have hoped ; but it was Barbara ’s quarter too -- Barbara ’s quarter , that very day -- and Barbara had a half - holiday as well as Kit , and Barbara ’s mother was going to make one of the party , and to take tea with Kit ’s mother , and cultivate her acquaintance . To be sure Kit looked out of his window very early that morning to see which way the clouds were flying , and to be sure Barbara would have been at hers too , if she had not sat up so late over - night , starching and ironing small pieces of muslin , and crimping them into frills , and sewing them on to other pieces to form magnificent wholes for next day ’s wear . But they were both up very early for all that , and had small appetites for breakfast and less for dinner , and were in a state of great excitement when Barbara ’s mother came in , with astonishing accounts of the fineness of the weather out of doors ( but with a very large umbrella notwithstanding , for people like Barbara ’s mother seldom make holiday without one ) , and when the bell rang for them to go up stairs and receive their quarter ’s money in gold and silver . Well , was n’t Mr Garland kind when he said ‘
138367	138377	138378	138378	Barbara	170	’ and was n’t Mrs Garland kind when she said ‘
138386	138392	138396	138396	Kit	75	’m much pleased with you ; ’
138449	138489	138447	138447	she	8839	‘ Here ’s blessing you , ma’am , as a good lady , and you , sir , as a good gentleman , and Barbara , my love to you , and here ’s towards you , Mr Christopher ; ’
138749	138757	138759	138759	Barbara	170	‘ And we are both widows too ! ’
138763	138774	138759	138759	Barbara	170	‘ We must have been made to know each other . ’
138775	138784	138786	138787	Mrs Nubbles	123	‘ I have n’t a doubt about it , ’
138789	138804	138786	138787	Mrs Nubbles	123	‘ And what a pity it is we did n’t know each other sooner . ’
138805	138818	138820	138820	Barbara	170	‘ But then , you know , it ’s such a pleasure , ’
138824	138850	138820	138820	Barbara	170	‘ to have it brought about by one ’s son and daughter , that it ’s fully made up for . Now , an’t it ? ’
139420	139427	139414	139414	Barbara	170	‘ Now do n’t , mother ! ’
139549	139551	139535	139535	Kit	75	‘ scrowdging ’
140022	140026	140020	140020	Kit	75	‘ an - kor ’
140127	140133	140135	140135	Kit	75	‘ As handsome as her ? ’
140137	140142	140135	140135	Kit	75	‘ Double as handsome . ’
140143	140148	140135	140135	Kit	75	‘ Oh Christopher ! I ’m
140158	140162	140150	140150	she	72	’ said Barbara . ‘
140165	140169	140170	140170	She	72	’ returned Kit . ‘
140210	140211	140198	140198	YOU	3274	’ ‘
140215	140222	140213	140213	Christopher	75	’ said Barbara , looking down . ‘
140229	140233	140223	140223	You	3274	’ said Kit , ‘
140240	140341	140342	140342	sir	5863	’ Poor Barbara ! What was all this though -- even all this -- to the extraordinary dissipation that ensued , when Kit , walking into an oyster - shop as bold as if he lived there , and not so much as looking at the counter or the man behind it , led his party into a box -- a private box , fitted up with red curtains , white table - cloth , and cruet - stand complete -- and ordered a fierce gentleman with whiskers , who acted as waiter and called him , him Christopher Nubbles , ‘
140344	140418	140342	140342	sir	5863	’ to bring three dozen of his largest - sized oysters , and to look sharp about it ! Yes , Kit told this gentleman to look sharp , and he not only said he would look sharp , but he actually did , and presently came running back with the newest loaves , and the freshest butter , and the largest oysters , ever seen . Then said Kit to this gentleman , ‘
140433	140444	140426	140427	the gentleman	518	‘ Sir , did you address that language to me ? ’
140448	140451	140426	140427	the gentleman	518	‘ Pot o ’
140460	141678	140458	140458	sir	5863	’ and went off and fetched it , and put it on the table in a small decanter - stand , like those which blind - men ’s dogs carry about the streets in their mouths , to catch the half - pence in ; and both Kit ’s mother and Barbara ’s mother declared as he turned away that he was one of the slimmest and gracefullest young men she had ever looked upon . Then they fell to work upon the supper in earnest ; and there was Barbara , that foolish Barbara , declaring that she could not eat more than two , and wanting more pressing than you would believe before she would eat four : though her mother and Kit ’s mother made up for it pretty well , and ate and laughed and enjoyed themselves so thoroughly that it did Kit good to see them , and made him laugh and eat likewise from strong sympathy . But the greatest miracle of the night was little Jacob , who ate oysters as if he had been born and bred to the business -- sprinkled the pepper and the vinegar with a discretion beyond his years -- and afterwards built a grotto on the table with the shells . There was the baby too , who had never closed an eye all night , but had sat as good as gold , trying to force a large orange into his mouth , and gazing intently at the lights in the chandelier -- there he was , sitting up in his mother ’s lap , staring at the gas without winking , and making indentations in his soft visage with an oyster - shell , to that degree that a heart of iron must have loved him ! In short , there never was a more successful supper ; and when Kit ordered in a glass of something hot to finish with , and proposed Mr and Mrs Garland before sending it round , there were not six happier people in all the world . But all happiness has an end -- hence the chief pleasure of its next beginning -- and as it was now growing late , they agreed it was time to turn their faces homewards . So , after going a little out of their way to see Barbara and Barbara ’s mother safe to a friend ’s house where they were to pass the night , Kit and his mother left them at the door , with an early appointment for returning to Finchley next morning , and a great many plans for next quarter ’s enjoyment . Then , Kit took little Jacob on his back , and giving his arm to his mother , and a kiss to the baby , they all trudged merrily home together . CHAPTER 40 Full of that vague kind of penitence which holidays awaken next morning , Kit turned out at sunrise , and , with his faith in last night ’s enjoyments a little shaken by cool daylight and the return to every - day duties and occupations , went to meet Barbara and her mother at the appointed place . And being careful not to awaken any of the little household , who were yet resting from their unusual fatigues , Kit left his money on the chimney - piece , with an inscription in chalk calling his mother ’s attention to the circumstance , and informing her that it came from her dutiful son ; and went his way , with a heart something heavier than his pockets , but free from any very great oppression notwithstanding . Oh these holidays ! why will they leave us some regret ? why can not we push them back , only a week or two in our memories , so as to put them at once at that convenient distance whence they may be regarded either with a calm indifference or a pleasant effort of recollection ! why will they hang about us , like the flavour of yesterday ’s wine , suggestive of headaches and lassitude , and those good intentions for the future , which , under the earth , form the everlasting pavement of a large estate , and , upon it , usually endure until dinner - time or thereabouts ! Who will wonder that Barbara had a headache , or that Barbara ’s mother was disposed to be cross , or that she slightly underrated Astley ’s , and thought the clown was older than they had taken him to be last night ? Kit was not surprised to hear her say so -- not he . He had already had a misgiving that the inconstant actors in that dazzling vision had been doing the same thing the night before last , and would do it again that night , and the next , and for weeks and months to come , though he would not be there . Such is the difference between yesterday and today . We are all going to the play , or coming home from it . However , the Sun himself is weak when he first rises , and gathers strength and courage as the day gets on . By degrees , they began to recall circumstances more and more pleasant in their nature , until , what between talking , walking , and laughing , they reached Finchley in such good heart , that Barbara ’s mother declared she never felt less tired or in better spirits . And so said Kit . Barbara had been silent all the way , but she said so too . Poor little Barbara ! She was very quiet . They were at home in such good time that Kit had rubbed down the pony and made him as spruce as a race - horse , before Mr Garland came down to breakfast ; which punctual and industrious conduct the old lady , and the old gentleman , and Mr Abel , highly extolled . At his usual hour ( or rather at his usual minute and second , for he was the soul of punctuality ) Mr Abel walked out , to be overtaken by the London coach , and Kit and the old gentleman went to work in the garden . This was not the least pleasant of Kit ’s employments . On a fine day they were quite a family party ; the old lady sitting hard by with her work - basket on a little table ; the old gentleman digging , or pruning , or clipping about with a large pair of shears , or helping Kit in some way or other with great assiduity ; and Whisker looking on from his paddock in placid contemplation of them all . To - day they were to trim the grape - vine , so Kit mounted half - way up a short ladder , and began to snip and hammer away , while the old gentleman , with a great interest in his proceedings , handed up the nails and shreds of cloth as he wanted them . The old lady and Whisker looked on as usual . ‘
141683	141688	141681	141681	Christopher	75	’ said Mr Garland , ‘
141700	141701	141691	141691	you	75	’ ‘
141709	141719	141707	141707	Sir	5863	’ returned Kit , looking down from the ladder . ‘
141733	141739	141730	141731	Mr Abel	138	’ said the old gentleman , ‘
141744	141745	141730	141731	Mr Abel	138	’ ‘
141760	141761	141758	141758	Sir	5863	’ ‘
141763	141769	141771	141773	the old gentlemen	3285	’m glad to hear it , ’
141778	141792	141771	141773	the old gentlemen	3285	‘ He is disposed to behave more handsomely still , though , Christopher . ’
141793	141814	141758	141758	Sir	5863	‘ Indeed , Sir ! It ’s very kind in him , but I do n’t want him to , I ’m
141817	141828	141829	141829	He	3280	’ said Kit , hammering stoutly at an obdurate nail . ‘
141834	141840	141771	141773	the old gentlemen	3285	’ pursued the old gentleman , ‘
141853	141865	141758	141758	Sir	5863	’re doing , or you will fall down and hurt yourself . ’
141866	141876	141878	141878	Kit	75	‘ To have me in his service , Sir ? ’
141898	141917	141758	141758	Sir	5863	‘ Why , Sir , I do n’t think he can be in earnest when he says that . ’
141918	141926	141928	141929	Mr Garland	138	‘ Oh ! But he is indeed , ’
141931	141940	141928	141929	Mr Garland	138	‘ And he has told Mr Abel so . ’
141941	141950	141952	141952	Kit	75	‘ I never heard of such a thing ! ’
141962	141972	141952	141952	Kit	75	‘ I wonder at him ; that I do . ’
141973	141979	141981	141982	Mr Garland	138	‘ You see , Christopher , ’
141984	142050	141981	141982	Mr Garland	138	‘ this is a point of much importance to you , and you should understand and consider it in that light . This gentleman is able to give you more money than I -- not , I hope , to carry through the various relations of master and servant , more kindness and confidence , but certainly , Christopher , to give you more money . ’
142051	142054	142056	142056	Kit	75	‘ Well , ’
142058	142063	142056	142056	Kit	75	‘ after that , Sir-- ’
142064	142069	142071	142072	Mr Garland	138	‘ Wait a moment , ’
142074	142137	142139	142141	the old gentleman	808	‘ That is not all . You were a very faithful servant to your old employers , as I understand , and should this gentleman recover them , as it is his purpose to attempt doing by every means in his power , I have no doubt that you , being in his service , would meet with your reward . Besides , ’
142146	142190	142139	142141	the old gentleman	808	‘ besides having the pleasure of being again brought into communication with those to whom you seem to be very strongly and disinterestedly attached . You must think of all this , Christopher , and not be rash or hasty in your choice . ’
142265	142285	142287	142287	Kit	75	‘ He has no right to think that I ’d be led away to go to him , sir , ’
142299	142304	142287	142287	Kit	75	‘ Does he think I ’m
142308	142309	142287	142287	Kit	75	’ ‘
142323	142329	142315	142315	Christopher	75	’ said Mr Garland gravely . ‘
142336	142340	142349	142349	he	518	’ retorted Kit ; ‘
142438	142448	142436	142436	ma’am	609	’ added Kit , turning suddenly to his mistress , ‘
142523	142532	142533	142533	she	72	’ added Kit , shaking his head sorrowfully , ‘
142560	142588	142594	142594	sir	5863	’ Here Kit drove a nail into the wall , very hard -- much harder than was necessary -- and having done so , faced about again . ‘
142596	142608	142594	142594	sir	5863	’ said Kit--‘Whisker , ma’am ( and he knows so well I ’m
142728	142804	142718	142718	he	138	’ There is no telling how long Kit might have stood upon the ladder , addressing his master and mistress by turns , and generally turning towards the wrong person , if Barbara had not at that moment come running up to say that a messenger from the office had brought a note , which , with an expression of some surprise at Kit ’s oratorical appearance , she put into her master ’s hand . ‘
142807	142816	142718	142718	he	138	’ said the old gentleman after reading it , ‘
142825	142884	142818	142819	the messenger	7793	’ Barbara tripping off to do as she was bid , he turned to Kit and said that they would not pursue the subject any further , and that Kit could not be more unwilling to part with them , than they would be to part with Kit ; a sentiment which the old lady very generously echoed . ‘
142892	142905	142890	142890	Christopher	75	’ added Mr Garland , glancing at the note in his hand , ‘
142962	142996	142957	142957	you	75	’ This salutation was addressed to Mr Chuckster , who , with his hat extremely on one side , and his hair a long way beyond it , came swaggering up the walk . ‘
143004	143009	142998	142998	I	0	’ returned that gentleman . ‘
143030	143031	143032	143032	You	0	’ ‘
143044	143049	143041	143041	I	0	’ observed Mr Garland . ‘
143061	143066	143050	143050	I	0	’ replied the clerk . ‘
143079	143087	143078	143078	you	5863	’re a judge of horse - flesh . ’
143276	143289	143291	143292	the man	325	‘ Mizzler , one of us two tells a lie , and I ’m
143294	143304	143305	143305	Mizzler	231	’ as incorrectly stated by the same authorities ; but ‘
143311	143511	143310	143310	I	0	’m to be found , and damme , sir , find me if you want me’--which , of course , entirely changed the aspect of this interesting question , and placed it in a very different light . He also acquainted them with the precise amount of the income guaranteed by the Duke of Thigsberry to Violetta Stetta of the Italian Opera , which it appeared was payable quarterly , and not half - yearly , as the public had been given to understand , and which was EXclusive , and not INclusive ( as had been monstrously stated , ) of jewellery , perfumery , hair - powder for five footmen , and two daily changes of kid - gloves for a page . Having entreated the old lady and gentleman to set their minds at rest on these absorbing points , for they might rely on his statement being the correct one , Mr Chuckster entertained them with theatrical chit - chat and the court circular ; and so wound up a brilliant and fascinating conversation which he had maintained alone , and without any assistance whatever , for upwards of three - quarters of an hour . ‘
143523	143533	143534	143534	I	0	’ said Mr Chuckster rising in a graceful manner , ‘
143535	143543	143534	143534	I	0	’m afraid I must cut my stick . ’
143786	143789	143791	143792	the gentleman	518	‘ Christopher , ’
143803	143814	143791	143792	the gentleman	518	‘ I have found your old master and young mistress . ’
143815	143825	143827	143827	Kit	75	‘ No , Sir ! Have you , though ? ’
143835	143856	143827	143827	Kit	75	‘ Where are they , Sir ? How are they , Sir ? Are they -- are they near here ? ’
143857	143864	143866	143867	the gentleman	518	‘ A long way from here , ’
143873	143896	143870	143870	his	518	‘ But I am going away to - night to bring them back , and I want you to go with me . ’
143897	143902	143904	143904	Kit	75	‘ Me , Sir ? ’
143912	143916	143918	143920	the strange gentleman	3360	‘ The place , ’
143928	143947	143918	143920	the strange gentleman	3360	‘ indicated by this man of the dogs , is -- how far from here -- sixty miles ? ’
143948	143954	143870	143870	his	518	‘ From sixty to seventy . ’
143955	144043	143918	143920	the strange gentleman	3360	‘ Humph ! If we travel post all night , we shall reach there in good time to - morrow morning . Now , the only question is , as they will not know me , and the child , God bless her , would think that any stranger pursuing them had a design upon her grandfather ’s liberty -- can I do better than take this lad , whom they both know and will readily remember , as an assurance to them of my friendly intentions ? ’
144044	144048	144050	144051	the Notary	1334	‘ Certainly not , ’
144053	144060	144050	144051	the Notary	1334	‘ Take Christopher by all means . ’
144061	144069	144071	144071	Kit	75	‘ I beg your pardon , Sir , ’
144084	144093	144071	144071	Kit	75	‘ but if that ’s the reason , I ’m
144184	144205	144212	144214	the impetuous gentleman	3366	’m afraid . I ’d give the world to go , but you had better not take me , Sir . ’
144206	144210	144212	144214	the impetuous gentleman	3366	‘ Another difficulty ! ’
144216	144259	144212	144214	the impetuous gentleman	3366	‘ Was ever man so beset as I ? Is there nobody else that knew them , nobody else in whom they had any confidence ? Solitary as their lives were , is there no one person who would serve my purpose ? ’
144260	144266	144268	144269	the Notary	1334	‘ IS there , Christopher ? ’
144271	144277	144268	144269	the Notary	1334	‘ Not one , Sir , ’
144288	144289	144291	144291	they	3369	’ ‘
144295	144301	144291	144291	they	3369	’ said the single gentleman . ‘
144344	144345	144336	144336	they	3369	’ ‘
144354	144365	144348	144349	the devil	1278	’ said the impatient gentleman , catching up his hat . ‘
144387	144975	144374	144375	that woman	3375	’ In a word , the single gentleman was bursting out of the office , bent upon laying violent hands on Kit ’s mother , forcing her into a post - chaise , and carrying her off , when this novel kind of abduction was with some difficulty prevented by the joint efforts of Mr Abel and the Notary , who restrained him by dint of their remonstrances , and persuaded him to sound Kit upon the probability of her being able and willing to undertake such a journey on so short a notice . This occasioned some doubts on the part of Kit , and some violent demonstrations on that of the single gentleman , and a great many soothing speeches on that of the Notary and Mr Abel . The upshot of the business was , that Kit , after weighing the matter in his mind and considering it carefully , promised , on behalf of his mother , that she should be ready within two hours from that time to undertake the expedition , and engaged to produce her in that place , in all respects equipped and prepared for the journey , before the specified period had expired . Having given this pledge , which was rather a bold one , and not particularly easy of redemption , Kit lost no time in sallying forth , and taking measures for its immediate fulfilment . CHAPTER 41 Kit made his way through the crowded streets , dividing the stream of people , dashing across the busy road - ways , diving into lanes and alleys , and stopping or turning aside for nothing , until he came in front of the Old Curiosity Shop , when he came to a stand ; partly from habit and partly from being out of breath . It was a gloomy autumn evening , and he thought the old place had never looked so dismal as in its dreary twilight . The windows broken , the rusty sashes rattling in their frames , the deserted house a dull barrier dividing the glaring lights and bustle of the street into two long lines , and standing in the midst , cold , dark , and empty -- presented a cheerless spectacle which mingled harshly with the bright prospects the boy had been building up for its late inmates , and came like a disappointment or misfortune . Kit would have had a good fire roaring up the empty chimneys , lights sparkling and shining through the windows , people moving briskly to and fro , voices in cheerful conversation , something in unison with the new hopes that were astir . He had not expected that the house would wear any different aspect -- had known indeed that it could not -- but coming upon it in the midst of eager thoughts and expectations , it checked the current in its flow , and darkened it with a mournful shadow . Kit , however , fortunately for himself , was not learned enough or contemplative enough to be troubled with presages of evil afar off , and , having no mental spectacles to assist his vision in this respect , saw nothing but the dull house , which jarred uncomfortably upon his previous thoughts . So , almost wishing that he had not passed it , though hardly knowing why , he hurried on again , making up by his increased speed for the few moments he had lost . ‘
144984	144998	144979	144979	she	3376	’ thought Kit , as he approached the poor dwelling of his mother , ‘
145059	145102	145103	145103	Me	0	’ said Kit checking himself , and knocking at the door . A second knock brought no reply from within the house ; but caused a woman over the way to look out and inquire who that was , awanting Mrs Nubbles . ‘
145105	145109	145110	145110	She	3376	’ said Kit . ‘
145145	145154	145156	145156	Kit	75	‘ Then pray tell me where it is , ’
145158	145182	145156	145156	Kit	75	‘ for I have come on a pressing matter , and must fetch her out , even if she was in the pulpit . ’
145634	145638	145671	145671	I	0	‘ And now I ’m
145641	145668	145671	145671	I	0	’ thought Kit , gliding into the nearest empty pew which was opposite his mother ’s , and on the other side of the little aisle , ‘
145728	146173	145723	145723	they	3402	’ But there was little encouragement to believe that either event would happen for a couple of hours to come . The preacher went on telling them what he meant to convince them of before he had done , and it was clear that if he only kept to one - half of his promises and forgot the other , he was good for that time at least . In his desperation and restlessness Kit cast his eyes about the chapel , and happening to let them fall upon a little seat in front of the clerk ’s desk , could scarcely believe them when they showed him -- Quilp ! He rubbed them twice or thrice , but still they insisted that Quilp was there , and there indeed he was , sitting with his hands upon his knees , and his hat between them on a little wooden bracket , with the accustomed grin on his dirty face , and his eyes fixed upon the ceiling . He certainly did not glance at Kit or at his mother , and appeared utterly unconscious of their presence ; still Kit could not help feeling , directly , that the attention of the sly little fiend was fastened upon them , and upon nothing else . But , astounded as he was by the apparition of the dwarf among the Little Bethelites , and not free from a misgiving that it was the forerunner of some trouble or annoyance , he was compelled to subdue his wonder and to take active measures for the withdrawal of his parent , as the evening was now creeping on , and the matter grew serious . Therefore , the next time little Jacob woke , Kit set himself to attract his wandering attention , and this not being a very difficult task ( one sneeze effected it ) , he signed to him to rouse his mother . Ill - luck would have it , however , that , just then , the preacher , in a forcible exposition of one head of his discourse , leaned over upon the pulpit - desk so that very little more of him than his legs remained inside ; and , while he made vehement gestures with his right hand , and held on with his left , stared , or seemed to stare , straight into little Jacob ’s eyes , threatening him by his strained look and attitude -- so it appeared to the child -- that if he so much as moved a muscle , he , the preacher , would be literally , and not figuratively , ‘
146177	146243	145723	145723	they	3402	’ that instant . In this fearful state of things , distracted by the sudden appearance of Kit , and fascinated by the eyes of the preacher , the miserable Jacob sat bolt upright , wholly incapable of motion , strongly disposed to cry but afraid to do so , and returning his pastor ’s gaze until his infant eyes seemed starting from their sockets . ‘
146254	146286	146251	146251	I	0	’ thought Kit . With that he walked softly out of his pew and into his mother ’s , and as Mr Swiveller would have observed if he had been present , ‘
146288	146296	145723	145723	they	3402	’ the baby without speaking a word . ‘
146301	146305	146299	146299	mother	6118	’ whispered Kit . ‘
146319	146320	146311	146311	I	0	’ ‘
146325	146330	146323	146323	I	0	’ said Mrs Nubbles . ‘
146337	146344	146323	146323	I	0	’ returned her son , peevishly . ‘
146348	146358	146323	146323	I	0	’ cried Mrs Nubbles , catching at the word . ‘
146371	146372	146361	146361	Christopher	75	’ ‘
146380	146385	146361	146361	Christopher	75	’ said Kit hastily ; ‘
146411	146412	146413	146413	Stay	236	’ ‘
146419	146430	146431	146432	This gentleman	447	’ cried the preacher , as Kit was moving off . ‘
146435	146441	146443	146444	his mother	479	’re to stay , Christopher , ’
146446	146453	146455	146456	the preacher	3398	‘ Stay , Satan , stay ! ’
146459	146490	146492	146493	the preacher	3398	‘ Tempt not the woman that doth incline her ear to thee , but harken to the voice of him that calleth . He hath a lamb from the fold ! ’
146506	146535	146496	146496	his	3398	‘ He beareth off a lamb , a precious lamb ! He goeth about , like a wolf in the night season , and inveigleth the tender lambs ! ’
146583	146595	146566	146566	he	75	‘ No , I do n’t . He ’s my brother . ’
146596	146602	146604	146605	the preacher	3398	‘ He ’s MY brother ! ’
146607	146612	146614	146614	Kit	75	‘ He is n’t , ’
146617	146649	146614	146614	Kit	75	‘ How can you say such a thing ? And do n’t call me names if you please ; what harm have I done ? I should n’t have come to take ‘
146708	146785	146804	146804	you	75	’ So saying , Kit marched out of the chapel , followed by his mother and little Jacob , and found himself in the open air , with an indistinct recollection of having seen the people wake up and look surprised , and of Quilp having remained , throughout the interruption , in his old attitude , without moving his eyes from the ceiling , or appearing to take the smallest notice of anything that passed . ‘
146789	146801	146804	146804	you	75	’ said his mother , with her handkerchief to her eyes , ‘
146816	146817	146818	146818	I	0	’ ‘
146819	146863	146818	146818	I	0	’m glad of it , mother . What was there in the little bit of pleasure you took last night that made it necessary for you to be low - spirited and sorrowful tonight ? That ’s the way you do . If you ’re
146882	146900	146818	146818	I	0	’re sorry for it . More shame for you , mother , I was going to say . ’
146901	146906	146908	146909	Mrs Nubbles	123	‘ Hush , dear ! ’
146911	146924	146908	146909	Mrs Nubbles	123	‘ you do n’t mean what you say I know , but you ’re
146928	146929	146908	146909	Mrs Nubbles	123	’ ‘
146941	146945	146936	146936	I	0	’ retorted Kit . ‘
147217	147424	147207	147207	you	75	’ Talking on in this way , half in jest and half in earnest , and cheering up his mother , the children , and himself , by the one simple process of determining to be in a good humour , Kit led them briskly forward ; and on the road home , he related what had passed at the Notary ’s house , and the purpose with which he had intruded on the solemnities of Little Bethel . His mother was not a little startled on learning what service was required of her , and presently fell into a confusion of ideas , of which the most prominent were that it was a great honour and dignity to ride in a post - chaise , and that it was a moral impossibility to leave the children behind . But this objection , and a great many others , founded on certain articles of dress being at the wash , and certain other articles having no existence in the wardrobe of Mrs Nubbles , were overcome by Kit , who opposed to each and every of them , the pleasure of recovering Nell , and the delight it would be to bring her back in triumph . ‘
147434	147442	147432	147432	mother	6118	’ said Kit when they reached home . ‘
147461	147626	147630	147630	I	0	’ To tell how Kit then hustled into the box all sorts of things which could , by no remote contingency , be wanted , and how he left out everything likely to be of the smallest use ; how a neighbour was persuaded to come and stop with the children , and how the children at first cried dismally , and then laughed heartily on being promised all kinds of impossible and unheard - of toys ; how Kit ’s mother would n’t leave off kissing them , and how Kit could n’t make up his mind to be vexed with her for doing it ; would take more time and room than you and I can spare . So , passing over all such matters , it is sufficient to say that within a few minutes after the two hours had expired , Kit and his mother arrived at the Notary ’s door , where a post - chaise was already waiting . ‘
147633	147643	147630	147630	I	0	’ said Kit , quite aghast at the preparations . ‘
147672	147673	147665	147665	She	6118	’ ‘
147678	147683	147665	147665	She	6118	’ returned the gentleman . ‘
147716	147717	147693	147693	ma’am	609	’ ‘
147722	147727	147732	147732	Christopher	75	’ said the Notary . ‘
147734	147735	147732	147732	Christopher	75	’ ‘
147741	147745	147739	147739	Sir	5863	’ replied Kit . ‘
147752	147753	147750	147750	sir	5863	’ ‘
147758	147887	147888	147888	They	3439	’ said the single gentleman . And thereupon he gave his arm to Kit ’s mother , handed her into the carriage as politely as you please , and took his seat beside her . Up went the steps , bang went the door , round whirled the wheels , and off they rattled , with Kit ’s mother hanging out at one window waving a damp pocket - handkerchief and screaming out a great many messages to little Jacob and the baby , of which nobody heard a word . Kit stood in the middle of the road , and looked after them with tears in his eyes -- not brought there by the departure he witnessed , but by the return to which he looked forward . ‘
147892	147896	147938	147938	She	3443	’ he thought , ‘
147947	149154	147942	147942	she	3443	’ Whatever Kit thought about after this , took some time to think of , for he stood gazing up the lines of shining lamps , long after the chaise had disappeared , and did not return into the house until the Notary and Mr Abel , who had themselves lingered outside till the sound of the wheels was no longer distinguishable , had several times wondered what could possibly detain him . CHAPTER 42 It behoves us to leave Kit for a while , thoughtful and expectant , and to follow the fortunes of little Nell ; resuming the thread of the narrative at the point where it was left , some chapters back . In one of those wanderings in the evening time , when , following the two sisters at a humble distance , she felt , in her sympathy with them and her recognition in their trials of something akin to her own loneliness of spirit , a comfort and consolation which made such moments a time of deep delight , though the softened pleasure they yielded was of that kind which lives and dies in tears -- in one of those wanderings at the quiet hour of twilight , when sky , and earth , and air , and rippling water , and sound of distant bells , claimed kindred with the emotions of the solitary child , and inspired her with soothing thoughts , but not of a child ’s world or its easy joys -- in one of those rambles which had now become her only pleasure or relief from care , light had faded into darkness and evening deepened into night , and still the young creature lingered in the gloom ; feeling a companionship in Nature so serene and still , when noise of tongues and glare of garish lights would have been solitude indeed . The sisters had gone home , and she was alone . She raised her eyes to the bright stars , looking down so mildly from the wide worlds of air , and , gazing on them , found new stars burst upon her view , and more beyond , and more beyond again , until the whole great expanse sparkled with shining spheres , rising higher and higher in immeasurable space , eternal in their numbers as in their changeless and incorruptible existence . She bent over the calm river , and saw them shining in the same majestic order as when the dove beheld them gleaming through the swollen waters , upon the mountain tops down far below , and dead mankind , a million fathoms deep . The child sat silently beneath a tree , hushed in her very breath by the stillness of the night , and all its attendant wonders . The time and place awoke reflection , and she thought with a quiet hope -- less hope , perhaps , than resignation -- on the past , and present , and what was yet before her . Between the old man and herself there had come a gradual separation , harder to bear than any former sorrow . Every evening , and often in the day - time too , he was absent , alone ; and although she well knew where he went , and why -- too well from the constant drain upon her scanty purse and from his haggard looks -- he evaded all inquiry , maintained a strict reserve , and even shunned her presence . She sat meditating sorrowfully upon this change , and mingling it , as it were , with everything about her , when the distant church - clock bell struck nine . Rising at the sound , she retraced her steps , and turned thoughtfully towards the town . She had gained a little wooden bridge , which , thrown across the stream , led into a meadow in her way , when she came suddenly upon a ruddy light , and looking forward more attentively , discerned that it proceeded from what appeared to be an encampment of gipsies , who had made a fire in one corner at no great distance from the path , and were sitting or lying round it . As she was too poor to have any fear of them , she did not alter her course ( which , indeed , she could not have done without going a long way round ) , but quickened her pace a little , and kept straight on . A movement of timid curiosity impelled her , when she approached the spot , to glance towards the fire . There was a form between it and her , the outline strongly developed against the light , which caused her to stop abruptly . Then , as if she had reasoned with herself and were assured that it could not be , or had satisfied herself that it was not that of the person she had supposed , she went on again . But at that instant the conversation , whatever it was , which had been carrying on near this fire was resumed , and the tones of the voice that spoke -- she could not distinguish words -- sounded as familiar to her as her own . She turned , and looked back . The person had been seated before , but was now in a standing posture , and leaning forward on a stick on which he rested both hands . The attitude was no less familiar to her than the tone of voice had been . It was her grandfather . Her first impulse was to call to him ; her next to wonder who his associates could be , and for what purpose they were together . Some vague apprehension succeeded , and , yielding to the strong inclination it awakened , she drew nearer to the place ; not advancing across the open field , however , but creeping towards it by the hedge . In this way she advanced within a few feet of the fire , and standing among a few young trees , could both see and hear , without much danger of being observed . There were no women or children , as she had seen in other gipsy camps they had passed in their wayfaring , and but one gipsy -- a tall athletic man , who stood with his arms folded , leaning against a tree at a little distance off , looking now at the fire , and now , under his black eyelashes , at three other men who were there , with a watchful but half - concealed interest in their conversation . Of these , her grandfather was one ; the others she recognised as the first card - players at the public - house on the eventful night of the storm -- the man whom they had called Isaac List , and his gruff companion . One of the low , arched gipsy - tents , common to that people , was pitched hard by , but it either was , or appeared to be , empty . ‘
149161	149186	149187	149187	You	3444	’ said the stout man , looking up from the ground where he was lying at his ease , into her grandfather ’s face . ‘
149204	149212	149203	149203	You	3444	’re your own master , I hope ? ’
149213	149219	149221	149222	Isaac List	196	‘ Do n’t vex him , ’
149253	149261	149245	149245	he	196	‘ he did n’t mean any offence . ’
149262	149282	149284	149286	the old man	384	‘ You keep me poor , and plunder me , and make a sport and jest of me besides , ’
149295	149303	149284	149286	the old man	384	‘ Ye’ll drive me mad among ye . ’
149358	149367	149369	149371	the stout man	8155	‘ Confound you , what do you mean ? ’
149383	149419	149369	149371	the stout man	8155	‘ Keep you poor ! You ’d keep us poor if you could , would n’t you ? That ’s the way with you whining , puny , pitiful players . When you lose , you ’re
149446	149468	149469	149470	The speaker	2458	’ cried the fellow , raising his voice--‘Damme , what do you mean by such ungentlemanly language as plunder , eh ? ’
149587	149615	149566	149568	The old man	384	‘ You yourself were speaking of plunder just now , you know . Do n’t be so violent with me . You were , were you not ? ’
149616	149632	149634	149650	the other , who seemed to have been very near giving an awkward termination to the sentence	3462	‘ Not of plundering among present company ! Honour among -- among gentlemen , Sir , ’
149652	149662	149664	149665	Isaac List	196	‘ Do n’t be hard upon him , Jowl , ’
149667	149689	149664	149665	Isaac List	196	‘ He ’s very sorry for giving offence . There -- go on with what you were saying -- go on . ’
149690	149692	149693	149699	a jolly old tender - hearted lamb	3463	‘ I ’m
149704	149709	149664	149665	Isaac List	196	’ cried Mr Jowl , ‘

149779	149784	149787	149787	he	3465	’ remonstrated Isaac List , ‘

149801	149806	149797	149797	he	3465	’ said the other . ‘
149809	149824	149797	149797	he	3465	’ groaned the old man sitting down , and rocking himself to and fro . ‘

149856	149860	149851	149851	I	0	’ said Jowl , ‘

Borrow it , I say , and , when you ’re

149966	149972	149851	149851	I	0	’ Isaac List struck in , ‘

150042	150072	150076	150076	Isaac	196	’ said his friend , growing more eager , and drawing himself closer to the old man , while he signed to the gipsy not to come between them ; ‘
150154	150155	150158	150158	you	3464	’ ‘
150160	150165	150158	150158	you	3464	’ urged Isaac List . ‘
150172	150173	150158	150158	you	3464	’ ‘
150177	150186	150158	150158	you	3464	’ answered the other , with assumed disdain . ‘
150201	150248	150190	150190	Sir	5863	’ This was addressed to the gipsy , who crawled into the low tent on all fours , and after some rummaging and rustling returned with a cash - box , which the man who had spoken opened with a key he wore about his person . ‘
150254	150281	150250	150250	you	3464	’ he said , gathering up the money in his hand and letting it drop back into the box , between his fingers , like water . ‘
150320	150504	150505	150505	My	0	’ Isaac List , with great apparent humility , protested that he had never doubted the credit of a gentleman so notorious for his honourable dealing as Mr Jowl , and that he had hinted at the production of the box , not for the satisfaction of his doubts , for he could have none , but with a view to being regaled with a sight of so much wealth , which , though it might be deemed by some but an unsubstantial and visionary pleasure , was to one in his circumstances a source of extreme delight , only to be surpassed by its safe depository in his own personal pockets . Although Mr List and Mr Jowl addressed themselves to each other , it was remarkable that they both looked narrowly at the old man , who , with his eyes fixed upon the fire , sat brooding over it , yet listening eagerly -- as it seemed from a certain involuntary motion of the head , or twitching of the face from time to time -- to all they said . ‘
150508	150520	150505	150505	My	0	’ said Jowl , lying down again with a careless air , ‘

150608	150614	150620	150621	Mr Jowl	238	’ returned the person addressed ; ‘

150657	150667	150669	150669	Jowl	238	’re not to take that into consideration at all , ’
150671	150710	150669	150669	Jowl	238	‘ But suppose he did ( and nothing ’s less likely , from all I know of chances ) , why , it ’s better to lose other people ’s money than one ’s own , I hope ? ’
150711	150714	150716	150717	Isaac List	196	‘ Ah ! ’
150720	150744	150716	150717	Isaac List	196	‘ the pleasures of winning ! The delight of picking up the money -- the bright , shining yellow - boys -- and sweeping ‘
150785	150792	150669	150669	Jowl	238	’re not going , old gentleman ? ’
150793	150799	150801	150814	the old man , who had risen and taken two or three hurried steps	3479	‘ I ’ll do it , ’
150823	150832	150801	150814	the old man , who had risen and taken two or three hurried steps	3479	‘ I ’ll have it , every penny . ’
150833	150840	150842	150842	Isaac	196	‘ Why , that ’s brave , ’
150853	150896	150842	150842	Isaac	196	‘ and I respect you for having so much young blood left . Ha , ha , ha ! Joe Jowl ’s half sorry he advised you now . We ’ve got the laugh against him . Ha , ha , ha ! ’
150897	150906	150908	150910	the old man	384	‘ He gives me my revenge , mind , ’
150921	150948	150908	150910	the old man	384	‘ mind -- he stakes coin against coin , down to the last one in the box , be there many or few . Remember that ! ’
150949	150951	150908	150910	the old man	384	‘ I ’m
150954	150958	150908	150910	the old man	384	’ returned Isaac . ‘
150966	150967	150959	150959	I	0	’ ‘
150974	150981	150968	150968	I	0	’ said Jowl with feigned reluctance , ‘
151003	151004	150995	150995	I	0	’ ‘
151012	151018	151005	151005	I	0	’ said the old man ; ‘

151035	151039	151021	151021	I	0	’ urged Jowl . ‘
151053	151059	151046	151046	I	0	’ said the old man . ‘
151073	151074	150995	150995	I	0	’ ‘
151082	151086	150995	150995	I	0	’ said Jowl . ‘
151101	151160	151161	151161	God	71	’ The gipsy produced three tin cups , and filled them to the brim with brandy . The old man turned aside and muttered to himself before he drank . Her own name struck upon the listener ’s ear , coupled with some wish so fervent , that he seemed to breathe it in an agony of supplication . ‘
151167	151174	151161	151161	God	71	’ cried the child within herself , ‘
151191	151311	151185	151185	I	0	’ The remainder of their conversation was carried on in a lower tone of voice , and was sufficiently concise ; relating merely to the execution of the project , and the best precautions for diverting suspicion . The old man then shook hands with his tempters , and withdrew . They watched his bowed and stooping figure as it retreated slowly , and when he turned his head to look back , which he often did , waved their hands , or shouted some brief encouragement . It was not until they had seen him gradually diminish into a mere speck upon the distant road , that they turned to each other , and ventured to laugh aloud . ‘
151314	151325	151332	151332	He	3481	’ said Jowl , warming his hands at the fire , ‘
151364	151365	151357	151357	he	3481	’ ‘
151376	151386	151367	151367	he	3481	’ returned Isaac List . The other man nodded . ‘
151395	151399	151387	151387	We	3483	’ he said , ‘
151417	151826	151412	151412	Sharp	241	’ List and the gipsy acquiesced . When they had all three amused themselves a little with their victim ’s infatuation , they dismissed the subject as one which had been sufficiently discussed , and began to talk in a jargon which the child did not understand . As their discourse appeared to relate to matters in which they were warmly interested , however , she deemed it the best time for escaping unobserved ; and crept away with slow and cautious steps , keeping in the shadow of the hedges , or forcing a path through them or the dry ditches , until she could emerge upon the road at a point beyond their range of vision . Then she fled homeward as quickly as she could , torn and bleeding from the wounds of thorns and briars , but more lacerated in mind , and threw herself upon her bed , distracted . The first idea that flashed upon her mind was flight , instant flight ; dragging him from that place , and rather dying of want upon the roadside , than ever exposing him again to such terrible temptations . Then , she remembered that the crime was not to be committed until next night , and there was the intermediate time for thinking , and resolving what to do . Then , she was distracted with a horrible fear that he might be committing it at that moment ; with a dread of hearing shrieks and cries piercing the silence of the night ; with fearful thoughts of what he might be tempted and led on to do , if he were detected in the act , and had but a woman to struggle with . It was impossible to bear such torture . She stole to the room where the money was , opened the door , and looked in . God be praised ! He was not there , and she was sleeping soundly . She went back to her own room , and tried to prepare herself for bed . But who could sleep -- sleep ! who could lie passively down , distracted by such terrors ? They came upon her more and more strongly yet . Half undressed , and with her hair in wild disorder , she flew to the old man ’s bedside , clasped him by the wrist , and roused him from his sleep . ‘
151831	151849	151850	151850	I	0	’ he cried , starting up in bed , and fixing his eyes upon her spectral face . ‘
151857	151874	151850	151850	I	0	’ said the child , with an energy that nothing but such terrors could have inspired . ‘
151916	151934	151893	151898	grey - haired men like you	3484	’ The old man shook in every joint , and folded his hands like one who prays . ‘
151939	151944	151893	151898	grey - haired men like you	3484	’ said the child , ‘
151996	152027	151992	151992	We	3487	’ He looked at her as if she were a spirit -- she might have been for all the look of earth she had -- and trembled more and more . ‘
152042	152047	152035	152035	I	0	’ said the child . ‘
152055	152056	152035	152035	I	0	’ ‘
152061	152067	152035	152035	I	0	’ murmured the old man . ‘
152074	152079	152035	152035	I	0	’ replied the child . ‘
152105	152584	152585	152585	I	0	’ The old man rose from his bed : his forehead bedewed with the cold sweat of fear : and , bending before the child as if she had been an angel messenger sent to lead him where she would , made ready to follow her . She took him by the hand and led him on . As they passed the door of the room he had proposed to rob , she shuddered and looked up into his face . What a white face was that , and with what a look did he meet hers ! She took him to her own chamber , and , still holding him by the hand as if she feared to lose him for an instant , gathered together the little stock she had , and hung her basket on her arm . The old man took his wallet from her hands and strapped it on his shoulders -- his staff , too , she had brought away -- and then she led him forth . Through the strait streets , and narrow crooked outskirts , their trembling feet passed quickly . Up the steep hill too , crowned by the old grey castle , they toiled with rapid steps , and had not once looked behind . But as they drew nearer the ruined walls , the moon rose in all her gentle glory , and , from their venerable age , garlanded with ivy , moss , and waving grass , the child looked back upon the sleeping town , deep in the valley ’s shade : and on the far - off river with its winding track of light : and on the distant hills ; and as she did so , she clasped the hand she held , less firmly , and bursting into tears , fell upon the old man ’s neck . CHAPTER 43 Her momentary weakness past , the child again summoned the resolution which had until now sustained her , and , endeavouring to keep steadily in her view the one idea that they were flying from disgrace and crime , and that her grandfather ’s preservation must depend solely on her firmness , unaided by one word of advice or any helping hand , urged him onward and looked back no more . While he , subdued and abashed , seemed to crouch before her , and to shrink and cower down , as if in the presence of some superior creature , the child herself was sensible of a new feeling within her , which elevated her nature , and inspired her with an energy and confidence she had never known . There was no divided responsibility now ; the whole burden of their two lives had fallen upon her , and henceforth she must think and act for both . ‘
152590	152594	152585	152585	I	0	’ she thought . ‘
152606	153059	152601	152601	I	0	’ At any other time , the recollection of having deserted the friend who had shown them so much homely kindness , without a word of justification -- the thought that they were guilty , in appearance , of treachery and ingratitude -- even the having parted from the two sisters -- would have filled her with sorrow and regret . But now , all other considerations were lost in the new uncertainties and anxieties of their wild and wandering life ; and the very desperation of their condition roused and stimulated her . In the pale moonlight , which lent a wanness of its own to the delicate face where thoughtful care already mingled with the winning grace and loveliness of youth , the too bright eye , the spiritual head , the lips that pressed each other with such high resolve and courage of the heart , the slight figure firm in its bearing and yet so very weak , told their silent tale ; but told it only to the wind that rustled by , which , taking up its burden , carried , perhaps to some mother ’s pillow , faint dreams of childhood fading in its bloom , and resting in the sleep that knows no waking . The night crept on apace , the moon went down , the stars grew pale and dim , and morning , cold as they , slowly approached . Then , from behind a distant hill , the noble sun rose up , driving the mists in phantom shapes before it , and clearing the earth of their ghostly forms till darkness came again . When it had climbed higher into the sky , and there was warmth in its cheerful beams , they laid them down to sleep , upon a bank , hard by some water . But Nell retained her grasp upon the old man ’s arm , and long after he was slumbering soundly , watched him with untiring eyes . Fatigue stole over her at last ; her grasp relaxed , tightened , relaxed again , and they slept side by side . A confused sound of voices , mingling with her dreams , awoke her . A man of very uncouth and rough appearance was standing over them , and two of his companions were looking on , from a long heavy boat which had come close to the bank while they were sleeping . The boat had neither oar nor sail , but was towed by a couple of horses , who , with the rope to which they were harnessed slack and dripping in the water , were resting on the path . ‘
153062	153068	152601	152601	I	0	’ said the man roughly . ‘
153075	153076	152601	152601	I	0	’ ‘
153084	153088	153082	153082	Sir	5863	’ said Nell . ‘
153096	153097	153089	153089	We	3490	’ ‘
153109	153119	153089	153089	We	3490	’ observed the man who had first accosted them . ‘
153147	153182	153144	153144	you	3490	’ Nell faltered , and pointed at hazard towards the West , upon which the man inquired if she meant a certain town which he named . Nell , to avoid more questioning , said ‘
153190	153191	153144	153144	you	3490	’ ‘
153198	153244	153194	153194	you	3490	’ was the next question ; and this being an easier one to answer , Nell mentioned the name of the village in which their friend the schoolmaster dwelt , as being less likely to be known to the men or to provoke further inquiry . ‘
153260	153265	153247	153247	somebody	6663	’ said the man . ‘
153273	153324	153326	153326	you	0	’ Returning his salute and feeling greatly relieved by his departure , Nell looked after him as he mounted one of the horses , and the boat went on . It had not gone very far , when it stopped again , and she saw the men beckoning to her . ‘
153331	153340	153326	153326	you	0	’ said Nell , running up to them . ‘
153350	153359	153360	153360	We	3497	’ replied one of those in the boat . ‘
153361	153368	153369	153370	The child	324	’re going to the same place . ’
154478	154498	154500	154501	this gentleman	447	‘ You ’ve got a very pretty voice , a very soft eye , and a very strong memory , ’
154503	154526	154500	154501	this gentleman	447	‘ the voice and eye I ’ve got evidence for , and the memory ’s an opinion of my own . And I ’m
154538	154539	154540	154540	I	0	’ ‘
154550	154554	154548	154548	sir	5863	’ returned Nell . ‘
154562	154579	154555	154555	You	0	’ said the man , with a gravity which admitted of no altercation on the subject . ‘
154592	154605	154588	154588	me	0	‘ em -- the best . Give me a song this minute . ’
155307	156048	156049	156049	We	3589	’ feet upon the wet and greasy pavement , the rattling of the rain on windows and umbrella - tops , the jostling of the more impatient passengers , and all the noise and tumult of a crowded street in the high tide of its occupation : while the two poor strangers , stunned and bewildered by the hurry they beheld but had no part in , looked mournfully on ; feeling , amidst the crowd , a solitude which has no parallel but in the thirst of the shipwrecked mariner , who , tost to and fro upon the billows of a mighty ocean , his red eyes blinded by looking on the water which hems him in on every side , has not one drop to cool his burning tongue . They withdrew into a low archway for shelter from the rain , and watched the faces of those who passed , to find in one among them a ray of encouragement or hope . Some frowned , some smiled , some muttered to themselves , some made slight gestures , as if anticipating the conversation in which they would shortly be engaged , some wore the cunning look of bargaining and plotting , some were anxious and eager , some slow and dull ; in some countenances , were written gain ; in others , loss . It was like being in the confidence of all these people to stand quietly there , looking into their faces as they flitted past . In busy places , where each man has an object of his own , and feels assured that every other man has his , his character and purpose are written broadly in his face . In the public walks and lounges of a town , people go to see and to be seen , and there the same expression , with little variety , is repeated a hundred times . The working - day faces come nearer to the truth , and let it out more plainly . Falling into that kind of abstraction which such a solitude awakens , the child continued to gaze upon the passing crowd with a wondering interest , amounting almost to a temporary forgetfulness of her own condition . But cold , wet , hunger , want of rest , and lack of any place in which to lay her aching head , soon brought her thoughts back to the point whence they had strayed . No one passed who seemed to notice them , or to whom she durst appeal . After some time , they left their place of refuge from the weather , and mingled with the concourse . Evening came on . They were still wandering up and down , with fewer people about them , but with the same sense of solitude in their own breasts , and the same indifference from all around . The lights in the streets and shops made them feel yet more desolate , for with their help , night and darkness seemed to come on faster . Shivering with the cold and damp , ill in body , and sick to death at heart , the child needed her utmost firmness and resolution even to creep along . Why had they ever come to this noisy town , when there were peaceful country places , in which , at least , they might have hungered and thirsted , with less suffering than in its squalid strife ! They were but an atom , here , in a mountain heap of misery , the very sight of which increased their hopelessness and suffering . The child had not only to endure the accumulated hardships of their destitute condition , but to bear the reproaches of her grandfather , who began to murmur at having been led away from their late abode , and demand that they should return to it . Being now penniless , and no relief or prospect of relief appearing , they retraced their steps through the deserted streets , and went back to the wharf , hoping to find the boat in which they had come , and to be allowed to sleep on board that night . But here again they were disappointed , for the gate was closed , and some fierce dogs , barking at their approach , obliged them to retreat . ‘
156062	156080	156060	156060	dear	6657	’ said the child in a weak voice , as they turned away from this last repulse ; ‘
156109	156110	156113	156113	you	3593	’ ‘
156118	156125	156113	156113	you	3593	’ returned the old man fiercely . ‘
156151	156152	156144	156144	you	3593	’ ‘
156167	156182	156159	156159	I	0	’ said the child , with a momentary firmness that lost itself in tears ; ‘

156243	156277	156280	156280	my	0	’ cried the old man , clasping his hands and gazing as if for the first time upon her anxious face , her travel - stained dress , and bruised and swollen feet ; ‘
156311	156312	156300	156300	I	0	’ ‘
156321	156487	156493	156493	she	3600	’ said the child , with assumed cheerfulness , as they walked on looking about them for a shelter , we should find some good old tree , stretching out his green arms as if he loved us , and nodding and rustling as if he would have us fall asleep , thinking of him while he watched . Please God , we shall be there soon -- to - morrow or next day at the farthest -- and in the meantime let us think , dear , that it was a good thing we came here ; for we are lost in the crowd and hurry of this place , and if any cruel people should pursue us , they could surely never trace us further . There ’s comfort in that . And here ’s a deep old doorway -- very dark , but quite dry , and warm too , for the wind do n’t blow in here -- What ’s that ! ’
156524	156528	156493	156493	she	3600	‘ Speak again , ’
156532	156539	156493	156493	she	3600	‘ do I know the voice ? ’
156540	156543	156545	156546	the child	324	‘ No , ’
156549	156570	156545	156546	the child	324	‘ we are strangers , and having no money for a night ’s lodging , were going to rest here . ’
156760	156770	156771	156771	he	3605	‘ How came you to think of resting there ? ’
156774	156778	156779	156779	he	3605	‘ Or how , ’
156789	156805	156779	156779	he	3605	‘ do you come to want a place of rest at this time of night ? ’
156806	156810	156811	156812	the grandfather	436	‘ Our misfortunes , ’
156815	156820	156811	156812	the grandfather	436	‘ are the cause . ’
156821	156826	156828	156829	the man	325	‘ Do you know , ’
156838	156856	156828	156829	the man	325	‘ how wet she is , and that the damp streets are not a place for her ? ’
156857	156867	156868	156868	he	325	‘ I know it well , God help me , ’
156871	156877	156878	156879	The man	325	‘ What can I do ! ’
156902	156909	156910	156910	he	325	‘ I can give you warmth , ’
156917	156932	156910	156910	he	325	‘ nothing else . Such lodging as I have , is in that house , ’
156943	156987	156910	156910	he	325	‘ but she is safer and better there than here . The fire is in a rough place , but you can pass the night beside it safely , if you ’ll trust yourselves to me . You see that red light yonder ? ’
157012	157018	157020	157021	the man	325	‘ It ’s not far , ’
157023	157052	157020	157021	the man	325	‘ Shall I take you there ? You were going to sleep upon cold bricks ; I can give you a bed of warm ashes -- nothing better . ’
157218	157224	157225	157225	he	325	‘ This is the place , ’
157241	157255	157225	157225	he	325	‘ Do n’t be afraid . There ’s nobody here will harm you . ’
157937	157944	157945	157945	she	72	‘ I feared you were ill , ’
157948	157964	157945	157945	she	72	‘ The other men are all in motion , and you are so very quiet . ’
157965	157972	157973	157973	he	384	‘ They leave me to myself , ’
157976	158004	157973	157973	he	384	‘ They know my humour . They laugh at me , but do n’t harm me in it . See yonder there -- that ’s my friend . ’

158363	158368	158357	158357	You	325	’ said the child . ‘
158408	158409	158398	158398	I	0	’ ‘
158417	158422	158411	158411	you	325	’ asked the child . ‘
158572	158817	158818	158818	I	0	’ With that , he led her to her rude couch , and covering her with the clothes with which she had found herself enveloped when she woke , returned to his seat , whence he moved no more unless to feed the furnace , but remained motionless as a statue . The child continued to watch him for a little time , but soon yielded to the drowsiness that came upon her , and , in the dark strange place and on the heap of ashes , slept as peacefully as if the room had been a palace chamber , and the bed , a bed of down . When she awoke again , broad day was shining through the lofty openings in the walls , and , stealing in slanting rays but midway down , seemed to make the building darker than it had been at night . The clang and tumult were still going on , and the remorseless fires were burning fiercely as before ; for few changes of night and day brought rest or quiet there . Her friend parted his breakfast -- a scanty mess of coffee and some coarse bread -- with the child and her grandfather , and inquired whither they were going . She told him that they sought some distant country place remote from towns or even other villages , and with a faltering tongue inquired what road they would do best to take . ‘
158825	158833	158818	158818	I	0	’ he said , shaking his head , ‘
158862	158863	158879	158879	they	3662	’ ‘
158869	158873	158879	158879	they	3662	’ said Nell . ‘
158923	158924	158925	158925	We	3661	’ ‘
158933	158954	158955	158956	Rough people	3666	’ said the child boldly ; for she saw that the old man listened with anxious ears to this account . ‘
158981	158982	158978	158979	my child	5862	’ ‘
158987	158994	158978	158979	my child	5862	’ cried Nell , pressing forward . ‘
159056	159057	159052	159052	you	3665	’ ‘
159066	159093	159094	159094	I	0	’ said their uncouth protector , glancing from the eager child to her grandfather , who hung his head and bent his eyes upon the ground . ‘
159114	159418	159430	159430	He	3668	’ He showed them , then , by which road they must leave the town , and what course they should hold when they had gained it . He lingered so long on these instructions , that the child , with a fervent blessing , tore herself away , and stayed to hear no more . But , before they had reached the corner of the lane , the man came running after them , and , pressing her hand , left something in it -- two old , battered , smoke - encrusted penny pieces . Who knows but they shone as brightly in the eyes of angels , as golden gifts that have been chronicled on tombs ? And thus they separated ; the child to lead her sacred charge farther from guilt and shame ; the labourer to attach a fresh interest to the spot where his guests had slept , and read new histories in his furnace fire . CHAPTER 45 In all their journeying , they had never longed so ardently , they had never so pined and wearied , for the freedom of pure air and open country , as now . No , not even on that memorable morning , when , deserting their old home , they abandoned themselves to the mercies of a strange world , and left all the dumb and senseless things they had known and loved , behind -- not even then , had they so yearned for the fresh solitudes of wood , hillside , and field , as now , when the noise and dirt and vapour , of the great manufacturing town reeking with lean misery and hungry wretchedness , hemmed them in on every side , and seemed to shut out hope , and render escape impossible . ‘
159424	159429	159430	159430	He	3668	’ thought the child . ‘
159492	159598	159599	159599	We	3669	’ With thoughts like this , and with some vague design of travelling to a great distance among streams and mountains , where only very poor and simple people lived , and where they might maintain themselves by very humble helping work in farms , free from such terrors as that from which they fled -- the child , with no resource but the poor man ’s gift , and no encouragement but that which flowed from her own heart , and its sense of the truth and right of what she did , nerved herself to this last journey and boldly pursued her task . ‘
159610	159622	159608	159608	dear	6657	’ she said , as they toiled painfully through the streets ; ‘
159666	159667	159655	159655	he	6657	’ ‘
159678	159685	159673	159673	he	6657	’ returned her grandfather , piteously . ‘
159704	159705	159693	159693	you	0	’ ‘
159711	159718	159673	159673	he	6657	’ said the child , firmly , ‘
159779	159780	159777	159777	we	3669	’ ‘
159783	159801	159777	159777	we	3669	’ replied the old man , wavering in his voice , no less than in his manner . ‘
159820	161122	159818	159818	Nell	72	’ The child walked with more difficulty than she had led her companion to expect , for the pains that racked her joints were of no common severity , and every exertion increased them . But they wrung from her no complaint , or look of suffering ; and , though the two travellers proceeded very slowly , they did proceed . Clearing the town in course of time , they began to feel that they were fairly on their way . A long suburb of red brick houses -- some with patches of garden - ground , where coal - dust and factory smoke darkened the shrinking leaves , and coarse rank flowers , and where the struggling vegetation sickened and sank under the hot breath of kiln and furnace , making them by its presence seem yet more blighting and unwholesome than in the town itself -- a long , flat , straggling suburb passed , they came , by slow degrees , upon a cheerless region , where not a blade of grass was seen to grow , where not a bud put forth its promise in the spring , where nothing green could live but on the surface of the stagnant pools , which here and there lay idly sweltering by the black road - side . Advancing more and more into the shadow of this mournful place , its dark depressing influence stole upon their spirits , and filled them with a dismal gloom . On every side , and far as the eye could see into the heavy distance , tall chimneys , crowding on each other , and presenting that endless repetition of the same dull , ugly form , which is the horror of oppressive dreams , poured out their plague of smoke , obscured the light , and made foul the melancholy air . On mounds of ashes by the wayside , sheltered only by a few rough boards , or rotten pent - house roofs , strange engines spun and writhed like tortured creatures ; clanking their iron chains , shrieking in their rapid whirl from time to time as though in torment unendurable , and making the ground tremble with their agonies . Dismantled houses here and there appeared , tottering to the earth , propped up by fragments of others that had fallen down , unroofed , windowless , blackened , desolate , but yet inhabited . Men , women , children , wan in their looks and ragged in attire , tended the engines , fed their tributary fire , begged upon the road , or scowled half - naked from the doorless houses . Then came more of the wrathful monsters , whose like they almost seemed to be in their wildness and their untamed air , screeching and turning round and round again ; and still , before , behind , and to the right and left , was the same interminable perspective of brick towers , never ceasing in their black vomit , blasting all things living or inanimate , shutting out the face of day , and closing in on all these horrors with a dense dark cloud . But night - time in this dreadful spot!--night , when the smoke was changed to fire ; when every chimney spirited up its flame ; and places , that had been dark vaults all day , now shone red - hot , with figures moving to and fro within their blazing jaws , and calling to one another with hoarse cries -- night , when the noise of every strange machine was aggravated by the darkness ; when the people near them looked wilder and more savage ; when bands of unemployed labourers paraded the roads , or clustered by torch - light round their leaders , who told them , in stern language , of their wrongs , and urged them on to frightful cries and threats ; when maddened men , armed with sword and firebrand , spurning the tears and prayers of women who would restrain them , rushed forth on errands of terror and destruction , to work no ruin half so surely as their own -- night , when carts came rumbling by , filled with rude coffins ( for contagious disease and death had been busy with the living crops ) ; when orphans cried , and distracted women shrieked and followed in their wake -- night , when some called for bread , and some for drink to drown their cares , and some with tears , and some with staggering feet , and some with bloodshot eyes , went brooding home -- night , which , unlike the night that Heaven sends on earth , brought with it no peace , nor quiet , nor signs of blessed sleep -- who shall tell the terrors of the night to the young wandering child ! And yet she lay down , with nothing between her and the sky ; and , with no fear for herself , for she was past it now , put up a prayer for the poor old man . So very weak and spent , she felt , so very calm and unresisting , that she had no thought of any wants of her own , but prayed that God would raise up some friend for him . She tried to recall the way they had come , and to look in the direction where the fire by which they had slept last night was burning . She had forgotten to ask the name of the poor man , their friend , and when she had remembered him in her prayers , it seemed ungrateful not to turn one look towards the spot where he was watching . A penny loaf was all they had had that day . It was very little , but even hunger was forgotten in the strange tranquillity that crept over her senses . She lay down , very gently , and , with a quiet smile upon her face , fell into a slumber . It was not like sleep -- and yet it must have been , or why those pleasant dreams of the little scholar all night long ! Morning came . Much weaker , diminished powers even of sight and hearing , and yet the child made no complaint -- perhaps would have made none , even if she had not had that inducement to be silent , travelling by her side . She felt a hopelessness of their ever being extricated together from that forlorn place ; a dull conviction that she was very ill , perhaps dying ; but no fear or anxiety . A loathing of food that she was not conscious of until they expended their last penny in the purchase of another loaf , prevented her partaking even of this poor repast . Her grandfather ate greedily , which she was glad to see . Their way lay through the same scenes as yesterday , with no variety or improvement . There was the same thick air , difficult to breathe ; the same blighted ground , the same hopeless prospect , the same misery and distress . Objects appeared more dim , the noise less , the path more rugged and uneven , for sometimes she stumbled , and became roused , as it were , in the effort to prevent herself from falling . Poor child ! the cause was in her tottering feet . Towards the afternoon , her grandfather complained bitterly of hunger . She approached one of the wretched hovels by the way - side , and knocked with her hand upon the door . ‘
161129	161138	161125	161125	you	3677	’ said a gaunt man , opening it . ‘
161146	161147	161125	161125	you	3677	’ ‘
161153	161169	161149	161149	you	3677	’ returned the man hoarsely , pointing to a kind of bundle on the ground . ‘
161219	161318	161203	161203	you	3677	’ The child recoiled from the door , and it closed upon her . Impelled by strong necessity , she knocked at another : a neighbouring one , which , yielding to the slight pressure of her hand , flew open . It seemed that a couple of poor families lived in this hovel , for two women , each among children of her own , occupied different portions of the room . In the centre , stood a grave gentleman in black who appeared to have just entered , and who held by the arm a boy . ‘
161323	161327	161203	161203	you	3677	’ he said , ‘
161412	161413	161393	161393	I	0	’ ‘
161424	161436	161417	161417	you	0	’ said the other woman , hastily rising and confronting him . ‘
161456	161457	161443	161444	MY son	7447	’ ‘
161466	161472	161459	161459	he	3682	’ asked the gentleman sternly . ‘
161479	161480	161474	161474	he	3682	’ ‘
161487	161488	161489	161489	He	3682	’ ‘
161492	161497	161489	161489	He	3682	’ cried the woman . ‘
161553	161554	161557	161557	woman	6824	’ ‘
161559	161564	161557	161557	woman	6824	’ said the gentleman , ‘
161575	161576	161577	161577	He	3682	’ ‘
161580	161585	161577	161577	He	3682	’ cried the mother ; ‘
161745	161746	161747	161747	You	6824	’ ‘
161751	161763	161747	161747	You	6824	’ said the gentleman , taking out his snuff - box , ‘
161771	161772	161765	161765	I	0	’ ‘
161777	161782	161784	161784	you	5863	’ returned the woman , ‘
161827	162372	162373	162373	She	3711	’ The child had seen and heard enough to know that this was not a place at which to ask for alms . She led the old man softly from the door , and they pursued their journey . With less and less of hope or strength , as they went on , but with an undiminished resolution not to betray by any word or sigh her sinking state , so long as she had energy to move , the child , throughout the remainder of that hard day , compelled herself to proceed : not even stopping to rest as frequently as usual , to compensate in some measure for the tardy pace at which she was obliged to walk . Evening was drawing on , but had not closed in , when -- still travelling among the same dismal objects -- they came to a busy town . Faint and spiritless as they were , its streets were insupportable . After humbly asking for relief at some few doors , and being repulsed , they agreed to make their way out of it as speedily as they could , and try if the inmates of any lone house beyond , would have more pity on their exhausted state . They were dragging themselves along through the last street , and the child felt that the time was close at hand when her enfeebled powers would bear no more . There appeared before them , at this juncture , going in the same direction as themselves , a traveller on foot , who , with a portmanteau strapped to his back , leaned upon a stout stick as he walked , and read from a book which he held in his other hand . It was not an easy matter to come up with him , and beseech his aid , for he walked fast , and was a little distance in advance . At length , he stopped , to look more attentively at some passage in his book . Animated with a ray of hope , the child shot on before her grandfather , and , going close to the stranger without rousing him by the sound of her footsteps , began , in a few faint words , to implore his help . He turned his head . The child clapped her hands together , uttered a wild shriek , and fell senseless at his feet . CHAPTER 46 It was the poor schoolmaster . No other than the poor schoolmaster . Scarcely less moved and surprised by the sight of the child than she had been on recognising him , he stood , for a moment , silent and confounded by this unexpected apparition , without even the presence of mind to raise her from the ground . But , quickly recovering his self - possession , he threw down his stick and book , and dropping on one knee beside her , endeavoured , by such simple means as occurred to him , to restore her to herself ; while her grandfather , standing idly by , wrung his hands , and implored her with many endearing expressions to speak to him , were it only a word . ‘
162378	162389	162373	162373	She	3711	’ said the schoolmaster , glancing upward into his face . ‘
162400	162401	162390	162390	You	3712	’ ‘
162408	162414	162402	162402	She	3711	’ rejoined the old man . ‘
162428	162874	162875	162875	I	0	’ Casting a look upon him , half - reproachful and half - compassionate , the schoolmaster took the child in his arms , and , bidding the old man gather up her little basket and follow him directly , bore her away at his utmost speed . There was a small inn within sight , to which , it would seem , he had been directing his steps when so unexpectedly overtaken . Towards this place he hurried with his unconscious burden , and rushing into the kitchen , and calling upon the company there assembled to make way for God ’s sake , deposited it on a chair before the fire . The company , who rose in confusion on the schoolmaster ’s entrance , did as people usually do under such circumstances . Everybody called for his or her favourite remedy , which nobody brought ; each cried for more air , at the same time carefully excluding what air there was , by closing round the object of sympathy ; and all wondered why somebody else did n’t do what it never appeared to occur to them might be done by themselves . The landlady , however , who possessed more readiness and activity than any of them , and who had withal a quicker perception of the merits of the case , soon came running in , with a little hot brandy and water , followed by her servant - girl , carrying vinegar , hartshorn , smelling - salts , and such other restoratives ; which , being duly administered , recovered the child so far as to enable her to thank them in a faint voice , and to extend her hand to the poor schoolmaster , who stood , with an anxious face , hard by . Without suffering her to speak another word , or so much as to stir a finger any more , the women straightway carried her off to bed ; and , having covered her up warm , bathed her cold feet , and wrapped them in flannel , they despatched a messenger for the doctor . The doctor , who was a red - nosed gentleman with a great bunch of seals dangling below a waistcoat of ribbed black satin , arrived with all speed , and taking his seat by the bedside of poor Nell , drew out his watch , and felt her pulse . Then he looked at her tongue , then he felt her pulse again , and while he did so , he eyed the half - emptied wine - glass as if in profound abstraction . ‘
162880	162887	162875	162875	I	0	’ said the doctor at length , ‘
162904	162905	162875	162875	I	0	’ ‘
162918	162924	162925	162925	I	0	’ said the delighted landlady . ‘
162929	162945	162946	162946	I	0	’ observed the doctor , who had passed the foot - bath on the stairs , ‘
162950	162962	162946	162946	I	0	’ said the doctor , in the voice of an oracle , ‘
162981	162989	162977	162977	I	0	’ said the doctor with increased solemnity , ‘
163004	163005	162977	162977	I	0	’ ‘
163024	163069	163070	163070	You	0	’ cried the landlady . And so indeed it was , for the schoolmaster had ordered it to be put down , and it was getting on so well that the doctor might have smelt it if he had tried ; perhaps he did . ‘
163074	163082	163070	163070	You	0	’ said the doctor , rising gravely , ‘
163097	163098	163103	163103	Sir	5863	’ ‘
163105	163110	163103	163103	Sir	5863	’ suggested the landlady . ‘
163113	163130	163103	163103	Sir	5863	’ said the doctor , in the tone of a man who makes a dignified concession . ‘
163154	163649	163152	163152	ma’am	609	’ With which parting injunction , slowly and portentously delivered , the doctor departed , leaving the whole house in admiration of that wisdom which tallied so closely with their own . Everybody said he was a very shrewd doctor indeed , and knew perfectly what people ’s constitutions were ; which there appears some reason to suppose he did . While her supper was preparing , the child fell into a refreshing sleep , from which they were obliged to rouse her when it was ready . As she evinced extraordinary uneasiness on learning that her grandfather was below stairs , and as she was greatly troubled at the thought of their being apart , he took his supper with her . Finding her still very restless on this head , they made him up a bed in an inner room , to which he presently retired . The key of this chamber happened by good fortune to be on that side of the door which was in Nell ’s room ; she turned it on him when the landlady had withdrawn , and crept to bed again with a thankful heart . The schoolmaster sat for a long time smoking his pipe by the kitchen fire , which was now deserted , thinking , with a very happy face , on the fortunate chance which had brought him so opportunely to the child ’s assistance , and parrying , as well as in his simple way he could , the inquisitive cross - examination of the landlady , who had a great curiosity to be made acquainted with every particular of Nell ’s life and history . The poor schoolmaster was so open - hearted , and so little versed in the most ordinary cunning or deceit , that she could not have failed to succeed in the first five minutes , but that he happened to be unacquainted with what she wished to know ; and so he told her . The landlady , by no means satisfied with this assurance , which she considered an ingenious evasion of the question , rejoined that he had his reasons of course . Heaven forbid that she should wish to pry into the affairs of her customers , which indeed were no business of hers , who had so many of her own . She had merely asked a civil question , and to be sure she knew it would meet with a civil answer . She was quite satisfied -- quite . She had rather perhaps that he would have said at once that he did n’t choose to be communicative , because that would have been plain and intelligible . However , she had no right to be offended of course . He was the best judge , and had a perfect right to say what he pleased ; nobody could dispute that for a moment . Oh dear , no ! ‘
163658	163664	163650	163650	I	0	’ said the mild schoolmaster , ‘
163688	163689	163681	163681	I	0	’ ‘
163701	163712	163696	163696	you	3720	’ rejoined the landlady , with ready good - humour , ‘
163715	163740	163741	163742	The landlord	1518	’m very sorry I have teazed you . But curiosity you know is the curse of our sex , and that ’s the fact . ’
163788	163829	163830	163830	he	7613	‘ You should question me for half - a - dozen hours at a sitting , and welcome , and I would answer you patiently for the kindness of heart you have shown to - night , if I could , ’
163833	163868	163830	163830	he	7613	‘ As it is , please to take care of her in the morning , and let me know early how she is ; and to understand that I am paymaster for the three . ’
164079	164092	164094	164095	the child	324	‘ It makes me unhappy even in the midst of all this kindness ’
164097	164140	164094	164095	the child	324	‘ to think that we should be a burden upon you . How can I ever thank you ? If I had not met you so far from home , I must have died , and he would have been left alone . ’
164141	164149	164151	164152	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ We ’ll not talk about dying , ’
164154	164172	164151	164152	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ and as to burdens , I have made my fortune since you slept at my cottage . ’
164173	164176	164178	164179	the child	324	‘ Indeed ! ’
164182	164186	164178	164179	the child	324	‘ Oh yes , ’
164191	164238	164178	164179	the child	324	‘ I have been appointed clerk and schoolmaster to a village a long way from here -- and a long way from the old one as you may suppose -- at five - and - thirty pounds a year . Five - and - thirty pounds ! ’
164239	164245	164247	164248	the child	324	‘ I am very glad , ’
164250	164257	164247	164248	the child	324	‘ so very , very glad . ’
164258	164267	164269	164270	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ I am on my way there now , ’
164272	164334	164269	164270	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ They allowed me the stage - coach - hire -- outside stage - coach - hire all the way . Bless you , they grudge me nothing . But as the time at which I am expected there , left me ample leisure , I determined to walk instead . How glad I am , to think I did so ! ’
164335	164342	164178	164179	the child	324	‘ How glad should we be ! ’
164343	164348	164350	164351	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ Yes , yes , ’
164359	164488	164489	164489	he	3740	‘ certainly , that ’s very true . But you -- where are you going , where are you coming from , what have you been doing since you left me , what had you been doing before ? Now , tell me -- do tell me . I know very little of the world , and perhaps you are better fitted to advise me in its affairs than I am qualified to give advice to you ; but I am very sincere , and I have a reason ( you have not forgotten it ) for loving you . I have felt since that time as if my love for him who died , had been transferred to you who stood beside his bed . If this , ’
164495	164523	164489	164489	he	3740	‘ is the beautiful creation that springs from ashes , let its peace prosper with me , as I deal tenderly and compassionately by this young child ! ’
164668	164754	164661	164662	The schoolmaster	7613	‘ This child!’--he thought--‘Has this child heroically persevered under all doubts and dangers , struggled with poverty and suffering , upheld and sustained by strong affection and the consciousness of rectitude alone ! And yet the world is full of such heroism . Have I yet to learn that the hardest and best - borne trials are those which are never chronicled in any earthly record , and are suffered every day ! And should I be surprised to hear the story of this child ! ’
164801	164809	164811	164812	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ We shall be sure to succeed , ’
164816	164827	164811	164812	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ The cause is too good a one to fail . ’
164966	165523	164921	164922	the landlady	7083	’ bells , the occasional smacking of the carter ’s whip , the smooth rolling of the great broad wheels , the rattle of the harness , the cheery good - nights of passing travellers jogging past on little short - stepped horses -- all made pleasantly indistinct by the thick awning , which seemed made for lazy listening under , till one fell asleep ! The very going to sleep , still with an indistinct idea , as the head jogged to and fro upon the pillow , of moving onward with no trouble or fatigue , and hearing all these sounds like dreamy music , lulling to the senses -- and the slow waking up , and finding one ’s self staring out through the breezy curtain half - opened in the front , far up into the cold bright sky with its countless stars , and downward at the driver ’s lantern dancing on like its namesake Jack of the swamps and marshes , and sideways at the dark grim trees , and forward at the long bare road rising up , up , up , until it stopped abruptly at a sharp high ridge as if there were no more road , and all beyond was sky -- and the stopping at the inn to bait , and being helped out , and going into a room with fire and candles , and winking very much , and being agreeably reminded that the night was cold , and anxious for very comfort ’s sake to think it colder than it was!--What a delicious journey was that journey in the waggon . Then the going on again -- so fresh at first , and shortly afterwards so sleepy . The waking from a sound nap as the mail came dashing past like a highway comet , with gleaming lamps and rattling hoofs , and visions of a guard behind , standing up to keep his feet warm , and of a gentleman in a fur cap opening his eyes and looking wild and stupefied -- the stopping at the turnpike where the man was gone to bed , and knocking at the door until he answered with a smothered shout from under the bed - clothes in the little room above , where the faint light was burning , and presently came down , night - capped and shivering , to throw the gate wide open , and wish all waggons off the road except by day . The cold sharp interval between night and morning -- the distant streak of light widening and spreading , and turning from grey to white , and from white to yellow , and from yellow to burning red -- the presence of day , with all its cheerfulness and life -- men and horses at the plough -- birds in the trees and hedges , and boys in solitary fields , frightening them away with rattles . The coming to a town -- people busy in the markets ; light carts and chaises round the tavern yard ; tradesmen standing at their doors ; men running horses up and down the street for sale ; pigs plunging and grunting in the dirty distance , getting off with long strings at their legs , running into clean chemists ’
165531	165554	165562	165563	the coachman	2800	‘ prentices ; the night coach changing horses -- the passengers cheerless , cold , ugly , and discontented , with three months ’
165931	165939	165941	165943	the delighted schoolmaster	3785	‘ See -- here ’s the church ! ’
165949	165981	165941	165943	the delighted schoolmaster	3785	‘ and that old building close beside it , is the schoolhouse , I ’ll be sworn . Five - and - thirty pounds a - year in this beautiful place ! ’
166150	166161	166163	166164	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ I must leave you somewhere for a few minutes , ’
166180	166208	166163	166164	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ I have a letter to present , and inquiries to make , you know . Where shall I take you ? To the little inn yonder ? ’
166209	166215	166217	166217	Nell	72	‘ Let us wait here , ’
166219	166237	166217	166217	Nell	72	‘ The gate is open . We will sit in the church porch till you come back . ’
166238	166244	166246	166247	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ A good place too , ’
166269	166286	166246	166247	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ Be sure that I come back with good news , and am not long gone ! ’
167193	167198	167199	167201	the single gentleman	2796	‘ Are you comfortable ? ’
167214	167222	167199	167201	the single gentleman	2796	‘ Quite , Sir , thank you . ’
167223	167232	167199	167201	the single gentleman	2796	‘ Are you sure ? An’t you cold ? ’
167233	167242	167243	167243	Kit	75	‘ It is a little chilly , Sir , ’
167249	167254	167256	167258	the single gentleman	2796	‘ I knew it ! ’
167268	167307	167256	167258	the single gentleman	2796	‘ She wants some brandy and water ! Of course she does . How could I forget it ? Hallo ! Stop at the next inn , and call out for a glass of hot brandy and water . ’
167421	167423	167409	167409	he	2796	‘ You ’re
167426	167442	167409	167409	he	2796	’ said the single gentleman , who did nothing himself but walk about the room . ‘
167455	167458	167452	167452	ma’am	609	’re faint . ’
167459	167466	167452	167452	ma’am	609	‘ Thank you , sir , I ’m

167609	167615	167606	167606	You	609	’ said the single gentleman . ‘
167631	167778	167622	167622	I	0	’ Immediately flying to the bell , and calling for mulled wine as impetuously as if it had been wanted for instant use in the recovery of some person apparently drowned , the single gentleman made Kit ’s mother swallow a bumper of it at such a high temperature that the tears ran down her face , and then hustled her off to the chaise again , where -- not impossibly from the effects of this agreeable sedative -- she soon became insensible to his restlessness , and fell fast asleep . Nor were the happy effects of this prescription of a transitory nature , as , notwithstanding that the distance was greater , and the journey longer , than the single gentleman had anticipated , she did not awake until it was broad day , and they were clattering over the pavement of a town . ‘
167784	167795	167622	167622	I	0	’ cried her companion , letting down all the glasses . ‘
167803	167896	167622	167622	I	0	’ The boy on the wheeler touched his hat , and setting spurs to his horse , to the end that they might go in brilliantly , all four broke into a smart canter , and dashed through the streets with a noise that brought the good folks wondering to their doors and windows , and drowned the sober voices of the town - clocks as they chimed out half - past eight . They drove up to a door round which a crowd of persons were collected , and there stopped . ‘
167901	167911	167622	167622	I	0	’ said the single gentleman thrusting out his head . ‘
167918	167919	167622	167622	I	0	’ ‘
167927	167932	167622	167622	I	0	’ cried several voices . ‘
167935	167978	167622	167622	I	0	’ The single gentleman , rather bewildered by finding himself the centre of this noisy throng , alighted with the assistance of one of the postilions , and handed out Kit ’s mother , at sight of whom the populace cried out , ‘
167984	167992	167622	167622	I	0	’ and roared and leaped for joy . ‘
168002	168017	167999	167999	I	0	’ said the single gentleman , pressing through the concourse with his supposed bride . ‘
168030	168104	168027	168027	me	0	’ Anything that makes a noise is satisfactory to a crowd . A score of dirty hands were raised directly to knock for him , and seldom has a knocker of equal powers been made to produce more deafening sounds than this particular engine on the occasion in question . Having rendered these voluntary services , the throng modestly retired a little , preferring that the single gentleman should bear their consequences alone . ‘
168114	168142	168111	168111	you	5863	’ said a man with a large white bow at his button - hole , opening the door , and confronting him with a very stoical aspect . ‘
168152	168158	168159	168159	I	0	’ said the single gentleman . ‘
168162	168163	168159	168159	I	0	’ ‘
168175	168176	168159	168159	I	0	’ ‘
168184	168196	168159	168159	I	0	’ returned the bridegroom , eyeing him from top to toe . ‘
168200	168232	168159	168159	I	0	’ cried the single gentleman , drawing the arm of Kit ’s mother more tightly through his own , for that good woman evidently had it in contemplation to run away . ‘
168284	168333	168275	168275	You	5863	’ As he propounded this question , which Kit ’s mother echoed , somebody in a room near at hand , uttered a great shriek , and a stout lady in a white dress came running to the door , and supported herself upon the bridegroom ’s arm . ‘
168338	168343	168336	168336	she	3884	’ cried this lady . ‘
168357	168413	168414	168414	I	0	’ The single gentleman started back , and gazed upon the face of the late Mrs Jarley ( that morning wedded to the philosophic George , to the eternal wrath and despair of Mr Slum the poet ) , with looks of conflicting apprehension , disappointment , and incredulity . At length he stammered out , ‘
168426	168427	168423	168423	you	5863	’ ‘
168431	168436	168423	168423	you	5863	’ cried the bride , ‘
168457	168458	168451	168451	you	0	’ ‘
168466	168480	168451	168451	you	0	’ said the person to whom she addressed herself , turning very pale . ‘
168489	168490	168491	168491	I	0	’ ‘
168495	168502	168493	168493	God	71	’ cried the single gentleman feebly . ‘
168508	168526	168504	168504	me	0	’ They drew back to admit him , and when he had entered , closed the door . ‘
168535	168547	168532	168533	good people	1541	’ he said , turning to the newly - married couple , ‘
168636	168637	168638	168638	I	0	’ ‘
168643	168648	168638	168638	I	0	’ cried the bride , ‘
168683	169073	169076	169076	we	3895	’ With that , they related to him , without disguise or concealment , all that they knew of Nell and her grandfather , from their first meeting with them , down to the time of their sudden disappearance ; adding ( which was quite true ) that they had made every possible effort to trace them , but without success ; having been at first in great alarm for their safety , as well as on account of the suspicions to which they themselves might one day be exposed in consequence of their abrupt departure . They dwelt upon the old man ’s imbecility of mind , upon the uneasiness the child had always testified when he was absent , upon the company he had been supposed to keep , and upon the increased depression which had gradually crept over her and changed her both in health and spirits . Whether she had missed the old man in the night , and knowing or conjecturing whither he had bent his steps , had gone in pursuit , or whether they had left the house together , they had no means of determining . Certain they considered it , that there was but slender prospect left of hearing of them again , and that whether their flight originated with the old man , or with the child , there was now no hope of their return . To all this , the single gentleman listened with the air of a man quite borne down by grief and disappointment . He shed tears when they spoke of the grandfather , and appeared in deep affliction . Not to protract this portion of our narrative , and to make short work of a long story , let it be briefly written that before the interview came to a close , the single gentleman deemed he had sufficient evidence of having been told the truth , and that he endeavoured to force upon the bride and bridegroom an acknowledgment of their kindness to the unfriended child , which , however , they steadily declined accepting . In the end , the happy couple jolted away in the caravan to spend their honeymoon in a country excursion ; and the single gentleman and Kit ’s mother stood ruefully before their carriage - door . ‘
169082	169089	169076	169076	we	3895	’ said the post - boy . ‘
169095	169101	169090	169090	You	3896	’ said the single gentleman , ‘
169104	169111	169076	169076	we	3895	’ He was not going to add ‘
169114	169535	169076	169076	we	3895	’ but he added it for the sake of Kit ’s mother ; and to the inn they went . Rumours had already got abroad that the little girl who used to show the wax - work , was the child of great people who had been stolen from her parents in infancy , and had only just been traced . Opinion was divided whether she was the daughter of a prince , a duke , an earl , a viscount , or a baron , but all agreed upon the main fact , and that the single gentleman was her father ; and all bent forward to catch a glimpse , though it were only of the tip of his noble nose , as he rode away , desponding , in his four - horse chaise . What would he have given to know , and what sorrow would have been saved if he had only known , that at that moment both child and grandfather were seated in the old church porch , patiently awaiting the schoolmaster ’s return ! CHAPTER 48 Popular rumour concerning the single gentleman and his errand , travelling from mouth to mouth , and waxing stronger in the marvellous as it was bandied about -- for your popular rumour , unlike the rolling stone of the proverb , is one which gathers a deal of moss in its wanderings up and down -- occasioned his dismounting at the inn - door to be looked upon as an exciting and attractive spectacle , which could scarcely be enough admired ; and drew together a large concourse of idlers , who having recently been , as it were , thrown out of employment by the closing of the wax - work and the completion of the nuptial ceremonies , considered his arrival as little else than a special providence , and hailed it with demonstrations of the liveliest joy . Not at all participating in the general sensation , but wearing the depressed and wearied look of one who sought to meditate on his disappointment in silence and privacy , the single gentleman alighted , and handed out Kit ’s mother with a gloomy politeness which impressed the lookers - on extremely . That done , he gave her his arm and escorted her into the house , while several active waiters ran on before as a skirmishing party , to clear the way and to show the room which was ready for their reception . ‘
169541	169547	169076	169076	we	3895	’ said the single gentleman . ‘
169559	169560	169076	169076	we	3895	’ ‘
169574	169575	169076	169076	we	3895	’ ‘
169583	169615	169616	169616	He	518	’ said a voice , as a little out - of - the - way door at the foot of the well staircase flew briskly open and a head popped out . ‘
169658	169659	169076	169076	we	3895	’ ‘
169664	169676	169638	169638	you	5863	’ cried Kit ’s mother , falling back in extreme surprise , ‘
169682	169783	169785	169785	you	5863	’ She had some reason to be astonished , for the person who proffered the gracious invitation was no other than Daniel Quilp . The little door out of which he had thrust his head was close to the inn larder ; and there he stood , bowing with grotesque politeness ; as much at his ease as if the door were that of his own house ; blighting all the legs of mutton and cold roast fowls by his close companionship , and looking like the evil genius of the cellars come from underground upon some work of mischief . ‘
169791	169795	169785	169785	you	5863	’ said Quilp . ‘
169801	169807	169796	169796	I	0	’ replied the single gentleman . ‘
169810	169844	169796	169796	I	0	’ said Quilp . And with that , he darted in again with one jerk and clapped the little door to , like a figure in a Dutch clock when the hour strikes . ‘
169854	169860	169852	169852	sir	5863	’ whispered Kit ’s mother , ‘
169869	169870	169862	169862	I	0	’ ‘
169873	169880	169862	169862	I	0	’ said her fellow - passenger . ‘
169890	169891	169883	169884	that person	3907	’ ‘
169905	169906	169883	169884	that person	3907	’ ‘
169915	169916	169921	169921	sir	5863	’ ‘
169955	169956	169941	169941	he	3906	’ ‘
169964	169970	169941	169941	he	3906	’ said the single gentleman . ‘
169996	170064	169986	169986	him	3906	’ The man stared on receiving these instructions , for the single gentleman had not only displayed as much astonishment as Kit ’s mother at sight of the dwarf , but , standing in no fear of him , had been at less pains to conceal his dislike and repugnance . He departed on his errand , however , and immediately returned , ushering in its object . ‘
170070	170075	169986	169986	him	3906	’ said the dwarf , ‘
170100	170106	170086	170086	you	5863	’re well . I hope you ’re
170110	170147	170148	170148	Christopher	75	’ There was a short pause , while the dwarf , with half - shut eyes and puckered face , stood waiting for an answer . Receiving none , he turned towards his more familiar acquaintance . ‘
170152	170156	170148	170148	Christopher	75	’ he cried . ‘
170214	170290	170291	170292	Mr Quilp	84	’ Making his voice ascend in the scale with every succeeding question , Mr Quilp finished in a shrill squeak , and subsided into the panting look which was customary with him , and which , whether it were assumed or natural , had equally the effect of banishing all expression from his face , and rendering it , as far as it afforded any index to his mood or meaning , a perfect blank . ‘
170294	170317	170291	170292	Mr Quilp	84	’ said the single gentleman . The dwarf put his hand to his great flapped ear , and counterfeited the closest attention . ‘
170323	170324	170291	170292	Mr Quilp	84	’ ‘
170327	170335	170291	170292	Mr Quilp	84	’ cried Quilp , nodding his head . ‘
170371	170372	170373	170373	You	5863	’ ‘
170419	170420	170397	170397	I	0	’ ‘
170435	170452	170453	170453	I	0	’ said Quilp , conferring with himself , in imitation of his friend Mr Sampson Brass . ‘
170456	170462	170453	170453	I	0	’ said the single gentleman , ‘
170515	170516	170517	170517	We	3937	’ ‘
170529	170533	170534	170534	we	3937	’ rejoined Quilp , ‘
170559	170560	170548	170548	his	3932	’ ‘
170564	170571	170572	170572	He	3932	’ said the single gentleman angrily . ‘
170576	170577	170572	170572	He	3932	’ ‘
170584	170594	170580	170580	he	3932	’ said Quilp , with the same exasperating composure . ‘
170615	170616	170580	170580	he	3932	’ ‘
170625	170635	170621	170621	I	0	’ said the single gentleman , sternly regarding him , ‘
170676	170677	170678	170678	I	0	’ ‘
170681	170685	170678	170678	I	0	’ cried Quilp . ‘
170692	170706	170689	170689	you	5863	’ returned his questioner , fretted into a state of the utmost irritation . ‘
170734	170735	170736	170736	She	3889	’ ‘
170744	170752	170736	170736	She	3889	’ said Quilp , still perfectly unmoved . ‘
170867	170919	170859	170859	I	0	’ That Quilp lied most heartily in this speech , it needed no very great penetration to discover , although for anything that he suffered to appear in his face , voice , or manner , he might have been clinging to the truth with the quiet constancy of a martyr . ‘
170935	170942	170944	170944	you	665	’ said the unfortunate single gentleman , ‘
170986	170987	170988	170988	You	3952	’ ‘
170991	170997	170999	170999	Quilp	84	’m a conjuror , sir , ’
171006	171022	170999	170999	Quilp	84	‘ If I was , I should tell my own fortune -- and make it . ’
171023	171037	171039	171040	the other	5966	‘ Ah ! we have said all we need say , I see , ’
171049	171058	171039	171040	the other	5966	‘ Pray leave us , if you please . ’
171059	171062	171064	171064	Quilp	84	‘ Willingly , ’
171066	171090	171064	171064	Quilp	84	‘ Most willingly . Christopher ’s mother , my good soul , farewell . A pleasant journey -- back , sir . Ahem ! ’
171135	171138	171139	171139	he	84	‘ Oho ! ’
171161	171175	171139	171139	he	84	‘ Oho ! Are you there , my friend ? In - deed ! ’
172010	172021	172022	172022	he	84	‘ You are there , are you , my friend ? ’
172030	172069	172070	172070	he	84	‘ I am suspected and thrown aside , and Kit ’s the confidential agent , is he ? I shall have to dispose of him , I fear . If we had come up with them this morning , ’
172078	172200	172202	172203	the dwarf	6020	‘ I was ready to prove a pretty good claim . I could have made my profit . But for these canting hypocrites , the lad and his mother , I could get this fiery gentleman as comfortably into my net as our old friend -- our mutual friend , ha ! ha!--and chubby , rosy Nell . At the worst , it ’s a golden opportunity , not to be lost . Let us find them first , and I ’ll find means of draining you of some of your superfluous cash , sir , while there are prison bars , and bolts , and locks , to keep your friend or kinsman safely . I hate your virtuous people ! ’
172217	172222	172214	172214	his	6020	‘ ah ! I hate ‘
172227	172790	172202	172203	the dwarf	6020	’ This was not a mere empty vaunt , but a deliberate avowal of his real sentiments ; for Mr Quilp , who loved nobody , had by little and little come to hate everybody nearly or remotely connected with his ruined client:--the old man himself , because he had been able to deceive him and elude his vigilance -- the child , because she was the object of Mrs Quilp ’s commiseration and constant self - reproach -- the single gentleman , because of his unconcealed aversion to himself -- Kit and his mother , most mortally , for the reasons shown . Above and beyond that general feeling of opposition to them , which would have been inseparable from his ravenous desire to enrich himself by these altered circumstances , Daniel Quilp hated them every one . In this amiable mood , Mr Quilp enlivened himself and his hatreds with more brandy , and then , changing his quarters , withdrew to an obscure alehouse , under cover of which seclusion he instituted all possible inquiries that might lead to the discovery of the old man and his grandchild . But all was in vain . Not the slightest trace or clue could be obtained . They had left the town by night ; no one had seen them go ; no one had met them on the road ; the driver of no coach , cart , or waggon , had seen any travellers answering their description ; nobody had fallen in with them , or heard of them . Convinced at last that for the present all such attempts were hopeless , he appointed two or three scouts , with promises of large rewards in case of their forwarding him any intelligence , and returned to London by next day ’s coach . It was some gratification to Mr Quilp to find , as he took his place upon the roof , that Kit ’s mother was alone inside ; from which circumstance he derived in the course of the journey much cheerfulness of spirit , inasmuch as her solitary condition enabled him to terrify her with many extraordinary annoyances ; such as hanging over the side of the coach at the risk of his life , and staring in with his great goggle eyes , which seemed in hers the more horrible from his face being upside down ; dodging her in this way from one window to another ; getting nimbly down whenever they changed horses and thrusting his head in at the window with a dismal squint : which ingenious tortures had such an effect upon Mrs Nubbles , that she was quite unable for the time to resist the belief that Mr Quilp did in his own person represent and embody that Evil Power , who was so vigorously attacked at Little Bethel , and who , by reason of her backslidings in respect of Astley ’s and oysters , was now frolicsome and rampant . Kit , having been apprised by letter of his mother ’s intended return , was waiting for her at the coach - office ; and great was his surprise when he saw , leering over the coachman ’s shoulder like some familiar demon , invisible to all eyes but his , the well - known face of Quilp . ‘
172797	172807	172202	172203	the dwarf	6020	’ croaked the dwarf from the coach - top . ‘

172829	172833	172827	172827	mother	6118	’ whispered Kit . ‘
172847	172859	172834	172834	I	0	’ rejoined Mrs Nubbles , dismounting with her son ’s assistance , ‘
172878	172879	172880	172880	He	75	’ ‘
172883	172887	172880	172880	He	75	’ cried Kit . ‘
172899	172904	172888	172888	You	0	’ replied his mother , ‘
172959	172990	172939	172939	he	75	’ In spite of his mother ’s injunction , Kit turned sharply round to look . Mr Quilp was serenely gazing at the stars , quite absorbed in celestial contemplation . ‘
172999	173004	172993	172993	he	75	’ cried Mrs Nubbles . ‘
173018	173019	173024	173024	mother	6118	’ ‘
173033	173045	173029	173029	I	0	’ Mr Quilp affected to start , and looked smilingly round . ‘
173055	173059	173053	173053	you	8925	’ said Kit . ‘
173101	173102	173103	173103	Monster	242	’ ‘
173105	173114	173103	173103	Monster	242	’ said Quilp inwardly , with a smile . ‘
173130	173131	173132	173132	You	8925	’ ‘
173141	173149	173132	173132	You	8925	’ resumed Kit , shouldering the bandbox , ‘
173177	173227	173228	173228	Quilp	84	’m sure we never interfered with you . This is n’t the first time ; and if ever you worry or frighten her again , you ’ll oblige me ( though I should be very sorry to do it , on account of your size ) to beat you . ’
173674	173677	173679	173681	the jealous dwarf	4024	‘ Ha ! ’
173683	173694	173679	173681	the jealous dwarf	4024	‘ What ’s this ! Do they entertain visitors while I ’m
173697	173735	173679	173681	the jealous dwarf	4024	’ A smothered cough from above , was the reply . He felt in his pockets for his latch - key , but had forgotten it . There was no resource but to knock at the door . ‘
173742	173751	173679	173681	the jealous dwarf	4024	’ said Quilp , peeping through the keyhole . ‘
173776	173833	173834	173834	You	0	’ A very low and gentle rap received no answer from within . But after a second application to the knocker , no louder than the first , the door was softly opened by the boy from the wharf , whom Quilp instantly gagged with one hand , and dragged into the street with the other . ‘
173841	173846	173834	173834	You	0	’ whispered the boy . ‘
173853	173854	173851	173851	you	5881	’ ‘
173863	173871	173873	173873	me	0	’ retorted Quilp in the same tone . ‘
173892	173990	173884	173884	I	0	’ The boy could only point to the window , and reply with a stifled giggle , expressive of such intense enjoyment , that Quilp clutched him by the throat and might have carried his threat into execution , or at least have made very good progress towards that end , but for the boy ’s nimbly extricating himself from his grasp , and fortifying himself behind the nearest post , at which , after some fruitless attempts to catch him by the hair of the head , his master was obliged to come to a parley . ‘
173996	174000	173992	173992	you	5881	’ said Quilp . ‘
174008	174009	173992	173992	you	5881	’ ‘
174017	174022	174023	174023	They	4031	’ replied the boy . ‘
174040	174041	174029	174029	ha!--they	4032	’ ‘
174044	174055	174059	174059	they	4031	’ cried Quilp , relaxing into a grim laugh himself . ‘
174068	174069	174062	174062	they	4031	’ ‘
174077	174095	174096	174096	You	5881	’ replied the boy , who in his malicious nature had a strong infusion of his master . ‘
174117	174202	174108	174108	they	4031	’ The prospect of playing the spy under such delicious circumstances , and of disappointing them all by walking in alive , gave more delight to Quilp than the greatest stroke of good fortune could possibly have inspired him with . He was no less tickled than his hopeful assistant , and they both stood for some seconds , grinning and gasping and wagging their heads at each other , on either side of the post , like an unmatchable pair of Chinese idols . ‘
174207	174218	174108	174108	they	4031	’ said Quilp , making towards the door on tiptoe . ‘
174247	174669	174242	174243	Mrs Quilp	83	’ So saying , he blew out the candle , kicked off his shoes , and groped his way up stairs ; leaving his delighted young friend in an ecstasy of summersets on the pavement . The bedroom - door on the staircase being unlocked , Mr Quilp slipped in , and planted himself behind the door of communication between that chamber and the sitting - room , which standing ajar to render both more airy , and having a very convenient chink ( of which he had often availed himself for purposes of espial , and had indeed enlarged with his pocket - knife ) , enabled him not only to hear , but to see distinctly , what was passing . Applying his eye to this convenient place , he descried Mr Brass seated at the table with pen , ink , and paper , and the case - bottle of rum -- his own case - bottle , and his own particular Jamaica -- convenient to his hand ; with hot water , fragrant lemons , white lump sugar , and all things fitting ; from which choice materials , Sampson , by no means insensible to their claims upon his attention , had compounded a mighty glass of punch reeking hot ; which he was at that very moment stirring up with a teaspoon , and contemplating with looks in which a faint assumption of sentimental regret , struggled but weakly with a bland and comfortable joy . At the same table , with both her elbows upon it , was Mrs Jiniwin ; no longer sipping other people ’s punch feloniously with teaspoons , but taking deep draughts from a jorum of her own ; while her daughter -- not exactly with ashes on her head , or sackcloth on her back , but preserving a very decent and becoming appearance of sorrow nevertheless -- was reclining in an easy chair , and soothing her grief with a smaller allowance of the same glib liquid . There were also present , a couple of water - side men , bearing between them certain machines called drags ; even these fellows were accommodated with a stiff glass a - piece ; and as they drank with a great relish , and were naturally of a red - nosed , pimple - faced , convivial look , their presence rather increased than detracted from that decided appearance of comfort , which was the great characteristic of the party . ‘
174683	174687	174671	174671	I	0	’ murmured Quilp , ‘
174693	174694	174733	174733	he	4035	’ ‘
174697	174717	174733	174733	he	4035	’ said Mr Brass , breaking the silence , and raising his eyes to the ceiling with a sigh , ‘
174757	174787	174788	174788	I	0	’ Here Mr Brass stopped to drink half his punch , and then resumed ; looking at the other half , as he spoke , with a dejected smile . ‘
174793	174801	174788	174788	I	0	’ said the lawyer shaking his head , ‘
174830	174879	174819	174819	we	4036	’ One minute we are here’--holding his tumbler before his eyes--‘the next we are there’--gulping down its contents , and striking himself emphatically a little below the chest--‘in the silent tomb . To think that I should be drinking his very rum ! It seems like a dream . ’
174920	174929	174901	174901	he	127	‘ The search has been quite unsuccessful then ? ’
174930	174965	174966	174968	The other gentleman	4038	‘ Quite , master . But I should say that if he turns up anywhere , he ’ll come ashore somewhere about Grinidge to - morrow , at ebb tide , eh , mate ? ’
174994	175004	175006	175007	Mr Brass	127	‘ Then we have nothing for it but resignation , ’
175009	175033	175006	175007	Mr Brass	127	‘ nothing but resignation and expectation . It would be a comfort to have his body ; it would be a dreary comfort . ’
175034	175041	175043	175044	Mrs Jiniwin	88	‘ Oh , beyond a doubt , ’
175047	175060	175043	175044	Mrs Jiniwin	88	‘ if we once had that , we should be quite sure . ’
175061	175069	175071	175072	Sampson Brass	127	‘ With regard to the descriptive advertisement , ’
175079	175095	175071	175072	Sampson Brass	127	‘ It is a melancholy pleasure to recall his traits . Respecting his legs now-- ? ’
175096	175101	175103	175104	Mrs Jiniwin	88	‘ Crooked , certainly , ’
175106	175114	175116	175116	Brass	127	‘ Do you think they WERE crooked ? ’
175123	175140	175116	175116	Brass	127	‘ I think I see them now coming up the street very wide apart , in nankeen ’
175165	175166	175161	175161	we	4041	’ ‘
175175	175183	175167	175167	I	0	’ observed Mrs Quilp with a sob . ‘
175187	175196	175167	175167	I	0	’ said Brass , writing as he spoke . ‘
175205	175206	175223	175223	ma’am	609	’ ‘
175210	175215	175223	175223	ma’am	609	’ suggested Mrs Jiniwin . ‘
175225	175230	175216	175216	We	4041	’ said Brass piously . ‘
175267	175268	175264	175265	Mrs Jiniwin	88	’ ‘
175276	175282	175271	175271	you	4045	’ said the old lady . ‘
175287	175288	175271	175271	you	4045	’ ‘
175298	175302	175304	175304	she	4046	’ muttered Quilp . ‘
175312	175313	175304	175304	she	4046	’ ‘
175319	175333	175304	175304	she	4046	’ said the lawyer , laying down his pen and emptying his glass , ‘
175405	175415	175416	175416	his	4043	’ said Mr Brass smiling fondly at the wall , ‘
175442	175443	175444	175444	You	0	’ ‘
175452	175458	175444	175444	You	0	’ said Mrs Jiniwin impatiently . ‘
175465	175470	175461	175461	ma’am	609	’ cried Mr Brass . ‘
175503	175504	175490	175490	ma’am	609	’ ‘
175507	175512	175490	175490	ma’am	609	’ said Mrs Jiniwin . ‘
175515	175532	175533	175533	Aquiline	244	’ cried Quilp , thrusting in his head , and striking the feature with his fist . ‘
175554	175555	175550	175550	you	609	’ ‘
175561	175572	175550	175550	you	609	’ shouted Brass , from the mere force of habit . ‘
175602	175719	175581	175581	He	4043	’ Quilp paid no regard whatever to these compliments , nor to the dubious and frightened look into which the lawyer gradually subsided , nor to the shrieks of his wife and mother - in - law , nor to the latter ’s running from the room , nor to the former ’s fainting away . Keeping his eye fixed on Sampson Brass , he walked up to the table , and beginning with his glass , drank off the contents , and went regularly round until he had emptied the other two , when he seized the case - bottle , and hugging it under his arm , surveyed him with a most extraordinary leer . ‘
175725	175729	175723	175723	Sampson	127	’ said Quilp . ‘
175734	175735	175723	175723	Sampson	127	’ ‘
175741	175751	175752	175752	Ha	4058	’ cried Brass , recovering his spirits a little . ‘
175798	175799	175783	175783	he	4060	’ ‘
175803	175811	175783	175783	he	4060	’ said the dwarf , nodding expressively . ‘
175820	175831	175815	175815	sir	5863	’ cried the lawyer , retreating backwards towards the door . ‘
175857	175902	175904	175904	you	5863	’ Waiting until Mr Brass ’s ejaculations died away in the distance ( for he continued to pour them out , all the way down stairs ) , Quilp advanced towards the two men , who yet lingered in a kind of stupid amazement . ‘
175914	175927	175904	175904	you	5863	’ said the dwarf , holding the door open with great politeness . ‘
175934	175935	175932	175932	master	5881	’ ‘
175964	176263	176265	176265	you	4065	’ The men looked at each other , but had evidently no inclination to argue the point just then , and shuffled out of the room . The speedy clearance effected , Quilp locked the doors ; and still embracing the case - bottle with shrugged - up shoulders and folded arms , stood looking at his insensible wife like a dismounted nightmare . CHAPTER 50 Matrimonial differences are usually discussed by the parties concerned in the form of dialogue , in which the lady bears at least her full half share . Those of Mr and Mrs Quilp , however , were an exception to the general rule ; the remarks which they occasioned being limited to a long soliloquy on the part of the gentleman , with perhaps a few deprecatory observations from the lady , not extending beyond a trembling monosyllable uttered at long intervals , and in a very submissive and humble tone . On the present occasion , Mrs Quilp did not for a long time venture even on this gentle defence , but when she had recovered from her fainting - fit , sat in a tearful silence , meekly listening to the reproaches of her lord and master . Of these Mr Quilp delivered himself with the utmost animation and rapidity , and with so many distortions of limb and feature , that even his wife , although tolerably well accustomed to his proficiency in these respects , was well - nigh beside herself with alarm . But the Jamaica rum , and the joy of having occasioned a heavy disappointment , by degrees cooled Mr Quilp ’s wrath ; which from being at savage heat , dropped slowly to the bantering or chuckling point , at which it steadily remained . ‘
176276	176280	176274	176274	you	4065	’ said Quilp . ‘
176299	176300	176296	176296	you	4065	’ ‘
176305	176310	176303	176303	Quilp	84	’ returned his wife . ‘
176312	176315	176296	176296	you	4065	’m very sorry-- ’
176316	176321	176323	176324	the dwarf	6020	‘ Who doubts it ! ’
176326	176341	176323	176324	the dwarf	6020	‘ You very sorry ! to be sure you are . Who doubts that you ’re
176345	176346	176323	176324	the dwarf	6020	’ ‘
176362	176367	176353	176353	you	84	’ said his wife , ‘
176394	176472	176391	176391	I	0	’ In truth Mrs Quilp did seem a great deal more glad to behold her lord than might have been expected , and did evince a degree of interest in his safety which , all things considered , was rather unaccountable . Upon Quilp , however , this circumstance made no impression , farther than as it moved him to snap his fingers close to his wife ’s eyes , with divers grins of triumph and derision . ‘
176499	176508	176475	176475	you	84	’ asked the poor little woman , sobbing . ‘
176518	176519	176511	176511	you	84	’ ‘
176529	176534	176522	176522	I	0	’ cried the dwarf . ‘
176543	176558	176511	176511	you	84	’m in the humour now . I shall be cruel when I like . I ’m
176563	176564	176542	176542	I	0	’ ‘
176568	176569	176542	176542	I	0	’ ‘
176575	176581	176574	176574	I	0	’m going away now . I ’m
176622	176627	176620	176620	Damme	131	’ screamed the dwarf , ‘
176636	176637	176638	176638	You	0	’ ‘
176646	176651	176638	176638	You	0	’ sobbed his wife . ‘
176656	176666	176652	176652	I	0	’ said the dwarf , exulting in his project , ‘
176751	176752	176748	176749	Tom Scott	245	’ ‘
176759	176774	176757	176757	master	5881	’ cried the voice of the boy , as Quilp threw up the window . ‘
176781	176786	176757	176757	master	5881	’ returned the dwarf , ‘
176819	177146	176817	176817	Halloa	95	’ With these exclamations , Mr Quilp caught up the poker , and hurrying to the door of the good lady ’s sleeping - closet , beat upon it therewith until she awoke in inexpressible terror , thinking that her amiable son - in - law surely intended to murder her in justification of the legs she had slandered . Impressed with this idea , she was no sooner fairly awake than she screamed violently , and would have quickly precipitated herself out of the window and through a neighbouring skylight , if her daughter had not hastened in to undeceive her , and implore her assistance . Somewhat reassured by her account of the service she was required to render , Mrs Jiniwin made her appearance in a flannel dressing - gown ; and both mother and daughter , trembling with terror and cold -- for the night was now far advanced -- obeyed Mr Quilp ’s directions in submissive silence . Prolonging his preparations as much as possible , for their greater comfort , that eccentric gentleman superintended the packing of his wardrobe , and having added to it with his own hands , a plate , knife and fork , spoon , teacup and saucer , and other small household matters of that nature , strapped up the portmanteau , took it on his shoulders , and actually marched off without another word , and with the case - bottle ( which he had never once put down ) still tightly clasped under his arm . Consigning his heavier burden to the care of Tom Scott when he reached the street , taking a dram from the bottle for his own encouragement , and giving the boy a rap on the head with it as a small taste for himself , Quilp very deliberately led the way to the wharf , and reached it at between three and four o’clock in the morning . ‘
177149	177179	177180	177180	Beautifully	246	’ said Quilp , when he had groped his way to the wooden counting - house , and opened the door with a key he carried about with him . ‘
177191	177515	177188	177188	you	246	’ With no more formal leave - taking or explanation , he clutched the portmanteau , shut the door on his attendant , and climbing on the desk , and rolling himself up as round as a hedgehog , in an old boat - cloak , fell fast asleep . Being roused in the morning at the appointed time , and roused with difficulty , after his late fatigues , Quilp instructed Tom Scott to make a fire in the yard of sundry pieces of old timber , and to prepare some coffee for breakfast ; for the better furnishing of which repast he entrusted him with certain small moneys , to be expended in the purchase of hot rolls , butter , sugar , Yarmouth bloaters , and other articles of housekeeping ; so that in a few minutes a savoury meal was smoking on the board . With this substantial comfort , the dwarf regaled himself to his heart ’s content ; and being highly satisfied with this free and gipsy mode of life ( which he had often meditated , as offering , whenever he chose to avail himself of it , an agreeable freedom from the restraints of matrimony , and a choice means of keeping Mrs Quilp and her mother in a state of incessant agitation and suspense ) , bestirred himself to improve his retreat , and render it more commodious and comfortable . With this view , he issued forth to a place hard by , where sea - stores were sold , purchased a second - hand hammock , and had it slung in seamanlike fashion from the ceiling of the counting - house . He also caused to be erected , in the same mouldy cabin , an old ship ’s stove with a rusty funnel to carry the smoke through the roof ; and these arrangements completed , surveyed them with ineffable delight . ‘
177527	177536	177188	177188	you	246	’ said the dwarf , ogling the accommodations ; ‘
177646	177735	177736	177736	Dick	77	’ Enjoining Tom Scott to await his return , and not to stand upon his head , or throw a summerset , or so much as walk upon his hands meanwhile , on pain of lingering torments , the dwarf threw himself into a boat , and crossing to the other side of the river , and then speeding away on foot , reached Mr Swiveller ’s usual house of entertainment in Bevis Marks , just as that gentleman sat down alone to dinner in its dusky parlour . ‘
177738	177751	177736	177736	Dick	77	’ said the dwarf , thrusting his head in at the door , ‘
177768	177769	177771	177771	you	77	’ ‘
177772	177778	177780	177781	Mr Swiveller	78	’re there , are you ? ’
177783	177788	177780	177781	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ how are you ? ’
177789	177794	177796	177796	Quilp	83	‘ How ’s Dick ? ’
177798	177808	177796	177796	Quilp	83	‘ How ’s the cream of clerkship , eh ? ’
177809	177817	177819	177820	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ Why , rather sour , sir , ’
177822	177832	177819	177820	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ Beginning to border upon cheesiness , in fact . ’
177833	177839	177841	177842	the dwarf	6020	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’
177846	177871	177841	177842	the dwarf	6020	‘ Has Sally proved unkind . “ Of all the girls that are so smart , there ’s none like-- ” eh , Dick ! ’
177872	177876	177878	177879	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ Certainly not , ’
177888	177904	177878	177879	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ none like her . She ’s the sphynx of private life , is Sally B. ’
177905	177907	177841	177842	the dwarf	6020	‘ You ’re
177912	177921	177841	177842	the dwarf	6020	’ said Quilp , drawing up a chair . ‘
177927	177928	177878	177879	Mr Swiveller	78	’ ‘
177937	177941	177878	177879	Mr Swiveller	78	’ returned Dick . ‘
177963	177964	177955	177955	I	0	’ ‘
177967	177972	177955	177955	I	0	’ said the dwarf . ‘
177981	177982	177979	177979	Dick	77	’ ‘
177987	177992	177996	177996	I	0	’ returned Mr Swiveller . ‘
178028	178122	178020	178020	Dick	77	’ Quilp looked at his companion with his eyes screwed up into a comical expression of curiosity , and patiently awaited his further explanation ; upon which , however , Mr Swiveller appeared in no hurry to enter , as he ate a very long dinner in profound silence , finally pushed away his plate , threw himself back into his chair , folded his arms , and stared ruefully at the fire , in which some ends of cigars were smoking on their own account , and sending up a fragrant odour . ‘
178140	178142	178131	178131	Dick	77	‘ You ’re
178160	178161	178157	178157	your	0	’ ‘
178167	178219	178164	178164	you	0	’ said Quilp . Mr Swiveller replied by taking from his pocket a small and very greasy parcel , slowly unfolding it , and displaying a little slab of plum - cake extremely indigestible in appearance , and bordered with a paste of white sugar an inch and a half deep . ‘
178227	178232	178222	178222	you	0	’ demanded Mr Swiveller . ‘
178240	178247	178222	178222	you	0	’ replied the dwarf , grinning . ‘
178256	178272	178251	178251	you	0	’ inquired Mr Swiveller , rubbing the pastry against his nose with a dreadful calmness . ‘
178275	178276	178251	178251	you	0	’ ‘
178278	178279	178251	178251	you	0	’ ‘
178282	178286	178251	178251	you	0	’ said Dick , ‘
178341	178398	178338	178339	Sophy Cheggs	250	’ With this extemporary adaptation of a popular ballad to the distressing circumstances of his own case , Mr Swiveller folded up the parcel again , beat it very flat between the palms of his hands , thrust it into his breast , buttoned his coat over it , and folded his arms upon the whole . ‘
178404	178409	178411	178411	Dick	77	’re satisfied , sir , ’
178413	178501	178411	178411	Dick	77	‘ and I hope Fred ’s satisfied . You went partners in the mischief , and I hope you like it . This is the triumph I was to have , is it ? It ’s like the old country - dance of that name , where there are two gentlemen to one lady , and one has her , and the other has n’t , but comes limping up behind to make out the figure . But it ’s Destiny , and mine ’s a crusher . ’
178660	178663	178665	178665	Quilp	84	‘ Ha ! ’
178667	178692	178665	178665	Quilp	84	‘ It will be our turn to giggle soon . And that reminds me -- you spoke of young Trent -- where is he ? ’
178731	178736	178738	178739	the dwarf	6020	‘ That ’s unfortunate , ’
178741	178769	178738	178739	the dwarf	6020	‘ for I came , in fact , to ask you about him . A thought has occurred to me , Dick ; your friend over the way-- ’
178770	178774	178693	178694	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ Which friend ? ’
178775	178781	178738	178739	the dwarf	6020	‘ In the first floor . ’
178782	178785	178738	178739	the dwarf	6020	‘ Yes ? ’
178786	178800	178693	178694	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ Your friend in the first floor , Dick , may know him . ’
178801	178808	178810	178811	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ No , he do n’t , ’
178817	178830	178814	178814	his	78	‘ Do n’t ! No , because he has never seen him , ’
178834	178890	178832	178832	Quilp	84	‘ but if we were to bring them together , who knows , Dick , but Fred , properly introduced , would serve his turn almost as well as little Nell or her grandfather -- who knows but it might make the young fellow ’s fortune , and , through him , yours , eh ? ’
178891	178901	178903	178904	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ Why , the fact is , you see , ’
178906	178914	178903	178904	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ that they HAVE been brought together . ’
178915	178919	178921	178922	the dwarf	6020	‘ Have been ! ’
178930	178935	178921	178922	the dwarf	6020	‘ Through whose means ? ’
178936	178940	178942	178942	Dick	77	‘ Through mine , ’
178947	178963	178942	178942	Dick	77	‘ Did n’t I mention it to you the last time you called over yonder ? ’
178964	178971	178973	178974	the dwarf	6020	‘ You know you did n’t , ’
178976	178980	178973	178974	the dwarf	6020	‘ I believe you ’re
178983	178987	178973	178974	the dwarf	6020	’ said Dick . ‘
179002	179015	178942	178942	Dick	77	‘ em together that very day . It was Fred ’s suggestion . ’
179016	179023	178942	178942	Dick	77	‘ And what came of it ? ’
179024	179129	179137	179138	the dwarf	6020	‘ Why , instead of my friend ’s bursting into tears when he knew who Fred was , embracing him kindly , and telling him that he was his grandfather , or his grandmother in disguise ( which we fully expected ) , he flew into a tremendous passion ; called him all manner of names ; said it was in a great measure his fault that little Nell and the old gentleman had ever been brought to poverty ; did n’t hint at our taking anything to drink ; and -- and in short rather turned us out of the room than otherwise . ’
179130	179135	179137	179138	the dwarf	6020	‘ That ’s strange , ’
179142	179153	179155	179155	Dick	77	‘ So we remarked to each other at the time , ’
179158	179163	179155	179155	Dick	77	‘ but quite true . ’
179270	179278	179280	179281	the dwarf	6020	‘ Have been brought together , eh ? ’
179289	179318	179280	179281	the dwarf	6020	‘ My friend has stolen a march upon me . It led him to nothing , and therefore is no great matter , save in the intention . I ’m
179340	179385	179280	179281	the dwarf	6020	’m sure of him where he is , whenever I want him for my own purposes , and , besides , he ’s a good unconscious spy on Brass , and tells , in his cups , all that he sees and hears . You ’re
179454	179816	179824	179824	his	4123	’ Pursuing these thoughts , and gasping as he went along , after his own peculiar fashion , Mr Quilp once more crossed the Thames , and shut himself up in his Bachelor ’s Hall , which , by reason of its newly - erected chimney depositing the smoke inside the room and carrying none of it off , was not quite so agreeable as more fastidious people might have desired . Such inconveniences , however , instead of disgusting the dwarf with his new abode , rather suited his humour ; so , after dining luxuriously from the public - house , he lighted his pipe , and smoked against the chimney until nothing of him was visible through the mist but a pair of red and highly inflamed eyes , with sometimes a dim vision of his head and face , as , in a violent fit of coughing , he slightly stirred the smoke and scattered the heavy wreaths by which they were obscured . In the midst of this atmosphere , which must infallibly have smothered any other man , Mr Quilp passed the evening with great cheerfulness ; solacing himself all the time with the pipe and the case - bottle ; and occasionally entertaining himself with a melodious howl , intended for a song , but bearing not the faintest resemblance to any scrap of any piece of music , vocal or instrumental , ever invented by man . Thus he amused himself until nearly midnight , when he turned into his hammock with the utmost satisfaction . The first sound that met his ears in the morning -- as he half opened his eyes , and , finding himself so unusually near the ceiling , entertained a drowsy idea that he must have been transformed into a fly or blue - bottle in the course of the night,--was that of a stifled sobbing and weeping in the room . Peeping cautiously over the side of his hammock , he descried Mrs Quilp , to whom , after contemplating her for some time in silence , he communicated a violent start by suddenly yelling out--‘Halloa ! ’
179817	179822	179824	179827	his poor little wife	4124	‘ Oh , Quilp ! ’
179832	179838	179824	179827	his poor little wife	4124	‘ How you frightened me ! ’
179839	179847	179849	179850	the dwarf	6020	‘ I meant to , you jade , ’
179852	179860	179849	179850	the dwarf	6020	‘ What do you want here ? I ’m
179866	179867	179864	179864	I	0	’ ‘
179878	179885	179824	179827	his poor little wife	4124	’ said Mrs Quilp , sobbing ; ‘
179911	179912	179932	179932	your	4129	’ ‘
179918	179923	179932	179932	your	4129	’ grinned the dwarf . ‘
179970	180009	180010	180012	Mrs Quilp durst	83	’ the Wisp , now here , now there , dancing about you always , starting up when you least expect me , and keeping you in a constant state of restlessness and irritation . Will you begone ? ’
180020	180026	180028	180029	the dwarf	6020	‘ I tell you no , ’
180031	180043	180028	180029	the dwarf	6020	‘ No . If you dare to come here again unless you ’re
180102	180103	180099	180099	you	4135	’ ‘
180112	180119	180120	180128	No - o - o - o - o	4136	’ said his wife , earnestly . ‘
180130	180134	180137	180137	my	0	’ roared Quilp . ‘
180175	180490	180165	180165	You	4135	’ Mr Quilp delivered this last command in such a very energetic voice , and moreover accompanied it with such a sudden gesture , indicative of an intention to spring out of his hammock , and , night - capped as he was , bear his wife home again through the public streets , that she sped away like an arrow . Her worthy lord stretched his neck and eyes until she had crossed the yard , and then , not at all sorry to have had this opportunity of carrying his point , and asserting the sanctity of his castle , fell into an immoderate fit of laughter , and laid himself down to sleep again . CHAPTER 51 The bland and open - hearted proprietor of Bachelor ’s Hall slept on amidst the congenial accompaniments of rain , mud , dirt , damp , fog , and rats , until late in the day ; when , summoning his valet Tom Scott to assist him to rise , and to prepare breakfast , he quitted his couch , and made his toilet . This duty performed , and his repast ended , he again betook himself to Bevis Marks . This visit was not intended for Mr Swiveller , but for his friend and employer Mr Sampson Brass . Both gentlemen however were from home , nor was the life and light of law , Miss Sally , at her post either . The fact of their joint desertion of the office was made known to all comers by a scrap of paper in the hand - writing of Mr Swiveller , which was attached to the bell - handle , and which , giving the reader no clue to the time of day when it was first posted , furnished him with the rather vague and unsatisfactory information that that gentleman would ‘
180496	180497	180165	180165	You	4135	’ ‘
180506	180518	180500	180501	a servant	4138	’ said the dwarf , knocking at the house - door . ‘
180523	180544	180519	180519	She	4138	’ After a sufficiently long interval , the door was opened , and a small voice immediately accosted him with , ‘
180555	180556	180548	180548	you	0	’ ‘
180559	180605	180548	180548	you	0	’ said the dwarf , looking down , ( it was something quite new to him ) upon the small servant . To this , the child , conducting her conversation as upon the occasion of her first interview with Mr Swiveller , again replied , ‘
180616	180617	180609	180609	you	0	’ ‘
180624	180636	180618	180618	I	0	’ said the dwarf , pushing past her into the office ; ‘
180648	180745	180618	180618	I	0	’ So Mr Quilp climbed up to the top of a tall stool to write the note , and the small servant , carefully tutored for such emergencies , looked on with her eyes wide open , ready , if he so much as abstracted a wafer , to rush into the street and give the alarm to the police . As Mr Quilp folded his note ( which was soon written : being a very short one ) he encountered the gaze of the small servant . He looked at her , long and earnestly . ‘
180750	180802	180748	180748	you	4138	’ said the dwarf , moistening a wafer with horrible grimaces . The small servant , perhaps frightened by his looks , returned no audible reply ; but it appeared from the motion of her lips that she was inwardly repeating the same form of expression concerning the note or message . ‘
180816	180943	180813	180814	a Tartar	4144	’ said Quilp with a chuckle . In reply to the last interrogation , the small servant , with a look of infinite cunning mingled with fear , screwed up her mouth very tight and round , and nodded violently . Whether there was anything in the peculiar slyness of her action which fascinated Mr Quilp , or anything in the expression of her features at the moment which attracted his attention for some other reason ; or whether it merely occurred to him as a pleasant whim to stare the small servant out of countenance ; certain it is , that he planted his elbows square and firmly on the desk , and squeezing up his cheeks with his hands , looked at her fixedly . ‘
180950	180962	180963	180963	I	0	’ he said after a long pause , stroking his chin . ‘
180968	180969	180963	180963	I	0	’ ‘
180975	180976	180972	180972	your	4138	’ ‘
180979	180980	180972	180972	your	4138	’ ‘
180983	180987	180972	180972	your	4138	’ retorted Quilp . ‘
180999	181000	180995	180995	she	8372	’ ‘
181005	181025	180995	180995	she	8372	’ said the child . She added in the same breath , as if fearful of any further questioning , ‘
181036	181373	181374	181374	You	4147	’ These unusual answers might naturally have provoked some more inquiries . Quilp , however , without uttering another word , withdrew his eyes from the small servant , stroked his chin more thoughtfully than before , and then , bending over the note as if to direct it with scrupulous and hair - breadth nicety , looked at her , covertly but very narrowly , from under his bushy eyebrows . The result of this secret survey was , that he shaded his face with his hands , and laughed slyly and noiselessly , until every vein in it was swollen almost to bursting . Pulling his hat over his brow to conceal his mirth and its effects , he tossed the letter to the child , and hastily withdrew . Once in the street , moved by some secret impulse , he laughed , and held his sides , and laughed again , and tried to peer through the dusty area railings as if to catch another glimpse of the child , until he was quite tired out . At last , he travelled back to the Wilderness , which was within rifle - shot of his bachelor retreat , and ordered tea in the wooden summer - house that afternoon for three persons ; an invitation to Miss Sally Brass and her brother to partake of that entertainment at that place , having been the object both of his journey and his note . It was not precisely the kind of weather in which people usually take tea in summer - houses , far less in summer - houses in an advanced state of decay , and overlooking the slimy banks of a great river at low water . Nevertheless , it was in this choice retreat that Mr Quilp ordered a cold collation to be prepared , and it was beneath its cracked and leaky roof that he , in due course of time , received Mr Sampson and his sister Sally . ‘
181375	181383	181385	181385	Quilp	84	’re fond of the beauties of nature , ’
181390	181405	181385	181385	Quilp	84	‘ Is this charming , Brass ? Is it unusual , unsophisticated , primitive ? ’
181406	181414	181416	181417	the lawyer	6603	‘ It ’s delightful indeed , sir , ’
181419	181422	181424	181424	Quilp	84	‘ Cool ? ’
181426	181438	181440	181440	Brass	125	‘ N - not particularly so , I think , sir , ’
181450	181460	181462	181462	Quilp	84	‘ Perhaps a little damp and ague - ish ? ’
181464	181474	181476	181476	Brass	125	‘ Just damp enough to be cheerful , sir , ’
181478	181487	181476	181476	Brass	125	‘ Nothing more , sir , nothing more . ’
181488	181492	181494	181496	the delighted dwarf	4150	‘ And Sally ? ’
181498	181504	181494	181496	the delighted dwarf	4150	‘ Does she like it ? ’
181505	181512	181514	181518	that strong - minded lady	4151	‘ She ’ll like it better , ’
181520	181537	181514	181518	that strong - minded lady	4151	‘ when she has tea ; so let us have it , and do n’t bother . ’
181538	181542	181544	181544	Quilp	84	‘ Sweet Sally ! ’
181556	181564	181547	181547	his	84	‘ Gentle , charming , overwhelming Sally . ’

181579	181593	181576	181577	Mr Brass	127	‘ He ’s quite a Troubadour , you know ; quite a Troubadour ! ’
182129	182133	182135	182136	the dwarf	6020	‘ A word , ’
182138	182151	182135	182136	the dwarf	6020	‘ before we go farther . Sally , hark’ee for a minute . ’
182175	182178	182180	182181	the dwarf	6020	‘ Business , ’
182189	182200	182180	182181	the dwarf	6020	‘ Very private business . Lay your heads together when you ’re

183882	183922	183873	183873	Nell	72	‘ Indeed I can not tell you what it was , but when I saw the outside , from the church porch , the same feeling came over me . It is its being so old and grey perhaps . ’

184053	184082	184049	184050	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ for many a merry year to come , I hope . I shall be a close neighbour -- only next door -- but this house is yours . ’
184294	184303	184305	184306	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ There ’s a small allowance of money , ’
184308	184341	184305	184306	the schoolmaster	7613	‘ It is not much , but still enough to live upon in this retired spot . By clubbing our funds together , we shall do bravely ; no fear of that . ’

With the brightness and joy of morning , came the renewal of yesterday ’s labours , the revival of its pleasant thoughts , the restoration of its energies , cheerfulness , and hope . They worked gaily in ordering and arranging their houses until noon , and then went to visit the clergyman . He was a simple - hearted old gentleman , of a shrinking , subdued spirit , accustomed to retirement , and very little acquainted with the world , which he had left many years before to come and settle in that place . His wife had died in the house in which he still lived , and he had long since lost sight of any earthly cares or hopes beyond it . He received them very kindly , and at once showed an interest in Nell ; asking her name , and age , her birthplace , the circumstances which had led her there , and so forth . The schoolmaster had already told her story . They had no other friends or home to leave , he said , and had come to share his fortunes . He loved the child as though she were his own . ‘
185657	185662	185667	185667	you	4280	’ said the clergyman . ‘
185675	185676	185670	185670	She	4281	’ ‘
185685	185690	185683	185683	sir	5863	’ replied the schoolmaster . ‘
185703	185709	185683	185683	sir	5863	’ said the old gentleman . ‘
185730	185731	185735	185735	sir	5863	’ ‘
185737	185741	185735	185735	sir	5863	’ returned Nell . ‘

185764	185781	185752	185752	I	0	’ said the old gentleman , laying his hand upon her head , and smiling sadly , ‘
185821	186150	186151	186151	You	4289	’ After more kind words , they withdrew , and repaired to the child ’s house ; where they were yet in conversation on their happy fortune , when another friend appeared . This was a little old gentleman , who lived in the parsonage - house , and had resided there ( so they learnt soon afterwards ) ever since the death of the clergyman ’s wife , which had happened fifteen years before . He had been his college friend and always his close companion ; in the first shock of his grief he had come to console and comfort him ; and from that time they had never parted company . The little old gentleman was the active spirit of the place , the adjuster of all differences , the promoter of all merry - makings , the dispenser of his friend ’s bounty , and of no small charity of his own besides ; the universal mediator , comforter , and friend . None of the simple villagers had cared to ask his name , or , when they knew it , to store it in their memory . Perhaps from some vague rumour of his college honours which had been whispered abroad on his first arrival , perhaps because he was an unmarried , unencumbered gentleman , he had been called the bachelor . The name pleased him , or suited him as well as any other , and the Bachelor he had ever since remained . And the bachelor it was , it may be added , who with his own hands had laid in the stock of fuel which the wanderers had found in their new habitation . The bachelor , then -- to call him by his usual appellation -- lifted the latch , showed his little round mild face for a moment at the door , and stepped into the room like one who was no stranger to it . ‘
186160	186170	186153	186154	Mr Marton	257	’ he said , greeting Nell ’s kind friend . ‘
186176	186177	186153	186154	Mr Marton	257	’ ‘
186270	186271	186272	186272	She	4293	’ ‘
186282	186305	186272	186272	She	4293	’ said the schoolmaster , in answer to the look with which their visitor regarded Nell when he had kissed her cheek . ‘
186315	186319	186310	186310	I	0	’ he rejoined . ‘
186328	186329	186334	186334	sir	5863	’ ‘
186336	186364	186334	186334	sir	5863	’ The little old gentleman glanced at the grandfather , and back again at the child , whose hand he took tenderly in his , and held . ‘
186371	186375	186334	186334	sir	5863	’ he said ; ‘
186404	186405	186408	186408	sir	5863	’ ‘
186410	186411	186408	186408	sir	5863	’ ‘
186429	186434	186436	186436	us	4303	’ said the bachelor . ‘
186444	186644	186436	186436	us	4303	’ Nell accompanied him into the other little rooms , and over both the houses , in which he found various small comforts wanting , which he engaged to supply from a certain collection of odds and ends he had at home , and which must have been a very miscellaneous and extensive one , as it comprehended the most opposite articles imaginable . They all came , however , and came without loss of time ; for the little old gentleman , disappearing for some five or ten minutes , presently returned , laden with old shelves , rugs , blankets , and other household gear , and followed by a boy bearing a similar load . These being cast on the floor in a promiscuous heap , yielded a quantity of occupation in arranging , erecting , and putting away ; the superintendence of which task evidently afforded the old gentleman extreme delight , and engaged him for some time with great briskness and activity . When nothing more was left to be done , he charged the boy to run off and bring his schoolmates to be marshalled before their new master , and solemnly reviewed . ‘
186661	186675	186652	186652	Marton	257	’ he said , turning to the schoolmaster when the boy was gone ; ‘
186681	186696	186697	186698	The messenger	7793	‘ em know I think so . That would n’t do , at all . ’
186824	186831	186833	186834	the bachelor	9979	‘ This first boy , schoolmaster , ’
186836	186938	186833	186834	the bachelor	9979	‘ is John Owen ; a lad of good parts , sir , and frank , honest temper ; but too thoughtless , too playful , too light - headed by far . That boy , my good sir , would break his neck with pleasure , and deprive his parents of their chief comfort -- and between ourselves , when you come to see him at hare and hounds , taking the fence and ditch by the finger - post , and sliding down the face of the little quarry , you ’ll never forget it . It ’s beautiful ! ’
186963	186973	186975	186976	the bachelor	9979	‘ Now , look at that lad , sir , ’
186978	187099	186975	186976	the bachelor	9979	‘ You see that fellow ? Richard Evans his name is , sir . An amazing boy to learn , blessed with a good memory , and a ready understanding , and moreover with a good voice and ear for psalm - singing , in which he is the best among us . Yet , sir , that boy will come to a bad end ; he ’ll never die in his bed ; he ’s always falling asleep in sermon - time -- and to tell you the truth , Mr Marton , I always did the same at his age , and feel quite certain that it was natural to my constitution and I could n’t help it . ’
187116	187127	187129	187129	he	9979	‘ But if we talk of examples to be shunned , ’
187131	187274	187276	187277	the bachelor	9979	‘ if we come to boys that should be a warning and a beacon to all their fellows , here ’s the one , and I hope you wo n’t spare him . This is the lad , sir ; this one with the blue eyes and light hair . This is a swimmer , sir , this fellow -- a diver , Lord save us ! This is a boy , sir , who had a fancy for plunging into eighteen feet of water , with his clothes on , and bringing up a blind man ’s dog , who was being drowned by the weight of his chain and collar , while his master stood wringing his hands upon the bank , bewailing the loss of his guide and friend . I sent the boy two guineas anonymously , sir , ’
187284	187312	187276	187277	the bachelor	9979	‘ directly I heard of it ; but never mention it on any account , for he has n’t the least idea that it came from me . ’
187933	187938	187940	187941	the child	324	‘ You are better ? ’
187949	187953	187955	187957	the old man	384	‘ Ay surely , ’
187959	187961	187955	187957	the old man	384	‘ I ’m

187999	188032	188038	188038	you	324	’ The old man limped on before , and warning her of the downward step , which he achieved himself with no small difficulty , led the way into his little cottage . ‘

188080	188123	188124	188124	I	0	’ The child wondered how a grey - headed man like him -- one of his trade too -- could talk of time so easily . He saw her eyes wandering to the tools that hung upon the wall , and smiled . ‘
188128	188132	188124	188124	I	0	’ he said , ‘
188144	188145	188134	188134	you	324	’ ‘

188323	188328	188292	188294	a poor one.--That	4366	’ said the child . ‘

188355	188356	188348	188348	you	324	’ ‘
188370	188376	188378	188378	they	4368	’ said the old man . ‘

188462	188467	188456	188460	one who is still alive	4370	’ said the child . ‘

188533	188560	188523	188523	I	0	’ The child looked quickly towards him , thinking that he jested with his age and infirmity : but the unconscious sexton was quite in earnest . ‘
188563	188572	188523	188523	I	0	’ he said , after a brief silence . ‘
188622	188623	188615	188615	You	4382	’ ‘
188630	188635	188624	188624	I	0	’ the child replied . ‘

188743	188838	188852	188853	the child	324	’ time , the water fell again , and a third knot was made . In ten years more , the well dried up ; and now , if you lower the bucket till your arms are tired , and let out nearly all the cord , you ’ll hear it , of a sudden , clanking and rattling on the ground below ; with a sound of being so deep and so far down , that your heart leaps into your mouth , and you start away as if you were falling in . ’
188839	188850	188852	188853	the child	324	‘ A dreadful place to come on in the dark ! ’
188874	188882	188884	188885	the sexton	7661	‘ What is it but a grave ! ’
188887	188922	188884	188885	the sexton	7661	‘ What else ! And which of our old folks , knowing all this , thought , as the spring subsided , of their own failing strength , and lessening life ? Not one ! ’
188923	188930	188932	188933	the child	324	‘ Are you very old yourself ? ’
188937	188948	188932	188933	the child	324	‘ I shall be seventy - nine -- next summer . ’
188949	188958	189030	189030	he	7661	‘ You still work when you are well ? ’
188959	189025	189026	189026	He	7661	‘ Work ! To be sure . You shall see my gardens hereabout . Look at the window there . I made , and have kept , that plot of ground entirely with my own hands . By this time next year I shall hardly see the sky , the boughs will have grown so thick . I have my winter work at night besides . ’
189058	189074	189075	189075	he	7661	‘ Some gentlefolks who are fond of ancient days , and what belongs to them , ’
189078	189145	189075	189075	he	7661	‘ like to buy these keepsakes from our church and ruins . Sometimes , I make them of scraps of oak , that turn up here and there ; sometimes of bits of coffins which the vaults have long preserved . See here -- this is a little chest of the last kind , clasped at the edges with fragments of brass plates that had writing on ‘
189181	189500	189506	189506	their	4391	’ The child admired and praised his work , and shortly afterwards departed ; thinking , as she went , how strange it was , that this old man , drawing from his pursuits , and everything around him , one stern moral , never contemplated its application to himself ; and , while he dwelt upon the uncertainty of human life , seemed both in word and deed to deem himself immortal . But her musings did not stop here , for she was wise enough to think that by a good and merciful adjustment this must be human nature , and that the old sexton , with his plans for next summer , was but a type of all mankind . Full of these meditations , she reached the church . It was easy to find the key belonging to the outer door , for each was labelled on a scrap of yellow parchment . Its very turning in the lock awoke a hollow sound , and when she entered with a faltering step , the echoes that it raised in closing , made her start . If the peace of the simple village had moved the child more strongly , because of the dark and troubled ways that lay beyond , and through which she had journeyed with such failing feet , what was the deep impression of finding herself alone in that solemn building , where the very light , coming through sunken windows , seemed old and grey , and the air , redolent of earth and mould , seemed laden with decay , purified by time of all its grosser particles , and sighing through arch and aisle , and clustered pillars , like the breath of ages gone !

191772	191779	191781	191781	David	262	‘ What ’s the matter now ? ’
191786	191793	191795	191796	the sexton	7661	‘ How old was Becky Morgan ? ’

191987	191998	191978	191978	you	384	’ asked the sexton , with signs of some emotion . ‘

192012	192013	191976	191976	you	384	’ ‘
192025	192031	192035	192035	you	384	’ cried the sexton petulantly ; ‘

192043	192047	192049	192051	the old man	384	‘ Oh quite , ’
192053	192057	192049	192051	the old man	384	‘ Why not ? ’
192058	192064	192069	192069	himself	7661	‘ He ’s exceedingly deaf , ’
192071	192079	192066	192067	the sexton	7661	‘ I think he ’s getting foolish . ’

192170	192173	192167	192168	the sexton	7661	‘ Not I. ’
192174	192185	192186	192187	the child	324	‘ I have seen some flowers and little shrubs about , ’
192190	192215	192186	192187	the child	324	‘ there are some over there , you see . I thought they were of your rearing , though indeed they grow but poorly . ’
192216	192223	192225	192227	the old man	384	‘ They grow as Heaven wills , ’
192229	192241	192225	192227	the old man	384	‘ and it kindly ordains that they shall never flourish here . ’
192242	192249	192186	192187	the child	324	‘ I do not understand you . ’
192250	192257	192259	192260	the sexton	7661	‘ Why , this it is , ’
192262	192277	192259	192260	the sexton	7661	‘ They mark the graves of those who had very tender , loving friends . ’
192278	192285	192286	192287	the child	324	‘ I was sure they did ! ’
192290	192300	192286	192287	the child	324	‘ I am very glad to know they do ! ’
192301	192304	192306	192308	the old man	384	‘ Aye , ’
192310	192337	192306	192308	the old man	384	‘ but stay . Look at them . See how they hang their heads , and droop , and wither . Do you guess the reason ? ’
192338	192341	192342	192343	the child	324	‘ No , ’
192346	192431	192342	192343	the child	324	‘ Because the memory of those who lie below , passes away so soon . At first they tend them , morning , noon , and night ; they soon begin to come less frequently ; from once a day , to once a week ; from once a week to once a month ; then , at long and uncertain intervals ; then , not at all . Such tokens seldom flourish long . I have known the briefest summer flowers outlive them . ’
192432	192439	192441	192442	the child	324	‘ I grieve to hear it , ’
192444	192460	192462	192464	the old man	384	‘ Ah ! so say the gentlefolks who come down here to look about them , ’
192470	192532	192467	192467	his	384	‘ but I say otherwise . “ It ’s a pretty custom you have in this part of the country , ” they say to me sometimes , “ to plant the graves , but it ’s melancholy to see these things all withering or dead . ” I crave their pardon and tell them that , as I take it , ‘

192589	192598	192467	192467	his	384	’ said the child in an earnest voice . ‘
192602	192609	192467	192467	his	384	’ replied the old man doubtfully . ‘

192628	192635	192620	192620	I	0	’ thought the child within herself , ‘
192670	192752	192754	192754	you	0	’ Her glowing cheek and moistened eye passed unnoticed by the sexton , who turned towards old David , and called him by his name . It was plain that Becky Morgan ’s age still troubled him ; though why , the child could scarcely understand . The second or third repetition of his name attracted the old man ’s attention . Pausing from his work , he leant on his spade , and put his hand to his dull ear . ‘
192757	192761	192754	192754	you	0	’ he said . ‘
192769	192774	192776	192776	she	4528	’ replied the sexton , ‘

192803	192815	192776	192776	she	4528	’ answered the old man with a shake of the head , ‘

192829	192834	192820	192820	I	0	’ replied the sexton ; ‘

192859	192874	192841	192841	women	6119	’ said the other old man , with a sudden sparkle in his eye . ‘
192881	192882	192875	192875	She	4528	’ ‘
192884	192909	192841	192841	women	6119	’m sure she must have been . Why , only think how old she looked . You and I seemed but boys to her . ’
192910	192916	192918	192918	David	262	‘ She did look old , ’
192920	192922	192918	192918	David	262	‘ You ’re

192964	192969	192950	192950	she	4528	’ said the sexton . ‘
192978	192983	192999	192999	I	0	’ cried the other . ‘
192986	192991	192999	192999	I	0	’ retorted the sexton . ‘
193038	193120	192999	192999	I	0	’ The other old man was not behindhand with some moral reflections on this fruitful theme , and both adduced a mass of evidence , of such weight as to render it doubtful -- not whether the deceased was of the age suggested , but whether she had not almost reached the patriarchal term of a hundred . When they had settled this question to their mutual satisfaction , the sexton , with his friend ’s assistance , rose to go . ‘
193138	193149	193129	193129	I	0	’ he said , as he prepared to limp away . ‘
193152	193157	193158	193158	He	0	’ asked old David . ‘
193166	193171	193158	193158	He	0	’ cried the sexton . ‘
193176	193177	193158	193158	He	0	’ ‘
193180	193189	193158	193158	He	0	’ said old David , looking after him . ‘
193201	193351	193352	193352	Nell	72	’ And so they parted ; each persuaded that the other had less life in him than himself ; and both greatly consoled and comforted by the little fiction they had agreed upon , respecting Becky Morgan , whose decease was no longer a precedent of uncomfortable application , and would be no business of theirs for half a score of years to come . The child remained , for some minutes , watching the deaf old man as he threw out the earth with his shovel , and , often stopping to cough and fetch his breath , still muttered to himself , with a kind of sober chuckle , that the sexton was wearing fast . At length she turned away , and walking thoughtfully through the churchyard , came unexpectedly upon the schoolmaster , who was sitting on a green grave in the sun , reading . ‘
193355	193366	193352	193352	Nell	72	’ he said cheerfully , as he closed his book . ‘

193423	193428	193380	193380	I	0	’ said the schoolmaster . ‘

193485	193504	193507	193507	God	71	’ Full of grateful tenderness , the child took his hand , and folded it between her own . ‘
193511	193524	193507	193507	God	71	’ she said , when they had been silent for some time . ‘

193593	193598	193584	193584	you	0	’ the child rejoined . ‘
193607	193614	193584	193584	you	0	’ There was a long pause . ‘
193619	193626	193584	193584	you	0	’ said the schoolmaster , tenderly . ‘

193679	193692	193676	193676	you	0	’ said the schoolmaster , marking the glance she had thrown around , ‘

193785	193791	193797	193797	I	0	’ said the child quickly . ‘

193824	193829	193797	193797	I	0	’ cried her friend , ‘

194037	194095	194096	194098	A good man	4549	’ The poor schoolmaster made her no answer , but bent over her in silence ; for his heart was full . They were yet seated in the same place , when the grandfather approached . Before they had spoken many words together , the church clock struck the hour of school , and their friend withdrew . ‘
194100	194109	194110	194112	a kind man	4550	’ said the grandfather , looking after him ; ‘
194141	194150	194151	194151	She	72	’ The child shook her head and smiled . ‘
194155	194165	194151	194151	She	72	’ said the old man , patting her cheek ; ‘
194180	194181	194177	194177	she	72	’ ‘
194184	194189	194177	194177	she	72	’ asked the child . ‘
194192	194198	194177	194177	she	72	’ said the old man , ‘
194224	194228	194275	194277	the old man	384	’re better gone . ’
194229	194235	194237	194238	the child	324	‘ Much better , dear , ’
194240	194269	194237	194238	the child	324	‘ We will forget them ; or , if we ever call them to mind , it shall be only as some uneasy dream that has passed away . ’
194270	194273	194275	194277	the old man	384	‘ Hush ! ’
194292	194313	194275	194277	the old man	384	‘ no more talk of the dream , and all the miseries it brought . There are no dreams here . ‘
194374	194375	194415	194415	you	324	’ ‘
194379	194385	194415	194415	you	324	’ inwardly exclaimed the child , ‘

194399	194405	194415	194415	you	324	’ said the old man , ‘
194452	194453	194450	194450	Nell	72	’ ‘
194462	194471	194450	194450	Nell	72	’ replied the child , with assumed gaiety , ‘
194519	194520	194535	194535	darling	6986	’ ‘
194527	194532	194535	194535	darling	6986	’ cried her grandfather . ‘
194543	194648	194537	194537	we	4556	’ Who so delighted as the old man , when they next day began their labour ! Who so unconscious of all associations connected with the spot , as he ! They plucked the long grass and nettles from the tombs , thinned the poor shrubs and roots , made the turf smooth , and cleared it of the leaves and weeds . They were yet in the ardour of their work , when the child , raising her head from the ground over which she bent , observed that the bachelor was sitting on the stile close by , watching them in silence . ‘
194653	194668	194537	194537	we	4556	’ said the little gentleman , nodding to Nell as she curtseyed to him . ‘
194678	194679	194670	194670	you	4562	’ ‘
194687	194696	194670	194670	you	4562	’ returned the child , with downcast eyes , ‘
194704	194705	194670	194670	you	4562	’ ‘
194712	194717	194670	194670	you	4562	’ said the bachelor . ‘
194733	194734	194720	194720	you	4562	’ ‘
194747	196228	194735	194735	We	4564	’ replied Nell , turning her head aside , and speaking softly . It was a slight incident , and might have been design or accident , or the child ’s unconscious sympathy with youth . But it seemed to strike upon her grandfather , though he had not noticed it before . He looked in a hurried manner at the graves , then anxiously at the child , then pressed her to his side , and bade her stop to rest . Something he had long forgotten , appeared to struggle faintly in his mind . It did not pass away , as weightier things had done ; but came uppermost again , and yet again , and many times that day , and often afterwards . Once , while they were yet at work , the child , seeing that he often turned and looked uneasily at her , as though he were trying to resolve some painful doubts or collect some scattered thoughts , urged him to tell the reason . But he said it was nothing -- nothing -- and , laying her head upon his arm , patted her fair cheek with his hand , and muttered that she grew stronger every day , and would be a woman , soon . CHAPTER 55 From that time , there sprung up in the old man ’s mind , a solicitude about the child which never slept or left him . There are chords in the human heart -- strange , varying strings -- which are only struck by accident ; which will remain mute and senseless to appeals the most passionate and earnest , and respond at last to the slightest casual touch . In the most insensible or childish minds , there is some train of reflection which art can seldom lead , or skill assist , but which will reveal itself , as great truths have done , by chance , and when the discoverer has the plainest end in view . From that time , the old man never , for a moment , forgot the weakness and devotion of the child ; from the time of that slight incident , he who had seen her toiling by his side through so much difficulty and suffering , and had scarcely thought of her otherwise than as the partner of miseries which he felt severely in his own person , and deplored for his own sake at least as much as hers , awoke to a sense of what he owed her , and what those miseries had made her . Never , no , never once , in one unguarded moment from that time to the end , did any care for himself , any thought of his own comfort , any selfish consideration or regard distract his thoughts from the gentle object of his love . He would follow her up and down , waiting till she should tire and lean upon his arm -- he would sit opposite to her in the chimney - corner , content to watch , and look , until she raised her head and smiled upon him as of old -- he would discharge by stealth , those household duties which tasked her powers too heavily -- he would rise , in the cold dark nights , to listen to her breathing in her sleep , and sometimes crouch for hours by her bedside only to touch her hand . He who knows all , can only know what hopes , and fears , and thoughts of deep affection , were in that one disordered brain , and what a change had fallen on the poor old man . Sometimes -- weeks had crept on , then -- the child , exhausted , though with little fatigue , would pass whole evenings on a couch beside the fire . At such times , the schoolmaster would bring in books , and read to her aloud ; and seldom an evening passed , but the bachelor came in , and took his turn of reading . The old man sat and listened -- with little understanding for the words , but with his eyes fixed upon the child -- and if she smiled or brightened with the story , he would say it was a good one , and conceive a fondness for the very book . When , in their evening talk , the bachelor told some tale that pleased her ( as his tales were sure to do ) , the old man would painfully try to store it in his mind ; nay , when the bachelor left them , he would sometimes slip out after him , and humbly beg that he would tell him such a part again , that he might learn to win a smile from Nell . But these were rare occasions , happily ; for the child yearned to be out of doors , and walking in her solemn garden . Parties , too , would come to see the church ; and those who came , speaking to others of the child , sent more ; so even at that season of the year they had visitors almost daily . The old man would follow them at a little distance through the building , listening to the voice he loved so well ; and when the strangers left , and parted from Nell , he would mingle with them to catch up fragments of their conversation ; or he would stand for the same purpose , with his grey head uncovered , at the gate as they passed through . They always praised the child , her sense and beauty , and he was proud to hear them ! But what was that , so often added , which wrung his heart , and made him sob and weep alone , in some dull corner ! Alas ! even careless strangers -- they who had no feeling for her , but the interest of the moment -- they who would go away and forget next week that such a being lived -- even they saw it -- even they pitied her -- even they bade him good day compassionately , and whispered as they passed . The people of the village , too , of whom there was not one but grew to have a fondness for poor Nell ; even among them , there was the same feeling ; a tenderness towards her -- a compassionate regard for her , increasing every day . The very schoolboys , light - hearted and thoughtless as they were , even they cared for her . The roughest among them was sorry if he missed her in the usual place upon his way to school , and would turn out of the path to ask for her at the latticed window . If she were sitting in the church , they perhaps might peep in softly at the open door ; but they never spoke to her , unless she rose and went to speak to them . Some feeling was abroad which raised the child above them all . So , when Sunday came . They were all poor country people in the church , for the castle in which the old family had lived , was an empty ruin , and there were none but humble folks for seven miles around . There , as elsewhere , they had an interest in Nell . They would gather round her in the porch , before and after service ; young children would cluster at her skirts ; and aged men and women forsake their gossips , to give her kindly greeting . None of them , young or old , thought of passing the child without a friendly word . Many who came from three or four miles distant , brought her little presents ; the humblest and rudest had good wishes to bestow . She had sought out the young children whom she first saw playing in the churchyard . One of these -- he who had spoken of his brother -- was her little favourite and friend , and often sat by her side in the church , or climbed with her to the tower - top . It was his delight to help her , or to fancy that he did so , and they soon became close companions . It happened , that , as she was reading in the old spot by herself one day , this child came running in with his eyes full of tears , and after holding her from him , and looking at her eagerly for a moment , clasped his little arms passionately about her neck . ‘
196232	196239	194735	194735	We	4564	’ said Nell , soothing him . ‘

196253	196264	194735	194735	We	4564	’ cried the boy , embracing her still more closely . ‘
196272	196297	194735	194735	We	4564	’ She looked at him wonderingly , and putting his hair back from his face , and kissing him , asked what he meant . ‘
196307	196312	196304	196305	dear Nell	72	’ cried the boy . ‘

196350	196355	196344	196344	I	0	’ said the child . ‘

196369	196419	196366	196366	they	4571	’ replied the boy , looking up into her face , that you will be an Angel , before the birds sing again . But you wo n’t be , will you ? Do n’t leave us Nell , though the sky is bright . Do not leave us ! ’
196434	196442	196444	196445	the boy	423	‘ She can not bear the thought ! ’
196452	196490	196491	196493	The little creature	348	‘ You will not go . You know how sorry we should be . Dear Nell , tell me that you ’ll stay amongst us . Oh ! Pray , pray , tell me that you will . ’
196505	196513	196515	196516	the boy	423	‘ Only look at me , Nell , ’
196518	196551	196515	196516	the boy	423	‘ and tell me that you ’ll stop , and then I shall know that they are wrong , and will cry no more . Wo n’t you say yes , Nell ? ’
196571	196576	196578	196579	the boy	423	‘ After a time , ’
196588	196650	196578	196579	the boy	423	‘ the kind angels will be glad to think that you are not among them , and that you stayed here to be with us . Willy went away , to join them ; but if he had known how I should miss him in our little bed at night , he never would have left me , I am sure . ’
196669	196716	196718	196718	he	423	‘ Why would you go , dear Nell ? I know you would not be happy when you heard that we were crying for your loss . They say that Willy is in Heaven now , and that it ’s always summer there , and yet I ’m
196746	196761	196771	196771	him	423	’ said the boy , caressing her , and pressing his face to hers , ‘
196820	197092	196816	196816	I	0	’ The child suffered him to move her hands , and put them round his neck . There was a tearful silence , but it was not long before she looked upon him with a smile , and promised him , in a very gentle , quiet voice , that she would stay , and be his friend , as long as Heaven would let her . He clapped his hands for joy , and thanked her many times ; and being charged to tell no person what had passed between them , gave her an earnest promise that he never would . Nor did he , so far as the child could learn ; but was her quiet companion in all her walks and musings , and never again adverted to the theme , which he felt had given her pain , although he was unconscious of its cause . Something of distrust lingered about him still ; for he would often come , even in the dark evenings , and call in a timid voice outside the door to know if she were safe within ; and being answered yes , and bade to enter , would take his station on a low stool at her feet , and sit there patiently until they came to seek , and take him home . Sure as the morning came , it found him lingering near the house to ask if she were well ; and , morning , noon , or night , go where she would , he would forsake his playmates and his sports to bear her company . ‘
197103	197112	197098	197098	he	4580	’ said the old sexton to her once . ‘
197143	197168	197135	197136	this one	4583	’ The child thought of what the schoolmaster had told her , and felt how its truth was shadowed out even in this infant . ‘

197464	197476	197477	197477	We	4593	’ The child still stood , looking thoughtfully into the vault . ‘

197527	197547	197509	197509	They	4595	’ thought the child , as she leaned at her casement window , and gazed at the declining sun . ‘
197556	197696	197509	197509	They	4595	’ CHAPTER 56 A day or two after the Quilp tea - party at the Wilderness , Mr Swiveller walked into Sampson Brass ’s office at the usual hour , and being alone in that Temple of Probity , placed his hat upon the desk , and taking from his pocket a small parcel of black crape , applied himself to folding and pinning the same upon it , after the manner of a hatband . Having completed the construction of this appendage , he surveyed his work with great complacency , and put his hat on again -- very much over one eye , to increase the mournfulness of the effect . These arrangements perfected to his entire satisfaction , he thrust his hands into his pockets , and walked up and down the office with measured steps . ‘
197706	197711	197509	197509	They	4595	’ said Mr Swiveller , ‘

Opening the door with all speed , he beheld the expressive countenance of Mr Chuckster , between whom and himself a fraternal greeting ensued . ‘

198212	198219	198221	198221	Dick	77	‘ Wo n’t you come in ? ’
198223	198231	198221	198221	Dick	77	‘ All alone . Swiveller solus . “ ‘

Such morsels of enthusiasm are common among the Glorious Apollos , and were indeed the links that bound them together , and raised them above the cold dull earth . ‘
198330	198339	198326	198326	you	4600	’ said Mr Chuckster , taking a stool . ‘
198388	198446	198326	198326	you	4600	’ Mr Swiveller expressed his acknowledgments ; and it appearing on further conversation that he was in good health , and that Mr Chuckster was in the like enviable condition , both gentlemen , in compliance with a solemn custom of the ancient Brotherhood to which they belonged , joined in a fragment of the popular duet of ‘
198451	198460	198326	198326	you	4600	’ with a long shake at the end . ‘
198467	198471	198326	198326	you	4600	’ said Richard . ‘

198553	198581	198582	198583	that man	2461	’ returned Mr Chuckster , taking out an oblong snuff - box , the lid whereof was ornamented with a fox ’s head curiously carved in brass , ‘
198656	198660	198654	198654	sir	5863	’ said Mr Chuckster-- ‘

198701	198791	198792	198793	Mr Chuckster	139	’m not meek . My worst enemies -- every man has his enemies , Sir , and I have mine -- never accused me of being meek . And I tell you what , Sir , if I had n’t more of these qualities that commonly endear man to man , than our articled clerk has , I ’d steal a Cheshire cheese , tie it round my neck , and drown myself . I ’d die degraded , as I had lived . I would upon my honour . ’
198848	198854	198856	198857	Mr Chuckster	139	‘ Not contented , Sir , ’
198859	198956	198958	198959	Mr Chuckster	139	‘ with making friends with Abel , he has cultivated the acquaintance of his father and mother . Since he came home from that wild - goose chase , he has been there-- actually been there . He patronises young Snobby besides ; you ’ll find , Sir , that he ’ll be constantly coming backwards and forwards to this place : yet I do n’t suppose that beyond the common forms of civility , he has ever exchanged half - a - dozen words with me . Now , upon my soul , you know , ’
198984	199031	198962	198962	his	139	‘ this is altogether such a low - minded affair , that if I did n’t feel for the governor , and know that he could never get on without me , I should be obliged to cut the connection . I should have no alternative . ’

199075	199138	199032	199033	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ you ’ll find he ’ll turn out bad . In our profession we know something of human nature , and take my word for it , that the feller that came back to work out that shilling , will show himself one of these days in his true colours . He ’s a low thief , sir . He must be . ’
199245	199249	199243	199243	he	78	‘ Come in ! ’

199540	199553	199538	199538	Dick	77	‘ Because if he is , I have a letter for him . ’

199645	199810	199633	199633	I	0	’ The excessive audacity of this retort so overpowered Mr Chuckster , and so moved his tender regard for his friend ’s honour , that he declared , if he were not restrained by official considerations , he must certainly have annihilated Kit upon the spot ; a resentment of the affront which he did consider , under the extraordinary circumstances of aggravation attending it , could but have met with the proper sanction and approval of a jury of Englishmen , who , he had no doubt , would have returned a verdict of justifiable Homicide , coupled with a high testimony to the morals and character of the Avenger . Mr Swiveller , without being quite so hot upon the matter , was rather shamed by his friend ’s excitement , and not a little puzzled how to act ( Kit being quite cool and good - humoured ) , when the single gentleman was heard to call violently down the stairs . ‘

201417	201424	201426	201427	Mr Brass	127	‘ On that occasion , Kit , ’
201429	201484	201426	201427	Mr Brass	127	‘ on that occasion that I have just alluded to , I had a hard battle with Mr Quilp ( for Mr Quilp is a very hard man ) to obtain them the indulgence they had . It might have cost me a client . But suffering virtue inspired me , and I prevailed . ’
201485	201494	201496	201497	honest Kit	75	‘ He ’s not so bad after all , ’
201519	201526	201528	201528	Brass	127	‘ I respect you , Kit , ’
201532	201617	201528	201528	Brass	127	‘ I saw enough of your conduct , at that time , to respect you , though your station is humble , and your fortune lowly . It is n’t the waistcoat that I look at . It is the heart . The checks in the waistcoat are but the wires of the cage . But the heart is the bird . Ah ! How many sich birds are perpetually moulting , and putting their beaks through the wires to peck at all mankind ! ’
201700	201705	201707	201707	Sampson	127	‘ Well , well , ’
201728	201739	201707	201707	Sampson	127	‘ this is wide of the bull’s - eye . You ’re
201748	201780	201782	201782	yourself	75	’ As he spoke , he pointed to a couple of half - crowns on the desk . Kit looked at the coins , and then at Sampson , and hesitated . ‘

201837	201883	201833	201833	you	75	’re to take them , that ’s all ; and between you and me , I do n’t think they ’ll be the last you ’ll have to take from the same place . I hope not . Good bye , Kit . Good bye ! ’
201955	201961	201963	201964	Miss Sally	125	‘ May I come in ? ’
201968	201977	201979	201980	her brother	521	‘ Oh yes , you may come in , ’
201982	201985	201987	201988	Miss Brass	125	‘ Ahem ! ’
201991	201996	201998	201998	Sampson	127	‘ Why , yes , ’
202000	202009	201998	201998	Sampson	127	‘ I should say as good as done . ’
202290	202294	202295	202295	he	127	‘ Ha ha ! ’
202299	202321	202295	202295	he	127	‘ Here ’s the pony again ! Most remarkable pony , extremely docile , eh , Mr Richard , eh sir ? ’
202371	202377	202378	202378	he	127	‘ The old gentleman again ! ’
202382	202463	202378	202378	he	127	‘ a very prepossessing old gentleman , Mr Richard -- charming countenance , sir -- extremely calm -- benevolence in every feature , sir . He quite realises my idea of King Lear , as he appeared when in possession of his kingdom , Mr Richard -- the same good humour , the same white hair and partial baldness , the same liability to be imposed upon . Ah ! A sweet subject for contemplation , sir , very sweet ! ’
202507	202541	202542	202542	Kit	75	‘ Admirably groomed , Kit’--Mr Brass is patting the pony--‘does you great credit -- amazingly sleek and bright to be sure . He literally looks as if he had been varnished all over . ’

202571	202577	202579	202579	Brass	127	‘ A beautiful animal indeed ! ’
202581	202585	202579	202579	Brass	127	‘ Sagacious too ? ’
202586	202590	202592	202592	Kit	75	‘ Bless you ! ’
202594	202609	202592	202592	Kit	75	‘ he knows what you say to him as well as a Christian does . ’
202610	202615	202617	202617	Brass	127	‘ Does he indeed ! ’
202648	202652	202617	202617	Brass	127	‘ Dear me ! ’
202653	202666	202668	202668	Kit	75	‘ I little thought the first time I saw him , Sir , ’
202681	202697	202668	202668	Kit	75	‘ that I should come to be as intimate with him as I am now . ’
202698	202701	202703	202704	Mr Brass	127	‘ Ah ! ’
202717	202773	202774	202775	Mr Brass	127	‘ A charming subject of reflection for you , very charming . A subject of proper pride and congratulation , Christopher . Honesty is the best policy.--I always find it so myself . I lost forty - seven pound ten by being honest this morning . But it ’s all gain , it ’s gain ! ’
202817	202821	202823	202823	Sampson	127	‘ A man , ’
202825	202883	202885	202885	Brass	127	‘ who loses forty - seven pound ten in one morning by his honesty , is a man to be envied . If it had been eighty pound , the luxuriousness of feeling would have been increased . Every pound lost , would have been a hundredweight of happiness gained . The still small voice , Christopher , ’
202896	202913	202885	202885	Brass	127	‘ is a - singing comic songs within me , and all is happiness and joy ! ’
203619	203637	203639	203641	the small servant	2874	‘ Oh ! I did n’t mean any harm indeed , upon my word I did n’t , ’
203650	203673	203639	203641	the small servant	2874	‘ It ’s so very dull , down - stairs , Please do n’t you tell upon me , please do n’t . ’
203674	203679	203681	203681	Dick	77	‘ Tell upon you ! ’
203683	203698	203681	203681	Dick	77	‘ Do you mean to say you were looking through the keyhole for company ? ’
203699	203708	203710	203712	the small servant	2874	‘ Yes , upon my word I was , ’
203714	203725	203727	203727	Dick	77	‘ How long have you been cooling your eye there ? ’
203729	203745	203727	203727	Dick	77	‘ Oh ever since you first began to play them cards , and long before . ’
203800	203812	203786	203786	he	77	‘ Well -- come in’--he said , after a little consideration . ‘
203827	203828	203819	203819	I	0	’ ‘
203836	203842	203831	203831	I	0	’ rejoined the small servant ; ‘
203845	203858	203831	203831	I	0	‘ ud kill me , if she know’d I come up here . ’
203859	203869	203871	203871	Dick	77	‘ Have you got a fire down - stairs ? ’
203873	203879	203881	203883	the small servant	2874	‘ A very little one , ’
203885	203905	203907	203907	Richard	78	‘ Miss Sally could n’t kill me if she know’d I went down there , so I ’ll come , ’
203916	203931	203907	203907	Richard	78	‘ Why , how thin you are ! What do you mean by it ? ’
203932	203939	203985	203987	the small servant	2874	‘ It ai n’t my fault . ’
203940	203949	203951	203951	Dick	77	‘ Could you eat any bread and meat ? ’
203958	203973	203951	203951	Dick	77	‘ Yes ? Ah ! I thought so . Did you ever taste beer ? ’
203974	203983	203985	203987	the small servant	2874	‘ I had a sip of it once , ’
203989	203997	203999	204000	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ Here ’s a state of things ! ’
204009	204031	203999	204000	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ She never tasted it -- it ca n’t be tasted in a sip ! Why , how old are you ? ’
204032	204038	204039	204040	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ I do n’t know . ’
204186	204189	204191	204191	Richard	78	‘ There ! ’
204199	204216	204191	204191	Richard	78	‘ First of all clear that off , and then you ’ll see what ’s next . ’
204232	204235	204237	204237	Dick	77	‘ Next , ’
204243	204260	204237	204237	Dick	77	‘ take a pull at that ; but moderate your transports , you know , for you ’re
204272	204273	204178	204179	Mr Swiveller	78	’ ‘
204280	204342	204178	204179	Mr Swiveller	78	’ said the small servant . Mr Swiveller appeared gratified beyond all expression by this reply , and took a long draught himself , steadfastly regarding his companion while he did so . These preliminaries disposed of , he applied himself to teaching her the game , which she soon learnt tolerably well , being both sharp - witted and cunning . ‘
204345	204372	204178	204179	Mr Swiveller	78	’ said Mr Swiveller , putting two sixpences into a saucer , and trimming the wretched candle , when the cards had been cut and dealt , ‘
204384	204394	204426	204426	Marchioness	270	‘ em all . If I win , I get ‘
204417	204423	204414	204414	you	4742	’ The small servant nodded . ‘
204428	204433	204414	204414	you	4742	’ said Mr Swiveller , ‘
204437	204544	204414	204414	you	4742	’ The Marchioness , holding her cards very tight in both hands , considered which to play , and Mr Swiveller , assuming the gay and fashionable air which such society required , took another pull at the tankard , and waited for her lead . CHAPTER 58 Mr Swiveller and his partner played several rubbers with varying success , until the loss of three sixpences , the gradual sinking of the purl , and the striking of ten o’clock , combined to render that gentleman mindful of the flight of Time , and the expediency of withdrawing before Mr Sampson and Miss Sally Brass returned . ‘
204553	204559	204551	204551	Marchioness	270	’ said Mr Swiveller gravely , ‘
204670	204716	204717	204720	The Baron Sampsono Brasso	271	’ As a precaution against this latter inconvenience , Mr Swiveller had been sitting for some time with his feet on the hob , in which attitude he now gave utterance to these apologetic observations , and slowly sipped the last choice drops of nectar . ‘
204735	204769	204727	204727	you	270	’ said Mr Swiveller , leaning his left arm heavily upon the table , and raising his voice and his right leg after the manner of a theatrical bandit . The Marchioness nodded . ‘
204772	204782	204727	204727	you	270	’ said Mr Swiveller , with a portentous frown . ‘
204783	204797	204798	204798	He	0	’ Tis well . Marchioness!--but no matter . Some wine there . Ho ! ’
204916	204924	204913	204913	he	78	‘ Do they often go where glory waits ‘
204932	204933	204913	204913	he	78	’ ‘
204944	204950	204940	204940	you	78	’ returned the small servant . ‘
204965	204966	204962	204962	she	125	’ ‘
204971	204975	204962	204962	she	125	’ said Dick . ‘
204982	205046	204976	204980	Such a one - er	4753	’ returned the Marchioness . After a moment ’s reflection , Mr Swiveller determined to forego his responsible duty of setting her right , and to suffer her to talk on ; as it was evident that her tongue was loosened by the purl , and her opportunities for conversation were not so frequent as to render a momentary check of little consequence . ‘
205055	205065	205066	205066	they	4751	’ said the small servant with a shrewd look ; ‘
205076	205077	205066	205066	they	4751	’ ‘
205084	205088	205079	205080	Mr Brass	127	’ said Dick . ‘
205100	205110	205096	205096	he	127	’ replied the small servant , shaking her head . ‘
205122	205123	205132	205132	he	127	’ ‘
205134	205138	205132	205132	he	127	’ said Dick . ‘
205147	205153	205139	205140	Miss Sally	125	’ said the small servant ; ‘
205182	205183	205184	205184	I	0	’ ‘
205187	205191	205184	205184	I	0	’ said Dick , ‘
205220	205226	205218	205218	Marchioness	270	’ The Marchioness nodded amazingly . ‘
205229	205272	205218	205218	Marchioness	270	’ said Mr Swiveller . The Marchioness changed the motion of her head , which had not yet left off nodding , and suddenly began to shake it from side to side , with a vehemence which threatened to dislocate her neck . ‘
205275	205279	205218	205218	Marchioness	270	’ Dick muttered . ‘
205306	205307	205293	205293	they	4754	’ ‘
205312	205317	205319	205320	his friend	5985	’re a funny chap , ’
205322	205327	205329	205330	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ Well , Marchioness , ’
205332	205373	205329	205330	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ that ’s not uncomplimentary . Merriment , Marchioness , is not a bad or a degrading quality . Old King Cole was himself a merry old soul , if we may put any faith in the pages of history . ’
205374	205379	205381	205382	his companion	6044	‘ But she says , ’
205384	205392	205381	205382	his companion	6044	‘ that you an’t to be trusted . ’
205393	205399	205401	205402	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ Why , really Marchioness , ’
205406	205519	205401	205402	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ several ladies and gentlemen -- not exactly professional persons , but tradespeople , ma’am , tradespeople -- have made the same remark . The obscure citizen who keeps the hotel over the way , inclined strongly to that opinion to - night when I ordered him to prepare the banquet . It ’s a popular prejudice , Marchioness ; and yet I am sure I do n’t know why , for I have been trusted in my time to a considerable amount , and I can safely say that I never forsook my trust until it deserted me -- never . Mr Brass is of the same opinion , I suppose ? ’
205555	205573	205550	205550	herself	883	‘ But do n’t you ever tell upon me , or I shall be beat to death . ’
205574	205577	205579	205580	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ Marchioness , ’
205584	205642	205644	205644	Richard	78	‘ the word of a gentleman is as good as his bond -- sometimes better , as in the present case , where his bond might prove but a doubtful sort of security . I am your friend , and I hope we shall play many more rubbers together in this same saloon . But , Marchioness , ’
205670	205695	205659	205668	the small servant , who was following with the candle	4762	‘ it occurs to me that you must be in the constant habit of airing your eye at keyholes , to know all this . ’
205696	205701	205703	205705	the trembling Marchioness	270	‘ I only wanted , ’
205707	205744	205703	205705	the trembling Marchioness	270	‘ to know where the key of the safe was hid ; that was all ; and I would n’t have taken much , if I had found it -- only enough to squench my hunger . ’
205745	205753	205755	205755	Dick	77	‘ You did n’t find it then ? ’
205757	205805	205755	205755	Dick	77	‘ But of course you did n’t , or you ’d be plumper . Good night , Marchioness . Fare thee well , and if for ever , then for ever fare thee well -- and put up the chain , Marchioness , in case of accidents . ’
205921	205925	205927	205928	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ This Marchioness , ’
205934	206007	205927	205928	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ is a very extraordinary person -- surrounded by mysteries , ignorant of the taste of beer , unacquainted with her own name ( which is less remarkable ) , and taking a limited view of society through the keyholes of doors -- can these things be her destiny , or has some unknown person started an opposition to the decrees of fate ? It is a most inscrutable and unmitigated staggerer ! ’
206051	206055	206057	206058	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ These rubbers , ’
206075	206099	206062	206062	his	78	‘ remind me of the matrimonial fireside . Cheggs ’s wife plays cribbage ; all - fours likewise . She rings the changes on ‘
206143	206173	206139	206139	I	0	’ added Richard , getting his left cheek into profile , and looking complacently at the reflection of a very little scrap of whisker in the looking - glass ; ‘
206195	206399	206178	206178	I	0	’ Melting from this stern and obdurate , into the tender and pathetic mood , Mr Swiveller groaned a little , walked wildly up and down , and even made a show of tearing his hair , which , however , he thought better of , and wrenched the tassel from his nightcap instead . At last , undressing himself with a gloomy resolution , he got into bed . Some men in his blighted position would have taken to drinking ; but as Mr Swiveller had taken to that before , he only took , on receiving the news that Sophy Wackles was lost to him for ever , to playing the flute ; thinking after mature consideration that it was a good , sound , dismal occupation , not only in unison with his own sad thoughts , but calculated to awaken a fellow - feeling in the bosoms of his neighbours . In pursuance of this resolution , he now drew a little table to his bedside , and arranging the light and a small oblong music - book to the best advantage , took his flute from its box , and began to play most mournfully . The air was ‘
206761	206771	206753	206753	he	78	‘ I say’--quoth Miss Brass , abruptly breaking silence , ‘
206787	206788	206785	206785	you	78	’ ‘
206798	206803	206804	206804	I	0	’ rejoined Mr Swiveller . ‘
206849	206850	206840	206840	I	0	’ ‘
206857	206862	206855	206855	you	0	’ returned Miss Brass . ‘
206868	206869	206865	206865	you	0	’ ‘
206885	206890	206874	206874	you	78	’ said Mr Swiveller . ‘
206898	206899	206874	206874	you	78	’ ‘
206907	206912	206903	206903	I	0	’ replied Miss Sally , ‘
206938	206939	206931	206931	I	0	’ ‘
206942	206946	206940	206940	Halloa	95	’ thought Richard , ‘
206958	206959	206949	206950	the Marchioness	10377	’ ‘
206966	206971	206949	206950	the Marchioness	10377	’ said Miss Sally , ‘
207004	207052	207002	207002	you	78	’ Mr Swiveller involuntarily clapped his hands to the jacket to be quite sure that it WAS a jacket and not a skirted coat ; and having satisfied himself of the safety of this , his only moveable in Bevis Marks , made answer in the negative . ‘
207062	207081	207060	207060	Dick	77	’ said Miss Brass , pulling out the tin box and refreshing herself with a pinch of snuff ; ‘
207145	207146	207147	207147	You	78	’ ‘
207153	207157	207147	207147	You	78	’ cried Dick . ‘
207184	207185	207175	207175	you	77	’ ‘
207200	207206	207209	207209	Jove	216	’ rejoined Miss Brass emphatically . ‘
207211	207220	207209	207209	Jove	216	’ thought Richard , laying down his pen , ‘
207230	207405	207224	207225	the Marchioness	10377	’ The more he discussed the subject in his thoughts , the more probable it appeared to Dick that the miserable little servant was the culprit . When he considered on what a spare allowance of food she lived , how neglected and untaught she was , and how her natural cunning had been sharpened by necessity and privation , he scarcely doubted it . And yet he pitied her so much , and felt so unwilling to have a matter of such gravity disturbing the oddity of their acquaintance , that he thought , and thought truly , that rather than receive fifty pounds down , he would have the Marchioness proved innocent . While he was plunged in very profound and serious meditation upon this theme , Miss Sally sat shaking her head with an air of great mystery and doubt ; when the voice of her brother Sampson , carolling a cheerful strain , was heard in the passage , and that gentleman himself , beaming with virtuous smiles , appeared . ‘
207498	207571	207572	207572	You	5863	’ While he addressed his clerk in these words , Mr Brass was , somewhat ostentatiously , engaged in minutely examining and holding up against the light a five - pound bank note , which he had brought in , in his hand . Mr Richard not receiving his remarks with anything like enthusiasm , his employer turned his eyes to his face , and observed that it wore a troubled expression . ‘
207573	207580	207582	207582	Brass	127	’re out of spirits , sir , ’
207584	207614	207582	207582	Brass	127	‘ Mr Richard , sir , we should fall to work cheerfully , and not in a despondent state . It becomes us , Mr Richard , sir , to-- ’
207624	207628	207630	207631	Mr Sampson	127	‘ Dear me ! ’
207633	207646	207630	207631	Mr Sampson	127	‘ you too ! Is anything the matter ? Mr Richard , sir-- ’
207776	207857	207748	207748	he	77	‘ This is a most extraordinary and painful circumstance -- Mr Richard , sir , a most painful circumstance . The fact is , that I myself have missed several small sums from the desk , of late , and have refrained from mentioning it , hoping that accident would discover the offender ; but it has not done so -- it has not done so . Sally -- Mr Richard , sir -- this is a particularly distressing affair ! ’
207902	207910	207888	207889	Richard Swiveller	78	‘ No , Mr Richard , sir , ’
207916	207985	207888	207889	Richard Swiveller	78	‘ I will not take it up . I will let it lie there , sir . To take it up , Mr Richard , sir , would imply a doubt of you ; and in you , sir , I have unlimited confidence . We will let it lie there , Sir , if you please , and we will not take it up by any means . ’
208157	208182	208150	208150	her	125	‘ I ’ve hit it!’--as indeed she had , and chipped a piece out of it too ; but that was not her meaning . ‘
208185	208190	208150	208150	her	125	’ cried Brass anxiously . ‘
208197	208198	208150	208150	her	125	’ ‘
208201	208211	208150	208150	her	125	’ replied his sister with an air of triumph , ‘

208268	208272	208266	208266	somebody	6663	’ blustered Brass . ‘

208353	208357	208359	208360	Miss Brass	125	‘ I say , ’
208368	208375	208359	208360	Miss Brass	125	‘ that he ’s the thief . ’
208376	208380	208382	208382	Sampson	127	‘ I say , ’
208385	208439	208382	208382	Sampson	127	‘ that he is not . What do you mean ? How dare you ? Are characters to be whispered away like this ? Do you know that he ’s the honestest and faithfullest fellow that ever lived , and that he has an irreproachable good name ? Come in , come in ! ’
208502	208516	208498	208498	himself	75	‘ Is the gentleman up - stairs , sir , if you please ? ’
208517	208522	208524	208524	Brass	127	‘ Yes , Kit , ’
208542	208582	208584	208584	Brass	127	‘ Yes Kit , he is . I am glad to see you Kit , I am rejoiced to see you . Look in again , as you come down - stairs , Kit . That lad a robber ! ’
208590	208645	208647	208647	Sampson	127	‘ with that frank and open countenance ! I ’d trust him with untold gold . Mr Richard , sir , have the goodness to step directly to Wrasp and Co. ’s in Broad Street , and inquire if they have had instructions to appear in Carkem and Painter . THAT lad a robber , ’
208656	208685	208647	208647	Sampson	127	‘ Am I blind , deaf , silly ; do I know nothing of human nature when I see it before me ? Kit a robber ! Bah ! ’
208817	208825	208827	208827	Kit	75	‘ Is anything the matter , sir ? ’
208829	208832	208834	208834	Brass	127	‘ Matter ! ’
208836	208844	208834	208834	Brass	127	‘ No . Why anything the matter ? ’
208845	208852	208854	208854	Kit	75	‘ You are so very pale , ’
208856	208865	208854	208854	Kit	75	‘ that I should hardly have known you . ’
208866	208873	208875	208875	Brass	127	‘ Pooh pooh ! mere fancy , ’
208884	208913	208875	208875	Brass	127	‘ Never better , Kit , never better in all my life . Merry too . Ha ha ! How ’s our friend above - stairs , eh ? ’
208914	208920	208922	208922	Kit	75	‘ A great deal better , ’
208924	208926	208922	208922	Kit	75	‘ I ’m
208932	208936	208922	208922	Kit	75	’ rejoined Brass ; ‘
208992	209037	208989	208990	Ha ha	4661	’ Kit gave a satisfactory account of all the little household at Abel Cottage . Mr Brass , who seemed remarkably inattentive and impatient , mounted on his stool , and beckoning him to come nearer , took him by the button - hole . ‘
209045	209050	209038	209038	I	0	’ said the lawyer , ‘

209122	209126	209116	209116	Sir	5863	’ cried Brass . ‘

209185	209211	209212	209212	I	0	’ said Brass , taking it from him and making some confusion among the papers , in finding a place for it on the desk . ‘
209242	209254	209239	209239	you	75	’re obliged to put people into those houses to take care of ‘
209395	209422	209371	209371	you	75	’ As Brass spoke , he moved the hat twice or thrice , and shuffled among the papers again , as if in search of something . ‘
209437	209445	209446	209446	I	0	’ replied Kit with his whole heart . ‘
209461	209462	209456	209456	I	0	’ ‘
209466	209506	209456	209456	I	0	’ said Brass , suddenly turning upon him and thrusting his face close to Kit ’s with such a repulsive smile that the latter , even in the very height of his gratitude , drew back , quite startled . ‘
209514	209523	209526	209526	I	0	’ Kit looked at him in some confusion . ‘
209529	209546	209526	209526	I	0	’ added Sampson , rubbing his hands and veiling himself again in his usual oily manner . ‘
209566	209570	209564	209564	me	0	’ said Brass , ‘
209620	209678	209618	209618	Kit	75	’ Talking as he went , Mr Brass bustled out of the office , and in a very short time returned . Mr Swiveller came back , almost at the same instant ; and as Kit was leaving the room hastily , to make up for lost time , Miss Brass herself encountered him in the doorway . ‘
209681	209692	209618	209618	Kit	75	’ sneered Sally , looking after him as she entered . ‘
209702	209703	209698	209698	Sammy	127	’ ‘
209710	209714	209707	209707	he	4843	’ replied Brass . ‘

209740	209745	209738	209738	Hem	119	’ coughed Miss Brass . ‘
209754	209760	209746	209746	I	0	’ said the angry Sampson , ‘
209823	209853	209854	209854	She	4851	’ Miss Sally pulled out the tin snuff - box , and took a long , slow pinch , regarding her brother with a steady gaze all the time . ‘
209864	209868	209869	209869	she	4851	’ said Brass , ‘
209909	209910	209902	209902	she	4851	’ ‘
209919	209923	209914	209914	you	0	’ said Dick . ‘
209931	209935	209925	209925	she	4851	’ retorted Brass ; ‘
209974	209978	209952	209952	she	4851	’ said Brass , ‘
210012	210039	210040	210040	He	426	’ The beautiful virgin took another pinch , and put the snuff - box in her pocket ; still looking at her brother with perfect composure . ‘
210047	210052	210053	210053	he	426	’ said Brass triumphantly ; ‘
210074	210075	210067	210067	he	426	’ ‘
210081	210086	210088	210088	me	0	’ inquired Mr Swiveller . ‘
210090	210124	210128	210129	Mr Richard	78	’ said Brass , slapping all his pockets , one after another , and looking into his desk , and under it , and upon it , and wildly tossing the papers about , ‘
210156	210157	210146	210146	I	0	’ ‘
210160	210180	210146	210146	I	0	’ cried Miss Sally , starting up , clapping her hands , and scattering the papers on the floor . ‘
210237	210238	210204	210204	He	426	’ ‘
210245	210261	210204	210204	He	426	’ said Dick , looking at Brass with a face as pale as his own . ‘
210271	210288	210269	210269	Sir	5863	’ replied the lawyer , feeling in all his pockets with looks of the greatest agitation , ‘
210310	210311	210269	210269	Sir	5863	’ ‘
210318	210327	210328	210328	Do	4865	’ said Miss Sally , taking more snuff . ‘
210358	210499	210328	210328	Do	4865	’ Mr Swiveller and Sampson Brass looked from Miss Sally to each other , in a state of bewilderment , and then , as by one impulse , caught up their hats and rushed out into the street -- darting along in the middle of the road , and dashing aside all obstructions , as though they were running for their lives . It happened that Kit had been running too , though not so fast , and having the start of them by some few minutes , was a good distance ahead . As they were pretty certain of the road he must have taken , however , and kept on at a great pace , they came up with him , at the very moment when he had taken breath , and was breaking into a run again . ‘
210502	210521	210328	210328	Do	4865	’ cried Sampson , laying his hand on one shoulder , while Mr Swiveller pounced upon the other . ‘
210528	210533	210542	210542	Kit	75	’re in a hurry ? ’
210534	210540	210542	210542	Kit	75	‘ Yes , I am , ’
210554	210564	210566	210566	Sampson	127	‘ I -- I -- can hardly believe it , ’
210568	210587	210566	210566	Sampson	127	‘ but something of value is missing from the office . I hope you do n’t know what . ’
210588	210598	210600	210600	Kit	75	‘ Know what ! good Heaven , Mr Brass ! ’
210608	210613	210600	210600	Kit	75	‘ you do n’t suppose-- ’
210614	210619	210621	210621	Brass	127	‘ No , no , ’
210624	210648	210621	210621	Brass	127	‘ I do n’t suppose anything . Do n’t say I said you did . You ’ll come back quietly , I hope ? ’
210649	210655	210657	210657	Kit	75	‘ Of course I will , ’
210659	210663	210657	210657	Kit	75	‘ Why not ? ’
210664	210669	210671	210671	Brass	127	‘ To be sure ! ’
210673	210716	210671	210671	Brass	127	‘ Why not ? I hope there may turn out to be no why not . If you knew the trouble I ’ve been in , this morning , through taking your part , Christopher , you ’d be sorry for it . ’
210717	210732	210734	210734	Kit	75	‘ And I am sure you ’ll be sorry for having suspected me sir , ’
210736	210745	210751	210751	Brass	127	‘ Come . Let us make haste back . ’
210746	210749	210751	210751	Brass	127	‘ Certainly ! ’
210753	210806	210751	210751	Brass	127	‘ the quicker , the better . Mr Richard -- have the goodness , sir , to take that arm . I ’ll take this one . It ’s not easy walking three abreast , but under these circumstances it must be done , sir ; there ’s no help for it . ’
211013	211019	211021	211021	Brass	127	‘ Now , you know , ’
211023	211062	211063	211063	he	75	‘ if this is a case of innocence , it is a case of that description , Christopher , where the fullest disclosure is the best satisfaction for everybody . Therefore if you ’ll consent to an examination , ’
211080	211093	211063	211063	he	75	‘ it will be a comfortable and pleasant thing for all parties . ’
211094	211098	211100	211100	Kit	75	‘ Search me , ’
211108	211131	211100	211100	Kit	75	‘ But mind , sir -- I know you ’ll be sorry for this , to the last day of your life . ’
211132	211141	211143	211143	Brass	127	‘ It is certainly a very painful occurrence , ’
211168	211214	211149	211149	he	127	‘ very painful . Nothing here , Mr Richard , Sir , all perfectly satisfactory . Nor here , sir . Nor in the waistcoat , Mr Richard , nor in the coat tails . So far , I am rejoiced , I am sure . ’
211291	211297	211299	211299	Dick	77	‘ Here ’s a handkerchief , ’
211301	211308	211310	211310	Brass	127	‘ No harm in that sir , ’
211336	211402	211326	211334	one who was contemplating an immense extent of prospect	4871	‘ No harm in a handkerchief Sir , whatever . The faculty do n’t consider it a healthy custom , I believe , Mr Richard , to carry one ’s handkerchief in one ’s hat -- I have heard that it keeps the head too warm -- but in every other point of view , its being there , is extremely satisfactory -- extremely so . ’
211442	211447	211449	211449	Brass	125	‘ In the hat ? ’
211456	211467	211469	211469	Dick	77	‘ Under the handkerchief , and tucked beneath the lining , ’
211510	211514	211516	211516	Sampson	127	‘ And this , ’
211522	211602	211604	211605	Mr Brass	127	‘ is the world that turns upon its own axis , and has Lunar influences , and revolutions round Heavenly Bodies , and various games of that sort ! This is human natur , is it ! Oh natur , natur ! This is the miscreant that I was going to benefit with all my little arts , and that , even now , I feel so much for , as to wish to let him go ! But , ’
211610	211688	211604	211605	Mr Brass	127	‘ I am myself a lawyer , and bound to set an example in carrying the laws of my happy country into effect . Sally my dear , forgive me , and catch hold of him on the other side . Mr Richard , sir , have the goodness to run and fetch a constable . The weakness is past and over sir , and moral strength returns . A constable , sir , if you please ! ’
211958	211963	211965	211969	this subordinate minister of justice	4884	‘ We had better , ’
211971	211998	211999	211999	he	4884	‘ get to the office while there ’s a magistrate sitting . I shall want you to come along with us , Mr Brass , and the-- ’
212021	212027	212029	212029	Sampson	127	‘ The lady , eh ? ’
212031	212034	212036	212037	the constable	4885	‘ Ah ! ’
212039	212054	212036	212037	the constable	4885	‘ Yes -- the lady . Likewise the young man that found the property . ’
212055	212061	212063	212063	Brass	127	‘ Mr Richard , Sir , ’
212069	212081	212063	212063	Brass	127	‘ A sad necessity . But the altar of our country sir-- ’
212082	212094	212096	212097	the constable	4885	‘ You ’ll have a hackney - coach , I suppose ? ’
212120	212132	212063	212063	Brass	127	‘ Be so good as send for one , will you ? ’
212133	212142	212144	212144	Kit	75	‘ But , hear me speak a word , ’
212155	212211	212144	212144	Kit	75	‘ Hear me speak a word . I am no more guilty than any one of you . Upon my soul I am not . I a thief ! Oh , Mr Brass , you know me better . I am sure you know me better . This is not right of you , indeed . ’
212212	212220	212222	212222	Brass	127	‘ I give you my word , constable-- ’
212233	212238	212226	212227	the constable	4885	‘ words be blowed ; ’
212262	212268	212270	212270	Brass	127	‘ Quite true , constable , ’
212277	212331	212270	212270	Brass	127	‘ Strictly correct . I give you my oath , constable , that down to a few minutes ago , when this fatal discovery was made , I had such confidence in that lad , that I ’d have trusted him with -- a hackney - coach , Mr Richard , sir ; you ’re

212346	212350	212270	212270	Brass	127	’ cried Kit , ‘
212426	212530	212532	212532	he	4895	’ Mr Brass rejoined that it would have been well for the prisoner if he had thought of that before and was about to make some other gloomy observations when the voice of the single gentleman was heard , demanding from above - stairs what was the matter , and what was the cause of all that noise and hurry . Kit made an involuntary start towards the door in his anxiety to answer for himself , but being speedily detained by the constable , had the agony of seeing Sampson Brass run out alone to tell the story in his own way . ‘
212540	212548	212532	212532	he	4895	’ said Sampson , when he returned , ‘
212581	212590	212591	212591	they	4897	’ cried Sampson , winking and rubbing them , ‘
212634	212635	212636	212637	Mr Brass	127	’ ‘
212639	212643	212636	212637	Mr Brass	127	’ said Kit . ‘
212657	212664	212652	212653	Mr Witherden	137	’ Sampson shook his head irresolutely . ‘
212667	212671	212672	212673	My master	761	’ said Kit . ‘
212688	212689	212672	212673	My master	761	’ ‘
212697	212721	212692	212692	I	0	’ stammered Brass , who perhaps had his reasons for wishing to show as fair as possible in the eyes of the notary . ‘
212735	213311	212731	212731	constable	10500	’ The constable , who had been chewing a straw all this while with great philosophy , replied that if they went away at once they would have time enough , but that if they stood shilly - shallying there , any longer , they must go straight to the Mansion House ; and finally expressed his opinion that that was where it was , and that was all about it . Mr Richard Swiveller having arrived inside the coach , and still remaining immoveable in the most commodious corner with his face to the horses , Mr Brass instructed the officer to remove his prisoner , and declared himself quite ready . Therefore , the constable , still holding Kit in the same manner , and pushing him on a little before him , so as to keep him at about three - quarters of an arm ’s length in advance ( which is the professional mode ) , thrust him into the vehicle and followed himself . Miss Sally entered next ; and there being now four inside , Sampson Brass got upon the box , and made the coachman drive on . Still completely stunned by the sudden and terrible change which had taken place in his affairs , Kit sat gazing out of the coach window , almost hoping to see some monstrous phenomenon in the streets which might give him reason to believe he was in a dream . Alas ! Everything was too real and familiar : the same succession of turnings , the same houses , the same streams of people running side by side in different directions upon the pavement , the same bustle of carts and carriages in the road , the same well - remembered objects in the shop windows : a regularity in the very noise and hurry which no dream ever mirrored . Dream - like as the story was , it was true . He stood charged with robbery ; the note had been found upon him , though he was innocent in thought and deed ; and they were carrying him back , a prisoner . Absorbed in these painful ruminations , thinking with a drooping heart of his mother and little Jacob , feeling as though even the consciousness of innocence would be insufficient to support him in the presence of his friends if they believed him guilty , and sinking in hope and courage more and more as they drew nearer to the notary ’s , poor Kit was looking earnestly out of the window , observant of nothing,--when all at once , as though it had been conjured up by magic , he became aware of the face of Quilp . And what a leer there was upon the face ! It was from the open window of a tavern that it looked out ; and the dwarf had so spread himself over it , with his elbows on the window - sill and his head resting on both his hands , that what between this attitude and his being swoln with suppressed laughter , he looked puffed and bloated into twice his usual breadth . Mr Brass , on recognising him , immediately stopped the coach . As it came to a halt directly opposite to where he stood , the dwarf pulled off his hat , and saluted the party with a hideous and grotesque politeness . ‘
213314	213318	212731	212731	constable	10500	’ he cried . ‘
213347	213348	213344	213345	Honest Kit	75	’ ‘
213354	213361	213349	213349	He	75	’ said Brass to the coachman . ‘
213383	213384	213381	213381	sir	5863	’ ‘
213388	213393	213381	213381	sir	5863	’ returned the dwarf . ‘
213406	213407	213397	213397	you	127	’ ‘
213417	213425	213415	213415	sir	5863	’ said Brass , shaking his head . ‘
213454	213455	213477	213478	a thief	1306	’ ‘
213458	213471	213472	213472	Kit	75	’ cried the dwarf , leaning half his body out of window . ‘
213534	213582	213530	213530	Kit	75	’ And with that , he burst into a yell of laughter , manifestly to the great terror of the coachman , and pointed to a dyer ’s pole hard by , where a dangling suit of clothes bore some resemblance to a man upon a gibbet . ‘
213591	213601	213589	213589	Kit	75	’ cried the dwarf , rubbing his hands violently . ‘
213680	213688	213677	213677	I	0	‘ em , will you ? Blessings on ‘
213706	213962	213963	213963	Sir	5863	’ With such good wishes and farewells , poured out in a rapid torrent until they were out of hearing , Quilp suffered them to depart ; and when he could see the coach no longer , drew in his head , and rolled upon the ground in an ecstacy of enjoyment . When they reached the notary ’s , which they were not long in doing , for they had encountered the dwarf in a bye street at a very little distance from the house , Mr Brass dismounted ; and opening the coach door with a melancholy visage , requested his sister to accompany him into the office , with the view of preparing the good people within , for the mournful intelligence that awaited them . Miss Sally complying , he desired Mr Swiveller to accompany them . So , into the office they went ; Mr Sampson and his sister arm - in - arm ; and Mr Swiveller following , alone . The notary was standing before the fire in the outer office , talking to Mr Abel and the elder Mr Garland , while Mr Chuckster sat writing at the desk , picking up such crumbs of their conversation as happened to fall in his way . This posture of affairs Mr Brass observed through the glass - door as he was turning the handle , and seeing that the notary recognised him , he began to shake his head and sigh deeply while that partition yet divided them . ‘
213965	213988	213963	213963	Sir	5863	’ said Sampson , taking off his hat , and kissing the two fore - fingers of his right hand beaver glove , ‘
214029	214030	214027	214027	sir	5863	’ ‘
214047	214055	214044	214045	Mr Brass	127	’ said the notary , turning away . ‘
214060	214064	214057	214057	you	5863	’ said Brass , ‘
214124	214156	214158	214158	Sir	5863	’ said Brass , stepping between the notary and his private office ( towards which he had begun to retreat ) , and speaking in the tone of an injured man , ‘
214176	214177	214178	214179	Mr Brass	127	’ ‘
214181	214191	214178	214179	Mr Brass	127	’ said the other , in a decided tone , ‘
214223	214224	214225	214225	Gentlemen	501	’ ‘
214227	214382	214225	214225	Gentlemen	501	’ said Brass , laying his right hand on his waistcoat , and looking towards the father and son with a smooth smile--‘Gentlemen , I appeal to you -- really , gentlemen -- consider , I beg of you . I am of the law . I am styled “ gentleman ” by Act of Parliament . I maintain the title by the annual payment of twelve pound sterling for a certificate . I am not one of your players of music , stage actors , writers of books , or painters of pictures , who assume a station that the laws of their country do n’t recognise . I am none of your strollers or vagabonds . If any man brings his action against me , he must describe me as a gentleman , or his action is null and void . I appeal to you -- is this quite respectful ? Really gentlemen-- ’
214383	214400	214402	214403	the notary	1334	‘ Well , will you have the goodness to state your business then , Mr Brass ? ’
214405	214408	214402	214403	the notary	1334	‘ Sir , ’
214412	214451	214402	214403	the notary	1334	‘ I will . Ah Mr Witherden ! you little know the -- but I will not be tempted to travel from the point , sir , I believe the name of one of these gentlemen is Garland . ’
214452	214456	214458	214459	the notary	1334	‘ Of both , ’
214461	214466	214458	214459	the notary	1334	‘ In - deed ! ’
214473	214524	214468	214468	Brass	127	‘ But I might have known that , from the uncommon likeness . Extremely happy , I am sure , to have the honour of an introduction to two such gentlemen , although the occasion is a most painful one . One of you gentlemen has a servant called Kit ? ’
214525	214528	214530	214531	the notary	1334	‘ Both , ’
214533	214537	214539	214539	Brass	127	‘ Two Kits ? ’
214542	214546	214539	214539	Brass	127	‘ Dear me ! ’
214547	214553	214555	214556	Mr Witherden	137	‘ One Kit , sir , ’
214559	214571	214555	214556	Mr Witherden	137	‘ who is employed by both gentlemen . What of him ? ’
214572	214579	214581	214581	Brass	127	‘ This of him , sir , ’
214588	214637	214584	214584	his	127	‘ That young man , sir , that I have felt unbounded and unlimited confidence in , and always behaved to as if he was my equal -- that young man has this morning committed a robbery in my office , and been taken almost in the fact . ’
214638	214645	214647	214648	the notary	1334	‘ This must be some falsehood ! ’
214650	214656	214658	214659	Mr Abel	138	‘ It is not possible , ’
214661	214671	214673	214675	the old gentleman	808	‘ I ’ll not believe one word of it , ’
214688	214752	214677	214678	Mr Brass	127	‘ Mr Witherden , sir , YOUR words are actionable , and if I was a man of low and mean standing , who could n’t afford to be slandered , I should proceed for damages . Hows’ever , sir , being what I am , I merely scorn such expressions . The honest warmth of the other gentleman I respect , and I ’m
214826	214977	214807	214807	you	4944	’ The three gentlemen looked at each other with blank faces when these words were uttered , and Mr Chuckster , doing as he was desired , and leaping off his stool with something of the excitement of an inspired prophet whose foretellings had in the fulness of time been realised , held the door open for the entrance of the wretched captive . Such a scene as there was , when Kit came in , and bursting into the rude eloquence with which Truth at length inspired him , called Heaven to witness that he was innocent , and that how the property came to be found upon him he knew not ! Such a confusion of tongues , before the circumstances were related , and the proofs disclosed ! Such a dead silence when all was told , and his three friends exchanged looks of doubt and amazement ! ‘
214983	214993	214807	214807	you	4944	’ said Mr Witherden , after a long pause , ‘
215020	215063	215077	215077	I	0	’ But this was clearly shown to be quite impossible . Mr Swiveller , though an unwilling witness , could not help proving to demonstration , from the position in which it was found , that it must have been designedly secreted . ‘
215069	215073	215077	215077	I	0	’ said Brass , ‘
215137	215143	215150	215151	the constable	4885	’re Christians , I hope ? ’
215144	215148	215150	215151	the constable	4885	‘ I suppose , ’
215156	215184	215150	215151	the constable	4885	‘ that no gentleman here can give evidence as to whether he ’s been flush of money of late , Do you happen to know , Sir ? ’
215185	215197	215199	215200	Mr Garland	138	‘ He has had money from time to time , certainly , ’
215211	215229	215199	215200	Mr Garland	138	‘ But that , as he always told me , was given him by Mr Brass himself . ’
215230	215236	215238	215238	Kit	75	‘ Yes to be sure , ’
215241	215252	215238	215238	Kit	75	‘ You can bear me out in that , Sir ? ’
215253	215256	215258	215258	Brass	127	‘ Eh ? ’
215272	215292	215294	215294	Kit	75	‘ The money you know , the half - crowns , that you gave me -- from the lodger , ’
215296	215301	215303	215303	Brass	127	‘ Oh dear me ! ’
215312	215328	215303	215303	Brass	127	‘ This is a bad case , I find ; a very bad case indeed . ’
215329	215345	215347	215348	Mr Garland	138	‘ What ! Did you give him no money on account of anybody , Sir ? ’
215354	215362	215364	215364	Sampson	127	‘ I give him money , Sir ! ’
215366	215390	215364	215364	Sampson	127	‘ Oh , come you know , this is too barefaced . Constable , my good fellow , we had better be going . ’
215391	215394	215396	215396	Kit	75	‘ What ! ’
215398	215424	215396	215396	Kit	75	‘ Does he deny that he did ? ask him , somebody , pray . Ask him to tell you whether he did or not ! ’
215425	215431	215433	215434	the notary	1334	‘ Did you , sir ? ’
215436	215444	215446	215446	Brass	127	‘ I tell you what , gentlemen , ’
215454	215498	215446	215446	Brass	127	‘ he ’ll not serve his case this way , and really , if you feel any interest in him , you had better advise him to go upon some other tack . Did I , sir ? Of course I never did . ’
215499	215502	215504	215504	Kit	75	‘ Gentlemen , ’
215513	215610	215504	215504	Kit	75	‘ Master , Mr Abel , Mr Witherden , every one of you -- he did it ! What I have done to offend him , I do n’t know , but this is a plot to ruin me . Mind , gentlemen , it ’s a plot , and whatever comes of it , I will say with my dying breath that he put that note in my hat himself ! Look at him , gentlemen ! see how he changes colour . Which of us looks the guilty person -- he , or I ? ’
215611	215618	215620	215620	Brass	127	‘ You hear him , gentlemen ? ’
215624	215700	215620	215620	Brass	127	‘ you hear him . Now , does this case strike you as assuming rather a black complexion , or does it not ? Is it at all a treacherous case , do you think , or is it one of mere ordinary guilt ? Perhaps , gentlemen , if he had not said this in your presence and I had reported it , you ’d have held this to be impossible likewise , eh ? ’
216272	216277	216279	216279	they	4969	‘ in which case , ’

I believe it of you Kit!-- ’
217871	217878	217880	217880	Kit	75	‘ Why then , thank God ! ’
217892	217924	217880	217880	Kit	75	‘ and I can bear it , mother ! Come what may , I shall always have one drop of happiness in my heart when I think that you said that . ’

218221	218275	218173	218175	the good woman	7411	‘ No , but if you please sir -- don’t be angry with me sir -- I am his mother , and you had a mother once -- if I might only see him eat a little bit , I should go away , so much more satisfied that he was all comfortable . ’
218564	218572	218557	218562	the third turnkey with the newspaper	5073	‘ Time ’s up!’--adding in the same breath ‘
218579	218659	218557	218562	the third turnkey with the newspaper	5073	’ and then plunging deep into his newspaper again . Kit was taken off in an instant , with a blessing from his mother , and a scream from little Jacob , ringing in his ears . As he was crossing the next yard with the basket in his hand , under the guidance of his former conductor , another officer called to them to stop , and came up with a pint pot of porter in his hand . ‘
218677	218693	218662	218663	Christopher Nubbles	75	’ said the man . His comrade replied that this was the chicken in question . ‘

219036	219057	219058	219058	I	0	’ muttered Sampson , as he stumbled for the twentieth time over some stray lumber , and limped in pain . ‘
219112	219144	219103	219103	She	125	’ As he paid this compliment to the merit of the absent charmer , Mr Brass came to a halt ; looking doubtfully towards the light , and over his shoulder . ‘
219153	219200	219147	219147	he	10011	’ murmured the lawyer , standing on tiptoe , and endeavouring to obtain a glimpse of what was passing inside , which at that distance was impossible--‘drinking , I suppose,--making himself more fiery and furious , and heating his malice and mischievousness till they boil . I ’m

Nor did the burden of this performance bear any reference to love , or war , or wine , or loyalty , or any other , the standard topics of song , but to a subject not often set to music or generally known in ballads ; the words being these:--‘The worthy magistrate , after remarking that the prisoner would find some difficulty in persuading a jury to believe his tale , committed him to take his trial at the approaching sessions ; and directed the customary recognisances to be entered into for the pros - e - cu - tion . ’
219461	219467	219469	219469	Brass	127	‘ He ’s dreadfully imprudent , ’
219484	219509	219511	219511	Brass	127	‘ Horribly imprudent . I wish he was dumb . I wish he was deaf . I wish he was blind . Hang him , ’

223313	223696	223697	223697	I	0	’ time , the sessions commenced . In one day afterwards , the Grand Jury found a True Bill against Christopher Nubbles for felony ; and in two days from that finding , the aforesaid Christopher Nubbles was called upon to plead Guilty or Not Guilty to an Indictment for that he the said Christopher did feloniously abstract and steal from the dwelling - house and office of one Sampson Brass , gentleman , one Bank Note for Five Pounds issued by the Governor and Company of the Bank of England ; in contravention of the Statutes in that case made and provided , and against the peace of our Sovereign Lord the King , his crown and dignity . To this indictment , Christopher Nubbles , in a low and trembling voice , pleaded Not Guilty ; and here , let those who are in the habit of forming hasty judgments from appearances , and who would have had Christopher , if innocent , speak out very strong and loud , observe , that confinement and anxiety will subdue the stoutest hearts ; and that to one who has been close shut up , though it be only for ten or eleven days , seeing but stone walls and a very few stony faces , the sudden entrance into a great hall filled with life , is a rather disconcerting and startling circumstance . To this , it must be added , that life in a wig is to a large class of people much more terrifying and impressive than life with its own head of hair ; and if , in addition to these considerations , there be taken into account Kit ’s natural emotion on seeing the two Mr Garlands and the little Notary looking on with pale and anxious faces , it will perhaps seem matter of no very great wonder that he should have been rather out of sorts , and unable to make himself quite at home . Although he had never seen either of the Mr Garlands , or Mr Witherden , since the time of his arrest , he had been given to understand that they had employed counsel for him . Therefore , when one of the gentlemen in wigs got up and said ‘
223706	223724	223697	223697	I	0	’ Kit made him a bow ; and when another gentleman in a wig got up and said ‘
223727	223734	223735	223735	Kit	75	’m against him , my Lord , ’
224188	224200	224175	224175	his	5180	‘ Here I am -- full of evidence -- Tap me ! ’
224447	224451	224453	224454	this gentleman	447	‘ Mr Swiveller , ’
224477	224516	224453	224454	this gentleman	447	‘ Pray sir , where did you dine yesterday?’--‘Where did I dine yesterday?’--‘Aye , sir , where did you dine yesterday -- was it near here , sir?’--‘Oh to be sure -- yes -- just over the way . ’--‘To
224527	224546	224548	224549	Mr Swiveller	78	’ repeats Mr Brass ’s gentleman , with a glance at the court.--‘Alone , sir?’--‘I beg your pardon , ’
224560	224572	224574	224574	you	5863	’ repeats Mr Brass ’s gentleman in a voice of thunder , ‘
224597	224643	224645	224646	Mr Brass	127	’ says Mr Swiveller with a smile.--‘Have the goodness to banish a levity , sir , which is very ill - suited to the place in which you stand ( though perhaps you have reason to be thankful that it ’s only that place ) , ’
224670	224725	224727	224728	Mr Brass	127	‘ and attend to me . You were waiting about here , yesterday , in expectation that this trial was coming on . You dined over the way . You treated somebody . Now , was that somebody brother to the prisoner at the bar?’--Mr Swiveller is proceeding to explain--‘Yes or No , sir , ’
224746	224756	224727	224728	Mr Brass	127	’ cries the gentleman , taking him up short . ‘
224765	224929	224931	224932	Mr Garland	138	’ Down sits Mr Brass ’s gentleman . Kit ’s gentleman , not knowing how the matter really stands , is afraid to pursue the subject . Richard Swiveller retires abashed . Judge , jury and spectators have visions of his lounging about , with an ill - looking , large - whiskered , dissolute young fellow of six feet high . The reality is , little Jacob , with the calves of his legs exposed to the open air , and himself tied up in a shawl . Nobody knows the truth ; everybody believes a falsehood ; and all because of the ingenuity of Mr Brass ’s gentleman . Then come the witnesses to character , and here Mr Brass ’s gentleman shines again . It turns out that Mr Garland has had no character with Kit , no recommendation of him but from his own mother , and that he was suddenly dismissed by his former master for unknown reasons . ‘
224934	224941	224931	224932	Mr Garland	138	’ says Mr Brass ’s gentleman , ‘
224970	225132	224967	224967	I	0	’ The jury think so too , and find Kit guilty . He is taken off , humbly protesting his innocence . The spectators settle themselves in their places with renewed attention , for there are several female witnesses to be examined in the next case , and it has been rumoured that Mr Brass ’s gentleman will make great fun in cross - examining them for the prisoner . Kit ’s mother , poor woman , is waiting at the grate below stairs , accompanied by Barbara ’s mother ( who , honest soul ! never does anything but cry , and hold the baby ) , and a sad interview ensues . The newspaper - reading turnkey has told them all . He do n’t think it will be transportation for life , because there ’s time to prove the good character yet , and that is sure to serve him . He wonders what he did it for . ‘
225138	225144	225133	225133	He	5224	’ cries Kit ’s mother . ‘
225147	225152	225133	225133	He	5224	’ says the turnkey , ‘
225173	225242	225167	225167	he	5224	’ Kit ’s mother can reach his hand through the bars , and she clasps it-- God , and those to whom he has given such tenderness , only know in how much agony . Kit bids her keep a good heart , and , under pretence of having the children lifted up to kiss him , prays Barbara ’s mother in a whisper to take her home . ‘
225253	225257	225243	225244	Some friend	9353	’ cried Kit , ‘
225353	225509	225341	225343	no good gentleman	5233	’ The hand slips out of his , for the poor creature sinks down upon the earth , insensible . Richard Swiveller comes hastily up , elbows the bystanders out of the way , takes her ( after some trouble ) in one arm after the manner of theatrical ravishers , and , nodding to Kit , and commanding Barbara ’s mother to follow , for he has a coach waiting , bears her swiftly off . Well ; Richard took her home . And what astonishing absurdities in the way of quotation from song and poem he perpetrated on the road , no man knows . He took her home , and stayed till she was recovered ; and , having no money to pay the coach , went back in state to Bevis Marks , bidding the driver ( for it was Saturday night ) wait at the door while he went in for ‘
225512	225513	225514	225515	Mr Richard	78	’ ‘
225519	225524	225514	225515	Mr Richard	78	’ said Brass cheerfully , ‘
225528	225604	225514	225515	Mr Richard	78	’ Monstrous as Kit ’s tale had appeared , at first , Mr Richard did , that night , half suspect his affable employer of some deep villany . Perhaps it was but the misery he had just witnessed which gave his careless nature this impulse ; but , be that as it may , it was very strong upon him , and he said in as few words as possible , what he wanted . ‘
225607	225616	225514	225515	Mr Richard	78	’ cried Brass , taking out his purse . ‘
225653	225654	225651	225651	sir	5863	’ ‘
225657	225663	225651	225651	sir	5863	’ returned Dick , shortly . ‘
225666	225670	225651	225651	sir	5863	’ said Brass , ‘
225682	225686	225681	225681	You	78	’re very welcome I ’m
225691	225706	225690	225690	sir--	8925	’ Dick , who had by this time reached the door , turned round . ‘
225711	225715	225690	225690	sir--	8925	’ said Brass , ‘
225726	225727	225728	225728	Eh	5241	’ ‘
225730	225731	225728	225728	Eh	5241	’ ‘
225738	225759	225735	225736	Mr Richard	78	’ said Brass , thrusting his hands in his pockets , and rocking himself to and fro on his stool , ‘
225861	225942	225949	225950	Mr Swiveller	78	’m sure . She ’s extremely sorry to lose you , Mr Richard , but a sense of her duty to society reconciles her . An amazing creature that , sir ! You ’ll find the money quite correct , I think . There ’s a cracked window sir , but I ’ve not made any deduction on that account . Whenever we part with friends , Mr Richard , let us part liberally . A delightful sentiment , sir ! ’
226848	226850	226841	226841	his	78	‘ I ’m
226853	226857	226841	226841	his	78	’ thought Richard , ‘
226885	226920	226985	226985	one	427	‘ em . If this is not a dream , I have woke up , by mistake , in an Arabian Night , instead of a London one . But I have no doubt I ’m

226940	226945	226946	226946	I	0	’ thought Mr Swiveller . ‘
227002	227025	226996	226996	I	0	’ For the purpose of testing his real condition , Mr Swiveller , after some reflection , pinched himself in the arm . ‘
227029	227033	227034	227034	I	0	’ he thought . ‘
227059	227098	227053	227053	I	0	’ The result of this additional inspection was , to convince Mr Swiveller that the objects by which he was surrounded were real , and that he saw them , beyond all question , with his waking eyes . ‘
227111	227115	227116	227116	I	0	’ said Richard . ‘
227117	227176	227178	227179	Mr Swiveller	78	’m in Damascus or Grand Cairo . The Marchioness is a Genie , and having had a wager with another Genie about who is the handsomest young man alive , and the worthiest to be the husband of the Princess of China , has brought me away , room and all , to compare us together . Perhaps , ’
227202	227215	227178	227179	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ the Princess may be still -- No , she ’s gone . ’
227300	227311	227294	227294	he	78	’ The Marchioness jumped up quickly and clapped her hands . ‘
227317	227322	227323	227323	they	5261	’ thought Mr Swiveller ; ‘
227350	227393	227397	227397	she	270	’ It appeared , however , that she had only clapped her hands for joy ; for directly afterward she began to laugh , and then to cry ; declaring , not in choice Arabic but in familiar English , that she was ‘
227405	227406	227397	227397	she	270	’ ‘
227409	227416	227397	227397	she	270	’ said Mr Swiveller , thoughtfully , ‘
227452	227480	227481	227481	I	0	’ The Marchioness only shook her head mournfully , and cried again ; whereupon Mr Swiveller ( being very weak ) felt his own eyes affected likewise . ‘
227496	227510	227487	227487	your	270	’ said Richard after a pause , and smiling with a trembling lip , ‘
227517	227518	227519	227519	You	0	’ ‘
227523	227533	227519	227519	You	0	’ replied the small servant , wiping her eyes . ‘
227543	227544	227537	227537	you	0	’ ‘
227547	227551	227537	227537	you	0	’ said Dick . ‘
227561	227562	227558	227558	I	0	’ ‘
227568	227574	227558	227558	I	0	’ replied the small servant . ‘
227588	227616	227585	227585	you	0	’ Mr Swiveller was silent for a long while . By and bye , he began to talk again , inquiring how long he had been there . ‘
227623	227628	227585	227585	you	0	’ replied the servant . ‘
227632	227636	227585	227585	you	0	’ said Dick . ‘
227639	227645	227585	227585	you	0	’ returned the Marchioness emphatically ; ‘
227652	227942	227943	227943	Marchioness	270	’ The bare thought of having been in such extremity , caused Richard to fall into another silence , and to lie flat down again , at his full length . The Marchioness , having arranged the bed - clothes more comfortably , and felt that his hands and forehead were quite cool -- a discovery that filled her with delight -- cried a little more , and then applied herself to getting tea ready , and making some thin dry toast . While she was thus engaged , Mr Swiveller looked on with a grateful heart , very much astonished to see how thoroughly at home she made herself , and attributing this attention , in its origin , to Sally Brass , whom , in his own mind , he could not thank enough . When the Marchioness had finished her toasting , she spread a clean cloth on a tray , and brought him some crisp slices and a great basin of weak tea , with which ( she said ) the doctor had left word he might refresh himself when he awoke . She propped him up with pillows , if not as skilfully as if she had been a professional nurse all her life , at least as tenderly ; and looked on with unutterable satisfaction while the patient -- stopping every now and then to shake her by the hand -- took his poor meal with an appetite and relish , which the greatest dainties of the earth , under any other circumstances , would have failed to provoke . Having cleared away , and disposed everything comfortably about him again , she sat down at the table to take her own tea . ‘
227945	227950	227943	227943	Marchioness	270	’ said Mr Swiveller , ‘
227955	227978	227953	227953	Sally	125	’ The small servant screwed her face into an expression of the very uttermost entanglement of slyness , and shook her head . ‘
227988	227992	227983	227983	you	270	’ said Dick . ‘
227996	228002	227994	227994	her	125	’ cried the small servant . ‘
228011	228047	228004	228004	you	270	’ Mr Swiveller immediately laid himself down again quite flat , and so remained for about five minutes . By slow degrees he resumed his sitting posture after that lapse of time , and inquired : ‘
228056	228057	228054	228054	Marchioness	270	’ ‘
228060	228066	228054	228054	Marchioness	270	’ cried the small servant . ‘
228069	228070	228054	228054	Marchioness	270	’ ‘
228073	228148	228054	228054	Marchioness	270	’ said Mr Swiveller . And with that he fell down flat again , as suddenly as if he had been shot . Thus he remained , motionless and bereft of speech , until she had finished her meal , put everything in its place , and swept the hearth ; when he motioned her to bring a chair to the bedside , and , being propped up again , opened a farther conversation . ‘
228152	228156	228157	228157	you	270	’ said Dick , ‘
228162	228163	228157	228157	you	270	’ ‘
228166	228171	228157	228157	you	270	’ said the Marchioness , ‘
228181	228182	228173	228173	they	5263	’ ‘
228190	228198	228185	228185	I	0	’ said Dick--‘what have they been doing ? ’
228199	228214	228216	228217	the Marchioness	270	‘ Been a tizing of me -- tizing you know -- in the newspapers , ’
228219	228224	228226	228226	Dick	77	‘ Aye , aye , ’
228228	228231	228226	228226	Dick	77	‘ advertising ? ’
228266	228270	228272	228272	he	77	‘ Tell me , ’
228274	228285	228272	228272	he	77	‘ how it was that you thought of coming here . ’
228286	228292	228294	228295	the Marchioness	10377	‘ Why , you see , ’
228297	228344	228294	228295	the Marchioness	10377	‘ when you was gone , I had n’t any friend at all , because the lodger he never come back , and I did n’t know where either him or you was to be found , you know . But one morning , when I was-- ’
228345	228351	228353	228354	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ Was near a keyhole ? ’
228361	228365	228367	228369	the small servant	2874	‘ Well then , ’
228373	228505	228367	228369	the small servant	2874	‘ when I was near the office keyhole -- as you see me through , you know -- I heard somebody saying that she lived here , and was the lady whose house you lodged at , and that you was took very bad , and would n’t nobody come and take care of you . Mr Brass , he says , “ It ’s no business of mine , ” he says ; and Miss Sally , she says , “ He ’s a funny chap , but it ’s no business of mine ; ” and the lady went away , and slammed the door to , when she went out , I can tell you . So I run away that night , and come here , and told ‘
228525	228526	228518	228518	I	0	’ ‘
228538	228542	228534	228534	herself	5272	’ cried Dick . ‘
228548	228552	228544	228544	I	0	’ she returned , ‘
228601	228632	228635	228636	Mr Liverer	294	’ winder , and if you could have heard how you used to keep on singing and making speeches , you would n’t have believed it -- I’m so glad you ’re
228638	228639	228640	228640	Liverer	294	’ ‘
228643	228648	228640	228640	Liverer	294	’ said Dick thoughtfully . ‘
228671	228736	228737	228738	The doctor	7036	’ At this point , Mr Swiveller took the small servant ’s hand in his again , and being , as we have seen , but poorly , might in struggling to express his thanks have made his eyes as red as hers , but that she quickly changed the theme by making him lie down , and urging him to keep very quiet . ‘
228740	228745	228737	228738	The doctor	7036	’ she told him , ‘
228813	228883	228904	228904	Marchioness	270	’ The Marchioness , in saying these words , brought a little table to the bedside , took her seat at it , and began to work away at the concoction of some cooling drink , with the address of a score of chemists . Richard Swiveller being indeed fatigued , fell into a slumber , and waking in about half an hour , inquired what time it was . ‘
228890	228903	228904	228904	Marchioness	270	’ replied his small friend , helping him to sit up again . ‘
228906	228932	228904	228904	Marchioness	270	’ said Richard , passing his hand over his forehead and turning suddenly round , as though the subject but that moment flashed upon him , ‘
228939	228955	228937	228937	Kit	75	’ He had been sentenced to transportation for a great many years , she said . ‘
228960	228973	228974	228974	His	75	’ asked Dick--‘his mother -- how is she,--what has become of her ? ’
228989	228996	228998	228998	she	5276	‘ But , if I thought , ’
229003	229029	228998	228998	she	5276	‘ that you ’d keep quiet , and not put yourself into another fever , I could tell you -- but I wo n’t now . ’
229030	229035	229037	229037	Dick	77	‘ Yes , do , ’
229039	229045	229037	229037	Dick	77	‘ It will amuse me . ’
229046	229053	229055	229057	the small servant	2874	‘ Oh ! would it though ! ’
229064	229074	229055	229057	the small servant	2874	‘ I know better than that . Wait till you ’re
229083	229160	229078	229078	I	0	’ Dick looked very earnestly at his little friend : and his eyes , being large and hollow from illness , assisted the expression so much , that she was quite frightened , and besought him not to think any more about it . What had already fallen from her , however , had not only piqued his curiosity , but seriously alarmed him , wherefore he urged her to tell him the worst at once . ‘
229169	229175	229078	229078	I	0	’ said the small servant . ‘
229185	229186	229078	229078	I	0	’ ‘
229213	229222	229078	229078	I	0	’ asked Dick , in a breathless state . ‘
229225	229231	229078	229078	I	0	’ replied the small servant . ‘
229238	229243	229235	229236	Bevis Marks	130	’ pursued Dick hastily . ‘
229250	229251	229248	229248	Sally	125	’ ‘
229254	229374	229248	229248	Sally	125	’ cried the small servant again . Richard Swiveller thrust his lank arm out of bed , and , gripping her by the wrist and drawing her close to him , bade her out with it , and freely too , or he would not answer for the consequences ; being wholly unable to endure the state of excitement and expectation . She , seeing that he was greatly agitated , and that the effects of postponing her revelation might be much more injurious than any that were likely to ensue from its being made at once , promised compliance , on condition that the patient kept himself perfectly quiet , and abstained from starting up or tossing about . ‘
229383	229389	229377	229377	you	77	’ said the small servant , ‘
229401	229402	229397	229397	I	0	’ ‘
229415	229419	229410	229410	you	77	’ said Dick . ‘
229457	229490	229453	229453	I	0	’ Unable to resist these fervent adjurations , which Richard Swiveller poured out as passionately as if they had been of the most solemn and tremendous nature , his companion spoke thus : ‘
229676	229717	229663	229663	I	0	’ Here , Mr Swiveller made a violent demonstration with his legs . But the small servant immediately pausing in her talk , he subsided again , and pleading a momentary forgetfulness of their compact , entreated her to proceed . ‘
229724	229730	229718	229718	They	5284	’ said the small servant . ‘
229806	229833	229798	229798	you	77	’ Mr Swiveller replied that he had never tasted that ardent liquor ; and once more urged his friend to resume the thread of her narrative . ‘
229846	229852	229835	229835	you	77	’ said the small servant , ‘
229937	229964	229969	229969	his	78	’ at the office fire ; and I tell you the truth , that I come to listen again , about the key of the safe . ’
230019	230026	230028	230030	the small servant	2874	‘ There was him and her , ’
230032	230036	230028	230030	the small servant	2874	‘ a - sittin ’
230101	230441	230096	230096	she	125	’re the chickenest - hearted , feeblest , faintest man I ever see , and I think , ” she says , “ that I ought to have been the brother , and you the sister . Is n’t Quilp , ” she says , “ our principal support ? ” “ He certainly is , ” says Mr Brass , “ And an’t we , ” she says , “ constantly ruining somebody or other in the way of business ? ” “ We certainly are , ” says Mr Brass . “ Then does it signify , ” she says , “ about ruining this Kit when Quilp desires it ? ” “ It certainly does not signify , ” says Mr Brass . Then they whispered and laughed for a long time about there being no danger if it was well done , and then Mr Brass pulls out his pocket - book , and says , “ Well , ” he says , “ here it is -- Quilp ’s own five - pound note . We ’ll agree that way , then , ” he says . “ Kit ’s coming to - morrow morning , I know . While he ’s up - stairs , you ’ll get out of the way , and I ’ll clear off Mr Richard . Having Kit alone , I ’ll hold him in conversation , and put this property in his hat . I ’ll manage so , besides , ” he says , “ that Mr Richard shall find it there , and be the evidence . And if that do n’t get Christopher out of Mr Quilp ’s way , and satisfy Mr Quilp ’s grudges , ” he says , “ the Devil ’s in it . ” Miss Sally laughed , and said that was the plan , and as they seemed to be moving away , and I was afraid to stop any longer , I went down - stairs again.--There ! ’

230591	230611	230589	230589	Marchioness	5300	’ said Mr Swiveller , plucking off his nightcap and flinging it to the other end of the room ; ‘

230651	230656	230642	230642	You	78	’ cried his nurse . ‘

230768	230773	230741	230742	the Marchioness	10377	’ said Richard dolefully , ‘
230776	230791	230741	230742	the Marchioness	10377	’re right . What ought I to do ! what is to be done ! ’

230957	230973	230936	230936	she	2874	‘ I suppose there ’s nothing left -- not so much as a waistcoat even ? ’
230974	230979	230936	230936	she	2874	‘ No , nothing . ’
230980	230985	230987	230988	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ It ’s embarrassing , ’
230990	231019	230987	230988	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ in case of fire -- even an umbrella would be something -- but you did quite right , dear Marchioness . I should have died without you ! ’
231802	231886	231792	231793	the man	325	‘ Woa then’--intimating that if he might venture to express a wish , it would be that they stopped there . The pony made a moment ’s pause ; but , as if it occurred to him that to stop when he was required might be to establish an inconvenient and dangerous precedent , he immediately started off again , rattled at a fast trot to the street corner , wheeled round , came back , and then stopped of his own accord . ‘
231890	231895	231889	231889	you	139	’re a precious creatur ! ’
231922	231935	231889	231889	you	139	‘ I wish I had the rewarding of you -- I do . ’
231936	231943	231945	231946	Mr Abel	138	‘ What has he been doing ? ’
231961	231973	231975	231976	the hostler	5347	‘ He ’s enough to fret a man ’s heart out , ’
231978	231992	231975	231976	the hostler	5347	‘ He is the most wicious rascal -- Woa then , will you ? ’
231993	232006	232008	232009	Mr Abel	138	‘ He ’ll never stand still , if you call him names , ’
232019	232095	232008	232009	Mr Abel	138	‘ He ’s a very good fellow if you know how to manage him . This is the first time he has been out , this long while , for he has lost his old driver and would n’t stir for anybody else , till this morning . The lamps are right , are they ? That ’s well . Be here to take him to - morrow , if you please . Good night ! ’
232348	232357	232331	232331	his	138	‘ God bless me , what is this ! ’
232358	232366	232368	232371	the still panting messenger	5351	‘ Do n’t be frightened , Sir , ’
232373	232384	232331	232331	his	138	‘ Oh I ’ve run such a way after you ! ’
232385	232393	232395	232396	Mr Abel	138	‘ What do you want with me ? ’
232398	232405	232395	232396	Mr Abel	138	‘ How did you come here ? ’
232406	232412	232414	232415	the Marchioness	10377	‘ I got in behind , ’
232417	232488	232414	232415	the Marchioness	10377	‘ Oh please drive on , sir -- don’t stop -- and go towards the City , will you ? And oh do please make haste , because it ’s of consequence . There ’s somebody wants to see you there . He sent me to say would you come directly , and that he knowed all about Kit , and could save him yet , and prove his innocence . ’
232489	232498	232331	232331	his	138	‘ What do you tell me , child ? ’
232499	232532	232414	232415	the Marchioness	10377	‘ The truth , upon my word and honour I do . But please to drive on-- quick , please ! I ’ve been such a time gone , he ’ll think I ’m
232535	232603	232331	232331	his	138	’ Mr Abel involuntarily urged the pony forward . The pony , impelled by some secret sympathy or some new caprice , burst into a great pace , and neither slackened it , nor indulged in any eccentric performances , until they arrived at the door of Mr Swiveller ’s lodging , where , marvellous to relate , he consented to stop when Mr Abel checked him . ‘
232613	232628	232331	232331	his	138	’ said the Marchioness , pointing to one where there was a faint light . ‘
232631	232776	232331	232331	his	138	’ Mr Abel , who was one of the simplest and most retiring creatures in existence , and naturally timid withal , hesitated ; for he had heard of people being decoyed into strange places to be robbed and murdered , under circumstances very like the present , and , for anything he knew to the contrary , by guides very like the Marchioness . His regard for Kit , however , overcame every other consideration . So , entrusting Whisker to the charge of a man who was lingering hard by in expectation of the job , he suffered his companion to take his hand , and to lead him up the dark and narrow stairs . He was not a little surprised to find himself conducted into a dimly - lighted sick chamber , where a man was sleeping tranquilly in bed . ‘
232788	232798	232801	232801	you	5355	’ said his guide , in an earnest whisper . ‘
232819	232894	232808	232808	you	5355	’ Mr Abel made no answer , and , to say the truth , kept a long way from the bed and very near the door . His guide , who appeared to understand his reluctance , trimmed the candle , and taking it in her hand , approached the bed . As she did so , the sleeper started up , and he recognised in the wasted face the features of Richard Swiveller . ‘
232901	232913	232914	232914	You	5355	’ said Mr Abel kindly , as he hurried towards him . ‘
232919	232920	232914	232914	You	5355	’ ‘
232923	232927	232914	232914	You	5355	’ replied Dick . ‘
232971	232994	232969	232969	Sir	5863	’ Mr Abel seemed rather astonished to hear of the quality of his guide , and took a chair by the bedside . ‘
233003	233013	233001	233001	Sir	5863	’ said Dick--‘but she told you on what account ? ’
233014	233037	233039	233040	Mr Abel	138	‘ She did . I am quite bewildered by all this . I really do n’t know what to say or think , ’
233042	233049	233051	233051	Dick	77	‘ You ’ll say that presently , ’
233053	233090	233051	233051	Dick	77	‘ Marchioness , take a seat on the bed , will you ? Now , tell this gentleman all that you told me ; and be particular . Do n’t you speak another word , Sir . ’
233138	233153	233117	233117	his	78	‘ You have heard it all , and you ’ll not forget it . I ’m
233232	233279	233231	233231	you	5362	’re pretty sure to find me at home , for a week or two . There are more reasons than one for that . Marchioness , a light ! If you lose another minute in looking at me , sir , I ’ll never forgive you ! ’
233326	233331	233333	233333	Dick	77	‘ That ’s right ! ’
233335	233395	233333	233333	Dick	77	‘ and hearty of him ; and I honour him from this time . But get some supper and a mug of beer , for I am sure you must be tired . Do have a mug of beer . It will do me as much good to see you take it as if I might drink it myself . ’
233465	233491	233454	233455	Mr Swiveller	78	‘ Strew then , oh strew , a bed of rushes . Here will we stay , till morning blushes . Good night , Marchioness ! ’
233727	233732	233734	233734	Dick	77	‘ And that is , ’
233745	233767	233734	233734	Dick	77	‘ that you answer me this question truly , before I take a bit or drop . Is it too late ? ’
233768	233780	233782	233784	the old gentleman	808	‘ For completing the work you began so well last night ? ’
233786	233806	233782	233784	the old gentleman	808	‘ No . Set your mind at rest on that point . It is not , I assure you . ’
234021	234053	234002	234003	the Marchioness	10377	‘ You see this fellow -- can I help this?’--and they , being thus made , as it were , parties to the scene , as regularly answered by another look , ‘
234059	234326	234327	234327	Gentlemen	501	’ This dumb - show , taking place during the whole time of the invalid ’s breakfast , and the invalid himself , pale and emaciated , performing no small part in the same , it may be fairly questioned whether at any meal , where no word , good or bad , was spoken from beginning to end , so much was expressed by gestures in themselves so slight and unimportant . At length -- and to say the truth before very long -- Mr Swiveller had despatched as much toast and tea as in that stage of his recovery it was discreet to let him have . But the cares of the Marchioness did not stop here ; for , disappearing for an instant and presently returning with a basin of fair water , she laved his face and hands , brushed his hair , and in short made him as spruce and smart as anybody under such circumstances could be made ; and all this , in as brisk and business - like a manner , as if he were a very little boy , and she his grown - up nurse . To these various attentions , Mr Swiveller submitted in a kind of grateful astonishment beyond the reach of language . When they were at last brought to an end , and the Marchioness had withdrawn into a distant corner to take her own poor breakfast ( cold enough by that time ) , he turned his face away for some few moments , and shook hands heartily with the air . ‘
234329	234344	234327	234327	Gentlemen	501	’ said Dick , rousing himself from this pause , and turning round again , ‘
234378	234401	234377	234377	We	5386	’re short of chairs here , among other trifles , but if you ’ll do me the favour to sit upon the bed-- ’
234402	234410	234412	234413	Mr Garland	298	‘ What can we do for you ? ’
234417	234435	234412	234413	Mr Garland	298	‘ If you could make the Marchioness yonder , a Marchioness , in real , sober earnest , ’
234439	234497	234437	234437	Dick	77	‘ I ’d thank you to get it done off - hand . But as you ca n’t , and as the question is not what you will do for me , but what you will do for somebody else who has a better claim upon you , pray sir let me know what you intend doing . ’
234498	234512	234514	234516	the single gentleman	2796	‘ It ’s chiefly on that account that we have come just now , ’
234518	234557	234514	234516	the single gentleman	2796	‘ for you will have another visitor presently . We feared you would be anxious unless you knew from ourselves what steps we intended to take , and therefore came to you before we stirred in the matter . ’
234558	234561	234563	234563	Dick	77	‘ Gentlemen , ’
234565	234594	234563	234563	Dick	77	‘ I thank you . Anybody in the helpless state that you see me in , is naturally anxious . Do n’t let me interrupt you , sir . ’
234595	234605	234607	234609	the single gentleman	2796	‘ Then , you see , my good fellow , ’
234611	234633	234607	234609	the single gentleman	2796	‘ that while we have no doubt whatever of the truth of this disclosure , which has so providentially come to light-- ’
234634	234638	234640	234640	Dick	77	‘ Meaning hers ? ’
234647	234792	234640	234640	Dick	77	‘ --Meaning hers , of course . While we have no doubt of that , or that a proper use of it would procure the poor lad ’s immediate pardon and liberation , we have a great doubt whether it would , by itself , enable us to reach Quilp , the chief agent in this villany . I should tell you that this doubt has been confirmed into something very nearly approaching certainty by the best opinions we have been enabled , in this short space of time , to take upon the subject . You ’ll agree with us , that to give him even the most distant chance of escape , if we could help it , would be monstrous . You say with us , no doubt , if somebody must escape , let it be any one but he . ’
234793	234796	234798	234798	Dick	77	‘ Yes , ’
234800	234815	234798	234798	Dick	77	‘ certainly . That is if somebody must -- but upon my word , I ’m
234854	234910	234912	234912	she	5391	’ The single gentleman smiled as if the light in which Mr Swiveller had put the question were not the clearest in the world , and proceeded to explain that they contemplated proceeding by stratagem in the first instance ; and that their design was to endeavour to extort a confession from the gentle Sarah . ‘
234925	234929	234912	234912	she	5391	’ he said , ‘
234976	235870	234965	234965	she	5391	’ Dick received this project in anything but a gracious manner , representing with as much warmth as he was then capable of showing , that they would find the old buck ( meaning Sarah ) more difficult to manage than Quilp himself -- that , for any tampering , terrifying , or cajolery , she was a very unpromising and unyielding subject -- that she was of a kind of brass not easily melted or moulded into shape -- in short , that they were no match for her , and would be signally defeated . But it was in vain to urge them to adopt some other course . The single gentleman has been described as explaining their joint intentions , but it should have been written that they all spoke together ; that if any one of them by chance held his peace for a moment , he stood gasping and panting for an opportunity to strike in again : in a word , that they had reached that pitch of impatience and anxiety where men can neither be persuaded nor reasoned with ; and that it would have been as easy to turn the most impetuous wind that ever blew , as to prevail on them to reconsider their determination . So , after telling Mr Swiveller how they had not lost sight of Kit ’s mother and the children ; how they had never once even lost sight of Kit himself , but had been unremitting in their endeavours to procure a mitigation of his sentence ; how they had been perfectly distracted between the strong proofs of his guilt , and their own fading hopes of his innocence ; and how he , Richard Swiveller , might keep his mind at rest , for everything should be happily adjusted between that time and night;--after telling him all this , and adding a great many kind and cordial expressions , personal to himself , which it is unnecessary to recite , Mr Garland , the notary , and the single gentleman , took their leaves at a very critical time , or Richard Swiveller must assuredly have been driven into another fever , whereof the results might have been fatal . Mr Abel remained behind , very often looking at his watch and at the room door , until Mr Swiveller was roused from a short nap , by the setting - down on the landing - place outside , as from the shoulders of a porter , of some giant load , which seemed to shake the house , and made the little physic bottles on the mantel - shelf ring again . Directly this sound reached his ears , Mr Abel started up , and hobbled to the door , and opened it ; and behold ! there stood a strong man , with a mighty hamper , which , being hauled into the room and presently unpacked , disgorged such treasures as tea , and coffee , and wine , and rusks , and oranges , and grapes , and fowls ready trussed for boiling , and calves’-foot jelly , and arrow - root , and sago , and other delicate restoratives , that the small servant , who had never thought it possible that such things could be , except in shops , stood rooted to the spot in her one shoe , with her mouth and eyes watering in unison , and her power of speech quite gone . But , not so Mr Abel ; or the strong man who emptied the hamper , big as it was , in a twinkling ; and not so the nice old lady , who appeared so suddenly that she might have come out of the hamper too ( it was quite large enough ) , and who , bustling about on tiptoe and without noise -- now here , now there , now everywhere at once -- began to fill out the jelly in tea - cups , and to make chicken broth in small saucepans , and to peel oranges for the sick man and to cut them up in little pieces , and to ply the small servant with glasses of wine and choice bits of everything until more substantial meat could be prepared for her refreshment . The whole of which appearances were so unexpected and bewildering , that Mr Swiveller , when he had taken two oranges and a little jelly , and had seen the strong man walk off with the empty basket , plainly leaving all that abundance for his use and benefit , was fain to lie down and fall asleep again , from sheer inability to entertain such wonders in his mind . Meanwhile , the single gentleman , the Notary , and Mr Garland , repaired to a certain coffee - house , and from that place indited and sent a letter to Miss Sally Brass , requesting her , in terms mysterious and brief , to favour an unknown friend who wished to consult her , with her company there , as speedily as possible . The communication performed its errand so well , that within ten minutes of the messenger ’s return and report of its delivery , Miss Brass herself was announced . ‘
235874	235888	234965	234965	she	5391	’ said the single gentleman , whom she found alone in the room , ‘
235893	235936	234965	234965	she	5391	’ Miss Brass sat herself down , in a very stiff and frigid state , and seemed -- as indeed she was -- not a little astonished to find that the lodger and her mysterious correspondent were one and the same person . ‘
235945	235951	235937	235937	You	5394	’ said the single gentleman . ‘
235960	235965	235952	235952	I	0	’ returned the beauty . ‘
236007	236028	236006	236006	You	5394	’re a responsible party , and in such a case lawful money and lawful notice are pretty much the same . ’
236029	236040	236042	236044	the single gentleman	2796	‘ I am obliged to you for your good opinion , ’
236046	236069	236042	236044	the single gentleman	2796	‘ and quite concur in these sentiments . But that is not the subject on which I wish to speak with you . ’
236070	236073	236075	236075	Sally	125	‘ Oh ! ’
236077	236094	236075	236075	Sally	125	‘ Then just state the particulars , will you ? I suppose it ’s professional business ? ’
236095	236107	236006	236006	You	5394	‘ Why , it is connected with the law , certainly . ’
236108	236112	236114	236115	Miss Brass	125	‘ Very well , ’
236117	236139	236114	236115	Miss Brass	125	‘ My brother and I are just the same . I can take any instructions , or give you any advice . ’
236140	236150	236152	236154	the single gentleman	2796	‘ As there are other parties interested besides myself , ’
236166	236180	236152	236154	the single gentleman	2796	‘ we had better confer together . Miss Brass is here , gentlemen . ’
236261	236265	236267	236268	the Notary	1334	‘ Miss Brass , ’
236277	236314	236267	236268	the Notary	1334	‘ we professional people understand each other , and , when we choose , can say what we have to say , in very few words . You advertised a runaway servant , the other day ? ’
236315	236318	236320	236321	Miss Sally	125	‘ Well , ’
236331	236336	236320	236321	Miss Sally	125	‘ what of that ? ’
236337	236344	236346	236347	the Notary	1334	‘ She is found , ma’am , ’
236359	236364	236346	236347	the Notary	1334	‘ She is found . ’
236365	236370	236372	236372	Sarah	125	‘ Who found her ? ’
236375	236397	236372	236372	Sarah	125	‘ We did , ma’am -- we three . Only last night , or you would have heard from us before . ’
236398	236407	236409	236410	Miss Brass	125	‘ And now I have heard from you , ’
236427	236505	236506	236506	she	125	‘ what have you got to say ? Something you have got into your heads about her , of course . Prove it , will you -- that ’s all . Prove it . You have found her , you say . I can tell you ( if you do n’t know it ) that you have found the most artful , lying , pilfering , devilish little minx that was ever born.--Have you got her here ? ’
236513	236523	236525	236526	the Notary	1334	‘ No , she is not here at present , ’
236528	236535	236525	236526	the Notary	1334	‘ But she is quite safe . ’
236536	236539	236541	236541	Sally	125	‘ Ha ! ’
236572	236586	236557	236557	she	125	‘ she shall be safe enough from this time , I warrant you . ’
236587	236592	236594	236595	the Notary	1334	‘ I hope so , ’
236597	236626	236594	236595	the Notary	1334	‘ Did it occur to you for the first time , when you found she had run away , that there were two keys to your kitchen door ? ’
236665	236669	236671	236672	the Notary	1334	‘ Two keys , ’
236674	236793	236671	236672	the Notary	1334	‘ one of which gave her the opportunities of roaming through the house at nights when you supposed her fast locked up , and of overhearing confidential consultations -- among others , that particular conference , to be described to - day before a justice , which you will have an opportunity of hearing her relate ; that conference which you and Mr Brass held together , on the night before that most unfortunate and innocent young man was accused of robbery , by a horrible device of which I will only say that it may be characterised by the epithets which you have applied to this wretched little witness , and by a few stronger ones besides . ’
236842	236850	236852	236853	the Notary	1334	‘ Come , come , Miss Brass , ’
236855	237137	237139	237140	Mr Witherden	137	‘ you have great command of feature , but you feel , I see , that by a chance which never entered your imagination , this base design is revealed , and two of its plotters must be brought to justice . Now , you know the pains and penalties you are liable to , and so I need not dilate upon them , but I have a proposal to make to you . You have the honour of being sister to one of the greatest scoundrels unhung ; and , if I may venture to say so to a lady , you are in every respect quite worthy of him . But connected with you two is a third party , a villain of the name of Quilp , the prime mover of the whole diabolical device , who I believe to be worse than either . For his sake , Miss Brass , do us the favour to reveal the whole history of this affair . Let me remind you that your doing so , at our instance , will place you in a safe and comfortable position -- your present one is not desirable -- and can not injure your brother ; for against him and you we have quite sufficient evidence ( as you hear ) already . I will not say to you that we suggest this course in mercy ( for , to tell you the truth , we do not entertain any regard for you ) , but it is a necessity to which we are reduced , and I recommend it to you as a matter of the very best policy . Time , ’
237147	237170	237144	237144	his	137	‘ in a business like this , is exceedingly precious . Favour us with your decision as speedily as possible , ma’am . ’

Gentlemen , if I could express the pleasure it gives me to see three such men in a happy unity of feeling and concord of sentiment , I think you would hardly believe me . But though I am unfortunate -- nay , gentlemen , criminal , if we are to use harsh expressions in a company like this -- still , I have my feelings like other men . I have heard of a poet , who remarked that feelings were the common lot of all . If he could have been a pig , gentlemen , and have uttered that sentiment , he would still have been immortal . ’

But I am a falling house , and the rats ( if I may be allowed the expression in reference to a gentleman I respect and love beyond everything ) fly from me ! Gentlemen -- regarding your conversation just now , I happened to see my sister on her way here , and , wondering where she could be going to , and being -- may I venture to say?--naturally of a suspicious turn , followed her . Since then , I have been listening . ’
237739	237742	237785	237786	Mr Witherden	137	‘ If you ’re

237767	237774	237762	237762	Sarah	125	’ rejoined Brass with undiminished politeness , ‘
237858	237872	237878	237878	I	0	’ cried Brass , seeing that the Notary was about to interrupt him , ‘
237881	237892	237878	237878	I	0	’ Mr Witherden was silent , and Brass went on . ‘
237901	237919	237894	237894	you	5863	’ he said , holding up the green shade , and revealing an eye most horribly discoloured , ‘
237987	238000	237985	237985	Gentlemen	501	’ said Brass , striking the hat fiercely with his clenched hand , ‘
238010	238023	238024	238024	I	0	’ The three gentlemen looked at each other , but said nothing . ‘
238027	238061	238024	238024	I	0	’ pursued Brass , glancing aside at his sister , as though he were talking for her information , and speaking with a snarling malignity , in violent contrast to his usual smoothness , ‘
238222	238251	238259	238259	you	5432	’ said Brass , picking up his hat again and replacing the shade over his eye , and actually crouching down , in the excess of his servility , ‘
238275	238300	238267	238267	you	5432	’ Nobody spoke . Brass stood smirking for a little while , as if he had propounded some choice conundrum ; and then said : ‘
238370	238436	238542	238542	You	501	’re not always over and above glad to see it -- I had better turn upon this man than let this man turn upon me . It ’s clear to me that I am done for . Therefore , if anybody is to split , I had better be the person and have the advantage of it . Sarah , my dear , comparatively speaking you ’re
238448	238504	238439	238439	I	0	’ With that , Mr Brass , in a great hurry , revealed the whole story ; bearing as heavily as possible on his amiable employer , and making himself out to be rather a saint - like and holy character , though subject -- he acknowledged -- to human weaknesses . He concluded thus : ‘
238688	238721	238673	238673	He	84	’ Having now arrived at the conclusion of his discourse , Sampson checked the current of his wrath , kissed his glove again , and smiled as only parasites and cowards can . ‘
238725	238757	238673	238673	He	84	’ said Miss Brass , raising her head , with which she had hitherto sat resting on her hands , and surveying him from head to foot with a bitter sneer , ‘
238791	238792	238793	238793	Sarah	125	’ ‘
238798	238807	238808	238808	you	125	’ returned Sampson , rubbing his hands feebly ; ‘
238832	238833	238830	238830	yourself	125	’ ‘
238840	238846	238836	238836	you	125	’ retorted the lovely damsel , ‘
238893	238894	238896	238896	he	5451	’ ‘
238898	238935	238896	238896	he	5451	’ simpered Brass , who , in his deep debasement , really seemed to have changed sexes with his sister , and to have made over to her any spark of manliness he might have possessed . ‘
239042	239053	239060	239060	mine	0	’ added Brass , allowing himself to be slightly overcome , ‘
239073	239451	239452	239452	Gentlemen	501	’ With deference to the better opinion of Mr Brass , and more particularly to the authority of his Great Ancestor , it may be doubted , with humility , whether the elevating principle laid down by the latter gentleman , and acted upon by his descendant , is always a prudent one , or attended in practice with the desired results . This is , beyond question , a bold and presumptuous doubt , inasmuch as many distinguished characters , called men of the world , long - headed customers , knowing dogs , shrewd fellows , capital hands at business , and the like , have made , and do daily make , this axiom their polar star and compass . Still , the doubt may be gently insinuated . And in illustration it may be observed , that if Mr Brass , not being over - suspicious , had , without prying and listening , left his sister to manage the conference on their joint behalf , or prying and listening , had not been in such a mighty hurry to anticipate her ( which he would not have been , but for his distrust and jealousy ) , he would probably have found himself much better off in the end . Thus , it will always happen that these men of the world , who go through it in armour , defend themselves from quite as much good as evil ; to say nothing of the inconvenience and absurdity of mounting guard with a microscope at all times , and of wearing a coat of mail on the most innocent occasions . The three gentlemen spoke together apart , for a few moments . At the end of their consultation , which was very brief , the Notary pointed to the writing materials on the table , and informed Mr Brass that if he wished to make any statement in writing , he had the opportunity of doing so . At the same time he felt bound to tell him that they would require his attendance , presently , before a justice of the peace , and that in what he did or said , he was guided entirely by his own discretion . ‘
239454	239473	239452	239452	Gentlemen	501	’ said Brass , drawing off his glove , and crawling in spirit upon the ground before them , ‘
239584	239595	239580	239580	I	0	’ said Brass , looking round with a mournful smile , ‘
239630	240179	239628	239628	me	0	’ Mr Brass found himself so exceedingly affected , at this point , that he could say or do nothing more until some refreshment arrived . Having partaken of it , pretty freely for one in his agitated state , he sat down to write . The lovely Sarah , now with her arms folded , and now with her hands clasped behind her , paced the room with manly strides while her brother was thus employed , and sometimes stopped to pull out her snuff - box and bite the lid . She continued to pace up and down until she was quite tired , and then fell asleep on a chair near the door . It has been since supposed , with some reason , that this slumber was a sham or feint , as she contrived to slip away unobserved in the dusk of the afternoon . Whether this was an intentional and waking departure , or a somnambulistic leave - taking and walking in her sleep , may remain a subject of contention ; but , on one point ( and indeed the main one ) all parties are agreed . In whatever state she walked away , she certainly did not walk back again . Mention having been made of the dusk of the afternoon , it will be inferred that Mr Brass ’s task occupied some time in the completion . It was not finished until evening ; but , being done at last , that worthy person and the three friends adjourned in a hackney - coach to the private office of a justice , who , giving Mr Brass a warm reception and detaining him in a secure place that he might insure to himself the pleasure of seeing him on the morrow , dismissed the others with the cheering assurance that a warrant could not fail to be granted next day for the apprehension of Mr Quilp , and that a proper application and statement of all the circumstances to the secretary of state ( who was fortunately in town ) , would no doubt procure Kit ’s free pardon and liberation without delay . And now , indeed , it seemed that Quilp ’s malignant career was drawing to a close , and that retribution , which often travels slowly -- especially when heaviest -- had tracked his footsteps with a sure and certain scent and was gaining on him fast . Unmindful of her stealthy tread , her victim holds his course in fancied triumph . Still at his heels she comes , and once afoot , is never turned aside ! Their business ended , the three gentlemen hastened back to the lodgings of Mr Swiveller , whom they found progressing so favourably in his recovery as to have been able to sit up for half an hour , and to have conversed with cheerfulness . Mrs Garland had gone home some time since , but Mr Abel was still sitting with him . After telling him all they had done , the two Mr Garlands and the single gentleman , as if by some previous understanding , took their leaves for the night , leaving the invalid alone with the Notary and the small servant . ‘
240187	240198	240181	240181	you	5463	’ said Mr Witherden , sitting down at the bedside , ‘
240217	240278	240281	240281	sir	5863	’ The idea of any professional intelligence from a gentleman connected with legal matters , appeared to afford Richard any - thing but a pleasing anticipation . Perhaps he connected it in his own mind with one or two outstanding accounts , in reference to which he had already received divers threatening letters . His countenance fell as he replied , ‘
240297	240298	240283	240283	I	0	’ ‘
240315	240320	240305	240305	I	0	’ replied the Notary . ‘

240523	240532	240533	240533	you	5863	’ said Dick , sobbing and laughing together , ‘
240576	241002	240568	240568	I	0	’ CHAPTER 67 Unconscious of the proceedings faithfully narrated in the last chapter , and little dreaming of the mine which had been sprung beneath him ( for , to the end that he should have no warning of the business a - foot , the profoundest secrecy was observed in the whole transaction ) , Mr Quilp remained shut up in his hermitage , undisturbed by any suspicion , and extremely well satisfied with the result of his machinations . Being engaged in the adjustment of some accounts -- an occupation to which the silence and solitude of his retreat were very favourable -- he had not strayed from his den for two whole days . The third day of his devotion to this pursuit found him still hard at work , and little disposed to stir abroad . It was the day next after Mr Brass ’s confession , and consequently , that which threatened the restriction of Mr Quilp ’s liberty , and the abrupt communication to him of some very unpleasant and unwelcome facts . Having no intuitive perception of the cloud which lowered upon his house , the dwarf was in his ordinary state of cheerfulness ; and , when he found he was becoming too much engrossed by business with a due regard to his health and spirits , he varied its monotonous routine with a little screeching , or howling , or some other innocent relaxation of that nature . He was attended , as usual , by Tom Scott , who sat crouching over the fire after the manner of a toad , and , from time to time , when his master ’s back was turned , imitating his grimaces with a fearful exactness . The figure - head had not yet disappeared , but remained in its old place . The face , horribly seared by the frequent application of the red - hot poker , and further ornamented by the insertion , in the tip of the nose , of a tenpenny nail , yet smiled blandly in its less lacerated parts , and seemed , like a sturdy martyr , to provoke its tormentor to the commission of new outrages and insults . The day , in the highest and brightest quarters of the town , was damp , dark , cold and gloomy . In that low and marshy spot , the fog filled every nook and corner with a thick dense cloud . Every object was obscure at one or two yards ’

Drowning men come to the surface three times they say . Ah ! To see him those three times , and mock him as his face came bobbing up,--oh , what a rich treat that would be ! ’

If I could only fold you in my arms , and squeeze your ribs , as I COULD squeeze them if I once had you tight -- what a meeting there would be between us ! If we ever do cross each other again , Sampson , we ’ll have a greeting not easily to be forgotten , trust me . This time , Sampson , this moment when all had gone on so well , was so nicely chosen !

It should have stopped beating , that night , if I had been in his secret , or there are no drugs to lull a man to sleep , or no fire to burn him ! ’

I hate you , my darling fellow , with good cause , and proud as you are to - night , I ’ll have my turn.----What ’s that ? ’

243942	244112	243936	243936	Sally	125	’ As he spoke , he extinguished the candle . In his impetuous attempts to subdue the brightness of the fire , he overset the stove , which came tumbling forward , and fell with a crash upon the burning embers it had shot forth in its descent , leaving the room in pitchy darkness . The noise at the gate still continuing , he felt his way to the door , and stepped into the open air . At that moment the knocking ceased . It was about eight o’clock ; but the dead of the darkest night would have been as noon - day in comparison with the thick cloud which then rested upon the earth , and shrouded everything from view . He darted forward for a few paces , as if into the mouth of some dim , yawning cavern ; then , thinking he had gone wrong , changed the direction of his steps ; then stood still , not knowing where to turn . ‘
244119	244135	244114	244114	they	5528	’ said Quilp , trying to peer into the gloom by which he was surrounded , ‘
244150	244217	244114	244114	they	5528	’ He stood listening intently , but the noise was not renewed . Nothing was to be heard in that deserted place , but , at intervals , the distant barkings of dogs . The sound was far away -- now in one quarter , now answered in another -- nor was it any guide , for it often came from shipboard , as he knew . ‘
244227	244242	244243	244243	I	0	’ said the dwarf , stretching out his arms , and walking slowly on , ‘
244288	246002	246052	246052	him	75	’ As the word passed his lips , he staggered and fell -- and next moment was fighting with the cold dark water ! For all its bubbling up and rushing in his ears , he could hear the knocking at the gate again -- could hear a shout that followed it -- could recognise the voice . For all his struggling and plashing , he could understand that they had lost their way , and had wandered back to the point from which they started ; that they were all but looking on , while he was drowned ; that they were close at hand , but could not make an effort to save him ; that he himself had shut and barred them out . He answered the shout -- with a yell , which seemed to make the hundred fires that danced before his eyes tremble and flicker , as if a gust of wind had stirred them . It was of no avail . The strong tide filled his throat , and bore him on , upon its rapid current . Another mortal struggle , and he was up again , beating the water with his hands , and looking out , with wild and glaring eyes that showed him some black object he was drifting close upon . The hull of a ship ! He could touch its smooth and slippery surface with his hand . One loud cry , now -- but the resistless water bore him down before he could give it utterance , and , driving him under it , carried away a corpse . It toyed and sported with its ghastly freight , now bruising it against the slimy piles , now hiding it in mud or long rank grass , now dragging it heavily over rough stones and gravel , now feigning to yield it to its own element , and in the same action luring it away , until , tired of the ugly plaything , it flung it on a swamp -- a dismal place where pirates had swung in chains through many a wintry night -- and left it there to bleach . And there it lay alone . The sky was red with flame , and the water that bore it there had been tinged with the sullen light as it flowed along . The place the deserted carcass had left so recently , a living man , was now a blazing ruin . There was something of the glare upon its face . The hair , stirred by the damp breeze , played in a kind of mockery of death -- such a mockery as the dead man himself would have delighted in when alive -- about its head , and its dress fluttered idly in the night wind . CHAPTER 68 Lighted rooms , bright fires , cheerful faces , the music of glad voices , words of love and welcome , warm hearts , and tears of happiness -- what a change is this ! But it is to such delights that Kit is hastening . They are awaiting him , he knows . He fears he will die of joy , before he gets among them . They have prepared him for this , all day . He is not to be carried off to - morrow with the rest , they tell him first . By degrees they let him know that doubts have arisen , that inquiries are to be made , and perhaps he may be pardoned after all . At last , the evening being come , they bring him to a room where some gentlemen are assembled . Foremost among them is his good old master , who comes and takes him by the hand . He hears that his innocence is established , and that he is pardoned . He can not see the speaker , but he turns towards the voice , and in trying to answer , falls down insensible . They recover him again , and tell him he must be composed , and bear this like a man . Somebody says he must think of his poor mother . It is because he does think of her so much , that the happy news had overpowered him . They crowd about him , and tell him that the truth has gone abroad , and that all the town and country ring with sympathy for his misfortunes . He has no ears for this . His thoughts , as yet , have no wider range than home . Does she know it ? what did she say ? who told her ? He can speak of nothing else . They make him drink a little wine , and talk kindly to him for a while , until he is more collected , and can listen , and thank them . He is free to go . Mr Garland thinks , if he feels better , it is time they went away . The gentlemen cluster round him , and shake hands with him . He feels very grateful to them for the interest they have in him , and for the kind promises they make ; but the power of speech is gone again , and he has much ado to keep his feet , even though leaning on his master ’s arm . As they come through the dismal passages , some officers of the jail who are in waiting there , congratulate him , in their rough way , on his release . The newsmonger is of the number , but his manner is not quite hearty -- there is something of surliness in his compliments . He looks upon Kit as an intruder , as one who has obtained admission to that place on false pretences , who has enjoyed a privilege without being duly qualified . He may be a very good sort of young man , he thinks , but he has no business there , and the sooner he is gone , the better . The last door shuts behind them . They have passed the outer wall , and stand in the open air -- in the street he has so often pictured to himself when hemmed in by the gloomy stones , and which has been in all his dreams . It seems wider and more busy than it used to be . The night is bad , and yet how cheerful and gay in his eyes ! One of the gentlemen , in taking leave of him , pressed some money into his hand . He has not counted it ; but when they have gone a few paces beyond the box for poor Prisoners , he hastily returns and drops it in . Mr Garland has a coach waiting in a neighbouring street , and , taking Kit inside with him , bids the man drive home . At first , they can only travel at a foot pace , and then with torches going on before , because of the heavy fog . But , as they get farther from the river , and leave the closer portions of the town behind , they are able to dispense with this precaution and to proceed at a brisker rate . On the road , hard galloping would be too slow for Kit ; but , when they are drawing near their journey ’s end , he begs they may go more slowly , and , when the house appears in sight , that they may stop -- only for a minute or two , to give him time to breathe . But there is no stopping then , for the old gentleman speaks stoutly to him , the horses mend their pace , and they are already at the garden - gate . Next minute , they are at the door . There is a noise of tongues , and tread of feet , inside . It opens . Kit rushes in , and finds his mother clinging round his neck . And there , too , is the ever faithful Barbara ’s mother , still holding the baby as if she had never put it down since that sad day when they little hoped to have such joy as this -- there she is , Heaven bless her , crying her eyes out , and sobbing as never woman sobbed before ; and there is little Barbara -- poor little Barbara , so much thinner and so much paler , and yet so very pretty -- trembling like a leaf and supporting herself against the wall ; and there is Mrs Garland , neater and nicer than ever , fainting away stone dead with nobody to help her ; and there is Mr Abel , violently blowing his nose , and wanting to embrace everybody ; and there is the single gentleman hovering round them all , and constant to nothing for an instant ; and there is that good , dear , thoughtful little Jacob , sitting all alone by himself on the bottom stair , with his hands on his knees like an old man , roaring fearfully without giving any trouble to anybody ; and each and all of them are for the time clean out of their wits , and do jointly and severally commit all manner of follies . And even when the rest have in some measure come to themselves again , and can find words and smiles , Barbara -- that soft - hearted , gentle , foolish little Barbara -- is suddenly missed , and found to be in a swoon by herself in the back parlour , from which swoon she falls into hysterics , and from which hysterics into a swoon again , and is , indeed , so bad , that despite a mortal quantity of vinegar and cold water she is hardly a bit better at last than she was at first . Then , Kit ’s mother comes in and says , will he come and speak to her ; and Kit says ‘
246005	246016	246017	246017	Barbara	170	’ and goes ; and he says in a kind voice ‘
246019	246027	246017	246017	Barbara	170	’ and Barbara ’s mother tells her that ‘
246033	246046	246031	246031	Kit	75	’ and Barbara says ( with her eyes closed all the time ) ‘
246055	246061	246052	246052	him	75	’ and Barbara ’s mother says ‘
246078	246168	246169	246169	she	5531	’ And in further assurance that he ’s safe and sound , Kit speaks to her again ; and then Barbara goes off into another fit of laughter , and then into another fit of crying ; and then Barbara ’s mother and Kit ’s mother nod to each other and pretend to scold her -- but only to bring her to herself the faster , bless you!--and being experienced matrons , and acute at perceiving the first dawning symptoms of recovery , they comfort Kit with the assurance that ‘
246174	246783	246169	246169	she	5531	’ and so dismiss him to the place from whence he came . Well ! In that place ( which is the next room ) there are decanters of wine , and all that sort of thing , set out as grand as if Kit and his friends were first - rate company ; and there is little Jacob , walking , as the popular phrase is , into a home - made plum - cake , at a most surprising pace , and keeping his eye on the figs and oranges which are to follow , and making the best use of his time , you may believe . Kit no sooner comes in , than that single gentleman ( never was such a busy gentleman ) charges all the glasses -- bumpers -- and drinks his health , and tells him he shall never want a friend while he lives ; and so does Mr Garland , and so does Mrs Garland , and so does Mr Abel . But even this honour and distinction is not all , for the single gentleman forthwith pulls out of his pocket a massive silver watch -- going hard , and right to half a second -- and upon the back of this watch is engraved Kit ’s name , with flourishes all over ; and in short it is Kit ’s watch , bought expressly for him , and presented to him on the spot . You may rest assured that Mr and Mrs Garland ca n’t help hinting about their present , in store , and that Mr Abel tells outright that he has his ; and that Kit is the happiest of the happy . There is one friend he has not seen yet , and as he can not be conveniently introduced into the family circle , by reason of his being an iron - shod quadruped , Kit takes the first opportunity of slipping away and hurrying to the stable . The moment he lays his hand upon the latch , the pony neighs the loudest pony ’s greeting ; before he has crossed the threshold , the pony is capering about his loose box ( for he brooks not the indignity of a halter ) , mad to give him welcome ; and when Kit goes up to caress and pat him , the pony rubs his nose against his coat , and fondles him more lovingly than ever pony fondled man . It is the crowning circumstance of his earnest , heartfelt reception ; and Kit fairly puts his arm round Whisker ’s neck and hugs him . But how comes Barbara to trip in there ? and how smart she is again ! she has been at her glass since she recovered . How comes Barbara in the stable , of all places in the world ? Why , since Kit has been away , the pony would take his food from nobody but her , and Barbara , you see , not dreaming that Christopher was there , and just looking in , to see that everything was right , has come upon him unawares . Blushing little Barbara ! It may be that Kit has caressed the pony enough ; it may be that there are even better things to caress than ponies . He leaves him for Barbara at any rate , and hopes she is better . Yes . Barbara is a great deal better . She is afraid -- and here Barbara looks down and blushes more -- that he must have thought her very foolish . ‘
246788	246845	246846	246846	We	5532	’ says Kit . Barbara is glad of that , and coughs -- Hem!--just the slightest cough possible -- not more than that . What a discreet pony when he chooses ! He is as quiet now as if he were of marble . He has a very knowing look , but that he always has . ‘
246857	247004	246855	246855	Barbara	170	’ says Kit . Barbara gives him hers . Why , she is trembling now ! Foolish , fluttering Barbara ! Arm ’s length ? The length of an arm is not much . Barbara ’s was not a long arm , by any means , and besides , she did n’t hold it out straight , but bent a little . Kit was so near her when they shook hands , that he could see a small tiny tear , yet trembling on an eyelash . It was natural that he should look at it , unknown to Barbara . It was natural that Barbara should raise her eyes unconsciously , and find him out . Was it natural that at that instant , without any previous impulse or design , Kit should kiss Barbara ? He did it , whether or no . Barbara said ‘
247008	247220	246855	246855	Barbara	170	’ but let him do it too -- twice . He might have done it thrice , but the pony kicked up his heels and shook his head , as if he were suddenly taken with convulsions of delight , and Barbara being frightened , ran away -- not straight to where her mother and Kit ’s mother were , though , lest they should see how red her cheeks were , and should ask her why . Sly little Barbara ! When the first transports of the whole party had subsided , and Kit and his mother , and Barbara and her mother , with little Jacob and the baby to boot , had had their suppers together -- which there was no hurrying over , for they were going to stop there all night -- Mr Garland called Kit to him , and taking him into a room where they could be alone , told him that he had something yet to say , which would surprise him greatly . Kit looked so anxious and turned so pale on hearing this , that the old gentleman hastened to add , he would be agreeably surprised ; and asked him if he would be ready next morning for a journey . ‘
247227	247231	247225	247225	sir	5863	’ cried Kit . ‘
247250	247261	247245	247245	you	5863	’ Kit turned paler yet , and shook his head . ‘
247271	247276	247265	247265	I	0	’ said his master . ‘
247279	247294	247295	247296	Miss Nell	72	’ Kit murmured something rather rambling and unintelligible , but he plainly pronounced the words ‘
247298	247332	247295	247296	Miss Nell	72	’ three or four times -- shaking his head while he did so , as if he would add that there was no hope of that . But Mr Garland , instead of saying ‘
247336	247356	247295	247296	Miss Nell	72	’ as Kit had made sure he would , told him very seriously , that he had guessed right . ‘
247366	247370	247295	247296	Miss Nell	72	’ he said , ‘
247382	247413	247415	247415	she	5539	’ Kit faltered out such questions as , where was it , and how had it been found , and how long since , and was she well and happy ? ‘
247422	247427	247415	247415	she	5539	’ said Mr Garland . ‘
247479	247942	247473	247473	you	5540	’ Scarcely venturing to draw his breath , Kit did as he was told . Mr Garland then related to him , how he had a brother ( of whom he would remember to have heard him speak , and whose picture , taken when he was a young man , hung in the best room ) , and how this brother lived a long way off , in a country - place , with an old clergyman who had been his early friend . How , although they loved each other as brothers should , they had not met for many years , but had communicated by letter from time to time , always looking forward to some period when they would take each other by the hand once more , and still letting the Present time steal on , as it was the habit for men to do , and suffering the Future to melt into the Past . How this brother , whose temper was very mild and quiet and retiring -- such as Mr Abel’s -- was greatly beloved by the simple people among whom he dwelt , who quite revered the Bachelor ( for so they called him ) , and had every one experienced his charity and benevolence . How even those slight circumstances had come to his knowledge , very slowly and in course of years , for the Bachelor was one of those whose goodness shuns the light , and who have more pleasure in discovering and extolling the good deeds of others , than in trumpeting their own , be they never so commendable . How , for that reason , he seldom told them of his village friends ; but how , for all that , his mind had become so full of two among them -- a child and an old man , to whom he had been very kind -- that , in a letter received a few days before , he had dwelt upon them from first to last , and had told such a tale of their wandering , and mutual love , that few could read it without being moved to tears . How he , the recipient of that letter , was directly led to the belief that these must be the very wanderers for whom so much search had been made , and whom Heaven had directed to his brother ’s care . How he had written for such further information as would put the fact beyond all doubt ; how it had that morning arrived ; had confirmed his first impression into a certainty ; and was the immediate cause of that journey being planned , which they were to take to - morrow . ‘
247947	247963	247473	247473	you	5540	’ said the old gentleman rising , and laying his hand on Kit ’s shoulder , ‘
247999	248511	248512	248512	You	5544	’ CHAPTER 69 Kit was no sluggard next morning , but , springing from his bed some time before day , began to prepare for his welcome expedition . The hurry of spirits consequent upon the events of yesterday , and the unexpected intelligence he had heard at night , had troubled his sleep through the long dark hours , and summoned such uneasy dreams about his pillow that it was best to rise . But , had it been the beginning of some great labour with the same end in view -- had it been the commencement of a long journey , to be performed on foot in that inclement season of the year , to be pursued under very privation and difficulty , and to be achieved only with great distress , fatigue , and suffering -- had it been the dawn of some painful enterprise , certain to task his utmost powers of resolution and endurance , and to need his utmost fortitude , but only likely to end , if happily achieved , in good fortune and delight to Nell -- Kit ’s cheerful zeal would have been as highly roused : Kit ’s ardour and impatience would have been , at least , the same . Nor was he alone excited and eager . Before he had been up a quarter of an hour the whole house were astir and busy . Everybody hurried to do something towards facilitating the preparations . The single gentleman , it is true , could do nothing himself , but he overlooked everybody else and was more locomotive than anybody . The work of packing and making ready went briskly on , and by daybreak every preparation for the journey was completed . Then Kit began to wish they had not been quite so nimble ; for the travelling - carriage which had been hired for the occasion was not to arrive until nine o’clock , and there was nothing but breakfast to fill up the intervening blank of one hour and a half . Yes there was , though . There was Barbara . Barbara was busy , to be sure , but so much the better -- Kit could help her , and that would pass away the time better than any means that could be devised . Barbara had no objection to this arrangement , and Kit , tracking out the idea which had come upon him so suddenly overnight , began to think that surely Barbara was fond of him , and surely he was fond of Barbara . Now , Barbara , if the truth must be told -- as it must and ought to be -- Barbara seemed , of all the little household , to take least pleasure in the bustle of the occasion ; and when Kit , in the openness of his heart , told her how glad and overjoyed it made him , Barbara became more downcast still , and seemed to have even less pleasure in it than before ! ‘
248522	248559	248520	248520	Christopher	75	’ said Barbara -- and it is impossible to tell how carelessly she said it--‘You have not been home so long , that you need to be glad to go away again , I should think . ’
248560	248567	248569	248569	Kit	75	‘ But for such a purpose , ’
248571	248607	248608	248608	Barbara	170	‘ To bring back Miss Nell ! To see her again ! Only think of that ! I am so pleased too , to think that you will see her , Barbara , at last . ’
248658	248676	248678	248678	Kit	75	‘ You ’ll say she has the sweetest and beautifullest face you ever saw , I know , ’
248684	248686	248688	248688	you	170	‘ I ’m
248693	248700	248678	248678	Kit	75	’ Barbara tossed her head again . ‘
248708	248712	248706	248706	Barbara	170	’ said Kit . ‘
248715	248807	248808	248808	Barbara	170	’ cried Barbara . And Barbara pouted -- not sulkily , or in an ugly manner , but just enough to make her look more cherry - lipped than ever . There is no school in which a pupil gets on so fast , as that in which Kit became a scholar when he gave Barbara the kiss . He saw what Barbara meant now -- he had his lesson by heart all at once -- she was the book -- there it was before him , as plain as print . ‘
248810	248814	248815	248815	you	170	’ said Kit , ‘
248816	248822	248866	248866	Kit	75	’re not cross with me ? ’
248858	248864	248866	248866	Kit	75	‘ Why , I do , ’
248868	248874	248866	248866	Kit	75	‘ Of course I do . ’
248946	248952	248954	248954	Kit	75	‘ No , but Barbara , ’
248960	248998	248954	248954	Kit	75	‘ let us part friends . I was always thinking of you , in my troubles . I should have been a great deal more miserable than I was , if it had n’t been for you . ’
249021	249045	249047	249047	Kit	75	‘ I am telling you the truth , Barbara , upon my word , but not half so strong as I could wish , ’
249049	249119	249047	249047	Kit	75	‘ When I want you to be pleased to see Miss Nell , it ’s only because I like you to be pleased with what pleases me -- that ’s all . As to her , Barbara , I think I could almost die to do her service , but you would think so too , if you knew her as I do . I am sure you would . ’
249131	249140	249142	249142	Kit	75	‘ I have been used , you see , ’
249144	249437	249142	249142	Kit	75	‘ to talk and think of her , almost as if she was an angel . When I look forward to meeting her again , I think of her smiling as she used to do , and being glad to see me , and putting out her hand and saying , “ It ’s my own old Kit , ” or some such words as those -- like what she used to say . I think of seeing her happy , and with friends about her , and brought up as she deserves , and as she ought to be . When I think of myself , it ’s as her old servant , and one that loved her dearly , as his kind , good , gentle mistress ; and who would have gone -- yes , and still would go -- through any harm to serve her . Once , I could n’t help being afraid that if she came back with friends about her she might forget , or be ashamed of having known , a humble lad like me , and so might speak coldly , which would have cut me , Barbara , deeper than I can tell . But when I came to think again , I felt sure that I was doing her wrong in this ; and so I went on , as I did at first , hoping to see her once more , just as she used to be . Hoping this , and remembering what she was , has made me feel as if I would always try to please her , and always be what I should like to seem to her if I was still her servant . If I ’m
249449	249485	249444	249444	I	0	’m the worse -- I am grateful to her for it , and love and honour her the more . That ’s the plain honest truth , dear Barbara , upon my word it is ! ’
249644	249655	249656	249656	he	139	‘ Snobby ’s in this , I see , Sir ? ’
249663	249689	249656	249656	he	139	‘ I thought he was n’t in the last trip because it was expected that his presence would n’t be acceptable to the ancient buffalo . ’
249690	249696	249698	249699	Mr Abel	138	‘ To whom , Sir ? ’
249701	249707	249709	249710	Mr Chuckster	139	‘ To the old gentleman , ’
249715	249724	249726	249727	Mr Abel	138	‘ Our client prefers to take him now , ’
249731	249774	249726	249727	Mr Abel	138	‘ There is no longer any need for that precaution , as my father ’s relationship to a gentleman in whom the objects of his search have full confidence , will be a sufficient guarantee for the friendly nature of their errand . ’
249775	249778	249780	249781	Mr Chuckster	139	‘ Ah ! ’
249788	249847	249780	249781	Mr Chuckster	139	‘ anybody but me ! Snobby before me , of course . He did n’t happen to take that particular five - pound note , but I have not the smallest doubt that he ’s always up to something of that sort . I always said it , long before this came out . Devilish pretty girl that ! ‘
249857	250140	249852	249855	an amazing little creature	5554	’ Barbara was the subject of Mr Chuckster ’s commendations ; and as she was lingering near the carriage ( all being now ready for its departure ) , that gentleman was suddenly seized with a strong interest in the proceedings , which impelled him to swagger down the garden , and take up his position at a convenient ogling distance . Having had great experience of the sex , and being perfectly acquainted with all those little artifices which find the readiest road to their hearts , Mr Chuckster , on taking his ground , planted one hand on his hip , and with the other adjusted his flowing hair . This is a favourite attitude in the polite circles , and , accompanied with a graceful whistling , has been known to do immense execution . Such , however , is the difference between town and country , that nobody took the smallest notice of this insinuating figure ; the wretches being wholly engaged in bidding the travellers farewell , in kissing hands to each other , waving handkerchiefs , and the like tame and vulgar practices . For now the single gentleman and Mr Garland were in the carriage , and the post - boy was in the saddle , and Kit , well wrapped and muffled up , was in the rumble behind ; and Mrs Garland was there , and Mr Abel was there , and Kit ’s mother was there , and little Jacob was there , and Barbara ’s mother was visible in remote perspective , nursing the ever - wakeful baby ; and all were nodding , beckoning , curtseying , or crying out , ‘
250144	250644	249726	249727	Mr Abel	138	’ with all the energy they could express . In another minute , the carriage was out of sight ; and Mr Chuckster remained alone on the spot where it had lately been , with a vision of Kit standing up in the rumble waving his hand to Barbara , and of Barbara in the full light and lustre of his eyes -- his eyes -- Chuckster’s -- Chuckster the successful -- on whom ladies of quality had looked with favour from phaetons in the parks on Sundays -- waving hers to Kit ! How Mr Chuckster , entranced by this monstrous fact , stood for some time rooted to the earth , protesting within himself that Kit was the Prince of felonious characters , and very Emperor or Great Mogul of Snobs , and how he clearly traced this revolting circumstance back to that old villany of the shilling , are matters foreign to our purpose ; which is to track the rolling wheels , and bear the travellers company on their cold , bleak journey . It was a bitter day . A keen wind was blowing , and rushed against them fiercely : bleaching the hard ground , shaking the white frost from the trees and hedges , and whirling it away like dust . But little cared Kit for weather . There was a freedom and freshness in the wind , as it came howling by , which , let it cut never so sharp , was welcome . As it swept on with its cloud of frost , bearing down the dry twigs and boughs and withered leaves , and carrying them away pell - mell , it seemed as though some general sympathy had got abroad , and everything was in a hurry , like themselves . The harder the gusts , the better progress they appeared to make . It was a good thing to go struggling and fighting forward , vanquishing them one by one ; to watch them driving up , gathering strength and fury as they came along ; to bend for a moment , as they whistled past ; and then to look back and see them speed away , their hoarse noise dying in the distance , and the stout trees cowering down before them . All day long , it blew without cessation . The night was clear and starlit , but the wind had not fallen , and the cold was piercing . Sometimes -- towards the end of a long stage -- Kit could not help wishing it were a little warmer : but when they stopped to change horses , and he had had a good run , and what with that , and the bustle of paying the old postilion , and rousing the new one , and running to and fro again until the horses were put to , he was so warm that the blood tingled and smarted in his fingers ’

250850	250859	250861	250862	Mr Garland	138	‘ Like most other men , I suppose , ’
250866	250894	250861	250862	Mr Garland	138	‘ I can be , if I am interested ; and if not interested , I should still try to appear so . Why do you ask ? ’
250895	250905	250929	250929	he	5561	‘ I have a short narrative on my lips , ’
250910	250923	250929	250929	he	5561	‘ and will try you with it . It is very brief . ’
250944	251017	250929	250929	he	5561	‘ There were once two brothers , who loved each other dearly . There was a disparity in their ages -- some twelve years . I am not sure but they may insensibly have loved each other the better for that reason . Wide as the interval between them was , however , they became rivals too soon . The deepest and strongest affection of both their hearts settled upon one object . ‘
251259	251281	251249	251249	he	5572	‘ The elder brother married her . She was in Heaven before long , and left him with an infant daughter . ‘
251361	251458	251324	251324	you	5577	‘ In this daughter the mother lived again . You may judge with what devotion he who lost that mother almost in the winning , clung to this girl , her breathing image . She grew to womanhood , and gave her heart to one who could not know its worth . Well ! Her fond father could not see her pine and droop . He might be more deserving than he thought him . He surely might become so , with a wife like her . He joined their hands , and they were married . ‘

251740	251827	251858	251858	her	5594	‘ The boy grew like his father in mind and person ; the girl so like her mother , that when the old man had her on his knee , and looked into her mild blue eyes , he felt as if awakening from a wretched dream , and his daughter were a little child again . The wayward boy soon spurned the shelter of his roof , and sought associates more congenial to his taste . The old man and the child dwelt alone together . ‘
251988	252099	251970	251971	the child	324	‘ The younger brother had been a traveller in many countries , and had made his pilgrimage through life alone . His voluntary banishment had been misconstrued , and he had borne ( not without pain ) reproach and slight for doing that which had wrung his heart , and cast a mournful shadow on his path . Apart from this , communication between him and the elder was difficult , and uncertain , and often failed ; still , it was not so wholly broken off but that he learnt -- with long blanks and gaps between each interval of information -- all that I have told you now . ‘

252469	252770	252819	252819	Kit	75	’ CHAPTER 70 Day broke , and found them still upon their way . Since leaving home , they had halted here and there for necessary refreshment , and had frequently been delayed , especially in the night time , by waiting for fresh horses . They had made no other stoppages , but the weather continued rough , and the roads were often steep and heavy . It would be night again before they reached their place of destination . Kit , all bluff and hardened with the cold , went on manfully ; and , having enough to do to keep his blood circulating , to picture to himself the happy end of this adventurous journey , and to look about him and be amazed at everything , had little spare time for thinking of discomforts . Though his impatience , and that of his fellow - travellers , rapidly increased as the day waned , the hours did not stand still . The short daylight of winter soon faded away , and it was dark again when they had yet many miles to travel . As it grew dusk , the wind fell ; its distant moanings were more low and mournful ; and , as it came creeping up the road , and rattling covertly among the dry brambles on either hand , it seemed like some great phantom for whom the way was narrow , whose garments rustled as it stalked along . By degrees it lulled and died away , and then it came on to snow . The flakes fell fast and thick , soon covering the ground some inches deep , and spreading abroad a solemn stillness . The rolling wheels were noiseless , and the sharp ring and clatter of the horses ’

253971	253977	253955	253955	I	0	’ repeated the other peevishly . ‘
254055	254061	254049	254049	I	0	’ said the old man , ‘
254099	254100	254090	254090	I	0	’ ‘
254111	254115	254101	254101	I	0	’ said Kit , ‘

254160	254171	254154	254154	I	0	’ answered the old man , in a trembling voice , ‘
254210	254256	254207	254207	I	0	’ Kit thanked him , and made him a hasty answer in the negative ; he was turning back , when his attention was caught by the voice of a child . Looking up , he saw a very little creature at a neighbouring window . ‘
254261	254268	254207	254207	I	0	’ cried the child , earnestly . ‘
254288	254289	254290	254291	Poor boy	5676	’ ‘
254293	254303	254290	254291	Poor boy	5676	’ said the sexton , before Kit could answer , ‘
254310	254311	254308	254308	darling	6986	’ ‘
254318	254341	254308	254308	darling	6986	’ exclaimed the child again , in a voice so fervent that it might have thrilled to the heart of any listener . ‘
254361	254362	254365	254365	his	5675	’ ‘
254368	254373	254365	254365	his	5675	’ said the sexton . ‘
254381	254382	254365	254365	his	5675	’ ‘
254385	254396	254365	254365	his	5675	’ cried the child , in a burst of despair . ‘
254444	254445	254432	254432	I	0	’ ‘
254451	254459	254432	254432	I	0	’ said the old man , soothingly . ‘
254466	254467	254471	254471	I	0	’ ‘
254490	254495	254483	254483	I	0	’ rejoined the child . ‘
254519	254684	254508	254508	I	0	’ The old man blessed him , the child in tears replied Good night , and Kit was again alone . He hurried back , moved by what he had heard , though more by the child ’s manner than by anything he had said , as his meaning was hidden from him . They took the path indicated by the sexton , and soon arrived before the parsonage wall . Turning round to look about them when they had got thus far , they saw , among some ruined buildings at a distance , one single solitary light . It shone from what appeared to be an old oriel window , and being surrounded by the deep shadows of overhanging walls , sparkled like a star . Bright and glimmering as the stars above their heads , lonely and motionless as they , it seemed to claim some kindred with the eternal lamps of Heaven , and to burn in fellowship with them . ‘
254690	254696	254508	254508	I	0	’ said the younger brother . ‘
254701	254706	254508	254508	I	0	’ said Mr Garland , ‘
254721	254722	254723	254723	They	5680	’ ‘
254727	254733	254723	254723	They	5680	’ returned the brother hastily , ‘
254740	255652	255653	255653	Master	5881	’ Kit interposed directly , and begged that , while they rang and waited at the gate , they would let him make his way to where this light was shining , and try to ascertain if any people were about . Obtaining the permission he desired , he darted off with breathless eagerness , and , still carrying the birdcage in his hand , made straight towards the spot . It was not easy to hold that pace among the graves , and at another time he might have gone more slowly , or round by the path . Unmindful of all obstacles , however , he pressed forward without slackening his speed , and soon arrived within a few yards of the window . He approached as softly as he could , and advancing so near the wall as to brush the whitened ivy with his dress , listened . There was no sound inside . The church itself was not more quiet . Touching the glass with his cheek , he listened again . No . And yet there was such a silence all around , that he felt sure he could have heard even the breathing of a sleeper , if there had been one there . A strange circumstance , a light in such a place at that time of night , with no one near it . A curtain was drawn across the lower portion of the window , and he could not see into the room . But there was no shadow thrown upon it from within . To have gained a footing on the wall and tried to look in from above , would have been attended with some danger -- certainly with some noise , and the chance of terrifying the child , if that really were her habitation . Again and again he listened ; again and again the same wearisome blank . Leaving the spot with slow and cautious steps , and skirting the ruin for a few paces , he came at length to a door . He knocked . No answer . But there was a curious noise inside . It was difficult to determine what it was . It bore a resemblance to the low moaning of one in pain , but it was not that , being far too regular and constant . Now it seemed a kind of song , now a wail -- seemed , that is , to his changing fancy , for the sound itself was never changed or checked . It was unlike anything he had ever heard ; and in its tone there was something fearful , chilling , and unearthly . The listener ’s blood ran colder now than ever it had done in frost and snow , but he knocked again . There was no answer , and the sound went on without any interruption . He laid his hand softly upon the latch , and put his knee against the door . It was secured on the inside , but yielded to the pressure , and turned upon its hinges . He saw the glimmering of a fire upon the old walls , and entered . CHAPTER 71 The dull , red glow of a wood fire -- for no lamp or candle burnt within the room -- showed him a figure , seated on the hearth with its back towards him , bending over the fitful light . The attitude was that of one who sought the heat . It was , and yet was not . The stooping posture and the cowering form were there , but no hands were stretched out to meet the grateful warmth , no shrug or shiver compared its luxury with the piercing cold outside . With limbs huddled together , head bowed down , arms crossed upon the breast , and fingers tightly clenched , it rocked to and fro upon its seat without a moment ’s pause , accompanying the action with the mournful sound he had heard . The heavy door had closed behind him on his entrance , with a crash that made him start . The figure neither spoke , nor turned to look , nor gave in any other way the faintest sign of having heard the noise . The form was that of an old man , his white head akin in colour to the mouldering embers upon which he gazed . He , and the failing light and dying fire , the time - worn room , the solitude , the wasted life , and gloom , were all in fellowship . Ashes , and dust , and ruin ! Kit tried to speak , and did pronounce some words , though what they were he scarcely knew . Still the same terrible low cry went on -- still the same rocking in the chair -- the same stricken figure was there , unchanged and heedless of his presence . He had his hand upon the latch , when something in the form -- distinctly seen as one log broke and fell , and , as it fell , blazed up -- arrested it . He returned to where he had stood before -- advanced a pace -- another -- another still . Another , and he saw the face . Yes ! Changed as it was , he knew it well . ‘
255655	255669	255653	255653	Master	5881	’ he cried , stooping on one knee and catching at his hand . ‘
255677	255693	255653	255653	Master	5881	’ The old man turned slowly towards him ; and muttered in a hollow voice , ‘
255708	255709	255710	255711	No spirit	5683	’ ‘
255742	255743	255744	255744	They	5687	’ ‘
255749	255755	255756	255756	They	5687	’ cried the old man . ‘
255766	255767	255763	255764	A spirit	5688	’ ‘
255772	255776	255763	255764	A spirit	5688	’ demanded Kit . ‘
255787	255788	255789	255789	She	72	’ ‘
255798	255799	255789	255789	She	72	’ ‘
255803	255804	255801	255801	God	71	’ ‘
255810	255816	255821	255821	Him	5690	’ returned the old man . ‘
255849	255850	255846	255846	she	72	’ ‘
255856	255857	255858	255858	You	0	’ ‘
255877	255886	255867	255867	you	0	’ He started up , and listened again . ‘
255890	255899	255867	255867	you	0	’ he cried , with a triumphant smile , ‘
255915	255959	255960	255960	She	72	’ Motioning to him to be silent , he stole away into another chamber . After a short absence ( during which he could be heard to speak in a softened soothing tone ) he returned , bearing in his hand a lamp . ‘
255965	255969	255970	255970	You	0	’ he whispered . ‘
256050	256115	256045	256045	I	0	’ He spoke rather to himself than to the visitor , but when he had put the lamp upon the table , he took it up , as if impelled by some momentary recollection or curiosity , and held it near his face . Then , as if forgetting his motive in the very action , he turned away and put it down again . ‘
256121	256125	256116	256116	She	72	’ he said ; ‘
256192	256247	256186	256186	They	5695	’ Again he stopped to listen , and scarcely drawing breath , listened for a long , long time . That fancy past , he opened an old chest , took out some clothes as fondly as if they had been living things , and began to smooth and brush them with his hand . ‘
256259	256263	256250	256250	thou	5698	’ he murmured , ‘
256344	256359	256332	256332	she	72	’ Kit had no power to speak . His eyes were filled with tears . ‘
256366	256386	256387	256387	She	72	’ cried the old man , pressing it to his breast , and patting it with his shrivelled hand . ‘
256532	256568	256518	256518	she	72	’ He pressed them to his lips , and having carefully put them back again , went on communing with himself -- looking wistfully from time to time towards the chamber he had lately visited . ‘
256671	256869	256654	256654	we	5708	’ The door was indeed opened , for the entrance of Mr Garland and his friend , accompanied by two other persons . These were the schoolmaster , and the bachelor . The former held a light in his hand . He had , it seemed , but gone to his own cottage to replenish the exhausted lamp , at the moment when Kit came up and found the old man alone . He softened again at sight of these two friends , and , laying aside the angry manner -- if to anything so feeble and so sad the term can be applied -- in which he had spoken when the door opened , resumed his former seat , and subsided , by little and little into the old action , and the old , dull , wandering sound . Of the strangers , he took no heed whatever . He had seen them , but appeared quite incapable of interest or curiosity . The younger brother stood apart . The bachelor drew a chair towards the old man , and sat down close beside him . After a long silence , he ventured to speak . ‘
256878	256883	256654	256654	we	5708	’ he said softly ; ‘
256905	256906	256899	256899	you	0	’ ‘
256912	256918	256899	256899	you	0	’ returned the old man . ‘

256941	256946	256947	256947	You	0	’ said the bachelor . ‘

257023	257029	257240	257240	He	5711	’ faltered the old man . ‘
257045	257239	257240	257240	He	5711	’ They watched him as he rose and stole on tiptoe to the other chamber where the lamp had been replaced . They listened as he spoke again within its silent walls . They looked into the faces of each other , and no man ’s cheek was free from tears . He came back , whispering that she was still asleep , but that he thought she had moved . It was her hand , he said -- a little -- a very , very little -- but he was pretty sure she had moved it -- perhaps in seeking his . He had known her do that , before now , though in the deepest sleep the while . And when he had said this , he dropped into his chair again , and clasping his hands above his head , uttered a cry never to be forgotten . The poor schoolmaster motioned to the bachelor that he would come on the other side , and speak to him . They gently unlocked his fingers , which he had twisted in his grey hair , and pressed them in their own . ‘
257245	257250	257240	257240	He	5711	’ said the schoolmaster , ‘
257274	257275	257267	257267	She	5711	’ ‘

257555	257560	257546	257546	she	5711	’ said the schoolmaster . ‘
257569	257580	257561	257561	She	5711	’ cried the old man , looking steadfastly at him . ‘

257662	257667	257641	257641	her	5711	’ said the bachelor . ‘
257808	257809	257807	257807	you--	0	’ ‘
257821	257833	257807	257807	you--	0	’ cried the younger , falling on his knee before him ; ‘
257950	257974	257998	257998	Our	5724	’ The old man looked from face to face , and his lips moved ; but no sound came from them in reply . ‘
257982	257988	257998	257998	Our	5724	’ pursued the younger brother , ‘
258161	258169	258153	258156	children as at first	5735	’ he added in an altered voice , ‘
258217	258252	258253	258253	You	5736	’ By little and little , the old man had drawn back towards the inner chamber , while these words were spoken . He pointed there , as he replied , with trembling lips . ‘
258311	258494	258294	258294	She	5737	’ Waving them off with his hand , and calling softly to her as he went , he stole into the room . They who were left behind , drew close together , and after a few whispered words -- not unbroken by emotion , or easily uttered -- followed him . They moved so gently , that their footsteps made no noise ; but there were sobs from among the group , and sounds of grief and mourning . For she was dead . There , upon her little bed , she lay at rest . The solemn stillness was no marvel now . She was dead . No sleep so beautiful and calm , so free from trace of pain , so fair to look upon . She seemed a creature fresh from the hand of God , and waiting for the breath of life ; not one who had lived and suffered death . Her couch was dressed with here and there some winter berries and green leaves , gathered in a spot she had been used to favour . ‘
258517	258888	258294	258294	She	5737	’ Those were her words . She was dead . Dear , gentle , patient , noble Nell was dead . Her little bird -- a poor slight thing the pressure of a finger would have crushed -- was stirring nimbly in its cage ; and the strong heart of its child mistress was mute and motionless for ever . Where were the traces of her early cares , her sufferings , and fatigues ? All gone . Sorrow was dead indeed in her , but peace and perfect happiness were born ; imaged in her tranquil beauty and profound repose . And still her former self lay there , unaltered in this change . Yes . The old fireside had smiled upon that same sweet face ; it had passed , like a dream , through haunts of misery and care ; at the door of the poor schoolmaster on the summer evening , before the furnace fire upon the cold wet night , at the still bedside of the dying boy , there had been the same mild lovely look . So shall we know the angels in their majesty , after death . The old man held one languid arm in his , and had the small hand tight folded to his breast , for warmth . It was the hand she had stretched out to him with her last smile -- the hand that had led him on , through all their wanderings . Ever and anon he pressed it to his lips ; then hugged it to his breast again , murmuring that it was warmer now ; and , as he said it , he looked , in agony , to those who stood around , as if imploring them to help her . She was dead , and past all help , or need of it . The ancient rooms she had seemed to fill with life , even while her own was waning fast -- the garden she had tended -- the eyes she had gladdened -- the noiseless haunts of many a thoughtful hour -- the paths she had trodden as it were but yesterday -- could know her never more . ‘
258893	258916	258294	258294	She	5737	’ said the schoolmaster , as he bent down to kiss her on the cheek , and gave his tears free vent , ‘
258976	259107	259825	259825	God	71	’ CHAPTER 72 When morning came , and they could speak more calmly on the subject of their grief , they heard how her life had closed . She had been dead two days . They were all about her at the time , knowing that the end was drawing on . She died soon after daybreak . They had read and talked to her in the earlier portion of the night , but as the hours crept on , she sunk to sleep . They could tell , by what she faintly uttered in her dreams , that they were of her journeyings with the old man ; they were of no painful scenes , but of people who had helped and used them kindly , for she often said ‘
259112	259824	259825	259825	God	71	’ with great fervour . Waking , she never wandered in her mind but once , and that was of beautiful music which she said was in the air . God knows . It may have been . Opening her eyes at last , from a very quiet sleep , she begged that they would kiss her once again . That done , she turned to the old man with a lovely smile upon her face -- such , they said , as they had never seen , and never could forget -- and clung with both her arms about his neck . They did not know that she was dead , at first . She had spoken very often of the two sisters , who , she said , were like dear friends to her . She wished they could be told how much she thought about them , and how she had watched them as they walked together , by the river side at night . She would like to see poor Kit , she had often said of late . She wished there was somebody to take her love to Kit . And , even then , she never thought or spoke about him , but with something of her old , clear , merry laugh . For the rest , she had never murmured or complained ; but with a quiet mind , and manner quite unaltered -- save that she every day became more earnest and more grateful to them -- faded like the light upon a summer ’s evening . The child who had been her little friend came there , almost as soon as it was day , with an offering of dried flowers which he begged them to lay upon her breast . It was he who had come to the window overnight and spoken to the sexton , and they saw in the snow traces of small feet , where he had been lingering near the room in which she lay , before he went to bed . He had a fancy , it seemed , that they had left her there alone ; and could not bear the thought . He told them of his dream again , and that it was of her being restored to them , just as she used to be . He begged hard to see her , saying that he would be very quiet , and that they need not fear his being alarmed , for he had sat alone by his young brother all day long when he was dead , and had felt glad to be so near him . They let him have his wish ; and indeed he kept his word , and was , in his childish way , a lesson to them all . Up to that time , the old man had not spoken once -- except to her -- or stirred from the bedside . But , when he saw her little favourite , he was moved as they had not seen him yet , and made as though he would have him come nearer . Then , pointing to the bed , he burst into tears for the first time , and they who stood by , knowing that the sight of this child had done him good , left them alone together . Soothing him with his artless talk of her , the child persuaded him to take some rest , to walk abroad , to do almost as he desired him . And when the day came on , which must remove her in her earthly shape from earthly eyes for ever , he led him away , that he might not know when she was taken from him . They were to gather fresh leaves and berries for her bed . It was Sunday -- a bright , clear , wintry afternoon -- and as they traversed the village street , those who were walking in their path drew back to make way for them , and gave them a softened greeting . Some shook the old man kindly by the hand , some stood uncovered while he tottered by , and many cried ‘
259829	259835	259836	259836	Neighbour	121	’ as he passed along . ‘
259838	259856	259825	259825	God	71	’ said the old man , stopping at the cottage where his young guide ’s mother dwelt , ‘
259888	259898	259872	259872	I	0	’ She could not tell , the woman said . ‘
259910	259914	259904	259904	you	121	’ he said . ‘
259931	259941	259942	259942	We	5748	’ Again the woman said she could not tell . ‘
259947	259955	259942	259942	We	5748	’ said the old man , hurriedly . ‘
259963	259964	259942	259942	We	5748	’ ‘
259969	259977	259942	259942	We	5748	’ cried the child , detaining him . ‘
260022	260023	260002	260002	you	0	’ ‘
260029	260035	260002	260002	you	0	’ said the old man . ‘
260040	260041	260002	260002	you	0	’ ‘
260047	260052	260002	260002	you	0	’ returned the child . ‘
260063	260064	260002	260002	you	0	’ ‘
260078	260166	260071	260071	her	5750	’ He pressed his hand upon his brow , looked vacantly round , and as if impelled by a sudden thought , crossed the road , and entered the sexton ’s house . He and his deaf assistant were sitting before the fire . Both rose up , on seeing who it was . The child made a hasty sign to them with his hand . It was the action of an instant , but that , and the old man ’s look , were quite enough . ‘
260179	260185	260071	260071	her	5750	’ he said , eagerly . ‘
260197	260202	260195	260195	Sir	5863	’ returned the sexton . ‘
260216	260217	260208	260208	I	0	’ ‘
260228	260234	260225	260226	good Sir	5754	’ returned the sexton mildly . ‘
260245	260246	260225	260226	good Sir	5754	’ ‘
260257	260268	260269	260269	You	0	’ said the old man , turning to the child . ‘
260270	260299	260311	260312	the sexton	7661	’re sure of what you tell me ? You would not deceive me ? I am changed , even in the little time since you last saw me . ’
260300	260309	260311	260312	the sexton	7661	‘ Go thy ways with him , Sir , ’
260314	260322	260311	260312	the sexton	7661	‘ and Heaven be with ye both ! ’
260323	260329	260331	260333	the old man	384	‘ I am quite ready , ’
260337	260343	260331	260333	the old man	384	‘ Come , boy , come-- ’
262285	262293	262283	262283	himself	384	‘ She will come to - morrow ! ’
262320	262328	262310	262310	he	384	‘ She will come to - morrow ! ’
262502	262512	262496	262496	him	384	‘ Lord ! Let her come to - morrow ! ’
262918	266598	266599	266599	she	5856	’ pleasantry , Mr Brass consented to remain , and did remain , until a club of choice spirits called a Grand jury ( who were in the joke ) summoned him to a trial before twelve other wags for perjury and fraud , who in their turn found him guilty with a most facetious joy,--nay , the very populace entered into the whim , and when Mr Brass was moving in a hackney - coach towards the building where these wags assembled , saluted him with rotten eggs and carcases of kittens , and feigned to wish to tear him into shreds , which greatly increased the comicality of the thing , and made him relish it the more , no doubt . To work this sportive vein still further , Mr Brass , by his counsel , moved in arrest of judgment that he had been led to criminate himself , by assurances of safety and promises of pardon , and claimed the leniency which the law extends to such confiding natures as are thus deluded . After solemn argument , this point ( with others of a technical nature , whose humorous extravagance it would be difficult to exaggerate ) was referred to the judges for their decision , Sampson being meantime removed to his former quarters . Finally , some of the points were given in Sampson ’s favour , and some against him ; and the upshot was , that , instead of being desired to travel for a time in foreign parts , he was permitted to grace the mother country under certain insignificant restrictions . These were , that he should , for a term of years , reside in a spacious mansion where several other gentlemen were lodged and boarded at the public charge , who went clad in a sober uniform of grey turned up with yellow , had their hair cut extremely short , and chiefly lived on gruel and light soup . It was also required of him that he should partake of their exercise of constantly ascending an endless flight of stairs ; and , lest his legs , unused to such exertion , should be weakened by it , that he should wear upon one ankle an amulet or charm of iron . These conditions being arranged , he was removed one evening to his new abode , and enjoyed , in common with nine other gentlemen , and two ladies , the privilege of being taken to his place of retirement in one of Royalty ’s own carriages . Over and above these trifling penalties , his name was erased and blotted out from the roll of attorneys ; which erasure has been always held in these latter times to be a great degradation and reproach , and to imply the commission of some amazing villany -- as indeed it would seem to be the case , when so many worthless names remain among its better records , unmolested . Of Sally Brass , conflicting rumours went abroad . Some said with confidence that she had gone down to the docks in male attire , and had become a female sailor ; others darkly whispered that she had enlisted as a private in the second regiment of Foot Guards , and had been seen in uniform , and on duty , to wit , leaning on her musket and looking out of a sentry - box in St James ’s Park , one evening . There were many such whispers as these in circulation ; but the truth appears to be that , after the lapse of some five years ( during which there is no direct evidence of her having been seen at all ) , two wretched people were more than once observed to crawl at dusk from the inmost recesses of St Giles ’s , and to take their way along the streets , with shuffling steps and cowering shivering forms , looking into the roads and kennels as they went in search of refuse food or disregarded offal . These forms were never beheld but in those nights of cold and gloom , when the terrible spectres , who lie at all other times in the obscene hiding - places of London , in archways , dark vaults and cellars , venture to creep into the streets ; the embodied spirits of Disease , and Vice , and Famine . It was whispered by those who should have known , that these were Sampson and his sister Sally ; and to this day , it is said , they sometimes pass , on bad nights , in the same loathsome guise , close at the elbow of the shrinking passenger . The body of Quilp being found -- though not until some days had elapsed -- an inquest was held on it near the spot where it had been washed ashore . The general supposition was that he had committed suicide , and , this appearing to be favoured by all the circumstances of his death , the verdict was to that effect . He was left to be buried with a stake through his heart in the centre of four lonely roads . It was rumoured afterwards that this horrible and barbarous ceremony had been dispensed with , and that the remains had been secretly given up to Tom Scott . But even here , opinion was divided ; for some said Tom dug them up at midnight , and carried them to a place indicated to him by the widow . It is probable that both these stories may have had their origin in the simple fact of Tom ’s shedding tears upon the inquest -- which he certainly did , extraordinary as it may appear . He manifested , besides , a strong desire to assault the jury ; and being restrained and conducted out of court , darkened its only window by standing on his head upon the sill , until he was dexterously tilted upon his feet again by a cautious beadle . Being cast upon the world by his master ’s death , he determined to go through it upon his head and hands , and accordingly began to tumble for his bread . Finding , however , his English birth an insurmountable obstacle to his advancement in this pursuit ( notwithstanding that his art was in high repute and favour ) , he assumed the name of an Italian image lad , with whom he had become acquainted ; and afterwards tumbled with extraordinary success , and to overflowing audiences . Little Mrs Quilp never quite forgave herself the one deceit that lay so heavy on her conscience , and never spoke or thought of it but with bitter tears . Her husband had no relations , and she was rich . He had made no will , or she would probably have been poor . Having married the first time at her mother ’s instigation , she consulted in her second choice nobody but herself . It fell upon a smart young fellow enough ; and as he made it a preliminary condition that Mrs Jiniwin should be thenceforth an out - pensioner , they lived together after marriage with no more than the average amount of quarrelling , and led a merry life upon the dead dwarf ’s money . Mr and Mrs Garland , and Mr Abel , went out as usual ( except that there was a change in their household , as will be seen presently ) , and in due time the latter went into partnership with his friend the notary , on which occasion there was a dinner , and a ball , and great extent of dissipation . Unto this ball there happened to be invited the most bashful young lady that was ever seen , with whom Mr Abel happened to fall in love . HOW it happened , or how they found it out , or which of them first communicated the discovery to the other , nobody knows . But certain it is that in course of time they were married ; and equally certain it is that they were the happiest of the happy ; and no less certain it is that they deserved to be so . And it is pleasant to write down that they reared a family ; because any propagation of goodness and benevolence is no small addition to the aristocracy of nature , and no small subject of rejoicing for mankind at large . The pony preserved his character for independence and principle down to the last moment of his life ; which was an unusually long one , and caused him to be looked upon , indeed , as the very Old Parr of ponies . He often went to and fro with the little phaeton between Mr Garland ’s and his son ’s , and , as the old people and the young were frequently together , had a stable of his own at the new establishment , into which he would walk of himself with surprising dignity . He condescended to play with the children , as they grew old enough to cultivate his friendship , and would run up and down the little paddock with them like a dog ; but though he relaxed so far , and allowed them such small freedoms as caresses , or even to look at his shoes or hang on by his tail , he never permitted any one among them to mount his back or drive him ; thus showing that even their familiarity must have its limits , and that there were points between them far too serious for trifling . He was not unsusceptible of warm attachments in his later life , for when the good bachelor came to live with Mr Garland upon the clergyman ’s decease , he conceived a great friendship for him , and amiably submitted to be driven by his hands without the least resistance . He did no work for two or three years before he died , but lived in clover ; and his last act ( like a choleric old gentleman ) was to kick his doctor . Mr Swiveller , recovering very slowly from his illness , and entering into the receipt of his annuity , bought for the Marchioness a handsome stock of clothes , and put her to school forthwith , in redemption of the vow he had made upon his fevered bed . After casting about for some time for a name which should be worthy of her , he decided in favour of Sophronia Sphynx , as being euphonious and genteel , and furthermore indicative of mystery . Under this title the Marchioness repaired , in tears , to the school of his selection , from which , as she soon distanced all competitors , she was removed before the lapse of many quarters to one of a higher grade . It is but bare justice to Mr Swiveller to say , that , although the expenses of her education kept him in straitened circumstances for half a dozen years , he never slackened in his zeal , and always held himself sufficiently repaid by the accounts he heard ( with great gravity ) of her advancement , on his monthly visits to the governess , who looked upon him as a literary gentleman of eccentric habits , and of a most prodigious talent in quotation . In a word , Mr Swiveller kept the Marchioness at this establishment until she was , at a moderate guess , full nineteen years of age-- good - looking , clever , and good - humoured ; when he began to consider seriously what was to be done next . On one of his periodical visits , while he was revolving this question in his mind , the Marchioness came down to him , alone , looking more smiling and more fresh than ever . Then , it occurred to him , but not for the first time , that if she would marry him , how comfortable they might be ! So Richard asked her ; whatever she said , it was n’t No ; and they were married in good earnest that day week . Which gave Mr Swiveller frequent occasion to remark at divers subsequent periods that there had been a young lady saving up for him after all . A little cottage at Hampstead being to let , which had in its garden a smoking - box , the envy of the civilised world , they agreed to become its tenants , and , when the honey - moon was over , entered upon its occupation . To this retreat Mr Chuckster repaired regularly every Sunday to spend the day -- usually beginning with breakfast -- and here he was the great purveyor of general news and fashionable intelligence . For some years he continued a deadly foe to Kit , protesting that he had a better opinion of him when he was supposed to have stolen the five - pound note , than when he was shown to be perfectly free of the crime ; inasmuch as his guilt would have had in it something daring and bold , whereas his innocence was but another proof of a sneaking and crafty disposition . By slow degrees , however , he was reconciled to him in the end ; and even went so far as to honour him with his patronage , as one who had in some measure reformed , and was therefore to be forgiven . But he never forgot or pardoned that circumstance of the shilling ; holding that if he had come back to get another he would have done well enough , but that his returning to work out the former gift was a stain upon his moral character which no penitence or contrition could ever wash away . Mr Swiveller , having always been in some measure of a philosophic and reflective turn , grew immensely contemplative , at times , in the smoking - box , and was accustomed at such periods to debate in his own mind the mysterious question of Sophronia ’s parentage . Sophronia herself supposed she was an orphan ; but Mr Swiveller , putting various slight circumstances together , often thought Miss Brass must know better than that ; and , having heard from his wife of her strange interview with Quilp , entertained sundry misgivings whether that person , in his lifetime , might not also have been able to solve the riddle , had he chosen . These speculations , however , gave him no uneasiness ; for Sophronia was ever a most cheerful , affectionate , and provident wife to him ; and Dick ( excepting for an occasional outbreak with Mr Chuckster , which she had the good sense rather to encourage than oppose ) was to her an attached and domesticated husband . And they played many hundred thousand games of cribbage together . And let it be added , to Dick ’s honour , that , though we have called her Sophronia , he called her the Marchioness from first to last ; and that upon every anniversary of the day on which he found her in his sick room , Mr Chuckster came to dinner , and there was great glorification . The gamblers , Isaac List and Jowl , with their trusty confederate Mr James Groves of unimpeachable memory , pursued their course with varying success , until the failure of a spirited enterprise in the way of their profession , dispersed them in various directions , and caused their career to receive a sudden check from the long and strong arm of the law . This defeat had its origin in the untoward detection of a new associate -- young Frederick Trent -- who thus became the unconscious instrument of their punishment and his own . For the young man himself , he rioted abroad for a brief term , living by his wits -- which means by the abuse of every faculty that worthily employed raises man above the beasts , and so degraded , sinks him far below them . It was not long before his body was recognised by a stranger , who chanced to visit that hospital in Paris where the drowned are laid out to be owned ; despite the bruises and disfigurements which were said to have been occasioned by some previous scuffle . But the stranger kept his own counsel until he returned home , and it was never claimed or cared for . The younger brother , or the single gentleman , for that designation is more familiar , would have drawn the poor schoolmaster from his lone retreat , and made him his companion and friend . But the humble village teacher was timid of venturing into the noisy world , and had become fond of his dwelling in the old churchyard . Calmly happy in his school , and in the spot , and in the attachment of Her little mourner , he pursued his quiet course in peace ; and was , through the righteous gratitude of his friend -- let this brief mention suffice for that -- a POOR school - master no more . That friend -- single gentleman , or younger brother , which you will -- had at his heart a heavy sorrow ; but it bred in him no misanthropy or monastic gloom . He went forth into the world , a lover of his kind . For a long , long time , it was his chief delight to travel in the steps of the old man and the child ( so far as he could trace them from her last narrative ) , to halt where they had halted , sympathise where they had suffered , and rejoice where they had been made glad . Those who had been kind to them , did not escape his search . The sisters at the school -- they who were her friends , because themselves so friendless -- Mrs Jarley of the wax - work , Codlin , Short -- he found them all ; and trust me , the man who fed the furnace fire was not forgotten . Kit ’s story having got abroad , raised him up a host of friends , and many offers of provision for his future life . He had no idea at first of ever quitting Mr Garland ’s service ; but , after serious remonstrance and advice from that gentleman , began to contemplate the possibility of such a change being brought about in time . A good post was procured for him , with a rapidity which took away his breath , by some of the gentlemen who had believed him guilty of the offence laid to his charge , and who had acted upon that belief . Through the same kind agency , his mother was secured from want , and made quite happy . Thus , as Kit often said , his great misfortune turned out to be the source of all his subsequent prosperity . Did Kit live a single man all his days , or did he marry ? Of course he married , and who should be his wife but Barbara ? And the best of it was , he married so soon that little Jacob was an uncle , before the calves of his legs , already mentioned in this history , had ever been encased in broadcloth pantaloons,--though that was not quite the best either , for of necessity the baby was an uncle too . The delight of Kit ’s mother and of Barbara ’s mother upon the great occasion is past all telling ; finding they agreed so well on that , and on all other subjects , they took up their abode together , and were a most harmonious pair of friends from that time forth . And had n’t Astley ’s cause to bless itself for their all going together once a quarter -- to the pit -- and did n’t Kit ’s mother always say , when they painted the outside , that Kit ’s last treat had helped to that , and wonder what the manager would feel if he but knew it as they passed his house ! When Kit had children six and seven years old , there was a Barbara among them , and a pretty Barbara she was . Nor was there wanting an exact facsimile and copy of little Jacob , as he appeared in those remote times when they taught him what oysters meant . Of course there was an Abel , own godson to the Mr Garland of that name ; and there was a Dick , whom Mr Swiveller did especially favour . The little group would often gather round him of a night and beg him to tell again that story of good Miss Nell who died . This , Kit would do ; and when they cried to hear it , wishing it longer too , he would teach them how she had gone to Heaven , as all good people did ; and how , if they were good , like her , they might hope to be there too , one day , and to see and know her as he had done when he was quite a boy . Then , he would relate to them how needy he used to be , and how she had taught him what he was otherwise too poor to learn , and how the old man had been used to say ‘
