It was as bad as a public - house , waiting at dinner ; you know it was ! ”

22458	22504	22456	22456	I	0	“ because that would be so very unreasonable . I did not know what you tell me because the servant did not come near me at dinner ; but I do n’t doubt what you tell me , and I am sorry to hear it . ”
22505	22515	22517	22517	she	1440	“ You need n’t make a merit of that , ”

He never has what you would call a regular breakfast . Priscilla leaves him out the loaf and some milk , when there is any , overnight . Sometimes there is n’t any milk , and sometimes the cat drinks it . But I ’m afraid you must be tired , Miss Summerson , and perhaps you would rather go to bed . ”

Such ASSES as he and Ma make of themselves ! ”

Then let the public and Africa show duty as a child ; it ’s much more their affair than mine . You are shocked , I dare say ! Very well , so am I shocked too ; so we are both shocked , and there ’s an end of it ! ”
23886	23983	23989	23989	her	304	“ But for all that , I say again , he may come , and come , and come , and I wo n’t have anything to say to him . I ca n’t bear him . If there ’s any stuff in the world that I hate and detest , it ’s the stuff he and Ma talk . I wonder the very paving - stones opposite our house can have the patience to stay there and be a witness of such inconsistencies and contradictions as all that sounding nonsense , and Ma ’s management ! ”
24119	24124	24130	24130	Richard	291	“ So , cousin , ”
24136	24173	24130	24130	Richard	291	“ We are never to get out of Chancery ! We have come by another way to our place of meeting yesterday , and — by the Great Seal , here ’s the old lady again ! ”

24234	24266	24268	24270	the old lady	9711	“ Ye - es ! I usually walk here early . Before the court sits . It ’s retired . I collect my thoughts here for the business of the day , ”
24273	24297	24268	24270	the old lady	9711	“ The business of the day requires a great deal of thought . Chancery justice is so ve - ry difficult to follow . ”
24298	24306	24308	24309	Miss Jellyby	304	“ Who ’s this , Miss Summerson ? ”
24335	24373	24375	24377	the old lady	9711	“ A suitor , my child . At your service . I have the honour to attend court regularly . With my documents . Have I the pleasure of addressing another of the youthful parties in Jarndyce ? ”
24420	24423	24425	24427	the old lady	9711	“ Ha ! ”
24429	24512	24425	24427	the old lady	9711	“ She does not expect a judgment ? She will still grow old . But not so old . Oh , dear , no ! This is the garden of Lincoln ’s Inn . I call it my garden . It is quite a bower in the summer - time . Where the birds sing melodiously . I pass the greater part of the long vacation here . In contemplation . You find the long vacation exceedingly long , do n’t you ? ”
24527	24556	24558	24560	the old lady	9711	“ When the leaves are falling from the trees and there are no more flowers in bloom to make up into nosegays for the Lord Chancellor ’s court , ”
24562	24623	24558	24560	the old lady	9711	“ the vacation is fulfilled and the sixth seal , mentioned in the Revelations , again prevails . Pray come and see my lodging . It will be a good omen for me . Youth , and hope , and beauty are very seldom there . It is a long , long time since I had a visit from either . ”
24792	24802	24803	24803	She	9711	“ This is my lodging . Pray walk up ! ”

25660	25666	25668	25671	the little old lady	1469	“ My landlord , Krook , ”
25687	25729	25730	25730	She	1469	“ He is called among the neighbours the Lord Chancellor . His shop is called the Court of Chancery . He is a very eccentric person . He is very odd . Oh , I assure you he is very odd ! ”
25759	25771	25773	25775	the old lady	9711	“ For he is a little — you know — M ! ”
25788	25794	25795	25795	he	1223	“ It ’s true enough , ”
25805	25835	25795	25795	he	1223	“ that they call me the Lord Chancellor and call my shop Chancery . And why do you think they call me the Lord Chancellor and my shop Chancery ? ”
25836	25846	25848	25848	Richard	291	“ I do n’t know , I am sure ! ”
25852	25856	25858	25860	the old man	1223	“ You see , ”
25867	25904	25858	25860	the old man	1223	“ they — Hi ! Here ’s lovely hair ! I have got three sacks of ladies ’ hair below , but none so beautiful and fine as this . What colour , and what texture ! ”
25905	25914	25916	25916	Richard	291	“ That ’ll do , my good friend ! ”
25934	25949	25950	25952	The old man	1223	“ You can admire as the rest of us do without taking that liberty . ”
26026	26037	26038	26038	he	249	“ You see , I have so many things here , ”
26046	26246	26038	26038	he	249	“ of so many kinds , and all as the neighbours think ( but THEY know nothing ) , wasting away and going to rack and ruin , that that ’s why they have given me and my place a christening . And I have so many old parchmentses and papers in my stock . And I have a liking for rust and must and cobwebs . And all ’s fish that comes to my net . And I ca n’t abear to part with anything I once lay hold of ( or so my neighbours think , but what do THEY know ? ) or to alter anything , or to have any sweeping , nor scouring , nor cleaning , nor repairing going on about me . That ’s the way I ’ve got the ill name of Chancery . I do n’t mind . I go to see my noble and learned brother pretty well every day , when he sits in the Inn . He do n’t notice me , but I notice him . There ’s no great odds betwixt us . We both grub on in a muddle . Hi , Lady Jane ! ”
26264	26280	26282	26283	her master	1522	“ Hi ! Show ’em how you scratch . Hi ! Tear , my lady ! ”
26314	26330	26332	26334	the old man	1223	“ She ’d do as much for any one I was to set her on , ”
26336	26386	26387	26387	He	1223	“ I deal in cat - skins among other general matters , and hers was offered to me . It ’s a very fine skin , as you may see , but I did n’t have it stripped off ! THAT warn’t like Chancery practice though , says you ! ”
26439	26485	26427	26430	the little old lady	1469	“ That will do , Krook . You mean well , but are tiresome . My young friends are pressed for time . I have none to spare myself , having to attend court very soon . My young friends are the wards in Jarndyce . ”
26486	26489	26491	26493	the old man	1223	“ Jarndyce ! ”

26536	26541	26542	26542	He	1223	“ Think of it ! ”
26560	26585	26557	26557	Richard	291	“ Why , you appear to trouble yourself a good deal about the causes before your noble and learned brother , the other Chancellor ! ”
26586	26589	26591	26593	the old man	1223	“ Yes , ”
26596	26605	26591	26593	the old man	1223	“ Sure ! YOUR name now will be — ”
26606	26610	26557	26557	Richard	291	“ Richard Carstone . ”
26611	26614	26615	26615	he	1223	“ Carstone , ”
26642	26669	26632	26632	he	1223	“ Yes . There was the name of Barbary , and the name of Clare , and the name of Dedlock , too , I think . ”
26670	26684	26686	26686	Richard	291	“ He knows as much of the cause as the real salaried Chancellor ! ”
26696	26699	26701	26703	the old man	1223	“ Aye ! ”
26712	26749	26701	26703	the old man	1223	“ Yes ! Tom Jarndyce — you’ll excuse me , being related ; but he was never known about court by any other name , and was as well known there as — she is now , ”
26756	26874	26701	26703	the old man	1223	“ Tom Jarndyce was often in here . He got into a restless habit of strolling about when the cause was on , or expected , talking to the little shopkeepers and telling ’em to keep out of Chancery , whatever they did . ‘ For , ’ says he , ‘ it ’s being ground to bits in a slow mill ; it ’s being roasted at a slow fire ; it ’s being stung to death by single bees ; it ’s being drowned by drops ; it ’s going mad by grains . ’ He was as near making away with himself , just where the young lady stands , as near could be . ”
26880	26888	26890	26892	the old man	1223	“ He come in at the door , ”
26903	27123	26890	26892	the old man	1223	“ on the day he did it — the whole neighbourhood had said for months before that he would do it , of a certainty sooner or later — he come in at the door that day , and walked along there , and sat himself on a bench that stood there , and asked me ( you ’ll judge I was a mortal sight younger then ) to fetch him a pint of wine . ‘ For , ’ says he , ‘ Krook , I am much depressed ; my cause is on again , and I think I ’m nearer judgment than I ever was . ’ I had n’t a mind to leave him alone ; and I persuaded him to go to the tavern over the way there , t’other side my lane ( I mean Chancery Lane ) ; and I followed and looked in at the window , and saw him , comfortable as I thought , in the arm - chair by the fire , and company with him . I had n’t hardly got back here when I heard a shot go echoing and rattling right away into the inn . I ran out — neighbours ran out — twenty of us cried at once , ‘ Tom Jarndyce ! ’ ”
27151	27249	27124	27126	The old man	1223	“ We were right , I need n’t tell the present hearers . Hi ! To be sure , how the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the cause was on ! How my noble and learned brother , and all the rest of ’em , grubbed and muddled away as usual and tried to look as if they had n’t heard a word of the last fact in the case or as if they had — Oh , dear me!—nothing at all to do with it if they had heard of it by any chance ! ”
27383	27393	27349	27349	she	290	“ a little — M — , you know ! ”
27507	27511	27513	27513	she	290	“ containing documents , ”
27594	27602	27604	27606	our poor hostess	1556	“ Extremely honoured , I am sure , ”
27612	27789	27790	27790	She	1557	“ by this visit from the wards in Jarndyce . And very much indebted for the omen . It is a retired situation . Considering . I am limited as to situation . In consequence of the necessity of attending on the Chancellor . I have lived here many years . I pass my days in court , my evenings and my nights here . I find the nights long , for I sleep but little and think much . That is , of course , unavoidable , being in Chancery . I am sorry I can not offer chocolate . I expect a judgment shortly and shall then place my establishment on a superior footing . At present , I do n’t mind confessing to the wards in Jarndyce ( in strict confidence ) that I sometimes find it difficult to keep up a genteel appearance . I have felt the cold here . I have felt something sharper than cold . It matters very little . Pray excuse the introduction of such mean topics . ”
27838	27847	27848	27848	she	1557	“ I began to keep the little creatures , ”
27851	27953	27848	27848	she	1557	“ with an object that the wards will readily comprehend . With the intention of restoring them to liberty . When my judgment should be given . Ye - es ! They die in prison , though . Their lives , poor silly things , are so short in comparison with Chancery proceedings that , one by one , the whole collection has died over and over again . I doubt , do you know , whether one of these , though they are all young , will live to be free ! Ve - ry mortifying , is it not ? ”
27990	27993	27994	27994	she	1557	“ Indeed , ”
27997	28045	28046	28046	Richard	291	“ I positively doubt sometimes , I do assure you , whether while matters are still unsettled , and the sixth or Great Seal still prevails , I may not one day be found lying stark and senseless here , as I have found so many birds ! ”

28107	28186	28102	28105	the little old lady	1469	“ for ( you ’ll think this curious ) I find my mind confused by the idea that they are singing while I am following the arguments in court . And my mind requires to be so very clear , you know ! Another time , I ’ll tell you their names . Not at present . On a day of such good omen , they shall sing as much as they like . In honour of youth , ”

28201	28205	28102	28105	the little old lady	1469	“ and beauty , ”
28211	28222	28102	28105	the little old lady	1469	“ There ! We ’ll let in the full light . ”
28231	28240	28242	28245	the little old lady	1469	“ I can not admit the air freely , ”
28259	28291	28242	28245	the little old lady	1469	it—“because the cat you saw downstairs , called Lady Jane , is greedy for their lives . She crouches on the parapet outside for hours and hours . I have discovered , ”
28295	28363	28242	28245	the little old lady	1469	“ that her natural cruelty is sharpened by a jealous fear of their regaining their liberty . In consequence of the judgment I expect being shortly given . She is sly and full of malice . I half believe , sometimes , that she is no cat , but the wolf of the old saying . It is so very difficult to keep her from the door . ”
28458	28482	28484	28484	she	1567	“ With such an omen , it is even more necessary than usual that I should be there before the Chancellor comes in , ”
28486	28512	28484	28484	she	1567	“ for he might mention my case the first thing . I have a presentiment that he WILL mention it the first thing this morning . ”

28596	28632	28590	28590	she	1567	“ a law - writer . The children in the lanes here say he has sold himself to the devil . I do n’t know what he can have done with the money . Hush ! ”

29142	29174	29133	29133	Richard	291	“ Miss Summerson , I hope you are not bargaining for the sale of your hair . Do n’t be tempted . Three sacks below are quite enough for Mr. Krook ! ”
29282	29292	29294	29294	Richard	291	“ Quite an adventure for a morning in London ! ”
29299	29314	29294	29294	Richard	291	“ Ah , cousin , cousin , it ’s a weary word this Chancery ! ”
29315	29330	29332	29332	Ada	290	“ It is to me , and has been ever since I can remember , ”
29334	29433	29332	29332	Ada	290	“ I am grieved that I should be the enemy — as I suppose I am — of a great number of relations and others , and that they should be my enemies — as I suppose they are — and that we should all be ruining one another without knowing how or why and be in constant doubt and discord all our lives . It seems very strange , as there must be right somewhere , that an honest judge in real earnest has not been able to find out through all these years where it is . ”
29434	29439	29441	29441	Richard	291	“ Ah , cousin ! ”
29443	29534	29441	29441	Richard	291	“ Strange , indeed ! All this wasteful , wanton chess - playing IS very strange . To see that composed court yesterday jogging on so serenely and to think of the wretchedness of the pieces on the board gave me the headache and the heartache both together . My head ached with wondering how it happened , if men were neither fools nor rascals ; and my heart ached to think they could possibly be either . But at all events , Ada — I may call you Ada ? ”
29535	29544	29636	29637	Mrs. Jellyby	294	“ Of course you may , cousin Richard . ”

32137	32178	32180	32181	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ I dare say it is , Rick . I believe it is . And so the little Jell — I had my doubts about ’em — are in a — oh , Lord , yes , it ’s easterly ! ”
32280	32315	32317	32318	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ Those little Jellybys . Could n’t you — didn’t you — now , if it had rained sugar - plums , or three - cornered raspberry tarts , or anything of that sort ! ”

33752	33806	33739	33739	he	286	“ It makes no pretensions , but it is a comfortable little place , I hope , and will be more so with such bright young looks in it . You have barely half an hour before dinner . There ’s no one here but the finest creature upon earth — a child . ”
33807	33813	33815	33815	Ada	290	“ More children , Esther ! ”
33817	33826	33815	33815	Ada	290	“ I do n’t mean literally a child , ”
33831	33879	33815	33815	Ada	290	“ not a child in years . He is grown up — he is at least as old as I am — but in simplicity , and freshness , and enthusiasm , and a fine guileless inaptitude for all worldly affairs , he is a perfect child . ”

He is a man of attainments and of captivating manners . He has been unfortunate in his affairs , and unfortunate in his pursuits , and unfortunate in his family ; but he do n’t care — he ’s a child ! ”
33976	33990	33992	33992	Richard	291	“ Did you imply that he has children of his own , sir ? ”
33994	34043	34045	34046	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ Yes , Rick ! Half - a - dozen . More ! Nearer a dozen , I should think . But he has never looked after them . How could he ? He wanted somebody to look after HIM . He is a child , you know ! ”
34048	34061	34063	34063	Richard	291	“ And have the children looked after themselves at all , sir ? ”
34065	34074	34076	34077	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ Why , just as you may suppose , ”
34084	34131	34132	34132	Richard	291	“ It is said that the children of the very poor are not brought up , but dragged up . Harold Skimpole ’s children have tumbled up somehow or other . The wind ’s getting round again , I am afraid . I feel it rather ! ”

34870	34876	34862	34863	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ he was perfectly right , ”
34893	34915	34887	34887	he	323	“ nothing to live upon but love , fell in love , and married , and surrounded himself with rosy cheeks . ”
35135	35184	35129	35129	He	323	“ Go your several ways in peace ! Wear red coats , blue coats , lawn sleeves ; put pens behind your ears , wear aprons ; go after glory , holiness , commerce , trade , any object you prefer ; only — let Harold Skimpole live ! ”

35357	35654	35349	35350	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ Possession is nothing to me . Here is my friend Jarndyce ’s excellent house . I feel obliged to him for possessing it . I can sketch it and alter it . I can set it to music . When I am here , I have sufficient possession of it and have neither trouble , cost , nor responsibility . My steward ’s name , in short , is Jarndyce , and he ca n’t cheat me . We have been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby . There is a bright - eyed woman , of a strong will and immense power of business detail , who throws herself into objects with surprising ardour ! I do n’t regret that I have not a strong will and an immense power of business detail to throw myself into objects with surprising ardour . I can admire her without envy . I can sympathize with the objects . I can dream of them . I can lie down on the grass — in fine weather — and float along an African river , embracing all the natives I meet , as sensible of the deep silence and sketching the dense overhanging tropical growth as accurately as if I were there . I do n’t know that it ’s of any direct use my doing so , but it ’s all I can do , and I do it thoroughly . Then , for heaven ’s sake , having Harold Skimpole , a confiding child , petitioning you , the world , an agglomeration of practical people of business habits , to let him live and admire the human family , do it somehow or other , like good souls , and suffer him to ride his rocking - horse ! ”
35690	35704	35706	35707	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ It ’s only you , the generous creatures , whom I envy , ”
35721	35857	35706	35707	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ I envy you your power of doing what you do . It is what I should revel in myself . I do n’t feel any vulgar gratitude to you . I almost feel as if YOU ought to be grateful to ME for giving you the opportunity of enjoying the luxury of generosity . I know you like it . For anything I can tell , I may have come into the world expressly for the purpose of increasing your stock of happiness . I may have been born to be a benefactor to you by sometimes giving you an opportunity of assisting me in my little perplexities . Why should I regret my incapacity for details and worldly affairs when it leads to such pleasant consequences ? I do n’t regret it therefore . ”
36054	36070	36050	36050	he	1758	“ I am a child , you know ! You are designing people compared with me ”
36082	36099	36050	36050	he	1758	“ but I am gay and innocent ; forget your worldly arts and play with me ! ”

36206	36271	36203	36203	he	1758	“ With that golden hair , those blue eyes , and that fresh bloom on her cheek , she is like the summer morning . The birds here will mistake her for it . We will not call such a lovely young creature as that , who is a joy to all mankind , an orphan . She is the child of the universe . ”

36349	36384	36346	36347	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ You know the world ( which in your sense is the universe ) , and I know nothing of it , so you shall have your way . But if I had mine , ”
36390	36453	36387	36388	the cousins	1768	“ there should be no brambles of sordid realities in such a path as that . It should be strewn with roses ; it should lie through bowers , where there was no spring , autumn , nor winter , but perpetual summer . Age or change should never wither it . The base word money should never be breathed near it ! ”
36889	36902	36914	36914	she	1776	“ If you please , miss , could you spare a minute ? ”
36922	36951	36914	36914	she	1776	“ Oh , if you please , miss , Mr. Carstone says would you come upstairs to Mr. Skimpole ’s room . He has been took , miss ! ”

37285	37306	37278	37278	he	323	“ I do n’t know . Some pounds , odd shillings , and halfpence , I think , were mentioned . ”

37334	37343	37345	37346	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ And it sounds — somehow it sounds , ”
37348	37354	37345	37346	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ like a small sum ? ”
37383	37387	37389	37389	Richard	291	“ Mr. Skimpole , ”
37393	37421	37389	37389	Richard	291	“ has a delicacy in applying to my cousin Jarndyce because he has lately — I think , sir , I understood you that you had lately — ”
37422	37427	37429	37430	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ Oh , yes ! ”
37434	37476	37478	37478	he	323	“ Though I forgot how much it was and when it was . Jarndyce would readily do it again , but I have the epicure - like feeling that I would prefer a novelty in help , that I would rather , ”

38465	38492	38463	38463	Coavinses	324	“ I know’d if you wos missed to - day , you would n’t be missed to - morrow . A day makes no such odds . ”
38493	38501	38503	38504	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ But when you came down here , ”
38506	38538	38503	38504	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ it was a fine day . The sun was shining , the wind was blowing , the lights and shadows were passing across the fields , the birds were singing . ”
38539	38549	38551	38551	Coavinses	324	“ Nobody said they warn’t , in MY hearing , ”
38553	38556	38558	38559	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ No , ”
38561	38571	38558	38559	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ But what did you think upon the road ? ”
38572	38578	38580	38580	Coavinses	324	“ Wot do you mean ? ”
38588	38610	38580	38580	Coavinses	324	“ Think ! I ’ve got enough to do , and little enough to get for it without thinking . Thinking ! ”
38617	38628	38630	38631	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ Then you did n’t think , at all events , ”
38633	38713	38630	38631	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ to this effect : ‘ Harold Skimpole loves to see the sun shine , loves to hear the wind blow , loves to watch the changing lights and shadows , loves to hear the birds , those choristers in Nature ’s great cathedral . And does it seem to me that I am about to deprive Harold Skimpole of his share in such possessions , which are his only birthright ! ’ You thought nothing to that effect ? ”
38714	38723	38725	38725	Coavinses	324	“ I — certainly — did — NOT , ”
38771	38789	38791	38792	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ Very odd and very curious , the mental process is , in you men of business ! ”
38795	38805	38791	38792	Mr. Skimpole	323	“ Thank you , my friend . Good night . ”
39113	39127	39128	39128	he	286	“ Oh , dear me , what ’s this , what ’s this ! ”
39144	39199	39128	39128	he	286	“ What ’s this they tell me ? Rick , my boy , Esther , my dear , what have you been doing ? Why did you do it ? How could you do it ? How much apiece was it ? The wind ’s round again . I feel it all over me ! ”
39210	39265	39128	39128	he	286	“ Come , Rick , come ! I must settle this before I sleep . How much are you out of pocket ? You two made the money up , you know ! Why did you ? How could you ? Oh , Lord , yes , it ’s due east — must be ! ”
39266	39271	39273	39273	Richard	291	“ Really , sir , ”
39275	39296	39273	39273	Richard	291	“ I do n’t think it would be honourable in me to tell you . Mr. Skimpole relied upon us — ”
39297	39311	39313	39314	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ Lord bless you , my dear boy ! He relies upon everybody ! ”
39326	39331	39313	39314	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ Indeed , sir ? ”
39332	39347	39349	39350	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ Everybody ! And he ’ll be in the same scrape again next week ! ”
39370	39423	39424	39424	Richard	291	“ He ’s always in the same scrape . He was born in the same scrape . I verily believe that the announcement in the newspapers when his mother was confined was ‘ On Tuesday last , at her residence in Botheration Buildings , Mrs. Skimpole of a son in difficulties . ’ ”
39430	39501	39424	39424	Richard	291	“ Still , sir , I do n’t want to shake his confidence or to break his confidence , and if I submit to your better knowledge again , that I ought to keep his secret , I hope you will consider before you press me any more . Of course , if you do press me , sir , I shall know I am wrong and will tell you . ”
39502	39505	39507	39508	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ Well ! ”
39526	39611	39612	39612	He	286	“ I — here ! Take it away , my dear . I do n’t know what I am about with it ; it ’s all the wind — invariably has that effect — I wo n’t press you , Rick ; you may be right . But really — to get hold of you and Esther — and to squeeze you like a couple of tender young Saint Michael ’s oranges ! It ’ll blow a gale in the course of the night ! ”
39670	39676	39678	39679	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ Eh , my dear ? ”
39686	39694	39696	39696	I	0	“ Being quite a child , sir , ”
39698	39706	39696	39696	I	0	“ and so different from other people — ”
39707	39712	39714	39715	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ You are right ! ”
39719	39754	39714	39715	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ Your woman ’s wit hits the mark . He is a child — an absolute child . I told you he was a child , you know , when I first mentioned him . ”
39762	39775	39777	39778	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ And he IS a child . Now , is n’t he ? ”
39792	39814	39816	39817	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ When you come to think of it , it ’s the height of childishness in you — I mean me — ”
39819	39858	39816	39817	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ to regard him for a moment as a man . You ca n’t make HIM responsible . The idea of Harold Skimpole with designs or plans , or knowledge of consequences ! Ha , ha , ha ! ”
39940	39953	39955	39956	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ Why , what a cod ’s head and shoulders I am , ”
39958	40023	40025	40026	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ to require reminding of it ! The whole business shows the child from beginning to end . Nobody but a child would have thought of singling YOU two out for parties in the affair ! Nobody but a child would have thought of YOUR having the money ! If it had been a thousand pounds , it would have been just the same ! ”
40045	40054	40056	40057	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ To be sure , to be sure ! ”
40059	40114	40056	40057	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ However , Rick , Esther , and you too , Ada , for I do n’t know that even your little purse is safe from his inexperience — I must have a promise all round that nothing of this sort shall ever be done any more . No advances ! Not even sixpences . ”
40144	40149	40151	40152	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ As to Skimpole , ”
40154	40224	40225	40225	He	286	“ a habitable doll ’s house with good board and a few tin people to get into debt with and borrow money of would set the boy up in life . He is in a child ’s sleep by this time , I suppose ; it ’s time I should take my craftier head to my more worldly pillow . Good night , my dears . God bless you ! ”
40245	40275	40281	40281	himself	286	“ Oh ! I have been looking at the weather - cock . I find it was a false alarm about the wind . It ’s in the south ! ”
40619	40631	40614	40614	I	0	“ Esther , Esther , Esther ! Duty , my dear ! ”

41256	41272	41249	41249	he	1842	“ Rain , rain , rain ! Nothing but rain — and no family here ! ”
41701	41708	41709	41709	She	328	“ is what she looks at . ”
41847	41870	41844	41844	she	328	“ fifty year , three months , and a fortnight , by the blessing of heaven , if I live till Tuesday . ”
42128	42138	42124	42124	he	1887	“ Leave me , and send Mrs. Rouncewell here ! ”
42443	42447	42449	42450	Sir Leicester	266	“ Mrs. Rouncewell , ”
42452	42509	42449	42450	Sir Leicester	266	“ I can never consent to argue , as you know , with any one on any subject . You had better get rid of your boy ; you had better get him into some Works . The iron country farther north is , I suppose , the congenial direction for a boy with these tendencies . ”
42682	42712	42714	42715	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ And , again and again , I am glad to see you , Watt ! And , once again , I am glad to see you , Watt ! ”
42717	42735	42714	42715	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ You are a fine young fellow . You are like your poor uncle George . Ah ! ”
42749	42760	42736	42737	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ They say I am like my father , grandmother . ”
42761	42783	42784	42785	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ Like him , also , my dear — but most like your poor uncle George ! And your dear father . ”
42791	42796	42784	42785	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ He is well ? ”
42797	42806	42784	42785	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ Thriving , grandmother , in every way . ”
42807	42812	42784	42785	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ I am thankful ! ”
42845	42851	42853	42853	she	328	“ He is quite happy ? ”
42855	42858	42853	42853	she	328	“ Quite . ”
42859	42925	42813	42814	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ I am thankful ! So he has brought you up to follow in his ways and has sent you into foreign countries and the like ? Well , he knows best . There may be a world beyond Chesney Wold that I do n’t understand . Though I am not young , either . And I have seen a quantity of good company too ! ”
42926	42929	42931	42933	the young man	1916	“ Grandmother , ”
42939	42959	42931	42933	the young man	1916	“ what a very pretty girl that was I found with you just now . You called her Rosa ? ”
42960	43025	42813	42814	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ Yes , child . She is daughter of a widow in the village . Maids are so hard to teach , now - a - days , that I have put her about me young . She ’s an apt scholar and will do well . She shows the house already , very pretty . She lives with me at my table here . ”
43026	43036	42931	42933	the young man	1916	“ I hope I have not driven her away ? ”
43037	43070	43072	43073	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ She supposes we have family affairs to speak about , I dare say . She is very modest . It is a fine quality in a young woman . And scarcer , ”
43083	43089	43072	43073	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ than it formerly was ! ”
43108	43111	43113	43113	she	328	“ Wheels ! ”
43128	43142	43104	43105	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ What wheels on such a day as this , for gracious sake ? ”
43154	43158	43104	43105	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ Come in ! ”
43205	43213	43215	43216	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ What company is this , Rosa ? ”
43218	43249	43215	43216	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ It ’s two young men in a gig , ma’am , who want to see the house — yes , and if you please , I told them so ! ”
43262	43307	43215	43216	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ I went to the hall - door and told them it was the wrong day and the wrong hour , but the young man who was driving took off his hat in the wet and begged me to bring this card to you . ”
43308	43316	43318	43319	the housekeeper	944	“ Read it , my dear Watt , ”
43355	43358	43349	43349	Rosa	334	“ Mr. Guppy ”
43367	43370	43372	43373	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ Guppy ! ”
43375	43388	43372	43373	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ MR . Guppy ! Nonsense , I never heard of him ! ”
43389	43399	43401	43401	Rosa	334	“ If you please , he told ME that ! ”
43403	43512	43401	43401	Rosa	334	“ But he said that he and the other young gentleman came from London only last night by the mail , on business at the magistrates ’ meeting , ten miles off , this morning , and that as their business was soon over , and they had heard a great deal said of Chesney Wold , and really did n’t know what to do with themselves , they had come through the wet to see it . They are lawyers . He says he is not in Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s office , but he is sure he may make use of Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s name if necessary . ”
43639	43647	43653	43653	himself	297	“ Much obliged to you , ma’am ! ”
43662	43690	43691	43693	The old housekeeper	1932	“ Us London lawyers do n’t often get an out , and when we do , we like to make the most of it , you know . ”
44023	44027	44029	44030	Mr. Guppy	297	“ Dear me ! ”
44032	44037	44029	44030	Mr. Guppy	297	“ Who ’s that ? ”
44038	44047	44049	44049	Rosa	334	“ The picture over the fire - place , ”
44051	44076	44049	44049	Rosa	334	“ is the portrait of the present Lady Dedlock . It is considered a perfect likeness , and the best work of the master . ”
44077	44080	44082	44083	Mr. Guppy	297	“ Blest , ”
44095	44117	44082	44083	Mr. Guppy	297	“ if I can ever have seen her . Yet I know her ! Has the picture been engraved , miss ? ”
44118	44133	44049	44049	Rosa	334	“ The picture has never been engraved . Sir Leicester has always refused permission . ”
44134	44137	44139	44140	Mr. Guppy	297	“ Well ! ”
44146	44173	44139	44140	Mr. Guppy	297	“ I ’ll be shot if it ai n’t very curious how well I know that picture ! So that ’s Lady Dedlock , is it ! ”
44174	44201	44049	44049	Rosa	334	“ The picture on the right is the present Sir Leicester Dedlock . The picture on the left is his father , the late Sir Leicester . ”
44213	44220	44221	44221	he	297	“ It ’s unaccountable to me , ”
44230	44242	44244	44245	Mr. Guppy	297	“ how well I know that picture ! I ’m dashed , ”
44250	44269	44244	44245	Mr. Guppy	297	“ if I do n’t think I must have had a dream of that picture , you know ! ”
44459	44484	44451	44451	her	264	“ The terrace below is much admired . It is called , from an old story in the family , the Ghost ’s Walk . ”
44485	44488	44490	44491	Mr. Guppy	297	“ No ? ”
44496	44511	44490	44491	Mr. Guppy	297	“ What ’s the story , miss ? Is it anything about a picture ? ”
44512	44519	44521	44521	Watt	331	“ Pray tell us the story , ”
44527	44536	44521	44521	Watt	331	“ I do n’t know it , sir . ”
44543	44556	44558	44559	the housekeeper	944	“ It is not related to visitors ; it is almost forgotten , ”
44563	44574	44558	44559	the housekeeper	944	“ It has never been more than a family anecdote . ”
44575	44594	44596	44597	Mr. Guppy	297	“ You ’ll excuse my asking again if it has anything to do with a picture , ma’am , ”
44599	44626	44596	44597	Mr. Guppy	297	“ because I do assure you that the more I think of that picture the better I know it , without knowing how I know it ! ”
44731	44805	44714	44714	She	328	“ In the wicked days , my dears , of King Charles the First — I mean , of course , in the wicked days of the rebels who leagued themselves against that excellent king — Sir Morbury Dedlock was the owner of Chesney Wold . Whether there was any account of a ghost in the family before those days , I ca n’t say . I should think it very likely indeed . ”
44855	44860	44862	44863	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ Sir Morbury Dedlock , ”
44865	44986	44862	44863	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ was , I have no occasion to say , on the side of the blessed martyr . But it IS supposed that his Lady , who had none of the family blood in her veins , favoured the bad cause . It is said that she had relations among King Charles ’s enemies , that she was in correspondence with them , and that she gave them information . When any of the country gentlemen who followed his Majesty ’s cause met here , it is said that my Lady was always nearer to the door of their council - room than they supposed . Do you hear a sound like a footstep passing along the terrace , Watt ? ”
44994	45005	45007	45009	the young man	1916	“ I hear the rain - drip on the stones , ”
45011	45032	45007	45009	the young man	1916	“ and I hear a curious echo — I suppose an echo — which is very like a halting step . ”
45040	45251	45033	45034	The housekeeper	944	“ Partly on account of this division between them , and partly on other accounts , Sir Morbury and his Lady led a troubled life . She was a lady of a haughty temper . They were not well suited to each other in age or character , and they had no children to moderate between them . After her favourite brother , a young gentleman , was killed in the civil wars ( by Sir Morbury ’s near kinsman ) , her feeling was so violent that she hated the race into which she had married . When the Dedlocks were about to ride out from Chesney Wold in the king ’s cause , she is supposed to have more than once stolen down into the stables in the dead of night and lamed their horses ; and the story is that once at such an hour , her husband saw her gliding down the stairs and followed her into the stall where his own favourite horse stood . There he seized her by the wrist , and in a struggle or in a fall or through the horse being frightened and lashing out , she was lamed in the hip and from that hour began to pine away . ”
45266	45471	45472	45472	Watt	331	“ She had been a lady of a handsome figure and a noble carriage . She never complained of the change ; she never spoke to any one of being crippled or of being in pain , but day by day she tried to walk upon the terrace , and with the help of the stone balustrade , went up and down , up and down , up and down , in sun and shadow , with greater difficulty every day . At last , one afternoon her husband ( to whom she had never , on any persuasion , opened her lips since that night ) , standing at the great south window , saw her drop upon the pavement . He hastened down to raise her , but she repulsed him as he bent over her , and looking at him fixedly and coldly , said , ‘ I will die here where I have walked . And I will walk here , though I am in my grave . I will walk here until the pride of this house is humbled . And when calamity or when disgrace is coming to it , let the Dedlocks listen for my step ! ’ ”
45494	45506	45508	45509	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ There and then she died . And from those days , ”
45511	45579	45508	45509	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ the name has come down — the Ghost ’s Walk . If the tread is an echo , it is an echo that is only heard after dark , and is often unheard for a long while together . But it comes back from time to time ; and so sure as there is sickness or death in the family , it will be heard then . ”
45580	45586	45588	45588	Watt	331	“ And disgrace , grandmother — ”
45590	45598	45600	45601	the housekeeper	944	“ Disgrace never comes to Chesney Wold , ”
45607	45612	45603	45603	Her	944	“ True . True . ”
45613	45630	45632	45633	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ That is the story . Whatever the sound is , it is a worrying sound , ”
45641	45726	45632	45633	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	“ and what is to be noticed in it is that it MUST BE HEARD . My Lady , who is afraid of nothing , admits that when it is there , it must be heard . You can not shut it out . Watt , there is a tall French clock behind you ( placed there , ’ a purpose ) that has a loud beat when it is in motion and can play music . You understand how those things are managed ? ”
45727	45736	45603	45603	Her	944	“ Pretty well , grandmother , I think . ”
45737	45744	45745	45745	Watt	331	“ Set it a - going . ”
45756	45762	45764	45765	the housekeeper	944	“ Now , come hither , ”
45767	45812	45764	45765	the housekeeper	944	“ Hither , child , towards my Lady ’s pillow . I am not sure that it is dark enough yet , but listen ! Can you hear the sound upon the terrace , through the music , and the beat , and everything ? ”
45813	45818	45603	45603	Her	944	“ I certainly can ! ”
45819	45825	45764	45765	the housekeeper	944	“ So my Lady says . ”
46701	46766	46696	46697	The drone	2007	“ You will excuse me ; I really can not attend to the shop ! I find myself in a world in which there is so much to see and so short a time to see it in that I must take the liberty of looking about me and begging to be provided for by somebody who does n’t want to look about him . ”
46964	46971	46973	46974	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ Sit down , my dear , ”
46976	47000	46973	46974	Mr. Jarndyce	286	“ This , you must know , is the growlery . When I am out of humour , I come and growl here . ”
47001	47011	47013	47013	I.	0	“ You must be here very seldom , sir , ”
47014	47023	47024	47024	he	286	“ Oh , you do n’t know me ! ”
47027	47079	47080	47080	I	0	“ When I am deceived or disappointed in — the wind , and it ’s easterly , I take refuge here . The growlery is the best - used room in the house . You are not aware of half my humours yet . My dear , how you are trembling ! ”
47191	47196	47197	47197	he	286	“ There ! There ! ”
47200	47212	47197	47197	he	286	“ That ’s over . Pooh ! Do n’t be foolish . ”
47213	47222	47223	47223	I	0	“ It shall not happen again , sir , ”
47226	47234	47223	47223	I	0	“ but at first it is difficult — ”
47235	47238	47239	47239	he	286	“ Nonsense ! ”
47242	47331	47239	47239	he	286	“ It ’s easy , easy . Why not ? I hear of a good little orphan girl without a protector , and I take it into my head to be that protector . She grows up , and more than justifies my good opinion , and I remain her guardian and her friend . What is there in all this ? So , so ! Now , we have cleared off old scores , and I have before me thy pleasant , trusting , trusty face again . ”
47337	47357	47332	47332	I	0	“ Esther , my dear , you surprise me ! This really is not what I expected of you ! ”
47425	47431	47432	47432	he	286	“ Of course , Esther , ”
47435	47444	47432	47432	he	286	“ you do n’t understand this Chancery business ? ”
47453	47461	47462	47462	he	286	“ I do n’t know who does , ”
47465	47598	47432	47432	he	286	“ The lawyers have twisted it into such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case have long disappeared from the face of the earth . It ’s about a will and the trusts under a will — or it was once . It ’s about nothing but costs now . We are always appearing , and disappearing , and swearing , and interrogating , and filing , and cross - filing , and arguing , and sealing , and motioning , and referring , and reporting , and revolving about the Lord Chancellor and all his satellites , and equitably waltzing ourselves off to dusty death , about costs . That ’s the great question . All the rest , by some extraordinary means , has melted away . ”
47599	47606	47608	47608	I	0	“ But it was , sir , ”
47623	47628	47616	47616	he	286	“ about a will ? ”
47629	47645	47646	47646	he	286	“ Why , yes , it was about a will when it was about anything , ”
47649	48036	47646	47646	he	286	“ A certain Jarndyce , in an evil hour , made a great fortune , and made a great will . In the question how the trusts under that will are to be administered , the fortune left by the will is squandered away ; the legatees under the will are reduced to such a miserable condition that they would be sufficiently punished if they had committed an enormous crime in having money left them , and the will itself is made a dead letter . All through the deplorable cause , everything that everybody in it , except one man , knows already is referred to that only one man who do n’t know , it to find out — all through the deplorable cause , everybody must have copies , over and over again , of everything that has accumulated about it in the way of cartloads of papers ( or must pay for them without having them , which is the usual course , for nobody wants them ) and must go down the middle and up again through such an infernal country - dance of costs and fees and nonsense and corruption as was never dreamed of in the wildest visions of a witch ’s Sabbath . Equity sends questions to law , law sends questions back to equity ; law finds it ca n’t do this , equity finds it ca n’t do that ; neither can so much as say it ca n’t do anything , without this solicitor instructing and this counsel appearing for A , and that solicitor instructing and that counsel appearing for B ; and so on through the whole alphabet , like the history of the apple pie . And thus , through years and years , and lives and lives , everything goes on , constantly beginning over and over again , and nothing ever ends . And we ca n’t get out of the suit on any terms , for we are made parties to it , and MUST BE parties to it , whether we like it or not . But it wo n’t do to think of it ! When my great uncle , poor Tom Jarndyce , began to think of it , it was the beginning of the end ! ”
48037	48050	48051	48051	He	2017	“ The Mr. Jarndyce , sir , whose story I have heard ? ”
48055	48090	48051	48051	He	2017	“ I was his heir , and this was his house , Esther . When I came here , it was bleak indeed . He had left the signs of his misery upon it . ”
48091	48099	48100	48100	I	0	“ How changed it must be now ! ”
48103	48225	48100	48100	I	0	“ It had been called , before his time , the Peaks . He gave it its present name and lived here shut up , day and night poring over the wicked heaps of papers in the suit and hoping against hope to disentangle it from its mystification and bring it to a close . In the meantime , the place became dilapidated , the wind whistled through the cracked walls , the rain fell through the broken roof , the weeds choked the passage to the rotting door . When I brought what remained of him home here , the brains seemed to me to have been blown out of the house too , it was so shattered and ruined . ”
48264	48280	48281	48281	I	0	“ I told you this was the growlery , my dear . Where was I ? ”
48296	48512	48281	48281	I	0	“ Bleak House ; true . There is , in that city of London there , some property of ours which is much at this day what Bleak House was then ; I say property of ours , meaning of the suit ’s , but I ought to call it the property of costs , for costs is the only power on earth that will ever get anything out of it now or will ever know it for anything but an eyesore and a heartsore . It is a street of perishing blind houses , with their eyes stoned out , without a pane of glass , without so much as a window - frame , with the bare blank shutters tumbling from their hinges and falling asunder , the iron rails peeling away in flakes of rust , the chimneys sinking in , the stone steps to every door ( and every door might be death ’s door ) turning stagnant green , the very crutches on which the ruins are propped decaying . Although Bleak House was not in Chancery , its master was , and it was stamped with the same seal . These are the Great Seal ’s impressions , my dear , all over England — the children know them ! ”
48513	48519	48520	48520	I	0	“ How changed it is ! ”
48524	48531	48532	48532	he	2019	“ Why , so it is , ”
48538	48556	48532	48532	he	2019	“ and it is wisdom in you to keep me to the bright side of the picture . ”
48565	48597	48532	48532	he	2019	“ These are things I never talk about or even think about , excepting in the growlery here . If you consider it right to mention them to Rick and Ada , ”
48603	48616	48532	48532	he	2019	“ you can . I leave it to your discretion , Esther . ”
48617	48623	48625	48625	I.	0	“ I hope , sir — ”
48626	48639	48625	48625	I.	0	“ I think you had better call me guardian , my dear . ”
48654	48662	48663	48663	he	2020	“ Esther , now , you know you are!”—when
48719	48725	48727	48727	I	0	“ I hope , guardian , ”
48729	48791	48727	48727	I	0	“ that you may not trust too much to my discretion . I hope you may not mistake me . I am afraid it will be a disappointment to you to know that I am not clever , but it really is the truth , and you would soon find it out if I had not the honesty to confess it . ”
48833	48842	48844	48844	I	0	“ I hope I may turn out so , ”
48846	48857	48844	48844	I	0	“ but I am much afraid of it , guardian . ”
48858	48877	48878	48878	he	2020	“ You are clever enough to be the good little woman of our lives here , my dear , ”
48882	48901	48878	48878	he	2020	“ the little old woman of the child ’s ( I do n’t mean Skimpole ’s ) rhyme : “
48924	48925	48926	48926	You	0	” “
48963	49013	48926	48926	You	0	” This was the beginning of my being called Old Woman , and Little Old Woman , and Cobweb , and Mrs. Shipton , and Mother Hubbard , and Dame Durden , and so many names of that sort that my own name soon became quite lost among them . “
49016	49021	49070	49070	Esther	280	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
49048	49065	49070	49070	Esther	280	” Oh , my goodness , the idea of asking my advice on such a point ! “
49072	49090	49067	49067	he	317	” said Mr. Jarndyce , comfortably putting his hands into his pockets and stretching out his legs . “
49124	49125	49129	49129	guardian	10146	” “
49131	49134	49129	49129	guardian	10146	” said I. “
49138	49142	49129	49129	guardian	10146	” said he . “
49316	49395	49307	49307	I	0	” He began to rub his head again and to hint that he felt the wind . But it was a delightful instance of his kindness towards me that whether he rubbed his head , or walked about , or did both , his face was sure to recover its benignant expression as it looked at mine ; and he was sure to turn comfortable again and put his hands in his pockets and stretch out his legs . “
49406	49410	49307	49307	I	0	” said I , “
49421	49422	49416	49416	he	2036	” “
49426	49430	49416	49416	he	2036	” he returned . “
49489	49586	49486	49487	little woman	2039	” I really was frightened at the thought of the importance I was attaining and the number of things that were being confided to me . I had not meant this at all ; I had meant that he should speak to Richard . But of course I said nothing in reply except that I would do my best , though I feared ( I really felt it necessary to repeat this ) that he thought me much more sagacious than I was . At which my guardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard . “
49589	49600	49486	49487	little woman	2039	” he said , rising and pushing back his chair . “
49632	49652	49625	49625	you	280	” He looked so attentively at me that I looked attentively at him and felt sure I understood him . “
49658	49661	49625	49625	you	280	” said I. “
49664	49665	49625	49625	you	280	” “
49668	49691	49666	49666	Guardian	10146	” said I , venturing to put my hand , which was suddenly colder than I could have wished , in his , “
49759	50512	50515	50516	young ladies	2045	” He drew my hand through his arm and we went away to look for Ada . From that hour I felt quite easy with him , quite unreserved , quite content to know no more , quite happy . We lived , at first , rather a busy life at Bleak House , for we had to become acquainted with many residents in and out of the neighbourhood who knew Mr. Jarndyce . It seemed to Ada and me that everybody knew him who wanted to do anything with anybody else ’s money . It amazed us when we began to sort his letters and to answer some of them for him in the growlery of a morning to find how the great object of the lives of nearly all his correspondents appeared to be to form themselves into committees for getting in and laying out money . The ladies were as desperate as the gentlemen ; indeed , I think they were even more so . They threw themselves into committees in the most impassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite extraordinary . It appeared to us that some of them must pass their whole lives in dealing out subscription - cards to the whole post - office directory — shilling cards , half - crown cards , half - sovereign cards , penny cards . They wanted everything . They wanted wearing apparel , they wanted linen rags , they wanted money , they wanted coals , they wanted soup , they wanted interest , they wanted autographs , they wanted flannel , they wanted whatever Mr. Jarndyce had — or had not . Their objects were as various as their demands . They were going to raise new buildings , they were going to pay off debts on old buildings , they were going to establish in a picturesque building ( engraving of proposed west elevation attached ) the Sisterhood of Mediaeval Marys , they were going to give a testimonial to Mrs. Jellyby , they were going to have their secretary ’s portrait painted and presented to his mother - in - law , whose deep devotion to him was well known , they were going to get up everything , I really believe , from five hundred thousand tracts to an annuity and from a marble monument to a silver tea - pot . They took a multitude of titles . They were the Women of England , the Daughters of Britain , the Sisters of all the cardinal virtues separately , the Females of America , the Ladies of a hundred denominations . They appeared to be always excited about canvassing and electing . They seemed to our poor wits , and according to their own accounts , to be constantly polling people by tens of thousands , yet never bringing their candidates in for anything . It made our heads ache to think , on the whole , what feverish lives they must lead . Among the ladies who were most distinguished for this rapacious benevolence ( if I may use the expression ) was a Mrs. Pardiggle , who seemed , as I judged from the number of her letters to Mr. Jarndyce , to be almost as powerful a correspondent as Mrs. Jellyby herself . We observed that the wind always changed when Mrs. Pardiggle became the subject of conversation and that it invariably interrupted Mr. Jarndyce and prevented his going any farther , when he had remarked that there were two classes of charitable people ; one , the people who did a little and made a great deal of noise ; the other , the people who did a great deal and made no noise at all . We were therefore curious to see Mrs. Pardiggle , suspecting her to be a type of the former class , and were glad when she called one day with her five young sons . She was a formidable style of lady with spectacles , a prominent nose , and a loud voice , who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room . And she really did , for she knocked down little chairs with her skirts that were quite a great way off . As only Ada and I were at home , we received her timidly , for she seemed to come in like cold weather and to make the little Pardiggles blue as they followed . “
50518	50530	50515	50516	young ladies	2045	” said Mrs. Pardiggle with great volubility after the first salutations , “
50684	50806	50807	50807	You	2056	” We had never seen such dissatisfied children . It was not merely that they were weazened and shrivelled — though they were certainly that too — but they looked absolutely ferocious with discontent . At the mention of the Tockahoopo Indians , I could really have supposed Egbert to be one of the most baleful members of that tribe , he gave me such a savage frown . The face of each child , as the amount of his contribution was mentioned , darkened in a peculiarly vindictive manner , but his was by far the worst . I must except , however , the little recruit into the Infant Bonds of Joy , who was stolidly and evenly miserable . “
50815	50820	50807	50807	You	2056	” said Mrs. Pardiggle , “
50826	50838	50839	50840	Mrs. Jellyby	294	” We said yes , we had passed one night there . “
50842	50900	50839	50840	Mrs. Jellyby	294	” pursued the lady , always speaking in the same demonstrative , loud , hard tone , so that her voice impressed my fancy as if it had a sort of spectacles on too — and I may take the opportunity of remarking that her spectacles were made the less engaging by her eyes being what Ada called “
50904	50907	50839	50840	Mrs. Jellyby	294	” meaning very prominent—“Mrs
51050	51092	51093	51093	They	2061	” I was afterwards convinced ( and so was Ada ) that from the ill - conditioned eldest child , these words extorted a sharp yell . He turned it off into a yawn , but it began as a yell . “
51125	51131	51133	51133	they	2061	” said Mrs. Pardiggle rapidly , “
51357	51378	51379	51379	You	2075	” Alfred glowered at us as if he never could , or would , forgive the injury of that night . “
51387	51392	51379	51379	You	2075	” said Mrs. Pardiggle , “
51516	51574	51575	51575	You	2082	” Suppose Mr. Pardiggle were to dine with Mr. Jellyby , and suppose Mr. Jellyby were to relieve his mind after dinner to Mr. Pardiggle , would Mr. Pardiggle , in return , make any confidential communication to Mr. Jellyby ? I was quite confused to find myself thinking this , but it came into my head . “
51582	51622	51575	51575	You	2082	” said Mrs. Pardiggle . We were glad to change the subject , and going to the window , pointed out the beauties of the prospect , on which the spectacles appeared to me to rest with curious indifference . “
51628	51650	51625	51626	Mr. Gusher	355	” said our visitor . We were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher ’s acquaintance . “
51660	51669	51656	51656	I	0	” said Mrs. Pardiggle with her commanding deportment . “
51731	51766	51770	51770	you	2082	” said Mrs. Pardiggle , moving back to her chair and overturning , as if by invisible agency , a little round table at a considerable distance with my work - basket on it , “
51780	51825	51770	51770	you	2082	” This was really such a confusing question that Ada looked at me in perfect dismay . As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness after what I had been thinking , it must have been expressed in the colour of my cheeks . “
51832	51837	51829	51829	I	0	” said Mrs. Pardiggle , “
51916	51953	51954	51954	I	0	” We murmured that it was very astonishing and very gratifying , or something to that effect . I do n’t think we knew what it was either , but this is what our politeness expressed . “
51974	51979	51965	51965	you	2089	” said Mrs. Pardiggle . “
52045	52099	52032	52032	I	0	” If that dark - visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he had already looked , this was the time when he did it . I observed that he doubled his right fist and delivered a secret blow into the crown of his cap , which was under his left arm . “
52113	52118	52032	52032	I	0	” said Mrs. Pardiggle . “
52194	52393	52394	52394	You	2094	” At first I tried to excuse myself for the present on the general ground of having occupations to attend to which I must not neglect . But as this was an ineffectual protest , I then said , more particularly , that I was not sure of my qualifications . That I was inexperienced in the art of adapting my mind to minds very differently situated , and addressing them from suitable points of view . That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which must be essential to such a work . That I had much to learn , myself , before I could teach others , and that I could not confide in my good intentions alone . For these reasons I thought it best to be as useful as I could , and to render what kind services I could to those immediately about me , and to try to let that circle of duty gradually and naturally expand itself . All this I said with anything but confidence , because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older than I , and had great experience , and was so very military in her manners . “
52401	52405	52394	52394	You	2094	” said she , “
52486	52719	52479	52479	she	290	” Ada and I interchanged looks , and as we were going out in any case , accepted the offer . When we hastily returned from putting on our bonnets , we found the young family languishing in a corner and Mrs. Pardiggle sweeping about the room , knocking down nearly all the light objects it contained . Mrs. Pardiggle took possession of Ada , and I followed with the family . Ada told me afterwards that Mrs. Pardiggle talked in the same loud tone ( that , indeed , I overheard ) all the way to the brickmaker ’s about an exciting contest which she had for two or three years waged against another lady relative to the bringing in of their rival candidates for a pension somewhere . There had been a quantity of printing , and promising , and proxying , and polling , and it appeared to have imparted great liveliness to all concerned , except the pensioners — who were not elected yet . I am very fond of being confided in by children and am happy in being usually favoured in that respect , but on this occasion it gave me great uneasiness . As soon as we were out of doors , Egbert , with the manner of a little footpad , demanded a shilling of me on the ground that his pocket - money was “
52721	52747	52749	52749	her	2098	” from him . On my pointing out the great impropriety of the word , especially in connexion with his parent ( for he added sulkily “
52751	52760	52749	52749	her	2098	” ) , he pinched me and said , “
52816	53289	52803	52803	you	2099	” These exasperating questions so inflamed his mind and the minds of Oswald and Francis that they all pinched me at once , and in a dreadfully expert way — screwing up such little pieces of my arms that I could hardly forbear crying out . Felix , at the same time , stamped upon my toes . And the Bond of Joy , who on account of always having the whole of his little income anticipated stood in fact pledged to abstain from cakes as well as tobacco , so swelled with grief and rage when we passed a pastry - cook ’s shop that he terrified me by becoming purple . I never underwent so much , both in body and mind , in the course of a walk with young people as from these unnaturally constrained children when they paid me the compliment of being natural . I was glad when we came to the brickmaker ’s house , though it was one of a cluster of wretched hovels in a brick - field , with pigsties close to the broken windows and miserable little gardens before the doors growing nothing but stagnant pools . Here and there an old tub was put to catch the droppings of rain - water from a roof , or they were banked up with mud into a little pond like a large dirt - pie . At the doors and windows some men and women lounged or prowled about , and took little notice of us except to laugh to one another or to say something as we passed about gentlefolks minding their own business and not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coming to look after other people ’s . Mrs. Pardiggle , leading the way with a great show of moral determination and talking with much volubility about the untidy habits of the people ( though I doubted if the best of us could have been tidy in such a place ) , conducted us into a cottage at the farthest corner , the ground - floor room of which we nearly filled . Besides ourselves , there were in this damp , offensive room a woman with a black eye , nursing a poor little gasping baby by the fire ; a man , all stained with clay and mud and looking very dissipated , lying at full length on the ground , smoking a pipe ; a powerful young man fastening a collar on a dog ; and a bold girl doing some kind of washing in very dirty water . They all looked up at us as we came in , and the woman seemed to turn her face towards the fire as if to hide her bruised eye ; nobody gave us any welcome . “
53295	53322	52803	52803	you	2099	” said Mrs. Pardiggle , but her voice had not a friendly sound , I thought ; it was much too business - like and systematic . “
53364	53365	53350	53350	I	0	” “
53369	53389	53350	53350	I	0	” growled the man on the floor , whose head rested on his hand as he stared at us , “
53401	53402	53350	53350	I	0	” “
53408	53423	53350	53350	I	0	” said Mrs. Pardiggle , seating herself on one stool and knocking down another . “
53429	53430	53350	53350	I	0	” “
53442	53499	53500	53500	You	1582	” said the man , with his pipe between his lips as he looked round upon us . The young man and the girl both laughed . Two friends of the young man , whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with their hands in their pockets , echoed the laugh noisily . “
53509	53517	53500	53500	You	1582	” said Mrs. Pardiggle to these latter . “
53536	53537	53532	53532	I	0	” “
53545	53553	53532	53532	I	0	” growled the man upon the floor . “
53911	54258	53906	53906	she	2117	” He had pulled his pipe out of his mouth to say all this , and he now turned over on his other side and smoked again . Mrs. Pardiggle , who had been regarding him through her spectacles with a forcible composure , calculated , I could not help thinking , to increase his antagonism , pulled out a good book as if it were a constable ’s staff and took the whole family into custody . I mean into religious custody , of course ; but she really did it as if she were an inexorable moral policeman carrying them all off to a station - house . Ada and I were very uncomfortable . We both felt intrusive and out of place , and we both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on infinitely better if she had not had such a mechanical way of taking possession of people . The children sulked and stared ; the family took no notice of us whatever , except when the young man made the dog bark , which he usually did when Mrs. Pardiggle was most emphatic . We both felt painfully sensible that between us and these people there was an iron barrier which could not be removed by our new friend . By whom or how it could be removed , we did not know , but we knew that . Even what she read and said seemed to us to be ill - chosen for such auditors , if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so much tact . As to the little book to which the man on the floor had referred , we acquired a knowledge of it afterwards , and Mr. Jarndyce said he doubted if Robinson Crusoe could have read it , though he had had no other on his desolate island . We were much relieved , under these circumstances , when Mrs. Pardiggle left off . The man on the floor , then turning his head round again , said morosely , “
54268	54269	54266	54266	you	2118	” “
54298	54306	54287	54287	I	0	” returned Mrs. Pardiggle with demonstrative cheerfulness . “
54314	54329	54330	54330	you	9883	” said he , folding his arms and shutting his eyes with an oath , “
54337	54572	54575	54575	Esther	280	” Mrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little vortex in the confined room from which the pipe itself very narrowly escaped . Taking one of her young family in each hand , and telling the others to follow closely , and expressing her hope that the brickmaker and all his house would be improved when she saw them next , she then proceeded to another cottage . I hope it is not unkind in me to say that she certainly did make , in this as in everything else , a show that was not conciliatory of doing charity by wholesale and of dealing in it to a large extent . She supposed that we were following her , but as soon as the space was left clear , we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask if the baby were ill . She only looked at it as it lay on her lap . We had observed before that when she looked at it she covered her discoloured eye with her hand , as though she wished to separate any association with noise and violence and ill treatment from the poor little child . Ada , whose gentle heart was moved by its appearance , bent down to touch its little face . As she did so , I saw what happened and drew her back . The child died . “
54577	54588	54575	54575	Esther	280	” cried Ada , sinking on her knees beside it . “
54644	54858	54859	54859	Jenny	357	” Such compassion , such gentleness , as that with which she bent down weeping and put her hand upon the mother ’s might have softened any mother ’s heart that ever beat . The woman at first gazed at her in astonishment and then burst into tears . Presently I took the light burden from her lap , did what I could to make the baby ’s rest the prettier and gentler , laid it on a shelf , and covered it with my own handkerchief . We tried to comfort the mother , and we whispered to her what Our Saviour said of children . She answered nothing , but sat weeping — weeping very much . When I turned , I found that the young man had taken out the dog and was standing at the door looking in upon us with dry eyes , but quiet . The girl was quiet too and sat in a corner looking on the ground . The man had risen . He still smoked his pipe with an air of defiance , but he was silent . An ugly woman , very poorly clothed , hurried in while I was glancing at them , and coming straight up to the mother , said , “
54863	54936	54937	54937	Jenny	357	” The mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman ’s neck . She also had upon her face and arms the marks of ill usage . She had no kind of grace about her , but the grace of sympathy ; but when she condoled with the woman , and her own tears fell , she wanted no beauty . I say condoled , but her only words were “
54941	55360	54939	54939	Jenny	357	” All the rest was in the tone in which she said them . I thought it very touching to see these two women , coarse and shabby and beaten , so united ; to see what they could be to one another ; to see how they felt for one another , how the heart of each to each was softened by the hard trials of their lives . I think the best side of such people is almost hidden from us . What the poor are to the poor is little known , excepting to themselves and God . We felt it better to withdraw and leave them uninterrupted . We stole out quietly and without notice from any one except the man . He was leaning against the wall near the door , and finding that there was scarcely room for us to pass , went out before us . He seemed to want to hide that he did this on our account , but we perceived that he did , and thanked him . He made no answer . Ada was so full of grief all the way home , and Richard , whom we found at home , was so distressed to see her in tears ( though he said to me , when she was not present , how beautiful it was too ! ) , that we arranged to return at night with some little comforts and repeat our visit at the brick - maker ’s house . We said as little as we could to Mr. Jarndyce , but the wind changed directly . Richard accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning expedition . On our way there , we had to pass a noisy drinking - house , where a number of men were flocking about the door . Among them , and prominent in some dispute , was the father of the little child . At a short distance , we passed the young man and the dog , in congenial company . The sister was standing laughing and talking with some other young women at the corner of the row of cottages , but she seemed ashamed and turned away as we went by . We left our escort within sight of the brickmaker ’s dwelling and proceeded by ourselves . When we came to the door , we found the woman who had brought such consolation with her standing there looking anxiously out . “
55371	55378	55379	55379	I	0	” she said in a whisper . “
55412	55413	55405	55405	he	2127	” “
55420	55423	55405	55405	he	2127	” said I. “
55473	55587	55460	55460	I	0	” As she gave way for us , she went softly in and put what we had brought near the miserable bed on which the mother slept . No effort had been made to clean the room — it seemed in its nature almost hopeless of being clean ; but the small waxen form from which so much solemnity diffused itself had been composed afresh , and washed , and neatly dressed in some fragments of white linen ; and on my handkerchief , which still covered the poor baby , a little bunch of sweet herbs had been laid by the same rough , scarred hands , so lightly , so tenderly ! “
55593	55599	55460	55460	I	0	” we said to her . “
55606	55607	55608	55608	Me	0	” “
55613	55619	55608	55608	Me	0	” she returned with surprise . “
55626	55782	55783	55783	Jenny	357	” The mother had moaned in her sleep and moved . The sound of the familiar voice seemed to calm her again . She was quiet once more . How little I thought , when I raised my handkerchief to look upon the tiny sleeper underneath and seemed to see a halo shine around the child through Ada ’s drooping hair as her pity bent her head — how little I thought in whose unquiet bosom that handkerchief would come to lie after covering the motionless and peaceful breast ! I only thought that perhaps the Angel of the child might not be all unconscious of the woman who replaced it with so compassionate a hand ; not all unconscious of her presently , when we had taken leave , and left her at the door , by turns looking , and listening in terror for herself , and saying in her old soothing manner , “
55787	55854	55785	55785	Jenny	357	” CHAPTER IX Signs and Tokens I do n’t know how it is I seem to be always writing about myself . I mean all the time to write about other people , and I try to think about myself as little as possible , and I am sure , when I find myself coming into the story again , I am really vexed and say , “
55870	56175	55866	55866	you	1110	” but it is all of no use . I hope any one who may read what I write will understand that if these pages contain a great deal about me , I can only suppose it must be because I have really something to do with them and ca n’t be kept out . My darling and I read together , and worked , and practised , and found so much employment for our time that the winter days flew by us like bright - winged birds . Generally in the afternoons , and always in the evenings , Richard gave us his company . Although he was one of the most restless creatures in the world , he certainly was very fond of our society . He was very , very , very fond of Ada . I mean it , and I had better say it at once . I had never seen any young people falling in love before , but I found them out quite soon . I could not say so , of course , or show that I knew anything about it . On the contrary , I was so demure and used to seem so unconscious that sometimes I considered within myself while I was sitting at work whether I was not growing quite deceitful . But there was no help for it . All I had to do was to be quiet , and I was as quiet as a mouse . They were as quiet as mice too , so far as any words were concerned , but the innocent manner in which they relied more and more upon me as they took more and more to one another was so charming that I had great difficulty in not showing how it interested me . “
56188	56216	56183	56186	a capital old woman	2140	” Richard would say , coming up to meet me in the garden early , with his pleasant laugh and perhaps the least tinge of a blush , “
56284	56285	56286	56286	You	2145	” “
56294	56316	56289	56290	Dame Durden	343	” Ada would say at night , with her head upon my shoulder and the firelight shining in her thoughtful eyes , “
56357	56506	56351	56353	the poor sailors	2149	” Ah ! Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor . We had talked it over very often now , and there was some talk of gratifying the inclination of his childhood for the sea . Mr. Jarndyce had written to a relation of the family , a great Sir Leicester Dedlock , for his interest in Richard ’s favour , generally ; and Sir Leicester had replied in a gracious manner that he would be happy to advance the prospects of the young gentleman if it should ever prove to be within his power , which was not at all probable , and that my Lady sent her compliments to the young gentleman ( to whom she perfectly remembered that she was allied by remote consanguinity ) and trusted that he would ever do his duty in any honourable profession to which he might devote himself . “
56515	56521	56508	56508	I	0	” said Richard to me , “
56599	56763	56766	56767	Mother Hubbard	342	” With a buoyancy and hopefulness and a gaiety that hardly ever flagged , Richard had a carelessness in his character that quite perplexed me , principally because he mistook it , in such a very odd way , for prudence . It entered into all his calculations about money in a singular manner which I do n’t think I can better explain than by reverting for a moment to our loan to Mr. Skimpole . Mr. Jarndyce had ascertained the amount , either from Mr. Skimpole himself or from Coavinses , and had placed the money in my hands with instructions to me to retain my own part of it and hand the rest to Richard . The number of little acts of thoughtless expenditure which Richard justified by the recovery of his ten pounds , and the number of times he talked to me as if he had saved or realized that amount , would form a sum in simple addition . “
56772	56794	56766	56767	Mother Hubbard	342	” he said to me when he wanted , without the least consideration , to bestow five pounds on the brickmaker . “
56808	56809	56795	56795	I	0	” “
56814	56817	56795	56795	I	0	” said I. “
56849	56850	56843	56843	You	0	” “
56853	56856	56843	56843	You	0	” said I. “
56869	56870	56861	56861	I	0	” “
56876	56880	56861	56861	I	0	” I hinted . “
56889	56893	56894	56894	I	0	” returned Richard . “
56918	56959	56961	56961	me	0	” In exactly the same way , when he was persuaded out of the sacrifice of these five pounds by being convinced that it would do no good , he carried that sum to his credit and drew upon it . “
56964	56969	56961	56961	me	0	” he would say . “
57035	57248	57250	57250	Boythorn	359	” I believe Richard ’s was as frank and generous a nature as there possibly can be . He was ardent and brave , and in the midst of all his wild restlessness , was so gentle that I knew him like a brother in a few weeks . His gentleness was natural to him and would have shown itself abundantly even without Ada ’s influence ; but with it , he became one of the most winning of companions , always so ready to be interested and always so happy , sanguine , and light - hearted . I am sure that I , sitting with them , and walking with them , and talking with them , and noticing from day to day how they went on , falling deeper and deeper in love , and saying nothing about it , and each shyly thinking that this love was the greatest of secrets , perhaps not yet suspected even by the other — I am sure that I was scarcely less enchanted than they were and scarcely less pleased with the pretty dream . We were going on in this way , when one morning at breakfast Mr. Jarndyce received a letter , and looking at the superscription , said , “
57256	57284	57250	57250	Boythorn	359	” and opened and read it with evident pleasure , announcing to us in a parenthesis when he was about half - way through , that Boythorn was “
57287	57330	57331	57331	I	0	” on a visit . Now who was Boythorn , we all thought . And I dare say we all thought too — I am sure I did , for one — would Boythorn at all interfere with what was going forward ? “
57342	57358	57339	57340	Lawrence Boythorn	359	” said Mr. Jarndyce , tapping the letter as he laid it on the table , “
57433	57434	57429	57431	a tremendous fellow	2168	” “
57440	57444	57429	57431	a tremendous fellow	2168	” asked Richard . “
57454	57459	57448	57448	Rick	317	” said Mr. Jarndyce ; “
57525	57557	57564	57565	the man	1619	” As Mr. Jarndyce sat enjoying the image of his friend Boythorn , we observed the favourable omen that there was not the least indication of any change in the wind . “
57611	57615	57603	57604	a visitor	2179	” he pursued . “
57738	57742	57735	57736	his man	2184	” to me , “
57752	57853	57735	57736	his man	2184	” I took care that the necessary preparations were made for Mr. Boythorn ’s reception , and we looked forward to his arrival with some curiosity . The afternoon wore away , however , and he did not appear . The dinner - hour arrived , and still he did not appear . The dinner was put back an hour , and we were sitting round the fire with no light but the blaze when the hall - door suddenly burst open and the hall resounded with these words , uttered with the greatest vehemence and in a stentorian tone : “
57925	57926	57928	57928	he	2187	” “
57934	57939	57928	57928	he	2187	” Mr. Jarndyce inquired . “
57958	57963	57951	57951	his	2194	” returned the other . “
58011	58012	57995	57995	I	0	” “
58018	58023	57995	57995	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
58030	58043	57995	57995	I	0	” laughed Mr. Lawrence Boythorn , really making the whole house vibrate . “
58129	58130	58120	58120	I	0	” “
58138	58143	58120	58120	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
58151	58152	58147	58147	you	0	” “
58159	58172	58147	58147	you	0	” returned his guest , who seemed to refer to his watch , “
58212	58213	58206	58206	myself	0	” “
58222	58227	58206	58206	myself	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
58236	58241	58242	58242	I	0	” cried the visitor . “
58277	58294	58267	58267	I	0	” Talking thus , they went upstairs , and presently we heard him in his bedroom thundering “
58301	58304	58267	58267	I	0	” and again “
58311	58637	58267	58267	I	0	” until the flattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion and to laugh as enjoyingly as he did or as we did when we heard him laugh . We all conceived a prepossession in his favour , for there was a sterling quality in this laugh , and in his vigorous , healthy voice , and in the roundness and fullness with which he uttered every word he spoke , and in the very fury of his superlatives , which seemed to go off like blank cannons and hurt nothing . But we were hardly prepared to have it so confirmed by his appearance when Mr. Jarndyce presented him . He was not only a very handsome old gentleman — upright and stalwart as he had been described to us — with a massive grey head , a fine composure of face when silent , a figure that might have become corpulent but for his being so continually in earnest that he gave it no rest , and a chin that might have subsided into a double chin but for the vehement emphasis in which it was constantly required to assist ; but he was such a true gentleman in his manner , so chivalrously polite , his face was lighted by a smile of so much sweetness and tenderness , and it seemed so plain that he had nothing to hide , but showed himself exactly as he was — incapable , as Richard said , of anything on a limited scale , and firing away with those blank great guns because he carried no small arms whatever — that really I could not help looking at him with equal pleasure as he sat at dinner , whether he smilingly conversed with Ada and me , or was led by Mr. Jarndyce into some great volley of superlatives , or threw up his head like a bloodhound and gave out that tremendous “
58644	58645	58267	58267	I	0	” “
58657	58662	58646	58646	You	2206	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
58675	58680	58681	58681	He	2207	” replied the other . “
58742	58829	58727	58728	his father	10032	” The subject of this laudation was a very little canary , who was so tame that he was brought down by Mr. Boythorn ’s man , on his forefinger , and after taking a gentle flight round the room , alighted on his master ’s head . To hear Mr. Boythorn presently expressing the most implacable and passionate sentiments , with this fragile mite of a creature quietly perched on his forehead , was to have a good illustration of his character , I thought . “
58836	58855	58727	58728	his father	10032	” he said , very gently holding up a bit of bread to the canary to peck at , “
58931	58948	58949	58949	I	0	” ( All this time the very small canary was eating out of his hand . ) “
58967	58974	58949	58949	I	0	” returned Mr. Jarndyce , laughing , “
58995	58996	58949	58949	I	0	” “
59014	59019	58949	58949	I	0	” said Mr. Boythorn . “
59095	59141	59065	59068	the Accountant - General	2217	” It was impossible not to laugh at the energetic gravity with which he recommended this strong measure of reform . When we laughed , he threw up his head and shook his broad chest , and again the whole country seemed to echo to his “
59148	59203	59065	59068	the Accountant - General	2217	” It had not the least effect in disturbing the bird , whose sense of security was complete and who hopped about the table with its quick head now on this side and now on that , turning its bright sudden eye on its master as if he were no more than another bird . “
59220	59225	59207	59207	you	2219	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
59238	59239	59240	59241	The fellow	2221	” “
59260	59265	59251	59251	I	0	” returned Mr. Boythorn . “
59294	59295	59291	59292	Sir Lucifer	360	” “
59302	59312	59291	59292	Sir Lucifer	360	” said my guardian laughingly to Ada and Richard . “
59326	59331	59313	59313	I	0	” resumed our visitor , “
59369	59370	59372	59372	he	2221	” “
59376	59380	59372	59372	he	2221	” suggested Richard . “
59385	59395	59372	59372	he	2221	” exclaimed Mr. Boythorn , suddenly firing another volley , “
59815	59918	59791	59791	He	2221	” To hear him say all this with unimaginable energy , one might have thought him the angriest of mankind . To see him at the very same time , looking at the bird now perched upon his thumb and softly smoothing its feathers with his forefinger , one might have thought him the gentlest . To hear him laugh and see the broad good nature of his face then , one might have supposed that he had not a care in the world , or a dispute , or a dislike , but that his whole existence was a summer joke . “
59923	59927	59791	59791	He	2221	” he said , “
59943	59951	59939	59939	I	0	” here he softened in a moment , “
60058	60059	60061	60076	the man to allow his junior to be walked over either ? ” said my guardian	10381	” “
60073	60078	60061	60076	the man to allow his junior to be walked over either ? ” said my guardian	10381	” said my guardian . “
60083	60109	60061	60076	the man to allow his junior to be walked over either ? ” said my guardian	10381	” said Mr. Boythorn , clapping him on the shoulder with an air of protection that had something serious in it , though he laughed . “
60167	60168	60173	60173	Esther	280	” “
60175	60180	60183	60183	guardian	10146	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
60185	60186	60183	60183	guardian	10146	” “
60190	60195	60183	60183	guardian	10146	” said Mr. Boythorn . “
60218	60233	60234	60234	I	0	” ( They all encouraged me ; they were determined to do it . ) “
60276	60368	60264	60264	I	0	” I saw him so often in the course of the evening , which passed very pleasantly , contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a satisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat at a little distance from the piano listening to the music — and he had small occasion to tell us that he was passionately fond of music , for his face showed it — that I asked my guardian as we sat at the backgammon board whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married . “
60371	60375	60264	60264	I	0	” said he . “
60378	60379	60264	60264	I	0	” “
60386	60389	60381	60381	he	2270	” said I. “
60397	60404	60392	60392	you	0	” he returned with a smile . “
60409	60426	60407	60407	guardian	10146	” I explained , not without reddening a little at hazarding what was in my thoughts , “
60452	60475	60440	60440	he	2270	” Mr. Jarndyce directed his eyes to where he was sitting as I have just described him . I said no more . “
60483	60487	60476	60476	You	2273	” he answered . “
60501	60502	60440	60440	he	2270	” “
60508	60509	60504	60505	the lady	1180	” “
60546	60547	60531	60531	you	2273	” “
60573	60574	60567	60567	you	2273	” “
60586	60591	60575	60575	He	2270	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
60622	61177	60616	60616	your	2273	” I felt , from my guardian ’s manner , that beyond this point I could not pursue the subject without changing the wind . I therefore forbore to ask any further questions . I was interested , but not curious . I thought a little while about this old love story in the night , when I was awakened by Mr. Boythorn ’s lusty snoring ; and I tried to do that very difficult thing , imagine old people young again and invested with the graces of youth . But I fell asleep before I had succeeded , and dreamed of the days when I lived in my godmother ’s house . I am not sufficiently acquainted with such subjects to know whether it is at all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my life . With the morning there came a letter from Messrs. Kenge and Carboy to Mr. Boythorn informing him that one of their clerks would wait upon him at noon . As it was the day of the week on which I paid the bills , and added up my books , and made all the household affairs as compact as possible , I remained at home while Mr. Jarndyce , Ada , and Richard took advantage of a very fine day to make a little excursion , Mr. Boythorn was to wait for Kenge and Carboy ’s clerk and then was to go on foot to meet them on their return . Well ! I was full of business , examining tradesmen ’s books , adding up columns , paying money , filing receipts , and I dare say making a great bustle about it when Mr. Guppy was announced and shown in . I had had some idea that the clerk who was to be sent down might be the young gentleman who had met me at the coach - office , and I was glad to see him , because he was associated with my present happiness . I scarcely knew him again , he was so uncommonly smart . He had an entirely new suit of glossy clothes on , a shining hat , lilac - kid gloves , a neckerchief of a variety of colours , a large hot - house flower in his button - hole , and a thick gold ring on his little finger . Besides which , he quite scented the dining - room with bear’s - grease and other perfumery . He looked at me with an attention that quite confused me when I begged him to take a seat until the servant should return ; and as he sat there crossing and uncrossing his legs in a corner , and I asked him if he had had a pleasant ride , and hoped that Mr. Kenge was well , I never looked at him , but I found him looking at me in the same scrutinizing and curious way . When the request was brought to him that he would go upstairs to Mr. Boythorn ’s room , I mentioned that he would find lunch prepared for him when he came down , of which Mr. Jarndyce hoped he would partake . He said with some embarrassment , holding the handle of the door , “
61190	61339	61179	61179	I	0	” I replied yes , I should be there ; and he went out with a bow and another look . I thought him only awkward and shy , for he was evidently much embarrassed ; and I fancied that the best thing I could do would be to wait until I saw that he had everything he wanted and then to leave him to himself . The lunch was soon brought , but it remained for some time on the table . The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a long one , and a stormy one too , I should think , for although his room was at some distance I heard his loud voice rising every now and then like a high wind , and evidently blowing perfect broadsides of denunciation . At last Mr. Guppy came back , looking something the worse for the conference . “
61345	61353	61179	61179	I	0	” he said in a low voice , “
61359	61360	61354	61354	he	2285	” “
61368	61467	61366	61366	sir	9496	” said I. Mr. Guppy sat down at the table and began nervously sharpening the carving - knife on the carving - fork , still looking at me ( as I felt quite sure without looking at him ) in the same unusual manner . The sharpening lasted so long that at last I felt a kind of obligation on me to raise my eyes in order that I might break the spell under which he seemed to labour , of not being able to leave off . He immediately looked at the dish and began to carve . “
61484	61485	61476	61476	You	9584	” “
61491	61494	61489	61489	you	9496	” said I. “
61509	61522	61507	61507	miss	9584	” said Mr. Guppy , hurriedly drinking off a glass of wine . “
61528	61531	61526	61526	you	9496	” said I. “
61554	61555	61548	61548	I	0	” “
61594	61615	61616	61616	I	0	” He drank off two more glasses of wine , one after another . I thought I had better go . “
61623	61635	61621	61621	miss	9584	” said Mr. Guppy , rising when he saw me rise . “
61650	61662	61638	61638	you	9584	” Not knowing what to say , I sat down again . “
61671	61684	61669	61669	miss	9584	” said Mr. Guppy , anxiously bringing a chair towards my table . “
61693	61699	61690	61690	you	0	” said I , wondering . “
61767	61768	61769	61769	I	0	” “
61777	61781	61769	61769	I	0	” said I , “
61816	61817	61821	61821	miss	9584	” “
61834	61864	61823	61823	I	0	” All this time Mr. Guppy was either planing his forehead with his handkerchief or tightly rubbing the palm of his left hand with the palm of his right . “
61900	61921	61922	61922	You	9584	” He did so , and came back again . I took the opportunity of moving well behind my table . “
61936	61944	61933	61933	you	9584	” said Mr. Guppy , apparently refreshed . “
61948	61951	61933	61933	you	9584	” said I. “
61957	61962	61963	61963	Quarter	2298	” said Mr. Guppy . “
62215	62238	62191	62191	you	280	” Mr. Guppy went down on his knees . I was well behind my table and not much frightened . I said , “
62264	62265	62250	62250	you	9496	” “
62272	62281	62250	62250	you	9496	” said Mr. Guppy , folding his hands . “
62293	62297	62291	62291	sir	9496	” I returned , “
62327	62339	62320	62320	you	9496	” He looked piteously , but slowly rose and did so . “
62349	62372	62347	62347	miss	9584	” he said with his hand upon his heart and shaking his head at me in a melancholy manner over the tray , “
62395	62396	62383	62384	The soul	2309	” “
62403	62407	62408	62408	you	9496	” said I ; “
62424	62425	62426	62426	I	0	” “
62431	62436	62426	62426	I	0	” said Mr. Guppy . “
62463	62464	62450	62450	I	0	” “
62470	62474	62450	62450	I	0	” said I , “
62482	62483	62484	62484	I	0	” “
62488	62523	62524	62524	I	0	” said Mr. Guppy , leaning forward over the tray and regarding me , as I again strangely felt , though my eyes were not directed to him , with his late intent look , “
62656	62701	62702	62703	Cruel miss	2314	” I told him that he addressed my interest or what he supposed to be my interest quite as unsuccessfully as he addressed my inclination , and he would now understand that I requested him , if he pleased , to go away immediately . “
62705	62710	62702	62703	Cruel miss	2314	” said Mr. Guppy , “
62878	62879	62880	62880	I	0	” “
62888	62903	62885	62886	Mr. Guppy	297	” said I , rising and putting my hand upon the bell - rope , “
62974	62988	62971	62971	I	0	” I think I added , without very well knowing what I said , “
63014	63015	63020	63020	miss	9584	” “
63022	63036	63020	63020	miss	9584	” cried Mr. Guppy , checking me as I was about to ring . “
63043	63044	63045	63045	I	0	” “
63051	63055	63045	63045	I	0	” said I , “
63067	63068	63075	63075	miss	9584	” “
63161	63782	63145	63146	Mrs. Guppy	296	” I rang the bell , the servant came , and Mr. Guppy , laying his written card upon the table and making a dejected bow , departed . Raising my eyes as he went out , I once more saw him looking at me after he had passed the door . I sat there for another hour or more , finishing my books and payments and getting through plenty of business . Then I arranged my desk , and put everything away , and was so composed and cheerful that I thought I had quite dismissed this unexpected incident . But , when I went upstairs to my own room , I surprised myself by beginning to laugh about it and then surprised myself still more by beginning to cry about it . In short , I was in a flutter for a little while and felt as if an old chord had been more coarsely touched than it ever had been since the days of the dear old doll , long buried in the garden . CHAPTER X The Law - Writer On the eastern borders of Chancery Lane , that is to say , more particularly in Cook ’s Court , Cursitor Street , Mr. Snagsby , law - stationer , pursues his lawful calling . In the shade of Cook ’s Court , at most times a shady place , Mr. Snagsby has dealt in all sorts of blank forms of legal process ; in skins and rolls of parchment ; in paper — foolscap , brief , draft , brown , white , whitey - brown , and blotting ; in stamps ; in office - quills , pens , ink , India - rubber , pounce , pins , pencils , sealing - wax , and wafers ; in red tape and green ferret ; in pocket - books , almanacs , diaries , and law lists ; in string boxes , rulers , inkstands — glass and leaden — pen - knives , scissors , bodkins , and other small office - cutlery ; in short , in articles too numerous to mention , ever since he was out of his time and went into partnership with Peffer . On that occasion , Cook ’s Court was in a manner revolutionized by the new inscription in fresh paint , PEFFER AND SNAGSBY , displacing the time - honoured and not easily to be deciphered legend PEFFER only . For smoke , which is the London ivy , had so wreathed itself round Peffer ’s name and clung to his dwelling - place that the affectionate parasite quite overpowered the parent tree . Peffer is never seen in Cook ’s Court now . He is not expected there , for he has been recumbent this quarter of a century in the churchyard of St. Andrews , Holborn , with the waggons and hackney - coaches roaring past him all the day and half the night like one great dragon . If he ever steal forth when the dragon is at rest to air himself again in Cook ’s Court until admonished to return by the crowing of the sanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in Cursitor Street , whose ideas of daylight it would be curious to ascertain , since he knows from his personal observation next to nothing about it — if Peffer ever do revisit the pale glimpses of Cook ’s Court , which no law - stationer in the trade can positively deny , he comes invisibly , and no one is the worse or wiser . In his lifetime , and likewise in the period of Snagsby ’s “
63784	64238	64239	64239	I	0	” of seven long years , there dwelt with Peffer in the same law - stationering premises a niece — a short , shrewd niece , something too violently compressed about the waist , and with a sharp nose like a sharp autumn evening , inclining to be frosty towards the end . The Cook ’s Courtiers had a rumour flying among them that the mother of this niece did , in her daughter ’s childhood , moved by too jealous a solicitude that her figure should approach perfection , lace her up every morning with her maternal foot against the bed - post for a stronger hold and purchase ; and further , that she exhibited internally pints of vinegar and lemon - juice , which acids , they held , had mounted to the nose and temper of the patient . With whichsoever of the many tongues of Rumour this frothy report originated , it either never reached or never influenced the ears of young Snagsby , who , having wooed and won its fair subject on his arrival at man ’s estate , entered into two partnerships at once . So now , in Cook ’s Court , Cursitor Street , Mr. Snagsby and the niece are one ; and the niece still cherishes her figure , which , however tastes may differ , is unquestionably so far precious that there is mighty little of it . Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh , but , to the neighbours ’ thinking , one voice too . That voice , appearing to proceed from Mrs. Snagsby alone , is heard in Cook ’s Court very often . Mr. Snagsby , otherwise than as he finds expression through these dulcet tones , is rarely heard . He is a mild , bald , timid man with a shining head and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out at the back . He tends to meekness and obesity . As he stands at his door in Cook ’s Court in his grey shop - coat and black calico sleeves , looking up at the clouds , or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy flat ruler , snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his two ’ prentices , he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man . From beneath his feet , at such times , as from a shrill ghost unquiet in its grave , there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in the voice already mentioned ; and haply , on some occasions when these reach a sharper pitch than usual , Mr. Snagsby mentions to the ’ prentices , “
64252	64391	63145	63146	Mrs. Guppy	296	” This proper name , so used by Mr. Snagsby , has before now sharpened the wit of the Cook ’s Courtiers to remark that it ought to be the name of Mrs. Snagsby , seeing that she might with great force and expression be termed a Guster , in compliment to her stormy character . It is , however , the possession , and the only possession except fifty shillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with clothing , of a lean young woman from a workhouse ( by some supposed to have been christened Augusta ) who , although she was farmed or contracted for during her growing time by an amiable benefactor of his species resident at Tooting , and can not fail to have been developed under the most favourable circumstances , “
64395	65096	63145	63146	Mrs. Guppy	296	” which the parish ca n’t account for . Guster , really aged three or four and twenty , but looking a round ten years older , goes cheap with this unaccountable drawback of fits , and is so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of her patron saint that except when she is found with her head in the pail , or the sink , or the copper , or the dinner , or anything else that happens to be near her at the time of her seizure , she is always at work . She is a satisfaction to the parents and guardians of the ’ prentices , who feel that there is little danger of her inspiring tender emotions in the breast of youth ; she is a satisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby , who can always find fault with her ; she is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby , who thinks it a charity to keep her . The law - stationer ’s establishment is , in Guster ’s eyes , a temple of plenty and splendour . She believes the little drawing - room upstairs , always kept , as one may say , with its hair in papers and its pinafore on , to be the most elegant apartment in Christendom . The view it commands of Cook ’s Court at one end ( not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street ) and of Coavinses ’ the sheriff ’s officer ’s backyard at the other she regards as a prospect of unequalled beauty . The portraits it displays in oil — and plenty of it too — of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby and of Mrs. Snagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby are in her eyes as achievements of Raphael or Titian . Guster has some recompenses for her many privations . Mr. Snagsby refers everything not in the practical mysteries of the business to Mrs. Snagsby . She manages the money , reproaches the tax - gatherers , appoints the times and places of devotion on Sundays , licenses Mr. Snagsby ’s entertainments , and acknowledges no responsibility as to what she thinks fit to provide for dinner , insomuch that she is the high standard of comparison among the neighbouring wives a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides , and even out in Holborn , who in any domestic passages of arms habitually call upon their husbands to look at the difference between their ( the wives ’ ) position and Mrs. Snagsby ’s , and their ( the husbands ’ ) behaviour and Mr. Snagsby ’s . Rumour , always flying bat - like about Cook ’s Court and skimming in and out at everybody ’s windows , does say that Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that Mr. Snagsby is sometimes worried out of house and home , and that if he had the spirit of a mouse he would n’t stand it . It is even observed that the wives who quote him to their self - willed husbands as a shining example in reality look down upon him and that nobody does so with greater superciliousness than one particular lady whose lord is more than suspected of laying his umbrella on her as an instrument of correction . But these vague whisperings may arise from Mr. Snagsby ’s being in his way rather a meditative and poetical man , loving to walk in Staple Inn in the summer - time and to observe how countrified the sparrows and the leaves are , also to lounge about the Rolls Yard of a Sunday afternoon and to remark ( if in good spirits ) that there were old times once and that you ’d find a stone coffin or two now under that chapel , he ’ll be bound , if you was to dig for it . He solaces his imagination , too , by thinking of the many Chancellors and Vices , and Masters of the Rolls who are deceased ; and he gets such a flavour of the country out of telling the two ’ prentices how he HAS heard say that a brook “
65101	65896	65897	65897	I	0	” once ran right down the middle of Holborn , when Turnstile really was a turnstile , leading slap away into the meadows — gets such a flavour of the country out of this that he never wants to go there . The day is closing in and the gas is lighted , but is not yet fully effective , for it is not quite dark . Mr. Snagsby standing at his shop - door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim westward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook ’s Court . The crow flies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln ’s Inn Garden into Lincoln ’s Inn Fields . Here , in a large house , formerly a house of state , lives Mr. Tulkinghorn . It is let off in sets of chambers now , and in those shrunken fragments of its greatness , lawyers lie like maggots in nuts . But its roomy staircases , passages , and antechambers still remain ; and even its painted ceilings , where Allegory , in Roman helmet and celestial linen , sprawls among balustrades and pillars , flowers , clouds , and big - legged boys , and makes the head ache — as would seem to be Allegory ’s object always , more or less . Here , among his many boxes labelled with transcendent names , lives Mr. Tulkinghorn , when not speechlessly at home in country - houses where the great ones of the earth are bored to death . Here he is to - day , quiet at his table . An oyster of the old school whom nobody can open . Like as he is to look at , so is his apartment in the dusk of the present afternoon . Rusty , out of date , withdrawing from attention , able to afford it . Heavy , broad - backed , old - fashioned , mahogany - and - horsehair chairs , not easily lifted ; obsolete tables with spindle - legs and dusty baize covers ; presentation prints of the holders of great titles in the last generation or the last but one , environ him . A thick and dingy Turkey - carpet muffles the floor where he sits , attended by two candles in old - fashioned silver candlesticks that give a very insufficient light to his large room . The titles on the backs of his books have retired into the binding ; everything that can have a lock has got one ; no key is visible . Very few loose papers are about . He has some manuscript near him , but is not referring to it . With the round top of an inkstand and two broken bits of sealing - wax he is silently and slowly working out whatever train of indecision is in his mind . Now the inkstand top is in the middle , now the red bit of sealing - wax , now the black bit . That ’s not it . Mr. Tulkinghorn must gather them all up and begin again . Here , beneath the painted ceiling , with foreshortened Allegory staring down at his intrusion as if it meant to swoop upon him , and he cutting it dead , Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once his house and office . He keeps no staff , only one middle - aged man , usually a little out at elbows , who sits in a high pew in the hall and is rarely overburdened with business . Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way . He wants no clerks . He is a great reservoir of confidences , not to be so tapped . His clients want HIM ; he is all in all . Drafts that he requires to be drawn are drawn by special - pleaders in the temple on mysterious instructions ; fair copies that he requires to be made are made at the stationers ’ , expense being no consideration . The middle - aged man in the pew knows scarcely more of the affairs of the peerage than any crossing - sweeper in Holborn . The red bit , the black bit , the inkstand top , the other inkstand top , the little sand - box . So ! You to the middle , you to the right , you to the left . This train of indecision must surely be worked out now or never . Now ! Mr. Tulkinghorn gets up , adjusts his spectacles , puts on his hat , puts the manuscript in his pocket , goes out , tells the middle - aged man out at elbows , “
65903	66054	66055	66055	Master	2320	” Very rarely tells him anything more explicit . Mr. Tulkinghorn goes , as the crow came — not quite so straight , but nearly — to Cook ’s Court , Cursitor Street . To Snagsby ’s , Law - Stationer ’s , Deeds engrossed and copied , Law - Writing executed in all its branches , & amp;c . , & amp;c . , & amp;c . It is somewhere about five or six o’clock in the afternoon , and a balmy fragrance of warm tea hovers in Cook ’s Court . It hovers about Snagsby ’s door . The hours are early there : dinner at half - past one and supper at half - past nine . Mr. Snagsby was about to descend into the subterranean regions to take tea when he looked out of his door just now and saw the crow who was out late . “
66059	66153	66154	66154	Master	9808	” Guster is minding the shop , for the ’ prentices take tea in the kitchen with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby ; consequently , the robe - maker ’s two daughters , combing their curls at the two glasses in the two second - floor windows of the opposite house , are not driving the two ’ prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose , but are merely awakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster , whose hair wo n’t grow , and never would , and it is confidently thought , never will . “
66158	66243	66154	66154	Master	9808	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . Master is at home , and Guster will fetch him . Guster disappears , glad to get out of the shop , which she regards with mingled dread and veneration as a storehouse of awful implements of the great torture of the law — a place not to be entered after the gas is turned off . Mr. Snagsby appears , greasy , warm , herbaceous , and chewing . Bolts a bit of bread and butter . Says , “
66253	66254	66250	66251	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” “
66265	66266	66263	66263	Snagsby	362	” “
66297	66341	66295	66295	sir	9496	” Snagsby has brightened in a moment . The confined room , strong of parchment - grease , is warehouse , counting - house , and copying - office . Mr. Tulkinghorn sits , facing round , on a stool at the desk . “
66348	66349	66352	66352	sir	9496	” “
66354	66395	66352	66352	sir	9496	” Mr. Snagsby turns up the gas and coughs behind his hand , modestly anticipating profit . Mr. Snagsby , as a timid man , is accustomed to cough with a variety of expressions , and so to save words . “
66407	66408	66413	66413	we	2332	” “
66416	66417	66413	66413	we	2332	” “
66424	66446	66413	66413	we	2332	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , carelessly feeling — tight , unopenable oyster of the old school!—in the wrong coat - pocket , “
66513	66514	66503	66503	I	0	” “
66521	66557	66558	66558	We	2332	” says Mr. Snagsby , taking it , laying it flat on the desk , and separating all the sheets at once with a twirl and a twist of the left hand peculiar to lawstationers . “
66599	66645	66646	66646	Jewby	371	” Mr. Snagsby takes his book down from the safe , makes another bolt of the bit of bread and butter which seemed to have stopped short , eyes the affidavit aside , and brings his right forefinger travelling down a page of the book , “
66652	66653	66654	66654	Jarndyce	286	” “
66662	66667	66660	66660	sir	9496	” says Mr. Snagsby . “
66700	66727	66732	66732	him	2340	” Mr. Tulkinghorn has seen the entry , found it before the law - stationer , read it while the forefinger was coming down the hill . “
66736	66741	66742	66742	Nemo	372	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
66776	66777	66778	66778	Nemo	372	” “
66780	66785	66778	66778	Nemo	372	” repeats Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
66793	66794	66786	66786	Nemo	372	” “
66808	66817	66803	66803	sir	9496	” Mr. Snagsby submits with his deferential cough . “
66856	66904	66908	66909	a customer	2348	” The tail of Mr. Snagsby ’s eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs. Snagsby looking in at the shop - door to know what he means by deserting his tea . Mr. Snagsby addresses an explanatory cough to Mrs. Snagsby , as who should say , “
66911	66912	66917	66917	sir	9496	” “
66919	66924	66917	66917	sir	9496	” repeats Mr. Snagsby . “
67011	67096	67097	67097	Tul	373	” Mr. Tulkinghorn glances through the little window at the back of Coavinses ’ , the sheriff ’s officer ’s , where lights shine in Coavinses ’ windows . Coavinses ’ coffee - room is at the back , and the shadows of several gentlemen under a cloud loom cloudily upon the blinds . Mr. Snagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning his head to glance over his shoulder at his little woman and to make apologetic motions with his mouth to this effect : “
67113	67114	67097	67097	Tul	373	” “
67123	67128	67116	67116	you	9496	” asks Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
67141	67142	67139	67139	yours	9496	” “
67157	67158	67152	67152	you	9496	” “
67173	67190	67168	67168	he	2359	” Mr. Snagsby makes another bolt , as if the bit of bread and butter were insurmountable “
67199	67200	67168	67168	he	2359	” “
67212	67213	67202	67202	you	9496	” “
67221	67246	67219	67219	sir	9496	” Mr. Snagsby pulls off his sleeves and his grey coat , pulls on his black coat , takes his hat from its peg . “
67255	67260	67219	67219	sir	9496	” he says aloud . “
67306	67350	67296	67296	I	0	” Mrs. Snagsby bends to the lawyer , retires behind the counter , peeps at them through the window - blind , goes softly into the back office , refers to the entries in the book still lying open . Is evidently curious . “
67362	67381	67360	67360	sir	9496	” says Mr. Snagsby , walking deferentially in the road and leaving the narrow pavement to the lawyer ; “
67434	67625	67413	67413	He	2378	” It is quite dark now , and the gas - lamps have acquired their full effect . Jostling against clerks going to post the day ’s letters , and against counsel and attorneys going home to dinner , and against plaintiffs and defendants and suitors of all sorts , and against the general crowd , in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has interposed a million of obstacles to the transaction of the commonest business of life ; diving through law and equity , and through that kindred mystery , the street mud , which is made of nobody knows what and collects about us nobody knows whence or how — we only knowing in general that when there is too much of it we find it necessary to shovel it away — the lawyer and the law - stationer come to a rag and bottle shop and general emporium of much disregarded merchandise , lying and being in the shadow of the wall of Lincoln ’s Inn , and kept , as is announced in paint , to all whom it may concern , by one Krook . “
67634	67641	67632	67632	sir	9496	” says the law - stationer . “
67651	67657	67659	67659	you	9496	” says the lawyer unconcernedly . “
67661	67662	67659	67659	you	9496	” “
67671	67672	67664	67664	you	9496	” “
67696	67799	67694	67694	you	9496	” Mr. Snagsby lifts his hat and returns to his little woman and his tea . But Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present . He goes a short way , turns back , comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook , and enters it straight . It is dim enough , with a blot - headed candle or so in the windows , and an old man and a cat sitting in the back part by a fire . The old man rises and comes forward , with another blot - headed candle in his hand . “
67806	67807	67802	67803	your lodger	2382	” “
67814	67819	67820	67820	Male	2384	” says Mr. Krook . “
67828	67851	67822	67826	The person who does copying	2385	” Mr. Krook has eyed his man narrowly . Knows him by sight . Has an indistinct impression of his aristocratic repute . “
67861	67862	67853	67853	you	9496	” “
67865	67866	67853	67853	you	9496	” “
67875	67883	67870	67870	I	0	” says Mr. Krook with a grin . “
67903	67904	67901	67901	sir	9496	” “
67914	67919	67905	67905	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
67932	67955	67905	67905	I	0	” Mr. Krook , with his cat beside him , stands at the bottom of the staircase , looking after Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
67960	67991	67905	67905	I	0	” he says when Mr. Tulkinghorn has nearly disappeared . The lawyer looks down over the hand - rail . The cat expands her wicked mouth and snarls at him . “
68014	68025	68008	68008	they	10039	” whispers Krook , going up a step or two . “
68033	68034	68028	68028	they	10039	” “
68101	68520	68098	68098	my	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn with a nod goes on his way . He comes to the dark door on the second floor . He knocks , receives no answer , opens it , and accidentally extinguishes his candle in doing so . The air of the room is almost bad enough to have extinguished it if he had not . It is a small room , nearly black with soot , and grease , and dirt . In the rusty skeleton of a grate , pinched at the middle as if poverty had gripped it , a red coke fire burns low . In the corner by the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk , a wilderness marked with a rain of ink . In another corner a ragged old portmanteau on one of the two chairs serves for cabinet or wardrobe ; no larger one is needed , for it collapses like the cheeks of a starved man . The floor is bare , except that one old mat , trodden to shreds of rope - yarn , lies perishing upon the hearth . No curtain veils the darkness of the night , but the discoloured shutters are drawn together , and through the two gaunt holes pierced in them , famine might be staring in — the banshee of the man upon the bed . For , on a low bed opposite the fire , a confusion of dirty patchwork , lean - ribbed ticking , and coarse sacking , the lawyer , hesitating just within the doorway , sees a man . He lies there , dressed in shirt and trousers , with bare feet . He has a yellow look in the spectral darkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length of its wick ( still burning ) has doubled over and left a tower of winding - sheet above it . His hair is ragged , mingling with his whiskers and his beard — the latter , ragged too , and grown , like the scum and mist around him , in neglect . Foul and filthy as the room is , foul and filthy as the air is , it is not easy to perceive what fumes those are which most oppress the senses in it ; but through the general sickliness and faintness , and the odour of stale tobacco , there comes into the lawyer ’s mouth the bitter , vapid taste of opium . “
68526	68561	68562	68562	Hallo	374	” he cries , and strikes his iron candlestick against the door . He thinks he has awakened his friend . He lies a little turned away , but his eyes are surely open . “
68567	68572	68573	68573	Hallo	374	” he cries again . “
68577	68643	68573	68573	Hallo	374	” As he rattles on the door , the candle which has drooped so long goes out and leaves him in the dark , with the gaunt eyes in the shutters staring down upon the bed . CHAPTER XI Our Dear Brother A touch on the lawyer ’s wrinkled hand as he stands in the dark room , irresolute , makes him start and say , “
68648	68649	68573	68573	Hallo	374	” “
68654	68670	68652	68652	me	0	” returns the old man of the house , whose breath is in his ear . “
68677	68678	68673	68673	you	0	” “
68681	68682	68673	68673	you	0	” “
68691	68692	68685	68685	you	0	” “
68702	68820	68673	68673	you	0	” Krook takes it , goes to the fire , stoops over the red embers , and tries to get a light . The dying ashes have no light to spare , and his endeavours are vain . Muttering , after an ineffectual call to his lodger , that he will go downstairs and bring a lighted candle from the shop , the old man departs . Mr. Tulkinghorn , for some new reason that he has , does not await his return in the room , but on the stairs outside . The welcome light soon shines upon the wall , as Krook comes slowly up with his green - eyed cat following at his heels . “
68829	68838	68822	68823	the man	1619	” inquired the lawyer in a low voice . “
68846	68858	68859	68859	I	0	” says Krook , shaking his head and lifting his eyebrows . “
68875	68912	68871	68871	himself	1619	” Thus whispering , they both go in together . As the light goes in , the great eyes in the shutters , darkening , seem to close . Not so the eyes upon the bed . “
68917	68922	68871	68871	himself	1619	” exclaims Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
68927	68956	68871	68871	himself	1619	” Krook drops the heavy hand he has taken up so suddenly that the arm swings over the bedside . They look at one another for a moment . “
68987	69015	69016	69017	Miss Flite	376	” says Krook , with his lean hands spread out above the body like a vampire ’s wings . Mr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing and calls , “
69032	69059	69030	69030	Flite	376	” Krook follows him with his eyes , and while he is calling , finds opportunity to steal to the old portmanteau and steal back again . “
69072	69122	69066	69068	The nearest doctor	2403	” So Mr. Krook addresses a crazy little woman who is his female lodger , who appears and vanishes in a breath , who soon returns accompanied by a testy medical man brought from his dinner , with a broad , snuffy upper lip and a broad Scotch tongue . “
69132	69148	69130	69130	ye	376	” says the medical man , looking up at them after a moment ’s examination . “
69157	69176	69149	69149	He	2404	” Mr. Tulkinghorn ( standing by the old portmanteau ) inquires if he has been dead any time . “
69182	69188	69180	69180	sir	9496	” says the medical gentleman . “
69201	69202	69192	69192	he	2404	” “
69211	69225	69192	69192	he	2404	” observes a dark young man on the other side of the bed . “
69236	69248	69234	69234	sir	9496	” inquires the first . The dark young man says yes . “
69258	69263	69250	69250	I	0	” replies the other , “
69271	69321	69322	69322	I	0	” With which remark he finishes his brief attendance and returns to finish his dinner . The dark young surgeon passes the candle across and across the face and carefully examines the law - writer , who has established his pretensions to his name by becoming indeed No one . “
69331	69335	69322	69322	I	0	” says he . “
69357	69365	69351	69352	anybody present	2408	” glancing round upon the three bystanders . “
69371	69386	69387	69387	He	2407	” grimly answers Krook , taking the candle from the surgeon ’s outstretched hand . “
69399	69400	69387	69387	He	2407	” “
69405	69410	69401	69401	He	2407	” says the surgeon , “
69438	69449	69459	69459	you	0	” taking an old tea - pot from Mr. Krook , “
69456	69457	69461	69461	he	2407	” “
69467	69471	69461	69461	he	2407	” asks Krook . “
69478	69479	69461	69461	he	2407	” “
69482	69496	69497	69497	I	0	” Krook almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible interest . “
69533	69534	69537	69537	he	2407	” “
69547	69568	69540	69540	His	2407	” says Krook , who might have changed eyes with his cat , as he casts his sharp glance around . “
69593	69594	69582	69582	he	2407	” “
69602	69603	69582	69582	he	2407	” “
69607	69608	69582	69582	he	2407	” “
69615	69625	69582	69582	he	2407	” says the young man , resuming his examination . “
69678	69710	69711	69711	I	0	” He says this , not unfeelingly , while sitting on the bedstead ’s edge with his face towards that other face and his hand upon the region of the heart . “
69738	69748	69749	69749	You	2418	” he continues , looking round . Krook replies , “
69802	69967	69968	69968	I	0	” During this dialogue Mr. Tulkinghorn has stood aloof by the old portmanteau , with his hands behind him , equally removed , to all appearance , from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the bed — from the young surgeon ’s professional interest in death , noticeable as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as an individual ; from the old man ’s unction ; and the little crazy woman ’s awe . His imperturbable face has been as inexpressive as his rusty clothes . One could not even say he has been thinking all this while . He has shown neither patience nor impatience , nor attention nor abstraction . He has shown nothing but his shell . As easily might the tone of a delicate musical instrument be inferred from its case , as the tone of Mr. Tulkinghorn from his case . He now interposes , addressing the young surgeon in his unmoved , professional way . “
69973	69977	69968	69968	I	0	” he observes , “
70041	70081	70083	70083	you	2422	” to the little crazy woman , who has often seen him in court , and whom he has often seen , and who proposes , in frightened dumb - show , to go for the law - stationer . “
70086	70145	70083	70083	you	2422	” While she is gone , the surgeon abandons his hopeless investigation and covers its subject with the patchwork counterpane . Mr. Krook and he interchange a word or two . Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing , but stands , ever , near the old portmanteau . Mr. Snagsby arrives hastily in his grey coat and his black sleeves . “
70152	70156	70083	70083	you	2422	” he says ; “
70171	70172	70168	70168	my	0	” “
70190	70195	70174	70174	you	2422	” inquires Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
70216	70217	70213	70213	you	2422	” “
70222	70235	70220	70220	sir	9496	” says Mr. Snagsby , coughing his apologetic cough behind his hand , “
70253	70254	70255	70255	I	0	” “
70262	70267	70268	70268	I	0	” returns Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
70272	70273	70268	70268	I	0	” “
70284	70294	70280	70280	I	0	” says Mr. Snagsby , with his deferential cough . “
70318	70319	70320	70320	I	0	” “
70326	70341	70320	70320	I	0	” says Mr. Snagsby after prefacing his reply with his cough of general propitiation , “
70355	70356	70352	70352	I	0	” “
70365	70401	70358	70358	he	2430	” suggests the surgeon to help him out . A pause . Mr. Tulkinghorn looking at the law - stationer . Mr. Krook , with his mouth open , looking for somebody to speak next . “
70409	70414	70416	70417	a person	1064	” says Mr. Snagsby , “
70492	70493	70479	70479	he	2430	” “
70499	70506	70479	70479	he	2430	” says Krook with a nod . “
70515	70522	70523	70523	he	2430	” says Mr. Snagsby , strengthened , “
70588	70610	70562	70562	her	2319	” a favourite apology for plain speaking with Mr. Snagsby , which he always offers with a sort of argumentative frankness , “
70707	70721	70723	70723	she	2319	” proceeds Mr. Snagsby after consulting his cough of consideration behind his hand , “
70866	70886	70887	70887	I	0	” Mr. Snagsby concludes by politely motioning with his hat towards the bed , as much as to add , “
70906	70907	70887	70887	I	0	” “
70914	70921	70887	70887	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook , “
70950	70951	70946	70946	You	362	” “
70958	70968	70954	70954	I	0	” returns the old man with a sudden grin . “
70971	70976	70954	70954	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “
71053	71054	71041	71041	he	362	” “
71068	71414	71066	71066	sir	9496	” says Snagsby . Ah , to be sure , so there is ! Mr. Tulkinghorn does not appear to have seen it before , though he is standing so close to it , and though there is very little else , heaven knows . The marine - store merchant holds the light , and the law - stationer conducts the search . The surgeon leans against the corner of the chimney - piece ; Miss Flite peeps and trembles just within the door . The apt old scholar of the old school , with his dull black breeches tied with ribbons at the knees , his large black waistcoat , his long - sleeved black coat , and his wisp of limp white neckerchief tied in the bow the peerage knows so well , stands in exactly the same place and attitude . There are some worthless articles of clothing in the old portmanteau ; there is a bundle of pawnbrokers ’ duplicates , those turnpike tickets on the road of poverty ; there is a crumpled paper , smelling of opium , on which are scrawled rough memoranda — as , took , such a day , so many grains ; took , such another day , so many more — begun some time ago , as if with the intention of being regularly continued , but soon left off . There are a few dirty scraps of newspapers , all referring to coroners ’ inquests ; there is nothing else . They search the cupboard and the drawer of the ink - splashed table . There is not a morsel of an old letter or of any other writing in either . The young surgeon examines the dress on the law - writer . A knife and some odd halfpence are all he finds . Mr. Snagsby ’s suggestion is the practical suggestion after all , and the beadle must be called in . So the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle , and the rest come out of the room . “
71422	71427	71066	71066	sir	9496	” says the surgeon ; “
71433	71458	71066	71066	sir	9496	” Mr. Krook therefore drives her out before him , and she goes furtively downstairs , winding her lithe tail and licking her lips . “
71462	71598	71066	71066	sir	9496	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , and goes home to Allegory and meditation . By this time the news has got into the court . Groups of its inhabitants assemble to discuss the thing , and the outposts of the army of observation ( principally boys ) are pushed forward to Mr. Krook ’s window , which they closely invest . A policeman has already walked up to the room , and walked down again to the door , where he stands like a tower , only condescending to see the boys at his base occasionally ; but whenever he does see them , they quail and fall back . Mrs. Perkins , who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms with Mrs. Piper in consequence for an unpleasantness originating in young Perkins ’ having “
71600	71603	71066	71066	sir	9496	” young Piper “
71607	71909	71915	71915	his	2458	” renews her friendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion . The potboy at the corner , who is a privileged amateur , as possessing official knowledge of life and having to deal with drunken men occasionally , exchanges confidential communications with the policeman and has the appearance of an impregnable youth , unassailable by truncheons and unconfinable in station - houses . People talk across the court out of window , and bare - headed scouts come hurrying in from Chancery Lane to know what ’s the matter . The general feeling seems to be that it ’s a blessing Mr. Krook warn’t made away with first , mingled with a little natural disappointment that he was not . In the midst of this sensation , the beadle arrives . The beadle , though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a ridiculous institution , is not without a certain popularity for the moment , if it were only as a man who is going to see the body . The policeman considers him an imbecile civilian , a remnant of the barbarous watchmen times , but gives him admission as something that must be borne with until government shall abolish him . The sensation is heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the beadle is on the ground and has gone in . By and by the beadle comes out , once more intensifying the sensation , which has rather languished in the interval . He is understood to be in want of witnesses for the inquest to - morrow who can tell the coroner and jury anything whatever respecting the deceased . Is immediately referred to innumerable people who can tell nothing whatever . Is made more imbecile by being constantly informed that Mrs. Green ’s son “
71925	72860	71915	71915	his	2458	” which son of Mrs. Green ’s appears , on inquiry , to be at the present time aboard a vessel bound for China , three months out , but considered accessible by telegraph on application to the Lords of the Admiralty . Beadle goes into various shops and parlours , examining the inhabitants , always shutting the door first , and by exclusion , delay , and general idiotcy exasperating the public . Policeman seen to smile to potboy . Public loses interest and undergoes reaction . Taunts the beadle in shrill youthful voices with having boiled a boy , choruses fragments of a popular song to that effect and importing that the boy was made into soup for the workhouse . Policeman at last finds it necessary to support the law and seize a vocalist , who is released upon the flight of the rest on condition of his getting out of this then , come , and cutting it — a condition he immediately observes . So the sensation dies off for the time ; and the unmoved policeman ( to whom a little opium , more or less , is nothing ) , with his shining hat , stiff stock , inflexible great - coat , stout belt and bracelet , and all things fitting , pursues his lounging way with a heavy tread , beating the palms of his white gloves one against the other and stopping now and then at a street - corner to look casually about for anything between a lost child and a murder . Under cover of the night , the feeble - minded beadle comes flitting about Chancery Lane with his summonses , in which every juror ’s name is wrongly spelt , and nothing rightly spelt but the beadle ’s own name , which nobody can read or wants to know . The summonses served and his witnesses forewarned , the beadle goes to Mr. Krook ’s to keep a small appointment he has made with certain paupers , who , presently arriving , are conducted upstairs , where they leave the great eyes in the shutter something new to stare at , in that last shape which earthly lodgings take for No one — and for Every one . And all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau ; and the lonely figure on the bed , whose path in life has lain through five and forty years , lies there with no more track behind him that any one can trace than a deserted infant . Next day the court is all alive — is like a fair , as Mrs. Perkins , more than reconciled to Mrs. Piper , says in amicable conversation with that excellent woman . The coroner is to sit in the first - floor room at the Sol ’s Arms , where the Harmonic Meetings take place twice a week and where the chair is filled by a gentleman of professional celebrity , faced by Little Swills , the comic vocalist , who hopes ( according to the bill in the window ) that his friends will rally round him and support first - rate talent . The Sol ’s Arms does a brisk stroke of business all the morning . Even children so require sustaining under the general excitement that a pieman who has established himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says his brandy - balls go off like smoke . What time the beadle , hovering between the door of Mr. Krook ’s establishment and the door of the Sol ’s Arms , shows the curiosity in his keeping to a few discreet spirits and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in return . At the appointed hour arrives the coroner , for whom the jurymen are waiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good dry skittle - ground attached to the Sol ’s Arms . The coroner frequents more public - houses than any man alive . The smell of sawdust , beer , tobacco - smoke , and spirits is inseparable in his vocation from death in its most awful shapes . He is conducted by the beadle and the landlord to the Harmonic Meeting Room , where he puts his hat on the piano and takes a Windsor - chair at the head of a long table formed of several short tables put together and ornamented with glutinous rings in endless involutions , made by pots and glasses . As many of the jury as can crowd together at the table sit there . The rest get among the spittoons and pipes or lean against the piano . Over the coroner ’s head is a small iron garland , the pendant handle of a bell , which rather gives the majesty of the court the appearance of going to be hanged presently . Call over and swear the jury ! While the ceremony is in progress , sensation is created by the entrance of a chubby little man in a large shirt - collar , with a moist eye and an inflamed nose , who modestly takes a position near the door as one of the general public , but seems familiar with the room too . A whisper circulates that this is Little Swills . It is considered not unlikely that he will get up an imitation of the coroner and make it the principal feature of the Harmonic Meeting in the evening . “
72865	72870	72863	72863	gentlemen	9501	” the coroner begins . “
72877	72893	72875	72875	you	9501	” says the beadle . Not to the coroner , though it might appear so . “
72898	72903	72896	72896	gentlemen	9501	” resumes the coroner . “
72973	72974	72936	72936	your	9501	” “
72979	73102	73103	73103	Mooney	386	” cries the beadle . So they go out in a loose procession , something after the manner of a straggling funeral , and make their inspection in Mr. Krook ’s back second floor , from which a few of the jurymen retire pale and precipitately . The beadle is very careful that two gentlemen not very neat about the cuffs and buttons ( for whose accommodation he has provided a special little table near the coroner in the Harmonic Meeting Room ) should see all that is to be seen . For they are the public chroniclers of such inquiries by the line ; and he is not superior to the universal human infirmity , but hopes to read in print what “
73114	73214	73103	73103	Mooney	386	” said and did and even aspires to see the name of Mooney as familiarly and patronizingly mentioned as the name of the hangman is , according to the latest examples . Little Swills is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return . Mr. Tulkinghorn , also . Mr. Tulkinghorn is received with distinction and seated near the coroner between that high judicial officer , a bagatelle - board , and the coal - box . The inquiry proceeds . The jury learn how the subject of their inquiry died , and learn no more about him . “
73225	73230	73215	73218	A very eminent solicitor	2467	” says the coroner , “
73293	73938	73961	73961	you	9501	” Mrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins . Mrs. Piper sworn . Anastasia Piper , gentlemen . Married woman . Now , Mrs. Piper , what have you got to say about this ? Why , Mrs. Piper has a good deal to say , chiefly in parentheses and without punctuation , but not much to tell . Mrs. Piper lives in the court ( which her husband is a cabinet - maker ) , and it has long been well beknown among the neighbours ( counting from the day next but one before the half - baptizing of Alexander James Piper aged eighteen months and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live such was the sufferings gentlemen of that child in his gums ) as the plaintive — so Mrs. Piper insists on calling the deceased — was reported to have sold himself . Thinks it was the plaintive ’s air in which that report originatinin . See the plaintive often and considered as his air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go about some children being timid ( and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins may be brought forard for she is here and will do credit to her husband and herself and family ) . Has seen the plaintive wexed and worrited by the children ( for children they will ever be and you can not expect them specially if of playful dispositions to be Methoozellers which you was not yourself ) . On accounts of this and his dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a pick - axe from his pocket and split Johnny ’s head ( which the child knows not fear and has repeatually called after him close at his eels ) . Never however see the plaintive take a pick - axe or any other wepping far from it . Has seen him hurry away when run and called after as if not partial to children and never see him speak to neither child nor grown person at any time ( excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing down the lane over the way round the corner which if he was here would tell you that he has been seen a - speaking to him frequent ) . Says the coroner , is that boy here ? Says the beadle , no , sir , he is not here . Says the coroner , go and fetch him then . In the absence of the active and intelligent , the coroner converses with Mr. Tulkinghorn . Oh ! Here ’s the boy , gentlemen ! Here he is , very muddy , very hoarse , very ragged . Now , boy ! But stop a minute . Caution . This boy must be put through a few preliminary paces . Name , Jo . Nothing else that he knows on . Do n’t know that everybody has two names . Never heerd of sich a think . Do n’t know that Jo is short for a longer name . Thinks it long enough for HIM . HE do n’t find no fault with it . Spell it ? No . HE ca n’t spell it . No father , no mother , no friends . Never been to school . What ’s home ? Knows a broom ’s a broom , and knows it ’s wicked to tell a lie . Do n’t recollect who told him about the broom or about the lie , but knows both . Ca n’t exactly say what ’ll be done to him arter he ’s dead if he tells a lie to the gentlemen here , but believes it ’ll be something wery bad to punish him , and serve him right — and so he ’ll tell the truth . “
73946	73958	73961	73961	you	9501	” says the coroner with a melancholy shake of the head . “
73971	73977	73961	73961	you	9501	” asks an attentive juryman . “
73983	73988	73961	73961	you	9501	” says the coroner . “
74031	74270	74027	74028	the boy	9980	” Boy put aside , to the great edification of the audience , especially of Little Swills , the comic vocalist . Now . Is there any other witness ? No other witness . Very well , gentlemen ! Here ’s a man unknown , proved to have been in the habit of taking opium in large quantities for a year and a half , found dead of too much opium . If you think you have any evidence to lead you to the conclusion that he committed suicide , you will come to that conclusion . If you think it is a case of accidental death , you will find a verdict accordingly . Verdict accordingly . Accidental death . No doubt . Gentlemen , you are discharged . Good afternoon . While the coroner buttons his great - coat , Mr. Tulkinghorn and he give private audience to the rejected witness in a corner . That graceless creature only knows that the dead man ( whom he recognized just now by his yellow face and black hair ) was sometimes hooted and pursued about the streets . That one cold winter night when he , the boy , was shivering in a doorway near his crossing , the man turned to look at him , and came back , and having questioned him and found that he had not a friend in the world , said , “
74277	74346	74347	74347	I	0	” and gave him the price of a supper and a night ’s lodging . That the man had often spoken to him since and asked him whether he slept sound at night , and how he bore cold and hunger , and whether he ever wished to die , and similar strange questions . That when the man had no money , he would say in passing , “
74359	74385	74357	74357	Jo	389	” but that when he had any , he had always ( as the boy most heartily believes ) been glad to give him some . “
74393	74406	74407	74407	Wen	390	” says the boy , wiping his eyes with his wretched sleeve . “
74442	74466	74432	74432	He	2483	” As he shuffles downstairs , Mr. Snagsby , lying in wait for him , puts a half - crown in his hand . “
74486	74497	74468	74468	you	2485	” says Mr. Snagsby with his finger on his nose , “
74504	74602	74468	74468	you	2485	” For some little time the jurymen hang about the Sol ’s Arms colloquially . In the sequel , half - a - dozen are caught up in a cloud of pipe - smoke that pervades the parlour of the Sol ’s Arms ; two stroll to Hampstead ; and four engage to go half - price to the play at night , and top up with oysters . Little Swills is treated on several hands . Being asked what he thinks of the proceedings , characterizes them ( his strength lying in a slangular direction ) as “
74607	74728	74468	74468	you	2485	” The landlord of the Sol ’s Arms , finding Little Swills so popular , commends him highly to the jurymen and public , observing that for a song in character he do n’t know his equal and that that man ’s character - wardrobe would fill a cart . Thus , gradually the Sol ’s Arms melts into the shadowy night and then flares out of it strong in gas . The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving , the gentleman of professional celebrity takes the chair , is faced ( red - faced ) by Little Swills ; their friends rally round them and support first - rate talent . In the zenith of the evening , Little Swills says , “
74757	75160	75162	75162	she	2491	” Is much applauded and encouraged ; goes out of the room as Swills ; comes in as the coroner ( not the least in the world like him ) ; describes the inquest , with recreative intervals of piano - forte accompaniment , to the refrain : With his ( the coroner ’s ) tippy tol li doll , tippy tol lo doll , tippy tol li doll , Dee ! The jingling piano at last is silent , and the Harmonic friends rally round their pillows . Then there is rest around the lonely figure , now laid in its last earthly habitation ; and it is watched by the gaunt eyes in the shutters through some quiet hours of night . If this forlorn man could have been prophetically seen lying here by the mother at whose breast he nestled , a little child , with eyes upraised to her loving face , and soft hand scarcely knowing how to close upon the neck to which it crept , what an impossibility the vision would have seemed ! Oh , if in brighter days the now - extinguished fire within him ever burned for one woman who held him in her heart , where is she , while these ashes are above the ground ! It is anything but a night of rest at Mr. Snagsby ’s , in Cook ’s Court , where Guster murders sleep by going , as Mr. Snagsby himself allows — not to put too fine a point upon it — out of one fit into twenty . The occasion of this seizure is that Guster has a tender heart and a susceptible something that possibly might have been imagination , but for Tooting and her patron saint . Be it what it may , now , it was so direfully impressed at tea - time by Mr. Snagsby ’s account of the inquiry at which he had assisted that at supper - time she projected herself into the kitchen , preceded by a flying Dutch cheese , and fell into a fit of unusual duration , which she only came out of to go into another , and another , and so on through a chain of fits , with short intervals between , of which she has pathetically availed herself by consuming them in entreaties to Mrs. Snagsby not to give her warning “
75167	75232	75162	75162	she	2491	” and also in appeals to the whole establishment to lay her down on the stones and go to bed . Hence , Mr. Snagsby , at last hearing the cock at the little dairy in Cursitor Street go into that disinterested ecstasy of his on the subject of daylight , says , drawing a long breath , though the most patient of men , “
75243	75624	75233	75233	I	0	” What question this enthusiastic fowl supposes he settles when he strains himself to such an extent , or why he should thus crow ( so men crow on various triumphant public occasions , however ) about what can not be of any moment to him , is his affair . It is enough that daylight comes , morning comes , noon comes . Then the active and intelligent , who has got into the morning papers as such , comes with his pauper company to Mr. Krook ’s and bears off the body of our dear brother here departed to a hemmed - in churchyard , pestiferous and obscene , whence malignant diseases are communicated to the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters who have not departed , while our dear brothers and sisters who hang about official back - stairs — would to heaven they HAD departed!—are very complacent and agreeable . Into a beastly scrap of ground which a Turk would reject as a savage abomination and a Caffre would shudder at , they bring our dear brother here departed to receive Christian burial . With houses looking on , on every side , save where a reeking little tunnel of a court gives access to the iron gate — with every villainy of life in action close on death , and every poisonous element of death in action close on life — here they lower our dear brother down a foot or two , here sow him in corruption , to be raised in corruption : an avenging ghost at many a sick - bedside , a shameful testimony to future ages how civilization and barbarism walked this boastful island together . Come night , come darkness , for you can not come too soon or stay too long by such a place as this ! Come , straggling lights into the windows of the ugly houses ; and you who do iniquity therein , do it at least with this dread scene shut out ! Come , flame of gas , burning so sullenly above the iron gate , on which the poisoned air deposits its witch - ointment slimy to the touch ! It is well that you should call to every passerby , “
75628	75726	75233	75233	I	0	” With the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel - court to the outside of the iron gate . It holds the gate with its hands and looks in between the bars , stands looking in for a little while . It then , with an old broom it carries , softly sweeps the step and makes the archway clean . It does so very busily and trimly , looks in again a little while , and so departs . Jo , is it thou ? Well , well ! Though a rejected witness , who “
75731	75769	75770	75770	He	2492	” what will be done to him in greater hands than men ’s , thou art not quite in outer darkness . There is something like a distant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this : “
75780	76624	76625	76625	You	2493	” CHAPTER XII On the Watch It has left off raining down in Lincolnshire at last , and Chesney Wold has taken heart . Mrs. Rouncewell is full of hospitable cares , for Sir Leicester and my Lady are coming home from Paris . The fashionable intelligence has found it out and communicates the glad tidings to benighted England . It has also found out that they will entertain a brilliant and distinguished circle of the ELITE of the BEAU MONDE ( the fashionable intelligence is weak in English , but a giant refreshed in French ) at the ancient and hospitable family seat in Lincolnshire . For the greater honour of the brilliant and distinguished circle , and of Chesney Wold into the bargain , the broken arch of the bridge in the park is mended ; and the water , now retired within its proper limits and again spanned gracefully , makes a figure in the prospect from the house . The clear , cold sunshine glances into the brittle woods and approvingly beholds the sharp wind scattering the leaves and drying the moss . It glides over the park after the moving shadows of the clouds , and chases them , and never catches them , all day . It looks in at the windows and touches the ancestral portraits with bars and patches of brightness never contemplated by the painters . Athwart the picture of my Lady , over the great chimney - piece , it throws a broad bend - sinister of light that strikes down crookedly into the hearth and seems to rend it . Through the same cold sunshine and the same sharp wind , my Lady and Sir Leicester , in their travelling chariot ( my Lady ’s woman and Sir Leicester ’s man affectionate in the rumble ) , start for home . With a considerable amount of jingling and whip - cracking , and many plunging demonstrations on the part of two bare - backed horses and two centaurs with glazed hats , jack - boots , and flowing manes and tails , they rattle out of the yard of the Hôtel Bristol in the Place Vendôme and canter between the sun - and - shadow - chequered colonnade of the Rue de Rivoli and the garden of the ill - fated palace of a headless king and queen , off by the Place of Concord , and the Elysian Fields , and the Gate of the Star , out of Paris . Sooth to say , they can not go away too fast , for even here my Lady Dedlock has been bored to death . Concert , assembly , opera , theatre , drive , nothing is new to my Lady under the worn - out heavens . Only last Sunday , when poor wretches were gay — within the walls playing with children among the clipped trees and the statues in the Palace Garden ; walking , a score abreast , in the Elysian Fields , made more Elysian by performing dogs and wooden horses ; between whiles filtering ( a few ) through the gloomy Cathedral of Our Lady to say a word or two at the base of a pillar within flare of a rusty little gridiron - full of gusty little tapers ; without the walls encompassing Paris with dancing , love - making , wine - drinking , tobacco - smoking , tomb - visiting , billiard card and domino playing , quack - doctoring , and much murderous refuse , animate and inanimate — only last Sunday , my Lady , in the desolation of Boredom and the clutch of Giant Despair , almost hated her own maid for being in spirits . She can not , therefore , go too fast from Paris . Weariness of soul lies before her , as it lies behind — her Ariel has put a girdle of it round the whole earth , and it can not be unclasped — but the imperfect remedy is always to fly from the last place where it has been experienced . Fling Paris back into the distance , then , exchanging it for endless avenues and cross - avenues of wintry trees ! And , when next beheld , let it be some leagues away , with the Gate of the Star a white speck glittering in the sun , and the city a mere mound in a plain — two dark square towers rising out of it , and light and shadow descending on it aslant , like the angels in Jacob ’s dream ! Sir Leicester is generally in a complacent state , and rarely bored . When he has nothing else to do , he can always contemplate his own greatness . It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so inexhaustible a subject . After reading his letters , he leans back in his corner of the carriage and generally reviews his importance to society . “
76635	76659	76625	76625	You	2493	” says my Lady after a long time . She is fatigued with reading . Has almost read a page in twenty miles . “
76669	76670	76671	76671	I	0	” “
76684	76685	76681	76681	I	0	” “
76690	76697	76686	76686	You	2493	” says Sir Leicester with admiration . “
76700	76705	76706	76706	He	269	” sighs my Lady . “
76714	76715	76716	76716	He	269	” “
76728	76740	76725	76725	he	269	” says Sir Leicester , selecting the letter and unfolding it , “
76774	76798	76799	76799	He	269	” Sir Leicester is so long in taking out his eye - glass and adjusting it that my Lady looks a little irritated . “
76909	76922	76903	76903	I	0	” My Lady , leaning forward , looks out of her window . “
76928	76933	76903	76903	I	0	” observes Sir Leicester . “
76942	76954	76934	76934	I	0	” says my Lady , still looking out of her window . “
76957	76967	76968	76968	I	0	” repeats Sir Leicester in a tone of surprise . “
76976	76984	76968	76968	I	0	” says my Lady with unmistakable distinctness . “
76991	77590	76968	76968	I	0	” The carriage is stopped , the affectionate man alights from the rumble , opens the door , and lets down the steps , obedient to an impatient motion of my Lady ’s hand . My Lady alights so quickly and walks away so quickly that Sir Leicester , for all his scrupulous politeness , is unable to assist her , and is left behind . A space of a minute or two has elapsed before he comes up with her . She smiles , looks very handsome , takes his arm , lounges with him for a quarter of a mile , is very much bored , and resumes her seat in the carriage . The rattle and clatter continue through the greater part of three days , with more or less of bell - jingling and whip - cracking , and more or less plunging of centaurs and bare - backed horses . Their courtly politeness to each other at the hotels where they tarry is the theme of general admiration . Though my Lord IS a little aged for my Lady , says Madame , the hostess of the Golden Ape , and though he might be her amiable father , one can see at a glance that they love each other . One observes my Lord with his white hair , standing , hat in hand , to help my Lady to and from the carriage . One observes my Lady , how recognisant of my Lord ’s politeness , with an inclination of her gracious head and the concession of her so - genteel fingers ! It is ravishing ! The sea has no appreciation of great men , but knocks them about like the small fry . It is habitually hard upon Sir Leicester , whose countenance it greenly mottles in the manner of sage - cheese and in whose aristocratic system it effects a dismal revolution . It is the Radical of Nature to him . Nevertheless , his dignity gets over it after stopping to refit , and he goes on with my Lady for Chesney Wold , lying only one night in London on the way to Lincolnshire . Through the same cold sunlight , colder as the day declines , and through the same sharp wind , sharper as the separate shadows of bare trees gloom together in the woods , and as the Ghost ’s Walk , touched at the western corner by a pile of fire in the sky , resigns itself to coming night , they drive into the park . The rooks , swinging in their lofty houses in the elm - tree avenue , seem to discuss the question of the occupancy of the carriage as it passes underneath , some agreeing that Sir Leicester and my Lady are come down , some arguing with malcontents who wo n’t admit it , now all consenting to consider the question disposed of , now all breaking out again in violent debate , incited by one obstinate and drowsy bird who will persist in putting in a last contradictory croak . Leaving them to swing and caw , the travelling chariot rolls on to the house , where fires gleam warmly through some of the windows , though not through so many as to give an inhabited expression to the darkening mass of front . But the brilliant and distinguished circle will soon do that . Mrs. Rouncewell is in attendance and receives Sir Leicester ’s customary shake of the hand with a profound curtsy . “
77606	77607	77608	77608	I	0	” “
77624	77625	77621	77622	Sir Leicester	266	” “
77633	77634	77630	77631	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	” “
77642	77707	77635	77636	My Lady	958	” says Mrs. Rouncewell with another curtsy . My Lady signifies , without profuse expenditure of words , that she is as wearily well as she can hope to be . But Rosa is in the distance , behind the housekeeper ; and my Lady , who has not subdued the quickness of her observation , whatever else she may have conquered , asks , “
77713	77714	77710	77711	that girl	2502	” “
77726	77727	77724	77724	Rosa	334	” “
77733	77746	77731	77731	Rosa	334	” Lady Dedlock beckons her , with even an appearance of interest . “
77759	77779	77750	77750	you	334	” she says , touching her shoulder with her two forefingers . Rosa , very much abashed , says , “
77789	77812	77786	77787	my Lady	958	” and glances up , and glances down , and do n’t know where to look , but looks all the prettier . “
77818	77819	77816	77816	you	334	” “
77825	77826	77816	77816	you	334	” “
77829	77835	77838	77838	they	2508	” repeats my Lady thoughtfully . “
77846	77847	77838	77838	they	2508	” “
77853	78050	77850	77851	my Lady	958	” My Lady taps her dimpled cheek with the same delicate gloved fingers and goes on to the foot of the oak staircase , where Sir Leicester pauses for her as her knightly escort . A staring old Dedlock in a panel , as large as life and as dull , looks as if he did n’t know what to make of it , which was probably his general state of mind in the days of Queen Elizabeth . That evening , in the housekeeper ’s room , Rosa can do nothing but murmur Lady Dedlock ’s praises . She is so affable , so graceful , so beautiful , so elegant ; has such a sweet voice and such a thrilling touch that Rosa can feel it yet ! Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this , not without personal pride , reserving only the one point of affability . Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that . Heaven forbid that she should say a syllable in dispraise of any member of that excellent family , above all , of my Lady , whom the whole world admires ; but if my Lady would only be “
78056	78073	77850	77851	my Lady	958	” not quite so cold and distant , Mrs. Rouncewell thinks she would be more affable . “
78080	78086	77850	77851	my Lady	958	” Mrs. Rouncewell adds — only “
78088	78113	78117	78118	no family	9985	” because it borders on impiety to suppose that anything could be better than it is , in such an express dispensation as the Dedlock affairs—“that
78151	78152	78139	78139	she	958	” “
78165	78185	78158	78158	her	958	” says Watt , who has been home and come back again , he is such a good grandson . “
78193	78200	78158	78158	her	958	” returns the housekeeper with dignity , “
78226	78227	78228	78228	I	0	” “
78244	78245	78236	78236	she	958	” “
78265	78266	78256	78258	The Dedlock family	2518	” “
78269	78273	78256	78258	The Dedlock family	2518	” says Watt , “
78308	78309	78310	78311	Sir Leicester	266	” “
78326	78327	78328	78329	Sir Leicester	266	” “
78337	78341	78343	78343	I	0	” says Watt , “
78390	78391	78399	78399	child	9522	” “
78401	78402	78399	78399	child	9522	” “
78409	78413	78403	78403	I	0	” says Watt , “
78429	78766	78415	78415	I	0	” He happens to glance at Rosa , who looks down and is very shy indeed . But according to the old superstition , it should be Rosa ’s ears that burn , and not her fresh bright cheeks , for my Lady ’s maid is holding forth about her at this moment with surpassing energy . My Lady ’s maid is a Frenchwoman of two and thirty , from somewhere in the southern country about Avignon and Marseilles , a large - eyed brown woman with black hair who would be handsome but for a certain feline mouth and general uncomfortable tightness of face , rendering the jaws too eager and the skull too prominent . There is something indefinably keen and wan about her anatomy , and she has a watchful way of looking out of the corners of her eyes without turning her head which could be pleasantly dispensed with , especially when she is in an ill humour and near knives . Through all the good taste of her dress and little adornments , these objections so express themselves that she seems to go about like a very neat she - wolf imperfectly tamed . Besides being accomplished in all the knowledge appertaining to her post , she is almost an Englishwoman in her acquaintance with the language ; consequently , she is in no want of words to shower upon Rosa for having attracted my Lady ’s attention , and she pours them out with such grim ridicule as she sits at dinner that her companion , the affectionate man , is rather relieved when she arrives at the spoon stage of that performance . Ha , ha , ha ! She , Hortense , been in my Lady ’s service since five years and always kept at the distance , and this doll , this puppet , caressed — absolutely caressed — by my Lady on the moment of her arriving at the house ! Ha , ha , ha ! “
78778	78779	78769	78769	you	2530	” “
78785	78791	78769	78769	you	2530	” You are right there ! “
78813	80557	78803	78803	they	2534	” Oh , how droll ! It is the BEST thing altogether . In short , it is such an admirable thing that Mademoiselle Hortense ca n’t forget it ; but at meals for days afterwards , even among her countrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of visitors , relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke — an enjoyment expressed , in her own convivial manner , by an additional tightness of face , thin elongation of compressed lips , and sidewise look , which intense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my Lady ’s mirrors when my Lady is not among them . All the mirrors in the house are brought into action now , many of them after a long blank . They reflect handsome faces , simpering faces , youthful faces , faces of threescore and ten that will not submit to be old ; the entire collection of faces that have come to pass a January week or two at Chesney Wold , and which the fashionable intelligence , a mighty hunter before the Lord , hunts with a keen scent , from their breaking cover at the Court of St. James ’s to their being run down to death . The place in Lincolnshire is all alive . By day guns and voices are heard ringing in the woods , horsemen and carriages enliven the park roads , servants and hangers - on pervade the village and the Dedlock Arms . Seen by night from distant openings in the trees , the row of windows in the long drawing - room , where my Lady ’s picture hangs over the great chimney - piece , is like a row of jewels set in a black frame . On Sunday the chill little church is almost warmed by so much gallant company , and the general flavour of the Dedlock dust is quenched in delicate perfumes . The brilliant and distinguished circle comprehends within it no contracted amount of education , sense , courage , honour , beauty , and virtue . Yet there is something a little wrong about it in despite of its immense advantages . What can it be ? Dandyism ? There is no King George the Fourth now ( more the pity ) to set the dandy fashion ; there are no clear - starched jack - towel neckcloths , no short - waisted coats , no false calves , no stays . There are no caricatures , now , of effeminate exquisites so arrayed , swooning in opera boxes with excess of delight and being revived by other dainty creatures poking long - necked scent - bottles at their noses . There is no beau whom it takes four men at once to shake into his buckskins , or who goes to see all the executions , or who is troubled with the self - reproach of having once consumed a pea . But is there dandyism in the brilliant and distinguished circle notwithstanding , dandyism of a more mischievous sort , that has got below the surface and is doing less harmless things than jack - towelling itself and stopping its own digestion , to which no rational person need particularly object ? Why , yes . It can not be disguised . There ARE at Chesney Wold this January week some ladies and gentlemen of the newest fashion , who have set up a dandyism — in religion , for instance . Who in mere lackadaisical want of an emotion have agreed upon a little dandy talk about the vulgar wanting faith in things in general , meaning in the things that have been tried and found wanting , as though a low fellow should unaccountably lose faith in a bad shilling after finding it out ! Who would make the vulgar very picturesque and faithful by putting back the hands upon the clock of time and cancelling a few hundred years of history . There are also ladies and gentlemen of another fashion , not so new , but very elegant , who have agreed to put a smooth glaze on the world and to keep down all its realities . For whom everything must be languid and pretty . Who have found out the perpetual stoppage . Who are to rejoice at nothing and be sorry for nothing . Who are not to be disturbed by ideas . On whom even the fine arts , attending in powder and walking backward like the Lord Chamberlain , must array themselves in the milliners ’ and tailors ’ patterns of past generations and be particularly careful not to be in earnest or to receive any impress from the moving age . Then there is my Lord Boodle , of considerable reputation with his party , who has known what office is and who tells Sir Leicester Dedlock with much gravity , after dinner , that he really does not see to what the present age is tending . A debate is not what a debate used to be ; the House is not what the House used to be ; even a Cabinet is not what it formerly was . He perceives with astonishment that supposing the present government to be overthrown , the limited choice of the Crown , in the formation of a new ministry , would lie between Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle — supposing it to be impossible for the Duke of Foodle to act with Goodle , which may be assumed to be the case in consequence of the breach arising out of that affair with Hoodle . Then , giving the Home Department and the leadership of the House of Commons to Joodle , the Exchequer to Koodle , the Colonies to Loodle , and the Foreign Office to Moodle , what are you to do with Noodle ? You ca n’t offer him the Presidency of the Council ; that is reserved for Poodle . You ca n’t put him in the Woods and Forests ; that is hardly good enough for Quoodle . What follows ? That the country is shipwrecked , lost , and gone to pieces ( as is made manifest to the patriotism of Sir Leicester Dedlock ) because you ca n’t provide for Noodle ! On the other hand , the Right Honourable William Buffy , M.P. , contends across the table with some one else that the shipwreck of the country — about which there is no doubt ; it is only the manner of it that is in question — is attributable to Cuffy . If you had done with Cuffy what you ought to have done when he first came into Parliament , and had prevented him from going over to Duffy , you would have got him into alliance with Fuffy , you would have had with you the weight attaching as a smart debater to Guffy , you would have brought to bear upon the elections the wealth of Huffy , you would have got in for three counties Juffy , Kuffy , and Luffy , and you would have strengthened your administration by the official knowledge and the business habits of Muffy . All this , instead of being as you now are , dependent on the mere caprice of Puffy ! As to this point , and as to some minor topics , there are differences of opinion ; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and distinguished circle , all round , that nobody is in question but Boodle and his retinue , and Buffy and HIS retinue . These are the great actors for whom the stage is reserved . A People there are , no doubt — a certain large number of supernumeraries , who are to be occasionally addressed , and relied upon for shouts and choruses , as on the theatrical stage ; but Boodle and Buffy , their followers and families , their heirs , executors , administrators , and assigns , are the born first - actors , managers , and leaders , and no others can appear upon the scene for ever and ever . In this , too , there is perhaps more dandyism at Chesney Wold than the brilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in the long run . For it is , even with the stillest and politest circles , as with the circle the necromancer draws around him — very strange appearances may be seen in active motion outside . With this difference , that being realities and not phantoms , there is the greater danger of their breaking in . Chesney Wold is quite full anyhow , so full that a burning sense of injury arises in the breasts of ill - lodged ladies’-maids , and is not to be extinguished . Only one room is empty . It is a turret chamber of the third order of merit , plainly but comfortably furnished and having an old - fashioned business air . It is Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s room , and is never bestowed on anybody else , for he may come at any time . He is not come yet . It is his quiet habit to walk across the park from the village in fine weather , to drop into this room as if he had never been out of it since he was last seen there , to request a servant to inform Sir Leicester that he is arrived in case he should be wanted , and to appear ten minutes before dinner in the shadow of the library - door . He sleeps in his turret with a complaining flag - staff over his head , and has some leads outside on which , any fine morning when he is down here , his black figure may be seen walking before breakfast like a larger species of rook . Every day before dinner , my Lady looks for him in the dusk of the library , but he is not there . Every day at dinner , my Lady glances down the table for the vacant place that would be waiting to receive him if he had just arrived , but there is no vacant place . Every night my Lady casually asks her maid , “
80563	80570	80559	80560	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” Every night the answer is , “
80579	80621	78803	78803	they	2534	” One night , while having her hair undressed , my Lady loses herself in deep thought after this reply until she sees her own brooding face in the opposite glass , and a pair of black eyes curiously observing her . “
80629	80641	80559	80560	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” says my Lady then , addressing the reflection of Hortense , “
80655	80656	80646	80646	You	269	” “
80666	80667	80661	80662	your Ladyship	2537	” “
80670	80675	80676	80676	you	269	” says my Lady , “
80683	80833	80676	80676	you	269	” At length , one afternoon a little before sunset , when the bright groups of figures which have for the last hour or two enlivened the Ghost ’s Walk are all dispersed and only Sir Leicester and my Lady remain upon the terrace , Mr. Tulkinghorn appears . He comes towards them at his usual methodical pace , which is never quickened , never slackened . He wears his usual expressionless mask — if it be a mask — and carries family secrets in every limb of his body and every crease of his dress . Whether his whole soul is devoted to the great or whether he yields them nothing beyond the services he sells is his personal secret . He keeps it , as he keeps the secrets of his clients ; he is his own client in that matter , and will never betray himself . “
80842	80901	80836	80836	you	2538	” says Sir Leicester , giving him his hand . Mr. Tulkinghorn is quite well . Sir Leicester is quite well . My Lady is quite well . All highly satisfactory . The lawyer , with his hands behind him , walks at Sir Leicester ’s side along the terrace . My Lady walks upon the other side . “
80907	80922	80923	80924	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” says Sir Leicester . A gracious observation . As much as to say , “
80959	80976	80944	80944	We	2539	” Mr. Tulkinghorn , comprehending it , inclines his head and says he is much obliged . “
80984	80988	80977	80977	I	0	” he explains , “
81008	81009	81010	81018	A man of a very ill - regulated mind	2541	” “
81020	81027	81010	81018	A man of a very ill - regulated mind	2541	” observes Sir Leicester with severity . “
81046	81047	81048	81048	He	2543	” “
81052	81057	81048	81048	He	2543	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
81069	81080	81081	81081	I	0	” says Sir Leicester , looking most profoundly obstinate himself . “
81091	81092	81081	81081	I	0	” “
81098	81103	81048	81048	He	2543	” pursues the lawyer , “
81111	81112	81125	81125	I	0	” “
81117	81122	81125	81125	I	0	” replies Sir Leicester . “
81129	81130	81131	81131	I	0	” “
81157	81158	81159	81160	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” “
81162	81167	81159	81160	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” returns Sir Leicester , “
81231	81239	81240	81240	I	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head again . “
81246	81250	81240	81240	I	0	” he says . “
81262	81263	81251	81252	Mr. Boythorn	359	” “
81276	81282	81273	81274	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” Sir Leicester interrupts him , “
81325	81335	81273	81274	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” adds Sir Leicester after a moment ’s pause , “
81345	81377	81287	81294	An exceedingly ill - conditioned , levelling person	2548	” Sir Leicester appears to discharge his stately breast of a burden in passing this capital sentence , as if it were the next satisfactory thing to having the sentence executed . “
81384	81388	81287	81294	An exceedingly ill - conditioned , levelling person	2548	” says he , “
81404	81424	81425	81425	You	269	” As they turn towards the hall - door , Lady Dedlock addresses Mr. Tulkinghorn for the first time . “
81484	81485	81486	81486	You	269	” “
81490	81495	81486	81486	You	269	” Mr. Tulkinghorn repeats . “
81500	81506	81486	81486	You	269	” returns my Lady carelessly . “
81536	81537	81517	81517	you	269	” “
81540	81541	81517	81517	you	269	” “
81546	81673	81517	81517	you	269	” They pass into a sombre breakfast - room on the ground floor , lighted in the day by two deep windows . It is now twilight . The fire glows brightly on the panelled wall and palely on the window - glass , where , through the cold reflection of the blaze , the colder landscape shudders in the wind and a grey mist creeps along , the only traveller besides the waste of clouds . My Lady lounges in a great chair in the chimney - corner , and Sir Leicester takes another great chair opposite . The lawyer stands before the fire with his hand out at arm ’s length , shading his face . He looks across his arm at my Lady . “
81676	81680	81681	81681	I	0	” he says , “
81702	81703	81698	81698	I	0	” “
81721	81727	81728	81728	I	0	” Lady Dedlock languidly anticipates . “
81733	81734	81728	81728	I	0	” “
81740	81762	81728	81728	I	0	” remonstrated Sir Leicester . Not so much shocked by the fact as by the fact of the fact being mentioned . “
81784	81785	81779	81779	I	0	” “
81794	81799	81791	81792	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” observes Sir Leicester . “
81806	81807	81800	81800	I	0	” “
81819	81828	81814	81814	me	0	” ( it is my Lady speaking ) . “
81843	81857	81860	81860	his	1619	” Mr. Tulkinghorn re - asserts it by another inclination of his head . “
81864	81865	81860	81860	his	1619	” “
81870	81875	81860	81860	his	1619	” cries Sir Leicester . “
81878	81879	81902	81902	I	0	” “
81887	81892	81882	81882	me	0	” says my Lady . “
81906	81907	81902	81902	I	0	” “
81921	81950	81951	81951	I	0	” Sir Leicester ’s gallantry concedes the point , though he still feels that to bring this sort of squalor among the upper classes is really — really — “
81957	81965	81951	81951	I	0	” resumes the lawyer with undisturbed calmness , “
82035	82036	82029	82029	he	1619	” “
82043	82048	82029	82029	he	1619	” my Lady asks , “
82054	82055	82029	82029	he	1619	” “
82061	82070	82029	82029	he	1619	” returns the lawyer , shaking his head . “
82124	82125	82105	82106	The surgeon	10623	” “
82134	82135	82136	82136	They	10623	” “
82152	82153	82136	82136	They	10623	” “
82164	82165	82136	82136	They	10623	” “
82185	82186	82183	82183	him	1619	” “
82194	82195	82183	82183	him	1619	” “
82202	82208	82209	82211	an old portmanteau	2570	” says the lawyer meditatively , “
82222	82354	82209	82211	an old portmanteau	2570	” During the utterance of every word of this short dialogue , Lady Dedlock and Mr. Tulkinghorn , without any other alteration in their customary deportment , have looked very steadily at one another — as was natural , perhaps , in the discussion of so unusual a subject . Sir Leicester has looked at the fire , with the general expression of the Dedlock on the staircase . The story being told , he renews his stately protest , saying that as it is quite clear that no association in my Lady ’s mind can possibly be traceable to this poor wretch ( unless he was a begging - letter writer ) , he trusts to hear no more about a subject so far removed from my Lady ’s station . “
82362	82374	82209	82211	an old portmanteau	2570	” says my Lady , gathering up her mantles and furs , “
82397	82742	82387	82388	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” Mr. Tulkinghorn does so with deference and holds it open while she passes out . She passes close to him , with her usual fatigued manner and insolent grace . They meet again at dinner — again , next day — again , for many days in succession . Lady Dedlock is always the same exhausted deity , surrounded by worshippers , and terribly liable to be bored to death , even while presiding at her own shrine . Mr. Tulkinghorn is always the same speechless repository of noble confidences , so oddly out of place and yet so perfectly at home . They appear to take as little note of one another as any two people enclosed within the same walls could . But whether each evermore watches and suspects the other , evermore mistrustful of some great reservation ; whether each is evermore prepared at all points for the other , and never to be taken unawares ; what each would give to know how much the other knows — all this is hidden , for the time , in their own hearts . CHAPTER XIII Esther ’s Narrative We held many consultations about what Richard was to be , first without Mr. Jarndyce , as he had requested , and afterwards with him , but it was a long time before we seemed to make progress . Richard said he was ready for anything . When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he might not already be too old to enter the Navy , Richard said he had thought of that , and perhaps he was . When Mr. Jarndyce asked him what he thought of the Army , Richard said he had thought of that , too , and it was n’t a bad idea . When Mr. Jarndyce advised him to try and decide within himself whether his old preference for the sea was an ordinary boyish inclination or a strong impulse , Richard answered , Well he really HAD tried very often , and he could n’t make out . “
82751	82758	82387	82388	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” Mr. Jarndyce said to me , “
82893	83161	83162	83162	I	0	” I felt this to be true ; though if I may venture to mention what I thought besides , I thought it much to be regretted that Richard ’s education had not counteracted those influences or directed his character . He had been eight years at a public school and had learnt , I understood , to make Latin verses of several sorts in the most admirable manner . But I never heard that it had been anybody ’s business to find out what his natural bent was , or where his failings lay , or to adapt any kind of knowledge to HIM . HE had been adapted to the verses and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection that if he had remained at school until he was of age , I suppose he could only have gone on making them over and over again unless he had enlarged his education by forgetting how to do it . Still , although I had no doubt that they were very beautiful , and very improving , and very sufficient for a great many purposes of life , and always remembered all through life , I did doubt whether Richard would not have profited by some one studying him a little , instead of his studying them quite so much . To be sure , I knew nothing of the subject and do not even now know whether the young gentlemen of classic Rome or Greece made verses to the same extent — or whether the young gentlemen of any country ever did . “
83169	83175	83177	83177	I	0	” said Richard , musing , “
83205	83206	83207	83207	You	0	” “
83217	83222	83207	83207	You	0	” suggested Mr. Jarndyce . “
83231	83235	83229	83229	sir	9496	” replied Richard . “
83258	83259	83260	83260	Surgeon	422	” “
83262	83267	83260	83260	Surgeon	422	” suggested Mr. Jarndyce . “
83275	83291	83273	83273	sir	9496	” cried Richard . I doubt if he had ever once thought of it before . “
83299	83307	83297	83297	sir	9496	” repeated Richard with the greatest enthusiasm . “
83317	83504	83260	83260	Surgeon	422	” He was not to be laughed out of it , though he laughed at it heartily . He said he had chosen his profession , and the more he thought of it , the more he felt that his destiny was clear ; the art of healing was the art of all others for him . Mistrusting that he only came to this conclusion because , having never had much chance of finding out for himself what he was fitted for and having never been guided to the discovery , he was taken by the newest idea and was glad to get rid of the trouble of consideration , I wondered whether the Latin verses often ended in this or whether Richard ’s was a solitary case . Mr. Jarndyce took great pains to talk with him seriously and to put it to his good sense not to deceive himself in so important a matter . Richard was a little grave after these interviews , but invariably told Ada and me that it was all right , and then began to talk about something else . “
83508	83535	83260	83260	Surgeon	422	” cried Mr. Boythorn , who interested himself strongly in the subject — though I need not say that , for he could do nothing weakly ; “
83600	83605	83647	83647	them	2588	” cried Mr. Boythorn , “
83661	83662	83665	83665	you	0	” “
83671	83676	83665	83665	you	0	” asked Mr. Jarndyce . “
83679	83685	83665	83665	you	0	” cried Mr. Boythorn firmly . “
83861	83882	83811	83811	clerks	900	” He wound up this vehement declaration by looking round upon us with a most agreeable smile and suddenly thundering , “
83889	83955	83811	83811	clerks	900	” over and over again , until anybody else might have been expected to be quite subdued by the exertion . As Richard still continued to say that he was fixed in his choice after repeated periods for consideration had been recommended by Mr. Jarndyce and had expired , and he still continued to assure Ada and me in the same final manner that it was “
83959	84024	83811	83811	clerks	900	” it became advisable to take Mr. Kenge into council . Mr. Kenge , therefore , came down to dinner one day , and leaned back in his chair , and turned his eye - glasses over and over , and spoke in a sonorous voice , and did exactly what I remembered to have seen him do when I was a little girl . “
84027	84032	83811	83811	clerks	900	” said Mr. Kenge . “
84050	84051	84042	84043	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” “
84064	84074	84042	84043	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” observed my guardian with a glance at Richard . “
84080	84085	84042	84043	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” said Mr. Kenge . “
84088	84089	84042	84043	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” “
84108	84113	84042	84043	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
84129	84130	84042	84043	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” “
84133	84138	84042	84043	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” said Mr. Kenge . “
84218	84219	84220	84220	You	286	” “
84226	84236	84220	84220	You	286	” said Richard in his off - hand manner , “
84248	84249	84238	84238	I	0	” “
84256	84266	84253	84254	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” said Mr. Kenge , gently nodding his head . “
84289	84298	84299	84299	I	0	” nodding feelingly and smoothly over those expressions , “
84346	84347	84348	84349	No one	814	” “
84356	84361	84351	84351	Rick	317	” said my guardian . “
84367	84371	84362	84363	No one	814	” said Richard . “
84375	84380	84362	84363	No one	814	” observed Mr. Kenge . “
84396	84397	84362	84363	No one	814	” “
84402	84406	84362	84363	No one	814	” said Richard . “
84410	84416	84417	84417	I	0	” observed Mr. Kenge again . “
84424	84428	84429	84429	I	0	” said Richard ; “
84437	84438	84429	84429	I	0	” “
84445	84450	84429	84429	I	0	” returned Mr. Kenge . “
84580	84593	84553	84553	I	0	” said Mr. Kenge with a tinge of melancholy in his smile , “
84654	85621	84651	84651	he	2609	” As this was an opening in the prospect , it was arranged that Mr. Kenge should see his cousin . And as Mr. Jarndyce had before proposed to take us to London for a few weeks , it was settled next day that we should make our visit at once and combine Richard ’s business with it . Mr. Boythorn leaving us within a week , we took up our abode at a cheerful lodging near Oxford Street over an upholsterer ’s shop . London was a great wonder to us , and we were out for hours and hours at a time , seeing the sights , which appeared to be less capable of exhaustion than we were . We made the round of the principal theatres , too , with great delight , and saw all the plays that were worth seeing . I mention this because it was at the theatre that I began to be made uncomfortable again by Mr. Guppy . I was sitting in front of the box one night with Ada , and Richard was in the place he liked best , behind Ada ’s chair , when , happening to look down into the pit , I saw Mr. Guppy , with his hair flattened down upon his head and woe depicted in his face , looking up at me . I felt all through the performance that he never looked at the actors but constantly looked at me , and always with a carefully prepared expression of the deepest misery and the profoundest dejection . It quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so very embarrassing and so very ridiculous . But from that time forth , we never went to the play without my seeing Mr. Guppy in the pit , always with his hair straight and flat , his shirt - collar turned down , and a general feebleness about him . If he were not there when we went in , and I began to hope he would not come and yielded myself for a little while to the interest of the scene , I was certain to encounter his languishing eyes when I least expected it and , from that time , to be quite sure that they were fixed upon me all the evening . I really can not express how uneasy this made me . If he would only have brushed up his hair or turned up his collar , it would have been bad enough ; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at me , and always in that demonstrative state of despondency , put such a constraint upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play , or to cry at it , or to move , or to speak . I seemed able to do nothing naturally . As to escaping Mr. Guppy by going to the back of the box , I could not bear to do that because I knew Richard and Ada relied on having me next them and that they could never have talked together so happily if anybody else had been in my place . So there I sat , not knowing where to look — for wherever I looked , I knew Mr. Guppy ’s eyes were following me — and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this young man was putting himself on my account . Sometimes I thought of telling Mr. Jarndyce . Then I feared that the young man would lose his situation and that I might ruin him . Sometimes I thought of confiding in Richard , but was deterred by the possibility of his fighting Mr. Guppy and giving him black eyes . Sometimes I thought , should I frown at him or shake my head . Then I felt I could not do it . Sometimes I considered whether I should write to his mother , but that ended in my being convinced that to open a correspondence would be to make the matter worse . I always came to the conclusion , finally , that I could do nothing . Mr. Guppy ’s perseverance , all this time , not only produced him regularly at any theatre to which we went , but caused him to appear in the crowd as we were coming out , and even to get up behind our fly — where I am sure I saw him , two or three times , struggling among the most dreadful spikes . After we got home , he haunted a post opposite our house . The upholsterer ’s where we lodged being at the corner of two streets , and my bedroom window being opposite the post , I was afraid to go near the window when I went upstairs , lest I should see him ( as I did one moonlight night ) leaning against the post and evidently catching cold . If Mr. Guppy had not been , fortunately for me , engaged in the daytime , I really should have had no rest from him . While we were making this round of gaieties , in which Mr. Guppy so extraordinarily participated , the business which had helped to bring us to town was not neglected . Mr. Kenge ’s cousin was a Mr. Bayham Badger , who had a good practice at Chelsea and attended a large public institution besides . He was quite willing to receive Richard into his house and to superintend his studies , and as it seemed that those could be pursued advantageously under Mr. Badger ’s roof , and Mr. Badger liked Richard , and as Richard said he liked Mr. Badger “
85625	85675	85939	85940	Miss Summerson	280	” an agreement was made , the Lord Chancellor ’s consent was obtained , and it was all settled . On the day when matters were concluded between Richard and Mr. Badger , we were all under engagement to dine at Mr. Badger ’s house . We were to be “
85681	85898	85939	85940	Miss Summerson	280	” Mrs. Badger ’s note said ; and we found no lady there but Mrs. Badger herself . She was surrounded in the drawing - room by various objects , indicative of her painting a little , playing the piano a little , playing the guitar a little , playing the harp a little , singing a little , working a little , reading a little , writing poetry a little , and botanizing a little . She was a lady of about fifty , I should think , youthfully dressed , and of a very fine complexion . If I add to the little list of her accomplishments that she rouged a little , I do not mean that there was any harm in it . Mr. Bayham Badger himself was a pink , fresh - faced , crisp - looking gentleman with a weak voice , white teeth , light hair , and surprised eyes , some years younger , I should say , than Mrs. Bayham Badger . He admired her exceedingly , but principally , and to begin with , on the curious ground ( as it seemed to us ) of her having had three husbands . We had barely taken our seats when he said to Mr. Jarndyce quite triumphantly , “
85912	85913	85906	85908	Mrs. Bayham Badger	424	” “
85916	85921	85922	85922	Her	424	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
85925	85930	85922	85922	Her	424	” said Mr. Badger . “
85952	85955	85939	85940	Miss Summerson	280	” I said “
85960	85961	85962	85965	And most remarkable men	2615	” “
85967	85977	85962	85965	And most remarkable men	2615	” said Mr. Badger in a tone of confidence . “
86016	86024	86003	86004	Professor Dingo	2619	” Mrs. Badger overheard him and smiled . “
86030	86038	86003	86004	Professor Dingo	2619	” Mr. Badger replied to the smile , “
86075	86076	86062	86062	they	2614	” “
86082	86087	86077	86077	I	0	” said Mrs. Badger , “
86130	86131	86127	86128	Professor Dingo	426	” “
86136	86144	86127	86128	Professor Dingo	426	” added Mr. Badger in an undertone . “
86154	86159	86127	86128	Professor Dingo	426	” pursued Mrs. Badger , “
86179	86180	86171	86171	I	0	” “
86199	86209	86192	86197	two of them highly distinguished men	2630	” said Mr. Badger , summing up the facts , “
86226	86233	86256	86258	three distinguished men	2632	” We all expressed our admiration . “
86241	86246	86247	86247	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
86260	86261	86247	86247	I	0	” “
86274	86279	86269	86269	I	0	” observed Mrs. Badger . “
86285	86290	86269	86269	I	0	” said Mr. Badger , “
86336	86344	86326	86326	I	0	” said Mr. Badger to us generally , “
86379	86395	86371	86371	you	9540	” continued Mr. Bayham Badger , leading the way into the next drawing - room , “
86446	86451	86426	86427	Mrs. Badger	424	” We all echoed , “
86457	86458	86459	86459	I	0	” “
86467	86472	86459	86459	I	0	” said Mr. Badger , “
86564	86623	86624	86624	Water	429	” Dinner was now announced , and we went downstairs . It was a very genteel entertainment , very handsomely served . But the captain and the professor still ran in Mr. Badger ’s head , and as Ada and I had the honour of being under his particular care , we had the full benefit of them . “
86648	86660	86646	86646	James	267	” Ada very much admired some artificial flowers under a glass . “
86666	86671	86672	86672	They	2643	” said Mr. Badger . “
86686	86698	86676	86678	Mrs. Bayham Badger	424	” He invited Mr. Jarndyce to take a glass of claret . “
86703	86707	86709	86709	me	0	” he said . “
86804	86888	86889	86892	The dear old Crippler	430	” After dinner , when we ladies retired , we took Mrs. Badger ’s first and second husband with us . Mrs. Badger gave us in the drawing - room a biographical sketch of the life and services of Captain Swosser before his marriage and a more minute account of him dating from the time when he fell in love with her at a ball on board the Crippler , given to the officers of that ship when she lay in Plymouth Harbour . “
86894	86903	86889	86892	The dear old Crippler	430	” said Mrs. Badger , shaking her head . “
87036	87051	87028	87028	his	425	” Mrs. Badger shook her head , sighed , and looked in the glass . “
87064	87072	87073	87073	I	0	” she resumed with a plaintive smile . “
87157	87256	87147	87148	Mr. Badger	423	” We then passed into a narrative of the deaths of Captain Swosser and Professor Dingo , both of whom seem to have had very bad complaints . In the course of it , Mrs. Badger signified to us that she had never madly loved but once and that the object of that wild affection , never to be recalled in its fresh enthusiasm , was Captain Swosser . The professor was yet dying by inches in the most dismal manner , and Mrs. Badger was giving us imitations of his way of saying , with great difficulty , “
87270	87381	87262	87262	Laura	431	” when the entrance of the gentlemen consigned him to the tomb . Now , I observed that evening , as I had observed for some days past , that Ada and Richard were more than ever attached to each other ’s society , which was but natural , seeing that they were going to be separated so soon . I was therefore not very much surprised when we got home , and Ada and I retired upstairs , to find Ada more silent than usual , though I was not quite prepared for her coming into my arms and beginning to speak to me , with her face hidden . “
87386	87390	87262	87262	Laura	431	” murmured Ada . “
87400	87412	87391	87391	I	0	” A mighty secret , my pretty one , no doubt ! “
87419	87420	87417	87417	Ada	290	” “
87430	87431	87423	87423	Esther	280	” “
87438	87441	87423	87423	Esther	280	” said I. “
87453	87468	87423	87423	Esther	280	” cried Ada , very much startled by the idea of my doing so . “
87479	87487	87488	87488	It	2658	” said I , pretending to consider . “
87492	87499	87488	87488	It	2658	” said Ada in a whisper . “
87508	87509	87506	87506	Richard	291	” “
87515	87531	87506	87506	Richard	291	” said I , kissing her bright hair , which was all I could see . “
87537	87538	87506	87506	Richard	291	” “
87548	87600	87601	87601	He	9662	” It was so pretty to have her clinging to me in that way , hiding her face , and to know that she was not crying in sorrow but in a little glow of joy , and pride , and hope , that I would not help her just yet . “
87621	87628	87618	87618	he	9662	” with a burst of tears , “
87637	87638	87640	87640	he	9662	” “
87643	87646	87640	87640	he	9662	” said I. “
87673	87706	87662	87662	I	0	” To see Ada lift up her flushed face in joyful surprise , and hold me round the neck , and laugh , and cry , and blush , was so pleasant ! “
87712	87716	87662	87662	I	0	” said I , “
87746	87747	87728	87728	Richard	291	” “
87758	87765	87750	87750	you	280	” cried Ada , kissing me . “
87771	87774	87750	87750	you	280	” said I. “
87781	87782	87750	87750	you	280	” “
87802	87838	87800	87800	you	280	” returned Ada . She might have coaxed me to say no if I had been the hardest - hearted duenna in the world . Not being that yet , I said no very freely . “
87842	87846	87847	87847	I	0	” said I , “
87854	87855	87847	87847	I	0	” “
87870	87887	87867	87867	Esther	280	” cried Ada , holding me tighter and laying down her face again upon my breast . “
87890	87893	87949	87949	You	2665	” said I. “
87898	87899	87949	87949	You	2665	” “
87906	87914	87949	87949	You	2665	” said Ada , shaking her head . “
87923	87943	87917	87917	you	0	” I was beginning in joke . But Ada , looking up and smiling through her tears , cried , “
87957	87963	87952	87952	you	2665	” And then sobbed out , “
87979	88041	87977	87977	Esther	280	” I told her , laughing , why I had known that , too , just as well as I had known the other ! And we sat before the fire , and I had all the talking to myself for a little while ( though there was not much of it ) ; and Ada was soon quiet and happy . “
88054	88058	88043	88043	you	2665	” she asked . “
88069	88073	88062	88062	John	318	” said I , “
88089	88090	88079	88079	John	318	” “
88101	88106	88108	88108	we	2670	” said Ada timidly , “
88134	88135	88131	88132	Dame Durden	343	” “
88148	88151	88143	88143	he	318	” said I. “
88158	88180	88143	88143	he	318	” returned Ada with a bashful simplicity that would have won my heart if she had not won it long before , “
88191	88466	88184	88184	he	318	” There he was , of course . They brought a chair on either side of me , and put me between them , and really seemed to have fallen in love with me instead of one another , they were so confiding , and so trustful , and so fond of me . They went on in their own wild way for a little while — I never stopped them ; I enjoyed it too much myself — and then we gradually fell to considering how young they were , and how there must be a lapse of several years before this early love could come to anything , and how it could come to happiness only if it were real and lasting and inspired them with a steady resolution to do their duty to each other , with constancy , fortitude , and perseverance , each always for the other ’s sake . Well ! Richard said that he would work his fingers to the bone for Ada , and Ada said that she would work her fingers to the bone for Richard , and they called me all sorts of endearing and sensible names , and we sat there , advising and talking , half the night . Finally , before we parted , I gave them my promise to speak to their cousin John to - morrow . So , when to - morrow came , I went to my guardian after breakfast , in the room that was our town - substitute for the growlery , and told him that I had it in trust to tell him something . “
88472	88481	88469	88470	little woman	2039	” said he , shutting up his book , “
88497	88498	88499	88499	I	0	” “
88505	88508	88503	88503	guardian	10146	” said I. “
88526	88527	88503	88503	guardian	10146	” “
88537	88538	88535	88535	Esther	280	” “
88541	88545	88539	88539	Guardian	10146	” said I , “
88569	88598	88561	88561	Ada	290	” I wished to call to his remembrance the look he had given me then . Unless I am much mistaken , I saw that I did so . “
88601	88609	88612	88613	my dear	9540	” said I with a little hesitation . “
88615	88619	88612	88613	my dear	9540	” said he . “
88624	88625	88612	88613	my dear	9540	” “
88628	88632	88633	88633	Ada	290	” said I , “
88648	88649	88644	88645	each other	10058	” “
88652	88660	88644	88645	each other	10058	” cried my guardian , quite astonished . “
88663	88666	88644	88645	each other	10058	” said I. “
88681	88682	88674	88674	guardian	10146	” “
88688	88757	88758	88758	Rick	317	” said he . He sat considering for a minute or two , with his smile , at once so handsome and so kind , upon his changing face , and then requested me to let them know that he wished to see them . When they came , he encircled Ada with one arm in his fatherly way and addressed himself to Richard with a cheerful gravity . “
88760	88765	88758	88758	Rick	317	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
88874	88875	88869	88869	Rick	317	” “
88883	88887	88869	88869	Rick	317	” returned Richard . “
88890	88895	88869	88869	Rick	317	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
89116	89117	89118	89118	I	0	” “
89125	89129	89118	89118	I	0	” returned Richard , “

89168	89176	89137	89137	I	0	” said Ada , on his shoulder , “

89208	89213	89232	89232	Rick	317	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
89381	89382	89383	89383	I	0	” “
89391	89396	89383	89383	I	0	” replied Richard smiling , “
89428	89429	89422	89422	Ada	290	” “
89432	89437	89422	89422	Ada	290	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
89453	89454	89449	89449	you	0	” “
89470	89475	89449	89449	you	0	” retorted Richard proudly . “
89479	89484	89449	89449	you	0	” cried Mr. Jarndyce . “
89553	89746	89542	89542	I	0	” Ada tenderly embraced him , and Richard heartily shook hands with him , and then the cousins went out of the room , looking back again directly , though , to say that they would wait for me . The door stood open , and we both followed them with our eyes as they passed down the adjoining room , on which the sun was shining , and out at its farther end . Richard with his head bent , and her hand drawn through his arm , was talking to her very earnestly ; and she looked up in his face , listening , and seemed to see nothing else . So young , so beautiful , so full of hope and promise , they went on lightly through the sunlight as their own happy thoughts might then be traversing the years to come and making them all years of brightness . So they passed away into the shadow and were gone . It was only a burst of light that had been so radiant . The room darkened as they went out , and the sun was clouded over . “
89753	89776	89751	89751	Esther	280	” said my guardian when they were gone . He was so good and wise to ask ME whether he was right ! “
89802	89811	89812	89812	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce , shaking his head . “
89830	89863	89821	89821	She	290	” And he laid his hand lovingly upon my head . I could not help showing that I was a little moved , though I did all I could to conceal it . “
89867	89871	89821	89821	She	290	” said he . “
89895	89896	89899	89899	My	0	” “
89914	89915	89916	89916	I	0	” “

89953	90216	89939	89941	the little woman	2720	” I have omitted to mention in its place that there was some one else at the family dinner party . It was not a lady . It was a gentleman . It was a gentleman of a dark complexion — a young surgeon . He was rather reserved , but I thought him very sensible and agreeable . At least , Ada asked me if I did not , and I said yes . CHAPTER XIV Deportment Richard left us on the very next evening to begin his new career , and committed Ada to my charge with great love for her and great trust in me . It touched me then to reflect , and it touches me now , more nearly , to remember ( having what I have to tell ) how they both thought of me , even at that engrossing time . I was a part of all their plans , for the present and the future . I was to write Richard once a week , making my faithful report of Ada , who was to write to him every alternate day . I was to be informed , under his own hand , of all his labours and successes ; I was to observe how resolute and persevering he would be ; I was to be Ada ’s bridesmaid when they were married ; I was to live with them afterwards ; I was to keep all the keys of their house ; I was to be made happy for ever and a day . “
90235	90249	90252	90252	Ada	290	” said Richard to crown all . A shade crossed Ada ’s face . “
90254	90258	90252	90252	Ada	290	” asked Richard , “
90262	90263	90252	90252	Ada	290	” “
90273	90277	90264	90264	It	2724	” said Ada . “
90287	90291	90280	90280	I	0	” returned Richard , “
90317	90318	90305	90305	It	2724	” “
90322	90326	90305	90305	It	2724	” said Ada . “
90331	90345	90305	90305	It	2724	” urged Richard , answering what her look suggested rather than her words , “
90375	90376	90377	90377	You	0	” “
90399	90400	90384	90384	I	0	” “
90415	90420	90404	90404	Ada	290	” cried Richard gaily . “
90497	90498	90451	90452	The court	781	” “
90501	90505	90451	90452	The court	781	” said Ada , “
90517	90518	90548	90548	her	343	” “
90523	90527	90548	90548	her	343	” cried Richard , “
90557	90558	90559	90560	Dame Durden	343	” “
90565	90582	90559	90560	Dame Durden	343	” said I , looking out of the box in which I was packing his books , “
90609	90918	90601	90601	she	343	” So , Richard said there was an end of it , and immediately began , on no other foundation , to build as many castles in the air as would man the Great Wall of China . He went away in high spirits . Ada and I , prepared to miss him very much , commenced our quieter career . On our arrival in London , we had called with Mr. Jarndyce at Mrs. Jellyby ’s but had not been so fortunate as to find her at home . It appeared that she had gone somewhere to a tea - drinking and had taken Miss Jellyby with her . Besides the tea - drinking , there was to be some considerable speech - making and letter - writing on the general merits of the cultivation of coffee , conjointly with natives , at the Settlement of Borrioboola - Gha . All this involved , no doubt , sufficient active exercise of pen and ink to make her daughter ’s part in the proceedings anything but a holiday . It being now beyond the time appointed for Mrs. Jellyby ’s return , we called again . She was in town , but not at home , having gone to Mile End directly after breakfast on some Borrioboolan business , arising out of a society called the East London Branch Aid Ramification . As I had not seen Peepy on the occasion of our last call ( when he was not to be found anywhere , and when the cook rather thought he must have strolled away with the dustman ’s cart ) , I now inquired for him again . The oyster shells he had been building a house with were still in the passage , but he was nowhere discoverable , and the cook supposed that he had “
90924	90933	90601	90601	she	343	” When we repeated , with some surprise , “
90937	91242	90601	90601	she	343	” she said , Oh , yes , on market days he sometimes followed them quite out of town and came back in such a state as never was ! I was sitting at the window with my guardian on the following morning , and Ada was busy writing — of course to Richard — when Miss Jellyby was announced , and entered , leading the identical Peepy , whom she had made some endeavours to render presentable by wiping the dirt into corners of his face and hands and making his hair very wet and then violently frizzling it with her fingers . Everything the dear child wore was either too large for him or too small . Among his other contradictory decorations he had the hat of a bishop and the little gloves of a baby . His boots were , on a small scale , the boots of a ploughman , while his legs , so crossed and recrossed with scratches that they looked like maps , were bare below a very short pair of plaid drawers finished off with two frills of perfectly different patterns . The deficient buttons on his plaid frock had evidently been supplied from one of Mr. Jellyby ’s coats , they were so extremely brazen and so much too large . Most extraordinary specimens of needlework appeared on several parts of his dress , where it had been hastily mended , and I recognized the same hand on Miss Jellyby ’s . She was , however , unaccountably improved in her appearance and looked very pretty . She was conscious of poor little Peepy being but a failure after all her trouble , and she showed it as she came in by the way in which she glanced first at him and then at us . “
91248	91253	90601	90601	she	343	” said my guardian . “
91257	91282	91283	91283	Ma	308	” Ada and I gave her a cordial welcome and presented her to Mr. Jarndyce , to whom she said as she sat down , “
91339	91348	91335	91335	Ma	2733	” With which she presented it sulkily enough . “
91352	91357	91350	91350	you	2732	” said my guardian . “
91378	91454	91455	91455	We	2734	” We were busy with Peepy , taking off his clerical hat , asking him if he remembered us , and so on . Peepy retired behind his elbow at first , but relented at the sight of sponge - cake and allowed me to take him on my lap , where he sat munching quietly . Mr. Jarndyce then withdrawing into the temporary growlery , Miss Jellyby opened a conversation with her usual abruptness . “
91468	91472	91455	91455	We	2734	” said she . “
91506	91514	91503	91504	a brother	10350	” I tried to say something soothing . “
91526	91531	91503	91504	a brother	10350	” exclaimed Miss Jellyby , “
91584	91585	91572	91572	Peepy	302	” “
91590	91594	91586	91586	I	0	” said Peepy . “
91608	91618	91601	91606	naughty , hard - hearted boy	2739	” returned Miss Jellyby with tears in her eyes . “
91630	91631	91619	91619	I	0	” “
91640	91666	91638	91638	Caddy	300	” cried Peepy , who was really a good child and who was so moved by his sister ’s vexation that he went at once . “
91676	91683	91638	91638	Caddy	300	” said poor Miss Jellyby apologetically , “
91743	91782	91786	91786	him	2740	” Peepy , happily unconscious of the defects in his appearance , sat on the carpet behind one of the legs of the piano , looking calmly out of his den at us while he ate his cake . “
91795	91806	91783	91783	I	0	” observed Miss Jellyby , drawing her chair nearer ours , “
91868	91887	91862	91862	Ma	308	” We said we hoped Mr. Jellyby ’s affairs were not in so bad a state as that . “
91903	91912	91913	91913	Pa	309	” returned Miss Jellyby , shaking her head . “
92012	92013	92000	92000	I	0	” “
92017	92023	92000	92000	I	0	” said I , smiling . “
92034	92035	92024	92025	Your papa	2752	” “
92050	92055	92047	92048	Miss Summerson	280	” replied Miss Jellyby ; “
92112	92126	92127	92127	I	0	” Miss Jellyby tapped her foot upon the floor and wiped her eyes . “
92137	92141	92130	92130	I	0	” she said , “
92216	92259	92208	92208	I	0	” said poor Miss Jellyby . I must confess that I could not help feeling rather angry with Mrs. Jellyby myself , seeing and hearing this neglected girl and knowing how much of bitterly satirical truth there was in what she said . “
92276	92281	92270	92270	you	2763	” pursued Miss Jellyby , “
92338	92359	92312	92312	I	0	” She said this with such great significance that Ada and I glanced at one another , foreseeing something more . “
92362	92371	92312	92312	I	0	” said Miss Jellyby , shaking her head . “
92398	92399	92394	92394	I	0	” “
92406	92409	92394	92394	I	0	” said I. “
92419	92433	92414	92414	me	0	” she returned , justifying herself in a fretful but not angry manner , “
92459	92460	92457	92457	HIM	309	” “
92481	92484	92457	92457	HIM	309	” said I. “
92487	92494	92457	92457	HIM	309	” said Miss Jellyby , softening . “
92543	92720	92533	92533	they	1510	” There was a good deal of affection in poor Caddy . She softened more and more while saying this and cried so much over the unwonted little home - picture she had raised in her mind that Peepy , in his cave under the piano , was touched , and turned himself over on his back with loud lamentations . It was not until I had brought him to kiss his sister , and had restored him to his place on my lap , and had shown him that Caddy was laughing ( she laughed expressly for the purpose ) , that we could recall his peace of mind ; even then it was for some time conditional on his taking us in turns by the chin and smoothing our faces all over with his hand . At last , as his spirits were not equal to the piano , we put him on a chair to look out of window ; and Miss Jellyby , holding him by one leg , resumed her confidence . “
92730	92739	92724	92724	your	2770	” she said . We naturally asked how . “
92747	92751	92742	92742	I	0	” she replied , “
92832	92833	92824	92825	Mr. Turveydrop	434	” “
92842	92846	92824	92825	Mr. Turveydrop	434	” I began . “
92853	92857	92859	92859	I	0	” said Caddy , “
92913	92914	92906	92906	I	0	” “
92922	92926	92927	92927	I	0	” said I , “
92931	92932	92927	92927	I	0	” “
92943	92950	92938	92938	you	0	” she retorted a little anxiously , “
93026	93027	93017	93020	a very gentlemanly man	2781	” “
93035	93039	93017	93020	a very gentlemanly man	2781	” asked Ada . “
93049	93058	93046	93047	Miss Clare	290	” returned Miss Jellyby , opening her eyes . “
93070	93164	93067	93068	a widower	2785	” We were here interrupted by Peepy , whose leg had undergone so much on account of his sister ’s unconsciously jerking it like a bell - rope whenever she was emphatic that the afflicted child now bemoaned his sufferings with a very low - spirited noise . As he appealed to me for compassion , and as I was only a listener , I undertook to hold him . Miss Jellyby proceeded , after begging Peepy ’s pardon with a kiss and assuring him that she had n’t meant to do it . “
93173	93177	93067	93068	a widower	2785	” said Caddy . “
93238	93245	93247	93247	I	0	” said Caddy with a sob , “
93287	93288	93284	93284	he	436	” “
93300	93303	93291	93291	he	436	” said I. “
93308	93312	93291	93291	he	436	” said Caddy . “
93322	93323	93325	93325	he	436	” “
93328	93332	93325	93325	he	436	” asked Ada . “
93343	93347	93335	93335	he	436	” replied Caddy . “
93354	93438	93439	93439	I	0	” Caddy went on to say with considerable hesitation and reluctance that there was one thing more she wished us to know , and felt we ought to know , and which she hoped would not offend us . It was that she had improved her acquaintance with Miss Flite , the little crazy old lady , and that she frequently went there early in the morning and met her lover for a few minutes before breakfast — only for a few minutes . “
93446	93450	93439	93439	I	0	” said Caddy , “
93621	93634	93618	93618	you	2792	” said Caddy , who had said all this earnestly and tremblingly , “
93644	94151	93635	93635	I	0	” It happened that we had arranged with my guardian to go to Miss Flite ’s that day . We had told him of our former visit , and our account had interested him ; but something had always happened to prevent our going there again . As I trusted that I might have sufficient influence with Miss Jellyby to prevent her taking any very rash step if I fully accepted the confidence she was so willing to place in me , poor girl , I proposed that she and I and Peepy should go to the academy and afterwards meet my guardian and Ada at Miss Flite ’s , whose name I now learnt for the first time . This was on condition that Miss Jellyby and Peepy should come back with us to dinner . The last article of the agreement being joyfully acceded to by both , we smartened Peepy up a little with the assistance of a few pins , some soap and water , and a hair - brush , and went out , bending our steps towards Newman Street , which was very near . I found the academy established in a sufficiently dingy house at the corner of an archway , with busts in all the staircase windows . In the same house there were also established , as I gathered from the plates on the door , a drawing - master , a coal - merchant ( there was , certainly , no room for his coals ) , and a lithographic artist . On the plate which , in size and situation , took precedence of all the rest , I read , MR . TURVEYDROP . The door was open , and the hall was blocked up by a grand piano , a harp , and several other musical instruments in cases , all in progress of removal , and all looking rakish in the daylight . Miss Jellyby informed me that the academy had been lent , last night , for a concert . We went upstairs — it had been quite a fine house once , when it was anybody ’s business to keep it clean and fresh , and nobody ’s business to smoke in it all day — and into Mr. Turveydrop ’s great room , which was built out into a mews at the back and was lighted by a skylight . It was a bare , resounding room smelling of stables , with cane forms along the walls , and the walls ornamented at regular intervals with painted lyres and little cut - glass branches for candles , which seemed to be shedding their old - fashioned drops as other branches might shed autumn leaves . Several young lady pupils , ranging from thirteen or fourteen years of age to two or three and twenty , were assembled ; and I was looking among them for their instructor when Caddy , pinching my arm , repeated the ceremony of introduction . “
94159	94281	94282	94282	I	0	” I curtsied to a little blue - eyed fair man of youthful appearance with flaxen hair parted in the middle and curling at the ends all round his head . He had a little fiddle , which we used to call at school a kit , under his left arm , and its little bow in the same hand . His little dancing - shoes were particularly diminutive , and he had a little innocent , feminine manner which not only appealed to me in an amiable way , but made this singular effect upon me , that I received the impression that he was like his mother and that his mother had not been much considered or well used . “
94293	94302	94282	94282	I	0	” he said , bowing low to me . “
94308	94313	94303	94303	I	0	” with timid tenderness , “
94329	94330	94331	94331	I	0	” “
94357	94360	94355	94355	sir	9496	” said I. “
94365	94369	94355	94355	sir	9496	” said he . “
94373	94377	94355	94355	sir	9496	” I entreated , “
94391	94731	94732	94732	Father	2776	” With that apology I withdrew to a seat between Peepy ( who , being well used to it , had already climbed into a corner place ) and an old lady of a censorious countenance whose two nieces were in the class and who was very indignant with Peepy ’s boots . Prince Turveydrop then tinkled the strings of his kit with his fingers , and the young ladies stood up to dance . Just then there appeared from a side - door old Mr. Turveydrop , in the full lustre of his deportment . He was a fat old gentleman with a false complexion , false teeth , false whiskers , and a wig . He had a fur collar , and he had a padded breast to his coat , which only wanted a star or a broad blue ribbon to be complete . He was pinched in , and swelled out , and got up , and strapped down , as much as he could possibly bear . He had such a neckcloth on ( puffing his very eyes out of their natural shape ) , and his chin and even his ears so sunk into it , that it seemed as though he must inevitably double up if it were cast loose . He had under his arm a hat of great size and weight , shelving downward from the crown to the brim , and in his hand a pair of white gloves with which he flapped it as he stood poised on one leg in a high - shouldered , round - elbowed state of elegance not to be surpassed . He had a cane , he had an eye - glass , he had a snuff - box , he had rings , he had wristbands , he had everything but any touch of nature ; he was not like youth , he was not like age , he was not like anything in the world but a model of deportment . “
94745	94746	94742	94743	Miss Summerson	280	” “
94749	94754	94742	94743	Miss Summerson	280	” said Mr. Turveydrop , “
94761	94786	94787	94788	My father	1820	” As he bowed to me in that tight state , I almost believe I saw creases come into the whites of his eyes . “
94790	94807	94787	94788	My father	1820	” said the son , aside , to me with quite an affecting belief in him , “
94819	94820	94787	94788	My father	1820	” “
94829	94847	94787	94788	My father	1820	” said Mr. Turveydrop , standing with his back to the fire and waving his gloves condescendingly . “
94854	94946	94948	94948	he	1820	” At this command , or by this gracious permission , the lesson went on . Prince Turveydrop sometimes played the kit , dancing ; sometimes played the piano , standing ; sometimes hummed the tune with what little breath he could spare , while he set a pupil right ; always conscientiously moved with the least proficient through every step and every part of the figure ; and never rested for an instant . His distinguished father did nothing whatever but stand before the fire , a model of deportment . “
94954	94964	94948	94948	he	1820	” said the old lady of the censorious countenance . “
94980	94981	94967	94967	you	437	” “
94993	94996	94990	94990	you	437	” said I. “
95014	95020	95007	95007	he	1820	” returned the old lady . “
95028	95039	95007	95007	he	1820	” It certainly was plain — threadbare — almost shabby . “
95050	95056	95041	95042	the father	2805	” said the old lady , “
95073	95087	95068	95068	him	2805	” I felt curious to know more concerning this person . I asked , “
95096	95097	95089	95089	he	2805	” “
95100	95107	95089	95089	he	2805	” returned the old lady shortly . “
95111	95128	95089	95089	he	2805	” After a moment ’s consideration , I suggested that perhaps fencing had been his accomplishment . “
95141	95479	95133	95133	he	2805	” said the old lady . I looked surprised and inquisitive . The old lady , becoming more and more incensed against the master of deportment as she dwelt upon the subject , gave me some particulars of his career , with strong assurances that they were mildly stated . He had married a meek little dancing - mistress , with a tolerable connexion ( having never in his life before done anything but deport himself ) , and had worked her to death , or had , at the best , suffered her to work herself to death , to maintain him in those expenses which were indispensable to his position . At once to exhibit his deportment to the best models and to keep the best models constantly before himself , he had found it necessary to frequent all public places of fashionable and lounging resort , to be seen at Brighton and elsewhere at fashionable times , and to lead an idle life in the very best clothes . To enable him to do this , the affectionate little dancing - mistress had toiled and laboured and would have toiled and laboured to that hour if her strength had lasted so long . For the mainspring of the story was that in spite of the man ’s absorbing selfishness , his wife ( overpowered by his deportment ) had , to the last , believed in him and had , on her death - bed , in the most moving terms , confided him to their son as one who had an inextinguishable claim upon him and whom he could never regard with too much pride and deference . The son , inheriting his mother ’s belief , and having the deportment always before him , had lived and grown in the same faith , and now , at thirty years of age , worked for his father twelve hours a day and looked up to him with veneration on the old imaginary pinnacle . “
95487	95520	95485	95485	himself	2221	” said my informant , shaking her head at old Mr. Turveydrop with speechless indignation as he drew on his tight gloves , of course unconscious of the homage she was rendering . “
95556	95568	95569	95569	I	0	” said the old lady , apostrophizing him with infinite vehemence . “
95574	95749	95569	95569	I	0	” I could not help being amused , though I heard the old lady out with feelings of real concern . It was difficult to doubt her with the father and son before me . What I might have thought of them without the old lady ’s account , or what I might have thought of the old lady ’s account without them , I can not say . There was a fitness of things in the whole that carried conviction with it . My eyes were yet wandering , from young Mr. Turveydrop working so hard , to old Mr. Turveydrop deporting himself so beautifully , when the latter came ambling up to me and entered into conversation . He asked me , first of all , whether I conferred a charm and a distinction on London by residing in it ? I did not think it necessary to reply that I was perfectly aware I should not do that , in any case , but merely told him where I did reside . “
95757	95773	95569	95569	I	0	” he said , kissing his right glove and afterwards extending it towards the pupils , “
95793	95834	95784	95784	our	2814	” He sat down beside me , taking some pains to sit on the form , I thought , in imitation of the print of his illustrious model on the sofa . And really he did look very like it . “
95842	95857	95784	95784	our	2814	” he repeated , taking a pinch of snuff and gently fluttering his fingers . “
95880	95905	95784	95784	our	2814	” with the high - shouldered bow , which it seemed impossible for him to make without lifting up his eyebrows and shutting his eyes “
95920	95921	95784	95784	our	2814	” “
95928	95931	95926	95926	sir	9496	” said I. “
95936	95957	95932	95932	We	2814	” he returned , shaking his head , which he could do to a very limited extent in his cravat . “
96086	96087	96076	96076	ma’am	9572	” “
96090	96102	96076	96076	ma’am	9572	” said I. He replied with the high - shouldered bow . “
96112	96116	96076	96076	ma’am	9572	” he added , “
96159	96160	96157	96157	weavers	2825	” “
96174	96177	96161	96161	One	1501	” said I. “
96183	96194	96195	96195	You	0	” He smiled with a high - shouldered bow again . “
96239	96240	96241	96241	He	2829	” “
96249	96253	96241	96241	He	2829	” I observed . “
96292	96310	96263	96265	an excellent master	1887	” He took another pinch of snuff and made the bow again , as if to add , “
96319	96348	96263	96265	an excellent master	1887	” I glanced towards the centre of the room , where Miss Jellyby ’s lover , now engaged with single pupils , was undergoing greater drudgery than ever . “
96353	96362	96263	96265	an excellent master	1887	” murmured Mr. Turveydrop , adjusting his cravat . “
96368	96371	96363	96363	Your	0	” said I. “
96377	96382	96374	96374	my	0	” said Mr. Turveydrop , “
96415	96424	96412	96413	lovely wooman	2838	” said Mr. Turveydrop with very disagreeable gallantry , “
96431	96500	96501	96501	My	0	” I rose and joined Miss Jellyby , who was by this time putting on her bonnet . The time allotted to a lesson having fully elapsed , there was a general putting on of bonnets . When Miss Jellyby and the unfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I do n’t know , but they certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a dozen words . “
96504	96513	96515	96515	you	9540	” said Mr. Turveydrop benignly to his son , “
96520	96521	96515	96515	you	9540	” “
96526	96555	96515	96515	you	9540	” The son had no watch . The father had a handsome gold one , which he pulled out with an air that was an example to mankind . “
96559	96563	96515	96515	you	9540	” said he , “
96577	96578	96515	96515	you	9540	” “
96588	96592	96586	96586	father	2776	” said Prince . “

96611	96616	96607	96607	My	0	” returned his father , “
96633	96634	96623	96623	You	9951	” “
96647	96648	96645	96645	father	2776	” “
96657	96674	96654	96654	I	0	” said Mr. Turveydrop , shutting his eyes and lifting up his shoulders with modest consciousness , “
96687	96688	96676	96676	I	0	” “
96697	96702	96703	96705	My dear child	2830	” said his son . “
96731	96732	96718	96718	I	0	” “
96743	96750	96741	96741	father	2776	” said Prince , shaking hands . “
96761	97099	96759	96759	you	2801	” Mr. Turveydrop said this in quite a pious manner , and it seemed to do his son good , who , in parting from him , was so pleased with him , so dutiful to him , and so proud of him that I almost felt as if it were an unkindness to the younger man not to be able to believe implicitly in the elder . The few moments that were occupied by Prince in taking leave of us ( and particularly of one of us , as I saw , being in the secret ) , enhanced my favourable impression of his almost childish character . I felt a liking for him and a compassion for him as he put his little kit in his pocket — and with it his desire to stay a little while with Caddy — and went away good - humouredly to his cold mutton and his school at Kensington , that made me scarcely less irate with his father than the censorious old lady . The father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner , I must acknowledge , worthy of his shining original . In the same style he presently passed us on the other side of the street , on his way to the aristocratic part of the town , where he was going to show himself among the few other gentlemen left . For some moments , I was so lost in reconsidering what I had heard and seen in Newman Street that I was quite unable to talk to Caddy or even to fix my attention on what she said to me , especially when I began to inquire in my mind whether there were , or ever had been , any other gentlemen , not in the dancing profession , who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their deportment . This became so bewildering and suggested the possibility of so many Mr. Turveydrops that I said , “
97118	97205	97206	97206	He	2854	” I accordingly did so , and we chatted all the rest of the way to Lincoln ’s Inn . Caddy told me that her lover ’s education had been so neglected that it was not always easy to read his notes . She said if he were not so anxious about his spelling and took less pains to make it clear , he would do better ; but he put so many unnecessary letters into short words that they sometimes quite lost their English appearance . “
97214	97218	97206	97206	He	2854	” observed Caddy , “
97231	97314	97225	97225	he	2854	” Caddy then went on to reason , how could he be expected to be a scholar when he had passed his whole life in the dancing - school and had done nothing but teach and fag , fag and teach , morning , noon , and night ! And what did it matter ? She could write letters enough for both , as she knew to her cost , and it was far better for him to be amiable than learned . “
97336	97340	97322	97322	I	0	” said Caddy . “
97354	97355	97352	97352	Ma	308	” “
97371	97375	97360	97360	I	0	” continued Caddy , “
97583	97596	97573	97573	I	0	” said Caddy , glancing at the repairs on Peepy ’s frock , “
97684	97703	97704	97704	Caddy	300	” The poor girl , trying so hard , said it from her heart , and touched mine . “
97709	97713	97704	97704	Caddy	300	” I replied , “
97732	97733	97737	97737	you	0	” “
97739	97743	97737	97737	you	0	” cried Caddy . “
97751	97752	97753	97753	My	0	” “
97757	97761	97753	97753	My	0	” said I , “
97790	97976	97977	97977	You	2870	” Caddy was overjoyed . I said everything I could in my old - fashioned way to comfort and encourage her , and I would not have objected to old Mr. Turveydrop that day for any smaller consideration than a settlement on his daughter - in - law . By this time we were come to Mr. Krook ’s , whose private door stood open . There was a bill , pasted on the door - post , announcing a room to let on the second floor . It reminded Caddy to tell me as we proceeded upstairs that there had been a sudden death there and an inquest and that our little friend had been ill of the fright . The door and window of the vacant room being open , we looked in . It was the room with the dark door to which Miss Flite had secretly directed my attention when I was last in the house . A sad and desolate place it was , a gloomy , sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of mournfulness and even dread . “
97981	97989	97977	97977	You	2870	” said Caddy when we came out , “
97993	98065	98066	98066	I	0	” I felt as if the room had chilled me . We had walked slowly while we were talking , and my guardian and Ada were here before us . We found them in Miss Flite ’s garret . They were looking at the birds , while a medical gentleman who was so good as to attend Miss Flite with much solicitude and compassion spoke with her cheerfully by the fire . “
98073	98080	98066	98066	I	0	” he said , coming forward . “
98114	98130	98104	98104	She	376	” Miss Flite received the compliment with complacency and dropped a general curtsy to us . “
98135	98139	98104	98104	She	376	” said she , “
98164	98170	98171	98173	Fitz - Jarndyce	439	” with a special curtsy . “
98176	98192	98171	98173	Fitz - Jarndyce	439	dear”—she had bestowed that name on Caddy , it appeared , and always called her by it—“a
98196	98197	98171	98173	Fitz - Jarndyce	439	” “
98204	98236	98199	98199	she	376	” asked Mr. Jarndyce of the gentleman whom we had found in attendance on her . She answered for herself directly , though he had put the question in a whisper . “
98248	98253	98171	98173	Fitz - Jarndyce	439	” she said confidentially . “
98275	98283	98320	98321	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” in a subdued voice and trembling , “
98323	98328	98320	98321	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” with great stateliness . “
98343	98344	98345	98346	Miss Flite	376	” “
98348	98380	98345	98346	Miss Flite	376	” said Mr. Woodcourt in a grave kind of voice , as if he were appealing to her while speaking to us , and laying his hand gently on her arm , “
98465	98466	98467	98472	The kindest physician in the college	2886	” “
98474	98481	98467	98472	The kindest physician in the college	2886	” whispered Miss Flite to me . “
98499	98500	98501	98501	She	376	” “
98512	98525	98527	98527	she	376	” said Mr. Woodcourt , looking at her with an observant smile , “
98549	98550	98542	98542	you	2888	” “
98554	98562	98542	98542	you	2888	” said Miss Flite , smiling brightly . “
98667	98691	98664	98664	I	0	” said Miss Flite , drawing herself back with a very shrewd look and shaking her right forefinger in a most significant manner , “
98842	98909	98834	98834	I	0	” I congratulated her ( as she addressed herself to me ) upon this fortunate addition to her income and wished her a long continuance of it . I did not speculate upon the source from which it came or wonder whose humanity was so considerate . My guardian stood before me , contemplating the birds , and I had no need to look beyond him . “
98921	98929	98913	98913	you	0	” said he in his pleasant voice . “
98935	98936	98913	98913	you	0	” “
98947	98951	98953	98953	she	376	” said I , “
98965	98971	98962	98962	Ada	290	” Ada remembered very well . “
98975	98980	98973	98973	I	0	” said Miss Flite . “
98999	99029	99030	99030	I	0	” The old man of the house , pushing it open before him , appeared there with his fur cap in his hand and his cat at his heels . “
99037	99041	99034	99035	Miss Flite	376	” he said , “
99059	99060	99054	99054	you	376	” “
99071	99078	99054	99054	you	376	” the old lady angrily exclaimed . “
99091	99113	99114	99114	she	2895	” said Mr. Krook , looking slowly and sharply from one to another until he had looked at all of us ; “
99132	99133	99126	99126	I	0	” “
99140	99150	99151	99151	M	312	” said the old lady with a dignified air . “
99168	99169	99161	99161	Krook	249	” “
99172	99178	99161	99161	Krook	249	” said the old man . “
99186	99187	99183	99184	the Chancellor	821	” “
99190	99195	99183	99184	the Chancellor	821	” returned Miss Flite . “
99200	99201	99183	99184	the Chancellor	821	” “
99206	99215	99203	99204	the Chancellor	292	” said the old man with a chuckle , “
99305	99306	99284	99284	I	0	” “
99312	99326	99284	99284	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce ( which he never did on any consideration ) . “
99335	99336	99338	99338	you	0	” “
99341	99347	99338	99338	you	0	” returned Krook , grinning . “
99394	99428	99382	99382	you	0	” The old man had come by little and little into the room until he now touched my guardian with his elbow and looked close up into his face with his spectacled eyes . “
99458	99465	99453	99453	she	2392	” This was in a whisper . “
99474	99497	99472	99472	Flite	376	” he asked aloud , winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away , affecting to sweep the grate . “
99502	99527	99472	99472	Flite	376	” she answered hurriedly . The old man , looking up at the cages after another look at us , went through the list . “
99585	99591	99625	99625	his	9743	” said the old man , “
99604	99605	99598	99602	my noble and learned brother	9743	” “
99612	99617	99598	99602	my noble and learned brother	9743	” muttered my guardian . “
99636	99645	99625	99625	his	9743	” said Krook , winking at us again . “
99649	99657	99625	99625	his	9743	” he added , whispering and grinning , “
99680	99681	99625	99625	his	9743	” “
99691	99707	99708	99708	I	0	” said my guardian , pretending to look out of the window for a weathercock , “
99717	100090	99708	99708	I	0	” We found it very difficult to get away from the house . It was not Miss Flite who detained us ; she was as reasonable a little creature in consulting the convenience of others as there possibly could be . It was Mr. Krook . He seemed unable to detach himself from Mr. Jarndyce . If he had been linked to him , he could hardly have attended him more closely . He proposed to show us his Court of Chancery and all the strange medley it contained ; during the whole of our inspection ( prolonged by himself ) he kept close to Mr. Jarndyce and sometimes detained him under one pretence or other until we had passed on , as if he were tormented by an inclination to enter upon some secret subject which he could not make up his mind to approach . I can not imagine a countenance and manner more singularly expressive of caution and indecision , and a perpetual impulse to do something he could not resolve to venture on , than Mr. Krook ’s was that day . His watchfulness of my guardian was incessant . He rarely removed his eyes from his face . If he went on beside him , he observed him with the slyness of an old white fox . If he went before , he looked back . When we stood still , he got opposite to him , and drawing his hand across and across his open mouth with a curious expression of a sense of power , and turning up his eyes , and lowering his grey eyebrows until they appeared to be shut , seemed to scan every lineament of his face . At last , having been ( always attended by the cat ) all over the house and having seen the whole stock of miscellaneous lumber , which was certainly curious , we came into the back part of the shop . Here on the head of an empty barrel stood on end were an ink - bottle , some old stumps of pens , and some dirty playbills ; and against the wall were pasted several large printed alphabets in several plain hands . “
100097	100102	100093	100093	you	2919	” asked my guardian . “
100112	100116	100093	100093	you	2919	” said Krook . “
100124	100125	99708	99708	I	0	” “
100130	100137	100093	100093	you	2919	” returned the old man impatiently . “
100147	100148	100157	100158	some one	1114	” “
100160	100165	100157	100158	some one	1114	” said my guardian . “
100175	100189	100190	100190	I	0	” returned the old man with a wonderfully suspicious flash of his eye . “
100218	100219	100205	100205	I	0	” “
100222	100233	100205	100205	I	0	” said my guardian with his good - humoured smile . “
100243	100244	100205	100205	I	0	” “
100256	100274	100250	100254	Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House	286	” replied the old man , turning up his spectacles on his forehead and rubbing his hands . “
100294	100603	100250	100254	Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House	286	” These answers and his manner were strange enough to cause my guardian to inquire of Mr. Woodcourt , as we all walked across Lincoln ’s Inn together , whether Mr. Krook were really , as his lodger represented him , deranged . The young surgeon replied , no , he had seen no reason to think so . He was exceedingly distrustful , as ignorance usually was , and he was always more or less under the influence of raw gin , of which he drank great quantities and of which he and his back - shop , as we might have observed , smelt strongly ; but he did not think him mad as yet . On our way home , I so conciliated Peepy ’s affections by buying him a windmill and two flour - sacks that he would suffer nobody else to take off his hat and gloves and would sit nowhere at dinner but at my side . Caddy sat upon the other side of me , next to Ada , to whom we imparted the whole history of the engagement as soon as we got back . We made much of Caddy , and Peepy too ; and Caddy brightened exceedingly ; and my guardian was as merry as we were ; and we were all very happy indeed until Caddy went home at night in a hackney - coach , with Peepy fast asleep , but holding tight to the windmill . I have forgotten to mention — at least I have not mentioned — that Mr. Woodcourt was the same dark young surgeon whom we had met at Mr. Badger ’s . Or that Mr. Jarndyce invited him to dinner that day . Or that he came . Or that when they were all gone and I said to Ada , “
100618	101523	100616	100616	Richard	291	” Ada laughed and said — But I do n’t think it matters what my darling said . She was always merry . CHAPTER XV Bell Yard While we were in London Mr. Jarndyce was constantly beset by the crowd of excitable ladies and gentlemen whose proceedings had so much astonished us . Mr. Quale , who presented himself soon after our arrival , was in all such excitements . He seemed to project those two shining knobs of temples of his into everything that went on and to brush his hair farther and farther back , until the very roots were almost ready to fly out of his head in inappeasable philanthropy . All objects were alike to him , but he was always particularly ready for anything in the way of a testimonial to any one . His great power seemed to be his power of indiscriminate admiration . He would sit for any length of time , with the utmost enjoyment , bathing his temples in the light of any order of luminary . Having first seen him perfectly swallowed up in admiration of Mrs. Jellyby , I had supposed her to be the absorbing object of his devotion . I soon discovered my mistake and found him to be train - bearer and organ - blower to a whole procession of people . Mrs. Pardiggle came one day for a subscription to something , and with her , Mr. Quale . Whatever Mrs. Pardiggle said , Mr. Quale repeated to us ; and just as he had drawn Mrs. Jellyby out , he drew Mrs. Pardiggle out . Mrs. Pardiggle wrote a letter of introduction to my guardian in behalf of her eloquent friend Mr. Gusher . With Mr. Gusher appeared Mr. Quale again . Mr. Gusher , being a flabby gentleman with a moist surface and eyes so much too small for his moon of a face that they seemed to have been originally made for somebody else , was not at first sight prepossessing ; yet he was scarcely seated before Mr. Quale asked Ada and me , not inaudibly , whether he was not a great creature — which he certainly was , flabbily speaking , though Mr. Quale meant in intellectual beauty — and whether we were not struck by his massive configuration of brow . In short , we heard of a great many missions of various sorts among this set of people , but nothing respecting them was half so clear to us as that it was Mr. Quale ’s mission to be in ecstasies with everybody else ’s mission and that it was the most popular mission of all . Mr. Jarndyce had fallen into this company in the tenderness of his heart and his earnest desire to do all the good in his power ; but that he felt it to be too often an unsatisfactory company , where benevolence took spasmodic forms , where charity was assumed as a regular uniform by loud professors and speculators in cheap notoriety , vehement in profession , restless and vain in action , servile in the last degree of meanness to the great , adulatory of one another , and intolerable to those who were anxious quietly to help the weak from failing rather than with a great deal of bluster and self - laudation to raise them up a little way when they were down , he plainly told us . When a testimonial was originated to Mr. Quale by Mr. Gusher ( who had already got one , originated by Mr. Quale ) , and when Mr. Gusher spoke for an hour and a half on the subject to a meeting , including two charity schools of small boys and girls , who were specially reminded of the widow ’s mite , and requested to come forward with halfpence and be acceptable sacrifices , I think the wind was in the east for three whole weeks . I mention this because I am coming to Mr. Skimpole again . It seemed to me that his off - hand professions of childishness and carelessness were a great relief to my guardian , by contrast with such things , and were the more readily believed in since to find one perfectly undesigning and candid man among many opposites could not fail to give him pleasure . I should be sorry to imply that Mr. Skimpole divined this and was politic ; I really never understood him well enough to know . What he was to my guardian , he certainly was to the rest of the world . He had not been very well ; and thus , though he lived in London , we had seen nothing of him until now . He appeared one morning in his usual agreeable way and as full of pleasant spirits as ever . Well , he said , here he was ! He had been bilious , but rich men were often bilious , and therefore he had been persuading himself that he was a man of property . So he was , in a certain point of view — in his expansive intentions . He had been enriching his medical attendant in the most lavish manner . He had always doubled , and sometimes quadrupled , his fees . He had said to the doctor , “
101565	101676	101547	101547	I	0	” And really ( he said ) he meant it to that degree that he thought it much the same as doing it . If he had had those bits of metal or thin paper to which mankind attached so much importance to put in the doctor ’s hand , he would have put them in the doctor ’s hand . Not having them , he substituted the will for the deed . Very well ! If he really meant it — if his will were genuine and real , which it was — it appeared to him that it was the same as coin , and cancelled the obligation . “
101693	101698	101715	101715	he	2925	” said Mr. Skimpole , “
101801	101802	101796	101796	I	0	” “
101807	101814	101815	101815	he	2925	” said my guardian , laughing , “
101829	101830	101815	101815	he	2925	” “
101835	101839	101840	101840	you	286	” he returned , “
102028	102029	102031	102031	he	2932	” “
102037	102042	102031	102031	he	2932	” inquired my guardian . “
102050	102055	102045	102045	he	2932	” said Mr. Skimpole . “
102097	102098	102079	102079	you	9496	” “
102108	102113	102115	102115	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
102121	102122	102123	102123	Nature	445	” “
102133	102142	102130	102130	I	0	” observed Mr. Skimpole to Ada and me . “
102185	102266	102267	102267	He	2932	” I should have been surprised if those two could have thought very highly of one another , Mr. Boythorn attaching so much importance to many things and Mr. Skimpole caring so little for anything . Besides which , I had noticed Mr. Boythorn more than once on the point of breaking out into some strong opinion when Mr. Skimpole was referred to . Of course I merely joined Ada in saying that we had been greatly pleased with him . “
102272	102277	102267	102267	He	2932	” said Mr. Skimpole ; “
102357	102383	102354	102355	Miss Summerson	280	” He asked me as the subject arose in his mind , in his graceful , light - hearted manner and without the least embarrassment . “
102388	102391	102354	102355	Miss Summerson	280	” said I. “
102401	102406	102407	102407	He	2932	” said Mr. Skimpole . “
102418	102453	102407	102407	He	2932	” It quite shocked me to hear it , for I had already recalled with anything but a serious association the image of the man sitting on the sofa that night wiping his head . “
102462	102467	102454	102455	His successor	2950	” said Mr. Skimpole . “
102538	102557	102559	102559	he	2932	” Mr. Skimpole laughed at the pleasant absurdity and lightly touched the piano by which he was seated . “
102563	102577	102559	102559	he	2932	” he said , playing little chords where I shall put full stops , “
102608	102690	102691	102691	I	0	” Mr. Jarndyce got up , rubbing his head , and began to walk about . Mr. Skimpole played the melody of one of Ada ’s favourite songs . Ada and I both looked at Mr. Jarndyce , thinking that we knew what was passing in his mind . After walking and stopping , and several times leaving off rubbing his head , and beginning again , my guardian put his hand upon the keys and stopped Mr. Skimpole ’s playing . “
102699	102718	102691	102691	I	0	” he said thoughtfully . Mr. Skimpole , who had quite forgotten the subject , looked up surprised . “
102724	102771	102719	102720	The man	1619	” pursued my guardian , walking backward and forward in the very short space between the piano and the end of the room and rubbing his hair up from the back of his head as if a high east wind had blown it into that form . “
102827	102828	102831	102831	Coavinses	324	” “
102833	102845	102831	102831	Coavinses	324	” cried Mr. Skimpole , at length perceiving what he meant . “
102864	102879	102861	102861	you	2964	” Mr. Jarndyce nodded to us , who were only waiting for the signal . “
102900	103002	103005	103005	you	0	” We were quickly ready and went out . Mr. Skimpole went with us and quite enjoyed the expedition . It was so new and so refreshing , he said , for him to want Coavinses instead of Coavinses wanting him ! He took us , first , to Cursitor Street , Chancery Lane , where there was a house with barred windows , which he called Coavinses ’ Castle . On our going into the entry and ringing a bell , a very hideous boy came out of a sort of office and looked at us over a spiked wicket . “
103008	103022	103005	103005	you	0	” said the boy , fitting two of the spikes into his chin . “
103037	103042	103025	103026	a follower	2966	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
103047	103048	103025	103026	a follower	2966	” “
103051	103056	103025	103026	a follower	2966	” said the boy . “
103059	103060	103061	103061	I	0	” “
103072	103073	103061	103061	I	0	” “
103078	103083	103076	103076	Neckett	446	” said the boy . “
103088	103089	103085	103085	his	2968	” “
103093	103098	103099	103099	Chandler	447	” said the boy . “
103111	103112	103114	103114	he	2968	” “
103126	103131	103114	103114	he	2968	” murmured my guardian , “
103134	103135	103114	103114	he	2968	” “
103139	103144	103137	103137	Neckett	446	” said the boy . “
103182	103183	103184	103184	He	2968	” “
103190	103197	103198	103198	He	2968	” I heard my guardian soliloquize . “
103219	103316	103317	103317	Neckett	446	” We left the boy , with his head on one side and his arms on the gate , fondling and sucking the spikes , and went back to Lincoln ’s Inn , where Mr. Skimpole , who had not cared to remain nearer Coavinses , awaited us . Then we all went to Bell Yard , a narrow alley at a very short distance . We soon found the chandler ’s shop . In it was a good - natured - looking old woman with a dropsy , or an asthma , or perhaps both . “
103321	103330	103317	103317	Neckett	446	” said she in reply to my inquiry . “
103350	103460	103337	103338	Three pair	2974	” And she handed me the key across the counter . I glanced at the key and glanced at her , but she took it for granted that I knew what to do with it . As it could only be intended for the children ’s door , I came out without asking any more questions and led the way up the dark stairs . We went as quietly as we could , but four of us made some noise on the aged boards , and when we came to the second story we found we had disturbed a man who was standing there looking out of his room . “
103468	103482	103463	103463	Gridley	247	” he said , fixing his eyes on me with an angry stare . “
103487	103491	103485	103485	sir	9496	” said I ; “
103498	103537	103492	103492	I	0	” He looked at Ada , and at Mr. Jarndyce , and at Mr. Skimpole , fixing the same angry stare on each in succession as they passed and followed me . Mr. Jarndyce gave him good day . “
103541	103667	103668	103668	We	2977	” he said abruptly and fiercely . He was a tall , sallow man with a careworn head on which but little hair remained , a deeply lined face , and prominent eyes . He had a combative look and a chafing , irritable manner which , associated with his figure — still large and powerful , though evidently in its decline — rather alarmed me . He had a pen in his hand , and in the glimpse I caught of his room in passing , I saw that it was covered with a litter of papers . Leaving him standing there , we went up to the top room . I tapped at the door , and a little shrill voice inside said , “
103680	103796	103673	103674	Mrs. Blinder	448	” I applied the key on hearing this and opened the door . In a poor room with a sloping ceiling and containing very little furniture was a mite of a boy , some five or six years old , nursing and hushing a heavy child of eighteen months . There was no fire , though the weather was cold ; both children were wrapped in some poor shawls and tippets as a substitute . Their clothing was not so warm , however , but that their noses looked red and pinched and their small figures shrunken as the boy walked up and down nursing and hushing the child with its head on his shoulder . “
103805	103810	103811	103811	Charley	336	” we naturally asked . “
103813	103825	103811	103811	Charley	336	” said the boy , standing still to gaze at us . “
103831	103832	103827	103827	Charley	336	” “
103847	103848	103845	103845	Charley	336	” “
103858	103859	103860	103860	Me	0	” “
103862	103867	103869	103869	Emma	450	” said the boy , “
103871	103883	103885	103885	Charley	336	” patting the limp bonnet of the child he was nursing . “
103887	103888	103885	103885	Charley	336	” “
103894	103895	103891	103891	Charley	336	” “
103901	104104	103891	103891	Charley	336	” said the boy , beginning to walk up and down again and taking the nankeen bonnet much too near the bedstead by trying to gaze at us at the same time . We were looking at one another and at these two children when there came into the room a very little girl , childish in figure but shrewd and older - looking in the face — pretty - faced too — wearing a womanly sort of bonnet much too large for her and drying her bare arms on a womanly sort of apron . Her fingers were white and wrinkled with washing , and the soap - suds were yet smoking which she wiped off her arms . But for this , she might have been a child playing at washing and imitating a poor working - woman with a quick observation of the truth . She had come running from some place in the neighbourhood and had made all the haste she could . Consequently , though she was very light , she was out of breath and could not speak at first , as she stood panting , and wiping her arms , and looking quietly at us . “
104111	104169	104109	104109	Charley	336	” said the boy . The child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be taken by Charley . The little girl took it , in a womanly sort of manner belonging to the apron and the bonnet , and stood looking at us over the burden that clung to her most affectionately . “
104174	104209	104109	104109	Charley	336	” whispered my guardian as we put a chair for the little creature and got her to sit down with her load , the boy keeping close to her , holding to her apron , “
104231	104279	104280	104280	Charley	336	” It was a thing to look at . The three children close together , and two of them relying solely on the third , and the third so young and yet with an air of age and steadiness that sat so strangely on the childish figure . “
104284	104289	104282	104282	Charley	336	” said my guardian . “
104295	104296	104293	104293	you	336	” “
104302	104307	104300	104300	sir	9496	” replied the child . “
104315	104320	104300	104300	sir	9496	” said my guardian . “
104328	104352	104326	104326	Charley	336	” I can not describe the tenderness with which he spoke to her , half playfully yet all the more compassionately and mournfully . “
104365	104370	104373	104373	sir	9496	” said my guardian . “
104375	104389	104373	104373	sir	9496	” returned the child , looking up into his face with perfect confidence , “
104394	104395	104391	104391	father	2776	” “
104408	104421	104406	104406	Charley	336	” said my guardian , turning his face away for a moment , “
104427	104428	104424	104424	you	336	” “
104450	104451	104442	104442	I	0	” “
104458	104463	104456	104456	Charley	336	” said my guardian . “
104474	104475	104456	104456	Charley	336	” “
104483	104488	104481	104481	sir	9496	” she said quickly . “
104500	104501	104489	104489	I	0	” “
104511	104512	104513	104513	Mother	342	” “
104521	104534	104513	104513	Mother	342	” said the child , glancing at the face upon her bosom . “
104596	104597	104591	104591	you	9496	” “
104605	104606	104600	104600	you	9496	” “
104613	104623	104600	104600	you	9496	” said Charley , opening her eyes and smiling , “
104631	104632	104635	104635	you	9496	” “
104646	104647	104635	104635	you	9496	” “
104660	104664	104665	104666	Mrs. Blinder	448	” said Charley . “
104709	104710	104707	104707	Tom	400	” “
104715	104720	104707	104707	Tom	400	” said Tom stoutly . “
104754	104755	104752	104752	Tom	400	” “
104760	104764	104758	104758	Charley	336	” said Tom , “
104769	104770	104772	104772	he	3002	” “
104779	104795	104772	104772	he	3002	” said the little creature — Oh , in such a motherly , womanly way ! “
104851	104852	104857	104857	Charley	336	” “
104859	104863	104857	104857	Charley	336	” said Tom . “
104868	105097	104865	104865	I	0	” And either in this glimpse of the great pleasure of his life or in gratitude and love for Charley , who was all in all to him , he laid his face among the scanty folds of her frock and passed from laughing into crying . It was the first time since our entry that a tear had been shed among these children . The little orphan girl had spoken of their father and their mother as if all that sorrow were subdued by the necessity of taking courage , and by her childish importance in being able to work , and by her bustling busy way . But now , when Tom cried , although she sat quite tranquil , looking quietly at us , and did not by any movement disturb a hair of the head of either of her little charges , I saw two silent tears fall down her face . I stood at the window with Ada , pretending to look at the housetops , and the blackened stack of chimneys , and the poor plants , and the birds in little cages belonging to the neighbours , when I found that Mrs. Blinder , from the shop below , had come in ( perhaps it had taken her all this time to get upstairs ) and was talking to my guardian . “
105110	105114	105108	105108	sir	9496	” she said ; “
105122	105123	105108	105108	sir	9496	” “
105128	105136	105108	105108	sir	9496	” said my guardian to us two . “
105172	105180	105160	105160	she	3006	” he added after a few moments , “
105187	105188	105182	105182	she	3006	” “
105198	105211	105193	105193	I	0	” said Mrs. Blinder , getting her heavy breath by painful degrees . “
105319	105320	105321	105321	He	9496	” “
105327	105332	105321	105321	He	9496	” said my guardian . “
105337	105342	105343	105343	he	9496	” returned Mrs. Blinder , “
105403	105408	105410	105411	most people	3024	” said Mrs. Blinder , “
105440	105441	105443	105443	you	0	” “
105448	105453	105443	105443	you	0	” said my guardian . “
105460	105465	105455	105455	I	0	” said Mrs. Blinder . “
105503	105516	105493	105493	he	9496	” said Mrs. Blinder , unconsciously fixing Mr. Skimpole with her eye , “
105529	105530	105532	105532	you	0	” “
105538	105539	105532	105532	you	0	” “
105615	105616	105595	105595	he	247	” “
105626	105631	105618	105619	many people	3033	” asked Mr. Jarndyce . “
105642	105647	105618	105619	many people	3033	” said Mrs. Blinder ; “
105825	105892	105893	105893	I	0	” Mrs. Blinder sat down to give herself a more favourable opportunity of recovering her breath , exhausted anew by so much talking before it was fully restored . Mr. Jarndyce was turning to speak to us when his attention was attracted by the abrupt entrance into the room of the Mr. Gridley who had been mentioned and whom we had seen on our way up . “
105908	105919	105921	105921	you	3046	” he said , as if he resented our presence , “
105961	106010	106011	106012	No one	814	” He bent over the group in a caressing way and clearly was regarded as a friend by the children , though his face retained its stern character and his manner to us was as rude as it could be . My guardian noticed it and respected it . “
106024	106029	106011	106012	No one	814	” he said mildly . “
106040	106056	106034	106034	sir	9496	” returned the other , taking Tom upon his knee and waving him off impatiently . “
106081	106082	106068	106068	I	0	” “
106092	106097	106088	106088	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
106104	106105	106088	106088	I	0	” “
106109	106118	106088	106088	I	0	” exclaimed the man , becoming violently angry . “
106135	106136	106140	106140	I	0	” “
106143	106144	106140	106140	I	0	” “
106147	106168	106170	106170	you	0	” said Gridley , putting down the child and going up to him as if he meant to strike him , “
106178	106179	106170	106170	you	0	” “
106188	106189	106170	106170	you	0	” “
106194	106204	106170	106170	you	0	” said the man , pausing in his wrath , “
106228	106233	106226	106226	Sir	9496	” with renewed violence , “
106300	106312	106314	106317	the man from Shropshire	884	” he said , beating one hand on the other passionately , “
106319	106320	106314	106317	the man from Shropshire	884	” “
106342	106348	106349	106349	You	0	” said my guardian composedly . “
106358	106359	106356	106356	Jarndyce	286	” “
106363	106373	106356	106356	Jarndyce	286	” said Gridley with a rough sort of salutation , “
106469	106485	106486	106486	You	0	” he said , speaking in a homely , rustic way and with great vehemence . “
106557	106594	106595	106596	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” The passion and heat in which he was , and the manner in which his face worked , and the violent gestures with which he accompanied what he said , were most painful to see . “
106598	106602	106595	106596	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” he said , “
107022	107052	106992	106992	hundreds	3098	” Mr. Jarndyce said that he condoled with him with all his heart and that he set up no monopoly himself in being unjustly treated by this monstrous system . “
107056	107067	106992	106992	hundreds	3098	” said Mr. Gridley with no diminution of his rage . “
107296	107314	107315	107315	I	0	” His passion was fearful . I could not have believed in such rage without seeing it . “
107319	107330	107315	107315	I	0	” he said , sitting down and wiping his face . “
107604	107612	107613	107613	I	0	” he added , breaking fiercely out , “
107689	107718	107719	107719	I	0	” His countenance had , perhaps for years , become so set in its contentious expression that it did not soften , even now when he was quiet . “
107733	107742	107719	107719	I	0	” he said , going to them again , “
107777	107778	107775	107775	you	9474	” “
107781	107785	107786	107786	You	9474	” said Tom . “
107793	107794	107786	107786	You	9474	” “
107817	107836	107814	107815	little one	3049	” He took the youngest child on his arm , where she was willing enough to be carried . “
107859	108172	108175	108179	the Commander of the Faithful	3131	” He made his former rough salutation , which was not deficient in a certain respect , to Mr. Jarndyce , and bowing slightly to us , went downstairs to his room . Upon that , Mr. Skimpole began to talk , for the first time since our arrival , in his usual gay strain . He said , Well , it was really very pleasant to see how things lazily adapted themselves to purposes . Here was this Mr. Gridley , a man of a robust will and surprising energy — intellectually speaking , a sort of inharmonious blacksmith — and he could easily imagine that there Gridley was , years ago , wandering about in life for something to expend his superfluous combativeness upon — a sort of Young Love among the thorns — when the Court of Chancery came in his way and accommodated him with the exact thing he wanted . There they were , matched , ever afterwards ! Otherwise he might have been a great general , blowing up all sorts of towns , or he might have been a great politician , dealing in all sorts of parliamentary rhetoric ; but as it was , he and the Court of Chancery had fallen upon each other in the pleasantest way , and nobody was much the worse , and Gridley was , so to speak , from that hour provided for . Then look at Coavinses ! How delightfully poor Coavinses ( father of these charming children ) illustrated the same principle ! He , Mr. Skimpole , himself , had sometimes repined at the existence of Coavinses . He had found Coavinses in his way . He could had dispensed with Coavinses . There had been times when , if he had been a sultan , and his grand vizier had said one morning , “
108188	108200	108175	108179	the Commander of the Faithful	3131	” he might have even gone so far as to reply , “
108206	108291	108292	108292	I	0	” But what turned out to be the case ? That , all that time , he had been giving employment to a most deserving man , that he had been a benefactor to Coavinses , that he had actually been enabling Coavinses to bring up these charming children in this agreeable way , developing these social virtues ! Insomuch that his heart had just now swelled and the tears had come into his eyes when he had looked round the room and thought , “
108308	108734	108735	108735	My	0	” There was something so captivating in his light way of touching these fantastic strings , and he was such a mirthful child by the side of the graver childhood we had seen , that he made my guardian smile even as he turned towards us from a little private talk with Mrs. Blinder . We kissed Charley , and took her downstairs with us , and stopped outside the house to see her run away to her work . I do n’t know where she was going , but we saw her run , such a little , little creature in her womanly bonnet and apron , through a covered way at the bottom of the court and melt into the city ’s strife and sound like a dewdrop in an ocean . CHAPTER XVI Tom - all - Alone ’s My Lady Dedlock is restless , very restless . The astonished fashionable intelligence hardly knows where to have her . To - day she is at Chesney Wold ; yesterday she was at her house in town ; to - morrow she may be abroad , for anything the fashionable intelligence can with confidence predict . Even Sir Leicester ’s gallantry has some trouble to keep pace with her . It would have more but that his other faithful ally , for better and for worse — the gout — darts into the old oak bed - chamber at Chesney Wold and grips him by both legs . Sir Leicester receives the gout as a troublesome demon , but still a demon of the patrician order . All the Dedlocks , in the direct male line , through a course of time during and beyond which the memory of man goeth not to the contrary , have had the gout . It can be proved , sir . Other men ’s fathers may have died of the rheumatism or may have taken base contagion from the tainted blood of the sick vulgar , but the Dedlock family have communicated something exclusive even to the levelling process of dying by dying of their own family gout . It has come down through the illustrious line like the plate , or the pictures , or the place in Lincolnshire . It is among their dignities . Sir Leicester is perhaps not wholly without an impression , though he has never resolved it into words , that the angel of death in the discharge of his necessary duties may observe to the shades of the aristocracy , “
108759	108815	108816	108816	We	3138	” Hence Sir Leicester yields up his family legs to the family disorder as if he held his name and fortune on that feudal tenure . He feels that for a Dedlock to be laid upon his back and spasmodically twitched and stabbed in his extremities is a liberty taken somewhere , but he thinks , “
108862	108986	108987	108989	Each of us	3140	” And a goodly show he makes , lying in a flush of crimson and gold in the midst of the great drawing - room before his favourite picture of my Lady , with broad strips of sunlight shining in , down the long perspective , through the long line of windows , and alternating with soft reliefs of shadow . Outside , the stately oaks , rooted for ages in the green ground which has never known ploughshare , but was still a chase when kings rode to battle with sword and shield and rode a - hunting with bow and arrow , bear witness to his greatness . Inside , his forefathers , looking on him from the walls , say , “
109021	109321	109703	109703	Tom	453	” and hear their testimony to his greatness too . And he is very great this day . And woe to Boythorn or other daring wight who shall presumptuously contest an inch with him ! My Lady is at present represented , near Sir Leicester , by her portrait . She has flitted away to town , with no intention of remaining there , and will soon flit hither again , to the confusion of the fashionable intelligence . The house in town is not prepared for her reception . It is muffled and dreary . Only one Mercury in powder gapes disconsolate at the hall - window ; and he mentioned last night to another Mercury of his acquaintance , also accustomed to good society , that if that sort of thing was to last — which it could n’t , for a man of his spirits could n’t bear it , and a man of his figure could n’t be expected to bear it — there would be no resource for him , upon his honour , but to cut his throat ! What connexion can there be between the place in Lincolnshire , the house in town , the Mercury in powder , and the whereabout of Jo the outlaw with the broom , who had that distant ray of light upon him when he swept the churchyard - step ? What connexion can there have been between many people in the innumerable histories of this world who from opposite sides of great gulfs have , nevertheless , been very curiously brought together ! Jo sweeps his crossing all day long , unconscious of the link , if any link there be . He sums up his mental condition when asked a question by replying that he “
109327	109702	109703	109703	Tom	453	” He knows that it ’s hard to keep the mud off the crossing in dirty weather , and harder still to live by doing it . Nobody taught him even that much ; he found it out . Jo lives — that is to say , Jo has not yet died — in a ruinous place known to the like of him by the name of Tom - all - Alone ’s . It is a black , dilapidated street , avoided by all decent people , where the crazy houses were seized upon , when their decay was far advanced , by some bold vagrants who after establishing their own possession took to letting them out in lodgings . Now , these tumbling tenements contain , by night , a swarm of misery . As on the ruined human wretch vermin parasites appear , so these ruined shelters have bred a crowd of foul existence that crawls in and out of gaps in walls and boards ; and coils itself to sleep , in maggot numbers , where the rain drips in ; and comes and goes , fetching and carrying fever and sowing more evil in its every footprint than Lord Coodle , and Sir Thomas Doodle , and the Duke of Foodle , and all the fine gentlemen in office , down to Zoodle , shall set right in five hundred years — though born expressly to do it . Twice lately there has been a crash and a cloud of dust , like the springing of a mine , in Tom - all - Alone ’s ; and each time a house has fallen . These accidents have made a paragraph in the newspapers and have filled a bed or two in the nearest hospital . The gaps remain , and there are not unpopular lodgings among the rubbish . As several more houses are nearly ready to go , the next crash in Tom - all - Alone ’s may be expected to be a good one . This desirable property is in Chancery , of course . It would be an insult to the discernment of any man with half an eye to tell him so . Whether “
109704	109781	109703	109703	Tom	453	” is the popular representative of the original plaintiff or defendant in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , or whether Tom lived here when the suit had laid the street waste , all alone , until other settlers came to join him , or whether the traditional title is a comprehensive name for a retreat cut off from honest company and put out of the pale of hope , perhaps nobody knows . Certainly Jo do n’t know . “
109787	109791	109783	109783	I	0	” says Jo , “
109798	111178	109792	109792	I	0	” It must be a strange state to be like Jo ! To shuffle through the streets , unfamiliar with the shapes , and in utter darkness as to the meaning , of those mysterious symbols , so abundant over the shops , and at the corners of streets , and on the doors , and in the windows ! To see people read , and to see people write , and to see the postmen deliver letters , and not to have the least idea of all that language — to be , to every scrap of it , stone blind and dumb ! It must be very puzzling to see the good company going to the churches on Sundays , with their books in their hands , and to think ( for perhaps Jo DOES think at odd times ) what does it all mean , and if it means anything to anybody , how comes it that it means nothing to me ? To be hustled , and jostled , and moved on ; and really to feel that it would appear to be perfectly true that I have no business here , or there , or anywhere ; and yet to be perplexed by the consideration that I AM here somehow , too , and everybody overlooked me until I became the creature that I am ! It must be a strange state , not merely to be told that I am scarcely human ( as in the case of my offering myself for a witness ) , but to feel it of my own knowledge all my life ! To see the horses , dogs , and cattle go by me and to know that in ignorance I belong to them and not to the superior beings in my shape , whose delicacy I offend ! Jo ’s ideas of a criminal trial , or a judge , or a bishop , or a government , or that inestimable jewel to him ( if he only knew it ) the Constitution , should be strange ! His whole material and immaterial life is wonderfully strange ; his death , the strangest thing of all . Jo comes out of Tom - all - Alone ’s , meeting the tardy morning which is always late in getting down there , and munches his dirty bit of bread as he comes along . His way lying through many streets , and the houses not yet being open , he sits down to breakfast on the door - step of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and gives it a brush when he has finished as an acknowledgment of the accommodation . He admires the size of the edifice and wonders what it ’s all about . He has no idea , poor wretch , of the spiritual destitution of a coral reef in the Pacific or what it costs to look up the precious souls among the coco - nuts and bread - fruit . He goes to his crossing and begins to lay it out for the day . The town awakes ; the great tee - totum is set up for its daily spin and whirl ; all that unaccountable reading and writing , which has been suspended for a few hours , recommences . Jo and the other lower animals get on in the unintelligible mess as they can . It is market - day . The blinded oxen , over - goaded , over - driven , never guided , run into wrong places and are beaten out , and plunge red - eyed and foaming at stone walls , and often sorely hurt the innocent , and often sorely hurt themselves . Very like Jo and his order ; very , very like ! A band of music comes and plays . Jo listens to it . So does a dog — a drover ’s dog , waiting for his master outside a butcher ’s shop , and evidently thinking about those sheep he has had upon his mind for some hours and is happily rid of . He seems perplexed respecting three or four , ca n’t remember where he left them , looks up and down the street as half expecting to see them astray , suddenly pricks up his ears and remembers all about it . A thoroughly vagabond dog , accustomed to low company and public - houses ; a terrific dog to sheep , ready at a whistle to scamper over their backs and tear out mouthfuls of their wool ; but an educated , improved , developed dog who has been taught his duties and knows how to discharge them . He and Jo listen to the music , probably with much the same amount of animal satisfaction ; likewise as to awakened association , aspiration , or regret , melancholy or joyful reference to things beyond the senses , they are probably upon a par . But , otherwise , how far above the human listener is the brute ! Turn that dog ’s descendants wild , like Jo , and in a very few years they will so degenerate that they will lose even their bark — but not their bite . The day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and drizzly . Jo fights it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels , the horses , whips , and umbrellas , and gets but a scanty sum to pay for the unsavoury shelter of Tom - all - Alone ’s . Twilight comes on ; gas begins to start up in the shops ; the lamplighter , with his ladder , runs along the margin of the pavement . A wretched evening is beginning to close in . In his chambers Mr. Tulkinghorn sits meditating an application to the nearest magistrate to - morrow morning for a warrant . Gridley , a disappointed suitor , has been here to - day and has been alarming . We are not to be put in bodily fear , and that ill - conditioned fellow shall be held to bail again . From the ceiling , foreshortened Allegory , in the person of one impossible Roman upside down , points with the arm of Samson ( out of joint , and an odd one ) obtrusively toward the window . Why should Mr. Tulkinghorn , for such no reason , look out of window ? Is the hand not always pointing there ? So he does not look out of window . And if he did , what would it be to see a woman going by ? There are women enough in the world , Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks — too many ; they are at the bottom of all that goes wrong in it , though , for the matter of that , they create business for lawyers . What would it be to see a woman going by , even though she were going secretly ? They are all secret . Mr. Tulkinghorn knows that very well . But they are not all like the woman who now leaves him and his house behind , between whose plain dress and her refined manner there is something exceedingly inconsistent . She should be an upper servant by her attire , yet in her air and step , though both are hurried and assumed — as far as she can assume in the muddy streets , which she treads with an unaccustomed foot — she is a lady . Her face is veiled , and still she sufficiently betrays herself to make more than one of those who pass her look round sharply . She never turns her head . Lady or servant , she has a purpose in her and can follow it . She never turns her head until she comes to the crossing where Jo plies with his broom . He crosses with her and begs . Still , she does not turn her head until she has landed on the other side . Then she slightly beckons to him and says , “
111182	111195	109792	109792	I	0	” Jo follows her a pace or two into a quiet court . “
111208	111215	111216	111216	I	0	” she asked behind her veil . “
111221	111231	109792	109792	I	0	” says Jo , staring moodily at the veil , “
111247	111248	111237	111237	I	0	” “
111256	111257	111258	111258	I	0	” “
111278	111282	111271	111272	the beadle	10677	” says Jo . “
111293	111294	111291	111291	Jo	389	” “
111297	111298	111291	111291	Jo	389	” “
111303	111307	111301	111301	me	0	” says Jo . “
111312	111313	111314	111314	You	3142	” “
111320	111326	111314	111314	You	3142	” says Jo , following . “
111332	111333	111314	111314	You	3142	” “
111358	111359	111344	111344	he	1619	” “
111364	111368	111344	111344	he	1619	” says Jo . “
111378	111385	111370	111370	he	1619	” says the woman with abhorrence . “
111394	111398	111370	111370	he	1619	” says Jo . “
111416	111417	111414	111414	you	3142	” “
111428	111429	111420	111420	you	3142	” “
111436	111457	111420	111420	you	3142	” says Jo with much humility , for even he has got at the suspicion of her being a lady . “
111469	111470	111466	111467	a servant	11112	” “
111477	111496	111473	111475	a jolly servant	3151	” says Jo without the least idea of saying anything offensive , merely as a tribute of admiration . “
111569	111586	111560	111560	you	3142	” Jo answers with a nod , having also nodded as each other place was mentioned . “
111632	111673	111674	111674	I	0	” Jo attends closely while the words are being spoken ; tells them off on his broom - handle , finding them rather hard ; pauses to consider their meaning ; considers it satisfactory ; and nods his ragged head . “
111678	111682	111674	111674	I	0	” says Jo . “
111694	111695	111690	111690	Stow	455	” “
111703	111712	111713	111713	Stow	455	” exclaims the servant , recoiling from him . “
111720	111724	111713	111713	Stow	455	” says Jo . “
111749	111805	111735	111735	I	0	” Jo screws up his mouth into a whistle , gives his ragged head a rub , takes his broom under his arm , and leads the way , passing deftly with his bare feet over the hard stones and through the mud and mire . Cook ’s Court . Jo stops . A pause . “
111810	111811	111812	111812	Him	3158	” “
111825	111837	111812	111812	Him	3158	” says Jo in a whisper without looking over his shoulder . “
111844	111857	111812	111812	Him	3158	” Krook ’s house . Jo stops again . A longer pause . “
111862	111863	111864	111864	HE	3158	” “
111868	111881	111864	111864	HE	3158	” Jo answers as before . After a silence he is asked , “
111886	111887	111864	111864	HE	3158	” “
111928	111929	111923	111923	I	0	” “
111936	112007	112008	112008	He	3164	” It is a longer walk to the next , but Jo , relieved of his first suspicions , sticks to the forms imposed upon him and does not look round . By many devious ways , reeking with offence of many kinds , they come to the little tunnel of a court , and to the gas - lamp ( lighted now ) , and to the iron gate . “
112013	112025	112008	112008	He	3164	” says Jo , holding to the bars and looking in . “
112036	112037	112008	112008	He	3164	” “
112040	112046	112008	112008	He	3164	” says Jo , pointing . “
112109	112115	112106	112106	I	0	” giving it a shake . “
112126	112132	112106	112106	I	0	” cries Jo , excited . “
112147	112212	112106	112106	I	0	” The servant shrinks into a corner , into a corner of that hideous archway , with its deadly stains contaminating her dress ; and putting out her two hands and passionately telling him to keep away from her , for he is loathsome to her , so remains for some moments . Jo stands staring and is still staring when she recovers herself . “
112221	112222	112223	112223	I	0	” “
112232	112239	112223	112223	I	0	” says Jo , still staring . “
112244	112245	112223	112223	I	0	” “
112248	112258	112223	112223	I	0	” says Jo , in the last degree amazed . “
112263	112264	112265	112265	I	0	” “
112272	112281	112265	112265	I	0	” says Jo , staring more than ever ; “
112292	112302	112290	112290	Blest	457	” repeats Jo , something troubled in his mind . “
112330	112410	112290	112290	Blest	457	” The servant takes as little heed of what he says as she seems to take of what she has said herself . She draws off her glove to get some money from her purse . Jo silently notices how white and small her hand is and what a jolly servant she must be to wear such sparkling rings . She drops a piece of money in his hand without touching it , and shuddering as their hands approach . “
112413	112417	112315	112315	I	0	” she adds , “
112424	112669	112315	112315	I	0	” Jo thrusts the handle of his broom between the bars of the gate , and with his utmost power of elaboration , points it out . At length , looking aside to see if he has made himself intelligible , he finds that he is alone . His first proceeding is to hold the piece of money to the gas - light and to be overpowered at finding that it is yellow — gold . His next is to give it a one - sided bite at the edge as a test of its quality . His next , to put it in his mouth for safety and to sweep the step and passage with great care . His job done , he sets off for Tom - all - Alone ’s , stopping in the light of innumerable gas - lamps to produce the piece of gold and give it another one - sided bite as a reassurance of its being genuine . The Mercury in powder is in no want of society to - night , for my Lady goes to a grand dinner and three or four balls . Sir Leicester is fidgety down at Chesney Wold , with no better company than the gout ; he complains to Mrs. Rouncewell that the rain makes such a monotonous pattering on the terrace that he ca n’t read the paper even by the fireside in his own snug dressing - room . “
112688	112695	112670	112671	Sir Leicester	266	” says Mrs. Rouncewell to Rosa . “
112731	113086	113089	113090	Mr. Carstone	291	” CHAPTER XVII Esther ’s Narrative Richard very often came to see us while we remained in London ( though he soon failed in his letter - writing ) , and with his quick abilities , his good spirits , his good temper , his gaiety and freshness , was always delightful . But though I liked him more and more the better I knew him , I still felt more and more how much it was to be regretted that he had been educated in no habits of application and concentration . The system which had addressed him in exactly the same manner as it had addressed hundreds of other boys , all varying in character and capacity , had enabled him to dash through his tasks , always with fair credit and often with distinction , but in a fitful , dazzling way that had confirmed his reliance on those very qualities in himself which it had been most desirable to direct and train . They were good qualities , without which no high place can be meritoriously won , but like fire and water , though excellent servants , they were very bad masters . If they had been under Richard ’s direction , they would have been his friends ; but Richard being under their direction , they became his enemies . I write down these opinions not because I believe that this or any other thing was so because I thought so , but only because I did think so and I want to be quite candid about all I thought and did . These were my thoughts about Richard . I thought I often observed besides how right my guardian was in what he had said , and that the uncertainties and delays of the Chancery suit had imparted to his nature something of the careless spirit of a gamester who felt that he was part of a great gaming system . Mr. and Mrs. Bayham Badger coming one afternoon when my guardian was not at home , in the course of conversation I naturally inquired after Richard . “
113092	113097	113089	113090	Mr. Carstone	291	” said Mrs. Badger , “
113206	113224	113193	113193	I	0	” I said no , as Mrs. Badger ’s insinuating tone seemed to require such an answer . “
113229	113246	113226	113227	Miss Clare	290	” said Mrs. Bayham Badger sweetly . Ada said no , too , and looked uneasy . “
113255	113260	113262	113262	you	291	” said Mrs. Badger , “
113271	113281	113262	113262	you	291	” We entreated Mrs. Badger not to mention it . “
113297	113302	113288	113288	I	0	” pursued Mrs. Badger , “
113332	113333	113321	113323	Mr. Bayham Badger	423	” “
113336	113350	113321	113323	Mr. Bayham Badger	423	” Mr. Badger called out like some one contradicting at a public meeting . “
113355	113356	113321	113323	Mr. Bayham Badger	423	” “
113360	113365	113366	113366	we	3187	” smiled Mrs. Badger , “
113372	113373	113366	113366	we	3187	” “
113376	113381	113366	113366	we	3187	” said Mr. Badger . “
113502	113503	113499	113500	Professor Dingo	426	” “
113510	113515	113499	113500	Professor Dingo	426	” murmured Mr. Badger . “
113531	113550	113551	113551	I	0	” said Mrs. Badger , speaking of her former husbands as if they were parts of a charade , “
113641	113642	113647	113648	Miss Summerson	280	” “
113650	113656	113647	113648	Miss Summerson	280	” said Mr. Badger reverentially . “
113675	113676	113647	113648	Miss Summerson	280	” “
113680	113685	113647	113648	Miss Summerson	280	” pursued Mrs. Badger , “
113767	113786	113787	113787	My	0	” Ada looked so very anxious now that I asked Mrs. Badger on what she founded her supposition . “
113792	113796	113787	113787	My	0	” she replied , “
113942	113943	113939	113940	Mr. Carstone	291	” “
113951	113956	113945	113946	Mr. Badger	423	” asked Ada timidly . “
113959	113964	113945	113946	Mr. Badger	423	” said Mr. Badger , “
114072	114073	114067	114068	Mrs. Badger	424	” “
114083	114088	114091	114091	his	425	” said Mrs. Badger , “
114154	114155	114150	114152	the nautical profession	3217	” “
114160	114165	114150	114152	the nautical profession	3217	” observed Mr. Badger . “
114177	114178	114179	114179	People	858	” “
114197	114202	114179	114179	People	858	” said Mrs. Badger , “
114251	114252	114248	114248	I	0	” “
114257	114262	114248	114248	I	0	” said Mr. Badger . “
114310	114430	114287	114287	he	11230	” Although we could have dispensed with the length at which Mr. and Mrs. Badger pursued the conversation , we both felt that it was disinterested in them to express the opinion they had communicated to us and that there was a great probability of its being sound . We agreed to say nothing to Mr. Jarndyce until we had spoken to Richard ; and as he was coming next evening , we resolved to have a very serious talk with him . So after he had been a little while with Ada , I went in and found my darling ( as I knew she would be ) prepared to consider him thoroughly right in whatever he said . “
114440	114462	114434	114434	you	3229	” said I. I always sat down on the other side of him . He made quite a sister of me . “
114468	114472	114473	114473	He	3229	” said Richard . “
114486	114511	114484	114484	he	3229	” cried my pet triumphantly . I tried to look at my pet in the wisest manner , but of course I could n’t . “
114515	114519	114484	114484	he	3229	” I repeated . “
114522	114526	114484	114484	he	3229	” said Richard , “
114549	114550	114484	114484	he	3229	” “
114557	114561	114555	114555	Richard	291	” I remonstrated . “
114567	114571	114555	114555	Richard	291	” said Richard . “
114579	114580	114581	114581	I	0	” “
114595	114607	114592	114593	Dame Durden	343	” said Ada , looking so confidingly at me across him ; “
114628	114629	114625	114625	I	0	” “
114638	114650	114634	114634	I	0	” returned Richard , carelessly tossing his hair from his forehead . “
114699	114740	114744	114744	Richard	291	” Ada would have done so willingly , and with a full persuasion that we had brought the question to a most satisfactory state . But I thought it would be useless to stop there , so I began again . “
114746	114750	114744	114744	Richard	291	” said I , “
114812	114813	114818	114818	We	3232	” “
114824	114828	114818	114818	We	3232	” said Ada . “
114836	114863	114832	114832	Richard	291	” What was the use of my trying to look wise when she was so pretty , and so engaging , and so fond of him ! “
114874	114878	114880	114880	they	3236	” said I , “
114895	114896	114898	114898	they	3236	” “
114901	114905	114898	114898	they	3236	” said Richard . “
114968	114969	114972	114972	him	3237	” “
114976	114979	114972	114972	him	3237	” said I. “
114984	114994	114972	114972	him	3237	” Richard proceeded , half thoughtfully and half jocosely , “
115024	115025	115011	115011	I	0	” “
115034	115041	115011	115011	I	0	” cried Ada , quite delighted . “
115052	115053	115050	115050	Esther	280	” “
115056	115060	115050	115050	Esther	280	” pursued Richard , “
115085	115086	115050	115050	Esther	280	” “
115092	115096	115088	115088	I	0	” said I , “
115118	115119	115121	115121	you	0	” “
115125	115132	115121	115121	you	0	” returned Richard , still considering . “
115144	115153	115141	115141	you	0	” he added , suddenly becoming gay again , “
115190	115314	115315	115315	My	0	” But even Ada , with her loving face — and if it had seemed innocent and trusting when I first saw it in that memorable November fog , how much more did it seem now when I knew her innocent and trusting heart — even Ada shook her head at this and looked serious . So I thought it a good opportunity to hint to Richard that if he were sometimes a little careless of himself , I was very sure he never meant to be careless of Ada , and that it was a part of his affectionate consideration for her not to slight the importance of a step that might influence both their lives . This made him almost grave . “
115320	115324	115315	115315	My	0	” he said , “
115431	115440	115470	115470	I	0	” said Richard with an air of vexation . “
115445	115449	115470	115470	I	0	” I suggested , “
115460	115461	115462	115463	Poor fellow	2855	” “
115465	115469	115462	115463	Poor fellow	2855	” said Ada . “
115480	115544	115473	115473	I	0	” No . It was not of the least use my trying to look wise . I tried again , but how could I do it , or how could it have any effect if I could , while Ada rested her clasped hands upon his shoulder and while he looked at her tender blue eyes , and while they looked at him ! “
115552	115566	115545	115545	You	3243	” said Richard , passing her golden curls through and through his hand , “
115629	115630	115631	115631	My	0	” “
115635	115639	115631	115631	My	0	” said I , “
115648	115649	115642	115642	you	291	” “
115657	115661	115650	115650	I	0	” he returned . “
115677	115724	115729	115730	Mrs. Shipton	341	” Both Ada and I urged , in reply , not only that it was decidedly worth - while to undo what had been done , but that it must be undone . I then asked Richard whether he had thought of any more congenial pursuit . “
115732	115736	115737	115737	you	341	” said Richard , “
115760	115761	115755	115756	the boy	9980	” “
115765	115777	115755	115756	the boy	9980	” repeated Ada as if she were afraid of the name . “
115786	115790	115779	115779	I	0	” said Richard , “
115878	115948	115949	115949	My	0	” I was not by any means so sure of that , and I saw how his hankering after the vague things yet to come of those long - deferred hopes cast a shade on Ada ’s face . But I thought it best to encourage him in any project of continuous exertion , and only advised him to be quite sure that his mind was made up now . “
115953	115957	115949	115949	My	0	” said Richard , “
116005	116013	116002	116002	you	460	” said Richard , relapsing into doubt , “
116034	116115	116116	116116	Rick	317	” This led to our saying again , with a great deal of gravity , all that we had said already and to our coming to much the same conclusion afterwards . But we so strongly advised Richard to be frank and open with Mr. Jarndyce , without a moment ’s delay , and his disposition was naturally so opposed to concealment that he sought him out at once ( taking us with him ) and made a full avowal . “
116118	116128	116116	116116	Rick	317	” said my guardian , after hearing him attentively , “
116201	116334	116335	116336	Cousin John	318	” Richard ’s energy was of such an impatient and fitful kind that he would have liked nothing better than to have gone to Mr. Kenge ’s office in that hour and to have entered into articles with him on the spot . Submitting , however , with a good grace to the caution that we had shown to be so necessary , he contented himself with sitting down among us in his lightest spirits and talking as if his one unvarying purpose in life from childhood had been that one which now held possession of him . My guardian was very kind and cordial with him , but rather grave , enough so to cause Ada , when he had departed and we were going upstairs to bed , to say , “
116349	116350	116340	116340	you	318	” “
116356	116360	116340	116340	you	318	” said he . “
116382	116383	116388	116389	my love	9612	” “
116391	116395	116388	116389	my love	9612	” said he . “
116401	116402	116388	116389	my love	9612	” “
116413	116438	116410	116411	cousin John	318	” said Ada , smiling cheerfully , with her hand upon his shoulder , where she had put it in bidding him good night . “
116456	116457	116447	116447	you	318	” “
116461	116466	116447	116447	you	318	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
116552	116553	116549	116549	I	0	” “
116561	116565	116558	116559	cousin John	318	” said Ada , “
116609	116642	116643	116643	I	0	” So quietly and honestly she said it , with her hands upon his shoulders — both hands now — and looking up into his face , like the picture of truth ! “
116646	116655	116643	116643	I	0	” said my guardian , thoughtfully regarding her , “
116704	116977	116978	116978	Esther	280	” This was the first time I ever saw him follow Ada with his eyes with something of a shadow on their benevolent expression . I well remembered the look with which he had contemplated her and Richard when she was singing in the firelight ; it was but a very little while since he had watched them passing down the room in which the sun was shining , and away into the shade ; but his glance was changed , and even the silent look of confidence in me which now followed it once more was not quite so hopeful and untroubled as it had originally been . Ada praised Richard more to me that night than ever she had praised him yet . She went to sleep with a little bracelet he had given her clasped upon her arm . I fancied she was dreaming of him when I kissed her cheek after she had slept an hour and saw how tranquil and happy she looked . For I was so little inclined to sleep myself that night that I sat up working . It would not be worth mentioning for its own sake , but I was wakeful and rather low - spirited . I do n’t know why . At least I do n’t think I know why . At least , perhaps I do , but I do n’t think it matters . At any rate , I made up my mind to be so dreadfully industrious that I would leave myself not a moment ’s leisure to be low - spirited . For I naturally said , “
116989	117016	116987	116987	YOU	280	” And it really was time to say so , for I — yes , I really did see myself in the glass , almost crying . “
117039	117294	117295	117295	Esther	280	” said I. If I could have made myself go to sleep , I would have done it directly , but not being able to do that , I took out of my basket some ornamental work for our house ( I mean Bleak House ) that I was busy with at that time and sat down to it with great determination . It was necessary to count all the stitches in that work , and I resolved to go on with it until I could n’t keep my eyes open , and then to go to bed . I soon found myself very busy . But I had left some silk downstairs in a work - table drawer in the temporary growlery , and coming to a stop for want of it , I took my candle and went softly down to get it . To my great surprise , on going in I found my guardian still there , and sitting looking at the ashes . He was lost in thought , his book lay unheeded by his side , his silvered iron - grey hair was scattered confusedly upon his forehead as though his hand had been wandering among it while his thoughts were elsewhere , and his face looked worn . Almost frightened by coming upon him so unexpectedly , I stood still for a moment and should have retired without speaking had he not , in again passing his hand abstractedly through his hair , seen me and started . “
117297	117307	117295	117295	Esther	280	” I told him what I had come for . “
117316	117317	117295	117295	Esther	280	” “
117326	117330	117295	117295	Esther	280	” said I , “
117369	117370	117361	117361	I	0	” “
117382	117411	117377	117377	YOU	2039	” said he . He spoke in a regretful tone so new to me that I inwardly repeated , as if that would help me to his meaning , “
117418	117419	117424	117424	Esther	280	” “
117426	117430	117431	117431	You	2039	” said he , “
117437	117438	117431	117431	You	2039	” “
117449	117491	117447	117447	guardian	10146	” He slightly waved his hand and fell into his usual manner . The change was so remarkable , and he appeared to make it by dint of so much self - command , that I found myself again inwardly repeating , “
117498	117499	117500	117501	Little woman	2039	” “
117503	117508	117500	117501	Little woman	2039	” said my guardian , “
117549	117550	117551	117552	Dear guardian	3270	” “
117554	117558	117551	117552	Dear guardian	3270	” I replied , “
117569	117570	117560	117560	you	3270	” “
117575	117587	117588	117588	I	0	” he gravely interposed , anticipating what I meant to say , “
117627	117628	117634	117634	guardian	10146	” “
117640	117641	117630	117630	you	280	” “
117646	117659	117642	117642	I	0	” he returned very gently , and kindly , and very distinctly . “
117714	117734	117741	117741	guardian	10146	” I sat down and said after a little effort to be as calm as I ought to be , “
117794	117878	117761	117761	hers	9534	” I had covered my face with my hands in repeating the words , but I took them away now with a better kind of shame , I hope , and told him that to him I owed the blessing that I had from my childhood to that hour never , never , never felt it . He put up his hand as if to stop me . I well knew that he was never to be thanked , and said no more . “
117885	117895	117761	117761	hers	9534	” he said after thinking for a little while , “
118068	118079	118048	118048	It	3294	” I listened in silence and looked attentively at him . “
118152	118161	118133	118133	I	0	” I took his hand and kissed it . “
118286	118298	118280	118280	I	0	” I held his hand for a little while in mine . “
118309	118319	118299	118299	I	0	” he added , cheerily making light of it , “
118352	118353	118333	118333	She	1180	” “
118358	118362	118363	118363	she	1180	” said I , “
118374	118437	118363	118363	she	1180	” At the word father , I saw his former trouble come into his face . He subdued it as before , and it was gone in an instant ; but it had been there and it had come so swiftly upon my words that I felt as if they had given him a shock . I again inwardly repeated , wondering , “
118451	118472	118363	118363	she	1180	” No , it was true . I did not understand it . Not for many and many a day . “
118482	118492	118363	118363	she	1180	” said he , kissing me on the forehead , “
118522	119307	118507	118507	You	9540	” I neither worked nor thought any more that night . I opened my grateful heart to heaven in thankfulness for its providence to me and its care of me , and fell asleep . We had a visitor next day . Mr. Allan Woodcourt came . He came to take leave of us ; he had settled to do so beforehand . He was going to China and to India as a surgeon on board ship . He was to be away a long , long time . I believe — at least I know — that he was not rich . All his widowed mother could spare had been spent in qualifying him for his profession . It was not lucrative to a young practitioner , with very little influence in London ; and although he was , night and day , at the service of numbers of poor people and did wonders of gentleness and skill for them , he gained very little by it in money . He was seven years older than I. Not that I need mention it , for it hardly seems to belong to anything . I think — I mean , he told us — that he had been in practice three or four years and that if he could have hoped to contend through three or four more , he would not have made the voyage on which he was bound . But he had no fortune or private means , and so he was going away . He had been to see us several times altogether . We thought it a pity he should go away . Because he was distinguished in his art among those who knew it best , and some of the greatest men belonging to it had a high opinion of him . When he came to bid us good - bye , he brought his mother with him for the first time . She was a pretty old lady , with bright black eyes , but she seemed proud . She came from Wales and had had , a long time ago , an eminent person for an ancestor , of the name of Morgan ap - Kerrig — of some place that sounded like Gimlet — who was the most illustrious person that ever was known and all of whose relations were a sort of royal family . He appeared to have passed his life in always getting up into mountains and fighting somebody ; and a bard whose name sounded like Crumlinwallinwer had sung his praises in a piece which was called , as nearly as I could catch it , Mewlinnwillinwodd . Mrs. Woodcourt , after expatiating to us on the fame of her great kinsman , said that no doubt wherever her son Allan went he would remember his pedigree and would on no account form an alliance below it . She told him that there were many handsome English ladies in India who went out on speculation , and that there were some to be picked up with property , but that neither charms nor wealth would suffice for the descendant from such a line without birth , which must ever be the first consideration . She talked so much about birth that for a moment I half fancied , and with pain — But what an idle fancy to suppose that she could think or care what MINE was ! Mr. Woodcourt seemed a little distressed by her prolixity , but he was too considerate to let her see it and contrived delicately to bring the conversation round to making his acknowledgments to my guardian for his hospitality and for the very happy hours — he called them the very happy hours — he had passed with us . The recollection of them , he said , would go with him wherever he went and would be always treasured . And so we gave him our hands , one after another — at least , they did — and I did ; and so he put his lips to Ada ’s hand — and to mine ; and so he went away upon his long , long voyage ! I was very busy indeed all day and wrote directions home to the servants , and wrote notes for my guardian , and dusted his books and papers , and jingled my housekeeping keys a good deal , one way and another . I was still busy between the lights , singing and working by the window , when who should come in but Caddy , whom I had no expectation of seeing ! “
119315	119319	119310	119310	Caddy	300	” said I , “
119324	119336	119339	119339	I	0	” She had such an exquisite little nosegay in her hand . “
119345	119349	119343	119343	Esther	280	” replied Caddy . “
119358	119359	119360	119360	Prince	437	” “
119365	119372	119360	119360	Prince	437	” said I in a whisper . “
119375	119390	119392	119392	Prince	437	” answered Caddy , shaking her head and holding them to me to smell . “
119394	119395	119392	119392	Prince	437	” “
119404	119407	119402	119402	Caddy	300	” said I. “
119414	119415	119411	119412	two lovers	3314	” “
119427	119431	119419	119419	they	3314	” said Caddy . “
119441	119532	119433	119433	they	3314	” I repeated , pinching her cheek . Caddy only laughed in return , and telling me that she had come for half an hour , at the expiration of which time Prince would be waiting for her at the corner , sat chatting with me and Ada in the window , every now and then handing me the flowers again or trying how they looked against my hair . At last , when she was going , she took me into my room and put them in my dress . “
119536	119542	119433	119433	they	3314	” said I , surprised . “
119546	119553	119433	119433	they	3314	” said Caddy with a kiss . “
119561	119562	119559	119559	somebody	851	” “
119566	119567	119559	119559	somebody	851	” “
119574	119578	119559	119559	somebody	851	” said Caddy . “
119621	119632	119559	119559	somebody	851	” said Caddy , adjusting them with a careful hand , “
119651	119652	119645	119645	somebody	851	” “
119662	119678	119684	119684	they	3315	” said Ada , coming laughingly behind me and clasping me merrily round the waist . “
119711	119929	119690	119690	They	3315	” CHAPTER XVIII Lady Dedlock It was not so easy as it had appeared at first to arrange for Richard ’s making a trial of Mr. Kenge ’s office . Richard himself was the chief impediment . As soon as he had it in his power to leave Mr. Badger at any moment , he began to doubt whether he wanted to leave him at all . He did n’t know , he said , really . It was n’t a bad profession ; he could n’t assert that he disliked it ; perhaps he liked it as well as he liked any other — suppose he gave it one more chance ! Upon that , he shut himself up for a few weeks with some books and some bones and seemed to acquire a considerable fund of information with great rapidity . His fervour , after lasting about a month , began to cool , and when it was quite cooled , began to grow warm again . His vacillations between law and medicine lasted so long that midsummer arrived before he finally separated from Mr. Badger and entered on an experimental course of Messrs. Kenge and Carboy . For all his waywardness , he took great credit to himself as being determined to be in earnest “
119933	119969	119690	119690	They	3315	” And he was so good - natured throughout , and in such high spirits , and so fond of Ada , that it was very difficult indeed to be otherwise than pleased with him . “
119975	119998	119690	119690	They	3315	” who , I may mention , found the wind much given , during this period , to stick in the east ; “
120004	120011	120001	120002	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” Richard would say to me , “
120055	120237	120238	120238	My	0	” The idea of his taking himself well to task , with that laughing face and heedless manner and with a fancy that everything could catch and nothing could hold , was ludicrously anomalous . However , he told us between - whiles that he was doing it to such an extent that he wondered his hair did n’t turn grey . His regular wind - up of the business was ( as I have said ) that he went to Mr. Kenge ’s about midsummer to try how he liked it . All this time he was , in money affairs , what I have described him in a former illustration — generous , profuse , wildly careless , but fully persuaded that he was rather calculating and prudent . I happened to say to Ada , in his presence , half jestingly , half seriously , about the time of his going to Mr. Kenge ’s , that he needed to have Fortunatus ’ purse , he made so light of money , which he answered in this way , “
120325	120419	120422	120423	little woman	2039	” It was a question much discussed between him and my guardian what arrangements should be made for his living in London while he experimented on the law , for we had long since gone back to Bleak House , and it was too far off to admit of his coming there oftener than once a week . My guardian told me that if Richard were to settle down at Mr. Kenge ’s he would take some apartments or chambers where we too could occasionally stay for a few days at a time ; “
120425	120435	120436	120436	he	3327	” he added , rubbing his head very significantly , “
120444	120793	120436	120436	he	3327	” The discussions ended in our hiring for him , by the month , a neat little furnished lodging in a quiet old house near Queen Square . He immediately began to spend all the money he had in buying the oddest little ornaments and luxuries for this lodging ; and so often as Ada and I dissuaded him from making any purchase that he had in contemplation which was particularly unnecessary and expensive , he took credit for what it would have cost and made out that to spend anything less on something else was to save the difference . While these affairs were in abeyance , our visit to Mr. Boythorn ’s was postponed . At length , Richard having taken possession of his lodging , there was nothing to prevent our departure . He could have gone with us at that time of the year very well , but he was in the full novelty of his new position and was making most energetic attempts to unravel the mysteries of the fatal suit . Consequently we went without him , and my darling was delighted to praise him for being so busy . We made a pleasant journey down into Lincolnshire by the coach and had an entertaining companion in Mr. Skimpole . His furniture had been all cleared off , it appeared , by the person who took possession of it on his blue - eyed daughter ’s birthday , but he seemed quite relieved to think that it was gone . Chairs and table , he said , were wearisome objects ; they were monotonous ideas , they had no variety of expression , they looked you out of countenance , and you looked them out of countenance . How pleasant , then , to be bound to no particular chairs and tables , but to sport like a butterfly among all the furniture on hire , and to flit from rosewood to mahogany , and from mahogany to walnut , and from this shape to that , as the humour took one ! “
120801	120813	120436	120436	he	3327	” said Mr. Skimpole with a quickened sense of the ludicrous , “
120919	120920	120914	120914	His	9726	” “
120923	120931	120973	120973	I	0	” said my guardian good - humouredly , “
120952	120953	120973	120973	I	0	” “
120956	120961	120973	120973	I	0	” returned Mr. Skimpole . “
121025	121026	121019	121019	He	286	” “
121032	121037	121019	121019	He	286	” said my guardian . “
121042	121047	121048	121048	I	0	” returned Mr. Skimpole . “
121332	121659	121319	121319	he	286	” If these were some of the inconveniences of Mr. Skimpole ’s childhood , it assuredly possessed its advantages too . On the journey he had a very good appetite for such refreshment as came in our way ( including a basket of choice hothouse peaches ) , but never thought of paying for anything . So when the coachman came round for his fee , he pleasantly asked him what he considered a very good fee indeed , now — a liberal one — and on his replying half a crown for a single passenger , said it was little enough too , all things considered , and left Mr. Jarndyce to give it him . It was delightful weather . The green corn waved so beautifully , the larks sang so joyfully , the hedges were so full of wild flowers , the trees were so thickly out in leaf , the bean - fields , with a light wind blowing over them , filled the air with such a delicious fragrance ! Late in the afternoon we came to the market - town where we were to alight from the coach — a dull little town with a church - spire , and a marketplace , and a market - cross , and one intensely sunny street , and a pond with an old horse cooling his legs in it , and a very few men sleepily lying and standing about in narrow little bits of shade . After the rustling of the leaves and the waving of the corn all along the road , it looked as still , as hot , as motionless a little town as England could produce . At the inn we found Mr. Boythorn on horseback , waiting with an open carriage to take us to his house , which was a few miles off . He was overjoyed to see us and dismounted with great alacrity . “
121663	121673	121319	121319	he	286	” said he after giving us a courteous greeting . “
121721	121722	121724	121724	he	11867	” “
121729	121742	121724	121724	he	11867	” said Mr. Skimpole , to whom he happened to address himself . “
121748	121749	121724	121724	he	11867	” “
121760	121770	121772	121773	two ladies	3353	” replied Mr. Boythorn , referring to his watch . “
121821	121851	121852	121852	I	0	” While he said this in tones of the greatest indignation , he handed us into the little phaeton with the utmost gentleness and was all smiles and pleasure . “
121858	121876	121852	121852	I	0	” he said , standing bare - headed at the carriage - door when all was ready , “
121942	121973	121935	121935	I	0	” And here , catching my guardian ’s eye , he broke into one of his tremendous laughs , which seemed to shake even the motionless little market - town . “
121982	122002	121980	121980	Lawrence	359	” said my guardian as we drove along and Mr. Boythorn trotted on the green turf by the roadside . “
122009	122014	122003	122005	Sir Arrogant Numskull	467	” replied Mr. Boythorn . “
122042	122065	122039	122040	My Lady	958	” in naming whom he always made a courtly gesture as if particularly to exclude her from any part in the quarrel , “
122127	122128	122129	122129	I	0	” “
122132	122139	122129	122129	I	0	” said my guardian , laughing , “
122163	122164	122165	122165	I	0	” “
122174	122196	122165	122165	I	0	” he said , bending his head to Ada and me with the smiling politeness which sat so gracefully upon him , “
122322	122323	122324	122324	I	0	” “
122333	122338	122324	122324	I	0	” said my guardian . “
122389	122390	122421	122426	a second Ajax defying the lightning	3382	” “
122393	122398	122421	122426	a second Ajax defying the lightning	3382	” said Mr. Boythorn . “
122512	122828	122487	122487	he	3375	” Our coming to the ridge of a hill we had been ascending enabled our friend to point out Chesney Wold itself to us and diverted his attention from its master . It was a picturesque old house in a fine park richly wooded . Among the trees and not far from the residence he pointed out the spire of the little church of which he had spoken . Oh , the solemn woods over which the light and shadow travelled swiftly , as if heavenly wings were sweeping on benignant errands through the summer air ; the smooth green slopes , the glittering water , the garden where the flowers were so symmetrically arranged in clusters of the richest colours , how beautiful they looked ! The house , with gable and chimney , and tower , and turret , and dark doorway , and broad terrace - walk , twining among the balustrades of which , and lying heaped upon the vases , there was one great flush of roses , seemed scarcely real in its light solidity and in the serene and peaceful hush that rested on all around it . To Ada and to me , that above all appeared the pervading influence . On everything , house , garden , terrace , green slopes , water , old oaks , fern , moss , woods again , and far away across the openings in the prospect to the distance lying wide before us with a purple bloom upon it , there seemed to be such undisturbed repose . When we came into the little village and passed a small inn with the sign of the Dedlock Arms swinging over the road in front , Mr. Boythorn interchanged greetings with a young gentleman sitting on a bench outside the inn - door who had some fishing - tackle lying beside him . “
122841	122846	122848	122848	he	3389	” said , he , “
122949	122950	122952	122952	he	3389	” “
122962	122966	122959	122960	Mr. Boythorn	359	” asked Ada . “
122974	122978	122971	122972	Miss Clare	290	” he returned , “
123015	123492	123011	123011	you	290	” Ada blushed , and Mr. Boythorn , trotting forward on his comely grey horse , dismounted at his own door and stood ready with extended arm and uncovered head to welcome us when we arrived . He lived in a pretty house , formerly the parsonage house , with a lawn in front , a bright flower - garden at the side , and a well - stocked orchard and kitchen - garden in the rear , enclosed with a venerable wall that had of itself a ripened ruddy look . But , indeed , everything about the place wore an aspect of maturity and abundance . The old lime - tree walk was like green cloisters , the very shadows of the cherry - trees and apple - trees were heavy with fruit , the gooseberry - bushes were so laden that their branches arched and rested on the earth , the strawberries and raspberries grew in like profusion , and the peaches basked by the hundred on the wall . Tumbled about among the spread nets and the glass frames sparkling and winking in the sun there were such heaps of drooping pods , and marrows , and cucumbers , that every foot of ground appeared a vegetable treasury , while the smell of sweet herbs and all kinds of wholesome growth ( to say nothing of the neighbouring meadows where the hay was carrying ) made the whole air a great nosegay . Such stillness and composure reigned within the orderly precincts of the old red wall that even the feathers hung in garlands to scare the birds hardly stirred ; and the wall had such a ripening influence that where , here and there high up , a disused nail and scrap of list still clung to it , it was easy to fancy that they had mellowed with the changing seasons and that they had rusted and decayed according to the common fate . The house , though a little disorderly in comparison with the garden , was a real old house with settles in the chimney of the brick - floored kitchen and great beams across the ceilings . On one side of it was the terrible piece of ground in dispute , where Mr. Boythorn maintained a sentry in a smock - frock day and night , whose duty was supposed to be , in cases of aggression , immediately to ring a large bell hung up there for the purpose , to unchain a great bull - dog established in a kennel as his ally , and generally to deal destruction on the enemy . Not content with these precautions , Mr. Boythorn had himself composed and posted there , on painted boards to which his name was attached in large letters , the following solemn warnings : “
123508	123509	123505	123506	Lawrence Boythorn	359	” “
123520	123521	123517	123518	Lawrence Boythorn	359	” “
123544	123545	123541	123542	Lawrence Boythorn	359	” “
123584	123609	123581	123582	Lawrence Boythorn	359	” These he showed us from the drawing - room window , while his bird was hopping about his head , and he laughed , “
123620	123639	123581	123582	Lawrence Boythorn	359	” to that extent as he pointed them out that I really thought he would have hurt himself . “
123650	123659	123581	123582	Lawrence Boythorn	359	” said Mr. Skimpole in his light way , “
123669	123670	123661	123661	you	359	” “
123675	123683	123661	123661	you	359	” returned Mr. Boythorn with unspeakable warmth . “
123772	124197	123762	123762	I	0	” We arrived at his house on a Saturday . On the Sunday morning we all set forth to walk to the little church in the park . Entering the park , almost immediately by the disputed ground , we pursued a pleasant footpath winding among the verdant turf and the beautiful trees until it brought us to the church - porch . The congregation was extremely small and quite a rustic one with the exception of a large muster of servants from the house , some of whom were already in their seats , while others were yet dropping in . There were some stately footmen , and there was a perfect picture of an old coachman , who looked as if he were the official representative of all the pomps and vanities that had ever been put into his coach . There was a very pretty show of young women , and above them , the handsome old face and fine responsible portly figure of the housekeeper towered pre - eminent . The pretty girl of whom Mr. Boythorn had told us was close by her . She was so very pretty that I might have known her by her beauty even if I had not seen how blushingly conscious she was of the eyes of the young fisherman , whom I discovered not far off . One face , and not an agreeable one , though it was handsome , seemed maliciously watchful of this pretty girl , and indeed of every one and everything there . It was a Frenchwoman ’s . As the bell was yet ringing and the great people were not yet come , I had leisure to glance over the church , which smelt as earthy as a grave , and to think what a shady , ancient , solemn little church it was . The windows , heavily shaded by trees , admitted a subdued light that made the faces around me pale , and darkened the old brasses in the pavement and the time and damp - worn monuments , and rendered the sunshine in the little porch , where a monotonous ringer was working at the bell , inestimably bright . But a stir in that direction , a gathering of reverential awe in the rustic faces , and a blandly ferocious assumption on the part of Mr. Boythorn of being resolutely unconscious of somebody ’s existence forewarned me that the great people were come and that the service was going to begin . “
124216	124914	124915	124915	He	3410	” Shall I ever forget the rapid beating at my heart , occasioned by the look I met as I stood up ! Shall I ever forget the manner in which those handsome proud eyes seemed to spring out of their languor and to hold mine ! It was only a moment before I cast mine down — released again , if I may say so — on my book ; but I knew the beautiful face quite well in that short space of time . And , very strangely , there was something quickened within me , associated with the lonely days at my godmother ’s ; yes , away even to the days when I had stood on tiptoe to dress myself at my little glass after dressing my doll . And this , although I had never seen this lady ’s face before in all my life — I was quite sure of it — absolutely certain . It was easy to know that the ceremonious , gouty , grey - haired gentleman , the only other occupant of the great pew , was Sir Leicester Dedlock , and that the lady was Lady Dedlock . But why her face should be , in a confused way , like a broken glass to me , in which I saw scraps of old remembrances , and why I should be so fluttered and troubled ( for I was still ) by having casually met her eyes , I could not think . I felt it to be an unmeaning weakness in me and tried to overcome it by attending to the words I heard . Then , very strangely , I seemed to hear them , not in the reader ’s voice , but in the well - remembered voice of my godmother . This made me think , did Lady Dedlock ’s face accidentally resemble my godmother ’s ? It might be that it did , a little ; but the expression was so different , and the stern decision which had worn into my godmother ’s face , like weather into rocks , was so completely wanting in the face before me that it could not be that resemblance which had struck me . Neither did I know the loftiness and haughtiness of Lady Dedlock ’s face , at all , in any one . And yet I — I , little Esther Summerson , the child who lived a life apart and on whose birthday there was no rejoicing — seemed to arise before my own eyes , evoked out of the past by some power in this fashionable lady , whom I not only entertained no fancy that I had ever seen , but whom I perfectly well knew I had never seen until that hour . It made me tremble so to be thrown into this unaccountable agitation that I was conscious of being distressed even by the observation of the French maid , though I knew she had been looking watchfully here , and there , and everywhere , from the moment of her coming into the church . By degrees , though very slowly , I at last overcame my strange emotion . After a long time , I looked towards Lady Dedlock again . It was while they were preparing to sing , before the sermon . She took no heed of me , and the beating at my heart was gone . Neither did it revive for more than a few moments when she once or twice afterwards glanced at Ada or at me through her glass . The service being concluded , Sir Leicester gave his arm with much taste and gallantry to Lady Dedlock — though he was obliged to walk by the help of a thick stick — and escorted her out of church to the pony carriage in which they had come . The servants then dispersed , and so did the congregation , whom Sir Leicester had contemplated all along ( Mr. Skimpole said to Mr. Boythorn ’s infinite delight ) as if he were a considerable landed proprietor in heaven . “
124920	124925	124926	124926	He	3410	” said Mr. Boythorn . “
124946	124947	124949	124949	you	3414	” “
124952	124962	124949	124949	you	3414	” pursued Mr. Skimpole very unexpectedly to Mr. Boythorn , “
124976	124977	124970	124974	a man of that sort	3415	” “
124981	124986	124989	124989	he	3410	” said Mr. Boythorn . “
124995	125000	124989	124989	he	3410	” pursued Mr. Skimpole . “
125009	125010	125011	125011	I	0	” “
125014	125022	125024	125024	you	3414	” said Mr. Boythorn with great vigour . “
125027	125037	125024	125024	you	3414	” returned Mr. Skimpole in his easy light vein . “
125246	125247	125243	125244	a child	938	” “
125259	125264	125250	125250	you	3422	” said Mr. Boythorn , “
125282	125283	125307	125307	I	0	” “
125287	125301	125307	125307	I	0	” said Mr. Skimpole with an appearance of the utmost simplicity and candour . “
125400	125401	125390	125391	excellent Boythorn	3427	” “
125408	125419	125404	125404	Boythorn	359	” returned our host , swelling and growing very red , “
125424	125425	125420	125420	I	0	” “
125429	125434	125437	125437	he	359	” said Mr. Skimpole . “
125440	125441	125437	125437	he	359	” “
125450	125468	125470	125470	he	359	” cried Mr. Boythorn in a violent burst and stopping to strike his stick upon the ground . “
125489	125490	125470	125470	he	359	” “
125501	125515	125493	125494	Harold Skimpole	323	” he returned in his gayest manner and with his most ingenuous smile , “
125618	125794	125610	125610	I	0	” This was one of many little dialogues between them which I always expected to end , and which I dare say would have ended under other circumstances , in some violent explosion on the part of our host . But he had so high a sense of his hospitable and responsible position as our entertainer , and my guardian laughed so sincerely at and with Mr. Skimpole , as a child who blew bubbles and broke them all day long , that matters never went beyond this point . Mr. Skimpole , who always seemed quite unconscious of having been on delicate ground , then betook himself to beginning some sketch in the park which he never finished , or to playing fragments of airs on the piano , or to singing scraps of songs , or to lying down on his back under a tree and looking at the sky — which he could n’t help thinking , he said , was what he was meant for ; it suited him so exactly . “
125799	125811	125610	125610	I	0	” he would say to us ( on his back ) , “
126018	126593	125998	125998	I	0	” I always wondered on these occasions whether he ever thought of Mrs. Skimpole and the children , and in what point of view they presented themselves to his cosmopolitan mind . So far as I could understand , they rarely presented themselves at all . The week had gone round to the Saturday following that beating of my heart in the church ; and every day had been so bright and blue that to ramble in the woods , and to see the light striking down among the transparent leaves and sparkling in the beautiful interlacings of the shadows of the trees , while the birds poured out their songs and the air was drowsy with the hum of insects , had been most delightful . We had one favourite spot , deep in moss and last year ’s leaves , where there were some felled trees from which the bark was all stripped off . Seated among these , we looked through a green vista supported by thousands of natural columns , the whitened stems of trees , upon a distant prospect made so radiant by its contrast with the shade in which we sat and made so precious by the arched perspective through which we saw it that it was like a glimpse of the better land . Upon the Saturday we sat here , Mr. Jarndyce , Ada , and I , until we heard thunder muttering in the distance and felt the large raindrops rattle through the leaves . The weather had been all the week extremely sultry , but the storm broke so suddenly — upon us , at least , in that sheltered spot — that before we reached the outskirts of the wood the thunder and lightning were frequent and the rain came plunging through the leaves as if every drop were a great leaden bead . As it was not a time for standing among trees , we ran out of the wood , and up and down the moss - grown steps which crossed the plantation - fence like two broad - staved ladders placed back to back , and made for a keeper ’s lodge which was close at hand . We had often noticed the dark beauty of this lodge standing in a deep twilight of trees , and how the ivy clustered over it , and how there was a steep hollow near , where we had once seen the keeper ’s dog dive down into the fern as if it were water . The lodge was so dark within , now the sky was overcast , that we only clearly saw the man who came to the door when we took shelter there and put two chairs for Ada and me . The lattice - windows were all thrown open , and we sat just within the doorway watching the storm . It was grand to see how the wind awoke , and bent the trees , and drove the rain before it like a cloud of smoke ; and to hear the solemn thunder and to see the lightning ; and while thinking with awe of the tremendous powers by which our little lives are encompassed , to consider how beneficent they are and how upon the smallest flower and leaf there was already a freshness poured from all this seeming rage which seemed to make creation new again . “
126606	126607	125998	125998	I	0	” “
126615	126730	126731	126731	I	0	” said Ada quietly . Ada said it to me , but I had not spoken . The beating of my heart came back again . I had never heard the voice , as I had never seen the face , but it affected me in the same strange way . Again , in a moment , there arose before my mind innumerable pictures of myself . Lady Dedlock had taken shelter in the lodge before our arrival there and had come out of the gloom within . She stood behind my chair with her hand upon it . I saw her with her hand close to my shoulder when I turned my head . “
126736	126753	126731	126731	I	0	” she said . No . It was not fright . Why should I be frightened ! “
126757	126765	126731	126731	I	0	” said Lady Dedlock to my guardian , “
126776	126777	126773	126774	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” “
126794	126798	126778	126778	Your	0	” he returned . “

126855	126863	126848	126848	I	0	” returned my guardian with a smile , “
126869	126960	126962	126978	the young gentleman disposed of whom you wrote to Sir Leicester about and whose wishes Sir Leicester	3441	” She had given him her hand in an indifferent way that seemed habitual to her and spoke in a correspondingly indifferent manner , though in a very pleasant voice . She was as graceful as she was beautiful , perfectly self - possessed , and had the air , I thought , of being able to attract and interest any one if she had thought it worth her while . The keeper had brought her a chair on which she sat in the middle of the porch between us . “
126994	127004	127005	127005	I	0	” she said over her shoulder to my guardian . “
127009	127065	127005	127005	I	0	” said he . She seemed to respect him and even to wish to conciliate him . There was something very winning in her haughty manner , and it became more familiar — I was going to say more easy , but that could hardly be — as she spoke to him over her shoulder . “
127077	127085	127074	127075	Miss Clare	290	” He presented Ada , in form . “
127098	127110	127074	127075	Miss Clare	290	” said Lady Dedlock to Mr. Jarndyce over her shoulder again , “
127126	127134	127124	127124	me	0	” and she turned full upon me , “
127141	127142	127124	127124	me	0	” “
127150	127155	127156	127156	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
127167	127168	127160	127162	no Lord Chancellor	3445	” “
127177	127182	127160	127162	no Lord Chancellor	3445	” said my Lady . “
127185	127186	127160	127162	no Lord Chancellor	3445	” “
127195	127241	127192	127193	her guardian	10098	” Lady Dedlock looked at me , and I looked at her and said I was indeed . All at once she turned from me with a hasty air , almost expressive of displeasure or dislike , and spoke to him over her shoulder again . “
127257	127258	127254	127255	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” “
127280	127284	127274	127274	I	0	” he returned . “
127303	127310	127288	127288	you	286	” she said with some disdain . “
127320	127321	127311	127311	I	0	” “
127331	127336	127322	127322	You	3449	” said my guardian , “
127353	127354	127344	127344	I	0	” “
127358	127365	127344	127344	I	0	” she repeated , slightly laughing . “
127368	127437	127344	127344	I	0	” With her air of superiority , and power , and fascination , and I know not what , she seemed to regard Ada and me as little more than children . So , as she slightly laughed and afterwards sat looking at the rain , she was as self - possessed and as free to occupy herself with her own thoughts as if she had been alone . “
127455	127464	127440	127440	you	0	” she said , looking at him again . “
127473	127477	127471	127471	oftener	3453	” he returned . “
127484	127489	127478	127478	We	3452	” said Lady Dedlock , “
127518	127591	127592	127593	The messenger	3454	” Lady Dedlock again sat looking at the rain . The storm soon began to pass upon its way . The shower greatly abated , the lightning ceased , the thunder rolled among the distant hills , and the sun began to glisten on the wet leaves and the falling rain . As we sat there , silently , we saw a little pony phaeton coming towards us at a merry pace . “
127601	127606	127592	127593	The messenger	3454	” said the keeper , “
127611	127667	127592	127593	The messenger	3454	” As it drove up , we saw that there were two people inside . There alighted from it , with some cloaks and wrappers , first the Frenchwoman whom I had seen in church , and secondly the pretty girl , the Frenchwoman with a defiant confidence , the pretty girl confused and hesitating . “
127671	127676	127592	127593	The messenger	3454	” said Lady Dedlock . “
127679	127680	127681	127681	I	0	” “
127693	127698	127686	127687	my Lady	958	” said the Frenchwoman . “
127706	127707	127703	127704	the attendant	3459	” “
127719	127725	127711	127711	you	958	” said the pretty girl . “
127733	127739	127731	127731	child	9522	” replied her mistress calmly . “
127746	127781	127731	127731	child	9522	” She slightly stooped her shoulders to receive it , and the pretty girl lightly dropped it in its place . The Frenchwoman stood unnoticed , looking on with her lips very tightly set . “
127786	127794	127731	127731	child	9522	” said Lady Dedlock to Mr. Jarndyce , “
127826	127878	127806	127806	You	0	” But as he would on no account accept this offer , she took a graceful leave of Ada — none of me — and put her hand upon his proffered arm , and got into the carriage , which was a little , low , park carriage with a hood . “
127884	127892	127806	127806	You	0	” she said to the pretty girl ; “
127901	128014	128016	128018	that young woman	3467	” The carriage rolled away , and the Frenchwoman , with the wrappers she had brought hanging over her arm , remained standing where she had alighted . I suppose there is nothing pride can so little bear with as pride itself , and that she was punished for her imperious manner . Her retaliation was the most singular I could have imagined . She remained perfectly still until the carriage had turned into the drive , and then , without the least discomposure of countenance , slipped off her shoes , left them on the ground , and walked deliberately in the same direction through the wettest of the wet grass . “
128021	128026	128016	128018	that young woman	3467	” said my guardian . “
128033	128049	128016	128018	that young woman	3467	” said the keeper , who , with his wife , was looking after her . “
128106	128107	128098	128098	she	396	” “
128119	128124	128111	128111	she	396	” said my guardian . “
128139	128144	128111	128111	she	396	” said the man . “
128153	128158	128147	128147	she	396	” said the woman . “
128179	128880	128170	128170	I	0	” We passed not far from the house a few minutes afterwards . Peaceful as it had looked when we first saw it , it looked even more so now , with a diamond spray glittering all about it , a light wind blowing , the birds no longer hushed but singing strongly , everything refreshed by the late rain , and the little carriage shining at the doorway like a fairy carriage made of silver . Still , very steadfastly and quietly walking towards it , a peaceful figure too in the landscape , went Mademoiselle Hortense , shoeless , through the wet grass . CHAPTER XIX Moving On It is the long vacation in the regions of Chancery Lane . The good ships Law and Equity , those teak - built , copper - bottomed , iron - fastened , brazen - faced , and not by any means fast - sailing clippers are laid up in ordinary . The Flying Dutchman , with a crew of ghostly clients imploring all whom they may encounter to peruse their papers , has drifted , for the time being , heaven knows where . The courts are all shut up ; the public offices lie in a hot sleep . Westminster Hall itself is a shady solitude where nightingales might sing , and a tenderer class of suitors than is usually found there , walk . The Temple , Chancery Lane , Serjeants ’ Inn , and Lincoln ’s Inn even unto the Fields are like tidal harbours at low water , where stranded proceedings , offices at anchor , idle clerks lounging on lop - sided stools that will not recover their perpendicular until the current of Term sets in , lie high and dry upon the ooze of the long vacation . Outer doors of chambers are shut up by the score , messages and parcels are to be left at the Porter ’s Lodge by the bushel . A crop of grass would grow in the chinks of the stone pavement outside Lincoln ’s Inn Hall , but that the ticket - porters , who have nothing to do beyond sitting in the shade there , with their white aprons over their heads to keep the flies off , grub it up and eat it thoughtfully . There is only one judge in town . Even he only comes twice a week to sit in chambers . If the country folks of those assize towns on his circuit could see him now ! No full - bottomed wig , no red petticoats , no fur , no javelin - men , no white wands . Merely a close - shaved gentleman in white trousers and a white hat , with sea - bronze on the judicial countenance , and a strip of bark peeled by the solar rays from the judicial nose , who calls in at the shell - fish shop as he comes along and drinks iced ginger - beer ! The bar of England is scattered over the face of the earth . How England can get on through four long summer months without its bar — which is its acknowledged refuge in adversity and its only legitimate triumph in prosperity — is beside the question ; assuredly that shield and buckler of Britannia are not in present wear . The learned gentleman who is always so tremendously indignant at the unprecedented outrage committed on the feelings of his client by the opposite party that he never seems likely to recover it is doing infinitely better than might be expected in Switzerland . The learned gentleman who does the withering business and who blights all opponents with his gloomy sarcasm is as merry as a grig at a French watering - place . The learned gentleman who weeps by the pint on the smallest provocation has not shed a tear these six weeks . The very learned gentleman who has cooled the natural heat of his gingery complexion in pools and fountains of law until he has become great in knotty arguments for term - time , when he poses the drowsy bench with legal “
128883	129553	128170	128170	I	0	” inexplicable to the uninitiated and to most of the initiated too , is roaming , with a characteristic delight in aridity and dust , about Constantinople . Other dispersed fragments of the same great palladium are to be found on the canals of Venice , at the second cataract of the Nile , in the baths of Germany , and sprinkled on the sea - sand all over the English coast . Scarcely one is to be encountered in the deserted region of Chancery Lane . If such a lonely member of the bar do flit across the waste , and come upon a prowling suitor who is unable to leave off haunting the scenes of his anxiety , they frighten one another and retreat into opposite shades . It is the hottest long vacation known for many years . All the young clerks are madly in love , and according to their various degrees , pine for bliss with the beloved object , at Margate , Ramsgate , or Gravesend . All the middle - aged clerks think their families too large . All the unowned dogs who stray into the Inns of Court and pant about staircases and other dry places seeking water give short howls of aggravation . All the blind men ’s dogs in the streets draw their masters against pumps or trip them over buckets . A shop with a sun - blind , and a watered pavement , and a bowl of gold and silver fish in the window , is a sanctuary . Temple Bar gets so hot that it is , to the adjacent Strand and Fleet Street , what a heater is in an urn , and keeps them simmering all night . There are offices about the Inns of Court in which a man might be cool , if any coolness were worth purchasing at such a price in dullness ; but the little thoroughfares immediately outside those retirements seem to blaze . In Mr. Krook ’s court , it is so hot that the people turn their houses inside out and sit in chairs upon the pavement — Mr. Krook included , who there pursues his studies , with his cat ( who never is too hot ) by his side . The Sol ’s Arms has discontinued the Harmonic Meetings for the season , and Little Swills is engaged at the Pastoral Gardens down the river , where he comes out in quite an innocent manner and sings comic ditties of a juvenile complexion calculated ( as the bill says ) not to wound the feelings of the most fastidious mind . Over all the legal neighbourhood there hangs , like some great veil of rust or gigantic cobweb , the idleness and pensiveness of the long vacation . Mr. Snagsby , law - stationer of Cook ’s Court , Cursitor Street , is sensible of the influence not only in his mind as a sympathetic and contemplative man , but also in his business as a law - stationer aforesaid . He has more leisure for musing in Staple Inn and in the Rolls Yard during the long vacation than at other seasons , and he says to the two ’ prentices , what a thing it is in such hot weather to think that you live in an island with the sea a - rolling and a - bowling right round you . Guster is busy in the little drawing - room on this present afternoon in the long vacation , when Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby have it in contemplation to receive company . The expected guests are rather select than numerous , being Mr. and Mrs. Chadband and no more . From Mr. Chadband ’s being much given to describe himself , both verbally and in writing , as a vessel , he is occasionally mistaken by strangers for a gentleman connected with navigation , but he is , as he expresses it , “
129558	129654	128170	128170	I	0	” Mr. Chadband is attached to no particular denomination and is considered by his persecutors to have nothing so very remarkable to say on the greatest of subjects as to render his volunteering , on his own account , at all incumbent on his conscience ; but he has his followers , and Mrs. Snagsby is of the number . Mrs. Snagsby has but recently taken a passage upward by the vessel , Chadband ; and her attention was attracted to that Bark A 1 , when she was something flushed by the hot weather . “
129659	129670	129674	129674	her	2319	” says Mr. Snagsby to the sparrows in Staple Inn , “
129682	129883	129674	129674	her	2319	” So Guster , much impressed by regarding herself for the time as the handmaid of Chadband , whom she knows to be endowed with the gift of holding forth for four hours at a stretch , prepares the little drawing - room for tea . All the furniture is shaken and dusted , the portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are touched up with a wet cloth , the best tea - service is set forth , and there is excellent provision made of dainty new bread , crusty twists , cool fresh butter , thin slices of ham , tongue , and German sausage , and delicate little rows of anchovies nestling in parsley , not to mention new - laid eggs , to be brought up warm in a napkin , and hot buttered toast . For Chadband is rather a consuming vessel — the persecutors say a gorging vessel — and can wield such weapons of the flesh as a knife and fork remarkably well . Mr. Snagsby in his best coat , looking at all the preparations when they are completed and coughing his cough of deference behind his hand , says to Mrs. Snagsby , “
129898	129899	129892	129893	Mrs. Chadband	471	” “
129903	129918	129892	129893	Mrs. Chadband	471	” says Mrs. Snagsby . Mr. Snagsby observes in a mild and casual way that “
129924	129925	129892	129893	Mrs. Chadband	471	” “
129935	129966	129927	129927	you	3472	” is Mrs. Snagsby ’s reproachful remark . Mr. Snagsby does look as if he would like it very much , but he says , with his cough of mildness , “
129980	129981	129974	129974	I	0	” “
129986	129991	129974	129974	I	0	” says Mrs. Snagsby , “
129995	129996	129974	129974	I	0	” “
130003	130008	129974	129974	I	0	” says Mr. Snagsby . “
130052	130053	129974	129974	I	0	” “
130060	130067	129974	129974	I	0	” Mrs. Snagsby repeats with severity . “
130080	130081	130077	130078	a fighter	3480	” “
130089	130209	130210	130210	Mr.	3482	” says Mr. Snagsby . Here , Guster , who had been looking out of the bedroom window , comes rustling and scratching down the little staircase like a popular ghost , and falling flushed into the drawing - room , announces that Mr. and Mrs. Chadband have appeared in the court . The bell at the inner door in the passage immediately thereafter tinkling , she is admonished by Mrs. Snagsby , on pain of instant reconsignment to her patron saint , not to omit the ceremony of announcement . Much discomposed in her nerves ( which were previously in the best order ) by this threat , she so fearfully mutilates that point of state as to announce “
130222	130349	130350	130351	My friends	1582	” and retires conscience - stricken from the presence . Mr. Chadband is a large yellow man with a fat smile and a general appearance of having a good deal of train oil in his system . Mrs. Chadband is a stern , severe - looking , silent woman . Mr. Chadband moves softly and cumbrously , not unlike a bear who has been taught to walk upright . He is very much embarrassed about the arms , as if they were inconvenient to him and he wanted to grovel , is very much in a perspiration about the head , and never speaks without first putting up his great hand , as delivering a token to his hearers that he is going to edify them . “
130353	130358	130350	130351	My friends	1582	” says Mr. Chadband , “
130451	130478	130440	130440	I	0	” In consequence of Mrs. Snagsby looking deeply edified , Mr. Snagsby thinks it expedient on the whole to say amen , which is well received . “
130484	130489	130440	130440	I	0	” proceeds Mr. Chadband , “
130497	130523	130491	130491	I	0	” Guster presents herself . Mrs. Snagsby , in a spectral bass voice and without removing her eyes from Chadband , says with dreadful distinctness , “
130527	130528	130491	130491	I	0	” “
130534	130538	130491	130491	I	0	” says Chadband , “
130554	130561	130540	130540	I	0	” Guster is heard unaccountably to murmur “
130571	130579	130540	130540	I	0	” The spectral voice repeats more solemnly , “
130583	130584	130587	130588	my friends	1582	” “
130590	130595	130587	130588	my friends	1582	” says Mr. Chadband , “
130605	130609	130587	130588	my friends	1582	” Still Guster reiterates “
130619	130647	130587	130588	my friends	1582	” Mr. Chadband , pausing with the resignation of a man accustomed to be persecuted and languidly folding up his chin into his fat smile , says , “
130658	130659	130656	130656	maiden	3496	” “
130686	130692	130676	130676	he	9496	” says Guster , breathless . “
130695	130700	130676	130676	he	9496	” returns Mrs. Chadband . “
130705	130709	130710	130710	he	9496	” Guster replied that “
130722	130747	130710	130710	he	9496	” Mrs. Snagsby and Mrs. Chadband are proceeding to grow shrill in indignation when Mr. Chadband quiets the tumult by lifting up his hand . “
130751	130755	130710	130710	he	9496	” says he , “
130787	130807	130808	130808	You	0	” While Mrs. Snagsby , drawing her breath , looks hard at Mr. Snagsby , as who should say , “
130813	130873	130810	130811	this apostle	3501	” and while Mr. Chadband glows with humility and train oil , Mrs. Chadband pays the money . It is Mr. Chadband ’s habit — it is the head and front of his pretensions indeed — to keep this sort of debtor and creditor account in the smallest items and to post it publicly on the most trivial occasions . “
130877	130881	130810	130811	this apostle	3501	” says Chadband , “
130919	130955	130956	130957	My friends	1582	” With which remark , which appears from its sound to be an extract in verse , Mr. Chadband stalks to the table , and before taking a chair , lifts up his admonitory hand . “
130959	130963	130956	130957	My friends	1582	” says he , “
131049	131073	131046	131046	my	0	” Mr. Snagsby , presuming on the success of his last point , ventures to observe in a cheerful and rather knowing tone , “
131077	131087	131088	131088	I	0	” But is immediately frowned down by Mrs. Snagsby . “
131094	131108	131088	131088	I	0	” pursues Mr. Chadband , utterly rejecting and obliterating Mr. Snagsby ’s suggestion , “
131208	131217	131183	131183	my	0	” says Chadband , glancing over the table , “
131282	131550	131620	131620	my	0	” The persecutors denied that there was any particular gift in Mr. Chadband ’s piling verbose flights of stairs , one upon another , after this fashion . But this can only be received as a proof of their determination to persecute , since it must be within everybody ’s experience that the Chadband style of oratory is widely received and much admired . Mr. Chadband , however , having concluded for the present , sits down at Mr. Snagsby ’s table and lays about him prodigiously . The conversion of nutriment of any sort into oil of the quality already mentioned appears to be a process so inseparable from the constitution of this exemplary vessel that in beginning to eat and drink , he may be described as always becoming a kind of considerable oil mills or other large factory for the production of that article on a wholesale scale . On the present evening of the long vacation , in Cook ’s Court , Cursitor Street , he does such a powerful stroke of business that the warehouse appears to be quite full when the works cease . At this period of the entertainment , Guster , who has never recovered her first failure , but has neglected no possible or impossible means of bringing the establishment and herself into contempt — among which may be briefly enumerated her unexpectedly performing clashing military music on Mr. Chadband ’s head with plates , and afterwards crowning that gentleman with muffins — at which period of the entertainment , Guster whispers Mr. Snagsby that he is wanted . “
131571	131578	131667	131667	sar	3516	” says Mr. Snagsby , rising , “
131591	131616	131667	131667	sar	3516	” Mr. Snagsby descends and finds the two ’ prentices intently contemplating a police constable , who holds a ragged boy by the arm . “
131623	131628	131667	131667	sar	3516	” says Mr. Snagsby , “
131634	131635	131636	131637	This boy	10812	” “
131639	131644	131646	131646	he	10812	” says the constable , “
131657	131658	131646	131646	he	10812	” “
131669	131683	131659	131659	I	0	” cries the boy , wiping away his grimy tears with his arm . “
131718	131719	131720	131720	He	10812	” “
131726	131749	131720	131720	He	10812	” says the constable calmly , with a slight professional hitch of his neck involving its better settlement in his stiff stock , “
131784	131785	131779	131779	He	10812	” “
131797	131822	131779	131779	He	10812	” cries the boy , clutching quite desperately at his hair and beating his bare feet upon the floor of Mr. Snagsby ’s passage . “
131840	131851	131852	131852	My	0	” says the constable , giving him a passionless shake . “
131871	131872	131862	131862	I	0	” “
131876	131881	131862	131862	I	0	” cries the boy . “
131891	131910	131886	131886	constable	3520	” says Mr. Snagsby wistfully , and coughing behind his hand his cough of great perplexity and doubt , “
131924	131925	131926	131926	My	0	” “
131934	131939	131926	131926	My	0	” replies the constable . “
131951	132117	131940	131940	My	0	” Do you hear , Jo ? It is nothing to you or to any one else that the great lights of the parliamentary sky have failed for some few years in this business to set you the example of moving on . The one grand recipe remains for you — the profound philosophical prescription — the be - all and the end - all of your strange existence upon earth . Move on ! You are by no means to move off , Jo , for the great lights ca n’t at all agree about that . Move on ! Mr. Snagsby says nothing to this effect , says nothing at all indeed , but coughs his forlornest cough , expressive of no thoroughfare in any direction . By this time Mr. and Mrs. Chadband and Mrs. Snagsby , hearing the altercation , have appeared upon the stairs . Guster having never left the end of the passage , the whole household are assembled . “
132125	132130	132123	132123	sir	9496	” says the constable , “
132142	132154	132137	132137	He	10812	” Mrs. Snagsby , from her elevation , instantly cries out , “
132160	132161	132156	132156	he	10812	” “
132168	132178	132156	132156	he	10812	” says Mr. Snagsby , looking up the staircase . “
132228	132249	132226	132226	constable	3520	” To whom the law - stationer relates his Joful and woeful experience , suppressing the half - crown fact . “
132252	132257	132264	132264	he	3527	” says the constable , “
132349	132375	132345	132347	the young man	1916	” Enter Mr. Guppy , who nods to Mr. Snagsby and touches his hat with the chivalry of clerkship to the ladies on the stairs . “
132393	132403	132386	132386	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy to the law - stationer , “
132423	132424	132411	132411	I	0	” “
132436	132441	132432	132432	you	9540	” says Mr. Snagsby , “
132449	132466	132443	132443	I	0	” And Mr. Snagsby again relates his experience , again suppressing the half - crown fact . “
132475	132485	132469	132469	I	0	” says the constable , then , to Jo . “
132511	132512	132513	132513	I	0	” “
132526	132530	132513	132513	I	0	” replies Jo . “
132571	132572	132573	132573	You	3535	” “
132582	132587	132580	132580	you	3535	” says the constable . “
132601	132605	132606	132606	I	0	” replies Jo . “
132624	132635	132613	132613	I	0	” says the constable , producing them to the company , “
132644	132645	132646	132646	They	3546	” “
132655	132659	132652	132653	Mr. Snagsby	362	” says Jo , “
132810	132818	132791	132791	she	2488	” says Jo , with dirty tears , “
132880	132881	132869	132869	he	2313	” “
132901	132913	132899	132899	you	3554	” says the constable , eyeing him aside with ineffable disdain . “
132924	132928	132914	132914	I	0	” replies Jo . “
132950	132951	132952	132952	You	3554	” “
132958	132966	132952	132952	You	3554	” the constable observes to the audience . “
132990	132991	132983	132983	you	362	” “
132994	133002	132983	132983	you	362	” cries Mrs. Snagsby from the stairs . “
133007	133012	133013	133013	Constable	3520	” pleads her husband . “
133032	133037	133024	133024	You	3520	” says Mr. Snagsby . “
133045	133051	133038	133038	I	0	” says the hapless Jo . “
133057	133062	133063	133063	You	3520	” observes the constable . “
133109	133436	133063	133063	You	3520	” With this farewell hint and pointing generally to the setting sun as a likely place to move on to , the constable bids his auditors good afternoon and makes the echoes of Cook ’s Court perform slow music for him as he walks away on the shady side , carrying his iron - bound hat in his hand for a little ventilation . Now , Jo ’s improbable story concerning the lady and the sovereign has awakened more or less the curiosity of all the company . Mr. Guppy , who has an inquiring mind in matters of evidence and who has been suffering severely from the lassitude of the long vacation , takes that interest in the case that he enters on a regular cross - examination of the witness , which is found so interesting by the ladies that Mrs. Snagsby politely invites him to step upstairs and drink a cup of tea , if he will excuse the disarranged state of the tea - table , consequent on their previous exertions . Mr. Guppy yielding his assent to this proposal , Jo is requested to follow into the drawing - room doorway , where Mr. Guppy takes him in hand as a witness , patting him into this shape , that shape , and the other shape like a butterman dealing with so much butter , and worrying him according to the best models . Nor is the examination unlike many such model displays , both in respect of its eliciting nothing and of its being lengthy , for Mr. Guppy is sensible of his talent , and Mrs. Snagsby feels not only that it gratifies her inquisitive disposition , but that it lifts her husband ’s establishment higher up in the law . During the progress of this keen encounter , the vessel Chadband , being merely engaged in the oil trade , gets aground and waits to be floated off . “
133439	133444	133063	133063	You	3520	” says Mr. Guppy . “
133479	133489	133490	133490	You	0	” Mrs. Chadband whispers Mrs. Snagsby , who exclaims , “
133496	133497	133490	133490	You	0	” “
133501	133506	133490	133490	You	0	” replied Mrs. Chadband . “
133517	133526	133490	133490	You	0	” Mrs. Snagsby triumphantly explains to Mr. Guppy . “
133539	133540	133535	133537	Reverend Mr. Chadband	472	” “
133545	133550	133535	133537	Reverend Mr. Chadband	472	” says Mr. Guppy . “
133558	133563	133571	133571	ma’am	9572	” says Mrs. Chadband . “
133573	133584	133565	133565	you	471	” says Mr. Guppy , transferring his cross - examination . “
133587	133588	133565	133565	you	471	” “
133597	133608	133565	133565	you	471	” says Mr. Guppy . Mrs. Chadband shakes her head . “
133624	133642	133614	133620	somebody who was a party in something	3571	” says Mr. Guppy , who likes nothing better than to model his conversation on forensic principles . “
133649	133664	133614	133620	somebody who was a party in something	3571	” replies Mrs. Chadband , humouring the joke with a hard - favoured smile . “
133671	133676	133614	133620	somebody who was a party in something	3571	” repeats Mr. Guppy . “
133739	133740	133735	133735	woman	2689	” “
133743	133750	133735	133735	woman	2689	” says Mrs. Chadband as before . “
133756	133779	133753	133754	A child	938	” says Mr. Guppy , throwing on the admiring Mrs. Snagsby the regular acute professional eye which is thrown on British jurymen . “
133796	133797	133785	133785	you	9572	” “
133807	133818	133805	133805	sir	9496	” says Mrs. Chadband with another hard - favoured smile . “
133861	133862	133859	133859	Carboy	280	” “
133868	133875	133863	133864	Miss Summerson	280	” cries Mr. Guppy , excited . “
133882	133889	133876	133876	I	0	” says Mrs. Chadband with austerity . “
133927	133928	133920	133920	she	280	” “
133933	133944	133920	133920	she	280	” returns Mr. Guppy , moving across the small apartment , “
133985	134018	133973	133973	me	0	” Mr. Chadband , at last seeing his opportunity , makes his accustomed signal and rises with a smoking head , which he dabs with his pocket - handkerchief . Mrs. Snagsby whispers “
134021	134022	134023	134024	My friends	1582	” “
134026	134030	134023	134024	My friends	1582	” says Chadband , “
134036	134051	134023	134024	My friends	1582	” ( which was certainly not the case so far as he was concerned ) “
134153	134188	134189	134191	My young friend	3394	” Jo , thus apostrophized , gives a slouch backward , and another slouch forward , and another slouch to each side , and confronts the eloquent Chadband with evident doubts of his intentions . “
134193	134197	134189	134191	My young friend	3394	” says Chadband , “
134233	134234	134235	134235	I	0	” “
134240	134244	134235	134235	I	0	” replies Jo . “
134251	134252	134253	134255	My young friend	3394	” “
134257	134261	134253	134255	My young friend	3394	” says Chadband , “
134495	134548	134485	134485	us	3617	” At this threatening stage of the discourse , Jo , who seems to have been gradually going out of his mind , smears his right arm over his face and gives a terrible yawn . Mrs. Snagsby indignantly expresses her belief that he is a limb of the arch - fiend . “
134552	134572	134485	134485	us	3617	” says Mr. Chadband with his persecuted chin folding itself into its fat smile again as he looks round , “
134656	134666	134667	134667	My	0	” Great sensation on the part of Mrs. Snagsby . “
134670	134680	134667	134667	My	0	” says Chadband , looking round him in conclusion , “
134758	135058	135867	135869	Gup - py	476	” ( This with a cow - like lightness . ) Jo , whose immediate object seems to be to get away on any terms , gives a shuffling nod . Mr. Guppy then throws him a penny , and Mrs. Snagsby calls to Guster to see him safely out of the house . But before he goes downstairs , Mr. Snagsby loads him with some broken meats from the table , which he carries away , hugging in his arms . So , Mr. Chadband — of whom the persecutors say that it is no wonder he should go on for any length of time uttering such abominable nonsense , but that the wonder rather is that he should ever leave off , having once the audacity to begin — retires into private life until he invests a little capital of supper in the oil - trade . Jo moves on , through the long vacation , down to Blackfriars Bridge , where he finds a baking stony corner wherein to settle to his repast . And there he sits , munching and gnawing , and looking up at the great cross on the summit of St. Paul ’s Cathedral , glittering above a red - and - violet - tinted cloud of smoke . From the boy ’s face one might suppose that sacred emblem to be , in his eyes , the crowning confusion of the great , confused city — so golden , so high up , so far out of his reach . There he sits , the sun going down , the river running fast , the crowd flowing by him in two streams — everything moving on to some purpose and to one end — until he is stirred up and told to “
135061	135864	135867	135869	Gup - py	476	” too . CHAPTER XX A New Lodger The long vacation saunters on towards term - time like an idle river very leisurely strolling down a flat country to the sea . Mr. Guppy saunters along with it congenially . He has blunted the blade of his penknife and broken the point off by sticking that instrument into his desk in every direction . Not that he bears the desk any ill will , but he must do something , and it must be something of an unexciting nature , which will lay neither his physical nor his intellectual energies under too heavy contribution . He finds that nothing agrees with him so well as to make little gyrations on one leg of his stool , and stab his desk , and gape . Kenge and Carboy are out of town , and the articled clerk has taken out a shooting license and gone down to his father ’s , and Mr. Guppy ’s two fellow - stipendiaries are away on leave . Mr. Guppy and Mr. Richard Carstone divide the dignity of the office . But Mr. Carstone is for the time being established in Kenge ’s room , whereat Mr. Guppy chafes . So exceedingly that he with biting sarcasm informs his mother , in the confidential moments when he sups with her off a lobster and lettuce in the Old Street Road , that he is afraid the office is hardly good enough for swells , and that if he had known there was a swell coming , he would have got it painted . Mr. Guppy suspects everybody who enters on the occupation of a stool in Kenge and Carboy ’s office of entertaining , as a matter of course , sinister designs upon him . He is clear that every such person wants to depose him . If he be ever asked how , why , when , or wherefore , he shuts up one eye and shakes his head . On the strength of these profound views , he in the most ingenious manner takes infinite pains to counterplot when there is no plot , and plays the deepest games of chess without any adversary . It is a source of much gratification to Mr. Guppy , therefore , to find the new - comer constantly poring over the papers in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , for he well knows that nothing but confusion and failure can come of that . His satisfaction communicates itself to a third saunterer through the long vacation in Kenge and Carboy ’s office , to wit , Young Smallweed . Whether Young Smallweed ( metaphorically called Small and eke Chick Weed , as it were jocularly to express a fledgling ) was ever a boy is much doubted in Lincoln ’s Inn . He is now something under fifteen and an old limb of the law . He is facetiously understood to entertain a passion for a lady at a cigar - shop in the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane and for her sake to have broken off a contract with another lady , to whom he had been engaged some years . He is a town - made article , of small stature and weazen features , but may be perceived from a considerable distance by means of his very tall hat . To become a Guppy is the object of his ambition . He dresses at that gentleman ( by whom he is patronized ) , talks at him , walks at him , founds himself entirely on him . He is honoured with Mr. Guppy ’s particular confidence and occasionally advises him , from the deep wells of his experience , on difficult points in private life . Mr. Guppy has been lolling out of window all the morning after trying all the stools in succession and finding none of them easy , and after several times putting his head into the iron safe with a notion of cooling it . Mr. Smallweed has been twice dispatched for effervescent drinks , and has twice mixed them in the two official tumblers and stirred them up with the ruler . Mr. Guppy propounds for Mr. Smallweed ’s consideration the paradox that the more you drink the thirstier you are and reclines his head upon the window - sill in a state of hopeless languor . While thus looking out into the shade of Old Square , Lincoln ’s Inn , surveying the intolerable bricks and mortar , Mr. Guppy becomes conscious of a manly whisker emerging from the cloistered walk below and turning itself up in the direction of his face . At the same time , a low whistle is wafted through the Inn and a suppressed voice cries , “
135871	135872	135867	135869	Gup - py	476	” “
135881	135888	135889	135889	Small	477	” says Mr. Guppy , aroused . “
135895	135909	135889	135889	Small	477	” Small ’s head looks out of window too and nods to Jobling . “
135917	135922	135912	135912	you	3625	” inquires Mr. Guppy . “
135965	135988	135989	135989	I	0	” Jobling looks hungry and also has the appearance of having run to seed in the market - gardens down by Deptford . “
136013	136014	136006	136006	I	0	” “
136023	136039	136016	136016	you	3625	” says Mr. Guppy , throwing out the coin , which Mr. Jobling catches neatly . “
136049	136053	136016	136016	you	3625	” says Jobling . “
136069	136080	136059	136059	I	0	” returns Mr. Guppy , butting inward with his head . “
136084	136085	136086	136088	A new one	3628	” “
136099	136100	136096	136096	you	0	” “
136113	136133	136102	136102	you	0	” says Mr. Jobling . Smallweed suggests the law list . But Mr. Jobling declares with much earnestness that he “
136139	136140	136102	136102	you	0	” “
136147	136152	136141	136141	You	3625	” says Mr. Guppy . “
136182	136236	136242	136242	you	3625	” Jobling nods intelligence and acquiescence . The sagacious Smallweed supplies him with the newspaper and occasionally drops his eye upon him from the landing as a precaution against his becoming disgusted with waiting and making an untimely departure . At last the enemy retreats , and then Smallweed fetches Mr. Jobling up . “
136244	136254	136339	136339	Jobling	478	” says Mr. Guppy , shaking hands with him . “
136263	136283	136261	136261	you	3625	” Mr. Guppy replying that he is not much to boast of , Mr. Jobling ventures on the question , “
136288	136299	136300	136300	Jobling	478	” This Mr. Guppy resents as a liberty , retorting , “
136310	136315	136300	136300	Jobling	478	” Jobling begs pardon . “
136321	136333	136300	136300	Jobling	478	” says Mr. Guppy with a gloomy enjoyment of his injury . “
136341	136375	136339	136339	Jobling	478	” Mr. Jobling begs pardon again . During this short colloquy , the active Smallweed , who is of the dinner party , has written in legal characters on a slip of paper , “
136379	136742	136339	136339	Jobling	478	” This notification to all whom it may concern , he inserts in the letter - box , and then putting on the tall hat at the angle of inclination at which Mr. Guppy wears his , informs his patron that they may now make themselves scarce . Accordingly they betake themselves to a neighbouring dining - house , of the class known among its frequenters by the denomination slap - bang , where the waitress , a bouncing young female of forty , is supposed to have made some impression on the susceptible Smallweed , of whom it may be remarked that he is a weird changeling to whom years are nothing . He stands precociously possessed of centuries of owlish wisdom . If he ever lay in a cradle , it seems as if he must have lain there in a tail - coat . He has an old , old eye , has Smallweed ; and he drinks and smokes in a monkeyish way ; and his neck is stiff in his collar ; and he is never to be taken in ; and he knows all about it , whatever it is . In short , in his bringing up he has been so nursed by Law and Equity that he has become a kind of fossil imp , to account for whose terrestrial existence it is reported at the public offices that his father was John Doe and his mother the only female member of the Roe family , also that his first long - clothes were made from a blue bag . Into the dining - house , unaffected by the seductive show in the window of artificially whitened cauliflowers and poultry , verdant baskets of peas , coolly blooming cucumbers , and joints ready for the spit , Mr. Smallweed leads the way . They know him there and defer to him . He has his favourite box , he bespeaks all the papers , he is down upon bald patriarchs , who keep them more than ten minutes afterwards . It is of no use trying him with anything less than a full - sized “
136744	136812	136818	136818	Chick	481	” or proposing to him any joint in cut unless it is in the very best cut . In the matter of gravy he is adamant . Conscious of his elfin power and submitting to his dread experience , Mr. Guppy consults him in the choice of that day ’s banquet , turning an appealing look towards him as the waitress repeats the catalogue of viands and saying “
136820	136832	136339	136339	Jobling	478	” Chick , out of the profundity of his artfulness , preferring “
136849	137182	136848	136848	Polly	482	” ( with an unearthly cock of his venerable eye ) , Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling give the like order . Three pint pots of half - and - half are superadded . Quickly the waitress returns bearing what is apparently a model of the Tower of Babel but what is really a pile of plates and flat tin dish - covers . Mr. Smallweed , approving of what is set before him , conveys intelligent benignity into his ancient eye and winks upon her . Then , amid a constant coming in , and going out , and running about , and a clatter of crockery , and a rumbling up and down of the machine which brings the nice cuts from the kitchen , and a shrill crying for more nice cuts down the speaking - pipe , and a shrill reckoning of the cost of nice cuts that have been disposed of , and a general flush and steam of hot joints , cut and uncut , and a considerably heated atmosphere in which the soiled knives and tablecloths seem to break out spontaneously into eruptions of grease and blotches of beer , the legal triumvirate appease their appetites . Mr. Jobling is buttoned up closer than mere adornment might require . His hat presents at the rims a peculiar appearance of a glistening nature , as if it had been a favourite snail - promenade . The same phenomenon is visible on some parts of his coat , and particularly at the seams . He has the faded appearance of a gentleman in embarrassed circumstances ; even his light whiskers droop with something of a shabby air . His appetite is so vigorous that it suggests spare living for some little time back . He makes such a speedy end of his plate of veal and ham , bringing it to a close while his companions are yet midway in theirs , that Mr. Guppy proposes another . “
137188	137193	137186	137186	Guppy	297	” says Mr. Jobling , “
137206	137279	137201	137201	I	0	” Another being brought , he falls to with great goodwill . Mr. Guppy takes silent notice of him at intervals until he is half way through this second plate and stops to take an enjoying pull at his pint pot of half - and - half ( also renewed ) and stretches out his legs and rubs his hands . Beholding him in which glow of contentment , Mr. Guppy says , “
137288	137289	137286	137286	Tony	483	” “
137296	137301	137328	137328	Guppy	297	” says Mr. Jobling . “
137307	137308	137328	137328	Guppy	297	” “
137323	137324	137328	137328	Guppy	297	” “
137330	137335	137328	137328	Guppy	297	” says Mr. Jobling . “
137349	137363	137343	137343	I	0	” Order given ; with the sarcastic addition ( from Mr. Smallweed ) of “
137369	137374	137367	137367	Polly	482	” And cabbage produced . “
137382	137397	137380	137380	Guppy	297	” says Mr. Jobling , plying his knife and fork with a relishing steadiness . “
137403	137404	137380	137380	Guppy	297	” “
137416	137466	137408	137408	I	0	” says Mr. Jobling . He says no more until he has performed his task , which he achieves as Messrs. Guppy and Smallweed finish theirs , thus getting over the ground in excellent style and beating those two gentlemen easily by a veal and ham and a cabbage . “
137471	137476	137469	137469	Small	477	” says Mr. Guppy , “
137484	137485	137479	137479	you	477	” “
137489	137495	137479	137479	you	477	” says Mr. Smallweed instantly . “
137500	137509	137479	137479	you	477	” cries Mr. Jobling with an arch look . “
137536	137568	137529	137529	I	0	” Three marrow puddings being produced , Mr. Jobling adds in a pleasant humour that he is coming of age fast . To these succeed , by command of Mr. Smallweed , “
137572	137576	137529	137529	I	0	” and to those “
137581	137620	137621	137621	I	0	” This apex of the entertainment happily reached , Mr. Jobling puts up his legs on the carpeted seat ( having his own side of the box to himself ) , leans against the wall , and says , “
137635	137636	137627	137627	Guppy	297	” “
137644	137649	137639	137639	you	477	” says Mr. Guppy , “
137658	137659	137639	137639	you	477	” “
137677	137678	137667	137667	I	0	” “
137684	137689	137690	137690	I	0	” says Mr. Smallweed . “
137700	137705	137696	137696	you	477	” pursues Mr. Guppy , “
137709	137710	137696	137696	you	477	” “
137720	137725	137714	137714	I	0	” returns Mr. Jobling , “
137776	137796	137797	137799	Ill fo manger	3640	” says Mr. Jobling , pronouncing that word as if he meant a necessary fixture in an English stable . “
137825	137832	137797	137799	Ill fo manger	3640	” Mr. Smallweed is decidedly of opinion “
137837	137838	137797	137799	Ill fo manger	3640	” “
137846	137850	137840	137841	any man	3277	” pursues Jobling , “
137879	137888	137889	137890	Chesney Wold	329	” Mr. Smallweed corrects him — Chesney Wold . “
137940	137960	137933	137933	I	0	” says Mr. Jobling , taking a little rum - and - water with an air of desperate resignation ; “
137970	137971	137961	137961	I	0	” “
137987	137992	137993	137993	You	483	” remonstrates Mr. Guppy . “
138003	138004	138005	138005	Guppy	297	” “
138007	138012	138005	138005	Guppy	297	” says Mr. Jobling , “
138037	138062	138030	138030	I	0	” That very popular trust in flat things coming round ! Not in their being beaten round , or worked round , but in their “
138064	138077	138030	138030	I	0	” round ! As though a lunatic should trust in the world ’s “
138079	138082	138083	138083	I	0	” triangular ! “
138097	138112	138083	138083	I	0	” says Mr. Jobling with some vagueness of expression and perhaps of meaning too . “
138237	138238	138230	138230	You	3654	” “
138241	138246	138230	138230	You	3654	” Mr. Smallweed thinks . “
138273	138278	138265	138265	I	0	” says Mr. Jobling . “
138294	138310	138279	138279	They	3655	” proceeds Mr. Jobling after a defiant visit to his rum - and - water , “
138324	138379	138380	138380	Jobling	478	” Mr. Guppy comes more fully into the conversation to state what , in his opinion , a fellow can do . His manner is the gravely impressive manner of a man who has not committed himself in life otherwise than as he has become the victim of a tender sorrow of the heart . “
138382	138387	138388	138388	myself	0	” says Mr. Guppy , “
138395	138401	138402	138402	Gentlemen	9501	” Mr. Smallweed modestly observes , “
138405	138409	138402	138402	Gentlemen	9501	” and drinks . “
138425	138426	138423	138423	you	478	” “
138433	138439	138443	138443	Guppy	297	” cries Mr. Jobling bitterly . “
138449	138450	138445	138445	You	297	” “
138461	138467	138469	138469	you	478	” Mr. Smallweed delicately suggests . “
138476	138481	138474	138474	Jobling	478	” says Mr. Guppy ; “
138506	138507	138500	138500	You	478	” “
138516	138521	138508	138508	I	0	” returns Mr. Jobling . “
138535	138536	138537	138537	He	362	” “
138550	138555	138544	138544	I	0	” Mr. Guppy retorts . “
138624	138681	138595	138595	They	3668	” As it is Mr. Guppy ’s perplexing way with boastful misery to tempt his particular friends into this subject , and the moment they touch it , to turn on them with that trenchant severity about the chords in the human mind , both Mr. Jobling and Mr. Smallweed decline the pitfall by remaining silent . “
138687	138692	138595	138595	They	3668	” repeats Mr. Guppy , “
138773	138784	138768	138768	he	475	” Mr. Smallweed nods and appears greedy to be sworn . “
138792	138797	138787	138790	gentlemen of the jury	3672	” says Mr. Guppy , “
138863	138884	138861	138861	Snagsby	362	” Mr. Jobling is about to interrupt when the sagacious Smallweed checks him with a dry cough and the words , “
138889	138890	138887	138887	Shakspeare	488	” “
138901	138906	138899	138899	Jobling	478	” says Mr. Guppy . “
138933	138946	138931	138931	Jobling	478	” says Mr. Guppy in his encouraging cross - examination - tone , “
138960	138961	138949	138949	you	478	” “
138968	138973	138962	138962	I	0	” says Mr. Jobling . “
138989	138990	138984	138984	you	478	” “
138995	139000	138991	138991	Everybody	890	” says Mr. Jobling . “
139148	139164	139140	139140	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , who has suddenly lowered his voice and become familiar again , “
139233	139234	139235	139235	You	3681	” “
139240	139245	139235	139235	You	3681	” Mr. Jobling begins . “
139249	139261	139235	139235	You	3681	” returns Mr. Guppy , shrugging his shoulders with becoming modesty , “
139294	139302	139287	139287	I	0	” Mr. Smallweed bears the concise testimony , “
139306	139307	139287	139287	I	0	” “
139322	139327	139320	139320	Tony	483	” says Mr. Guppy , “
139471	139526	139458	139458	you	3691	” Mr. Jobling , Mr. Guppy , and Mr. Smallweed all lean their elbows on the table and their chins upon their hands , and look at the ceiling . After a time , they all drink , slowly lean back , put their hands in their pockets , and look at one another . “
139538	139546	139536	139536	Tony	483	” says Mr. Guppy with a sigh . “
139556	139597	139550	139554	chords in the human mind	3633	” Expressing the remainder of the desolate sentiment in rum - and - water , Mr. Guppy concludes by resigning the adventure to Tony Jobling and informing him that during the vacation and while things are slack , his purse , “
139610	139617	139550	139554	chords in the human mind	3633	” will be at his disposal . “
139625	139632	139550	139554	chords in the human mind	3633	” Mr. Guppy adds with emphasis , “
139643	139663	139664	139664	Guppy	297	” The latter part of the proposal is so directly to the purpose that Mr. Jobling says with emotion , “
139672	139680	139664	139664	Guppy	297	” Mr. Guppy presents it , saying , “
139690	139695	139696	139696	Guppy	297	” Mr. Jobling returns , “
139707	139712	139713	139713	Jobling	478	” Mr. Guppy replies , “
139718	139733	139713	139713	Jobling	478	” They then shake hands , and Mr. Jobling adds in a feeling manner , “
139755	139756	139745	139745	I	0	” “
139764	139773	139775	139775	he	3703	” observes Mr. Guppy in an incidental way . “
139778	139783	139775	139775	he	3703	” says Mr. Jobling . “
139798	139799	139792	139792	You	297	” “
139802	139807	139792	139792	You	297	” says Mr. Jobling , “
139838	139856	139829	139829	he	3703	” Mr. Jobling quite resents this liberty , several times returning to it with such remarks as , “
139869	139872	139865	139865	I	0	” or , “
139888	139982	139884	139884	I	0	” However , the compact being virtually made , Mr. Guppy proposes to dispatch the trusty Smallweed to ascertain if Mr. Krook is at home , as in that case they may complete the negotiation without delay . Mr. Jobling approving , Smallweed puts himself under the tall hat and conveys it out of the dining - rooms in the Guppy manner . He soon returns with the intelligence that Mr. Krook is at home and that he has seen him through the shop - door , sitting in the back premises , sleeping “
139987	139988	139884	139884	I	0	” “
139994	139999	139990	139990	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , “
140015	140037	140008	140008	Small	477	” Mr. Smallweed , compelling the attendance of the waitress with one hitch of his eyelash , instantly replies as follows : “
140131	140324	140125	140125	Polly	482	” Not at all excited by these stupendous calculations , Smallweed dismisses his friends with a cool nod and remains behind to take a little admiring notice of Polly , as opportunity may serve , and to read the daily papers , which are so very large in proportion to himself , shorn of his hat , that when he holds up the Times to run his eye over the columns , he seems to have retired for the night and to have disappeared under the bedclothes . Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling repair to the rag and bottle shop , where they find Krook still sleeping like one o’clock , that is to say , breathing stertorously with his chin upon his breast and quite insensible to any external sounds or even to gentle shaking . On the table beside him , among the usual lumber , stand an empty gin - bottle and a glass . The unwholesome air is so stained with this liquor that even the green eyes of the cat upon her shelf , as they open and shut and glimmer on the visitors , look drunk . “
140329	140345	140125	140125	Polly	482	” says Mr. Guppy , giving the relaxed figure of the old man another shake . “
140353	140375	140351	140351	sir	9496	” But it would seem as easy to wake a bundle of old clothes with a spirituous heat smouldering in it . “
140393	140398	140377	140377	you	3711	” says Mr. Guppy . “
140406	140413	140377	140377	you	3711	” returns Jobling , rather alarmed , “
140429	140430	140425	140425	I	0	” “
140442	140451	140425	140425	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , shaking him again . “
140471	140527	140468	140468	your	9496	” After much ado , he opens them , but without appearing to see his visitors or any other objects . Though he crosses one leg on another , and folds his hands , and several times closes and opens his parched lips , he seems to all intents and purposes as insensible as before . “
140536	140541	140528	140528	He	249	” says Mr. Guppy . “
140567	140610	140550	140550	I	0	” The old man still sits , often smacking his dry lips without the least consciousness . After some minutes he makes an attempt to rise . They help him up , and he staggers against the wall and stares at them . “
140619	140627	140613	140613	you	9496	” says Mr. Guppy in some discomfiture . “
140650	140748	140749	140750	Your servant	2901	” The old man , in aiming a purposeless blow at Mr. Guppy , or at nothing , feebly swings himself round and comes with his face against the wall . So he remains for a minute or two , heaped up against it , and then staggers down the shop to the front door . The air , the movement in the court , the lapse of time , or the combination of these things recovers him . He comes back pretty steadily , adjusting his fur cap on his head and looking keenly at them . “
140770	140771	140761	140761	I	0	” “
140779	140784	140761	140761	I	0	” responds Mr. Guppy . “
140800	140806	140798	140798	you	9496	” says the suspicious Krook . “
140811	140842	140843	140843	I	0	” Mr. Guppy explains . The old man ’s eye resting on the empty bottle , he takes it up , examines it , and slowly tilts it upside down . “
140846	140856	140843	140843	I	0	” he cries like the hobgoblin in the story . “
140864	140865	140857	140857	Somebody	851	” “
140874	140879	140869	140869	we	3721	” says Mr. Guppy . “
140891	140892	140881	140881	you	9496	” “
140899	140906	140908	140908	I	0	” cries Krook in high glee . “
140939	140992	140935	140935	they	3723	” He so presses the empty bottle upon Mr. Guppy that that gentleman , with a nod to his friend , accepts the trust and hurries out and hurries in again with the bottle filled . The old man receives it in his arms like a beloved grandchild and pats it tenderly . “
140998	141012	140995	140995	I	0	” he whispers , with his eyes screwed up , after tasting it , “
141026	141027	141028	141028	I	0	” “
141036	141041	141028	141028	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy . “
141049	141069	141047	141047	sir	9496	” returns Krook with another taste , and his hot breath seems to come towards them like a flame . “
141078	141143	141070	141070	You	0	” Taking advantage of this auspicious moment , Mr. Guppy presents his friend under the impromptu name of Mr. Weevle and states the object of their visit . Krook , with his bottle under his arm ( he never gets beyond a certain point of either drunkenness or sobriety ) , takes time to survey his proposed lodger and seems to approve of him . “
141155	141159	141152	141153	young man	3730	” he says . “
141207	141978	142064	142064	Lord	3734	” Commending the room after this manner , the old man takes them upstairs , where indeed they do find it cleaner than it used to be and also containing some old articles of furniture which he has dug up from his inexhaustible stores . The terms are easily concluded — for the Lord Chancellor can not be hard on Mr. Guppy , associated as he is with Kenge and Carboy , Jarndyce and Jarndyce , and other famous claims on his professional consideration — and it is agreed that Mr. Weevle shall take possession on the morrow . Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy then repair to Cook ’s Court , Cursitor Street , where the personal introduction of the former to Mr. Snagsby is effected and ( more important ) the vote and interest of Mrs. Snagsby are secured . They then report progress to the eminent Smallweed , waiting at the office in his tall hat for that purpose , and separate , Mr. Guppy explaining that he would terminate his little entertainment by standing treat at the play but that there are chords in the human mind which would render it a hollow mockery . On the morrow , in the dusk of evening , Mr. Weevle modestly appears at Krook ’s , by no means incommoded with luggage , and establishes himself in his new lodging , where the two eyes in the shutters stare at him in his sleep , as if they were full of wonder . On the following day Mr. Weevle , who is a handy good - for - nothing kind of young fellow , borrows a needle and thread of Miss Flite and a hammer of his landlord and goes to work devising apologies for window - curtains , and knocking up apologies for shelves , and hanging up his two teacups , milkpot , and crockery sundries on a pennyworth of little hooks , like a shipwrecked sailor making the best of it . But what Mr. Weevle prizes most of all his few possessions ( next after his light whiskers , for which he has an attachment that only whiskers can awaken in the breast of man ) is a choice collection of copper - plate impressions from that truly national work The Divinities of Albion , or Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty , representing ladies of title and fashion in every variety of smirk that art , combined with capital , is capable of producing . With these magnificent portraits , unworthily confined in a band - box during his seclusion among the market - gardens , he decorates his apartment ; and as the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty wears every variety of fancy dress , plays every variety of musical instrument , fondles every variety of dog , ogles every variety of prospect , and is backed up by every variety of flower - pot and balustrade , the result is very imposing . But fashion is Mr. Weevle ’s , as it was Tony Jobling ’s , weakness . To borrow yesterday ’s paper from the Sol ’s Arms of an evening and read about the brilliant and distinguished meteors that are shooting across the fashionable sky in every direction is unspeakable consolation to him . To know what member of what brilliant and distinguished circle accomplished the brilliant and distinguished feat of joining it yesterday or contemplates the no less brilliant and distinguished feat of leaving it to - morrow gives him a thrill of joy . To be informed what the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty is about , and means to be about , and what Galaxy marriages are on the tapis , and what Galaxy rumours are in circulation , is to become acquainted with the most glorious destinies of mankind . Mr. Weevle reverts from this intelligence to the Galaxy portraits implicated , and seems to know the originals , and to be known of them . For the rest he is a quiet lodger , full of handy shifts and devices as before mentioned , able to cook and clean for himself as well as to carpenter , and developing social inclinations after the shades of evening have fallen on the court . At those times , when he is not visited by Mr. Guppy or by a small light in his likeness quenched in a dark hat , he comes out of his dull room — where he has inherited the deal wilderness of desk bespattered with a rain of ink — and talks to Krook or is “
141982	142047	142064	142064	Lord	3734	” as they call it in the court , commendingly , with any one disposed for conversation . Wherefore , Mrs. Piper , who leads the court , is impelled to offer two remarks to Mrs. Perkins : firstly , that if her Johnny was to have whiskers , she could wish ’em to be identically like that young man ’s ; and secondly , “
142082	142606	142069	142071	that young man	12352	” CHAPTER XXI The Smallweed Family In a rather ill - favoured and ill - savoured neighbourhood , though one of its rising grounds bears the name of Mount Pleasant , the Elfin Smallweed , christened Bartholomew and known on the domestic hearth as Bart , passes that limited portion of his time on which the office and its contingencies have no claim . He dwells in a little narrow street , always solitary , shady , and sad , closely bricked in on all sides like a tomb , but where there yet lingers the stump of an old forest tree whose flavour is about as fresh and natural as the Smallweed smack of youth . There has been only one child in the Smallweed family for several generations . Little old men and women there have been , but no child , until Mr. Smallweed ’s grandmother , now living , became weak in her intellect and fell ( for the first time ) into a childish state . With such infantine graces as a total want of observation , memory , understanding , and interest , and an eternal disposition to fall asleep over the fire and into it , Mr. Smallweed ’s grandmother has undoubtedly brightened the family . Mr. Smallweed ’s grandfather is likewise of the party . He is in a helpless condition as to his lower , and nearly so as to his upper , limbs , but his mind is unimpaired . It holds , as well as it ever held , the first four rules of arithmetic and a certain small collection of the hardest facts . In respect of ideality , reverence , wonder , and other such phrenological attributes , it is no worse off than it used to be . Everything that Mr. Smallweed ’s grandfather ever put away in his mind was a grub at first , and is a grub at last . In all his life he has never bred a single butterfly . The father of this pleasant grandfather , of the neighbourhood of Mount Pleasant , was a horny - skinned , two - legged , money - getting species of spider who spun webs to catch unwary flies and retired into holes until they were entrapped . The name of this old pagan ’s god was Compound Interest . He lived for it , married it , died of it . Meeting with a heavy loss in an honest little enterprise in which all the loss was intended to have been on the other side , he broke something — something necessary to his existence , therefore it could n’t have been his heart — and made an end of his career . As his character was not good , and he had been bred at a charity school in a complete course , according to question and answer , of those ancient people the Amorites and Hittites , he was frequently quoted as an example of the failure of education . His spirit shone through his son , to whom he had always preached of “
142609	143042	142064	142064	Lord	3734	” early in life and whom he made a clerk in a sharp scrivener ’s office at twelve years old . There the young gentleman improved his mind , which was of a lean and anxious character , and developing the family gifts , gradually elevated himself into the discounting profession . Going out early in life and marrying late , as his father had done before him , he too begat a lean and anxious - minded son , who in his turn , going out early in life and marrying late , became the father of Bartholomew and Judith Smallweed , twins . During the whole time consumed in the slow growth of this family tree , the house of Smallweed , always early to go out and late to marry , has strengthened itself in its practical character , has discarded all amusements , discountenanced all story - books , fairy - tales , fictions , and fables , and banished all levities whatsoever . Hence the gratifying fact that it has had no child born to it and that the complete little men and women whom it has produced have been observed to bear a likeness to old monkeys with something depressing on their minds . At the present time , in the dark little parlour certain feet below the level of the street — a grim , hard , uncouth parlour , only ornamented with the coarsest of baize table - covers , and the hardest of sheet - iron tea - trays , and offering in its decorative character no bad allegorical representation of Grandfather Smallweed ’s mind — seated in two black horsehair porter ’s chairs , one on each side of the fire - place , the superannuated Mr. and Mrs. Smallweed while away the rosy hours . On the stove are a couple of trivets for the pots and kettles which it is Grandfather Smallweed ’s usual occupation to watch , and projecting from the chimney - piece between them is a sort of brass gallows for roasting , which he also superintends when it is in action . Under the venerable Mr. Smallweed ’s seat and guarded by his spindle legs is a drawer in his chair , reported to contain property to a fabulous amount . Beside him is a spare cushion with which he is always provided in order that he may have something to throw at the venerable partner of his respected age whenever she makes an allusion to money — a subject on which he is particularly sensitive . “
143048	143060	143061	143061	He	491	” Grandfather Smallweed inquires of Judy , Bart ’s twin sister . “
143067	143071	143061	143061	He	491	” says Judy . “
143083	143084	143061	143061	He	491	” “
143087	143088	143061	143061	He	491	” “
143100	143101	143092	143092	you	3736	” “
143105	143106	143092	143092	you	3736	” “
143109	143110	143092	143092	you	3736	” “
143114	143124	143092	143092	you	3736	” ( Loud on the part of Judy . ) “
143127	143132	143092	143092	you	3736	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
143136	143171	143092	143092	you	3736	” Grandmother Smallweed , who has been mumbling and shaking her head at the trivets , hearing figures mentioned , connects them with money and screeches like a horrible old parrot without any plumage , “
143178	143188	143190	143190	you	3736	” Grandfather Smallweed immediately throws the cushion at her . “
143195	143827	143828	143828	Charley	336	” says the good old man . The effect of this act of jaculation is twofold . It not only doubles up Mrs. Smallweed ’s head against the side of her porter ’s chair and causes her to present , when extricated by her granddaughter , a highly unbecoming state of cap , but the necessary exertion recoils on Mr. Smallweed himself , whom it throws back into HIS porter ’s chair like a broken puppet . The excellent old gentleman being at these times a mere clothes - bag with a black skull - cap on the top of it , does not present a very animated appearance until he has undergone the two operations at the hands of his granddaughter of being shaken up like a great bottle and poked and punched like a great bolster . Some indication of a neck being developed in him by these means , he and the sharer of his life ’s evening again sit fronting one another in their two porter ’s chairs , like a couple of sentinels long forgotten on their post by the Black Serjeant , Death . Judy the twin is worthy company for these associates . She is so indubitably sister to Mr. Smallweed the younger that the two kneaded into one would hardly make a young person of average proportions , while she so happily exemplifies the before - mentioned family likeness to the monkey tribe that attired in a spangled robe and cap she might walk about the table - land on the top of a barrel - organ without exciting much remark as an unusual specimen . Under existing circumstances , however , she is dressed in a plain , spare gown of brown stuff . Judy never owned a doll , never heard of Cinderella , never played at any game . She once or twice fell into children ’s company when she was about ten years old , but the children could n’t get on with Judy , and Judy could n’t get on with them . She seemed like an animal of another species , and there was instinctive repugnance on both sides . It is very doubtful whether Judy knows how to laugh . She has so rarely seen the thing done that the probabilities are strong the other way . Of anything like a youthful laugh , she certainly can have no conception . If she were to try one , she would find her teeth in her way , modelling that action of her face , as she has unconsciously modelled all its other expressions , on her pattern of sordid age . Such is Judy . And her twin brother could n’t wind up a top for his life . He knows no more of Jack the Giant Killer or of Sinbad the Sailor than he knows of the people in the stars . He could as soon play at leap - frog or at cricket as change into a cricket or a frog himself . But he is so much the better off than his sister that on his narrow world of fact an opening has dawned into such broader regions as lie within the ken of Mr. Guppy . Hence his admiration and his emulation of that shining enchanter . Judy , with a gong - like clash and clatter , sets one of the sheet - iron tea - trays on the table and arranges cups and saucers . The bread she puts on in an iron basket , and the butter ( and not much of it ) in a small pewter plate . Grandfather Smallweed looks hard after the tea as it is served out and asks Judy where the girl is . “
143834	143838	143831	143831	you	336	” says Judy . “
143841	143846	143847	143847	Charley	336	” from Grandfather Smallweed . “
143853	143873	143850	143850	you	336	” This touches a spring in Grandmother Smallweed , who , chuckling as usual at the trivets , cries , “
143905	143927	143894	143894	Charley	336	” and becomes quite energetic about it . Grandfather looks at the cushion but has not sufficiently recovered his late exertion . “
143930	143938	143894	143894	Charley	336	” he says when there is silence . “
143961	143984	143894	143894	Charley	336	” Judy , with her brother ’s wink , shakes her head and purses up her mouth into no without saying it . “
143987	143993	143894	143894	Charley	336	” returns the old man . “
143997	143998	143894	143894	Charley	336	” “
144014	144018	143999	143999	She	3741	” says Judy . “
144021	144052	144053	144053	You	336	” Judy answers with a nod of deepest meaning and calls , as she scrapes the butter on the loaf with every precaution against waste and cuts it into slices , “
144061	144102	144059	144059	you	336	” Timidly obedient to the summons , a little girl in a rough apron and a large bonnet , with her hands covered with soap and water and a scrubbing brush in one of them , appears , and curtsys . “
144110	144127	144106	144106	you	336	” says Judy , making an ancient snap at her like a very sharp old beldame . “
144140	144144	144128	144128	I	0	” replies Charley . “
144169	144179	144180	144180	You	9584	” cries Judy with a stamp upon the ground . “
144193	144243	144248	144248	Bart	491	” On this severe matron , as she returns to her task of scraping the butter and cutting the bread , falls the shadow of her brother , looking in at the window . For whom , knife and loaf in hand , she opens the street - door . “
144250	144255	144248	144248	Bart	491	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
144262	144263	144260	144260	hey	3746	” “
144268	144272	144265	144265	I	0	” says Bart . “
144282	144286	144287	144287	Dining	498	” Small nods . “
144294	144299	144292	144292	Bart	491	” Small nods again . “
144340	144427	144334	144334	you	9584	” says the venerable sage . His grandson , without receiving this good counsel as dutifully as he might , honours it with all such acceptance as may lie in a slight wink and a nod and takes a chair at the tea - table . The four old faces then hover over teacups like a company of ghastly cherubim , Mrs. Smallweed perpetually twitching her head and chattering at the trivets and Mr. Smallweed requiring to be repeatedly shaken up like a large black draught . “
144432	144446	144334	144334	you	9584	” says the good old gentleman , reverting to his lesson of wisdom . “
144478	144503	144472	144472	He	3749	” Whether it is intended to be conveyed that he was particularly pleasant to look at , on that account , does not appear . “
144510	144525	144472	144472	He	3749	” repeats the old gentleman , folding his bread and butter on his knee , “
144536	144548	144504	144504	He	3749	” Mrs. Smallweed , following her usual instinct , breaks out with “
144575	144822	144843	144843	you	3754	” Her worthy husband , setting aside his bread and butter , immediately discharges the cushion at her , crushes her against the side of her chair , and falls back in his own , overpowered . His appearance , after visiting Mrs. Smallweed with one of these admonitions , is particularly impressive and not wholly prepossessing , firstly because the exertion generally twists his black skull - cap over one eye and gives him an air of goblin rakishness , secondly because he mutters violent imprecations against Mrs. Smallweed , and thirdly because the contrast between those powerful expressions and his powerless figure is suggestive of a baleful old malignant who would be very wicked if he could . All this , however , is so common in the Smallweed family circle that it produces no impression . The old gentleman is merely shaken and has his internal feathers beaten up , the cushion is restored to its usual place beside him , and the old lady , perhaps with her cap adjusted and perhaps not , is planted in her chair again , ready to be bowled down like a ninepin . Some time elapses in the present instance before the old gentleman is sufficiently cool to resume his discourse , and even then he mixes it up with several edifying expletives addressed to the unconscious partner of his bosom , who holds communication with nothing on earth but the trivets . As thus : “
144982	145067	144975	144975	You	3754	” Judy , not interested in what she has often heard , begins to collect in a basin various tributary streams of tea , from the bottoms of cups and saucers and from the bottom of the tea - pot for the little charwoman ’s evening meal . In like manner she gets together , in the iron bread - basket , as many outside fragments and worn - down heels of loaves as the rigid economy of the house has left in existence . “
145078	145084	145076	145076	Bart	491	” says the old gentleman , “
145170	145255	145153	145153	Judy	493	” One might infer from Judy ’s appearance that her business rather lay with the thorns than the flowers , but she has in her time been apprenticed to the art and mystery of artificial flower - making . A close observer might perhaps detect both in her eye and her brother ’s , when their venerable grandsire anticipates his being gone , some little impatience to know when he may be going , and some resentful opinion that it is time he went . “
145263	145271	145153	145153	Judy	493	” says Judy , completing her preparations , “
145297	145392	145288	145288	she	2502	” Charley is accordingly introduced , and under a heavy fire of eyes , sits down to her basin and a Druidical ruin of bread and butter . In the active superintendence of this young person , Judy Smallweed appears to attain a perfectly geological age and to date from the remotest periods . Her systematic manner of flying at her and pouncing on her , with or without pretence , whether or no , is wonderful , evincing an accomplishment in the art of girl - driving seldom reached by the oldest practitioners . “
145404	145432	145288	145288	she	2502	” cries Judy , shaking her head and stamping her foot as she happens to catch the glance which has been previously sounding the basin of tea , “
145444	145445	145448	145448	miss	9584	” “
145450	145454	145448	145448	miss	9584	” says Charley . “
145460	145465	145448	145448	miss	9584	” returns Miss Smallweed , “
145489	145517	145519	145520	you girls	3745	” Charley swallows a great gulp of tea in token of submission and so disperses the Druidical ruins that Miss Smallweed charges her not to gormandize , which “
145522	145553	145519	145520	you girls	3745	” she observes , is disgusting . Charley might find some more difficulty in meeting her views on the general subject of girls but for a knock at the door . “
145568	145628	145564	145564	you	3768	” cries Judy . The object of her attentions withdrawing for the purpose , Miss Smallweed takes that opportunity of jumbling the remainder of the bread and butter together and launching two or three dirty tea - cups into the ebb - tide of the basin of tea as a hint that she considers the eating and drinking terminated . “
145640	145666	145564	145564	you	3768	” says the snappish Judy . It is one Mr. George , it appears . Without other announcement or ceremony , Mr. George walks in . “
145669	145674	145564	145564	you	3768	” says Mr. George . “
145698	145714	145715	145715	Ho	501	” Mr. George makes the latter remark to himself as he nods to Grandfather Smallweed . “
145721	145727	145719	145719	you	3768	” cries the old gentleman . “
145736	145737	145766	145766	miss	9584	” “
145740	145749	145766	145766	miss	9584	” replies Mr. George , taking a chair . “
145768	145769	145766	145766	miss	9584	” “
145775	145780	145772	145773	my grandson	3774	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
145798	145799	145800	145800	My	0	” “
145827	145845	145820	145820	He	3774	” says Mr. George , laying a great and not altogether complimentary stress on his last adjective . “
145857	145867	145854	145855	Mr. George	500	” Grandfather Smallweed inquires , slowly rubbing his legs . “
145877	146186	145854	145855	Mr. George	500	” He is a swarthy brown man of fifty , well made , and good looking , with crisp dark hair , bright eyes , and a broad chest . His sinewy and powerful hands , as sunburnt as his face , have evidently been used to a pretty rough life . What is curious about him is that he sits forward on his chair as if he were , from long habit , allowing space for some dress or accoutrements that he has altogether laid aside . His step too is measured and heavy and would go well with a weighty clash and jingle of spurs . He is close - shaved now , but his mouth is set as if his upper lip had been for years familiar with a great moustache ; and his manner of occasionally laying the open palm of his broad brown hand upon it is to the same effect . Altogether one might guess Mr. George to have been a trooper once upon a time . A special contrast Mr. George makes to the Smallweed family . Trooper was never yet billeted upon a household more unlike him . It is a broadsword to an oyster - knife . His developed figure and their stunted forms , his large manner filling any amount of room and their little narrow pinched ways , his sounding voice and their sharp spare tones , are in the strongest and the strangest opposition . As he sits in the middle of the grim parlour , leaning a little forward , with his hands upon his thighs and his elbows squared , he looks as though , if he remained there long , he would absorb into himself the whole family and the whole four - roomed house , extra little back - kitchen and all . “
146198	146210	146188	146188	you	3780	” he asks of Grandfather Smallweed after looking round the room . “
146232	146236	145854	145855	Mr. George	500	” he replies . “
146246	146265	145854	145855	Mr. George	500	” repeats Mr. George , folding his arms upon his chest and seeming to become two sizes larger . “
146275	146276	145854	145855	Mr. George	500	” “
146285	146290	146282	146283	Mr. George	500	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
146304	146310	146298	146298	I	0	” nodding at his wife , “
146323	146333	146317	146317	You	500	” with a sudden revival of his late hostility . “
146338	146350	146354	146356	the old lady	9711	” says Mr. George , turning his head in that direction . “
146401	146415	146398	146399	Mr. Smallweed	475	” says Mr. George , coming back to his seat from assisting her , “
146422	146423	146398	146399	Mr. Smallweed	475	” “
146435	146457	146432	146433	Mr. George	500	” the old man hints with a leer . The colour of Mr. George ’s face rather deepens as he replies , “
146465	146466	146461	146461	I	0	” “
146473	146474	146467	146467	I	0	” “
146527	146528	146504	146507	a thundering bad son	3791	” “
146531	146537	146504	146507	a thundering bad son	3791	” cries the old man . “
146540	146545	146504	146507	a thundering bad son	3791	” Mr. George resumes , “
146630	146806	146823	146823	Judy	493	” Mr. George sits , with his arms folded , consuming the family and the parlour while Grandfather Smallweed is assisted by Judy to two black leathern cases out of a locked bureau , in one of which he secures the document he has just received , and from the other takes another similar document which he hands to Mr. George , who twists it up for a pipelight . As the old man inspects , through his glasses , every up - stroke and down - stroke of both documents before he releases them from their leathern prison , and as he counts the money three times over and requires Judy to say every word she utters at least twice , and is as tremulously slow of speech and action as it is possible to be , this business is a long time in progress . When it is quite concluded , and not before , he disengages his ravenous eyes and fingers from it and answers Mr. George ’s last remark by saying , “
146844	146900	146823	146823	Judy	493	” The sportive twins , who have been looking straight before them all this time except when they have been engrossed by the black leathern cases , retire together , generally disdainful of the visitor , but leaving him to the old man as two young cubs might leave a traveller to the parental bear . “
146916	146924	146903	146903	you	3796	” says Mr. George with folded arms . “
146931	146937	146903	146903	you	3796	” the old man nods . “
146947	146948	146949	146949	I	0	” “
146961	146962	146949	146949	I	0	” “
146968	146976	146949	146949	I	0	” says Mr. George with great expression . “
146985	146986	146949	146949	I	0	” “
146996	147008	146949	146949	I	0	” The old man shakes his head with sharp sly triumph . “
147037	147038	146949	146949	I	0	” “
147050	147079	147080	147080	I	0	” says the visitor in a key too low for the old man ’s dull hearing as he looks from him to the old woman and back again . “
147083	147089	147080	147080	I	0	” in a louder voice . “
147094	147095	147092	147092	you	3796	” “
147115	147116	147117	147119	My dear friend	3800	” “
147121	147134	147117	147119	My dear friend	3800	” cries Grandfather Smallweed , stretching out both hands to embrace him . “
147161	147162	147144	147145	my friend	9883	” “
147172	147187	147165	147165	You	3796	” says Mr. George , finishing the inquiry in his lower key with the words “
147193	147194	147188	147188	You	3796	” “
147223	147224	147213	147213	He	9883	” “
147229	147264	147225	147225	Devil	504	” says Mr. George . Charley appearing with a tray , on which are the pipe , a small paper of tobacco , and the brandy - and - water , he asks her , “
147279	147280	147271	147271	You	3800	” “
147289	147326	147281	147281	I	0	” returns Charley . The trooper ( if trooper he be or have been ) takes her bonnet off , with a light touch for so strong a hand , and pats her on the head . “
147350	147383	147387	147387	he	3809	” Then he dismisses her , lights his pipe , and drinks to Mr. Smallweed ’s friend in the city — the one solitary flight of that esteemed old gentleman ’s imagination . “
147396	147397	147385	147385	you	3800	” “
147416	147422	147412	147412	him	3809	” says Grandfather Smallweed incautiously , “
147426	147452	147412	147412	him	3809	” Incautiously , because his stricken better - half , who has been dozing over the fire for some time , is instantly aroused and jabbers “
147479	147518	147519	147519	You	3800	” and is then cut short by the flying cushion , which the visitor , to whom this singular experiment appears to be a novelty , snatches from her face as it crushes her in the usual manner . “
147553	147564	147565	147565	My	0	” gasps the old man , prostrate in his chair . “
147577	147705	147570	147570	you	3800	” Mr. George , who has been looking first at one of them and then at the other , as if he were demented , takes his venerable acquaintance by the throat on receiving this request , and dragging him upright in his chair as easily as if he were a doll , appears in two minds whether or no to shake all future power of cushioning out of him and shake him into his grave . Resisting the temptation , but agitating him violently enough to make his head roll like a harlequin ’s , he puts him smartly down in his chair again and adjusts his skull - cap with such a rub that the old man winks with both eyes for a minute afterwards . “
147709	147714	147570	147570	you	3800	” gasps Mr. Smallweed . “
147744	147795	147741	147742	O Lord	3815	” And Mr. Smallweed says it not without evident apprehensions of his dear friend , who still stands over him looming larger than ever . The alarming presence , however , gradually subsides into its chair and falls to smoking in long puffs , consoling itself with the philosophical reflection , “
147820	147821	147812	147812	you	3813	” “
147829	147914	147823	147823	you	3813	” inquires the old man . The trooper shakes his head , and leaning forward with his right elbow on his right knee and his pipe supported in that hand , while his other hand , resting on his left leg , squares his left elbow in a martial manner , continues to smoke . Meanwhile he looks at Mr. Smallweed with grave attention and now and then fans the cloud of smoke away in order that he may see him the more clearly . “
147919	147952	147823	147823	you	3813	” he says , making just as much and as little change in his position as will enable him to reach the glass to his lips with a round , full action , “
147976	147977	147954	147954	I	0	” “
147980	147986	147954	147954	I	0	” returns the old man , “
148029	148030	148016	148016	you	500	” “
148067	148068	148071	148071	You	500	” “
148079	148088	148071	148071	You	500	” cries Grandfather Smallweed , rubbing his legs . “
148095	148098	148091	148091	I	0	” Puff . “
148115	148118	148108	148108	I	0	” Puff . “
148128	148131	148125	148125	I	0	” Puff . “
148140	148148	148132	148132	I	0	” says Mr. George , composedly smoking . “
148156	148157	148149	148149	I	0	” “
148172	148179	148167	148167	You	0	” Mr. George laughs and drinks . “
148187	148198	148167	148167	You	0	” asks Grandfather Smallweed with a twinkle in his eyes , “
148255	148265	148252	148253	Mr. George	500	” Mr. George , still composedly smoking , replies , “
148356	148357	148362	148363	Mr. George	500	” “
148365	148370	148362	148363	Mr. George	500	” hints Grandfather Smallweed . “
148378	148391	148362	148363	Mr. George	500	” says Mr. George , shaking his head and still composedly smoking . “
148401	148473	148397	148397	my	0	” Grandfather Smallweed has been gradually sliding down in his chair since his last adjustment and is now a bundle of clothes with a voice in it calling for Judy . That houri , appearing , shakes him up in the usual manner and is charged by the old gentleman to remain near him . For he seems chary of putting his visitor to the trouble of repeating his late attentions . “
148476	148486	148397	148397	my	0	” he observes when he is in trim again . “
148598	148599	148596	148596	you	500	” “
148615	148667	148600	148600	I	0	” says Mr. George , smoking not quite so placidly as before , for since the entrance of Judy he has been in some measure disturbed by a fascination , not of the admiring kind , which obliges him to look at her as she stands by her grandfather ’s chair , “
148681	148682	148676	148676	I	0	” “
148698	148725	148730	148730	comrade	3818	” says Grandfather Smallweed with a plain appearance of exasperation . ( Brimstone apparently suggested by his eye lighting on Mrs. Smallweed in her slumber . ) “
148732	148733	148730	148730	comrade	3818	” “
148748	148749	148730	148730	comrade	3818	” “
148757	148765	148769	148769	you	3818	” suggests Mr. George , composedly drinking . “
148776	148777	148815	148815	you	3818	” “
148783	148814	148815	148815	you	3818	” returns Mr. George , but still looking at Judy as if she being so old and so like her grandfather it is indifferent which of the two he addresses , “
148855	148856	148827	148828	Captain Hawdon	508	” “
148859	148868	148827	148828	Captain Hawdon	508	” returns the old man shrilly and sharply . “
148871	148879	148827	148828	Captain Hawdon	508	” says Mr. George , smoking on . “
148905	148906	148909	148909	you	0	” “
148963	148976	148956	148956	I	0	” snarls the old man , holding up his impotent ten fingers , “
148984	149014	148981	148981	him	507	” And in a sudden access of fury , he throws the cushion at the unoffending Mrs. Smallweed , but it passes harmlessly on one side of her chair . “
149023	149059	149015	149015	I	0	” returns the trooper , taking his pipe from his lips for a moment and carrying his eyes back from following the progress of the cushion to the pipe - bowl which is burning low , “
149133	149134	149125	149125	he	507	” “
149143	149150	149137	149137	he	507	” says the benevolent old man , “
149164	149165	149137	149137	he	507	” “
149174	149180	149137	149137	he	507	” returns the trooper coolly ; “
149230	149231	149232	149232	I	0	” “
149240	149246	149232	149232	I	0	” snarls the old man . “
149280	149281	149276	149276	He	507	” “
149290	149291	149292	149292	He	507	” “

149321	149335	149313	149313	your	0	” says Mr. George , calmly knocking the ashes out of his pipe . “
149385	149404	149382	149383	Mr. Smallweed	475	” he adds after breaking off to whistle one , accompanied on the table with the empty pipe . “
149407	149413	149382	149383	Mr. Smallweed	475	” replied the old man . “
149422	149423	149416	149416	We	3857	” “
149488	149489	149485	149486	Mr. Smallweed	475	” “
149494	149504	149485	149486	Mr. Smallweed	475	” the old man gives him both his hands . “
149525	149538	149546	149546	he	2692	” says the trooper , looking down upon him like a giant . “
149549	149600	149546	149546	he	2692	” returns the old man , looking up at him like a pygmy . Mr. George laughs , and with a glance at Mr. Smallweed and a parting salutation to the scornful Judy , strides out of the parlour , clashing imaginary sabres and other metallic appurtenances as he goes . “
149607	149625	149601	149601	You	3800	” says the old gentleman , making a hideous grimace at the door as he shuts it . “
149640	150189	150190	150190	Phil	509	” After this amiable remark , his spirit soars into those enchanting regions of reflection which its education and pursuits have opened to it , and again he and Mrs. Smallweed while away the rosy hours , two unrelieved sentinels forgotten as aforesaid by the Black Serjeant . While the twain are faithful to their post , Mr. George strides through the streets with a massive kind of swagger and a grave - enough face . It is eight o’clock now , and the day is fast drawing in . He stops hard by Waterloo Bridge and reads a playbill , decides to go to Astley ’s Theatre . Being there , is much delighted with the horses and the feats of strength ; looks at the weapons with a critical eye ; disapproves of the combats as giving evidences of unskilful swordsmanship ; but is touched home by the sentiments . In the last scene , when the Emperor of Tartary gets up into a cart and condescends to bless the united lovers by hovering over them with the Union Jack , his eyelashes are moistened with emotion . The theatre over , Mr. George comes across the water again and makes his way to that curious region lying about the Haymarket and Leicester Square which is a centre of attraction to indifferent foreign hotels and indifferent foreigners , racket - courts , fighting - men , swordsmen , footguards , old china , gaming - houses , exhibitions , and a large medley of shabbiness and shrinking out of sight . Penetrating to the heart of this region , he arrives by a court and a long whitewashed passage at a great brick building composed of bare walls , floors , roof - rafters , and skylights , on the front of which , if it can be said to have any front , is painted GEORGE ’S SHOOTING GALLERY , & amp;c . Into George ’s Shooting Gallery , & amp;c . , he goes ; and in it there are gaslights ( partly turned off now ) , and two whitened targets for rifle - shooting , and archery accommodation , and fencing appliances , and all necessaries for the British art of boxing . None of these sports or exercises being pursued in George ’s Shooting Gallery to - night , which is so devoid of company that a little grotesque man with a large head has it all to himself and lies asleep upon the floor . The little man is dressed something like a gunsmith , in a green - baize apron and cap ; and his face and hands are dirty with gunpowder and begrimed with the loading of guns . As he lies in the light before a glaring white target , the black upon him shines again . Not far off is the strong , rough , primitive table with a vice upon it at which he has been working . He is a little man with a face all crushed together , who appears , from a certain blue and speckled appearance that one of his cheeks presents , to have been blown up , in the way of business , at some odd time or times . “
150192	150201	150190	150190	Phil	509	” says the trooper in a quiet voice . “
150205	150214	150190	150190	Phil	509	” cries Phil , scrambling to his feet . “
150219	150220	150190	150190	Phil	509	” “
150228	150232	150190	150190	Phil	509	” says Phil . “
150245	150254	150259	150259	Phil	509	” Phil gives a howl at the recollection . “
150261	150426	150427	150427	Phil	509	” As Phil moves about to execute this order , it appears that he is lame , though able to move very quickly . On the speckled side of his face he has no eyebrow , and on the other side he has a bushy black one , which want of uniformity gives him a very singular and rather sinister appearance . Everything seems to have happened to his hands that could possibly take place consistently with the retention of all the fingers , for they are notched , and seamed , and crumpled all over . He appears to be very strong and lifts heavy benches about as if he had no idea what weight was . He has a curious way of limping round the gallery with his shoulder against the wall and tacking off at objects he wants to lay hold of instead of going straight to them , which has left a smear all round the four walls , conventionally called “
150431	150504	150505	150505	Phil	509	” This custodian of George ’s Gallery in George ’s absence concludes his proceedings , when he has locked the great doors and turned out all the lights but one , which he leaves to glimmer , by dragging out from a wooden cabin in a corner two mattresses and bedding . These being drawn to opposite ends of the gallery , the trooper makes his own bed and Phil makes his . “
150507	150531	150505	150505	Phil	509	” says the master , walking towards him without his coat and waistcoat , and looking more soldierly than ever in his braces . “
150543	150544	150545	150545	Gutter	510	” “
150547	150551	150552	150552	Watchman	3868	” says Phil . “
150557	150558	150552	150552	Watchman	3868	” “
150569	150570	150564	150564	YOU	509	” “
150576	150580	150564	150564	YOU	509	” says Phil . “
150584	150585	150589	150589	guv’ner	511	” “
150591	151318	150589	150589	guv’ner	511	” Phil can not even go straight to bed , but finds it necessary to shoulder round two sides of the gallery and then tack off at his mattress . The trooper , after taking a turn or two in the rifle - distance and looking up at the moon now shining through the skylights , strides to his own mattress by a shorter route and goes to bed too . CHAPTER XXII Mr. Bucket Allegory looks pretty cool in Lincoln ’s Inn Fields , though the evening is hot , for both Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s windows are wide open , and the room is lofty , gusty , and gloomy . These may not be desirable characteristics when November comes with fog and sleet or January with ice and snow , but they have their merits in the sultry long vacation weather . They enable Allegory , though it has cheeks like peaches , and knees like bunches of blossoms , and rosy swellings for calves to its legs and muscles to its arms , to look tolerably cool to - night . Plenty of dust comes in at Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s windows , and plenty more has generated among his furniture and papers . It lies thick everywhere . When a breeze from the country that has lost its way takes fright and makes a blind hurry to rush out again , it flings as much dust in the eyes of Allegory as the law — or Mr. Tulkinghorn , one of its trustiest representatives — may scatter , on occasion , in the eyes of the laity . In his lowering magazine of dust , the universal article into which his papers and himself , and all his clients , and all things of earth , animate and inanimate , are resolving , Mr. Tulkinghorn sits at one of the open windows enjoying a bottle of old port . Though a hard - grained man , close , dry , and silent , he can enjoy old wine with the best . He has a priceless bin of port in some artful cellar under the Fields , which is one of his many secrets . When he dines alone in chambers , as he has dined to - day , and has his bit of fish and his steak or chicken brought in from the coffee - house , he descends with a candle to the echoing regions below the deserted mansion , and heralded by a remote reverberation of thundering doors , comes gravely back encircled by an earthy atmosphere and carrying a bottle from which he pours a radiant nectar , two score and ten years old , that blushes in the glass to find itself so famous and fills the whole room with the fragrance of southern grapes . Mr. Tulkinghorn , sitting in the twilight by the open window , enjoys his wine . As if it whispered to him of its fifty years of silence and seclusion , it shuts him up the closer . More impenetrable than ever , he sits , and drinks , and mellows as it were in secrecy , pondering at that twilight hour on all the mysteries he knows , associated with darkening woods in the country , and vast blank shut - up houses in town , and perhaps sparing a thought or two for himself , and his family history , and his money , and his will — all a mystery to every one — and that one bachelor friend of his , a man of the same mould and a lawyer too , who lived the same kind of life until he was seventy - five years old , and then suddenly conceiving ( as it is supposed ) an impression that it was too monotonous , gave his gold watch to his hair - dresser one summer evening and walked leisurely home to the Temple and hanged himself . But Mr. Tulkinghorn is not alone to - night to ponder at his usual length . Seated at the same table , though with his chair modestly and uncomfortably drawn a little way from it , sits a bald , mild , shining man who coughs respectfully behind his hand when the lawyer bids him fill his glass . “
151323	151328	151321	151321	Snagsby	362	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “
151337	151338	151340	151340	you	362	” “
151345	151346	151347	151347	You	362	” “
151363	151364	151351	151351	you	362	” “
151413	151450	151451	151451	I	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn is not the man to help him to any conclusion or to admit anything as to any possibility concerning himself . So Mr. Snagsby trails off into saying , with an awkward cough , “
151466	151467	151460	151460	sir	9496	” “
151472	151477	151478	151478	You	362	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
151523	151524	151535	151535	you	9496	” “
151529	151534	151535	151535	you	9496	” returns Mr. Snagsby , “
151623	151637	151621	151621	sir	9496	” Mr. Snagsby drinks and murmurs with an admiring cough behind his hand , “
151646	151647	151621	151621	sir	9496	” “
151658	151663	151649	151649	you	9496	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
151670	151671	151649	151649	you	9496	” “
151789	151794	151768	151770	My little woman	2319	” Mr. Tulkinghorn assents . “
151801	151802	151768	151770	My little woman	2319	” “
151812	151822	151806	151806	sir	9496	” returns the stationer with his cough of deference . “
151831	151832	151829	151829	sir	9496	” “
151840	151845	151829	151829	sir	9496	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
151852	151853	151858	151858	sir	9496	” “
151881	151908	151918	151919	the boy	9980	” After rendering this general tribute to the port , Mr. Snagsby in his modesty coughs an apology behind his hand for drinking anything so precious . “
151922	151945	151910	151910	you	9496	” asks Mr. Tulkinghorn , putting his hands into the pockets of his rusty smallclothes and leaning quietly back in his chair . “
151951	151998	151910	151910	you	9496	” Then , with fidelity , though with some prolixity , the law - stationer repeats Jo ’s statement made to the assembled guests at his house . On coming to the end of his narrative , he gives a great start and breaks off with , “
152015	152189	152004	152004	I	0	” Mr. Snagsby is dismayed to see , standing with an attentive face between himself and the lawyer at a little distance from the table , a person with a hat and stick in his hand who was not there when he himself came in and has not since entered by the door or by either of the windows . There is a press in the room , but its hinges have not creaked , nor has a step been audible upon the floor . Yet this third person stands there with his attentive face , and his hat and stick in his hands , and his hands behind him , a composed and quiet listener . He is a stoutly built , steady - looking , sharp - eyed man in black , of about the middle - age . Except that he looks at Mr. Snagsby as if he were going to take his portrait , there is nothing remarkable about him at first sight but his ghostly manner of appearing . “
152196	152205	152004	152004	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn in his quiet way . “
152212	152213	152209	152210	Mr. Bucket	668	” “
152220	152244	152218	152218	sir	9496	” returns the stationer , expressing by a cough that he is quite in the dark as to who Mr. Bucket may be . “
152253	152258	152245	152245	I	0	” says the lawyer , “
152294	152295	152287	152287	you	9496	” “
152380	152381	152382	152383	Mr. Bucket	668	” “
152391	152398	152385	152387	a detective officer	3900	” says the lawyer in explanation . “
152405	152423	152400	152400	he	668	” says Mr. Snagsby with a strong tendency in his clump of hair to stand on end . “
152441	152446	152426	152426	you	362	” pursues the lawyer , “
152459	152482	152447	152447	I	0	” In a moment ’s hesitation on the part of Mr. Snagsby , Bucket dips down to the bottom of his mind . “
152493	152497	152498	152498	You	362	” he says . “
152593	152594	152586	152586	you	362	” “
152601	152610	152598	152599	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” cries Mr. Snagsby cheerfully . And reassured , “
152617	152618	152598	152599	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” “
152628	152653	152625	152626	Mr. Snagsby	362	” resumes Bucket , taking him aside by the arm , tapping him familiarly on the breast , and speaking in a confidential tone . “
152683	152684	152680	152680	YOU	362	” “
152699	152709	152688	152688	I	0	” returns the stationer with his cough of modesty , “
152712	152713	152717	152717	YOU	362	” “
152723	152727	152717	152717	YOU	362	” says Bucket . “
152813	152814	152808	152808	you	362	” “
152819	152824	152808	152808	you	362	” returns the other . “
152832	152842	152825	152825	I	0	” says Bucket with an engaging appearance of frankness , “
152890	152891	152887	152887	you	362	” “
152894	152907	152887	152887	you	362	” says Mr. Snagsby , but not appearing to see quite distinctly . “
152914	152932	152911	152911	YOU	362	” pursues Bucket , again tapping Mr. Snagsby on the breast in a comfortable and soothing manner , “
152951	152952	152948	152948	YOU	362	” “
152957	152965	152948	152948	YOU	362	” returns Mr. Snagsby with a nod . “
153003	153004	153010	153010	customer	3918	” “
153013	153018	153010	153010	customer	3918	” replies Mr. Snagsby . “
153023	153035	153010	153010	customer	3918	” returns Mr. Bucket , shaking hands with him quite affectionately . “
153100	153101	153102	153102	You	362	” “
153112	153117	153108	153108	You	362	” says Mr. Snagsby . “
153124	153142	153121	153121	your	362	” returns his new friend , quite as intimate with it as if he had made it ; “
153152	153181	153149	153149	I	0	” They leave Mr. Tulkinghorn , without a ruffle on the surface of his unfathomable depths , drinking his old wine , and go down into the streets . “
153203	153215	153201	153201	you	362	” says Bucket in friendly converse as they descend the stairs . “
153218	153225	153201	153201	you	362	” says Mr. Snagsby , considering , “
153237	153238	153230	153233	anybody of that name	3926	” “
153242	153246	153201	153201	you	362	” says Bucket ; “
153297	153685	153692	153693	Mr. Snagsby	362	” As they walk along , Mr. Snagsby observes , as a novelty , that however quick their pace may be , his companion still seems in some undefinable manner to lurk and lounge ; also , that whenever he is going to turn to the right or left , he pretends to have a fixed purpose in his mind of going straight ahead , and wheels off , sharply , at the very last moment . Now and then , when they pass a police - constable on his beat , Mr. Snagsby notices that both the constable and his guide fall into a deep abstraction as they come towards each other , and appear entirely to overlook each other , and to gaze into space . In a few instances , Mr. Bucket , coming behind some under - sized young man with a shining hat on , and his sleek hair twisted into one flat curl on each side of his head , almost without glancing at him touches him with his stick , upon which the young man , looking round , instantly evaporates . For the most part Mr. Bucket notices things in general , with a face as unchanging as the great mourning ring on his little finger or the brooch , composed of not much diamond and a good deal of setting , which he wears in his shirt . When they come at last to Tom - all - Alone ’s , Mr. Bucket stops for a moment at the corner and takes a lighted bull’s - eye from the constable on duty there , who then accompanies him with his own particular bull’s - eye at his waist . Between his two conductors , Mr. Snagsby passes along the middle of a villainous street , undrained , unventilated , deep in black mud and corrupt water — though the roads are dry elsewhere — and reeking with such smells and sights that he , who has lived in London all his life , can scarce believe his senses . Branching from this street and its heaps of ruins are other streets and courts so infamous that Mr. Snagsby sickens in body and mind and feels as if he were going every moment deeper down into the infernal gulf . “
153695	153715	153692	153693	Mr. Snagsby	362	” says Bucket as a kind of shabby palanquin is borne towards them , surrounded by a noisy crowd . “
153725	153785	153692	153693	Mr. Snagsby	362	” As the unseen wretch goes by , the crowd , leaving that object of attraction , hovers round the three visitors like a dream of horrible faces and fades away up alleys and into ruins and behind walls , and with occasional cries and shrill whistles of warning , thenceforth flits about them until they leave the place . “
153795	153817	153793	153793	Darby	513	” Mr. Bucket coolly asks as he turns his bull’s - eye on a line of stinking ruins . Darby replies that “
153822	153836	153692	153693	Mr. Snagsby	362	” and further that in all , for months and months , the people “
153842	153851	153692	153693	Mr. Snagsby	362	” and have been carried out dead and dying “
153858	154174	153692	153693	Mr. Snagsby	362	” Bucket observing to Mr. Snagsby as they go on again that he looks a little poorly , Mr. Snagsby answers that he feels as if he could n’t breathe the dreadful air . There is inquiry made at various houses for a boy named Jo . As few people are known in Tom - all - Alone ’s by any Christian sign , there is much reference to Mr. Snagsby whether he means Carrots , or the Colonel , or Gallows , or Young Chisel , or Terrier Tip , or Lanky , or the Brick . Mr. Snagsby describes over and over again . There are conflicting opinions respecting the original of his picture . Some think it must be Carrots , some say the Brick . The Colonel is produced , but is not at all near the thing . Whenever Mr. Snagsby and his conductors are stationary , the crowd flows round , and from its squalid depths obsequious advice heaves up to Mr. Bucket . Whenever they move , and the angry bull’s - eyes glare , it fades away and flits about them up the alleys , and in the ruins , and behind the walls , as before . At last there is a lair found out where Toughy , or the Tough Subject , lays him down at night ; and it is thought that the Tough Subject may be Jo . Comparison of notes between Mr. Snagsby and the proprietress of the house — a drunken face tied up in a black bundle , and flaring out of a heap of rags on the floor of a dog - hutch which is her private apartment — leads to the establishment of this conclusion . Toughy has gone to the doctor ’s to get a bottle of stuff for a sick woman but will be here anon . “
154185	154202	154203	154205	Two drunken men	3933	” says Mr. Bucket , opening another door and glaring in with his bull’s - eye . “
154219	154234	154213	154214	The men	3935	” turning back each sleeper ’s arm from his face to look at him . “
154244	154245	154248	154248	sir	9496	” “
154250	154257	154248	154248	sir	9496	” returns one of the women . “
154263	154264	154258	154258	They	3935	” “
154269	154270	154273	154273	sir	9496	” “
154275	154276	154273	154273	sir	9496	” “
154290	154291	154294	154294	sir	9496	” “
154301	154302	154296	154296	We	3931	” “
154307	154308	154296	154296	We	3931	” “
154312	154313	154296	154296	We	3931	” “
154320	154321	154322	154322	We	3931	” “
154355	154356	154352	154352	I	0	” “
154367	154386	154352	154352	I	0	” says Mr. Bucket , turning his head in the direction of the unconscious figures on the ground . “
154391	154399	154400	154400	Jenny	357	” replies the woman with a sigh . “
154408	154512	154400	154400	Jenny	357	” The room , though two or three feet higher than the door , is so low that the head of the tallest of the visitors would touch the blackened ceiling if he stood upright . It is offensive to every sense ; even the gross candle burns pale and sickly in the polluted air . There are a couple of benches and a higher bench by way of table . The men lie asleep where they stumbled down , but the women sit by the candle . Lying in the arms of the woman who has spoken is a very young child . “
154524	154528	154518	154518	you	0	” says Bucket . “
154538	154579	154518	154518	you	0	” He is not at all rough about it ; and as he turns his light gently on the infant , Mr. Snagsby is strangely reminded of another infant , encircled with light , that he has seen in pictures . “
154590	154595	154580	154580	He	3944	” says the woman . “
154601	154602	154603	154603	Mine	3947	” “
154605	154631	154603	154603	Mine	3947	” The other woman , who was bending over it when they came in , stoops down again and kisses it as it lies asleep . “
154646	154651	154632	154632	You	9496	” says Mr. Bucket . “
154667	154668	154671	154671	Jenny	357	” “
154675	154683	154673	154673	Jenny	357	” says the other woman to her . “
154701	154702	154696	154696	Jenny	357	” “
154715	154720	154708	154710	an unnatural woman	3951	” returns Bucket sternly , “
154729	154730	154731	154731	God	358	” “
154739	154743	154733	154733	you	0	” she returns . “
154770	154771	154760	154760	I	0	” “
154781	154789	154792	154792	you	9496	” says Mr. Bucket , mollified again . “
154796	154797	154792	154792	you	9496	” “
154807	154818	154805	154805	master	9808	” returns the woman , her eyes filling with tears , “
154887	154896	154885	154885	them	3960	” glancing at the sleepers on the ground . “
154937	154938	154932	154932	YOU	3957	” “
154943	154948	154949	154949	you	3957	” says Mr. Bucket , “
154975	154976	154955	154955	he	3961	” “
154983	154991	154977	154977	I	0	” she answers , wiping her eyes . “
155140	155141	155135	155135	Jenny	357	” “
155146	155150	155135	155135	Jenny	357	” says Jenny . “
155164	155193	155160	155160	me	0	” In doing so , she displaces the mother ’s dress , but quickly readjusts it over the wounded and bruised bosom where the baby has been lying . “
155200	155212	155196	155198	my dead child	3968	” says Jenny , walking up and down as she nurses , “
155292	155326	155331	155331	you	3974	” As Mr. Snagsby blows his nose and coughs his cough of sympathy , a step is heard without . Mr. Bucket throws his light into the doorway and says to Mr. Snagsby , “
155340	155341	155337	155337	HE	518	” “
155346	155399	155344	155344	Jo	389	” says Mr. Snagsby . Jo stands amazed in the disk of light , like a ragged figure in a magic - lantern , trembling to think that he has offended against the law in not having moved on far enough . Mr. Snagsby , however , giving him the consolatory assurance , “
155413	155441	155411	155411	Jo	389	” he recovers ; and on being taken outside by Mr. Bucket for a little private confabulation , tells his tale satisfactorily , though out of breath . “
155450	155457	155442	155442	I	0	” says Mr. Bucket , returning , “
155475	155507	155469	155469	we	3976	” First , Jo has to complete his errand of good nature by handing over the physic he has been to get , which he delivers with the laconic verbal direction that “
155516	155887	155469	155469	we	3976	” Secondly , Mr. Snagsby has to lay upon the table half a crown , his usual panacea for an immense variety of afflictions . Thirdly , Mr. Bucket has to take Jo by the arm a little above the elbow and walk him on before him , without which observance neither the Tough Subject nor any other Subject could be professionally conducted to Lincoln ’s Inn Fields . These arrangements completed , they give the women good night and come out once more into black and foul Tom - all - Alone ’s . By the noisome ways through which they descended into that pit , they gradually emerge from it , the crowd flitting , and whistling , and skulking about them until they come to the verge , where restoration of the bull’s - eyes is made to Darby . Here the crowd , like a concourse of imprisoned demons , turns back , yelling , and is seen no more . Through the clearer and fresher streets , never so clear and fresh to Mr. Snagsby ’s mind as now , they walk and ride until they come to Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s gate . As they ascend the dim stairs ( Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s chambers being on the first floor ) , Mr. Bucket mentions that he has the key of the outer door in his pocket and that there is no need to ring . For a man so expert in most things of that kind , Bucket takes time to open the door and makes some noise too . It may be that he sounds a note of preparation . Howbeit , they come at last into the hall , where a lamp is burning , and so into Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s usual room — the room where he drank his old wine to - night . He is not there , but his two old - fashioned candlesticks are , and the room is tolerably light . Mr. Bucket , still having his professional hold of Jo and appearing to Mr. Snagsby to possess an unlimited number of eyes , makes a little way into this room , when Jo starts and stops . “
155893	155900	155469	155469	we	3976	” says Bucket in a whisper . “
155905	155909	155902	155902	she	3977	” cries Jo . “
155912	155913	155914	155915	The lady	1180	” “
155917	155970	155914	155915	The lady	1180	” A female figure , closely veiled , stands in the middle of the room , where the light falls upon it . It is quite still and silent . The front of the figure is towards them , but it takes no notice of their entrance and remains like a statue . “
155976	155981	155974	155974	me	0	” says Bucket aloud , “
155991	155992	155983	155983	you	3979	” “
155998	156004	155974	155974	me	0	” replies Jo , staring , “
156013	156014	156020	156020	you	3979	” “
156025	156034	156023	156023	Tough	519	” returns Bucket , narrowly observant of him . “
156038	156039	156040	156040	I	0	” “
156053	156060	156049	156049	I	0	” says Jo with starting eyes , “
156075	156076	156049	156049	I	0	” “
156086	156090	156081	156081	you	3979	” asks Bucket . “
156098	156136	156081	156081	you	3979	” says Jo , rubbing the fingers of his left hand on the knuckles of his right without taking his eyes from the figure . The figure removes the right - hand glove and shows the hand . “
156146	156155	156141	156141	you	3979	” asks Bucket . Jo shakes his head . “
156169	156170	156173	156173	you	3979	” “
156177	156190	156173	156173	you	3979	” says Bucket , evidently pleased though , and well pleased too . “
156206	156210	156191	156191	Hand	520	” returns Jo . “
156224	156229	156217	156217	I	0	” says Mr. Bucket . “
156238	156239	156233	156234	the lady	1180	” “
156245	156253	156242	156242	I	0	” says Jo . The figure speaks . “
156287	156295	156322	156323	the lady	1180	” Jo looks aghast at Mr. Bucket . “
156300	156301	156322	156323	the lady	1180	” “
156306	156316	156318	156318	you	0	” retorts that worthy , pointing to the figure , “
156326	156327	156318	156318	you	0	” “
156330	156347	156318	156318	you	0	” says Jo with a perplexed stare but without being at all shaken in his certainty , “
156430	156431	156421	156421	she	1180	” “
156434	156440	156421	156421	she	1180	” says Mr. Bucket slightly , “
156477	156587	156589	156589	you	3987	” Bucket stealthily tells the coins from one hand into the other like counters — which is a way he has , his principal use of them being in these games of skill — and then puts them , in a little pile , into the boy ’s hand and takes him out to the door , leaving Mr. Snagsby , not by any means comfortable under these mysterious circumstances , alone with the veiled figure . But on Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s coming into the room , the veil is raised and a sufficiently good - looking Frenchwoman is revealed , though her expression is something of the intensest . “
156594	156603	156589	156589	you	3987	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn with his usual equanimity . “
156616	156617	156604	156604	I	0	” “
156637	156641	156618	156618	You	3987	” says mademoiselle . “
156646	156647	156618	156618	You	3987	” “
156660	156661	156618	156618	You	3987	” “
156669	156670	156666	156667	Mademoiselle Hortense	396	” “
156680	156681	156674	156675	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” “
156690	156691	156674	156675	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” “
156703	156704	156700	156701	dear sir	3989	” “
156708	156756	156759	156759	Bucket	668	” Mademoiselle goes out with an air of native gentility ; and Mr. Bucket , to whom it is , on an emergency , as natural to be groom of the ceremonies as it is to be anything else , shows her downstairs , not without gallantry . “
156761	156769	156759	156759	Bucket	668	” quoth Mr. Tulkinghorn on his return . “
156838	156839	156840	156840	You	362	” “
156848	156853	156843	156843	your	362	” returns the stationer ; “
156879	156880	156867	156867	I	0	” “
156890	156895	156882	156882	you	362	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
156910	156911	156916	156916	sir	9496	” “
156924	156925	156918	156918	I	0	” “
156932	156952	156929	156930	Mr. Snagsby	362	” says Mr. Bucket , accompanying him to the door and shaking hands with him over and over again , “
157014	157015	157011	157011	YOU	362	” “
157027	157032	157020	157020	I	0	” returns Mr. Snagsby . “
157050	157067	157045	157045	you	362	” says Mr. Bucket , shaking hands with him and blessing him in the tenderest manner , “
157088	157572	157077	157077	I	0	” Mr. Snagsby makes a suitable response and goes homeward so confused by the events of the evening that he is doubtful of his being awake and out — doubtful of the reality of the streets through which he goes — doubtful of the reality of the moon that shines above him . He is presently reassured on these subjects by the unchallengeable reality of Mrs. Snagsby , sitting up with her head in a perfect beehive of curl - papers and night - cap , who has dispatched Guster to the police - station with official intelligence of her husband ’s being made away with , and who within the last two hours has passed through every stage of swooning with the greatest decorum . But as the little woman feelingly says , many thanks she gets for it ! CHAPTER XXIII Esther ’s Narrative We came home from Mr. Boythorn ’s after six pleasant weeks . We were often in the park and in the woods and seldom passed the lodge where we had taken shelter without looking in to speak to the keeper ’s wife ; but we saw no more of Lady Dedlock , except at church on Sundays . There was company at Chesney Wold ; and although several beautiful faces surrounded her , her face retained the same influence on me as at first . I do not quite know even now whether it was painful or pleasurable , whether it drew me towards her or made me shrink from her . I think I admired her with a kind of fear , and I know that in her presence my thoughts always wandered back , as they had done at first , to that old time of my life . I had a fancy , on more than one of these Sundays , that what this lady so curiously was to me , I was to her — I mean that I disturbed her thoughts as she influenced mine , though in some different way . But when I stole a glance at her and saw her so composed and distant and unapproachable , I felt this to be a foolish weakness . Indeed , I felt the whole state of my mind in reference to her to be weak and unreasonable , and I remonstrated with myself about it as much as I could . One incident that occurred before we quitted Mr. Boythorn ’s house , I had better mention in this place . I was walking in the garden with Ada when I was told that some one wished to see me . Going into the breakfast - room where this person was waiting , I found it to be the French maid who had cast off her shoes and walked through the wet grass on the day when it thundered and lightened . “
157575	157604	157077	157077	I	0	” she began , looking fixedly at me with her too - eager eyes , though otherwise presenting an agreeable appearance and speaking neither with boldness nor servility , “
157629	157630	157616	157616	you	396	” “
157636	157640	157616	157616	you	396	” I returned , “
157649	157650	157642	157642	you	396	” “
157676	157686	157693	157693	Mademoiselle	396	” she said in a quick , natural way . “
157689	157692	157693	157693	Mademoiselle	396	” said I. “
157736	157753	157732	157732	you	396	” Her quickness anticipated what I might have said presently but as yet had only thought . “
157794	157795	157780	157780	I	0	” “
157803	157806	157800	157800	you	396	” said I. “
157864	157865	157866	157866	I	0	” “
157870	157874	157866	157866	I	0	” I began . “
157884	157897	157866	157866	I	0	” she said with an involuntary contraction of her fine black eyebrows . “
157967	157968	157969	157969	I	0	” “
157973	157989	157969	157969	I	0	” said I , quite embarrassed by the mere idea of having such an attendant , “
157996	157997	157991	157991	I	0	” “
158071	158119	158120	158120	Mademoiselle	396	” She was so singularly earnest that I drew back , almost afraid of her . Without appearing to notice it , in her ardour she still pressed herself upon me , speaking in a rapid subdued voice , though always with a certain grace and propriety . “
158244	158324	158237	158237	You	396	” There was a lowering energy in her face as she stood looking at me while I explained the impossibility of my engaging her ( without thinking it necessary to say how very little I desired to do so ) , which seemed to bring visibly before me some woman from the streets of Paris in the reign of terror . She heard me out without interruption and then said with her pretty accent and in her mildest voice , “
158364	158393	158356	158356	you	4001	” She looked at me more intently as she took it , and seemed to take note , with her momentary touch , of every vein in it . “
158409	158426	158427	158427	I	0	” she said with a parting curtsy . I confessed that she had surprised us all . “
158434	158440	158427	158427	I	0	” she said , smiling , “
158466	158979	158464	158464	mademoiselle	396	” So ended our conference , which I was very glad to bring to a close . I supposed she went away from the village , for I saw her no more ; and nothing else occurred to disturb our tranquil summer pleasures until six weeks were out and we returned home as I began just now by saying . At that time , and for a good many weeks after that time , Richard was constant in his visits . Besides coming every Saturday or Sunday and remaining with us until Monday morning , he sometimes rode out on horseback unexpectedly and passed the evening with us and rode back again early next day . He was as vivacious as ever and told us he was very industrious , but I was not easy in my mind about him . It appeared to me that his industry was all misdirected . I could not find that it led to anything but the formation of delusive hopes in connexion with the suit already the pernicious cause of so much sorrow and ruin . He had got at the core of that mystery now , he told us , and nothing could be plainer than that the will under which he and Ada were to take I do n’t know how many thousands of pounds must be finally established if there were any sense or justice in the Court of Chancery — but oh , what a great IF that sounded in my ears — and that this happy conclusion could not be much longer delayed . He proved this to himself by all the weary arguments on that side he had read , and every one of them sunk him deeper in the infatuation . He had even begun to haunt the court . He told us how he saw Miss Flite there daily , how they talked together , and how he did her little kindnesses , and how , while he laughed at her , he pitied her from his heart . But he never thought — never , my poor , dear , sanguine Richard , capable of so much happiness then , and with such better things before him — what a fatal link was riveting between his fresh youth and her faded age , between his free hopes and her caged birds , and her hungry garret , and her wandering mind . Ada loved him too well to mistrust him much in anything he said or did , and my guardian , though he frequently complained of the east wind and read more than usual in the growlery , preserved a strict silence on the subject . So I thought one day when I went to London to meet Caddy Jellyby , at her solicitation , I would ask Richard to be in waiting for me at the coach - office , that we might have a little talk together . I found him there when I arrived , and we walked away arm in arm . “
158984	158999	159080	159080	You	291	” said I as soon as I could begin to be grave with him , “
159009	159010	159001	159001	you	291	” “
159018	159022	159001	159001	you	291	” returned Richard . “
159029	159030	159023	159023	I	0	” “
159034	159037	159023	159023	I	0	” said I. “
159045	159053	159040	159040	you	291	” returned Richard with his gay laugh . “
159059	159062	159040	159040	you	291	” said I. “
159067	159071	159072	159072	I	0	” replied Richard , “
159078	159079	159080	159080	You	291	” “
159089	159090	159080	159080	You	291	” “
159125	159126	159112	159112	You	291	” “
159129	159130	159112	159112	You	291	” “
159144	159150	159135	159135	I	0	” said Richard , strongly emphasizing “
159153	159161	159135	159135	I	0	” as if that expressed the difficulty , “
159193	159194	159186	159186	I	0	” “
159207	159210	159196	159196	you	0	” said I. “
159218	159245	159196	159196	you	0	” answered Richard . We walked a little way without speaking , and presently Richard addressed me in his frankest and most feeling manner , thus : “
159364	159365	159367	159367	you	0	” “
159373	159374	159367	159367	you	0	” “
159377	159381	159367	159367	you	0	” said Richard , “
159423	159424	159421	159421	you	280	” “
159431	159434	159425	159425	You	280	” said I. “
159447	159451	159435	159435	You	280	” he returned . “
159591	159615	159618	159618	Richard	291	” We were in a solitary place , and he put his hands before his eyes and sobbed as he said the words . “
159620	159623	159618	159618	Richard	291	” said I. “
159647	159648	159649	159649	I	0	” “
159655	159663	159664	159664	I	0	” he replied , pressing my arm , “
159799	159839	159790	159790	Ada	290	” It had given me a pang to hear him sob and see the tears start out between his fingers , but that was infinitely less affecting to me than the hopeful animation with which he said these words . “
159859	159870	159850	159850	I	0	” he continued , recovering his cheerfulness in a moment , “
159941	159975	159937	159937	you	9540	” Recalling how he had just now placed Messrs. Kenge and Carboy in the same category with Mr. Badger , I asked him when he intended to be articled in Lincoln ’s Inn . “
159987	159994	159979	159979	I	0	” he returned with an effort . “
160056	160066	160068	160068	I	0	” continued Richard , confident again by this time , “
160075	160076	160077	160077	I	0	” “
160082	160085	160077	160077	I	0	” said I. “
160092	160096	160077	160077	I	0	” returned Richard , “
160187	160197	160180	160180	I	0	” I looked at him and shook my head . “
160200	160211	160180	160180	I	0	” said Richard , in a tone of perfect conviction , “
160216	160217	160180	160180	I	0	” “
160221	160224	160180	160180	I	0	” said I. “
160251	160625	160245	160245	I	0	” said Richard . And then he showed me , proved by elaborate calculations in his pocket - book , that supposing he had contracted , say , two hundred pounds of debt in six months out of the army ; and that he contracted no debt at all within a corresponding period in the army — as to which he had quite made up his mind ; this step must involve a saving of four hundred pounds in a year , or two thousand pounds in five years , which was a considerable sum . And then he spoke so ingenuously and sincerely of the sacrifice he made in withdrawing himself for a time from Ada , and of the earnestness with which he aspired — as in thought he always did , I know full well — to repay her love , and to ensure her happiness , and to conquer what was amiss in himself , and to acquire the very soul of decision , that he made my heart ache keenly , sorely . For , I thought , how would this end , how could this end , when so soon and so surely all his manly qualities were touched by the fatal blight that ruined everything it rested on ! I spoke to Richard with all the earnestness I felt , and all the hope I could not quite feel then , and implored him for Ada ’s sake not to put any trust in Chancery . To all I said , Richard readily assented , riding over the court and everything else in his easy way and drawing the brightest pictures of the character he was to settle into — alas , when the grievous suit should loose its hold upon him ! We had a long talk , but it always came back to that , in substance . At last we came to Soho Square , where Caddy Jellyby had appointed to wait for me , as a quiet place in the neighbourhood of Newman Street . Caddy was in the garden in the centre and hurried out as soon as I appeared . After a few cheerful words , Richard left us together . “
160636	160640	160634	160634	Esther	280	” said Caddy , “
160682	160683	160672	160672	I	0	” “
160690	160693	160672	160672	I	0	” said I. “
160699	160735	160736	160736	You	280	” So Caddy , after affectionately squeezing the dear good face as she called it , locked the gate , and took my arm , and we began to walk round the garden very cosily . “
160741	160752	160739	160739	Esther	280	” said Caddy , who thoroughly enjoyed a little confidence , “
160836	160837	160838	160838	I	0	” “
160845	160846	160840	160840	he	437	” “
160876	160877	160871	160871	he	437	” “
160880	160881	160882	160882	Esther	280	” “
160894	160904	160882	160882	Esther	280	” said Caddy , laughing and shaking her head ; “
160944	160945	160947	160947	my	0	” “
160952	160956	160947	160947	my	0	” said I , “
160976	160977	160957	160957	you	300	” “
160987	160999	160980	160980	I	0	” replied Caddy , crossing her hands confidentially upon my arm . “
161024	161025	161011	161011	I	0	” “
161037	161038	161028	161028	you	300	” “
161045	161058	161059	161059	I	0	” cried Caddy , greatly pleased and with the brightest of faces . “
161166	161167	161138	161138	Esther	280	” “
161173	161176	161177	161177	Esther	280	” said I. “
161183	161184	161177	161177	Esther	280	” “
161193	161197	161186	161186	I	0	” exclaimed Caddy . “
161299	161303	161297	161297	Esther	280	” said Caddy , “
161311	161312	161297	161297	Esther	280	” “
161319	161320	161316	161317	my dear	9540	” “
161352	161362	161350	161350	Esther	280	” Caddy apologized , her face suffused with blushes , “
161372	161386	161392	161392	Esther	280	” I laughed ; and Caddy laughed and blushed , and went on . “
161394	161395	161392	161392	Esther	280	” “
161402	161403	161406	161406	you	9540	” “
161410	161423	161406	161406	you	9540	” said Caddy , laughing , with her pretty face on fire . “
161519	161530	161514	161514	my	0	” said Caddy , looking at me hopefully but timidly , “
161592	161593	161583	161583	Esther	280	” “
161600	161608	161598	161598	Caddy	300	” said I , pretending to consider . “
161645	161911	161912	161912	Father	521	” Caddy was quite transported by this reply of mine , being , I believe , as susceptible to the least kindness or encouragement as any tender heart that ever beat in this world ; and after another turn or two round the garden , during which she put on an entirely new pair of gloves and made herself as resplendent as possible that she might do no avoidable discredit to the Master of Deportment , we went to Newman Street direct . Prince was teaching , of course . We found him engaged with a not very hopeful pupil — a stubborn little girl with a sulky forehead , a deep voice , and an inanimate , dissatisfied mama — whose case was certainly not rendered more hopeful by the confusion into which we threw her preceptor . The lesson at last came to an end , after proceeding as discordantly as possible ; and when the little girl had changed her shoes and had had her white muslin extinguished in shawls , she was taken away . After a few words of preparation , we then went in search of Mr. Turveydrop , whom we found , grouped with his hat and gloves , as a model of deportment , on the sofa in his private apartment — the only comfortable room in the house . He appeared to have dressed at his leisure in the intervals of a light collation , and his dressing - case , brushes , and so forth , all of quite an elegant kind , lay about . “
161920	161921	161917	161918	Miss Jellyby	304	” “
161926	161939	161941	161941	me	0	” said Mr. Turveydrop , rising with his high - shouldered bow . “
161943	161947	161941	161941	me	0	” Handing chairs . “
161951	161960	161941	161941	me	0	” Kissing the tips of his left fingers . “
161963	161970	161971	161971	My	0	” Shutting his eyes and rolling . “
161979	161992	161971	161971	My	0	” Recomposing himself on the sofa like the second gentleman in Europe . “
162001	162005	161994	161994	you	280	” said he , “
162098	162118	162119	162119	My	0	” I said nothing , which I thought a suitable reply ; and he took a pinch of snuff . “
162123	162128	162119	162119	My	0	” said Mr. Turveydrop , “
162143	162144	162136	162136	I	0	” “
162150	162154	162148	162148	father	2776	” returned Prince , “
162183	162184	162177	162177	I	0	” “
162188	162210	162177	162177	I	0	” exclaimed the model , pale and aghast as Prince and Caddy , hand in hand , bent down before him . “
162224	162225	162226	162226	Father	2776	” “
162228	162235	162226	162226	Father	2776	” returned Prince with great submission , “
162247	162248	162243	162243	we	4073	” “
162251	162269	162243	162243	we	4073	” cried Mr. Turveydrop , reclining on the sofa and shutting out the sight with his hand . “
162281	162282	162243	162243	we	4073	” “
162293	162297	162291	162291	father	2776	” faltered Prince , “
162341	162348	162359	162359	father	2776	” Mr. Turveydrop uttered a groan . “
162361	162366	162359	162359	father	2776	” urged his son . “
162388	162393	162400	162400	father	2776	” Mr. Turveydrop sobbed . “
162402	162407	162400	162400	father	2776	” cried his son . “
162410	162415	162408	162408	Boy	9480	” said Mr. Turveydrop , “
162443	162444	162438	162438	sir	9496	” “
162453	162460	162451	162451	father	2776	” implored Prince , in tears . “
162529	162530	162512	162512	your	2776	” “
162534	162539	162512	162512	your	2776	” murmured Mr. Turveydrop . “
162543	162555	162556	162558	My dear father	4070	” But he seemed to listen , I thought , too . “
162560	162564	162556	162558	My dear father	4070	” returned Prince , “
162688	162719	162720	162721	My son	2801	” Mr. Turveydrop underwent a severe internal struggle and came upright on the sofa again with his cheeks puffing over his stiff cravat , a perfect model of parental deportment . “
162723	162728	162729	162730	My children	4096	” said Mr. Turveydrop . “
162742	162782	162783	162784	My children	4096	” His benignity as he raised his future daughter - in - law and stretched out his hand to his son ( who kissed it with affectionate respect and gratitude ) was the most confusing sight I ever saw . “
162786	162814	162783	162784	My children	4096	” said Mr. Turveydrop , paternally encircling Caddy with his left arm as she sat beside him , and putting his right hand gracefully on his hip . “
162838	162848	162827	162827	I	0	me”—meaning , of course , I will always live with you—“this
162873	162916	162864	162864	you	4096	” The power of his deportment was such that they really were as much overcome with thankfulness as if , instead of quartering himself upon them for the rest of his life , he were making some munificent sacrifice in their favour . “
162923	162928	162918	162918	myself	0	” said Mr. Turveydrop , “
163038	163048	163049	163049	My	0	” They were overpowered afresh by his uncommon generosity . “
163052	163057	163049	163049	My	0	” said Mr. Turveydrop , “
163202	163203	163205	163205	you	0	” “
163220	163224	163217	163217	my	0	” replied Prince . “
163232	163237	163217	163217	my	0	” said Mr. Turveydrop . “
163312	163641	163644	163645	Miss Summerson	280	” Old Mr. Turveydrop then became so very gallant , in honour of the occasion , that I told Caddy we must really go to Thavies Inn at once if we were to go at all that day . So we took our departure after a very loving farewell between Caddy and her betrothed , and during our walk she was so happy and so full of old Mr. Turveydrop ’s praises that I would not have said a word in his disparagement for any consideration . The house in Thavies Inn had bills in the windows announcing that it was to let , and it looked dirtier and gloomier and ghastlier than ever . The name of poor Mr. Jellyby had appeared in the list of bankrupts but a day or two before , and he was shut up in the dining - room with two gentlemen and a heap of blue bags , account - books , and papers , making the most desperate endeavours to understand his affairs . They appeared to me to be quite beyond his comprehension , for when Caddy took me into the dining - room by mistake and we came upon Mr. Jellyby in his spectacles , forlornly fenced into a corner by the great dining - table and the two gentlemen , he seemed to have given up the whole thing and to be speechless and insensible . Going upstairs to Mrs. Jellyby ’s room ( the children were all screaming in the kitchen , and there was no servant to be seen ) , we found that lady in the midst of a voluminous correspondence , opening , reading , and sorting letters , with a great accumulation of torn covers on the floor . She was so preoccupied that at first she did not know me , though she sat looking at me with that curious , bright - eyed , far - off look of hers . “
163647	163653	163644	163645	Miss Summerson	280	” she said at last . “
163683	163695	163675	163676	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” I hoped in return that Mr. Jellyby was quite well . “
163704	163713	163675	163676	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” said Mrs. Jellyby in the calmest manner . “
163783	163816	163817	163817	You	0	” I thought of the one family so near us who were neither gone nor going to the left bank of the Niger , and wondered how she could be so placid . “
163826	163837	163817	163817	You	0	” observed Mrs. Jellyby with a glance at her daughter . “
163866	163867	163849	163849	She	280	” “
163874	163878	163872	163872	Ma	308	” began Caddy . “
163885	163891	163880	163880	you	0	” her mother mildly interposed , “
163914	163915	163911	163911	your	0	” “
163925	163929	163923	163923	Ma	308	” returned Caddy . “
163951	163952	163938	163938	you	308	” “
163959	163984	163953	163953	I	0	” said Mrs. Jellyby , still opening her letters , casting her bright eyes smilingly over them , and sorting them as she spoke , “
164045	164046	164031	164031	I	0	” “
164059	164060	164053	164053	Ma	2733	” “
164081	164108	164078	164079	Miss Summerson	280	” said Mrs. Jellyby , sweetly casting her eyes for a moment on me and considering where to put the particular letter she had just opened , “
164149	164198	164143	164143	my	0	” As Caddy gave me a glance of entreaty , and as Mrs. Jellyby was looking far away into Africa straight through my bonnet and head , I thought it a good opportunity to come to the subject of my visit and to attract Mrs. Jellyby ’s attention . “
164201	164205	164206	164206	you	9540	” I began , “
164218	164219	164220	164220	I	0	” “
164229	164242	164226	164227	Miss Summerson	280	” said Mrs. Jellyby , pursuing her employment with a placid smile . “
164247	164254	164255	164255	she	280	” and she shook her head , “
164264	164265	164255	164255	she	280	” “
164272	164276	164266	164266	I	0	” said I , “
164314	164315	164316	164316	Caddy	300	” “
164318	164340	164316	164316	Caddy	300	” said Mrs. Jellyby , pausing for a moment in her occupation and then serenely pursuing it after shaking her head , “
164350	164381	164382	164382	Ma	308	” Caddy untied the strings of her bonnet , took her bonnet off , and letting it dangle on the floor by the strings , and crying heartily , said , “
164388	164389	164384	164384	I	0	” “
164396	164413	164392	164392	you	300	” observed Mrs. Jellyby with an abstracted air as she looked over the dispatch last opened ; “
164420	164421	164392	164392	you	300	” “
164428	164432	164426	164426	Ma	308	” sobbed Caddy , “
164488	164506	164507	164507	You	308	” sobbed Caddy , quite forgetful of her general complainings and of everything but her natural affection . “
164514	164520	164507	164507	You	308	” observed Mrs. Jellyby serenely , “
164612	164613	164614	164614	Ma	308	” “
164624	164628	164629	164629	Caddy	300	” sobbed Caddy . “
164633	164646	164651	164651	you	300	” returned Mrs. Jellyby , opening another letter with the greatest complacency . “
164747	164772	164869	164869	Caddy	300	” repeated Mrs. Jellyby in a calm clear voice , and with an agreeable smile , as she opened more letters and sorted them . “
164777	164840	164869	164869	Caddy	300	” I was so unprepared for the perfect coolness of this reception , though I might have expected it , that I did not know what to say . Caddy seemed equally at a loss . Mrs. Jellyby continued to open and sort letters and to repeat occasionally in quite a charming tone of voice and with a smile of perfect composure , “
164845	164846	164850	164850	Ma	308	” “
164852	164859	164847	164847	I	0	” sobbed poor Caddy at last , “
164865	164866	164860	164860	you	308	” “
164878	164883	164906	164906	Ma	308	” returned Mrs. Jellyby , “
164900	164901	164890	164890	I	0	” “
164918	164922	164908	164908	you	308	” said Caddy . “
164936	164941	164943	164945	a degenerate child	4146	” said Mrs. Jellyby ; “
164987	164998	164985	164985	Caddy	300	” said Mrs. Jellyby , for Caddy was kissing her , “
165024	165048	165049	165049	You	300	” I thought I could not do better than take my leave ; I was detained for a moment by Caddy ’s saying , “
165063	165064	165061	165061	Ma	308	” “
165072	165085	165087	165087	you	300	” cried Mrs. Jellyby , who had relapsed into that distant contemplation , “
165094	165095	165096	165096	Him	1310	” “
165100	165101	165096	165096	Him	1310	” “
165106	165118	165104	165104	Caddy	300	” said Mrs. Jellyby , quite weary of such little matters . “
165222	165772	165801	165801	miss	9584	” I was not surprised by Caddy ’s being in low spirits when we went downstairs , or by her sobbing afresh on my neck , or by her saying she would far rather have been scolded than treated with such indifference , or by her confiding to me that she was so poor in clothes that how she was ever to be married creditably she did n’t know . I gradually cheered her up by dwelling on the many things she would do for her unfortunate father and for Peepy when she had a home of her own ; and finally we went downstairs into the damp dark kitchen , where Peepy and his little brothers and sisters were grovelling on the stone floor and where we had such a game of play with them that to prevent myself from being quite torn to pieces I was obliged to fall back on my fairy - tales . From time to time I heard loud voices in the parlour overhead , and occasionally a violent tumbling about of the furniture . The last effect I am afraid was caused by poor Mr. Jellyby ’s breaking away from the dining - table and making rushes at the window with the intention of throwing himself into the area whenever he made any new attempt to understand his affairs . As I rode quietly home at night after the day ’s bustle , I thought a good deal of Caddy ’s engagement and felt confirmed in my hopes ( in spite of the elder Mr. Turveydrop ) that she would be the happier and better for it . And if there seemed to be but a slender chance of her and her husband ever finding out what the model of deportment really was , why that was all for the best too , and who would wish them to be wiser ? I did not wish them to be any wiser and indeed was half ashamed of not entirely believing in him myself . And I looked up at the stars , and thought about travellers in distant countries and the stars THEY saw , and hoped I might always be so blest and happy as to be useful to some one in my small way . They were so glad to see me when I got home , as they always were , that I could have sat down and cried for joy if that had not been a method of making myself disagreeable . Everybody in the house , from the lowest to the highest , showed me such a bright face of welcome , and spoke so cheerily , and was so happy to do anything for me , that I suppose there never was such a fortunate little creature in the world . We got into such a chatty state that night , through Ada and my guardian drawing me out to tell them all about Caddy , that I went on prose , prose , prosing for a length of time . At last I got up to my own room , quite red to think how I had been holding forth , and then I heard a soft tap at my door . So I said , “
165776	165796	165801	165801	miss	9584	” and there came in a pretty little girl , neatly dressed in mourning , who dropped a curtsy . “
165803	165813	165798	165798	you	4151	” said the little girl in a soft voice , “
165818	165819	165798	165798	you	4151	” “
165826	165840	165823	165823	you	0	” said I , stooping down in astonishment and giving her a kiss . “
165851	165852	165849	165849	Charley	336	” “
165859	165868	165854	165854	you	9584	” pursued Charley in the same soft voice , “
165874	165875	165876	165876	Charley	336	” “
165878	165879	165876	165876	Charley	336	” “
165899	165915	165894	165895	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” I sat down with my hand on Charley ’s neck and looked at Charley . “
165921	165938	165919	165919	miss	9584	” says Charley , clapping her hands , with the tears starting down her dimpled cheeks , “
166046	166047	166048	166048	I	0	” “
166056	166057	166054	166054	Charley	336	” “
166069	166073	166063	166063	I	0	” says Charley . “
166129	166137	166119	166119	I	0	” cried Charley with a heaving heart , “
166149	166150	166119	166119	I	0	” “
166163	166164	166119	166119	I	0	” “
166189	166190	166185	166185	you	9584	” “
166205	166206	166203	166203	Charley	336	” “
166266	166310	166257	166257	Tom	453	” Charley dried her eyes and entered on her functions , going in her matronly little way about and about the room and folding up everything she could lay her hands upon . Presently Charley came creeping back to my side and said , “
166323	166329	166257	166257	Tom	453	” And I said again , “
166338	166344	166336	166336	Charley	336	” And Charley said again , “
166356	166731	166350	166350	I	0	” And so , after all , I did cry for joy indeed , and so did she . CHAPTER XXIV An Appeal Case As soon as Richard and I had held the conversation of which I have given an account , Richard communicated the state of his mind to Mr. Jarndyce . I doubt if my guardian were altogether taken by surprise when he received the representation , though it caused him much uneasiness and disappointment . He and Richard were often closeted together , late at night and early in the morning , and passed whole days in London , and had innumerable appointments with Mr. Kenge , and laboured through a quantity of disagreeable business . While they were thus employed , my guardian , though he underwent considerable inconvenience from the state of the wind and rubbed his head so constantly that not a single hair upon it ever rested in its right place , was as genial with Ada and me as at any other time , but maintained a steady reserve on these matters . And as our utmost endeavours could only elicit from Richard himself sweeping assurances that everything was going on capitally and that it really was all right at last , our anxiety was not much relieved by him . We learnt , however , as the time went on , that a new application was made to the Lord Chancellor on Richard ’s behalf as an infant and a ward , and I do n’t know what , and that there was a quantity of talking , and that the Lord Chancellor described him in open court as a vexatious and capricious infant , and that the matter was adjourned and readjourned , and referred , and reported on , and petitioned about until Richard began to doubt ( as he told us ) whether , if he entered the army at all , it would not be as a veteran of seventy or eighty years of age . At last an appointment was made for him to see the Lord Chancellor again in his private room , and there the Lord Chancellor very seriously reproved him for trifling with time and not knowing his mind—“a
166739	166743	166736	166736	I	0	” said Richard , “
166746	166969	166736	166736	I	0	quarter!”—and at last it was settled that his application should be granted . His name was entered at the Horse Guards as an applicant for an ensign ’s commission ; the purchase - money was deposited at an agent ’s ; and Richard , in his usual characteristic way , plunged into a violent course of military study and got up at five o’clock every morning to practise the broadsword exercise . Thus , vacation succeeded term , and term succeeded vacation . We sometimes heard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce as being in the paper or out of the paper , or as being to be mentioned , or as being to be spoken to ; and it came on , and it went off . Richard , who was now in a professor ’s house in London , was able to be with us less frequently than before ; my guardian still maintained the same reserve ; and so time passed until the commission was obtained and Richard received directions with it to join a regiment in Ireland . He arrived post - haste with the intelligence one evening , and had a long conference with my guardian . Upwards of an hour elapsed before my guardian put his head into the room where Ada and I were sitting and said , “
166976	167004	167005	167005	Rick	317	” We went in and found Richard , whom we had last seen in high spirits , leaning on the chimney - piece looking mortified and angry . “
167011	167016	167005	167005	Rick	317	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
167037	167038	167028	167028	Rick	317	” “
167048	167052	167039	167039	You	0	” said Richard . “
167090	167091	167088	167088	sir	9496	” “
167096	167101	167088	167088	sir	9496	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
167121	167122	167123	167123	I	0	” “
167133	167145	167125	167125	you	9496	” returned Richard in a fiery way , but yet respectfully , “
167157	167158	167159	167159	I	0	” “
167171	167183	167164	167164	my	0	” observed Mr. Jarndyce with the sweetest cheerfulness and good humour , “
167235	167257	167224	167224	you	317	” Ada had turned so pale that he made her sit down in his reading - chair and sat beside her . “
167265	167269	167224	167224	you	317	” he said , “
167306	167307	167308	167308	I	0	” “
167316	167323	167308	167308	I	0	” replied Ada with a smile , “
167332	167333	167335	167335	you	9540	” “
167368	167386	167387	167387	you	9540	” putting his hand on hers as it lay on the side of the easy - chair , “
167408	167409	167397	167399	the little woman	2720	” “
167430	167431	167427	167428	cousin John	480	” “
167438	167442	167432	167432	I	0	” said Richard . “
167450	167454	167444	167444	I	0	” said Ada . “
167475	167492	167460	167460	I	0	” returned my guardian , his face irradiated by the gentleness and honour of his heart . “
167544	167545	167549	167549	I	0	” “
167574	167578	167567	167567	I	0	” said Richard , “
167585	167586	167587	167587	Rick	317	” “
167591	167623	167589	167589	Rick	317	” cried my guardian with a sudden terror in his manner , and in an altered voice , and putting up his hands as if he would have stopped his ears . “
167680	167723	167724	167724	Ada	290	” We were all startled by the fervour of this warning . Richard bit his lip and held his breath , and glanced at me as if he felt , and knew that I felt too , how much he needed it . “
167729	167738	167724	167724	Ada	290	” said Mr. Jarndyce , recovering his cheerfulness , “
167856	167857	167839	167839	I	0	” “
167866	167870	167872	167872	you	9496	” returned Richard , “
167888	167889	167880	167880	you	9496	” “
167907	167908	167901	167901	I	0	” “
167918	167922	167909	167909	You	9496	” retorted Richard . “
167929	167930	167926	167926	I	0	” “
167954	167965	167943	167943	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce in a cordial and encouraging manner . “
168042	168043	168044	168044	You	9496	” “
168053	168057	168044	168044	You	9496	” said Richard . “
168068	168069	168070	168070	My	0	” “
168074	168079	168070	168070	My	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
168165	168166	168172	168172	sir	9496	” “
168174	168179	168172	168172	sir	9496	” returned Richard hastily . “
168198	168199	168191	168191	You	317	” “
168221	168222	168223	168223	You	317	” “
168230	168231	168223	168223	You	317	” “
168241	168247	168239	168239	you	9951	” said Mr. Jarndyce kindly . “
168302	168314	168315	168315	I	0	” Richard gave an anxious glance at Ada but said nothing . “
168329	168334	168315	168315	I	0	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
168410	168416	168397	168397	you	9951	” A long silence succeeded . “
168420	168434	168417	168418	Cousin Richard	523	” said Ada then , raising her blue eyes tenderly to his face , “
168503	168511	168493	168493	I	0	” said Ada , a little confused , “
168653	168668	168675	168675	Richard	523	” said Ada , going up to him and giving him her trembling hand , “
168697	169083	168683	168683	I	0	” It was strange to me that Richard should not be able to forgive my guardian for entertaining the very same opinion of him which he himself had expressed of himself in much stronger terms to me . But it was certainly the case . I observed with great regret that from this hour he never was as free and open with Mr. Jarndyce as he had been before . He had every reason given him to be so , but he was not ; and solely on his side , an estrangement began to arise between them . In the business of preparation and equipment he soon lost himself , and even his grief at parting from Ada , who remained in Hertfordshire while he , Mr. Jarndyce , and I went up to London for a week . He remembered her by fits and starts , even with bursts of tears , and at such times would confide to me the heaviest self - reproaches . But in a few minutes he would recklessly conjure up some undefinable means by which they were both to be made rich and happy for ever , and would become as gay as possible . It was a busy time , and I trotted about with him all day long , buying a variety of things of which he stood in need . Of the things he would have bought if he had been left to his own ways I say nothing . He was perfectly confidential with me , and often talked so sensibly and feelingly about his faults and his vigorous resolutions , and dwelt so much upon the encouragement he derived from these conversations that I could never have been tired if I had tried . There used , in that week , to come backward and forward to our lodging to fence with Richard a person who had formerly been a cavalry soldier ; he was a fine bluff - looking man , of a frank free bearing , with whom Richard had practised for some months . I heard so much about him , not only from Richard , but from my guardian too , that I was purposely in the room with my work one morning after breakfast when he came . “
169090	169103	169087	169088	Mr. George	500	” said my guardian , who happened to be alone with me . “
169128	169161	169113	169114	Miss Summerson	280	” He sat down , a little disconcerted by my presence , I thought , and without looking at me , drew his heavy sunburnt hand across and across his upper lip . “
169170	169175	169162	169162	You	500	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
169181	169185	169179	169179	sir	9496	” he replied . “
169207	169208	169198	169198	I	0	” “
169222	169227	169234	169234	sir	9496	” said Mr. Jarndyce . “
169249	169250	169236	169236	I	0	” “
169270	169275	169261	169262	a swordsman	4223	” said my guardian . “
169281	169297	169279	169279	sir	9496	” he replied , folding his arms upon his broad chest and looking very large . “
169317	169318	169310	169310	he	4225	” “
169327	169332	169333	169333	He	4225	” said my guardian . “
169363	169376	169357	169359	some young lady	4227	” His bright dark eyes glanced at me for the first time . “
169392	169398	169389	169390	Mr. George	500	” said I , laughing , “
169406	169422	169400	169400	you	9496	” He reddened a little through his brown and made me a trooper ’s bow . “
169438	169439	169435	169436	the roughs	4229	” “
169444	169447	169435	169436	the roughs	4229	” said I. “
169455	169478	169448	169448	I	0	” If he had not looked at me before , he looked at me now in three or four quick successive glances . “
169486	169499	169448	169448	I	0	” he said to my guardian with a manly kind of diffidence , “
169514	169515	169501	169501	you	0	” “
169519	169520	169516	169517	Miss Summerson	280	” “
169524	169534	169521	169522	Miss Summerson	280	” he repeated , and looked at me again . “
169541	169545	169536	169536	you	0	” I asked . “
169566	169567	169563	169563	you	0	” “
169572	169606	169563	169563	you	0	” I returned , raising my head from my work to look at him ; and there was something so genuine in his speech and manner that I was glad of the opportunity . “
169613	169614	169607	169607	I	0	” “
169621	169639	169617	169617	I	0	” he returned , meeting my look with the fullness of his dark eyes and broad forehead . “
169652	169677	169617	169617	I	0	” His once more reddening through his brown and being disconcerted by his efforts to remember the association brought my guardian to his relief . “
169686	169687	169683	169684	Mr. George	500	” “
169707	169708	169697	169697	they	4234	” “
169722	169723	169713	169714	chance people	4236	” “
169776	169777	169778	169778	People	858	” “
169797	169804	169778	169778	People	858	” said my guardian , smiling . “
169845	169861	169840	169840	I	0	” said Mr. George , sitting stiffly upright and squaring an elbow on each knee , “
169877	169878	169879	169879	I	0	” “
169887	169888	169879	169879	I	0	” “
169902	169903	169904	169906	A Chancery suitor	4247	” “
169908	169913	169904	169906	A Chancery suitor	4247	” returned my guardian . “
169918	169919	169904	169906	A Chancery suitor	4247	” “
169946	169951	169953	169953	he	1619	” said Mr. George , “
170107	170108	170111	170112	that man	10857	” “
170114	170125	170111	170112	that man	10857	” asked my guardian in a new tone of interest . “
170145	170150	170128	170128	he	10857	” said Mr. George . “
170156	170157	170152	170152	his	10857	” “
170163	170220	170161	170161	sir	9496	” Mr. George directed another succession of quick bright glances at me as my guardian and I exchanged a word or two of surprise at the coincidence , and I therefore explained to him how we knew the name . He made me another of his soldierly bows in acknowledgment of what he called my condescension . “
170226	170235	170161	170161	sir	9496	” he said as he looked at me , “
170256	170307	170308	170308	I	0	” He passed one of his heavy hands over his crisp dark hair as if to sweep the broken thoughts out of his mind and sat a little forward , with one arm akimbo and the other resting on his leg , looking in a brown study at the ground . “
170333	170338	170308	170308	I	0	” said my guardian . “
170346	170359	170340	170340	I	0	” returned Mr. George , still musing and looking on the ground . “
170365	170366	170361	170361	I	0	” “
170373	170374	170367	170367	You	0	” “
170379	170395	170377	170377	sir	9496	” returned the trooper , lifting up his eyes and coming out of his reverie . “
170440	171245	171246	171246	Jarndyce	286	” Richard ’s entrance stopped the conversation . Mr. George rose , made me another of his soldierly bows , wished my guardian a good day , and strode heavily out of the room . This was the morning of the day appointed for Richard ’s departure . We had no more purchases to make now ; I had completed all his packing early in the afternoon ; and our time was disengaged until night , when he was to go to Liverpool for Holyhead . Jarndyce and Jarndyce being again expected to come on that day , Richard proposed to me that we should go down to the court and hear what passed . As it was his last day , and he was eager to go , and I had never been there , I gave my consent and we walked down to Westminster , where the court was then sitting . We beguiled the way with arrangements concerning the letters that Richard was to write to me and the letters that I was to write to him and with a great many hopeful projects . My guardian knew where we were going and therefore was not with us . When we came to the court , there was the Lord Chancellor — the same whom I had seen in his private room in Lincoln ’s Inn — sitting in great state and gravity on the bench , with the mace and seals on a red table below him and an immense flat nosegay , like a little garden , which scented the whole court . Below the table , again , was a long row of solicitors , with bundles of papers on the matting at their feet ; and then there were the gentlemen of the bar in wigs and gowns — some awake and some asleep , and one talking , and nobody paying much attention to what he said . The Lord Chancellor leaned back in his very easy chair with his elbow on the cushioned arm and his forehead resting on his hand ; some of those who were present dozed ; some read the newspapers ; some walked about or whispered in groups : all seemed perfectly at their ease , by no means in a hurry , very unconcerned , and extremely comfortable . To see everything going on so smoothly and to think of the roughness of the suitors ’ lives and deaths ; to see all that full dress and ceremony and to think of the waste , and want , and beggared misery it represented ; to consider that while the sickness of hope deferred was raging in so many hearts this polite show went calmly on from day to day , and year to year , in such good order and composure ; to behold the Lord Chancellor and the whole array of practitioners under him looking at one another and at the spectators as if nobody had ever heard that all over England the name in which they were assembled was a bitter jest , was held in universal horror , contempt , and indignation , was known for something so flagrant and bad that little short of a miracle could bring any good out of it to any one — this was so curious and self - contradictory to me , who had no experience of it , that it was at first incredible , and I could not comprehend it . I sat where Richard put me , and tried to listen , and looked about me ; but there seemed to be no reality in the whole scene except poor little Miss Flite , the madwoman , standing on a bench and nodding at it . Miss Flite soon espied us and came to where we sat . She gave me a gracious welcome to her domain and indicated , with much gratification and pride , its principal attractions . Mr. Kenge also came to speak to us and did the honours of the place in much the same way , with the bland modesty of a proprietor . It was not a very good day for a visit , he said ; he would have preferred the first day of term ; but it was imposing , it was imposing . When we had been there half an hour or so , the case in progress — if I may use a phrase so ridiculous in such a connexion — seemed to die out of its own vapidity , without coming , or being by anybody expected to come , to any result . The Lord Chancellor then threw down a bundle of papers from his desk to the gentlemen below him , and somebody said , “
171250	171294	171246	171246	Jarndyce	286	” Upon this there was a buzz , and a laugh , and a general withdrawal of the bystanders , and a bringing in of great heaps , and piles , and bags and bags full of papers . I think it came on “
171297	171328	171578	171578	your	343	directions”—about some bill of costs , to the best of my understanding , which was confused enough . But I counted twenty - three gentlemen in wigs who said they were “
171332	171444	171578	171578	your	343	” and none of them appeared to understand it much better than I. They chatted about it with the Lord Chancellor , and contradicted and explained among themselves , and some of them said it was this way , and some of them said it was that way , and some of them jocosely proposed to read huge volumes of affidavits , and there was more buzzing and laughing , and everybody concerned was in a state of idle entertainment , and nothing could be made of it by anybody . After an hour or so of this , and a good many speeches being begun and cut short , it was “
171451	171498	171578	171578	your	343	” as Mr. Kenge said , and the papers were bundled up again before the clerks had finished bringing them in . I glanced at Richard on the termination of these hopeless proceedings and was shocked to see the worn look of his handsome young face . “
171514	171575	171576	171576	I	0	” was all he said . I had seen Mr. Guppy bringing in papers and arranging them for Mr. Kenge ; and he had seen me and made me a forlorn bow , which rendered me desirous to get out of the court . Richard had given me his arm and was taking me away when Mr. Guppy came up . “
171584	171591	171581	171582	Mr. Carstone	291	” said he in a whisper , “
171623	171653	171601	171602	a lady	2488	” As he spoke , I saw before me , as if she had started into bodily shape from my remembrance , Mrs. Rachael of my godmother ’s house . “
171661	171665	171656	171656	you	343	” said she . “
171671	171689	171667	171667	you	343	” I gave her my hand and told her yes and that she was very little altered . “
171699	171707	171692	171692	you	343	” she returned with her old asperity . “
171733	171744	171724	171724	you	343	” But indeed she seemed disappointed that I was not . “
171750	171754	171747	171748	Mrs. Rachael	279	” I remonstrated . “
171761	171769	171759	171759	Esther	280	” she returned , coldly correcting me , “
171791	171918	171919	171919	George	500	” Mr. Guppy , who had been attentive to this short dialogue , heaved a sigh in my ear and elbowed his own and Mrs. Rachael ’s way through the confused little crowd of people coming in and going out , which we were in the midst of and which the change in the business had brought together . Richard and I were making our way through it , and I was yet in the first chill of the late unexpected recognition when I saw , coming towards us , but not seeing us , no less a person than Mr. George . He made nothing of the people about him as he tramped on , staring over their heads into the body of the court . “
171921	171932	171919	171919	George	500	” said Richard as I called his attention to him . “
171940	171944	171938	171938	sir	9496	” he returned . “
171969	172000	171962	171962	I	0	” Turning as he spoke and making an easy way for us , he stopped when we were out of the press in a corner behind a great red curtain . “
172009	172013	172003	172007	a little cracked old woman	4270	” he began , “
172016	172066	172003	172007	a little cracked old woman	4270	” I put up my finger , for Miss Flite was close by me , having kept beside me all the time and having called the attention of several of her legal acquaintance to me ( as I had overheard to my confusion ) by whispering in their ears , “
172075	172076	172077	172077	Hem	525	” “
172079	172084	172077	172077	Hem	525	” said Mr. George . “
172104	172113	172102	172102	Gridley	247	” in a low whisper behind his hand . “
172116	172119	172120	172120	He	247	” said I. “
172206	172207	172195	172195	I	0	” “
172213	172216	172209	172209	I	0	” said I. “
172223	172237	172209	172209	I	0	” he returned with a glance of something like apprehension at Miss Flite . “
172263	172298	172299	172299	My	0	” And he put one hand in his breast and stood upright in a martial attitude as I informed little Miss Flite , in her ear , of the purport of his kind errand . “
172311	172315	172299	172299	My	0	” she exclaimed . “
172332	172333	172322	172322	I	0	” “
172343	172346	172339	172340	Mr. George	500	” said I. “
172354	172355	172351	172352	Mr. George	500	” “
172360	172365	172351	172352	Mr. George	500	” returned Miss Flite . “
172387	172448	172449	172449	General	4287	” she whispered to me . Poor Miss Flite deemed it necessary to be so courtly and polite , as a mark of her respect for the army , and to curtsy so very often that it was no easy matter to get her out of the court . When this was at last done , and addressing Mr. George as “
172451	172479	172449	172449	General	4287	” she gave him her arm , to the great entertainment of some idlers who were looking on , he was so discomposed and begged me so respectfully “
172484	172512	172513	172514	Fitz Jarndyce	439	” that I could not make up my mind to do it , especially as Miss Flite was always tractable with me and as she too said , “
172527	172731	172519	172519	you	9540	” As Richard seemed quite willing , and even anxious , that we should see them safely to their destination , we agreed to do so . And as Mr. George informed us that Gridley ’s mind had run on Mr. Jarndyce all the afternoon after hearing of their interview in the morning , I wrote a hasty note in pencil to my guardian to say where we were gone and why . Mr. George sealed it at a coffee - house , that it might lead to no discovery , and we sent it off by a ticket - porter . We then took a hackney - coach and drove away to the neighbourhood of Leicester Square . We walked through some narrow courts , for which Mr. George apologized , and soon came to the shooting gallery , the door of which was closed . As he pulled a bell - handle which hung by a chain to the door - post , a very respectable old gentleman with grey hair , wearing spectacles , and dressed in a black spencer and gaiters and a broad - brimmed hat , and carrying a large gold - beaded cane , addressed him . “
172741	172745	172519	172519	you	9540	” said he , “
172754	172755	172749	172749	George	500	” “
172761	172783	172759	172759	sir	9496	” returned Mr. George , glancing up at the great letters in which that inscription was painted on the whitewashed wall . “
172790	172800	172802	172802	you	4290	” said the old gentleman , following his eyes . “
172810	172811	172805	172805	you	4290	” “
172826	172827	172820	172820	I	0	” “
172832	172838	172820	172820	I	0	” said the old gentleman . “
172864	172865	172856	172856	You	0	” “
172877	172878	172870	172870	You	0	” “
172883	172889	172870	172870	You	0	” said the old gentleman . “
172926	172927	172903	172904	a physician	4297	” “
172932	172948	172903	172904	a physician	4297	” said Mr. George , turning to Richard and me and gravely shaking his head . “
172963	173066	172957	172957	you	9496	” The door being at that moment opened by a very singular - looking little man in a green - baize cap and apron , whose face and hands and dress were blackened all over , we passed along a dreary passage into a large building with bare brick walls where there were targets , and guns , and swords , and other things of that kind . When we had all arrived here , the physician stopped , and taking off his hat , appeared to vanish by magic and to leave another and quite a different man in his place . “
173073	173094	173071	173071	George	500	” said the man , turning quickly round upon him and tapping him on the breast with a large forefinger . “
173168	173185	173155	173155	you	500	” Mr. George , looking hard at him , bit his lip and shook his head . “
173190	173200	173155	173155	you	500	” said the other , keeping close to him , “
173296	173322	173287	173287	you	500	that”—the dirty little man was shuffling about with his shoulder against the wall , and his eyes on the intruder , in a manner that looked threatening—“because
173332	173333	173334	173334	Phil	509	” “
173336	173341	173344	173344	guv’ner	4311	” said Mr. George . “
173346	173347	173344	173344	guv’ner	4311	” “
173351	173364	173344	173344	guv’ner	4311	” The little man , with a low growl , stood still . “
173369	173374	173375	173375	you	500	” said Mr. Bucket , “
173443	173446	173440	173440	you	500	” pointing ; “
173538	173539	173540	173540	I	0	” “
173544	173549	173540	173540	I	0	” was the reply . “
173561	173562	173558	173559	Mr. Bucket	668	” “
173570	173588	173589	173589	I	0	” said Mr. Bucket , tapping him on his broad breast again and shaking hands with him . “
173667	173899	173664	173665	a man	9970	” The affair being brought to this head , Mr. George , after a little consideration , proposed to go in first to his comrade ( as he called him ) , taking Miss Flite with him . Mr. Bucket agreeing , they went away to the further end of the gallery , leaving us sitting and standing by a table covered with guns . Mr. Bucket took this opportunity of entering into a little light conversation , asking me if I were afraid of fire - arms , as most young ladies were ; asking Richard if he were a good shot ; asking Phil Squod which he considered the best of those rifles and what it might be worth first - hand , telling him in return that it was a pity he ever gave way to his temper , for he was naturally so amiable that he might have been a young woman , and making himself generally agreeable . After a time he followed us to the further end of the gallery , and Richard and I were going quietly away when Mr. George came after us . He said that if we had no objection to see his comrade , he would take a visit from us very kindly . The words had hardly passed his lips when the bell was rung and my guardian appeared , “
173904	173909	173664	173665	a man	9970	” he slightly observed , “
173930	174232	174233	174234	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” We all four went back together and went into the place where Gridley was . It was a bare room , partitioned off from the gallery with unpainted wood . As the screening was not more than eight or ten feet high and only enclosed the sides , not the top , the rafters of the high gallery roof were overhead , and the skylight through which Mr. Bucket had looked down . The sun was low — near setting — and its light came redly in above , without descending to the ground . Upon a plain canvas - covered sofa lay the man from Shropshire , dressed much as we had seen him last , but so changed that at first I recognized no likeness in his colourless face to what I recollected . He had been still writing in his hiding - place , and still dwelling on his grievances , hour after hour . A table and some shelves were covered with manuscript papers and with worn pens and a medley of such tokens . Touchingly and awfully drawn together , he and the little mad woman were side by side and , as it were , alone . She sat on a chair holding his hand , and none of us went close to them . His voice had faded , with the old expression of his face , with his strength , with his anger , with his resistance to the wrongs that had at last subdued him . The faintest shadow of an object full of form and colour is such a picture of it as he was of the man from Shropshire whom we had spoken with before . He inclined his head to Richard and me and spoke to my guardian . “
174287	174304	174283	174283	I	0	” They shook hands earnestly , and my guardian said some words of comfort to him . “
174314	174318	174312	174312	sir	9496	” returned Gridley ; “
174399	174400	174392	174392	your	286	” “
174413	174418	174419	174419	Sir	9496	” returned my guardian . “
174425	174431	174421	174421	I	0	” with a faint smile . “
174459	174478	174421	174421	I	0	” He drew the hand Miss Flite held through her arm and brought her something nearer to him . “
174551	174552	174546	174546	Chancery	7	” “
174559	174566	174557	174557	Gridley	247	” said Miss Flite in tears . “
174571	174572	174579	174579	they	4341	” “
174689	174715	174682	174682	I	0	” Here Mr. Bucket , who was sitting in a corner by the door , good - naturedly offered such consolation as he could administer . “
174720	174727	174682	174682	I	0	” he said from his corner . “
174798	174805	174833	174833	Lord	4344	” He only shook his head . “
174812	174817	174809	174809	your	247	” said Mr. Bucket . “
174937	174938	174929	174930	Mr. Gridley	247	” “
174948	174956	174941	174941	you	0	” asked George in a low voice . “
174963	174980	174941	174941	you	0	” said Bucket in the same tone . Then resuming his encouragement , he pursued aloud : “
175215	175216	175206	175206	he	247	” “
175222	175231	175233	175233	he	247	” said the trooper in a low voice . “
175235	175240	175233	175233	he	247	” returned Bucket anxiously . “
175305	175323	175297	175297	I	0	” The roof rang with a scream from Miss Flite , which still rings in my ears . “
175330	175344	175297	175297	I	0	” she cried as he fell heavily and calmly back from before her . “
175355	175417	175420	175420	my	0	” The sun was down , the light had gradually stolen from the roof , and the shadow had crept upward . But to me the shadow of that pair , one living and one dead , fell heavier on Richard ’s departure than the darkness of the darkest night . And through Richard ’s farewell words I heard it echoed : “
175486	175908	175481	175481	Chancery	7	” CHAPTER XXV Mrs. Snagsby Sees It All There is disquietude in Cook ’s Court , Cursitor Street . Black suspicion hides in that peaceful region . The mass of Cook ’s Courtiers are in their usual state of mind , no better and no worse ; but Mr. Snagsby is changed , and his little woman knows it . For Tom - all - Alone ’s and Lincoln ’s Inn Fields persist in harnessing themselves , a pair of ungovernable coursers , to the chariot of Mr. Snagsby ’s imagination ; and Mr. Bucket drives ; and the passengers are Jo and Mr. Tulkinghorn ; and the complete equipage whirls though the law - stationery business at wild speed all round the clock . Even in the little front kitchen where the family meals are taken , it rattles away at a smoking pace from the dinner - table , when Mr. Snagsby pauses in carving the first slice of the leg of mutton baked with potatoes and stares at the kitchen wall . Mr. Snagsby can not make out what it is that he has had to do with . Something is wrong somewhere , but what something , what may come of it , to whom , when , and from which unthought of and unheard of quarter is the puzzle of his life . His remote impressions of the robes and coronets , the stars and garters , that sparkle through the surface - dust of Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s chambers ; his veneration for the mysteries presided over by that best and closest of his customers , whom all the Inns of Court , all Chancery Lane , and all the legal neighbourhood agree to hold in awe ; his remembrance of Detective Mr. Bucket with his forefinger and his confidential manner , impossible to be evaded or declined , persuade him that he is a party to some dangerous secret without knowing what it is . And it is the fearful peculiarity of this condition that , at any hour of his daily life , at any opening of the shop - door , at any pull of the bell , at any entrance of a messenger , or any delivery of a letter , the secret may take air and fire , explode , and blow up — Mr. Bucket only knows whom . For which reason , whenever a man unknown comes into the shop ( as many men unknown do ) and says , “
175914	176040	175910	175911	Mr. Snagsby	362	” or words to that innocent effect , Mr. Snagsby ’s heart knocks hard at his guilty breast . He undergoes so much from such inquiries that when they are made by boys he revenges himself by flipping at their ears over the counter and asking the young dogs what they mean by it and why they ca n’t speak out at once ? More impracticable men and boys persist in walking into Mr. Snagsby ’s sleep and terrifying him with unaccountable questions , so that often when the cock at the little dairy in Cursitor Street breaks out in his usual absurd way about the morning , Mr. Snagsby finds himself in a crisis of nightmare , with his little woman shaking him and saying “
176049	176161	176046	176047	the man	1619	” The little woman herself is not the least item in his difficulty . To know that he is always keeping a secret from her , that he has under all circumstances to conceal and hold fast a tender double tooth , which her sharpness is ever ready to twist out of his head , gives Mr. Snagsby , in her dentistical presence , much of the air of a dog who has a reservation from his master and will look anywhere rather than meet his eye . These various signs and tokens , marked by the little woman , are not lost upon her . They impel her to say , “
176169	176397	176166	176166	his	362	” And thus suspicion gets into Cook ’s Court , Cursitor Street . From suspicion to jealousy , Mrs. Snagsby finds the road as natural and short as from Cook ’s Court to Chancery Lane . And thus jealousy gets into Cook ’s Court , Cursitor Street . Once there ( and it was always lurking thereabout ) , it is very active and nimble in Mrs. Snagsby ’s breast , prompting her to nocturnal examinations of Mr. Snagsby ’s pockets ; to secret perusals of Mr. Snagsby ’s letters ; to private researches in the day book and ledger , till , cash - box , and iron safe ; to watchings at windows , listenings behind doors , and a general putting of this and that together by the wrong end . Mrs. Snagsby is so perpetually on the alert that the house becomes ghostly with creaking boards and rustling garments . The ’ prentices think somebody may have been murdered there in bygone times . Guster holds certain loose atoms of an idea ( picked up at Tooting , where they were found floating among the orphans ) that there is buried money underneath the cellar , guarded by an old man with a white beard , who can not get out for seven thousand years because he said the Lord ’s Prayer backwards . “
176402	176410	176400	176400	Nimrod	379	” Mrs. Snagsby repeatedly inquires of herself . “
176425	176466	176422	176423	that boy	10801	” Now , Nimrod being as dead as the mighty hunter whose name Mrs. Snagsby has appropriated , and the lady being unproducible , she directs her mental eye , for the present , with redoubled vigilance to the boy . “
176470	176481	176483	176484	that boy	10801	” quoth Mrs. Snagsby for the thousand and first time , “
176491	176706	176400	176400	Nimrod	379	” And there Mrs. Snagsby is seized with an inspiration . He has no respect for Mr. Chadband . No , to be sure , and he would n’t have , of course . Naturally he would n’t , under those contagious circumstances . He was invited and appointed by Mr. Chadband — why , Mrs. Snagsby heard it herself with her own ears!—to come back , and be told where he was to go , to be addressed by Mr. Chadband ; and he never came ! Why did he never come ? Because he was told not to come . Who told him not to come ? Who ? Ha , ha ! Mrs. Snagsby sees it all . But happily ( and Mrs. Snagsby tightly shakes her head and tightly smiles ) that boy was met by Mr. Chadband yesterday in the streets ; and that boy , as affording a subject which Mr. Chadband desires to improve for the spiritual delight of a select congregation , was seized by Mr. Chadband and threatened with being delivered over to the police unless he showed the reverend gentleman where he lived and unless he entered into , and fulfilled , an undertaking to appear in Cook ’s Court to - morrow night , “
176715	177044	176400	176400	Nimrod	379	” Mrs. Snagsby repeats for mere emphasis with another tight smile and another tight shake of her head ; and to - morrow night that boy will be here , and to - morrow night Mrs. Snagsby will have her eye upon him and upon some one else ; and oh , you may walk a long while in your secret ways ( says Mrs. Snagsby with haughtiness and scorn ) , but you ca n’t blind ME ! Mrs. Snagsby sounds no timbrel in anybody ’s ears , but holds her purpose quietly , and keeps her counsel . To - morrow comes , the savoury preparations for the Oil Trade come , the evening comes . Comes Mr. Snagsby in his black coat ; come the Chadbands ; come ( when the gorging vessel is replete ) the ’ prentices and Guster , to be edified ; comes at last , with his slouching head , and his shuffle backward , and his shuffle forward , and his shuffle to the right , and his shuffle to the left , and his bit of fur cap in his muddy hand , which he picks as if it were some mangy bird he had caught and was plucking before eating raw , Jo , the very , very tough subject Mr. Chadband is to improve . Mrs. Snagsby screws a watchful glance on Jo as he is brought into the little drawing - room by Guster . He looks at Mr. Snagsby the moment he comes in . Aha ! Why does he look at Mr. Snagsby ? Mr. Snagsby looks at him . Why should he do that , but that Mrs. Snagsby sees it all ? Why else should that look pass between them , why else should Mr. Snagsby be confused and cough a signal cough behind his hand ? It is as clear as crystal that Mr. Snagsby is that boy ’s father . “
177050	177065	176400	176400	Nimrod	379	” says Chadband , rising and wiping the oily exudations from his reverend visage . “
177080	177086	177071	177071	My	0	” with his fat smile , “
177148	177202	177203	177203	You	0	” Stretching forth his flabby paw , Mr. Chadband lays the same on Jo ’s arm and considers where to station him . Jo , very doubtful of his reverend friend ’s intentions and not at all clear but that something practical and painful is going to be done to him , mutters , “
177220	177221	177215	177215	You	0	” “
177228	177233	177215	177215	You	0	” says Chadband smoothly , “
177321	177391	177392	177393	My friends	1582	” Jo , apparently possessed by an impression that the reverend gentleman wants to cut his hair , shields his head with both arms and is got into the required position with great difficulty and every possible manifestation of reluctance . When he is at last adjusted like a lay - figure , Mr. Chadband , retiring behind the table , holds up his bear’s - paw and says , “
177395	177591	177392	177393	My friends	1582	” This is the signal for a general settlement of the audience . The ’ prentices giggle internally and nudge each other . Guster falls into a staring and vacant state , compounded of a stunned admiration of Mr. Chadband and pity for the friendless outcast whose condition touches her nearly . Mrs. Snagsby silently lays trains of gunpowder . Mrs. Chadband composes herself grimly by the fire and warms her knees , finding that sensation favourable to the reception of eloquence . It happens that Mr. Chadband has a pulpit habit of fixing some member of his congregation with his eye and fatly arguing his points with that particular person , who is understood to be expected to be moved to an occasional grunt , groan , gasp , or other audible expression of inward working , which expression of inward working , being echoed by some elderly lady in the next pew and so communicated like a game of forfeits through a circle of the more fermentable sinners present , serves the purpose of parliamentary cheering and gets Mr. Chadband ’s steam up . From mere force of habit , Mr. Chadband in saying “
177595	177624	177625	177625	We	4379	” has rested his eye on Mr. Snagsby and proceeds to make that ill - starred stationer , already sufficiently confused , the immediate recipient of his discourse . “
177634	177638	177639	177640	a Gentile	4381	” says Chadband , “
177678	177720	177669	177669	We	4379	” and Mr. Chadband , untwisting the point with his dirty thumb - nail , bestows an oily smile on Mr. Snagsby , signifying that he will throw him an argumentative back - fall presently if he be not already down , “
177773	177841	177771	177771	he	0	” Mr. Chadband states the question as if he were propounding an entirely new riddle of much ingenuity and merit to Mr. Snagsby and entreating him not to give it up . Mr. Snagsby , greatly perplexed by the mysterious look he received just now from his little woman — at about the period when Mr. Chadband mentioned the word parents — is tempted into modestly remarking , “
177853	177865	177847	177847	I	0	” On which interruption Mrs. Chadband glares and Mrs. Snagsby says , “
177869	177870	177871	177871	I	0	” “
177876	177880	177871	177871	I	0	” says Chadband ; “
177902	177903	177871	177871	I	0	” “
177908	177913	177871	177871	I	0	” from Mrs. Snagsby . “
177998	178050	177989	177989	I	0	” Mr. Chadband draws back his head and pauses , but Mr. Snagsby is not to be lured on to his destruction again . Mr. Chadband , leaning forward over the table , pierces what he has got to follow directly into Mr. Snagsby with the thumb - nail already mentioned . “
178054	178058	178140	178140	I	0	” says Chadband , “
178086	178113	178084	178084	Terewth	530	” Mr. Chadband draws himself up again and looks triumphantly at Mr. Snagsby as if he would be glad to know how he feels after that . “
178117	178126	178084	178084	Terewth	530	” says Mr. Chadband , hitting him again . “
178243	178330	178331	178332	My friends	1582	” The present effect of this flight of oratory — much admired for its general power by Mr. Chadband ’s followers — being not only to make Mr. Chadband unpleasantly warm , but to represent the innocent Mr. Snagsby in the light of a determined enemy to virtue , with a forehead of brass and a heart of adamant , that unfortunate tradesman becomes yet more disconcerted and is in a very advanced state of low spirits and false position when Mr. Chadband accidentally finishes him . “
178334	178372	178331	178332	My friends	1582	” he resumes after dabbing his fat head for some time — and it smokes to such an extent that he seems to light his pocket - handkerchief at it , which smokes , too , after every dab—“to
178410	178423	178406	178408	my young friends	9746	” suddenly addressing the ’ prentices and Guster , to their consternation , “
178522	178523	178514	178514	my	0	” “
178528	178533	178514	178514	my	0	” from Mrs. Snagsby . “
178538	178548	178514	178514	my	0	” A shiver in the negative from Mrs. Snagsby . “
178553	178569	178514	178514	my	0	” A shake of the head from Mrs. Snagsby — very long and very tight . “
178704	178748	178751	178753	my juvenile friends	4411	” If Mr. Snagsby could withstand his little woman ’s look as it enters at his eyes , the windows of his soul , and searches the whole tenement , he were other than the man he is . He cowers and droops . “
178755	178786	178751	178753	my juvenile friends	4411	” says Chadband , descending to the level of their comprehension with a very obtrusive demonstration in his greasily meek smile of coming a long way downstairs for the purpose , “
178849	178855	178865	178865	he	4412	” Mrs. Snagsby in tears . “
178894	178900	178892	178892	Terewth	530	” Mrs. Snagsby sobbing loudly . “
178909	178918	178892	178892	Terewth	530	” said Chadband , stimulated by the sound , “
179004	179333	179002	179002	Terewth	530	” Mrs. Snagsby replies by delivering herself a prey to spasms , not an unresisting prey , but a crying and a tearing one , so that Cook ’s Court re - echoes with her shrieks . Finally , becoming cataleptic , she has to be carried up the narrow staircase like a grand piano . After unspeakable suffering , productive of the utmost consternation , she is pronounced , by expresses from the bedroom , free from pain , though much exhausted , in which state of affairs Mr. Snagsby , trampled and crushed in the piano - forte removal , and extremely timid and feeble , ventures to come out from behind the door in the drawing - room . All this time Jo has been standing on the spot where he woke up , ever picking his cap and putting bits of fur in his mouth . He spits them out with a remorseful air , for he feels that it is in his nature to be an unimprovable reprobate and that it ’s no good HIS trying to keep awake , for HE wo n’t never know nothink . Though it may be , Jo , that there is a history so interesting and affecting even to minds as near the brutes as thine , recording deeds done on this earth for common men , that if the Chadbands , removing their own persons from the light , would but show it thee in simple reverence , would but leave it unimproved , would but regard it as being eloquent enough without their modest aid — it might hold thee awake , and thou might learn from it yet ! Jo never heard of any such book . Its compilers and the Reverend Chadband are all one to him , except that he knows the Reverend Chadband and would rather run away from him for an hour than hear him talk for five minutes . “
179344	179348	179349	179350	Mr. Snagsby	362	” thinks Jo . “
179364	179435	179349	179350	Mr. Snagsby	362	” And downstairs he shuffles . But downstairs is the charitable Guster , holding by the handrail of the kitchen stairs and warding off a fit , as yet doubtfully , the same having been induced by Mrs. Snagsby ’s screaming . She has her own supper of bread and cheese to hand to Jo , with whom she ventures to interchange a word or so for the first time . “
179445	179449	179442	179443	poor boy	4426	” says Guster . “
179454	179458	179452	179452	mum	4427	” says Jo . “
179463	179464	179460	179460	you	4427	” “
179467	179471	179460	179460	you	4427	” says Jo . “
179484	179537	179538	179538	I	0	” Jo stops in the middle of a bite and looks petrified . For this orphan charge of the Christian saint whose shrine was at Tooting has patted him on the shoulder , and it is the first time in his life that any decent hand has been so laid upon him . “
179545	179549	179538	179538	I	0	” says Jo . “
179558	179584	179585	179585	Jo	389	” cries Guster . She is repressing symptoms favourable to the fit when she seems to take alarm at something and vanishes down the stairs . “
179587	179602	179585	179585	Jo	389	” whispers the law - stationer softly as the boy lingers on the step . “
179610	179611	179607	179608	Mr. Snagsby	362	” “
179664	179665	179655	179655	You	389	” “
179672	180442	179666	179666	I	0	” And so , good night . A ghostly shade , frilled and night - capped , follows the law - stationer to the room he came from and glides higher up . And henceforth he begins , go where he will , to be attended by another shadow than his own , hardly less constant than his own , hardly less quiet than his own . And into whatsoever atmosphere of secrecy his own shadow may pass , let all concerned in the secrecy beware ! For the watchful Mrs. Snagsby is there too — bone of his bone , flesh of his flesh , shadow of his shadow . CHAPTER XXVI Sharpshooters Wintry morning , looking with dull eyes and sallow face upon the neighbourhood of Leicester Square , finds its inhabitants unwilling to get out of bed . Many of them are not early risers at the brightest of times , being birds of night who roost when the sun is high and are wide awake and keen for prey when the stars shine out . Behind dingy blind and curtain , in upper story and garret , skulking more or less under false names , false hair , false titles , false jewellery , and false histories , a colony of brigands lie in their first sleep . Gentlemen of the green - baize road who could discourse from personal experience of foreign galleys and home treadmills ; spies of strong governments that eternally quake with weakness and miserable fear , broken traitors , cowards , bullies , gamesters , shufflers , swindlers , and false witnesses ; some not unmarked by the branding - iron beneath their dirty braid ; all with more cruelty in them than was in Nero , and more crime than is in Newgate . For howsoever bad the devil can be in fustian or smock - frock ( and he can be very bad in both ) , he is a more designing , callous , and intolerable devil when he sticks a pin in his shirt - front , calls himself a gentleman , backs a card or colour , plays a game or so of billiards , and knows a little about bills and promissory notes , than in any other form he wears . And in such form Mr. Bucket shall find him , when he will , still pervading the tributary channels of Leicester Square . But the wintry morning wants him not and wakes him not . It wakes Mr. George of the shooting gallery and his familiar . They arise , roll up and stow away their mattresses . Mr. George , having shaved himself before a looking - glass of minute proportions , then marches out , bare - headed and bare - chested , to the pump in the little yard and anon comes back shining with yellow soap , friction , drifting rain , and exceedingly cold water . As he rubs himself upon a large jack - towel , blowing like a military sort of diver just come up , his hair curling tighter and tighter on his sunburnt temples the more he rubs it so that it looks as if it never could be loosened by any less coercive instrument than an iron rake or a curry - comb — as he rubs , and puffs , and polishes , and blows , turning his head from side to side the more conveniently to excoriate his throat , and standing with his body well bent forward to keep the wet from his martial legs , Phil , on his knees lighting a fire , looks round as if it were enough washing for him to see all that done , and sufficient renovation for one day to take in the superfluous health his master throws off . When Mr. George is dry , he goes to work to brush his head with two hard brushes at once , to that unmerciful degree that Phil , shouldering his way round the gallery in the act of sweeping it , winks with sympathy . This chafing over , the ornamental part of Mr. George ’s toilet is soon performed . He fills his pipe , lights it , and marches up and down smoking , as his custom is , while Phil , raising a powerful odour of hot rolls and coffee , prepares breakfast . He smokes gravely and marches in slow time . Perhaps this morning ’s pipe is devoted to the memory of Gridley in his grave . “
180448	180461	180446	180446	Phil	509	” says George of the shooting gallery after several turns in silence , “
180471	180493	180462	180462	you	509	” Phil , by the by , said as much in a tone of surprise as he scrambled out of bed . “
180498	180499	180462	180462	you	509	” “
180505	180506	180507	180507	I	0	” “
180517	180523	180507	180507	I	0	” said Phil , considering . “
180533	180534	180526	180526	you	509	” “
180550	180557	180541	180541	I	0	” says Phil after further consideration . “
180567	180568	180569	180569	They	4437	” “
180580	180759	180569	180569	They	4437	” says Phil . The master resumes his march , and the man resumes his preparation of breakfast . It is not necessarily a lengthened preparation , being limited to the setting forth of very simple breakfast requisites for two and the broiling of a rasher of bacon at the fire in the rusty grate ; but as Phil has to sidle round a considerable part of the gallery for every object he wants , and never brings two objects at once , it takes time under the circumstances . At length the breakfast is ready . Phil announcing it , Mr. George knocks the ashes out of his pipe on the hob , stands his pipe itself in the chimney corner , and sits down to the meal . When he has helped himself , Phil follows suit , sitting at the extreme end of the little oblong table and taking his plate on his knees . Either in humility , or to hide his blackened hands , or because it is his natural manner of eating . “
180763	180774	180569	180569	They	4437	” says Mr. George , plying his knife and fork ; “
180790	180791	180779	180779	you	4439	” “
180798	180807	180792	180792	I	0	” says Phil , contentedly eating his breakfast . “
180811	180812	180816	180816	commander	4443	” “
180818	180822	180816	180816	commander	4443	” returns Phil . “
180827	180828	180829	180829	I	0	” “
180837	180841	180829	180829	I	0	” says Phil ; “
180856	180881	180849	180849	They	4441	” Governor and commander are interchangeable terms with Phil , expressive of the same respect and deference and applicable to nobody but Mr. George . “
180891	180892	180889	180889	Phil	509	” “
180899	180900	180894	180894	you	0	” “
180907	180937	180894	180894	you	0	” Phil elevates his one eyebrow , and after respectfully staring at his master to express interest , swallows a great gulp of coffee , still staring at him . “
180951	180956	180946	180946	I	0	” says Mr. George . “
181004	181005	181006	181006	She	4450	” “
181017	181021	181010	181013	a fine old lady	1870	” Phil observes . “
181036	181041	181074	181074	guv’ner	511	” says Mr. George . “
181066	181067	181049	181049	she	4450	” “
181076	181080	181074	181074	guv’ner	511	” inquires Phil . “
181095	181100	181093	181093	her	4450	” says the trooper . “
181142	181148	181126	181126	you	4455	” Phil shakes his head . “
181156	181157	181150	181150	you	0	” “
181172	181176	181167	181167	I	0	” says Phil . “
181186	181187	181167	181167	I	0	” “
181195	181199	181193	181193	commander	4443	” says Phil , “
181225	181226	181212	181212	I	0	” “
181234	181250	181230	181230	you	0	” asks the trooper , pausing as he conveys his smoking saucer to his lips . “
181260	181264	181251	181251	I	0	” says Phil . “
181282	181300	181304	181305	the deuce	4460	” Mr. George , slowly putting down his saucer without tasting its contents , is laughingly beginning , “
181309	181324	181304	181305	the deuce	4460	” when he stops , seeing that Phil is counting on his dirty fingers . “
181330	181334	181304	181305	the deuce	4460	” says Phil , “
181533	181534	181523	181523	I	0	” “
181537	181546	181523	181523	I	0	” says Mr. George , resuming his breakfast . “
181553	181554	181555	181555	Drink	534	” “
181580	181585	181576	181576	I	0	” Phil replies mysteriously . “
181599	181600	181603	181603	commander	4443	” “
181765	181766	181767	181767	They	4473	” “
181782	181791	181772	181772	You	0	” says the trooper with a pleasant smile . “
181796	181804	181772	181772	You	0	” returns Phil , shaking his head . “
181985	182014	182055	182055	guv’ner	4311	” Resigning himself to which condition with a perfectly satisfied manner , Phil begs the favour of another cup of coffee . While drinking it , he says , “
182036	182037	182033	182033	You	4487	” “
182051	182052	182043	182043	You	509	” “
182061	182062	182043	182043	You	509	” “
182072	182073	182068	182068	your	509	” “
182080	182086	182068	182068	your	509	” exclaims Phil , excited . “
182093	182094	182068	182068	your	509	” “
182103	182111	182068	182068	your	509	” cries Phil , still more excited . “
182120	182121	182123	182123	you	4487	” “
182129	182148	182126	182126	you	4487	” cries Phil , putting down his cup and saucer and hastily removing his plate from his knees , “
182320	182337	182318	182318	commander	4443	” cries Phil , who has started from his chair and unaccountably begun to sidle away . “
182448	182564	182434	182434	I	0	” With this unexpected speech , energetically delivered and accompanied by action illustrative of the various exercises referred to , Phil Squod shoulders his way round three sides of the gallery , and abruptly tacking off at his commander , makes a butt at him with his head , intended to express devotion to his service . He then begins to clear away the breakfast . Mr. George , after laughing cheerfully and clapping him on the shoulder , assists in these arrangements and helps to get the gallery into business order . That done , he takes a turn at the dumb - bells , and afterwards weighing himself and opining that he is getting “
182568	182770	182434	182434	I	0	” engages with great gravity in solitary broadsword practice . Meanwhile Phil has fallen to work at his usual table , where he screws and unscrews , and cleans , and files , and whistles into small apertures , and blackens himself more and more , and seems to do and undo everything that can be done and undone about a gun . Master and man are at length disturbed by footsteps in the passage , where they make an unusual sound , denoting the arrival of unusual company . These steps , advancing nearer and nearer to the gallery , bring into it a group at first sight scarcely reconcilable with any day in the year but the fifth of November . It consists of a limp and ugly figure carried in a chair by two bearers and attended by a lean female with a face like a pinched mask , who might be expected immediately to recite the popular verses commemorative of the time when they did contrive to blow Old England up alive but for her keeping her lips tightly and defiantly closed as the chair is put down . At which point the figure in it gasping , “
182783	182786	182779	182779	I	0	” adds , “
182799	182828	182829	182830	Mr. George	500	” Mr. George then descries , in the procession , the venerable Mr. Smallweed out for an airing , attended by his granddaughter Judy as body - guard . “
182836	182862	182829	182830	Mr. George	500	” says Grandfather Smallweed , removing his right arm from the neck of one of his bearers , whom he has nearly throttled coming along , “
182878	182879	182867	182867	You	500	” “
182896	182901	182890	182891	your friend	2692	” returns Mr. George . “
182908	182913	182914	182914	I	0	” pants Mr. Smallweed . “
182952	182953	182950	182950	sir	9496	” “
182959	182964	182965	182965	I	0	” says Mr. George . “
182972	182973	182967	182967	you	0	” “
182985	182994	182974	182974	You	0	” Mr. Smallweed takes him by both hands . “
183017	183018	183019	183019	Hum	537	” “
183026	183031	183021	183021	She	493	” mutters Mr. George . “
183082	183106	183108	183112	the driver of the cab	4515	” says Grandfather Smallweed , alluding to the bearer , who has been in danger of strangulation and who withdraws adjusting his windpipe , “
183131	183136	183137	183137	we	4518	” the other bearer , “
183186	183203	183183	183184	this person	2407	” Grandfather Smallweed refers to Phil with a glance of considerable terror and a half - subdued “
183212	183279	183210	183210	me	0	” Nor in his apprehension , on the surface of things , without some reason , for Phil , who has never beheld the apparition in the black - velvet cap before , has stopped short with a gun in his hand with much of the air of a dead shot intent on picking Mr. Smallweed off as an ugly old bird of the crow species . “
183285	183290	183210	183210	me	0	” says Grandfather Smallweed , “
183308	183343	183210	183210	me	0	” The person , who is one of those extraordinary specimens of human fungus that spring up spontaneously in the western streets of London , ready dressed in an old red jacket , with a “
183345	183377	183378	183379	My dear	9540	” for holding horses and calling coaches , received his twopence with anything but transport , tosses the money into the air , catches it over - handed , and retires . “
183383	183388	183390	183390	you	500	” says Grandfather Smallweed , “
183427	183467	183425	183425	me	0	” His closing exclamation is jerked out of the venerable gentleman by the suddenness with which Mr. Squod , like a genie , catches him up , chair and all , and deposits him on the hearth - stone . “
183471	183478	183425	183425	me	0	” says Mr. Smallweed , panting . “
183527	183587	183519	183519	I	0	” which indeed is testified to the noses of all present by the smell of his worsted stockings . The gentle Judy , having backed her grandfather a little way from the fire , and having shaken him up as usual , and having released his overshadowed eye from its black - velvet extinguisher , Mr. Smallweed again says , “
183596	183613	183593	183594	O Lord	4533	” and looking about and meeting Mr. George ’s glance , again stretches out both hands . “
183658	183668	183652	183652	you	3800	” adds Grandfather Smallweed , very ill at ease . “
183678	183679	183652	183652	you	3800	” “
183705	183706	183699	183699	he	4532	” “
183715	183722	183707	183707	He	4532	” says Mr. George , smiling . “
183747	183753	183741	183741	he	4532	” the old gentleman returns . “
183784	183819	183769	183769	you	500	” Obedient to a nod from the trooper , Phil retires , empty - handed , to the other end of the gallery . Mr. Smallweed , reassured , falls to rubbing his legs . “
183829	183849	183826	183827	Mr. George	500	” he says to the trooper , squarely standing faced about towards him with his broadsword in his hand . “
183858	183869	183826	183827	Mr. George	500	” Mr. George answers with a cool nod , adding , “
183884	183885	183873	183873	You	500	” “
183894	183900	183891	183892	Mr. George	500	” returns the venerable grandfather . “
183907	183908	183901	183901	You	500	” “
183915	183920	183921	183923	My dear friend	3800	” says Mr. George . “
183953	183976	183951	183951	him	3800	” says the excellent old gentleman apart to Judy as the trooper takes a step or two away to lay it aside . “
184011	184042	184004	184004	he	3800	” Mr. George , returning , folds his arms , and looking down at the old man , sliding every moment lower and lower in his chair , says quietly , “
184047	184048	184004	184004	he	3800	” “
184051	184064	184004	184004	he	3800	” cries Mr. Smallweed , rubbing his hands with an artful chuckle . “
184079	184080	184004	184004	he	3800	” “
184085	184380	184004	184004	he	3800	” says Mr. George , who with great composure sets his chair in the chimney - corner , takes his pipe from the grate , fills it and lights it , and falls to smoking peacefully . This tends to the discomfiture of Mr. Smallweed , who finds it so difficult to resume his object , whatever it may be , that he becomes exasperated and secretly claws the air with an impotent vindictiveness expressive of an intense desire to tear and rend the visage of Mr. George . As the excellent old gentleman ’s nails are long and leaden , and his hands lean and veinous , and his eyes green and watery ; and , over and above this , as he continues , while he claws , to slide down in his chair and to collapse into a shapeless bundle , he becomes such a ghastly spectacle , even in the accustomed eyes of Judy , that that young virgin pounces at him with something more than the ardour of affection and so shakes him up and pats and pokes him in divers parts of his body , but particularly in that part which the science of self - defence would call his wind , that in his grievous distress he utters enforced sounds like a paviour ’s rammer . When Judy has by these means set him up again in his chair , with a white face and a frosty nose ( but still clawing ) , she stretches out her weazen forefinger and gives Mr. George one poke in the back . The trooper raising his head , she makes another poke at her esteemed grandfather , and having thus brought them together , stares rigidly at the fire . “
184397	184406	184407	184409	My dear friend	3800	” chatters Grandfather Smallweed , swallowing his rage . “
184411	184417	184407	184409	My dear friend	3800	” ( still clawing ) . “
184423	184428	184418	184418	I	0	” says Mr. George . “
184488	184501	184480	184480	you	3800	” says the trooper , putting his pipe between his lips again , “
184516	184539	184505	184505	I	0	” And he inflates his broad chest to its utmost extent as if to assure himself that he is not smothered yet . “
184551	184556	184541	184541	you	3800	” continues Mr. George , “
184602	184622	184623	184623	You	3800	” The blooming Judy , without removing her gaze from the fire , gives her grandfather one ghostly poke . “
184647	184659	184660	184660	I	0	” says Mr. George with his eyes musingly fixed on Judy , “
184665	184666	184667	184667	She	3467	” “
184679	184684	184667	184667	She	3467	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
184716	184727	184693	184694	Mr. George	500	” ( snarling and looking unconsciously for the cushion ) , “
184737	184738	184729	184729	I	0	” “
184741	184755	184729	184729	I	0	” returns the trooper , wheeling his chair to face the old man . “
184759	184760	184729	184729	I	0	” “
184781	184782	184784	184784	he	4559	” “
184786	184791	184784	184784	he	4559	” says Mr. George . “
184799	184800	184784	184784	he	4559	” “
184805	184812	184784	184784	he	4559	” Grandfather Smallweed rubs his legs . “
184841	184842	184844	184844	they	2867	” “
184846	184851	184844	184844	they	2867	” returns Mr. George . “
184867	184868	184871	184871	he	2692	” “
184881	184882	184879	184879	you	3800	” “
184923	184924	184908	184910	The young gentleman	1237	” “
184948	184959	184946	184946	sir	9496	” remonstrates Grandfather Smallweed , cunningly rubbing his spare legs . “
185041	185104	185024	185025	Mr. George	500	” says Grandfather Smallweed , turning up his velvet cap and scratching his ear like a monkey . Mr. George , who has put aside his pipe and sits with an arm on his chair - back , beats a tattoo on the ground with his right foot as if he were not particularly pleased with the turn the conversation has taken . “
185114	185119	185136	185137	Mr. George	500	” resumes Mr. Smallweed . “
185146	185147	185136	185137	Mr. George	500	” “
185156	185173	185174	185175	What captain	4580	” asks Mr. George , pausing with a frown in stroking the recollection of his moustache . “
185177	185178	185179	185180	Our captain	4582	” “
185191	185192	185188	185189	Captain Hawdon	508	” “
185202	185222	185223	185223	You	500	” says Mr. George with a low whistle as he sees both grandfather and granddaughter looking hard at him . “
185245	185246	185247	185247	My	0	” “
185251	185257	185258	185258	I	0	” returns the old man , “

185293	185298	185278	185278	my	0	” observes Mr. George . “
185308	185320	185321	185321	Bosh	540	” inquires the old man with his hand to his ear . “
185323	185324	185321	185321	Bosh	540	” “
185327	185332	185321	185321	Bosh	540	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
185372	185373	185363	185363	you	500	” “
185377	185382	185363	185363	you	500	” says Mr. George . “
185388	185389	185363	185363	you	500	” “
185398	185413	185393	185394	a lawyer	3254	” says Mr. George , folding his arms with an air of confirmed resolution . “
185464	185465	185448	185448	He	4588	” “
185468	185469	185448	185448	He	4588	” “
185537	185538	185532	185532	you	500	” “
185544	185558	185541	185542	Mr. Smallweed	475	” says Mr. George again after going through the ceremony with some stiffness . “
185585	185615	185565	185565	I	0	” says the old man , making a curse out of one of his few remembrances of a prayer and squeezing up his velvet cap between his angry hands , “
185631	185654	185655	185655	you	500	” breathlessly recovering his mildness of speech as Judy re - adjusts the cap on his skittle - ball of a head , “
185687	185688	185706	185706	I	0	” “
185695	185702	185706	185706	I	0	” says the trooper , pondering ; “
185709	185710	185711	185711	My	0	” “
185715	185716	185711	185711	My	0	” “
185724	185725	185711	185711	My	0	” “
185728	185737	185711	185711	My	0	” says Grandfather Smallweed , crest - fallen . “
185761	185762	185763	185763	Sir	9496	” “
185782	185783	185776	185776	I	0	” “
185787	185796	185797	185797	I	0	” says the trooper , shaking his head . “
185806	185807	185797	185797	I	0	” “
185829	185850	185851	185851	I	0	” urges Grandfather Smallweed , pulling out a lean old silver watch with hands like the leg of a skeleton . “
185888	185889	185878	185878	you	500	” “
185892	185897	185878	185878	you	500	” says he gravely . “
185918	185919	185913	185913	I	0	” “
185975	185984	185986	185986	I	0	” says Grandfather Smallweed , lowering his tone , “
186007	186008	185998	185998	you	3800	” “
186025	186026	186018	186018	I	0	” “
186036	186037	186031	186032	Mr. George	500	” “
186064	186177	186039	186039	you	3800	” Mr. George inquires , getting his hat and thick wash - leather gloves . This pleasantry so tickles Mr. Smallweed that he laughs , long and low , before the fire . But ever while he laughs , he glances over his paralytic shoulder at Mr. George and eagerly watches him as he unlocks the padlock of a homely cupboard at the distant end of the gallery , looks here and there upon the higher shelves , and ultimately takes something out with a rustling of paper , folds it , and puts it in his breast . Then Judy pokes Mr. Smallweed once , and Mr. Smallweed pokes Judy once . “
186182	186190	186191	186191	Phil	509	” says the trooper , coming back . “
186209	186210	186193	186193	you	509	” “
186223	186228	186229	186229	He	4607	” says Mr. Smallweed . “
186248	186464	186236	186236	you	509	” Phil makes no reply , but seizing the chair and its load , sidles away , tightly hugged by the now speechless Mr. Smallweed , and bolts along the passage as if he had an acceptable commission to carry the old gentleman to the nearest volcano . His shorter trust , however , terminating at the cab , he deposits him there ; and the fair Judy takes her place beside him , and the chair embellishes the roof , and Mr. George takes the vacant place upon the box . Mr. George is quite confounded by the spectacle he beholds from time to time as he peeps into the cab through the window behind him , where the grim Judy is always motionless , and the old gentleman with his cap over one eye is always sliding off the seat into the straw and looking upward at him out of his other eye with a helpless expression of being jolted in the back . CHAPTER XXVII More Old Soldiers Than One Mr. George has not far to ride with folded arms upon the box , for their destination is Lincoln ’s Inn Fields . When the driver stops his horses , Mr. George alights , and looking in at the window , says , “
186476	186477	186474	186474	he	4611	” “
186492	186493	186489	186490	Mr. George	500	” “
186523	186647	186517	186517	he	4611	” There ensues the carrying of Mr. Smallweed upstairs , which is done to perfection with the trooper ’s help . He is borne into Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s great room and deposited on the Turkey rug before the fire . Mr. Tulkinghorn is not within at the present moment but will be back directly . The occupant of the pew in the hall , having said thus much , stirs the fire and leaves the triumvirate to warm themselves . Mr. George is mightily curious in respect of the room . He looks up at the painted ceiling , looks round at the old law - books , contemplates the portraits of the great clients , reads aloud the names on the boxes . “
186656	186662	186653	186653	Baronet	266	” Mr. George reads thoughtfully . “
186674	186700	186701	186703	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” Mr. George stands looking at these boxes a long while — as if they were pictures — and comes back to the fire repeating , “
186715	186716	186701	186703	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” “
186726	186735	186723	186724	Mr. George	500	” whispers Grandfather Smallweed , rubbing his legs . “
186739	186740	186743	186743	you	4614	” “
186754	186755	186756	186757	This gentleman	3062	” “
186762	186763	186759	186760	this gentleman	3062	” “
186788	186797	186743	186743	you	4614	” says Mr. George , looking round again . “
186805	186894	186743	186743	you	4614	” This reply is cut short by Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s arrival . There is no change in him , of course . Rustily drest , with his spectacles in his hand , and their very case worn threadbare . In manner , close and dry . In voice , husky and low . In face , watchful behind a blind ; habitually not uncensorious and contemptuous perhaps . The peerage may have warmer worshippers and faithfuller believers than Mr. Tulkinghorn , after all , if everything were known . “
186904	186912	186898	186899	Mr. Smallweed	475	” he says as he comes in . “
186927	186963	186925	186925	sergeant	4620	” As Mr. Tulkinghorn takes off his gloves and puts them in his hat , he looks with half - closed eyes across the room to where the trooper stands and says within himself perchance , “
186971	186972	186964	186964	You	475	” “
186978	187005	186976	186976	sergeant	4620	” he repeats as he comes to his table , which is set on one side of the fire , and takes his easy - chair . “
187016	187056	186976	186976	sergeant	4620	” Mr. Tulkinghorn warms before the bars , alternately , the palms and knuckles of his hands and looks ( from behind that blind which is always down ) at the trio sitting in a little semicircle before him . “
187066	187077	187078	187079	Mr. Smallweed	475	” ( as perhaps he can in two senses ) , “
187081	187099	187078	187079	Mr. Smallweed	475	” The old gentleman is newly shaken up by Judy to bear his part in the conversation . “
187112	187113	187106	187107	the sergeant	4619	” “
187118	187133	187116	187116	sir	9496	” returns Mr. Smallweed , very servile to the lawyer ’s wealth and influence . “
187144	187145	187137	187138	the sergeant	4619	” “
187149	187162	187146	187147	Mr. George	500	” says Grandfather Smallweed with a tremulous wave of his shrivelled hand , “
187170	187212	187168	187168	sir	9496	” Mr. George salutes the gentleman but otherwise sits bolt upright and profoundly silent — very forward in his chair , as if the full complement of regulation appendages for a field - day hung about him . Mr. Tulkinghorn proceeds , “
187224	187225	187222	187222	George	500	” “
187232	187233	187230	187230	Sir	9496	” “
187241	187242	187236	187236	you	500	” “
187250	187255	187236	187236	you	500	” returns the trooper , “
187266	187267	187263	187263	YOU	9496	” “
187276	187277	187269	187269	you	500	” “
187287	187304	187285	187285	sir	9496	” This is so very trying to Mr. Smallweed ’s temper that he suddenly breaks out with “
187311	187334	187305	187305	You	500	” and as suddenly asks pardon of Mr. Tulkinghorn , excusing himself for this slip of the tongue by saying to Judy , “
187345	187346	187350	187350	sergeant	4620	” “
187352	187370	187350	187350	sergeant	4620	” Mr. Tulkinghorn resumes as he leans on one side of his chair and crosses his legs , “
187432	187433	187436	187436	sir	9496	” “
187442	187450	187436	187436	sir	9496	” says Mr. George with military brevity . “
187530	187531	187526	187526	I	0	” “
187538	187548	187526	187526	I	0	” cries Grandfather Smallweed , screwing up his eyes . “
187592	187623	187585	187585	I	0	” Mr. George sits squared in exactly the same attitude , looks at the painted ceiling , and says never a word . The irascible Mr. Smallweed scratches the air . “
187628	187641	187645	187645	you	500	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn in his methodical , subdued , uninterested way , “
187654	187655	187645	187645	you	500	” “
187670	187675	187659	187659	I	0	” repeats Mr. George . “
187689	187690	187681	187681	you	500	” “
187706	187711	187704	187704	sir	9496	” repeats Mr. George . “
187727	187743	187714	187714	you	500	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , suddenly handing him some sheets of written paper tied together . “
187757	187828	187839	187839	you	9496	” repeats Mr. George . All three repetitions Mr. George pronounces in a mechanical manner , looking straight at Mr. Tulkinghorn ; nor does he so much as glance at the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , that has been given to him for his inspection ( though he still holds it in his hand ) , but continues to look at the lawyer with an air of troubled meditation . “
187831	187836	187839	187839	you	9496	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
187842	187843	187839	187839	you	9496	” “
187848	187859	187846	187846	sir	9496	” replies Mr. George , rising erect and looking immense , “
187877	187887	187865	187865	you	9496	” Mr. Tulkinghorn , outwardly quite undisturbed , demands , “
187891	187892	187865	187865	you	9496	” “
187897	187902	187865	187865	you	9496	” returns the trooper . “
187991	188002	187988	187988	my	0	” says Mr. George , looking round upon the company , “
188008	188093	188094	188096	my dear friend	3800	” With that , he takes three strides forward to replace the papers on the lawyer ’s table and three strides backward to resume his former station , where he stands perfectly upright , now looking at the ground and now at the painted ceiling , with his hands behind him as if to prevent himself from accepting any other document whatever . Under this provocation , Mr. Smallweed ’s favourite adjective of disparagement is so close to his tongue that he begins the words “
188097	188101	188186	188192	the best judge of your own interest	4651	” with the monosyllable “
188104	188183	188186	188192	the best judge of your own interest	4651	” thus converting the possessive pronoun into brimmy and appearing to have an impediment in his speech . Once past this difficulty , however , he exhorts his dear friend in the tenderest manner not to be rash , but to do what so eminent a gentleman requires , and to do it with a good grace , confident that it must be unobjectionable as well as profitable . Mr. Tulkinghorn merely utters an occasional sentence , as , “
188196	188197	188190	188190	your	4650	” “
188207	188208	188210	188210	yourself	4650	” “
188215	188216	188213	188213	yourself	4650	” “
188229	188303	188304	188304	I	0	” These he utters with an appearance of perfect indifference as he looks over the papers on his table and prepares to write a letter . Mr. George looks distrustfully from the painted ceiling to the ground , from the ground to Mr. Smallweed , from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Tulkinghorn , and from Mr. Tulkinghorn to the painted ceiling again , often in his perplexity changing the leg on which he rests . “
188311	188316	188304	188304	I	0	” says Mr. George , “
188383	188391	188356	188356	you	4650	” Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly shakes his head . “
188457	188458	188447	188447	you	4650	” “
188467	188468	188470	188470	he	508	” “
188472	188481	188470	188470	he	508	” Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly sits down to write . “
188486	188500	188484	188484	sir	9496	” says the trooper , looking into his hat after another disconcerted pause , “
188582	188595	188570	188570	I	0	” says Mr. George , passing his hand hopelessly across his brow , “
188611	188670	188671	188671	I	0	” Mr. Smallweed , hearing that this authority is an old soldier , so strongly inculcates the expediency of the trooper ’s taking counsel with him , and particularly informing him of its being a question of five guineas or more , that Mr. George engages to go and see him . Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing either way . “
188685	188690	188683	188683	sir	9496	” says the trooper , “
188723	188724	188712	188713	Mr. Smallweed	475	” “
188752	188753	188738	188738	you	9883	” “
188766	188790	188761	188761	yourself	9883	” The trooper retires to a distant part of the room and resumes his curious inspection of the boxes , strong and otherwise . “
188804	188836	188837	188837	I	0	” whispers Grandfather Smallweed , drawing the lawyer down to his level by the lapel of his coat and flashing some half - quenched green fire out of his angry eyes , “
188894	188944	188889	188889	him	3062	” This vehement conjuration the old gentleman accompanies with such a thrust at his granddaughter that it is too much for his strength , and he slips away out of his chair , drawing Mr. Tulkinghorn with him , until he is arrested by Judy , and well shaken . “
188955	188962	188952	188953	my friend	9883	” Mr. Tulkinghorn then remarks coolly . “
188996	189009	188993	188994	a grandmother	4678	” to the imperturbable Judy , who only looks at the fire , “
189115	189130	189112	189113	Mr. George	500	” says Grandfather Smallweed , winking at the lawyer hideously as he releases him , “
189143	189519	189520	189520	She	4686	” Mr. Tulkinghorn , with some shadowy sign of amusement manifesting itself through his self - possession , stands on the hearth - rug with his back to the fire , watching the disappearance of Mr. Smallweed and acknowledging the trooper ’s parting salute with one slight nod . It is more difficult to get rid of the old gentleman , Mr. George finds , than to bear a hand in carrying him downstairs , for when he is replaced in his conveyance , he is so loquacious on the subject of the guineas and retains such an affectionate hold of his button — having , in truth , a secret longing to rip his coat open and rob him — that some degree of force is necessary on the trooper ’s part to effect a separation . It is accomplished at last , and he proceeds alone in quest of his adviser . By the cloisterly Temple , and by Whitefriars ( there , not without a glance at Hanging - Sword Alley , which would seem to be something in his way ) , and by Blackfriars Bridge , and Blackfriars Road , Mr. George sedately marches to a street of little shops lying somewhere in that ganglion of roads from Kent and Surrey , and of streets from the bridges of London , centring in the far - famed elephant who has lost his castle formed of a thousand four - horse coaches to a stronger iron monster than he , ready to chop him into mince - meat any day he dares . To one of the little shops in this street , which is a musician ’s shop , having a few fiddles in the window , and some Pan ’s pipes and a tambourine , and a triangle , and certain elongated scraps of music , Mr. George directs his massive tread . And halting at a few paces from it , as he sees a soldierly looking woman , with her outer skirts tucked up , come forth with a small wooden tub , and in that tub commence a - whisking and a - splashing on the margin of the pavement , Mr. George says to himself , “
189547	189608	189609	189609	George	500	” The subject of this reflection is at all events so occupied in washing greens at present that she remains unsuspicious of Mr. George ’s approach until , lifting up herself and her tub together when she has poured the water off into the gutter , she finds him standing near her . Her reception of him is not flattering . “
189625	189668	189669	189669	I	0	” The trooper , without remarking on this welcome , follows into the musical - instrument shop , where the lady places her tub of greens upon the counter , and having shaken hands with him , rests her arms upon it . “
189672	189676	189677	189677	George	500	” she says , “
189699	189700	189691	189691	You	500	” “
189716	189717	189711	189711	I	0	” “
189723	189728	189718	189718	You	500	” says Mrs. Bagnet . “
189740	189741	189738	189738	you	500	” “
189751	189759	189748	189748	I	0	” returns the trooper good - humouredly . “
189762	189770	189748	189748	I	0	” cries Mrs. Bagnet , something shrilly . “
189802	189936	189937	189938	Mrs. Bagnet	543	” Mrs. Bagnet is not at all an ill - looking woman . Rather large - boned , a little coarse in the grain , and freckled by the sun and wind which have tanned her hair upon the forehead , but healthy , wholesome , and bright - eyed . A strong , busy , active , honest - faced woman of from forty - five to fifty . Clean , hardy , and so economically dressed ( though substantially ) that the only article of ornament of which she stands possessed appear ’s to be her wedding - ring , around which her finger has grown to be so large since it was put on that it will never come off again until it shall mingle with Mrs. Bagnet ’s dust . “
189940	189945	189937	189938	Mrs. Bagnet	543	” says the trooper , “
189969	189970	189962	189962	You	543	” “
189987	189992	189983	189983	you	543	” Mrs. Bagnet rejoins . “
190026	190027	190018	190018	SHE’D	4688	” “
190037	190047	190018	190018	SHE’D	4688	” returns the trooper half laughingly , half seriously , “
190108	190170	190105	190105	Mat	542	” Mrs. Bagnet , who seems in a virtuous way to be under little reserve with a good sort of fellow , but to be another good sort of fellow herself for that matter , receives this compliment by flicking Mr. George in the face with a head of greens and taking her tub into the little room behind the shop . “
190178	190191	190173	190173	Quebec	544	” says George , following , on invitation , into that department . “
190204	190307	190201	190202	your Bluffy	4693	” These young ladies — not supposed to have been actually christened by the names applied to them , though always so called in the family from the places of their birth in barracks — are respectively employed on three - legged stools , the younger ( some five or six years old ) in learning her letters out of a penny primer , the elder ( eight or nine perhaps ) in teaching her and sewing with great assiduity . Both hail Mr. George with acclamations as an old friend and after some kissing and romping plant their stools beside him . “
190314	190319	190311	190312	young Woolwich	546	” says Mr. George . “
190325	190350	190311	190312	young Woolwich	546	” cries Mrs. Bagnet , turning about from her saucepans ( for she is cooking dinner ) with a bright flush on her face . “
190376	190377	190364	190365	his father	10032	” “
190384	190393	190396	190396	you	4694	” cries Mr. George , slapping his thigh . “
190398	190403	190396	190396	you	4694	” says Mrs. Bagnet . “
190418	190419	190421	190421	Mat	542	” “
190437	190442	190429	190429	you	4694	” says Mr. George . “
190508	190807	190808	190808	George	500	” Mr. George is becoming thoughtful , sitting before the fire in the whitewashed room , which has a sanded floor and a barrack smell and contains nothing superfluous and has not a visible speck of dirt or dust in it , from the faces of Quebec and Malta to the bright tin pots and pannikins upon the dresser shelves — Mr. George is becoming thoughtful , sitting here while Mrs. Bagnet is busy , when Mr. Bagnet and young Woolwich opportunely come home . Mr. Bagnet is an ex - artilleryman , tall and upright , with shaggy eyebrows and whiskers like the fibres of a coco - nut , not a hair upon his head , and a torrid complexion . His voice , short , deep , and resonant , is not at all unlike the tones of the instrument to which he is devoted . Indeed there may be generally observed in him an unbending , unyielding , brass - bound air , as if he were himself the bassoon of the human orchestra . Young Woolwich is the type and model of a young drummer . Both father and son salute the trooper heartily . He saying , in due season , that he has come to advise with Mr. Bagnet , Mr. Bagnet hospitably declares that he will hear of no business until after dinner and that his friend shall not partake of his counsel without first partaking of boiled pork and greens . The trooper yielding to this invitation , he and Mr. Bagnet , not to embarrass the domestic preparations , go forth to take a turn up and down the little street , which they promenade with measured tread and folded arms , as if it were a rampart . “
190810	190815	190808	190808	George	500	” says Mr. Bagnet . “
190872	190873	190862	190864	the old girl	4707	” “
190880	190885	190874	190874	I	0	” replies the other . “
190898	190899	190886	190886	I	0	” “
190902	190914	190886	190886	I	0	” returns Mr. Bagnet in short sentences , bassoon - like . “
190960	190961	190946	190948	The old girl	4707	” “
190966	190971	190962	190962	You	500	” says Mr. George . “
190975	190979	190981	190981	you	500	” pursues Bagnet , “
191032	191033	191021	191023	the old girl	4707	” “
191045	191046	191047	191049	The old girl	4707	” “
191051	191058	191047	191049	The old girl	4707	” says Mr. Bagnet , acquiescing , “
191100	191101	191094	191094	she	4707	” “
191107	191112	191113	191113	She	4707	” exclaims Mr. George . “
191223	191241	191242	191244	The old girl	4707	” George remarks that she looks as fresh as a rose and as sound as an apple . “
191246	191253	191255	191258	a thoroughly fine woman	4725	” says Mr. Bagnet in reply , “
191299	191741	191752	191752	George	500	” Proceeding to converse on indifferent matters , they walk up and down the little street , keeping step and time , until summoned by Quebec and Malta to do justice to the pork and greens , over which Mrs. Bagnet , like a military chaplain , says a short grace . In the distribution of these comestibles , as in every other household duty , Mrs. Bagnet develops an exact system , sitting with every dish before her , allotting to every portion of pork its own portion of pot - liquor , greens , potatoes , and even mustard , and serving it out complete . Having likewise served out the beer from a can and thus supplied the mess with all things necessary , Mrs. Bagnet proceeds to satisfy her own hunger , which is in a healthy state . The kit of the mess , if the table furniture may be so denominated , is chiefly composed of utensils of horn and tin that have done duty in several parts of the world . Young Woolwich ’s knife , in particular , which is of the oyster kind , with the additional feature of a strong shutting - up movement which frequently balks the appetite of that young musician , is mentioned as having gone in various hands the complete round of foreign service . The dinner done , Mrs. Bagnet , assisted by the younger branches ( who polish their own cups and platters , knives and forks ) , makes all the dinner garniture shine as brightly as before and puts it all away , first sweeping the hearth , to the end that Mr. Bagnet and the visitor may not be retarded in the smoking of their pipes . These household cares involve much pattening and counter - pattening in the backyard and considerable use of a pail , which is finally so happy as to assist in the ablutions of Mrs. Bagnet herself . That old girl reappearing by and by , quite fresh , and sitting down to her needlework , then and only then — the greens being only then to be considered as entirely off her mind — Mr. Bagnet requests the trooper to state his case . This Mr. George does with great discretion , appearing to address himself to Mr. Bagnet , but having an eye solely on the old girl all the time , as Bagnet has himself . She , equally discreet , busies herself with her needlework . The case fully stated , Mr. Bagnet resorts to his standard artifice for the maintenance of discipline . “
191754	191758	191752	191752	George	500	” says he . “
191766	191767	191752	191752	George	500	” “
191775	191776	191768	191768	You	500	” “
191782	191786	191768	191768	You	500	” replies George , “
191791	191792	191793	191794	Old girl	4727	” “
191796	191801	191793	191794	Old girl	4727	” says Mr. Bagnet , “
191817	192059	191812	191812	him	0	” It is that he can not have too little to do with people who are too deep for him and can not be too careful of interference with matters he does not understand — that the plain rule is to do nothing in the dark , to be a party to nothing underhanded or mysterious , and never to put his foot where he can not see the ground . This , in effect , is Mr. Bagnet ’s opinion , as delivered through the old girl , and it so relieves Mr. George ’s mind by confirming his own opinion and banishing his doubts that he composes himself to smoke another pipe on that exceptional occasion and to have a talk over old times with the whole Bagnet family , according to their various ranges of experience . Through these means it comes to pass that Mr. George does not again rise to his full height in that parlour until the time is drawing on when the bassoon and fife are expected by a British public at the theatre ; and as it takes time even then for Mr. George , in his domestic character of Bluffy , to take leave of Quebec and Malta and insinuate a sponsorial shilling into the pocket of his godson with felicitations on his success in life , it is dark when Mr. George again turns his face towards Lincoln ’s Inn Fields . “
192064	192072	191812	191812	him	0	” he ruminates as he marches along , “
192174	192265	192163	192163	I	0	” So he whistles it off and marches on . Arrived in Lincoln ’s Inn Fields and mounting Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s stair , he finds the outer door closed and the chambers shut , but the trooper not knowing much about outer doors , and the staircase being dark besides , he is yet fumbling and groping about , hoping to discover a bell - handle or to open the door for himself , when Mr. Tulkinghorn comes up the stairs ( quietly , of course ) and angrily asks , “
192276	192277	192278	192278	I	0	” “
192292	192293	192289	192290	The sergeant	4619	” “
192309	192310	192297	192297	George	500	” “
192329	192337	192325	192325	I	0	” says the trooper , rather nettled . “
192352	192366	192346	192346	you	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn demands . But he knows well enough at a glance . “
192374	192375	192376	192376	I	0	” “
192394	192406	192389	192389	you	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , opening his door with the key , “
192417	192418	192389	192389	you	0	” “
192426	192438	192423	192424	the man	1619	” says the trooper , stopping two or three stairs down . “
192444	192445	192442	192442	sir	9496	” “
192488	192549	192480	192486	A threatening , murderous , dangerous fellow	4746	” With these words , spoken in an unusually high tone for him , the lawyer goes into his rooms and shuts the door with a thundering noise . Mr. George takes his dismissal in great dudgeon , the greater because a clerk coming up the stairs has heard the last words of all and evidently applies them to him . “
192556	192569	192570	192576	A threatening , murderous , dangerous fellow	4746	” the trooper growls with a hasty oath as he strides downstairs . “
192578	192901	192570	192576	A threatening , murderous , dangerous fellow	4746	” And looking up , he sees the clerk looking down at him and marking him as he passes a lamp . This so intensifies his dudgeon that for five minutes he is in an ill humour . But he whistles that off like the rest of it and marches home to the shooting gallery . CHAPTER XXVIII The Ironmaster Sir Leicester Dedlock has got the better , for the time being , of the family gout and is once more , in a literal no less than in a figurative point of view , upon his legs . He is at his place in Lincolnshire ; but the waters are out again on the low - lying grounds , and the cold and damp steal into Chesney Wold , though well defended , and eke into Sir Leicester ’s bones . The blazing fires of faggot and coal — Dedlock timber and antediluvian forest — that blaze upon the broad wide hearths and wink in the twilight on the frowning woods , sullen to see how trees are sacrificed , do not exclude the enemy . The hot - water pipes that trail themselves all over the house , the cushioned doors and windows , and the screens and curtains fail to supply the fires ’ deficiencies and to satisfy Sir Leicester ’s need . Hence the fashionable intelligence proclaims one morning to the listening earth that Lady Dedlock is expected shortly to return to town for a few weeks . It is a melancholy truth that even great men have their poor relations . Indeed great men have often more than their fair share of poor relations , inasmuch as very red blood of the superior quality , like inferior blood unlawfully shed , WILL cry aloud and WILL be heard . Sir Leicester ’s cousins , in the remotest degree , are so many Murders in the respect that they “
192905	194019	194020	194020	I	0	” Among whom there are cousins who are so poor that one might almost dare to think it would have been the happier for them never to have been plated links upon the Dedlock chain of gold , but to have been made of common iron at first and done base service . Service , however ( with a few limited reservations , genteel but not profitable ) , they may not do , being of the Dedlock dignity . So they visit their richer cousins , and get into debt when they can , and live but shabbily when they ca n’t , and find — the women no husbands , and the men no wives — and ride in borrowed carriages , and sit at feasts that are never of their own making , and so go through high life . The rich family sum has been divided by so many figures , and they are the something over that nobody knows what to do with . Everybody on Sir Leicester Dedlock ’s side of the question and of his way of thinking would appear to be his cousin more or less . From my Lord Boodle , through the Duke of Foodle , down to Noodle , Sir Leicester , like a glorious spider , stretches his threads of relationship . But while he is stately in the cousinship of the Everybodys , he is a kind and generous man , according to his dignified way , in the cousinship of the Nobodys ; and at the present time , in despite of the damp , he stays out the visit of several such cousins at Chesney Wold with the constancy of a martyr . Of these , foremost in the front rank stands Volumnia Dedlock , a young lady ( of sixty ) who is doubly highly related , having the honour to be a poor relation , by the mother ’s side , to another great family . Miss Volumnia , displaying in early life a pretty talent for cutting ornaments out of coloured paper , and also for singing to the guitar in the Spanish tongue , and propounding French conundrums in country houses , passed the twenty years of her existence between twenty and forty in a sufficiently agreeable manner . Lapsing then out of date and being considered to bore mankind by her vocal performances in the Spanish language , she retired to Bath , where she lives slenderly on an annual present from Sir Leicester and whence she makes occasional resurrections in the country houses of her cousins . She has an extensive acquaintance at Bath among appalling old gentlemen with thin legs and nankeen trousers , and is of high standing in that dreary city . But she is a little dreaded elsewhere in consequence of an indiscreet profusion in the article of rouge and persistency in an obsolete pearl necklace like a rosary of little bird’s - eggs . In any country in a wholesome state , Volumnia would be a clear case for the pension list . Efforts have been made to get her on it , and when William Buffy came in , it was fully expected that her name would be put down for a couple of hundred a year . But William Buffy somehow discovered , contrary to all expectation , that these were not the times when it could be done , and this was the first clear indication Sir Leicester Dedlock had conveyed to him that the country was going to pieces . There is likewise the Honourable Bob Stables , who can make warm mashes with the skill of a veterinary surgeon and is a better shot than most gamekeepers . He has been for some time particularly desirous to serve his country in a post of good emoluments , unaccompanied by any trouble or responsibility . In a well - regulated body politic this natural desire on the part of a spirited young gentleman so highly connected would be speedily recognized , but somehow William Buffy found when he came in that these were not times in which he could manage that little matter either , and this was the second indication Sir Leicester Dedlock had conveyed to him that the country was going to pieces . The rest of the cousins are ladies and gentlemen of various ages and capacities , the major part amiable and sensible and likely to have done well enough in life if they could have overcome their cousinship ; as it is , they are almost all a little worsted by it , and lounge in purposeless and listless paths , and seem to be quite as much at a loss how to dispose of themselves as anybody else can be how to dispose of them . In this society , and where not , my Lady Dedlock reigns supreme . Beautiful , elegant , accomplished , and powerful in her little world ( for the world of fashion does not stretch ALL the way from pole to pole ) , her influence in Sir Leicester ’s house , however haughty and indifferent her manner , is greatly to improve it and refine it . The cousins , even those older cousins who were paralysed when Sir Leicester married her , do her feudal homage ; and the Honourable Bob Stables daily repeats to some chosen person between breakfast and lunch his favourite original remark , that she is the best - groomed woman in the whole stud . Such the guests in the long drawing - room at Chesney Wold this dismal night when the step on the Ghost ’s Walk ( inaudible here , however ) might be the step of a deceased cousin shut out in the cold . It is near bed - time . Bedroom fires blaze brightly all over the house , raising ghosts of grim furniture on wall and ceiling . Bedroom candlesticks bristle on the distant table by the door , and cousins yawn on ottomans . Cousins at the piano , cousins at the soda - water tray , cousins rising from the card - table , cousins gathered round the fire . Standing on one side of his own peculiar fire ( for there are two ) , Sir Leicester . On the opposite side of the broad hearth , my Lady at her table . Volumnia , as one of the more privileged cousins , in a luxurious chair between them . Sir Leicester glancing , with magnificent displeasure , at the rouge and the pearl necklace . “
194028	194052	194020	194020	I	0	” drawls Volumnia , whose thoughts perhaps are already hopping up it to bed , after a long evening of very desultory talk , “
194070	194071	194059	194059	I	0	” “
194081	194086	194087	194087	I	0	” observes Sir Leicester . “
194118	194128	194108	194109	a marvel	4753	” says Miss Volumnia , reserving her own sort , “
194142	194162	194138	194138	I	0	” Sir Leicester , with his magnificent glance of displeasure at the rouge , appears to say so too . “
194165	194171	194138	194138	I	0	” remarks my Lady languidly , “
194197	194198	194192	194192	Rosa	334	” “
194205	194206	194199	194200	Your maid	3457	” “
194224	194225	194218	194218	I	0	” “
194271	194277	194230	194230	her	2502	” says Volumnia , sympathizing . “
194322	194367	194312	194312	She	2502	” Sir Leicester feels it to be right and fitting that the housekeeper of Chesney Wold should be a remarkable person . Apart from that , he has a real regard for Mrs. Rouncewell and likes to hear her praised . So he says , “
194374	194383	194368	194368	You	0	” which Volumnia is extremely glad to hear . “
194395	194396	194397	194398	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	” “
194415	194444	194413	194413	two	4759	” My Lady , whose chronic malady of boredom has been sadly aggravated by Volumnia this evening , glances wearily towards the candlesticks and heaves a noiseless sigh . “
194479	194487	194489	194489	I	0	” says Sir Leicester with stately gloom , “
194509	194518	194497	194498	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	” Miss Volumnia utters a little sharp scream . “
194523	194528	194497	194498	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	” repeats Sir Leicester . “
194532	194533	194497	194498	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	” “
194550	194554	194555	194555	He	1619	” exclaims Volumnia . “
194566	194617	194618	194618	He	1619	” Sir Leicester says it slowly and with gravity and doubt , as not being sure but that he is called a lead - mistress or that the right word may be some other word expressive of some other relationship to some other metal . Volumnia utters another little scream . “
194654	194659	194641	194642	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” says Sir Leicester , “
194683	194720	194721	194721	I	0	” Miss Volumnia rising with a look candlestick - wards , Sir Leicester politely performs the grand tour of the drawing - room , brings one , and lights it at my Lady ’s shaded lamp . “
194729	194736	194726	194727	my Lady	958	” he says while doing so , “
194762	194774	194726	194727	my Lady	958	note”—Sir Leicester , with his habitual regard to truth , dwells upon it—“I
194830	194873	194875	194875	my	0	” Miss Volumnia with a third little scream takes flight , wishing her hosts — O Lud!—well rid of the — what is it?—ironmaster ! The other cousins soon disperse , to the last cousin there . Sir Leicester rings the bell , “
194895	195001	195002	195003	Sir Leicester	266	” My Lady , who has heard all this with slight attention outwardly , looks towards Mr. Rouncewell as he comes in . He is a little over fifty perhaps , of a good figure , like his mother , and has a clear voice , a broad forehead from which his dark hair has retired , and a shrewd though open face . He is a responsible - looking gentleman dressed in black , portly enough , but strong and active . Has a perfectly natural and easy air and is not in the least embarrassed by the great presence into which he comes . “
195035	195060	195030	195030	you	4771	” The head of the Dedlocks has motioned towards a sofa between himself and my Lady . Mr. Rouncewell quietly takes his seat there . “
195094	195220	195221	195222	Lady Dedlock	264	” Sir Leicester is content enough that the ironmaster should feel that there is no hurry there ; there , in that ancient house , rooted in that quiet park , where the ivy and the moss have had time to mature , and the gnarled and warted elms and the umbrageous oaks stand deep in the fern and leaves of a hundred years ; and where the sun - dial on the terrace has dumbly recorded for centuries that time which was as much the property of every Dedlock — while he lasted — as the house and lands . Sir Leicester sits down in an easy - chair , opposing his repose and that of Chesney Wold to the restless flights of ironmasters . “
195228	195242	195221	195222	Lady Dedlock	264	” proceeds Mr. Rouncewell with a respectful glance and a bow that way , “
195346	195347	195337	195338	my mother	2299	” “
195355	195360	195337	195338	my mother	2299	” says my Lady . “
195390	195391	195384	195384	your	264	” “
195394	195412	195384	195384	your	264	” observes Sir Leicester with unspeakable grandeur , for he thinks the ironmaster a little too glib , “
195418	195419	195384	195384	your	264	” “
195586	195650	195666	195667	my Lady	958	” Not remain at Chesney Wold ! Make it a condition ! All Sir Leicester ’s old misgivings relative to Wat Tyler and the people in the iron districts who do nothing but turn out by torchlight come in a shower upon his head , the fine grey hair of which , as well as of his whiskers , actually stirs with indignation . “
195658	195663	195652	195652	I	0	” says Sir Leicester , “
195669	195696	195697	195697	I	0	understand”—he brings her in thus specially , first as a point of gallantry , and next as a point of prudence , having great reliance on her sense—“am
195733	195734	195706	195707	my Lady	958	” “
195741	195742	195738	195739	Sir Leicester	266	” “
195750	195757	195743	195743	I	0	” Sir Leicester very lofty indeed . “
195763	195788	195760	195761	Mr. Rouncewell	330	” says my Lady , warning Sir Leicester off with the slightest gesture of her pretty hand , as if he were a fly , “
195796	195797	195793	195793	you	9496	” “
195811	195866	195867	195867	I	0	” Addressing her composed face , whose intelligence , however , is too quick and active to be concealed by any studied impassiveness , however habitual , to the strong Saxon face of the visitor , a picture of resolution and perseverance , my Lady listens with attention , occasionally slightly bending her head . “
195980	196021	196083	196083	I	0	” Sir Leicester snorts a little to hear the law laid down in this way , but in his honour and his love of truth , he freely , though silently , admits the justice of the ironmaster ’s proposition . “
196040	196052	196032	196032	I	0	” with the least turn of his eyes towards Sir Leicester , “
196132	196159	196160	196160	I	0	” Sir Leicester very magnificent again at the notion of Mrs. Rouncewell being spirited off from her natural home to end her days with an ironmaster . “
196164	196175	196176	196177	an apprentice	4804	” proceeds the visitor in a modest , clear way , “
196273	196291	196322	196323	Lady Dedlock	264	” A little boastfulness in his fatherly tone here , as if he added in his heart , “
196299	196315	196322	196323	Lady Dedlock	264	” Not a little more magnificence , therefore , on the part of Sir Leicester . “
196586	196598	196577	196577	they	4830	” Sir Leicester ’s magnificence explodes . Calmly , but terribly . “
196602	196631	196577	196577	they	4830	” says Sir Leicester with his right hand in the breast of his blue coat , the attitude of state in which he is painted in the gallery , “
196643	196652	196633	196633	you	330	” Here he resists a disposition to choke , “
196656	196657	196633	196633	you	330	” “
196693	196722	196682	196682	I	0	” Sir Leicester directs his majestic glance down one side of the long drawing - room and up the other before he can believe that he is awake . “
196756	196757	196758	196759	Sir Leicester	266	” “
196782	196783	196786	196787	Mr. Rouncewell	330	” “
196789	196794	196786	196787	Mr. Rouncewell	330	” returns Sir Leicester , “
196809	196810	196799	196799	you	330	” “
196824	196832	196821	196821	I	0	” the ironmaster is reddening a little , “
196854	196991	196992	196992	My	0	” From the village school of Chesney Wold , intact as it is this minute , to the whole framework of society ; from the whole framework of society , to the aforesaid framework receiving tremendous cracks in consequence of people ( iron - masters , lead - mistresses , and what not ) not minding their catechism , and getting out of the station unto which they are called — necessarily and for ever , according to Sir Leicester ’s rapid logic , the first station in which they happen to find themselves ; and from that , to their educating other people out of THEIR stations , and so obliterating the landmarks , and opening the floodgates , and all the rest of it ; this is the swift progress of the Dedlock mind . “
197007	197019	197001	197001	me	0	” She has given a faint indication of intending to speak . “
197232	197256	197257	197258	Sir Leicester	266	” The visitor pauses a moment to give my Lady an opportunity , but she says nothing . He then rises and replies , “
197292	197293	197294	197295	Mr. Rouncewell	330	” “
197297	197312	197294	197295	Mr. Rouncewell	330	” says Sir Leicester with all the nature of a gentleman shining in him , “
197356	197357	197358	197358	I	0	” “
197362	197367	197358	197358	I	0	” adds my Lady . “
197401	197464	197485	197486	My Lady	958	” Therewith the ironmaster takes his departure , Sir Leicester ringing the bell and my Lady rising as he leaves the room . When my Lady goes to her boudoir , she sits down thoughtfully by the fire , and inattentive to the Ghost ’s Walk , looks at Rosa , writing in an inner room . Presently my Lady calls her . “
197481	197482	197485	197486	My Lady	958	” “
197488	197503	197485	197486	My Lady	958	” My Lady , looking at the downcast and blushing face , says smiling , “
197515	197516	197510	197511	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	” “
197541	197542	197537	197537	him	4857	” “
197560	197561	197551	197551	you	9522	” “
197573	197616	197564	197564	he	4857	” And Rosa bursts into tears . Is this Lady Dedlock standing beside the village beauty , smoothing her dark hair with that motherly touch , and watching her with eyes so full of musing interest ? Aye , indeed it is ! “
197638	197639	197632	197632	you	9522	” “
197663	197664	197654	197654	I	0	” “
197686	197687	197690	197691	my Lady	958	” “
197697	197712	197690	197691	my Lady	958	” Rosa looks up for the first time , quite frightened at the thought . “
197748	198548	197725	197725	I	0	” Rosa , with fresh tears , kneels at her feet and kisses her hand . My Lady takes the hand with which she has caught it , and standing with her eyes fixed on the fire , puts it about and about between her own two hands , and gradually lets it fall . Seeing her so absorbed , Rosa softly withdraws ; but still my Lady ’s eyes are on the fire . In search of what ? Of any hand that is no more , of any hand that never was , of any touch that might have magically changed her life ? Or does she listen to the Ghost ’s Walk and think what step does it most resemble ? A man ’s ? A woman ’s ? The pattering of a little child ’s feet , ever coming on — on — on ? Some melancholy influence is upon her , or why should so proud a lady close the doors and sit alone upon the hearth so desolate ? Volumnia is away next day , and all the cousins are scattered before dinner . Not a cousin of the batch but is amazed to hear from Sir Leicester at breakfast - time of the obliteration of landmarks , and opening of floodgates , and cracking of the framework of society , manifested through Mrs. Rouncewell ’s son . Not a cousin of the batch but is really indignant , and connects it with the feebleness of William Buffy when in office , and really does feel deprived of a stake in the country — or the pension list — or something — by fraud and wrong . As to Volumnia , she is handed down the great staircase by Sir Leicester , as eloquent upon the theme as if there were a general rising in the north of England to obtain her rouge - pot and pearl necklace . And thus , with a clatter of maids and valets — for it is one appurtenance of their cousinship that however difficult they may find it to keep themselves , they MUST keep maids and valets — the cousins disperse to the four winds of heaven ; and the one wintry wind that blows to - day shakes a shower from the trees near the deserted house , as if all the cousins had been changed into leaves . CHAPTER XXIX The Young Man Chesney Wold is shut up , carpets are rolled into great scrolls in corners of comfortless rooms , bright damask does penance in brown holland , carving and gilding puts on mortification , and the Dedlock ancestors retire from the light of day again . Around and around the house the leaves fall thick , but never fast , for they come circling down with a dead lightness that is sombre and slow . Let the gardener sweep and sweep the turf as he will , and press the leaves into full barrows , and wheel them off , still they lie ankle - deep . Howls the shrill wind round Chesney Wold ; the sharp rain beats , the windows rattle , and the chimneys growl . Mists hide in the avenues , veil the points of view , and move in funeral - wise across the rising grounds . On all the house there is a cold , blank smell like the smell of a little church , though something dryer , suggesting that the dead and buried Dedlocks walk there in the long nights and leave the flavour of their graves behind them . But the house in town , which is rarely in the same mind as Chesney Wold at the same time , seldom rejoicing when it rejoices or mourning when it mourns , excepting when a Dedlock dies — the house in town shines out awakened . As warm and bright as so much state may be , as delicately redolent of pleasant scents that bear no trace of winter as hothouse flowers can make it , soft and hushed so that the ticking of the clocks and the crisp burning of the fires alone disturb the stillness in the rooms , it seems to wrap those chilled bones of Sir Leicester ’s in rainbow - coloured wool . And Sir Leicester is glad to repose in dignified contentment before the great fire in the library , condescendingly perusing the backs of his books or honouring the fine arts with a glance of approbation . For he has his pictures , ancient and modern . Some of the Fancy Ball School in which art occasionally condescends to become a master , which would be best catalogued like the miscellaneous articles in a sale . As “
198598	198600	198595	198596	Don Quixote	558	” Or “
198655	199021	199022	199027	The man who wrote this article	4873	” Mr. Tulkinghorn comes and goes pretty often , there being estate business to do , leases to be renewed , and so on . He sees my Lady pretty often , too ; and he and she are as composed , and as indifferent , and take as little heed of one another , as ever . Yet it may be that my Lady fears this Mr. Tulkinghorn and that he knows it . It may be that he pursues her doggedly and steadily , with no touch of compunction , remorse , or pity . It may be that her beauty and all the state and brilliancy surrounding her only gives him the greater zest for what he is set upon and makes him the more inflexible in it . Whether he be cold and cruel , whether immovable in what he has made his duty , whether absorbed in love of power , whether determined to have nothing hidden from him in ground where he has burrowed among secrets all his life , whether he in his heart despises the splendour of which he is a distant beam , whether he is always treasuring up slights and offences in the affability of his gorgeous clients — whether he be any of this , or all of this , it may be that my Lady had better have five thousand pairs of fashionable eyes upon her , in distrustful vigilance , than the two eyes of this rusty lawyer with his wisp of neckcloth and his dull black breeches tied with ribbons at the knees . Sir Leicester sits in my Lady ’s room — that room in which Mr. Tulkinghorn read the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce — particularly complacent . My Lady , as on that day , sits before the fire with her screen in her hand . Sir Leicester is particularly complacent because he has found in his newspaper some congenial remarks bearing directly on the floodgates and the framework of society . They apply so happily to the late case that Sir Leicester has come from the library to my Lady ’s room expressly to read them aloud . “
199029	199054	199022	199027	The man who wrote this article	4873	” he observes by way of preface , nodding at the fire as if he were nodding down at the man from a mount , “
199062	199154	199022	199027	The man who wrote this article	4873	” The man ’s mind is not so well balanced but that he bores my Lady , who , after a languid effort to listen , or rather a languid resignation of herself to a show of listening , becomes distraught and falls into a contemplation of the fire as if it were her fire at Chesney Wold , and she had never left it . Sir Leicester , quite unconscious , reads on through his double eye - glass , occasionally stopping to remove his glass and express approval , as “
199159	199160	199022	199027	The man who wrote this article	4873	” “
199165	199166	199022	199027	The man who wrote this article	4873	” “
199176	199221	199222	199224	The young man	1916	” invariably losing his place after each observation , and going up and down the column to find it again . Sir Leicester is reading with infinite gravity and state when the door opens , and the Mercury in powder makes this strange announcement , “
199235	199248	199222	199224	The young man	1916	” Sir Leicester pauses , stares , repeats in a killing voice , “
199258	199290	199249	199256	The young man of the name of Guppy	4876	” Looking round , he beholds the young man of the name of Guppy , much discomfited and not presenting a very impressive letter of introduction in his manner and appearance . “
199293	199300	199249	199256	The young man of the name of Guppy	4876	” says Sir Leicester to Mercury , “
199319	199320	199303	199303	you	4877	” “
199355	199380	199348	199348	you	0	” With this apology , Mercury directs a scornful and indignant look at the young man of the name of Guppy which plainly says , “
199395	199396	199383	199383	you	0	” “
199408	199413	199402	199402	I	0	” says my Lady . “
199420	199421	199415	199417	the young man	1916	” “
199443	199517	199437	199437	I	0	” Sir Leicester in his gallantry retires , rather declining to accept a bow from the young man as he goes out and majestically supposing him to be some shoemaker of intrusive appearance . Lady Dedlock looks imperiously at her visitor when the servant has left the room , casting her eyes over him from head to foot . She suffers him to stand by the door and asks him what he wants . “
199533	199540	199541	199541	You	0	” returns Mr. Guppy , embarrassed . “
199557	199558	199547	199562	the person who has written me so many letters ? ” “ Several , your ladyship	4885	” “
199576	199577	199566	199567	your ladyship	2537	” “
199597	199606	199593	199593	you	0	” Mr. Guppy screws his mouth into a silent “
199609	199615	199616	199616	You	0	” and shakes his head . “
199682	199716	199679	199679	you	0	” My Lady , with a careless toss of her screen , turns herself towards the fire again , sitting almost with her back to the young man of the name of Guppy . “
199725	199731	199679	199679	you	0	” says the young man , “
199859	199888	199895	199896	your ladyship	2537	” My Lady ’s figure begins to be expressive of some attention . She has ceased to toss the screen and holds it as if she were listening . “
199900	199909	199895	199896	your ladyship	2537	” says Mr. Guppy , a little emboldened , “
199952	199975	199933	199933	I	0	” After waiting for a moment to receive some assurance to the contrary , and not receiving any , Mr. Guppy proceeds , “
200042	200052	200035	200035	I	0	” My Lady turns a little round and says , “
200059	200060	200062	200063	your ladyship	2537	” “
200065	200071	200062	200063	your ladyship	2537	” Mr. Guppy does so . “
200075	200111	200074	200074	your	0	ladyship”—Mr . Guppy refers to a little slip of paper on which he has made small notes of his line of argument and which seems to involve him in the densest obscurity whenever he looks at it—“I
200172	200199	200167	200168	your ladyship	2537	” My Lady , with a disdainful gesture of the hand that holds the screen , assures him of his being worth no complaint from her . “
200204	200209	200201	200202	your ladyship	2537	” says Mr. Guppy ; “
200276	200302	200274	200274	I	0	” Mr. Guppy , going to the window , tumbles into a pair of love - birds , to whom he says in his confusion , “
200312	200350	200303	200303	I	0	” This does not tend to the greater legibility of his notes . He murmurs , growing warm and red and holding the slip of paper now close to his eyes , now a long way off , “
200372	200378	200379	200379	I	0	” And comes back enlightened . “
200384	200398	200363	200363	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , standing midway between my Lady and his chair , “
200423	200433	200419	200421	Miss Esther Summerson	280	” My Lady ’s eyes look at him full . “
200450	200451	200436	200441	a young lady of that name	4912	” “
200465	200502	200460	200460	she	4912	” asks Mr. Guppy , crossing his arms , holding his head on one side , and scratching the corner of his mouth with his memoranda . My Lady removes her eyes from him no more . “
200505	200506	200460	200460	she	4912	” “
200514	200515	200522	200522	your	0	” “
200518	200519	200522	200522	your	0	” “
200525	200530	200522	200522	your	0	” says Mr. Guppy , “
200539	200540	200541	200541	I	0	” “
200557	200558	200559	200560	Your ladyship	2537	” “
200721	200808	200809	200810	Your ladyship	2537	” Young man of the name of Guppy ! There have been times , when ladies lived in strongholds and had unscrupulous attendants within call , when that poor life of yours would NOT have been worth a minute ’s purchase , with those beautiful eyes looking at you as they look at this moment . My Lady , slowly using her little hand - screen as a fan , asks him again what he supposes that his taste for likenesses has to do with her . “
200812	200823	200809	200810	Your ladyship	2537	” replies Mr. Guppy , again referring to his paper , “
200843	200885	200837	200838	Mrs. Chadband	471	” Mr. Guppy draws his chair a little forward and seats himself again . My Lady reclines in her chair composedly , though with a trifle less of graceful ease than usual perhaps , and never falters in her steady gaze . “
200894	200900	200837	200838	Mrs. Chadband	471	” Mr. Guppy refers again . “
200919	200939	200910	200910	I	0	” Rolling up the slip of paper as an instrument to point his speech with , Mr. Guppy proceeds . “
201101	201115	201093	201093	she	280	” A kind of angry smile just dawns upon my Lady ’s face . “
201128	201133	201125	201126	your ladyship	2537	” says Mr. Guppy , “
201236	201283	201230	201231	Miss Barbary	284	” Is the dead colour on my Lady ’s face reflected from the screen which has a green silk ground and which she holds in her raised hand as if she had forgotten it , or is it a dreadful paleness that has fallen on her ? “
201288	201293	201230	201231	Miss Barbary	284	” says Mr. Guppy , “
201302	201303	201299	201300	Miss Barbary	284	” “
201315	201316	201309	201309	I	0	” “
201329	201346	201309	201309	I	0	” My Lady ’s lips move , but they utter nothing . She shakes her head . “
201350	201355	201309	201309	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy . “
201375	201388	201394	201396	this Miss Barbary	284	” After each of these interrogatories , she has inclined her head . “
201483	201484	201463	201463	she	284	” “
201488	201641	201463	201463	she	284	” Mr. Guppy stares . Lady Dedlock sits before him looking him through , with the same dark shade upon her face , in the same attitude even to the holding of the screen , with her lips a little apart , her brow a little contracted , but for the moment dead . He sees her consciousness return , sees a tremor pass across her frame like a ripple over water , sees her lips shake , sees her compose them by a great effort , sees her force herself back to the knowledge of his presence and of what he has said . All this , so quickly , that her exclamation and her dead condition seem to have passed away like the features of those long - preserved dead bodies sometimes opened up in tombs , which , struck by the air like lightning , vanish in a breath . “
201652	201653	201650	201650	Hawdon	559	” “
201660	201661	201650	201650	Hawdon	559	” “
201675	201676	201650	201650	Hawdon	559	” “
201679	201680	201650	201650	Hawdon	559	” “
201686	201691	201692	201692	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , “
201825	201826	201823	201823	Hawdon	559	” “
201834	201835	201823	201823	Hawdon	559	” “
201929	201949	201954	201955	your ladyship	2537	” The wretched boy is nothing to my Lady , and she does NOT wish to have him produced . “
201964	201969	201952	201952	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy . “
201999	202047	202052	202053	your ladyship	2537	” There are diamonds glittering on the hand that holds the screen . My Lady trifles with the screen and makes them glitter more , again with that expression which in other times might have been so dangerous to the young man of the name of Guppy . “
202084	202103	202076	202076	He	0	” The screen still goes , as before . All this time her eyes never once release him . “
202126	202127	202116	202117	your ladyship	2537	” “
202139	202140	202141	202142	Your ladyship	2537	” “
202149	202154	202144	202144	I	0	” Mr. Guppy rises . “
202340	202426	202427	202427	You	2537	” Is this the full purpose of the young man of the name of Guppy , or has he any other ? Do his words disclose the length , breadth , depth , of his object and suspicion in coming here ; or if not , what do they hide ? He is a match for my Lady there . She may look at him , but he can look at the table and keep that witness - box face of his from telling anything . “
202433	202438	202427	202427	You	2537	” says my Lady , “
202443	202444	202445	202446	Your ladyship	2537	” “
202458	202467	202445	202446	Your ladyship	2537	” says Mr. Guppy , a little injured . “
202474	202482	202484	202484	you	2537	” she repeats in the same tone , “
202488	202489	202484	202484	you	2537	” “
202502	202541	202495	202495	I	0	” On a table near her is a rich bauble of a casket , barred and clasped like an old strong - chest . She , looking at him still , takes it to her and unlocks it . “
202559	202564	202548	202548	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , “
202592	202752	202575	202575	I	0	” So the young man makes his bow and goes downstairs , where the supercilious Mercury does not consider himself called upon to leave his Olympus by the hall - fire to let the young man out . As Sir Leicester basks in his library and dozes over his newspaper , is there no influence in the house to startle him , not to say to make the very trees at Chesney Wold fling up their knotted arms , the very portraits frown , the very armour stir ? No . Words , sobs , and cries are but air , and air is so shut in and shut out throughout the house in town that sounds need be uttered trumpet - tongued indeed by my Lady in her chamber to carry any faint vibration to Sir Leicester ’s ears ; and yet this cry is in the house , going upward from a wild figure on its knees . “
202800	202855	202857	202857	her	9542	” CHAPTER XXX Esther ’s Narrative Richard had been gone away some time when a visitor came to pass a few days with us . It was an elderly lady . It was Mrs. Woodcourt , who , having come from Wales to stay with Mrs. Bayham Badger and having written to my guardian , “
202863	202877	202857	202857	her	9542	” to report that she had heard from him and that he was well “
202888	203212	202857	202857	her	9542	” had been invited by my guardian to make a visit to Bleak House . She stayed with us nearly three weeks . She took very kindly to me and was extremely confidential , so much so that sometimes she almost made me uncomfortable . I had no right , I knew very well , to be uncomfortable because she confided in me , and I felt it was unreasonable ; still , with all I could do , I could not quite help it . She was such a sharp little lady and used to sit with her hands folded in each other looking so very watchful while she talked to me that perhaps I found that rather irksome . Or perhaps it was her being so upright and trim , though I do n’t think it was that , because I thought that quaintly pleasant . Nor can it have been the general expression of her face , which was very sparkling and pretty for an old lady . I do n’t know what it was . Or at least if I do now , I thought I did not then . Or at least — but it do n’t matter . Of a night when I was going upstairs to bed , she would invite me into her room , where she sat before the fire in a great chair ; and , dear me , she would tell me about Morgan ap - Kerrig until I was quite low - spirited ! Sometimes she recited a few verses from Crumlinwallinwer and the Mewlinnwillinwodd ( if those are the right names , which I dare say they are not ) , and would become quite fiery with the sentiments they expressed . Though I never knew what they were ( being in Welsh ) , further than that they were highly eulogistic of the lineage of Morgan ap - Kerrig . “
203218	203228	203215	203216	Miss Summerson	280	” she would say to me with stately triumph , “
203276	203320	203271	203271	family	962	” I had my doubts of their caring so very much for Morgan ap - Kerrig in India and China , but of course I never expressed them . I used to say it was a great thing to be so highly connected . “
203331	203337	203271	203271	family	962	” Mrs. Woodcourt would reply . “
203375	203410	203411	203413	Poor Mr. Woodcourt	440	” Then she would pat me on the arm and smooth my dress , as much as to assure me that she had a good opinion of me , the distance between us notwithstanding . “
203418	203441	203411	203413	Poor Mr. Woodcourt	440	” she would say , and always with some emotion , for with her lofty pedigree she had a very affectionate heart , “
203508	203555	203556	203556	My	0	” It was in vain for me to try to change the subject , as I used to try , only for the sake of novelty or perhaps because — but I need not be so particular . Mrs. Woodcourt never would let me change it . “
203559	203565	203556	203556	My	0	” she said one night , “
203633	203634	203625	203625	I	0	” “
203643	203644	203639	203639	I	0	” “
203675	203676	203679	203680	Mrs. Woodcourt	465	” “
203682	203686	203679	203680	Mrs. Woodcourt	465	” said I , “
203692	203693	203679	203680	Mrs. Woodcourt	465	” “
203703	203707	203708	203708	I	0	” she returned . “
203715	203716	203713	203713	myself	0	” “
203722	203723	203713	203713	myself	0	” “
203737	203799	203800	203800	You	9540	” I did n’t mean that , because Mr. Woodcourt had been at our house a good deal altogether and had become quite intimate with my guardian . I said so , and added that he seemed to be very clever in his profession — we thought — and that his kindness and gentleness to Miss Flite were above all praise . “
203805	203814	203800	203800	You	9540	” said Mrs. Woodcourt , pressing my hand . “
203855	203856	203847	203847	he	5032	” “
203862	203865	203847	203847	he	5032	” said I. “
203883	203895	203874	203874	he	5032	” returned the sharp old lady , sharply shaking her head . “
203926	203963	203964	203964	You	9540	” I said I should have thought it hardly possible that he could have been otherwise than constant to his profession and zealous in the pursuit of it , judging from the reputation he had earned . “
203972	203978	203964	203964	You	9540	” the old lady retorted , “
203991	203992	203989	203989	you	9540	” “
203995	203998	203989	203989	you	9540	” said I. “
204001	204005	204006	204006	I	0	” said she . “
204087	204088	204081	204081	you	9540	” “
204091	204103	204081	204081	you	9540	” said I , as she seemed to wait for me . “
204118	204124	204127	204127	I	0	” I supposed it might . “
204245	204259	204240	204240	you	9540	” said the old lady , who was now all nods and smiles , “

204275	204276	204270	204270	Me	0	” “
204327	204366	204324	204324	you	9540	” I do n’t think I did blush — at all events , it was not important if I did — and I said my present fortune perfectly contented me and I had no wish to change it . “
204389	204394	204368	204368	I	0	” said Mrs. Woodcourt . “
204404	204407	204396	204396	you	0	” said I. “
204455	204456	204396	204396	you	0	” “
204463	204466	204396	204396	you	0	” said I. “

204480	204484	204477	204478	My dear	9540	” she returned , “
204538	205067	205399	205399	he	2752	” It was curious that this should make me uncomfortable , but I think it did . I know it did . It made me for some part of that night uncomfortable . I was so ashamed of my folly that I did not like to confess it even to Ada , and that made me more uncomfortable still . I would have given anything not to have been so much in the bright old lady ’s confidence if I could have possibly declined it . It gave me the most inconsistent opinions of her . At one time I thought she was a story - teller , and at another time that she was the pink of truth . Now I suspected that she was very cunning , next moment I believed her honest Welsh heart to be perfectly innocent and simple . And after all , what did it matter to me , and why did it matter to me ? Why could not I , going up to bed with my basket of keys , stop to sit down by her fire and accommodate myself for a little while to her , at least as well as to anybody else , and not trouble myself about the harmless things she said to me ? Impelled towards her , as I certainly was , for I was very anxious that she should like me and was very glad indeed that she did , why should I harp afterwards , with actual distress and pain , on every word she said and weigh it over and over again in twenty scales ? Why was it so worrying to me to have her in our house , and confidential to me every night , when I yet felt that it was better and safer somehow that she should be there than anywhere else ? These were perplexities and contradictions that I could not account for . At least , if I could — but I shall come to all that by and by , and it is mere idleness to go on about it now . So when Mrs. Woodcourt went away , I was sorry to lose her but was relieved too . And then Caddy Jellyby came down , and Caddy brought such a packet of domestic news that it gave us abundant occupation . First Caddy declared ( and would at first declare nothing else ) that I was the best adviser that ever was known . This , my pet said , was no news at all ; and this , I said , of course , was nonsense . Then Caddy told us that she was going to be married in a month and that if Ada and I would be her bridesmaids , she was the happiest girl in the world . To be sure , this was news indeed ; and I thought we never should have done talking about it , we had so much to say to Caddy , and Caddy had so much to say to us . It seemed that Caddy ’s unfortunate papa had got over his bankruptcy—“gone
205072	205165	205399	205399	he	2752	” was the expression Caddy used , as if it were a tunnel — with the general clemency and commiseration of his creditors , and had got rid of his affairs in some blessed manner without succeeding in understanding them , and had given up everything he possessed ( which was not worth much , I should think , to judge from the state of the furniture ) , and had satisfied every one concerned that he could do no more , poor man . So , he had been honourably dismissed to “
205168	205191	205399	205399	he	2752	” to begin the world again . What he did at the office , I never knew ; Caddy said he was a “
205199	205390	205399	205399	he	2752	” and the only thing I ever understood about that business was that when he wanted money more than usual he went to the docks to look for it , and hardly ever found it . As soon as her papa had tranquillized his mind by becoming this shorn lamb , and they had removed to a furnished lodging in Hatton Garden ( where I found the children , when I afterwards went there , cutting the horse hair out of the seats of the chairs and choking themselves with it ) , Caddy had brought about a meeting between him and old Mr. Turveydrop ; and poor Mr. Jellyby , being very humble and meek , had deferred to Mr. Turveydrop ’s deportment so submissively that they had become excellent friends . By degrees , old Mr. Turveydrop , thus familiarized with the idea of his son ’s marriage , had worked up his parental feelings to the height of contemplating that event as being near at hand and had given his gracious consent to the young couple commencing housekeeping at the academy in Newman Street when they would . “
205402	205403	205399	205399	he	2752	” “
205409	205413	205418	205418	he	2752	” said Caddy , “
205503	205504	205508	205508	you	0	” “
205514	205515	205508	205508	you	0	” “
205627	205628	205629	205629	Indians	345	” “
205633	205634	205642	205643	wild Indians	5075	” “
205637	205641	205642	205643	wild Indians	5075	” said Caddy , “
205647	205665	205666	205666	he	309	said”—here she began to sob , poor girl , not at all like the happiest girl in the world—“that
205684	205703	205666	205666	he	309	” Ada suggested that it was comfortable to know that Mr. Jellyby did not mean these destructive sentiments . “
205723	205727	205729	205729	he	309	” said Caddy , “
205769	205785	205794	205794	Esther	280	” I asked Caddy if Mrs. Jellyby knew that her wedding - day was fixed . “
205796	205800	205794	205794	Esther	280	” she returned . “
205852	205860	205828	205828	she	308	” said Caddy with a sudden idea ; “
205891	205892	205863	205863	she	308	” “
205900	205912	205898	205898	Caddy	300	” said I. For she was under no restraint with us . “
205919	205927	205917	205917	Esther	280	” she returned , drying her eyes , “
205987	206361	205981	205981	she	308	” Caddy was not at all deficient in natural affection for her mother , but mentioned this with tears as an undeniable fact , which I am afraid it was . We were sorry for the poor dear girl and found so much to admire in the good disposition which had survived under such discouragement that we both at once ( I mean Ada and I ) proposed a little scheme that made her perfectly joyful . This was her staying with us for three weeks , my staying with her for one , and our all three contriving and cutting out , and repairing , and sewing , and saving , and doing the very best we could think of to make the most of her stock . My guardian being as pleased with the idea as Caddy was , we took her home next day to arrange the matter and brought her out again in triumph with her boxes and all the purchases that could be squeezed out of a ten - pound note , which Mr. Jellyby had found in the docks I suppose , but which he at all events gave her . What my guardian would not have given her if we had encouraged him , it would be difficult to say , but we thought it right to compound for no more than her wedding - dress and bonnet . He agreed to this compromise , and if Caddy had ever been happy in her life , she was happy when we sat down to work . She was clumsy enough with her needle , poor girl , and pricked her fingers as much as she had been used to ink them . She could not help reddening a little now and then , partly with the smart and partly with vexation at being able to do no better , but she soon got over that and began to improve rapidly . So day after day she , and my darling , and my little maid Charley , and a milliner out of the town , and I , sat hard at work , as pleasantly as possible . Over and above this , Caddy was very anxious “
206366	206418	206419	206419	Caddy	300	” as she said . Now , mercy upon us ! The idea of her learning housekeeping of a person of my vast experience was such a joke that I laughed , and coloured up , and fell into a comical confusion when she proposed it . However , I said , “
206441	206999	206438	206439	my dear	9540	” and I showed her all my books and methods and all my fidgety ways . You would have supposed that I was showing her some wonderful inventions , by her study of them ; and if you had seen her , whenever I jingled my housekeeping keys , get up and attend me , certainly you might have thought that there never was a greater imposter than I with a blinder follower than Caddy Jellyby . So what with working and housekeeping , and lessons to Charley , and backgammon in the evening with my guardian , and duets with Ada , the three weeks slipped fast away . Then I went home with Caddy to see what could be done there , and Ada and Charley remained behind to take care of my guardian . When I say I went home with Caddy , I mean to the furnished lodging in Hatton Garden . We went to Newman Street two or three times , where preparations were in progress too — a good many , I observed , for enhancing the comforts of old Mr. Turveydrop , and a few for putting the newly married couple away cheaply at the top of the house — but our great point was to make the furnished lodging decent for the wedding - breakfast and to imbue Mrs. Jellyby beforehand with some faint sense of the occasion . The latter was the more difficult thing of the two because Mrs. Jellyby and an unwholesome boy occupied the front sitting - room ( the back one was a mere closet ) , and it was littered down with waste - paper and Borrioboolan documents , as an untidy stable might be littered with straw . Mrs. Jellyby sat there all day drinking strong coffee , dictating , and holding Borrioboolan interviews by appointment . The unwholesome boy , who seemed to me to be going into a decline , took his meals out of the house . When Mr. Jellyby came home , he usually groaned and went down into the kitchen . There he got something to eat if the servant would give him anything , and then , feeling that he was in the way , went out and walked about Hatton Garden in the wet . The poor children scrambled up and tumbled down the house as they had always been accustomed to do . The production of these devoted little sacrifices in any presentable condition being quite out of the question at a week ’s notice , I proposed to Caddy that we should make them as happy as we could on her marriage morning in the attic where they all slept , and should confine our greatest efforts to her mama and her mama ’s room , and a clean breakfast . In truth Mrs. Jellyby required a good deal of attention , the lattice - work up her back having widened considerably since I first knew her and her hair looking like the mane of a dustman ’s horse . Thinking that the display of Caddy ’s wardrobe would be the best means of approaching the subject , I invited Mrs. Jellyby to come and look at it spread out on Caddy ’s bed in the evening after the unwholesome boy was gone . “
207005	207020	206438	206439	my dear	9540	” said she , rising from her desk with her usual sweetness of temper , “
207066	207107	207108	207108	My	0	” She came upstairs with us notwithstanding and looked at the clothes in her customary far - off manner . They suggested one distinct idea to her , for she said with her placid smile , and shaking her head , “
207128	207160	207108	207108	My	0	” On our going downstairs again , Mrs. Jellyby asked me whether this troublesome business was really to take place next Wednesday . And on my replying yes , she said , “
207185	207211	207216	207217	Miss Summerson	280	” I took the liberty of saying that the room would certainly be wanted and that I thought we must put the papers away somewhere . “
207219	207224	207225	207225	you	280	” said Mrs. Jellyby , “
207287	207288	207268	207268	We	5089	” “
207297	207303	207268	207268	We	5089	” said I , smiling . “
207313	207314	207268	207268	We	5089	” “
207319	207324	207268	207268	We	5089	” Mrs. Jellyby replied ; “
207342	207854	207855	207856	Poor Pa	309	” The next question was how Mrs. Jellyby should be dressed on the occasion . I thought it very curious to see her looking on serenely from her writing - table while Caddy and I discussed it , occasionally shaking her head at us with a half - reproachful smile like a superior spirit who could just bear with our trifling . The state in which her dresses were , and the extraordinary confusion in which she kept them , added not a little to our difficulty ; but at length we devised something not very unlike what a common - place mother might wear on such an occasion . The abstracted manner in which Mrs. Jellyby would deliver herself up to having this attire tried on by the dressmaker , and the sweetness with which she would then observe to me how sorry she was that I had not turned my thoughts to Africa , were consistent with the rest of her behaviour . The lodging was rather confined as to space , but I fancied that if Mrs. Jellyby ’s household had been the only lodgers in Saint Paul ’s or Saint Peter ’s , the sole advantage they would have found in the size of the building would have been its affording a great deal of room to be dirty in . I believe that nothing belonging to the family which it had been possible to break was unbroken at the time of those preparations for Caddy ’s marriage , that nothing which it had been possible to spoil in any way was unspoilt , and that no domestic object which was capable of collecting dirt , from a dear child ’s knee to the door - plate , was without as much dirt as could well accumulate upon it . Poor Mr. Jellyby , who very seldom spoke and almost always sat when he was at home with his head against the wall , became interested when he saw that Caddy and I were attempting to establish some order among all this waste and ruin and took off his coat to help . But such wonderful things came tumbling out of the closets when they were opened — bits of mouldy pie , sour bottles , Mrs. Jellyby ’s caps , letters , tea , forks , odd boots and shoes of children , firewood , wafers , saucepan - lids , damp sugar in odds and ends of paper bags , footstools , blacklead brushes , bread , Mrs. Jellyby ’s bonnets , books with butter sticking to the binding , guttered candle ends put out by being turned upside down in broken candlesticks , nutshells , heads and tails of shrimps , dinner - mats , gloves , coffee - grounds , umbrellas — that he looked frightened , and left off again . But he came regularly every evening and sat without his coat , with his head against the wall , as though he would have helped us if he had known how . “
207858	207882	207855	207856	Poor Pa	309	” said Caddy to me on the night before the great day , when we really had got things a little to rights . “
207950	207973	207944	207944	Ma	308	” Mr. Jellyby could not hear what she said , but he seemed very low indeed and shed tears , I thought . “
207984	207988	207989	207989	I	0	” sobbed Caddy . “
208031	208032	208035	208035	Caddy	300	” “
208037	208067	208035	208035	Caddy	300	” said Mr. Jellyby , looking slowly round from the wail . It was the first time , I think , I ever heard him say three words together . “
208072	208084	208087	208087	Caddy	300	” cried Caddy , going to him and embracing him affectionately . “
208089	208094	208087	208087	Caddy	300	” said Mr. Jellyby . “
208098	208099	208101	208101	Prince	437	” “
208105	208109	208103	208103	Pa	309	” faltered Caddy . “
208114	208115	208118	208119	my dear	9540	” “
208121	208126	208118	208119	my dear	9540	” said Mr. Jellyby . “
208137	208191	208194	208194	you	0	” I mentioned in my account of our first visit in Thavies Inn that Richard described Mr. Jellyby as frequently opening his mouth after dinner without saying anything . It was a habit of his . He opened his mouth now a great many times and shook his head in a melancholy manner . “
208209	208223	208206	208207	dear Pa	309	” asked Caddy , coaxing him , with her arms round his neck . “
208233	208571	208572	208572	My	0	” Mr. Jellyby groaned and laid his head against the wall again , and this was the only time I ever heard him make any approach to expressing his sentiments on the Borrioboolan question . I suppose he had been more talkative and lively once , but he seemed to have been completely exhausted long before I knew him . I thought Mrs. Jellyby never would have left off serenely looking over her papers and drinking coffee that night . It was twelve o’clock before we could obtain possession of the room , and the clearance it required then was so discouraging that Caddy , who was almost tired out , sat down in the middle of the dust and cried . But she soon cheered up , and we did wonders with it before we went to bed . In the morning it looked , by the aid of a few flowers and a quantity of soap and water and a little arrangement , quite gay . The plain breakfast made a cheerful show , and Caddy was perfectly charming . But when my darling came , I thought — and I think now — that I never had seen such a dear face as my beautiful pet ’s . We made a little feast for the children upstairs , and we put Peepy at the head of the table , and we showed them Caddy in her bridal dress , and they clapped their hands and hurrahed , and Caddy cried to think that she was going away from them and hugged them over and over again until we brought Prince up to fetch her away — when , I am sorry to say , Peepy bit him . Then there was old Mr. Turveydrop downstairs , in a state of deportment not to be expressed , benignly blessing Caddy and giving my guardian to understand that his son ’s happiness was his own parental work and that he sacrificed personal considerations to ensure it . “
208576	208581	208572	208572	My	0	” said Mr. Turveydrop , “
208660	209412	209415	209415	you	5105	” Mr. and Mrs. Pardiggle were of the party — Mr. Pardiggle , an obstinate - looking man with a large waistcoat and stubbly hair , who was always talking in a loud bass voice about his mite , or Mrs. Pardiggle ’s mite , or their five boys ’ mites . Mr. Quale , with his hair brushed back as usual and his knobs of temples shining very much , was also there , not in the character of a disappointed lover , but as the accepted of a young — at least , an unmarried — lady , a Miss Wisk , who was also there . Miss Wisk ’s mission , my guardian said , was to show the world that woman ’s mission was man ’s mission and that the only genuine mission of both man and woman was to be always moving declaratory resolutions about things in general at public meetings . The guests were few , but were , as one might expect at Mrs. Jellyby ’s , all devoted to public objects only . Besides those I have mentioned , there was an extremely dirty lady with her bonnet all awry and the ticketed price of her dress still sticking on it , whose neglected home , Caddy told me , was like a filthy wilderness , but whose church was like a fancy fair . A very contentious gentleman , who said it was his mission to be everybody ’s brother but who appeared to be on terms of coolness with the whole of his large family , completed the party . A party , having less in common with such an occasion , could hardly have been got together by any ingenuity . Such a mean mission as the domestic mission was the very last thing to be endured among them ; indeed , Miss Wisk informed us , with great indignation , before we sat down to breakfast , that the idea of woman ’s mission lying chiefly in the narrow sphere of home was an outrageous slander on the part of her tyrant , man . One other singularity was that nobody with a mission — except Mr. Quale , whose mission , as I think I have formerly said , was to be in ecstasies with everybody ’s mission — cared at all for anybody ’s mission . Mrs. Pardiggle being as clear that the only one infallible course was her course of pouncing upon the poor and applying benevolence to them like a strait - waistcoat ; as Miss Wisk was that the only practical thing for the world was the emancipation of woman from the thraldom of her tyrant , man . Mrs. Jellyby , all the while , sat smiling at the limited vision that could see anything but Borrioboola - Gha . But I am anticipating now the purport of our conversation on the ride home instead of first marrying Caddy . We all went to church , and Mr. Jellyby gave her away . Of the air with which old Mr. Turveydrop , with his hat under his left arm ( the inside presented at the clergyman like a cannon ) and his eyes creasing themselves up into his wig , stood stiff and high - shouldered behind us bridesmaids during the ceremony , and afterwards saluted us , I could never say enough to do it justice . Miss Wisk , whom I can not report as prepossessing in appearance , and whose manner was grim , listened to the proceedings , as part of woman ’s wrongs , with a disdainful face . Mrs. Jellyby , with her calm smile and her bright eyes , looked the least concerned of all the company . We duly came back to breakfast , and Mrs. Jellyby sat at the head of the table and Mr. Jellyby at the foot . Caddy had previously stolen upstairs to hug the children again and tell them that her name was Turveydrop . But this piece of information , instead of being an agreeable surprise to Peepy , threw him on his back in such transports of kicking grief that I could do nothing on being sent for but accede to the proposal that he should be admitted to the breakfast table . So he came down and sat in my lap ; and Mrs. Jellyby , after saying , in reference to the state of his pinafore , “
209427	209691	209692	209692	I	0	” was not at all discomposed . He was very good except that he brought down Noah with him ( out of an ark I had given him before we went to church ) and WOULD dip him head first into the wine - glasses and then put him in his mouth . My guardian , with his sweet temper and his quick perception and his amiable face , made something agreeable even out of the ungenial company . None of them seemed able to talk about anything but his , or her , own one subject , and none of them seemed able to talk about even that as part of a world in which there was anything else ; but my guardian turned it all to the merry encouragement of Caddy and the honour of the occasion , and brought us through the breakfast nobly . What we should have done without him , I am afraid to think , for all the company despising the bride and bridegroom and old Mr. Turveydrop — and old Mr. Thurveydrop , in virtue of his deportment , considering himself vastly superior to all the company — it was a very unpromising case . At last the time came when poor Caddy was to go and when all her property was packed on the hired coach and pair that was to take her and her husband to Gravesend . It affected us to see Caddy clinging , then , to her deplorable home and hanging on her mother ’s neck with the greatest tenderness . “
209707	209711	209705	209705	Ma	308	” sobbed Caddy . “
209719	209720	209714	209714	you	308	” “
209727	209732	209725	209725	Caddy	300	” said Mrs. Jellyby . “
209756	209757	209733	209733	I	0	” “
209783	209784	209781	209781	Ma	308	” “
209789	209794	209785	209785	You	300	” returned Mrs. Jellyby , “
209818	209819	209816	209816	you	308	” “
209833	209842	209843	209843	You	300	” Mrs. Jellyby positively laughed at the fancy . “
209847	209857	209843	209843	You	300	” said she , lightly patting Caddy ’s back . “
209881	209979	209987	209987	father	2776	” Then Caddy hung upon her father and nursed his cheek against hers as if he were some poor dull child in pain . All this took place in the hall . Her father released her , took out his pocket handkerchief , and sat down on the stairs with his head against the wall . I hope he found some consolation in walls . I almost think he did . And then Prince took her arm in his and turned with great emotion and respect to his father , whose deportment at that moment was overwhelming . “
209989	209997	209987	209987	father	2776	” said Prince , kissing his hand . “
210023	210024	210021	210021	Caddy	300	” “
210027	210031	210021	210021	Caddy	300	” sobbed Caddy . “

210042	210047	210038	210040	My dear son	4067	” said Mr. Turveydrop , “

210110	210114	210105	210106	Dear father	4114	” cried Prince . “

210130	210135	210119	210121	dear Mr. Turveydrop	437	” returned Mr. Turveydrop , “

210309	210326	210307	210307	Prince	437	” anticipating some self - denying objection on his son ’s part with a great air . “
210358	210455	210356	210356	ye	4096	” They drove away , and whether I wondered most at Mrs. Jellyby or at Mr. Turveydrop , I did not know . Ada and my guardian were in the same condition when we came to talk it over . But before we drove away too , I received a most unexpected and eloquent compliment from Mr. Jellyby . He came up to me in the hall , took both my hands , pressed them earnestly , and opened his mouth twice . I was so sure of his meaning that I said , quite flurried , “
210469	210470	210471	210471	I	0	” “
210482	210494	210480	210480	guardian	10146	” said I when we three were on our road home . “
210509	210510	210505	210505	We	5139	” “
210521	210534	210505	210505	We	5139	” I ventured to ask him . He laughed heartily and answered , “
210537	210538	210505	210505	We	5139	” “
210550	210555	210547	210547	I	0	” said I. He answered “
210557	210568	210547	210547	I	0	” again , and this time my dear girl confidently answered “
210570	210594	210547	210547	I	0	” too and shook the lovely head which , with its blooming flowers against the golden hair , was like the very spring . “
210606	210843	210596	210596	YOU	5140	” said I , kissing her in my admiration — I could n’t help it . Well ! It was only their love for me , I know very well , and it is a long time ago . I must write it even if I rub it out again , because it gives me so much pleasure . They said there could be no east wind where Somebody was ; they said that wherever Dame Durden went , there was sunshine and summer air . CHAPTER XXXI Nurse and Patient I had not been at home again many days when one evening I went upstairs into my own room to take a peep over Charley ’s shoulder and see how she was getting on with her copy - book . Writing was a trying business to Charley , who seemed to have no natural power over a pen , but in whose hand every pen appeared to become perversely animated , and to go wrong and crooked , and to stop , and splash , and sidle into corners like a saddle - donkey . It was very odd to see what old letters Charley ’s young hand had made , they so wrinkled , and shrivelled , and tottering , it so plump and round . Yet Charley was uncommonly expert at other things and had as nimble little fingers as I ever watched . “
210848	210882	210846	210846	Charley	336	” said I , looking over a copy of the letter O in which it was represented as square , triangular , pear - shaped , and collapsed in all kinds of ways , “
210903	210932	210901	210901	Charley	336	” Then I made one , and Charley made one , and the pen would n’t join Charley ’s neatly , but twisted it up into a knot . “
210945	210989	210936	210936	Charley	336	” Charley laid down her pen , the copy being finished , opened and shut her cramped little hand , looked gravely at the page , half in pride and half in doubt , and got up , and dropped me a curtsy . “
211013	211014	211011	211011	Jenny	357	” “
211024	211025	211026	211026	She	5146	” “
211079	211080	211073	211073	I	0	” “
211092	211093	211083	211083	she	5146	” “
211131	211132	211129	211129	miss	9584	” “
211145	211146	211150	211150	she	5146	” “
211153	211157	211150	211150	she	5146	” returned Charley . “
211174	211175	211182	211182	they	5159	” “
211186	211187	211190	211190	miss	9584	” “
211192	211223	211190	211190	miss	9584	” If Charley could only have made the letters in her copy as round as the eyes with which she looked into my face , they would have been excellent . “
211276	211290	211292	211292	she	5146	” said Charley with a short laugh of the greatest delight and pride , “
211300	211301	211303	211303	she	5146	” “
211310	211311	211303	211303	she	5146	” “
211316	211320	211303	211303	she	5146	” said Charley . “
211325	211399	211303	211303	she	5146	” And Charley , with another short laugh of the purest glee , made her eyes very round again and looked as serious as became my maid . I was never tired of seeing Charley in the full enjoyment of that great dignity , standing before me with her youthful face and figure , and her steady manner , and her childish exultation breaking through it now and then in the pleasantest way . “
211409	211422	211405	211405	her	5146	” said I. My little maid ’s countenance fell as she replied , “
211431	211499	211405	211405	her	5146	” For Charley wore her black frock yet . I asked if the brickmaker ’s wife were ill , but Charley said no . It was some one else . Some one in her cottage who had tramped down to Saint Albans and was tramping he did n’t know where . A poor boy , Charley said . No father , no mother , no any one . “
211518	211529	211510	211510	Emma	450	” said Charley , her round eyes filling with tears . “
211540	211541	211542	211542	She	450	” “
211547	211551	211542	211542	She	450	” returned Charley , “
211563	211600	211542	211542	She	450	” My little maid ’s face was so eager and her quiet hands were folded so closely in one another as she stood looking at me that I had no great difficulty in reading her thoughts . “
211605	211609	211603	211603	Charley	336	” said I , “
211635	212243	212244	212244	I	0	” The alacrity with which Charley brought my bonnet and veil , and having dressed me , quaintly pinned herself into her warm shawl and made herself look like a little old woman , sufficiently expressed her readiness . So Charley and I , without saying anything to any one , went out . It was a cold , wild night , and the trees shuddered in the wind . The rain had been thick and heavy all day , and with little intermission for many days . None was falling just then , however . The sky had partly cleared , but was very gloomy — even above us , where a few stars were shining . In the north and north - west , where the sun had set three hours before , there was a pale dead light both beautiful and awful ; and into it long sullen lines of cloud waved up like a sea stricken immovable as it was heaving . Towards London a lurid glare overhung the whole dark waste , and the contrast between these two lights , and the fancy which the redder light engendered of an unearthly fire , gleaming on all the unseen buildings of the city and on all the faces of its many thousands of wondering inhabitants , was as solemn as might be . I had no thought that night — none , I am quite sure — of what was soon to happen to me . But I have always remembered since that when we had stopped at the garden - gate to look up at the sky , and when we went upon our way , I had for a moment an undefinable impression of myself as being something different from what I then was . I know it was then and there that I had it . I have ever since connected the feeling with that spot and time and with everything associated with that spot and time , to the distant voices in the town , the barking of a dog , and the sound of wheels coming down the miry hill . It was Saturday night , and most of the people belonging to the place where we were going were drinking elsewhere . We found it quieter than I had previously seen it , though quite as miserable . The kilns were burning , and a stifling vapour set towards us with a pale - blue glare . We came to the cottage , where there was a feeble candle in the patched window . We tapped at the door and went in . The mother of the little child who had died was sitting in a chair on one side of the poor fire by the bed ; and opposite to her , a wretched boy , supported by the chimney - piece , was cowering on the floor . He held under his arm , like a little bundle , a fragment of a fur cap ; and as he tried to warm himself , he shook until the crazy door and window shook . The place was closer than before and had an unhealthy and a very peculiar smell . I had not lifted my veil when I first spoke to the woman , which was at the moment of our going in . The boy staggered up instantly and stared at me with a remarkable expression of surprise and terror . His action was so quick and my being the cause of it was so evident that I stood still instead of advancing nearer . “
212255	212260	212244	212244	I	0	” muttered the boy ; “
212274	212294	212270	212270	I	0	” I lifted my veil and spoke to the woman . She said to me in a low voice , “
212311	212317	212318	212318	Jo	389	” and said to him , “
212327	212328	212318	212318	Jo	389	” “
212337	212342	212332	212332	she	5177	” cried the boy . “
212345	212346	212347	212349	The lady there	5178	” “
212393	212413	212414	212414	He	5181	” His shivering came on again , and as he leaned against the wall , he shook the hovel . “
212429	212434	212414	212414	He	5181	” said Jenny softly . “
212448	212449	212446	212446	Jo	389	” “
212453	212472	212473	212473	She	5178	” returned the boy doubtfully , and surveying me with his arm held out above his burning eyes . “
212504	212568	212496	212496	she	5178	” My little Charley , with her premature experience of illness and trouble , had pulled off her bonnet and shawl and now went quietly up to him with a chair and sat him down in it like an old sick nurse . Except that no such attendant could have shown him Charley ’s youthful face , which seemed to engage his confidence . “
212572	212577	212578	212578	YOU	5185	” said the boy . “
212590	212612	212584	212585	the lady	1180	” Charley shook her head as she methodically drew his rags about him and made him as warm as she could . “
212615	212620	212584	212585	the lady	1180	” the boy muttered . “
212628	212629	212622	212622	I	0	” “
212642	212645	212622	212622	I	0	” said I. “
212653	212654	212655	212655	I	0	” “
212662	212676	212657	212660	a - being froze	5188	” returned the boy hoarsely , with his haggard gaze wandering about me , “
212733	212734	212751	212751	ma’am	9572	” “
212741	212747	212737	212737	he	0	” I asked the woman . “
212778	212779	212776	212776	Jo	389	” “
212787	212833	212776	212776	Jo	389	” the boy replied . Whenever he fixed his attention or his eyes , it was only for a very little while . He soon began to droop his head again , and roll it heavily , and speak as if he were half awake . “
212841	212845	212836	212836	he	0	” I asked . “
212852	212863	212864	212864	I	0	” said the boy himself , now flushed and hot . “
212871	212872	212864	212864	I	0	” “
212878	212882	212875	212875	he	0	” I asked . “
212885	212894	212875	212875	he	0	” repeated the boy in a louder tone . “
213038	213046	213004	213004	She	364	” He always concluded by addressing Charley . “
213055	213064	213065	213065	He	0	” said I , taking the woman aside . “
213085	213086	213087	213087	I	0	” “
213098	213107	213087	213087	I	0	” she replied , glancing compassionately at him . “
213217	213430	213431	213431	Jenny	357	” The other woman came hurriedly in as she spoke , and the boy got up with a half - obscured sense that he was expected to be going . When the little child awoke , and when and how Charley got at it , took it out of bed , and began to walk about hushing it , I do n’t know . There she was , doing all this in a quiet motherly manner as if she were living in Mrs. Blinder ’s attic with Tom and Emma again . The friend had been here and there , and had been played about from hand to hand , and had come back as she went . At first it was too early for the boy to be received into the proper refuge , and at last it was too late . One official sent her to another , and the other sent her back again to the first , and so backward and forward , until it appeared to me as if both must have been appointed for their skill in evading their duties instead of performing them . And now , after all , she said , breathing quickly , for she had been running and was frightened too , “
213464	213501	213449	213450	the Lord	11037	” They put a few halfpence together and hurried them into his hand , and so , in an oblivious , half - thankful , half - insensible way , he shuffled out of the house . “
213510	213517	213449	213450	the Lord	11037	” said its mother to Charley , “
213570	213791	213792	213792	I	0	” She hurried off , and presently we passed her hushing and singing to her child at her own door and looking anxiously along the road for her drunken husband . I was afraid of staying then to speak to either woman , lest I should bring her into trouble . But I said to Charley that we must not leave the boy to die . Charley , who knew what to do much better than I did , and whose quickness equalled her presence of mind , glided on before me , and presently we came up with Jo , just short of the brick - kiln . I think he must have begun his journey with some small bundle under his arm and must have had it stolen or lost it . For he still carried his wretched fragment of fur cap like a bundle , though he went bare - headed through the rain , which now fell fast . He stopped when we called to him and again showed a dread of me when I came up , standing with his lustrous eyes fixed upon me , and even arrested in his shivering fit . I asked him to come with us , and we would take care that he had some shelter for the night . “
213799	213803	213792	213792	I	0	” he said ; “
213812	213813	213792	213792	I	0	” “
213824	213828	213817	213817	you	0	” replied Charley . “
213833	213838	213829	213829	They	858	” said the boy . “
213880	213887	213889	213889	she	5223	” Then he hoarsely whispered Charley , “
213909	214156	213906	213906	’em	5225	” Charley looked at me a little frightened . I felt half frightened at myself when the boy glared on me so . But he turned and followed when I beckoned to him , and finding that he acknowledged that influence in me , I led the way straight home . It was not far , only at the summit of the hill . We passed but one man . I doubted if we should have got home without assistance , the boy ’s steps were so uncertain and tremulous . He made no complaint , however , and was strangely unconcerned about himself , if I may say so strange a thing . Leaving him in the hall for a moment , shrunk into the corner of the window - seat and staring with an indifference that scarcely could be called wonder at the comfort and brightness about him , I went into the drawing - room to speak to my guardian . There I found Mr. Skimpole , who had come down by the coach , as he frequently did without notice , and never bringing any clothes with him , but always borrowing everything he wanted . They came out with me directly to look at the boy . The servants had gathered in the hall too , and he shivered in the window - seat with Charley standing by him , like some wounded animal that had been found in a ditch . “
214163	214182	213906	213906	’em	5225	” said my guardian after asking him a question or two and touching him and examining his eyes . “
214190	214191	214185	214185	you	5226	” “
214199	214204	214192	214192	You	5226	” said Mr. Skimpole . “
214210	214218	214207	214207	you	5226	” inquired my guardian , almost sternly . “
214223	214228	214229	214229	you	286	” said Mr. Skimpole , “
214291	214324	214325	214325	You	286	” Mr. Skimpole had retreated from the hall to the drawing - room again and said this in his airy way , seated on the music - stool as we stood by . “
214332	214342	214325	214325	You	286	” observed Mr. Skimpole , looking gaily at us . “
214436	214437	214423	214423	arithmeticians	5232	” “
214446	214451	214441	214441	he	323	” asked my guardian . “
214456	214469	214441	214441	he	323	” said Mr. Skimpole , shrugging his shoulders with his engaging smile , “
214493	214494	214488	214488	he	323	” “
214504	214523	214488	214488	he	323	” said my guardian , to whom I had hastily explained the unavailing efforts of the two women , “
214531	214541	214488	214488	he	323	” walking up and down and rumpling his hair , “
214578	214579	214580	214580	My	0	” “
214584	214589	214580	214580	My	0	” returned Mr. Skimpole , “
214622	214642	214643	214643	Our	5240	” My guardian stopped and looked at him with a whimsical mixture of amusement and indignation in his face . “
214659	214668	214655	214655	I	0	” said Mr. Skimpole , unabashed and candid . “
214724	214725	214726	214726	I	0	” “
214729	214739	214726	214726	I	0	” returned my guardian , resuming his uneasy walk , “
214752	214753	214755	214755	you	0	” “
214758	214763	214764	214764	I	0	” said Mr. Skimpole . “
214990	214991	215026	215026	her	280	” “
214996	215002	215026	215026	her	280	” I ventured to observe , “
215008	215009	215026	215026	her	280	” “
215014	215020	215026	215026	her	280	” said Mr. Skimpole cheerfully , “
215051	215068	215041	215041	your	1748	” The amiable face with which he said it , I think I shall never forget . “
215075	215084	215072	215073	little woman	2039	” observed my guardian , turning to me , “
215178	215179	215173	215173	We	5260	” “
215182	215201	215173	215173	We	5260	” said Mr. Skimpole , with his hands upon the keys of the piano as we moved away . “
215211	215212	215203	215203	you	0	” “
215215	215220	215203	215203	you	0	” said my guardian . “
215230	215238	215239	215239	You	0	” returned Mr. Skimpole with playful admiration . “
215284	215285	215286	215286	You	0	” “
215298	215327	215286	215286	You	0	” said my guardian , looking back over his shoulder half angrily ; only half angrily , for he never seemed to consider Mr. Skimpole an accountable being . “
215418	215536	215412	215412	she	280	” We went back into the hall and explained to Jo what we proposed to do , which Charley explained to him again and which he received with the languid unconcern I had already noticed , wearily looking on at what was done as if it were for somebody else . The servants compassionating his miserable state and being very anxious to help , we soon got the loft - room ready ; and some of the men about the house carried him across the wet yard , well wrapped up . It was pleasant to observe how kind they were to him and how there appeared to be a general impression among them that frequently calling him “
215539	215738	215412	215412	she	280	” was likely to revive his spirits . Charley directed the operations and went to and fro between the loft - room and the house with such little stimulants and comforts as we thought it safe to give him . My guardian himself saw him before he was left for the night and reported to me when he returned to the growlery to write a letter on the boy ’s behalf , which a messenger was charged to deliver at day - light in the morning , that he seemed easier and inclined to sleep . They had fastened his door on the outside , he said , in case of his being delirious , but had so arranged that he could not make any noise without being heard . Ada being in our room with a cold , Mr. Skimpole was left alone all this time and entertained himself by playing snatches of pathetic airs and sometimes singing to them ( as we heard at a distance ) with great expression and feeling . When we rejoined him in the drawing - room he said he would give us a little ballad which had come into his head “
215745	215755	215412	215412	she	280	” and he sang one about a peasant boy , “
215778	215842	215412	215412	she	280	” quite exquisitely . It was a song that always made him cry , he told us . He was extremely gay all the rest of the evening , for he absolutely chirped — those were his delighted words — when he thought by what a happy talent for business he was surrounded . He gave us , in his glass of negus , “
215850	216091	215412	215412	she	280	” and supposed and gaily pursued the case of his being reserved like Whittington to become Lord Mayor of London . In that event , no doubt , he would establish the Jarndyce Institution and the Summerson Almshouses , and a little annual Corporation Pilgrimage to St. Albans . He had no doubt , he said , that our young friend was an excellent boy in his way , but his way was not the Harold Skimpole way ; what Harold Skimpole was , Harold Skimpole had found himself , to his considerable surprise , when he first made his own acquaintance ; he had accepted himself with all his failings and had thought it sound philosophy to make the best of the bargain ; and he hoped we would do the same . Charley ’s last report was that the boy was quiet . I could see , from my window , the lantern they had left him burning quietly ; and I went to bed very happy to think that he was sheltered . There was more movement and more talking than usual a little before daybreak , and it awoke me . As I was dressing , I looked out of my window and asked one of our men who had been among the active sympathizers last night whether there was anything wrong about the house . The lantern was still burning in the loft - window . “
216099	216103	216097	216097	miss	9584	” said he . “
216108	216112	216115	216115	miss	9584	” I inquired . “
216117	216118	216115	216115	miss	9584	” “
216121	216122	216125	216125	miss	9584	” “
216133	216556	216557	216557	Charley	336	” At what time of the night he had gone , or how , or why , it seemed hopeless ever to divine . The door remaining as it had been left , and the lantern standing in the window , it could only be supposed that he had got out by a trap in the floor which communicated with an empty cart - house below . But he had shut it down again , if that were so ; and it looked as if it had not been raised . Nothing of any kind was missing . On this fact being clearly ascertained , we all yielded to the painful belief that delirium had come upon him in the night and that , allured by some imaginary object or pursued by some imaginary horror , he had strayed away in that worse than helpless state ; all of us , that is to say , but Mr. Skimpole , who repeatedly suggested , in his usual easy light style , that it had occurred to our young friend that he was not a safe inmate , having a bad kind of fever upon him , and that he had with great natural politeness taken himself off . Every possible inquiry was made , and every place was searched . The brick - kilns were examined , the cottages were visited , the two women were particularly questioned , but they knew nothing of him , and nobody could doubt that their wonder was genuine . The weather had for some time been too wet and the night itself had been too wet to admit of any tracing by footsteps . Hedge and ditch , and wall , and rick and stack , were examined by our men for a long distance round , lest the boy should be lying in such a place insensible or dead ; but nothing was seen to indicate that he had ever been near . From the time when he was left in the loft - room , he vanished . The search continued for five days . I do not mean that it ceased even then , but that my attention was then diverted into a current very memorable to me . As Charley was at her writing again in my room in the evening , and as I sat opposite to her at work , I felt the table tremble . Looking up , I saw my little maid shivering from head to foot . “
216559	216563	216576	216576	miss	9584	” said I , “
216569	216570	216571	216571	I	0	” “
216578	216582	216571	216571	I	0	” she replied . “
216621	216682	216617	216617	I	0	” I heard Ada ’s voice outside , and I hurried to the door of communication between my room and our pretty sitting - room , and locked it . Just in time , for she tapped at it while my hand was yet upon the key . Ada called to me to let her in , but I said , “
216705	217917	216698	216698	I	0	” Ah ! It was a long , long time before my darling girl and I were companions again . Charley fell ill . In twelve hours she was very ill . I moved her to my room , and laid her in my bed , and sat down quietly to nurse her . I told my guardian all about it , and why I felt it was necessary that I should seclude myself , and my reason for not seeing my darling above all . At first she came very often to the door , and called to me , and even reproached me with sobs and tears ; but I wrote her a long letter saying that she made me anxious and unhappy and imploring her , as she loved me and wished my mind to be at peace , to come no nearer than the garden . After that she came beneath the window even oftener than she had come to the door , and if I had learnt to love her dear sweet voice before when we were hardly ever apart , how did I learn to love it then , when I stood behind the window - curtain listening and replying , but not so much as looking out ! How did I learn to love it afterwards , when the harder time came ! They put a bed for me in our sitting - room ; and by keeping the door wide open , I turned the two rooms into one , now that Ada had vacated that part of the house , and kept them always fresh and airy . There was not a servant in or about the house but was so good that they would all most gladly have come to me at any hour of the day or night without the least fear or unwillingness , but I thought it best to choose one worthy woman who was never to see Ada and whom I could trust to come and go with all precaution . Through her means I got out to take the air with my guardian when there was no fear of meeting Ada , and wanted for nothing in the way of attendance , any more than in any other respect . And thus poor Charley sickened and grew worse , and fell into heavy danger of death , and lay severely ill for many a long round of day and night . So patient she was , so uncomplaining , and inspired by such a gentle fortitude that very often as I sat by Charley holding her head in my arms — repose would come to her , so , when it would come to her in no other attitude — I silently prayed to our Father in heaven that I might not forget the lesson which this little sister taught me . I was very sorrowful to think that Charley ’s pretty looks would change and be disfigured , even if she recovered — she was such a child with her dimpled face — but that thought was , for the greater part , lost in her greater peril . When she was at the worst , and her mind rambled again to the cares of her father ’s sick bed and the little children , she still knew me so far as that she would be quiet in my arms when she could lie quiet nowhere else , and murmur out the wanderings of her mind less restlessly . At those times I used to think , how should I ever tell the two remaining babies that the baby who had learned of her faithful heart to be a mother to them in their need was dead ! There were other times when Charley knew me well and talked to me , telling me that she sent her love to Tom and Emma and that she was sure Tom would grow up to be a good man . At those times Charley would speak to me of what she had read to her father as well as she could to comfort him , of that young man carried out to be buried who was the only son of his mother and she was a widow , of the ruler ’s daughter raised up by the gracious hand upon her bed of death . And Charley told me that when her father died she had kneeled down and prayed in her first sorrow that he likewise might be raised up and given back to his poor children , and that if she should never get better and should die too , she thought it likely that it might come into Tom ’s mind to offer the same prayer for her . Then would I show Tom how these people of old days had been brought back to life on earth , only that we might know our hope to be restored to heaven ! But of all the various times there were in Charley ’s illness , there was not one when she lost the gentle qualities I have spoken of . And there were many , many when I thought in the night of the last high belief in the watching angel , and the last higher trust in God , on the part of her poor despised father . And Charley did not die . She flutteringly and slowly turned the dangerous point , after long lingering there , and then began to mend . The hope that never had been given , from the first , of Charley being in outward appearance Charley any more soon began to be encouraged ; and even that prospered , and I saw her growing into her old childish likeness again . It was a great morning when I could tell Ada all this as she stood out in the garden ; and it was a great evening when Charley and I at last took tea together in the next room . But on that same evening , I felt that I was stricken cold . Happily for both of us , it was not until Charley was safe in bed again and placidly asleep that I began to think the contagion of her illness was upon me . I had been able easily to hide what I felt at tea - time , but I was past that already now , and I knew that I was rapidly following in Charley ’s steps . I was well enough , however , to be up early in the morning , and to return my darling ’s cheerful blessing from the garden , and to talk with her as long as usual . But I was not free from an impression that I had been walking about the two rooms in the night , a little beside myself , though knowing where I was ; and I felt confused at times — with a curious sense of fullness , as if I were becoming too large altogether . In the evening I was so much worse that I resolved to prepare Charley , with which view I said , “
217930	217931	217927	217927	you	5279	” “
217936	217940	217927	217927	you	5279	” said Charley . “
217954	217955	217952	217952	Charley	336	” “
217964	218006	217962	217962	miss	9584	” cried Charley . But Charley ’s face fell in the height of her delight , for she saw the secret in MY face ; and she came out of the great chair , and fell upon my bosom , and said “
218021	218036	218018	218018	my	0	” and a great deal more out of the fullness of her grateful heart . “
218041	218054	218039	218039	Charley	336	” said I after letting her go on for a little while , “
218098	218099	218096	218096	Charley	336	” “
218112	218116	218101	218101	you	9584	” said Charley . “
218139	218159	218126	218126	you	9584	dear!”—how affectionately and devotedly she poured this out as she clung to my neck , I never can remember without tears—“I’ll
218163	218180	218126	218126	you	9584	” So I let Charley cry a little longer , and it did us both good . “
218192	218197	218187	218187	you	9584	” said Charley quietly . “
218206	218207	218187	218187	you	9584	” “
218242	218255	218235	218235	you	5285	” For that the poor child thanked me with her whole heart . “
218330	218463	218322	218322	Charley	336	” Charley promised , and I lay down , for I was very heavy . I saw the doctor that night and asked the favour of him that I wished to ask relative to his saying nothing of my illness in the house as yet . I have a very indistinct remembrance of that night melting into day , and of day melting into night again ; but I was just able on the first morning to get to the window and speak to my darling . On the second morning I heard her dear voice — Oh , how dear now!—outside ; and I asked Charley , with some difficulty ( speech being painful to me ) , to go and say I was asleep . I heard her answer softly , “
218475	218476	218469	218469	Charley	336	” “
218486	218490	218484	218484	Charley	336	” I inquired . “
218495	218504	218493	218493	miss	9584	” said Charley , peeping through the curtain . “
218515	218516	218517	218517	She	5289	” “
218523	218529	218521	218521	miss	9584	” answered Charley , peeping . “
218537	218567	218521	218521	miss	9584	” With her blue clear eyes , God bless them , always loveliest when raised like that ! I called Charley to me and gave her her last charge . “
218633	218634	218635	218635	I	0	” “
218643	218648	218649	218649	I	0	” she promised me . “
218689	219033	218683	218683	Charley	336	” CHAPTER XXXII The Appointed Time It is night in Lincoln ’s Inn — perplexed and troublous valley of the shadow of the law , where suitors generally find but little day — and fat candles are snuffed out in offices , and clerks have rattled down the crazy wooden stairs and dispersed . The bell that rings at nine o’clock has ceased its doleful clangour about nothing ; the gates are shut ; and the night - porter , a solemn warder with a mighty power of sleep , keeps guard in his lodge . From tiers of staircase windows clogged lamps like the eyes of Equity , bleared Argus with a fathomless pocket for every eye and an eye upon it , dimly blink at the stars . In dirty upper casements , here and there , hazy little patches of candlelight reveal where some wise draughtsman and conveyancer yet toils for the entanglement of real estate in meshes of sheep - skin , in the average ratio of about a dozen of sheep to an acre of land . Over which bee - like industry these benefactors of their species linger yet , though office - hours be past , that they may give , for every day , some good account at last . In the neighbouring court , where the Lord Chancellor of the rag and bottle shop dwells , there is a general tendency towards beer and supper . Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins , whose respective sons , engaged with a circle of acquaintance in the game of hide and seek , have been lying in ambush about the by - ways of Chancery Lane for some hours and scouring the plain of the same thoroughfare to the confusion of passengers — Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins have but now exchanged congratulations on the children being abed , and they still linger on a door - step over a few parting words . Mr. Krook and his lodger , and the fact of Mr. Krook ’s being “
219038	219133	218683	218683	Charley	336	” and the testamentary prospects of the young man are , as usual , the staple of their conversation . But they have something to say , likewise , of the Harmonic Meeting at the Sol ’s Arms , where the sound of the piano through the partly opened windows jingles out into the court , and where Little Swills , after keeping the lovers of harmony in a roar like a very Yorick , may now be heard taking the gruff line in a concerted piece and sentimentally adjuring his friends and patrons to “
219147	219235	219240	219240	myself	0	” Mrs. Perkins and Mrs. Piper compare opinions on the subject of the young lady of professional celebrity who assists at the Harmonic Meetings and who has a space to herself in the manuscript announcement in the window , Mrs. Perkins possessing information that she has been married a year and a half , though announced as Miss M. Melvilleson , the noted siren , and that her baby is clandestinely conveyed to the Sol ’s Arms every night to receive its natural nourishment during the entertainments . “
219242	219247	219240	219240	myself	0	” says Mrs. Perkins , “
219257	219779	219782	219783	Mr. Weevle	489	” Mrs. Piper , as in duty bound , is of the same opinion , holding that a private station is better than public applause , and thanking heaven for her own ( and , by implication , Mrs. Perkins ’ ) respectability . By this time the pot - boy of the Sol ’s Arms appearing with her supper - pint well frothed , Mrs. Piper accepts that tankard and retires indoors , first giving a fair good night to Mrs. Perkins , who has had her own pint in her hand ever since it was fetched from the same hostelry by young Perkins before he was sent to bed . Now there is a sound of putting up shop - shutters in the court and a smell as of the smoking of pipes ; and shooting stars are seen in upper windows , further indicating retirement to rest . Now , too , the policeman begins to push at doors ; to try fastenings ; to be suspicious of bundles ; and to administer his beat , on the hypothesis that every one is either robbing or being robbed . It is a close night , though the damp cold is searching too , and there is a laggard mist a little way up in the air . It is a fine steaming night to turn the slaughter - houses , the unwholesome trades , the sewerage , bad water , and burial - grounds to account , and give the registrar of deaths some extra business . It may be something in the air — there is plenty in it — or it may be something in himself that is in fault ; but Mr. Weevle , otherwise Jobling , is very ill at ease . He comes and goes between his own room and the open street door twenty times an hour . He has been doing so ever since it fell dark . Since the Chancellor shut up his shop , which he did very early to - night , Mr. Weevle has been down and up , and down and up ( with a cheap tight velvet skull - cap on his head , making his whiskers look out of all proportion ) , oftener than before . It is no phenomenon that Mr. Snagsby should be ill at ease too , for he always is so , more or less , under the oppressive influence of the secret that is upon him . Impelled by the mystery of which he is a partaker and yet in which he is not a sharer , Mr. Snagsby haunts what seems to be its fountain - head — the rag and bottle shop in the court . It has an irresistible attraction for him . Even now , coming round by the Sol ’s Arms with the intention of passing down the court , and out at the Chancery Lane end , and so terminating his unpremeditated after - supper stroll of ten minutes ’ long from his own door and back again , Mr. Snagsby approaches . “
219785	219794	219782	219783	Mr. Weevle	489	” says the stationer , stopping to speak . “
219799	219800	219796	219796	YOU	489	” “
219803	219807	219796	219796	YOU	489	” says Weevle , “
219815	219816	219809	219809	I	0	” “
219831	219836	219818	219818	yourself	489	” the stationer inquires . “
219859	219870	219874	219874	sir	9496	” Weevle answers , glancing up and down the court . “
219881	219896	219878	219878	you	9496	” says Mr. Snagsby , pausing to sniff and taste the air a little , “
219927	219928	219925	219925	sir	9496	” “
219950	219955	219956	219956	I	0	” Mr. Weevle rejoins . “
219967	219968	219972	219972	you	9496	” “
219981	219989	219972	219972	you	9496	” Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes again . “
220026	220039	220023	220023	I	0	think”—Mr . Snagsby sniffs and tastes again and then spits and wipes his mouth—“I
220066	220067	220023	220023	I	0	” “
220081	220082	220023	220023	I	0	” “
220091	220096	220098	220098	I	0	” says Mr. Snagsby , “

220119	220124	220111	220111	I	0	” returns Mr. Weevle . “
220151	220180	220130	220130	you	9496	” says Mr. Snagsby , looking in past the other ’s shoulder along the dark passage and then falling back a step to look up at the house . “
220253	220254	220255	220255	I	0	” “
220262	220266	220255	220255	I	0	” returns Tony . “
220275	220290	220303	220303	he	249	” pursues Mr. Snagsby , coughing his cough of mild persuasion behind his hand . “
220310	220311	220314	220314	he	249	” “
220317	220321	220312	220312	I	0	” says Tony . “
220327	220328	220323	220323	I	0	” “
220341	220346	220337	220337	you	9496	” returns the stationer . “
220375	220384	220386	220386	I	0	” adds Mr. Snagsby with his apologetic cough , “
220401	220449	220386	220386	I	0	” Mr. Weevle again glances up and down the court and then looks at the stationer . Mr. Snagsby , blankly catching his eye , looks upward for a star or so and coughs a cough expressive of not exactly seeing his way out of this conversation . “
220458	220467	220386	220386	I	0	” he observes , slowly rubbing his hands , “
220474	220475	220478	220478	he	5313	” “
220480	220485	220478	220478	he	5313	” interrupts Mr. Weevle . “
220492	220514	220486	220487	The deceased	10627	” says Mr. Snagsby , twitching his head and right eyebrow towards the staircase and tapping his acquaintance on the button . “
220521	220537	220538	220538	I	0	” returns the other as if he were not over - fond of the subject . “
220546	220547	220538	220538	I	0	” “
220610	220634	220636	220636	I	0	” says Mr. Snagsby , breaking off with a mistrust that he may have unpolitely asserted a kind of proprietorship in Mr. Weevle , “
220659	220674	220657	220657	sir	9496	” adds Mr. Snagsby with a misgiving that he has not improved the matter . “
220685	220698	220682	220682	you	9496	” answers Weevle , once more glancing up and down the court . “
220709	220714	220682	220682	you	9496	” suggests the stationer . “
220718	220719	220682	220682	you	9496	” “
220723	220732	220682	220682	you	9496	” observes the stationer with his confirmatory cough . “
220756	220785	220682	220682	you	9496	night”—Mr . Snagsby speaks as if it made him desolate to go , though he has been casting about for any means of escape ever since he stopped to speak—“my
220800	220875	220798	220798	sir	9496	” If Mr. Snagsby hastens home to save his little woman the trouble of looking for him , he might set his mind at rest on that score . His little woman has had her eye upon him round the Sol ’s Arms all this time and now glides after him with a pocket handkerchief wrapped over her head , honouring Mr. Weevle and his doorway with a searching glance as she goes past . “
220888	220895	220876	220876	You	5324	” says Mr. Weevle to himself ; “
220925	220989	220920	220921	this fellow	2158	” This fellow approaches as he speaks . Mr. Weevle softly holds up his finger , and draws him into the passage , and closes the street door . Then they go upstairs , Mr. Weevle heavily , and Mr. Guppy ( for it is he ) very lightly indeed . When they are shut into the back room , they speak low . “
221004	221008	220990	220990	I	0	” says Tony . “
221016	221017	221011	221011	I	0	” “
221023	221027	221018	221018	You	5324	” Tony repeats . “

221125	221150	221182	221182	you	5324	” says Tony , pointing to the heavily burning taper on his table with a great cabbage head and a long winding - sheet . “
221156	221168	221182	221182	you	5324	” Mr. Guppy observes as he takes the snuffers in hand . “
221172	221177	221182	221182	you	5324	” returns his friend . “
221197	221198	221182	221182	you	5324	” “
221210	221234	221235	221236	William Guppy	297	” inquires Mr. Guppy , looking at him , snuffers in hand , as he sits down with his elbow on the table . “
221238	221243	221235	221236	William Guppy	297	” replies the other , “
221267	221327	221260	221261	old Boguey	568	” Mr. Weevle moodily pushes the snuffers - tray from him with his elbow , leans his head on his hand , puts his feet on the fender , and looks at the fire . Mr. Guppy , observing him , slightly tosses his head and sits down on the other side of the table in an easy attitude . “
221338	221339	221343	221343	he	362	” “
221351	221363	221343	221343	he	362	” said Mr. Weevle , altering the construction of his sentence . “
221367	221368	221343	221343	he	362	” “
221384	221385	221374	221374	He	362	” “
221392	221397	221390	221390	Snagsby	362	” says Mr. Guppy , “
221418	221419	221411	221411	I	0	” “
221428	221438	221425	221426	William G.	569	” cried Tony , looking up for an instant . “
221465	221571	221411	221411	I	0	” Mr. Guppy affects to smile , and with the view of changing the conversation , looks with an admiration , real or pretended , round the room at the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty , terminating his survey with the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the mantelshelf , in which she is represented on a terrace , with a pedestal upon the terrace , and a vase upon the pedestal , and her shawl upon the vase , and a prodigious piece of fur upon the shawl , and her arm on the prodigious piece of fur , and a bracelet on her arm . “
221579	221584	221411	221411	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy . “
221591	221592	221593	221593	I	0	” “
221598	221607	221593	221593	I	0	” growls Tony , without changing his position . “
221619	221653	221654	221654	Tony	489	” Finding by this time that his friend is not to be wheedled into a more sociable humour , Mr. Guppy puts about upon the ill - used tack and remonstrates with him . “
221656	221660	221654	221654	Tony	489	” says he , “
221755	221756	221739	221739	I	0	” “
221765	221770	221762	221763	William Guppy	297	” returns Mr. Weevle . “
221777	221783	221771	221771	Sir	9496	” retorts Mr. William Guppy , “
221793	221837	221785	221785	I	0	” Mr. Weevle admits that he has been wrong and begs Mr. William Guppy to think no more about it . Mr. William Guppy , however , having got the advantage , can not quite release it without a little more injured remonstrance . “
221845	221850	221851	221851	you	489	” says that gentleman , “
221983	221999	222000	222001	William Guppy	297	” Tony again entreats that the subject may be no longer pursued , saying emphatically , “
222006	222015	222000	222001	William Guppy	297	” Mr. Guppy acquiesces , with the reply , “
222031	222032	222024	222024	Tony	489	” “
222036	222044	222024	222024	Tony	489	” says Tony , stirring the fire , “
222075	222076	222059	222059	Krook	249	” “
222086	222087	222081	222081	he	249	” “
222138	222139	222130	222130	He	249	” “
222150	222151	222140	222140	He	249	” “
222294	222295	222279	222279	He	249	” “
222305	222306	222297	222297	you	0	” “
222326	222327	222328	222328	Tony	489	” “
222330	222343	222344	222344	he	249	” says Mr. Guppy after considering a little with his legs crossed , “
222353	222354	222351	222351	he	249	” “
222416	222417	222418	222418	Tony	489	” “
222420	222431	222418	222418	Tony	489	” says Mr. Guppy , uncrossing and recrossing his legs , “
222444	222445	222436	222436	he	249	” “
222497	222498	222499	222499	Tony	489	” “
222501	222513	222515	222515	you	489	” says Mr. Guppy , uncrossing and recrossing his legs again , “
222530	222531	222532	222533	A woman	718	” “
222561	222618	222539	222540	a lady’s	5350	” Mr. Guppy has been biting his thumb - nail during this dialogue , generally changing the thumb when he has changed the cross leg . As he is going to do so again , he happens to look at his coat - sleeve . It takes his attention . He stares at it , aghast . “
222643	222644	222539	222540	a lady’s	5350	” “
222649	222650	222539	222540	a lady’s	5350	” “
222653	222658	222539	222540	a lady’s	5350	” returns Mr. Guppy . “
222696	222755	222803	222803	he	5352	” They look at one another , and Tony goes listening to the door , and a little way upstairs , and a little way downstairs . Comes back and says it ’s all right and all quiet , and quotes the remark he lately made to Mr. Snagsby about their cooking chops at the Sol ’s Arms . “
222761	222801	222803	222803	he	5352	” resumes Mr. Guppy , still glancing with remarkable aversion at the coat - sleeve , as they pursue their conversation before the fire , leaning on opposite sides of the table , with their heads very near together , “
222820	222821	222803	222803	he	5352	” “
222829	222838	222827	222827	sir	9496	” answers Tony , faintly adjusting his whiskers . “
222876	222927	222928	222928	You	5358	” The light vivacious tone of fashionable life which is usually assumed by Mr. Weevle sits so ill upon him to - night that he abandons that and his whiskers together , and after looking over his shoulder , appears to yield himself up a prey to the horrors again . “
222967	222979	222980	222980	You	489	” asks Mr. Guppy , anxiously biting his thumb - nail . “
222997	222998	222999	222999	I	0	” “
223006	223007	223008	223008	You	489	” “
223015	223039	223040	223040	I	0	” says Tony once more . Mr. Guppy nods his sagacious head , advances it yet closer , and drops into a whisper . “
223085	223086	223078	223078	you	5358	” “
223118	223122	223089	223089	he	297	” suggests Tony . “
223179	223180	223181	223181	Ye	5363	” “
223185	223193	223181	223181	Ye	5363	” is Mr. Weevle ’s reluctant admission . “
223198	223203	223196	223196	Tony	489	” remonstrates his friend , “
223222	223223	223215	223215	You	489	” “
223236	223242	223234	223234	William	297	” returns the other gravely . “
223249	223270	223246	223246	you	297	” urges Mr. Guppy , raising his voice a little ; but on his friend ’s once more warning him , “
223282	223301	223275	223275	you	297	” he repeats his question without any sound at all , forming with his lips only the words , “
223307	223308	223304	223304	you	297	” “
223331	223332	223326	223329	a pair of conspirators	5365	” “
223335	223340	223326	223329	a pair of conspirators	5365	” says Mr. Guppy . “
223380	223381	223326	223329	a pair of conspirators	5365	” “
223402	223421	223422	223422	Tony	489	” Mr. Guppy casts up his eyes at the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the mantelshelf and replies , “
223477	223478	223470	223471	no fool	5369	” “
223505	223645	223648	223648	Tony	489	” Both sit silent , listening to the metal voices , near and distant , resounding from towers of various heights , in tones more various than their situations . When these at length cease , all seems more mysterious and quiet than before . One disagreeable result of whispering is that it seems to evoke an atmosphere of silence , haunted by the ghosts of sound — strange cracks and tickings , the rustling of garments that have no substance in them , and the tread of dreadful feet that would leave no mark on the sea - sand or the winter snow . So sensitive the two friends happen to be that the air is full of these phantoms , and the two look over their shoulders by one consent to see that the door is shut . “
223650	223668	223648	223648	Tony	489	” says Mr. Guppy , drawing nearer to the fire and biting his unsteady thumb - nail . “
223677	223678	223669	223669	You	489	” “
223709	223710	223702	223702	you	489	” “
223721	223722	223719	223719	Tony	489	” “
223745	223746	223737	223737	yourself	489	” “
223754	223763	223752	223752	Tony	489	” proceeds Mr. Guppy , evading this proposal , “
223773	223774	223767	223768	dead men	5375	” “
223797	223861	223792	223792	they	5375	” Tony answers . The two look at each other again . Mr. Guppy makes a hurried remark to the effect that they may be doing the deceased a service , that he hopes so . There is an oppressive blank until Mr. Weevle , by stirring the fire suddenly , makes Mr. Guppy start as if his heart had been stirred instead . “
223874	223878	223792	223792	they	5375	” says he . “
223898	224001	224006	224006	Tony	489	” He raises the sash , and they both rest on the window - sill , half in and half out of the room . The neighbouring houses are too near to admit of their seeing any sky without craning their necks and looking up , but lights in frowsy windows here and there , and the rolling of distant carriages , and the new expression that there is of the stir of men , they find to be comfortable . Mr. Guppy , noiselessly tapping on the window - sill , resumes his whispering in quite a light - comedy tone . “
224014	224022	224011	224012	old Smallweed	494	” meaning the younger of that name . “
224050	224051	224052	224052	I	0	” “
224055	224059	224052	224052	I	0	” says Tony . “
224067	224068	224060	224060	I	0	” “
224074	224079	224060	224060	I	0	” resumes Mr. Guppy . “
224111	224117	224098	224098	he	249	” Tony shakes his head . “
224259	224260	224255	224255	he	249	” “
224277	224292	224293	224293	He	249	” Mr. Guppy suggests with one eye shut , after a little forensic meditation . “
224334	224335	224337	224337	he	249	” “
224385	224436	224337	224337	he	249	” returns Mr. Weevle . Mr. Guppy sitting on the window - sill , nodding his head and balancing all these possibilities in his mind , continues thoughtfully to tap it , and clasp it , and measure it with his hand , until he hastily draws his hand away . “
224445	224449	224509	224509	you	0	” he says , “
224458	224499	224502	224502	you	0	” A thick , yellow liquor defiles them , which is offensive to the touch and sight and more offensive to the smell . A stagnant , sickening oil with some natural repulsion in it that makes them both shudder . “
224516	224517	224518	224518	I	0	” “
224537	224586	224526	224526	I	0	” cries the lodger . And yet look here — and look here ! When he brings the candle here , from the corner of the window - sill , it slowly drips and creeps away down the bricks , here lies in a little thick nauseous pool . “
224593	224603	224526	224526	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , shutting down the window . “
224616	224692	224609	224609	I	0	” He so washes , and rubs , and scrubs , and smells , and washes , that he has not long restored himself with a glass of brandy and stood silently before the fire when Saint Paul ’s bell strikes twelve and all those other bells strike twelve from their towers of various heights in the dark air , and in their many tones . When all is quiet again , the lodger says , “
224705	224713	224702	224702	I	0	” Mr. Guppy nods and gives him a “
224716	224773	224775	224775	you	0	” on the back , but not with the washed hand , though it is his right hand . He goes downstairs , and Mr. Guppy tries to compose himself before the fire for waiting a long time . But in no more than a minute or two the stairs creak and Tony comes swiftly back . “
224779	224780	224775	224775	you	0	” “
224793	224821	224786	224788	The old man	1223	” He has been so horribly frightened in the short interval that his terror seizes the other , who makes a rush at him and asks loudly , “
224827	224828	224829	224829	I	0	” “
224871	225001	224866	224866	he	1223	” Tony ends this with a groan . Mr. Guppy takes the light . They go down , more dead than alive , and holding one another , push open the door of the back shop . The cat has retreated close to it and stands snarling , not at them , at something on the ground before the fire . There is a very little fire left in the grate , but there is a smouldering , suffocating vapour in the room and a dark , greasy coating on the walls and ceiling . The chairs and table , and the bottle so rarely absent from the table , all stand as usual . On one chair - back hang the old man ’s hairy cap and coat . “
225004	225022	225023	225023	I	0	” whispers the lodger , pointing his friend ’s attention to these objects with a trembling finger . “
225104	225116	225165	225165	he	1223	” Is he hanging somewhere ? They look up . No . “
225119	225123	225165	225165	he	1223	” whispers Tony . “
225182	225183	225177	225177	I	0	” “
225192	225197	225177	225177	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy . “
225202	225203	225200	225200	her	5393	” “
225217	226217	225206	225206	I	0	” They advance slowly , looking at all these things . The cat remains where they found her , still snarling at the something on the ground before the fire and between the two chairs . What is it ? Hold up the light . Here is a small burnt patch of flooring ; here is the tinder from a little bundle of burnt paper , but not so light as usual , seeming to be steeped in something ; and here is — is it the cinder of a small charred and broken log of wood sprinkled with white ashes , or is it coal ? Oh , horror , he IS here ! And this from which we run away , striking out the light and overturning one another into the street , is all that represents him . Help , help , help ! Come into this house for heaven ’s sake ! Plenty will come in , but none can help . The Lord Chancellor of that court , true to his title in his last act , has died the death of all lord chancellors in all courts and of all authorities in all places under all names soever , where false pretences are made , and where injustice is done . Call the death by any name your Highness will , attribute it to whom you will , or say it might have been prevented how you will , it is the same death eternally — inborn , inbred , engendered in the corrupted humours of the vicious body itself , and that only — spontaneous combustion , and none other of all the deaths that can be died . CHAPTER XXXIII Interlopers Now do those two gentlemen not very neat about the cuffs and buttons who attended the last coroner ’s inquest at the Sol ’s Arms reappear in the precincts with surprising swiftness ( being , in fact , breathlessly fetched by the active and intelligent beadle ) , and institute perquisitions through the court , and dive into the Sol ’s parlour , and write with ravenous little pens on tissue - paper . Now do they note down , in the watches of the night , how the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane was yesterday , at about midnight , thrown into a state of the most intense agitation and excitement by the following alarming and horrible discovery . Now do they set forth how it will doubtless be remembered that some time back a painful sensation was created in the public mind by a case of mysterious death from opium occurring in the first floor of the house occupied as a rag , bottle , and general marine store shop , by an eccentric individual of intemperate habits , far advanced in life , named Krook ; and how , by a remarkable coincidence , Krook was examined at the inquest , which it may be recollected was held on that occasion at the Sol ’s Arms , a well - conducted tavern immediately adjoining the premises in question on the west side and licensed to a highly respectable landlord , Mr. James George Bogsby . Now do they show ( in as many words as possible ) how during some hours of yesterday evening a very peculiar smell was observed by the inhabitants of the court , in which the tragical occurrence which forms the subject of that present account transpired ; and which odour was at one time so powerful that Mr. Swills , a comic vocalist professionally engaged by Mr. J. G. Bogsby , has himself stated to our reporter that he mentioned to Miss M. Melvilleson , a lady of some pretensions to musical ability , likewise engaged by Mr. J. G. Bogsby to sing at a series of concerts called Harmonic Assemblies , or Meetings , which it would appear are held at the Sol ’s Arms under Mr. Bogsby ’s direction pursuant to the Act of George the Second , that he ( Mr. Swills ) found his voice seriously affected by the impure state of the atmosphere , his jocose expression at the time being that he was like an empty post - office , for he had n’t a single note in him . How this account of Mr. Swills is entirely corroborated by two intelligent married females residing in the same court and known respectively by the names of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins , both of whom observed the foetid effluvia and regarded them as being emitted from the premises in the occupation of Krook , the unfortunate deceased . All this and a great deal more the two gentlemen who have formed an amicable partnership in the melancholy catastrophe write down on the spot ; and the boy population of the court ( out of bed in a moment ) swarm up the shutters of the Sol ’s Arms parlour , to behold the tops of their heads while they are about it . The whole court , adult as well as boy , is sleepless for that night , and can do nothing but wrap up its many heads , and talk of the ill - fated house , and look at it . Miss Flite has been bravely rescued from her chamber , as if it were in flames , and accommodated with a bed at the Sol ’s Arms . The Sol neither turns off its gas nor shuts its door all night , for any kind of public excitement makes good for the Sol and causes the court to stand in need of comfort . The house has not done so much in the stomachic article of cloves or in brandy - and - water warm since the inquest . The moment the pot - boy heard what had happened , he rolled up his shirt - sleeves tight to his shoulders and said , “
226226	226366	225206	225206	I	0	” In the first outcry , young Piper dashed off for the fire - engines and returned in triumph at a jolting gallop perched up aloft on the Phoenix and holding on to that fabulous creature with all his might in the midst of helmets and torches . One helmet remains behind after careful investigation of all chinks and crannies and slowly paces up and down before the house in company with one of the two policemen who have likewise been left in charge thereof . To this trio everybody in the court possessed of sixpence has an insatiate desire to exhibit hospitality in a liquid form . Mr. Weevle and his friend Mr. Guppy are within the bar at the Sol and are worth anything to the Sol that the bar contains if they will only stay there . “
226373	226378	225206	225206	I	0	” says Mr. Bogsby , “
226384	226397	226399	226399	your	5396	” though he looks something sharply after it , over the counter ; “
226418	226756	226412	226412	you	5396	” Thus entreated , the two gentlemen ( Mr. Weevle especially ) put names to so many things that in course of time they find it difficult to put a name to anything quite distinctly , though they still relate to all new - comers some version of the night they have had of it , and of what they said , and what they thought , and what they saw . Meanwhile , one or other of the policemen often flits about the door , and pushing it open a little way at the full length of his arm , looks in from outer gloom . Not that he has any suspicions , but that he may as well know what they are up to in there . Thus night pursues its leaden course , finding the court still out of bed through the unwonted hours , still treating and being treated , still conducting itself similarly to a court that has had a little money left it unexpectedly . Thus night at length with slow - retreating steps departs , and the lamp - lighter going his rounds , like an executioner to a despotic king , strikes off the little heads of fire that have aspired to lessen the darkness . Thus the day cometh , whether or no . And the day may discern , even with its dim London eye , that the court has been up all night . Over and above the faces that have fallen drowsily on tables and the heels that lie prone on hard floors instead of beds , the brick and mortar physiognomy of the very court itself looks worn and jaded . And now the neighbourhood , waking up and beginning to hear of what has happened , comes streaming in , half dressed , to ask questions ; and the two policemen and the helmet ( who are far less impressible externally than the court ) have enough to do to keep the door . “
226762	226770	226412	226412	you	5396	” says Mr. Snagsby , coming up . “
226777	226778	226774	226774	I	0	” “
226785	226792	226774	226774	I	0	” returns one of the policemen . “
226806	226807	226813	226813	gentlemen	9501	” “
226815	226825	226813	226813	gentlemen	9501	” says Mr. Snagsby , somewhat promptly backed away , “
226848	226849	226841	226846	the young man who lodges here	5400	” “
226852	226857	226841	226846	the young man who lodges here	5400	” returns the policeman . “
226877	226878	226882	226882	I	0	” “
226885	226890	226882	226882	I	0	” says Mr. Snagsby . “
226901	226948	226950	226951	Mr. Guppy	297	” Mr. Snagsby , wholly unable to answer this or any question in his troubled mind , repairs to the Sol ’s Arms and finds Mr. Weevle languishing over tea and toast with a considerable expression on him of exhausted excitement and exhausted tobacco - smoke . “
226954	226959	226950	226951	Mr. Guppy	297	” quoth Mr. Snagsby . “
226979	226994	226995	226997	my little woman	2319	” Mr. Snagsby ’s power of speech deserts him in the formation of the words “
226999	227041	226995	226997	my little woman	2319	” For to see that injured female walk into the Sol ’s Arms at that hour of the morning and stand before the beer - engine , with her eyes fixed upon him like an accusing spirit , strikes him dumb . “
227045	227055	227057	227057	you	9540	” says Mr. Snagsby when his tongue is loosened , “
227078	227079	227057	227057	you	9540	” “
227082	227087	227057	227057	you	9540	” says Mrs. Snagsby . “
227097	227098	227093	227095	these two gentlemen	5409	” “
227101	227149	227093	227095	these two gentlemen	5409	” says Mrs. Snagsby , and in a rigid manner acknowledges their presence , still fixing Mr. Snagsby with her eye . The devoted Mr. Snagsby can not bear this treatment . He takes Mrs. Snagsby by the hand and leads her aside to an adjacent cask . “
227170	227171	227172	227172	I	0	” “
227179	227184	227172	227172	I	0	” says Mrs. Snagsby , “
227193	227205	227189	227189	I	0	” Mr. Snagsby , with his cough of meekness , rejoins , “
227214	227227	227208	227208	you	9540	” and meditates . Then coughs his cough of trouble and says , “
227237	227247	227189	227189	I	0	” still fearfully disconcerted by Mrs. Snagsby ’s eye . “
227251	227260	227189	227189	I	0	” returns Mrs. Snagsby , shaking her head , “
227265	227266	227267	227269	My little woman	2319	” “
227271	227280	227267	227269	My little woman	2319	” urges Mr. Snagsby in a piteous manner , “
227333	227334	227335	227335	I	0	” “
227340	227356	227335	227335	I	0	” returns Mrs. Snagsby . On a hasty review of his unfortunate position , Mr. Snagsby “
227360	227433	227434	227434	My	0	” either . He is not prepared positively to deny that he may have had something to do with it . He has had something — he do n’t know what — to do with so much in this connexion that is mysterious that it is possible he may even be implicated , without knowing it , in the present transaction . He faintly wipes his forehead with his handkerchief and gasps . “
227437	227443	227445	227445	you	2319	” says the unhappy stationer , “
227473	227474	227463	227463	you	2319	” “
227481	227486	227477	227477	YOU	2319	” inquires Mrs. Snagsby . “
227512	227524	227525	227525	I	0	” Mr. Snagsby has made a pause to suppress a groan . “
227542	227543	227547	227547	you	2319	” “
227559	227560	227550	227550	You	2319	” “
227566	227567	227550	227550	You	2319	” “
227573	227589	227568	227568	I	0	” says Mrs. Snagsby after contemplating his increased confusion with a severe and sinister smile , “
227613	227614	227615	227616	My love	9612	” “
227638	227797	227632	227632	I	0	” Mr. Snagsby casts his eye forlornly round the bar , gives Messrs. Weevle and Guppy good morning , assures them of the satisfaction with which he sees them uninjured , and accompanies Mrs. Snagsby from the Sol ’s Arms . Before night his doubt whether he may not be responsible for some inconceivable part in the catastrophe which is the talk of the whole neighbourhood is almost resolved into certainty by Mrs. Snagsby ’s pertinacity in that fixed gaze . His mental sufferings are so great that he entertains wandering ideas of delivering himself up to justice and requiring to be cleared if innocent and punished with the utmost rigour of the law if guilty . Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy , having taken their breakfast , step into Lincoln ’s Inn to take a little walk about the square and clear as many of the dark cobwebs out of their brains as a little walk may . “
227811	227828	227809	227809	Tony	489	” says Mr. Guppy after they have broodingly made out the four sides of the square , “
227854	227855	227858	227858	I	0	” “
227866	227879	227858	227858	I	0	” returns the other , eyeing his companion with a bloodshot eye . “
227929	227952	227953	227953	Tony	489	” This supposititious phenomenon is so very disagreeable to Mr. Guppy that his voice quakes as he says in a moral way , “
227985	227992	227993	227993	William	297	” To which Mr. Weevle returns , “
228018	228025	228006	228006	YOU	489	” To which Mr. Guppy says , “
228030	228037	228006	228006	YOU	489	” To which Mr. Jobling replies , “
228043	228050	228053	228053	I	0	” To which Mr. Guppy retorts , “
228057	228065	228068	228068	you	489	” To which Mr. Jobling retorts again , “
228071	228078	228068	228068	you	489	” To which Mr. Guppy retorts , “
228083	228090	228091	228091	I	0	” To which Mr. Jobling retorts , “
228095	228102	228091	228091	I	0	” To which Mr. Guppy retorts , “
228107	228114	228091	228091	I	0	” To which Mr. Jobling retorts , “
228119	228141	228142	228142	Tony	489	” And both being now in a heated state , they walk on silently for a while to cool down again . “
228144	228150	228142	228142	Tony	489	” says Mr. Guppy then , “
228196	228197	228181	228181	Possessing	578	” “
228204	228213	228181	228181	Possessing	578	” cries Mr. Weevle , cutting him short . “
228222	228253	228216	228216	you	489	” Finding his friend in this morose and material condition , Mr. Guppy only expresses the finer feelings of his soul through the tone of injury in which he recommences , “
228340	228348	228349	228349	mogul	5426	” ( Mr. Guppy was going to say “
228351	228354	228355	228355	gentleman	5427	” but thinks “
228356	228364	228349	228349	mogul	5426	” better suited to the circumstances . ) “
228371	228372	228355	228355	gentleman	5427	” “
228381	228389	228355	228355	gentleman	5427	are”—Mr . Guppy tells them off on his fingers—“what
228420	228421	228397	228397	you	489	” “
228424	228429	228397	228397	you	489	” says Mr. Weevle . “
228436	228437	228438	228438	We	5423	” “
228534	228535	228530	228530	you	489	” “
228538	228543	228544	228544	I	0	” returns Mr. Weevle . “
228548	228549	228544	228544	I	0	” “
228559	228565	228544	228544	I	0	” says the injured Guppy . “
228568	228573	228544	228544	I	0	” returns his friend ; “
228587	228588	228582	228582	I	0	” “
228593	228608	228591	228591	Tony	489	” says Mr. Guppy , taking his arm again and walking him slowly on , “
228638	228639	228621	228621	you	489	” “
228645	228651	228642	228642	you	0	” says Tony , stopping . “
228670	228680	228662	228662	your	0	” repeats Mr. Guppy , walking him on again . “
228688	228704	228662	228662	your	0	” pointing in the direction of the rag and bottle shop . Mr. Guppy nods . “
228723	228731	228718	228718	you	0	” says Mr. Weevle , haggardly staring . “
228740	228741	228733	228733	you	0	” “
228765	228775	228761	228761	I	0	” says Mr. Weevle with a very genuine shudder . “
228853	228867	228851	228851	you	489	” says Mr. Guppy , biting his thumb with the appetite of vexation . “
228883	228889	228894	228894	yourself	489	” cries Mr. Weevle indignantly . “
228896	228897	228894	228894	yourself	489	” “
228904	228912	228900	228900	I	0	” says Mr. Guppy , soothing him . “
228933	228934	228935	228935	You	489	” “
228941	228946	228935	228935	You	489	” rejoins his friend , “
228958	228959	228961	228961	you	489	” “
228969	228974	228961	228961	you	489	” says Mr. Guppy , “
228988	228989	228986	228986	Tony	489	” “
228993	229002	229009	229009	your	489	” returns Tony with a most convincing steadfastness , “
229015	229133	229012	229012	I	0	” While they are so conversing , a hackney - coach drives into the square , on the box of which vehicle a very tall hat makes itself manifest to the public . Inside the coach , and consequently not so manifest to the multitude , though sufficiently so to the two friends , for the coach stops almost at their feet , are the venerable Mr. Smallweed and Mrs. Smallweed , accompanied by their granddaughter Judy . An air of haste and excitement pervades the party , and as the tall hat ( surmounting Mr. Smallweed the younger ) alights , Mr. Smallweed the elder pokes his head out of window and bawls to Mr. Guppy , “
229144	229145	229012	229012	I	0	” “
229164	229174	229175	229175	My	0	” says Mr. Guppy , nodding to his familiar . “
229179	229184	229186	229186	you	5098	” cries Grandfather Smallweed , “
229236	229247	229225	229225	you	5098	” Mr. Guppy looks at his friend , repeating inquiringly , “
229256	229271	229225	229225	you	5098	” And they prepare to bear the venerable burden to the Sol ’s Arms . “
229277	229296	229225	229225	you	5098	” says the patriarch to the coachman with a fierce grin and shaking his incapable fist at him . “
229362	229437	229440	229440	Lord	5457	” It is well that the Sol is not far off , for Mr. Weevle presents an apoplectic appearance before half the distance is accomplished . With no worse aggravation of his symptoms , however , than the utterance of divers croaking sounds expressive of obstructed respiration , he fulfils his share of the porterage and the benevolent old gentleman is deposited by his own desire in the parlour of the Sol ’s Arms . “
229442	229459	229440	229440	Lord	5457	” gasps Mr. Smallweed , looking about him , breathless , from an arm - chair . “
229497	229528	229482	229482	you	0	” This little apostrophe to Mrs. Smallweed is occasioned by a propensity on the part of that unlucky old lady whenever she finds herself on her feet to amble about and “
229530	229631	229482	229482	you	0	” to inanimate objects , accompanying herself with a chattering noise , as in a witch dance . A nervous affection has probably as much to do with these demonstrations as any imbecile intention in the poor old woman , but on the present occasion they are so particularly lively in connexion with the Windsor arm - chair , fellow to that in which Mr. Smallweed is seated , that she only quite desists when her grandchildren have held her down in it , her lord in the meanwhile bestowing upon her , with great volubility , the endearing epithet of “
229638	229646	229482	229482	you	0	” repeated a surprising number of times . “
229651	229661	229482	229482	you	0	” Grandfather Smallweed then proceeds , addressing Mr. Guppy , “
229679	229680	229685	229685	sir	9496	” “
229693	229694	229695	229695	You	5098	” “
229710	229724	229706	229706	THEY	9676	” The two discoverers stare at the Smallweeds , who return the compliment . “
229729	229740	229706	229706	THEY	9676	” whines Grandfather Smallweed , putting out both his hands , “
229762	229763	229757	229758	Mrs. Smallweed	495	” “
229766	229771	229757	229758	Mrs. Smallweed	495	” says Mr. Guppy . “
229870	229888	229865	229865	I	0	” repeats Grandfather Smallweed , hooking the air towards him with all his ten fingers at once , “
229895	229896	229897	229897	I	0	” “
229902	229909	229910	229910	you	477	” says the disconsolate Mr. Guppy , “
229922	229923	229910	229910	you	477	” “
229943	229954	229934	229934	you	477	” returns that old bird with a secretly glistening eye . “
229964	229965	229957	229957	I	0	” “
229984	229995	229975	229975	you	477	” says Judy . Also with a secretly glistening eye . “
230007	230011	229996	229996	He	1223	” observed Small ; “
230026	230027	230022	230022	I	0	” “
230042	230049	230030	230030	he	1223	” the old gentleman strikes in , “
230173	230186	230158	230158	you	5478	” Mrs. Smallweed instantly begins to shake her head and pipe up , “
230216	230217	230219	230219	somebody	851	” “
230226	230244	230219	230219	somebody	851	” exclaims her exasperated husband , looking helplessly about him and finding no missile within his reach . “
230279	230333	230266	230266	You	5478	” Here Mr. Smallweed , wrought up to the highest pitch by his own eloquence , actually throws Judy at her grandmother in default of anything else , by butting that young virgin at the old lady with such force as he can muster and then dropping into his chair in a heap . “
230347	230363	230338	230338	somebody	851	” says the voice from within the faintly struggling bundle into which he has collapsed . “
230419	230450	230788	230790	J. G. B.	580	” As his dutiful grandchildren set him up , panting , and putting him through the usual restorative process of shaking and punching , he still repeats like an echo , “
230461	230754	230380	230381	the police	13015	” Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy look at each other , the former as having relinquished the whole affair , the latter with a discomfited countenance as having entertained some lingering expectations yet . But there is nothing to be done in opposition to the Smallweed interest . Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s clerk comes down from his official pew in the chambers to mention to the police that Mr. Tulkinghorn is answerable for its being all correct about the next of kin and that the papers and effects will be formally taken possession of in due time and course . Mr. Smallweed is at once permitted so far to assert his supremacy as to be carried on a visit of sentiment into the next house and upstairs into Miss Flite ’s deserted room , where he looks like a hideous bird of prey newly added to her aviary . The arrival of this unexpected heir soon taking wind in the court still makes good for the Sol and keeps the court upon its mettle . Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins think it hard upon the young man if there really is no will , and consider that a handsome present ought to be made him out of the estate . Young Piper and young Perkins , as members of that restless juvenile circle which is the terror of the foot - passengers in Chancery Lane , crumble into ashes behind the pump and under the archway all day long , where wild yells and hootings take place over their remains . Little Swills and Miss M. Melvilleson enter into affable conversation with their patrons , feeling that these unusual occurrences level the barriers between professionals and non - professionals . Mr. Bogsby puts up “
230772	230787	230380	230381	the police	13015	” as the great Harmonic feature of the week and announces in the bill that “
230837	230902	230903	230911	a six - footer , ” the general solicitude	14189	” There is one point connected with the deceased upon which the court is particularly anxious , namely , that the fiction of a full - sized coffin should be preserved , though there is so little to put in it . Upon the undertaker ’s stating in the Sol ’s bar in the course of the day that he has received orders to construct “
230908	231445	230903	230911	a six - footer , ” the general solicitude	14189	” the general solicitude is much relieved , and it is considered that Mr. Smallweed ’s conduct does him great honour . Out of the court , and a long way out of it , there is considerable excitement too , for men of science and philosophy come to look , and carriages set down doctors at the corner who arrive with the same intent , and there is more learned talk about inflammable gases and phosphuretted hydrogen than the court has ever imagined . Some of these authorities ( of course the wisest ) hold with indignation that the deceased had no business to die in the alleged manner ; and being reminded by other authorities of a certain inquiry into the evidence for such deaths reprinted in the sixth volume of the Philosophical Transactions ; and also of a book not quite unknown on English medical jurisprudence ; and likewise of the Italian case of the Countess Cornelia Baudi as set forth in detail by one Bianchini , prebendary of Verona , who wrote a scholarly work or so and was occasionally heard of in his time as having gleams of reason in him ; and also of the testimony of Messrs. Fodere and Mere , two pestilent Frenchmen who WOULD investigate the subject ; and further , of the corroborative testimony of Monsieur Le Cat , a rather celebrated French surgeon once upon a time , who had the unpoliteness to live in a house where such a case occurred and even to write an account of it — still they regard the late Mr. Krook ’s obstinacy in going out of the world by any such by - way as wholly unjustifiable and personally offensive . The less the court understands of all this , the more the court likes it , and the greater enjoyment it has in the stock in trade of the Sol ’s Arms . Then there comes the artist of a picture newspaper , with a foreground and figures ready drawn for anything from a wreck on the Cornish coast to a review in Hyde Park or a meeting in Manchester , and in Mrs. Perkins ’ own room , memorable evermore , he then and there throws in upon the block Mr. Krook ’s house , as large as life ; in fact , considerably larger , making a very temple of it . Similarly , being permitted to look in at the door of the fatal chamber , he depicts that apartment as three - quarters of a mile long by fifty yards high , at which the court is particularly charmed . All this time the two gentlemen before mentioned pop in and out of every house and assist at the philosophical disputations — go everywhere and listen to everybody — and yet are always diving into the Sol ’s parlour and writing with the ravenous little pens on the tissue - paper . At last come the coroner and his inquiry , like as before , except that the coroner cherishes this case as being out of the common way and tells the gentlemen of the jury , in his private capacity , that “
231480	231711	231820	231820	your	5502	” After which the six - footer comes into action and is much admired . In all these proceedings Mr. Guppy has so slight a part , except when he gives his evidence , that he is moved on like a private individual and can only haunt the secret house on the outside , where he has the mortification of seeing Mr. Smallweed padlocking the door , and of bitterly knowing himself to be shut out . But before these proceedings draw to a close , that is to say , on the night next after the catastrophe , Mr. Guppy has a thing to say that must be said to Lady Dedlock . For which reason , with a sinking heart and with that hang - dog sense of guilt upon him which dread and watching enfolded in the Sol ’s Arms have produced , the young man of the name of Guppy presents himself at the town mansion at about seven o’clock in the evening and requests to see her ladyship . Mercury replies that she is going out to dinner ; do n’t he see the carriage at the door ? Yes , he does see the carriage at the door ; but he wants to see my Lady too . Mercury is disposed , as he will presently declare to a fellow - gentleman in waiting , “
231718	231815	231816	231816	I	0	” ; but his instructions are positive . Therefore he sulkily supposes that the young man must come up into the library . There he leaves the young man in a large room , not over - light , while he makes report of him . Mr. Guppy looks into the shade in all directions , discovering everywhere a certain charred and whitened little heap of coal or wood . Presently he hears a rustling . Is it — ? No , it ’s no ghost , but fair flesh and blood , most brilliantly dressed . “
231825	231833	231816	231816	I	0	” Mr. Guppy stammers , very downcast . “
231840	231841	231842	231842	I	0	” “
231853	231869	231842	231842	I	0	” She takes a chair , looking straight at him as on the last occasion . “
231880	231881	231874	231875	Your ladyship	2537	” “
231887	231897	231874	231875	Your ladyship	2537	” There is not much affability in her tone . “
231941	231942	231928	231928	I	0	” “
231951	231952	231944	231944	you	0	” “
231961	232077	231944	231944	you	0	” Mr. Guppy besides being depressed , disappointed , and uneasy , is put at a further disadvantage by the splendour and beauty of her appearance . She knows its influence perfectly , has studied it too well to miss a grain of its effect on any one . As she looks at him so steadily and coldly , he not only feels conscious that he has no guide in the least perception of what is really the complexion of her thoughts , but also that he is being every moment , as it were , removed further and further from her . She will not speak , it is plain . So he must . “
232084	232094	232081	232082	your ladyship	2537	” says Mr. Guppy like a meanly penitent thief , “
232115	232126	232081	232082	your ladyship	2537	” He stops . Lady Dedlock calmly finishes the sentence . “
232136	232153	232154	232154	I	0	” Mr. Guppy would say no if he could — as he is unable to hide . “
232161	232219	232154	232154	I	0	” If he could see the least sparkle of relief in her face now ? No , he could see no such thing , even if that brave outside did not utterly put him away , and he were not looking beyond it and about it . He falters an awkward excuse or two for his failure . “
232228	232254	232223	232223	you	2537	” inquires Lady Dedlock , having heard him out — or as nearly out as he can stumble . Mr. Guppy thinks that ’s all . “
232281	232302	232255	232255	You	2537	” Mr. Guppy is quite sure . And indeed he has no such wish at present , by any means . “
232318	232443	232444	232444	I	0	” And she rings for Mercury to show the young man of the name of Guppy out . But in that house , in that same moment , there happens to be an old man of the name of Tulkinghorn . And that old man , coming with his quiet footstep to the library , has his hand at that moment on the handle of the door — comes in — and comes face to face with the young man as he is leaving the room . One glance between the old man and the lady , and for an instant the blind that is always down flies up . Suspicion , eager and sharp , looks out . Another instant , close again . “
232485	232486	232480	232480	I	0	” “
232489	232496	232480	232480	I	0	” She negligently calls him back . “
232521	232545	232510	232510	I	0	” The disconcerted young man bows , as he goes out , and cringingly hopes that Mr. Tulkinghorn of the Fields is well . “
232550	232576	232510	232510	I	0	” says the lawyer , looking at him from under his bent brows , though he has no need to look again — not he . “
232585	232586	232587	232587	Kenge	283	” “
232601	232602	232597	232597	Guppy	297	” “
232620	232621	232627	232627	sir	9496	” “
232645	232646	232629	232629	You	9496	” “
232653	232713	232648	232648	you	9496	” Mr. Guppy sneaks away . Mr. Tulkinghorn , such a foil in his old - fashioned rusty black to Lady Dedlock ’s brightness , hands her down the staircase to her carriage . He returns rubbing his chin , and rubs it a good deal in the course of the evening . CHAPTER XXXIV A Turn of the Screw “
232718	232723	232648	232648	you	9496	” says Mr. George , “
232744	232868	233011	233011	Phil	509	” An open letter is the subject of the trooper ’s speculations , and it seems to perplex him mightily . He looks at it at arm ’s length , brings it close to him , holds it in his right hand , holds it in his left hand , reads it with his head on this side , with his head on that side , contracts his eyebrows , elevates them , still can not satisfy himself . He smooths it out upon the table with his heavy palm , and thoughtfully walking up and down the gallery , makes a halt before it every now and then to come upon it with a fresh eye . Even that wo n’t do . “
232872	232878	233011	233011	Phil	509	” Mr. George still muses , “
232884	232939	232940	232940	Phil	509	” Phil Squod , with the aid of a brush and paint - pot , is employed in the distance whitening the targets , softly whistling in quick - march time and in drum - and - fife manner that he must and will go back again to the girl he left behind him . “
232942	233008	233011	233011	Phil	509	” The trooper beckons as he calls him . Phil approaches in his usual way , sidling off at first as if he were going anywhere else and then bearing down upon his commander like a bayonet - charge . Certain splashes of white show in high relief upon his dirty face , and he scrapes his one eyebrow with the handle of the brush . “
233017	233018	233019	233019	Steady	5519	” “
233025	233026	233019	233019	Steady	5519	” “
233122	233123	233115	233115	you	509	” “
233128	233129	233126	233126	guv’ner	511	” “
233132	233133	233134	233134	I	0	” “
233137	233157	233134	233134	I	0	” replies Phil after pensively tracing out a cross - wrinkle in his forehead with the brush - handle , “
233170	233171	233172	233172	Lookye	587	” “
233176	233186	233174	233174	Phil	509	” says the trooper , sitting on the table . “
233214	233251	233195	233195	I	0	” Phil intimates by sidling back a pace or two , with a very unaccountable wrench of his wry face , that he does not regard the transaction as being made more promising by this incident . “
233258	233274	233256	233256	Phil	509	” says the trooper , staying his premature conclusions with a wave of his hand . “
233308	233309	233310	233310	I	0	” “
233325	233326	233327	233327	You	509	” “
233341	233342	233332	233332	I	0	” “
233355	233356	233343	233344	Joshua Smallweed	586	” “
233360	233361	233343	233344	Joshua Smallweed	586	” “
233364	233371	233372	233372	he	586	” says Phil with exceeding gravity , “
233404	233478	233380	233380	he	586	” Having thus expressively uttered his sentiments , Mr. Squod , after waiting a little to ascertain if any further remark be expected of him , gets back by his usual series of movements to the target he has in hand and vigorously signifies through his former musical medium that he must and he will return to that ideal young lady . George , having folded the letter , walks in that direction . “
233486	233495	233523	233523	guv’ner	511	” says Phil , looking cunningly at him , “
233500	233501	233523	233523	guv’ner	511	” “
233514	233520	233511	233511	I	0	” Phil shakes his head . “
233538	233550	233523	233523	guv’ner	511	” says Phil with a highly artistic turn of his brush ; “
233560	233561	233552	233552	I	0	” “
233564	233568	233523	233523	guv’ner	511	” Phil nods . “
233608	233624	233628	233628	you	0	” says the trooper , eyeing him in his large way with no small indignation ; “
233633	233736	233631	233631	Phil	509	” Phil , on one knee at the target , is in course of protesting earnestly , though not without many allegorical scoops of his brush and smoothings of the white surface round the rim with his thumb , that he had forgotten the Bagnet responsibility and would not so much as injure a hair of the head of any member of that worthy family when steps are audible in the long passage without , and a cheerful voice is heard to wonder whether George is at home . Phil , with a look at his master , hobbles up , saying , “
233749	234097	233746	233746	he	5525	” and the old girl herself , accompanied by Mr. Bagnet , appears . The old girl never appears in walking trim , in any season of the year , without a grey cloth cloak , coarse and much worn but very clean , which is , undoubtedly , the identical garment rendered so interesting to Mr. Bagnet by having made its way home to Europe from another quarter of the globe in company with Mrs. Bagnet and an umbrella . The latter faithful appendage is also invariably a part of the old girl ’s presence out of doors . It is of no colour known in this life and has a corrugated wooden crook for a handle , with a metallic object let into its prow , or beak , resembling a little model of a fanlight over a street door or one of the oval glasses out of a pair of spectacles , which ornamental object has not that tenacious capacity of sticking to its post that might be desired in an article long associated with the British army . The old girl ’s umbrella is of a flabby habit of waist and seems to be in need of stays — an appearance that is possibly referable to its having served through a series of years at home as a cupboard and on journeys as a carpet bag . She never puts it up , having the greatest reliance on her well - proved cloak with its capacious hood , but generally uses the instrument as a wand with which to point out joints of meat or bunches of greens in marketing or to arrest the attention of tradesmen by a friendly poke . Without her market - basket , which is a sort of wicker well with two flapping lids , she never stirs abroad . Attended by these her trusty companions , therefore , her honest sunburnt face looking cheerily out of a rough straw bonnet , Mrs. Bagnet now arrives , fresh - coloured and bright , in George ’s Shooting Gallery . “
234105	234109	234100	234100	George	500	” says she , “
234120	234227	234113	234113	YOU	500	” Giving him a friendly shake of the hand , Mrs. Bagnet draws a long breath after her walk and sits down to enjoy a rest . Having a faculty , matured on the tops of baggage - waggons and in other such positions , of resting easily anywhere , she perches on a rough bench , unties her bonnet - strings , pushes back her bonnet , crosses her arms , and looks perfectly comfortable . Mr. Bagnet in the meantime has shaken hands with his old comrade and with Phil , on whom Mrs. Bagnet likewise bestows a good - humoured nod and smile . “
234232	234238	234230	234230	George	500	” said Mrs. Bagnet briskly , “
234245	234288	234230	234230	George	500	myself”—she often speaks of her husband by this appellation , on account , as it is supposed , of Lignum Vitae having been his old regimental nickname when they first became acquainted , in compliment to the extreme hardness and toughness of his physiognomy—“just
234325	234326	234327	234327	I	0	” “
234335	234341	234327	234327	I	0	” observes the trooper reluctantly . “
234413	234424	234411	234411	George	500	” asks Mrs. Bagnet , stopping in her cheerful talk . “
234431	234432	234425	234425	You	500	” “
234439	234444	234433	234433	I	0	” returns the trooper ; “
234456	234466	234467	234467	George	500	” Her bright quick eye catches the truth directly . “
234469	234475	234467	234467	George	500	” holding up her forefinger . “
234504	234515	234516	234516	George	500	” The trooper looks at her with a troubled visage . “
234518	234540	234516	234516	George	500	” says Mrs. Bagnet , using both her arms for emphasis and occasionally bringing down her open hands upon her knees . “
234617	234664	234665	234665	George	500	” Mr. Bagnet , otherwise as immovable as a pump or a lamp - post , puts his large right hand on the top of his bald head as if to defend it from a shower - bath and looks with great uneasiness at Mrs. Bagnet . “
234667	234673	234665	234665	George	500	” says that old girl , “
234786	234804	234784	234784	George	500	” Mrs. Bagnet gathers up her cloak to wipe her eyes on in a very genuine manner , “
234811	234855	234856	234856	Mat	542	” Mrs. Bagnet ceasing , Mr. Bagnet removes his hand from his head as if the shower - bath were over and looks disconsolately at Mr. George , who has turned quite white and looks distressfully at the grey cloak and straw bonnet . “
234858	234876	234856	234856	Mat	542	” says the trooper in a subdued voice , addressing him but still looking at his wife , “
234911	234914	234915	234915	I	0	letter”—which he reads aloud—“but
235026	235027	235028	235029	Old girl	4727	” “
235031	235040	235042	235042	you	4727	” murmurs Mr. Bagnet after a short silence , “
235048	235049	235042	235042	you	4727	” “
235058	235069	235055	235055	he	5545	” Mrs. Bagnet answers , half laughing and half crying , “
235089	235090	235091	235093	The old girl	4707	” “
235095	235100	235091	235093	The old girl	4707	” says Mr. Bagnet , “
235110	235111	235108	235108	you	4707	” “
235126	235131	235114	235114	she	4707	” returns the trooper . “
235234	235248	235230	235230	I	0	” says the trooper , giving himself a disparaging blow in the chest , “
235268	235269	235270	235271	Old girl	4727	” “
235273	235278	235270	235271	Old girl	4727	” murmurs Mr. Bagnet , “
235287	235288	235289	235289	George	500	” “
235291	235297	235289	235289	George	500	” says the old girl , “
235321	235322	235298	235298	you	500	” “
235329	235339	235327	235327	me	0	” observes the penitent trooper , shaking his head . “
235346	235347	235341	235341	me	0	” “
235354	235359	235350	235352	The old girl	4707	” says Mr. Bagnet , “
235375	235376	235350	235352	The old girl	4707	” “
235482	235516	235517	235517	I	0	” Mrs. Bagnet , giving him one of her honest hands and giving her husband the other , Mr. George gives each of them one of his and holds them while he speaks . “
235661	235718	235719	235719	George	500	” With these concluding words , Mr. George gives a shake to each of the hands he holds , and relinquishing them , backs a pace or two in a broad - chested , upright attitude , as if he had made a final confession and were immediately going to be shot with all military honours . “
235725	235735	235736	235737	Old girl	4727	” says Mr. Bagnet , glancing at his wife . “
235742	235830	235736	235737	Old girl	4727	” Mr. Bagnet , being in this singular manner heard out , has merely to observe that the letter must be attended to without any delay , that it is advisable that George and he should immediately wait on Mr. Smallweed in person , and that the primary object is to save and hold harmless Mr. Bagnet , who had none of the money . Mr. George , entirely assenting , puts on his hat and prepares to march with Mr. Bagnet to the enemy ’s camp . “
235843	235854	235841	235841	George	500	” says Mrs. Bagnet , patting him on the shoulder . “
235874	236044	235867	235867	you	500	” The trooper returns that this is kindly said and that he WILL bring Lignum through it somehow . Upon which Mrs. Bagnet , with her cloak , basket , and umbrella , goes home , bright - eyed again , to the rest of her family , and the comrades sally forth on the hopeful errand of mollifying Mr. Smallweed . Whether there are two people in England less likely to come satisfactorily out of any negotiation with Mr. Smallweed than Mr. George and Mr. Matthew Bagnet may be very reasonably questioned . Also , notwithstanding their martial appearance , broad square shoulders , and heavy tread , whether there are within the same limits two more simple and unaccustomed children in all the Smallweedy affairs of life . As they proceed with great gravity through the streets towards the region of Mount Pleasant , Mr. Bagnet , observing his companion to be thoughtful , considers it a friendly part to refer to Mrs. Bagnet ’s late sally . “
236080	236081	236074	236074	she	4707	” “
236089	236090	236091	236091	George	500	” “
236093	236103	236104	236106	the old girl	4707	” says Mr. Bagnet , looking straight before him , “
236133	236134	236135	236135	She	4707	” “
236143	236148	236138	236138	her	4707	” says the trooper . “
236152	236157	236158	236158	I	0	” says Mr. Bagnet . “
236217	236218	236212	236212	she	4707	” “
236225	236226	236219	236219	You	0	” “
236259	236264	236254	236254	She	4707	” says Mr. Bagnet , “
236319	236320	236324	236324	her	4707	” “
236328	236333	236326	236326	Mat	542	” returns the trooper , “
236343	236344	236334	236334	I	0	” “
236349	236368	236334	236334	I	0	” says Mr. Bagnet with the warmest enthusiasm , though without relaxing the rigidity of a single muscle . “
236409	236544	236545	236545	My	0	” These encomiums bring them to Mount Pleasant and to Grandfather Smallweed ’s house . The door is opened by the perennial Judy , who , having surveyed them from top to toe with no particular favour , but indeed with a malignant sneer , leaves them standing there while she consults the oracle as to their admission . The oracle may be inferred to give consent from the circumstance of her returning with the words on her honey lips that they can come in if they want to it . Thus privileged , they come in and find Mr. Smallweed with his feet in the drawer of his chair as if it were a paper foot - bath and Mrs. Smallweed obscured with the cushion like a bird that is not to sing . “
236549	236564	236545	236545	My	0	” says Grandfather Smallweed with those two lean affectionate arms of his stretched forth . “
236582	236583	236575	236576	our friend	9918	” “
236587	236600	236602	236603	Matthew Bagnet	542	” returns George , not able to be very conciliatory at first , “
236618	236619	236602	236603	Matthew Bagnet	542	” “
236627	236638	236622	236623	Mr. Bagnet	542	” The old man looks at him under his hand . “
236658	236701	236702	236702	Judy	493	” No chairs being offered , Mr. George brings one forward for Bagnet and one for himself . They sit down , Mr. Bagnet as if he had no power of bending himself , except at the hips , for that purpose . “
236704	236709	236702	236702	Judy	493	” says Mr. Smallweed , “
236714	236715	236702	236702	Judy	493	” “
236723	236728	236718	236718	I	0	” Mr. George interposes , “
236757	236758	236746	236746	I	0	” “
236763	236769	236770	236770	Judy	493	” returns the old man . “
236776	236777	236770	236770	Judy	493	” “
236785	236789	236782	236783	Mr. Smallweed	475	” proceeds George , “
236820	236821	236810	236811	your friend	2692	” “
236827	236832	236810	236811	your friend	2692	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
236838	236839	236842	236842	he	2692	” “
236875	236890	236867	236867	I	0	” Grandfather Smallweed smiles in a very ugly way in recognition of the letter . “
236896	236901	236902	236902	Judy	493	” asks Mr. George . “
236904	236910	236902	236902	Judy	493	” says the old man . “
236934	236935	236923	236923	you	493	” “
236950	236986	236947	236948	Mr. Smallweed	475	” urges the trooper , constraining himself to speak as smoothly and confidentially as he can , holding the open letter in one hand and resting the broad knuckles of the other on his thigh , “
237084	237085	237086	237086	I	0	” “
237094	237101	237086	237086	I	0	” says the old man quietly . “

237134	237139	237129	237129	you	542	” returns Grandfather Smallweed . “

237151	237160	237141	237141	I	0	” says the trooper , swallowing his fire . “
237165	237173	237161	237161	I	0	” Mr. Smallweed replies with excellent temper , “
237182	237186	237236	237236	I	0	” And adds , “
237205	237231	237193	237194	Mr. Bagnet	542	” The unfortunate George makes a great effort to arrange the affair comfortably and to propitiate Mr. Smallweed by taking him upon his own terms . “
237321	237339	237318	237319	Mr. Smallweed	475	” says the trooper , gaining confidence as he proceeds in his soldierly mode of doing business , “
237374	237375	237361	237361	I	0	” “
237394	237411	237391	237392	Mr. George	500	” ( There is an ogreish kind of jocularity in Grandfather Smallweed to - day . ) “
237441	237442	237417	237417	you	542	” “
237447	237481	237417	237417	you	542	” echoes Grandfather Smallweed . In such a very hard manner and with eyes so particularly green that Mr. Bagnet ’s natural gravity is much deepened by the contemplation of that venerable man . “
237484	237490	237491	237491	I	0	” says the sanguine George . “
237571	237583	237560	237560	you	542	” Here some shrill spectre cries out in a mocking manner , “
237591	237639	237560	237560	you	542	” Unless , indeed , it be the sportive Judy , who is found to be silent when the startled visitors look round , but whose chin has received a recent toss , expressive of derision and contempt . Mr. Bagnet ’s gravity becomes yet more profound . “
237648	237666	237668	237668	you	542	George”—old Smallweed , who all this time has had the pipe in his hand , is the speaker now—“I
237678	237679	237668	237668	you	542	” “
237687	237698	237684	237684	I	0	” returns the trooper in his off - hand way , “
237716	237744	237700	237700	I	0	” Mr. Smallweed , purposely balking himself in an aim at the trooper ’s head , throws the pipe on the ground and breaks it to pieces . “
237775	237797	237765	237765	I	0	” The two friends rise and look at one another . Mr. Bagnet ’s gravity has now attained its profoundest point . “
237803	237809	237810	237810	I	0	” repeats the old man . “
237895	237991	237892	237892	’em	5604	” He vociferates this so loudly that Mr. Bagnet , laying his hands on the shoulders of his comrade before the latter can recover from his amazement , gets him on the outside of the street door , which is instantly slammed by the triumphant Judy . Utterly confounded , Mr. George awhile stands looking at the knocker . Mr. Bagnet , in a perfect abyss of gravity , walks up and down before the little parlour window like a sentry and looks in every time he passes , apparently revolving something in his mind . “
237996	238006	237994	237994	Mat	5605	” says Mr. George when he has recovered himself , “
238023	238049	238017	238017	you	5605	” Mr. Bagnet , stopping to take a farewell look into the parlour , replies with one shake of his head directed at the interior , “
238063	238288	238058	238058	I’d	0	” Having so discharged himself of the subject of his cogitations , he falls into step and marches off with the trooper , shoulder to shoulder . When they present themselves in Lincoln ’s Inn Fields , Mr. Tulkinghorn is engaged and not to be seen . He is not at all willing to see them , for when they have waited a full hour , and the clerk , on his bell being rung , takes the opportunity of mentioning as much , he brings forth no more encouraging message than that Mr. Tulkinghorn has nothing to say to them and they had better not wait . They do wait , however , with the perseverance of military tactics , and at last the bell rings again and the client in possession comes out of Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s room . The client is a handsome old lady , no other than Mrs. Rouncewell , housekeeper at Chesney Wold . She comes out of the sanctuary with a fair old - fashioned curtsy and softly shuts the door . She is treated with some distinction there , for the clerk steps out of his pew to show her through the outer office and to let her out . The old lady is thanking him for his attention when she observes the comrades in waiting . “
238304	238339	238342	238342	ma’am	9572	” The clerk referring the question to them with his eye , and Mr. George not turning round from the almanac over the fire - place . Mr. Bagnet takes upon himself to reply , “
238346	238347	238348	238348	I	0	” “
238445	238446	238429	238429	I	0	” “
238453	238530	238531	238531	George	500	” returns Mr. Bagnet with right good will . There is something very touching in the earnestness of the old lady ’s voice and in the tremble that goes through her quaint old figure . But Mr. George is so occupied with the almanac over the fire - place ( calculating the coming months by it perhaps ) that he does not look round until she has gone away and the door is closed upon her . “
238533	238548	238531	238531	George	500	” Mr. Bagnet gruffly whispers when he does turn from the almanac at last . “
238576	238602	238573	238573	my	0	” The clerk having now again gone in to say that they are still there and Mr. Tulkinghorn being heard to return with some irascibility , “
238609	238628	238573	238573	my	0	” they pass into the great room with the painted ceiling and find him standing before the fire . “
238659	238706	238651	238651	I	0	” Sergeant replies — dashed within the last few minutes as to his usual manner of speech , and even as to his usual carriage — that he has received this letter , has been to Mr. Smallweed about it , and has been referred there . “
238715	238720	238707	238707	I	0	” rejoins Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
238751	238766	238737	238737	You	3860	” Sergeant is sorry to say that he is not prepared with the money . “
238789	238807	238771	238773	the other man	5633	” Sergeant is sorry to add that the other man is not prepared with the money either . “
238860	238883	238887	238887	sergeant	4620	” The lawyer sits down in his easy - chair and stirs the fire . Mr. George hopes he will have the goodness to—“I
238959	238960	238952	238952	Melchisedech	591	” “
238971	238976	238961	238961	I	0	” says Mr. George , “
239013	239032	239003	239003	you	3860	” Mr. Tulkinghorn rises with his hands in his pockets and walks into one of the window recesses . “
239042	239084	239087	239087	sir	9496	” In the midst of his perfect assumption of indifference , he directs a sharp look at the trooper , taking care to stand with his own back to the light and to have the other with his face towards it . “
239089	239094	239087	239087	sir	9496	” says Mr. George , “
239147	239148	239149	239150	My friend	9883	” “
239182	239183	239188	239188	sir	9496	” “
239243	239244	239246	239246	you	9496	” “
239251	239252	239246	239246	you	9496	” “
239261	239262	239263	239263	Sergeant	4620	” “
239265	239288	239291	239291	your	4620	” the lawyer proceeds in his dry passionless manner , far more hopeless in the dealing with than any amount of vehemence , “
239446	239462	239443	239443	you	4620	” The trooper puts his hand into his breast and answers with a long breath , “
239470	239567	239443	239443	you	4620	” So Mr. Tulkinghorn , putting on his spectacles , sits down and writes the undertaking , which he slowly reads and explains to Bagnet , who has all this time been staring at the ceiling and who puts his hand on his bald head again , under this new verbal shower - bath , and seems exceedingly in need of the old girl through whom to express his sentiments . The trooper then takes from his breast - pocket a folded paper , which he lays with an unwilling hand at the lawyer ’s elbow . “
239586	239667	239668	239668	You	9496	” Look at a millstone , Mr. George , for some change in its expression , and you will find it quite as soon as in the face of Mr. Tulkinghorn when he opens and reads the letter ! He refolds it and lays it in his desk with a countenance as unperturbable as death . Nor has he anything more to say or do but to nod once in the same frigid and discourteous manner and to say briefly , “
239679	239953	239954	239955	Old girl	4727	” Being shown out , they repair to Mr. Bagnet ’s residence to dine . Boiled beef and greens constitute the day ’s variety on the former repast of boiled pork and greens , and Mrs. Bagnet serves out the meal in the same way and seasons it with the best of temper , being that rare sort of old girl that she receives Good to her arms without a hint that it might be Better and catches light from any little spot of darkness near her . The spot on this occasion is the darkened brow of Mr. George ; he is unusually thoughtful and depressed . At first Mrs. Bagnet trusts to the combined endearments of Quebec and Malta to restore him , but finding those young ladies sensible that their existing Bluffy is not the Bluffy of their usual frolicsome acquaintance , she winks off the light infantry and leaves him to deploy at leisure on the open ground of the domestic hearth . But he does not . He remains in close order , clouded and depressed . During the lengthy cleaning up and pattening process , when he and Mr. Bagnet are supplied with their pipes , he is no better than he was at dinner . He forgets to smoke , looks at the fire and ponders , lets his pipe out , fills the breast of Mr. Bagnet with perturbation and dismay by showing that he has no enjoyment of tobacco . Therefore when Mrs. Bagnet at last appears , rosy from the invigorating pail , and sits down to her work , Mr. Bagnet growls , “
239957	239971	239954	239955	Old girl	4727	” and winks monitions to her to find out what ’s the matter . “
239976	239986	239974	239974	George	500	” says Mrs. Bagnet , quietly threading her needle . “
239992	239993	239995	239995	I	0	” “
240010	240011	240012	240012	He	500	” “
240022	240027	240012	240012	He	500	” cries little Malta . “
240039	240043	240037	240037	mother	9526	” adds Quebec . “
240058	240068	240054	240054	Bluffy	547	” returns the trooper , kissing the young damsels . “
240074	240079	240037	240037	mother	9526	” with a sigh , “
240093	240094	240095	240095	George	500	” “
240097	240105	240095	240095	George	500	” says Mrs. Bagnet , working busily , “
240157	240158	240149	240149	I	0	” “
240166	240171	240149	240149	I	0	” returns the trooper . “
240178	240179	240149	240149	I	0	” “
240221	240222	240212	240212	you	500	” “
240228	240232	240212	240212	you	500	” says George . “
240241	240312	240212	240212	you	500	” In giving Mrs. Bagnet ’s hand , with her work in it , a friendly shake — for she took her seat beside him — the trooper ’s attention is attracted to her face . After looking at it for a little while as she plies her needle , he looks to young Woolwich , sitting on his stool in the corner , and beckons that fifer to him . “
240319	240334	240212	240212	you	500	” says George , very gently smoothing the mother ’s hair with his hand , “
240387	240409	240415	240416	my boy	9947	” Mr. Bagnet ’s face expresses , so far as in its wooden material lies , the highest approbation and acquiescence . “
240418	240423	240415	240416	my boy	9947	” pursues the trooper , “
240522	240993	240518	240518	you	9947	” Mr. George concludes by rising from his chair , seating the boy beside his mother in it , and saying , with something of a hurry about him , that he ’ll smoke his pipe in the street a bit . CHAPTER XXXV Esther ’s Narrative I lay ill through several weeks , and the usual tenor of my life became like an old remembrance . But this was not the effect of time so much as of the change in all my habits made by the helplessness and inaction of a sick - room . Before I had been confined to it many days , everything else seemed to have retired into a remote distance where there was little or no separation between the various stages of my life which had been really divided by years . In falling ill , I seemed to have crossed a dark lake and to have left all my experiences , mingled together by the great distance , on the healthy shore . My housekeeping duties , though at first it caused me great anxiety to think that they were unperformed , were soon as far off as the oldest of the old duties at Greenleaf or the summer afternoons when I went home from school with my portfolio under my arm , and my childish shadow at my side , to my godmother ’s house . I had never known before how short life really was and into how small a space the mind could put it . While I was very ill , the way in which these divisions of time became confused with one another distressed my mind exceedingly . At once a child , an elder girl , and the little woman I had been so happy as , I was not only oppressed by cares and difficulties adapted to each station , but by the great perplexity of endlessly trying to reconcile them . I suppose that few who have not been in such a condition can quite understand what I mean or what painful unrest arose from this source . For the same reason I am almost afraid to hint at that time in my disorder — it seemed one long night , but I believe there were both nights and days in it — when I laboured up colossal staircases , ever striving to reach the top , and ever turned , as I have seen a worm in a garden path , by some obstruction , and labouring again . I knew perfectly at intervals , and I think vaguely at most times , that I was in my bed ; and I talked with Charley , and felt her touch , and knew her very well ; yet I would find myself complaining , “
241020	241337	241017	241017	I	0	” and labouring on again . Dare I hint at that worse time when , strung together somewhere in great black space , there was a flaming necklace , or ring , or starry circle of some kind , of which I was one of the beads ! And when my only prayer was to be taken off from the rest and when it was such inexplicable agony and misery to be a part of the dreadful thing ? Perhaps the less I say of these sick experiences , the less tedious and the more intelligible I shall be . I do not recall them to make others unhappy or because I am now the least unhappy in remembering them . It may be that if we knew more of such strange afflictions we might be the better able to alleviate their intensity . The repose that succeeded , the long delicious sleep , the blissful rest , when in my weakness I was too calm to have any care for myself and could have heard ( or so I think now ) that I was dying , with no other emotion than with a pitying love for those I left behind — this state can be perhaps more widely understood . I was in this state when I first shrunk from the light as it twinkled on me once more , and knew with a boundless joy for which no words are rapturous enough that I should see again . I had heard my Ada crying at the door , day and night ; I had heard her calling to me that I was cruel and did not love her ; I had heard her praying and imploring to be let in to nurse and comfort me and to leave my bedside no more ; but I had only said , when I could speak , “
241346	241714	241017	241017	I	0	” and I had over and over again reminded Charley that she was to keep my darling from the room whether I lived or died . Charley had been true to me in that time of need , and with her little hand and her great heart had kept the door fast . But now , my sight strengthening and the glorious light coming every day more fully and brightly on me , I could read the letters that my dear wrote to me every morning and evening and could put them to my lips and lay my cheek upon them with no fear of hurting her . I could see my little maid , so tender and so careful , going about the two rooms setting everything in order and speaking cheerfully to Ada from the open window again . I could understand the stillness in the house and the thoughtfulness it expressed on the part of all those who had always been so good to me . I could weep in the exquisite felicity of my heart and be as happy in my weakness as ever I had been in my strength . By and by my strength began to be restored . Instead of lying , with so strange a calmness , watching what was done for me , as if it were done for some one else whom I was quietly sorry for , I helped it a little , and so on to a little more and much more , until I became useful to myself , and interested , and attached to life again . How well I remember the pleasant afternoon when I was raised in bed with pillows for the first time to enjoy a great tea - drinking with Charley ! The little creature — sent into the world , surely , to minister to the weak and sick — was so happy , and so busy , and stopped so often in her preparations to lay her head upon my bosom , and fondle me , and cry with joyful tears she was so glad , she was so glad , that I was obliged to say , “
241744	241907	241910	241910	Charley	336	” So Charley became as quiet as a mouse and took her bright face here and there across and across the two rooms , out of the shade into the divine sunshine , and out of the sunshine into the shade , while I watched her peacefully . When all her preparations were concluded and the pretty tea - table with its little delicacies to tempt me , and its white cloth , and its flowers , and everything so lovingly and beautifully arranged for me by Ada downstairs , was ready at the bedside , I felt sure I was steady enough to say something to Charley that was not new to my thoughts . First I complimented Charley on the room , and indeed it was so fresh and airy , so spotless and neat , that I could scarce believe I had been lying there so long . This delighted Charley , and her face was brighter than before . “
241912	241919	241910	241910	Charley	336	” said I , looking round , “
241932	241952	241910	241910	Charley	336	” Poor little Charley looked round too and pretended to shake her head as if there were nothing absent . “
241963	241968	241974	241974	miss	9584	” I asked her . “
241976	241980	241974	241974	miss	9584	” said Charley . “
241987	241988	241985	241985	Charley	336	” “
242003	242004	241991	241991	I	0	” “
242008	242012	242013	242013	I	0	” said I , “
242036	242131	242137	242137	Charley	336	” Charley got up from the table , making as if she had forgotten something , and went into the next room ; and I heard her sob there . I had thought of this very often . I was now certain of it . I could thank God that it was not a shock to me now . I called Charley back , and when she came — at first pretending to smile , but as she drew nearer to me , looking grieved — I took her in my arms and said , “
242151	242258	242259	242259	My	0	” I was presently so far advanced as to be able to sit up in a great chair and even giddily to walk into the adjoining room , leaning on Charley . The mirror was gone from its usual place in that room too , but what I had to bear was none the harder to bear for that . My guardian had throughout been earnest to visit me , and there was now no good reason why I should deny myself that happiness . He came one morning , and when he first came in , could only hold me in his embrace and say , “
242265	242304	242259	242259	My	0	” I had long known — who could know better?—what a deep fountain of affection and generosity his heart was ; and was it not worth my trivial suffering and change to fill such a place in it ? “
242309	242313	242259	242259	My	0	” I thought . “
242351	242407	242408	242410	My little woman	2319	” He sat down by me on the sofa , supporting me with his arm . For a little while he sat with his hand over his face , but when he removed it , fell into his usual manner . There never can have been , there never can be , a pleasanter manner . “
242412	242416	242408	242410	My little woman	2319	” said he , “
242436	242437	242425	242429	Such an inflexible little woman	5691	” “
242445	242448	242443	242443	guardian	10146	” said I. “
242453	242458	242443	242443	guardian	10146	” he repeated tenderly . “
242522	242543	242508	242508	Rick	317	” I had read of Caddy in Ada ’s letters , but not of Richard . I told him so . “
242551	242555	242508	242508	Rick	317	” he replied . “
242568	242569	242571	242571	you	0	” “
242579	242587	242571	242571	you	0	” said I , repeating his emphasis . “
242612	242613	242614	242614	He	317	” “
242622	242627	242616	242616	he	317	” returned my guardian , “
242737	242738	242729	242729	I	0	” “
242747	242748	242745	242745	guardian	10146	” “
242759	242764	242745	242745	guardian	10146	” he said laughingly . “
242957	242958	242963	242963	guardian	10146	” “
242965	242971	242963	242963	guardian	10146	” I asked , amazed , “
242980	242981	242973	242973	Richard	291	” “
242990	242994	242973	242973	Richard	291	” he said , “
243030	243031	243027	243027	HIS	317	” “
243041	243042	243039	243039	guardian	10146	” “
243139	243162	243163	243163	We	5716	” I could not help expressing something of my wonder and regret that his benevolent , disinterested intentions had prospered so little . “
243172	243177	243163	243163	We	5716	” he cheerfully replied ; “
243245	243246	243236	243236	Jarndyce	286	” “
243271	243272	243273	243273	We	5716	” “
243281	243286	243273	243273	We	5716	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
243369	243385	243397	243397	Chancery	7	” here he fell into a lower tone , as if he were thinking aloud , “
243481	243551	243478	243479	my dear	9540	” He had supported me , as at first , all this time , and his tenderness was so precious to me that I leaned my head upon his shoulder and loved him as if he had been my father . I resolved in my own mind in this little pause , by some means , to see Richard when I grew strong and try to set him right . “
243559	243564	243554	243555	better subjects	5732	” said my guardian , “
243610	243648	243601	243601	Ada	290	” I had been thinking of that too . A little in connexion with the absent mirrors , but not much , for I knew my loving girl would be changed by no change in my looks . “
243652	243656	243649	243650	Dear guardian	3270	” said I , “
243679	243680	243671	243671	she	5734	” “
243691	243732	243686	243687	Dame Durden	343	” He was so good , his touch expressed such endearing compassion and affection , and the tone of his voice carried such comfort into my heart that I stopped for a little while , quite unable to go on . “
243741	243745	243737	243737	you	0	” said he . “
243750	243751	243753	243753	I	0	” “
243761	243770	243753	243753	I	0	” I began afresh after a short while , “
243862	243941	243853	243853	I	0	” I hope it was not a poor thing in me to wish to be a little more used to my altered self before I met the eyes of the dear girl I longed so ardently to see , but it is the truth . I did . He understood me , I was sure ; but I was not afraid of that . If it were a poor thing , I knew he would pass it over . “
243947	243952	243955	243955	her	5740	” said my guardian , “
244042	244059	244060	244060	My	0	” And my guardian put a letter in my hand , without any ordinary beginning such as “
244064	244073	244060	244060	My	0	” but rushing at once into the words , “
244103	244196	244091	244091	I	0	” and then with the utmost seriousness , and in the most emphatic terms , going on to make the extraordinary declaration he had quoted . We did not appreciate the writer the less for laughing heartily over it , and we settled that I should send him a letter of thanks on the morrow and accept his offer . It was a most agreeable one to me , for all the places I could have thought of , I should have liked to go to none so well as Chesney Wold . “
244202	244212	244213	244213	I	0	” said my guardian , looking at his watch , “
244301	244317	244294	244294	she	376	” The old conspiracy to make me happy ! Everybody seemed to be in it ! “
244322	244327	244294	244294	she	376	” said my guardian , “
244383	244738	244739	244739	My	0	” I have no doubt he knew there would be something in the simple image of the poor afflicted creature that would fall like a gentle lesson on my mind at that time . I felt it as he spoke to me . I could not tell him heartily enough how ready I was to receive her . I had always pitied her , never so much as now . I had always been glad of my little power to soothe her under her calamity , but never , never , half so glad before . We arranged a time for Miss Flite to come out by the coach and share my early dinner . When my guardian left me , I turned my face away upon my couch and prayed to be forgiven if I , surrounded by such blessings , had magnified to myself the little trial that I had to undergo . The childish prayer of that old birthday when I had aspired to be industrious , contented , and true - hearted and to do good to some one and win some love to myself if I could came back into my mind with a reproachful sense of all the happiness I had since enjoyed and all the affectionate hearts that had been turned towards me . If I were weak now , what had I profited by those mercies ? I repeated the old childish prayer in its old childish words and found that its old peace had not departed from it . My guardian now came every day . In a week or so more I could walk about our rooms and hold long talks with Ada from behind the window - curtain . Yet I never saw her , for I had not as yet the courage to look at the dear face , though I could have done so easily without her seeing me . On the appointed day Miss Flite arrived . The poor little creature ran into my room quite forgetful of her usual dignity , and crying from her very heart of hearts , “
244744	244755	244741	244742	Fitz Jarndyce	439	” fell upon my neck and kissed me twenty times . “
244759	244770	244741	244742	Fitz Jarndyce	439	” said she , putting her hand into her reticule , “
244790	244828	244834	244835	Fitz Jarndyce	439	” Charley gave her one , and the good creature certainly made use of it , for she held it to her eyes with both hands and sat so , shedding tears for the next ten minutes . “
244837	244844	244834	244835	Fitz Jarndyce	439	” she was careful to explain . “
244903	244937	244896	244897	my dear	9540	” Miss Flite here looked at Charley , who had been to meet her at the place where the coach stopped . Charley glanced at me and looked unwilling to pursue the suggestion . “
244943	244948	244896	244897	my dear	9540	” said Miss Flite , “
244995	245004	244992	244992	you	439	” said Miss Flite , touching her forehead . “
245008	245009	244992	244992	you	439	” “
245018	245033	245012	245012	you	0	” said I , smiling , for I saw she wanted to go on . “
245047	245063	245042	245042	you	0	” Miss Flite looked at Charley for advice in this important crisis , who said , “
245076	245085	245070	245070	you	0	” and therein gratified Miss Flite beyond measure . “
245093	245103	245089	245091	our young friend	9551	” said she to me in her mysterious way . “
245156	245157	245158	245158	Jenny	357	” “
245166	245170	245158	245158	Jenny	357	” said Charley . “
245174	245183	245184	245184	Jenny	357	” Miss Flite acquiesced with the greatest suavity . “
245255	245256	245249	245253	the lady with the veil	5773	” “
245263	245275	245258	245258	you	0	” said Charley , to whom I looked in some astonishment , “
245330	245331	245306	245306	I	0	” “
245334	245354	245306	245306	I	0	” whispered Miss Flite , making a variety of motions about her own forehead to express intellect in Charley . “
245376	245377	245366	245366	she	357	” “
245382	245386	245380	245380	Charley	336	” I returned . “
245393	245394	245397	245397	miss	9584	” “
245399	245403	245397	245397	miss	9584	” said Charley , “
245460	245461	245458	245458	miss	9584	” “
245469	245472	245473	245474	My love	9612	” said I. “
245476	245493	245473	245474	My love	9612	” Miss Flite suggested , advancing her lips to my ear with her most mysterious look , “
245551	245773	245548	245549	the jeweller	5791	” I did not think very much about this lady then , for I had an impression that it might be Caddy . Besides , my attention was diverted by my visitor , who was cold after her ride and looked hungry and who , our dinner being brought in , required some little assistance in arraying herself with great satisfaction in a pitiable old scarf and a much - worn and often - mended pair of gloves , which she had brought down in a paper parcel . I had to preside , too , over the entertainment , consisting of a dish of fish , a roast fowl , a sweetbread , vegetables , pudding , and Madeira ; and it was so pleasant to see how she enjoyed it , and with what state and ceremony she did honour to it , that I was soon thinking of nothing else . When we had finished and had our little dessert before us , embellished by the hands of my dear , who would yield the superintendence of everything prepared for me to no one , Miss Flite was so very chatty and happy that I thought I would lead her to her own history , as she was always pleased to talk about herself . I began by saying “
245787	245788	245784	245785	Miss Flite	376	” “
245809	245842	245843	245843	My	0	” There was an anxiety even in her hopefulness that made me doubtful if I had done right in approaching the subject . I thought I would say no more about it . “
245849	245854	245855	245856	My brother	3076	” said Miss Flite . “
245873	245874	245870	245870	I	0	” “
245879	245880	245881	245881	Ye	5799	” “
245892	245924	245889	245890	my dear	9540	” said she . As I saw she would go on , I thought it best to try to be serviceable to her by meeting the theme rather than avoiding it . “
245931	245935	245889	245890	my dear	9540	” said I , “
245943	245944	245889	245890	my dear	9540	” “
245950	245955	245889	245890	my dear	9540	” she answered promptly , “
245961	245962	245889	245890	my dear	9540	” “
245971	245972	245889	245890	my dear	9540	” “
245977	245981	245889	245890	my dear	9540	” said she . “
246009	246024	246001	246001	I	0	” She slightly showed me her arm , and it was fearfully thin indeed . “
246030	246039	246001	246001	I	0	” she went on in her mysterious way , “
246093	246120	246089	246089	you	9540	” I tried to assure her that this was not so . She heard me patiently and smilingly , but was ready with her own answer . “
246195	246210	246220	246220	people	858	” What could they do , did she think ? I mildly asked her . “
246213	246218	246220	246220	people	858	” returned Miss Flite . “
246267	246312	246252	246252	them	858	” She tapped me several times upon the arm and nodded good - humouredly as if she were anxious I should understand that I had no cause to fear her , though she spoke so gloomily , and confided these awful secrets to me . “
246317	246321	246252	246252	them	858	” said she . “
246541	246584	246585	246585	You	5827	” Having got over her own short narrative , in the delivery of which she had spoken in a low , strained voice , as if the shock were fresh upon her , she gradually resumed her usual air of amiable importance . “
246774	246779	246768	246769	Fitz Jarndyce	439	” speaking low again , “
246807	246859	246866	246866	I	0	” She looked at me in silence for some moments , with her face gradually softening into a smile . Seeming to fear that she had been too gloomy , and seeming also to lose the connexion in her mind , she said politely as she sipped her glass of wine , “
246890	246942	246877	246877	I	0	” I was much impressed by her allusion to Richard and by the sad meaning , so sadly illustrated in her poor pinched form , that made its way through all her incoherence . But happily for her , she was quite complacent again now and beamed with nods and smiles . “
246948	246963	246945	246946	my dear	9540	” she said , gaily , reaching another hand to put it upon mine . “
246979	246995	246996	246997	My physician	2879	” I was obliged to confess that I did not quite know what she meant . “
247044	247045	247027	247027	I	0	” “
247055	247059	247046	247047	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” said I , “
247074	247075	247071	247072	Miss Flite	376	” “
247081	247085	247071	247072	Miss Flite	376	” she returned , “
247098	247099	247090	247090	you	9542	” “
247102	247105	247090	247090	you	9542	” said I. “
247119	247120	247116	247117	Fitz Jarndyce	439	” “
247123	247126	247116	247117	Fitz Jarndyce	439	” said I. “
247136	247137	247131	247131	I	0	” “
247200	247201	247202	247203	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” “
247206	247207	247202	247203	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” “
247382	247612	247377	247377	you	9540	” And I DID read all the noble history , though very slowly and imperfectly then , for my eyes were so dimmed that I could not see the words , and I cried so much that I was many times obliged to lay down the long account she had cut out of the newspaper . I felt so triumphant ever to have known the man who had done such generous and gallant deeds , I felt such glowing exultation in his renown , I so admired and loved what he had done , that I envied the storm - worn people who had fallen at his feet and blessed him as their preserver . I could myself have kneeled down then , so far away , and blessed him in my rapture that he should be so truly good and brave . I felt that no one — mother , sister , wife — could honour him more than I. I did , indeed ! My poor little visitor made me a present of the account , and when as the evening began to close in she rose to take her leave , lest she should miss the coach by which she was to return , she was still full of the shipwreck , which I had not yet sufficiently composed myself to understand in all its details . “
247616	247629	247377	247377	you	9540	” said she as she carefully folded up her scarf and gloves , “
247654	247672	247648	247648	You	9540	” That he well deserved one , yes . That he would ever have one , no . “
247679	247725	247676	247677	Fitz Jarndyce	439	” she asked rather sharply . I said it was not the custom in England to confer titles on men distinguished by peaceful services , however good and great , unless occasionally when they consisted of the accumulation of some very large amount of money . “
247731	247736	247728	247729	good gracious	5867	” said Miss Flite , “
247817	248441	248442	248442	Esther	280	” I am afraid she believed what she said , for there were moments when she was very mad indeed . And now I must part with the little secret I have thus far tried to keep . I had thought , sometimes , that Mr. Woodcourt loved me and that if he had been richer he would perhaps have told me that he loved me before he went away . I had thought , sometimes , that if he had done so , I should have been glad of it . But how much better it was now that this had never happened ! What should I have suffered if I had had to write to him and tell him that the poor face he had known as mine was quite gone from me and that I freely released him from his bondage to one whom he had never seen ! Oh , it was so much better as it was ! With a great pang mercifully spared me , I could take back to my heart my childish prayer to be all he had so brightly shown himself ; and there was nothing to be undone : no chain for me to break or for him to drag ; and I could go , please God , my lowly way along the path of duty , and he could go his nobler way upon its broader road ; and though we were apart upon the journey , I might aspire to meet him , unselfishly , innocently , better far than he had thought me when I found some favour in his eyes , at the journey ’s end . CHAPTER XXXVI Chesney Wold Charley and I did not set off alone upon our expedition into Lincolnshire . My guardian had made up his mind not to lose sight of me until I was safe in Mr. Boythorn ’s house , so he accompanied us , and we were two days upon the road . I found every breath of air , and every scent , and every flower and leaf and blade of grass , and every passing cloud , and everything in nature , more beautiful and wonderful to me than I had ever found it yet . This was my first gain from my illness . How little I had lost , when the wide world was so full of delight for me . My guardian intending to go back immediately , we appointed , on our way down , a day when my dear girl should come . I wrote her a letter , of which he took charge , and he left us within half an hour of our arrival at our destination , on a delightful evening in the early summer - time . If a good fairy had built the house for me with a wave of her wand , and I had been a princess and her favoured god - child , I could not have been more considered in it . So many preparations were made for me and such an endearing remembrance was shown of all my little tastes and likings that I could have sat down , overcome , a dozen times before I had revisited half the rooms . I did better than that , however , by showing them all to Charley instead . Charley ’s delight calmed mine ; and after we had had a walk in the garden , and Charley had exhausted her whole vocabulary of admiring expressions , I was as tranquilly happy as I ought to have been . It was a great comfort to be able to say to myself after tea , “
248468	248708	248709	248709	Esther	280	” He had left a note of welcome for me , as sunny as his own face , and had confided his bird to my care , which I knew to be his highest mark of confidence . Accordingly I wrote a little note to him in London , telling him how all his favourite plants and trees were looking , and how the most astonishing of birds had chirped the honours of the house to me in the most hospitable manner , and how , after singing on my shoulder , to the inconceivable rapture of my little maid , he was then at roost in the usual corner of his cage , but whether dreaming or no I could not report . My note finished and sent off to the post , I made myself very busy in unpacking and arranging ; and I sent Charley to bed in good time and told her I should want her no more that night . For I had not yet looked in the glass and had never asked to have my own restored to me . I knew this to be a weakness which must be overcome , but I had always said to myself that I would begin afresh when I got to where I now was . Therefore I had wanted to be alone , and therefore I said , now alone , in my own room , “
248742	249242	248736	248736	your	280	” I was quite resolved to keep it , but I sat down for a little while first to reflect upon all my blessings . And then I said my prayers and thought a little more . My hair had not been cut off , though it had been in danger more than once . It was long and thick . I let it down , and shook it out , and went up to the glass upon the dressing - table . There was a little muslin curtain drawn across it . I drew it back and stood for a moment looking through such a veil of my own hair that I could see nothing else . Then I put my hair aside and looked at the reflection in the mirror , encouraged by seeing how placidly it looked at me . I was very much changed — oh , very , very much . At first my face was so strange to me that I think I should have put my hands before it and started back but for the encouragement I have mentioned . Very soon it became more familiar , and then I knew the extent of the alteration in it better than I had done at first . It was not like what I had expected , but I had expected nothing definite , and I dare say anything definite would have surprised me . I had never been a beauty and had never thought myself one , but I had been very different from this . It was all gone now . Heaven was so good to me that I could let it go with a few not bitter tears and could stand there arranging my hair for the night quite thankfully . One thing troubled me , and I considered it for a long time before I went to sleep . I had kept Mr. Woodcourt ’s flowers . When they were withered I had dried them and put them in a book that I was fond of . Nobody knew this , not even Ada . I was doubtful whether I had a right to preserve what he had sent to one so different — whether it was generous towards him to do it . I wished to be generous to him , even in the secret depths of my heart , which he would never know , because I could have loved him — could have been devoted to him . At last I came to the conclusion that I might keep them if I treasured them only as a remembrance of what was irrevocably past and gone , never to be looked back on any more , in any other light . I hope this may not seem trivial . I was very much in earnest . I took care to be up early in the morning and to be before the glass when Charley came in on tiptoe . “
249249	249255	249247	249247	miss	9584	” cried Charley , starting . “
249260	249261	249258	249258	you	9584	” “
249266	249276	249258	249258	you	9584	” said I , quietly putting up my hair . “
249288	249626	249627	249627	Stubbs	594	” I saw it was a weight off Charley ’s mind , but it was a greater weight off mine . I knew the worst now and was composed to it . I shall not conceal , as I go on , the weaknesses I could not quite conquer , but they always passed from me soon and the happier frame of mind stayed by me faithfully . Wishing to be fully re - established in my strength and my good spirits before Ada came , I now laid down a little series of plans with Charley for being in the fresh air all day long . We were to be out before breakfast , and were to dine early , and were to be out again before and after dinner , and were to talk in the garden after tea , and were to go to rest betimes , and were to climb every hill and explore every road , lane , and field in the neighbourhood . As to restoratives and strengthening delicacies , Mr. Boythorn ’s good housekeeper was for ever trotting about with something to eat or drink in her hand ; I could not even be heard of as resting in the park but she would come trotting after me with a basket , her cheerful face shining with a lecture on the importance of frequent nourishment . Then there was a pony expressly for my riding , a chubby pony with a short neck and a mane all over his eyes who could canter — when he would — so easily and quietly that he was a treasure . In a very few days he would come to me in the paddock when I called him , and eat out of my hand , and follow me about . We arrived at such a capital understanding that when he was jogging with me lazily , and rather obstinately , down some shady lane , if I patted his neck and said , “
249664	249872	249648	249648	you	594	” he would give his head a comical shake or two and set off directly , while Charley would stand still and laugh with such enjoyment that her laughter was like music . I do n’t know who had given Stubbs his name , but it seemed to belong to him as naturally as his rough coat . Once we put him in a little chaise and drove him triumphantly through the green lanes for five miles ; but all at once , as we were extolling him to the skies , he seemed to take it ill that he should have been accompanied so far by the circle of tantalizing little gnats that had been hovering round and round his ears the whole way without appearing to advance an inch , and stopped to think about it . I suppose he came to the decision that it was not to be borne , for he steadily refused to move until I gave the reins to Charley and got out and walked , when he followed me with a sturdy sort of good humour , putting his head under my arm and rubbing his ear against my sleeve . It was in vain for me to say , “
249899	250299	250300	250300	Mother	9526	” for the moment I left him , he stood stock still again . Consequently I was obliged to lead the way , as before ; and in this order we returned home , to the great delight of the village . Charley and I had reason to call it the most friendly of villages , I am sure , for in a week ’s time the people were so glad to see us go by , though ever so frequently in the course of a day , that there were faces of greeting in every cottage . I had known many of the grown people before and almost all the children , but now the very steeple began to wear a familiar and affectionate look . Among my new friends was an old old woman who lived in such a little thatched and whitewashed dwelling that when the outside shutter was turned up on its hinges , it shut up the whole house - front . This old lady had a grandson who was a sailor , and I wrote a letter to him for her and drew at the top of it the chimney - corner in which she had brought him up and where his old stool yet occupied its old place . This was considered by the whole village the most wonderful achievement in the world , but when an answer came back all the way from Plymouth , in which he mentioned that he was going to take the picture all the way to America , and from America would write again , I got all the credit that ought to have been given to the post - office and was invested with the merit of the whole system . Thus , what with being so much in the air , playing with so many children , gossiping with so many people , sitting on invitation in so many cottages , going on with Charley ’s education , and writing long letters to Ada every day , I had scarcely any time to think about that little loss of mine and was almost always cheerful . If I did think of it at odd moments now and then , I had only to be busy and forget it . I felt it more than I had hoped I should once when a child said , “
250317	250514	250312	250312	she	1180	” But when I found the child was not less fond of me , and drew its soft hand over my face with a kind of pitying protection in its touch , that soon set me up again . There were many little occurrences which suggested to me , with great consolation , how natural it is to gentle hearts to be considerate and delicate towards any inferiority . One of these particularly touched me . I happened to stroll into the little church when a marriage was just concluded , and the young couple had to sign the register . The bridegroom , to whom the pen was handed first , made a rude cross for his mark ; the bride , who came next , did the same . Now , I had known the bride when I was last there , not only as the prettiest girl in the place , but as having quite distinguished herself in the school , and I could not help looking at her with some surprise . She came aside and whispered to me , while tears of honest love and admiration stood in her bright eyes , “
250549	251286	251287	251288	Miss Summerson	280	” Why , what had I to fear , I thought , when there was this nobility in the soul of a labouring man ’s daughter ! The air blew as freshly and revivingly upon me as it had ever blown , and the healthy colour came into my new face as it had come into my old one . Charley was wonderful to see , she was so radiant and so rosy ; and we both enjoyed the whole day and slept soundly the whole night . There was a favourite spot of mine in the park - woods of Chesney Wold where a seat had been erected commanding a lovely view . The wood had been cleared and opened to improve this point of sight , and the bright sunny landscape beyond was so beautiful that I rested there at least once every day . A picturesque part of the Hall , called the Ghost ’s Walk , was seen to advantage from this higher ground ; and the startling name , and the old legend in the Dedlock family which I had heard from Mr. Boythorn accounting for it , mingled with the view and gave it something of a mysterious interest in addition to its real charms . There was a bank here , too , which was a famous one for violets ; and as it was a daily delight of Charley ’s to gather wild flowers , she took as much to the spot as I did . It would be idle to inquire now why I never went close to the house or never went inside it . The family were not there , I had heard on my arrival , and were not expected . I was far from being incurious or uninterested about the building ; on the contrary , I often sat in this place wondering how the rooms ranged and whether any echo like a footstep really did resound at times , as the story said , upon the lonely Ghost ’s Walk . The indefinable feeling with which Lady Dedlock had impressed me may have had some influence in keeping me from the house even when she was absent . I am not sure . Her face and figure were associated with it , naturally ; but I can not say that they repelled me from it , though something did . For whatever reason or no reason , I had never once gone near it , down to the day at which my story now arrives . I was resting at my favourite point after a long ramble , and Charley was gathering violets at a little distance from me . I had been looking at the Ghost ’s Walk lying in a deep shade of masonry afar off and picturing to myself the female shape that was said to haunt it when I became aware of a figure approaching through the wood . The perspective was so long and so darkened by leaves , and the shadows of the branches on the ground made it so much more intricate to the eye , that at first I could not discern what figure it was . By little and little it revealed itself to be a woman’s — a lady’s — Lady Dedlock ’s . She was alone and coming to where I sat with a much quicker step , I observed to my surprise , than was usual with her . I was fluttered by her being unexpectedly so near ( she was almost within speaking distance before I knew her ) and would have risen to continue my walk . But I could not . I was rendered motionless . Not so much by her hurried gesture of entreaty , not so much by her quick advance and outstretched hands , not so much by the great change in her manner and the absence of her haughty self - restraint , as by a something in her face that I had pined for and dreamed of when I was a little child , something I had never seen in any face , something I had never seen in hers before . A dread and faintness fell upon me , and I called to Charley . Lady Dedlock stopped upon the instant and changed back almost to what I had known her . “
251298	251306	251307	251307	You	280	” she said , now advancing slowly . “
251332	251398	251323	251323	I	0	” I could no more have removed my eyes from her pale face than I could have stirred from the bench on which I sat . She gave me her hand , and its deadly coldness , so at variance with the enforced composure of her features , deepened the fascination that overpowered me . I can not say what was in my whirling thoughts . “
251404	251409	251323	251323	I	0	” she asked kindly . “
251422	251423	251419	251420	Lady Dedlock	264	” “
251430	251431	251426	251428	your young attendant	5882	” “
251434	251435	251426	251428	your young attendant	5882	” “
251450	251451	251437	251437	you	264	” “
251454	251458	251437	251437	you	264	” said I , “
251471	251620	251465	251465	I	0	” Charley , with her best curtsy , blushingly tied on her bonnet and went her way . When she was gone , Lady Dedlock sat down on the seat beside me . I can not tell in any words what the state of my mind was when I saw in her hand my handkerchief with which I had covered the dead baby . I looked at her , but I could not see her , I could not hear her , I could not draw my breath . The beating of my heart was so violent and wild that I felt as if my life were breaking from me . But when she caught me to her breast , kissed me , wept over me , compassionated me , and called me back to myself ; when she fell down on her knees and cried to me , “
251642	251946	251465	251465	I	0	me!”—when I saw her at my feet on the bare earth in her great agony of mind , I felt , through all my tumult of emotion , a burst of gratitude to the providence of God that I was so changed as that I never could disgrace her by any trace of likeness , as that nobody could ever now look at me and look at her and remotely think of any near tie between us . I raised my mother up , praying and beseeching her not to stoop before me in such affliction and humiliation . I did so in broken , incoherent words , for besides the trouble I was in , it frightened me to see her at MY feet . I told her — or I tried to tell her — that if it were for me , her child , under any circumstances to take upon me to forgive her , I did it , and had done it , many , many years . I told her that my heart overflowed with love for her , that it was natural love which nothing in the past had changed or could change . That it was not for me , then resting for the first time on my mother ’s bosom , to take her to account for having given me life , but that my duty was to bless her and receive her , though the whole world turned from her , and that I only asked her leave to do it . I held my mother in my embrace , and she held me in hers , and among the still woods in the silence of the summer day there seemed to be nothing but our two troubled minds that was not at peace . “
251953	251958	251465	251465	I	0	” groaned my mother , “
252024	252055	252020	252020	I	0	” Even in the thinking of her endurance , she drew her habitual air of proud indifference about her like a veil , though she soon cast it off again . “
252089	252442	252078	252079	a husband	5055	” These words she uttered with a suppressed cry of despair , more terrible in its sound than any shriek . Covering her face with her hands , she shrank down in my embrace as if she were unwilling that I should touch her ; nor could I , by my utmost persuasions or by any endearments I could use , prevail upon her to rise . She said , no , no , no , she could only speak to me so ; she must be proud and disdainful everywhere else ; she would be humbled and ashamed there , in the only natural moments of her life . My unhappy mother told me that in my illness she had been nearly frantic . She had but then known that her child was living . She could not have suspected me to be that child before . She had followed me down here to speak to me but once in all her life . We never could associate , never could communicate , never probably from that time forth could interchange another word on earth . She put into my hands a letter she had written for my reading only and said when I had read it and destroyed it — but not so much for her sake , since she asked nothing , as for her husband ’s and my own — I must evermore consider her as dead . If I could believe that she loved me , in this agony in which I saw her , with a mother ’s love , she asked me to do that , for then I might think of her with a greater pity , imagining what she suffered . She had put herself beyond all hope and beyond all help . Whether she preserved her secret until death or it came to be discovered and she brought dishonour and disgrace upon the name she had taken , it was her solitary struggle always ; and no affection could come near her , and no human creature could render her any aid . “
252451	252455	252078	252079	a husband	5055	” I asked . “
252464	252465	252078	252079	a husband	5055	” “
252468	252473	252078	252079	a husband	5055	” replied my mother . “

252512	252513	252506	252506	you	5890	” “
252534	252543	252544	252544	I	0	” said my mother , kissing my hands . “

252622	252627	252608	252608	he	5896	” I said alarmed . “

252784	252785	252786	252786	I	0	” “
252874	252875	252876	252877	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” “
252879	252889	252876	252877	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” I was beginning when my mother hurriedly inquired , “
252894	252895	252891	252891	HE	286	” “
252898	252901	252891	252891	HE	286	” said I. “
252913	252931	252933	252933	he	286	” And I told her what he had related to me as his knowledge of my story . “
252940	252944	252933	252933	he	286	” said I , “
252951	252978	252948	252948	he	286	” My mother , who until this time had made no change in her position , raised her hand up to my lips and stopped me . “
252984	252992	252948	252948	he	286	” she said after a little while . “
253026	253192	253193	253193	My	0	” I explained , as nearly as I could then , or can recall now — for my agitation and distress throughout were so great that I scarcely understood myself , though every word that was uttered in the mother ’s voice , so unfamiliar and so melancholy to me , which in my childhood I had never learned to love and recognize , had never been sung to sleep with , had never heard a blessing from , had never had a hope inspired by , made an enduring impression on my memory — I say I explained , or tried to do it , how I had only hoped that Mr. Jarndyce , who had been the best of fathers to me , might be able to afford some counsel and support to her . But my mother answered no , it was impossible ; no one could help her . Through the desert that lay before her , she must go alone . “
253199	253203	253193	253193	My	0	” she said . “
253339	254050	254051	254051	Your	5916	” We held one another for a little space yet , but she was so firm that she took my hands away , and put them back against my breast , and with a last kiss as she held them there , released them , and went from me into the wood . I was alone , and calm and quiet below me in the sun and shade lay the old house , with its terraces and turrets , on which there had seemed to me to be such complete repose when I first saw it , but which now looked like the obdurate and unpitying watcher of my mother ’s misery . Stunned as I was , as weak and helpless at first as I had ever been in my sick chamber , the necessity of guarding against the danger of discovery , or even of the remotest suspicion , did me service . I took such precautions as I could to hide from Charley that I had been crying , and I constrained myself to think of every sacred obligation that there was upon me to be careful and collected . It was not a little while before I could succeed or could even restrain bursts of grief , but after an hour or so I was better and felt that I might return . I went home very slowly and told Charley , whom I found at the gate looking for me , that I had been tempted to extend my walk after Lady Dedlock had left me and that I was over - tired and would lie down . Safe in my own room , I read the letter . I clearly derived from it — and that was much then — that I had not been abandoned by my mother . Her elder and only sister , the godmother of my childhood , discovering signs of life in me when I had been laid aside as dead , had in her stern sense of duty , with no desire or willingness that I should live , reared me in rigid secrecy and had never again beheld my mother ’s face from within a few hours of my birth . So strangely did I hold my place in this world that until within a short time back I had never , to my own mother ’s knowledge , breathed — had been buried — had never been endowed with life — had never borne a name . When she had first seen me in the church she had been startled and had thought of what would have been like me if it had ever lived , and had lived on , but that was all then . What more the letter told me needs not to be repeated here . It has its own times and places in my story . My first care was to burn what my mother had written and to consume even its ashes . I hope it may not appear very unnatural or bad in me that I then became heavily sorrowful to think I had ever been reared . That I felt as if I knew it would have been better and happier for many people if indeed I had never breathed . That I had a terror of myself as the danger and the possible disgrace of my own mother and of a proud family name . That I was so confused and shaken as to be possessed by a belief that it was right and had been intended that I should die in my birth , and that it was wrong and not intended that I should be then alive . These are the real feelings that I had . I fell asleep worn out , and when I awoke I cried afresh to think that I was back in the world with my load of trouble for others . I was more than ever frightened of myself , thinking anew of her against whom I was a witness , of the owner of Chesney Wold , of the new and terrible meaning of the old words now moaning in my ear like a surge upon the shore , “
254095	254104	254063	254063	hers	9534	” With them , those other words returned , “
254119	255480	255481	255481	Charley	336	” I could not disentangle all that was about me , and I felt as if the blame and the shame were all in me , and the visitation had come down . The day waned into a gloomy evening , overcast and sad , and I still contended with the same distress . I went out alone , and after walking a little in the park , watching the dark shades falling on the trees and the fitful flight of the bats , which sometimes almost touched me , was attracted to the house for the first time . Perhaps I might not have gone near it if I had been in a stronger frame of mind . As it was , I took the path that led close by it . I did not dare to linger or to look up , but I passed before the terrace garden with its fragrant odours , and its broad walks , and its well - kept beds and smooth turf ; and I saw how beautiful and grave it was , and how the old stone balustrades and parapets , and wide flights of shallow steps , were seamed by time and weather ; and how the trained moss and ivy grew about them , and around the old stone pedestal of the sun - dial ; and I heard the fountain falling . Then the way went by long lines of dark windows diversified by turreted towers and porches of eccentric shapes , where old stone lions and grotesque monsters bristled outside dens of shadow and snarled at the evening gloom over the escutcheons they held in their grip . Thence the path wound underneath a gateway , and through a court - yard where the principal entrance was ( I hurried quickly on ) , and by the stables where none but deep voices seemed to be , whether in the murmuring of the wind through the strong mass of ivy holding to a high red wall , or in the low complaining of the weathercock , or in the barking of the dogs , or in the slow striking of a clock . So , encountering presently a sweet smell of limes , whose rustling I could hear , I turned with the turning of the path to the south front , and there above me were the balustrades of the Ghost ’s Walk and one lighted window that might be my mother ’s . The way was paved here , like the terrace overhead , and my footsteps from being noiseless made an echoing sound upon the flags . Stopping to look at nothing , but seeing all I did see as I went , I was passing quickly on , and in a few moments should have passed the lighted window , when my echoing footsteps brought it suddenly into my mind that there was a dreadful truth in the legend of the Ghost ’s Walk , that it was I who was to bring calamity upon the stately house and that my warning feet were haunting it even then . Seized with an augmented terror of myself which turned me cold , I ran from myself and everything , retraced the way by which I had come , and never paused until I had gained the lodge - gate , and the park lay sullen and black behind me . Not before I was alone in my own room for the night and had again been dejected and unhappy there did I begin to know how wrong and thankless this state was . But from my darling who was coming on the morrow , I found a joyful letter , full of such loving anticipation that I must have been of marble if it had not moved me ; from my guardian , too , I found another letter , asking me to tell Dame Durden , if I should see that little woman anywhere , that they had moped most pitiably without her , that the housekeeping was going to rack and ruin , that nobody else could manage the keys , and that everybody in and about the house declared it was not the same house and was becoming rebellious for her return . Two such letters together made me think how far beyond my deserts I was beloved and how happy I ought to be . That made me think of all my past life ; and that brought me , as it ought to have done before , into a better condition . For I saw very well that I could not have been intended to die , or I should never have lived ; not to say should never have been reserved for such a happy life . I saw very well how many things had worked together for my welfare , and that if the sins of the fathers were sometimes visited upon the children , the phrase did not mean what I had in the morning feared it meant . I knew I was as innocent of my birth as a queen of hers and that before my Heavenly Father I should not be punished for birth nor a queen rewarded for it . I had had experience , in the shock of that very day , that I could , even thus soon , find comforting reconcilements to the change that had fallen on me . I renewed my resolutions and prayed to be strengthened in them , pouring out my heart for myself and for my unhappy mother and feeling that the darkness of the morning was passing away . It was not upon my sleep ; and when the next day ’s light awoke me , it was gone . My dear girl was to arrive at five o’clock in the afternoon . How to help myself through the intermediate time better than by taking a long walk along the road by which she was to come , I did not know ; so Charley and I and Stubbs — Stubbs saddled , for we never drove him after the one great occasion — made a long expedition along that road and back . On our return , we held a great review of the house and garden and saw that everything was in its prettiest condition , and had the bird out ready as an important part of the establishment . There were more than two full hours yet to elapse before she could come , and in that interval , which seemed a long one , I must confess I was nervously anxious about my altered looks . I loved my darling so well that I was more concerned for their effect on her than on any one . I was not in this slight distress because I at all repined — I am quite certain I did not , that day — but , I thought , would she be wholly prepared ? When she first saw me , might she not be a little shocked and disappointed ? Might it not prove a little worse than she expected ? Might she not look for her old Esther and not find her ? Might she not have to grow used to me and to begin all over again ? I knew the various expressions of my sweet girl ’s face so well , and it was such an honest face in its loveliness , that I was sure beforehand she could not hide that first look from me . And I considered whether , if it should signify any one of these meanings , which was so very likely , could I quite answer for myself ? Well , I thought I could . After last night , I thought I could . But to wait and wait , and expect and expect , and think and think , was such bad preparation that I resolved to go along the road again and meet her . So I said to Charley , “
255497	255687	255483	255483	I	0	” Charley highly approving of anything that pleased me , I went and left her at home . But before I got to the second milestone , I had been in so many palpitations from seeing dust in the distance ( though I knew it was not , and could not , be the coach yet ) that I resolved to turn back and go home again . And when I had turned , I was in such fear of the coach coming up behind me ( though I still knew that it neither would , nor could , do any such thing ) that I ran the greater part of the way to avoid being overtaken . Then , I considered , when I had got safe back again , this was a nice thing to have done ! Now I was hot and had made the worst of it instead of the best . At last , when I believed there was at least a quarter of an hour more yet , Charley all at once cried out to me as I was trembling in the garden , “
255698	255738	255695	255695	she	5923	” I did not mean to do it , but I ran upstairs into my room and hid myself behind the door . There I stood trembling , even when I heard my darling calling as she came upstairs , “
255758	256320	255751	255752	Little woman	2039	” She ran in , and was running out again when she saw me . Ah , my angel girl ! The old dear look , all love , all fondness , all affection . Nothing else in it — no , nothing , nothing ! Oh , how happy I was , down upon the floor , with my sweet beautiful girl down upon the floor too , holding my scarred face to her lovely cheek , bathing it with tears and kisses , rocking me to and fro like a child , calling me by every tender name that she could think of , and pressing me to her faithful heart . CHAPTER XXXVII Jarndyce and Jarndyce If the secret I had to keep had been mine , I must have confided it to Ada before we had been long together . But it was not mine , and I did not feel that I had a right to tell it , even to my guardian , unless some great emergency arose . It was a weight to bear alone ; still my present duty appeared to be plain , and blest in the attachment of my dear , I did not want an impulse and encouragement to do it . Though often when she was asleep and all was quiet , the remembrance of my mother kept me waking and made the night sorrowful , I did not yield to it at another time ; and Ada found me what I used to be — except , of course , in that particular of which I have said enough and which I have no intention of mentioning any more just now , if I can help it . The difficulty that I felt in being quite composed that first evening when Ada asked me , over our work , if the family were at the house , and when I was obliged to answer yes , I believed so , for Lady Dedlock had spoken to me in the woods the day before yesterday , was great . Greater still when Ada asked me what she had said , and when I replied that she had been kind and interested , and when Ada , while admitting her beauty and elegance , remarked upon her proud manner and her imperious chilling air . But Charley helped me through , unconsciously , by telling us that Lady Dedlock had only stayed at the house two nights on her way from London to visit at some other great house in the next county and that she had left early on the morning after we had seen her at our view , as we called it . Charley verified the adage about little pitchers , I am sure , for she heard of more sayings and doings in a day than would have come to my ears in a month . We were to stay a month at Mr. Boythorn ’s . My pet had scarcely been there a bright week , as I recollect the time , when one evening after we had finished helping the gardener in watering his flowers , and just as the candles were lighted , Charley , appearing with a very important air behind Ada ’s chair , beckoned me mysteriously out of the room . “
256329	256345	256324	256324	you	5928	” said Charley in a whisper , with her eyes at their roundest and largest . “
256354	256355	256324	256324	you	5928	” “

256550	256564	256547	256548	W. Grubble	597	” which Charley delivered as if she were slowly spelling out the sign . “
256572	256573	256576	256576	miss	9584	” “
256630	256984	256618	256618	they	5951	” said Charley . Not knowing what might be the matter , and being easily apprehensive now , I thought it best to go to this place by myself . I bade Charley be quick with my bonnet and veil and my shawl , and having put them on , went away down the little hilly street , where I was as much at home as in Mr. Boythorn ’s garden . Mr. Grubble was standing in his shirt - sleeves at the door of his very clean little tavern waiting for me . He lifted off his hat with both hands when he saw me coming , and carrying it so , as if it were an iron vessel ( it looked as heavy ) , preceded me along the sanded passage to his best parlour , a neat carpeted room with more plants in it than were quite convenient , a coloured print of Queen Caroline , several shells , a good many tea - trays , two stuffed and dried fish in glass cases , and either a curious egg or a curious pumpkin ( but I do n’t know which , and I doubt if many people did ) hanging from his ceiling . I knew Mr. Grubble very well by sight , from his often standing at his door . A pleasant - looking , stoutish , middle - aged man who never seemed to consider himself cozily dressed for his own fire - side without his hat and top - boots , but who never wore a coat except at church . He snuffed the candle , and backing away a little to see how it looked , backed out of the room — unexpectedly to me , for I was going to ask him by whom he had been sent . The door of the opposite parlour being then opened , I heard some voices , familiar in my ears I thought , which stopped . A quick light step approached the room in which I was , and who should stand before me but Richard ! “
256989	256993	256987	256987	Esther	280	” he said . “
256998	257033	256987	256987	Esther	280	” And he really was so warm - hearted and earnest that in the first surprise and pleasure of his brotherly greeting I could scarcely find breath to tell him that Ada was well . “
257045	257070	256987	256987	Esther	280	” said Richard , leading me to a chair and seating himself beside me . I put my veil up , but not quite . “
257077	257148	257072	257075	the same dear girl	5954	” said Richard just as heartily as before . I put up my veil altogether , and laying my hand on Richard ’s sleeve and looking in his face , told him how much I thanked him for his kind welcome and how greatly I rejoiced to see him , the more so because of the determination I had made in my illness , which I now conveyed to him . “
257152	257156	257072	257075	the same dear girl	5954	” said Richard , “
257181	257182	257176	257176	you	9612	” “
257190	257198	257186	257186	you	0	” said I , shaking my head , “
257205	257206	257184	257184	I	0	” “
257216	257220	257226	257226	him	248	” said Richard , “
257228	257229	257224	257224	you	291	” “
257235	257236	257224	257224	you	291	” “
257285	257301	257282	257283	Mr. Anybody	599	” I was pained to find him taking this tone , and he observed it . “
257309	257313	257282	257283	Mr. Anybody	599	” said Richard , “
257359	257360	257361	257361	My	0	” “
257365	257369	257361	257361	My	0	” I returned , “

257410	257424	257393	257393	you	291	” cried Richard gaily . I asked him how he liked his profession . “
257433	257437	257393	257393	you	291	” said Richard . “
257490	257529	257530	257530	I	0	” So young and handsome , and in all respects so perfectly the opposite of Miss Flite ! And yet , in the clouded , eager , seeking look that passed over him , so dreadfully like her ! “
257539	257543	257530	257530	I	0	” said Richard . “
257546	257547	257530	257530	I	0	” “
257567	257576	257550	257550	I	0	” said Richard , forcing a careless laugh . “
257594	257603	257590	257590	I	0	” No wonder that I shook my head ! “
257615	257628	257605	257605	you	0	” Richard spoke with the same shade crossing his face as before . “
257653	257654	257647	257647	you	0	” “
257664	257665	257657	257658	Mr. Skimpole	323	” “
257686	257772	257680	257684	a fascinating child it is	5974	” I asked Richard if any one knew of their coming down together . He answered , no , nobody . He had been to call upon the dear old infant — so he called Mr. Skimpole — and the dear old infant had told him where we were , and he had told the dear old infant he was bent on coming to see us , and the dear old infant had directly wanted to come too ; and so he had brought him . “
257792	257796	257797	257797	He	5975	” said Richard . “
257815	257968	257969	257969	My	0	” I certainly did not see the proof of Mr. Skimpole ’s worldliness in his having his expenses paid by Richard , but I made no remark about that . Indeed , he came in and turned our conversation . He was charmed to see me , said he had been shedding delicious tears of joy and sympathy at intervals for six weeks on my account , had never been so happy as in hearing of my progress , began to understand the mixture of good and evil in the world now , felt that he appreciated health the more when somebody else was ill , did n’t know but what it might be in the scheme of things that A should squint to make B happier in looking straight or that C should carry a wooden leg to make D better satisfied with his flesh and blood in a silk stocking . “
257980	257985	257978	257978	Richard	291	” said Mr. Skimpole , “
258203	258378	258379	258379	Ada	290	” I began seriously to think that Richard could scarcely have found a worse friend than this . It made me uneasy that at such a time when he most required some right principle and purpose he should have this captivating looseness and putting - off of everything , this airy dispensing with all principle and purpose , at his elbow . I thought I could understand how such a nature as my guardian ’s , experienced in the world and forced to contemplate the miserable evasions and contentions of the family misfortune , found an immense relief in Mr. Skimpole ’s avowal of his weaknesses and display of guileless candour ; but I could not satisfy myself that it was as artless as it seemed or that it did not serve Mr. Skimpole ’s idle turn quite as well as any other part , and with less trouble . They both walked back with me , and Mr. Skimpole leaving us at the gate , I walked softly in with Richard and said , “
258393	258767	258387	258388	a gentleman	11270	” It was not difficult to read the blushing , startled face . She loved him dearly , and he knew it , and I knew it . It was a very transparent business , that meeting as cousins only . I almost mistrusted myself as growing quite wicked in my suspicions , but I was not so sure that Richard loved her dearly . He admired her very much — any one must have done that — and I dare say would have renewed their youthful engagement with great pride and ardour but that he knew how she would respect her promise to my guardian . Still I had a tormenting idea that the influence upon him extended even here , that he was postponing his best truth and earnestness in this as in all things until Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be off his mind . Ah me ! What Richard would have been without that blight , I never shall know now ! He told Ada , in his most ingenuous way , that he had not come to make any secret inroad on the terms she had accepted ( rather too implicitly and confidingly , he thought ) from Mr. Jarndyce , that he had come openly to see her and to see me and to justify himself for the present terms on which he stood with Mr. Jarndyce . As the dear old infant would be with us directly , he begged that I would make an appointment for the morning , when he might set himself right through the means of an unreserved conversation with me . I proposed to walk with him in the park at seven o’clock , and this was arranged . Mr. Skimpole soon afterwards appeared and made us merry for an hour . He particularly requested to see little Coavinses ( meaning Charley ) and told her , with a patriarchal air , that he had given her late father all the business in his power and that if one of her little brothers would make haste to get set up in the same profession , he hoped he should still be able to put a good deal of employment in his way . “
258778	258797	258769	258769	I	0	” said Mr. Skimpole , looking beamingly at us over a glass of wine - and - water , “
258895	259014	258893	258893	him	851	” Richard was a little late in the morning , but I had not to wait for him long , and we turned into the park . The air was bright and dewy and the sky without a cloud . The birds sang delightfully ; the sparkles in the fern , the grass , and trees , were exquisite to see ; the richness of the woods seemed to have increased twenty - fold since yesterday , as if , in the still night when they had looked so massively hushed in sleep , Nature , through all the minute details of every wonderful leaf , had been more wakeful than usual for the glory of that day . “
259021	259028	258893	258893	him	851	” said Richard , looking round . “
259041	259048	259049	259049	I	0	” But there was other trouble . “
259058	259062	259049	259049	I	0	” said Richard , “

259229	259276	259277	259277	My	0	” I could almost have believed in the attraction on which my poor little wandering friend had expatiated when I saw again the darkened look of last night . Terrible to think it had in it also a shade of that unfortunate man who had died . “
259281	259285	259277	259277	My	0	” said I , “

259448	259452	259446	259446	Richard	291	” I remonstrated , “
259505	259536	259537	259537	Esther	280	” He reddened deeply , as if his natural generosity felt a pang of reproach . He was silent for a little while before he replied in a subdued voice , “
259570	259571	259572	259572	I	0	” “
259578	259581	259572	259572	I	0	” said I. “

259916	259961	259962	259962	Esther	280	” I was so touched with pity for Richard that I could not reproach him any more , even by a look . I remembered my guardian ’s gentleness towards his errors and with what perfect freedom from resentment he had spoken of them . “
259964	259968	259962	259962	Esther	280	” Richard resumed , “
260154	260185	260189	260189	him	248	” Poor dear Richard ! He had indeed been thinking about it a good deal . His face , his voice , his manner , all showed that too plainly . “

261071	261093	261069	261069	Ada	290	” I told him that he was more like himself in those latter words than in anything he had said yet . “

261148	261163	261187	261187	his	248	” I asked him if this were all he wished me to tell Ada . “

261541	261547	261537	261537	I	0	” said he , laughing . “

261608	261617	261605	261605	I	0	” said Richard , astonished at my simplicity . “

261696	261705	261689	261689	your	2830	” said Richard , quite amused with me , “
261720	262542	261712	261712	I	0	” I felt so deeply sensible of the danger in which he stood that I tried , in Ada ’s name , in my guardian ’s , in my own , by every fervent means that I could think of , to warn him of it and to show him some of his mistakes . He received everything I said with patience and gentleness , but it all rebounded from him without taking the least effect . I could not wonder at this after the reception his preoccupied mind had given to my guardian ’s letter , but I determined to try Ada ’s influence yet . So when our walk brought us round to the village again , and I went home to breakfast , I prepared Ada for the account I was going to give her and told her exactly what reason we had to dread that Richard was losing himself and scattering his whole life to the winds . It made her very unhappy , of course , though she had a far , far greater reliance on his correcting his errors than I could have — which was so natural and loving in my dear!—and she presently wrote him this little letter : My dearest cousin , Esther has told me all you said to her this morning . I write this to repeat most earnestly for myself all that she said to you and to let you know how sure I am that you will sooner or later find our cousin John a pattern of truth , sincerity , and goodness , when you will deeply , deeply grieve to have done him ( without intending it ) so much wrong . I do not quite know how to write what I wish to say next , but I trust you will understand it as I mean it . I have some fears , my dearest cousin , that it may be partly for my sake you are now laying up so much unhappiness for yourself — and if for yourself , for me . In case this should be so , or in case you should entertain much thought of me in what you are doing , I most earnestly entreat and beg you to desist . You can do nothing for my sake that will make me half so happy as for ever turning your back upon the shadow in which we both were born . Do not be angry with me for saying this . Pray , pray , dear Richard , for my sake , and for your own , and in a natural repugnance for that source of trouble which had its share in making us both orphans when we were very young , pray , pray , let it go for ever . We have reason to know by this time that there is no good in it and no hope , that there is nothing to be got from it but sorrow . My dearest cousin , it is needless for me to say that you are quite free and that it is very likely you may find some one whom you will love much better than your first fancy . I am quite sure , if you will let me say so , that the object of your choice would greatly prefer to follow your fortunes far and wide , however moderate or poor , and see you happy , doing your duty and pursuing your chosen way , than to have the hope of being , or even to be , very rich with you ( if such a thing were possible ) at the cost of dragging years of procrastination and anxiety and of your indifference to other aims . You may wonder at my saying this so confidently with so little knowledge or experience , but I know it for a certainty from my own heart . Ever , my dearest cousin , your most affectionate Ada This note brought Richard to us very soon , but it made little change in him if any . We would fairly try , he said , who was right and who was wrong — he would show us — we should see ! He was animated and glowing , as if Ada ’s tenderness had gratified him ; but I could only hope , with a sigh , that the letter might have some stronger effect upon his mind on re - perusal than it assuredly had then . As they were to remain with us that day and had taken their places to return by the coach next morning , I sought an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Skimpole . Our out - of - door life easily threw one in my way , and I delicately said that there was a responsibility in encouraging Richard . “
262550	262563	262547	262548	Miss Summerson	280	” he repeated , catching at the word with the pleasantest smile . “
262590	262591	262585	262585	I	0	” “
262601	262617	262592	262592	I	0	” said I timidly enough , he being so much older and more clever than I. “
262622	262639	262592	262592	I	0	” said Mr. Skimpole , receiving this new light with a most agreeable jocularity of surprise . “
262665	262679	262662	262663	Miss Summerson	280	” he took a handful of loose silver and halfpence from his pocket , “
262773	262828	262769	262769	I	0	” The perfect ease of manner with which he put the money up again and looked at me with a smile on his refined face , as if he had been mentioning a curious little fact about somebody else , almost made me feel as if he really had nothing to do with it . “
262836	262840	262832	262832	you	6072	” he resumed , “
262928	262970	262906	262906	I	0	” It was difficult , after this , to explain what I meant ; but I persisted so far as to say that we all hoped he would check and not confirm Richard in the sanguine views he entertained just then . “
262974	262978	262980	262980	I	0	” he retorted , “
263054	263065	263067	263067	you	280	” It was very unfortunate for Richard , I said . “
263071	263076	263067	263067	you	280	” returned Mr. Skimpole . “
263325	263520	263310	263310	I	0	” It was idle to say more , so I proposed that we should join Ada and Richard , who were a little in advance , and I gave up Mr. Skimpole in despair . He had been over the Hall in the course of the morning and whimsically described the family pictures as we walked . There were such portentous shepherdesses among the Ladies Dedlock dead and gone , he told us , that peaceful crooks became weapons of assault in their hands . They tended their flocks severely in buckram and powder and put their sticking - plaster patches on to terrify commoners as the chiefs of some other tribes put on their war - paint . There was a Sir Somebody Dedlock , with a battle , a sprung - mine , volumes of smoke , flashes of lightning , a town on fire , and a stormed fort , all in full action between his horse ’s two hind legs , showing , he supposed , how little a Dedlock made of such trifles . The whole race he represented as having evidently been , in life , what he called “
263522	263600	263601	263601	Dear	1110	people”—a large collection , glassy eyed , set up in the most approved manner on their various twigs and perches , very correct , perfectly free from animation , and always in glass cases . I was not so easy now during any reference to the name but that I felt it a relief when Richard , with an exclamation of surprise , hurried away to meet a stranger whom he first descried coming slowly towards us . “
263604	263609	263601	263601	Dear	1110	” said Mr. Skimpole . “
263612	263624	263601	263601	Dear	1110	” We asked if that were a friend of Richard ’s . “
263630	263635	263601	263601	Dear	1110	” said Mr. Skimpole . “
263669	263689	263666	263667	THE man	1619	” We had not known , we said , that Richard was assisted by any gentleman of that name . “
263697	263702	263703	263703	he	245	” returned Mr. Skimpole , “
263734	263735	263728	263728	I	0	” “
263742	263746	263747	263747	Vholes	245	” asked Ada . “
263889	263905	263906	263906	Vholes	245	” he looked inquiringly at us with his frankest smile as he made the discovery , “
263945	264050	264051	264051	I	0	” His further consideration of the point was prevented by Richard ’s coming back to us in an excited state and hastily representing Mr. Vholes — a sallow man with pinched lips that looked as if they were cold , a red eruption here and there upon his face , tall and thin , about fifty years of age , high - shouldered , and stooping . Dressed in black , black - gloved , and buttoned to the chin , there was nothing so remarkable in him as a lifeless manner and a slow , fixed way he had of looking at Richard . “
264061	264082	264083	264083	I	0	” said Mr. Vholes , and now I observed that he was further remarkable for an inward manner of speaking . “
264148	264149	264131	264131	I	0	” “
264152	264166	264131	264131	I	0	” said Richard , flushed , and looking triumphantly at Ada and me , “
264215	264216	264218	264218	you	245	” “
264223	264228	264221	264221	sir	9496	” returned Mr. Vholes . “
264236	264237	264239	264239	me	0	” “
264242	264251	264239	264239	me	0	” said Richard , looking at his watch . “
264316	264348	264309	264310	Mr. Vholes	245	” He was away directly , in his heat and hurry , and was soon lost in the dusk of evening . We who were left walked on towards the house . “
264361	264364	264359	264359	Sir	9496	” said I. “
264371	264372	264359	264359	Sir	9496	” “
264377	264382	264375	264375	miss	9584	” Mr. Vholes replied . “
264391	264411	264383	264383	I	0	” Both Ada and I expressed our regret that he should go , then , only to be disappointed . “
264425	264430	264421	264421	his	245	” said Mr. Vholes , “
264510	264536	264508	264508	miss	9584	” The remark being made to me in consequence of my being next him as we walked , I assented and enumerated its chief attractions . “
264539	264544	264508	264508	miss	9584	” said Mr. Vholes . “
264583	264605	264608	264608	miss	9584	” To keep up the conversation , I asked Mr. Vholes if he would like to live altogether in the country . “
264610	264614	264615	264615	you	9584	” said he , “
264750	264769	264770	264770	You	6125	” It required some attention to hear him on account of his inward speaking and his lifeless manner . “
264779	264783	264770	264770	You	6125	” he said . “
264808	264871	264877	264877	you	6125	” We now arrived at Mr. Boythorn ’s house , where the tea - table , all prepared , was awaiting us . Richard came in restless and hurried shortly afterwards , and leaning over Mr. Vholes ’s chair , whispered something in his ear . Mr. Vholes replied aloud — or as nearly aloud I suppose as he had ever replied to anything—“You
264902	265365	265373	265373	Esther	280	” We understood from what followed that Mr. Skimpole was to be left until the morning to occupy the two places which had been already paid for . As Ada and I were both in low spirits concerning Richard and very sorry so to part with him , we made it as plain as we politely could that we should leave Mr. Skimpole to the Dedlock Arms and retire when the night - travellers were gone . Richard ’s high spirits carrying everything before them , we all went out together to the top of the hill above the village , where he had ordered a gig to wait and where we found a man with a lantern standing at the head of the gaunt pale horse that had been harnessed to it . I never shall forget those two seated side by side in the lantern ’s light , Richard all flush and fire and laughter , with the reins in his hand ; Mr. Vholes quite still , black - gloved , and buttoned up , looking at him as if he were looking at his prey and charming it . I have before me the whole picture of the warm dark night , the summer lightning , the dusty track of road closed in by hedgerows and high trees , the gaunt pale horse with his ears pricked up , and the driving away at speed to Jarndyce and Jarndyce . My dear girl told me that night how Richard ’s being thereafter prosperous or ruined , befriended or deserted , could only make this difference to her , that the more he needed love from one unchanging heart , the more love that unchanging heart would have to give him ; how he thought of her through his present errors , and she would think of him at all times — never of herself if she could devote herself to him , never of her own delights if she could minister to his . And she kept her word ? I look along the road before me , where the distance already shortens and the journey ’s end is growing visible ; and true and good above the dead sea of the Chancery suit and all the ashy fruit it cast ashore , I think I see my darling . CHAPTER XXXVIII A Struggle When our time came for returning to Bleak House again , we were punctual to the day and were received with an overpowering welcome . I was perfectly restored to health and strength , and finding my housekeeping keys laid ready for me in my room , rang myself in as if I had been a new year , with a merry little peal . “
265375	265379	265373	265373	Esther	280	” said I ; “
265419	265795	265409	265409	I	0	” The first few mornings were mornings of so much bustle and business , devoted to such settlements of accounts , such repeated journeys to and fro between the growlery and all other parts of the house , so many rearrangements of drawers and presses , and such a general new beginning altogether , that I had not a moment ’s leisure . But when these arrangements were completed and everything was in order , I paid a visit of a few hours to London , which something in the letter I had destroyed at Chesney Wold had induced me to decide upon in my own mind . I made Caddy Jellyby — her maiden name was so natural to me that I always called her by it — the pretext for this visit and wrote her a note previously asking the favour of her company on a little business expedition . Leaving home very early in the morning , I got to London by stage - coach in such good time that I got to Newman Street with the day before me . Caddy , who had not seen me since her wedding - day , was so glad and so affectionate that I was half inclined to fear I should make her husband jealous . But he was , in his way , just as bad — I mean as good ; and in short it was the old story , and nobody would leave me any possibility of doing anything meritorious . The elder Mr. Turveydrop was in bed , I found , and Caddy was milling his chocolate , which a melancholy little boy who was an apprentice — it seemed such a curious thing to be apprenticed to the trade of dancing — was waiting to carry upstairs . Her father - in - law was extremely kind and considerate , Caddy told me , and they lived most happily together . ( When she spoke of their living together , she meant that the old gentleman had all the good things and all the good lodging , while she and her husband had what they could get , and were poked into two corner rooms over the Mews . ) “
265804	265807	265802	265802	Caddy	300	” said I. “
265817	265821	265815	265815	Esther	280	” replied Caddy , “
265871	265923	265861	265861	she	308	” It struck me that if Mrs. Jellyby had discharged her own natural duties and obligations before she swept the horizon with a telescope in search of others , she would have taken the best precautions against becoming absurd , but I need scarcely observe that I kept this to myself . “
265930	265931	265928	265928	Caddy	300	” “
265938	265942	265932	265932	He	2752	” returned Caddy , “
265962	265999	265932	265932	He	2752	” Looking at the corner , I plainly perceived the mark of Mr. Jellyby ’s head against the wall . It was consolatory to know that he had found such a resting - place for it . “
266005	266009	266001	266001	you	300	” said I , “
266020	266021	266010	266010	you	300	” “
266027	266031	266032	266032	I	0	” returned Caddy , “
266096	266119	266120	266120	Four	607	” The notion of the apprentices was still so odd to me that I asked Caddy if there were many of them . “
266122	266126	266120	266120	Four	607	” said Caddy . “
266192	266193	266179	266179	we	6150	” “
266204	266207	266179	266179	we	6150	” said I. “
266213	266217	266179	266179	we	6150	” said Caddy . “
266259	266260	266251	266251	we	6150	” “
266268	266272	266273	266273	I	0	” I exclaimed . “
266280	266286	266273	266273	I	0	” returned Caddy , smiling , “
266347	266381	266344	266345	the Sweeps	6157	” All this presented the art to me in a singular light , to be sure . Caddy enjoyed the effect of her communication and cheerfully recounted the particulars of her own studies . “
266522	266567	266516	266516	Esther	280	” Saying these words , Caddy laughingly sat down at a little jingling square piano and really rattled off a quadrille with great spirit . Then she good - humouredly and blushingly got up again , and while she still laughed herself , said , “
266582	266657	266578	266580	a dear girl	6019	” I would sooner have cried , but I did neither . I encouraged her and praised her with all my heart . For I conscientiously believed , dancing - master ’s wife though she was , and dancing - mistress though in her limited ambition she aspired to be , she had struck out a natural , wholesome , loving course of industry and perseverance that was quite as good as a mission . “
266661	266667	266668	266668	you	9540	” said Caddy , delighted , “
266736	267302	266700	266700	You	9540	” Her husband , who had left us while we had this chat , now coming back , preparatory to exercising the apprentices in the ball - room , Caddy informed me she was quite at my disposal . But it was not my time yet , I was glad to tell her , for I should have been vexed to take her away then . Therefore we three adjourned to the apprentices together , and I made one in the dance . The apprentices were the queerest little people . Besides the melancholy boy , who , I hoped , had not been made so by waltzing alone in the empty kitchen , there were two other boys and one dirty little limp girl in a gauzy dress . Such a precocious little girl , with such a dowdy bonnet on ( that , too , of a gauzy texture ) , who brought her sandalled shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule . Such mean little boys , when they were not dancing , with string , and marbles , and cramp - bones in their pockets , and the most untidy legs and feet — and heels particularly . I asked Caddy what had made their parents choose this profession for them . Caddy said she did n’t know ; perhaps they were designed for teachers , perhaps for the stage . They were all people in humble circumstances , and the melancholy boy ’s mother kept a ginger - beer shop . We danced for an hour with great gravity , the melancholy child doing wonders with his lower extremities , in which there appeared to be some sense of enjoyment though it never rose above his waist . Caddy , while she was observant of her husband and was evidently founded upon him , had acquired a grace and self - possession of her own , which , united to her pretty face and figure , was uncommonly agreeable . She already relieved him of much of the instruction of these young people , and he seldom interfered except to walk his part in the figure if he had anything to do in it . He always played the tune . The affectation of the gauzy child , and her condescension to the boys , was a sight . And thus we danced an hour by the clock . When the practice was concluded , Caddy ’s husband made himself ready to go out of town to a school , and Caddy ran away to get ready to go out with me . I sat in the ball - room in the interval , contemplating the apprentices . The two out - door boys went upon the staircase to put on their half - boots and pull the in - door boy ’s hair , as I judged from the nature of his objections . Returning with their jackets buttoned and their pumps stuck in them , they then produced packets of cold bread and meat and bivouacked under a painted lyre on the wall . The little gauzy child , having whisked her sandals into the reticule and put on a trodden - down pair of shoes , shook her head into the dowdy bonnet at one shake , and answering my inquiry whether she liked dancing by replying , “
267307	267319	267305	267305	boys	10664	” tied it across her chin , and went home contemptuous . “
267327	267331	267305	267305	boys	10664	” said Caddy , “
267362	267387	267360	267360	Esther	280	” I expressed myself much obliged to him , but did not think it necessary to add that I readily dispensed with this attention . “
267397	267401	267360	267360	Esther	280	” said Caddy , “
267454	267487	267434	267434	He	434	” There was something in the picture of Mr. Turveydrop bestowing his deportment on Mr. Jellyby that quite took my fancy . I asked Caddy if he brought her papa out much . “
267490	267494	267500	267500	he	434	” said Caddy , “
267593	267633	267566	267566	he	309	” That old Mr. Turveydrop should ever , in the chances and changes of life , have come to the rescue of Mr. Jellyby from Borrioboola - Gha appeared to me to be one of the pleasantest of oddities . “
267638	267646	267636	267636	Peepy	302	” said Caddy with a little hesitation , “
267740	267745	267727	267727	he	990	” said Caddy cheerily , “
267771	267772	267769	267769	Esther	280	” “
267779	267783	267769	267769	Esther	280	” said I , “
267840	267841	267831	267838	the gentleman who brought us to your house	6183	” “
267858	268045	267846	267846	I	0	” returned Caddy . To the Old Street Road we went and there inquired at Mrs. Guppy ’s residence for Mrs. Guppy . Mrs. Guppy , occupying the parlours and having indeed been visibly in danger of cracking herself like a nut in the front - parlour door by peeping out before she was asked for , immediately presented herself and requested us to walk in . She was an old lady in a large cap , with rather a red nose and rather an unsteady eye , but smiling all over . Her close little sitting - room was prepared for a visit , and there was a portrait of her son in it which , I had almost written here , was more like than life : it insisted upon him with such obstinacy , and was so determined not to let him off . Not only was the portrait there , but we found the original there too . He was dressed in a great many colours and was discovered at a table reading law - papers with his forefinger to his forehead . “
268049	268056	267846	267846	I	0	” said Mr. Guppy , rising , “
268086	268157	268063	268063	Mother	9526	” Mrs. Guppy , whose incessant smiling gave her quite a waggish appearance , did as her son requested and then sat down in a corner , holding her pocket handkerchief to her chest , like a fomentation , with both hands . I presented Caddy , and Mr. Guppy said that any friend of mine was more than welcome . I then proceeded to the object of my visit . “
268170	268230	268158	268158	I	0	” said I. Mr. Guppy acknowledged the receipt by taking it out of his breast - pocket , putting it to his lips , and returning it to his pocket with a bow . Mr. Guppy ’s mother was so diverted that she rolled her head as she smiled and made a silent appeal to Caddy with her elbow . “
268241	268330	268331	268332	Miss Summerson	280	” said I. Anything like the jocoseness of Mr. Guppy ’s mother just now , I think I never saw . She made no sound of laughter , but she rolled her head , and shook it , and put her handkerchief to her mouth , and appealed to Caddy with her elbow , and her hand , and her shoulder , and was so unspeakably entertained altogether that it was with some difficulty she could marshal Caddy through the little folding - door into her bedroom adjoining . “
268334	268339	268340	268340	you	280	” said Mr. Guppy , “
268372	268404	268356	268357	My mother	2299	” I could hardly have believed that anybody could in a moment have turned so red or changed so much as Mr. Guppy did when I now put up my veil . “
268418	268422	268405	268405	I	0	” said I , “
268461	268489	268458	268459	Mr. Guppy	297	” I caused him embarrassment enough as it was , I am sure . I never saw such faltering , such confusion , such amazement and apprehension . “
268493	268498	268490	268491	Miss Summerson	280	” stammered Mr. Guppy , “
268547	268597	268533	268533	I	0	” Something seemed to rise in his throat that he could not possibly swallow . He put his hand there , coughed , made faces , tried again to swallow it , coughed again , made faces again , looked all round the room , and fluttered his papers . “
268610	268614	268608	268608	miss	9584	” he explained , “
268639	268676	268637	268637	George	500	” I gave him a little time to recover . He consumed it in putting his hand to his forehead and taking it away again , and in backing his chair into the corner behind him . “
268685	268690	268692	268692	me	0	” said Mr. Guppy , “
268755	268756	268747	268747	you	9584	” “
268763	268767	268747	268747	you	9584	” said I , “

268790	268802	268786	268786	you	9584	” he returned , measuring the table with his troubled hands . “

268886	268889	268881	268881	I	0	” said I. “

268937	268940	268929	268929	I	0	” said I. “
268944	268949	268942	268942	you	9584	” returned Mr. Guppy . “
269016	269033	269034	269034	I	0	” Mr. Guppy ’s bronchitis came to his relief and stopped his measurement of the table . “
269047	269051	269040	269040	I	0	” I began . “
269061	269066	269057	269057	I	0	” said Mr. Guppy . “

269171	269175	269165	269165	You	0	” I recommenced , “

269440	269445	269434	269434	I	0	” said Mr. Guppy , “
269536	269574	269576	269576	you	0	” I must say for Mr. Guppy that the snuffling manner he had had upon him improved very much . He seemed truly glad to be able to do something I asked , and he looked ashamed . “
269599	269610	269611	269611	you	0	” I went on , seeing him about to speak , “
269724	269761	269712	269712	you	0	” I must do Mr. Guppy the further justice of saying that he had looked more and more ashamed and that he looked most ashamed and very earnest when he now replied with a burning face , “
269836	269853	269854	269854	I	0	” continued Mr. Guppy rapidly , as if he were repeating a familiar form of words , “
269871	269872	269873	269873	I	0	” “
269878	269887	269873	269873	I	0	” said I , rising at this point , “
269904	269995	269895	269895	Caddy	300	” Mr. Guppy ’s mother returned with Caddy ( now making me the recipient of her silent laughter and her nudges ) , and we took our leave . Mr. Guppy saw us to the door with the air of one who was either imperfectly awake or walking in his sleep ; and we left him there , staring . But in a minute he came after us down the street without any hat , and with his long hair all blown about , and stopped us , saying fervently , “
270011	270012	270013	270013	I	0	” “
270016	270020	270013	270013	I	0	” said I , “

270146	270150	270152	270153	this gentleman	3062	” said I , “
270155	270156	270157	270158	William Guppy	297	” “
270172	270176	270178	270179	this gentleman	3062	” he murmured . “
270200	270201	270198	270198	myself	0	” “
270207	270212	270205	270205	miss	9584	” said Mr. Guppy . “
270230	270235	270236	270237	Married woman	10775	” I gave them . “
270242	270247	270248	270249	Married woman	10775	” said Mr. Guppy . “
270287	270297	270252	270252	you	9540	” He ran home and came running back again . “
270341	270351	270362	270362	you	9540	” said Mr. Guppy to me forlornly and despondently , “
270372	270404	270365	270365	I	0	” I replied it certainly could not . The subject did not admit of a doubt . He thanked me and ran to his mother ’s again — and back again . “
270418	270423	270412	270412	miss	9584	” said Mr. Guppy . “
270458	271166	270442	270442	you	9540	” The struggle in Mr. Guppy ’s breast and the numerous oscillations it occasioned him between his mother ’s door and us were sufficiently conspicuous in the windy street ( particularly as his hair wanted cutting ) to make us hurry away . I did so with a lightened heart ; but when we last looked back , Mr. Guppy was still oscillating in the same troubled state of mind . CHAPTER XXXIX Attorney and Client The name of Mr. Vholes , preceded by the legend Ground - Floor , is inscribed upon a door - post in Symond ’s Inn , Chancery Lane — a little , pale , wall - eyed , woebegone inn like a large dust - binn of two compartments and a sifter . It looks as if Symond were a sparing man in his way and constructed his inn of old building materials which took kindly to the dry rot and to dirt and all things decaying and dismal , and perpetuated Symond ’s memory with congenial shabbiness . Quartered in this dingy hatchment commemorative of Symond are the legal bearings of Mr. Vholes . Mr. Vholes ’s office , in disposition retiring and in situation retired , is squeezed up in a corner and blinks at a dead wall . Three feet of knotty - floored dark passage bring the client to Mr. Vholes ’s jet - black door , in an angle profoundly dark on the brightest midsummer morning and encumbered by a black bulk - head of cellarage staircase against which belated civilians generally strike their brows . Mr. Vholes ’s chambers are on so small a scale that one clerk can open the door without getting off his stool , while the other who elbows him at the same desk has equal facilities for poking the fire . A smell as of unwholesome sheep blending with the smell of must and dust is referable to the nightly ( and often daily ) consumption of mutton fat in candles and to the fretting of parchment forms and skins in greasy drawers . The atmosphere is otherwise stale and close . The place was last painted or whitewashed beyond the memory of man , and the two chimneys smoke , and there is a loose outer surface of soot everywhere , and the dull cracked windows in their heavy frames have but one piece of character in them , which is a determination to be always dirty and always shut unless coerced . This accounts for the phenomenon of the weaker of the two usually having a bundle of firewood thrust between its jaws in hot weather . Mr. Vholes is a very respectable man . He has not a large business , but he is a very respectable man . He is allowed by the greater attorneys who have made good fortunes or are making them to be a most respectable man . He never misses a chance in his practice , which is a mark of respectability . He never takes any pleasure , which is another mark of respectability . He is reserved and serious , which is another mark of respectability . His digestion is impaired , which is highly respectable . And he is making hay of the grass which is flesh , for his three daughters . And his father is dependent on him in the Vale of Taunton . The one great principle of the English law is to make business for itself . There is no other principle distinctly , certainly , and consistently maintained through all its narrow turnings . Viewed by this light it becomes a coherent scheme and not the monstrous maze the laity are apt to think it . Let them but once clearly perceive that its grand principle is to make business for itself at their expense , and surely they will cease to grumble . But not perceiving this quite plainly — only seeing it by halves in a confused way — the laity sometimes suffer in peace and pocket , with a bad grace , and DO grumble very much . Then this respectability of Mr. Vholes is brought into powerful play against them . “
271175	271184	270442	270442	you	9540	” says Mr. Kenge to a smarting client . “
271341	271371	271338	271339	Mr. Vholes	245	” The respectability of Mr. Vholes has even been cited with crushing effect before Parliamentary committees , as in the following blue minutes of a distinguished attorney ’s evidence . “
271520	271528	271530	271530	Vholes	245	Answer:”—which proved fatal to the inquiry for ten years—“Mr
271543	271803	271530	271530	Vholes	245	” So in familiar conversation , private authorities no less disinterested will remark that they do n’t know what this age is coming to , that we are plunging down precipices , that now here is something else gone , that these changes are death to people like Vholes — a man of undoubted respectability , with a father in the Vale of Taunton , and three daughters at home . Take a few steps more in this direction , say they , and what is to become of Vholes ’s father ? Is he to perish ? And of Vholes ’s daughters ? Are they to be shirt - makers , or governesses ? As though , Mr. Vholes and his relations being minor cannibal chiefs and it being proposed to abolish cannibalism , indignant champions were to put the case thus : Make man - eating unlawful , and you starve the Vholeses ! In a word , Mr. Vholes , with his three daughters and his father in the Vale of Taunton , is continually doing duty , like a piece of timber , to shore up some decayed foundation that has become a pitfall and a nuisance . And with a great many people in a great many instances , the question is never one of a change from wrong to right ( which is quite an extraneous consideration ) , but is always one of injury or advantage to that eminently respectable legion , Vholes . The Chancellor is , within these ten minutes , “
271805	271955	271530	271530	Vholes	245	” for the long vacation . Mr. Vholes , and his young client , and several blue bags hastily stuffed out of all regularity of form , as the larger sort of serpents are in their first gorged state , have returned to the official den . Mr. Vholes , quiet and unmoved , as a man of so much respectability ought to be , takes off his close black gloves as if he were skinning his hands , lifts off his tight hat as if he were scalping himself , and sits down at his desk . The client throws his hat and gloves upon the ground — tosses them anywhere , without looking after them or caring where they go ; flings himself into a chair , half sighing and half groaning ; rests his aching head upon his hand and looks the portrait of young despair . “
271960	271964	271530	271530	Vholes	245	” says Richard . “
271970	271971	271530	271530	Vholes	245	” “
271980	271986	271978	271978	sir	9496	” returns the placid Vholes . “
271997	271998	271978	271978	sir	9496	” “
272005	272014	271978	271978	sir	9496	” says Richard , turning gloomily upon him . “
272023	272027	271978	271978	sir	9496	” returns Vholes , “
272042	272043	271978	271978	sir	9496	” “
272049	272101	272108	272108	sir	9496	” asks the moody client . Vholes , sitting with his arms on the desk , quietly bringing the tips of his five right fingers to meet the tips of his five left fingers , and quietly separating them again , and fixedly and slowly looking at his client , replies , “
272129	272130	272119	272120	Mr. Carstone	291	” “
272152	272168	272169	272170	Mr. C.	614	” exclaims the young man , rising from his chair and walking about the room . “
272172	272186	272169	272170	Mr. C.	614	” returns Vholes , following him close with his eyes wherever he goes , “
272239	272240	272241	272241	I	0	” “
272253	272278	272250	272251	Mr. Vholes	245	” says Richard , sitting down again with an impatient laugh and beating the devil ’s tattoo with his boot on the patternless carpet . “
272281	272311	272279	272279	Sir	9496	” returns Vholes , always looking at the client as if he were making a lingering meal of him with his eyes as well as with his professional appetite . “
272314	272328	272312	272312	Sir	9496	” returns Vholes with his inward manner of speech and his bloodless quietude , “
272431	272432	272433	272434	Mr. Vholes	245	” “
272436	272444	272433	272434	Mr. Vholes	245	” explains the client , somewhat abashed , “
272455	272456	272457	272457	I	0	” “
272468	272474	272459	272459	you	245	” returns the equable Vholes . “
272635	272693	272702	272702	you	9496	” Mr. Vholes , after glancing at the official cat who is patiently watching a mouse ’s hole , fixes his charmed gaze again on his young client and proceeds in his buttoned - up , half - audible voice as if there were an unclean spirit in him that will neither come out nor speak out , “
272855	272894	272853	272853	sir	9496	” Mr. Vholes gives it a rap , and it sounds as hollow as a coffin . Not to Richard , though . There is encouragement in the sound to him . Perhaps Mr. Vholes knows there is . “
272903	272914	272895	272895	I	0	” says Richard , more familiarly and good - humouredly , “
273016	273017	273018	273018	You	0	” “
273021	273026	273018	273018	You	0	” says Mr. Vholes , “
273121	273122	273108	273108	I	0	” “
273125	273131	273108	273108	I	0	” returns Richard , brightening . “
273140	273141	273135	273135	you	0	” “
273150	273151	273152	273152	You	0	” “
273160	273161	273152	273152	You	0	” “
273166	273197	273152	273152	You	0	” says Mr. Vholes , gently shaking his head and rapping the hollow desk , with a sound as if ashes were falling on ashes , and dust on dust , “
273286	273302	273303	273304	Mr. Vholes	245	” Richard , his face flushing suddenly , strikes the desk with his clenched hand . “
273440	273441	273474	273474	I	0	” “
273446	273450	273474	273474	I	0	” says Vholes . “
273478	273479	273474	273474	I	0	” “
273483	273489	273480	273481	Mr. Vholes	245	” returns the angry client . “
273507	273508	273497	273497	he	248	” “
273516	273526	273509	273509	He	248	” Mr. Vholes admits with an appearance of reluctance . “
273557	273558	273559	273559	You	245	” “
273562	273566	273567	273567	I	0	” returns Richard . “
273572	273573	273579	273579	his	248	” “
273597	273615	273593	273593	me	0	” says Richard , accompanying his last three words with three raps on his rock of trust . “
273619	273633	273616	273617	Mr. C.	614	” returns Vholes , immovable in attitude and never winking his hungry eyes , “
273749	273750	273746	273747	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” “
273757	273761	273746	273747	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” cries Richard . “
273769	273770	273762	273762	You	614	” “
273774	273778	273771	273772	Mr. C.	614	” returns Vholes , “
274082	274094	274075	274075	I	0	” says Mr. Vholes with the severity of a determined man , “
274214	274259	274171	274172	Mr. C.	614	” Vholes finally adds , by way of rider to this declaration of his principles , that as Mr. Carstone is about to rejoin his regiment , perhaps Mr. C. will favour him with an order on his agent for twenty pounds on account . “
274274	274286	274272	274272	sir	9496	” observes Vholes , turning over the leaves of his diary , “
274386	274396	274366	274367	Mr. C.	614	” Vholes gives the desk one hollow blow again , “
274408	274512	274366	274367	Mr. C.	614	” The client , with his dejection insensibly relieved and his vague hopes rekindled , takes pen and ink and writes the draft , not without perplexed consideration and calculation of the date it may bear , implying scant effects in the agent ’s hands . All the while , Vholes , buttoned up in body and mind , looks at him attentively . All the while , Vholes ’s official cat watches the mouse ’s hole . Lastly , the client , shaking hands , beseeches Mr. Vholes , for heaven ’s sake and earth ’s sake , to do his utmost to “
274516	274544	274366	274367	Mr. C.	614	” the Court of Chancery . Mr. Vholes , who never gives hopes , lays his palm upon the client ’s shoulder and answers with a smile , “
274572	275159	275160	275160	William	297	” Thus they part , and Vholes , left alone , employs himself in carrying sundry little matters out of his diary into his draft bill book for the ultimate behoof of his three daughters . So might an industrious fox or bear make up his account of chickens or stray travellers with an eye to his cubs , not to disparage by that word the three raw - visaged , lank , and buttoned - up maidens who dwell with the parent Vholes in an earthy cottage situated in a damp garden at Kennington . Richard , emerging from the heavy shade of Symond ’s Inn into the sunshine of Chancery Lane — for there happens to be sunshine there to - day — walks thoughtfully on , and turns into Lincoln ’s Inn , and passes under the shadow of the Lincoln ’s Inn trees . On many such loungers have the speckled shadows of those trees often fallen ; on the like bent head , the bitten nail , the lowering eye , the lingering step , the purposeless and dreamy air , the good consuming and consumed , the life turned sour . This lounger is not shabby yet , but that may come . Chancery , which knows no wisdom but in precedent , is very rich in such precedents ; and why should one be different from ten thousand ? Yet the time is so short since his depreciation began that as he saunters away , reluctant to leave the spot for some long months together , though he hates it , Richard himself may feel his own case as if it were a startling one . While his heart is heavy with corroding care , suspense , distrust , and doubt , it may have room for some sorrowful wonder when he recalls how different his first visit there , how different he , how different all the colours of his mind . But injustice breeds injustice ; the fighting with shadows and being defeated by them necessitates the setting up of substances to combat ; from the impalpable suit which no man alive can understand , the time for that being long gone by , it has become a gloomy relief to turn to the palpable figure of the friend who would have saved him from this ruin and make HIM his enemy . Richard has told Vholes the truth . Is he in a hardened or a softened mood , he still lays his injuries equally at that door ; he was thwarted , in that quarter , of a set purpose , and that purpose could only originate in the one subject that is resolving his existence into itself ; besides , it is a justification to him in his own eyes to have an embodied antagonist and oppressor . Is Richard a monster in all this , or would Chancery be found rich in such precedents too if they could be got for citation from the Recording Angel ? Two pairs of eyes not unused to such people look after him , as , biting his nails and brooding , he crosses the square and is swallowed up by the shadow of the southern gateway . Mr. Guppy and Mr. Weevle are the possessors of those eyes , and they have been leaning in conversation against the low stone parapet under the trees . He passes close by them , seeing nothing but the ground . “
275162	275171	275160	275160	William	297	” says Mr. Weevle , adjusting his whiskers , “
275195	275196	275205	275205	He	6319	” “
275199	275204	275205	275205	He	6319	” says Mr. Guppy . “
275276	275297	275298	275298	They	6324	” Mr. Guppy , refolding his arms , resettles himself against the parapet , as resuming a conversation of interest . “
275307	275312	275298	275298	They	6324	” says Mr. Guppy , “
275343	275344	275334	275334	they	6324	” “
275350	275351	275352	275352	Small	477	” “
275442	275443	275444	275444	You	0	” “
275452	275453	275454	275454	Tony	489	” “
275456	275465	275454	275454	Tony	489	” says Mr. Guppy , a little disconcerted , “
275513	275520	275493	275493	I	0	Tony”—Mr . Guppy becomes mysteriously and tenderly eloquent—“it
275697	275713	275714	275714	Tony	489	” Mr. Weevle reflects for some time . Shakes his head . Decidedly thinks not . “
275716	275727	275714	275714	Tony	489	” says Mr. Guppy as they walk towards the court , “
275850	276213	276255	276255	We	6340	” Mr. Weevle nods . Mr. Guppy , much elevated in his own opinion by having delivered these observations , with an air in part forensic and in part romantic — this gentleman having a passion for conducting anything in the form of an examination , or delivering anything in the form of a summing up or a speech — accompanies his friend with dignity to the court . Never since it has been a court has it had such a Fortunatus ’ purse of gossip as in the proceedings at the rag and bottle shop . Regularly , every morning at eight , is the elder Mr. Smallweed brought down to the corner and carried in , accompanied by Mrs. Smallweed , Judy , and Bart ; and regularly , all day , do they all remain there until nine at night , solaced by gipsy dinners , not abundant in quantity , from the cook ’s shop , rummaging and searching , digging , delving , and diving among the treasures of the late lamented . What those treasures are they keep so secret that the court is maddened . In its delirium it imagines guineas pouring out of tea - pots , crown - pieces overflowing punch - bowls , old chairs and mattresses stuffed with Bank of England notes . It possesses itself of the sixpenny history ( with highly coloured folding frontispiece ) of Mr. Daniel Dancer and his sister , and also of Mr. Elwes , of Suffolk , and transfers all the facts from those authentic narratives to Mr. Krook . Twice when the dustman is called in to carry off a cartload of old paper , ashes , and broken bottles , the whole court assembles and pries into the baskets as they come forth . Many times the two gentlemen who write with the ravenous little pens on the tissue - paper are seen prowling in the neighbourhood — shy of each other , their late partnership being dissolved . The Sol skilfully carries a vein of the prevailing interest through the Harmonic nights . Little Swills , in what are professionally known as “
276215	276231	276255	276255	We	6340	” allusions to the subject , is received with loud applause ; and the same vocalist “
276233	276254	276255	276255	We	6340	” in the regular business like a man inspired . Even Miss M. Melvilleson , in the revived Caledonian melody of “
276261	276266	276255	276255	We	6340	” points the sentiment that “
276271	276641	276255	276255	We	6340	” ( whatever the nature of that refreshment may be ) with such archness and such a turn of the head towards next door that she is immediately understood to mean Mr. Smallweed loves to find money , and is nightly honoured with a double encore . For all this , the court discovers nothing ; and as Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins now communicate to the late lodger whose appearance is the signal for a general rally , it is in one continual ferment to discover everything , and more . Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy , with every eye in the court ’s head upon them , knock at the closed door of the late lamented ’s house , in a high state of popularity . But being contrary to the court ’s expectation admitted , they immediately become unpopular and are considered to mean no good . The shutters are more or less closed all over the house , and the ground - floor is sufficiently dark to require candles . Introduced into the back shop by Mr. Smallweed the younger , they , fresh from the sunlight , can at first see nothing save darkness and shadows ; but they gradually discern the elder Mr. Smallweed seated in his chair upon the brink of a well or grave of waste - paper , the virtuous Judy groping therein like a female sexton , and Mrs. Smallweed on the level ground in the vicinity snowed up in a heap of paper fragments , print , and manuscript which would appear to be the accumulated compliments that have been sent flying at her in the course of the day . The whole party , Small included , are blackened with dust and dirt and present a fiendish appearance not relieved by the general aspect of the room . There is more litter and lumber in it than of old , and it is dirtier if possible ; likewise , it is ghostly with traces of its dead inhabitant and even with his chalked writing on the wall . On the entrance of visitors , Mr. Smallweed and Judy simultaneously fold their arms and stop in their researches . “
276644	276650	276255	276255	We	6340	” croaks the old gentleman . “
276730	276795	276800	276800	sir	9496	” Mr. Weevle , thanking him , casts an eye about . Mr. Guppy ’s eye follows Mr. Weevle ’s eye . Mr. Weevle ’s eye comes back without any new intelligence in it . Mr. Guppy ’s eye comes back and meets Mr. Smallweed ’s eye . That engaging old gentleman is still murmuring , like some wound - up instrument running down , “
276807	276839	276840	276840	Gentleman	5427	” And then having run down , he lapses into grinning silence , as Mr. Guppy starts at seeing Mr. Tulkinghorn standing in the darkness opposite with his hands behind him . “
276850	276855	276840	276840	Gentleman	5427	” says Grandfather Smallweed . “
276876	276926	276871	276871	he	6352	” Mr. Guppy , slightly nudging his friend to take another look , makes a shuffling bow to Mr. Tulkinghorn , who returns it with an easy nod . Mr. Tulkinghorn is looking on as if he had nothing else to do and were rather amused by the novelty . “
276940	276948	276934	276934	sir	9496	” Mr. Guppy observes to Mr. Smallweed . “
277004	277035	276994	276994	we	6356	” Mr. Smallweed has run down again , while Mr. Weevle ’s eye , attended by Mr. Guppy ’s eye , has again gone round the room and come back . “
277040	277045	277038	277038	sir	9496	” says Mr. Weevle . “
277061	277062	277053	277053	you	9496	” “
277082	277176	277077	277077	yourself	5098	” As they go upstairs , Mr. Guppy lifts his eyebrows inquiringly and looks at Tony . Tony shakes his head . They find the old room very dull and dismal , with the ashes of the fire that was burning on that memorable night yet in the discoloured grate . They have a great disinclination to touch any object , and carefully blow the dust from it first . Nor are they desirous to prolong their visit , packing the few movables with all possible speed and never speaking above a whisper . “
277180	277186	277077	277077	yourself	5098	” says Tony , recoiling . “
277195	277203	277204	277204	Small	477	” Mr. Guppy retreats behind a chair . “
277289	277356	277357	277358	Mr. Guppy	297	” Lady Jane , in the doorway , with her tiger snarl from ear to ear and her club of a tail , shows no intention of obeying ; but Mr. Tulkinghorn stumbling over her , she spits at his rusty legs , and swearing wrathfully , takes her arched back upstairs . Possibly to roam the house - tops again and return by the chimney . “
277360	277365	277357	277358	Mr. Guppy	297	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “
277374	277404	277405	277405	Sir	9496	” Mr. Guppy is engaged in collecting the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty from the wall and depositing those works of art in their old ignoble band - box . “
277407	277413	277405	277405	Sir	9496	” he returns , reddening , “
277487	277488	277464	277464	I	0	” “
277493	277498	277501	277501	sir	9496	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
277522	277523	277567	277568	Mr. Guppy	297	” “
277530	277546	277567	277568	Mr. Guppy	297	” Mr. Tulkinghorn is as imperturbable as the hearthstone to which he has quietly walked . “
277570	277589	277567	277568	Mr. Guppy	297	” He pauses here to smile , and his smile is as dull and rusty as his pantaloons . “
277608	277609	277606	277606	sir	9496	” “
277622	277623	277617	277617	I	0	” “
277660	277691	277654	277654	their	6377	” Mr. Guppy , looking as if he would give his own reddening and still reddening ears to be one of those people at present instead of himself , replies , “
277766	277767	277760	277760	I	0	” “
277772	277773	277760	277760	I	0	” “
277783	277784	277760	277760	I	0	” “
277788	277797	277760	277760	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn with a calm nod . “
277819	277834	277817	277817	sir	9496	” He addresses this to the astounded Tony , who admits the soft impeachment . “
277844	277877	277817	277817	sir	9496	” observes Mr. Tulkinghorn . He has been standing on the hearthstone with his back to the smoked chimney - piece , and now turns round with his glasses to his eyes . “
277914	277949	277950	277950	Tony	489	” When he has walked out , Mr. Guppy , in a great perspiration , nerves himself to the hasty completion of the taking down of the Galaxy Gallery , concluding with Lady Dedlock . “
277952	277961	277950	277950	Tony	489	” he says hurriedly to his astonished companion , “
278123	279563	279564	279564	She	6394	” This charge Mr. Guppy delivers in a state little short of forensic lunacy , while his friend shows a dazed mind in his whole head of hair and even in his cultivated whiskers . CHAPTER XL National and Domestic England has been in a dreadful state for some weeks . Lord Coodle would go out , Sir Thomas Doodle would n’t come in , and there being nobody in Great Britain ( to speak of ) except Coodle and Doodle , there has been no government . It is a mercy that the hostile meeting between those two great men , which at one time seemed inevitable , did not come off , because if both pistols had taken effect , and Coodle and Doodle had killed each other , it is to be presumed that England must have waited to be governed until young Coodle and young Doodle , now in frocks and long stockings , were grown up . This stupendous national calamity , however , was averted by Lord Coodle ’s making the timely discovery that if in the heat of debate he had said that he scorned and despised the whole ignoble career of Sir Thomas Doodle , he had merely meant to say that party differences should never induce him to withhold from it the tribute of his warmest admiration ; while it as opportunely turned out , on the other hand , that Sir Thomas Doodle had in his own bosom expressly booked Lord Coodle to go down to posterity as the mirror of virtue and honour . Still England has been some weeks in the dismal strait of having no pilot ( as was well observed by Sir Leicester Dedlock ) to weather the storm ; and the marvellous part of the matter is that England has not appeared to care very much about it , but has gone on eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage as the old world did in the days before the flood . But Coodle knew the danger , and Doodle knew the danger , and all their followers and hangers - on had the clearest possible perception of the danger . At last Sir Thomas Doodle has not only condescended to come in , but has done it handsomely , bringing in with him all his nephews , all his male cousins , and all his brothers - in - law . So there is hope for the old ship yet . Doodle has found that he must throw himself upon the country , chiefly in the form of sovereigns and beer . In this metamorphosed state he is available in a good many places simultaneously and can throw himself upon a considerable portion of the country at one time . Britannia being much occupied in pocketing Doodle in the form of sovereigns , and swallowing Doodle in the form of beer , and in swearing herself black in the face that she does neither — plainly to the advancement of her glory and morality — the London season comes to a sudden end , through all the Doodleites and Coodleites dispersing to assist Britannia in those religious exercises . Hence Mrs. Rouncewell , housekeeper at Chesney Wold , foresees , though no instructions have yet come down , that the family may shortly be expected , together with a pretty large accession of cousins and others who can in any way assist the great Constitutional work . And hence the stately old dame , taking Time by the forelock , leads him up and down the staircases , and along the galleries and passages , and through the rooms , to witness before he grows any older that everything is ready , that floors are rubbed bright , carpets spread , curtains shaken out , beds puffed and patted , still - room and kitchen cleared for action — all things prepared as beseems the Dedlock dignity . This present summer evening , as the sun goes down , the preparations are complete . Dreary and solemn the old house looks , with so many appliances of habitation and with no inhabitants except the pictured forms upon the walls . So did these come and go , a Dedlock in possession might have ruminated passing along ; so did they see this gallery hushed and quiet , as I see it now ; so think , as I think , of the gap that they would make in this domain when they were gone ; so find it , as I find it , difficult to believe that it could be without them ; so pass from my world , as I pass from theirs , now closing the reverberating door ; so leave no blank to miss them , and so die . Through some of the fiery windows beautiful from without , and set , at this sunset hour , not in dull - grey stone but in a glorious house of gold , the light excluded at other windows pours in rich , lavish , overflowing like the summer plenty in the land . Then do the frozen Dedlocks thaw . Strange movements come upon their features as the shadows of leaves play there . A dense justice in a corner is beguiled into a wink . A staring baronet , with a truncheon , gets a dimple in his chin . Down into the bosom of a stony shepherdess there steals a fleck of light and warmth that would have done it good a hundred years ago . One ancestress of Volumnia , in high - heeled shoes , very like her — casting the shadow of that virgin event before her full two centuries — shoots out into a halo and becomes a saint . A maid of honour of the court of Charles the Second , with large round eyes ( and other charms to correspond ) , seems to bathe in glowing water , and it ripples as it glows . But the fire of the sun is dying . Even now the floor is dusky , and shadow slowly mounts the walls , bringing the Dedlocks down like age and death . And now , upon my Lady ’s picture over the great chimney - piece , a weird shade falls from some old tree , that turns it pale , and flutters it , and looks as if a great arm held a veil or hood , watching an opportunity to draw it over her . Higher and darker rises shadow on the wall — now a red gloom on the ceiling — now the fire is out . All that prospect , which from the terrace looked so near , has moved solemnly away and changed — not the first nor the last of beautiful things that look so near and will so change — into a distant phantom . Light mists arise , and the dew falls , and all the sweet scents in the garden are heavy in the air . Now the woods settle into great masses as if they were each one profound tree . And now the moon rises to separate them , and to glimmer here and there in horizontal lines behind their stems , and to make the avenue a pavement of light among high cathedral arches fantastically broken . Now the moon is high ; and the great house , needing habitation more than ever , is like a body without life . Now it is even awful , stealing through it , to think of the live people who have slept in the solitary bedrooms , to say nothing of the dead . Now is the time for shadow , when every corner is a cavern and every downward step a pit , when the stained glass is reflected in pale and faded hues upon the floors , when anything and everything can be made of the heavy staircase beams excepting their own proper shapes , when the armour has dull lights upon it not easily to be distinguished from stealthy movement , and when barred helmets are frightfully suggestive of heads inside . But of all the shadows in Chesney Wold , the shadow in the long drawing - room upon my Lady ’s picture is the first to come , the last to be disturbed . At this hour and by this light it changes into threatening hands raised up and menacing the handsome face with every breath that stirs . “
279571	279583	279564	279564	She	6394	” says a groom in Mrs. Rouncewell ’s audience - chamber . “
279594	279595	279564	279564	She	6394	” “
279655	279656	279635	279636	My Lady	958	” “
279662	279670	279660	279660	Thomas	400	” rejoins the housekeeper with proud complacency , “
279690	280219	279660	279660	Thomas	400	” Thomas may have his own personal opinions on this subject , probably hints them in his manner of smoothing his sleek head from the nape of his neck to his temples , but he forbears to express them further and retires to the servants ’ hall to regale on cold meat - pie and ale . This groom is the pilot - fish before the nobler shark . Next evening , down come Sir Leicester and my Lady with their largest retinue , and down come the cousins and others from all the points of the compass . Thenceforth for some weeks backward and forward rush mysterious men with no names , who fly about all those particular parts of the country on which Doodle is at present throwing himself in an auriferous and malty shower , but who are merely persons of a restless disposition and never do anything anywhere . On these national occasions Sir Leicester finds the cousins useful . A better man than the Honourable Bob Stables to meet the Hunt at dinner , there could not possibly be . Better got up gentlemen than the other cousins to ride over to polling - booths and hustings here and there , and show themselves on the side of England , it would be hard to find . Volumnia is a little dim , but she is of the true descent ; and there are many who appreciate her sprightly conversation , her French conundrums so old as to have become in the cycles of time almost new again , the honour of taking the fair Dedlock in to dinner , or even the privilege of her hand in the dance . On these national occasions dancing may be a patriotic service , and Volumnia is constantly seen hopping about for the good of an ungrateful and unpensioning country . My Lady takes no great pains to entertain the numerous guests , and being still unwell , rarely appears until late in the day . But at all the dismal dinners , leaden lunches , basilisk balls , and other melancholy pageants , her mere appearance is a relief . As to Sir Leicester , he conceives it utterly impossible that anything can be wanting , in any direction , by any one who has the good fortune to be received under that roof ; and in a state of sublime satisfaction , he moves among the company , a magnificent refrigerator . Daily the cousins trot through dust and canter over roadside turf , away to hustings and polling - booths ( with leather gloves and hunting - whips for the counties and kid gloves and riding - canes for the boroughs ) , and daily bring back reports on which Sir Leicester holds forth after dinner . Daily the restless men who have no occupation in life present the appearance of being rather busy . Daily Volumnia has a little cousinly talk with Sir Leicester on the state of the nation , from which Sir Leicester is disposed to conclude that Volumnia is a more reflecting woman than he had thought her . “
280226	280235	279660	279660	Thomas	400	” says Miss Volumnia , clasping her hands . “
280240	280289	280290	280290	Volumnia	552	” The mighty business is nearly over by this time , and Doodle will throw himself off the country in a few days more . Sir Leicester has just appeared in the long drawing - room after dinner , a bright particular star surrounded by clouds of cousins . “
280292	280305	280290	280290	Volumnia	552	” replies Sir Leicester , who has a list in his hand , “
280311	280312	280306	280306	we	6406	” “
280316	280381	280382	280382	Volumnia	552	” Although it is summer weather , Sir Leicester always has his own particular fire in the evening . He takes his usual screened seat near it and repeats with much firmness and a little displeasure , as who should say , I am not a common man , and when I say tolerably , it must not be understood as a common expression , “
280389	280390	280382	280382	Volumnia	552	” “
280400	280406	280409	280409	Volumnia	552	” Volumnia asserts with confidence . “
280429	280430	280422	280422	I	0	” “
280446	280474	280475	280477	A sensible woman	6408	” Volumnia ’s finishing the sentence restores her to favour . Sir Leicester , with a gracious inclination of his head , seems to say to himself , “
280488	280559	280560	280560	You	552	” In fact , as to this question of opposition , the fair Dedlock ’s observation was superfluous , Sir Leicester on these occasions always delivering in his own candidateship , as a kind of handsome wholesale order to be promptly executed . Two other little seats that belong to him he treats as retail orders of less importance , merely sending down the men and signifying to the tradespeople , “
280582	280583	280584	280584	I	0	” “
280621	280622	280623	280627	W - r - retches	6413	” “
280629	280633	280623	280627	W - r - retches	6413	” says Volumnia . “
280636	280651	280623	280627	W - r - retches	6413	” proceeds Sir Leicester , glancing at the circumjacent cousins on sofas and ottomans , “
280676	280709	280623	280627	W - r - retches	6413	” ( Note , by the way , that the Coodleites are always a faction with the Doodleites , and that the Doodleites occupy exactly the same position towards the Coodleites . ) “
280746	280761	280744	280744	Hundreds	624	” says Sir Leicester , eyeing the cousins with increasing dignity and swelling indignation , “
280768	280822	280744	280744	Hundreds	624	” If Volumnia have a fault , it is the fault of being a trifle too innocent , seeing that the innocence which would go extremely well with a sash and tucker is a little out of keeping with the rouge and pearl necklace . Howbeit , impelled by innocence , she asks , “
280826	280827	280828	280828	Volumnia	552	” “
280830	280839	280840	280840	Volumnia	552	” remonstrates Sir Leicester with his utmost severity . “
280842	280843	280840	280840	Volumnia	552	” “
280855	280864	280848	280848	I	0	” cries Volumnia with her favourite little scream . “
280876	280877	280870	280870	I	0	” “
280882	280887	280889	280889	you	0	” returns Sir Leicester , “
280896	280920	280889	280889	you	0	” Volumnia hastens to express her opinion that the shocking people ought to be tried as traitors and made to support the party . “
280927	280938	280921	280921	I	0	” repeats Sir Leicester , unmindful of these mollifying sentiments , “
281005	281098	281099	281099	I	0	” Sir Leicester feels it incumbent on him to observe a crushing aspect towards Volumnia because it is whispered abroad that these necessary expenses will , in some two hundred election petitions , be unpleasantly connected with the word bribery , and because some graceless jokers have consequently suggested the omission from the Church service of the ordinary supplication in behalf of the High Court of Parliament and have recommended instead that the prayers of the congregation be requested for six hundred and fifty - eight gentlemen in a very unhealthy state . “
281102	281120	281099	281099	I	0	” observes Volumnia , having taken a little time to recover her spirits after her late castigation , “
281131	281132	281133	281133	I	0	” “
281138	281147	281099	281099	I	0	” says Sir Leicester , opening his eyes , “
281175	281470	281172	281173	a candidate	6419	” Volumnia had thought he might have been employed . Sir Leicester could desire to know by whom , and what for . Volumnia , abashed again , suggests , by somebody — to advise and make arrangements . Sir Leicester is not aware that any client of Mr. Tulkinghorn has been in need of his assistance . Lady Dedlock , seated at an open window with her arm upon its cushioned ledge and looking out at the evening shadows falling on the park , has seemed to attend since the lawyer ’s name was mentioned . A languid cousin with a moustache in a state of extreme debility now observes from his couch that man told him ya’as’dy that Tulkinghorn had gone down t ’ that iron place t ’ give legal ’ pinion ’bout something , and that contest being over t ’ day , ’ twould be highly jawlly thing if Tulkinghorn should ’ pear with news that Coodle man was floored . Mercury in attendance with coffee informs Sir Leicester , hereupon , that Mr. Tulkinghorn has arrived and is taking dinner . My Lady turns her head inward for the moment , then looks out again as before . Volumnia is charmed to hear that her delight is come . He is so original , such a stolid creature , such an immense being for knowing all sorts of things and never telling them ! Volumnia is persuaded that he must be a Freemason . Is sure he is at the head of a lodge , and wears short aprons , and is made a perfect idol of with candlesticks and trowels . These lively remarks the fair Dedlock delivers in her youthful manner , while making a purse . “
281478	281482	281471	281471	He	6420	” she adds , “
281513	281548	281501	281501	I	0	” It may be the gathering gloom of evening , or it may be the darker gloom within herself , but a shade is on my Lady ’s face , as if she thought , “
281554	281555	281551	281551	he	6420	” “
281559	281564	281551	281551	he	6420	” says Sir Leicester , “
281585	281592	281593	281596	’ normously rich fler	6424	” The debilitated cousin supposes he is “
281598	281599	281593	281596	’ normously rich fler	6424	” “
281608	281613	281600	281600	He	269	” says Sir Leicester , “
281642	281654	281629	281629	he	269	” Everybody starts . For a gun is fired close by . “
281662	281671	281629	281629	he	269	” cries Volumnia with her little withered scream . “
281675	281680	281629	281629	he	269	” says my Lady . “
281687	281700	281682	281682	they	6427	” Enter Mr. Tulkinghorn , followed by Mercuries with lamps and candles . “
281705	281710	281682	281682	they	6427	” says Sir Leicester , “
281725	281735	281719	281719	you	958	” On the contrary , my Lady prefers it . “
281738	281756	281719	281719	you	958	” Oh ! Nothing is so delicious to Volumnia as to sit and talk in the dark . “
281762	281767	281768	281768	Tulkinghorn	269	” says Sir Leicester . “
281780	281896	281777	281777	you	269	” Mr. Tulkinghorn with his usual leisurely ease advances , renders his passing homage to my Lady , shakes Sir Leicester ’s hand , and subsides into the chair proper to him when he has anything to communicate , on the opposite side of the Baronet ’s little newspaper - table . Sir Leicester is apprehensive that my Lady , not being very well , will take cold at that open window . My Lady is obliged to him , but would rather sit there for the air . Sir Leicester rises , adjusts her scarf about her , and returns to his seat . Mr. Tulkinghorn in the meanwhile takes a pinch of snuff . “
281899	281904	281777	281777	you	269	” says Sir Leicester . “
281911	281912	281971	281971	you	6431	” “
281944	281970	281971	281971	you	6431	” It is a part of Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s policy and mastery to have no political opinions ; indeed , NO opinions . Therefore he says “
281972	281978	281979	281979	we	6432	” are beaten , and not “
281981	282018	281979	281979	we	6432	” Sir Leicester is majestically wroth . Volumnia never heard of such a thing . ‘ The debilitated cousin holds that it ’s sort of thing that ’s sure tapn slongs votes — giv’n — Mob . “
282027	282046	282048	282048	they	6429	” Mr. Tulkinghorn goes on to say in the fast - increasing darkness when there is silence again , “
282058	282059	282048	282048	they	6429	” “
282081	282086	282065	282065	you	6431	” observes Sir Leicester , “
282137	282138	282131	282131	I	0	” “
282141	282146	282131	282131	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
282162	282173	282131	282131	I	0	” Sir Leicester is distinctly heard to gasp before speaking . “
282193	282194	282180	282180	you	6431	” “
282198	282199	282180	282180	you	6431	” “
282202	282203	282210	282210	you	6431	” “
282247	282269	282241	282241	he	1910	” It is evident to the whole company , though nobody can see him , that Sir Leicester is staring majestically . “
282276	282286	282271	282271	he	1910	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn as a wind - up , “
282291	282292	282271	282271	he	1910	” “
282299	282307	282271	282271	he	1910	” repeats Sir Leicester with awful politeness . “
282312	282313	282271	282271	he	1910	” “
282329	282330	282331	282332	That son	6444	” “
282339	282340	282334	282334	He	6444	” “
282346	282367	282334	282334	He	6444	” says Sir Leicester after a terrific pause during which he has been heard to snort and felt to stare , “
282414	282459	282460	282460	I	0	” General burst of cousinly indignation . Volumnia thinks it is really high time , you know , for somebody in power to step in and do something strong . Debilitated cousin thinks — country ’s going — Dayvle — steeple - chase pace . “
282463	282472	282460	282460	I	0	” says Sir Leicester in a breathless condition , “
282500	282501	282496	282498	that young woman	3467	” “
282507	282521	282491	282491	me	0	” observes my Lady from her window in a low but decided tone , “
282527	282528	282496	282498	that young woman	3467	” “
282535	282540	282496	282498	that young woman	3467	” returns Sir Leicester . “
282632	282643	282604	282604	You	958	” Sir Leicester adds , after a moment ’s consideration , “
282652	282705	282604	282604	You	958	” These remarks he offers with his unvarying politeness and deference when he addresses himself to his wife . She merely moves her head in reply . The moon is rising , and where she sits there is a little stream of cold pale light , in which her head is seen . “
282712	282717	282604	282604	You	958	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “
282732	282733	282726	282726	their	10261	” “
282736	282743	282744	282744	I	0	” Sir Leicester doubts his hearing . “
282779	282780	282796	282797	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” “
282783	282789	282796	282797	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” says Sir Leicester tremulously . “
282805	282806	282799	282799	You	0	” “
282812	282817	282818	282818	I	0	” returns the lawyer , “
282838	282871	282833	282834	Lady Dedlock	264	” Her head concedes it , and Volumnia is enchanted . A story ! Oh , he is going to tell something at last ! A ghost in it , Volumnia hopes ? “
282879	282898	282904	282905	Miss Dedlock	625	” Mr. Tulkinghorn stops for an instant and repeats with some little emphasis grafted upon his usual monotony , “
282952	282988	282939	282940	Lady Dedlock	264	” By the light of the fire , which is low , he can be seen looking towards the moonlight . By the light of the moon Lady Dedlock can be seen , perfectly still . “
283050	283056	283047	283048	Sir Leicester	266	” Sir Leicester condescendingly says , “
283062	283085	283047	283048	Sir Leicester	266	” implying that then she must have appeared of very considerable moral dimensions indeed in the eyes of an iron - master . “
283187	283218	283174	283174	she	11964	” By the light of the fire he can be seen looking towards the moonlight . By the moonlight , Lady Dedlock can be seen in profile , perfectly still . “
283437	283490	283429	283430	Lady Dedlock	264	” There are various opinions on the merits , more or less conflicting with Volumnia ’s . That fair young creature can not believe there ever was any such lady and rejects the whole history on the threshold . The majority incline to the debilitated cousin ’s sentiment , which is in few words—“no
283498	284304	284305	284306	Lady Dedlock	264	” Sir Leicester generally refers back in his mind to Wat Tyler and arranges a sequence of events on a plan of his own . There is not much conversation in all , for late hours have been kept at Chesney Wold since the necessary expenses elsewhere began , and this is the first night in many on which the family have been alone . It is past ten when Sir Leicester begs Mr. Tulkinghorn to ring for candles . Then the stream of moonlight has swelled into a lake , and then Lady Dedlock for the first time moves , and rises , and comes forward to a table for a glass of water . Winking cousins , bat - like in the candle glare , crowd round to give it ; Volumnia ( always ready for something better if procurable ) takes another , a very mild sip of which contents her ; Lady Dedlock , graceful , self - possessed , looked after by admiring eyes , passes away slowly down the long perspective by the side of that nymph , not at all improving her as a question of contrast . CHAPTER XLI In Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s Room Mr. Tulkinghorn arrives in his turret - room a little breathed by the journey up , though leisurely performed . There is an expression on his face as if he had discharged his mind of some grave matter and were , in his close way , satisfied . To say of a man so severely and strictly self - repressed that he is triumphant would be to do him as great an injustice as to suppose him troubled with love or sentiment or any romantic weakness . He is sedately satisfied . Perhaps there is a rather increased sense of power upon him as he loosely grasps one of his veinous wrists with his other hand and holding it behind his back walks noiselessly up and down . There is a capacious writing - table in the room on which is a pretty large accumulation of papers . The green lamp is lighted , his reading - glasses lie upon the desk , the easy - chair is wheeled up to it , and it would seem as though he had intended to bestow an hour or so upon these claims on his attention before going to bed . But he happens not to be in a business mind . After a glance at the documents awaiting his notice — with his head bent low over the table , the old man ’s sight for print or writing being defective at night — he opens the French window and steps out upon the leads . There he again walks slowly up and down in the same attitude , subsiding , if a man so cool may have any need to subside , from the story he has related downstairs . The time was once when men as knowing as Mr. Tulkinghorn would walk on turret - tops in the starlight and look up into the sky to read their fortunes there . Hosts of stars are visible to - night , though their brilliancy is eclipsed by the splendour of the moon . If he be seeking his own star as he methodically turns and turns upon the leads , it should be but a pale one to be so rustily represented below . If he be tracing out his destiny , that may be written in other characters nearer to his hand . As he paces the leads with his eyes most probably as high above his thoughts as they are high above the earth , he is suddenly stopped in passing the window by two eyes that meet his own . The ceiling of his room is rather low ; and the upper part of the door , which is opposite the window , is of glass . There is an inner baize door , too , but the night being warm he did not close it when he came upstairs . These eyes that meet his own are looking in through the glass from the corridor outside . He knows them well . The blood has not flushed into his face so suddenly and redly for many a long year as when he recognizes Lady Dedlock . He steps into the room , and she comes in too , closing both the doors behind her . There is a wild disturbance — is it fear or anger?—in her eyes . In her carriage and all else she looks as she looked downstairs two hours ago . Is it fear or is it anger now ? He can not be sure . Both might be as pale , both as intent . “
284308	284342	284305	284306	Lady Dedlock	264	” She does not speak at first , nor even when she has slowly dropped into the easy - chair by the table . They look at each other , like two pictures . “
284354	284355	284345	284345	you	264	” “
284372	284373	284368	284368	I	0	” “
284381	284382	284377	284377	you	264	” “
284398	284399	284377	284377	you	264	” “
284402	284403	284377	284377	you	264	” “
284406	284484	284377	284377	you	264	” He stands before her with one hand on a chair - back and the other in his old - fashioned waistcoat and shirt - frill , exactly as he has stood before her at any time since her marriage . The same formal politeness , the same composed deference that might as well be defiance ; the whole man the same dark , cold object , at the same distance , which nothing has ever diminished . “
284493	284508	284509	284509	You	264	” He slightly inclines and advances his head as not quite understanding the question . “
284547	284604	284607	284608	Lady Dedlock	264	” So ! Anger , and fear , and shame . All three contending . What power this woman has to keep these raging passions down ! Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s thoughts take such form as he looks at her , with his ragged grey eyebrows a hair ’s breadth more contracted than usual under her gaze . “
284647	284648	284640	284640	they	6483	” “
284657	284658	284650	284650	they	6483	” “
284661	284662	284650	284650	they	6483	” “
284676	284677	284664	284664	I	0	” “
284683	284688	284664	284664	I	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn replies , “
284700	284721	284689	284689	I	0	” And he thinks , with the interest of attentive curiosity , as he watches the struggle in her breast , “
284732	284733	284734	284734	Sir	9496	” “
284736	284761	284734	284734	Sir	9496	” she says , for the moment obliged to set her lips with all the energy she has , that she may speak distinctly , “
284896	284921	284922	284922	You	9496	” Mr. Tulkinghorn , profoundly attentive , throws this off with a shrug of self - depreciation and contracts his eyebrows a little more . “
285000	285023	285024	285024	I	0	” And she would do it , thinks the lawyer , watchful of the firm hand with which she takes the pen ! “
285037	285038	285035	285035	yourself	9496	” “
285077	285078	285079	285080	Lady Dedlock	264	” “
285103	285222	285089	285089	I	0	” Their need for watching one another should be over now , but they do it all this time , and the stars watch them both through the opened window . Away in the moonlight lie the woodland fields at rest , and the wide house is as quiet as the narrow one . The narrow one ! Where are the digger and the spade , this peaceful night , destined to add the last great secret to the many secrets of the Tulkinghorn existence ? Is the man born yet , is the spade wrought yet ? Curious questions to consider , more curious perhaps not to consider , under the watching stars upon a summer night . “
285233	285239	285240	285240	I	0	” Lady Dedlock presently proceeds , “
285269	285289	285266	285266	your	9496	” He makes a feint of offering a protest , but she sweeps it away with her disdainful hand . “
285385	285386	285377	285377	I	0	” “
285393	285401	285390	285391	Lady Dedlock	264	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , quite unmoved . “
285414	285415	285411	285411	You	9496	” “
285436	285471	285431	285431	I	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn shakes his head . She rises , but he , without moving hand from chair - back or from old - fashioned waistcoat and shirt - frill , shakes his head . “
285481	285482	285477	285477	I	0	” “
285488	285494	285485	285486	Lady Dedlock	264	” he very calmly replies . “
285527	285528	285531	285532	Lady Dedlock	264	” “
285539	285574	285531	285532	Lady Dedlock	264	” Without deigning to rejoin , she moves to the inner door and has it in her hand when he says to her , without himself stirring hand or foot or raising his voice , “
285625	285684	285692	285693	Lady Dedlock	264	” He has conquered her . She falters , trembles , and puts her hand confusedly to her head . Slight tokens these in any one else , but when so practised an eye as Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s sees indecision for a moment in such a subject , he thoroughly knows its value . He promptly says again , “
285695	285720	285692	285693	Lady Dedlock	264	” and motions to the chair from which she has risen . She hesitates , but he motions again , and she sits down . “
285788	285789	285790	285790	Sir	9496	” “
285792	285809	285790	285790	Sir	9496	” she returns without looking up from the ground on which her eyes are now fixed , “
285835	285836	285828	285828	I	0	” “
285852	285853	285840	285841	Lady Dedlock	264	” “
285873	285972	285865	285865	I	0	” His jealous glance as she walks that way betrays an instant ’s misgiving that she may have it in her thoughts to leap over , and dashing against ledge and cornice , strike her life out upon the terrace below . But a moment ’s observation of her figure as she stands in the window without any support , looking out at the stars — not up — gloomily out at those stars which are low in the heavens , reassures him . By facing round as she has moved , he stands a little behind her . “
286039	286049	286051	286051	me	0	” He pauses , but she makes no reply . “
286070	286071	286072	286072	I	0	” “
286075	286076	286072	286072	I	0	” “
286137	286138	286134	286135	Sir Leicester	266	” “
286142	286160	286162	286162	you	0	” she asks in a low voice and without removing her gloomy look from those distant stars , “
286169	286170	286162	286162	you	0	” “
286230	286256	286257	286257	I	0	” She breathes quickly and heavily , but she stands as unflinchingly as ever he has seen her in the midst of her grandest company . “
286356	286357	286359	286359	my	0	” “
286362	286366	286359	286359	my	0	” she returned . “
286372	286373	286374	286374	Your	264	” “
286419	286434	286466	286467	Sir Leicester	266	” There is a quiet decision in his reply which admits of no remonstrance . “
286473	286478	286487	286488	Lady Dedlock	264	patrimony”—Mr . Tulkinghorn very dry here—“are
286492	286493	286487	286488	Lady Dedlock	264	” “
286497	286498	286487	286488	Lady Dedlock	264	” “
286501	286516	286517	286517	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , pursuing his case in his jog - trot style , “
286642	286660	286639	286640	your husband	2129	” He gets plainer as he gets on , but not an atom more emphatic or animated . “
286668	286672	286639	286640	your husband	2129	” he continues , “
286761	286790	286791	286791	My	0	” She stands looking out at the same stars without a word . They are beginning to pale , and she looks as if their coldness froze her . “
286796	286827	286828	286828	My	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , who has by this time got his hands in his pockets and is going on in his business consideration of the matter like a machine . “
286912	286913	286914	286914	I	0	” “
286934	286945	286914	286914	I	0	” she asks , still looking at the distant sky . “
286956	286957	286953	286954	Lady Dedlock	264	” “
286975	286976	286977	286977	I	0	” “
286987	286988	286989	286989	I	0	” “
287021	287026	287016	287016	you	264	” she said slowly . “
287043	287065	287034	287034	I	0	” She asks all her questions as if she were repeating them from memory or calling them over in her sleep . “
287073	287074	287034	287034	I	0	” “
287083	287084	287034	287034	I	0	” “
287101	287102	287094	287094	I	0	” “
287169	287185	287159	287159	I	0	” She stands absorbed in the same frozen way for some little time before asking , “
287197	287198	287159	287159	I	0	” “
287201	287213	287214	287214	I	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn returns methodically as he softly rubs his hands , “
287230	287231	287227	287228	Lady Dedlock	264	” “
287239	287240	287232	287232	You	264	” “
287329	287330	287331	287331	I	0	” “
287339	288150	287331	287331	I	0	” Both before and after saying it she remains absorbed , but at length moves , and turns , unshaken in her natural and acquired presence , towards the door . Mr. Tulkinghorn opens both the doors exactly as he would have done yesterday , or as he would have done ten years ago , and makes his old - fashioned bow as she passes out . It is not an ordinary look that he receives from the handsome face as it goes into the darkness , and it is not an ordinary movement , though a very slight one , that acknowledges his courtesy . But as he reflects when he is left alone , the woman has been putting no common constraint upon herself . He would know it all the better if he saw the woman pacing her own rooms with her hair wildly thrown from her flung - back face , her hands clasped behind her head , her figure twisted as if by pain . He would think so all the more if he saw the woman thus hurrying up and down for hours , without fatigue , without intermission , followed by the faithful step upon the Ghost ’s Walk . But he shuts out the now chilled air , draws the window - curtain , goes to bed , and falls asleep . And truly when the stars go out and the wan day peeps into the turret - chamber , finding him at his oldest , he looks as if the digger and the spade were both commissioned and would soon be digging . The same wan day peeps in at Sir Leicester pardoning the repentant country in a majestically condescending dream ; and at the cousins entering on various public employments , principally receipt of salary ; and at the chaste Volumnia , bestowing a dower of fifty thousand pounds upon a hideous old general with a mouth of false teeth like a pianoforte too full of keys , long the admiration of Bath and the terror of every other community . Also into rooms high in the roof , and into offices in court - yards , and over stables , where humbler ambition dreams of bliss , in keepers ’ lodges , and in holy matrimony with Will or Sally . Up comes the bright sun , drawing everything up with it — the Wills and Sallys , the latent vapour in the earth , the drooping leaves and flowers , the birds and beasts and creeping things , the gardeners to sweep the dewy turf and unfold emerald velvet where the roller passes , the smoke of the great kitchen fire wreathing itself straight and high into the lightsome air . Lastly , up comes the flag over Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s unconscious head cheerfully proclaiming that Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock are in their happy home and that there is hospitality at the place in Lincolnshire . CHAPTER XLII In Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s Chambers From the verdant undulations and the spreading oaks of the Dedlock property , Mr. Tulkinghorn transfers himself to the stale heat and dust of London . His manner of coming and going between the two places is one of his impenetrabilities . He walks into Chesney Wold as if it were next door to his chambers and returns to his chambers as if he had never been out of Lincoln ’s Inn Fields . He neither changes his dress before the journey nor talks of it afterwards . He melted out of his turret - room this morning , just as now , in the late twilight , he melts into his own square . Like a dingy London bird among the birds at roost in these pleasant fields , where the sheep are all made into parchment , the goats into wigs , and the pasture into chaff , the lawyer , smoke - dried and faded , dwelling among mankind but not consorting with them , aged without experience of genial youth , and so long used to make his cramped nest in holes and corners of human nature that he has forgotten its broader and better range , comes sauntering home . In the oven made by the hot pavements and hot buildings , he has baked himself dryer than usual ; and he has in his thirsty mind his mellowed port - wine half a century old . The lamplighter is skipping up and down his ladder on Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s side of the Fields when that high - priest of noble mysteries arrives at his own dull court - yard . He ascends the door - steps and is gliding into the dusky hall when he encounters , on the top step , a bowing and propitiatory little man . “
288155	288156	288159	288159	sir	9496	” “
288182	288183	288169	288169	I	0	” “
288197	288198	288192	288192	you	9496	” “
288203	288225	288201	288201	sir	9496	” says Mr. Snagsby , holding his hat at the side of his head in his deference towards his best customer , “
288238	288239	288226	288226	I	0	” “
288246	288247	288241	288241	you	9496	” “
288252	288253	288241	288241	you	9496	” “
288258	288288	288241	288241	you	9496	” The lawyer turns , leans his arms on the iron railing at the top of the steps , and looks at the lamplighter lighting the court - yard . “
288293	288303	288241	288241	you	9496	” says Mr. Snagsby in a mysterious low voice , “
288324	288333	288334	288335	What foreigner	6526	” Mr. Tulkinghorn eyes him with some surprise . “
288337	288338	288339	288341	The foreign female	6527	” “
288408	288409	288389	288390	Mr. Bucket	668	” “
288419	288420	288423	288423	sir	9496	” “
288425	288437	288423	288423	sir	9496	” Mr. Snagsby coughs his cough of submission behind his hat . “
288461	288490	288499	288499	Snagsby	362	” Mr. Snagsby appears to have set out in this reply with some desperate design of repeating the name , but on reflection coughs again to excuse himself . “
288501	288506	288494	288494	you	0	” demands Mr. Tulkinghorn , “
288510	288511	288494	288494	you	0	” “
288516	288528	288514	288514	sir	9496	” returns the stationer , shading his communication with his hat , “
288653	288680	288649	288649	yourself	9496	” Mr. Snagsby , having said this in a very plaintive manner , throws in a cough of general application to fill up all the blanks . “
288688	288693	288685	288685	you	9496	” asks Mr. Tulkinghorn . “
288699	288704	288697	288697	sir	9496	” returns Mr. Snagsby ; “
288969	288977	288955	288955	she	2319	sir”—Mr . Snagsby repeats the word with pathetic emphasis—“in
289033	289042	289043	289043	I	0	” says Mr. Snagsby , shaking his head , “
289089	289106	289082	289082	I	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn had listened gravely to this complaint and inquires when the stationer has finished , “
289117	289118	289115	289115	Snagsby	362	” “
289128	289141	289122	289122	sir	9496	” says Mr. Snagsby , ending with a cough that plainly adds , “
289151	289152	289153	289153	I	0	” “
289170	289175	289166	289166	she	396	” says the lawyer . “
289186	289191	289178	289178	she	396	” Mr. Snagsby pleads , “
289216	289217	289166	289166	she	396	” “
289220	289225	289166	289166	she	396	” says the other . “
289252	289281	289282	289283	These women	6565	” Mr. Snagsby , with much bowing and short apologetic coughing , takes his leave , lightened in heart . Mr. Tulkinghorn goes upstairs , saying to himself , “
289320	289460	289310	289310	I	0	” So saying , he unlocks his door , gropes his way into his murky rooms , lights his candles , and looks about him . It is too dark to see much of the Allegory overhead there , but that importunate Roman , who is for ever toppling out of the clouds and pointing , is at his old work pretty distinctly . Not honouring him with much attention , Mr. Tulkinghorn takes a small key from his pocket , unlocks a drawer in which there is another key , which unlocks a chest in which there is another , and so comes to the cellar - key , with which he prepares to descend to the regions of old wine . He is going towards the door with a candle in his hand when a knock comes . “
289500	289559	289497	289497	you	6569	” He stands the candle on the chimney - piece in the clerk ’s hall and taps his dry cheek with the key as he addresses these words of welcome to Mademoiselle Hortense . That feline personage , with her lips tightly shut and her eyes looking out at him sideways , softly closes the door before replying . “
289573	289574	289560	289560	I	0	” “
289578	289579	289560	289560	I	0	” “
289619	289620	289613	289613	he	6573	” “
289628	289629	289613	289613	he	6573	” “
289635	289703	289706	289706	mistress	6569	” At times there is a suddenness in the manner of Mademoiselle Hortense so like a bodily spring upon the subject of it that such subject involuntarily starts and fails back . It is Mr. Tulkinghorn ’s case at present , though Mademoiselle Hortense , with her eyes almost shut up ( but still looking out sideways ) , is only smiling contemptuously and shaking her head . “
289708	289723	289706	289706	mistress	6569	” says the lawyer , tapping the key hastily upon the chimney - piece . “
289737	289738	289739	289739	Sir	9496	” “
289755	289756	289748	289748	You	9496	” “
289763	289775	289748	289748	You	9496	” returns the lawyer , rubbing his nose with the key . “
289843	289850	289851	289851	You	6569	” Mademoiselle Hortense makes another spring . “
289859	289876	289851	289851	You	6569	” Mr. Tulkinghorn seems to meditate as he looks distrustfully at her , then he replies , “
289887	289888	289889	289889	You	0	” “
289893	289900	289889	289889	You	0	” she repeats with fierce disdain . “
289928	289975	289922	289922	I	0	” Which she literally does , taking them out of her bosom as she speaks and flinging them with such violence on the floor that they jerk up again into the light before they roll away into corners and slowly settle down there after spinning vehemently . “
289978	289989	289990	289990	You	0	” says Mademoiselle Hortense , darkening her large eyes again . “
290003	290021	289997	289998	my God	4954	” Mr. Tulkinghorn rubs his head with the key while she entertains herself with a sarcastic laugh . “
290031	290036	290022	290022	You	0	” he composedly observes , “
290045	290046	290047	290047	I	0	” “
290051	290055	290047	290047	I	0	” she returns . “
290077	290078	290073	290073	You	0	” “
290088	290089	290091	290091	you	0	” “
290124	290134	290112	290112	I	0	” It appears impossible for mademoiselle to roll the letter “
290136	290160	290107	290107	you	0	” sufficiently in this word , notwithstanding that she assists her energetic delivery by clenching both her hands and setting all her teeth . “
290170	290182	290168	290168	I	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , examining the wards of the key . “
290214	290233	290208	290208	I	0	” Mademoiselle Hortense folds her arms and throws this last remark at him over one of her shoulders . “
290247	290248	290239	290239	you	0	” “
290319	290320	290321	290321	You	0	” “
290329	290334	290321	290321	You	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn retorts . “
290385	290394	290379	290380	my God	4954	” In this reply , down to the word “
290396	290437	290379	290380	my God	4954	” inclusive , mademoiselle has been ironically polite and tender , then as suddenly dashed into the bitterest and most defiant scorn , with her black eyes in one and the same moment very nearly shut and staringly wide open . “
290444	290461	290472	290472	us	6590	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , tapping his chin with the key and looking imperturbably at her , “
290467	290468	290472	290472	us	6590	” “
290475	290489	290472	290472	us	6590	” mademoiselle assents , with many angry and tight nods of her head . “
290517	290518	290512	290512	you	0	” “
290522	290532	290512	290512	you	0	” says mademoiselle with more tight and angry nods . “
290552	290553	290512	290512	you	0	” “
290583	290584	290512	290512	you	0	” “
290588	290596	290512	290512	you	0	” repeats mademoiselle , cataleptic with determination . “
290616	290617	290512	290512	you	0	” “
290658	290675	290642	290642	I	0	” She merely throws a laugh over her shoulder and stands her ground with folded arms . “
290682	290683	290686	290686	I	0	” “
290690	290691	290686	290686	I	0	” “
290802	290803	290799	290799	you	0	” “
290807	290821	290804	290804	I	0	” mademoiselle replies without any action and in a clear , obliging voice , “
290829	290830	290804	290804	I	0	” “
290833	290843	290804	290804	I	0	” returns Mr. Tulkinghorn , quietly blowing his nose . “
290864	290865	290858	290858	you	0	” “
290875	290876	290884	290884	mistress	6569	” “
290886	290901	290884	290884	mistress	6569	” says the lawyer , deliberately putting away his handkerchief and adjusting his frill ; “
290968	290976	290966	290966	mistress	6569	” Illustrating with the cellar - key . “
290979	290988	290966	290966	mistress	6569	” returns mademoiselle in the same pleasant voice . “
291004	291005	291006	291006	My	0	” “
291010	291015	291006	291006	My	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “
291032	291033	291028	291028	you	6584	” “
291047	291048	291037	291037	you	0	” “
291051	291090	291037	291037	you	0	” It would be contradictory for one in mademoiselle ’s state of agreeable jocularity to foam at the mouth , otherwise a tigerish expansion thereabouts might look as if a very little more would make her do it . “
291097	291102	291037	291037	you	0	” says Mr. Tulkinghorn , “
291161	291162	291139	291139	they	13015	” “
291168	291177	291163	291163	I	0	” whispers mademoiselle , stretching out her hand , “
291188	291189	291178	291178	I	0	” “
291193	291201	291202	291202	I	0	” pursues the lawyer without minding her , “
291229	291230	291231	291231	I	0	” “
291236	291244	291231	291231	I	0	” repeats mademoiselle in her former whisper . “
291248	291258	291259	291259	you	6569	” proceeds the lawyer , still without minding her , “
291272	291273	291275	291275	you	0	” “
291277	291281	291275	291275	you	0	” she answers , “
291287	291288	291275	291275	you	0	” “
291299	291311	291296	291296	you	0	” Mr. Tulkinghorn observes , following her out upon the staircase , “
291356	291888	291889	291889	Rick	317	” She goes down without answering or looking behind her . When she is gone , he goes down too , and returning with his cobweb - covered bottle , devotes himself to a leisurely enjoyment of its contents , now and then , as he throws his head back in his chair , catching sight of the pertinacious Roman pointing from the ceiling . CHAPTER XLIII Esther ’s Narrative It matters little now how much I thought of my living mother who had told me evermore to consider her dead . I could not venture to approach her or to communicate with her in writing , for my sense of the peril in which her life was passed was only to be equalled by my fears of increasing it . Knowing that my mere existence as a living creature was an unforeseen danger in her way , I could not always conquer that terror of myself which had seized me when I first knew the secret . At no time did I dare to utter her name . I felt as if I did not even dare to hear it . If the conversation anywhere , when I was present , took that direction , as it sometimes naturally did , I tried not to hear : I mentally counted , repeated something that I knew , or went out of the room . I am conscious now that I often did these things when there can have been no danger of her being spoken of , but I did them in the dread I had of hearing anything that might lead to her betrayal , and to her betrayal through me . It matters little now how often I recalled the tones of my mother ’s voice , wondered whether I should ever hear it again as I so longed to do , and thought how strange and desolate it was that it should be so new to me . It matters little that I watched for every public mention of my mother ’s name ; that I passed and repassed the door of her house in town , loving it , but afraid to look at it ; that I once sat in the theatre when my mother was there and saw me , and when we were so wide asunder before the great company of all degrees that any link or confidence between us seemed a dream . It is all , all over . My lot has been so blest that I can relate little of myself which is not a story of goodness and generosity in others . I may well pass that little and go on . When we were settled at home again , Ada and I had many conversations with my guardian of which Richard was the theme . My dear girl was deeply grieved that he should do their kind cousin so much wrong , but she was so faithful to Richard that she could not bear to blame him even for that . My guardian was assured of it , and never coupled his name with a word of reproof . “
291896	291903	291889	291889	Rick	317	” he would say to her . “
291930	292119	291918	291918	We	6623	” We knew afterwards what we suspected then , that he did not trust to time until he had often tried to open Richard ’s eyes . That he had written to him , gone to him , talked with him , tried every gentle and persuasive art his kindness could devise . Our poor devoted Richard was deaf and blind to all . If he were wrong , he would make amends when the Chancery suit was over . If he were groping in the dark , he could not do better than do his utmost to clear away those clouds in which so much was confused and obscured . Suspicion and misunderstanding were the fault of the suit ? Then let him work the suit out and come through it to his right mind . This was his unvarying reply . Jarndyce and Jarndyce had obtained such possession of his whole nature that it was impossible to place any consideration before him which he did not , with a distorted kind of reason , make a new argument in favour of his doing what he did . “
292128	292136	291918	291918	We	6623	” said my guardian once to me , “
292150	292171	292172	292172	Adviser	6625	” I took one of these opportunities of mentioning my doubts of Mr. Skimpole as a good adviser for Richard . “
292174	292181	292172	292172	Adviser	6625	” returned my guardian , laughing , “
292191	292192	292189	292189	Skimpole	323	” “
292202	292205	292189	292189	Skimpole	323	” said I. “
292208	292214	292189	292189	Skimpole	323	” returned my guardian again . “
292222	292223	292220	292220	Skimpole	323	” “
292227	292231	292225	292225	Richard	291	” I asked . “
292234	292238	292225	292225	Richard	291	” he replied . “
292287	292288	292281	292285	such a child as Skimpole	6629	” “
292294	292310	292281	292285	such a child as Skimpole	6629	” said Ada , who had just joined us and now looked over my shoulder , “
292318	292319	292281	292285	such a child as Skimpole	6629	” “
292327	292342	292345	292346	cousin John	6632	” inquired my guardian , rubbing his head , a little at a loss . “
292348	292349	292345	292346	cousin John	6632	” “
292352	292364	292345	292346	cousin John	6632	” he slowly replied , roughening his head more and more , “
292438	292451	292454	292454	you	6634	” said my guardian , stopping short and looking at us hopefully . “
292460	292482	292454	292454	you	6634	” Ada , glancing at me , said she thought it was a pity he should be an expense to Richard . “
292491	292497	292454	292454	you	6634	” returned my guardian hurriedly . “
292518	292545	292547	292547	he	6636	” And I said I thought it was to be regretted that he had ever introduced Richard to Mr. Vholes for a present of five pounds . “
292549	292563	292547	292547	he	6636	” said my guardian with a passing shade of vexation on his face . “
292640	292641	292627	292627	He	1619	” “
292646	292649	292627	292627	He	1619	” said I. “
292652	292660	292627	292627	He	1619	” cried my guardian , quite triumphant . “
292747	293265	292734	292734	Lord	6643	” In pursuance of this plan , we went into London on an early day and presented ourselves at Mr. Skimpole ’s door . He lived in a place called the Polygon , in Somers Town , where there were at that time a number of poor Spanish refugees walking about in cloaks , smoking little paper cigars . Whether he was a better tenant than one might have supposed , in consequence of his friend Somebody always paying his rent at last , or whether his inaptitude for business rendered it particularly difficult to turn him out , I do n’t know ; but he had occupied the same house some years . It was in a state of dilapidation quite equal to our expectation . Two or three of the area railings were gone , the water - butt was broken , the knocker was loose , the bell - handle had been pulled off a long time to judge from the rusty state of the wire , and dirty footprints on the steps were the only signs of its being inhabited . A slatternly full - blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over - ripe berry answered our knock by opening the door a very little way and stopping up the gap with her figure . As she knew Mr. Jarndyce ( indeed Ada and I both thought that she evidently associated him with the receipt of her wages ) , she immediately relented and allowed us to pass in . The lock of the door being in a disabled condition , she then applied herself to securing it with the chain , which was not in good action either , and said would we go upstairs ? We went upstairs to the first floor , still seeing no other furniture than the dirty footprints . Mr. Jarndyce without further ceremony entered a room there , and we followed . It was dingy enough and not at all clean , but furnished with an odd kind of shabby luxury , with a large footstool , a sofa , and plenty of cushions , an easy - chair , and plenty of pillows , a piano , books , drawing materials , music , newspapers , and a few sketches and pictures . A broken pane of glass in one of the dirty windows was papered and wafered over , but there was a little plate of hothouse nectarines on the table , and there was another of grapes , and another of sponge - cakes , and there was a bottle of light wine . Mr. Skimpole himself reclined upon the sofa in a dressing - gown , drinking some fragrant coffee from an old china cup — it was then about mid - day — and looking at a collection of wallflowers in the balcony . He was not in the least disconcerted by our appearance , but rose and received us in his usual airy manner . “
293273	293296	292734	292734	Lord	6643	” he said when we were seated , not without some little difficulty , the greater part of the chairs being broken . “
293371	293372	293392	293392	his	9918	” “
293398	293405	293395	293395	his	9918	” said my guardian to us . “
293408	293419	293395	293395	his	9918	” said Mr. Skimpole , turning his bright face about , “
293455	293468	293469	293469	He	9918	” He handed us the grapes , repeating in his radiant way , “
293482	293483	293469	293469	He	9918	” “
293489	293494	293469	293469	He	9918	” said my guardian . “
293498	293499	293469	293469	He	9918	” “
293502	293506	293469	293469	He	9918	” he answered . “
293572	293588	293568	293568	he	2184	” My guardian looked at us with a smile , as though he asked us , “
293599	293600	293568	293568	he	2184	” “
293606	293620	293568	293568	he	2184	” said Mr. Skimpole , gaily taking a little claret in a tumbler , “
293682	293712	293677	293677	They	6666	” He was going to summon them when my guardian interposed and asked him to pause a moment , as he wished to say a word to him first . “
293717	293728	293677	293677	They	6666	” he cheerfully replied , going back to his sofa , “
293787	293798	293801	293801	him	6669	” My guardian looked at us again , plainly saying , “
293803	293804	293801	293801	him	6669	” “
293809	293813	293807	293807	Harold	323	” he began , “
293824	293825	293822	293822	Rick	317	” “
293832	293838	293826	293828	The dearest friend	6670	” returned Mr. Skimpole cordially . “
293898	293928	293894	293894	I	0	” The engaging frankness with which he made this declaration really had a disinterested appearance and captivated my guardian , if not , for the moment , Ada too . “
293941	293946	293929	293929	You	323	” returned Mr. Jarndyce , “
293956	293957	293954	293954	Harold	323	” “
293960	293965	293954	293954	Harold	323	” said Mr. Skimpole . “
293980	294018	293975	293975	I	0	” Taking a little more claret and dipping one of the cakes in it , he shook his head and smiled at Ada and me with an ingenuous foreboding that he never could be made to understand . “
294028	294034	294035	294035	you	323	” said my guardian plainly , “
294044	294045	294046	294046	My	0	” “
294050	294066	294046	294046	My	0	” returned Mr. Skimpole , his genial face irradiated by the comicality of this idea , “
294196	294197	294191	294191	I	0	” “
294200	294214	294170	294170	I	0	” said my guardian , by no means displeased with this artless reply , “
294251	294252	294253	294253	My	0	” “
294257	294262	294263	294263	I	0	” returned Mr. Skimpole , “
294351	294352	294359	294359	sir	9496	” “
294361	294365	294359	294359	sir	9496	” said Ada . “
294370	294371	294359	294359	sir	9496	” “
294376	294385	294359	294359	sir	9496	” returned Mr. Skimpole with his bright smile . “
294390	294391	294386	294386	You	286	” “
294404	294424	294426	294426	you	286	” said my guardian , laying his hand emphatically on the sleeve of Mr. Skimpole ’s dressing - gown , “
294439	294440	294437	294437	Harold	323	” “
294446	294451	294437	294437	Harold	323	” returned Mr. Skimpole , “
294537	294761	294532	294532	I	0	” The helpless kind of candour with which he presented this before us , the light - hearted manner in which he was amused by his innocence , the fantastic way in which he took himself under his own protection and argued about that curious person , combined with the delightful ease of everything he said exactly to make out my guardian ’s case . The more I saw of him , the more unlikely it seemed to me , when he was present , that he could design , conceal , or influence anything ; and yet the less likely that appeared when he was not present , and the less agreeable it was to think of his having anything to do with any one for whom I cared . Hearing that his examination ( as he called it ) was now over , Mr. Skimpole left the room with a radiant face to fetch his daughters ( his sons had run away at various times ) , leaving my guardian quite delighted by the manner in which he had vindicated his childish character . He soon came back , bringing with him the three young ladies and Mrs. Skimpole , who had once been a beauty but was now a delicate high - nosed invalid suffering under a complication of disorders . “
294764	294769	294532	294532	I	0	” said Mr. Skimpole , “
294841	294889	294819	294819	We	6691	” Mrs. Skimpole sighed , I thought , as if she would have been glad to strike out this item in the family attainments . I also thought that she rather impressed her sigh upon my guardian and that she took every opportunity of throwing in another . “
294894	294911	294819	294819	We	6691	” said Mr. Skimpole , turning his sprightly eyes from one to the other of us , “
294937	294962	294963	294963	My	0	” The daughters , who appeared to be very fond of him , were amused by this droll fact , particularly the Comedy daughter . “
294970	294975	294963	294963	My	0	” said Mr. Skimpole , “
295129	295147	295148	295148	We	6691	” He laughed , but as usual seemed quite candid and really to mean what he said . “
295155	295160	295152	295153	my roses	6699	” said Mr. Skimpole , “
295169	295170	295175	295175	papa	6700	” “
295177	295183	295175	295175	papa	6700	” cried the three daughters . “
295193	295198	295175	295175	papa	6700	” said Mr. Skimpole , “
295345	295564	295565	295565	My	0	” She looked very young indeed to be the mother of two children , and I could not help pitying both her and them . It was evident that the three daughters had grown up as they could and had had just as little haphazard instruction as qualified them to be their father ’s playthings in his idlest hours . His pictorial tastes were consulted , I observed , in their respective styles of wearing their hair , the Beauty daughter being in the classic manner , the Sentiment daughter luxuriant and flowing , and the Comedy daughter in the arch style , with a good deal of sprightly forehead , and vivacious little curls dotted about the corners of her eyes . They were dressed to correspond , though in a most untidy and negligent way . Ada and I conversed with these young ladies and found them wonderfully like their father . In the meanwhile Mr. Jarndyce ( who had been rubbing his head to a great extent , and hinted at a change in the wind ) talked with Mrs. Skimpole in a corner , where we could not help hearing the chink of money . Mr. Skimpole had previously volunteered to go home with us and had withdrawn to dress himself for the purpose . “
295568	295576	295565	295565	My	0	” he said when he came back , “
295631	295632	295633	295635	That bad man	6717	” “
295637	295643	295633	295635	That bad man	6717	” said the Comedy daughter . “
295665	295669	295649	295649	he	6717	” Laura complained . “
295681	295685	295649	295649	he	6717	” said Arethusa . “
295696	295707	295649	295649	he	6717	” Mr. Skimpole assented , but with perfect good humour . “
295732	295738	295725	295726	My daughters	6126	” he explained to us , “
295744	295745	295740	295742	an honest man	1036	” “
295753	295759	295761	295765	a rough kind of fellow	6723	” they all three protested . “
295775	295780	295761	295765	a rough kind of fellow	6723	” said Mr. Skimpole , “
296104	296117	296101	296101	he	6728	” said Mr. Skimpole , raising his laughing eyes in playful astonishment ; “
296155	296529	296153	296153	Jarndyce	286	” It seemed to escape his consideration that Mrs. Skimpole and the daughters remained behind to encounter the baker , but this was so old a story to all of them that it had become a matter of course . He took leave of his family with a tenderness as airy and graceful as any other aspect in which he showed himself and rode away with us in perfect harmony of mind . We had an opportunity of seeing through some open doors , as we went downstairs , that his own apartment was a palace to the rest of the house . I could have no anticipation , and I had none , that something very startling to me at the moment , and ever memorable to me in what ensued from it , was to happen before this day was out . Our guest was in such spirits on the way home that I could do nothing but listen to him and wonder at him ; nor was I alone in this , for Ada yielded to the same fascination . As to my guardian , the wind , which had threatened to become fixed in the east when we left Somers Town , veered completely round before we were a couple of miles from it . Whether of questionable childishness or not in any other matters , Mr. Skimpole had a child ’s enjoyment of change and bright weather . In no way wearied by his sallies on the road , he was in the drawing - room before any of us ; and I heard him at the piano while I was yet looking after my housekeeping , singing refrains of barcaroles and drinking songs , Italian and German , by the score . We were all assembled shortly before dinner , and he was still at the piano idly picking out in his luxurious way little strains of music , and talking between whiles of finishing some sketches of the ruined old Verulam wall to - morrow , which he had begun a year or two ago and had got tired of , when a card was brought in and my guardian read aloud in a surprised voice , “
296534	296624	296153	296153	Jarndyce	286	” The visitor was in the room while it was yet turning round with me and before I had the power to stir . If I had had it , I should have hurried away . I had not even the presence of mind , in my giddiness , to retire to Ada in the window , or to see the window , or to know where it was . I heard my name and found that my guardian was presenting me before I could move to a chair . “
296632	296633	296629	296630	Sir Leicester	266	” “
296637	296650	296634	296635	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” said Sir Leicester in reply as he bowed and seated himself , “
296660	296661	296662	296662	You	266	” “
296671	296672	296662	296662	You	266	” “
296763	296764	296765	296765	You	266	” “
296794	296795	296790	296790	you	266	” “
296905	296918	296890	296890	I	0	” My guardian delicately dismissed this remark without making any verbal answer . “
296928	296934	296925	296926	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” Sir Leicester weightily proceeded . “
297027	297050	297051	297052	Mr. Hirrold	635	” Here he produced a card and read , with much gravity and a little trouble , through his eye - glass , “
297069	297070	297067	297067	Skimpole	323	” “
297077	297085	297073	297075	Mr. Harold Skimpole	323	” said my guardian , evidently surprised . “
297088	297093	297073	297075	Mr. Harold Skimpole	323	” exclaimed Sir Leicester , “
297140	297141	297142	297142	You	9496	” “
297180	297192	297194	297195	public benefactors	6764	” said Mr. Skimpole with his usual happy and easy air , “
297238	297249	297250	297251	An artist	9858	” Sir Leicester seemed to approve of this sentiment highly . “
297255	297256	297250	297251	An artist	9858	” “
297259	297264	297265	297268	A perfectly idle man	6770	” returned Mr. Skimpole . “
297274	297316	297317	297318	Mr. Skimpole	323	” Sir Leicester seemed to approve of this even more . He hoped he might have the good fortune to be at Chesney Wold when Mr. Skimpole next came down into Lincolnshire . Mr. Skimpole professed himself much flattered and honoured . “
297321	297333	297317	297318	Mr. Skimpole	323	” pursued Sir Leicester , addressing himself again to my guardian , “
297357	297359	297348	297355	an old and attached retainer of the family	6773	” ( “
297388	297397	297364	297364	I	0	” Mr. Skimpole airily explained to us . ) “
297414	297425	297411	297412	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” Sir Leicester bowed to the bearer of that name . “
297503	297504	297493	297493	I	0	” “
297515	297520	297512	297513	Sir Leicester	266	” returned my guardian . “
297552	297647	297648	297648	I	0	” I had not once looked up . I had not seen the visitor and had not even appeared to myself to hear the conversation . It surprises me to find that I can recall it , for it seemed to make no impression on me as it passed . I heard them speaking , but my mind was so confused and my instinctive avoidance of this gentleman made his presence so distressing to me that I thought I understood nothing , through the rushing in my head and the beating of my heart . “
297656	297663	297648	297648	I	0	” said Sir Leicester , rising , “
297767	297768	297769	297769	You	286	” “
297777	297787	297769	297769	You	286	” said Mr. Skimpole , lightly appealing to us . “
297800	298033	297769	297769	You	286	” Sir Leicester Dedlock coughed as if he could not possibly hear another word in reference to such an individual and took his leave with great ceremony and politeness . I got to my own room with all possible speed and remained there until I had recovered my self - command . It had been very much disturbed , but I was thankful to find when I went downstairs again that they only rallied me for having been shy and mute before the great Lincolnshire baronet . By that time I had made up my mind that the period was come when I must tell my guardian what I knew . The possibility of my being brought into contact with my mother , of my being taken to her house , even of Mr. Skimpole ’s , however distantly associated with me , receiving kindnesses and obligations from her husband , was so painful that I felt I could no longer guide myself without his assistance . When we had retired for the night , and Ada and I had had our usual talk in our pretty room , I went out at my door again and sought my guardian among his books . I knew he always read at that hour , and as I drew near I saw the light shining out into the passage from his reading - lamp . “
298041	298042	298045	298046	little woman	2039	” “
298053	298054	297769	297769	You	286	” “
298079	298143	298062	298062	I	0	” He put a chair for me , shut his book , and put it by , and turned his kind attentive face towards me . I could not help observing that it wore that curious expression I had observed in it once before — on that night when he had said that he was in no trouble which I could readily understand . “
298152	298156	298150	298150	Esther	280	” said he , “
298175	298176	298177	298177	I	0	” “
298209	298225	298203	298203	I	0	” He looked unprepared for my being so earnest , and even a little alarmed . “
298237	298241	298229	298229	I	0	” said I , “
298252	298253	298254	298255	The visitor	10358	” “
298264	298265	298260	298262	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” “
298268	298302	298260	298262	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” He folded his arms and sat looking at me with an air of the profoundest astonishment , awaiting what I should say next . I did not know how to prepare him . “
298307	298316	298317	298318	our visitor	10199	” said he , breaking into a smile , “
298336	298337	298342	298342	guardian	10146	” “
298358	298399	298400	298400	Guardian	637	” The smile passed from his face , and he became graver than before . He crossed to the door to see that it was shut ( but I had seen to that ) and resumed his seat before me . “
298402	298406	298408	298408	you	637	” said I , “
298431	298432	298421	298422	Lady Dedlock	264	” “
298441	298442	298438	298438	I	0	” “

298474	298485	298486	298486	My	0	” His face quite altered as he looked at me . “
298552	298553	298541	298541	her	1205	” “
298568	298569	298571	298571	her	1205	” “
298573	298583	298571	298571	her	1205	” He paused a little , biting his lip . “
298650	298651	298654	298654	guardian	10146	” “
298656	298670	298654	298654	guardian	10146	” I returned , fearful of the light that dimly broke upon me . “
298677	298678	298679	298680	Lady Dedlock	264	” “
298684	298685	298679	298680	Lady Dedlock	264	” “
298689	298696	298699	298699	guardian	10146	” I could scarcely ask him , “
298709	298710	298713	298713	her	264	” “
298875	298876	298879	298879	guardian	10146	” “
298886	298896	298915	298915	guardian	10146	” I cried , giving way to my grief ; “
298904	298905	298906	298906	You	0	” “
298911	298912	298915	298915	guardian	10146	” “
298931	298932	298915	298915	guardian	10146	” “
298937	298943	298946	298946	guardian	10146	” he cried , starting . “
298957	299321	298954	298955	my mother	2299	” I would have told him all my mother ’s letter , but he would not hear it then . He spoke so tenderly and wisely to me , and he put so plainly before me all I had myself imperfectly thought and hoped in my better state of mind , that , penetrated as I had been with fervent gratitude towards him through so many years , I believed I had never loved him so dearly , never thanked him in my heart so fully , as I did that night . And when he had taken me to my room and kissed me at the door , and when at last I lay down to sleep , my thought was how could I ever be busy enough , how could I ever be good enough , how in my little way could I ever hope to be forgetful enough of myself , devoted enough to him , and useful enough to others , to show him how I blessed and honoured him . CHAPTER XLIV The Letter and the Answer My guardian called me into his room next morning , and then I told him what had been left untold on the previous night . There was nothing to be done , he said , but to keep the secret and to avoid another such encounter as that of yesterday . He understood my feeling and entirely shared it . He charged himself even with restraining Mr. Skimpole from improving his opportunity . One person whom he need not name to me , it was not now possible for him to advise or help . He wished it were , but no such thing could be . If her mistrust of the lawyer whom she had mentioned were well - founded , which he scarcely doubted , he dreaded discovery . He knew something of him , both by sight and by reputation , and it was certain that he was a dangerous man . Whatever happened , he repeatedly impressed upon me with anxious affection and kindness , I was as innocent of as himself and as unable to influence . “
299327	299331	298954	298955	my mother	2299	” said he , “
299350	299351	299353	299354	the lawyer	1054	” “
299356	299360	299353	299354	the lawyer	1054	” I returned . “

299418	299423	299409	299409	I	0	” said my guardian . “
299438	299459	299470	299473	a more alarming person	6829	” I called to his recollection the French maid and the eager offer of herself she had made to me . “
299462	299467	299470	299473	a more alarming person	6829	” he returned thoughtfully . “
299533	299534	299528	299528	She	6832	” “
299540	299543	299535	299535	Her	6832	” said I. “

299746	299822	299823	299823	My	0	” I thanked him with my whole heart . What could I ever do but thank him ! I was going out at the door when he asked me to stay a moment . Quickly turning round , I saw that same expression on his face again ; and all at once , I do n’t know how , it flashed upon me as a new and far - off possibility that I understood it . “
299827	299832	299825	299825	Esther	280	” said my guardian , “
299850	299851	299842	299842	I	0	” “

299969	300003	300005	300005	I	0	” With the strictest truth , for his momentary hesitation was gone ( it had not lasted a minute ) , and his fine , sensible , cordial , sterling manner was restored . “
300030	300050	300017	300017	I	0	” said he with his bright clear eyes on mine . I answered , most assuredly he did not . “

300072	300080	300065	300065	Esther	280	” said I with my whole heart . “

300096	300143	300093	300093	your	4187	” He took it in his , holding me lightly with his arm , and looking down into my face with the same genuine freshness and faithfulness of manner — the old protecting manner which had made that house my home in a moment — said , “

300455	300504	300447	300447	I	0	” He shook my hand and said no more . Nor was any more said in reference to this conversation , either by him or me , through the whole week . When the appointed night came , I said to Charley as soon as I was alone , “
300527	300589	300596	300596	Charley	336	” Charley went up the stairs , and down the stairs , and along the passages — the zig - zag way about the old - fashioned house seemed very long in my listening ears that night — and so came back , along the passages , and down the stairs , and up the stairs , and brought the letter . “
300598	301703	300596	300596	Charley	336	” said I. So Charley laid it on the table and went to bed , and I sat looking at it without taking it up , thinking of many things . I began with my overshadowed childhood , and passed through those timid days to the heavy time when my aunt lay dead , with her resolute face so cold and set , and when I was more solitary with Mrs. Rachael than if I had had no one in the world to speak to or to look at . I passed to the altered days when I was so blest as to find friends in all around me , and to be beloved . I came to the time when I first saw my dear girl and was received into that sisterly affection which was the grace and beauty of my life . I recalled the first bright gleam of welcome which had shone out of those very windows upon our expectant faces on that cold bright night , and which had never paled . I lived my happy life there over again , I went through my illness and recovery , I thought of myself so altered and of those around me so unchanged ; and all this happiness shone like a light from one central figure , represented before me by the letter on the table . I opened it and read it . It was so impressive in its love for me , and in the unselfish caution it gave me , and the consideration it showed for me in every word , that my eyes were too often blinded to read much at a time . But I read it through three times before I laid it down . I had thought beforehand that I knew its purport , and I did . It asked me , would I be the mistress of Bleak House . It was not a love letter , though it expressed so much love , but was written just as he would at any time have spoken to me . I saw his face , and heard his voice , and felt the influence of his kind protecting manner in every line . It addressed me as if our places were reversed , as if all the good deeds had been mine and all the feelings they had awakened his . It dwelt on my being young , and he past the prime of life ; on his having attained a ripe age , while I was a child ; on his writing to me with a silvered head , and knowing all this so well as to set it in full before me for mature deliberation . It told me that I would gain nothing by such a marriage and lose nothing by rejecting it , for no new relation could enhance the tenderness in which he held me , and whatever my decision was , he was certain it would be right . But he had considered this step anew since our late confidence and had decided on taking it , if it only served to show me through one poor instance that the whole world would readily unite to falsify the stern prediction of my childhood . I was the last to know what happiness I could bestow upon him , but of that he said no more , for I was always to remember that I owed him nothing and that he was my debtor , and for very much . He had often thought of our future , and foreseeing that the time must come , and fearing that it might come soon , when Ada ( now very nearly of age ) would leave us , and when our present mode of life must be broken up , had become accustomed to reflect on this proposal . Thus he made it . If I felt that I could ever give him the best right he could have to be my protector , and if I felt that I could happily and justly become the dear companion of his remaining life , superior to all lighter chances and changes than death , even then he could not have me bind myself irrevocably while this letter was yet so new to me , but even then I must have ample time for reconsideration . In that case , or in the opposite case , let him be unchanged in his old relation , in his old manner , in the old name by which I called him . And as to his bright Dame Durden and little housekeeper , she would ever be the same , he knew . This was the substance of the letter , written throughout with a justice and a dignity as if he were indeed my responsible guardian impartially representing the proposal of a friend against whom in his integrity he stated the full case . But he did not hint to me that when I had been better looking he had had this same proceeding in his thoughts and had refrained from it . That when my old face was gone from me , and I had no attractions , he could love me just as well as in my fairer days . That the discovery of my birth gave him no shock . That his generosity rose above my disfigurement and my inheritance of shame . That the more I stood in need of such fidelity , the more firmly I might trust in him to the last . But I knew it , I knew it well now . It came upon me as the close of the benignant history I had been pursuing , and I felt that I had but one thing to do . To devote my life to his happiness was to thank him poorly , and what had I wished for the other night but some new means of thanking him ? Still I cried very much , not only in the fullness of my heart after reading the letter , not only in the strangeness of the prospect — for it was strange though I had expected the contents — but as if something for which there was no name or distinct idea were indefinitely lost to me . I was very happy , very thankful , very hopeful ; but I cried very much . By and by I went to my old glass . My eyes were red and swollen , and I said , “
301715	301746	301713	301713	you	280	” I am afraid the face in the glass was going to cry again at this reproach , but I held up my finger at it , and it stopped . “
301770	301781	301763	301763	you	280	” said I , beginning to let down my hair . “
301820	301854	301812	301812	us	6851	” I went on with my hair now , quite comfortably . I sobbed a little still , but that was because I had been crying , not because I was crying then . “
301904	302111	302114	302114	you	6856	” I thought , all at once , if my guardian had married some one else , how should I have felt , and what should I have done ! That would have been a change indeed . It presented my life in such a new and blank form that I rang my housekeeping keys and gave them a kiss before I laid them down in their basket again . Then I went on to think , as I dressed my hair before the glass , how often had I considered within myself that the deep traces of my illness and the circumstances of my birth were only new reasons why I should be busy , busy , busy — useful , amiable , serviceable , in all honest , unpretending ways . This was a good time , to be sure , to sit down morbidly and cry ! As to its seeming at all strange to me at first ( if that were any excuse for crying , which it was not ) that I was one day to be the mistress of Bleak House , why should it seem strange ? Other people had thought of such things , if I had not . “
302121	302131	302114	302114	you	6856	” I asked myself , looking at the glass , “
302145	302648	302133	302134	Mrs. Woodcourt	465	” Perhaps the name brought them to my remembrance . The dried remains of the flowers . It would be better not to keep them now . They had only been preserved in memory of something wholly past and gone , but it would be better not to keep them now . They were in a book , and it happened to be in the next room — our sitting - room , dividing Ada ’s chamber from mine . I took a candle and went softly in to fetch it from its shelf . After I had it in my hand , I saw my beautiful darling , through the open door , lying asleep , and I stole in to kiss her . It was weak in me , I know , and I could have no reason for crying ; but I dropped a tear upon her dear face , and another , and another . Weaker than that , I took the withered flowers out and put them for a moment to her lips . I thought about her love for Richard , though , indeed , the flowers had nothing to do with that . Then I took them into my own room and burned them at the candle , and they were dust in an instant . On entering the breakfast - room next morning , I found my guardian just as usual , quite as frank , as open , and free . There being not the least constraint in his manner , there was none ( or I think there was none ) in mine . I was with him several times in the course of the morning , in and out , when there was no one there , and I thought it not unlikely that he might speak to me about the letter , but he did not say a word . So , on the next morning , and the next , and for at least a week , over which time Mr. Skimpole prolonged his stay . I expected , every day , that my guardian might speak to me about the letter , but he never did . I thought then , growing uneasy , that I ought to write an answer . I tried over and over again in my own room at night , but I could not write an answer that at all began like a good answer , so I thought each night I would wait one more day . And I waited seven more days , and he never said a word . At last , Mr. Skimpole having departed , we three were one afternoon going out for a ride ; and I , being dressed before Ada and going down , came upon my guardian , with his back towards me , standing at the drawing - room window looking out . He turned on my coming in and said , smiling , “
302661	302689	302653	302653	you	6858	” and looked out again . I had made up my mind to speak to him now . In short , I had come down on purpose . “
302692	302701	302690	302690	Guardian	10146	” I said , rather hesitating and trembling , “
302717	302718	302704	302704	you	10146	” “
302727	302731	302732	302732	I	0	” he replied . “
302738	302741	302732	302732	I	0	” said I. “
302748	302753	302743	302743	Charley	336	” he asked pleasantly . “
302764	302956	302762	302762	guardian	10146	” I returned . I put my two arms round his neck and kissed him , and he said was this the mistress of Bleak House , and I said yes ; and it made no difference presently , and we all went out together , and I said nothing to my precious pet about it . CHAPTER XLV In Trust One morning when I had done jingling about with my baskets of keys , as my beauty and I were walking round and round the garden I happened to turn my eyes towards the house and saw a long thin shadow going in which looked like Mr. Vholes . Ada had been telling me only that morning of her hopes that Richard might exhaust his ardour in the Chancery suit by being so very earnest in it ; and therefore , not to damp my dear girl ’s spirits , I said nothing about Mr. Vholes ’s shadow . Presently came Charley , lightly winding among the bushes and tripping along the paths , as rosy and pretty as one of Flora ’s attendants instead of my maid , saying , “
302974	303027	302966	302966	you	6864	” It was one of Charley ’s peculiarities that whenever she was charged with a message she always began to deliver it as soon as she beheld , at any distance , the person for whom it was intended . Therefore I saw Charley asking me in her usual form of words to “
303031	303111	303114	303114	miss	9584	” to Mr. Jarndyce long before I heard her . And when I did hear her , she had said it so often that she was out of breath . I told Ada I would make haste back and inquired of Charley as we went in whether there was not a gentleman with Mr. Jarndyce . To which Charley , whose grammar , I confess to my shame , never did any credit to my educational powers , replied , “
303127	303226	303124	303125	Mr. Richard	291	” A more complete contrast than my guardian and Mr. Vholes I suppose there could not be . I found them looking at one another across a table , the one so open and the other so close , the one so broad and upright and the other so narrow and stooping , the one giving out what he had to say in such a rich ringing voice and the other keeping it in in such a cold - blooded , gasping , fish - like manner that I thought I never had seen two people so unmatched . “
303235	303291	303229	303230	Mr. Vholes	245	” said my guardian . Not with the greatest urbanity , I must say . Mr. Vholes rose , gloved and buttoned up as usual , and seated himself again , just as he had seated himself beside Richard in the gig . Not having Richard to look at , he looked straight before him . “
303295	303314	303292	303293	Mr. Vholes	245	” said my guardian , eyeing his black figure as if he were a bird of ill omen , “
303326	303332	303292	303293	Mr. Vholes	245	” Laying a marked emphasis on “
303335	303381	303292	303293	Mr. Vholes	245	” as if the words were rather descriptive of his connexion with Mr. Vholes . I sat down between them ; Mr. Vholes remained immovable , except that he secretly picked at one of the red pimples on his yellow face with his black glove . “
303398	303403	303405	303405	you	245	” said my guardian , “
303427	303437	303438	303438	I	0	” Doing anything but that , Mr. Vholes observed , “
303632	303670	303699	303699	Esther	280	” Mr. Vholes , who had looked at me while speaking , here emerged into the silence he could hardly be said to have broken , so stifled was his tone , and looked before him again . “
303681	303688	303672	303674	the poor fellow	6880	” said my guardian to me . “
303732	303740	303699	303699	Esther	280	” Mr. Vholes hereupon addressed me again . “
303909	304070	303902	303903	a father	6285	” said Mr. Vholes , who had nearly forgotten that point . It appeared to us that Mr. Vholes said neither more nor less than the truth in intimating that he sought to divide the responsibility , such as it was , of knowing Richard ’s situation . I could only suggest that I should go down to Deal , where Richard was then stationed , and see him , and try if it were possible to avert the worst . Without consulting Mr. Vholes on this point , I took my guardian aside to propose it , while Mr. Vholes gauntly stalked to the fire and warmed his funeral gloves . The fatigue of the journey formed an immediate objection on my guardian ’s part , but as I saw he had no other , and as I was only too happy to go , I got his consent . We had then merely to dispose of Mr. Vholes . “
304075	304080	304073	304073	sir	9496	” said Mr. Jarndyce , “
304116	304117	304102	304102	You	9496	” “
304125	304144	304118	304118	I	0	” said Mr. Vholes , putting out his long black sleeve to check the ringing of the bell , “
304221	304222	304224	304224	I	0	” “
304244	304250	304241	304242	Mr. Vholes	245	” returned my guardian bitterly , “
304258	304305	304241	304242	Mr. Vholes	245	” Mr. Vholes , whose black dye was so deep from head to foot that it had quite steamed before the fire , diffusing a very unpleasant perfume , made a short one - sided inclination of his head from the neck and slowly shook it . “
304382	304394	304379	304380	Mr. C.	614	” I said I would be careful not to do it . “
304411	305356	304403	304404	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” Mr. Vholes put his dead glove , which scarcely seemed to have any hand in it , on my fingers , and then on my guardian ’s fingers , and took his long thin shadow away . I thought of it on the outside of the coach , passing over all the sunny landscape between us and London , chilling the seed in the ground as it glided along . Of course it became necessary to tell Ada where I was going and why I was going , and of course she was anxious and distressed . But she was too true to Richard to say anything but words of pity and words of excuse , and in a more loving spirit still — my dear devoted girl!—she wrote him a long letter , of which I took charge . Charley was to be my travelling companion , though I am sure I wanted none and would willingly have left her at home . We all went to London that afternoon , and finding two places in the mail , secured them . At our usual bed - time , Charley and I were rolling away seaward with the Kentish letters . It was a night ’s journey in those coach times , but we had the mail to ourselves and did not find the night very tedious . It passed with me as I suppose it would with most people under such circumstances . At one while my journey looked hopeful , and at another hopeless . Now I thought I should do some good , and now I wondered how I could ever have supposed so . Now it seemed one of the most reasonable things in the world that I should have come , and now one of the most unreasonable . In what state I should find Richard , what I should say to him , and what he would say to me occupied my mind by turns with these two states of feeling ; and the wheels seemed to play one tune ( to which the burden of my guardian ’s letter set itself ) over and over again all night . At last we came into the narrow streets of Deal , and very gloomy they were upon a raw misty morning . The long flat beach , with its little irregular houses , wooden and brick , and its litter of capstans , and great boats , and sheds , and bare upright poles with tackle and blocks , and loose gravelly waste places overgrown with grass and weeds , wore as dull an appearance as any place I ever saw . The sea was heaving under a thick white fog ; and nothing else was moving but a few early ropemakers , who , with the yarn twisted round their bodies , looked as if , tired of their present state of existence , they were spinning themselves into cordage . But when we got into a warm room in an excellent hotel and sat down , comfortably washed and dressed , to an early breakfast ( for it was too late to think of going to bed ) , Deal began to look more cheerful . Our little room was like a ship ’s cabin , and that delighted Charley very much . Then the fog began to rise like a curtain , and numbers of ships that we had had no idea were near appeared . I do n’t know how many sail the waiter told us were then lying in the downs . Some of these vessels were of grand size — one was a large Indiaman just come home ; and when the sun shone through the clouds , making silvery pools in the dark sea , the way in which these ships brightened , and shadowed , and changed , amid a bustle of boats pulling off from the shore to them and from them to the shore , and a general life and motion in themselves and everything around them , was most beautiful . The large Indiaman was our great attraction because she had come into the downs in the night . She was surrounded by boats , and we said how glad the people on board of her must be to come ashore . Charley was curious , too , about the voyage , and about the heat in India , and the serpents and the tigers ; and as she picked up such information much faster than grammar , I told her what I knew on those points . I told her , too , how people in such voyages were sometimes wrecked and cast on rocks , where they were saved by the intrepidity and humanity of one man . And Charley asking how that could be , I told her how we knew at home of such a case . I had thought of sending Richard a note saying I was there , but it seemed so much better to go to him without preparation . As he lived in barracks I was a little doubtful whether this was feasible , but we went out to reconnoitre . Peeping in at the gate of the barrack - yard , we found everything very quiet at that time in the morning , and I asked a sergeant standing on the guardhouse - steps where he lived . He sent a man before to show me , who went up some bare stairs , and knocked with his knuckles at a door , and left us . “
305360	305387	304403	304404	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” cried Richard from within . So I left Charley in the little passage , and going on to the half - open door , said , “
305401	305535	305398	305399	Dame Durden	343	” He was writing at a table , with a great confusion of clothes , tin cases , books , boots , brushes , and portmanteaus strewn all about the floor . He was only half dressed — in plain clothes , I observed , not in uniform — and his hair was unbrushed , and he looked as wild as his room . All this I saw after he had heartily welcomed me and I was seated near him , for he started upon hearing my voice and caught me in his arms in a moment . Dear Richard ! He was ever the same to me . Down to — ah , poor poor fellow!—to the end , he never received me but with something of his old merry boyish manner . “
305544	305548	305398	305399	Dame Durden	343	” said he , “
305571	305572	305567	305567	Ada	290	” “
305582	305583	305580	305580	Richard	291	” “
305586	305596	305580	305580	Richard	291	” he said , leaning back in his chair . “
305609	305644	305607	305607	Esther	280	” So worn and haggard as he looked , even in the fullness of his handsome youth , leaning back in his chair and crushing the closely written sheet of paper in his hand ! “
305666	305670	305607	305607	Esther	280	” I asked . “
305676	305684	305607	305607	Esther	280	” he returned with a hopeless gesture . “
305700	305737	305741	305741	Esther	280	” I mildly entreated him not to be despondent . I told him that I had heard by chance of his being in difficulty and had come to consult with him what could best be done . “
305752	305760	305750	305750	you	280	” said he with a melancholy smile . “
305823	305824	305825	305825	Richard	291	” “
305827	305831	305825	305825	Richard	291	” I urged , “
305840	305841	305842	305842	Esther	280	” “
305844	305848	305842	305842	Esther	280	” he returned , “
305938	305959	305994	305994	Vholes	245	” he said , tearing the letter he had written into fragments and moodily casting them away , by driblets , “
306002	306042	306045	306046	Dame Durden	343	” I suppose he knew by my face what I was about to say , but he caught the hand I had laid upon his arm and touched my own lips with it to prevent me from going on . “
306174	306215	306170	306170	I	0	” He was in that mood in which I thought it best not to increase his determination ( if anything could increase it ) by opposing him . I took out Ada ’s letter and put it in his hand . “
306223	306340	306170	306170	I	0	” he asked . As I told him yes , he laid it on the table , and resting his head upon his hand , began . He had not read far when he rested his head upon his two hands — to hide his face from me . In a little while he rose as if the light were bad and went to the window . He finished reading it there , with his back towards me , and after he had finished and had folded it up , stood there for some minutes with the letter in his hand . When he came back to his chair , I saw tears in his eyes . “
306353	306369	306349	306349	she	6911	” He spoke in a softened voice and kissed the letter as he asked me . “
306374	306375	306372	306372	Richard	291	” “
306379	306391	306395	306395	she	6911	” he went on , tapping his foot upon the floor , “
306434	306435	306436	306436	I	0	” “
306449	306452	306436	306436	I	0	” said I. “
306468	306469	306461	306461	Ada	290	” “
306484	306557	306476	306476	I	0	” He went back to the window , and laying his arm across it , leaned his head down on his arm . It greatly affected me to see him so , but I hoped he might become more yielding , and I remained silent . My experience was very limited ; I was not at all prepared for his rousing himself out of this emotion to a new sense of injury . “
306586	306591	306566	306567	John Jarndyce	248	” said he indignantly . “
306635	306636	306637	306637	Richard	291	” “
306639	306647	306637	306637	Richard	291	” I cried out , rising hastily . “
306658	306708	306652	306652	you	291	” I was very angry with him indeed , for the first time in my life , but it only lasted a moment . When I saw his worn young face looking at me as if he were sorry , I put my hand on his shoulder and said , “
306729	306779	306787	306787	Esther	280	” He blamed himself exceedingly and told me in the most generous manner that he had been very wrong and that he begged my pardon a thousand times . At that I laughed , but trembled a little too , for I was rather fluttered after being so fiery . “
306789	306802	306787	306787	Esther	280	” said he , sitting down beside me and resuming our conversation , “
306923	306952	306905	306905	he	245	” His sanguine hopes were rising within him and lighting up his features , but they made his face more sad to me than it had been before . “
306957	306962	306905	306905	he	245	” cried Richard exultingly . “
307145	307509	307510	307510	Charley	336	” I will not repeat what I said to Richard . I know it was tiresome , and nobody is to suppose for a moment that it was at all wise . It only came from my heart . He heard it patiently and feelingly , but I saw that on the two subjects he had reserved it was at present hopeless to make any representation to him . I saw too , and had experienced in this very interview , the sense of my guardian ’s remark that it was even more mischievous to use persuasion with him than to leave him as he was . Therefore I was driven at last to asking Richard if he would mind convincing me that it really was all over there , as he had said , and that it was not his mere impression . He showed me without hesitation a correspondence making it quite plain that his retirement was arranged . I found , from what he told me , that Mr. Vholes had copies of these papers and had been in consultation with him throughout . Beyond ascertaining this , and having been the bearer of Ada ’s letter , and being ( as I was going to be ) Richard ’s companion back to London , I had done no good by coming down . Admitting this to myself with a reluctant heart , I said I would return to the hotel and wait until he joined me there , so he threw a cloak over his shoulders and saw me to the gate , and Charley and I went back along the beach . There was a concourse of people in one spot , surrounding some naval officers who were landing from a boat , and pressing about them with unusual interest . I said to Charley this would be one of the great Indiaman ’s boats now , and we stopped to look . The gentlemen came slowly up from the waterside , speaking good - humouredly to each other and to the people around and glancing about them as if they were glad to be in England again . “
307514	307518	307512	307512	Charley	336	” said I , “
307522	307634	307635	307635	My	0	” And I hurried on so swiftly that my little maid was surprised . It was not until we were shut up in our cabin - room and I had had time to take breath that I began to think why I had made such haste . In one of the sunburnt faces I had recognized Mr. Allan Woodcourt , and I had been afraid of his recognizing me . I had been unwilling that he should see my altered looks . I had been taken by surprise , and my courage had quite failed me . But I knew this would not do , and I now said to myself , “
307706	307807	307700	307700	Esther	280	” I was in a great tremble — with running — and at first was quite unable to calm myself ; but I got better , and I was very glad to know it . The party came to the hotel . I heard them speaking on the staircase . I was sure it was the same gentlemen because I knew their voices again — I mean I knew Mr. Woodcourt ’s . It would still have been a great relief to me to have gone away without making myself known , but I was determined not to do so . “
307821	307908	307909	307909	You	6922	” I untied my bonnet and put my veil half up — I think I mean half down , but it matters very little — and wrote on one of my cards that I happened to be there with Mr. Richard Carstone , and I sent it in to Mr. Woodcourt . He came immediately . I told him I was rejoiced to be by chance among the first to welcome him home to England . And I saw that he was very sorry for me . “
307924	307928	307921	307922	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” said I , “
307981	307982	307985	307987	Little Miss Flite	376	” “
307989	307993	307985	307987	Little Miss Flite	376	” he said . “
308001	308002	307994	307994	She	6924	” “
308007	308030	307994	307994	She	6924	” I was so comfortable with myself now as not to mind the veil and to be able to put it aside . “
308056	308057	308042	308042	She	6924	” “
308066	308070	308071	308071	I	0	” he returned . “
308079	308093	308073	308073	I	0	” He was so very sorry for me that he could scarcely speak . “
308098	308102	308094	308094	I	0	” said I , “
308121	308122	308123	308123	I	0	” “
308135	308136	308137	308137	I	0	” “
308142	308143	308137	308137	I	0	” “
308150	308151	308145	308145	you	440	” “
308162	308165	308152	308152	I	0	” said I. “
308197	308612	308613	308613	I	0	” I felt as if he had greater commiseration for me than I had ever had for myself . It inspired me with new fortitude and new calmness to find that it was I who was under the necessity of reassuring him . I spoke to him of his voyage out and home , and of his future plans , and of his probable return to India . He said that was very doubtful . He had not found himself more favoured by fortune there than here . He had gone out a poor ship ’s surgeon and had come home nothing better . While we were talking , and when I was glad to believe that I had alleviated ( if I may use such a term ) the shock he had had in seeing me , Richard came in . He had heard downstairs who was with me , and they met with cordial pleasure . I saw that after their first greetings were over , and when they spoke of Richard ’s career , Mr. Woodcourt had a perception that all was not going well with him . He frequently glanced at his face as if there were something in it that gave him pain , and more than once he looked towards me as though he sought to ascertain whether I knew what the truth was . Yet Richard was in one of his sanguine states and in good spirits and was thoroughly pleased to see Mr. Woodcourt again , whom he had always liked . Richard proposed that we all should go to London together ; but Mr. Woodcourt , having to remain by his ship a little longer , could not join us . He dined with us , however , at an early hour , and became so much more like what he used to be that I was still more at peace to think I had been able to soften his regrets . Yet his mind was not relieved of Richard . When the coach was almost ready and Richard ran down to look after his luggage , he spoke to me about him . I was not sure that I had a right to lay his whole story open , but I referred in a few words to his estrangement from Mr Jarndyce and to his being entangled in the ill - fated Chancery suit . Mr. Woodcourt listened with interest and expressed his regret . “
308621	308625	308615	308615	you	6929	” said I , “
308633	308634	308627	308627	you	6929	” “
308639	308679	308635	308635	He	6930	” he returned , shaking his head . I felt the blood rush into my face for the first time , but it was only an instantaneous emotion . I turned my head aside , and it was gone . “
308684	308689	308690	308690	his	6930	” said Mr. Woodcourt , “
308754	308755	308756	308756	You	6929	” “
308764	308775	308756	308756	You	6929	” said I. No . He looked robust in body . “
308794	308798	308756	308756	You	6929	” I proceeded . “
308808	308809	308802	308802	you	440	” “
308818	308819	308802	308802	you	440	” “
308891	308892	308888	308889	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” “
308896	308910	308888	308889	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” he said , more moved than he had been from the first , “
308939	308940	308943	308943	you	440	” “
308945	308968	308969	308969	Ada	290	” said I , with my eyes filling fast ; but I thought they might , when it was not for myself . “
309007	309030	309031	309031	Woodcourt	440	” Richard came back as we finished exchanging these hurried words and gave me his arm to take me to the coach . “
309033	309042	309031	309031	Woodcourt	440	” he said , unconscious with what application , “
309050	309051	309031	309031	Woodcourt	440	” “
309054	309059	309031	309031	Woodcourt	440	” returned the other . “
309076	309077	309072	309072	I	0	” “
309089	309095	309031	309031	Woodcourt	440	” said Richard , pondering . “
309105	309106	309031	309031	Woodcourt	440	” “
309114	310121	309031	309031	Woodcourt	440	” They shook hands heartily . When I was seated in the coach and Richard was yet standing in the street , Mr. Woodcourt laid his friendly hand on Richard ’s shoulder and looked at me . I understood him and waved mine in thanks . And in his last look as we drove away , I saw that he was very sorry for me . I was glad to see it . I felt for my old self as the dead may feel if they ever revisit these scenes . I was glad to be tenderly remembered , to be gently pitied , not to be quite forgotten . CHAPTER XLVI Stop Him ! Darkness rests upon Tom - All - Alone ’s . Dilating and dilating since the sun went down last night , it has gradually swelled until it fills every void in the place . For a time there were some dungeon lights burning , as the lamp of life hums in Tom - all - Alone ’s , heavily , heavily , in the nauseous air , and winking — as that lamp , too , winks in Tom - all - Alone’s — at many horrible things . But they are blotted out . The moon has eyed Tom with a dull cold stare , as admitting some puny emulation of herself in his desert region unfit for life and blasted by volcanic fires ; but she has passed on and is gone . The blackest nightmare in the infernal stables grazes on Tom - all - Alone ’s , and Tom is fast asleep . Much mighty speech - making there has been , both in and out of Parliament , concerning Tom , and much wrathful disputation how Tom shall be got right . Whether he shall be put into the main road by constables , or by beadles , or by bell - ringing , or by force of figures , or by correct principles of taste , or by high church , or by low church , or by no church ; whether he shall be set to splitting trusses of polemical straws with the crooked knife of his mind or whether he shall be put to stone - breaking instead . In the midst of which dust and noise there is but one thing perfectly clear , to wit , that Tom only may and can , or shall and will , be reclaimed according to somebody ’s theory but nobody ’s practice . And in the hopeful meantime , Tom goes to perdition head foremost in his old determined spirit . But he has his revenge . Even the winds are his messengers , and they serve him in these hours of darkness . There is not a drop of Tom ’s corrupted blood but propagates infection and contagion somewhere . It shall pollute , this very night , the choice stream ( in which chemists on analysis would find the genuine nobility ) of a Norman house , and his Grace shall not be able to say nay to the infamous alliance . There is not an atom of Tom ’s slime , not a cubic inch of any pestilential gas in which he lives , not one obscenity or degradation about him , not an ignorance , not a wickedness , not a brutality of his committing , but shall work its retribution through every order of society up to the proudest of the proud and to the highest of the high . Verily , what with tainting , plundering , and spoiling , Tom has his revenge . It is a moot point whether Tom - all - Alone ’s be uglier by day or by night , but on the argument that the more that is seen of it the more shocking it must be , and that no part of it left to the imagination is at all likely to be made so bad as the reality , day carries it . The day begins to break now ; and in truth it might be better for the national glory even that the sun should sometimes set upon the British dominions than that it should ever rise upon so vile a wonder as Tom . A brown sunburnt gentleman , who appears in some inaptitude for sleep to be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless pillow , strolls hitherward at this quiet time . Attracted by curiosity , he often pauses and looks about him , up and down the miserable by - ways . Nor is he merely curious , for in his bright dark eye there is compassionate interest ; and as he looks here and there , he seems to understand such wretchedness and to have studied it before . On the banks of the stagnant channel of mud which is the main street of Tom - all - Alone ’s , nothing is to be seen but the crazy houses , shut up and silent . No waking creature save himself appears except in one direction , where he sees the solitary figure of a woman sitting on a door - step . He walks that way . Approaching , he observes that she has journeyed a long distance and is footsore and travel - stained . She sits on the door - step in the manner of one who is waiting , with her elbow on her knee and her head upon her hand . Beside her is a canvas bag , or bundle , she has carried . She is dozing probably , for she gives no heed to his steps as he comes toward her . The broken footway is so narrow that when Allan Woodcourt comes to where the woman sits , he has to turn into the road to pass her . Looking down at her face , his eye meets hers , and he stops . “
310127	310128	309031	309031	Woodcourt	440	” “
310133	310134	309031	309031	Woodcourt	440	” “
310150	310151	310143	310143	you	9496	” “
310171	310177	310152	310152	I	0	” the woman patiently returns . “
310193	310194	310195	310195	I	0	” “
310213	310214	310202	310202	I	0	” “
310225	310277	310279	310279	me	0	” A habit in him of speaking to the poor and of avoiding patronage or condescension or childishness ( which is the favourite device , many people deeming it quite a subtlety to talk to them like little spelling books ) has put him on good terms with the woman easily . “
310285	310292	310279	310279	me	0	” he says , bending down . “
310312	310341	310303	310303	I	0	” He knows that by touching her with his skilful and accustomed hand he can soothe her yet more readily . She makes a slight objection , saying , “
310345	310367	310303	310303	I	0	” ; but he has scarcely laid his fingers on the wounded place when she lifts it up to the light . “
310386	310387	310303	310303	I	0	” “
310396	310408	310394	310394	sir	9496	” returns the woman with a started tear upon her cheek . “
310425	310426	310418	310418	My	0	” “
310440	310502	310434	310434	I	0	” He cleanses the injured place and dries it , and having carefully examined it and gently pressed it with the palm of his hand , takes a small case from his pocket , dresses it , and binds it up . While he is thus employed , he says , after laughing at his establishing a surgery in the street , “
310511	310512	310508	310509	a brickmaker	5147	” “
310521	310528	310515	310515	you	9496	” asks the woman , astonished . “
310577	310622	310570	310570	them	3940	” The woman hastily lifts up her eyes as if she would deny that her injury is referable to such a cause . But feeling the hand upon her forehead , and seeing his busy and composed face , she quietly drops them again . “
310628	310633	310570	310570	them	3940	” asks the surgeon . “
310655	310656	310644	310644	he	6956	” “
310711	310718	310705	310705	You	9496	” The woman shakes her head . “
310733	310734	310730	310730	Liz	395	” “
310747	310761	310743	310745	Poor little thing	3877	” By this time he has finished and is putting up his case . “
310776	310797	310740	310740	I	0	” he asks , good - humouredly making light of what he has done as she gets up and curtsys . “
310837	310838	310826	310826	you	9496	” “
310865	310866	310869	310869	sir	9496	” “
310871	310875	310869	310869	sir	9496	” she says , “
310880	311237	311239	311239	him	6971	” And she shows it . He tells her , in acknowledgment of her many subdued thanks , that she is very welcome , gives her good day , and walks away . Tom - all - Alone ’s is still asleep , and nothing is astir . Yes , something is ! As he retraces his way to the point from which he descried the woman at a distance sitting on the step , he sees a ragged figure coming very cautiously along , crouching close to the soiled walls — which the wretchedest figure might as well avoid — and furtively thrusting a hand before it . It is the figure of a youth whose face is hollow and whose eyes have an emaciated glare . He is so intent on getting along unseen that even the apparition of a stranger in whole garments does not tempt him to look back . He shades his face with his ragged elbow as he passes on the other side of the way , and goes shrinking and creeping on with his anxious hand before him and his shapeless clothes hanging in shreds . Clothes made for what purpose , or of what material , it would be impossible to say . They look , in colour and in substance , like a bundle of rank leaves of swampy growth that rotted long ago . Allan Woodcourt pauses to look after him and note all this , with a shadowy belief that he has seen the boy before . He can not recall how or where , but there is some association in his mind with such a form . He imagines that he must have seen it in some hospital or refuge , still , can not make out why it comes with any special force on his remembrance . He is gradually emerging from Tom - all - Alone ’s in the morning light , thinking about it , when he hears running feet behind him , and looking round , sees the boy scouring towards him at great speed , followed by the woman . “
311244	311252	311239	311239	him	6971	” cries the woman , almost breathless . “
311258	311312	311239	311239	him	6971	” He darts across the road into the boy ’s path , but the boy is quicker than he , makes a curve , ducks , dives under his hands , comes up half - a - dozen yards beyond him , and scours away again . Still the woman follows , crying , “
311322	311467	311470	311470	you	9496	” Allan , not knowing but that he has just robbed her of her money , follows in chase and runs so hard that he runs the boy down a dozen times , but each time he repeats the curve , the duck , the dive , and scours away again . To strike at him on any of these occasions would be to fell and disable him , but the pursuer can not resolve to do that , and so the grimly ridiculous pursuit continues . At last the fugitive , hard - pressed , takes to a narrow passage and a court which has no thoroughfare . Here , against a hoarding of decaying timber , he is brought to bay and tumbles down , lying gasping at his pursuer , who stands and gasps at him until the woman comes up . “
311474	311479	311470	311470	you	9496	” cries the woman . “
311489	311490	311491	311491	Jo	389	” “
311493	311503	311504	311504	Jo	389	” repeats Allan , looking at him with attention , “
311525	311526	311512	311512	I	0	” “
311538	311542	311529	311529	I	0	” whimpers Jo . “
311692	311751	311752	311753	Miserable creature	6982	” He says it with such a pitiable air , and his grimy tears appear so real , and he lies in the corner up against the hoarding so like a growth of fungus or any unwholesome excrescence produced there in neglect and impurity , that Allan Woodcourt is softened towards him . He says to the woman , “
311760	311779	311757	311757	he	3527	” To which she only replies , shaking her head at the prostrate figure more amazedly than angrily , “
311795	311796	311788	311788	I	0	” “
311802	311806	311799	311799	he	3527	” says Allan . “
311812	311813	311808	311808	he	3527	” “
311843	311869	311823	311823	He	3527	” Allan looks from Jo to the woman , and from the woman to Jo , waiting for one of them to unravel the riddle . “
311879	311884	311871	311871	he	3527	” says the woman . “
311933	311944	311947	311947	sir	9496	” Allan shrinks back from him with a sudden horror . “
312065	312146	312147	312147	Richard	291	” demands the woman , beginning to rage at him as she recalls it and breaking into passionate tears . The boy , in rough sort stunned by what he hears , falls to smearing his dirty forehead with his dirty palm , and to staring at the ground , and to shaking from head to foot until the crazy hoarding against which he leans rattles . Allan restrains the woman , merely by a quiet gesture , but effectually . “
312151	312155	312147	312147	Richard	291	” He falters . “
312177	312228	312232	312232	she	7001	” He turns away and stands for a while looking out at the covered passage . When he comes back , he has recovered his composure , except that he contends against an avoidance of the boy , which is so very remarkable that it absorbs the woman ’s attention . “
312242	312294	312298	312298	she	7001	” Jo , shaking and chattering , slowly rises and stands , after the manner of his tribe in a difficulty , sideways against the hoarding , resting one of his high shoulders against it and covertly rubbing his right hand over his left and his left foot over his right . “
312315	312316	312309	312309	you	7000	” “
312332	312337	312319	312319	I	0	” replies Jo hoarsely . “
312345	312368	312340	312340	you	7000	” Jo looks all round the confined court , looks at his questioner no higher than the knees , and finally answers , “
312461	312462	312448	312448	she	364	” “
312469	312501	312448	312448	she	364	” Jo looks all round the court again , looks at his questioner ’s knees again , and concludes by laying his profile against the hoarding in a sort of resignation . “
312514	312515	312505	312505	me	0	” “
312519	312523	312505	312505	me	0	” says Jo . “
312528	312557	312559	312559	me	0	” proceeds Allan , making a strong effort to overcome his repugnance , going very near to him , and leaning over him with an expression of confidence , “
312587	312709	312559	312559	me	0	” Jo suddenly comes out of his resignation and excitedly declares , addressing the woman , that he never known about the young lady , that he never heern about it , that he never went fur to hurt her , that he would sooner have hurt his own self , that he ’d sooner have had his unfortnet ed chopped off than ever gone a - nigh her , and that she wos wery good to him , she wos . Conducting himself throughout as if in his poor fashion he really meant it , and winding up with some very miserable sobs . Allan Woodcourt sees that this is not a sham . He constrains himself to touch him . “
312717	312718	312712	312712	Jo	389	” “
312724	312734	312735	312735	I	0	” says Jo , relapsing into the profile state . “
312742	312743	312739	312739	I	0	” “
312749	312754	312745	312745	I	0	” returns the other , “
312763	312791	312761	312761	Jo	389	” After two or three such adjurations , Jo lifts up his head again , looks round the court again , and says in a low voice , “
312807	312808	312739	312739	I	0	” “
312816	312817	312878	312878	him	0	” “
312820	312867	312878	312878	him	0	” Very apprehensive of being overheard , Jo looks about him and even glances up some ten feet at the top of the hoarding and through the cracks in it lest the object of his distrust should be looking over or hidden on the other side . “
312873	312874	312875	312875	I	0	” “

312892	312918	312885	312885	I	0	“ But I want , in the young lady ’s name , to know . You may trust me . No one else shall hear . ”
312919	312928	312930	312930	Jo	389	“ Ah , but I do n’t know , ”
312937	312943	312930	312930	Jo	389	“ as he DON’T hear . ”
312944	312954	312885	312885	I	0	“ Why , he is not in this place . ”
312955	312963	312965	312965	Jo	389	“ Oh , ai n’t he though ? ”
312967	312980	312965	312965	Jo	389	“ He ’s in all manner of places , all at wanst . ”

313041	313050	313039	313039	Allan	440	“ Why , what had you been doing ? ”
313051	313106	313012	313012	Jo	389	“ Nothink , sir . Never done nothink to get myself into no trouble , ’ sept in not moving on and the inkwhich . But I ’m a - moving on now . I ’m a - moving on to the berryin ground — that ’s the move as I ’m up to . ”
313107	313127	313012	313012	Jo	389	“ No , no , we will try to prevent that . But what did he do with you ? ”
313128	313135	313137	313137	Jo	389	“ Put me in a horsepittle , ”
313141	313249	313251	313251	Jo	389	“ till I was discharged , then giv me a little money — four half - bulls , wot you may call half - crowns — and ses ‘ Hook it ! Nobody wants you here , ’ he ses . ‘ You hook it . You go and tramp , ’ he ses . ‘ You move on , ’ he ses . ‘ Do n’t let me ever see you nowheres within forty mile of London , or you ’ll repent it . ’ So I shall , if ever he doos see me , and he ’ll see me if I ’m above ground , ”
313282	313307	313262	313262	Allan	440	“ He is not so ungrateful as you supposed . He had a reason for going away , though it was an insufficient one . ”
313308	313315	313317	313317	Jo	389	“ Thankee , sir , thankee ! ”
313319	313363	313317	313317	Jo	389	“ There now ! See how hard you wos upon me . But ony you tell the young lady wot the genlmn ses , and it ’s all right . For YOU wos wery good to me too , and I knows it . ”
313364	313369	313371	313371	Allan	440	“ Now , Jo , ”
313379	313434	313371	313371	Allan	440	“ come with me and I will find you a better place than this to lie down and hide in . If I take one side of the way and you the other to avoid observation , you will not run away , I know very well , if you make me a promise . ”
313435	313453	313317	313317	Jo	389	“ I wo n’t , not unless I wos to see HIM a - coming , sir . ”

313497	313513	313514	313514	She	7012	“ Good day again , sir , and I thank you kindly many times again . ”
313537	313558	313533	313533	Jo	389	“ Ony you tell the young lady as I never went fur to hurt her and wot the genlmn ses ! ”
313686	313694	313695	313695	he	440	“ It surely is a strange fact , ”
313698	313724	313695	313695	he	440	“ that in the heart of a civilized world this creature in human form should be more difficult to dispose of than an unowned dog . ”
313963	313975	313977	313977	Jo	389	“ I thought I was amost a - starvin , sir , ”
313985	314011	313977	313977	Jo	389	“ but I do n’t know nothink — not even that . I do n’t care for eating wittles nor yet for drinking on ’em . ”
314036	314042	314026	314026	his	440	“ Draw breath , Jo ! ”
314043	314047	314049	314049	Jo	389	“ It draws , ”
314051	314058	314049	314049	Jo	389	“ as heavy as a cart . ”
314063	314069	314071	314071	he	440	“ And rattles like it , ”
314075	314085	314071	314071	he	440	“ I ’m a - moving on , sir . ”
314141	314150	314152	314152	Allan	440	“ We may repeat that dose , Jo , ”
314161	314179	314157	314157	his	440	“ So ! Now we will take five minutes ’ rest , and then go on again . ”
314494	314499	314501	314502	Miss Flite	376	“ My dear physician ! ”
314504	314513	314514	314514	She	376	“ My meritorious , distinguished , honourable officer ! ”
314576	314603	314561	314561	Jo	389	“ Where can I lodge him hereabouts for the present ? Now , you have a fund of knowledge and good sense and can advise me . ”
314645	314648	314650	314651	Miss Flite	376	“ Gridley ! ”
314664	314685	314654	314654	her	376	“ Gridley ! To be sure ! Of course ! My dear physician ! General George will help us out . ”
314897	314903	314905	314906	Mr. George	500	“ Your servant , sir , ”
314959	314965	314953	314953	He	500	“ Your servant , sir ! ”
314970	314982	314984	314985	Mr. George	500	“ Excuse me , sir . A sailor , I believe ? ”
314987	315000	315002	315002	Allan	440	“ I am proud to find I have the air of one , ”
315004	315015	315002	315002	Allan	440	“ but I am only a sea - going doctor . ”
315016	315034	315035	315035	Allan	440	“ Indeed , sir ! I should have thought you was a regular blue - jacket myself . ”
315075	315083	315085	315086	the trooper	12478	“ You are very good , sir , ”
315088	315112	315085	315086	the trooper	12478	“ As I know by experience that it ’s not disagreeable to Miss Flite , and since it ’s equally agreeable to yourself — ”
315146	315158	315159	315159	he	12478	“ And that ’s the lad , sir , is it ? ”
315189	315194	315196	315196	Allan	440	“ That ’s he , ”
315198	315298	315196	315196	Allan	440	“ And , Mr. George , I am in this difficulty about him . I am unwilling to place him in a hospital , even if I could procure him immediate admission , because I foresee that he would not stay there many hours if he could be so much as got there . The same objection applies to a workhouse , supposing I had the patience to be evaded and shirked , and handed about from post to pillar in trying to get him into one , which is a system that I do n’t take kindly to . ”
315299	315306	315308	315309	Mr. George	500	“ No man does , sir , ”
315311	315362	315308	315309	Mr. George	500	“ I am convinced that he would not remain in either place , because he is possessed by an extraordinary terror of this person who ordered him to keep out of the way ; in his ignorance , he believes this person to be everywhere , and cognizant of everything . ”
315363	315371	315373	315374	Mr. George	500	“ I ask your pardon , sir , ”
315376	315394	315373	315374	Mr. George	500	“ But you have not mentioned that party ’s name . Is it a secret , sir ? ”
315395	315408	315308	315309	Mr. George	500	“ The boy makes it one . But his name is Bucket . ”
315409	315416	315373	315374	Mr. George	500	“ Bucket the detective , sir ? ”
315417	315422	315373	315374	Mr. George	500	“ The same man . ”
315423	315433	315435	315436	the trooper	12478	“ The man is known to me , sir , ”
315449	315466	315467	315468	Mr. George	500	“ and the boy is so far correct that he undoubtedly is a — rum customer . ”
315483	315564	315566	315566	Allan	440	“ Now , I wish Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson at least to know that this Jo , who tells so strange a story , has reappeared , and to have it in their power to speak with him if they should desire to do so . Therefore I want to get him , for the present moment , into any poor lodging kept by decent people where he would be admitted . Decent people and Jo , Mr. George , ”
315580	315619	315566	315566	Allan	440	“ have not been much acquainted , as you see . Hence the difficulty . Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand ? ”
315689	315694	315696	315697	Mr. George	500	“ Well , sir , ”
315699	315849	315696	315697	Mr. George	500	“ I can assure you that I would willingly be knocked on the head at any time if it would be at all agreeable to Miss Summerson , and consequently I esteem it a privilege to do that young lady any service , however small . We are naturally in the vagabond way here , sir , both myself and Phil . You see what the place is . You are welcome to a quiet corner of it for the boy if the same would meet your views . No charge made , except for rations . We are not in a flourishing state of circumstances here , sir . We are liable to be tumbled out neck and crop at a moment ’s notice . However , sir , such as the place is , and so long as it lasts , here it is at your service . ”
315870	315879	315880	315880	he	500	“ I take it for granted , sir , ”
315883	315903	315880	315880	he	500	“ you being one of the medical staff , that there is no present infection about this unfortunate subject ? ”
315911	315916	315918	315919	Mr. George	500	“ Because , sir , ”
315926	315934	315922	315922	his	500	“ we have had enough of that . ”
315947	315956	315958	315958	Allan	440	“ Still I am bound to tell you , ”
315965	315994	315958	315958	Allan	440	“ that the boy is deplorably low and reduced and that he may be — I do not say that he is — too far gone to recover . ”
315995	316006	316008	316009	the trooper	12478	“ Do you consider him in present danger , sir ? ”
316011	316018	316008	316009	the trooper	12478	“ Yes , I fear so . ”
316019	316024	316026	316027	the trooper	12478	“ Then , sir , ”
316033	316068	316026	316027	the trooper	12478	“ it appears to me — being naturally in the vagabond way myself — that the sooner he comes out of the street , the better . You , Phil ! Bring him in ! ”
316352	316358	316360	316360	Allan	440	“ Look here , Jo ! ”
316362	316368	316360	316360	Allan	440	“ This is Mr. George . ”
316390	316410	316369	316369	Jo	389	“ He is a kind friend to you , for he is going to give you lodging room here . ”
316450	316454	316445	316445	he	389	“ wery thankful . ”
316455	316493	316509	316509	his	389	“ You are quite safe here . All you have to do at present is to be obedient and to get strong . And mind you tell us the truth here , whatever you do , Jo . ”
316494	316503	316505	316505	Jo	389	“ Wishermaydie if I do n’t , sir , ”
316513	316554	316505	316505	Jo	389	“ I never done nothink yit , but wot you knows on , to get myself into no trouble . I never was in no other trouble at all , sir , ’ sept not knowin ’ nothink and starwation . ”
316555	316576	316509	316509	his	389	“ I believe it , now attend to Mr. George . I see he is going to speak to you . ”
316577	316585	316587	316588	Mr. George	500	“ My intention merely was , sir , ”
316595	316620	316587	316588	Mr. George	500	“ to point out to him where he can lie down and get a thorough good dose of sleep . Now , look here . ”
316644	316677	316626	316626	he	500	“ There you are , you see ! Here is a mattress , and here you may rest , on good behaviour , as long as Mr. , I ask your pardon , sir”—he
316686	316725	316727	316728	the trooper	12478	him—“Mr . Woodcourt pleases . Do n’t you be alarmed if you hear shots ; they ’ll be aimed at the target , and not you . Now , there ’s another thing I would recommend , sir , ”
316735	316741	316727	316728	the trooper	12478	“ Phil , come here ! ”
316753	316800	316742	316742	Phil	509	“ Here is a man , sir , who was found , when a baby , in the gutter . Consequently , it is to be expected that he takes a natural interest in this poor creature . You do , do n’t you , Phil ? ”
316801	316810	316812	316812	Phil	509	“ Certainly and surely I do , guv’ner , ”
316816	316824	316826	316827	Mr. George	500	“ Now I was thinking , sir , ”
316853	316882	316837	316837	he	500	“ that if this man was to take him to a bath and was to lay out a few shillings in getting him one or two coarse articles — ”
316883	316891	316893	316893	Allan	440	“ Mr. George , my considerate friend , ”
316900	316911	316893	316893	Allan	440	“ it is the very favour I would have asked . ”
316974	316997	316998	316998	Allan	440	“ which you know , my dear physician , and general , after so many years , would be too absurdly unfortunate ! ”
317041	317048	317050	317051	Mr. George	500	“ I take it , sir , ”
317053	317062	317050	317051	Mr. George	500	“ that you know Miss Summerson pretty well ? ”
317068	317076	317050	317051	Mr. George	500	“ Not related to her , sir ? ”
317082	317088	317090	317091	Mr. George	500	“ Excuse the apparent curiosity , ”
317093	317134	317090	317091	Mr. George	500	“ It seemed to me probable that you might take more than a common interest in this poor creature because Miss Summerson had taken that unfortunate interest in him . ’ Tis MY case , sir , I assure you . ”
317135	317142	317143	317144	The trooper	12478	“ And mine , Mr. George . ”
317171	317233	317234	317234	Allan	440	“ Since you have been out , sir , I have been thinking that I unquestionably know the rooms in Lincoln ’s Inn Fields , where Bucket took the lad , according to his account . Though he is not acquainted with the name , I can help you to it . It ’s Tulkinghorn . That ’s what it is . ”
317244	317292	317234	317234	Allan	440	“ Tulkinghorn . That ’s the name , sir . I know the man , and know him to have been in communication with Bucket before , respecting a deceased person who had given him offence . I know the man , sir . To my sorrow . ”
317303	317316	317293	317293	Allan	440	“ What kind of man ! Do you mean to look at ? ”
317317	317340	317354	317355	the trooper	12478	“ I think I know that much of him . I mean to deal with . Generally , what kind of man ? ”
317341	317352	317354	317355	the trooper	12478	“ Why , then I ’ll tell you , sir , ”
317378	317454	317354	317355	the trooper	12478	“ he is a confoundedly bad kind of man . He is a slow - torturing kind of man . He is no more like flesh and blood than a rusty old carbine is . He is a kind of man — by George!—that has caused me more restlessness , and more uneasiness , and more dissatisfaction with myself than all other men put together . That ’s the kind of man Mr. Tulkinghorn is ! ”
317455	317460	317462	317462	Allan	440	“ I am sorry , ”
317464	317473	317462	317462	Allan	440	“ to have touched so sore a place . ”
317474	317477	317478	317479	The trooper	12478	“ Sore ? ”
317503	317710	317711	317712	the trooper	12478	“ It ’s no fault of yours , sir ; but you shall judge . He has got a power over me . He is the man I spoke of just now as being able to tumble me out of this place neck and crop . He keeps me on a constant see - saw . He wo n’t hold off , and he wo n’t come on . If I have a payment to make him , or time to ask him for , or anything to go to him about , he do n’t see me , do n’t hear me — passes me on to Melchisedech ’s in Clifford ’s Inn , Melchisedech ’s in Clifford ’s Inn passes me back again to him — he keeps me prowling and dangling about him as if I was made of the same stone as himself . Why , I spend half my life now , pretty well , loitering and dodging about his door . What does he care ? Nothing . Just as much as the rusty old carbine I have compared him to . He chafes and goads me till — Bah ! Nonsense ! I am forgetting myself . Mr. Woodcourt , ”
317717	317777	317711	317712	the trooper	12478	“ all I say is , he is an old man ; but I am glad I shall never have the chance of setting spurs to my horse and riding at him in a fair field . For if I had that chance , in one of the humours he drives me into — he’d go down , sir ! ”
318025	318038	318040	318040	Jo	389	“ Let me lay here quiet and not be chivied no more , ”
318042	318117	318040	318040	Jo	389	“ and be so kind any person as is a - passin nigh where I used fur to sleep , as jist to say to Mr. Sangsby that Jo , wot he known once , is a - moving on right forards with his duty , and I ’ll be wery thankful . I ’d be more thankful than I am aready if it wos any ways possible for an unfortnet to be it . ”
318267	318277	318278	318279	The stationer	3664	“ You do n’t remember me , Mr. Snagsby ? ”
318306	318342	318349	318350	Allan Woodcourt	440	“ No , sir , I ca n’t say I do . I should have considered — not to put too fine a point upon it — that I never saw you before , sir . ”
318343	318347	318349	318350	Allan Woodcourt	440	“ Twice before , ”
318352	318362	318349	318350	Allan Woodcourt	440	“ Once at a poor bedside , and once — ”
318363	318370	318372	318374	the afflicted stationer	7103	“ It ’s come at last ! ”
318382	318396	318372	318374	the afflicted stationer	7103	“ It ’s got to a head now and is going to burst ! ”
318420	318429	318398	318398	he	7103	“ Are you a married man , sir ? ”
318430	318437	318372	318374	the afflicted stationer	7103	“ No , I am not . ”
318438	318448	318450	318451	Mr. Snagsby	362	“ Would you make the attempt , though single , ”
318457	318487	318450	318451	Mr. Snagsby	362	“ to speak as low as you can ? For my little woman is a - listening somewheres , or I ’ll forfeit the business and five hundred pound ! ”
318508	318602	318491	318492	Mr. Snagsby	362	“ I never had a secret of my own , sir . I ca n’t charge my memory with ever having once attempted to deceive my little woman on my own account since she named the day . I would n’t have done it , sir . Not to put too fine a point upon it , I could n’t have done it , I dursn’t have done it . Whereas , and nevertheless , I find myself wrapped round with secrecy and mystery , till my life is a burden to me . ”
318633	318659	318661	318662	Mr. Snagsby	362	“ You could n’t name an individual human being — except myself — that my little woman is more set and determined against than Jo , ”
318668	318671	318673	318674	Mr. Snagsby	362	“ Why ? ”

Then comes another certain person , in the person of yourself , and charges me , in an equally solemn way , not to mention Jo to that other certain person above all other persons . Why , this is a private asylum ! Why , not to put too fine a point upon it , this is Bedlam , sir ! ”

Mr. Chadbands he wos a - prayin wunst at Mr. Sangsby ’s and I heerd him , but he sounded as if he wos a - speakin ’ to hisself , and not to me .

321514	321575	321501	321501	She	958	“ I am about to place confidence in you , child , for I know I may trust your attachment , if not your judgment . In what I am going to do , I will not disguise myself to you at least . But I confide in you . Say nothing to any one of what passes between us . ”
321588	321593	321501	321501	She	958	“ Do you know , ”
321608	321629	321594	321595	Lady Dedlock	264	“ do you know , Rosa , that I am different to you from what I am to any one ? ”
321630	321652	321501	321501	She	958	“ Yes , my Lady . Much kinder . But then I often think I know you as you really are . ”
321653	321671	321672	321672	She	958	“ You often think you know me as I really am ? Poor child , poor child ! ”
321695	321741	321672	321672	She	958	“ Do you think , Rosa , you are any relief or comfort to me ? Do you suppose your being young and natural , and fond of me and grateful to me , makes it any pleasure to me to have you near me ? ”
321742	321769	321501	321501	She	958	“ I do n’t know , my Lady ; I can scarcely hope so . But with all my heart , I wish it was so . ”
321770	321778	321779	321781	The pretty face	7180	“ It is so , little one . ”
321807	321847	321800	321800	It	7180	“ And if I were to say to - day , ‘ Go ! Leave me ! ’ I should say what would give me great pain and disquiet , child , and what would leave me very solitary . ”
321848	321857	321878	321879	My Lady	958	“ My Lady ! Have I offended you ? ”
321858	321865	321866	321866	Rosa	334	“ In nothing . Come here . ”
321904	322010	321892	321892	her	958	“ I told you , Rosa , that I wished you to be happy and that I would make you so if I could make anybody happy on this earth . I can not . There are reasons now known to me , reasons in which you have no part , rendering it far better for you that you should not remain here . You must not remain here . I have determined that you shall not . I have written to the father of your lover , and he will be here to - day . All this I have done for your sake . ”
322049	322066	322036	322037	Her mistress	12032	“ Now , be happy , child , under better circumstances . Be beloved and happy ! ”
322067	322090	322023	322023	she	7183	“ Ah , my Lady , I have sometimes thought — forgive my being so free — that YOU are not happy . ”
322091	322094	322023	322023	she	7183	“ I ! ”
322095	322122	322036	322037	Her mistress	12032	“ Will you be more so when you have sent me away ? Pray , pray , think again . Let me stay a little while ! ”
322123	322196	322197	322197	She	7186	“ I have said , my child , that what I do , I do for your sake , not my own . It is done . What I am towards you , Rosa , is what I am now — not what I shall be a little while hence . Remember this , and keep my confidence . Do so much for my sake , and thus all ends between us ! ”
322310	322323	322302	322302	she	7186	“ Sir Leicester , I am desirous — but you are engaged . ”
322355	322371	322406	322407	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ I beg your pardon , Lady Dedlock . Will you allow me to retire ? ”
322379	322392	322393	322393	she	7186	“ You know you have the power to remain if you will , ”
322771	322810	322765	322765	She	264	“ Only that Mr. Rouncewell is here ( he has called by my appointment ) and that we had better make an end of the question of that girl . I am tired to death of the matter . ”
322811	322821	322823	322824	Sir Leicester	266	“ What can I do — to — assist ? ”
322830	322851	322823	322824	Sir Leicester	266	“ Let us see him here and have done with it . Will you tell them to send him up ? ”
322852	322868	322870	322871	Sir Leicester	266	“ Mr. Tulkinghorn , be so good as to ring . Thank you . Request , ”
322882	322892	322873	322873	Mercury	277	“ request the iron gentleman to walk this way . ”
322916	322945	322946	322947	Sir Leicester	266	“ I hope you are well , Mr. Rouncewell . Be seated . ( My solicitor , Mr. Tulkinghorn . ) My Lady was desirous , Mr. Rouncewell , ”
322959	322969	322956	322956	his	266	“ was desirous to speak with you . Hem ! ”
322970	322977	322979	322981	the iron gentleman	15826	“ I shall be very happy , ”
322983	323000	322979	322981	the iron gentleman	15826	“ to give my best attention to anything Lady Dedlock does me the honour to say . ”
323053	323058	323060	323061	Lady Dedlock	264	“ Pray , sir , ”
323064	323086	323060	323061	Lady Dedlock	264	“ may I be allowed to inquire whether anything has passed between you and your son respecting your son ’s fancy ? ”
323108	323144	323145	323146	The ironmaster	13377	“ If my memory serves me , Lady Dedlock , I said , when I had the pleasure of seeing you before , that I should seriously advise my son to conquer that — fancy . ”
323155	323160	323145	323146	The ironmaster	13377	“ And did you ? ”
323161	323169	323170	323171	Sir Leicester	266	“ Oh ! Of course I did . ”
323217	323225	323145	323146	The ironmaster	13377	“ And pray has he done so ? ”
323226	323287	323288	323289	Sir Leicester	266	“ Really , Lady Dedlock , I can not make you a definite reply . I fear not . Probably not yet . In our condition of life , we sometimes couple an intention with our — our fancies which renders them not altogether easy to throw off . I think it is rather our way to be in earnest . ”
323334	323337	323328	323328	his	330	“ Because , ”
323342	323357	323328	323328	his	330	“ I have been thinking of the subject , which is tiresome to me . ”
323358	323368	323385	323385	Leicester	266	“ I am very sorry , I am sure . ”
323369	323384	323328	323328	his	330	“ And also of what Sir Leicester said upon it , in which I quite concur”—Sir
323386	323417	323385	323385	Leicester	266	flattered—“and if you can not give us the assurance that this fancy is at an end , I have come to the conclusion that the girl had better leave me . ”
323418	323434	323385	323385	Leicester	266	“ I can give no such assurance , Lady Dedlock . Nothing of the kind . ”
323435	323442	323385	323385	Leicester	266	“ Then she had better go . ”
323443	323450	323385	323385	Leicester	266	“ Excuse me , my Lady , ”
323456	323481	323483	323484	Sir Leicester	266	“ but perhaps this may be doing an injury to the young woman which she has not merited . Here is a young woman , ”
323501	323588	323589	323589	Leicester	266	“ whose good fortune it is to have attracted the notice and favour of an eminent lady and to live , under the protection of that eminent lady , surrounded by the various advantages which such a position confers , and which are unquestionably very great — I believe unquestionably very great , sir — for a young woman in that station of life . The question then arises , should that young woman be deprived of these many advantages and that good fortune simply because she has”—Sir
323607	323637	323589	323589	Leicester	266	sentence—“has attracted the notice of Mr Rouncewell ’s son ? Now , has she deserved this punishment ? Is this just towards her ? Is this our previous understanding ? ”
323638	323644	323646	323647	Mr. Rouncewell	330	“ I beg your pardon , ”
323653	323709	323646	323647	Mr. Rouncewell	330	“ Sir Leicester , will you allow me ? I think I may shorten the subject . Pray dismiss that from your consideration . If you remember anything so unimportant — which is not to be expected — you would recollect that my first thought in the affair was directly opposed to her remaining here . ”
323756	323762	323767	323767	her	958	“ It is not necessary , ”
323779	323841	323767	323767	her	958	“ to enter into these matters on either side . The girl is a very good girl ; I have nothing whatever to say against her , but she is so far insensible to her many advantages and her good fortune that she is in love — or supposes she is , poor little fool — and unable to appreciate them . ”
323887	323908	323909	323910	Lady Dedlock	264	“ As Sir Leicester observed , Mr. Rouncewell , on the last occasion when we were fatigued by this business , ”
323914	323976	323909	323910	Lady Dedlock	264	“ we can not make conditions with you . Without conditions , and under present circumstances , the girl is quite misplaced here and had better go . I have told her so . Would you wish to have her sent back to the village , or would you like to take her with you , or what would you prefer ? ”
323977	323987	323877	323878	my Lady	958	“ Lady Dedlock , if I may speak plainly — ”
323988	323993	323909	323910	Lady Dedlock	264	“ By all means . ”
323994	324018	323909	323910	Lady Dedlock	264	“ — I should prefer the course which will the soonest relieve you of the incumbrance and remove her from her present position . ”
324019	324026	324027	324027	she	264	“ And to speak as plainly , ”
324035	324050	324027	324027	she	264	“ so should I. Do I understand that you will take her with you ? ”
324059	324067	324051	324053	The iron gentleman	15826	“ Sir Leicester , will you ring ? ”
324080	324089	324090	324090	He	7224	“ I had forgotten you . Thank you . ”
324163	324173	324178	324178	her	958	“ You are taken charge of , you see , ”
324182	324209	324178	324178	her	958	“ and are going away well protected . I have mentioned that you are a very good girl , and you have nothing to cry for . ”
324210	324216	324218	324219	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ She seems after all , ”
324231	324241	324226	324226	his	269	“ as if she were crying at going away . ”
324242	324255	324268	324268	he	330	“ Why , she is not well - bred , you see , ”
324279	324308	324268	324268	he	330	“ and she is an inexperienced little thing and knows no better . If she had remained here , sir , she would have improved , no doubt . ”
324309	324313	324315	324316	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ No doubt , ”
324362	324370	324372	324373	the ironmaster	13377	“ Out , you silly little puss ! ”
324386	324398	324372	324373	the ironmaster	13377	“ Have a spirit , if you ’re fond of Watt ! ”
324410	324426	324399	324400	My Lady	958	“ There , there , child ! You are a good girl . Go away ! ”
324474	324481	324483	324484	Mr. Rouncewell	330	“ Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , ”
324493	324632	324483	324484	Mr. Rouncewell	330	“ I beg to take my leave , with an apology for having again troubled you , though not of my own act , on this tiresome subject . I can very well understand , I assure you , how tiresome so small a matter must have become to Lady Dedlock . If I am doubtful of my dealing with it , it is only because I did not at first quietly exert my influence to take my young friend here away without troubling you at all . But it appeared to me — I dare say magnifying the importance of the thing — that it was respectful to explain to you how the matter stood and candid to consult your wishes and convenience . I hope you will excuse my want of acquaintance with the polite world . ”
324646	324650	324651	324651	he	266	“ Mr. Rouncewell , ”
324654	324671	324651	324651	he	266	“ do not mention it . Justifications are unnecessary , I hope , on either side . ”
324672	324777	324779	324779	he	266	“ I am glad to hear it , Sir Leicester ; and if I may , by way of a last word , revert to what I said before of my mother ’s long connexion with the family and the worth it bespeaks on both sides , I would point out this little instance here on my arm who shows herself so affectionate and faithful in parting and in whom my mother , I dare say , has done something to awaken such feelings — though of course Lady Dedlock , by her heartfelt interest and her genial condescension , has done much more . ”
324916	324940	324903	324904	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ Well she may be ! The power of this woman is astonishing . She has been acting a part the whole time . ”
325180	325188	325172	325172	her	958	“ What do you want , sir ? ”
325189	325195	325197	325198	the lawyer	1054	“ Why , Lady Dedlock , ”
325227	325239	325197	325198	the lawyer	1054	“ I am rather surprised by the course you have taken . ”
325240	325243	325172	325172	her	958	“ Indeed ? ”
325244	325295	325296	325296	He	1054	“ Yes , decidedly . I was not prepared for it . I consider it a departure from our agreement and your promise . It puts us in a new position , Lady Dedlock . I feel myself under the necessity of saying that I do n’t approve of it . ”
325342	325350	325172	325172	her	958	“ I do not quite understand you . ”
325351	325388	325296	325296	He	1054	“ Oh , yes you do , I think . I think you do . Come , come , Lady Dedlock , we must not fence and parry now . You know you like this girl . ”
325389	325394	325172	325172	her	958	“ Well , sir ? ”
325395	325450	325172	325172	her	958	“ And you know — and I know — that you have not sent her away for the reasons you have assigned , but for the purpose of separating her as much as possible from — excuse my mentioning it as a matter of business — any reproach and exposure that impend over yourself . ”
325451	325456	325296	325296	He	1054	“ Well , sir ? ”
325457	325463	325465	325466	the lawyer	1054	“ Well , Lady Dedlock , ”
325477	325577	325465	325466	the lawyer	1054	“ I object to that . I consider that a dangerous proceeding . I know it to be unnecessary and calculated to awaken speculation , doubt , rumour , I do n’t know what , in the house . Besides , it is a violation of our agreement . You were to be exactly what you were before . Whereas , it must be evident to yourself , as it is to me , that you have been this evening very different from what you were before . Why , bless my soul , Lady Dedlock , transparently so ! ”
325578	325583	325584	325584	she	7257	“ If , sir , ”
325587	325595	325584	325584	she	7257	“ in my knowledge of my secret — ”
325601	325677	325597	325597	he	1054	“ Now , Lady Dedlock , this is a matter of business , and in a matter of business the ground can not be kept too clear . It is no longer your secret . Excuse me . That is just the mistake . It is my secret , in trust for Sir Leicester and the family . If it were your secret , Lady Dedlock , we should not be here holding this conversation . ”
325678	325760	325762	325762	she	7258	“ That is very true . If in my knowledge of THE secret I do what I can to spare an innocent girl ( especially , remembering your own reference to her when you told my story to the assembled guests at Chesney Wold ) from the taint of my impending shame , I act upon a resolution I have taken . Nothing in the world , and no one in the world , could shake it or could move me . ”
325800	325810	325811	325811	he	7259	“ Really ? Then you see , Lady Dedlock , ”
325814	325853	325811	325811	he	7259	“ you are not to be trusted . You have put the case in a perfectly plain way , and according to the literal fact ; and that being the case , you are not to be trusted . ”
325854	325877	325762	325762	she	7258	“ Perhaps you may remember that I expressed some anxiety on this same point when we spoke at night at Chesney Wold ? ”
325878	325881	325883	325884	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ Yes , ”
325895	326017	325883	325884	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ Yes . I recollect , Lady Dedlock , that you certainly referred to the girl , but that was before we came to our arrangement , and both the letter and the spirit of our arrangement altogether precluded any action on your part founded upon my discovery . There can be no doubt about that . As to sparing the girl , of what importance or value is she ? Spare ! Lady Dedlock , here is a family name compromised . One might have supposed that the course was straight on — over everything , neither to the right nor to the left , regardless of all considerations in the way , sparing nothing , treading everything under foot . ”
326057	326063	326048	326048	her	7260	“ This woman understands me , ”
326075	326088	326068	326068	she	7260	“ SHE can not be spared . Why should she spare others ? ”
326161	326165	326167	326168	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ This woman , ”
326184	326189	326167	326168	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ is a study . ”
326243	326291	326211	326211	She	7260	“ Lady Dedlock , the most disagreeable part of this business interview remains , but it is business . Our agreement is broken . A lady of your sense and strength of character will be prepared for my now declaring it void and taking my own course . ”
326292	326298	326299	326300	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ I am quite prepared . ”
326305	326319	326302	326302	his	269	“ That is all I have to trouble you with , Lady Dedlock . ”
326334	326351	326320	326320	She	7260	“ This is the notice I was to receive ? I wish not to misapprehend you . ”
326352	326396	326299	326300	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ Not exactly the notice you were to receive , Lady Dedlock , because the contemplated notice supposed the agreement to have been observed . But virtually the same , virtually the same . The difference is merely in a lawyer ’s mind . ”
326397	326407	326320	326320	She	7260	“ You intend to give me no other notice ? ”
326408	326415	326320	326320	She	7260	“ You are right . No . ”
326416	326427	326299	326300	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ Do you contemplate undeceiving Sir Leicester to - night ? ”
326428	326433	326435	326436	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ A home question ! ”
326451	326459	326444	326444	his	269	“ No , not to - night . ”
326460	326465	326299	326300	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ To - morrow ? ”
326466	326545	326546	326546	She	7263	“ All things considered , I had better decline answering that question , Lady Dedlock . If I were to say I do n’t know when , exactly , you would not believe me , and it would answer no purpose . It may be to - morrow . I would rather say no more . You are prepared , and I hold out no expectations which circumstances might fail to justify . I wish you good evening . ”
326578	326606	326552	326552	her	7263	“ Do you intend to remain in the house any time ? I heard you were writing in the library . Are you going to return there ? ”
326607	326618	326619	326619	She	7263	“ Only for my hat . I am going home . ”
326683	326690	326691	326692	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ And what do YOU say , ”
326699	326705	326691	326692	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ What do you say ? ”
326711	326717	326691	326692	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ Do n’t go home ! ”
326759	326765	326691	326692	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ Do n’t go home ! ”
326782	326793	326795	326796	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ Why , you are worse than I thought you , ”
326804	326819	326795	326796	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	“ Two minutes wrong ? At this rate you wo n’t last my time . ”
326834	326840	326841	326841	He	269	“ Do n’t go home ! ”
326927	326933	326923	326923	them	7268	“ Do n’t go home ! ”
326997	327003	326994	326994	him	269	“ Do n’t go home ! ”
327059	327065	327049	327051	the attendant groups	7273	“ Do n’t come here ! ”
328252	328262	328263	328263	He	650	“ If he could only tell what he saw ! ”
328741	328743	328733	328733	him	542	“ goodness ”
328838	328844	328791	328792	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ What is your name ? ”
328846	328853	328791	328792	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ Who gave you that name ? ”
328871	328880	328882	328882	he	542	“ And how do you like that name ? ”
329332	329338	329340	329341	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ At half after one . ”
329343	329353	329340	329341	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ To the minute . They ’ll be done . ”
329375	329385	329387	329388	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ You shall have a dinner , old girl , ”
329390	329396	329387	329388	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ Fit for a queen . ”
329512	329519	329521	329522	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ George will look us up , ”
329524	329550	329521	329522	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ At half after four . To the moment . How many years , old girl . Has George looked us up . This afternoon ? ”
329551	329583	329591	329591	her	543	“ Ah , Lignum , Lignum , as many as make an old woman of a young one , I begin to think . Just about that , and no less , ”
329594	329598	329591	329591	her	543	“ Old girl , ”
329603	329631	329600	329601	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ never mind . You ’d be as young as ever you was . If you was n’t younger . Which you are . As everybody knows . ”
329662	329669	329671	329672	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Do you know , Lignum , ”
329685	329688	329692	329692	her	543	“ salt ! ”
329707	329720	329704	329704	her	543	“ I begin to think George is in the roving way again . ”
329721	329724	329726	329727	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ George , ”
329729	329751	329726	329727	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ will never desert . And leave his old comrade . In the lurch . Do n’t be afraid of it . ”
329752	329792	329704	329704	her	543	“ No , Lignum . No . I do n’t say he will . I do n’t think he will . But if he could get over this money trouble of his , I believe he would be off . ”
329798	329801	329793	329794	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ Well , ”
329808	329857	329793	329794	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ George seems to me to be getting not a little impatient and restless . I do n’t say but what he ’s as free as ever . Of course he must be free or he would n’t be George , but he smarts and seems put out . ”
329858	329865	329867	329868	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ He ’s extra - drilled , ”
329870	329882	329867	329868	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ By a lawyer . Who would put the devil out . ”
329883	329890	329793	329794	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ There ’s something in that , ”
329895	329903	329793	329794	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ but so it is , Lignum . ”
330498	330504	330494	330495	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ George ! Military time . ”
330538	330544	330546	330547	Mr. George	500	“ Happy returns to all ! ”
330549	330557	330559	330560	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ But , George , old man ! ”
330567	330574	330559	330560	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ What ’s come to you ? ”
330575	330580	330546	330547	Mr. George	500	“ Come to me ? ”
330581	330606	330559	330560	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Ah ! You are so white , George — for you — and look so shocked . Now do n’t he , Lignum ? ”
330607	330610	330612	330613	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ George , ”
330615	330626	330612	330613	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ tell the old girl . What ’s the matter . ”
330627	330636	330638	330639	the trooper	12478	“ I did n’t know I looked white , ”
330648	330691	330638	330639	the trooper	12478	“ and I did n’t know I looked shocked , and I ’m sorry I do . But the truth is , that boy who was taken in at my place died yesterday afternoon , and it has rather knocked me over . ”
330692	330696	330698	330699	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Poor creetur ! ”
330706	330715	330701	330702	a mother	1904	“ Is he gone ? Dear , dear ! ”
330716	330760	330762	330763	the trooper	12478	“ I did n’t mean to say anything about it , for it ’s not birthday talk , but you have got it out of me , you see , before I sit down . I should have roused up in a minute , ”
330771	330781	330766	330766	himself	12478	“ but you ’re so quick , Mrs. Bagnet . ”
330782	330791	330793	330794	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ You ’re right . The old girl , ”
330796	330804	330793	330794	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ Is as quick . As powder . ”
330805	330826	330828	330829	Mr. George	500	“ And what ’s more , she ’s the subject of the day , and we ’ll stick to her , ”
330831	330871	330828	330829	Mr. George	500	“ See here , I have brought a little brooch along with me . It ’s a poor thing , you know , but it ’s a keepsake . That ’s all the good it is , Mrs. Bagnet . ”
330902	330906	330908	330909	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ Old girl , ”
330911	330919	330908	330909	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ Tell him my opinion of it . ”
330920	330930	330931	330932	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Why , it ’s a wonder , George ! ”
330935	330946	330931	330932	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ It ’s the beautifullest thing that ever was seen ! ”
330947	330950	330952	330953	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ Good ! ”
330955	330959	330952	330953	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ My opinion . ”
330960	330968	330970	330971	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ It ’s so pretty , George , ”
330987	330996	330970	330971	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ that it seems too choice for me . ”
330997	331000	331002	331003	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ Bad ! ”
331005	331010	331002	331003	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ Not my opinion . ”
331011	331025	331027	331028	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ But whatever it is , a hundred thousand thanks , old fellow , ”
331043	331096	331030	331030	her	543	“ and though I have been a crossgrained soldier ’s wife to you sometimes , George , we are as strong friends , I am sure , in reality , as ever can be . Now you shall fasten it on yourself , for good luck , if you will , George . ”
331144	331159	331138	331138	her	543	“ Oh , Lignum , Lignum , what a precious old chap you are ! ”
331182	331189	331191	331191	he	12478	“ Would any one believe this ? ”
331202	331219	331191	331191	he	12478	“ I am so out of sorts that I bungle at an easy job like this ! ”
331265	331276	331278	331278	she	543	“ If that do n’t bring you round , George , ”
331280	331302	331278	331278	she	543	“ just throw your eye across here at your present now and then , and the two together MUST do it . ”
331303	331312	331191	331191	he	12478	“ You ought to do it of yourself , ”
331316	331374	331313	331313	George	500	“ I know that very well , Mrs. Bagnet . I ’ll tell you how , one way and another , the blues have got to be too many for me . Here was this poor lad . ’ Twas dull work to see him dying as he did , and not be able to help him . ”
331375	331395	331278	331278	she	543	“ What do you mean , George ? You did help him . You took him under your roof . ”
331396	331449	331313	331313	George	500	“ I helped him so far , but that ’s little . I mean , Mrs. Bagnet , there he was , dying without ever having been taught much more than to know his right hand from his left . And he was too far gone to be helped out of that . ”
331450	331456	331458	331459	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Ah , poor creetur ! ”
331461	331464	331466	331467	the trooper	12478	“ Then , ”
331484	331571	331466	331467	the trooper	12478	“ that brought up Gridley in a man ’s mind . His was a bad case too , in a different way . Then the two got mixed up in a man ’s mind with a flinty old rascal who had to do with both . And to think of that rusty carbine , stock and barrel , standing up on end in his corner , hard , indifferent , taking everything so evenly — it made flesh and blood tingle , I do assure you . ”
331572	331578	331580	331581	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ My advice to you , ”
331583	331607	331580	331581	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ is to light your pipe and tingle that way . It ’s wholesomer and comfortabler , and better for the health altogether . ”
331608	331613	331615	331616	the trooper	12478	“ You ’re right , ”
331618	331625	331615	331616	the trooper	12478	“ and I ’ll do it . ”
331688	331692	331680	331681	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ the mixtur , ”
331728	331761	331718	331718	He	542	“ George . Woolwich . Quebec . Malta . This is her birthday . Take a day ’s march . And you wo n’t find such another . Here ’s towards her ! ”
331791	331796	331798	331800	the old girl	4707	“ And wishing yours ! ”
331837	331843	331821	331821	she	4707	“ Here ’s a man ! ”
331907	331910	331912	331913	the man	1619	“ George , ”
331917	331924	331912	331913	the man	1619	“ how do you find yourself ? ”
331925	331932	331934	331935	Mr. George	500	“ Why , it ’s Bucket ! ”
331937	331940	331942	331943	the man	1619	“ Yes , ”
331952	332054	332056	332057	Mr. Bucket	668	“ I was going down the street here when I happened to stop and look in at the musical instruments in the shop - window — a friend of mine is in want of a second - hand wiolinceller of a good tone — and I saw a party enjoying themselves , and I thought it was you in the corner ; I thought I could n’t be mistaken . How goes the world with you , George , at the present moment ? Pretty smooth ? And with you , ma’am ? And with you , governor ? And Lord , ”
332063	332110	332056	332057	Mr. Bucket	668	“ here ’s children too ! You may do anything with me if you only show me children . Give us a kiss , my pets . No occasion to inquire who YOUR father and mother is . Never saw such a likeness in my life ! ”
332134	332139	332141	332142	Mr. Bucket	668	“ You pretty dears , ”
332144	332195	332141	332142	Mr. Bucket	668	“ give us another kiss ; it ’s the only thing I ’m greedy in . Lord bless you , how healthy you look ! And what may be the ages of these two , ma’am ? I should put ’em down at the figures of about eight and ten . ”
332196	332204	332206	332207	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ You ’re very near , sir , ”
332209	332215	332217	332218	Mr. Bucket	668	“ I generally am near , ”
332220	332284	332286	332287	Mr. Bucket	668	“ being so fond of children . A friend of mine has had nineteen of ’em , ma’am , all by one mother , and she ’s still as fresh and rosy as the morning . Not so much so as yourself , but , upon my soul , she comes near you ! And what do you call these , my darling ? ”
332294	332350	332286	332287	Mr. Bucket	668	“ These are peaches , these are . Bless your heart ! And what do you think about father ? Do you think father could recommend a second - hand wiolinceller of a good tone for Mr. Bucket ’s friend , my dear ? My name ’s Bucket . Ai n’t that a funny name ? ”
332429	332436	332438	332439	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Not in his usual spirits ? ”
332441	332494	332438	332439	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Why , I never heard of such a thing ! What ’s the matter , George ? You do n’t intend to tell me you ’ve been out of spirits . What should you be out of spirits for ? You have n’t got anything on your mind , you know . ”
332495	332499	332501	332502	the trooper	12478	“ Nothing particular , ”
332504	332510	332512	332513	Mr. Bucket	668	“ I should think not , ”
332515	332586	332512	332513	Mr. Bucket	668	“ What could you have on your mind , you know ! And have these pets got anything on THEIR minds , eh ? Not they , but they ’ll be upon the minds of some of the young fellows , some of these days , and make ’em precious low - spirited . I ai n’t much of a prophet , but I can tell you that , ma’am . ”
332603	332608	332610	332611	Mr. Bucket	668	“ There , ma’am ! ”
332613	332686	332610	332611	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Would you believe it ? No , I have n’t . My wife and a lodger constitute my family . Mrs. Bucket is as fond of children as myself and as wishful to have ’em , but no . So it is . Worldly goods are divided unequally , and man must not repine . What a very nice backyard , ma’am ! Any way out of that yard , now ? ”
332696	332702	332704	332705	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Ai n’t there really ? ”
332707	332768	332704	332705	Mr. Bucket	668	“ I should have thought there might have been . Well , I do n’t know as I ever saw a backyard that took my fancy more . Would you allow me to look at it ? Thank you . No , I see there ’s no way out . But what a very good - proportioned yard it is ! ”
332798	332807	332791	332792	Mr. George	500	“ How are your spirits now , George ? ”
332808	332813	332815	332816	the trooper	12478	“ All right now , ”
332818	332824	332826	332827	Mr. Bucket	668	“ That ’s your sort ! ”
332829	332894	332826	332827	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Why should you ever have been otherwise ? A man of your fine figure and constitution has no right to be out of spirits . That ai n’t a chest to be out of spirits , is it , ma’am ? And you have n’t got anything on your mind , you know , George ; what could you have on your mind ! ”
332951	332963	332965	332966	Mr. Bucket	668	“ And this is brother , is it , my dears ? ”
332982	333010	332965	332966	Mr. Bucket	668	“ And a nice brother he is — half - brother I mean to say . For he ’s too old to be your boy , ma’am . ”
333011	333026	333028	333029	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ I can certify at all events that he is not anybody else ’s , ”
333033	333078	333028	333029	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Well , you do surprise me ! Yet he ’s like you , there ’s no denying . Lord , he ’s wonderfully like you ! But about what you may call the brow , you know , THERE his father comes out ! ”
333116	333124	333126	333127	Mr. Bucket	668	“ George ’s godson , is he ? ”
333132	333175	333126	333127	Mr. Bucket	668	“ I must shake hands over again with George ’s godson . Godfather and godson do credit to one another . And what do you intend to make of him , ma’am ? Does he show any turn for any musical instrument ? ”
333181	333188	333176	333177	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ Plays the fife . Beautiful . ”
333189	333197	333199	333200	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Would you believe it , governor , ”
333207	333265	333199	333200	Mr. Bucket	668	“ that when I was a boy I played the fife myself ? Not in a scientific way , as I expect he does , but by ear . Lord bless you ! ‘ British Grenadiers’—there ’s a tune to warm an Englishman up ! COULD you give us ‘ British Grenadiers , ’ my fine fellow ? ”
333315	333323	333327	333327	he	668	“ British Gra - a - anadeers ! ”

333860	333878	333840	333840	He	668	“ Respecting that second - hand wiolinceller , governor — could you recommend me such a thing ? ”
333879	333882	333884	333885	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ Scores , ”
333887	333894	333884	333885	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ I am obliged to you , ”
333903	333954	333956	333957	Mr. Bucket	668	“ You ’re a friend in need . A good tone , mind you ! My friend is a regular dab at it . Ecod , he saws away at Mozart and Handel and the rest of the big - wigs like a thorough workman . And you need n’t , ”
333965	334026	333956	333957	Mr. Bucket	668	“ you need n’t commit yourself to too low a figure , governor . I do n’t want to pay too large a price for my friend , but I want you to have your proper percentage and be remunerated for your loss of time . That is but fair . Every man must live , and ought to it . ”
334048	334085	334087	334088	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Suppose I was to give you a look in , say , at half arter ten to - morrow morning . Perhaps you could name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone ? ”
334124	334128	334130	334131	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Thank you , ”
334133	334171	334130	334131	Mr. Bucket	668	“ thank you . Good night , ma’am . Good night , governor . Good night , darlings . I am much obliged to you for one of the pleasantest evenings I ever spent in my life . ”
334207	334214	334216	334217	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Now George , old boy , ”
334228	334232	334216	334217	Mr. Bucket	668	“ come along ! ”
334261	334277	334251	334252	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ almost clings to George like , and seems to be really fond of him . ”
334331	334348	334313	334314	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Wait half a minute , George . I should wish to speak to you first . ”
334378	334383	334385	334386	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Now , George , ”
334388	334445	334385	334386	Mr. Bucket	668	“ duty is duty , and friendship is friendship . I never want the two to clash if I can help it . I have endeavoured to make things pleasant to - night , and I put it to you whether I have done it or not . You must consider yourself in custody , George . ”
334446	334452	334454	334455	the trooper	12478	“ Custody ? What for ? ”
334459	334464	334466	334467	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Now , George , ”
334483	334544	334466	334467	Mr. Bucket	668	“ duty , as you know very well , is one thing , and conversation is another . It ’s my duty to inform you that any observations you may make will be liable to be used against you . Therefore , George , be careful what you say . You do n’t happen to have heard of a murder ? ”
334545	334548	334454	334455	the trooper	12478	“ Murder ! ”
334549	334554	334556	334557	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Now , George , ”
334569	334608	334556	334557	Mr. Bucket	668	“ bear in mind what I ’ve said to you . I ask you nothing . You ’ve been in low spirits this afternoon . I say , you do n’t happen to have heard of a murder ? ”
334609	334619	334454	334455	the trooper	12478	“ No . Where has there been a murder ? ”

334710	334729	334735	334736	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Bucket ! It ’s not possible that Mr. Tulkinghorn has been killed and that you suspect ME ? ”
334730	334733	334735	334736	Mr. Bucket	668	“ George , ”
334743	334790	334735	334736	Mr. Bucket	668	“ it is certainly possible , because it ’s the case . This deed was done last night at ten o’clock . Now , you know where you were last night at ten o’clock , and you ’ll be able to prove it , no doubt . ”
334791	334798	334800	334801	the trooper	12478	“ Last night ! Last night ? ”
334810	334822	334735	334736	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Why , great heaven , I was there last night ! ”
334823	334831	334833	334834	Mr. Bucket	668	“ So I have understood , George , ”
334839	334915	334916	334917	The trooper	12478	“ So I have understood . Likewise you ’ve been very often there . You ’ve been seen hanging about the place , and you ’ve been heard more than once in a wrangle with him , and it ’s possible — I do n’t say it ’s certainly so , mind you , but it ’s possible — that he may have been heard to call you a threatening , murdering , dangerous fellow . ”
334931	334936	334938	334939	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Now , George , ”

I tell you plainly there ’s a reward out , of a hundred guineas , offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . You and me have always been pleasant together ; but I have got a duty to discharge ; and if that hundred guineas is to be made , it may as well be made by me as any other man . On all of which accounts , I should hope it was clear to you that I must have you , and that I ’m damned if I do n’t have you . Am I to call in any assistance , or is the trick done ? ”

So to London we will go . That being settled , there is another thing — how have you left Caddy ? ”

He seems half inclined for another voyage . But that appears like casting such a man away . ”

339420	339453	339408	339408	I	0	“ I do n’t quite know what to think , my dear , but I should say it was likely at present that he will give a long trip to another country . ”

340490	340501	340503	340504	Mr. Vholes	245	“ Just so , sir . I believe , sir , ”
340518	340534	340503	340504	Mr. Vholes	245	“ that you have influence with Mr. C. Indeed I am aware that you have . ”

It is a part of my professional duty to study and to understand a gentleman who confides his interests to me . In my professional duty I shall not be wanting , sir , if I know it . I may , with the best intentions , be wanting in it without knowing it ; but not if I know it , sir . ”
340661	340668	340670	340671	Mr. Vholes	245	“ Give me leave , sir , ”
340673	340703	340670	340671	Mr. Vholes	245	“ Bear with me for a moment . Sir , Mr. C. is playing for a considerable stake , and can not play without — need I say what ? ”
340704	340710	340654	340655	Mr. Woodcourt	440	“ Money , I presume ? ”
340711	340714	340716	340717	Mr. Vholes	245	“ Sir , ”
340719	340811	340813	340814	Mr. Vholes	245	“ to be honest with you ( honesty being my golden rule , whether I gain by it or lose , and I find that I generally lose ) , money is the word . Now , sir , upon the chances of Mr. C. ’s game I express to you no opinion , NO opinion . It might be highly impolitic in Mr. C. , after playing so long and so high , to leave off ; it might be the reverse ; I say nothing . No , sir , ”
340829	340832	340813	340814	Mr. Vholes	245	“ nothing . ”
340833	340839	340841	340842	Mr. Woodcourt	440	“ You seem to forget , ”
340844	340861	340841	340842	Mr. Woodcourt	440	“ that I ask you to say nothing and have no interest in anything you say . ”
340862	340868	340870	340871	Mr. Vholes	245	“ Pardon me , sir ! ”
340873	340953	340870	340871	Mr. Vholes	245	“ You do yourself an injustice . No , sir ! Pardon me ! You shall not — shall not in my office , if I know it — do yourself an injustice . You are interested in anything , and in everything , that relates to your friend . I know human nature much better , sir , than to admit for an instant that a gentleman of your appearance is not interested in whatever concerns his friend . ”
340954	340957	340959	340960	Mr. Woodcourt	440	“ Well , ”
340962	340975	340959	340960	Mr. Woodcourt	440	“ that may be . I am particularly interested in his address . ”
340976	340982	340984	340985	Mr. Vholes	245	“ The number , sir , ”
340988	341195	340984	340985	Mr. Vholes	245	“ I believe I have already mentioned . If Mr. C. is to continue to play for this considerable stake , sir , he must have funds . Understand me ! There are funds in hand at present . I ask for nothing ; there are funds in hand . But for the onward play , more funds must be provided , unless Mr. C. is to throw away what he has already ventured , which is wholly and solely a point for his consideration . This , sir , I take the opportunity of stating openly to you as the friend of Mr. C. Without funds I shall always be happy to appear and act for Mr. C. to the extent of all such costs as are safe to be allowed out of the estate , not beyond that . I could not go beyond that , sir , without wronging some one . I must either wrong my three dear girls or my venerable father , who is entirely dependent on me , in the Vale of Taunton ; or some one . Whereas , sir , my resolution is ( call it weakness or folly if you please ) to wrong no one . ”
341209	341215	341217	341218	Mr. Vholes	245	“ I wish , sir , ”
341220	341305	341217	341218	Mr. Vholes	245	“ to leave a good name behind me . Therefore I take every opportunity of openly stating to a friend of Mr. C. how Mr. C. is situated . As to myself , sir , the labourer is worthy of his hire . If I undertake to put my shoulder to the wheel , I do it , and I earn what I get . I am here for that purpose . My name is painted on the door outside , with that object . ”
341306	341316	341322	341323	Mr. Vholes	245	“ And Mr. Carstone ’s address , Mr. Vholes ? ”
341317	341320	341322	341323	Mr. Vholes	245	“ Sir , ”
341325	341373	341322	341323	Mr. Vholes	245	“ as I believe I have already mentioned , it is next door . On the second story you will find Mr. C. ’s apartments . Mr. C. desires to be near his professional adviser , and I am far from objecting , for I court inquiry . ”
341507	341514	341516	341516	Richard	291	“ Woodcourt , my dear fellow , ”
341524	341534	341516	341516	Richard	291	“ you come upon my vision like a ghost . ”
341535	341540	341541	341541	he	440	“ A friendly one , ”
341544	341566	341541	341541	he	440	“ and only waiting , as they say ghosts do , to be addressed . How does the mortal world go ? ”
341575	341583	341585	341585	Richard	291	“ Badly enough , and slowly enough , ”
341587	341597	341585	341585	Richard	291	“ speaking at least for my part of it . ”
341598	341604	341541	341541	he	440	“ What part is that ? ”
341605	341610	341541	341541	he	440	“ The Chancery part . ”
341611	341616	341618	341619	Mr. Woodcourt	440	“ I never heard , ”
341625	341632	341622	341622	his	440	“ of its going well yet . ”
341633	341637	341639	341639	Richard	291	“ Nor I , ”
341642	341647	341648	341648	He	440	“ Who ever did ? ”
341661	341817	341648	341648	He	440	“ Woodcourt , I should be sorry to be misunderstood by you , even if I gained by it in your estimation . You must know that I have done no good this long time . I have not intended to do much harm , but I seem to have been capable of nothing else . It may be that I should have done better by keeping out of the net into which my destiny has worked me , but I think not , though I dare say you will soon hear , if you have not already heard , a very different opinion . To make short of a long story , I am afraid I have wanted an object ; but I have an object now — or it has me — and it is too late to discuss it . Take me as I am , and make the best of me . ”
341818	341822	341824	341825	Mr. Woodcourt	440	“ A bargain , ”
341827	341836	341824	341825	Mr. Woodcourt	440	“ Do as much by me in return . ”
341837	341842	341844	341844	Richard	291	“ Oh ! You , ”
341846	341886	341844	341844	Richard	291	“ you can pursue your art for its own sake , and can put your hand upon the plough and never turn , and can strike a purpose out of anything . You and I are very different creatures . ”
341900	341905	341906	341906	he	440	“ Well , well ! ”
341913	341939	341906	341906	he	440	“ Everything has an end . We shall see ! So you will take me as I am , and make the best of me ? ”

341973	341980	341982	341982	Richard	291	“ You come as a godsend , ”
341984	342050	341982	341982	Richard	291	“ for I have seen nobody here yet but Vholes . Woodcourt , there is one subject I should like to mention , for once and for all , in the beginning of our treaty . You can hardly make the best of me if I do n’t . You know , I dare say , that I have an attachment to my cousin Ada ? ”
342063	342067	342069	342069	Richard	291	“ Now pray , ”
342071	342134	342069	342069	Richard	291	“ do n’t think me a heap of selfishness . Do n’t suppose that I am splitting my head and half breaking my heart over this miserable Chancery suit for my own rights and interests alone . Ada ’s are bound up with mine ; they ca n’t be separated ; Vholes works for both of us . Do think of that ! ”
342158	342162	342164	342164	Richard	291	“ You see , ”
342187	342270	342164	342164	Richard	291	“ to an upright fellow like you , bringing a friendly face like yours here , I can not bear the thought of appearing selfish and mean . I want to see Ada righted , Woodcourt , as well as myself ; I want to do my utmost to right her , as well as myself ; I venture what I can scrape together to extricate her , as well as myself . Do , I beseech you , think of that ! ”

342959	343045	342956	342956	he	245	“ you would have found Woodcourt here . There never was such a good fellow as Woodcourt is . He finds time to look in between - whiles , when anybody else with half his work to do would be thinking about not being able to come . And he is so cheery , so fresh , so sensible , so earnest , so — everything that I am not , that the place brightens whenever he comes , and darkens whenever he goes again . ”
343046	343051	343052	343052	I	0	“ God bless him , ”

343213	343266	343206	343206	Richard	291	“ it is neither a rural nor a cheerful place ; and when the sun shines here , you may lay a pretty heavy wager that it is shining brightly in an open spot . But it ’s well enough for the time . It ’s near the offices and near Vholes . ”
343267	343270	343271	343271	I	0	“ Perhaps , ”
343274	343280	343271	343271	I	0	“ a change from both — ”
343281	343287	343289	343289	Richard	291	“ Might do me good ? ”
343300	343358	343289	343289	Richard	291	“ I should n’t wonder ! But it can only come in one way now — in one of two ways , I should rather say . Either the suit must be ended , Esther , or the suitor . But it shall be the suit , my dear girl , the suit , my dear girl ! ”

Vholes knows all their windings and turnings , and we are upon them everywhere . We have astonished them already . We shall rouse up that nest of sleepers , mark my words ! ”

345856	345864	345855	345855	I.	0	“ She will succeed , my love ! ”
345916	345936	345902	345902	his	10154	“ She will succeed , my dear . Nevertheless , Bleak House is thinning fast , O little woman ! ”
346300	346315	346252	346252	they	10154	“ Guardian , you do n’t think it possible that he is justly accused ? ”
346316	346401	346410	346411	Mr. Woodcourt	440	“ My dear , I CAN’T think so . This man whom we have seen so open - hearted and compassionate , who with the might of a giant has the gentleness of a child , who looks as brave a fellow as ever lived and is so simple and quiet with it , this man justly accused of such a crime ? I ca n’t believe it . It ’s not that I do n’t or I wo n’t . I ca n’t ! ”
346402	346408	346410	346411	Mr. Woodcourt	440	“ And I ca n’t , ”
346413	346524	346410	346411	Mr. Woodcourt	440	“ Still , whatever we believe or know of him , we had better not forget that some appearances are against him . He bore an animosity towards the deceased gentleman . He has openly mentioned it in many places . He is said to have expressed himself violently towards him , and he certainly did about him , to my knowledge . He admits that he was alone on the scene of the murder within a few minutes of its commission . I sincerely believe him to be as innocent of any participation in it as I am , but these are all reasons for suspicion falling upon him . ”
346525	346528	346530	346531	my guardian	10154	“ True , ”
346541	346568	346534	346534	he	10154	“ It would be doing him a very bad service , my dear , to shut our eyes to the truth in any of these respects . ”
346622	346626	346628	346629	my guardian	10154	“ Heaven forbid ! ”
346631	346651	346652	346652	He	10154	“ We will stand by him , as he himself stood by the two poor creatures who are gone . ”
347078	347096	347098	347098	he	12478	“ This is a load off my mind , I do assure you , miss and gentlemen , ”
347111	347124	347098	347098	he	12478	“ And now I do n’t so much care how it ends . ”
347151	347167	347169	347170	Mr. George	500	“ This is even a rougher place than my gallery to receive a lady in , ”
347172	347185	347169	347170	Mr. George	500	“ but I know Miss Summerson will make the best of it . ”
347212	347219	347221	347221	he	500	“ I thank you , miss , ”
347223	347228	347221	347221	he	500	“ Now , George , ”
347233	347255	347221	347221	he	500	“ as we require no new assurances on your part , so I believe we need give you none on ours . ”
347256	347329	347330	347330	He	7684	“ Not at all , sir . I thank you with all my heart . If I was not innocent of this crime , I could n’t look at you and keep my secret to myself under the condescension of the present visit . I feel the present visit very much . I am not one of the eloquent sort , but I feel it , Miss Summerson and gentlemen , deeply . ”
347368	347371	347373	347374	my guardian	10154	“ First , ”
347376	347388	347373	347374	my guardian	10154	“ can we do anything for your personal comfort , George ? ”
347389	347395	347396	347396	he	10154	“ For which , sir ? ”
347403	347423	347396	347396	he	10154	“ For your personal comfort . Is there anything you want that would lessen the hardship of this confinement ? ”
347424	347429	347431	347431	George	500	“ Well , sir , ”
347438	347461	347431	347431	George	500	“ I am equally obliged to you , but tobacco being against the rules , I ca n’t say that there is . ”
347462	347486	347396	347396	he	10154	“ You will think of many little things perhaps , by and by . Whenever you do , George , let us know . ”
347487	347495	347497	347498	Mr. George	500	“ Thank you , sir . Howsoever , ”
347506	347545	347502	347502	his	500	“ a man who has been knocking about the world in a vagabond kind of a way as long as I have gets on well enough in a place like the present , so far as that goes . ”
347546	347554	347556	347557	my guardian	10154	“ Next , as to your case , ”
347559	347565	347567	347568	Mr. George	500	“ Exactly so , sir , ”
347586	347593	347567	347568	Mr. George	500	“ How does it stand now ? ”
347594	347656	347567	347568	Mr. George	500	“ Why , sir , it is under remand at present . Bucket gives me to understand that he will probably apply for a series of remands from time to time until the case is more complete . How it is to be made more complete I do n’t myself see , but I dare say Bucket will manage it somehow . ”
347657	347666	347673	347673	his	500	“ Why , heaven save us , man , ”
347679	347691	347673	347673	his	500	“ you talk of yourself as if you were somebody else ! ”
347692	347698	347700	347701	Mr. George	500	“ No offence , sir , ”
347703	347749	347700	347701	Mr. George	500	“ I am very sensible of your kindness . But I do n’t see how an innocent man is to make up his mind to this kind of thing without knocking his head against the walls unless he takes it in that point of view . ”
347750	347760	347762	347763	my guardian	10154	“ That is true enough to a certain extent , ”
347767	347785	347762	347763	my guardian	10154	“ But my good fellow , even an innocent man must take ordinary precautions to defend himself . ”
347786	347860	347700	347701	Mr. George	500	“ Certainly , sir . And I have done so . I have stated to the magistrates , ‘ Gentlemen , I am as innocent of this charge as yourselves ; what has been stated against me in the way of facts is perfectly true ; I know no more about it . ’ I intend to continue stating that , sir . What more can I do ? It ’s the truth . ”
347861	347870	347872	347873	my guardian	10154	“ But the mere truth wo n’t do , ”
347875	347892	347893	347894	Mr. George	500	“ Wo n’t it indeed , sir ? Rather a bad look - out for me ! ”
347900	347907	347893	347894	Mr. George	500	“ You must have a lawyer , ”
347912	347922	347893	347894	Mr. George	500	“ We must engage a good one for you . ”
347923	347931	347933	347934	Mr. George	500	“ I ask your pardon , sir , ”
347940	347960	347933	347934	Mr. George	500	“ I am equally obliged . But I must decidedly beg to be excused from anything of that sort . ”
347961	347969	347893	347894	Mr. George	500	“ You wo n’t have a lawyer ? ”
347970	347975	347976	347977	Mr. George	500	“ No , sir . ”
347987	348002	347979	347979	his	500	“ I thank you all the same , sir , but — no lawyer ! ”
348003	348007	347893	347894	Mr. George	500	“ Why not ? ”
348008	348018	348020	348021	Mr. George	500	“ I do n’t take kindly to the breed , ”
348023	348050	348020	348021	Mr. George	500	“ Gridley did n’t . And — if you ’ll excuse my saying so much — I should hardly have thought you did yourself , sir . ”
348051	348056	348057	348058	my guardian	10154	“ That ’s equity , ”
348067	348074	348057	348058	my guardian	10154	“ that ’s equity , George . ”
348075	348083	348085	348086	the trooper	12478	“ Is it , indeed , sir ? ”
348094	348117	348088	348088	his	12478	“ I am not acquainted with those shades of names myself , but in a general way I object to the breed . ”
348211	348221	348223	348223	I.	0	“ Pray think , once more , Mr. George , ”
348224	348235	348223	348223	I.	0	“ Have you no wish in reference to your case ? ”
348236	348248	348249	348249	he	12478	“ I certainly could wish it to be tried , miss , ”
348252	348308	348309	348309	He	12478	“ by court - martial ; but that is out of the question , as I am well aware . If you will be so good as to favour me with your attention for a couple of minutes , miss , not more , I ’ll endeavour to explain myself as clearly as I can . ”
348348	348482	348483	348483	He	7697	“ You see , miss , I have been handcuffed and taken into custody and brought here . I am a marked and disgraced man , and here I am . My shooting gallery is rummaged , high and low , by Bucket ; such property as I have—’tis small — is turned this way and that till it do n’t know itself ; and ( as aforesaid ) here I am ! I do n’t particular complain of that . Though I am in these present quarters through no immediately preceding fault of mine , I can very well understand that if I had n’t gone into the vagabond way in my youth , this would n’t have happened . It HAS happened . Then comes the question how to meet it . ”
348501	348517	348523	348523	he	7697	“ I am such a short - winded talker that I must think a bit . ”
348530	348690	348691	348691	He	7698	“ How to meet it . Now , the unfortunate deceased was himself a lawyer and had a pretty tight hold of me . I do n’t wish to rake up his ashes , but he had , what I should call if he was living , a devil of a tight hold of me . I do n’t like his trade the better for that . If I had kept clear of his trade , I should have kept outside this place . But that ’s not what I mean . Now , suppose I had killed him . Suppose I really had discharged into his body any one of those pistols recently fired off that Bucket has found at my place , and dear me , might have found there any day since it has been my place . What should I have done as soon as I was hard and fast here ? Got a lawyer . ”
348727	348908	348909	348909	He	7699	“ I should have got a lawyer , and he would have said ( as I have often read in the newspapers ) , ‘ My client says nothing , my client reserves his defence ’ : my client this , that , and t’other . Well , ’ tis not the custom of that breed to go straight , according to my opinion , or to think that other men do . Say I am innocent and I get a lawyer . He would be as likely to believe me guilty as not ; perhaps more . What would he do , whether or not ? Act as if I was — shut my mouth up , tell me not to commit myself , keep circumstances back , chop the evidence small , quibble , and get me off perhaps ! But , Miss Summerson , do I care for getting off in that way ; or would I rather be hanged in my own way — if you ’ll excuse my mentioning anything so disagreeable to a lady ? ”
348928	348952	348958	348958	his	7699	“ I would rather be hanged in my own way . And I mean to be ! I do n’t intend to say , ”
348968	349088	348963	348963	his	7699	“ that I am more partial to being hanged than another man . What I say is , I must come off clear and full or not at all . Therefore , when I hear stated against me what is true , I say it ’s true ; and when they tell me , ‘ whatever you say will be used , ’ I tell them I do n’t mind that ; I mean it to be used . If they ca n’t make me innocent out of the whole truth , they are not likely to do it out of anything less , or anything else . And if they are , it ’s worth nothing to me . ”
349113	349275	349099	349099	he	7699	“ I thank you , miss and gentlemen both , many times for your attention , and many times more for your interest . That ’s the plain state of the matter as it points itself out to a mere trooper with a blunt broadsword kind of a mind . I have never done well in life beyond my duty as a soldier , and if the worst comes after all , I shall reap pretty much as I have sown . When I got over the first crash of being seized as a murderer — it do n’t take a rover who has knocked about so much as myself so very long to recover from a crash — I worked my way round to what you find me now . As such I shall remain . No relations will be disgraced by me or made unhappy for me , and — and that ’s all I ’ve got to say . ”
349365	349391	349354	349354	He	500	“ Miss Summerson and gentlemen , this is an old comrade of mine , Matthew Bagnet . And this is his wife , Mrs. Bagnet . ”
349409	349419	349402	349403	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Real good friends of mine , they are , ”
349424	349434	349402	349403	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ It was at their house I was taken . ”
349435	349443	349444	349445	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ With a second - hand wiolinceller , ”
349454	349471	349450	349450	his	542	“ Of a good tone . For a friend . That money was no object to . ”
349472	349475	349477	349478	Mr. George	500	“ Mat , ”
349480	349506	349477	349478	Mr. George	500	“ you have heard pretty well all I have been saying to this lady and these two gentlemen . I know it meets your approval ? ”
349520	349524	349526	349526	he	542	“ Old girl , ”
349528	349541	349526	349526	he	542	“ Tell him . Whether or not . It meets my approval . ”
349542	349547	349549	349550	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Why , George , ”
349581	349643	349660	349661	the trooper	12478	“ you ought to know it do n’t . You ought to know it ’s enough to drive a person wild to hear you . You wo n’t be got off this way , and you wo n’t be got off that way — what do you mean by such picking and choosing ? It ’s stuff and nonsense , George . ”
349644	349658	349660	349661	the trooper	12478	“ Do n’t be severe upon me in my misfortunes , Mrs. Bagnet , ”
349664	349671	349673	349674	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Oh ! Bother your misfortunes , ”
349676	349744	349673	349674	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ if they do n’t make you more reasonable than that comes to . I never was so ashamed in my life to hear a man talk folly as I have been to hear you talk this day to the present company . Lawyers ? Why , what but too many cooks should hinder you from having a dozen lawyers if the gentleman recommended them to you . ”
349745	349753	349755	349756	my guardian	10154	“ This is a very sensible woman , ”
349758	349769	349755	349756	my guardian	10154	“ I hope you will persuade him , Mrs. Bagnet . ”
349770	349776	349777	349777	she	7708	“ Persuade him , sir ? ”
349780	349797	349798	349799	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Lord bless you , no . You do n’t know George . Now , there ! ”
349814	349889	349891	349892	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ There he stands ! As self - willed and as determined a man , in the wrong way , as ever put a human creature under heaven out of patience ! You could as soon take up and shoulder an eight and forty pounder by your own strength as turn that man when he has got a thing into his head and fixed it there . Why , do n’t I know him ! ”
349894	349924	349891	349892	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Do n’t I know you , George ! You do n’t mean to set up for a new character with ME after all these years , I hope ? ”
349987	350004	350009	350009	she	543	“ But I have given up talking to you , old fellow , years and years , ”
350024	350065	350009	350009	she	543	“ and when ladies and gentlemen know you as well as I do , they ’ll give up talking to you too . If you are not too headstrong to accept of a bit of dinner , here it is . ”
350066	350074	350076	350077	the trooper	12478	“ I accept it with many thanks , ”
350079	350086	350088	350089	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Do you though , indeed ? ”
350099	350138	350088	350089	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ I ’m sure I ’m surprised at that . I wonder you do n’t starve in your own way also . It would only be like you . Perhaps you ’ll set your mind upon THAT next . ”
350194	350207	350209	350209	I	0	“ We hope you will think better of it , Mr. George , ”
350211	350228	350209	350209	I	0	“ and we shall come to see you again , trusting to find you more reasonable . ”
350229	350242	350243	350243	he	440	“ More grateful , Miss Summerson , you ca n’t find me , ”
350246	350256	350258	350258	I.	0	“ But more persuadable we can , I hope , ”
350259	350295	350296	350296	He	440	“ And let me entreat you to consider that the clearing up of this mystery and the discovery of the real perpetrator of this deed may be of the last importance to others besides yourself . ”
350349	350354	350356	350356	he	440	“ ’ Tis curious , ”
350358	350368	350356	350356	he	440	“ And yet I thought so at the time ! ”
350377	350382	350383	350383	he	440	“ Why , sir , ”
350386	350432	350383	350383	he	440	“ when my ill fortune took me to the dead man ’s staircase on the night of his murder , I saw a shape so like Miss Summerson ’s go by me in the dark that I had half a mind to speak to it . ”
350456	350465	350467	350468	the trooper	12478	“ It came downstairs as I went up , ”
350470	350521	350467	350468	the trooper	12478	“ and crossed the moonlighted window with a loose black mantle on ; I noticed a deep fringe to it . However , it has nothing to do with the present subject , excepting that Miss Summerson looked so like it at the moment that it came into my head . ”
350656	350674	350676	350676	her	543	“ I did n’t let George see what I thought about it , you know , miss , ”
350684	350697	350676	350676	her	543	“ but he ’s in a bad way , poor old fellow ! ”
350698	350708	350710	350711	my guardian	10154	“ Not with care and prudence and good help , ”
350713	350725	350727	350728	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ A gentleman like you ought to know best , sir , ”
350742	350813	350727	350728	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ but I am uneasy for him . He has been so careless and said so much that he never meant . The gentlemen of the juries might not understand him as Lignum and me do . And then such a number of circumstances have happened bad for him , and such a number of people will be brought forward to speak against him , and Bucket is so deep . ”
350814	350833	350834	350835	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ With a second - hand wiolinceller . And said he played the fife . When a boy , ”
350841	350850	350852	350853	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Now , I tell you , miss , ”
350855	350880	350852	350853	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ and when I say miss , I mean all ! Just come into the corner of the wall and I ’ll tell you ! ”
350905	350912	350900	350901	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ Old girl ! Tell ’em ! ”
350913	350920	350921	350923	the old girl	4707	“ Why , then , miss , ”
350936	350968	350921	350923	the old girl	4707	“ you could as soon move Dover Castle as move George on this point unless you had got a new power to move him with . And I have got it ! ”
350969	350978	350980	350981	my guardian	10154	“ You are a jewel of a woman , ”
350983	350987	350980	350981	my guardian	10154	“ Go on ! ”
350988	350997	350998	350998	she	4707	“ Now , I tell you , miss , ”
351016	351097	350998	350998	she	4707	“ that what he says concerning no relations is all bosh . They do n’t know of him , but he does know of them . He has said more to me at odd times than to anybody else , and it warn’t for nothing that he once spoke to my Woolwich about whitening and wrinkling mothers ’ heads . For fifty pounds he had seen his mother that day . She ’s alive and must be brought here straight ! ”
351135	351138	351140	351141	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ Lignum , ”
351143	351172	351140	351141	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ you take care of the children , old man , and give me the umbrella ! I ’m away to Lincolnshire to bring that old lady here . ”
351173	351180	351185	351185	his	10154	“ But , bless the woman , ”
351191	351203	351204	351205	Mrs. Bagnet	543	“ how is she going ? What money has she got ? ”
351237	351265	351229	351229	she	4707	“ Never you mind for me , miss . I ’m a soldier ’s wife and accustomed to travel my own way . Lignum , old boy , ”
351269	351290	351292	351292	she	4707	“ one for yourself , three for the children . Now I ’m away into Lincolnshire after George ’s mother ! ”
351330	351334	351336	351337	my guardian	10154	“ Mr. Bagnet , ”
351339	351351	351336	351337	my guardian	10154	“ Do you mean to let her go in that way ? ”
351352	351358	351359	351359	he	10154	“ Ca n’t help it , ”
351362	351410	351336	351337	my guardian	10154	“ Made her way home once from another quarter of the world . With the same grey cloak . And same umbrella . Whatever the old girl says , do . Do it ! Whenever the old girl says , I’LL do it . She does it . ”
351411	351423	351425	351426	my guardian	10154	“ Then she is as honest and genuine as she looks , ”
351428	351439	351460	351460	his	542	“ and it is impossible to say more for her . ”
351440	351451	351453	351454	Mr. Bagnet	542	“ She ’s Colour - Sergeant of the Nonpareil battalion , ”
351469	351491	351463	351463	he	542	“ And there ’s not such another . But I never own to it before her . Discipline must be maintained . ”
352259	352270	352275	352275	himself	668	“ And there you are , my partner , eh ? ”
352296	352318	352278	352279	Mrs. Bucket	653	“ And so you are . And so you are ! And very well indeed you are looking , Mrs. Bucket ! ”
352389	352399	352400	352400	he	668	“ There you are , my partner , eh ? ”
352404	352434	352400	352400	he	668	“ And our lodger with you . I ’m taking notice of you , Mrs. Bucket ; I hope you ’re all right in your health , my dear ! ”
352728	352743	352724	352724	Mercury	277	“ Here ’s another letter for you , Mr. Bucket , come by post , ”
352749	352755	352757	352758	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Another one , eh ? ”
352814	352823	352825	352826	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Do you happen to carry a box ? ”
352836	352846	352848	352849	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Could you fetch me a pinch from anywheres ? ”
352851	352873	352848	352849	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Thankee . It do n’t matter what it is ; I ’m not particular as to the kind . Thankee ! ”
353081	353085	353087	353088	Mr. Bucket	668	“ And this , ”
353097	353112	353087	353088	Mr. Bucket	668	“ is in the same hand , and consists of the same two words . ”
353153	353157	353117	353117	He	668	“ Lady Dedlock . ”
353158	353163	353165	353166	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Yes , yes , ”
353168	353181	353165	353166	Mr. Bucket	668	“ But I could have made the money without this anonymous information . ”
353359	353362	353363	353363	he	668	“ No , ”
353366	353398	353363	353363	he	668	“ there ’s none in that hand . It ’s only me as is written to . I can break it to Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to - morrow . ”
353504	353522	353500	353500	it	7814	“ You are a swell about town , and you know me , and I know you . ”
353538	353548	353550	353551	Sir Leicester	266	“ Have you anything new to communicate , officer ? ”
353553	353566	353550	353551	Sir Leicester	266	“ Do you wish to hold any conversation with me in private ? ”
353567	353581	353613	353614	Mr. Bucket	668	“ Why — not to - night , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ”
353582	353587	353589	353590	Sir Leicester	266	“ Because my time , ”
353592	353612	353613	353614	Mr. Bucket	668	“ is wholly at your disposal with a view to the vindication of the outraged majesty of the law . ”
353632	353660	353627	353627	he	668	“ I do assure you , you ’re a pretty creetur . I ’ve seen hundreds worse looking at your time of life , I have indeed . ”
353714	353720	353693	353694	Mr. Bucket	668	“ If I have not , ”
353725	353801	353722	353723	Sir Leicester	266	“ in the most emphatic manner , adjured you , officer , to exercise your utmost skill in this atrocious case , I particularly desire to take the present opportunity of rectifying any omission I may have made . Let no expense be a consideration . I am prepared to defray all charges . You can incur none in pursuit of the object you have undertaken that I shall hesitate for a moment to bear . ”
353817	353821	353822	353823	Sir Leicester	266	“ My mind , ”
353830	353890	353822	353823	Sir Leicester	266	“ has not , as may be easily supposed , recovered its tone since the late diabolical occurrence . It is not likely ever to recover its tone . But it is full of indignation to - night after undergoing the ordeal of consigning to the tomb the remains of a faithful , a zealous , a devoted adherent . ”
353920	353924	353925	353925	he	266	“ I declare , ”
353928	354128	353925	353925	he	266	“ I solemnly declare that until this crime is discovered and , in the course of justice , punished , I almost feel as if there were a stain upon my name . A gentleman who has devoted a large portion of his life to me , a gentleman who has devoted the last day of his life to me , a gentleman who has constantly sat at my table and slept under my roof , goes from my house to his own , and is struck down within an hour of his leaving my house . I can not say but that he may have been followed from my house , watched at my house , even first marked because of his association with my house — which may have suggested his possessing greater wealth and being altogether of greater importance than his own retiring demeanour would have indicated . If I can not with my means and influence and my position bring all the perpetrators of such a crime to light , I fail in the assertion of my respect for that gentleman ’s memory and of my fidelity towards one who was ever faithful to me . ”
354180	354188	354190	354191	Sir Leicester	266	“ The ceremony of to - day , ”
354193	354203	354190	354191	Sir Leicester	266	“ strikingly illustrative of the respect in which my deceased friend”—he
354215	354259	354190	354191	Sir Leicester	266	distinctions—“was held by the flower of the land , has , I say , aggravated the shock I have received from this most horrible and audacious crime . If it were my brother who had committed it , I would not spare him . ”
354280	354293	354295	354296	Mr. Bucket	668	“ You must feel it as a deprivation to you , miss , ”
354299	354317	354295	354296	Mr. Bucket	668	“ no doubt . He was calculated to BE a deprivation , I ’m sure he was . ”
354391	354401	354403	354404	Mr. Bucket	668	“ It gives a start to a delicate female , ”
354407	354414	354403	354404	Mr. Bucket	668	“ but it ’ll wear off . ”
354469	354476	354491	354491	his	668	“ Why you see , miss , ”
354499	354501	354495	354495	he	668	“ my dear”—“it
354534	354548	354495	354495	he	668	” whom Mr. Bucket takes into the conversation in right of his importance , “
354624	354629	354630	354630	his	266	it”—Mr . Bucket again looks grave—“to
354633	354682	354618	354618	I	0	” The debilitated cousin only hopes some fler’ll be executed — zample . Thinks more interest ’s wanted — get man hanged presentime — than get man place ten thousand a year . Has n’t a doubt — zample — far better hang wrong fler than no fler . “
354692	354709	354687	354687	you	7826	” says Mr. Bucket with a complimentary twinkle of his eye and crook of his finger , “
354769	354781	354767	354767	miss	9584	” says Mr. Bucket , quite reddening at another narrow escape from “
354785	354786	354767	354767	miss	9584	” “
354792	354797	354801	354801	his	7836	” observes Sir Leicester , “
354808	354813	354801	354801	his	7836	” Mr. Bucket murmurs , “
354829	354830	354834	354834	Volumnia	552	” “
354836	354841	354834	354834	Volumnia	552	” proceeds Sir Leicester , “
354910	354931	354876	354876	he	7838	” says Sir Leicester somewhat sternly , for Volumnia was going to cut in before he had rounded his sentence , “
354939	354989	354993	354993	Volumnia	552	” Volumnia with all humility explains that she had not merely the plea of curiosity to urge ( in common with the giddy youth of her sex in general ) but that she is perfectly dying with regret and interest for the darling man whose loss they all deplore . “
354995	355000	354993	354993	Volumnia	552	” returns Sir Leicester . “
355009	355023	355002	355002	you	552	” Mr. Bucket takes the opportunity of a pause to be heard again . “
355088	355089	355090	355090	I	0	” “
355099	355104	355090	355090	I	0	” says Sir Leicester . “
355110	355111	355090	355090	I	0	” “
355118	355125	355116	355116	Baronet	2240	” returns Mr. Bucket very seriously , “
355159	355171	355157	355157	miss	9584	” Mr. Bucket goes on , glancing gravely at Sir Leicester , “
355224	355236	355215	355215	you	552	” Volumnia , with her innocent little scream , supposes so . “
355255	355267	355268	355268	I	0	” says Mr. Bucket , again gravely eyeing Sir Leicester aside . “
355306	355313	355289	355289	I	0	” this to the debilitated cousin , “
355319	355341	355342	355342	Vayli	671	” The cousin , who has been casting sofa - pillows on his head , in a prostration of boredom yawns , “
355344	355351	355342	355342	Vayli	671	” being the used - up for “
355355	355374	355342	355342	Vayli	671	” Sir Leicester , deeming it time to dismiss the officer , here majestically interposes with the words , “
355381	355418	355379	355379	you	552	” and also with a wave of his hand , implying not only that there is an end of the discourse , but that if high families fall into low habits they must take the consequences . “
355426	355432	355424	355424	officer	16347	” he adds with condescension , “
355443	355479	355434	355434	I	0	” Mr. Bucket ( still grave ) inquires if to - morrow morning , now , would suit , in case he should be as for’ard as he expects to be . Sir Leicester replies , “
355487	355505	355434	355434	I	0	” Mr. Bucket makes his three bows and is withdrawing when a forgotten point occurs to him . “
355514	355525	355507	355507	I	0	” he says in a low voice , cautiously returning , “
355536	355537	355538	355538	I	0	” “
355547	355552	355538	355538	I	0	” replies Sir Leicester . “
355574	355575	355538	355538	I	0	” “
355651	355741	355639	355639	you	16347	” Mr. Bucket sees none now ; the bill having been put up , had better not be taken down . Repeating his three bows he withdraws , closing the door on Volumnia ’s little scream , which is a preliminary to her remarking that that charmingly horrible person is a perfect Blue Chamber . In his fondness for society and his adaptability to all grades , Mr. Bucket is presently standing before the hall - fire — bright and warm on the early winter night — admiring Mercury . “
355753	355758	355744	355744	you	7863	” says Mr. Bucket . “
355761	355765	355744	355744	you	7863	” says Mercury . “
355809	355834	355804	355804	you	7863	” Mr. Bucket asks , conveying the expression of an artist into the turn of his eye and head . Mercury never was modelled . “
355844	355849	355836	355836	you	7863	” says Mr. Bucket ; “
355891	355892	355889	355889	she	958	” “
355897	355898	355908	355908	she	958	” “
355910	355911	355908	355908	she	958	” “
355914	355915	355908	355908	she	958	” “
355922	355927	355908	355908	she	958	” says Mr. Bucket . “
355972	355978	355979	355979	Mine	0	” Answer in the negative . “
355982	355987	355979	355979	Mine	0	” says Mr. Bucket . “
356064	356068	356058	356059	My Lady	958	” Mercury replies , “
356076	356077	356058	356059	My Lady	958	” “
356080	356085	356058	356059	My Lady	958	” says Mr. Bucket . “
356122	356173	356120	356120	we	7881	” Mercury , with his hands in the pockets of his bright peach - blossom small - clothes , stretches his symmetrical silk legs with the air of a man of gallantry and ca n’t deny it . Come the roll of wheels and a violent ringing at the bell . “
356179	356184	356120	356120	we	7881	” says Mr. Bucket . “
356189	356274	356186	356186	she	958	” The doors are thrown open , and she passes through the hall . Still very pale , she is dressed in slight mourning and wears two beautiful bracelets . Either their beauty or the beauty of her arms is particularly attractive to Mr. Bucket . He looks at them with an eager eye and rattles something in his pocket — halfpence perhaps . Noticing him at his distance , she turns an inquiring look on the other Mercury who has brought her home . “
356281	356302	356275	356276	Mr. Bucket	668	” Mr. Bucket makes a leg and comes forward , passing his familiar demon over the region of his mouth . “
356311	356312	356304	356304	you	958	” “
356323	356324	356315	356316	my Lady	958	” “
356333	356334	356326	356326	you	958	” “
356343	356344	356340	356341	my Lady	958	” “
356352	356353	356346	356346	you	958	” “
356360	356435	356346	356346	you	958	” This is merely in passing . She scarcely makes a stop , and sweeps upstairs alone . Mr. Bucket , moving towards the staircase - foot , watches her as she goes up the steps the old man came down to his grave , past murderous groups of statuary repeated with their shadowy weapons on the wall , past the printed bill , which she looks at going by , out of view . “
356448	356458	356444	356444	she	958	” says Mr. Bucket , coming back to Mercury . “
356466	356522	356444	356444	she	958	” Is not quite healthy , Mercury informs him . Suffers much from headaches . Really ? That ’s a pity ! Walking , Mr. Bucket would recommend for that . Well , she tries walking , Mercury rejoins . Walks sometimes for two hours when she has them bad . By night , too . “
356536	356541	356524	356524	you	958	” asks Mr. Bucket . “
356551	356558	356524	356524	you	958	” Not a doubt about it . “
356602	356627	356593	356593	she	958	” Oh , yes . When it ’s moonlight ! Of course . Oh , of course ! Conversational and acquiescent on both sides . “
356640	356645	356638	356638	yourself	958	” says Mr. Bucket . “
356656	356670	356638	356638	yourself	958	” Besides which , Mercury do n’t like it . Prefers carriage exercise . “
356675	356680	356638	356638	yourself	958	” says Mr. Bucket . “
356692	356707	356708	356708	she	958	” says Mr. Bucket , warming his hands and looking pleasantly at the blaze , “
356719	356720	356724	356724	she	958	” “
356737	356738	356727	356727	I	0	” “
356754	356755	356750	356750	you	0	” “
356762	356766	356756	356756	I	0	” says Mercury . “
356774	356779	356767	356767	I	0	” returns Mr. Bucket , “
356850	356851	356859	356859	You	0	” “
356857	356858	356859	356859	You	0	” “
356892	356893	356896	356896	she	958	” “
356899	357089	356896	356896	she	958	” Of course she was . Mr. Bucket must return to a little work he has to get on with upstairs , but he must shake hands with Mercury in acknowledgment of his agreeable conversation , and will he — this is all he asks — will he , when he has a leisure half - hour , think of bestowing it on that Royal Academy sculptor , for the advantage of both parties ? CHAPTER LIV Springing a Mine Refreshed by sleep , Mr. Bucket rises betimes in the morning and prepares for a field - day . Smartened up by the aid of a clean shirt and a wet hairbrush , with which instrument , on occasions of ceremony , he lubricates such thin locks as remain to him after his life of severe study , Mr. Bucket lays in a breakfast of two mutton chops as a foundation to work upon , together with tea , eggs , toast , and marmalade on a corresponding scale . Having much enjoyed these strengthening matters and having held subtle conference with his familiar demon , he confidently instructs Mercury “
357115	357296	357297	357297	I	0	” A gracious message being returned that Sir Leicester will expedite his dressing and join Mr. Bucket in the library within ten minutes , Mr. Bucket repairs to that apartment and stands before the fire with his finger on his chin , looking at the blazing coals . Thoughtful Mr. Bucket is , as a man may be with weighty work to do , but composed , sure , confident . From the expression of his face he might be a famous whist - player for a large stake — say a hundred guineas certain — with the game in his hand , but with a high reputation involved in his playing his hand out to the last card in a masterly way . Not in the least anxious or disturbed is Mr. Bucket when Sir Leicester appears , but he eyes the baronet aside as he comes slowly to his easy - chair with that observant gravity of yesterday in which there might have been yesterday , but for the audacity of the idea , a touch of compassion . “
357348	357371	357343	357343	I	0	gout”—Sir Leicester was going to say indisposition and would have said it to anybody else , but Mr. Bucket palpably knows all about it—“and
357379	357415	357416	357416	I	0	” As he takes his seat with some difficulty and with an air of pain , Mr. Bucket draws a little nearer , standing with one of his large hands on the library - table . “
357423	357435	357437	357437	you	7898	” Sir Leicester observes ; raising his eyes to his face , “
357469	357470	357463	357464	Miss Dedlock	625	” “
357479	357501	357477	357477	Baronet	2240	” returns Mr. Bucket with his head persuasively on one side and his forefinger pendant at one ear like an earring , “
357576	357577	357567	357567	I	0	” “
357582	357583	357567	357567	I	0	” “
357594	357599	357567	357567	I	0	” Mr. Bucket resumes , “
357618	357619	357601	357601	I	0	” “
357624	357665	357601	357601	I	0	” Mr. Bucket skilfully and softly takes that precaution , stooping on his knee for a moment from mere force of habit so to adjust the key in the lock as that no one shall peep in from the outerside . “
357704	357705	357719	357720	the soldier	7908	” “
357710	357711	357707	357708	the soldier	7908	” “
357722	357730	357719	357720	the soldier	7908	” Sir Leicester looks astounded and inquires , “
357737	357747	357750	357751	a woman	718	” Mr. Bucket tells him , after a pause , “
357753	357766	357750	357751	a woman	718	” Sir Leicester leans back in his chair , and breathlessly ejaculates , “
357770	357771	357750	357751	a woman	718	” “
357780	357808	357750	357751	a woman	718	” Mr. Bucket begins , standing over him with one hand spread out on the library - table and the forefinger of the other in impressive use , “
358005	358028	357996	357996	you	266	” Sir Leicester , leaning back in his chair and grasping the elbows , sits looking at him with a stony face . “
358035	358040	358031	358033	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” proceeds Mr. Bucket , “
358192	358193	358194	358194	I	0	” “
358201	358218	358194	358194	I	0	” returns Sir Leicester after a silence , without moving hand , foot , or feature , “
358244	358254	358301	358302	Lady Dedlock	264	Also”—Sir Leicester seems to shrink in the shadow of his figure—“also
358267	358282	358285	358287	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” None at all . Mr. Bucket brings a chair and diminishes his shadow . “
358304	358329	358301	358302	Lady Dedlock	264	” Sir Leicester raises himself in his seat and stares at him fiercely . Mr. Bucket brings the finger into play as an emollient . “
358352	358357	358347	358347	she	264	” says Mr. Bucket . “
358365	358371	358347	358347	she	264	” Sir Leicester returns stiffly , “
358383	358384	358387	358387	I	0	” “
358401	358402	358387	358387	I	0	” “
358405	358413	358414	358416	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” Mr. Bucket shakes his relentless head . “
358445	358446	358447	358447	Officer	16347	” “
358449	358462	358463	358463	you	16347	” retorts Sir Leicester with a fiery eye and a quivering lip , “
358524	358525	358526	358528	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” “
358543	358544	358532	358532	I	0	” “
358563	358605	358561	358561	sir	9496	” Glancing at the angry eyes which now avoid him and at the angry figure trembling from head to foot , yet striving to be still , Mr. Bucket feels his way with his forefinger and in a low voice proceeds . “
358633	358634	358620	358623	the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn	7936	” “
358659	358711	358712	358714	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” exclaims Sir Leicester , striking his hand upon the table . But in the very heat and fury of the act he stops , fixed by the knowing eyes of Mr. Bucket , whose forefinger is slowly going and who , with mingled confidence and patience , shakes his head . “
358817	358825	358830	358831	her husband	10066	” Mr. Bucket stops and deliberately repeats , “
359135	359159	359160	359160	You	7949	” Sir Leicester sits like a statue , gazing at the cruel finger that is probing the life - blood of his heart . “
359256	359431	359434	359436	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” Sir Leicester , who has covered his face with his hands , uttering a single groan , requests him to pause for a moment . By and by he takes his hands away , and so preserves his dignity and outward calmness , though there is no more colour in his face than in his white hair , that Mr. Bucket is a little awed by him . Something frozen and fixed is upon his manner , over and above its usual shell of haughtiness , and Mr. Bucket soon detects an unusual slowness in his speech , with now and then a curious trouble in beginning , which occasions him to utter inarticulate sounds . With such sounds he now breaks silence , soon , however , controlling himself to say that he does not comprehend why a gentleman so faithful and zealous as the late Mr. Tulkinghorn should have communicated to him nothing of this painful , this distressing , this unlooked - for , this overwhelming , this incredible intelligence . “
359440	359445	359434	359436	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” returns Mr. Bucket , “
359589	359606	359586	359586	you	2240	” True . Sir Leicester , avoiding , with some trouble those obtrusive sounds , says , “
359609	359659	359586	359586	you	2240	” At this juncture a considerable noise of voices is heard in the hall . Mr. Bucket , after listening , goes to the library - door , softly unlocks and opens it , and listens again . Then he draws in his head and whispers hurriedly but composedly , “
359743	359749	359750	359750	Officer	16347	” Sir Leicester indistinctly answers , “
359762	359879	359754	359754	you	2240	” and Mr. Bucket , with a nod and a sagacious crook of the forefinger , slips down into the hall , where the voices quickly die away . He is not long in returning ; a few paces ahead of Mercury and a brother deity also powdered and in peach - blossomed smalls , who bear between them a chair in which is an incapable old man . Another man and two women come behind . Directing the pitching of the chair in an affable and easy manner , Mr. Bucket dismisses the Mercuries and locks the door again . Sir Leicester looks on at this invasion of the sacred precincts with an icy stare . “
359892	359901	359883	359883	you	2240	” says Mr. Bucket in a confidential voice . “
359916	359931	359933	359933	my	0	” producing the tip of his convenient little staff from his breast - pocket , “
359992	359993	359987	359987	I	0	” “
360005	360015	360016	360016	You	0	” cries Mr. Smallweed in a shrill loud voice . “
360031	360046	360029	360029	you	0	” retorts Mr. Bucket with a steadfast look , but without loss of temper . “
360049	360050	360029	360029	you	0	” “
360057	360062	360053	360053	they	7988	” says Mr. Bucket , “
360105	360106	360103	360103	you	0	” “
360109	360114	360103	360103	you	0	” snarls Mr. Smallweed , “
360120	360121	360115	360116	my wife	2116	” “
360169	360174	360152	360152	I	0	” says Mr. Bucket . “
360187	360188	360175	360177	This other gentleman	7991	” “
360193	360207	360191	360191	Chadband	471	” Mr. Smallweed puts in , speaking henceforth in a much lower key . “
360220	360229	360210	360211	a friend	11603	” says Mr. Bucket , offering his hand , “
360244	360245	360238	360239	Mrs. Chadband	471	” “
360250	360255	360256	360256	Husband	674	” Mr. Smallweed introduces . “
360268	360273	360256	360256	Husband	674	” says Mr. Bucket . “
360286	360287	360289	360289	you	0	” “
360298	360313	360289	360289	you	0	” Mr. Smallweed asks , a little dashed by the suddenness of this turn . “
360341	360385	360388	360388	You	0	” Mr. Smallweed , beckoning Mr. Chadband , takes a moment ’s counsel with him in a whisper . Mr. Chadband , expressing a considerable amount of oil from the pores of his forehead and the palms of his hands , says aloud , “
360391	360399	360400	360400	I	0	” and retires to his former place . “
360410	360416	360417	360417	I	0	” pipes Grandfather Smallweed then ; “
360647	360670	360641	360641	I	0	” Here Mr. Smallweed , seized with a fit of coughing in the midst of his triumph , breaks off to ejaculate , “
360687	360688	360680	360680	I	0	” “
360696	360705	360692	360692	you	8010	” says Mr. Bucket after awaiting his recovery , “
360726	360727	360719	360720	the gentleman	1128	” “
360738	360743	360735	360736	Mr. Bucket	668	” cries Grandfather Smallweed . “
360829	360830	360811	360811	I	0	” “
360846	360851	360833	360833	he	269	” says Mr. Bucket . “
360947	360948	360939	360939	I	0	” “
360955	360979	360950	360950	I	0	” says Mr. Bucket , instantaneously altering his manner , coming close to him , and communicating an extraordinary fascination to the forefinger , “
361062	361103	361037	361037	you	0	” Such is the dread power of the man , and so terribly evident it is that he makes no idle boast , that Mr. Smallweed begins to apologize . Mr. Bucket , dismissing his sudden anger , checks him . “
361207	361238	361241	361241	you	0	” Mr. Smallweed looks , with greedy eyes , at the little bundle Mr. Bucket produces from a mysterious part of his coat , and identifies it as the same . “
361247	361252	361241	361241	you	0	” asks Mr. Bucket . “
361274	361275	361270	361270	you	0	” “
361282	361283	361286	361286	you	0	” “
361294	361312	361290	361290	you	0	” says Mr. Bucket humorously . It appears , however , that Mr. Smallweed means five hundred . “
361340	361350	361351	361351	you	0	” says Mr. Bucket — Sir Leicester mechanically bows his head—“and
361391	361403	361385	361385	you	0	” Mr. Smallweed is quite clear that he had better not . “
361406	361411	361385	361385	you	0	” says Mr. Bucket , “
361451	361484	361439	361439	he	8025	” Thus invited , Mr. Chadband steps forth , and after a little sleek smiling and a little oil - grinding with the palms of his hands , delivers himself as follows , “
361623	361624	361625	361625	You	0	” “
361635	361643	361632	361632	you	0	” returns Mr. Bucket , very attentive , “
361670	361671	361664	361664	You	0	” “
361685	361694	361664	361664	You	0	” says Mr. Chadband with a cunning eye , “
361706	361735	361699	361699	Rachael	279	” Mrs. Chadband , more than ready , so advances as to jostle her husband into the background and confronts Mr. Bucket with a hard , frowning smile . “
361745	361749	361737	361737	you	0	” says she , “
361828	361845	361846	361846	ladyship	8045	” With these words , and a laugh , and laying a bitter stress on the word “
361848	361861	361846	361846	ladyship	8045	” Mrs. Chadband folds her arms and looks implacably at Mr. Bucket . “
361866	361871	361862	361862	I	0	” returns that officer , “
361889	361900	361872	361872	YOU	0	” Mrs. Chadband merely laughs and contemptuously tells him he can “
361902	361906	361907	361907	My	0	” twenty pence . “
361920	361933	361907	361907	My	0	” says Mr. Bucket , luring Mrs. Snagsby forward with the finger . “
361942	362165	361907	361907	My	0	” Mrs. Snagsby is at first prevented , by tears and lamentations , from stating the nature of her game , but by degrees it confusedly comes to light that she is a woman overwhelmed with injuries and wrongs , whom Mr. Snagsby has habitually deceived , abandoned , and sought to keep in darkness , and whose chief comfort , under her afflictions , has been the sympathy of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn , who showed so much commiseration for her on one occasion of his calling in Cook ’s Court in the absence of her perjured husband that she has of late habitually carried to him all her woes . Everybody it appears , the present company excepted , has plotted against Mrs. Snagsby ’s peace . There is Mr. Guppy , clerk to Kenge and Carboy , who was at first as open as the sun at noon , but who suddenly shut up as close as midnight , under the influence — no doubt — of Mr. Snagsby ’s suborning and tampering . There is Mr. Weevle , friend of Mr. Guppy , who lived mysteriously up a court , owing to the like coherent causes . There was Krook , deceased ; there was Nimrod , deceased ; and there was Jo , deceased ; and they were “
362170	362193	361907	361907	My	0	” In what , Mrs. Snagsby does not with particularity express , but she knows that Jo was Mr. Snagsby ’s son , “
362204	362550	361907	361907	My	0	” and she followed Mr. Snagsby when he went on his last visit to the boy , and if he was not his son why did he go ? The one occupation of her life has been , for some time back , to follow Mr. Snagsby to and fro , and up and down , and to piece suspicious circumstances together — and every circumstance that has happened has been most suspicious ; and in this way she has pursued her object of detecting and confounding her false husband , night and day . Thus did it come to pass that she brought the Chadbands and Mr. Tulkinghorn together , and conferred with Mr. Tulkinghorn on the change in Mr. Guppy , and helped to turn up the circumstances in which the present company are interested , casually , by the wayside , being still and ever on the great high road that is to terminate in Mr. Snagsby ’s full exposure and a matrimonial separation . All this , Mrs. Snagsby , as an injured woman , and the friend of Mrs. Chadband , and the follower of Mr. Chadband , and the mourner of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn , is here to certify under the seal of confidence , with every possible confusion and involvement possible and impossible , having no pecuniary motive whatever , no scheme or project but the one mentioned , and bringing here , and taking everywhere , her own dense atmosphere of dust , arising from the ceaseless working of her mill of jealousy . While this exordium is in hand — and it takes some time — Mr. Bucket , who has seen through the transparency of Mrs. Snagsby ’s vinegar at a glance , confers with his familiar demon and bestows his shrewd attention on the Chadbands and Mr. Smallweed . Sir Leicester Dedlock remains immovable , with the same icy surface upon him , except that he once or twice looks towards Mr. Bucket , as relying on that officer alone of all mankind . “
362554	362559	361907	361907	My	0	” says Mr. Bucket . “
362585	362597	362561	362561	I	0	” again Sir Leicester mechanically bows in confirmation of the statement , “
362684	362685	362680	362680	I	0	” “
362692	362697	362686	362686	We	8050	” pleads Mr. Smallweed . “
362708	362715	362702	362702	you	8049	” Mr. Bucket asserts with cheerfulness ; “
362819	362830	362831	362831	I	0	” says Mr. Bucket in an argumentative and friendly way . “
362850	362855	362839	362842	one of the servants	8056	” returns Mr. Smallweed . “
362897	362898	362888	362888	I	0	” “
362908	362914	362888	362888	I	0	” Mrs. Chadband sternly demands . “
362931	362938	362939	362939	I	0	” replies Mr. Bucket with gallantry . “
362967	362968	362961	362961	his	475	” “
362972	362977	362961	362961	his	475	” exclaims Mr. Smallweed . “
362985	362997	362961	362961	his	475	” Mr. Bucket has his hand on the bell - rope . “
363019	363070	362999	362999	I	0	” he asks in an insinuating tone . Nobody having the hardihood to object to his doing so , he does it , and the party retire as they came up . Mr. Bucket follows them to the door , and returning , says with an air of serious business , “
363257	363287	363288	363292	The party to be apprehended	8066	” Sir Leicester seems to wake , though his eyes have been wide open , and he looks intently at Mr. Bucket as Mr. Bucket refers to his watch . “
363299	363317	363319	363319	I	0	” proceeds Mr. Bucket , putting up his watch with a steady hand and with rising spirits , “
363430	363522	363417	363417	You	8069	” Mr. Bucket rings , goes to the door , briefly whispers Mercury , shuts the door , and stands behind it with his arms folded . After a suspense of a minute or two the door slowly opens and a Frenchwoman enters . Mademoiselle Hortense . The moment she is in the room Mr. Bucket claps the door to and puts his back against it . The suddenness of the noise occasions her to turn , and then for the first time she sees Sir Leicester Dedlock in his chair . “
363528	363533	363523	363523	I	0	” she mutters hurriedly . “
363543	363571	363534	363534	They	8072	” Her step towards the door brings her front to front with Mr. Bucket . Suddenly a spasm shoots across her face and she turns deadly pale . “
363581	363590	363577	363579	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” says Mr. Bucket , nodding at her . “
363604	363605	363591	363594	This foreign young woman	8076	” “
363620	363628	363614	363614	you	266	” returns mademoiselle in a jocular strain . “
363634	363639	363631	363632	my angel	8078	” returns Mr. Bucket , “
363644	363666	363631	363632	my angel	8078	” Mademoiselle Hortense eyes him with a scowl upon her tight face , which gradually changes into a smile of scorn , “
363676	363677	363673	363673	you	266	” “
363684	363689	363673	363673	you	266	” returns Mr. Bucket . “
363746	363777	363780	363781	my God	4954	” mademoiselle demands , with her arms composedly crossed , but with something in her dark cheek beating like a clock . Mr. Bucket merely shakes the finger at her . “
363789	363802	363780	363781	my God	4954	” cries mademoiselle with a toss of her head and a laugh . “
363812	363823	363780	363781	my God	4954	” With a stamp of her foot and a menace . “
363828	363838	363839	363839	you	4001	” says Mr. Bucket in a cool determined way , “
363848	363849	363839	363839	you	4001	” “
363858	363867	363850	363850	I	0	” she replies with a shower of nods . “
363872	363885	363886	363886	you	4001	” repeats Mr. Bucket , making no demonstration except with the finger , “
363893	363894	363886	363886	you	4001	” “
363897	363898	363886	363886	you	4001	” “
363996	364016	363967	363967	I	0	” Mademoiselle complies , saying in a concentrated voice while that something in her cheek beats fast and hard , “
364022	364023	364019	364020	a devil	8101	” “
364029	364035	364036	364036	you	4001	” Mr. Bucket proceeds approvingly , “
364114	364169	364172	364172	you	0	” Mr. Bucket is very complacent over this French explanation . Mademoiselle , with that tigerish expansion of the mouth and her black eyes darting fire upon him , sits upright on the sofa in a rigid state , with her hands clenched — and her feet too , one might suppose — muttering , “
364180	364181	364172	364172	you	0	” “
364190	364205	364188	364188	Baronet	266	” says Mr. Bucket , and from this time forth the finger never rests , “
364245	364246	364228	364230	this young woman	4792	” “
364249	364253	364256	364256	myself	0	” cries mademoiselle . “
364258	364259	364256	364256	myself	0	” “
364270	364285	364265	364265	you	0	” returns Mr. Bucket in an impressive , almost in an imploring , tone . “
364337	364338	364350	364350	her	4792	” “
364343	364348	364350	364350	her	4792	” cries mademoiselle furiously , “
364382	364383	364377	364378	a ladyship	8111	” “
364392	364397	364377	364378	a ladyship	8111	” Mr. Bucket remonstrates . “
364428	364429	364426	364426	Baronet	2240	” “
364436	364440	364441	364441	I	0	” cries mademoiselle . “
364455	364465	364441	364441	I	0	” all of which she makes the carpet represent . “
364487	364488	364491	364493	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” “
364495	364500	364512	364512	she	8117	” proceeds Mr. Bucket , “
364547	364548	364537	364537	she	8117	” “
364551	364555	364556	364556	I	0	” cries mademoiselle . “
364565	364566	364556	364556	I	0	” “
364575	364581	364582	364582	you	266	” says Mr. Bucket parenthetically , “
364664	364665	364632	364632	she	8117	” “
364668	364672	364632	364632	she	8117	” cries mademoiselle . “
364676	364677	364632	364632	she	8117	” “
364867	364921	364922	364922	I	0	” As Mr. Bucket bends forward in some excitement — for him — and inaugurates what he is going to say with one ghostly beat of his forefinger in the air , Mademoiselle Hortense fixes her black eyes upon him with a dark frown and sets her dry lips closely and firmly together . “
365038	365053	365033	365033	she	4792	” Mademoiselle is hardly audible in straining through her teeth and lips the words , “
365059	365060	365033	365033	she	4792	” “
365064	365069	365071	365071	she	4792	” pursues Mr. Bucket , “
365236	365259	365226	365226	I	0	” Mr. Bucket , breaking off , has made a noiseless descent upon mademoiselle and laid his heavy hand upon her shoulder . “
365268	365273	365226	365226	I	0	” she asks him . “
365281	365289	365226	365226	I	0	” returns Mr. Bucket with admonitory finger , “
365355	365375	365352	365352	my	0	” Vainly endeavouring to moisten those dry lips , with a painful sound she struggles with herself and complies . “
365613	365614	365605	365605	she	4792	” “
365617	365621	365605	365605	she	4792	” mademoiselle interposes . “
365628	365629	365605	365605	she	4792	” “
365695	365707	365709	365709	she	4792	” Sir Leicester rises from his chair and staggers down again . “
365898	365977	365896	365896	Baronet	2240	” Mr. Bucket asks , triumphant in his admiration of his lady ’s genius . Two things are especially observable as Mr. Bucket proceeds to a conclusion . First , that he seems imperceptibly to establish a dreadful right of property in mademoiselle . Secondly , that the very atmosphere she breathes seems to narrow and contract about her as if a close net or a pall were being drawn nearer and yet nearer around her breathless figure . “
365994	365999	365983	365984	her ladyship	921	” says Mr. Bucket , “
366151	366152	366131	366132	Mrs. Bucket	653	” “
366159	366163	366164	366164	You	0	” mademoiselle interposes . “
366184	366185	366180	366180	you	0	” “
366192	366217	366180	366180	you	0	” proceeds Mr. Bucket , who delights in a full title and does violence to himself when he dispenses with any fragment of it , “
366615	366628	366609	366609	I	0	” In a trice Mr. Bucket snaps a handcuff on her wrist . “
366633	366638	366609	366609	I	0	” says Mr. Bucket . “
366651	366659	366609	366609	I	0	” He rises ; she rises too . “
366662	366684	366609	366609	I	0	” she asks him , darkening her large eyes until their drooping lids almost conceal them — and yet they stare , “
366697	366698	366699	366699	She	8201	” “
366708	366713	366699	366699	She	8201	” returns Mr. Bucket . “
366723	366724	366717	366717	her	8201	” “
366732	366742	366725	366725	I	0	” exclaims Mademoiselle Hortense , panting tigress - like . “
366751	366756	366757	366757	I	0	” says Mr. Bucket . “
366760	366767	366757	366757	I	0	” making her eyes very large . “
366778	366779	366768	366768	I	0	” “
366785	366794	366783	366783	darling	8199	” says Mr. Bucket with the greatest composure , “
366830	366831	366828	366828	you	8199	” “
366841	366842	366843	366843	Angel	361	” “
366851	366856	366843	366843	Angel	361	” cries Mr. Bucket . “
366903	366933	366937	366938	my angel	8078	” Mademoiselle Hortense , casting an indignant eye at the glass , shakes herself perfectly neat in one shake and looks , to do her justice , uncommonly genteel . “
366940	366948	366937	366938	my angel	8078	” says she after several sarcastic nods . “
366963	366968	366956	366956	you	8199	” Mr. Bucket answers , “
366972	366973	366956	366956	you	8199	” “
366997	366998	366989	366989	you	8199	” “
367005	367010	366989	366989	you	8199	” says Mr. Bucket . “
367018	367030	367012	367016	a haughty gentleman of HIM	8212	” cries mademoiselle , referring to Sir Leicester with ineffable disdain . “
367049	367050	367043	367043	Ha	468	” “
367064	367069	367043	367043	Ha	468	” says Mr. Bucket . “
367073	367074	367075	367075	You	8199	” “
367128	367900	367124	367124	I	0	” With these last words she snaps her teeth together as if her mouth closed with a spring . It is impossible to describe how Mr. Bucket gets her out , but he accomplishes that feat in a manner so peculiar to himself , enfolding and pervading her like a cloud , and hovering away with her as if he were a homely Jupiter and she the object of his affections . Sir Leicester , left alone , remains in the same attitude , as though he were still listening and his attention were still occupied . At length he gazes round the empty room , and finding it deserted , rises unsteadily to his feet , pushes back his chair , and walks a few steps , supporting himself by the table . Then he stops , and with more of those inarticulate sounds , lifts up his eyes and seems to stare at something . Heaven knows what he sees . The green , green woods of Chesney Wold , the noble house , the pictures of his forefathers , strangers defacing them , officers of police coarsely handling his most precious heirlooms , thousands of fingers pointing at him , thousands of faces sneering at him . But if such shadows flit before him to his bewilderment , there is one other shadow which he can name with something like distinctness even yet and to which alone he addresses his tearing of his white hair and his extended arms . It is she in association with whom , saving that she has been for years a main fibre of the root of his dignity and pride , he has never had a selfish thought . It is she whom he has loved , admired , honoured , and set up for the world to respect . It is she who , at the core of all the constrained formalities and conventionalities of his life , has been a stock of living tenderness and love , susceptible as nothing else is of being struck with the agony he feels . He sees her , almost to the exclusion of himself , and can not bear to look upon her cast down from the high place she has graced so well . And even to the point of his sinking on the ground , oblivious of his suffering , he can yet pronounce her name with something like distinctness in the midst of those intrusive sounds , and in a tone of mourning and compassion rather than reproach . CHAPTER LV Flight Inspector Bucket of the Detective has not yet struck his great blow , as just now chronicled , but is yet refreshing himself with sleep preparatory to his field - day , when through the night and along the freezing wintry roads a chaise and pair comes out of Lincolnshire , making its way towards London . Railroads shall soon traverse all this country , and with a rattle and a glare the engine and train shall shoot like a meteor over the wide night - landscape , turning the moon paler ; but as yet such things are non - existent in these parts , though not wholly unexpected . Preparations are afoot , measurements are made , ground is staked out . Bridges are begun , and their not yet united piers desolately look at one another over roads and streams like brick and mortar couples with an obstacle to their union ; fragments of embankments are thrown up and left as precipices with torrents of rusty carts and barrows tumbling over them ; tripods of tall poles appear on hilltops , where there are rumours of tunnels ; everything looks chaotic and abandoned in full hopelessness . Along the freezing roads , and through the night , the post - chaise makes its way without a railroad on its mind . Mrs. Rouncewell , so many years housekeeper at Chesney Wold , sits within the chaise ; and by her side sits Mrs. Bagnet with her grey cloak and umbrella . The old girl would prefer the bar in front , as being exposed to the weather and a primitive sort of perch more in accordance with her usual course of travelling , but Mrs. Rouncewell is too thoughtful of her comfort to admit of her proposing it . The old lady can not make enough of the old girl . She sits , in her stately manner , holding her hand , and regardless of its roughness , puts it often to her lips . “
367910	367916	367918	367918	you	8217	” says she many times , “
367926	367927	367918	367918	you	8217	” “
367932	367937	367930	367930	George	500	” returns Mrs. Bagnet , “
368044	368045	368027	368027	him	500	” “
368051	368060	368027	368027	him	500	” returns Mrs. Rouncewell , bursting into tears . “
368167	368346	368348	368348	I	0	” The old lady ’s hands stray about her as of yore , while she recalls , all in a tremble , what a likely lad , what a fine lad , what a gay good - humoured clever lad he was ; how they all took to him down at Chesney Wold ; how Sir Leicester took to him when he was a young gentleman ; how the dogs took to him ; how even the people who had been angry with him forgave him the moment he was gone , poor boy . And now to see him after all , and in a prison too ! And the broad stomacher heaves , and the quaint upright old - fashioned figure bends under its load of affectionate distress . Mrs. Bagnet , with the instinctive skill of a good warm heart , leaves the old housekeeper to her emotions for a little while — not without passing the back of her hand across her own motherly eyes — and presently chirps up in her cheery manner , “
368723	368773	368701	368703	my old Lignum	8249	” All this Mrs. Bagnet now relates for the twentieth time at least within the last four hours . Trilling it out like a kind of bird , with a pretty high note , that it may be audible to the old lady above the hum of the wheels . “
368781	368786	368701	368703	my old Lignum	8249	” says Mrs. Rouncewell . “
368798	368799	368792	368792	you	500	” “
368803	368813	368792	368792	you	500	” cries Mrs. Bagnet in the most natural manner . “
368914	368943	368944	368944	He	500	” exclaims the old girl , apparently persuaded that the latter form a separate establishment and have dissolved partnership with truth and justice for ever and a day . “
368948	368953	368912	368912	lawyers	1498	” says Mrs. Rouncewell , “
369034	369098	369099	369099	My	0	” The extreme disquietude of the old housekeeper ’s manner in saying this , her broken words , and her wringing of her hands make a powerful impression on Mrs. Bagnet and would astonish her but that she refers them all to her sorrow for her son ’s condition . And yet Mrs. Bagnet wonders too why Mrs. Rouncewell should murmur so distractedly , “
369108	369565	369099	369099	My	0	” over and over again . The frosty night wears away , and the dawn breaks , and the post - chaise comes rolling on through the early mist like the ghost of a chaise departed . It has plenty of spectral company in ghosts of trees and hedges , slowly vanishing and giving place to the realities of day . London reached , the travellers alight , the old housekeeper in great tribulation and confusion , Mrs. Bagnet quite fresh and collected — as she would be if her next point , with no new equipage and outfit , were the Cape of Good Hope , the Island of Ascension , Hong Kong , or any other military station . But when they set out for the prison where the trooper is confined , the old lady has managed to draw about her , with her lavender - coloured dress , much of the staid calmness which is its usual accompaniment . A wonderfully grave , precise , and handsome piece of old china she looks , though her heart beats fast and her stomacher is ruffled more than even the remembrance of this wayward son has ruffled it these many years . Approaching the cell , they find the door opening and a warder in the act of coming out . The old girl promptly makes a sign of entreaty to him to say nothing ; assenting with a nod , he suffers them to enter as he shuts the door . So George , who is writing at his table , supposing himself to be alone , does not raise his eyes , but remains absorbed . The old housekeeper looks at him , and those wandering hands of hers are quite enough for Mrs. Bagnet ’s confirmation , even if she could see the mother and the son together , knowing what she knows , and doubt their relationship . Not a rustle of the housekeeper ’s dress , not a gesture , not a word betrays her . She stands looking at him as he writes on , all unconscious , and only her fluttering hands give utterance to her emotions . But they are very eloquent , very , very eloquent . Mrs. Bagnet understands them . They speak of gratitude , of joy , of grief , of hope ; of inextinguishable affection , cherished with no return since this stalwart man was a stripling ; of a better son loved less , and this son loved so fondly and so proudly ; and they speak in such touching language that Mrs. Bagnet ’s eyes brim up with tears and they run glistening down her sun - brown face . “
369581	369650	369651	369651	My	0	” The trooper starts up , clasps his mother round the neck , and falls down on his knees before her . Whether in a late repentance , whether in the first association that comes back upon him , he puts his hands together as a child does when it says its prayers , and raising them towards her breast , bows down his head , and cries . “
369708	369772	369773	369773	Mother	9526	” She can ask , and he can answer , nothing connected for a time . All that time the old girl , turned away , leans one arm against the whitened wall , leans her honest forehead upon it , wipes her eyes with her serviceable grey cloak , and quite enjoys herself like the best of old girls as she is . “
369775	369785	369773	369773	Mother	9526	” says the trooper when they are more composed , “
369800	369903	369904	369904	Mother	342	” Forgive him ! She does it with all her heart and soul . She always has done it . She tells him how she has had it written in her will , these many years , that he was her beloved son George . She has never believed any ill of him , never . If she had died without this happiness — and she is an old woman now and ca n’t look to live very long — she would have blessed him with her last breath , if she had had her senses , as her beloved son George . “
369994	370041	370043	370043	I	0	” The trooper has dried his eyes and put away his handkerchief , but there is an extraordinary contrast between his habitual manner of expressing himself and carrying himself and the softened tone in which he speaks , interrupted occasionally by a half - stifled sob . “
370165	370166	370167	370167	I	0	” “
370199	370224	370225	370225	Heaven	593	” This almost overturns the trooper afresh , but he sets himself up with a great , rough , sounding clearance of his throat . “
370412	370436	370439	370439	I	0	” The old lady sorrowfully shakes her head , and taking one of his powerful hands , lays it lovingly upon her shoulder . “
370687	370717	370718	370718	I	0	” Mrs. Rouncewell , drawing up her stately form , shakes her head at the old girl with a swelling pride upon her , as much as to say , “
370723	370791	370720	370720	you	332	” The old girl relieves her feelings and testifies her interest in the conversation by giving the trooper a great poke between the shoulders with her umbrella ; this action she afterwards repeats , at intervals , in a species of affectionate lunacy , never failing , after the administration of each of these remonstrances , to resort to the whitened wall and the grey cloak again . “
370894	371032	371033	371033	Mother	342	” To which Mrs. Bagnet responds with two pokes . And now the old lady impresses upon her son George , her own dear recovered boy , her joy and pride , the light of her eyes , the happy close of her life , and every fond name she can think of , that he must be governed by the best advice obtainable by money and influence , that he must yield up his case to the greatest lawyers that can be got , that he must act in this serious plight as he shall be advised to act and must not be self - willed , however right , but must promise to think only of his poor old mother ’s anxiety and suffering until he is released , or he will break her heart . “
371043	371054	371033	371033	Mother	342	” returns the trooper , stopping her with a kiss ; “
371087	371099	371073	371074	Mrs. Bagnet	543	” A very hard poke from the old girl ’s umbrella . “
371134	371135	371124	371124	they	8306	” “
371140	371146	371138	371138	George	332	” says the old lady , “
371196	371197	371198	371198	Mother	9526	” “
371200	371205	371198	371198	Mother	9526	” returns the trooper , “
371215	371216	371198	371198	Mother	9526	” “
371223	371224	371198	371198	Mother	9526	” “
371240	371241	371236	371237	my brother	3076	” “
371249	371250	371259	371259	mother	9526	” “
371369	371370	371375	371376	dear George	332	” “
371378	371379	371375	371376	dear George	332	” “
371431	371442	371427	371427	I	0	” says the trooper , shaking his head very doubtfully , “
371466	371510	371427	371427	I	0	” As he evidently has a rooted feeling on this point , and as the depth of it is recognized in Mrs. Bagnet ’s face , his mother yields her implicit assent to what he asks . For this he thanks her kindly . “
371557	371567	371551	371551	I	0	” he glances at his writing on the table , “
371681	371731	371734	371734	you	8327	” Matters being brought to this so far satisfactory pass , and time being on the wane , Mrs. Bagnet proposes a departure . Again and again the old lady hangs upon her son ’s neck , and again and again the trooper holds her to his broad chest . “
371744	371745	371734	371734	you	8327	” “
371773	371778	371761	371761	I	0	” Mrs. Rouncewell answers . “
371807	371818	371820	371820	her	2299	” Why indeed , Mrs. Bagnet expresses with the umbrella . “
371873	372042	371860	371860	I	0	” So saying , the trooper puts his lips to the old girl ’s tanned forehead , and the door shuts upon him in his cell . No entreaties on the part of the good old housekeeper will induce Mrs. Bagnet to retain the coach for her own conveyance home . Jumping out cheerfully at the door of the Dedlock mansion and handing Mrs. Rouncewell up the steps , the old girl shakes hands and trudges off , arriving soon afterwards in the bosom of the Bagnet family and falling to washing the greens as if nothing had happened . My Lady is in that room in which she held her last conference with the murdered man , and is sitting where she sat that night , and is looking at the spot where he stood upon the hearth studying her so leisurely , when a tap comes at the door . Who is it ? Mrs. Rouncewell . What has brought Mrs. Rouncewell to town so unexpectedly ? “
372064	372108	372057	372057	I	0	” What new occurrence is it that makes this tranquil old woman tremble so ? Far happier than her Lady , as her Lady has often thought , why does she falter in this manner and look at her with such strange mistrust ? “
372121	372122	372057	372057	I	0	” “
372156	372157	372151	372151	he	2801	” “

372220	372248	372217	372218	Mr. Tulkinghorn	269	” What does she mean by this look and this imploring gesture ? Why does she come so close ? What is the letter that she holds ? “
372308	372309	372310	372310	I	0	” “
372316	372317	372310	372310	I	0	” “
372359	372402	372403	372404	My Lady	958	” What delusion can this be ? What power does she suppose is in the person she petitions to avert this unjust suspicion , if it be unjust ? Her Lady ’s handsome eyes regard her with astonishment , almost with fear . “
372489	372490	372484	372484	I	0	” “
372496	372497	372484	372484	I	0	” “
372502	372514	372515	372516	My Lady	958	” The housekeeper looks round and answers in a frightened whisper , “
372765	372774	372758	372759	My Lady	958	” the old housekeeper pleads with genuine simplicity , “
372843	372861	372879	372879	you	958	” Lady Dedlock raises her without one word , until she takes the letter from her hand . “
372868	372869	372863	372863	I	0	” “
372892	372893	372894	372894	I	0	” “
372920	372921	372914	372914	I	0	” “
372940	373105	372925	372925	you	958	” The old housekeeper leaves her with the letter in her hand . In truth she is not a hard lady naturally , and the time has been when the sight of the venerable figure suing to her with such strong earnestness would have moved her to great compassion . But so long accustomed to suppress emotion and keep down reality , so long schooled for her own purposes in that destructive school which shuts up the natural feelings of the heart like flies in amber and spreads one uniform and dreary gloss over the good and bad , the feeling and the unfeeling , the sensible and the senseless , she had subdued even her wonder until now . She opens the letter . Spread out upon the paper is a printed account of the discovery of the body as it lay face downward on the floor , shot through the heart ; and underneath is written her own name , with the word “
373107	373175	373177	373177	him	8380	” attached . It falls out of her hand . How long it may have lain upon the ground she knows not , but it lies where it fell when a servant stands before her announcing the young man of the name of Guppy . The words have probably been repeated several times , for they are ringing in her head before she begins to understand them . “
373181	373231	373177	373177	him	8380	” He comes in . Holding the letter in her hand , which she has taken from the floor , she tries to collect her thoughts . In the eyes of Mr. Guppy she is the same Lady Dedlock , holding the same prepared , proud , chilling state . “
373253	373282	373291	373292	your ladyship	2537	ladyship”—which he do n’t complain of , for he is bound to confess that there never has been any particular reason on the face of things why he should be—“but
373301	373306	373293	373293	you	2537	” says Mr. Guppy . “
373310	373311	373313	373314	your ladyship	2537	” “
373325	373346	373322	373323	your ladyship	2537	” Mr. Guppy sits on the edge of a chair and puts his hat on the carpet at his feet , “
373460	373474	373494	373495	your ladyship	2537	” And yet he is here now , Lady Dedlock moodily reminds him . “
373482	373487	373477	373477	I	0	” Mr. Guppy admits . “
373508	373525	373528	373528	I	0	” He can not do so , she tells him , too plainly or too briefly . “
373530	373542	373528	373528	I	0	” Mr. Guppy returns with a sense of injury upon him , “
373619	373636	373637	373637	Your	2537	” Mr. Guppy considers this a favourable moment for sticking up his hair with both hands . “
373752	373776	373746	373749	a man of business	3340	” Lady Dedlock looks at him in stern inquiry . Mr. Guppy immediately withdraws his eyes from her face and looks anywhere else . “
373786	373791	373746	373749	a man of business	3340	” he goes on , “
374022	374023	374031	374031	your	8402	” “
374026	374027	374031	374031	your	8402	” “
374078	374079	374082	374082	I	0	” “
374104	374105	374101	374101	you	0	” “
374227	374237	374238	374238	Your	8402	” Mr. Guppy picks up his hat and rises . “
374368	374394	374341	374341	I	0	” She scarcely acknowledges these parting words by any look , but when he has been gone a little while , she rings her bell . “
374400	374415	374397	374398	Sir Leicester	266	” Mercury reports that he is at present shut up in the library alone . “
374425	374783	374420	374421	any visitors	8433	” Several , on business . Mercury proceeds to a description of them , which has been anticipated by Mr. Guppy . Enough ; he may go . So ! All is broken down . Her name is in these many mouths , her husband knows his wrongs , her shame will be published — may be spreading while she thinks about it — and in addition to the thunderbolt so long foreseen by her , so unforeseen by him , she is denounced by an invisible accuser as the murderess of her enemy . Her enemy he was , and she has often , often , often wished him dead . Her enemy he is , even in his grave . This dreadful accusation comes upon her like a new torment at his lifeless hand . And when she recalls how she was secretly at his door that night , and how she may be represented to have sent her favourite girl away so soon before merely to release herself from observation , she shudders as if the hangman ’s hands were at her neck . She has thrown herself upon the floor and lies with her hair all wildly scattered and her face buried in the cushions of a couch . She rises up , hurries to and fro , flings herself down again , and rocks and moans . The horror that is upon her is unutterable . If she really were the murderess , it could hardly be , for the moment , more intense . For as her murderous perspective , before the doing of the deed , however subtle the precautions for its commission , would have been closed up by a gigantic dilatation of the hateful figure , preventing her from seeing any consequences beyond it ; and as those consequences would have rushed in , in an unimagined flood , the moment the figure was laid low — which always happens when a murder is done ; so , now she sees that when he used to be on the watch before her , and she used to think , “
374802	376034	376035	376036	Chesney Wold	329	” it was but wishing that all he held against her in his hand might be flung to the winds and chance - sown in many places . So , too , with the wicked relief she has felt in his death . What was his death but the key - stone of a gloomy arch removed , and now the arch begins to fall in a thousand fragments , each crushing and mangling piecemeal ! Thus , a terrible impression steals upon and overshadows her that from this pursuer , living or dead — obdurate and imperturbable before her in his well - remembered shape , or not more obdurate and imperturbable in his coffin - bed — there is no escape but in death . Hunted , she flies . The complication of her shame , her dread , remorse , and misery , overwhelms her at its height ; and even her strength of self - reliance is overturned and whirled away like a leaf before a mighty wind . She hurriedly addresses these lines to her husband , seals , and leaves them on her table : If I am sought for , or accused of , his murder , believe that I am wholly innocent . Believe no other good of me , for I am innocent of nothing else that you have heard , or will hear , laid to my charge . He prepared me , on that fatal night , for his disclosure of my guilt to you . After he had left me , I went out on pretence of walking in the garden where I sometimes walk , but really to follow him and make one last petition that he would not protract the dreadful suspense on which I have been racked by him , you do not know how long , but would mercifully strike next morning . I found his house dark and silent . I rang twice at his door , but there was no reply , and I came home . I have no home left . I will encumber you no more . May you , in your just resentment , be able to forget the unworthy woman on whom you have wasted a most generous devotion — who avoids you only with a deeper shame than that with which she hurries from herself — and who writes this last adieu . She veils and dresses quickly , leaves all her jewels and her money , listens , goes downstairs at a moment when the hall is empty , opens and shuts the great door , flutters away in the shrill frosty wind . CHAPTER LVI Pursuit Impassive , as behoves its high breeding , the Dedlock town house stares at the other houses in the street of dismal grandeur and gives no outward sign of anything going wrong within . Carriages rattle , doors are battered at , the world exchanges calls ; ancient charmers with skeleton throats , and peachy cheeks that have a rather ghastly bloom upon them seen by daylight , when indeed these fascinating creatures look like Death and the Lady fused together , dazzle the eyes of men . Forth from the frigid mews come easily swinging carriages guided by short - legged coachmen in flaxen wigs , deep sunk into downy hammercloths , and up behind mount luscious Mercuries bearing sticks of state and wearing cocked hats broadwise , a spectacle for the angels . The Dedlock town house changes not externally , and hours pass before its exalted dullness is disturbed within . But Volumnia the fair , being subject to the prevalent complaint of boredom and finding that disorder attacking her spirits with some virulence , ventures at length to repair to the library for change of scene . Her gentle tapping at the door producing no response , she opens it and peeps in ; seeing no one there , takes possession . The sprightly Dedlock is reputed , in that grass - grown city of the ancients , Bath , to be stimulated by an urgent curiosity which impels her on all convenient and inconvenient occasions to sidle about with a golden glass at her eye , peering into objects of every description . Certain it is that she avails herself of the present opportunity of hovering over her kinsman ’s letters and papers like a bird , taking a short peck at this document and a blink with her head on one side at that document , and hopping about from table to table with her glass at her eye in an inquisitive and restless manner . In the course of these researches she stumbles over something , and turning her glass in that direction , sees her kinsman lying on the ground like a felled tree . Volumnia ’s pet little scream acquires a considerable augmentation of reality from this surprise , and the house is quickly in commotion . Servants tear up and down stairs , bells are violently rung , doctors are sent for , and Lady Dedlock is sought in all directions , but not found . Nobody has seen or heard her since she last rang her bell . Her letter to Sir Leicester is discovered on her table , but it is doubtful yet whether he has not received another missive from another world requiring to be personally answered , and all the living languages , and all the dead , are as one to him . They lay him down upon his bed , and chafe , and rub , and fan , and put ice to his head , and try every means of restoration . Howbeit , the day has ebbed away , and it is night in his room before his stertorous breathing lulls or his fixed eyes show any consciousness of the candle that is occasionally passed before them . But when this change begins , it goes on ; and by and by he nods or moves his eyes or even his hand in token that he hears and comprehends . He fell down , this morning , a handsome stately gentleman , somewhat infirm , but of a fine presence , and with a well - filled face . He lies upon his bed , an aged man with sunken cheeks , the decrepit shadow of himself . His voice was rich and mellow and he had so long been thoroughly persuaded of the weight and import to mankind of any word he said that his words really had come to sound as if there were something in them . But now he can only whisper , and what he whispers sounds like what it is — mere jumble and jargon . His favourite and faithful housekeeper stands at his bedside . It is the first act he notices , and he clearly derives pleasure from it . After vainly trying to make himself understood in speech , he makes signs for a pencil . So inexpressively that they can not at first understand him ; it is his old housekeeper who makes out what he wants and brings in a slate . After pausing for some time , he slowly scrawls upon it in a hand that is not his , “
376038	376079	376035	376036	Chesney Wold	329	” No , she tells him ; he is in London . He was taken ill in the library this morning . Right thankful she is that she happened to come to London and is able to attend upon him . “
376111	376148	376105	376107	All the gentlemen	8435	” This , with the tears coursing down her fair old face . After making a survey of the room and looking with particular attention all round the bed where the doctors stand , he writes , “
376152	376153	376105	376107	All the gentlemen	8435	” “
376177	376227	376228	376229	My Lady	958	” He points again , in great agitation , at the two words . They all try to quiet him , but he points again with increased agitation . On their looking at one another , not knowing what to say , he takes the slate once more and writes “
376238	376555	376228	376229	My Lady	958	” And makes an imploring moan . It is thought better that his old housekeeper should give him Lady Dedlock ’s letter , the contents of which no one knows or can surmise . She opens it for him and puts it out for his perusal . Having read it twice by a great effort , he turns it down so that it shall not be seen and lies moaning . He passes into a kind of relapse or into a swoon , and it is an hour before he opens his eyes , reclining on his faithful and attached old servant ’s arm . The doctors know that he is best with her , and when not actively engaged about him , stand aloof . The slate comes into requisition again , but the word he wants to write he can not remember . His anxiety , his eagerness , and affliction at this pass are pitiable to behold . It seems as if he must go mad in the necessity he feels for haste and the inability under which he labours of expressing to do what or to fetch whom . He has written the letter B , and there stopped . Of a sudden , in the height of his misery , he puts Mr. before it . The old housekeeper suggests Bucket . Thank heaven ! That ’s his meaning . Mr. Bucket is found to be downstairs , by appointment . Shall he come up ? There is no possibility of misconstruing Sir Leicester ’s burning wish to see him or the desire he signifies to have the room cleared of every one but the housekeeper . It is speedily done , and Mr. Bucket appears . Of all men upon earth , Sir Leicester seems fallen from his high estate to place his sole trust and reliance upon this man . “
376591	376645	376578	376578	I	0	” Sir Leicester puts her letter in his hands and looks intently in his face while he reads it . A new intelligence comes into Mr. Bucket ’s eye as he reads on ; with one hook of his finger , while that eye is still glancing over the words , he indicates , “
376656	376664	376654	376654	you	266	” Sir Leicester writes upon the slate . “
376670	376677	376678	376680	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” Mr. Bucket stops his hand . “
376708	376730	376735	376737	Sir Leicester Dedlock	266	” With the quickness of thought , he follows Sir Leicester Dedlock ’s look towards a little box upon a table . “
376829	376877	376825	376825	I	0	” The velocity and certainty of Mr. Bucket ’s interpretation on all these heads is little short of miraculous . Mrs. Rouncewell , who holds the light , is giddy with the swiftness of his eyes and hands as he starts up , furnished for his journey . “
376897	376913	376891	376891	you	8444	” says Mr. Bucket aside , with his hat already on and buttoning his coat . “
376924	376925	376920	376922	his distressed mother	8448	” “
377247	377371	377226	377226	Lord	8461	” With this peroration , Mr. Bucket , buttoned up , goes quietly out , looking steadily before him as if he were already piercing the night in quest of the fugitive . His first step is to take himself to Lady Dedlock ’s rooms and look all over them for any trifling indication that may help him . The rooms are in darkness now ; and to see Mr. Bucket with a wax - light in his hand , holding it above his head and taking a sharp mental inventory of the many delicate objects so curiously at variance with himself , would be to see a sight — which nobody DOES see , as he is particular to lock himself in . “
377378	377400	377226	377226	Lord	8461	” says Mr. Bucket , who feels in a manner furbished up in his French by the blow of the morning . “
377427	377457	377418	377418	she	8462	” Opening and shutting table - drawers and looking into caskets and jewel - cases , he sees the reflection of himself in various mirrors , and moralizes thereon . “
377478	377483	377484	377484	I	0	” says Mr. Bucket . “
377500	377546	377547	377547	Hum	537	” Ever looking about , he has opened a dainty little chest in an inner drawer . His great hand , turning over some gloves which it can scarcely feel , they are so light and soft within it , comes upon a white handkerchief . “
377557	377567	377555	377555	YOU	8464	” says Mr. Bucket , putting down the light . “
377608	377616	377617	377618	Esther Summerson	280	” He finds it as he speaks , “
377620	377621	377617	377618	Esther Summerson	280	” “
377624	377638	377617	377618	Esther Summerson	280	” says Mr. Bucket , pausing , with his finger at his ear . “
377646	377907	377641	377641	I	0	” He completes his observations as quietly and carefully as he has carried them on , leaves everything else precisely as he found it , glides away after some five minutes in all , and passes into the street . With a glance upward at the dimly lighted windows of Sir Leicester ’s room , he sets off , full - swing , to the nearest coach - stand , picks out the horse for his money , and directs to be driven to the shooting gallery . Mr. Bucket does not claim to be a scientific judge of horses , but he lays out a little money on the principal events in that line , and generally sums up his knowledge of the subject in the remark that when he sees a horse as can go , he knows him . His knowledge is not at fault in the present instance . Clattering over the stones at a dangerous pace , yet thoughtfully bringing his keen eyes to bear on every slinking creature whom he passes in the midnight streets , and even on the lights in upper windows where people are going or gone to bed , and on all the turnings that he rattles by , and alike on the heavy sky , and on the earth where the snow lies thin — for something may present itself to assist him , anywhere — he dashes to his destination at such a speed that when he stops the horse half smothers him in a cloud of steam . “
377924	377940	377941	377941	I	0	” He runs up the long wooden entry and finds the trooper smoking his pipe . “
378001	378019	378020	378020	You	332	” The trooper has just come from there and gives him the address , near Oxford Street . “
378031	378113	378020	378020	You	332	” He is off again , with an impression of having seen Phil sitting by the frosty fire staring at him open - mouthed , and gallops away again , and gets out in a cloud of steam again . Mr. Jarndyce , the only person up in the house , is just going to bed , rises from his book on hearing the rapid ringing at the bell , and comes down to the door in his dressing - gown . “
378121	378149	378020	378020	You	332	” In a moment his visitor is confidential with him in the hall , has shut the door , and stands with his hand upon the lock . “
378211	378212	378208	378209	Lady Dedlock	264	” “
378215	378216	378208	378209	Lady Dedlock	264	” “
378287	378301	378302	378302	I	0	” Mr. Jarndyce , having read it , asks him what he thinks . “
378397	378406	378394	378395	Miss Summerson	280	” Mr. Jarndyce in a troubled voice repeats , “
378410	378411	378407	378408	Miss Summerson	280	” “
378415	378427	378407	378408	Miss Summerson	280	Jarndyce”—Mr . Bucket has read his face with the greatest attention all along—“I
378721	380033	380035	380035	you	8483	” This is all true , and the pressing nature of the case can not be questioned . Mr. Jarndyce begs him to remain there while he speaks to Miss Summerson . Mr. Bucket says he will , but acting on his usual principle , does no such thing , following upstairs instead and keeping his man in sight . So he remains , dodging and lurking about in the gloom of the staircase while they confer . In a very little time Mr. Jarndyce comes down and tells him that Miss Summerson will join him directly and place herself under his protection to accompany him where he pleases . Mr. Bucket , satisfied , expresses high approval and awaits her coming at the door . There he mounts a high tower in his mind and looks out far and wide . Many solitary figures he perceives creeping through the streets ; many solitary figures out on heaths , and roads , and lying under haystacks . But the figure that he seeks is not among them . Other solitaries he perceives , in nooks of bridges , looking over ; and in shadowed places down by the river ’s level ; and a dark , dark , shapeless object drifting with the tide , more solitary than all , clings with a drowning hold on his attention . Where is she ? Living or dead , where is she ? If , as he folds the handkerchief and carefully puts it up , it were able with an enchanted power to bring before him the place where she found it and the night - landscape near the cottage where it covered the little child , would he descry her there ? On the waste where the brick - kilns are burning with a pale blue flare , where the straw - roofs of the wretched huts in which the bricks are made are being scattered by the wind , where the clay and water are hard frozen and the mill in which the gaunt blind horse goes round all day looks like an instrument of human torture — traversing this deserted , blighted spot there is a lonely figure with the sad world to itself , pelted by the snow and driven by the wind , and cast out , it would seem , from all companionship . It is the figure of a woman , too ; but it is miserably dressed , and no such clothes ever came through the hall and out at the great door of the Dedlock mansion . CHAPTER LVII Esther ’s Narrative I had gone to bed and fallen asleep when my guardian knocked at the door of my room and begged me to get up directly . On my hurrying to speak to him and learn what had happened , he told me , after a word or two of preparation , that there had been a discovery at Sir Leicester Dedlock ’s . That my mother had fled , that a person was now at our door who was empowered to convey to her the fullest assurances of affectionate protection and forgiveness if he could possibly find her , and that I was sought for to accompany him in the hope that my entreaties might prevail upon her if his failed . Something to this general purpose I made out , but I was thrown into such a tumult of alarm , and hurry and distress , that in spite of every effort I could make to subdue my agitation , I did not seem , to myself , fully to recover my right mind until hours had passed . But I dressed and wrapped up expeditiously without waking Charley or any one and went down to Mr. Bucket , who was the person entrusted with the secret . In taking me to him my guardian told me this , and also explained how it was that he had come to think of me . Mr. Bucket , in a low voice , by the light of my guardian ’s candle , read to me in the hall a letter that my mother had left upon her table ; and I suppose within ten minutes of my having been aroused I was sitting beside him , rolling swiftly through the streets . His manner was very keen , and yet considerate when he explained to me that a great deal might depend on my being able to answer , without confusion , a few questions that he wished to ask me . These were , chiefly , whether I had had much communication with my mother ( to whom he only referred as Lady Dedlock ) , when and where I had spoken with her last , and how she had become possessed of my handkerchief . When I had satisfied him on these points , he asked me particularly to consider — taking time to think — whether within my knowledge there was any one , no matter where , in whom she might be at all likely to confide under circumstances of the last necessity . I could think of no one but my guardian . But by and by I mentioned Mr. Boythorn . He came into my mind as connected with his old chivalrous manner of mentioning my mother ’s name and with what my guardian had informed me of his engagement to her sister and his unconscious connexion with her unhappy story . My companion had stopped the driver while we held this conversation , that we might the better hear each other . He now told him to go on again and said to me , after considering within himself for a few moments , that he had made up his mind how to proceed . He was quite willing to tell me what his plan was , but I did not feel clear enough to understand it . We had not driven very far from our lodgings when we stopped in a by - street at a public - looking place lighted up with gas . Mr. Bucket took me in and sat me in an arm - chair by a bright fire . It was now past one , as I saw by the clock against the wall . Two police officers , looking in their perfectly neat uniform not at all like people who were up all night , were quietly writing at a desk ; and the place seemed very quiet altogether , except for some beating and calling out at distant doors underground , to which nobody paid any attention . A third man in uniform , whom Mr. Bucket called and to whom he whispered his instructions , went out ; and then the two others advised together while one wrote from Mr. Bucket ’s subdued dictation . It was a description of my mother that they were busy with , for Mr. Bucket brought it to me when it was done and read it in a whisper . It was very accurate indeed . The second officer , who had attended to it closely , then copied it out and called in another man in uniform ( there were several in an outer room ) , who took it up and went away with it . All this was done with the greatest dispatch and without the waste of a moment ; yet nobody was at all hurried . As soon as the paper was sent out upon its travels , the two officers resumed their former quiet work of writing with neatness and care . Mr. Bucket thoughtfully came and warmed the soles of his boots , first one and then the other , at the fire . “
380043	380053	380040	380041	Miss Summerson	280	” he asked me as his eyes met mine . “
380069	380083	380040	380041	Miss Summerson	280	” I told him I cared for no weather and was warmly clothed . “
380091	380095	380040	380041	Miss Summerson	280	” he observed ; “
380108	380109	380106	380106	miss	9584	” “
380119	380126	380106	380106	miss	9584	” said I. He nodded comfortingly . “
380184	380240	380182	380182	Baronet	2240	” He was really very kind and gentle , and as he stood before the fire warming his boots and rubbing his face with his forefinger , I felt a confidence in his sagacity which reassured me . It was not yet a quarter to two when I heard horses ’ feet and wheels outside . “
380246	380250	380243	380244	Miss Summerson	280	” said he , “
380259	380507	380256	380256	you	280	” He gave me his arm , and the two officers courteously bowed me out , and we found at the door a phaeton or barouche with a postilion and post horses . Mr. Bucket handed me in and took his own seat on the box . The man in uniform whom he had sent to fetch this equipage then handed him up a dark lantern at his request , and when he had given a few directions to the driver , we rattled away . I was far from sure that I was not in a dream . We rattled with great rapidity through such a labyrinth of streets that I soon lost all idea where we were , except that we had crossed and re - crossed the river , and still seemed to be traversing a low - lying , waterside , dense neighbourhood of narrow thoroughfares chequered by docks and basins , high piles of warehouses , swing - bridges , and masts of ships . At length we stopped at the corner of a little slimy turning , which the wind from the river , rushing up it , did not purify ; and I saw my companion , by the light of his lantern , in conference with several men who looked like a mixture of police and sailors . Against the mouldering wall by which they stood , there was a bill , on which I could discern the words , “
380510	380838	380845	380846	Miss Summerson	280	” ; and this and an inscription about drags possessed me with the awful suspicion shadowed forth in our visit to that place . I had no need to remind myself that I was not there by the indulgence of any feeling of mine to increase the difficulties of the search , or to lessen its hopes , or enhance its delays . I remained quiet , but what I suffered in that dreadful spot I never can forget . And still it was like the horror of a dream . A man yet dark and muddy , in long swollen sodden boots and a hat like them , was called out of a boat and whispered with Mr. Bucket , who went away with him down some slippery steps — as if to look at something secret that he had to show . They came back , wiping their hands upon their coats , after turning over something wet ; but thank God it was not what I feared ! After some further conference , Mr. Bucket ( whom everybody seemed to know and defer to ) went in with the others at a door and left me in the carriage , while the driver walked up and down by his horses to warm himself . The tide was coming in , as I judged from the sound it made , and I could hear it break at the end of the alley with a little rush towards me . It never did so — and I thought it did so , hundreds of times , in what can have been at the most a quarter of an hour , and probably was less — but the thought shuddered through me that it would cast my mother at the horses ’ feet . Mr. Bucket came out again , exhorting the others to be vigilant , darkened his lantern , and once more took his seat . “
380856	380864	380845	380846	Miss Summerson	280	” he said , turning to me . “
380893	381250	381251	381255	An old acquaintance of yours	8493	” We appeared to retrace the way we had come . Not that I had taken note of any particular objects in my perturbed state of mind , but judging from the general character of the streets . We called at another office or station for a minute and crossed the river again . During the whole of this time , and during the whole search , my companion , wrapped up on the box , never relaxed in his vigilance a single moment ; but when we crossed the bridge he seemed , if possible , to be more on the alert than before . He stood up to look over the parapet , he alighted and went back after a shadowy female figure that flitted past us , and he gazed into the profound black pit of water with a face that made my heart die within me . The river had a fearful look , so overcast and secret , creeping away so fast between the low flat lines of shore — so heavy with indistinct and awful shapes , both of substance and shadow ; so death - like and mysterious . I have seen it many times since then , by sunlight and by moonlight , but never free from the impressions of that journey . In my memory the lights upon the bridge are always burning dim , the cutting wind is eddying round the homeless woman whom we pass , the monotonous wheels are whirling on , and the light of the carriage - lamps reflected back looks palely in upon me — a face rising out of the dreaded water . Clattering and clattering through the empty streets , we came at length from the pavement on to dark smooth roads and began to leave the houses behind us . After a while I recognized the familiar way to Saint Albans . At Barnet fresh horses were ready for us , and we changed and went on . It was very cold indeed , and the open country was white with snow , though none was falling then . “
381263	381269	381260	381261	Miss Summerson	280	” said Mr. Bucket cheerfully . “
381272	381276	381260	381261	Miss Summerson	280	” I returned . “
381283	381284	381278	381278	you	8495	” “
381295	381299	381278	381278	you	8495	” he answered , “
381308	381407	381411	381412	my lad	8469	” He had gone into every late or early public - house where there was a light ( they were not a few at that time , the road being then much frequented by drovers ) and had got down to talk to the turnpike - keepers . I had heard him ordering drink , and chinking money , and making himself agreeable and merry everywhere ; but whenever he took his seat upon the box again , his face resumed its watchful steady look , and he always said to the driver in the same business tone , “
381414	381456	381411	381412	my lad	8469	” With all these stoppages , it was between five and six o’clock and we were yet a few miles short of Saint Albans when he came out of one of these houses and handed me in a cup of tea . “
381482	381492	381493	381493	You	280	” I thanked him and said I hoped so . “
381503	381507	381509	381509	Lord	8497	” he returned ; “
381532	381559	381527	381527	She	8499	” I do n’t know what joyful exclamation I made or was going to make , but he put up his finger and I stopped myself . “
381683	381751	381676	381677	my lad	8469	” We were soon in Saint Albans and alighted a little before day , when I was just beginning to arrange and comprehend the occurrences of the night and really to believe that they were not a dream . Leaving the carriage at the posting - house and ordering fresh horses to be ready , my companion gave me his arm , and we went towards home . “
381765	381769	381759	381760	Miss Summerson	280	” he observed , “
381806	381867	381880	381880	you	9540	” As we ascended the hill , he looked about him with a sharp eye — the day was now breaking — and reminded me that I had come down it one night , as I had reason for remembering , with my little servant and poor Jo , whom he called Toughey . I wondered how he knew that . “
381883	381898	381871	381872	a man	9970	” said Mr. Bucket . Yes , I remembered that too , very well . “
381903	381916	381917	381917	I	0	” said Mr. Bucket . Seeing my surprise , he went on , “
382007	382008	382001	382001	you	9540	” “
382015	382019	382001	382001	you	9540	” I asked . “
382026	382037	382001	382001	you	9540	” said Mr. Bucket , coolly lifting off his hat , “
382164	382165	382166	382167	Poor creature	8515	” “
382169	382172	382166	382167	Poor creature	8515	” said I. “
382176	382181	382166	382167	Poor creature	8515	” assented Mr. Bucket , “
382219	382225	382214	382214	I	0	” I asked him why . “
382231	382236	382214	382214	I	0	” said Mr. Bucket . “
382268	382355	382247	382247	He	10801	” Although I remember this conversation now , my head was in confusion at the time , and my power of attention hardly did more than enable me to understand that he entered into these particulars to divert me . With the same kind intention , manifestly , he often spoke to me of indifferent things , while his face was busy with the one object that we had in view . He still pursued this subject as we turned in at the garden - gate . “
382358	382363	382247	382247	He	10801	” said Mr. Bucket . “
382491	382520	382469	382469	you	8525	” We were now in front of the house ; he looked attentively and closely at the gravel for footprints before he raised his eyes to the windows . “
382544	382556	382541	382542	Miss Summerson	280	” he inquired , glancing at Mr. Skimpole ’s usual chamber . “
382562	382565	382559	382560	Mr. Skimpole	323	” said I. “
382573	382583	382568	382568	you	9540	” returned Mr. Bucket , bending down his ear . “
382612	382613	382614	382614	Harold	323	” “
382616	382621	382622	382622	Harold	323	” I told him . “
382634	382645	382632	382632	Harold	323	” said Mr. Bucket , eyeing me with great expression . “
382652	382655	382648	382650	a singular character	8534	” said I. “
382661	382666	382648	382650	a singular character	8534	” observed Mr. Bucket . “
382673	382687	382667	382667	He	323	” I involuntarily returned for answer that I perceived Mr. Bucket knew him . “
382699	382703	382691	382691	I	0	” he replied . “
383090	383117	383077	383077	he	681	” I regarded this as very treacherous on the part of Mr. Skimpole towards my guardian and as passing the usual bounds of his childish innocence . “
383123	383128	383077	383077	he	681	” returned Mr. Bucket . “
383344	383430	383433	383434	Miss Summerson	280	” I believe it had not been for a moment out of his mind , any more than it had been out of my mind , or out of his face . The whole household were amazed to see me , without any notice , at that time in the morning , and so accompanied ; and their surprise was not diminished by my inquiries . No one , however , had been there . It could not be doubted that this was the truth . “
383436	383441	383433	383434	Miss Summerson	280	” said my companion , “
383495	383798	383799	383799	Liz	395	” We set off again immediately . On arriving at the cottage , we found it shut up and apparently deserted , but one of the neighbours who knew me and who came out when I was trying to make some one hear informed me that the two women and their husbands now lived together in another house , made of loose rough bricks , which stood on the margin of the piece of ground where the kilns were and where the long rows of bricks were drying . We lost no time in repairing to this place , which was within a few hundred yards ; and as the door stood ajar , I pushed it open . There were only three of them sitting at breakfast , the child lying asleep on a bed in the corner . It was Jenny , the mother of the dead child , who was absent . The other woman rose on seeing me ; and the men , though they were , as usual , sulky and silent , each gave me a morose nod of recognition . A look passed between them when Mr. Bucket followed me in , and I was surprised to see that the woman evidently knew him . I had asked leave to enter of course . Liz ( the only name by which I knew her ) rose to give me her own chair , but I sat down on a stool near the fire , and Mr. Bucket took a corner of the bedstead . Now that I had to speak and was among people with whom I was not familiar , I became conscious of being hurried and giddy . It was very difficult to begin , and I could not help bursting into tears . “
383801	383805	383799	383799	Liz	395	” said I , “
383825	383826	383822	383823	a lady	2488	” “
383835	383851	383854	383855	the lady	1180	” Mr. Bucket struck in , addressing the whole group with a composed propitiatory face ; “
383872	383873	383861	383867	The lady that was here last night	8567	” “
383884	383909	383910	383932	A person of the name of Michael Jackson , with a blue welveteen waistcoat with a double row of mother of pearl buttons	8570	” inquired Jenny ’s husband , who had made a surly stop in his eating to listen and now measured him with his eye . “
383934	383940	383941	383941	He	8570	” Mr. Bucket immediately answered . “
383954	383959	383946	383946	his	8570	” growled the man . “
383969	383978	383960	383960	He	8570	” said Mr. Bucket apologetically for Michael Jackson , “
383984	384084	384085	384085	I	0	” The woman had not resumed her chair , but stood faltering with her hand upon its broken back , looking at me . I thought she would have spoken to me privately if she had dared . She was still in this attitude of uncertainty when her husband , who was eating with a lump of bread and fat in one hand and his clasp - knife in the other , struck the handle of his knife violently on the table and told her with an oath to mind HER own business at any rate and sit down . “
384095	384099	384091	384091	Jenny	357	” said I , “
384143	384198	384199	384199	I	0	” The woman had a great desire to answer , but the man , with another oath , openly kicked at her foot with his heavy boot . He left it to Jenny ’s husband to say what he chose , and after a dogged silence the latter turned his shaggy head towards me . “
384328	384329	384321	384321	She	357	” “
384336	384340	384331	384331	she	357	” I asked . “
384354	384365	384349	384349	She	357	” he answered with a sulky jerk of his head . “
384405	384409	384395	384395	you	8583	” said I , “
384419	384420	384395	384395	you	8583	” “
384437	384443	384444	384445	Your master	5207	” the woman timidly began . “
384447	384459	384444	384445	Your master	5207	” said her husband , muttering an imprecation with slow emphasis , “
384474	384499	384520	384521	the lady	1180	” After another silence , the husband of the absent woman , turning to me again , answered me with his usual grumbling unwillingness . “
384765	384771	384762	384762	He	2359	” The other man repeated , “
384778	384779	384762	384762	He	2359	” “
384785	384789	384781	384782	the lady	1180	” I inquired . “
384794	384800	384790	384790	Devil	504	” returned the first man . “
384823	384876	384815	384815	she	1180	” The woman sat with her arms crossed and her eyes upon the ground . Her husband had turned his seat a little so as to face her and kept his hammer - like hand upon the table as if it were in readiness to execute his threat if she disobeyed him . “
384889	384893	384916	384916	she	1180	” said I , “
384899	384900	384895	384896	the lady	1180	” “
384905	384912	384913	384913	You	3788	” he gruffly cried to her . “
384926	384927	384916	384916	she	1180	” “
384930	384935	384916	384916	she	1180	” replied the woman . “
384943	384944	384946	384946	she	1180	” “
384950	384951	384946	384946	she	1180	” “
384961	384975	384956	384956	her	1180	” She answered , looking all the while at her husband for leave . “
384980	384983	384977	384977	she	1180	” said I. “
384991	384992	384977	384977	she	1180	” “
384996	385006	385008	385008	her	1180	” said the husband in answer to her look . “
385014	385015	385008	385008	her	1180	” “
385039	385040	385034	385034	she	1180	” “
385048	385062	385043	385043	she	1180	” I was proceeding , when Jenny ’s husband impatiently took me up . “
385108	385161	385164	385165	Miss Summerson	280	” I glanced at my companion , and finding that he had already risen and was ready to depart , thanked them for what they had told me , and took my leave . The woman looked full at Mr. Bucket as he went out , and he looked full at her . “
385167	385178	385164	385165	Miss Summerson	280	” he said to me as we walked quickly away . “
385195	385196	385197	385197	You	8611	” “
385201	385205	385197	385197	You	8611	” I exclaimed . “
385213	385217	385197	385197	You	8611	” he returned . “
385315	385343	385309	385309	she	921	” He repeated this question to himself several times as we hurried on , appearing to balance between a variety of answers that arose in his mind . “
385350	385355	385301	385301	she	921	” said Mr. Bucket , “
385460	385484	385456	385458	the other woman	12658	” I regretted it exceedingly , for she was very grateful , and I felt sure would have resisted no entreaty of mine . “
385492	385501	385489	385490	Miss Summerson	280	” said Mr. Bucket , pondering on it , “
385610	385966	385596	385597	Miss Summerson	280	” We called at home once more that I might send a hasty note to my guardian , and then we hurried back to where we had left the carriage . The horses were brought out as soon as we were seen coming , and we were on the road again in a few minutes . It had set in snowing at daybreak , and it now snowed hard . The air was so thick with the darkness of the day and the density of the fall that we could see but a very little way in any direction . Although it was extremely cold , the snow was but partially frozen , and it churned — with a sound as if it were a beach of small shells — under the hoofs of the horses into mire and water . They sometimes slipped and floundered for a mile together , and we were obliged to come to a standstill to rest them . One horse fell three times in this first stage , and trembled so and was so shaken that the driver had to dismount from his saddle and lead him at last . I could eat nothing and could not sleep , and I grew so nervous under those delays and the slow pace at which we travelled that I had an unreasonable desire upon me to get out and walk . Yielding to my companion ’s better sense , however , I remained where I was . All this time , kept fresh by a certain enjoyment of the work in which he was engaged , he was up and down at every house we came to , addressing people whom he had never beheld before as old acquaintances , running in to warm himself at every fire he saw , talking and drinking and shaking hands at every bar and tap , friendly with every waggoner , wheelwright , blacksmith , and toll - taker , yet never seeming to lose time , and always mounting to the box again with his watchful , steady face and his business - like “
385973	386033	385596	385597	Miss Summerson	280	” When we were changing horses the next time , he came from the stable - yard , with the wet snow encrusted upon him and dropping off him — plashing and crashing through it to his wet knees as he had been doing frequently since we left Saint Albans — and spoke to me at the carriage side . “
386072	386073	386090	386090	you	8469	” “
386078	386081	386090	386090	you	8469	” said I. “
386119	386120	386121	386121	I	0	” “
386126	386129	386121	386121	I	0	” said I. “
386145	386146	386133	386137	some one else nearer here	8633	” “
386186	386414	386418	386419	my lad	8469	” The sleet fell all that day unceasingly , a thick mist came on early , and it never rose or lightened for a moment . Such roads I had never seen . I sometimes feared we had missed the way and got into the ploughed grounds or the marshes . If I ever thought of the time I had been out , it presented itself as an indefinite period of great duration , and I seemed , in a strange way , never to have been free from the anxiety under which I then laboured . As we advanced , I began to feel misgivings that my companion lost confidence . He was the same as before with all the roadside people , but he looked graver when he sat by himself on the box . I saw his finger uneasily going across and across his mouth during the whole of one long weary stage . I overheard that he began to ask the drivers of coaches and other vehicles coming towards us what passengers they had seen in other coaches and vehicles that were in advance . Their replies did not encourage him . He always gave me a reassuring beck of his finger and lift of his eyelid as he got upon the box again , but he seemed perplexed now when he said , “
386421	387436	386418	386419	my lad	8469	” At last , when we were changing , he told me that he had lost the track of the dress so long that he began to be surprised . It was nothing , he said , to lose such a track for one while , and to take it up for another while , and so on ; but it had disappeared here in an unaccountable manner , and we had not come upon it since . This corroborated the apprehensions I had formed , when he began to look at direction - posts , and to leave the carriage at cross roads for a quarter of an hour at a time while he explored them . But I was not to be down - hearted , he told me , for it was as likely as not that the next stage might set us right again . The next stage , however , ended as that one ended ; we had no new clue . There was a spacious inn here , solitary , but a comfortable substantial building , and as we drove in under a large gateway before I knew it , where a landlady and her pretty daughters came to the carriage - door , entreating me to alight and refresh myself while the horses were making ready , I thought it would be uncharitable to refuse . They took me upstairs to a warm room and left me there . It was at the corner of the house , I remember , looking two ways . On one side to a stable - yard open to a by - road , where the ostlers were unharnessing the splashed and tired horses from the muddy carriage , and beyond that to the by - road itself , across which the sign was heavily swinging ; on the other side to a wood of dark pine - trees . Their branches were encumbered with snow , and it silently dropped off in wet heaps while I stood at the window . Night was setting in , and its bleakness was enhanced by the contrast of the pictured fire glowing and gleaming in the window - pane . As I looked among the stems of the trees and followed the discoloured marks in the snow where the thaw was sinking into it and undermining it , I thought of the motherly face brightly set off by daughters that had just now welcomed me and of MY mother lying down in such a wood to die . I was frightened when I found them all about me , but I remembered that before I fainted I tried very hard not to do it ; and that was some little comfort . They cushioned me up on a large sofa by the fire , and then the comely landlady told me that I must travel no further to - night , but must go to bed . But this put me into such a tremble lest they should detain me there that she soon recalled her words and compromised for a rest of half an hour . A good endearing creature she was . She and her three fair girls , all so busy about me . I was to take hot soup and broiled fowl , while Mr. Bucket dried himself and dined elsewhere ; but I could not do it when a snug round table was presently spread by the fireside , though I was very unwilling to disappoint them . However , I could take some toast and some hot negus ; and as I really enjoyed that refreshment , it made some recompense . Punctual to the time , at the half - hour ’s end the carriage came rumbling under the gateway , and they took me down , warmed , refreshed , comforted by kindness , and safe ( I assured them ) not to faint any more . After I had got in and had taken a grateful leave of them all , the youngest daughter — a blooming girl of nineteen , who was to be the first married , they had told me — got upon the carriage step , reached in , and kissed me . I have never seen her , from that hour , but I think of her to this hour as my friend . The transparent windows with the fire and light , looking so bright and warm from the cold darkness out of doors , were soon gone , and again we were crushing and churning the loose snow . We went on with toil enough , but the dismal roads were not much worse than they had been , and the stage was only nine miles . My companion smoking on the box — I had thought at the last inn of begging him to do so when I saw him standing at a great fire in a comfortable cloud of tobacco — was as vigilant as ever and as quickly down and up again when we came to any human abode or any human creature . He had lighted his little dark lantern , which seemed to be a favourite with him , for we had lamps to the carriage ; and every now and then he turned it upon me to see that I was doing well . There was a folding - window to the carriage - head , but I never closed it , for it seemed like shutting out hope . We came to the end of the stage , and still the lost trace was not recovered . I looked at him anxiously when we stopped to change , but I knew by his yet graver face as he stood watching the ostlers that he had heard nothing . Almost in an instant afterwards , as I leaned back in my seat , he looked in , with his lighted lantern in his hand , an excited and quite different man . “
387441	387447	386418	386419	my lad	8469	” said I , starting . “
387452	387453	387449	387449	she	8637	” “
387476	387514	387471	387471	I	0	” The crystallized snow was in his eyelashes , in his hair , lying in ridges on his dress . He had to shake it from his face and get his breath before he spoke to me . “
387520	387531	387517	387518	Miss Summerson	280	” said he , beating his finger on the apron , “
387584	387611	387614	387614	I	0	” There was a commotion in the yard , and a man came running out of the stables to know if he meant up or down . “
387627	387628	387685	387686	The other	1623	” “
387631	387637	387685	387686	The other	1623	” said I , astonished . “
387646	387647	387648	387649	Miss Summerson	280	” “
387651	387655	387648	387649	Miss Summerson	280	” he answered , “
387683	387684	387685	387686	The other	1623	” “
387688	387692	387685	387686	The other	1623	” I repeated . “
387695	387696	387697	387697	You	280	” “
387730	387731	387728	387728	you	280	” “
387768	387781	387782	387782	You	280	” said I , in an agony , and grasping his hand . “
387846	387905	387906	387906	My	0	” These orders and the way in which he ran about the yard urging them caused a general excitement that was scarcely less bewildering to me than the sudden change . But in the height of the confusion , a mounted man galloped away to order the relays , and our horses were put to with great speed . “
387909	387923	387906	387906	My	0	” said Mr. Bucket , jumping to his seat and looking in again , “
387969	388031	387967	387967	you	280	” I endeavoured to say that I knew he was far more capable than I of deciding what we ought to do , but was he sure that this was right ? Could I not go forward by myself in search of — I grasped his hand again in my distress and whispered it to him — of my own mother . “
388035	388039	387967	387967	you	280	” he answered , “
388069	388077	388061	388061	you	9540	” What could I say but yes ! “
388117	388118	388113	388113	you	9540	” “
388124	388125	388122	388122	sir	9496	” “
388139	388474	388475	388475	Our	8659	” We were again upon the melancholy road by which we had come , tearing up the miry sleet and thawing snow as if they were torn up by a waterwheel . CHAPTER LVIII A Wintry Day and Night Still impassive , as behoves its breeding , the Dedlock town house carries itself as usual towards the street of dismal grandeur . There are powdered heads from time to time in the little windows of the hall , looking out at the untaxed powder falling all day from the sky ; and in the same conservatory there is peach blossom turning itself exotically to the great hall fire from the nipping weather out of doors . It is given out that my Lady has gone down into Lincolnshire , but is expected to return presently . Rumour , busy overmuch , however , will not go down into Lincolnshire . It persists in flitting and chattering about town . It knows that that poor unfortunate man , Sir Leicester , has been sadly used . It hears , my dear child , all sorts of shocking things . It makes the world of five miles round quite merry . Not to know that there is something wrong at the Dedlocks ’ is to augur yourself unknown . One of the peachy - cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats is already apprised of all the principal circumstances that will come out before the Lords on Sir Leicester ’s application for a bill of divorce . At Blaze and Sparkle ’s the jewellers and at Sheen and Gloss ’s the mercers , it is and will be for several hours the topic of the age , the feature of the century . The patronesses of those establishments , albeit so loftily inscrutable , being as nicely weighed and measured there as any other article of the stock - in - trade , are perfectly understood in this new fashion by the rawest hand behind the counter . “
388481	388495	388478	388479	Mr. Jones	683	” said Blaze and Sparkle to the hand in question on engaging him , “
388538	388599	388529	388530	Mr. Jones	683	” So , likewise , Sheen and Gloss to THEIR Jones , in reference to knowing where to have the fashionable people and how to bring what they ( Sheen and Gloss ) choose into fashion . On similar unerring principles , Mr. Sladdery the librarian , and indeed the great farmer of gorgeous sheep , admits this very day , “
388790	389080	388788	388788	sir	9496	” Thus rumour thrives in the capital , and will not go down into Lincolnshire . By half - past five , post meridian , Horse Guards ’ time , it has even elicited a new remark from the Honourable Mr. Stables , which bids fair to outshine the old one , on which he has so long rested his colloquial reputation . This sparkling sally is to the effect that although he always knew she was the best - groomed woman in the stud , he had no idea she was a bolter . It is immensely received in turf - circles . At feasts and festivals also , in firmaments she has often graced , and among constellations she outshone but yesterday , she is still the prevalent subject . What is it ? Who is it ? When was it ? Where was it ? How was it ? She is discussed by her dear friends with all the genteelest slang in vogue , with the last new word , the last new manner , the last new drawl , and the perfection of polite indifference . A remarkable feature of the theme is that it is found to be so inspiring that several people come out upon it who never came out before — positively say things ! William Buffy carries one of these smartnesses from the place where he dines down to the House , where the Whip for his party hands it about with his snuff - box to keep men together who want to be off , with such effect that the Speaker ( who has had it privately insinuated into his own ear under the corner of his wig ) cries , “
389086	389405	388788	388788	sir	9496	” three times without making an impression . And not the least amazing circumstance connected with her being vaguely the town talk is that people hovering on the confines of Mr. Sladdery ’s high connexion , people who know nothing and ever did know nothing about her , think it essential to their reputation to pretend that she is their topic too , and to retail her at second - hand with the last new word and the last new manner , and the last new drawl , and the last new polite indifference , and all the rest of it , all at second - hand but considered equal to new in inferior systems and to fainter stars . If there be any man of letters , art , or science among these little dealers , how noble in him to support the feeble sisters on such majestic crutches ! So goes the wintry day outside the Dedlock mansion . How within it ? Sir Leicester , lying in his bed , can speak a little , though with difficulty and indistinctness . He is enjoined to silence and to rest , and they have given him some opiate to lull his pain , for his old enemy is very hard with him . He is never asleep , though sometimes he seems to fall into a dull waking doze . He caused his bedstead to be moved out nearer to the window when he heard it was such inclement weather , and his head to be so adjusted that he could see the driving snow and sleet . He watches it as it falls , throughout the whole wintry day . Upon the least noise in the house , which is kept hushed , his hand is at the pencil . The old housekeeper , sitting by him , knows what he would write and whispers , “
389437	389571	389427	389427	He	8677	” He withdraws his hand and falls to looking at the sleet and snow again until they seem , by being long looked at , to fall so thick and fast that he is obliged to close his eyes for a minute on the giddy whirl of white flakes and icy blots . He began to look at them as soon as it was light . The day is not yet far spent when he conceives it to be necessary that her rooms should be prepared for her . It is very cold and wet . Let there be good fires . Let them know that she is expected . Please see to it yourself . He writes to this purpose on his slate , and Mrs. Rouncewell with a heavy heart obeys . “
389578	389601	389576	389576	George	332	” the old lady says to her son , who waits below to keep her company when she has a little leisure , “
389620	389621	389609	389610	my Lady	958	” “
389630	389631	389628	389628	mother	9526	” “
389644	389645	389641	389642	my dear	9540	” “
389655	389656	389653	389653	mother	9526	” “
389694	389695	389672	389672	I	0	” “
389711	389712	389700	389700	You	332	” “
389769	389770	389775	389775	mother	9526	” “
389777	389778	389775	389775	mother	9526	” “
389860	389861	389867	389867	I	0	” “
389875	389876	389867	389867	I	0	” “
389885	389900	389883	389883	George	332	” the old lady returns , shaking her head and parting her folded hands . “
389920	389921	389924	389924	her	958	” “
389927	389928	389924	389924	her	958	” “
389942	389943	389938	389938	she	958	” “
389948	389963	389964	389964	I	0	” says the trooper , glancing round him and speaking in a lower voice , “
390023	390319	390320	390320	He	8702	” He is not far out . As all partings foreshadow the great final one , so , empty rooms , bereft of a familiar presence , mournfully whisper what your room and what mine must one day be . My Lady ’s state has a hollow look , thus gloomy and abandoned ; and in the inner apartment , where Mr. Bucket last night made his secret perquisition , the traces of her dresses and her ornaments , even the mirrors accustomed to reflect them when they were a portion of herself , have a desolate and vacant air . Dark and cold as the wintry day is , it is darker and colder in these deserted chambers than in many a hut that will barely exclude the weather ; and though the servants heap fires in the grates and set the couches and the chairs within the warm glass screens that let their ruddy light shoot through to the furthest corners , there is a heavy cloud upon the rooms which no light will dispel . The old housekeeper and her son remain until the preparations are complete , and then she returns upstairs . Volumnia has taken Mrs. Rouncewell ’s place in the meantime , though pearl necklaces and rouge pots , however calculated to embellish Bath , are but indifferent comforts to the invalid under present circumstances . Volumnia , not being supposed to know ( and indeed not knowing ) what is the matter , has found it a ticklish task to offer appropriate observations and consequently has supplied their place with distracting smoothings of the bed - linen , elaborate locomotion on tiptoe , vigilant peeping at her kinsman ’s eyes , and one exasperating whisper to herself of , “
390324	390340	390320	390320	He	8702	” In disproof of which superfluous remark Sir Leicester has indignantly written on the slate , “
390345	390431	390320	390320	He	8702	” Yielding , therefore , the chair at the bedside to the quaint old housekeeper , Volumnia sits at a table a little removed , sympathetically sighing . Sir Leicester watches the sleet and snow and listens for the returning steps that he expects . In the ears of his old servant , looking as if she had stepped out of an old picture - frame to attend a summoned Dedlock to another world , the silence is fraught with echoes of her own words , “
390437	390738	390320	390320	He	8702	” He has been under his valet ’s hands this morning to be made presentable and is as well got up as the circumstances will allow . He is propped with pillows , his grey hair is brushed in its usual manner , his linen is arranged to a nicety , and he is wrapped in a responsible dressing - gown . His eye - glass and his watch are ready to his hand . It is necessary — less to his own dignity now perhaps than for her sake — that he should be seen as little disturbed and as much himself as may be . Women will talk , and Volumnia , though a Dedlock , is no exceptional case . He keeps her here , there is little doubt , to prevent her talking somewhere else . He is very ill , but he makes his present stand against distress of mind and body most courageously . The fair Volumnia , being one of those sprightly girls who can not long continue silent without imminent peril of seizure by the dragon Boredom , soon indicates the approach of that monster with a series of undisguisable yawns . Finding it impossible to suppress those yawns by any other process than conversation , she compliments Mrs. Rouncewell on her son , declaring that he positively is one of the finest figures she ever saw and as soldierly a looking person , she should think , as what ’s his name , her favourite Life Guardsman — the man she dotes on , the dearest of creatures — who was killed at Waterloo . Sir Leicester hears this tribute with so much surprise and stares about him in such a confused way that Mrs. Rouncewell feels it necessary to explain . “
390766	390776	390777	390777	George	332	” Sir Leicester breaks silence with a harsh cry . “
390788	390796	390781	390781	George	332	” The old housekeeper wipes her eyes . “
390805	390838	390802	390803	Sir Leicester	266	” Does this discovery of some one lost , this return of some one so long gone , come upon him as a strong confirmation of his hopes ? Does he think , “
390869	390904	390907	390907	you	328	” It is of no use entreating him ; he is determined to speak now , and he does . In a thick crowd of sounds , but still intelligibly enough to be understood . “
390915	390916	390907	390907	you	328	” “
390940	391003	390926	390926	I	0	” Besides , the giddy Volumnia now remembers with her little scream that nobody was to have known of his being Mrs. Rouncewell ’s son and that she was not to have told . But Mrs. Rouncewell protests , with warmth enough to swell the stomacher , that of course she would have told Sir Leicester as soon as he got better . “
391013	391039	391010	391011	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	” asks Sir Leicester , Mrs. Rouncewell , not a little alarmed by his disregard of the doctor ’s injunctions , replies , in London . “
391044	391058	390926	390926	I	0	” Mrs. Rouncewell is constrained to admit that he is in the house . “
391070	391214	390926	390926	I	0	” The old lady can do nothing but go in search of him . Sir Leicester , with such power of movement as he has , arranges himself a little to receive him . When he has done so , he looks out again at the falling sleet and snow and listens again for the returning steps . A quantity of straw has been tumbled down in the street to deaden the noises there , and she might be driven to the door perhaps without his hearing wheels . He is lying thus , apparently forgetful of his newer and minor surprise , when the housekeeper returns , accompanied by her trooper son . Mr. George approaches softly to the bedside , makes his bow , squares his chest , and stands , with his face flushed , very heartily ashamed of himself . “
391225	391230	391222	391223	George Rouncewell	332	” exclaims Sir Leicester . “
391238	391277	391232	391232	you	332	” The trooper needs to look at him and to separate this sound from that sound before he knows what he has said , but doing this and being a little helped by his mother , he replies , “
391298	391299	391296	391296	you	266	” “
391309	391316	391306	391307	George Rouncewell	332	” Sir Leicester observes with difficulty , “
391334	391358	391359	391359	I	0	” He looks at the trooper until tears come into his eyes , and then he looks at the sleet and snow again . “
391367	391372	391359	391359	I	0	” says the trooper , “
391402	391403	391405	391405	you	266	” “
391418	391445	391447	391447	you	266	” The trooper takes him in his arms like a child , lightly raises him , and turns him with his face more towards the window . “
391456	391461	391451	391452	your mother	9534	” returns Sir Leicester , “
391470	391496	391468	391468	you	266	” He signs to him with his hand not to go away . George quietly remains at the bedside , waiting to be spoken to . “
391504	391515	391499	391499	you	266	” It takes Sir Leicester some time to ask this . “
391625	391626	391617	391617	I	0	” “
391633	391638	391627	391627	You	266	” observes Sir Leicester , “
391644	391651	391627	391627	You	266	” George makes his military bow . “
391678	391679	391680	391680	You	266	” “
391684	391697	391680	391680	You	266	” says Sir Leicester , whose eyes are much attracted towards him , “
391705	391706	391702	391703	George Rouncewell	332	” “
391723	391724	391728	391728	you	266	” “
391753	391765	391702	391703	George Rouncewell	332	” making an endeavour to pass one hand down one side , “
391769	391884	391702	391703	George Rouncewell	332	” touching his lips . George , with a look of assent and sympathy , makes another bow . The different times when they were both young men ( the trooper much the younger of the two ) and looked at one another down at Chesney Wold arise before them both and soften both . Sir Leicester , evidently with a great determination to say , in his own manner , something that is on his mind before relapsing into silence , tries to raise himself among his pillows a little more . George , observant of the action , takes him in his arms again and places him as he desires to be . “
391923	391956	391910	391910	You	0	” He has put Sir Leicester ’s sounder arm over his shoulder in lifting him up , and Sir Leicester is slow in drawing it away again as he says these words . “
391963	391969	391957	391957	I	0	” he presently goes on , “
392082	392140	392073	392073	my	0	” Volumnia understands him perfectly , and in truth he delivers himself with far greater plainness than could have been supposed possible a minute ago . The effort by which he does so is written in the anxious and labouring expression of his face . Nothing but the strength of his purpose enables him to make it . “
392239	392276	392233	392233	I	0	” The old housekeeper weeping silently ; Volumnia in the greatest agitation , with the freshest bloom on her cheeks ; the trooper with his arms folded and his head a little bent , respectfully attentive . “
392368	392382	392358	392358	you	8724	” Volumnia tremblingly protests that she will observe his injunctions to the letter . “
392512	392838	392503	392503	I	0	” His formal array of words might have at any other time , as it has often had , something ludicrous in it , but at this time it is serious and affecting . His noble earnestness , his fidelity , his gallant shielding of her , his generous conquest of his own wrong and his own pride for her sake , are simply honourable , manly , and true . Nothing less worthy can be seen through the lustre of such qualities in the commonest mechanic , nothing less worthy can be seen in the best - born gentleman . In such a light both aspire alike , both rise alike , both children of the dust shine equally . Overpowered by his exertions , he lays his head back on his pillows and closes his eyes for not more than a minute , when he again resumes his watching of the weather and his attention to the muffled sounds . In the rendering of those little services , and in the manner of their acceptance , the trooper has become installed as necessary to him . Nothing has been said , but it is quite understood . He falls a step or two backward to be out of sight and mounts guard a little behind his mother ’s chair . The day is now beginning to decline . The mist and the sleet into which the snow has all resolved itself are darker , and the blaze begins to tell more vividly upon the room walls and furniture . The gloom augments ; the bright gas springs up in the streets ; and the pertinacious oil lamps which yet hold their ground there , with their source of life half frozen and half thawed , twinkle gaspingly like fiery fish out of water — as they are . The world , which has been rumbling over the straw and pulling at the bell , “
392842	392980	392503	392503	I	0	” begins to go home , begins to dress , to dine , to discuss its dear friend with all the last new modes , as already mentioned . Now does Sir Leicester become worse , restless , uneasy , and in great pain . Volumnia , lighting a candle ( with a predestined aptitude for doing something objectionable ) , is bidden to put it out again , for it is not yet dark enough . Yet it is very dark too , as dark as it will be all night . By and by she tries again . No ! Put it out . It is not dark enough yet . His old housekeeper is the first to understand that he is striving to uphold the fiction with himself that it is not growing late . “
392989	392994	392981	392983	Dear Sir Leicester	685	” she softly whispers , “
393087	393088	393077	393078	My Lady	958	” “
393109	393110	393102	393102	she	958	” “
393126	393127	393116	393117	Sir Leicester	685	” “
393143	393230	393235	393236	Mrs. Rouncewell	328	” He says it with a groan that wrings her heart . She knows that this is not a period for bringing the rough light upon him ; she thinks his tears too sacred to be seen , even by her . Therefore she sits in the darkness for a while without a word , then gently begins to move about , now stirring the fire , now standing at the dark window looking out . Finally he tells her , with recovered self - command , “
393261	393682	394024	394024	miss	9584	” When it is lighted and the weather shut out , it is only left to him to listen . But they find that however dejected and ill he is , he brightens when a quiet pretence is made of looking at the fires in her rooms and being sure that everything is ready to receive her . Poor pretence as it is , these allusions to her being expected keep up hope within him . Midnight comes , and with it the same blank . The carriages in the streets are few , and other late sounds in that neighbourhood there are none , unless a man so very nomadically drunk as to stray into the frigid zone goes brawling and bellowing along the pavement . Upon this wintry night it is so still that listening to the intense silence is like looking at intense darkness . If any distant sound be audible in this case , it departs through the gloom like a feeble light in that , and all is heavier than before . The corporation of servants are dismissed to bed ( not unwilling to go , for they were up all last night ) , and only Mrs. Rouncewell and George keep watch in Sir Leicester ’s room . As the night lags tardily on — or rather when it seems to stop altogether , at between two and three o’clock — they find a restless craving on him to know more about the weather , now he can not see it . Hence George , patrolling regularly every half - hour to the rooms so carefully looked after , extends his march to the hall - door , looks about him , and brings back the best report he can make of the worst of nights , the sleet still falling and even the stone footways lying ankle - deep in icy sludge . Volumnia , in her room up a retired landing on the staircase — the second turning past the end of the carving and gilding , a cousinly room containing a fearful abortion of a portrait of Sir Leicester banished for its crimes , and commanding in the day a solemn yard planted with dried - up shrubs like antediluvian specimens of black tea — is a prey to horrors of many kinds . Not last nor least among them , possibly , is a horror of what may befall her little income in the event , as she expresses it , “
393686	393993	394024	394024	miss	9584	” to Sir Leicester . Anything , in this sense , meaning one thing only ; and that the last thing that can happen to the consciousness of any baronet in the known world . An effect of these horrors is that Volumnia finds she can not go to bed in her own room or sit by the fire in her own room , but must come forth with her fair head tied up in a profusion of shawl , and her fair form enrobed in drapery , and parade the mansion like a ghost , particularly haunting the rooms , warm and luxurious , prepared for one who still does not return . Solitude under such circumstances being not to be thought of , Volumnia is attended by her maid , who , impressed from her own bed for that purpose , extremely cold , very sleepy , and generally an injured maid as condemned by circumstances to take office with a cousin , when she had resolved to be maid to nothing less than ten thousand a year , has not a sweet expression of countenance . The periodical visits of the trooper to these rooms , however , in the course of his patrolling is an assurance of protection and company both to mistress and maid , which renders them very acceptable in the small hours of the night . Whenever he is heard advancing , they both make some little decorative preparation to receive him ; at other times they divide their watches into short scraps of oblivion and dialogues not wholly free from acerbity , as to whether Miss Dedlock , sitting with her feet upon the fender , was or was not falling into the fire when rescued ( to her great displeasure ) by her guardian genius the maid . “
394003	394014	394000	394001	Mr. George	500	” inquires Volumnia , adjusting her cowl over her head . “
394041	394042	394034	394034	he	685	” “
394049	394054	394044	394044	he	685	” inquires Volumnia tenderly . “
394078	394079	394059	394059	I	0	” “
394090	394091	394087	394088	Mr. George	500	” “
394106	394107	394108	394108	You	9584	” “
394120	394154	394117	394118	Miss Dedlock	625	” quoth the maid sharply . But Volumnia answers No ! No ! She may be asked for , she may be wanted at a moment ’s notice . She never should forgive herself “
394160	394224	394108	394108	You	9584	” and she was not on the spot . She declines to enter on the question , mooted by the maid , how the spot comes to be there , and not in her room ( which is nearer to Sir Leicester ’s ) , but staunchly declares that on the spot she will remain . Volumnia further makes a merit of not having “
394227	394348	394381	394382	Miss Dedlock	625	eye”—as if she had twenty or thirty — though it is hard to reconcile this statement with her having most indisputably opened two within five minutes . But when it comes to four o’clock , and still the same blank , Volumnia ’s constancy begins to fail her , or rather it begins to strengthen , for she now considers that it is her duty to be ready for the morrow , when much may be expected of her , that , in fact , howsoever anxious to remain upon the spot , it may be required of her , as an act of self - devotion , to desert the spot . So when the trooper reappears with his , “
394359	394371	394357	394357	miss	9584	” and when the maid protests , more sharply than before , “
394384	394391	394381	394382	Miss Dedlock	625	” she meekly rises and says , “
394400	394702	394396	394396	you	8736	” Mr. George undoubtedly thinks it best to escort her on his arm to the door of her cousinly chamber , and the maid as undoubtedly thinks it best to hustle her into bed with mighty little ceremony . Accordingly , these steps are taken ; and now the trooper , in his rounds , has the house to himself . There is no improvement in the weather . From the portico , from the eaves , from the parapet , from every ledge and post and pillar , drips the thawed snow . It has crept , as if for shelter , into the lintels of the great door — under it , into the corners of the windows , into every chink and crevice of retreat , and there wastes and dies . It is falling still ; upon the roof , upon the skylight , even through the skylight , and drip , drip , drip , with the regularity of the Ghost ’s Walk , on the stone floor below . The trooper , his old recollections awakened by the solitary grandeur of a great house — no novelty to him once at Chesney Wold — goes up the stairs and through the chief rooms , holding up his light at arm ’s length . Thinking of his varied fortunes within the last few weeks , and of his rustic boyhood , and of the two periods of his life so strangely brought together across the wide intermediate space ; thinking of the murdered man whose image is fresh in his mind ; thinking of the lady who has disappeared from these very rooms and the tokens of whose recent presence are all here ; thinking of the master of the house upstairs and of the foreboding , “
394708	394777	394396	394396	you	8736	” he looks here and looks there , and reflects how he MIGHT see something now , which it would tax his boldness to walk up to , lay his hand upon , and prove to be a fancy . But it is all blank , blank as the darkness above and below , while he goes up the great staircase again , blank as the oppressive silence . “
394787	394788	394784	394785	George Rouncewell	332	” “
394797	394798	394794	394795	Sir Leicester	685	” “
394805	394812	394794	394795	Sir Leicester	685	” The trooper shakes his head . “
394822	394929	394794	394795	Sir Leicester	685	” But he knows there is no such hope as that and lays his head down without looking for an answer . Very familiar to him , as he said himself some hours ago , George Rouncewell lifts him into easier positions through the long remainder of the blank wintry night , and equally familiar with his unexpressed wish , extinguishes the light and undraws the curtains at the first late break of day . The day comes like a phantom . Cold , colourless , and vague , it sends a warning streak before it of a deathlike hue , as if it cried out , “
394945	395107	394932	394932	I	0	” CHAPTER LIX Esther ’s Narrative It was three o’clock in the morning when the houses outside London did at last begin to exclude the country and to close us in with streets . We had made our way along roads in a far worse condition than when we had traversed them by daylight , both the fall and the thaw having lasted ever since ; but the energy of my companion never slackened . It had only been , as I thought , of less assistance than the horses in getting us on , and it had often aided them . They had stopped exhausted half - way up hills , they had been driven through streams of turbulent water , they had slipped down and become entangled with the harness ; but he and his little lantern had been always ready , and when the mishap was set right , I had never heard any variation in his cool , “
395114	395372	394932	394932	I	0	” The steadiness and confidence with which he had directed our journey back I could not account for . Never wavering , he never even stopped to make an inquiry until we were within a few miles of London . A very few words , here and there , were then enough for him ; and thus we came , at between three and four o’clock in the morning , into Islington . I will not dwell on the suspense and anxiety with which I reflected all this time that we were leaving my mother farther and farther behind every minute . I think I had some strong hope that he must be right and could not fail to have a satisfactory object in following this woman , but I tormented myself with questioning it and discussing it during the whole journey . What was to ensue when we found her and what could compensate us for this loss of time were questions also that I could not possibly dismiss ; my mind was quite tortured by long dwelling on such reflections when we stopped . We stopped in a high - street where there was a coach - stand . My companion paid our two drivers , who were as completely covered with splashes as if they had been dragged along the roads like the carriage itself , and giving them some brief direction where to take it , lifted me out of it and into a hackney - coach he had chosen from the rest . “
395378	395386	394932	394932	I	0	” he said as he did this . “
395392	395503	394932	394932	I	0	” I had not been conscious of it . But the melted snow had found its way into the carriage , and I had got out two or three times when a fallen horse was plunging and had to be got up , and the wet had penetrated my dress . I assured him it was no matter , but the driver , who knew him , would not be dissuaded by me from running down the street to his stable , whence he brought an armful of clean dry straw . They shook it out and strewed it well about me , and I found it warm and comfortable . “
395509	395527	394932	394932	I	0	” said Mr. Bucket , with his head in at the window after I was shut up . “
395568	395600	395566	395566	you	9540	” I little thought what it was , little thought in how short a time I should understand it better , but I assured him that I had confidence in him . “
395609	395613	395602	395602	you	9540	” he returned . “
395707	395713	395698	395698	you	9540	” said Mr. Bucket warmly ; “
395719	395751	395752	395752	My	0	” I told him I was very glad , as indeed I was , to have been no hindrance to him , and that I hoped I should be none now . “
395755	395759	395752	395752	My	0	” he returned , “
395807	396073	395792	395792	She	1264	” With these encouraging words — they really were encouraging to me under those lonely and anxious circumstances — he got upon the box , and we once more drove away . Where we drove I neither knew then nor have ever known since , but we appeared to seek out the narrowest and worst streets in London . Whenever I saw him directing the driver , I was prepared for our descending into a deeper complication of such streets , and we never failed to do so . Sometimes we emerged upon a wider thoroughfare or came to a larger building than the generality , well lighted . Then we stopped at offices like those we had visited when we began our journey , and I saw him in consultation with others . Sometimes he would get down by an archway or at a street corner and mysteriously show the light of his little lantern . This would attract similar lights from various dark quarters , like so many insects , and a fresh consultation would be held . By degrees we appeared to contract our search within narrower and easier limits . Single police - officers on duty could now tell Mr. Bucket what he wanted to know and point to him where to go . At last we stopped for a rather long conversation between him and one of these men , which I supposed to be satisfactory from his manner of nodding from time to time . When it was finished he came to me looking very busy and very attentive . “
396079	396085	395792	395792	She	1264	” he said to me , “
396157	396169	396151	396151	you	280	” Of course I got out directly and took his arm . “
396180	396185	396151	396151	you	280	” said Mr. Bucket , “
396190	396212	396151	396151	you	280	” Although I looked about me confusedly and hurriedly as we crossed the street , I thought I knew the place . “
396218	396223	396151	396151	you	280	” I asked him . “
396226	396231	396151	396151	you	280	” said Mr. Bucket . “
396238	396239	396233	396233	you	280	” “
396246	396247	396233	396233	you	280	” “
396256	396415	396416	396417	My dear	9540	” said Mr. Bucket . We turned down it , and as we went shuffling through the sleet , I heard the clocks strike half - past five . We passed on in silence and as quickly as we could with such a foot - hold , when some one coming towards us on the narrow pavement , wrapped in a cloak , stopped and stood aside to give me room . In the same moment I heard an exclamation of wonder and my own name from Mr. Woodcourt . I knew his voice very well . It was so unexpected and so — I do n’t know what to call it , whether pleasant or painful — to come upon it after my feverish wandering journey , and in the midst of the night , that I could not keep back the tears from my eyes . It was like hearing his voice in a strange country . “
396435	396487	396418	396419	Miss Summerson	280	” He had heard from my guardian of my having been called away on some uncommon business and said so to dispense with any explanation . I told him that we had but just left a coach and were going — but then I was obliged to look at my companion . “
396494	396500	396493	396494	Mr. Woodcourt”—he	686	Woodcourt”—he had caught the name from me—“we
396515	396536	396512	396513	Inspector Bucket	673	” Mr. Woodcourt , disregarding my remonstrances , had hurriedly taken off his cloak and was putting it about me . “
396545	396552	396512	396513	Inspector Bucket	673	” said Mr. Bucket , assisting , “
396558	396559	396512	396513	Inspector Bucket	673	” “
396566	396583	396561	396561	I	0	” said Mr. Woodcourt . I do n’t know whether to me or to my companion . “
396588	396599	396586	396586	Lord	8759	” exclaimed Mr. Bucket , taking the answer on himself . “
396605	396626	396602	396602	you	0	” It was all said in a moment , and they took me between them , wrapped in the cloak . “
396633	396638	396627	396627	I	0	” said Mr. Woodcourt . “
396651	396652	396639	396639	I	0	” “
396662	396663	396658	396658	he	8760	” “
396780	396858	396777	396777	I	0	” His friendly and familiar way of speaking of them , his unaffected devotion to them , the grateful confidence with which I knew he had inspired my darling , and the comfort he was to her ; could I separate all this from his promise to me ? How thankless I must have been if it had not recalled the words he said to me when he was so moved by the change in my appearance : “
396875	396884	396885	396886	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” We now turned into another narrow street . “
396888	396903	396885	396886	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” said Mr. Bucket , who had eyed him closely as we came along , “
396931	396944	396929	396929	you	440	” He was so quick that he saw it in an instant . “
396962	396963	396966	396966	sir	9496	” “
396968	396973	396966	396966	sir	9496	” said Mr. Bucket . “
397003	397039	397001	397001	him	8765	” The last police - officer with whom he had conferred was standing silently behind us . I was not aware of it until he struck in on my saying I heard some one crying . “
397047	397051	397052	397052	It	8768	” he returned . “
397058	397059	397052	397052	It	8768	” “
397065	397070	397071	397072	the girl	10247	” said Mr. Bucket , “
397114	397115	397096	397096	I	0	” “
397136	397142	397133	397134	Mr. Bucket	668	” said the other man . “
397155	397156	397143	397143	She	10247	” “
397163	397167	397143	397143	She	10247	” he returned . “
397179	397246	397175	397175	yours	440	” All this passed in a whisper a door or two from the house in which I could faintly hear crying and moaning . In the little round of light produced for the purpose , Mr. Bucket went up to the door and knocked . The door was opened after he had knocked twice , and he went in , leaving us standing in the street . “
397250	397255	397175	397175	yours	440	” said Mr. Woodcourt , “
397275	397276	397271	397271	me	0	” “
397282	397286	397277	397277	You	0	” I answered . “
397310	397311	397312	397312	I	0	” “
397334	397335	397336	397336	I	0	” “
397342	397346	397336	397336	I	0	” I said . “
397359	397386	397356	397356	your	0	” After a short time the little round of light shone out again , and Mr. Bucket advanced towards us in it with his earnest face . “
397395	397399	397392	397393	Miss Summerson	280	” he said , “
397484	397542	397546	397546	you	440	” We all three went into the house together ; although it was cold and raw , it smelt close too from being up all night . In the passage behind the door stood a scared , sorrowful - looking little man in a grey coat who seemed to have a naturally polite manner and spoke meekly . “
397552	397556	397549	397550	Mr. Bucket	668	” said he . “
397600	397646	397585	397585	she	1180	” We went downstairs , followed by Mr. Snagsby , as I soon found the little man to be . In the front kitchen , sitting by the fire , was Mrs. Snagsby , with very red eyes and a very severe expression of face . “
397651	397660	397585	397585	she	1180	” said Mr. Snagsby , entering behind us , “
397702	397723	397724	397724	My	0	” She looked very much astonished , as she had reason for doing , and looked particularly hard at me . “
397728	397751	397724	397724	My	0	” said Mr. Snagsby , sitting down in the remotest corner by the door , as if he were taking a liberty , “
397821	397858	397814	397814	I	0	” He appeared so miserable , sitting with his head upon his hand , and I appeared so unwelcome , that I was going to offer an apology when Mr. Bucket took the matter on himself . “
397864	397868	397905	397905	sir	9496	” said he , “
397888	397889	397890	397891	My Guster	8791	” “
397896	397901	397905	397905	sir	9496	” cried Mr. Snagsby . “
397918	397919	397910	397910	I	0	” “
397926	397934	397937	397937	her	8793	” pursued Mr. Bucket without correcting himself , “
398024	398064	397993	397993	you	440	” As they went out , Mr. Bucket made me sit down in a corner by the fire and take off my wet shoes , which he turned up to dry upon the fender , talking all the time . “
398131	398160	398120	398120	I	0	” Here , standing on the hearth with his wet hat and shawls in his hand , himself a pile of wet , he turned to Mrs. Snagsby . “
398245	398264	398267	398268	Mr. Bucket	668	” Mrs. Snagsby looked rather alarmed , relented a little and faltered , what did Mr. Bucket mean . “
398271	398313	398267	398268	Mr. Bucket	668	” he repeated , and I saw by his face that all the time he talked he was listening for the discovery of the letter , to my own great agitation , for I knew then how important it must be ; “
398337	398344	398319	398319	he	668	” Mrs. Snagsby consciously asked why . “
398347	398352	398319	398319	he	668	” said Mr. Bucket . “
398474	398490	398470	398472	that young lady	15667	” Mrs. Snagsby appeared to understand the reference better than I did at the time . “
398643	398657	398632	398633	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” Mrs. Snagsby shook her head and put her handkerchief to her eyes . “
398662	398668	398632	398633	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” said Mr. Bucket excitedly . “
398803	398848	398784	398784	she	8821	” He so thoroughly meant what he said now that I involuntarily clasped my hands and felt the room turning away from me . But it stopped . Mr. Woodcourt came in , put a paper into his hand , and went away again . “
398861	398871	398851	398852	Mrs. Snagsby	364	” said Mr. Bucket , rapidly glancing at it , “
398930	398945	398925	398925	your	362	” In an instant she was gone , and he had shut the door . “
398959	398960	398950	398950	you	362	” “
398963	398966	398950	398950	you	362	” said I. “
398972	399012	399013	399013	You	362	” It was my mother ’s . A pencil - writing , on a crushed and torn piece of paper , blotted with wet . Folded roughly like a letter , and directed to me at my guardian ’s . “
399018	399022	399013	399013	You	362	” he said , “
399044	399169	399171	399171	I	0	” It had been written in portions , at different times . I read what follows : I came to the cottage with two objects . First , to see the dear one , if I could , once more — but only to see her — not to speak to her or let her know that I was near . The other object , to elude pursuit and to be lost . Do not blame the mother for her share . The assistance that she rendered me , she rendered on my strongest assurance that it was for the dear one ’s good . You remember her dead child . The men ’s consent I bought , but her help was freely given . “
399179	399184	399171	399171	I	0	” said my companion , “
399203	399318	399199	399199	I	0	” The next was written at another time : I have wandered a long distance , and for many hours , and I know that I must soon die . These streets ! I have no purpose but to die . When I left , I had a worse , but I am saved from adding that guilt to the rest . Cold , wet , and fatigue are sufficient causes for my being found dead , but I shall die of others , though I suffer from these . It was right that all that had sustained me should give way at once and that I should die of terror and my conscience . “
399322	399327	399199	399199	I	0	” said Mr. Bucket . “
399336	399441	399199	399199	I	0	” Those , too , were written at another time . To all appearance , almost in the dark : I have done all I could do to be lost . I shall be soon forgotten so , and shall disgrace him least . I have nothing about me by which I can be recognized . This paper I part with now . The place where I shall lie down , if I can get so far , has been often in my mind . Farewell . Forgive . Mr. Bucket , supporting me with his arm , lowered me gently into my chair . “
399475	399735	399736	399736	My	0	” I did as he required , but I was left there a long time , praying for my unhappy mother . They were all occupied with the poor girl , and I heard Mr. Woodcourt directing them and speaking to her often . At length he came in with Mr. Bucket and said that as it was important to address her gently , he thought it best that I should ask her for whatever information we desired to obtain . There was no doubt that she could now reply to questions if she were soothed and not alarmed . The questions , Mr. Bucket said , were how she came by the letter , what passed between her and the person who gave her the letter , and where the person went . Holding my mind as steadily as I could to these points , I went into the next room with them . Mr. Woodcourt would have remained outside , but at my solicitation went in with us . The poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid her down . They stood around her , though at a little distance , that she might have air . She was not pretty and looked weak and poor , but she had a plaintive and a good face , though it was still a little wild . I kneeled on the ground beside her and put her poor head upon my shoulder , whereupon she drew her arm round my neck and burst into tears . “
399740	399761	399736	399736	My	0	” said I , laying my face against her forehead , for indeed I was crying too , and trembling , “
399789	399812	399813	399813	We	8834	” She began piteously declaring that she did n’t mean any harm , she did n’t mean any harm , Mrs. Snagsby ! “
399820	399823	399813	399813	We	8834	” said I. “
399833	399834	399829	399829	you	5067	” “
399858	399859	399855	399856	Mrs. Snagsby	364	” “
399866	399869	399860	399860	I	0	” said I. “
399875	399876	399877	399877	I	0	” “
400014	400048	400000	400000	I	0	” It was necessary for her mistress to comfort her — which she did , I must say , with a good deal of contrition — before she could be got beyond this . “
400056	400059	400049	400049	She	8838	” said I. “
400062	400071	400049	400049	She	8838	” cried the girl , shaking her head . “
400117	400118	400105	400105	you	364	” “
400126	400138	400121	400121	Guster	365	” said he , at first not knowing what to say . “
400144	400145	400148	400148	she	8838	” “
400154	400167	400148	400148	she	8838	” said the girl , looking at me with wide open eyes , “
400261	400294	400232	400232	she	8838	” As I watched her face and soothed her to go on , I saw that Mr. Bucket received this with a look which I could not separate from one of alarm . “
400301	400314	400232	400232	she	8838	” cried the girl , pressing her hair back with her hands . “
400372	400373	400374	400374	You	1110	” “
400381	400384	400374	400374	You	1110	” sald I. “
400392	400393	400395	400395	I	0	” “
400423	400431	400417	400417	I	0	” Angry with her , poor soul ! “
400608	400609	400599	400599	she	364	” “
400615	400616	400599	400599	she	364	” “
400619	400628	400599	400599	she	364	” cried the girl , anticipating the inquiry . “
400664	400695	400646	400647	Mrs. Snagsby	364	” Mr. Woodcourt took her kindly from me . Mr. Bucket wrapped me up , and immediately we were in the street . Mr. Woodcourt hesitated , but I said , “
400702	400708	400709	400709	You	0	” and Mr. Bucket added , “
400726	401107	401108	401109	Miss Summerson	280	” I have the most confused impressions of that walk . I recollect that it was neither night nor day , that morning was dawning but the street - lamps were not yet put out , that the sleet was still falling and that all the ways were deep with it . I recollect a few chilled people passing in the streets . I recollect the wet house - tops , the clogged and bursting gutters and water - spouts , the mounds of blackened ice and snow over which we passed , the narrowness of the courts by which we went . At the same time I remember that the poor girl seemed to be yet telling her story audibly and plainly in my hearing , that I could feel her resting on my arm , that the stained house - fronts put on human shapes and looked at me , that great water - gates seemed to be opening and closing in my head or in the air , and that the unreal things were more substantial than the real . At last we stood under a dark and miserable covered way , where one lamp was burning over an iron gate and where the morning faintly struggled in . The gate was closed . Beyond it was a burial ground — a dreadful spot in which the night was very slowly stirring , but where I could dimly see heaps of dishonoured graves and stones , hemmed in by filthy houses with a few dull lights in their windows and on whose walls a thick humidity broke out like a disease . On the step at the gate , drenched in the fearful wet of such a place , which oozed and splashed down everywhere , I saw , with a cry of pity and horror , a woman lying — Jenny , the mother of the dead child . I ran forward , but they stopped me , and Mr. Woodcourt entreated me with the greatest earnestness , even with tears , before I went up to the figure to listen for an instant to what Mr. Bucket said . I did so , as I thought . I did so , as I am sure . “
401129	401167	401122	401122	They	8861	” They changed clothes at the cottage . I could repeat the words in my mind , and I knew what they meant of themselves , but I attached no meaning to them in any other connexion . “
401172	401177	401179	401179	one	1501	” said Mr. Bucket , “
401212	401445	401447	401447	she	8867	” I could repeat this in my mind too , but I had not the least idea what it meant . I saw before me , lying on the step , the mother of the dead child . She lay there with one arm creeping round a bar of the iron gate and seeming to embrace it . She lay there , who had so lately spoken to my mother . She lay there , a distressed , unsheltered , senseless creature . She who had brought my mother ’s letter , who could give me the only clue to where my mother was ; she , who was to guide us to rescue and save her whom we had sought so far , who had come to this condition by some means connected with my mother that I could not follow , and might be passing beyond our reach and help at that moment ; she lay there , and they stopped me ! I saw but did not comprehend the solemn and compassionate look in Mr. Woodcourt ’s face . I saw but did not comprehend his touching the other on the breast to keep him back . I saw him stand uncovered in the bitter air , with a reverence for something . But my understanding for all this was gone . I even heard it said between them , “
401450	401451	401452	401452	She	8867	” “
401475	401696	401467	401467	They	8868	” I passed on to the gate and stooped down . I lifted the heavy head , put the long dank hair aside , and turned the face . And it was my mother , cold and dead . CHAPTER LX Perspective I proceed to other passages of my narrative . From the goodness of all about me I derived such consolation as I can never think of unmoved . I have already said so much of myself , and so much still remains , that I will not dwell upon my sorrow . I had an illness , but it was not a long one ; and I would avoid even this mention of it if I could quite keep down the recollection of their sympathy . I proceed to other passages of my narrative . During the time of my illness , we were still in London , where Mrs. Woodcourt had come , on my guardian ’s invitation , to stay with us . When my guardian thought me well and cheerful enough to talk with him in our old way — though I could have done that sooner if he would have believed me — I resumed my work and my chair beside his . He had appointed the time himself , and we were alone . “
401700	401710	401467	401467	They	8868	” said he , receiving me with a kiss , “
401763	401764	401717	401717	my	0	” “
401773	401776	401779	401780	my dear	9540	” said I. “
401785	401789	401846	401846	itself	27	” he returned , “
401798	401823	401854	401854	Ada	290	” I thought his tone sounded sorrowful , but looking at him , I saw his kind face lighted up by its pleasantest smile . “
401827	401840	401854	401854	Ada	290	” he repeated — and his tone did NOT sound sorrowful , I found—“must
401868	401869	401860	401860	Ada	290	” “
401877	401881	401873	401873	you	0	” said I , “
401898	401899	401873	401873	you	0	” “
401973	401974	401970	401971	poor fellow	2855	” “
401986	401987	401976	401976	you	0	” “
401998	401999	401995	401996	Dame Durden	343	” “
402009	402010	402001	402001	he	440	” “
402049	402177	402038	402038	he	440	” My dear girl had been to see us lately every day , some times twice in a day . But we had foreseen , all along , that this would only last until I was quite myself . We knew full well that her fervent heart was as full of affection and gratitude towards her cousin John as it had ever been , and we acquitted Richard of laying any injunctions upon her to stay away ; but we knew on the other hand that she felt it a part of her duty to him to be sparing of her visits at our house . My guardian ’s delicacy had soon perceived this and had tried to convey to her that he thought she was right . “
402185	402188	402178	402178	Dear	1110	” said I. “
402197	402198	402178	402178	Dear	1110	” “
402213	402218	402199	402199	He	8885	” replied my guardian . “
402247	402254	402227	402227	he	8885	” I could not help adding , “
402258	402259	402227	402227	he	8885	” “
402268	402273	402265	402266	Dame Trot	8888	” returned my guardian , “
402352	402378	402333	402333	He	317	” His gentleness and consideration for Richard whenever we spoke of him touched me so that I was always silent on this subject very soon . “
402413	402418	402408	402411	one of their suitors	8894	” pursued my guardian . “
402446	402471	402438	402438	I	0	” He checked himself in glancing towards the window to look where the wind was and leaned on the back of my chair instead . “
402585	402608	402610	402610	he	8902	” But I had already discussed it with him , I confessed ; and so , I thought , had Mr. Woodcourt . “
402614	402619	402610	402610	he	8902	” returned my guardian . “
402663	402694	402656	402656	you	9540	” In answer to this question , which was oddly abrupt , I said I liked her very much and thought she was more agreeable than she used to be . “
402700	402705	402656	402656	you	9540	” said my guardian . “
402721	402748	402713	402714	Morgan ap	461	” That was what I meant , I acknowledged , though he was a very harmless person , even when we had had more of him . “
402764	402769	402770	402770	I	0	” said my guardian . “
402793	402874	402788	402790	retain Mrs. Woodcourt	465	” No . And yet — My guardian looked at me , waiting for what I had to say . I had nothing to say . At least I had nothing in my mind that I could say . I had an undefined impression that it might have been better if we had had some other inmate , but I could hardly have explained why even to myself . Or , if to myself , certainly not to anybody else . “
402878	402883	402788	402790	retain Mrs. Woodcourt	465	” said my guardian , “
402924	402969	402914	402914	she	465	” Yes . That was undeniable . I had nothing to say against it . I could not have suggested a better arrangement , but I was not quite easy in my mind . Esther , Esther , why not ? Esther , think ! “
402988	402989	402992	402993	little woman	2039	” “
402995	403024	402992	402993	little woman	2039	” Quite sure . I had had a moment ’s time to think , since I had urged that duty on myself , and I was quite sure . “
403027	403032	402992	402993	little woman	2039	” said my guardian . “
403041	403042	403043	403044	Carried unanimously	8917	” “
403046	403134	403043	403044	Carried unanimously	8917	” I repeated , going on with my work . It was a cover for his book - table that I happened to be ornamenting . It had been laid by on the night preceding my sad journey and never resumed . I showed it to him now , and he admired it highly . After I had explained the pattern to him and all the great effects that were to come out by and by , I thought I would go back to our last theme . “
403172	403173	403166	403166	you	8918	” “
403182	403183	403176	403177	little woman	2039	” “
403191	403192	403193	403193	I	0	” “
403198	403199	403193	403193	I	0	” “
403210	403213	403193	403193	I	0	” said I. “
403220	403234	403193	403193	I	0	” returned my guardian , beginning his answer in a very deliberate manner . “
403395	403396	403391	403391	Woodcourt	440	” “
403404	403408	403399	403399	he	440	” I asked . “
403414	403421	403424	403425	an oracle	8938	” returned my guardian , smiling , “
403524	403525	403526	403530	The poor of that place	8944	” “
403547	403548	403545	403545	guardian	10146	” “
403563	404088	404089	404090	My dear	9540	” We said no more about it , nor did he say a word about the future of Bleak House . But it was the first time I had taken my seat at his side in my mourning dress , and that accounted for it , I considered . I now began to visit my dear girl every day in the dull dark corner where she lived . The morning was my usual time , but whenever I found I had an hour or so to spare , I put on my bonnet and bustled off to Chancery Lane . They were both so glad to see me at all hours , and used to brighten up so when they heard me opening the door and coming in ( being quite at home , I never knocked ) , that I had no fear of becoming troublesome just yet . On these occasions I frequently found Richard absent . At other times he would be writing or reading papers in the cause at that table of his , so covered with papers , which was never disturbed . Sometimes I would come upon him lingering at the door of Mr. Vholes ’s office . Sometimes I would meet him in the neighbourhood lounging about and biting his nails . I often met him wandering in Lincoln ’s Inn , near the place where I had first seen him , oh how different , how different ! That the money Ada brought him was melting away with the candles I used to see burning after dark in Mr. Vholes ’s office I knew very well . It was not a large amount in the beginning , he had married in debt , and I could not fail to understand , by this time , what was meant by Mr. Vholes ’s shoulder being at the wheel — as I still heard it was . My dear made the best of housekeepers and tried hard to save , but I knew that they were getting poorer and poorer every day . She shone in the miserable corner like a beautiful star . She adorned and graced it so that it became another place . Paler than she had been at home , and a little quieter than I had thought natural when she was yet so cheerful and hopeful , her face was so unshadowed that I half believed she was blinded by her love for Richard to his ruinous career . I went one day to dine with them while I was under this impression . As I turned into Symond ’s Inn , I met little Miss Flite coming out . She had been to make a stately call upon the wards in Jarndyce , as she still called them , and had derived the highest gratification from that ceremony . Ada had already told me that she called every Monday at five o’clock , with one little extra white bow in her bonnet , which never appeared there at any other time , and with her largest reticule of documents on her arm . “
404092	404096	404089	404090	My dear	9540	” she began . “
404143	404144	404126	404126	Our	8949	” “
404153	404156	404146	404146	Richard	291	” said I. “
404173	404174	404164	404164	I	0	” “
404183	404188	404177	404177	he	8953	” returned Miss Flite . “
404223	404224	404225	404225	I	0	” “
404236	404239	404228	404228	you	9540	” said I. “
404243	404248	404228	404228	you	9540	” returned Miss Flite , “
404303	404322	404283	404283	He	8956	” It was miserable to hear this from her poor mad lips , though it was no surprise . “
404330	404350	404283	404283	He	8956	” pursued Miss Flite , advancing her lips to my ear with an air of equal patronage and mystery , “
404381	404382	404377	404377	Ye	9540	” “
404385	404388	404389	404389	Ye	9540	” said I. “
404393	404403	404389	404389	Ye	9540	” repeated Miss Flite in her most genteel accents , “
404448	404458	404459	404459	I	0	” It made me sigh to think of him . “
404466	404475	404459	404459	I	0	” said Miss Flite , echoing the sigh , “
404526	404552	404572	404573	Miss Flite	376	” She carefully opened her reticule a little way and showed me a folded piece of paper inside as the appointment of which she spoke . “
404568	404569	404559	404559	I	0	” “
404575	404608	404572	404573	Miss Flite	376	” said I , knowing how it pleased her to have her confidence received with an appearance of interest . She nodded several times , and her face became overcast and gloomy . “
404681	404840	404845	404846	Miss Summerson	280	” The poor soul kissed me with the most troubled look I had ever seen in her and went her way . Her manner of running over the names of her birds , as if she were afraid of hearing them even from her own lips , quite chilled me . This was not a cheering preparation for my visit , and I could have dispensed with the company of Mr. Vholes , when Richard ( who arrived within a minute or two after me ) brought him to share our dinner . Although it was a very plain one , Ada and Richard were for some minutes both out of the room together helping to get ready what we were to eat and drink . Mr. Vholes took that opportunity of holding a little conversation in a low voice with me . He came to the window where I was sitting and began upon Symond ’s Inn . “
404858	404877	404845	404846	Miss Summerson	280	” said Mr. Vholes , smearing the glass with his black glove to make it clearer for me . “
404886	404889	404845	404846	Miss Summerson	280	” said I. “
404896	404901	404894	404894	miss	9584	” returned Mr. Vholes . “
404937	404949	404950	404950	I	0	” I thanked Mr. Vholes and said he was quite well . “
404966	404971	404950	404950	I	0	” said Mr. Vholes , “
405039	405040	405032	405033	Mr. C.	614	” “
405049	405050	405041	405041	He	286	” “
405054	405108	405041	405041	He	286	” said Mr. Vholes . He stood behind me with his long black figure reaching nearly to the ceiling of those low rooms , feeling the pimples on his face as if they were ornaments and speaking inwardly and evenly as though there were not a human passion or emotion in his nature . “
405121	405125	405115	405116	Mr. C.	614	” he resumed . “
405133	405137	405126	405127	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” I answered . “
405148	405149	405126	405127	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” “
405159	405162	405126	405127	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” said I. “
405166	405206	405207	405208	Miss Summerson	280	” said Mr. Vholes . So slow , so eager , so bloodless and gaunt , I felt as if Richard were wasting away beneath the eyes of this adviser and there were something of the vampire in him . “
405210	405245	405207	405208	Miss Summerson	280	” said Mr. Vholes , very slowly rubbing his gloved hands , as if , to his cold sense of touch , they were much the same in black kid or out of it , “
405258	405316	405254	405255	Mr. C.	614	” I begged he would excuse me from discussing it . They had been engaged when they were both very young , I told him ( a little indignantly ) and when the prospect before them was much fairer and brighter . When Richard had not yielded himself to the unhappy influence which now darkened his life . “
405320	405326	405254	405255	Mr. C.	614	” assented Mr. Vholes again . “
405444	405445	405426	405426	I	0	” “
405468	405472	405465	405466	Mr. Vholes	245	” said I , “
405493	405526	405527	405528	Miss Summerson	280	” Mr. Vholes , with a noiseless cough — or rather gasp — into one of his black gloves , inclined his head as if he did not wholly dispute even that . “
405530	405534	405527	405528	Miss Summerson	280	” he said , “
405715	405716	405707	405708	Mr. C.	614	” “
405725	405726	405722	405723	Mr. Vholes	245	” “
405730	405746	405722	405723	Mr. Vholes	245	” returned Mr. Vholes , going on in exactly the same inward and dispassionate manner . “
406044	406434	406038	406038	you	9496	” He broke off thus in answer to Richard , who addressed him as he came into the room . By this time I too well understood Mr. Vholes ’s scrupulous way of saving himself and his respectability not to feel that our worst fears did but keep pace with his client ’s progress . We sat down to dinner , and I had an opportunity of observing Richard , anxiously . I was not disturbed by Mr. Vholes ( who took off his gloves to dine ) , though he sat opposite to me at the small table , for I doubt if , looking up at all , he once removed his eyes from his host ’s face . I found Richard thin and languid , slovenly in his dress , abstracted in his manner , forcing his spirits now and then , and at other intervals relapsing into a dull thoughtfulness . About his large bright eyes that used to be so merry there was a wanness and a restlessness that changed them altogether . I can not use the expression that he looked old . There is a ruin of youth which is not like age , and into such a ruin Richard ’s youth and youthful beauty had all fallen away . He ate little and seemed indifferent what it was , showed himself to be much more impatient than he used to be , and was quick even with Ada . I thought at first that his old light - hearted manner was all gone , but it shone out of him sometimes as I had occasionally known little momentary glimpses of my own old face to look out upon me from the glass . His laugh had not quite left him either , but it was like the echo of a joyful sound , and that is always sorrowful . Yet he was as glad as ever , in his old affectionate way , to have me there , and we talked of the old times pleasantly . These did not appear to be interesting to Mr. Vholes , though he occasionally made a gasp which I believe was his smile . He rose shortly after dinner and said that with the permission of the ladies he would retire to his office . “
406442	406446	406440	406440	Vholes	245	” cried Richard . “
406452	406456	406449	406450	Mr. C.	614	” he returned , “
406521	406858	406519	406520	Mr. C.	614	” Richard expressed himself quite sure of that and lighted Mr. Vholes out . On his return he told us , more than once , that Vholes was a good fellow , a safe fellow , a man who did what he pretended to do , a very good fellow indeed ! He was so defiant about it that it struck me he had begun to doubt Mr. Vholes . Then he threw himself on the sofa , tired out ; and Ada and I put things to rights , for they had no other servant than the woman who attended to the chambers . My dear girl had a cottage piano there and quietly sat down to sing some of Richard ’s favourites , the lamp being first removed into the next room , as he complained of its hurting his eyes . I sat between them , at my dear girl ’s side , and felt very melancholy listening to her sweet voice . I think Richard did too ; I think he darkened the room for that reason . She had been singing some time , rising between whiles to bend over him and speak to him , when Mr. Woodcourt came in . Then he sat down by Richard and half playfully , half earnestly , quite naturally and easily , found out how he felt and where he had been all day . Presently he proposed to accompany him in a short walk on one of the bridges , as it was a moonlight airy night ; and Richard readily consenting , they went out together . They left my dear girl still sitting at the piano and me still sitting beside her . When they were gone out , I drew my arm round her waist . She put her left hand in mine ( I was sitting on that side ) , but kept her right upon the keys , going over and over them without striking any note . “
406864	406871	406859	406859	Esther	280	” she said , breaking silence , “
406901	406953	406897	406897	you	280	” I pointed out to my darling how this could scarcely be , because Mr. Woodcourt had come to her cousin John ’s house and had known us all there , and because he had always liked Richard , and Richard had always liked him , and — and so forth . “
406957	406961	406897	406897	you	280	” said Ada , “
406977	407015	406964	406964	he	9014	” I thought it best to let my dear girl have her way and to say no more about it . So I said as much . I said it lightly , because I felt her trembling . “
407042	407088	407037	407037	You	280	” I teach ! I said no more , for I noticed the hand that was fluttering over the keys , and I knew that it was not I who ought to speak , that it was she who had something to say to me . “
407143	407144	407132	407132	I	0	” “
407154	407155	407148	407148	I	0	” “
407231	407270	407271	407271	You	280	” In the momentary firmness of the hand that was never still — a firmness inspired by the utterance of these last words , and dying away with them — I saw the confirmation of her earnest tones . “
407324	407355	407356	407356	I	0	” She spoke so modestly and softly and her trembling hand expressed such agitation as it moved to and fro upon the silent notes ! My dear , dear girl ! “
407464	407492	407454	407454	him	9020	” I felt her trembling more . I waited for what was yet to come , and I now thought I began to know what it was . “
407501	407518	407499	407499	Esther	280	” She stopped a minute . Stopped speaking only ; her hand was still in motion . “
407579	407599	407608	407608	Esther	280	” Her hand stopped now . She clasped me in her arms , and I clasped her in mine . “
407727	407746	407759	407759	they	9035	” Oh , my sweet girl , what a heart was that which beat so fast against me ! “
407780	407802	407775	407775	I	0	” I tried to cheer my darling , and asked her what it was . Sobbing and weeping , she replied , “
407813	408237	408238	408238	My	0	” CHAPTER LXI A Discovery The days when I frequented that miserable corner which my dear girl brightened can never fade in my remembrance . I never see it , and I never wish to see it now ; I have been there only once since , but in my memory there is a mournful glory shining on the place which will shine for ever . Not a day passed without my going there , of course . At first I found Mr. Skimpole there , on two or three occasions , idly playing the piano and talking in his usual vivacious strain . Now , besides my very much mistrusting the probability of his being there without making Richard poorer , I felt as if there were something in his careless gaiety too inconsistent with what I knew of the depths of Ada ’s life . I clearly perceived , too , that Ada shared my feelings . I therefore resolved , after much thinking of it , to make a private visit to Mr. Skimpole and try delicately to explain myself . My dear girl was the great consideration that made me bold . I set off one morning , accompanied by Charley , for Somers Town . As I approached the house , I was strongly inclined to turn back , for I felt what a desperate attempt it was to make an impression on Mr. Skimpole and how extremely likely it was that he would signally defeat me . However , I thought that being there , I would go through with it . I knocked with a trembling hand at Mr. Skimpole ’s door — literally with a hand , for the knocker was gone — and after a long parley gained admission from an Irishwoman , who was in the area when I knocked , breaking up the lid of a water - butt with a poker to light the fire with . Mr. Skimpole , lying on the sofa in his room , playing the flute a little , was enchanted to see me . Now , who should receive me , he asked . Who would I prefer for mistress of the ceremonies ? Would I have his Comedy daughter , his Beauty daughter , or his Sentiment daughter ? Or would I have all the daughters at once in a perfect nosegay ? I replied , half defeated already , that I wished to speak to himself only if he would give me leave . “
408249	408265	408238	408238	My	0	” he said , bringing his chair nearer mine and breaking into his fascinating smile , “
408278	408300	408305	408306	Miss Summerson	280	” I said it certainly was not business that I came upon , but it was not quite a pleasant matter . “
408308	408316	408305	408306	Miss Summerson	280	” said he with the frankest gaiety , “
408397	408417	408418	408418	I	0	” Although I was embarrassed , I took courage to intimate that I still wished to pursue the subject . “
408425	408434	408418	408418	I	0	” said Mr. Skimpole with his airy laugh , “
408450	408451	408452	408453	Mr. Skimpole	323	” “
408455	408465	408452	408453	Mr. Skimpole	323	” said I , raising my eyes to his , “
408484	408485	408474	408474	you	323	” “
408507	408514	408519	408519	them	9041	” said Mr. Skimpole , brightly . “
408521	408522	408519	408519	them	9041	” “
408527	408532	408533	408533	you	323	” I went on , “
408558	408559	408561	408561	me	0	” “
408563	408568	408561	408561	me	0	” said Mr. Skimpole . “
408577	408578	408573	408573	they	9041	” “
408585	408586	408573	408573	they	9041	” “
408592	408601	408573	408573	they	9041	” said Mr. Skimpole with a delighted countenance . “
408661	408691	408656	408656	you	323	” I was coming to the point with great difficulty when he took me by both hands and with a radiant face and in the liveliest way anticipated it . “
408896	408923	408890	408890	them	9050	” Through the beaming smile with which he regarded me as he reasoned thus , there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite astonishing . “
408926	408942	408890	408890	them	9050	” he said , pursuing his argument in his tone of light - hearted conviction , “
409068	409150	409151	409152	Mr. Skimpole	323	” He finished by genially kissing my hand and thanking me . Nothing but Miss Summerson ’s fine tact , he said , would have found this out for him . I was much disconcerted , but I reflected that if the main point were gained , it mattered little how strangely he perverted everything leading to it . I had determined to mention something else , however , and I thought I was not to be put off in that . “
409154	409158	409151	409152	Mr. Skimpole	323	” said I , “
409240	409241	409235	409235	I	0	” “
409252	409262	409249	409250	Miss Summerson	280	” he returned inquiringly , raising his pleasant eyebrows . “
409266	409298	409299	409299	You	280	” He thought about it for a little while with a highly agreeable and whimsical expression of face , then quite gave it up and said in his most engaging manner , “
409310	409374	409299	409299	You	280	” I was reluctant to enter minutely into that question , but as he begged I would , for he was really curious to know , I gave him to understand in the gentlest words I could use that his conduct seemed to involve a disregard of several moral obligations . He was much amused and interested when he heard this and said , “
409379	409384	409299	409299	You	280	” with ingenuous simplicity . “
409416	409421	409422	409422	I	0	” said Mr. Skimpole . “
409471	409481	409468	409468	you	280	” I incautiously gave a qualified assent to this . “
409488	409497	409485	409485	you	280	” said Mr. Skimpole , shaking his head , “
409505	409530	409531	409531	My	0	” I suggested , as I rose to go , that it was not right to betray my guardian ’s confidence for a bribe . “
409536	409549	409550	409550	I	0	” he returned with a candid hilarity that was all his own , “
409556	409557	409550	409550	I	0	” “
409563	409566	409560	409561	Mr. Bucket	668	” said I. “
409569	409573	409560	409561	Mr. Bucket	668	” said he . “
409626	409648	409622	409622	I	0	” I showed that I was of a different opinion , though I had not the capacity for arguing the question . “
409653	409658	409622	409622	I	0	” said Mr. Skimpole , “
409739	409780	409735	409735	Caesar	672	” Anything to equal the lightness of his manner and the playful impartiality with which he seemed to convince himself , as he tossed the matter about like a ball of feathers , was surely never seen in anybody else ! “
410250	410288	410247	410247	he	323	” I had nothing to offer in reply to this exposition and therefore took my leave . Mr. Skimpole , however , who was in excellent spirits , would not hear of my returning home attended only by “
410292	410497	410247	410247	he	323	” and accompanied me himself . He entertained me on the way with a variety of delightful conversation and assured me , at parting , that he should never forget the fine tact with which I had found that out for him about our young friends . As it so happened that I never saw Mr. Skimpole again , I may at once finish what I know of his history . A coolness arose between him and my guardian , based principally on the foregoing grounds and on his having heartlessly disregarded my guardian ’s entreaties ( as we afterwards learned from Ada ) in reference to Richard . His being heavily in my guardian ’s debt had nothing to do with their separation . He died some five years afterwards and left a diary behind him , with letters and other materials towards his life , which was published and which showed him to have been the victim of a combination on the part of mankind against an amiable child . It was considered very pleasant reading , but I never read more of it myself than the sentence on which I chanced to light on opening the book . It was this : “
410516	410767	410247	410247	he	323	” And now I come to a part of my story touching myself very nearly indeed , and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance occurred . Whatever little lingerings may have now and then revived in my mind associated with my poor old face had only revived as belonging to a part of my life that was gone — gone like my infancy or my childhood . I have suppressed none of my many weaknesses on that subject , but have written them as faithfully as my memory has recalled them . And I hope to do , and mean to do , the same down to the last words of these pages , which I see now not so very far before me . The months were gliding away , and my dear girl , sustained by the hopes she had confided in me , was the same beautiful star in the miserable corner . Richard , more worn and haggard , haunted the court day after day , listlessly sat there the whole day long when he knew there was no remote chance of the suit being mentioned , and became one of the stock sights of the place . I wonder whether any of the gentlemen remembered him as he was when he first went there . So completely was he absorbed in his fixed idea that he used to avow in his cheerful moments that he should never have breathed the fresh air now “
410772	411351	410770	410770	Woodcourt	440	” It was only Mr. Woodcourt who could occasionally divert his attention for a few hours at a time and rouse him , even when he sunk into a lethargy of mind and body that alarmed us greatly , and the returns of which became more frequent as the months went on . My dear girl was right in saying that he only pursued his errors the more desperately for her sake . I have no doubt that his desire to retrieve what he had lost was rendered the more intense by his grief for his young wife , and became like the madness of a gamester . I was there , as I have mentioned , at all hours . When I was there at night , I generally went home with Charley in a coach ; sometimes my guardian would meet me in the neighbourhood , and we would walk home together . One evening he had arranged to meet me at eight o’clock . I could not leave , as I usually did , quite punctually at the time , for I was working for my dear girl and had a few stitches more to do to finish what I was about ; but it was within a few minutes of the hour when I bundled up my little work - basket , gave my darling my last kiss for the night , and hurried downstairs . Mr. Woodcourt went with me , as it was dusk . When we came to the usual place of meeting — it was close by , and Mr. Woodcourt had often accompanied me before — my guardian was not there . We waited half an hour , walking up and down , but there were no signs of him . We agreed that he was either prevented from coming or that he had come and gone away , and Mr. Woodcourt proposed to walk home with me . It was the first walk we had ever taken together , except that very short one to the usual place of meeting . We spoke of Richard and Ada the whole way . I did not thank him in words for what he had done — my appreciation of it had risen above all words then — but I hoped he might not be without some understanding of what I felt so strongly . Arriving at home and going upstairs , we found that my guardian was out and that Mrs. Woodcourt was out too . We were in the very same room into which I had brought my blushing girl when her youthful lover , now her so altered husband , was the choice of her young heart , the very same room from which my guardian and I had watched them going away through the sunlight in the fresh bloom of their hope and promise . We were standing by the opened window looking down into the street when Mr. Woodcourt spoke to me . I learned in a moment that he loved me . I learned in a moment that my scarred face was all unchanged to him . I learned in a moment that what I had thought was pity and compassion was devoted , generous , faithful love . Oh , too late to know it now , too late , too late . That was the first ungrateful thought I had . Too late . “
411356	411361	411353	411353	I	0	” he told me , “
411401	411402	411405	411406	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” “
411412	411417	411405	411406	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” I entreated him . “
411437	411438	411426	411426	I	0	” “
411447	411451	411426	411426	I	0	” said he , “
411496	411497	411500	411501	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” “
411503	411507	411500	411501	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” cried I , “
411580	411691	411692	411692	I	0	” I said it with a stronger heart , for when he praised me thus and when I heard his voice thrill with his belief that what he said was true , I aspired to be more worthy of it . It was not too late for that . Although I closed this unforeseen page in my life to - night , I could be worthier of it all through my life . And it was a comfort to me , and an impulse to me , and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was derived from him when I thought so . He broke the silence . “
411714	411730	411733	411733	her	9101	now”—and the deep earnestness with which he said it at once strengthened me and made me weep—“if
411837	411890	411832	411832	I	0	” Something seemed to pass into my place that was like the angel he thought me , and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he had sustained ! I wished to help him in his trouble , as I had wished to do when he showed that first commiseration for me . “
411895	411899	411832	411832	I	0	” said I , “
411930	411952	411954	411954	I	0	” I had to think again of being more deserving of his love and his affliction before I could go on . “
412049	412073	412101	412101	you	692	” He covered his eyes with his hand and turned away his head . How could I ever be worthy of those tears ? “
412178	412200	412201	412201	I	0	” He took my hand and kissed it . He was like himself again , and I felt still more encouraged . “
412211	412215	412206	412206	you	692	” said I , “
412226	412227	412228	412228	I	0	” “
412231	412235	412228	412228	I	0	” he answered . “
412261	412262	412265	412265	him	286	” “
412269	412278	412265	412265	him	286	” said I , giving him my hand ; “
412288	412289	412290	412290	I	0	” “
412299	412303	412290	412290	I	0	” he answered ; “
412321	412322	412290	412290	I	0	” “
412327	412332	412290	412290	I	0	” I exclaimed involuntarily , “
412342	412343	412335	412335	he	286	” “
412367	412403	412358	412360	dear Miss Summerson	280	” One other thing I felt it needful to touch upon before he left me . I knew that I should not be worthier of the love I could not take if I reserved it . “
412407	412411	412358	412360	dear Miss Summerson	280	” said I , “
412454	412467	412469	412469	my	0	” It was indeed a glad hearing to him , he replied . “
412475	412479	412469	412469	my	0	” said I , “
412530	412531	412532	412532	I	0	” “
412537	412541	412532	412532	I	0	” he returned . “
412548	412549	412542	412542	You	0	” “
412556	412560	412550	412550	You	692	” said I , “
412652	412671	412630	412630	I	0	” He fervently replied that indeed indeed they would have been . I gave him my hand again . “
412675	412679	412630	412630	I	0	” I said , “
412684	412685	412630	412630	I	0	” “
412708	412709	412630	412630	I	0	” “
412712	412713	412630	412630	I	0	” “
412721	413100	412630	412630	I	0	” He left me , and I stood at the dark window watching the street . His love , in all its constancy and generosity , had come so suddenly upon me that he had not left me a minute when my fortitude gave way again and the street was blotted out by my rushing tears . But they were not tears of regret and sorrow . No . He had called me the beloved of his life and had said I would be evermore as dear to him as I was then , and I felt as if my heart would not hold the triumph of having heard those words . My first wild thought had died away . It was not too late to hear them , for it was not too late to be animated by them to be good , true , grateful , and contented . How easy my path , how much easier than his ! CHAPTER LXII Another Discovery I had not the courage to see any one that night . I had not even the courage to see myself , for I was afraid that my tears might a little reproach me . I went up to my room in the dark , and prayed in the dark , and lay down in the dark to sleep . I had no need of any light to read my guardian ’s letter by , for I knew it by heart . I took it from the place where I kept it , and repeated its contents by its own clear light of integrity and love , and went to sleep with it on my pillow . I was up very early in the morning and called Charley to come for a walk . We bought flowers for the breakfast - table , and came back and arranged them , and were as busy as possible . We were so early that I had a good time still for Charley ’s lesson before breakfast ; Charley ( who was not in the least improved in the old defective article of grammar ) came through it with great applause ; and we were altogether very notable . When my guardian appeared he said , “
413113	413209	413103	413104	little woman	2039	” And Mrs. Woodcourt repeated and translated a passage from the Mewlinnwillinwodd expressive of my being like a mountain with the sun upon it . This was all so pleasant that I hope it made me still more like the mountain than I had been before . After breakfast I waited my opportunity and peeped about a little until I saw my guardian in his own room — the room of last night — by himself . Then I made an excuse to go in with my housekeeping keys , shutting the door after me . “
413215	413233	413234	413234	You	343	” said my guardian ; the post had brought him several letters , and he was writing . “
413238	413239	413234	413234	You	343	” “
413250	413251	413244	413244	I	0	” “
413260	413265	413257	413258	Dame Durden	343	” said my guardian , “
413271	413323	413324	413324	He	9109	” He had laid down his pen and leaned back in his chair looking at me . I have often spoken of his bright face , but I thought I had never seen it look so bright and good . There was a high happiness upon it which made me think , “
413334	413335	413324	413324	He	9109	” “
413340	413352	413355	413356	Dame Durden	343	” said my guardian , musing as he smiled upon me , “
413362	413448	413355	413356	Dame Durden	343	” He had never yet altered his old manner . I loved it and him so much that when I now went up to him and took my usual chair , which was always put at his side — for sometimes I read to him , and sometimes I talked to him , and sometimes I silently worked by him — I hardly liked to disturb it by laying my hand on his breast . But I found I did not disturb it at all . “
413452	413456	413449	413450	Dear guardian	3270	” said I , “
413471	413472	413465	413465	I	0	” “
413480	413481	413465	413465	I	0	” “
413504	413505	413494	413494	I	0	” “
413517	413518	413519	413519	I	0	” “
413528	413532	413519	413519	I	0	” I returned . “
413555	413556	413550	413550	I	0	” “
413559	413592	413550	413550	I	0	” said my guardian , nodding his head . He had put his arm about me as if there were something to protect me from and looked in my face , smiling . “
413596	413600	413634	413634	I	0	” said I , “
413611	413612	413615	413615	I	0	” “
413631	413632	413634	413634	I	0	” “
413637	413643	413634	413634	I	0	” I timidly reminded him , “
413649	413669	413645	413646	its mistress	16187	” He still held me in the same protecting manner and with the same bright goodness in his face . “
413673	413677	413670	413671	Dear guardian	3270	” said I , “
413745	413746	413733	413733	I	0	” “
413749	413754	413733	413733	I	0	” he returned gaily , “
413807	413808	413810	413810	you	3270	” “
413813	413814	413810	413810	you	3270	” “
413818	413819	413810	413810	you	3270	” “
413826	413827	413823	413824	dear guardian	3270	” “
413883	413941	413942	413943	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” said my guardian . I put my arms round his neck and kissed him just as I had done on the day when I brought my answer . A servant came to the door to announce Mr. Bucket , which was quite unnecessary , for Mr. Bucket was already looking in over the servant ’s shoulder . “
413948	413957	413942	413943	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” said he , rather out of breath , “
414015	414079	414013	414013	you	9129	” said Mr. Bucket , beckoning over the banisters . This singular request produced an old man in a black skull - cap , unable to walk , who was carried up by a couple of bearers and deposited in the room near the door . Mr. Bucket immediately got rid of the bearers , mysteriously shut the door , and bolted it . “
414087	414110	414111	414111	you	9129	” he then began , putting down his hat and opening his subject with a flourish of his well - remembered finger , “
414167	414209	414157	414157	YOU	9129	” said Mr. Bucket , stopping a little to address the gentleman in question , who was exceedingly suspicious of him . He seemed about to dispute this designation of himself when he was seized with a violent fit of coughing . “
414217	414226	414157	414157	YOU	9129	” said Mr. Bucket , improving the accident . “
414325	414330	414351	414351	he	3062	” My guardian replied , “
414333	414334	414351	414351	he	3062	” “
414342	414347	414337	414337	You	9129	” said Mr. Bucket , “
414388	414479	414378	414378	Lord	9143	” The cunning of Mr. Bucket ’s eye and the masterly manner in which he contrived , without a look or a word against which his watchful auditor could protest , to let us know that he stated the case according to previous agreement and could say much more of Mr. Smallweed if he thought it advisable , deprived us of any merit in quite understanding him . His difficulty was increased by Mr. Smallweed ’s being deaf as well as suspicious and watching his face with the closest attention . “
414508	414513	414492	414492	he	3062	” said Mr. Bucket . “
414521	414532	414571	414571	you	9129	” cried Mr. Smallweed in a shrill , sharp voice . “
414536	414541	414571	414571	you	9129	” repeated Mr. Bucket . “
414573	414574	414571	414571	you	9129	” “
414580	414585	414577	414577	I	0	” cried Mr. Smallweed . “
414591	414597	414588	414588	you	9129	” said Mr. Bucket conversationally , “
414620	414643	414612	414612	you	9129	” Mr. Bucket went on , stooping over him with an air of cheerful raillery which Mr. Smallweed by no means reciprocated , “
414668	414683	414666	414666	you	9129	” Mr. Smallweed glanced with a troubled eye at us and grudgingly nodded assent . “
414737	414773	414776	414776	you	9129	” said Mr. Bucket with the same lively air of recalling a joke for the enjoyment of Mr. Smallweed , who still had the same crest - fallen appearance of not enjoying it at all ; “
414785	414786	414776	414776	you	9129	” “
414803	414868	414787	414787	I	0	” snarled Mr. Smallweed . Mr. Bucket eyed the old man for a moment — he had slipped and shrunk down in his chair into a mere bundle — as if he were much disposed to pounce upon him ; nevertheless , he continued to bend over him with the same agreeable air , keeping the corner of one of his eyes upon us . “
414872	414877	414878	414878	you	9129	” said Mr. Bucket , “
414900	414901	414897	414897	your	9129	” “
414915	414926	414906	414906	you	9129	” asked Mr. Smallweed with his hand to his ear . “
414932	414933	414906	414906	you	9129	” “
414941	414946	414906	414906	you	9129	” said Mr. Smallweed . “
415049	415050	415055	415055	you	9129	” “
415061	415074	415080	415080	your	9129	” cried the old man anxiously with his hand at his ear . “
415104	415135	415096	415096	Lord	9149	” Mr. Bucket had certainly picked him up at a dart . However , as soon as he could be heard through Mr. Smallweed ’s coughing and his vicious ejaculations of “
415167	415179	415153	415153	I	0	” Mr. Bucket proceeded in the same convivial manner as before . “
415207	415269	415196	415196	you	9129	” I think it would be impossible to make an admission with more ill will and a worse grace than Mr. Smallweed displayed when he admitted this , rendering it perfectly evident that Mr. Bucket was the very last person he would have thought of taking into his confidence if he could by any possibility have kept him out of it . “
415317	415323	415326	415326	you	9129	” said Mr. Bucket emphatically ; “
415374	415375	415326	415326	you	9129	” “
415382	415392	415326	415326	you	9129	” Mr. Smallweed assented with the same bad grace . “
415398	415417	415326	415326	you	9129	” said Mr. Bucket , dismissing his agreeable manner all at once and becoming strictly business - like , “
415448	415632	415639	415639	their	9154	” Having given us one glance out of the watching corner of his eye , and having given his nose one triumphant rub with his forefinger , Mr. Bucket stood with his eyes fastened on his confidential friend and his hand stretched forth ready to take the paper and present it to my guardian . It was not produced without much reluctance and many declarations on the part of Mr. Smallweed that he was a poor industrious man and that he left it to Mr. Jarndyce ’s honour not to let him lose by his honesty . Little by little he very slowly took from a breast - pocket a stained , discoloured paper which was much singed upon the outside and a little burnt at the edges , as if it had long ago been thrown upon a fire and hastily snatched off again . Mr. Bucket lost no time in transferring this paper , with the dexterity of a conjuror , from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Jarndyce . As he gave it to my guardian , he whispered behind his fingers , “
415731	415732	415733	415734	Mr Bucket	668	” “
415736	415742	415733	415734	Mr Bucket	668	” said my guardian aloud , “
415781	415782	415776	415777	Mr. Smallweed	475	” “
415792	415803	415776	415777	Mr. Smallweed	475	” said Mr. Bucket in friendly explanation to Mr. Smallweed . “
415817	415818	415776	415777	Mr. Smallweed	475	” “
415825	415830	415822	415822	I	0	” said my guardian . “
415907	415908	415909	415910	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” “
415921	415931	415909	415910	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” observed Mr. Bucket to his fellow - visitor . “
415972	416102	416103	416103	I	0	” He unbolted the door , called in the bearers , wished us good morning , and with a look full of meaning and a crook of his finger at parting went his way . We went our way too , which was to Lincoln ’s Inn , as quickly as possible . Mr. Kenge was disengaged , and we found him at his table in his dusty room with the inexpressive - looking books and the piles of papers . Chairs having been placed for us by Mr. Guppy , Mr. Kenge expressed the surprise and gratification he felt at the unusual sight of Mr. Jarndyce in his office . He turned over his double eye - glass as he spoke and was more Conversation Kenge than ever . “
416106	416111	416103	416103	I	0	” said Mr. Kenge , “
416120	416126	416117	416118	Miss Summerson	280	” he bowed to me , “
416133	416139	416158	416158	I	0	” he bowed to him , “
416176	416177	416158	416158	I	0	” “
416184	416189	416178	416178	I	0	” returned my guardian , “
416257	416265	416246	416246	me	0	” He did so shortly and distinctly . “
416272	416277	416246	416246	me	0	” said Mr. Kenge , “
416296	416297	416299	416299	you	283	” “
416315	416320	416299	416299	you	283	” said my guardian . “
416325	416375	416299	416299	you	283	” said Mr. Kenge . At first he had not seemed to attach much importance to the paper , but when he saw it he appeared more interested , and when he had opened and read a little of it through his eye - glass , he became amazed . “
416379	416387	416299	416299	you	283	” he said , looking off it , “
416393	416394	416396	416396	I	0	” “
416398	416403	416396	416396	I	0	” returned my guardian . “
416410	416415	416396	416396	I	0	” said Mr. Kenge , “
416482	416483	416515	416515	your	297	” “
416486	416491	416515	416515	your	297	” said my guardian . “
416498	416499	416500	416501	Mr. Guppy	297	” “
416503	416512	416513	416513	I	0	” cried Mr. Kenge , raising his voice . “
416521	416522	416518	416519	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” “
416525	416526	416518	416519	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” “
416547	416552	416553	416553	You	286	” Mr. Guppy disappeared . “
416600	416612	416572	416572	you	286	” said Mr. Kenge , waving his hand persuasively and blandly . “
416643	416644	416645	416645	Kenge	283	” “
416647	416652	416645	416645	Kenge	283	” said my guardian , “
416700	416701	416684	416684	you	283	” “
416748	416771	416774	416774	you	286	” My guardian said no more , and Mr. Vholes arrived . He was modestly impressed by Mr. Kenge ’s professional eminence . “
416799	416924	416781	416781	you	286	” Mr. Vholes did as he was asked and seemed to read it every word . He was not excited by it , but he was not excited by anything . When he had well examined it , he retired with Mr. Kenge into a window , and shading his mouth with his black glove , spoke to him at some length . I was not surprised to observe Mr. Kenge inclined to dispute what he said before he had said much , for I knew that no two people ever did agree about anything in Jarndyce and Jarndyce . But he seemed to get the better of Mr. Kenge too in a conversation that sounded as if it were almost composed of the words “
416929	416930	416781	416781	you	286	” “
416935	416936	416933	416941	General , ” “ report , ” “ estate	9180	” “
416939	416940	417024	417024	you	245	” “
416943	416945	417024	417024	you	245	” and “
416948	416966	417024	417024	you	245	” When they had finished , they came back to Mr. Kenge ’s table and spoke aloud . “
416980	416989	416977	416978	Mr. Vholes	245	” said Mr. Kenge . Mr. Vholes said , “
416994	416995	416977	416978	Mr. Vholes	245	” “
417005	417015	417002	417003	Mr. Vholes	245	” said Mr. Kenge . Again Mr. Vholes said , “
417020	417021	417002	417003	Mr. Vholes	245	” “
417052	417091	417024	417024	you	245	” said Mr. Kenge , looking loftily at my guardian . Mr. Vholes was gratified , as a smaller practitioner striving to keep respectable , to be confirmed in any opinion of his own by such an authority . “
417095	417121	417024	417024	you	245	” asked my guardian , rising after a pause , during which Mr. Kenge had rattled his money and Mr. Vholes had picked his pimples , “
417127	417128	417024	417024	you	245	” “
417140	417145	417024	417024	you	245	” said Mr. Kenge . “
417187	417188	417173	417173	you	245	” “
417202	417203	417173	417173	you	245	” “
417211	417226	417173	417173	you	245	” said Mr. Kenge , showing us through the outer office to the door , “
417300	417565	417568	417568	master	9808	” He said this at the stair - head , gently moving his right hand as if it were a silver trowel with which to spread the cement of his words on the structure of the system and consolidate it for a thousand ages . CHAPTER LXIII Steel and Iron George ’s Shooting Gallery is to let , and the stock is sold off , and George himself is at Chesney Wold attending on Sir Leicester in his rides and riding very near his bridle - rein because of the uncertain hand with which he guides his horse . But not to - day is George so occupied . He is journeying to - day into the iron country farther north to look about him . As he comes into the iron country farther north , such fresh green woods as those of Chesney Wold are left behind ; and coal pits and ashes , high chimneys and red bricks , blighted verdure , scorching fires , and a heavy never - lightening cloud of smoke become the features of the scenery . Among such objects rides the trooper , looking about him and always looking for something he has come to find . At last , on the black canal bridge of a busy town , with a clang of iron in it , and more fires and more smoke than he has seen yet , the trooper , swart with the dust of the coal roads , checks his horse and asks a workman does he know the name of Rouncewell thereabouts . “
417570	417575	417652	417652	Rouncewell	332	” quoth the workman , “
417583	417584	417652	417652	Rouncewell	332	” “
417597	417602	417603	417603	Rouncewell	332	” asks the trooper . “
417612	417613	417608	417608	You	3818	” “
417621	417631	417608	417608	You	3818	” asks the trooper with a glance before him . “
417642	417649	417650	417650	Hum	537	” the workman wants to know . “
417659	417668	417652	417652	Rouncewell	332	” mutters the trooper , stroking his chin , “
417706	417707	417703	417703	you	3818	” “
417747	418063	417741	417741	his	330	” And which is the factory ? Why , he sees those chimneys — the tallest ones ! Yes , he sees THEM . Well ! Let him keep his eye on those chimneys , going on as straight as ever he can , and presently he ’ll see ’em down a turning on the left , shut in by a great brick wall which forms one side of the street . That ’s Rouncewell ’s . The trooper thanks his informant and rides slowly on , looking about him . He does not turn back , but puts up his horse ( and is much disposed to groom him too ) at a public - house where some of Rouncewell ’s hands are dining , as the ostler tells him . Some of Rouncewell ’s hands have just knocked off for dinner - time and seem to be invading the whole town . They are very sinewy and strong , are Rouncewell ’s hands — a little sooty too . He comes to a gateway in the brick wall , looks in , and sees a great perplexity of iron lying about in every stage and in a vast variety of shapes — in bars , in wedges , in sheets ; in tanks , in boilers , in axles , in wheels , in cogs , in cranks , in rails ; twisted and wrenched into eccentric and perverse forms as separate parts of machinery ; mountains of it broken up , and rusty in its age ; distant furnaces of it glowing and bubbling in its youth ; bright fireworks of it showering about under the blows of the steam - hammer ; red - hot iron , white - hot iron , cold - black iron ; an iron taste , an iron smell , and a Babel of iron sounds . “
418077	418091	417741	417741	his	330	” says the trooper , looking about him for a counting - house . “
418125	418126	418127	418127	Yours	0	” “

418174	418210	418165	418165	I	0	” The young man , telling him he is fortunate in his choice of a time , for his father is there , leads the way to the office where he is to be found . “
418224	418263	418165	418165	I	0	” thinks the trooper as he follows . They come to a building in the yard with an office on an upper floor . At sight of the gentleman in the office , Mr. George turns very red . “
418273	418291	418267	418267	I	0	” asks the young man . George , full of the idea of iron , in desperation answers “
418294	418418	418267	418267	I	0	” and is so presented . He is left alone with the gentleman in the office , who sits at a table with account - books before him and some sheets of paper blotted with hosts of figures and drawings of cunning shapes . It is a bare office , with bare windows , looking on the iron view below . Tumbled together on the table are some pieces of iron , purposely broken to be tested at various periods of their service , in various capacities . There is iron - dust on everything ; and the smoke is seen through the windows rolling heavily out of the tall chimneys to mingle with the smoke from a vaporous Babylon of other chimneys . “
418428	418441	418425	418426	Mr. Steel	694	” says the gentleman when his visitor has taken a rusty chair . “
418447	418477	418444	418445	Mr. Rouncewell	330	” George replies , leaning forward with his left arm on his knee and his hat in his hand , and very chary of meeting his brother ’s eye , “
418562	418563	418535	418535	I	0	” “
418569	418578	418565	418565	you	9210	” returns the ironmaster in an altered voice , “
418585	418612	418565	418565	you	9210	” The trooper falters and looks at him . His brother starts up , calls him by his name , and grasps him by both hands . “
418620	418633	418565	418565	you	9210	” cries the trooper with the tears springing out of his eyes . “
418678	418696	418675	418675	you	9210	” They shake hands and embrace each other over and over again , the trooper still coupling his “
418707	418730	418699	418699	you	9210	” with his protestation that he never thought his brother would have been half so glad to see him as all this ! “
418736	418754	418755	418755	I	0	” he declares at the end of a full account of what has preceded his arrival there , “
418815	418816	418817	418817	We	9217	” “
418833	418838	418831	418831	George	500	” returns his brother . “
418937	419270	419271	419271	Brother	15979	” Mr. George is so entirely overcome at first by this prospect that he resists the proposed honour with great earnestness . Being overborne , however , by his brother and his nephew — concerning whom he renews his protestations that he never could have thought they would have been half so glad to see him — he is taken home to an elegant house in all the arrangements of which there is to be observed a pleasant mixture of the originally simple habits of the father and mother with such as are suited to their altered station and the higher fortunes of their children . Here Mr. George is much dismayed by the graces and accomplishments of his nieces that are and by the beauty of Rosa , his niece that is to be , and by the affectionate salutations of these young ladies , which he receives in a sort of dream . He is sorely taken aback , too , by the dutiful behaviour of his nephew and has a woeful consciousness upon him of being a scapegrace . However , there is great rejoicing and a very hearty company and infinite enjoyment , and Mr. George comes bluff and martial through it all , and his pledge to be present at the marriage and give away the bride is received with universal favour . A whirling head has Mr. George that night when he lies down in the state - bed of his brother ’s house to think of all these things and to see the images of his nieces ( awful all the evening in their floating muslins ) waltzing , after the German manner , over his counterpane . The brothers are closeted next morning in the ironmaster ’s room , where the elder is proceeding , in his clear sensible way , to show how he thinks he may best dispose of George in his business , when George squeezes his hand and stops him . “
419327	419344	419347	419348	my mother	2299	” says the trooper , folding his arms and looking with indomitable firmness at his brother , “
419356	419357	419358	419358	I	0	” “
419369	419374	419375	419375	I	0	” replies the ironmaster . “
419400	419401	419391	419391	She	2299	” “
419414	419415	419411	419411	you	15979	” “
419424	419436	419437	419437	I	0	” says the trooper , folding his arms more resolutely yet , “
419445	419446	419437	419437	I	0	” “
419451	419456	419437	419437	I	0	” returns his brother , “
419468	419469	419462	419462	you	500	” “
419568	419569	419556	419556	you	500	” “
419577	419583	419573	419573	you	500	” replies the ironmaster deliberately , “
419701	419725	419698	419698	I	0	” There is an amused smile on the ironmaster ’s face as he watches his brother , who is pondering , deeply disappointed . “
419743	419744	419698	419698	I	0	” “
419749	419750	419698	419698	I	0	” “
419778	419779	419807	419807	you	500	” “
419784	419805	419807	419807	you	500	” says the trooper , pondering again . Then he wistfully asks , with his hand on his brother ’s , “
419820	419821	419807	419807	you	500	” “
419826	419827	419807	419807	you	500	” “
419864	419875	419877	419877	you	500	” The ironmaster , repressing his amused smile , assents . “
419890	419913	419915	419915	I	0	” says the trooper with a heave of his chest as he unfolds his arms and puts a hand on each leg , “
419926	419963	419915	419915	I	0	” The brothers are very like each other , sitting face to face ; but a certain massive simplicity and absence of usage in the ways of the world is all on the trooper ’s side . “
419966	419975	419915	419915	I	0	” he proceeds , throwing off his disappointment , “
420036	420046	420029	420029	I	0	” shaking him a long time by the hand . “
420079	420080	420081	420081	My	0	” “
420085	420101	420081	420081	My	0	” returns the elder , concentrating his strong steady brow upon him and smiling confidently , “
420112	420118	420109	420109	me	0	” George shakes his head . “
420203	420204	420209	420209	George	500	” “
420211	420225	420209	420209	George	500	” returns the other with a very slight shade upon his open face , “
420239	420240	420227	420227	you	500	” “
420247	420263	420245	420245	brother	15979	” cries the trooper , checking him , with his hand upon his knee again ; “
420474	420475	420476	420476	You	9265	” “
420482	420495	420478	420478	yourself	9265	” says the elder brother , returning the grip of his hand , “
420526	420527	420523	420523	your	9265	” “
420533	420538	420523	420523	your	9265	” returns the trooper . “
420629	420971	420619	420619	I	0	” Herewith he hands a letter , closely written in somewhat pale ink but in a neat round hand , to the ironmaster , who reads as follows : Miss Esther Summerson , A communication having been made to me by Inspector Bucket of a letter to myself being found among the papers of a certain person , I take the liberty to make known to you that it was but a few lines of instruction from abroad , when , where , and how to deliver an enclosed letter to a young and beautiful lady , then unmarried , in England . I duly observed the same . I further take the liberty to make known to you that it was got from me as a proof of handwriting only and that otherwise I would not have given it up , as appearing to be the most harmless in my possession , without being previously shot through the heart . I further take the liberty to mention that if I could have supposed a certain unfortunate gentleman to have been in existence , I never could and never would have rested until I had discovered his retreat and shared my last farthing with him , as my duty and my inclination would have equally been . But he was ( officially ) reported drowned , and assuredly went over the side of a transport - ship at night in an Irish harbour within a few hours of her arrival from the West Indies , as I have myself heard both from officers and men on board , and know to have been ( officially ) confirmed . I further take the liberty to state that in my humble quality as one of the rank and file , I am , and shall ever continue to be , your thoroughly devoted and admiring servant and that I esteem the qualities you possess above all others far beyond the limits of the present dispatch . I have the honour to be , GEORGE “
420976	420989	420619	420619	I	0	” observes the elder brother , refolding it with a puzzled face . “
421003	421008	420619	420619	I	0	” asks the younger . “
421013	421235	420619	420619	I	0	” Therefore it is sealed and deposited for posting among the iron correspondence of the day . This done , Mr. George takes a hearty farewell of the family party and prepares to saddle and mount . His brother , however , unwilling to part with him so soon , proposes to ride with him in a light open carriage to the place where he will bait for the night , and there remain with him until morning , a servant riding for so much of the journey on the thoroughbred old grey from Chesney Wold . The offer , being gladly accepted , is followed by a pleasant ride , a pleasant dinner , and a pleasant breakfast , all in brotherly communion . Then they once more shake hands long and heartily and part , the ironmaster turning his face to the smoke and fires , and the trooper to the green country . Early in the afternoon the subdued sound of his heavy military trot is heard on the turf in the avenue as he rides on with imaginary clank and jingle of accoutrements under the old elm - trees . CHAPTER LXIV Esther ’s Narrative Soon after I had that conversation with my guardian , he put a sealed paper in my hand one morning and said , “
421245	421363	420619	420619	I	0	” I found in it two hundred pounds . I now began very quietly to make such preparations as I thought were necessary . Regulating my purchases by my guardian ’s taste , which I knew very well of course , I arranged my wardrobe to please him and hoped I should be highly successful . I did it all so quietly because I was not quite free from my old apprehension that Ada would be rather sorry and because my guardian was so quiet himself . I had no doubt that under all the circumstances we should be married in the most private and simple manner . Perhaps I should only have to say to Ada , “
421380	422145	421365	421365	you	9273	” Perhaps our wedding might even be as unpretending as her own , and I might not find it necessary to say anything about it until it was over . I thought that if I were to choose , I would like this best . The only exception I made was Mrs. Woodcourt . I told her that I was going to be married to my guardian and that we had been engaged some time . She highly approved . She could never do enough for me and was remarkably softened now in comparison with what she had been when we first knew her . There was no trouble she would not have taken to have been of use to me , but I need hardly say that I only allowed her to take as little as gratified her kindness without tasking it . Of course this was not a time to neglect my guardian , and of course it was not a time for neglecting my darling . So I had plenty of occupation , which I was glad of ; and as to Charley , she was absolutely not to be seen for needlework . To surround herself with great heaps of it — baskets full and tables full — and do a little , and spend a great deal of time in staring with her round eyes at what there was to do , and persuade herself that she was going to do it , were Charley ’s great dignities and delights . Meanwhile , I must say , I could not agree with my guardian on the subject of the will , and I had some sanguine hopes of Jarndyce and Jarndyce . Which of us was right will soon appear , but I certainly did encourage expectations . In Richard , the discovery gave occasion for a burst of business and agitation that buoyed him up for a little time , but he had lost the elasticity even of hope now and seemed to me to retain only its feverish anxieties . From something my guardian said one day when we were talking about this , I understood that my marriage would not take place until after the term - time we had been told to look forward to ; and I thought the more , for that , how rejoiced I should be if I could be married when Richard and Ada were a little more prosperous . The term was very near indeed when my guardian was called out of town and went down into Yorkshire on Mr. Woodcourt ’s business . He had told me beforehand that his presence there would be necessary . I had just come in one night from my dear girl ’s and was sitting in the midst of all my new clothes , looking at them all around me and thinking , when a letter from my guardian was brought to me . It asked me to join him in the country and mentioned by what stage - coach my place was taken and at what time in the morning I should have to leave town . It added in a postscript that I would not be many hours from Ada . I expected few things less than a journey at that time , but I was ready for it in half an hour and set off as appointed early next morning . I travelled all day , wondering all day what I could be wanted for at such a distance ; now I thought it might be for this purpose , and now I thought it might be for that purpose , but I was never , never , never near the truth . It was night when I came to my journey ’s end and found my guardian waiting for me . This was a great relief , for towards evening I had begun to fear ( the more so as his letter was a very short one ) that he might be ill . However , there he was , as well as it was possible to be ; and when I saw his genial face again at its brightest and best , I said to myself , he has been doing some other great kindness . Not that it required much penetration to say that , because I knew that his being there at all was an act of kindness . Supper was ready at the hotel , and when we were alone at table he said , “
422165	422166	422169	422169	guardian	10146	” “
422171	422175	422169	422169	guardian	10146	” said I , “
422195	422196	422187	422187	I	0	” “
422208	422213	422187	422187	I	0	” he returned gaily , “
422401	422406	422398	422398	she	9284	” said my guardian , “
422413	422445	422398	422398	she	9284	” Because he was so dear , so good , so admirable . I tried to tell him what I thought of him , but I could not articulate a word . “
422450	422455	422398	422398	she	9284	” said my guardian . “
422479	422480	422472	422473	Dame Durden	343	” “
422496	422497	422472	422473	Dame Durden	343	” “
422502	422506	422511	422511	you	2039	” said he . “
422534	422543	422544	422544	I	0	” I kissed him and dried my eyes . “
422548	422551	422544	422544	I	0	” said I. “
422563	422564	422552	422552	I	0	” “
422574	422578	422568	422568	you	2039	” said he . “
422590	422742	422580	422582	a Dame Durden	343	” He was so quaintly cheerful that I could not long be otherwise , and was almost ashamed of having been otherwise at all . When I went to bed , I cried . I am bound to confess that I cried ; but I hope it was with pleasure , though I am not quite sure it was with pleasure . I repeated every word of the letter twice over . A most beautiful summer morning succeeded , and after breakfast we went out arm in arm to see the house of which I was to give my mighty housekeeping opinion . We entered a flower - garden by a gate in a side wall , of which he had the key , and the first thing I saw was that the beds and flowers were all laid out according to the manner of my beds and flowers at home . “
422749	422765	422580	422582	a Dame Durden	343	” observed my guardian , standing still with a delighted face to watch my looks , “
422778	423142	422774	422774	I	0	” We went on by a pretty little orchard , where the cherries were nestling among the green leaves and the shadows of the apple - trees were sporting on the grass , to the house itself — a cottage , quite a rustic cottage of doll ’s rooms ; but such a lovely place , so tranquil and so beautiful , with such a rich and smiling country spread around it ; with water sparkling away into the distance , here all overhung with summer - growth , there turning a humming mill ; at its nearest point glancing through a meadow by the cheerful town , where cricket - players were assembling in bright groups and a flag was flying from a white tent that rippled in the sweet west wind . And still , as we went through the pretty rooms , out at the little rustic verandah doors , and underneath the tiny wooden colonnades garlanded with woodbine , jasmine , and honey - suckle , I saw in the papering on the walls , in the colours of the furniture , in the arrangement of all the pretty objects , MY little tastes and fancies , MY little methods and inventions which they used to laugh at while they praised them , my odd ways everywhere . I could not say enough in admiration of what was all so beautiful , but one secret doubt arose in my mind when I saw this , I thought , oh , would he be the happier for it ! Would it not have been better for his peace that I should not have been so brought before him ? Because although I was not what he thought me , still he loved me very dearly , and it might remind him mournfully of what be believed he had lost . I did not wish him to forget me — perhaps he might not have done so , without these aids to his memory — but my way was easier than his , and I could have reconciled myself even to that so that he had been the happier for it . “
423149	423176	423146	423147	little woman	2039	” said my guardian , whom I had never seen so proud and joyful as in showing me these things and watching my appreciation of them , “
423190	423191	423146	423147	little woman	2039	” “
423200	423201	423202	423203	My child	9542	” “
423205	423209	423202	423203	My child	9542	” said he , “
423214	423237	423202	423203	My child	9542	” He took me to the porch , which he had hitherto avoided , and said , pausing before we went out , “
423249	423250	423244	423244	you	9542	” “
423253	423302	423244	423244	you	9542	” said I. We went out of the porch and he showed me written over it , Bleak House . He led me to a seat among the leaves close by , and sitting down beside me and taking my hand in his , spoke to me thus , “
423341	423349	423350	423350	I	0	” smiling as he referred to it , “
423429	423489	423423	423423	I	0	” I was cold , and I trembled violently , but not a word he uttered was lost . As I sat looking fixedly at him and the sun ’s rays descended , softly shining through the leaves upon his bare head , I felt as if the brightness on him must be like the brightness of the angels . “
423544	423561	423531	423531	Woodcourt	692	” I clasped him round the neck and hung my head upon his breast and wept . “
423571	423581	423531	423531	Woodcourt	692	” said he , pressing me gently to him . “
423595	423627	423629	423629	me	0	” Soothingly , like the gentle rustling of the leaves ; and genially , like the ripening weather ; and radiantly and beneficently , like the sunshine , he went on . “
423789	423822	423825	423826	little woman	2039	” He stopped to kiss me on the forehead , and I sobbed and wept afresh . For I felt as if I could not bear the painful delight of his praise . “
423848	423853	423841	423841	I	0	” he said exultingly , “
424077	424084	424085	424085	I	0	” cried my guardian with enthusiasm , “
424111	424151	424167	424167	he	440	” He tenderly raised my head , and as I clung to him , kissed me in his old fatherly way again and again . What a light , now , on the protecting manner I had thought about ! “
424276	424312	424313	424313	Allan	440	” He rose and raised me with him . We were no longer alone . My husband — I have called him by that name full seven happy years now — stood at my side . “
424315	424320	424313	424313	Allan	440	” said my guardian , “
424397	424418	424419	424419	Esther	280	” He kissed me once again , and now the tears were in his eyes as he said more softly , “
424480	424506	424474	424474	Allan	440	” He moved away from under the green roof of leaves , and stopping in the sunlight outside and turning cheerfully towards us , said , “
424562	424826	424521	424522	little woman	2039	” What happiness was ours that day , what joy , what rest , what hope , what gratitude , what bliss ! We were to be married before the month was out , but when we were to come and take possession of our own house was to depend on Richard and Ada . We all three went home together next day . As soon as we arrived in town , Allan went straight to see Richard and to carry our joyful news to him and my darling . Late as it was , I meant to go to her for a few minutes before lying down to sleep , but I went home with my guardian first to make his tea for him and to occupy the old chair by his side , for I did not like to think of its being empty so soon . When we came home we found that a young man had called three times in the course of that one day to see me and that having been told on the occasion of his third call that I was not expected to return before ten o’clock at night , he had left word that he would call about then . He had left his card three times . Mr. Guppy . As I naturally speculated on the object of these visits , and as I always associated something ludicrous with the visitor , it fell out that in laughing about Mr. Guppy I told my guardian of his old proposal and his subsequent retraction . “
424830	424835	424521	424522	little woman	2039	” said my guardian , “
424843	424888	424521	424522	little woman	2039	” So instructions were given that Mr. Guppy should be shown in when he came again , and they were scarcely given when he did come again . He was embarrassed when he found my guardian with me , but recovered himself and said , “
424895	424896	424521	424522	little woman	2039	” “
424904	424909	424899	424899	you	9496	” returned my guardian . “
424919	424924	424911	424911	you	9496	” returned Mr. Guppy . “
424974	424989	424990	424990	Tony	489	” My guardian begged them to be seated , and they all sat down . “
424992	425004	424990	424990	Tony	489	” said Mr. Guppy to his friend after an awkward silence . “
425011	425012	425006	425006	you	489	” “
425017	425024	425015	425015	yourself	489	” returned the friend rather tartly . “
425032	425072	425030	425030	sir	9496	” Mr. Guppy , after a moment ’s consideration , began , to the great diversion of his mother , which she displayed by nudging Mr. Jobling with her elbow and winking at me in a most remarkable manner , “
425115	425116	425096	425097	Miss Summerson	280	” “
425120	425127	425117	425118	Miss Summerson	280	” returned my guardian , smiling , “
425138	425139	425117	425118	Miss Summerson	280	” “
425142	425147	425117	425118	Miss Summerson	280	” said Mr. Guppy , “
425231	425232	425234	425234	you	9496	” “
425239	425244	425236	425237	Mr. Guppy	297	” returned my guardian . “
425263	425280	425281	425281	I	0	” Mr. Guppy therefore desisted from taking something out of his pocket and proceeded without it . “
425300	425330	425288	425289	my mother	2299	annuity”—here Mr. Guppy ’s mother rolled her head as if she never could sufficiently enjoy the observation , and put her handkerchief to her mouth , and again winked at me—“and
425359	425365	425356	425356	you	9496	” said Mr. Guppy feelingly . “
425370	425375	425356	425356	you	9496	” returned my guardian . “
425381	425386	425376	425376	I	0	” pursued Mr. Guppy , “
425447	425473	425504	425504	I	0	” Here Mr. Guppy ’s mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling her head and smiling waggishly at anybody who would look at her . “
425485	425490	425496	425497	my friends	1582	” said Mr. Guppy , “
425524	425535	425515	425515	Jobling	478	” Mr. Guppy looked at him with a sentimental air , “
425541	425554	425515	425515	Jobling	478	” Mr. Jobling confirmed this with a sliding movement of his legs . “
425576	425581	425557	425557	Jobling	478	” said Mr. Guppy . “
425648	425652	425618	425618	Jobling	478	” Mr. Jobling said “
425654	425668	425618	425618	Jobling	478	” and withdrew a little from the elbow of Mr Guppy ’s mother . “
425691	425696	425698	425698	mother	9526	” said Mr. Guppy , “
425735	425736	425727	425727	I	0	” “
425742	425747	425738	425738	I	0	” returned my guardian . “
425750	425755	425738	425738	I	0	” pursued Mr. Guppy , “
425796	425809	425789	425789	I	0	” My guardian patted me on the shoulder and seemed much amused . “
425814	425819	425812	425812	sir	9496	” said Mr. Guppy , “
425954	425955	425948	425949	Miss Summerson	280	” “
425962	425967	425960	425960	sir	9496	” observed my guardian . “
425972	425979	425970	425970	sir	9496	” replied Mr. Guppy with candour , “
426051	426052	426053	426053	I	0	” “
426060	426072	426053	426053	I	0	” said my guardian , laughing as he rang the bell , “
426104	426105	426084	426084	She	280	” “
426108	426117	426084	426084	She	280	” said Mr. Guppy with a blank look . “
426133	426134	426084	426084	She	280	” “
426143	426177	426140	426140	you	9496	” returned my guardian . Mr. Guppy looked incredulously at his friend , and at his mother , who suddenly turned very angry , and at the floor , and at the ceiling . “
426180	426184	426187	426187	Jobling	478	” said he . “
426222	426242	426201	426201	you	478	” But Mrs. Guppy positively refused to come out of the gangway . She would n’t hear of it . “
426250	426257	426260	426260	you	478	” said she to my guardian , “
426285	426286	426283	426283	you	478	” “
426291	426296	426283	426283	you	478	” returned my guardian , “
426312	426313	426314	426314	I	0	” “
426321	426326	426314	426314	I	0	” said Mrs. Guppy . “
426356	426383	426354	426354	’em	9388	” I was quite unprepared for the rapid manner in which Mrs. Guppy ’s power of jocularity merged into a power of taking the profoundest offence . “
426396	426401	426354	426354	’em	9388	” repeated Mrs. Guppy . “
426405	426429	426354	426354	’em	9388	” Nothing seemed to astonish Mr. Guppy ’s mother so much and to make her so very indignant as our not getting out . “
426437	426442	426433	426433	you	478	” said Mrs. Guppy . “
426450	426451	426445	426445	you	478	” “
426454	426477	426452	426452	Mother	9526	” interposed her son , always getting before her and pushing her back with one shoulder as she sidled at my guardian , “
426484	426485	426479	426479	you	478	” “
426490	426494	426488	426488	William	297	” she returned , “
426509	426796	426505	426505	I	0	” However , Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling together closed on Mr. Guppy ’s mother ( who began to be quite abusive ) and took her , very much against her will , downstairs , her voice rising a stair higher every time her figure got a stair lower , and insisting that we should immediately go and find somebody who was good enough for us , and above all things that we should get out . CHAPTER LXV Beginning the World The term had commenced , and my guardian found an intimation from Mr. Kenge that the cause would come on in two days . As I had sufficient hopes of the will to be in a flutter about it , Allan and I agreed to go down to the court that morning . Richard was extremely agitated and was so weak and low , though his illness was still of the mind , that my dear girl indeed had sore occasion to be supported . But she looked forward — a very little way now — to the help that was to come to her , and never drooped . It was at Westminster that the cause was to come on . It had come on there , I dare say , a hundred times before , but I could not divest myself of an idea that it MIGHT lead to some result now . We left home directly after breakfast to be at Westminster Hall in good time and walked down there through the lively streets — so happily and strangely it seemed!—together . As we were going along , planning what we should do for Richard and Ada , I heard somebody calling “
426805	427143	426803	426803	Esther	280	” And there was Caddy Jellyby , with her head out of the window of a little carriage which she hired now to go about in to her pupils ( she had so many ) , as if she wanted to embrace me at a hundred yards ’ distance . I had written her a note to tell her of all that my guardian had done , but had not had a moment to go and see her . Of course we turned back , and the affectionate girl was in that state of rapture , and was so overjoyed to talk about the night when she brought me the flowers , and was so determined to squeeze my face ( bonnet and all ) between her hands , and go on in a wild manner altogether , calling me all kinds of precious names , and telling Allan I had done I do n’t know what for her , that I was just obliged to get into the little carriage and calm her down by letting her say and do exactly what she liked . Allan , standing at the window , was as pleased as Caddy ; and I was as pleased as either of them ; and I wonder that I got away as I did , rather than that I came off laughing , and red , and anything but tidy , and looking after Caddy , who looked after us out of the coach - window as long as she could see us . This made us some quarter of an hour late , and when we came to Westminster Hall we found that the day ’s business was begun . Worse than that , we found such an unusual crowd in the Court of Chancery that it was full to the door , and we could neither see nor hear what was passing within . It appeared to be something droll , for occasionally there was a laugh and a cry of “
427146	427607	426803	426803	Esther	280	” It appeared to be something interesting , for every one was pushing and striving to get nearer . It appeared to be something that made the professional gentlemen very merry , for there were several young counsellors in wigs and whiskers on the outside of the crowd , and when one of them told the others about it , they put their hands in their pockets , and quite doubled themselves up with laughter , and went stamping about the pavement of the Hall . We asked a gentleman by us if he knew what cause was on . He told us Jarndyce and Jarndyce . We asked him if he knew what was doing in it . He said really , no he did not , nobody ever did , but as well as he could make out , it was over . Over for the day ? we asked him . No , he said , over for good . Over for good ! When we heard this unaccountable answer , we looked at one another quite lost in amazement . Could it be possible that the will had set things right at last and that Richard and Ada were going to be rich ? It seemed too good to be true . Alas it was ! Our suspense was short , for a break - up soon took place in the crowd , and the people came streaming out looking flushed and hot and bringing a quantity of bad air with them . Still they were all exceedingly amused and were more like people coming out from a farce or a juggler than from a court of justice . We stood aside , watching for any countenance we knew , and presently great bundles of paper began to be carried out — bundles in bags , bundles too large to be got into any bags , immense masses of papers of all shapes and no shapes , which the bearers staggered under , and threw down for the time being , anyhow , on the Hall pavement , while they went back to bring out more . Even these clerks were laughing . We glanced at the papers , and seeing Jarndyce and Jarndyce everywhere , asked an official - looking person who was standing in the midst of them whether the cause was over . Yes , he said , it was all up with it at last , and burst out laughing too . At this juncture we perceived Mr. Kenge coming out of court with an affable dignity upon him , listening to Mr. Vholes , who was deferential and carried his own bag . Mr. Vholes was the first to see us . “
427615	427619	427610	427611	Miss Summerson	280	” he said . “
427624	427625	427621	427622	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” “
427634	427648	427651	427651	you	9496	” said Mr. Kenge , raising his hat to me with polished politeness . “
427665	427677	427659	427660	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” No . He never came there , I reminded him . “
427680	427685	427659	427660	Mr. Jarndyce	286	” returned Mr. Kenge , “
427733	427734	427703	427703	I	0	” “
427744	427748	427749	427749	I	0	” asked Allan . “
427754	427762	427749	427749	I	0	” said Mr. Kenge with excessive urbanity . “
427771	427772	427749	427749	I	0	” “
427778	427783	427749	427749	I	0	” repeated Mr. Kenge . “
427822	427823	427817	427817	I	0	” “
427834	427838	427840	427840	you	9496	” said Allan . “
427845	427846	427840	427840	you	9496	” “
427854	427859	427840	427840	you	9496	” said Mr. Kenge ; “
427875	427876	427868	427868	we	9395	” “
427884	427898	427877	427877	We	9395	” repeated Mr. Vholes as if his low inward voice were an echo . “
427907	427920	427899	427899	You	0	” observed Mr. Kenge , using his silver trowel persuasively and smoothingly , “
427961	427962	427947	427947	Jarndyce	286	” “
427973	427977	427947	427947	Jarndyce	286	” said Allan . “
427984	427996	427982	427982	sir	9496	” returned Mr. Kenge with a certain condescending laugh he had . “
428009	428016	428006	428007	Mr. Woodcourt	440	” becoming dignified almost to severity , “
428135	428136	428137	428138	Mr. Kenge	283	” “
428140	428151	428137	428138	Mr. Kenge	283	” said Allan , appearing enlightened all in a moment . “
428175	428176	428160	428160	I	0	” “
428183	428188	428179	428179	I	0	” returned Mr. Kenge . “
428197	428198	428194	428194	YOU	245	” “
428203	428208	428194	428194	YOU	245	” said Mr. Vholes . “
428219	428220	428229	428230	Mr. Vholes	245	” “
428223	428228	428229	428230	Mr. Vholes	245	” returned Mr. Kenge . “
428232	428233	428229	428230	Mr. Vholes	245	” “
428236	428241	428229	428230	Mr. Vholes	245	” said Mr. Vholes . “
428246	428250	428229	428230	Mr. Vholes	245	” whispered Allan , “
428258	428313	428229	428230	Mr. Vholes	245	” There was such a shock of apprehension in his face , and he knew Richard so perfectly , and I too had seen so much of his gradual decay , that what my dear girl had said to me in the fullness of her foreboding love sounded like a knell in my ears . “
428325	428334	428229	428230	Mr. Vholes	245	” said Mr. Vholes , coming after us , “
428362	428441	428359	428360	Miss Summerson	280	” As he gave me that slowly devouring look of his , while twisting up the strings of his bag before he hastened with it after Mr. Kenge , the benignant shadow of whose conversational presence he seemed afraid to leave , he gave one gasp as if he had swallowed the last morsel of his client , and his black buttoned - up unwholesome figure glided away to the low door at the end of the Hall . “
428446	428450	428359	428360	Miss Summerson	280	” said Allan , “
428480	428531	428532	428533	Little woman	2039	” I would not let him take me to a coach , but entreated him to go to Richard without a moment ’s delay and leave me to do as he wished . Hurrying home , I found my guardian and told him gradually with what news I had returned . “
428535	428544	428532	428533	Little woman	2039	” said he , quite unmoved for himself , “
428570	428843	428844	428845	Dame Durden	343	” We talked about them all the morning and discussed what it was possible to do . In the afternoon my guardian walked with me to Symond ’s Inn and left me at the door . I went upstairs . When my darling heard my footsteps , she came out into the small passage and threw her arms round my neck , but she composed herself directly and said that Richard had asked for me several times . Allan had found him sitting in the corner of the court , she told me , like a stone figure . On being roused , he had broken away and made as if he would have spoken in a fierce voice to the judge . He was stopped by his mouth being full of blood , and Allan had brought him home . He was lying on a sofa with his eyes closed when I went in . There were restoratives on the table ; the room was made as airy as possible , and was darkened , and was very orderly and quiet . Allan stood behind him watching him gravely . His face appeared to me to be quite destitute of colour , and now that I saw him without his seeing me , I fully saw , for the first time , how worn away he was . But he looked handsomer than I had seen him look for many a day . I sat down by his side in silence . Opening his eyes by and by , he said in a weak voice , but with his old smile , “
428853	428994	428844	428845	Dame Durden	343	” It was a great comfort and surprise to me to find him in his low state cheerful and looking forward . He was happier , he said , in our intended marriage than he could find words to tell me . My husband had been a guardian angel to him and Ada , and he blessed us both and wished us all the joy that life could yield us . I almost felt as if my own heart would have broken when I saw him take my husband ’s hand and hold it to his breast . We spoke of the future as much as possible , and he said several times that he must be present at our marriage if he could stand upon his feet . Ada would contrive to take him , somehow , he said . “
429002	429114	429000	429000	Richard	291	” But as my darling answered him thus hopefully , so serene and beautiful , with the help that was to come to her so near — I knew — I knew ! It was not good for him to talk too much , and when he was silent , we were silent too . Sitting beside him , I made a pretence of working for my dear , as he had always been used to joke about my being busy . Ada leaned upon his pillow , holding his head upon her arm . He dozed often , and whenever he awoke without seeing him , said first of all , “
429119	429140	429000	429000	Richard	291	” Evening had come on when I lifted up my eyes and saw my guardian standing in the little hall . “
429148	429183	429145	429146	Dame Durden	343	” Richard asked me . The door was behind him , but he had observed in my face that some one was there . I looked to Allan for advice , and as he nodded “
429186	429216	429145	429146	Dame Durden	343	” bent over Richard and told him . My guardian saw what passed , came softly by me in a moment , and laid his hand on Richard ’s . “
429221	429225	429219	429219	sir	9496	” said Richard , “
429238	429271	429274	429274	Rick	317	” and burst into tears for the first time . My guardian , the picture of a good man , sat down in my place , keeping his hand on Richard ’s . “
429276	429280	429274	429274	Rick	317	” said he , “
429321	429322	429323	429323	I	0	” “
429345	429346	429338	429338	I	0	” “
429354	429359	429338	429338	I	0	” cried my guardian . “
429371	429379	429360	429360	I	0	” said Richard with a sad smile . “
429409	429410	429404	429404	I	0	” “
429415	429423	429404	429404	I	0	” said my guardian , comforting him ; “
429433	429434	429435	429435	I	0	” “
429441	429445	429435	429435	I	0	” resumed Richard , “
429498	429499	429504	429504	I	0	” “
429511	429516	429509	429509	Rick	317	” said my guardian , “
429549	429570	429571	429571	I	0	” Richard smiled and lifted up his arm to touch him as he stood behind the head of the couch . “
429577	429581	429571	429571	I	0	” said Richard , “
429630	429666	429622	429624	my dear love	9431	” He clasped her in his arms , and none of us spoke . He gradually released her , and she looked upon us , and looked up to heaven , and moved her lips . “
429675	429679	429668	429668	I	0	” said Richard , “
429707	429708	429699	429699	You	9496	” “
429714	429715	429712	429712	Rick	317	” “
429725	429729	429723	429723	you	9496	” said Richard . “
429770	429771	429779	429779	I	0	” “
429815	429857	429812	429813	my love	9612	” he repeated to Ada as he gently passed his hand over her golden hair and put a lock of it to his lips . ( I think he vowed within himself to cherish her if she were left alone . ) “
429864	429876	429812	429813	my love	9612	” said Richard , clasping both my guardian ’s hands eagerly . “
429885	429886	429812	429813	my love	9612	” “
429917	429918	429888	429888	you	9496	” “
429932	429933	429930	429930	Rick	317	” “
429940	429973	429930	429930	Rick	317	” said Richard with a light in his eyes . My husband drew a little nearer towards Ada , and I saw him solemnly lift up his hand to warn my guardian . “
430032	430036	430019	430019	I	0	” said Richard . “
430042	430043	430019	430019	I	0	” “
430053	430058	430059	430059	Ada	290	” returned my guardian . “
430064	430092	430059	430059	Ada	290	” He sought to raise himself a little . Allan raised him so that she could hold him on her bosom , which was what he wanted . “
430149	431163	430141	430141	Ada	290	” A smile irradiated his face as she bent to kiss him . He slowly laid his face down upon her bosom , drew his arms closer round her neck , and with one parting sob began the world . Not this world , oh , not this ! The world that sets this right . When all was still , at a late hour , poor crazed Miss Flite came weeping to me and told me she had given her birds their liberty . CHAPTER LXVI Down in Lincolnshire There is a hush upon Chesney Wold in these altered days , as there is upon a portion of the family history . The story goes that Sir Leicester paid some who could have spoken out to hold their peace ; but it is a lame story , feebly whispering and creeping about , and any brighter spark of life it shows soon dies away . It is known for certain that the handsome Lady Dedlock lies in the mausoleum in the park , where the trees arch darkly overhead , and the owl is heard at night making the woods ring ; but whence she was brought home to be laid among the echoes of that solitary place , or how she died , is all mystery . Some of her old friends , principally to be found among the peachy - cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats , did once occasionally say , as they toyed in a ghastly manner with large fans — like charmers reduced to flirting with grim death , after losing all their other beaux — did once occasionally say , when the world assembled together , that they wondered the ashes of the Dedlocks , entombed in the mausoleum , never rose against the profanation of her company . But the dead - and - gone Dedlocks take it very calmly and have never been known to object . Up from among the fern in the hollow , and winding by the bridle - road among the trees , comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of horses ’ hoofs . Then may be seen Sir Leicester — invalided , bent , and almost blind , but of worthy presence yet — riding with a stalwart man beside him , constant to his bridle - rein . When they come to a certain spot before the mausoleum - door , Sir Leicester ’s accustomed horse stops of his own accord , and Sir Leicester , pulling off his hat , is still for a few moments before they ride away . War rages yet with the audacious Boythorn , though at uncertain intervals , and now hotly , and now coolly , flickering like an unsteady fire . The truth is said to be that when Sir Leicester came down to Lincolnshire for good , Mr. Boythorn showed a manifest desire to abandon his right of way and do whatever Sir Leicester would , which Sir Leicester , conceiving to be a condescension to his illness or misfortune , took in such high dudgeon , and was so magnificently aggrieved by , that Mr. Boythorn found himself under the necessity of committing a flagrant trespass to restore his neighbour to himself . Similarly , Mr. Boythorn continues to post tremendous placards on the disputed thoroughfare and ( with his bird upon his head ) to hold forth vehemently against Sir Leicester in the sanctuary of his own home ; similarly , also , he defies him as of old in the little church by testifying a bland unconsciousness of his existence . But it is whispered that when he is most ferocious towards his old foe , he is really most considerate , and that Sir Leicester , in the dignity of being implacable , little supposes how much he is humoured . As little does he think how near together he and his antagonist have suffered in the fortunes of two sisters , and his antagonist , who knows it now , is not the man to tell him . So the quarrel goes on to the satisfaction of both . In one of the lodges of the park — that lodge within sight of the house where , once upon a time , when the waters were out down in Lincolnshire , my Lady used to see the keeper ’s child — the stalwart man , the trooper formerly , is housed . Some relics of his old calling hang upon the walls , and these it is the chosen recreation of a little lame man about the stable - yard to keep gleaming bright . A busy little man he always is , in the polishing at harness - house doors , of stirrup - irons , bits , curb - chains , harness bosses , anything in the way of a stable - yard that will take a polish , leading a life of friction . A shaggy little damaged man , withal , not unlike an old dog of some mongrel breed , who has been considerably knocked about . He answers to the name of Phil . A goodly sight it is to see the grand old housekeeper ( harder of hearing now ) going to church on the arm of her son and to observe — which few do , for the house is scant of company in these times — the relations of both towards Sir Leicester , and his towards them . They have visitors in the high summer weather , when a grey cloak and umbrella , unknown to Chesney Wold at other periods , are seen among the leaves ; when two young ladies are occasionally found gambolling in sequestered saw - pits and such nooks of the park ; and when the smoke of two pipes wreathes away into the fragrant evening air from the trooper ’s door . Then is a fife heard trolling within the lodge on the inspiring topic of the “
431166	431193	431201	431203	the old girl	4707	” ; and as the evening closes in , a gruff inflexible voice is heard to say , while two men pace together up and down , “
431210	431547	431201	431203	the old girl	4707	” The greater part of the house is shut up , and it is a show - house no longer ; yet Sir Leicester holds his shrunken state in the long drawing - room for all that , and reposes in his old place before my Lady ’s picture . Closed in by night with broad screens , and illumined only in that part , the light of the drawing - room seems gradually contracting and dwindling until it shall be no more . A little more , in truth , and it will be all extinguished for Sir Leicester ; and the damp door in the mausoleum which shuts so tight , and looks so obdurate , will have opened and received him . Volumnia , growing with the flight of time pinker as to the red in her face , and yellower as to the white , reads to Sir Leicester in the long evenings and is driven to various artifices to conceal her yawns , of which the chief and most efficacious is the insertion of the pearl necklace between her rosy lips . Long - winded treatises on the Buffy and Boodle question , showing how Buffy is immaculate and Boodle villainous , and how the country is lost by being all Boodle and no Buffy , or saved by being all Buffy and no Boodle ( it must be one of the two , and can not be anything else ) , are the staple of her reading . Sir Leicester is not particular what it is and does not appear to follow it very closely , further than that he always comes broad awake the moment Volumnia ventures to leave off , and sonorously repeating her last words , begs with some displeasure to know if she finds herself fatigued . However , Volumnia , in the course of her bird - like hopping about and pecking at papers , has alighted on a memorandum concerning herself in the event of “
431550	432517	431201	431203	the old girl	4707	” to her kinsman , which is handsome compensation for an extensive course of reading and holds even the dragon Boredom at bay . The cousins generally are rather shy of Chesney Wold in its dullness , but take to it a little in the shooting season , when guns are heard in the plantations , and a few scattered beaters and keepers wait at the old places of appointment for low - spirited twos and threes of cousins . The debilitated cousin , more debilitated by the dreariness of the place , gets into a fearful state of depression , groaning under penitential sofa - pillows in his gunless hours and protesting that such fernal old jail’s — nough t’sew fler up — frever . The only great occasions for Volumnia in this changed aspect of the place in Lincolnshire are those occasions , rare and widely separated , when something is to be done for the county or the country in the way of gracing a public ball . Then , indeed , does the tuckered sylph come out in fairy form and proceed with joy under cousinly escort to the exhausted old assembly - room , fourteen heavy miles off , which , during three hundred and sixty - four days and nights of every ordinary year , is a kind of antipodean lumber - room full of old chairs and tables upside down . Then , indeed , does she captivate all hearts by her condescension , by her girlish vivacity , and by her skipping about as in the days when the hideous old general with the mouth too full of teeth had not cut one of them at two guineas each . Then does she twirl and twine , a pastoral nymph of good family , through the mazes of the dance . Then do the swains appear with tea , with lemonade , with sandwiches , with homage . Then is she kind and cruel , stately and unassuming , various , beautifully wilful . Then is there a singular kind of parallel between her and the little glass chandeliers of another age embellishing that assembly - room , which , with their meagre stems , their spare little drops , their disappointing knobs where no drops are , their bare little stalks from which knobs and drops have both departed , and their little feeble prismatic twinkling , all seem Volumnias . For the rest , Lincolnshire life to Volumnia is a vast blank of overgrown house looking out upon trees , sighing , wringing their hands , bowing their heads , and casting their tears upon the window - panes in monotonous depressions . A labyrinth of grandeur , less the property of an old family of human beings and their ghostly likenesses than of an old family of echoings and thunderings which start out of their hundred graves at every sound and go resounding through the building . A waste of unused passages and staircases in which to drop a comb upon a bedroom floor at night is to send a stealthy footfall on an errand through the house . A place where few people care to go about alone , where a maid screams if an ash drops from the fire , takes to crying at all times and seasons , becomes the victim of a low disorder of the spirits , and gives warning and departs . Thus Chesney Wold . With so much of itself abandoned to darkness and vacancy ; with so little change under the summer shining or the wintry lowering ; so sombre and motionless always — no flag flying now by day , no rows of lights sparkling by night ; with no family to come and go , no visitors to be the souls of pale cold shapes of rooms , no stir of life about it — passion and pride , even to the stranger ’s eye , have died away from the place in Lincolnshire and yielded it to dull repose . CHAPTER LXVII The Close of Esther ’s Narrative Full seven happy years I have been the mistress of Bleak House . The few words that I have to add to what I have written are soon penned ; then I and the unknown friend to whom I write will part for ever . Not without much dear remembrance on my side . Not without some , I hope , on his or hers . They gave my darling into my arms , and through many weeks I never left her . The little child who was to have done so much was born before the turf was planted on its father ’s grave . It was a boy ; and I , my husband , and my guardian gave him his father ’s name . The help that my dear counted on did come to her , though it came , in the eternal wisdom , for another purpose . Though to bless and restore his mother , not his father , was the errand of this baby , its power was mighty to do it . When I saw the strength of the weak little hand and how its touch could heal my darling ’s heart and raised hope within her , I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of God . They throve , and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country garden and walk there with her infant in her arms . I was married then . I was the happiest of the happy . It was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked Ada when she would come home . “
432527	432531	432521	432521	your	9453	” said he , “
432560	432564	432569	432569	John	248	” Ada called him “
432571	433472	432569	432569	John	248	” But he said , no , it must be guardian now . He was her guardian henceforth , and the boy ’s ; and he had an old association with the name . So she called him guardian , and has called him guardian ever since . The children know him by no other name . I say the children ; I have two little daughters . It is difficult to believe that Charley ( round - eyed still , and not at all grammatical ) is married to a miller in our neighbourhood ; yet so it is ; and even now , looking up from my desk as I write early in the morning at my summer window , I see the very mill beginning to go round . I hope the miller will not spoil Charley ; but he is very fond of her , and Charley is rather vain of such a match , for he is well to do and was in great request . So far as my small maid is concerned , I might suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill did half an hour ago , since little Emma , Charley ’s sister , is exactly what Charley used to be . As to Tom , Charley ’s brother , I am really afraid to say what he did at school in ciphering , but I think it was decimals . He is apprenticed to the miller , whatever it was , and is a good bashful fellow , always falling in love with somebody and being ashamed of it . Caddy Jellyby passed her very last holidays with us and was a dearer creature than ever , perpetually dancing in and out of the house with the children as if she had never given a dancing - lesson in her life . Caddy keeps her own little carriage now instead of hiring one , and lives full two miles further westward than Newman Street . She works very hard , her husband ( an excellent one ) being lame and able to do very little . Still , she is more than contented and does all she has to do with all her heart . Mr. Jellyby spends his evenings at her new house with his head against the wall as he used to do in her old one . I have heard that Mrs. Jellyby was understood to suffer great mortification from her daughter ’s ignoble marriage and pursuits , but I hope she got over it in time . She has been disappointed in Borrioboola - Gha , which turned out a failure in consequence of the king of Borrioboola wanting to sell everybody — who survived the climate — for rum , but she has taken up with the rights of women to sit in Parliament , and Caddy tells me it is a mission involving more correspondence than the old one . I had almost forgotten Caddy ’s poor little girl . She is not such a mite now , but she is deaf and dumb . I believe there never was a better mother than Caddy , who learns , in her scanty intervals of leisure , innumerable deaf and dumb arts to soften the affliction of her child . As if I were never to have done with Caddy , I am reminded here of Peepy and old Mr. Turveydrop . Peepy is in the Custom House , and doing extremely well . Old Mr. Turveydrop , very apoplectic , still exhibits his deportment about town , still enjoys himself in the old manner , is still believed in in the old way . He is constant in his patronage of Peepy and is understood to have bequeathed him a favourite French clock in his dressing - room — which is not his property . With the first money we saved at home , we added to our pretty house by throwing out a little growlery expressly for my guardian , which we inaugurated with great splendour the next time he came down to see us . I try to write all this lightly , because my heart is full in drawing to an end , but when I write of him , my tears will have their way . I never look at him but I hear our poor dear Richard calling him a good man . To Ada and her pretty boy , he is the fondest father ; to me he is what he has ever been , and what name can I give to that ? He is my husband ’s best and dearest friend , he is our children ’s darling , he is the object of our deepest love and veneration . Yet while I feel towards him as if he were a superior being , I am so familiar with him and so easy with him that I almost wonder at myself . I have never lost my old names , nor has he lost his ; nor do I ever , when he is with us , sit in any other place than in my old chair at his side , Dame Trot , Dame Durden , Little Woman — all just the same as ever ; and I answer , “
433478	433904	432569	432569	John	248	” just the same . I have never known the wind to be in the east for a single moment since the day when he took me to the porch to read the name . I remarked to him once that the wind seemed never in the east now , and he said , no , truly ; it had finally departed from that quarter on that very day . I think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever . The sorrow that has been in her face — for it is not there now — seems to have purified even its innocent expression and to have given it a diviner quality . Sometimes when I raise my eyes and see her in the black dress that she still wears , teaching my Richard , I feel — it is difficult to express — as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear Esther in her prayers . I call him my Richard ! But he says that he has two mamas , and I am one . We are not rich in the bank , but we have always prospered , and we have quite enough . I never walk out with my husband but I hear the people bless him . I never go into a house of any degree but I hear his praises or see them in grateful eyes . I never lie down at night but I know that in the course of that day he has alleviated pain and soothed some fellow - creature in the time of need . I know that from the beds of those who were past recovery , thanks have often , often gone up , in the last hour , for his patient ministration . Is not this to be rich ? The people even praise me as the doctor ’s wife . The people even like me as I go about , and make so much of me that I am quite abashed . I owe it all to him , my love , my pride ! They like me for his sake , as I do everything I do in life for his sake . A night or two ago , after bustling about preparing for my darling and my guardian and little Richard , who are coming to - morrow , I was sitting out in the porch of all places , that dearly memorable porch , when Allan came home . So he said , “
433916	433921	433912	433912	you	9461	” And I said , “
433946	433947	433939	433939	I	0	” “
433958	433963	433950	433950	you	9461	” said Allan then . “
433969	433972	433950	433950	you	9461	” said I. “
433999	434000	434004	434004	you	9461	” “
434014	434018	434004	434004	you	9461	” said Allan . “
434045	434046	434024	434024	I	0	” “
434054	434060	434024	434024	I	0	” said Allan , laughing . “
434069	434070	434024	434024	I	0	” “
434076	434086	434024	434024	I	0	” said Allan , drawing my arm through his , “
434095	434096	434088	434088	you	9461	” “
434108	434109	434104	434104	me	0	” “
