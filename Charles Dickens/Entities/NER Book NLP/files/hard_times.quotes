1815	1850	1851	1851	You	280	’ A pause . One corpulent slow boy , with a wheezy manner of breathing , ventured the answer , Because he would n’t paper a room at all , but would paint it . ‘
1858	1866	1851	1851	You	280	’ said the gentleman , rather warmly . ‘
1872	1877	1867	1867	You	280	’ said Thomas Gradgrind , ‘
1904	1905	1899	1899	you	280	’ ‘

1967	1972	1965	1965	sir	2713	’ from one half . ‘

1987	2001	1975	1975	sir	2713	’ said the gentleman , with an indignant look at the wrong half . ‘
2048	2055	2118	2118	sir	2713	’ Thomas Gradgrind nodded his approbation . ‘
2069	2074	2118	2118	sir	2713	’ said the gentleman . ‘
2105	2115	2093	2093	you	280	’ There being a general conviction by this time that ‘
2120	2151	2093	2093	you	280	’ was always the right answer to this gentleman , the chorus of NO was very strong . Only a few feeble stragglers said Yes : among them Sissy Jupe . ‘
2156	2176	2152	2152	Girl	2742	’ said the gentleman , smiling in the calm strength of knowledge . Sissy blushed , and stood up . ‘
2210	2215	2218	2218	you	280	’ said the gentleman . ‘
2220	2221	2218	2218	you	280	’ ‘

2305	2306	2301	2301	I	0	’ ‘
2319	2334	2314	2314	you	2713	’ cried the gentleman , quite elated by coming so happily to his point . ‘
2345	2346	2339	2339	You	2713	’ ‘
2354	2360	2339	2339	You	2713	’ Thomas Gradgrind solemnly repeated , ‘
2368	2369	2339	2339	You	2713	’ ‘
2376	2382	2339	2339	You	2713	’ said the gentleman . And ‘
2389	2394	2339	2339	You	2713	’ repeated Thomas Gradgrind . ‘
2406	2411	2339	2339	You	2713	’ said the gentleman , ‘
2566	2571	2562	2562	You	2713	’ said the gentleman , ‘
2610	2644	2693	2694	Mr. M’Choakumchild	78	’ The girl curtseyed , and sat down . She was very young , and she looked as if she were frightened by the matter - of - fact prospect the world afforded . ‘
2651	2656	2648	2649	Mr. M’Choakumchild	78	’ said the gentleman , ‘
2685	2692	2693	2694	Mr. M’Choakumchild	78	’ Mr. Gradgrind was much obliged . ‘
2702	3769	2700	2700	you	78	’ So , Mr. M’Choakumchild began in his best manner . He and some one hundred and forty other schoolmasters , had been lately turned at the same time , in the same factory , on the same principles , like so many pianoforte legs . He had been put through an immense variety of paces , and had answered volumes of head - breaking questions . Orthography , etymology , syntax , and prosody , biography , astronomy , geography , and general cosmography , the sciences of compound proportion , algebra , land - surveying and levelling , vocal music , and drawing from models , were all at the ends of his ten chilled fingers . He had worked his stony way into Her Majesty ’s most Honourable Privy Council ’s Schedule B , and had taken the bloom off the higher branches of mathematics and physical science , French , German , Latin , and Greek . He knew all about all the Water Sheds of all the world ( whatever they are ) , and all the histories of all the peoples , and all the names of all the rivers and mountains , and all the productions , manners , and customs of all the countries , and all their boundaries and bearings on the two and thirty points of the compass . Ah , rather overdone , M’Choakumchild . If he had only learnt a little less , how infinitely better he might have taught much more ! He went to work in this preparatory lesson , not unlike Morgiana in the Forty Thieves : looking into all the vessels ranged before him , one after another , to see what they contained . Say , good M’Choakumchild . When from thy boiling store , thou shalt fill each jar brim full by - and - by , dost thou think that thou wilt always kill outright the robber Fancy lurking within — or sometimes only maim him and distort him ! CHAPTER III A LOOPHOLE MR . GRADGRIND walked homeward from the school , in a state of considerable satisfaction . It was his school , and he intended it to be a model . He intended every child in it to be a model — just as the young Gradgrinds were all models . There were five young Gradgrinds , and they were models every one . They had been lectured at , from their tenderest years ; coursed , like little hares . Almost as soon as they could run alone , they had been made to run to the lecture - room . The first object with which they had an association , or of which they had a remembrance , was a large black board with a dry Ogre chalking ghastly white figures on it . Not that they knew , by name or nature , anything about an Ogre Fact forbid ! I only use the word to express a monster in a lecturing castle , with Heaven knows how many heads manipulated into one , taking childhood captive , and dragging it into gloomy statistical dens by the hair . No little Gradgrind had ever seen a face in the moon ; it was up in the moon before it could speak distinctly . No little Gradgrind had ever learnt the silly jingle , Twinkle , twinkle , little star ; how I wonder what you are ! No little Gradgrind had ever known wonder on the subject , each little Gradgrind having at five years old dissected the Great Bear like a Professor Owen , and driven Charles ’s Wain like a locomotive engine - driver . No little Gradgrind had ever associated a cow in a field with that famous cow with the crumpled horn who tossed the dog who worried the cat who killed the rat who ate the malt , or with that yet more famous cow who swallowed Tom Thumb : it had never heard of those celebrities , and had only been introduced to a cow as a graminivorous ruminating quadruped with several stomachs . To his matter - of - fact home , which was called Stone Lodge , Mr. Gradgrind directed his steps . He had virtually retired from the wholesale hardware trade before he built Stone Lodge , and was now looking about for a suitable opportunity of making an arithmetical figure in Parliament . Stone Lodge was situated on a moor within a mile or two of a great town — called Coketown in the present faithful guide - book . A very regular feature on the face of the country , Stone Lodge was . Not the least disguise toned down or shaded off that uncompromising fact in the landscape . A great square house , with a heavy portico darkening the principal windows , as its master ’s heavy brows overshadowed his eyes . A calculated , cast up , balanced , and proved house . Six windows on this side of the door , six on that side ; a total of twelve in this wing , a total of twelve in the other wing ; four - and - twenty carried over to the back wings . A lawn and garden and an infant avenue , all ruled straight like a botanical account - book . Gas and ventilation , drainage and water - service , all of the primest quality . Iron clamps and girders , fire - proof from top to bottom ; mechanical lifts for the housemaids , with all their brushes and brooms ; everything that heart could desire . Everything ? Well , I suppose so . The little Gradgrinds had cabinets in various departments of science too . They had a little conchological cabinet , and a little metallurgical cabinet , and a little mineralogical cabinet ; and the specimens were all arranged and labelled , and the bits of stone and ore looked as though they might have been broken from the parent substances by those tremendously hard instruments their own names ; and , to paraphrase the idle legend of Peter Piper , who had never found his way into their nursery , If the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped at more than this , what was it for good gracious goodness ’

4550	4557	4540	4541	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ what do you do here ? ’
4558	4567	4569	4569	Louisa	91	‘ Wanted to see what it was like , ’
4573	4579	4569	4569	Louisa	91	‘ What it was like ? ’
4580	4585	4540	4541	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Yes , father . ’
4743	4780	4712	4712	he	335	‘ Thomas , though I have the fact before me , I find it difficult to believe that you , with your education and resources , should have brought your sister to a scene like this . ’
4781	4790	4792	4792	Louisa	91	‘ I brought _ him _ , father , ’
4796	4803	4712	4712	he	335	‘ I asked him to come . ’
4804	4835	4836	4836	She	91	‘ I am sorry to hear it . I am very sorry indeed to hear it . It makes Thomas no better , and it makes you worse , Louisa . ’
4851	4900	4902	4903	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ You ! Thomas and you , to whom the circle of the sciences is open ; Thomas and you , who may be said to be replete with facts ; Thomas and you , who have been trained to mathematical exactness ; Thomas and you , here ! ’
4905	4915	4902	4903	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ In this degraded position ! I am amazed . ’
4916	4931	4933	4933	Louisa	91	‘ I was tired , father . I have been tired a long time , ’
4935	4941	4943	4945	the astonished father	343	‘ Tired ? Of what ? ’
4947	4961	4943	4945	the astonished father	343	‘ I do n’t know of what — of everything , I think . ’
4962	4968	4970	4971	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Say not another word , ’
4973	4984	4985	4985	He	343	‘ You are childish . I will hear no more . ’
5010	5036	5004	5004	he	343	‘ What would your best friends say , Louisa ? Do you attach no value to their good opinion ? What would Mr. Bounderby say ? ’
5081	5084	5085	5085	he	343	‘ What , ’
5089	5095	5085	5085	he	343	‘ would Mr. Bounderby say ? ’
5118	5536	5114	5114	he	343	‘ What would Mr. Bounderby say?’—as if Mr. Bounderby had been Mrs. Grundy . CHAPTER IV MR . BOUNDERBY NOT being Mrs. Grundy , who _ was _ Mr. Bounderby ? Why , Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrind ’s bosom friend , as a man perfectly devoid of sentiment can approach that spiritual relationship towards another man perfectly devoid of sentiment . So near was Mr. Bounderby — or , if the reader should prefer it , so far off . He was a rich man : banker , merchant , manufacturer , and what not . A big , loud man , with a stare , and a metallic laugh . A man made out of a coarse material , which seemed to have been stretched to make so much of him . A man with a great puffed head and forehead , swelled veins in his temples , and such a strained skin to his face that it seemed to hold his eyes open , and lift his eyebrows up . A man with a pervading appearance on him of being inflated like a balloon , and ready to start . A man who could never sufficiently vaunt himself a self - made man . A man who was always proclaiming , through that brassy speaking - trumpet of a voice of his , his old ignorance and his old poverty . A man who was the Bully of humility . A year or two younger than his eminently practical friend , Mr. Bounderby looked older ; his seven or eight and forty might have had the seven or eight added to it again , without surprising anybody . He had not much hair . One might have fancied he had talked it off ; and that what was left , all standing up in disorder , was in that condition from being constantly blown about by his windy boastfulness . In the formal drawing - room of Stone Lodge , standing on the hearthrug , warming himself before the fire , Mr. Bounderby delivered some observations to Mrs. Gradgrind on the circumstance of its being his birthday . He stood before the fire , partly because it was a cool spring afternoon , though the sun shone ; partly because the shade of Stone Lodge was always haunted by the ghost of damp mortar ; partly because he thus took up a commanding position , from which to subdue Mrs. Gradgrind . ‘
5603	5673	5596	5596	I	0	’ Mrs. Gradgrind , a little , thin , white , pink - eyed bundle of shawls , of surpassing feebleness , mental and bodily ; who was always taking physic without any effect , and who , whenever she showed a symptom of coming to life , was invariably stunned by some weighty piece of fact tumbling on her ; Mrs. Gradgrind hoped it was a dry ditch ? ‘
5689	5694	5742	5742	ma’am	350	’ said Mr. Bounderby . ‘
5702	5707	5698	5700	a baby cold	349	’ Mrs. Gradgrind considered . ‘
5733	5738	5724	5724	I	0	’ returned Mr. Bounderby . ‘
5789	5810	5777	5777	you	351	’ Mrs. Gradgrind faintly looked at the tongs , as the most appropriate thing her imbecility could think of doing . ‘
5824	5828	5818	5818	I	0	’ said Bounderby . ‘
5874	5885	5872	5872	myself	0	’ Mrs. Gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his mother — ‘
5895	5912	5893	5893	ma’am	350	’ said Bounderby . Mrs. Gradgrind , stunned as usual , collapsed and gave it up . ‘
5921	5925	5913	5914	My mother	357	’ said Bounderby ; ‘
5965	5969	5962	5962	she	358	’em off and sell ’em
5998	6037	6038	6038	She	358	’ Mrs. Gradgrind , weakly smiling , and giving no other sign of vitality , looked ( as she always did ) like an indifferently executed transparency of a small female figure , without enough light behind it . ‘
6045	6049	6038	6038	She	358	’ pursued Bounderby , ‘
6154	6197	6198	6198	I	0	’ His pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social distinction as to be a nuisance , an incumbrance , and a pest , was only to be satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of the boast . ‘
6450	6509	6511	6511	your	96	’ Being heated when he arrived at this climax , Josiah Bounderby of Coketown stopped . He stopped just as his eminently practical friend , still accompanied by the two young culprits , entered the room . His eminently practical friend , on seeing him , stopped also , and gave Louisa a reproachful look that plainly said , ‘
6514	6515	6511	6511	your	96	’ ‘
6518	6523	6511	6511	your	96	’ blustered Mr. Bounderby , ‘
6538	6551	6532	6532	Thomas	75	’ He spoke of young Thomas , but he looked at Louisa . ‘
6559	6571	6573	6573	father	2723	’ muttered Louisa , haughtily , without lifting up her eyes , ‘
6577	6578	6573	6573	father	2723	’ ‘
6584	6593	6581	6582	Mrs. Gradgrind	94	’ said her husband in a lofty manner , ‘
6607	6608	6581	6582	Mrs. Gradgrind	94	’ ‘
6612	6617	6610	6610	me	0	’ whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind . ‘
6634	6676	6631	6631	I	0	’re enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all . I have a great mind to say I wish I had n’t . _ Then _ what would you have done , I should like to know ? ’
6693	6727	6729	6730	Mrs. Gradgrind	94	‘ As if , with my head in its present throbbing state , you could n’t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you , instead of circuses ! ’
6732	6814	6729	6730	Mrs. Gradgrind	94	‘ You know , as well as I do , no young people have circus masters , or keep circuses in cabinets , or attend lectures about circuses . What can you possibly want to know of circuses then ? I am sure you have enough to do , if that ’s what you want . With my head in its present state , I could n’t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to . ’
6815	6821	6823	6823	Louisa	91	‘ That ’s the reason ! ’
6825	6845	6847	6848	Mrs. Gradgrind	94	‘ Do n’t tell me that ’s the reason , because it ca n’t be nothing of the sort , ’
6850	6857	6847	6848	Mrs. Gradgrind	94	‘ Go and be somethingological directly . ’
6935	6938	6944	6944	he	75	‘ no nonsense ’
7025	7028	7030	7031	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Bounderby , ’
7040	7112	7030	7031	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ you are always so interested in my young people — particularly in Louisa — that I make no apology for saying to you , I am very much vexed by this discovery . I have systematically devoted myself ( as you know ) to the education of the reason of my family . The reason is ( as you know ) the only faculty to which education should be addressed . ‘
7191	7192	7185	7185	their	404	’ ‘
7208	7212	7185	7185	their	404	’ returned Bounderby . ‘

7254	7264	7248	7248	his	408	‘ in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise ? ’
7265	7277	7285	7287	the eminently practical	409	‘ I ’ll tell you in what . In idle imagination . ’
7278	7283	7285	7287	the eminently practical	409	‘ I hope not , ’
7289	7308	7285	7287	the eminently practical	409	‘ I confess , however , that the misgiving _ has _ crossed me on my way home . ’
7309	7316	7318	7318	Bounderby	92	‘ In idle imagination , Gradgrind , ’
7320	7382	7318	7318	Bounderby	92	‘ A very bad thing for anybody , but a cursed bad thing for a girl like Louisa . I should ask Mrs. Gradgrind ’s pardon for strong expressions , but that she knows very well I am not a refined character . Whoever expects refinement in _ me _ will be disappointed . I had n’t a refined bringing up . ’
7383	7386	7392	7392	his	92	‘ Whether , ’
7406	7474	7399	7399	his	92	‘ whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything ? Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading anything ? Whether , in spite of all precautions , any idle story - book can have got into the house ? Because , in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line , from the cradle upwards , this is so curious , so incomprehensible . ’
7475	7480	7482	7482	Bounderby	92	‘ Stop a bit ! ’
7511	7518	7482	7482	Bounderby	92	‘ You have one of those strollers ’
7524	7525	7482	7482	Bounderby	92	’ ‘
7532	7547	7526	7527	Cecilia Jupe	76	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , with something of a stricken look at his friend . ‘
7554	7559	7526	7527	Cecilia Jupe	76	’ cried Bounderby again . ‘

7700	7705	7681	7682	Mrs. Gradgrind	94	’ returned Mrs. Gradgrind . ‘

7910	7964	7965	7965	I	0	’ So , Mr. Bounderby threw on his hat — he always threw it on , as expressing a man who had been far too busily employed in making himself , to acquire any fashion of wearing his hat — and with his hands in his pockets , sauntered out into the hall . ‘
7970	7978	7965	7965	I	0	’ it was his custom to say . ‘
7998	8145	7995	7995	I	0	’ Being left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while Mr. Gradgrind went up - stairs for the address , he opened the door of the children ’s study and looked into that serene floor - clothed apartment , which , notwithstanding its book - cases and its cabinets and its variety of learned and philosophical appliances , had much of the genial aspect of a room devoted to hair - cutting . Louisa languidly leaned upon the window looking out , without looking at anything , while young Thomas stood sniffing revengefully at the fire . Adam Smith and Malthus , two younger Gradgrinds , were out at lecture in custody ; and little Jane , after manufacturing a good deal of moist pipe - clay on her face with slate - pencil and tears , had fallen asleep over vulgar fractions . ‘
8162	8167	8159	8160	young Thomas	75	’ said Mr. Bounderby ; ‘
8202	8203	8190	8190	Louisa	91	’ ‘
8212	8243	8204	8204	You	0	’ returned Louisa , when she had coldly paused , and slowly walked across the room , and ungraciously raised her cheek towards him , with her face turned away . ‘
8254	8259	8252	8252	Louisa	91	’ said Mr. Bounderby . ‘
8266	8307	8264	8264	Louisa	91	’ He went his way , but she stood on the same spot , rubbing the cheek he had kissed , with her handkerchief , until it was burning red . She was still doing this , five minutes afterwards . ‘
8315	8321	8310	8310	you	91	’ her brother sulkily remonstrated . ‘
8331	8332	8322	8322	You	91	’ ‘
8353	9349	8348	8348	I	0	’ CHAPTER V THE KEYNOTE COKETOWN , to which Messrs. Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked , was a triumph of fact ; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs. Gradgrind herself . Let us strike the key - note , Coketown , before pursuing our tune . It was a town of red brick , or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it ; but as matters stood , it was a town of unnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage . It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys , out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever , and never got uncoiled . It had a black canal in it , and a river that ran purple with ill - smelling dye , and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long , and where the piston of the steam - engine worked monotonously up and down , like the head of an elephant in a state of melancholy madness . It contained several large streets all very like one another , and many small streets still more like one another , inhabited by people equally like one another , who all went in and out at the same hours , with the same sound upon the same pavements , to do the same work , and to whom every day was the same as yesterday and to - morrow , and every year the counterpart of the last and the next . These attributes of Coketown were in the main inseparable from the work by which it was sustained ; against them were to be set off , comforts of life which found their way all over the world , and elegancies of life which made , we will not ask how much of the fine lady , who could scarcely bear to hear the place mentioned . The rest of its features were voluntary , and they were these . You saw nothing in Coketown but what was severely workful . If the members of a religious persuasion built a chapel there — as the members of eighteen religious persuasions had done — they made it a pious warehouse of red brick , with sometimes ( but this is only in highly ornamental examples ) a bell in a birdcage on the top of it . The solitary exception was the New Church ; a stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the door , terminating in four short pinnacles like florid wooden legs . All the public inscriptions in the town were painted alike , in severe characters of black and white . The jail might have been the infirmary , the infirmary might have been the jail , the town - hall might have been either , or both , or anything else , for anything that appeared to the contrary in the graces of their construction . Fact , fact , fact , everywhere in the material aspect of the town ; fact , fact , fact , everywhere in the immaterial . The M’Choakumchild school was all fact , and the school of design was all fact , and the relations between master and man were all fact , and everything was fact between the lying - in hospital and the cemetery , and what you could n’t state in figures , or show to be purchaseable in the cheapest market and saleable in the dearest , was not , and never should be , world without end , Amen . A town so sacred to fact , and so triumphant in its assertion , of course got on well ? Why no , not quite well . No ? Dear me ! No . Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces , in all respects like gold that had stood the fire . First , the perplexing mystery of the place was , Who belonged to the eighteen denominations ? Because , whoever did , the labouring people did not . It was very strange to walk through the streets on a Sunday morning , and note how few of _ them _ the barbarous jangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad , called away from their own quarter , from their own close rooms , from the corners of their own streets , where they lounged listlessly , gazing at all the church and chapel going , as at a thing with which they had no manner of concern . Nor was it merely the stranger who noticed this , because there was a native organization in Coketown itself , whose members were to be heard of in the House of Commons every session , indignantly petitioning for acts of parliament that should make these people religious by main force . Then came the Teetotal Society , who complained that these same people _ would _ get drunk , and showed in tabular statements that they did get drunk , and proved at tea parties that no inducement , human or Divine ( except a medal ) , would induce them to forego their custom of getting drunk . Then came the chemist and druggist , with other tabular statements , showing that when they did n’t get drunk , they took opium . Then came the experienced chaplain of the jail , with more tabular statements , outdoing all the previous tabular statements , and showing that the same people _ would _ resort to low haunts , hidden from the public eye , where they heard low singing and saw low dancing , and mayhap joined in it ; and where A. B. , aged twenty - four next birthday , and committed for eighteen months ’

9878	9881	9883	9883	he	75	‘ Halloa ! ’
9885	9895	9883	9883	he	75	‘ Stop ! Where are you going ! Stop ! ’
9910	9919	9921	9922	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Why are you tearing about the streets , ’
9924	9930	9921	9922	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ in this improper manner ? ’
9931	9942	9943	9944	the girl	265	‘ I was — I was run after , sir , ’
9947	9955	9943	9944	the girl	265	‘ and I wanted to get away . ’
9956	9960	9962	9963	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Run after ? ’
9965	9974	9962	9963	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Who would run after _ you _ ? ’
10027	10035	10037	10038	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ What do you mean , boy ? ’
10040	10058	10037	10038	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ What are you doing ? How dare you dash against — everybody — in this manner ? ’
10087	10097	10099	10100	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Was this boy running after you , Jupe ? ’
10102	10107	10109	10110	the girl	265	‘ Yes , sir , ’
10113	10122	10124	10124	Bitzer	77	‘ No , I was n’t , sir ! ’

10201	10209	10210	10210	He	2713	’ Bitzer tried Mr. Bounderby with this . ‘
10215	10220	10210	10210	He	2713	’ said the girl , ‘
10226	10227	10210	10210	He	2713	’ ‘
10230	10234	10210	10210	He	2713	’ cried Bitzer . ‘

10337	10339	10341	10342	Mr. Bounderby	92	’em , ’
10344	10361	10341	10342	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ You ’d have had the whole school peeping in a row , in a week . ’
10362	10369	10371	10372	his friend	2878	‘ Truly , I think so , ’
10374	10428	10371	10372	his friend	2878	‘ Bitzer , turn you about and take yourself home . Jupe , stay here a moment . Let me hear of your running in this manner any more , boy , and you will hear of me through the master of the school . You understand what I mean . Go along . ’
10452	10457	10459	10460	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Now , girl , ’
10462	10489	10459	10460	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ take this gentleman and me to your father ’s ; we are going there . What have you got in that bottle you are carrying ? ’
10490	10493	10495	10496	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ Gin , ’
10498	10511	10495	10496	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ Dear , no , sir ! It ’s the nine oils . ’
10512	10516	10518	10519	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ The what ? ’
10521	10533	10518	10519	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ The nine oils , sir , to rub father with . ’
10534	10537	10539	10540	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ Then , ’
10548	10562	10539	10540	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ what the devil do you rub your father with nine oils for ? ’
10563	10583	10585	10586	the girl	265	‘ It ’s what our people aways use , sir , when they get any hurts in the ring , ’
10602	10610	10585	10586	the girl	265	‘ They bruise themselves very bad sometimes . ’
10611	10613	10585	10586	the girl	265	‘ Serve ’em
10616	10621	10585	10586	the girl	265	’ said Mr. Bounderby , ‘
10626	10640	10585	10586	the girl	265	’ She glanced up at his face , with mingled astonishment and dread . ‘
10644	10649	10642	10642	George	71	’ said Mr. Bounderby , ‘
10686	10720	10682	10682	I	0	’em by posture - making , but by being banged about . There was no rope - dancing for me ; I danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the rope . ’
10798	10811	10778	10778	He	75	‘ And this is Pod ’s End ; is it , Jupe ? ’
10812	10834	10835	10835	She	475	‘ This is it , sir , and — if you would n’t mind , sir — this is the house . ’
10898	10950	10967	10967	his	92	‘ It ’s only crossing the bar , sir , and up the stairs , if you would n’t mind , and waiting there for a moment till I get a candle . If you should hear a dog , sir , it ’s only Merrylegs , and he only barks . ’
10951	10959	10967	10967	his	92	‘ Merrylegs and nine oils , eh ! ’
10971	10983	10967	10967	his	92	‘ Pretty well this , for a self - made man ! ’
10987	11229	10967	10967	his	92	’S HORSEMANSHIP THE name of the public - house was the Pegasus ’s Arms . The Pegasus ’s legs might have been more to the purpose ; but , underneath the winged horse upon the sign - board , the Pegasus ’s Arms was inscribed in Roman letters . Beneath that inscription again , in a flowing scroll , the painter had touched off the lines : Good malt makes good beer , Walk in , and they ’ll draw it here ; Good wine makes good brandy , Give us a call , and you ’ll find it handy . Framed and glazed upon the wall behind the dingy little bar , was another Pegasus — a theatrical one — with real gauze let in for his wings , golden stars stuck on all over him , and his ethereal harness made of red silk . As it had grown too dusky without , to see the sign , and as it had not grown light enough within to see the picture , Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby received no offence from these idealities . They followed the girl up some steep corner - stairs without meeting any one , and stopped in the dark while she went on for a candle . They expected every moment to hear Merrylegs give tongue , but the highly trained performing dog had not barked when the girl and the candle appeared together . ‘
11239	11250	11237	11237	sir	2713	’ she said , with a face of great surprise . ‘
11265	11484	11262	11262	him	106	’ They walked in ; and Sissy , having set two chairs for them , sped away with a quick light step . It was a mean , shabbily furnished room , with a bed in it . The white night - cap , embellished with two peacock ’s feathers and a pigtail bolt upright , in which Signor Jupe had that very afternoon enlivened the varied performances with his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts , hung upon a nail ; but no other portion of his wardrobe , or other token of himself or his pursuits , was to be seen anywhere . As to Merrylegs , that respectable ancestor of the highly trained animal who went aboard the ark , might have been accidentally shut out of it , for any sign of a dog that was manifest to eye or ear in the Pegasus ’s Arms . They heard the doors of rooms above , opening and shutting as Sissy went from one to another in quest of her father ; and presently they heard voices expressing surprise . She came bounding down again in a great hurry , opened a battered and mangy old hair trunk , found it empty , and looked round with her hands clasped and her face full of terror . ‘
11520	11542	11545	11545	she	485	’ She was gone directly , without her bonnet ; with her long , dark , childish hair streaming behind her . ‘
11548	11553	11545	11545	she	485	’ said Mr. Gradgrind . ‘
11567	11589	11545	11545	she	485	’ Before Mr. Bounderby could reply , a young man appeared at the door , and introducing himself with the words , ‘
11596	11710	11545	11545	she	485	’ walked in with his hands in his pockets . His face , close - shaven , thin , and sallow , was shaded by a great quantity of dark hair , brushed into a roll all round his head , and parted up the centre . His legs were very robust , but shorter than legs of good proportions should have been . His chest and back were as much too broad , as his legs were too short . He was dressed in a Newmarket coat and tight - fitting trousers ; wore a shawl round his neck ; smelt of lamp - oil , straw , orange - peel , horses ’
11930	11937	11939	11943	Mr. E. W. B. Childers	107	‘ By your leaves , gentlemen , ’
11950	11965	11939	11943	Mr. E. W. B. Childers	107	‘ It was you , I believe , that were wishing to see Jupe ! ’
11966	11970	11972	11973	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ It was , ’
11975	12006	11972	11973	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ His daughter has gone to fetch him , but I ca n’t wait ; therefore , if you please , I will leave a message for him with you . ’
12007	12014	12015	12016	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ You see , my friend , ’
12020	12050	12015	12016	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ we are the kind of people who know the value of time , and you are the kind of people who do n’t know the value of time . ’
12051	12056	12058	12059	Mr. Childers	107	‘ I have not , ’
12069	12107	12058	12059	Mr. Childers	107	‘ the honour of knowing _ you_,—but if you mean that you can make more money of your time than I can of mine , I should judge from your appearance , that you are about right . ’
12108	12126	12128	12128	Cupid	108	‘ And when you have made it , you can keep it too , I should think , ’
12130	12136	12138	12139	Mr. Childers	107	‘ Kidderminster , stow that ! ’
12151	12163	12165	12166	Master Kidderminster	109	‘ What does he come here cheeking us for , then ? ’
12174	12193	12203	12203	his	107	‘ If you want to cheek us , pay your ochre at the doors and take it out . ’

12206	12210	12203	12203	his	107	‘ stow that!—Sir , ’
12215	12255	12212	12213	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ I was addressing myself to you . You may or you may not be aware ( for perhaps you have not been much in the audience ) , that Jupe has missed his tip very often , lately . ’
12256	12264	12266	12267	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Has — what has he missed ? ’
12277	12282	12271	12273	the potent Bounderby	92	‘ Missed his tip . ’

12598	12635	12581	12582	Mr. Childers	107	‘ Tight - Jeff or Slack - Jeff , it do n’t much signify : it ’s only tight - rope and slack - rope . You were going to give me a message for Jupe ? ’
12636	12642	12552	12553	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Yes , I was . ’
12643	12646	12648	12649	Mr. Childers	107	‘ Then , ’
12653	12671	12648	12649	Mr. Childers	107	‘ my opinion is , he will never receive it . Do you know much of him ? ’
12672	12682	12552	12553	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ I never saw the man in my life . ’
12683	12707	12648	12649	Mr. Childers	107	‘ I doubt if you ever _ will _ see him now . It ’s pretty plain to me , he ’s off . ’

12720	12726	12728	12729	Mr. Childers	107	‘ Ay ! I mean , ’
12735	12781	12728	12729	Mr. Childers	107	‘ that he has cut . He was goosed last night , he was goosed the night before last , he was goosed to - day . He has lately got in the way of being always goosed , and he ca n’t stand it . ’

You may be astonished to hear it , but my mother — ran away from _ me _ . ’
13056	13060	13062	13062	Bounderby	92	‘ Very well , ’
13064	13210	13062	13062	Bounderby	92	‘ I was born in a ditch , and my mother ran away from me . Do I excuse her for it ? No . Have I ever excused her for it ? Not I. What do I call her for it ? I call her probably the very worst woman that ever lived in the world , except my drunken grandmother . There ’s no family pride about me , there ’s no imaginative sentimental humbug about me . I call a spade a spade ; and I call the mother of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown , without any fear or any favour , what I should call her if she had been the mother of Dick Jones of Wapping . So , with this man . He is a runaway rogue and a vagabond , that ’s what he is , in English . ’
13211	13236	13238	13242	Mr. E. W. B. Childers	107	‘ It ’s all the same to me what he is or what he is not , whether in English or whether in French , ’
13247	13296	13298	13300	E. W. B.	107	‘ I am telling your friend what ’s the fact ; if you do n’t like to hear it , you can avail yourself of the open air . You give it mouth enough , you do ; but give it mouth in your own building at least , ’
13305	13317	13298	13300	E. W. B.	107	‘ Do n’t give it mouth in this building , till you ’re
13335	13336	13321	13321	You	107	’ ‘
13340	13351	13321	13321	You	107	’ replied Mr. Bounderby , rattling his money and laughing . ‘
13368	13372	13362	13362	you	107	’ said Childers . ‘
13391	13418	13419	13419	Jupe	76	’ Eyeing Mr. Bounderby from head to foot again , he turned from him , as from a man finally disposed of , to Mr. Gradgrind . ‘
13477	13478	13469	13469	he	515	’ ‘
13481	13486	13489	13489	she	345	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , ‘
13496	13497	13489	13489	she	345	’ ‘
13524	13604	13517	13517	he	515	’ said Childers , taking a step or two to look into the empty trunk . Both Mr. Childers and Master Kidderminster walked in a curious manner ; with their legs wider apart than the general run of men , and with a very knowing assumption of being stiff in the knees . This walk was common to all the male members of Sleary ’s company , and was understood to express , that they were always on horseback . ‘
13615	13634	13608	13608	He	515	’ said Childers , giving his hair another shake , as he looked up from the empty box . ‘
13646	13647	13637	13637	he	515	’ ‘
13665	13672	13674	13674	I	0	’ returned Mr. Gradgrind , approvingly . ‘
13689	13690	13679	13679	I	0	’ ‘
13695	13712	13713	13713	I	0	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , rather resentfully , as having been defrauded of his good opinion . ‘
13728	13729	13713	13713	I	0	’ ‘
13732	13742	13713	13713	I	0	’ Mr. Bounderby put in with a loud laugh . ‘
13753	13754	13751	13751	I	0	’ ‘
13764	13776	13761	13761	his	335	’ resumed Childers , feigning unconsciousness of Mr. Bounderby ’s existence , ‘
13853	13912	13932	13932	Punch	114	’ Mr. E. W. B. Childers took one of his hands out of his pockets , stroked his face and chin , and looked , with a good deal of doubt and a little hope , at Mr. Gradgrind . From the first he had sought to conciliate that gentleman , for the sake of the deserted girl . ‘
13921	13925	13932	13932	Punch	114	’ he pursued , ‘
14014	14029	13986	13986	you	528	’ said Mr. Childers , stroking his face again , and repeating his look , ‘
14047	14048	13986	13986	you	528	’ ‘
14053	14058	14059	14059	I	0	’ returned Mr. Gradgrind . ‘
14112	14159	14105	14105	me	0	’ Upon this , Mr. Childers politely betook himself , with his equestrian walk , to the landing outside the door , and there stood stroking his face , and softly whistling . While thus engaged , he overheard such phrases in Mr. Bounderby ’s voice as ‘
14179	14196	14173	14173	I	0	’ While , from Mr. Gradgrind , he heard in his much lower tone the words , ‘
14237	14660	14229	14229	Bounderby	92	’ Meanwhile , the various members of Sleary ’s company gradually gathered together from the upper regions , where they were quartered , and , from standing about , talking in low voices to one another and to Mr. Childers , gradually insinuated themselves and him into the room . There were two or three handsome young women among them , with their two or three husbands , and their two or three mothers , and their eight or nine little children , who did the fairy business when required . The father of one of the families was in the habit of balancing the father of another of the families on the top of a great pole ; the father of a third family often made a pyramid of both those fathers , with Master Kidderminster for the apex , and himself for the base ; all the fathers could dance upon rolling casks , stand upon bottles , catch knives and balls , twirl hand - basins , ride upon anything , jump over everything , and stick at nothing . All the mothers could ( and did ) dance , upon the slack wire and the tight - rope , and perform rapid acts on bare - backed steeds ; none of them were at all particular in respect of showing their legs ; and one of them , alone in a Greek chariot , drove six in hand into every town they came to . They all assumed to be mighty rakish and knowing , they were not very tidy in their private dresses , they were not at all orderly in their domestic arrangements , and the combined literature of the whole company would have produced but a poor letter on any subject . Yet there was a remarkable gentleness and childishness about these people , a special inaptitude for any kind of sharp practice , and an untiring readiness to help and pity one another , deserving often of as much respect , and always of as much generous construction , as the every - day virtues of any class of people in the world . Last of all appeared Mr. Sleary : a stout man as already mentioned , with one fixed eye , and one loose eye , a voice ( if it can be called so ) like the efforts of a broken old pair of bellows , a flabby surface , and a muddled head which was never sober and never drunk . ‘
14663	14688	14689	14689	Your	531	’ said Mr. Sleary , who was troubled with asthma , and whose breath came far too thick and heavy for the letter s , ‘
14718	14726	14707	14708	my Clown	533	’ He addressed Mr. Gradgrind , who answered ‘
14729	14730	14707	14708	my Clown	533	’ ‘
14735	14762	14707	14708	my Clown	533	’ he returned , taking off his hat , and rubbing the lining with his pocket - handkerchief , which he kept inside for the purpose . ‘

14792	14797	14803	14803	Thquire	115	’ said Mr. Gradgrind . ‘

My voithe ith a little huthky , Thquire , and not eathy heard by them ath do n’t know me ; but if you ’d been chilled and heated , heated and chilled , chilled and heated in the ring when you wath young , ath often ath I have been , _ your _ voithe would n’t have lathted out , Thquire , no more than mine . ’
14912	14918	14920	14921	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ I dare say not , ’
14923	14947	14949	14950	Mr. Sleary	87	‘ What thall it be , Thquire , while you wait ? Thall it be Therry ? Give it a name , Thquire ! ’
14956	14965	14967	14968	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Nothing for me , I thank you , ’
14970	14999	14967	14968	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Do n’t thay nothing , Thquire . What doth your friend thay ? If you have n’t took your feed yet , have a glath of bitterth . ’
15061	15071	15082	15082	she	76	‘ Father , hush ! she has come back ! ’
15155	15167	15169	15169	Sleary	87	‘ Ith an internal thame , upon my thoul it ith , ’
15171	15234	15169	15169	Sleary	87	‘ O my dear father , my good kind father , where are you gone ? You are gone to try to do me some good , I know ! You are gone away for my sake , I am sure ! And how miserable and helpless you will be without me , poor , poor father , until you come back ! ’
15293	15300	15302	15302	he	92	‘ Now , good people all , ’
15304	15369	15302	15302	he	92	‘ this is wanton waste of time . Let the girl understand the fact . Let her take it from me , if you like , who have been run away from , myself . Here , what ’s your name ! Your father has absconded — deserted you — and you must n’t expect to see him again as long as you live . ’
15416	15419	15413	15414	The men	549	‘ Shame ! ’
15423	15426	15428	15428	Sleary	87	‘ Brute ! ’
15444	15474	15441	15442	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ I tell you what , Thquire . To thpeak plain to you , my opinion ith that you had better cut it thort , and drop it . They ’re

15546	15553	15555	15555	he	75	‘ It is of no moment , ’
15557	15600	15555	15555	he	75	‘ whether this person is to be expected back at any time , or the contrary . He is gone away , and there is no present expectation of his return . That , I believe , is agreed on all hands . ’
15601	15611	15613	15613	Sleary	87	‘ Thath agreed , Thquire . Thick to that ! ’
15615	15773	15613	15613	Sleary	87	‘ Well then . I , who came here to inform the father of the poor girl , Jupe , that she could not be received at the school any more , in consequence of there being practical objections , into which I need not enter , to the reception there of the children of persons so employed , am prepared in these altered circumstances to make a proposal . I am willing to take charge of you , Jupe , and to educate you , and provide for you . The only condition ( over and above your good behaviour ) I make is , that you decide now , at once , whether to accompany me or remain here . Also , that if you accompany me now , it is understood that you communicate no more with any of your friends who are here present . These observations comprise the whole of the case . ’
15774	15780	15782	15782	Sleary	87	‘ At the thame time , ’
15784	15836	15782	15782	Sleary	87	‘ I mutht put in my word , Thquire , tho that both thides of the banner may be equally theen . If you like , Thethilia , to be prentitht , you know the natur of the work and you know your companionth . Emma Gordon , in whothe lap you ’re
15971	15999	15965	15965	I	0	’ The latter part of this speech was addressed to Mr. Gradgrind , who received it with a grave inclination of his head , and then remarked : ‘
16059	16115	16130	16130	Jupe	76	’ The last words had a visible effect upon her . She stopped in her wild crying , a little detached herself from Emma Gordon , and turned her face full upon her patron . The whole company perceived the force of the change , and drew a long breath together , that plainly said , ‘
16120	16121	16124	16124	you	554	’ ‘
16132	16138	16139	16139	I	0	’ Mr. Gradgrind cautioned her ; ‘

16595	16600	16602	16603	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Now , Jupe , ’
16605	16614	16602	16603	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ If you are quite determined , come ! ’
16759	16767	16769	16769	Sleary	87	‘ Good - bye , my dear ! ’

17279	17435	17436	17437	a Powler	584	’ The Sleary philosophy was propounded as they went downstairs and the fixed eye of Philosophy — and its rolling eye , too — soon lost the three figures and the basket in the darkness of the street . CHAPTER VII MRS . SPARSIT MR . BOUNDERBY being a bachelor , an elderly lady presided over his establishment , in consideration of a certain annual stipend . Mrs. Sparsit was this lady ’s name ; and she was a prominent figure in attendance on Mr. Bounderby ’s car , as it rolled along in triumph with the Bully of humility inside . For , Mrs. Sparsit had not only seen different days , but was highly connected . She had a great aunt living in these very times called Lady Scadgers . Mr. Sparsit , deceased , of whom she was the relict , had been by the mother ’s side what Mrs. Sparsit still called ‘
17439	17547	17436	17437	a Powler	584	’ Strangers of limited information and dull apprehension were sometimes observed not to know what a Powler was , and even to appear uncertain whether it might be a business , or a political party , or a profession of faith . The better class of minds , however , did not need to be informed that the Powlers were an ancient stock , who could trace themselves so exceedingly far back that it was not surprising if they sometimes lost themselves — which they had rather frequently done , as respected horse - flesh , blind - hookey , Hebrew monetary transactions , and the Insolvent Debtors ’
17919	17925	17926	17926	he	92	‘ And yet , sir , ’
17930	17973	17926	17926	he	92	‘ how does it turn out after all ? Why here she is at a hundred a year ( I give her a hundred , which she is pleased to term handsome ) , keeping the house of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown ! ’

18194	18208	18191	18192	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ you are unusually slow , sir , with your breakfast this morning . ’
18209	18214	18215	18215	he	96	‘ Why , ma’am , ’
18218	18228	18215	18215	he	96	‘ I am thinking about Tom Gradgrind ’s whim ; ’
18261	18277	18257	18257	he	96	‘ Tom Gradgrind ’s whim , ma’am , of bringing up the tumbling - girl . ’
18278	18287	18289	18290	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ The girl is now waiting to know , ’
18292	18309	18289	18290	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ whether she is to go straight to the school , or up to the Lodge . ’
18310	18317	18319	18319	Bounderby	92	‘ She must wait , ma’am , ’
18321	18360	18319	18319	Bounderby	92	‘ till I know myself . We shall have Tom Gradgrind down here presently , I suppose . If he should wish her to remain here a day or two longer , of course she can , ma’am . ’
18361	18374	18257	18257	he	96	‘ Of course she can if you wish it , Mr. Bounderby . ’
18375	18412	18463	18463	Bounderby	92	‘ I told him I would give her a shake - down here , last night , in order that he might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association with Louisa . ’
18413	18424	18425	18426	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Indeed , Mr. Bounderby ? Very thoughtful of you ! ’
18451	18461	18463	18463	Bounderby	92	‘ It ’s tolerably clear to _ me _ , ’
18465	18479	18463	18463	Bounderby	92	‘ that the little puss can get small good out of such companionship . ’
18480	18492	18463	18463	Bounderby	92	‘ Are you speaking of young Miss Gradgrind , Mr. Bounderby ? ’

18569	18605	18559	18559	You	92	’ Mrs. Sparsit took a little more tea ; and , as she bent her again contracted eyebrows over her steaming cup , rather looked as if her classical countenance were invoking the infernal gods . ‘

18680	18705	18706	18706	I	0	’ in addressing Mr. Bounderby , was a word of ceremony , rather exacting consideration for herself in the use , than honouring him . ‘
18707	18726	18728	18728	Bounderby	92	’m not going to take him at once ; he is to finish his educational cramming before then , ’

18798	18925	18934	18935	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ But it ’s extraordinary the difficulty I have on scores of such subjects , in speaking to any one on equal terms . Here , for example , I have been speaking to you this morning about tumblers . Why , what do _ you _ know about tumblers ? At the time when , to have been a tumbler in the mud of the streets , would have been a godsend to me , a prize in the lottery to me , you were at the Italian Opera . You were coming out of the Italian Opera , ma’am , in white satin and jewels , a blaze of splendour , when I had n’t a penny to buy a link to light you . ’
18926	18932	18934	18935	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ I certainly , sir , ’
18943	18956	18934	18935	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ was familiar with the Italian Opera at a very early age . ’
18957	18966	18968	18968	Bounderby	92	‘ Egad , ma’am , so was I , ’
18970	19070	18968	18968	Bounderby	92	‘ — with the wrong side of it . A hard bed the pavement of its Arcade used to make , I assure you . People like you , ma’am , accustomed from infancy to lie on Down feathers , have no idea _ how _ hard a paving - stone is , without trying it . No , no , it ’s of no use my talking to _ you _ about tumblers . I should speak of foreign dancers , and the West End of London , and May Fair , and lords and ladies and honourables . ’
19071	19077	19079	19080	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ I trust , sir , ’
19086	19152	19079	19080	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ it is not necessary that you should do anything of that kind . I hope I have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life .

19335	19350	19352	19353	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ You were in the tiptop fashion , and all the rest of it , ’

19494	19648	19484	19486	the blustrous Bounderby	92	‘ Now , I tell you what , my girl . The name of that lady by the teapot , is Mrs. Sparsit . That lady acts as mistress of this house , and she is a highly connected lady . Consequently , if ever you come again into any room in this house , you will make a short stay in it if you do n’t behave towards that lady in your most respectful manner . Now , I do n’t care a button what you do to _ me _ , because I do n’t affect to be anybody . So far from having high connections I have no connections at all , and I come of the scum of the earth . But towards that lady , I do care what you do ; and you shall do what is deferential and respectful , or you shall not come here . ’
19649	19655	19657	19658	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ I hope , Bounderby , ’
19665	19673	19657	19658	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ that this was merely an oversight . ’

19688	19718	19686	19686	Bounderby	92	‘ that this was merely an oversight . Very likely . However , as you are aware , ma’am , I do n’t allow of even oversights towards you . ’

19806	19913	19802	19802	he	75	‘ Jupe , I have made up my mind to take you into my house ; and , when you are not in attendance at the school , to employ you about Mrs. Gradgrind , who is rather an invalid . I have explained to Miss Louisa — this is Miss Louisa — the miserable but natural end of your late career ; and you are to expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past , and is not to be referred to any more . From this time you begin your history . You are , at present , ignorant , I know . ’
19914	19921	19922	19922	she	632	‘ Yes , sir , very , ’
19927	19999	20001	20002	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ I shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated ; and you will be a living proof to all who come into communication with you , of the advantages of the training you will receive . You will be reclaimed and formed . You have been in the habit now of reading to your father , and those people I found you among , I dare say ? ’

20144	20154	20135	20136	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ did you read to your father , Jupe ? ’

20192	20226	20189	20190	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ that is enough . Never breathe a word of such destructive nonsense any more . Bounderby , this is a case for rigid training , and I shall observe it with interest . ’
20227	20230	20232	20233	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ Well , ’
20235	20273	20232	20233	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ I have given you my opinion already , and I should n’t do as you do . But , very well , very well . Since you are bent upon it , _ very _ well ! ’
20377	20400	20401	20401	Louisa	91	‘ Tom , I wonder’—upon which Mr. Gradgrind , who was the person overhearing , stepped forth into the light and said , ‘
20406	20867	20401	20401	Louisa	91	’ Herein lay the spring of the mechanical art and mystery of educating the reason without stooping to the cultivation of the sentiments and affections . Never wonder . By means of addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division , settle everything somehow , and never wonder . Bring to me , says M’Choakumchild , yonder baby just able to walk , and I will engage that it shall never wonder . Now , besides very many babies just able to walk , there happened to be in Coketown a considerable population of babies who had been walking against time towards the infinite world , twenty , thirty , forty , fifty years and more . These portentous infants being alarming creatures to stalk about in any human society , the eighteen denominations incessantly scratched one another ’s faces and pulled one another ’s hair by way of agreeing on the steps to be taken for their improvement — which they never did ; a surprising circumstance , when the happy adaptation of the means to the end is considered . Still , although they differed in every other particular , conceivable and inconceivable ( especially inconceivable ) , they were pretty well united on the point that these unlucky infants were never to wonder . Body number one , said they must take everything on trust . Body number two , said they must take everything on political economy . Body number three , wrote leaden little books for them , showing how the good grown - up baby invariably got to the Savings - bank , and the bad grown - up baby invariably got transported . Body number four , under dreary pretences of being droll ( when it was very melancholy indeed ) , made the shallowest pretences of concealing pitfalls of knowledge , into which it was the duty of these babies to be smuggled and inveigled . But , all the bodies agreed that they were never to wonder . There was a library in Coketown , to which general access was easy . Mr. Gradgrind greatly tormented his mind about what the people read in this library : a point whereon little rivers of tabular statements periodically flowed into the howling ocean of tabular statements , which no diver ever got to any depth in and came up sane . It was a disheartening circumstance , but a melancholy fact , that even these readers persisted in wondering . They wondered about human nature , human passions , human hopes and fears , the struggles , triumphs and defeats , the cares and joys and sorrows , the lives and deaths of common men and women ! They sometimes , after fifteen hours ’

20996	21005	20985	20986	Thomas Gradgrind	75	‘ You do n’t hate Sissy , Tom ? ’
21006	21022	21024	21024	Tom	75	‘ I hate to be obliged to call her Jupe . And she hates me , ’
21028	21041	21024	21024	Tom	75	‘ No , she does not , Tom , I am sure ! ’
21042	21046	21048	21048	Tom	75	‘ She must , ’
21050	21099	21048	21048	Tom	75	‘ She must just hate and detest the whole set - out of us . They ’ll bother her head off , I think , before they have done with her . Already she ’s getting as pale as wax , and as heavy as — I am . ’
21158	21163	21165	21165	Tom	75	‘ As to me , ’
21179	21224	21165	21165	Tom	75	‘ I am a Donkey , that ’s what _ I _ am . I am as obstinate as one , I am more stupid than one , I get as much pleasure as one , and I should like to kick like one . ’

21235	21270	21271	21271	Tom	75	‘ No , Loo ; I would n’t hurt _ you _ . I made an exception of you at first . I do n’t know what this — jolly old — Jaundiced Jail , ’
21304	21310	21271	21271	Tom	75	‘ would be without you . ’
21311	21324	21271	21271	Tom	75	‘ Indeed , Tom ? Do you really and truly say so ? ’
21325	21342	21344	21344	Tom	75	‘ Why , of course I do . What ’s the use of talking about it ! ’
21371	21376	21378	21379	his sister	644	‘ Because , Tom , ’
21388	21495	21378	21379	his sister	644	‘ as I get older , and nearer growing up , I often sit wondering here , and think how unfortunate it is for me that I ca n’t reconcile you to home better than I am able to do . I do n’t know what other girls know . I ca n’t play to you , or sing to you . I ca n’t talk to you so as to lighten your mind , for I never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about , when you are tired . ’
21496	21522	21543	21544	a Prig	647	‘ Well , no more do I. I am as bad as you in that respect ; and I am a Mule too , which you ’re

21577	21594	21601	21601	Tom	75	’ said Louisa , after another pause , and speaking thoughtfully out of her dark corner : ‘
21612	21613	21616	21616	You	652	’ ‘
21618	21622	21616	21616	You	652	’ said Tom ; ‘

21720	21735	21736	21736	I	0	’ She came and kissed him , and went back into her corner again . ‘
21750	21759	21762	21763	the Figures	659	’ said Tom , spitefully setting his teeth , ‘
21812	21813	21814	21814	Your	0	’ ‘

21892	21898	21868	21869	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ said Tom , laughing ; ‘
21918	21997	21915	21916	old Bounderby	92	’ Their shadows were defined upon the wall , but those of the high presses in the room were all blended together on the wall and on the ceiling , as if the brother and sister were overhung by a dark cavern . Or , a fanciful imagination — if such treason could have been there — might have made it out to be the shadow of their subject , and of its lowering association with their future . ‘
22015	22016	22042	22042	his	92	’ ‘
22019	22023	22042	22042	his	92	’ said Tom , ‘
22117	22167	22094	22094	she	664	’ After waiting for some answering remark , and getting none , Tom wearily relapsed into the present time , and twined himself yawning round and about the rails of his chair , and rumpled his head more and more , until he suddenly looked up , and asked : ‘
22176	22177	22174	22174	Loo	100	’ ‘
22189	22190	22182	22182	I	0	’ ‘
22207	22211	22191	22191	You	100	’ said Tom . ‘

22229	22263	22227	22227	Tom	75	’ enquired his sister , slowly , and in a curious tone , as if she were reading what she asked in the fire , and it was not quite plainly written there , ‘
22279	22280	22265	22265	you	75	’ ‘
22293	22307	22364	22364	Loo	100	’ returned Tom , pushing his chair from him , and standing up ; ‘
22316	22317	22364	22364	Loo	100	’ ‘
22328	22337	22364	22364	Loo	100	’ Louisa repeated in her former curious tone ; ‘
22348	22349	22364	22364	Loo	100	’ ‘
22417	22418	22421	22421	Tom	75	’ ‘
22423	22476	22421	22421	Tom	75	’ The answer was so long in coming , though there was no indecision in it , that Tom went and leaned on the back of her chair , to contemplate the fire which so engrossed her , from her point of view , and see what he could make of it . ‘
22484	22488	22414	22414	you	100	’ said Tom , ‘

22587	22601	22580	22580	I	0	’ said Mrs. Gradgrind , who had opened the door without being heard , ‘
22611	22693	22694	22694	Louisa	91	’ sake , you inconsiderate girl , or I shall never hear the last of it from your father . And , Thomas , it is really shameful , with my poor head continually wearing me out , that a boy brought up as you have been , and whose education has cost what yours has , should be found encouraging his sister to wonder , when he knows his father has expressly said that she is not to do it . ’
22713	22747	22707	22707	her	91	‘ Louisa , do n’t tell me , in my state of health ; for unless you had been encouraged , it is morally and physically impossible that you could have done it . ’
22748	22801	22704	22705	her mother	670	‘ I was encouraged by nothing , mother , but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the fire , and whitening and dying . It made me think , after all , how short my life would be , and how little I could hope to do in it . ’
22802	22805	22807	22808	Mrs. Gradgrind	94	‘ Nonsense ! ’
22814	22947	22807	22808	Mrs. Gradgrind	94	‘ Nonsense ! Do n’t stand there and tell me such stuff , Louisa , to my face , when you know very well that if it was ever to reach your father ’s ears I should never hear the last of it . After all the trouble that has been taken with you ! After the lectures you have attended , and the experiments you have seen ! After I have heard you myself , when the whole of my right side has been benumbed , going on with your master about combustion , and calcination , and calorification , and I may say every kind of ation that could drive a poor invalid distracted , to hear you talking in this absurd way about sparks and ashes ! I wish , ’
22970	23001	22958	22958	her	94	‘ yes , I really _ do _ wish that I had never had a family , and then you would have known what it was to do without me ! ’
23005	23357	22807	22808	Mrs. Gradgrind	94	’S PROGRESS SISSY JUPE had not an easy time of it , between Mr. M’Choakumchild and Mrs. Gradgrind , and was not without strong impulses , in the first months of her probation , to run away . It hailed facts all day long so very hard , and life in general was opened to her as such a closely ruled ciphering - book , that assuredly she would have run away , but for only one restraint . It is lamentable to think of ; but this restraint was the result of no arithmetical process , was self - imposed in defiance of all calculation , and went dead against any table of probabilities that any Actuary would have drawn up from the premises . The girl believed that her father had not deserted her ; she lived in the hope that he would come back , and in the faith that he would be made the happier by her remaining where she was . The wretched ignorance with which Jupe clung to this consolation , rejecting the superior comfort of knowing , on a sound arithmetical basis , that her father was an unnatural vagabond , filled Mr. Gradgrind with pity . Yet , what was to be done ? M’Choakumchild reported that she had a very dense head for figures ; that , once possessed with a general idea of the globe , she took the smallest conceivable interest in its exact measurements ; that she was extremely slow in the acquisition of dates , unless some pitiful incident happened to be connected therewith ; that she would burst into tears on being required ( by the mental process ) immediately to name the cost of two hundred and forty - seven muslin caps at fourteen - pence halfpenny ; that she was as low down , in the school , as low could be ; that after eight weeks of induction into the elements of Political Economy , she had only yesterday been set right by a prattler three feet high , for returning to the question , ‘
23367	23372	23502	23502	you	672	’ the absurd answer , ‘
23387	23438	23502	23502	you	672	’ Mr. Gradgrind observed , shaking his head , that all this was very bad ; that it showed the necessity of infinite grinding at the mill of knowledge , as per system , schedule , blue book , report , and tabular statements A to Z ; and that Jupe ‘
23445	23463	23502	23502	you	672	’ So Jupe was kept to it , and became low - spirited , but no wiser . ‘
23477	23500	23502	23502	you	672	’ she said , one night , when Louisa had endeavoured to make her perplexities for next day something clearer to her . ‘
23506	23507	23502	23502	you	672	’ ‘
23531	23532	23533	23533	You	672	’ ‘
23544	23553	23533	23533	You	672	’ Sissy submitted , after a little hesitation , ‘
23564	23571	23561	23562	Miss Louisa	91	’ To which Miss Louisa answered , ‘
23578	23651	23572	23572	I	0	’ There had been so little communication between these two — both because life at Stone Lodge went monotonously round like a piece of machinery which discouraged human interference , and because of the prohibition relative to Sissy ’s past career — that they were still almost strangers . Sissy , with her dark eyes wonderingly directed to Louisa ’s face , was uncertain whether to say more or to remain silent . ‘
23671	23675	23652	23652	You	91	’ Louisa resumed . ‘
23691	23692	23676	23676	You	91	’ ‘
23702	23706	23699	23700	Miss Louisa	91	’ Sissy pleaded , ‘
23714	23736	23737	23737	You	91	’ Louisa , with a brighter laugh than usual , told her she would be wiser by - and - by . ‘
23742	23749	23737	23737	You	91	’ said Sissy , half crying , ‘

24416	24448	24410	24410	I	0	’ Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head , as it drooped abashed before her , until it was raised again to glance at her face . Then she asked : ‘
24469	24493	24458	24458	he	703	’ Sissy hesitated before replying , and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground , that Louisa added , ‘

24526	24538	24523	24524	Miss Louisa	91	’ answered Sissy , upon this encouragement , shaking her head ; ‘

24843	24853	24832	24833	a clown	721	’ said Louisa , with a nod of intelligence . ‘

25097	25111	25093	25093	he	2723	’ said Louisa , with a searching gaze on Sissy all this time . ‘

25185	25198	25175	25176	your father	2725	’ asked Louisa contravening the great principle , and wondering very much . ‘
25203	25211	25175	25176	your father	2725	’ returned Sissy , clasping her hands . ‘
25239	25246	25237	25237	Merrylegs	104	’ she whispered the awful fact ; ‘

25262	25266	25267	25267	Father	106	’ Louisa demanded . ‘
25427	25453	25406	25406	father	2723	’ Louisa saw that she was sobbing ; and going to her , kissed her , took her hand , and sat down beside her . ‘

25501	25513	25497	25499	Dear Miss Louisa	91	’ said Sissy , covering her eyes , and sobbing yet ; ‘
25647	25680	25627	25627	he	744	’ Here Tom came lounging in , and stared at the two with a coolness not particularly savouring of interest in anything but himself , and not much of that at present . ‘
25691	25696	25689	25689	Tom	75	’ observed his sister . ‘
25717	25718	25714	25714	Tom	75	’ ‘
25724	25728	25714	25714	Tom	75	’ returned Tom . ‘

26101	26105	26099	26099	Loo	100	’ Tom remonstrated . ‘

26203	26212	26213	26213	He	744	’ said Tom , with an impatient whistle . ‘
26224	26250	26251	26251	I	0	’ After this , whenever Sissy dropped a curtsey to Mr. Gradgrind in the presence of his family , and said in a faltering way , ‘
26273	26305	26265	26265	you	2723	’ Louisa would suspend the occupation of the moment , whatever it was , and look for the reply as earnestly as Sissy did . And when Mr. Gradgrind regularly answered , ‘
26315	26477	26308	26308	Jupe	76	’ the trembling of Sissy ’s lip would be repeated in Louisa ’s face , and her eyes would follow Sissy with compassion to the door . Mr. Gradgrind usually improved these occasions by remarking , when she was gone , that if Jupe had been properly trained from an early age she would have remonstrated to herself on sound principles the baselessness of these fantastic hopes . Yet it did seem ( though not to him , for he saw nothing of it ) as if fantastic hope could take as strong a hold as Fact . This observation must be limited exclusively to his daughter . As to Tom , he was becoming that not unprecedented triumph of calculation which is usually at work on number one . As to Mrs. Gradgrind , if she said anything on the subject , she would come a little way out of her wrappers , like a feminine dormouse , and say : ‘
26566	26802	26817	26817	Providence	138	’ At about this point , Mr. Gradgrind ’s eye would fall upon her ; and under the influence of that wintry piece of fact , she would become torpid again . CHAPTER X STEPHEN BLACKPOOL I ENTERTAIN a weak idea that the English people are as hard - worked as any people upon whom the sun shines . I acknowledge to this ridiculous idiosyncrasy , as a reason why I would give them a little more play . In the hardest working part of Coketown ; in the innermost fortifications of that ugly citadel , where Nature was as strongly bricked out as killing airs and gases were bricked in ; at the heart of the labyrinth of narrow courts upon courts , and close streets upon streets , which had come into existence piecemeal , every piece in a violent hurry for some one man ’s purpose , and the whole an unnatural family , shouldering , and trampling , and pressing one another to death ; in the last close nook of this great exhausted receiver , where the chimneys , for want of air to make a draught , were built in an immense variety of stunted and crooked shapes , as though every house put out a sign of the kind of people who might be expected to be born in it ; among the multitude of Coketown , generically called ‘
27016	27019	27014	27045	those remarkable ‘ Hands , ’ who , piecing together their broken intervals of leisure through many years , had mastered difficult sciences , and acquired a knowledge of most unlikely things	777	‘ Hands , ’
27218	27228	27230	27230	he	139	‘ Yet I do n’t see Rachael , still ! ’
27315	27321	27304	27304	he	139	‘ Why , then , ha ’
27325	27435	27304	27304	he	139	’ But , he had not gone the length of three streets , when he saw another of the shawled figures in advance of him , at which he looked so keenly that perhaps its mere shadow indistinctly reflected on the wet pavement — if he could have seen it without the figure itself moving along from lamp to lamp , brightening and fading as it went — would have been enough to tell him who was there . Making his pace at once much quicker and much softer , he darted on until he was very near this figure , then fell into his former walk , and called ‘
27438	27513	27516	27516	lad	797	’ She turned , being then in the brightness of a lamp ; and raising her hood a little , showed a quiet oval face , dark and rather delicate , irradiated by a pair of very gentle eyes , and further set off by the perfect order of her shining black hair . It was not a face in its first bloom ; she was a woman five and thirty years of age . ‘
27518	27522	27516	27516	lad	797	’ Tis thou ? ’
27563	27573	27551	27551	she	140	‘ I thought thou wast ahind me , Rachael ? ’

27585	27586	27551	27551	she	140	‘ ’

27636	27691	27634	27634	Stephen	139	’ He looked at her with some disappointment in his face , but with a respectful and patient conviction that she must be right in whatever she did . The expression was not lost upon her ; she laid her hand lightly on his arm a moment as if to thank him for it . ‘
27715	27716	27719	27719	Rachael	140	’ ‘

27849	27856	27757	27757	she	806	‘ Try to think not ; and ’

27956	27971	27954	27954	Stephen	139	’ she answered quickly , and not without an anxious glance at his face . ‘
27977	27978	27954	27954	Stephen	139	’ ‘
27981	27992	27954	27954	Stephen	139	’ he said , with a slow nod or two . ‘

28016	28017	27954	27954	Stephen	139	’ ‘
28022	28093	28096	28096	Rachael	140	’ said Rachael , with another gentle touch upon his arm , as if to recall him out of the thoughtfulness , in which he was biting the long ends of his loose neckerchief as he walked along . The touch had its instantaneous effect . He let them fall , turned a smiling face upon her , and said , as he broke into a good - humoured laugh , ‘
28127	28230	28121	28121	I	0	’ They had walked some distance , and were near their own homes . The woman ’s was the first reached . It was in one of the many small streets for which the favourite undertaker ( who turned a handsome sum out of the one poor ghastly pomp of the neighbourhood ) kept a black ladder , in order that those who had done their daily groping up and down the narrow stairs might slide out of this working world by the windows . She stopped at the corner , and putting her hand in his , wished him good night . ‘
28240	28635	28121	28121	I	0	’ She went , with her neat figure and her sober womanly step , down the dark street , and he stood looking after her until she turned into one of the small houses . There was not a flutter of her coarse shawl , perhaps , but had its interest in this man ’s eyes ; not a tone of her voice but had its echo in his innermost heart . When she was lost to his view , he pursued his homeward way , glancing up sometimes at the sky , where the clouds were sailing fast and wildly . But , they were broken now , and the rain had ceased , and the moon shone,—looking down the high chimneys of Coketown on the deep furnaces below , and casting Titanic shadows of the steam - engines at rest , upon the walls where they were lodged . The man seemed to have brightened with the night , as he went on . His home , in such another street as the first , saving that it was narrower , was over a little shop . How it came to pass that any people found it worth their while to sell or buy the wretched little toys , mixed up in its window with cheap newspapers and pork ( there was a leg to be raffled for to - morrow - night ) , matters not here . He took his end of candle from a shelf , lighted it at another end of candle on the counter , without disturbing the mistress of the shop who was asleep in her little room , and went upstairs into his lodging . It was a room , not unacquainted with the black ladder under various tenants ; but as neat , at present , as such a room could be . A few books and writings were on an old bureau in a corner , the furniture was decent and sufficient , and , though the atmosphere was tainted , the room was clean . Going to the hearth to set the candle down upon a round three - legged table standing there , he stumbled against something . As he recoiled , looking down at it , it raised itself up into the form of a woman in a sitting attitude . ‘
28642	28653	28121	28121	I	0	’ he cried , falling farther off from the figure . ‘
28660	28834	28121	28121	I	0	’ Such a woman ! A disabled , drunken creature , barely able to preserve her sitting posture by steadying herself with one begrimed hand on the floor , while the other was so purposeless in trying to push away her tangled hair from her face , that it only blinded her the more with the dirt upon it . A creature so foul to look at , in her tatters , stains and splashes , but so much fouler than that in her moral infamy , that it was a shameful thing even to see her . After an impatient oath or two , and some stupid clawing of herself with the hand not necessary to her support , she got her hair away from her eyes sufficiently to obtain a sight of him . Then she sat swaying her body to and fro , and making gestures with her unnerved arm , which seemed intended as the accompaniment to a fit of laughter , though her face was stolid and drowsy . ‘
28844	28869	28841	28841	yo’r	816	’ Some hoarse sounds meant for this , came mockingly out of her at last ; and her head dropped forward on her breast . ‘
28873	28890	28841	28841	yo’r	816	’ she screeched , after some minutes , as if he had that moment said it . ‘
28914	28966	28967	28967	I	0	’ Roused by the unmeaning violence with which she cried it out , she scrambled up , and stood supporting herself with her shoulders against the wall ; dangling in one hand by the string , a dunghill - fragment of a bonnet , and trying to look scornfully at him . ‘
28993	29011	28983	28983	I	0	’ she cried , with something between a furious menace and an effort at a defiant dance . ‘

30147	30208	30139	30140	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ said that self - sacrificing lady , making a feint of taking her foot out of the stirrup . Mr. Bounderby stayed her , by holding a mouthful of chop in suspension before swallowing it , and putting out his left hand . Then , withdrawing his hand and swallowing his mouthful of chop , he said to Stephen : ‘

She dressed them now , still without showing her . She steeped a piece of linen in a basin , into which she poured some liquid from a bottle , and laid it with a gentle hand upon the sore . The three - legged table had been drawn close to the bedside , and on it there were two bottles . This was one . It was not so far off , but that Stephen , following her hands with his eyes , could read what was printed on it in large letters . He turned of a deadly hue , and a sudden horror seemed to fall upon him . ‘
35957	35966	35955	35955	Stephen	137	’ said Rachael , quietly resuming her seat , ‘

36080	36133	36134	36134	She	985	’ He heard the thundering and surging out of doors , and it seemed to him as if his late angry mood were going about trying to get at him . She had cast it out ; she would keep it out ; he trusted to her to defend him from himself . ‘

36307	36344	36345	36345	Stephen	137	’ It seized him again ; and he stood up , holding by the mantel - shelf , as he pressed his dank cold hair down with a hand that shook as if it were palsied . ‘
36347	36364	36345	36345	Stephen	137	’ She was coming to him , but he stretched out his arm to stop her . ‘

36578	37794	36566	36566	I	0	’ He closed his eyes , more to please her than to rest his weary head ; but , by slow degrees as he listened to the great noise of the wind , he ceased to hear it , or it changed into the working of his loom , or even into the voices of the day ( his own included ) saying what had been really said . Even this imperfect consciousness faded away at last , and he dreamed a long , troubled dream . He thought that he , and some one on whom his heart had long been set — but she was not Rachael , and that surprised him , even in the midst of his imaginary happiness — stood in the church being married . While the ceremony was performing , and while he recognized among the witnesses some whom he knew to be living , and many whom he knew to be dead , darkness came on , succeeded by the shining of a tremendous light . It broke from one line in the table of commandments at the altar , and illuminated the building with the words . They were sounded through the church , too , as if there were voices in the fiery letters . Upon this , the whole appearance before him and around him changed , and nothing was left as it had been , but himself and the clergyman . They stood in the daylight before a crowd so vast , that if all the people in the world could have been brought together into one space , they could not have looked , he thought , more numerous ; and they all abhorred him , and there was not one pitying or friendly eye among the millions that were fastened on his face . He stood on a raised stage , under his own loom ; and , looking up at the shape the loom took , and hearing the burial service distinctly read , he knew that he was there to suffer death . In an instant what he stood on fell below him , and he was gone . — Out of what mystery he came back to his usual life , and to places that he knew , he was unable to consider ; but he was back in those places by some means , and with this condemnation upon him , that he was never , in this world or the next , through all the unimaginable ages of eternity , to look on Rachael ’s face or hear her voice . Wandering to and fro , unceasingly , without hope , and in search of he knew not what ( he only knew that he was doomed to seek it ) , he was the subject of a nameless , horrible dread , a mortal fear of one particular shape which everything took . Whatsoever he looked at , grew into that form sooner or later . The object of his miserable existence was to prevent its recognition by any one among the various people he encountered . Hopeless labour ! If he led them out of rooms where it was , if he shut up drawers and closets where it stood , if he drew the curious from places where he knew it to be secreted , and got them out into the streets , the very chimneys of the mills assumed that shape , and round them was the printed word . The wind was blowing again , the rain was beating on the house - tops , and the larger spaces through which he had strayed contracted to the four walls of his room . Saving that the fire had died out , it was as his eyes had closed upon it . Rachael seemed to have fallen into a doze , in the chair by the bed . She sat wrapped in her shawl , perfectly still . The table stood in the same place , close by the bedside , and on it , in its real proportions and appearance , was the shape so often repeated . He thought he saw the curtain move . He looked again , and he was sure it moved . He saw a hand come forth and grope about a little . Then the curtain moved more perceptibly , and the woman in the bed put it back , and sat up . With her woful eyes , so haggard and wild , so heavy and large , she looked all round the room , and passed the corner where he slept in his chair . Her eyes returned to that corner , and she put her hand over them as a shade , while she looked into it . Again they went all round the room , scarcely heeding Rachael if at all , and returned to that corner . He thought , as she once more shaded them — not so much looking at him , as looking for him with a brutish instinct that he was there — that no single trace was left in those debauched features , or in the mind that went along with them , of the woman he had married eighteen years before . But that he had seen her come to this by inches , he never could have believed her to be the same . All this time , as if a spell were on him , he was motionless and powerless , except to watch her . Stupidly dozing , or communing with her incapable self about nothing , she sat for a little while with her hands at her ears , and her head resting on them . Presently , she resumed her staring round the room . And now , for the first time , her eyes stopped at the table with the bottles on it . Straightway she turned her eyes back to his corner , with the defiance of last night , and moving very cautiously and softly , stretched out her greedy hand . She drew a mug into the bed , and sat for a while considering which of the two bottles she should choose . Finally , she laid her insensate grasp upon the bottle that had swift and certain death in it , and , before his eyes , pulled out the cork with her teeth . Dream or reality , he had no voice , nor had he power to stir . If this be real , and her allotted time be not yet come , wake , Rachael , wake ! She thought of that , too . She looked at Rachael , and very slowly , very cautiously , poured out the contents . The draught was at her lips . A moment and she would be past all help , let the whole world wake and come about her with its utmost power . But in that moment Rachael started up with a suppressed cry . The creature struggled , struck her , seized her by the hair ; but Rachael had the cup . Stephen broke out of his chair . ‘

The wind blew from the quarter where the day would soon appear , and still blew strongly . It had cleared the sky before it , and the rain had spent itself or travelled elsewhere , and the stars were bright . He stood bare - headed in the road , watching her quick disappearance . As the shining stars were to the heavy candle in the window , so was Rachael , in the rugged fancy of this man , to the common experiences of his life . CHAPTER XIV THE GREAT MANUFACTURER TIME went on in Coketown like its own machinery : so much material wrought up , so much fuel consumed , so many powers worn out , so much money made . But , less inexorable than iron , steel , and brass , it brought its varying seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and brick , and made the only stand that ever _ was _ made in the place against its direful uniformity . ‘

38847	38887	38843	38845	a young woman	1002	’ Time , with his innumerable horse - power , worked away , not minding what anybody said , and presently turned out young Thomas a foot taller than when his father had last taken particular notice of him . ‘

38903	38937	38899	38901	a young man	3001	’ Time passed Thomas on in the mill , while his father was thinking about it , and there he stood in a long - tailed coat and a stiff shirt - collar . ‘
38940	38945	38899	38901	a young man	3001	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , ‘
38958	39041	39042	39042	I	0	’ Time , sticking to him , passed him on into Bounderby ’s Bank , made him an inmate of Bounderby ’s house , necessitated the purchase of his first razor , and exercised him diligently in his calculations relative to number one . The same great manufacturer , always with an immense variety of work on hand , in every stage of development , passed Sissy onward in his mill , and worked her up into a very pretty article indeed . ‘

39075	39082	39073	39073	sir	2713	’ Sissy answered with a curtsey . ‘
39092	39101	39090	39090	Jupe	76	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , knitting his brow , ‘
39167	39168	39157	39157	You	76	’ ‘
39175	39179	39157	39157	You	76	’ she returned ; ‘

39200	39205	39189	39189	I	0	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , ‘

39285	39302	39273	39273	I	0	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , shaking his head in his profoundest and most eminently practical way . ‘

39463	39472	39458	39458	sir	2713	’ said Sissy , with a grateful curtsey . ‘

39552	39557	39558	39558	you	76	’ said Mr. Gradgrind ; ‘
39611	39971	39605	39605	I	0	’ He really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for her ; otherwise he held her calculating powers in such very slight estimation that he must have fallen upon that conclusion . Somehow or other , he had become possessed by an idea that there was something in this girl which could hardly be set forth in a tabular form . Her capacity of definition might be easily stated at a very low figure , her mathematical knowledge at nothing ; yet he was not sure that if he had been required , for example , to tick her off into columns in a parliamentary return , he would have quite known how to divide her . In some stages of his manufacture of the human fabric , the processes of Time are very rapid . Young Thomas and Sissy being both at such a stage of their working up , these changes were effected in a year or two ; while Mr. Gradgrind himself seemed stationary in his course , and underwent no alteration . Except one , which was apart from his necessary progress through the mill . Time hustled him into a little noisy and rather dirty machinery , in a by - comer , and made him Member of Parliament for Coketown : one of the respected members for ounce weights and measures , one of the representatives of the multiplication table , one of the deaf honourable gentlemen , dumb honourable gentlemen , blind honourable gentlemen , lame honourable gentlemen , dead honourable gentlemen , to every other consideration . Else wherefore live we in a Christian land , eighteen hundred and odd years after our Master ? All this while , Louisa had been passing on , so quiet and reserved , and so much given to watching the bright ashes at twilight as they fell into the grate , and became extinct , that from the period when her father had said she was almost a young woman — which seemed but yesterday — she had scarcely attracted his notice again , when he found her quite a young woman . ‘
39977	39984	39985	39985	Dear	2972	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , musing . ‘
39988	40074	39985	39985	Dear	2972	’ Soon after this discovery , he became more thoughtful than usual for several days , and seemed much engrossed by one subject . On a certain night , when he was going out , and Louisa came to bid him good - bye before his departure — as he was not to be home until late and she would not see him again until the morning — he held her in his arms , looking at her in his kindest manner , and said : ‘
40084	40112	40115	40115	father	2723	’ She answered with the old , quick , searching look of the night when she was found at the Circus ; then cast down her eyes . ‘
40117	40118	40115	40115	father	2723	’ ‘
40122	40127	40115	40115	father	2723	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , ‘

40223	40274	40208	40208	I	0	’ said Mr. Gradgrind . So , he kissed her and went away ; and Louisa returned to the serene apartment of the hair - cutting character , and leaning her elbow on her hand , looked again at the short - lived sparks that so soon subsided into ashes . ‘
40281	40309	40276	40276	you	91	’ said her brother , looking in at the door . He was quite a young gentleman of pleasure now , and not quite a prepossessing one . ‘
40313	40322	40345	40345	Loo	100	’ she answered , rising and embracing him , ‘
40335	40336	40328	40328	you	75	’ ‘
40404	40405	40390	40390	father	2723	’ ‘

40460	40517	40519	40519	her	1033	‘ Then I ’ll tell you . He ’s with old Bounderby . They are having a regular confab together up at the Bank . Why at the Bank , do you think ? Well , I ’ll tell you again . To keep Mrs. Sparsit ’s ears as far off as possible , I expect . ’
40562	40575	40560	40560	him	2889	‘ You are very fond of me , an’t you , Loo ? ’
40576	40598	40553	40553	his	2889	‘ Indeed I am , Tom , though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me . ’
40599	40606	40608	40608	Tom	75	‘ Well , sister of mine , ’
40610	40680	40608	40608	Tom	75	‘ when you say that , you are near my thoughts . We might be so much oftener together — mightn’t we ? Always together , almost — mightn’t we ? It would do me a great deal of good if you were to make up your mind to I know what , Loo . It would be a splendid thing for me . It would be uncommonly jolly ! ’
40720	40765	40708	40708	She	1036	‘ I say , Loo ! I thought I ’d come , and just hint to you what was going on : though I supposed you ’d most likely guess , even if you did n’t know . I ca n’t stay , because I ’m
40785	40786	40780	40780	you	75	’ ‘

40805	40809	40792	40792	I	0	’ said Tom . ‘
40816	41226	40814	40814	Loo	100	’ She gave him an affectionate good - night , and went out with him to the door , whence the fires of Coketown could be seen , making the distance lurid . She stood there , looking steadfastly towards them , and listening to his departing steps . They retreated quickly , as glad to get away from Stone Lodge ; and she stood there yet , when he was gone and all was quiet . It seemed as if , first in her own fire within the house , and then in the fiery haze without , she tried to discover what kind of woof Old Time , that greatest and longest - established Spinner of all , would weave from the threads he had already spun into a woman . But his factory is a secret place , his work is noiseless , and his Hands are mutes . CHAPTER XV FATHER AND DAUGHTER ALTHOUGH Mr. Gradgrind did not take after Blue Beard , his room was quite a blue chamber in its abundance of blue books . Whatever they could prove ( which is usually anything you like ) , they proved there , in an army constantly strengthening by the arrival of new recruits . In that charmed apartment , the most complicated social questions were cast up , got into exact totals , and finally settled — if those concerned could only have been brought to know it . As if an astronomical observatory should be made without any windows , and the astronomer within should arrange the starry universe solely by pen , ink , and paper , so Mr. Gradgrind , in _ his _ Observatory ( and there are many like it ) , had no need to cast an eye upon the teeming myriads of human beings around him , but could settle all their destinies on a slate , and wipe out all their tears with one dirty little bit of sponge . To this Observatory , then : a stern room , with a deadly statistical clock in it , which measured every second with a beat like a rap upon a coffin - lid ; Louisa repaired on the appointed morning . A window looked towards Coketown ; and when she sat down near her father ’s table , she saw the high chimneys and the long tracts of smoke looming in the heavy distance gloomily . ‘
41231	41236	40814	40814	Loo	100	’ said her father , ‘
41341	41364	41365	41365	Louisa	91	’ He waited , as if he would have been glad that she said something . But she said never a word . ‘
41386	41413	41365	41365	Louisa	91	’ Again he waited , and again she answered not one word . This so far surprised him , as to induce him gently to repeat , ‘
41422	41434	41365	41365	Louisa	91	’ To which she returned , without any visible emotion whatever : ‘
41449	41450	41445	41445	I	0	’ ‘
41453	41472	41473	41473	you	91	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , breaking into a smile , after being for the moment at a loss , ‘
41503	41504	41505	41505	I	0	’ ‘
41543	41603	41535	41535	you	0	’ Strange to relate , Mr. Gradgrind was not so collected at this moment as his daughter was . He took a paper - knife in his hand , turned it over , laid it down , took it up again , and even then had to look along the blade of it , considering how to go on . ‘
41728	41748	41716	41716	his	92	’ Silence between them . The deadly statistical clock very hollow . The distant smoke very black and heavy . ‘
41751	41755	41757	41757	you	106	’ said Louisa , ‘
41764	41775	41757	41757	you	106	’ Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question . ‘
41781	41785	41786	41786	I	0	’ he returned , ‘
41797	41798	41786	41786	I	0	’ ‘
41801	41812	41814	41814	you	106	’ pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before , ‘
41822	41823	41814	41814	you	106	’ ‘
41836	41837	41832	41832	I	0	’ ‘
41840	41845	41838	41838	Father	2723	’ she still pursued , ‘
41855	41856	41847	41848	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ ‘
41862	41867	41847	41848	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , ‘
41876	41877	41873	41873	your	3090	’ ‘
41889	41897	41887	41887	father	2723	‘ Certainly , my dear . Because ; ’
41911	42037	41887	41887	father	2723	‘ because the reply depends so materially , Louisa , on the sense in which we use the expression . Now , Mr. Bounderby does not do you the injustice , and does not do himself the injustice , of pretending to anything fanciful , fantastic , or ( I am using synonymous terms ) sentimental . Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes , to very little purpose , if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense , not to say to his , as to address you from any such ground . Therefore , perhaps the expression itself — I merely suggest this to you , my dear — may be a little misplaced . ’
42038	42052	41873	41873	your	3090	‘ What would you advise me to use in its stead , father ? ’
42053	42060	42062	42063	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Why , my dear Louisa , ’
42071	42391	42062	42063	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ I would advise you ( since you ask me ) to consider this question , as you have been accustomed to consider every other question , simply as one of tangible Fact . The ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies , and other absurdities that have no existence , properly viewed — really no existence — but it is no compliment to you to say , that you know better . Now , what are the Facts of this case ? You are , we will say in round numbers , twenty years of age ; Mr. Bounderby is , we will say in round numbers , fifty . There is some disparity in your respective years , but in your means and positions there is none ; on the contrary , there is a great suitability . Then the question arises , Is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage ? In considering this question , it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage , so far as they have yet been obtained , in England and Wales . I find , on reference to the figures , that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages , and that the elder of these contracting parties is , in rather more than three - fourths of these instances , the bridegroom . It is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law , that among the natives of the British possessions in India , also in a considerable part of China , and among the Calmucks of Tartary , the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers , yield similar results . The disparity I have mentioned , therefore , almost ceases to be disparity , and ( virtually ) all but disappears . ’
42392	42400	42402	42402	Louisa	91	‘ What do you recommend , father , ’
42417	42435	42402	42402	Louisa	91	‘ that I should substitute for the term I used just now ? For the misplaced expression ? ’
42436	42439	42441	42442	her father	335	‘ Louisa , ’
42444	42506	42441	42442	her father	335	‘ it appears to me that nothing can be plainer . Confining yourself rigidly to Fact , the question of Fact you state to yourself is : Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him ? Yes , he does . The sole remaining question then is : Shall I marry him ? I think nothing can be plainer than that ? ’
42507	42513	42515	42515	Louisa	91	‘ Shall I marry him ? ’
42521	42571	42515	42515	Louisa	91	‘ Precisely . And it is satisfactory to me , as your father , my dear Louisa , to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind , and habits of life , that belong to many young women . ’
42572	42577	42578	42578	she	91	‘ No , father , ’
42581	42586	42578	42578	she	91	‘ I do not . ’
42587	42597	42599	42600	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ I now leave you to judge for yourself , ’
42602	42651	42599	42600	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ I have stated the case , as such cases are usually stated among practical minds ; I have stated it , as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time . The rest , my dear Louisa , is for you to decide . ’
42855	42868	42849	42849	he	75	‘ Are you consulting the chimneys of the Coketown works , Louisa ? ’
42869	42894	42895	42895	she	91	‘ There seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke . Yet when the night comes , Fire bursts out , father ! ’
42901	42920	42895	42895	she	91	‘ Of course I know that , Louisa . I do not see the application of the remark . ’
42954	42967	42946	42946	her	91	‘ Father , I have often thought that life is very short . ’—This
42979	43031	42946	42946	her	91	‘ It is short , no doubt , my dear . Still , the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years . The calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices , among other figures which can not go wrong , have established the fact . ’
43032	43042	42946	42946	her	91	‘ I speak of my own life , father . ’
43043	43049	43051	43052	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ O indeed ? Still , ’
43054	43079	43051	43052	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ I need not point out to you , Louisa , that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate . ’
43080	43108	43109	43110	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ While it lasts , I would wish to do the little I can , and the little I am fit for . What does it matter ? ’
43125	43136	43109	43110	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ How , matter ? What matter , my dear ? ’
43137	43141	43142	43142	she	1056	‘ Mr. Bounderby , ’
43156	43199	43142	43142	she	1056	‘ asks me to marry him . The question I have to ask myself is , shall I marry him ? That is so , father , is it not ? You have told me so , father . Have you not ? ’
43200	43206	43142	43142	she	1056	‘ Certainly , my dear . ’
43207	43269	43142	43142	she	1056	‘ Let it be so . Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me thus , I am satisfied to accept his proposal . Tell him , father , as soon as you please , that this was my answer . Repeat it , word for word , if you can , because I should wish him to know what I said . ’
43270	43279	43281	43282	her father	335	‘ It is quite right , my dear , ’
43285	43314	43281	43282	her father	335	‘ to be exact . I will observe your very proper request . Have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage , my child ? ’
43315	43325	43326	43327	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ None , father . What does it matter ! ’
43377	43424	43361	43361	He	75	‘ Louisa , I have not considered it essential to ask you one question , because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote . But perhaps I ought to do so . You have never entertained in secret any other proposal ? ’
43425	43428	43429	43429	she	1057	‘ Father , ’
43435	43465	43429	43429	she	1057	‘ what other proposal can have been made to _ me _ ? Whom have I seen ? Where have I been ? What are my heart ’s experiences ? ’
43466	43471	43473	43474	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ My dear Louisa , ’
43480	43494	43361	43361	He	75	‘ You correct me justly . I merely wished to discharge my duty . ’

The baby - preference that even I have heard of as common among children , has never had its innocent resting - place in my breast . You have been so careful of me , that I never had a child ’s heart . You have trained me so well , that I never dreamed a child ’s dream . You have dealt so wisely with me , father , from my cradle to this hour , that I never had a child ’s belief or a child ’s fear . ’

Mr. Bounderby is a very remarkable man ; and what little disparity can be said to exist between you — if any — is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired . It has always been my object so to educate you , as that you might , while still in your early youth , be ( if I may so express myself ) almost any age . Kiss me once more , Louisa .

44313	44347	44311	44311	him	1069	’ Nobody present having any suggestion to offer in the remarkable emergency , Mrs. Gradgrind departed this life for the time being , after delivering the following codicil to her remarks already executed : ‘
44403	44487	44360	44360	I	0	’ When Mr. Gradgrind had presented Mrs. Bounderby , Sissy had suddenly turned her head , and looked , in wonder , in pity , in sorrow , in doubt , in a multitude of emotions , towards Louisa . Louisa had known it , and seen it , without looking at her . From that moment she was impassive , proud and cold — held Sissy at a distance — changed to her altogether .

Love was made on these occasions in the form of bracelets ; and , on all occasions during the period of betrothal , took a manufacturing aspect . Dresses were made , jewellery was made , cakes and gloves were made , settlements were made , and an extensive assortment of Facts did appropriate honour to the contract . The business was all Fact , from first to last . The Hours did not go through any of those rosy performances , which foolish poets have ascribed to them at such times ; neither did the clocks go any faster , or any slower , than at other seasons . The deadly statistical recorder in the Gradgrind observatory knocked every second on the head as it was born , and buried it with his accustomed regularity . So the day came , as all other days come to people who will only stick to reason ; and when it came , there were married in the church of the florid wooden legs — that popular order of architecture — Josiah Bounderby Esquire of Coketown , to Louisa eldest daughter of Thomas Gradgrind Esquire of Stone Lodge , M.P. for that borough . And when they were united in holy matrimony , they went home to breakfast at Stone Lodge aforesaid . There was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion , who knew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of , and how it was imported or exported , and in what quantities , and in what bottoms , whether native or foreign , and all about it . The bridesmaids , down to little Jane Gradgrind , were , in an intellectual point of view , fit helpmates for the calculating boy ; and there was no nonsense about any of the company . After breakfast , the bridegroom addressed them in the following terms : ‘
46760	46854	46744	46744	I	0	’ Shortly after which oration , as they were going on a nuptial trip to Lyons , in order that Mr. Bounderby might take the opportunity of seeing how the Hands got on in those parts , and whether they , too , required to be fed with gold spoons ; the happy pair departed for the railroad . The bride , in passing down - stairs , dressed for her journey , found Tom waiting for her — flushed , either with his feelings , or the vinous part of the breakfast . ‘
46873	46908	46871	46871	Loo	100	’ whispered Tom . She clung to him as she should have clung to some far better nature that day , and was a little shaken in her reserved composure for the first time . ‘
46915	46919	46871	46871	Loo	100	’ said Tom . ‘
46957	47360	46944	46944	I	0	’ * * * * * END OF THE FIRST BOOK BOOK THE SECOND _ REAPING _ CHAPTER I EFFECTS IN THE BANK A SUNNY midsummer day . There was such a thing sometimes , even in Coketown . Seen from a distance in such weather , Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of its own , which appeared impervious to the sun ’s rays . You only knew the town was there , because you knew there could have been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town . A blur of soot and smoke , now confusedly tending this way , now that way , now aspiring to the vault of Heaven , now murkily creeping along the earth , as the wind rose and fell , or changed its quarter : a dense formless jumble , with sheets of cross light in it , that showed nothing but masses of darkness:—Coketown in the distance was suggestive of itself , though not a brick of it could be seen . The wonder was , it was there at all . It had been ruined so often , that it was amazing how it had borne so many shocks . Surely there never was such fragile china - ware as that of which the millers of Coketown were made . Handle them never so lightly , and they fell to pieces with such ease that you might suspect them of having been flawed before . They were ruined , when they were required to send labouring children to school ; they were ruined when inspectors were appointed to look into their works ; they were ruined , when such inspectors considered it doubtful whether they were quite justified in chopping people up with their machinery ; they were utterly undone , when it was hinted that perhaps they need not always make quite so much smoke . Besides Mr. Bounderby ’s gold spoon which was generally received in Coketown , another prevalent fiction was very popular there . It took the form of a threat . Whenever a Coketowner felt he was ill - used — that is to say , whenever he was not left entirely alone , and it was proposed to hold him accountable for the consequences of any of his acts — he was sure to come out with the awful menace , that he would ‘
47369	48662	46944	46944	I	0	’ This had terrified the Home Secretary within an inch of his life , on several occasions . However , the Coketowners were so patriotic after all , that they never had pitched their property into the Atlantic yet , but , on the contrary , had been kind enough to take mighty good care of it . So there it was , in the haze yonder ; and it increased and multiplied . The streets were hot and dusty on the summer day , and the sun was so bright that it even shone through the heavy vapour drooping over Coketown , and could not be looked at steadily . Stokers emerged from low underground doorways into factory yards , and sat on steps , and posts , and palings , wiping their swarthy visages , and contemplating coals . The whole town seemed to be frying in oil . There was a stifling smell of hot oil everywhere . The steam - engines shone with it , the dresses of the Hands were soiled with it , the mills throughout their many stories oozed and trickled it . The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the breath of the simoom : and their inhabitants , wasting with heat , toiled languidly in the desert . But no temperature made the melancholy mad elephants more mad or more sane . Their wearisome heads went up and down at the same rate , in hot weather and cold , wet weather and dry , fair weather and foul . The measured motion of their shadows on the walls , was the substitute Coketown had to show for the shadows of rustling woods ; while , for the summer hum of insects , it could offer , all the year round , from the dawn of Monday to the night of Saturday , the whirr of shafts and wheels . Drowsily they whirred all through this sunny day , making the passenger more sleepy and more hot as he passed the humming walls of the mills . Sun - blinds , and sprinklings of water , a little cooled the main streets and the shops ; but the mills , and the courts and alleys , baked at a fierce heat . Down upon the river that was black and thick with dye , some Coketown boys who were at large — a rare sight there — rowed a crazy boat , which made a spumous track upon the water as it jogged along , while every dip of an oar stirred up vile smells . But the sun itself , however beneficent , generally , was less kind to Coketown than hard frost , and rarely looked intently into any of its closer regions without engendering more death than life . So does the eye of Heaven itself become an evil eye , when incapable or sordid hands are interposed between it and the things it looks upon to bless . Mrs. Sparsit sat in her afternoon apartment at the Bank , on the shadier side of the frying street . Office - hours were over : and at that period of the day , in warm weather , she usually embellished with her genteel presence , a managerial board - room over the public office . Her own private sitting - room was a story higher , at the window of which post of observation she was ready , every morning , to greet Mr. Bounderby , as he came across the road , with the sympathizing recognition appropriate to a Victim . He had been married now a year ; and Mrs. Sparsit had never released him from her determined pity a moment . The Bank offered no violence to the wholesome monotony of the town . It was another red brick house , with black outside shutters , green inside blinds , a black street - door up two white steps , a brazen door - plate , and a brazen door - handle full stop . It was a size larger than Mr. Bounderby ’s house , as other houses were from a size to half - a - dozen sizes smaller ; in all other particulars , it was strictly according to pattern . Mrs. Sparsit was conscious that by coming in the evening - tide among the desks and writing implements , she shed a feminine , not to say also aristocratic , grace upon the office . Seated , with her needlework or netting apparatus , at the window , she had a self - laudatory sense of correcting , by her ladylike deportment , the rude business aspect of the place . With this impression of her interesting character upon her , Mrs. Sparsit considered herself , in some sort , the Bank Fairy . The townspeople who , in their passing and repassing , saw her there , regarded her as the Bank Dragon keeping watch over the treasures of the mine . What those treasures were , Mrs. Sparsit knew as little as they did . Gold and silver coin , precious paper , secrets that if divulged would bring vague destruction upon vague persons ( generally , however , people whom she disliked ) , were the chief items in her ideal catalogue thereof . For the rest , she knew that after office - hours , she reigned supreme over all the office furniture , and over a locked - up iron room with three locks , against the door of which strong chamber the light porter laid his head every night , on a truckle bed , that disappeared at cockcrow . Further , she was lady paramount over certain vaults in the basement , sharply spiked off from communication with the predatory world ; and over the relics of the current day ’s work , consisting of blots of ink , worn - out pens , fragments of wafers , and scraps of paper torn so small , that nothing interesting could ever be deciphered on them when Mrs. Sparsit tried . Lastly , she was guardian over a little armoury of cutlasses and carbines , arrayed in vengeful order above one of the official chimney - pieces ; and over that respectable tradition never to be separated from a place of business claiming to be wealthy — a row of fire - buckets — vessels calculated to be of no physical utility on any occasion , but observed to exercise a fine moral influence , almost equal to bullion , on most beholders . A deaf serving - woman and the light porter completed Mrs. Sparsit ’s empire . The deaf serving - woman was rumoured to be wealthy ; and a saying had for years gone about among the lower orders of Coketown , that she would be murdered some night when the Bank was shut , for the sake of her money . It was generally considered , indeed , that she had been due some time , and ought to have fallen long ago ; but she had kept her life , and her situation , with an ill - conditioned tenacity that occasioned much offence and disappointment . Mrs. Sparsit ’s tea was just set for her on a pert little table , with its tripod of legs in an attitude , which she insinuated after office - hours , into the company of the stern , leathern - topped , long board - table that bestrode the middle of the room . The light porter placed the tea - tray on it , knuckling his forehead as a form of homage . ‘
48668	48673	48666	48666	Bitzer	77	’ said Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
48681	48713	48676	48676	you	1112	’ returned the light porter . He was a very light porter indeed ; as light as in the days when he blinkingly defined a horse , for girl number twenty . ‘
48721	48726	48719	48719	Bitzer	77	’ said Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
48734	48735	48732	48732	ma’am	350	’ ‘
48739	48749	48732	48732	ma’am	350	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , pouring out her tea , ‘
48759	48760	48763	48763	ma’am	350	’ ‘

48803	48808	48797	48799	the restless wretches	1120	’ asked Mrs. Sparsit . ‘

48841	48863	48819	48819	Uniting	156	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , making her nose more Roman and her eyebrows more Coriolanian in the strength of her severity , ‘
48876	48877	48865	48867	the united masters	1123	’ ‘
48882	48886	48865	48867	the united masters	1123	’ said Bitzer . ‘
48912	48917	48918	48918	They	1123	’ said Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
48925	48929	48918	48918	They	1123	’ returned Bitzer ; ‘
48938	48939	48936	48936	ma’am	350	’ ‘
48949	48957	48936	48936	ma’am	350	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , with dignity , ‘
49014	49015	49018	49018	ma’am	350	’ ‘
49020	49037	49018	49018	ma’am	350	’ returned Bitzer , with a demonstration of great respect for Mrs. Sparsit ’s oracular authority . ‘
49051	49122	49045	49045	I	0	’ As this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with Mrs. Sparsit , and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was going to ask him something , he made a pretence of arranging the rulers , inkstands , and so forth , while that lady went on with her tea , glancing through the open window , down into the street . ‘
49132	49137	49130	49130	Bitzer	77	’ asked Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
49152	49181	49182	49183	The clerks	1135	’ He now and then slided into my lady , instead of ma’am , as an involuntary acknowledgment of Mrs. Sparsit ’s personal dignity and claims to reverence . ‘
49185	49206	49182	49183	The clerks	1135	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , carefully brushing an imperceptible crumb of bread and butter from her left - hand mitten , ‘
49218	49219	49222	49222	ma’am	350	’ ‘
49234	49508	49512	49512	ma’am	350	’ He held the respectable office of general spy and informer in the establishment , for which volunteer service he received a present at Christmas , over and above his weekly wage . He had grown into an extremely clear - headed , cautious , prudent young man , who was safe to rise in the world . His mind was so exactly regulated , that he had no affections or passions . All his proceedings were the result of the nicest and coldest calculation ; and it was not without cause that Mrs. Sparsit habitually observed of him , that he was a young man of the steadiest principle she had ever known . Having satisfied himself , on his father ’s death , that his mother had a right of settlement in Coketown , this excellent young economist had asserted that right for her with such a steadfast adherence to the principle of the case , that she had been shut up in the workhouse ever since . It must be admitted that he allowed her half a pound of tea a year , which was weak in him : first , because all gifts have an inevitable tendency to pauperise the recipient , and secondly , because his only reasonable transaction in that commodity would have been to buy it for as little as he could possibly give , and sell it for as much as he could possibly get ; it having been clearly ascertained by philosophers that in this is comprised the whole duty of man — not a part of man ’s duty , but the whole . ‘
49521	49525	49519	49519	ma’am	350	’ repeated Bitzer . ‘
49530	49550	49551	49552	Mr. Thomas	75	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , shaking her head over her tea - cup , and taking a long gulp . ‘
49574	49575	49576	49576	Bitzer	77	’ ‘
49578	49589	49576	49576	Bitzer	77	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , in a very impressive manner , ‘
49602	49603	49591	49591	you	77	’ ‘
49626	49631	49649	49649	her	350	’re always best avoided . ’
49632	49643	49649	49649	her	350	‘ Please to remember that I have a charge here , ’
49654	49764	49766	49767	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ I hold a trust here , Bitzer , under Mr. Bounderby . However improbable both Mr. Bounderby and myself might have deemed it years ago , that he would ever become my patron , making me an annual compliment , I can not but regard him in that light . From Mr. Bounderby I have received every acknowledgment of my social station , and every recognition of my family descent , that I could possibly expect . More , far more . Therefore , to my patron I will be scrupulously true . And I do not consider , I will not consider , I can not consider , ’

49993	49998	50000	50001	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Ah — h ! ’

50103	50108	50110	50111	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Yes , Bitzer , ’
50113	50123	50110	50111	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ I have always pitied the delusion , always . ’
50124	50132	50134	50134	Bitzer	77	‘ As to an individual , ma’am , ’
50143	50185	50134	50134	Bitzer	77	‘ he is as improvident as any of the people in this town . And you know what _ their _ improvidence is , ma’am . No one could wish to know it better than a lady of your eminence does . ’
50186	50192	50194	50195	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ They would do well , ’
50197	50206	50194	50195	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ to take example by you , Bitzer . ’
50207	50268	50134	50134	Bitzer	77	‘ Thank you , ma’am . But , since you do refer to me , now look at me , ma’am . I have put by a little , ma’am , already . That gratuity which I receive at Christmas , ma’am : I never touch it . I do n’t even go the length of my wages , though they ’re
50296	50374	50284	50284	ma’am	350	’ This , again , was among the fictions of Coketown . Any capitalist there , who had made sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence , always professed to wonder why the sixty thousand nearest Hands did n’t each make sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence , and more or less reproached them every one for not accomplishing the little feat . What I did you can do . Why do n’t you go and do it ? ‘
50383	50387	50381	50381	ma’am	350	’ said Bitzer , ‘
50415	50492	50381	50381	ma’am	350	’em . As to their combining together ; there are many of them , I have no doubt , that by watching and informing upon one another could earn a trifle now and then , whether in money or good will , and improve their livelihood . Then , why do n’t they improve it , ma’am ! It ’s the first consideration of a rational creature , and it ’s what they pretend to want . ’
50493	50497	50499	50500	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Pretend indeed ! ’
50502	50525	50527	50527	Bitzer	77	‘ I am sure we are constantly hearing , ma’am , till it becomes quite nauseous , concerning their wives and families , ’

50551	50557	50559	50560	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Because they are improvident , ’
50562	50567	50569	50569	Bitzer	77	‘ Yes , ma’am , ’
50571	50639	50569	50569	Bitzer	77	‘ that ’s where it is . If they were more provident and less perverse , ma’am , what would they do ? They would say , “ While my hat covers my family , ” or “ while my bonnet covers my family,”—as the case might be , ma’am—“I have only one to feed , and that ’s the person I most like to feed . ” ’
50640	50645	50647	50648	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ To be sure , ’

51695	51774	51692	51693	the stranger	1163	‘ Much obliged to you for reminding me . I am the bearer of a letter of introduction to Mr. Bounderby , the banker . Walking through this extraordinarily black town , while they were getting dinner ready at the hotel , I asked a fellow whom I met ; one of the working people ; who appeared to have been taking a shower - bath of something fluffy , which I assume to be the raw material — ’
51781	51844	51778	51778	her	1168	‘ — Raw material — where Mr. Bounderby , the banker , might reside . Upon which , misled no doubt by the word Banker , he directed me to the Bank . Fact being , I presume , that Mr. Bounderby the Banker does _ not _ reside in the edifice in which I have the honour of offering this explanation ? ’
51845	51850	51852	51853	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ No , sir , ’
51855	51860	51852	51853	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ he does not . ’
51861	51902	51905	51905	he	1169	‘ Thank you . I had no intention of delivering my letter at the present moment , nor have I. But strolling on to the Bank to kill time , and having the good fortune to observe at the window , ’
51915	51965	51908	51908	his	1169	‘ a lady of a very superior and agreeable appearance , I considered that I could not do better than take the liberty of asking that lady where Mr. Bounderby the Banker _ does _ live . Which I accordingly venture , with all suitable apologies , to do . ’
52038	52053	52055	52063	the stranger , whose lightness and smoothness of speech	1171	‘ Banks , I know , are always suspicious , and officially must be , ’
52102	52136	52137	52138	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ therefore I may observe that my letter — here it is — is from the member for this place — Gradgrind — whom I have had the pleasure of knowing in London . ’

52212	52225	52173	52174	the stranger	1163	‘ Quite an eternity ! I think he married Gradgrind ’s daughter ? ’

52239	52246	52231	52232	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ he had that — honour . ’
52247	52259	52173	52174	the stranger	1163	‘ The lady is quite a philosopher , I am told ? ’
52260	52265	52267	52268	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Indeed , sir , ’
52270	52276	52267	52268	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ _ Is _ she ? ’
52277	52283	52285	52286	the stranger	1163	‘ Excuse my impertinent curiosity , ’
52300	52400	52285	52286	the stranger	1163	‘ but you know the family , and know the world . I am about to know the family , and may have much to do with them . Is the lady so very alarming ? Her father gives her such a portentously hard - headed reputation , that I have a burning desire to know . Is she absolutely unapproachable ? Repellently and stunningly clever ? I see , by your meaning smile , you think not . You have poured balm into my anxious soul . As to age , now . Forty ? Five and thirty ? ’
52406	52410	52412	52412	she	1177	‘ A chit , ’
52414	52422	52412	52412	she	1177	‘ Not twenty when she was married . ’

52444	52455	52439	52439	himself	1163	‘ that I never was so astonished in my life ! ’
52501	52509	52510	52510	he	1163	‘ I assure you , Mrs. Powler , ’
52517	52560	52561	52561	He	1163	‘ that the father ’s manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity . I am obliged to you , of all things , for correcting so absurd a mistake . Pray excuse my intrusion . Many thanks . Good day ! ’

52621	52633	52608	52608	she	1182	‘ Spends a deal of money on his dress , ma’am . ’
52634	52640	52642	52643	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ It must be admitted , ’
52645	52652	52642	52643	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ that it ’s very tasteful . ’

52699	52706	52708	52709	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ It ’s immoral to game , ’
52711	52718	52720	52720	Bitzer	77	‘ It ’s ridiculous , ma’am , ’
52722	52731	52720	52720	Bitzer	77	‘ because the chances are against the players . ’

53782	53829	53775	53775	Bounderby	96	‘ is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to . Therefore , if you will allow me — or whether you will or not , for I am a plain man — I’ll tell you something about it before we go any further . ’
53836	53845	53847	53847	Bounderby	96	‘ Do n’t be too sure of that , ’
53849	53926	53847	53847	Bounderby	96	‘ I do n’t promise it . First of all , you see our smoke . That ’s meat and drink to us . It ’s the healthiest thing in the world in all respects , and particularly for the lungs . If you are one of those who want us to consume it , I differ from you . We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear ’em

53948	53958	53959	53960	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ to the fullest extent , Mr. Harthouse rejoined , ‘
53979	53980	53981	53981	I	0	’ ‘
53988	53992	53981	53981	I	0	’ said Bounderby . ‘
54080	54088	54218	54219	Mr. Bounderby	92	’re not a - going to do . ’
54089	54096	54102	54102	Bounderby	92	‘ Mr. Bounderby , perfectly right . ’
54097	54100	54102	54102	Bounderby	92	‘ Lastly , ’
54104	54156	54102	54102	Bounderby	92	‘ as to our Hands . There ’s not a Hand in this town , sir , man , woman , or child , but has one ultimate object in life . That object is , to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon . Now , they ’re
54164	54187	54102	54102	Bounderby	92	’em — ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon . And now you know the place . ’
54210	54216	54218	54219	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ Why , you see , ’
54221	54338	54218	54219	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man , particularly with a public man , when I make his acquaintance . I have only one thing more to say to you , Mr. Harthouse , before assuring you of the pleasure with which I shall respond , to the utmost of my poor ability , to my friend Tom Gradgrind ’s letter of introduction . You are a man of family . Do n’t you deceive yourself by supposing for a moment that I am a man of family . I am a bit of dirty riff - raff , and a genuine scrap of tag , rag , and bobtail . ’
54366	54370	54372	54372	Bounderby	92	‘ So now , ’
54374	54458	54372	54372	Bounderby	92	‘ we may shake hands on equal terms . I say , equal terms , because although I know what I am , and the exact depth of the gutter I have lifted myself out of , better than any man does , I am as proud as you are . I am just as proud as you are . Having now asserted my independence in a proper manner , I may come to how do you find yourself , and I hope you ’re
54462	54492	54372	54372	Bounderby	92	’ The better , Mr. Harthouse gave him to understand as they shook hands , for the salubrious air of Coketown . Mr. Bounderby received the answer with favour . ‘
54497	54501	54494	54494	you	1238	’ said he , ‘
54544	54545	54546	54547	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ ‘
54549	54553	54554	54554	you	92	’ said Jem , ‘
54560	54776	54554	54554	you	92	’ They went out without further discourse ; and Mr. Bounderby piloted the new acquaintance who so strongly contrasted with him , to the private red brick dwelling , with the black outside shutters , the green inside blinds , and the black street door up the two white steps . In the drawing - room of which mansion , there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl Mr. James Harthouse had ever seen . She was so constrained , and yet so careless ; so reserved , and yet so watchful ; so cold and proud , and yet so sensitively ashamed of her husband ’s braggart humility — from which she shrunk as if every example of it were a cut or a blow ; that it was quite a new sensation to observe her . In face she was no less remarkable than in manner . Her features were handsome ; but their natural play was so locked up , that it seemed impossible to guess at their genuine expression . Utterly indifferent , perfectly self - reliant , never at a loss , and yet never at her ease , with her figure in company with them there , and her mind apparently quite alone — it was of no use ‘
54779	54903	54906	54906	sir	2713	’ yet awhile to comprehend this girl , for she baffled all penetration . From the mistress of the house , the visitor glanced to the house itself . There was no mute sign of a woman in the room . No graceful little adornment , no fanciful little device , however trivial , anywhere expressed her influence . Cheerless and comfortless , boastfully and doggedly rich , there the room stared at its present occupants , unsoftened and unrelieved by the least trace of any womanly occupation . As Mr. Bounderby stood in the midst of his household gods , so those unrelenting divinities occupied their places around Mr. Bounderby , and they were worthy of one another , and well matched . ‘
54908	54912	54906	54906	sir	2713	’ said Bounderby , ‘
55052	55078	55049	55050	Loo Bounderby	100	’ To a more agreeable adviser , or one from whom he would be more likely to learn , Mr. Harthouse could never be recommended . ‘

55418	55505	55413	55413	he	92	‘ upon my honour , no . I will make no such pretence to you . I have seen a little , here and there , up and down ; I have found it all to be very worthless , as everybody has , and as some confess they have , and some do not ; and I am going in for your respected father ’s opinions — really because I have no choice of opinions , and may as well back them as anything else . ’
55506	55514	55516	55516	Louisa	91	‘ Have you none of your own ? ’
55518	55627	55516	55516	Louisa	91	‘ I have not so much as the slightest predilection left . I assure you I attach not the least importance to any opinions . The result of the varieties of boredom I have undergone , is a conviction ( unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment I entertain on the subject ) , that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set , and just as much harm as any other set . There ’s an English family with a charming Italian motto . What will be , will be . It ’s the only truth going ! ’

I am quite as much attached to it as if I believed it . I am quite ready to go in for it , to the same extent as if I believed it . And what more could I possibly do , if I did believe it ! ’
55782	55789	55791	55791	Louisa	91	‘ You are a singular politician , ’
55793	55834	55791	55791	Louisa	91	‘ Pardon me ; I have not even that merit . We are the largest party in the state , I assure you , Mrs. Bounderby , if we all fell out of our adopted ranks and were reviewed together . ’

57777	57786	57788	57788	Tom	75	‘ You know our governor , Mr. Harthouse , ’
57790	57823	57788	57788	Tom	75	‘ and therefore , you need n’t be surprised that Loo married old Bounderby . She never had a lover , and the governor proposed old Bounderby , and she took him . ’
57824	57832	57834	57836	Mr. James Harthouse	162	‘ Very dutiful in your interesting sister , ’
57838	57860	57862	57863	the whelp	1268	‘ Yes , but she would n’t have been as dutiful , and it would not have come off as easily , ’
57865	57874	57862	57863	the whelp	1268	‘ if it had n’t been for me . ’
57891	57898	57899	57899	he	1268	‘ _ I _ persuaded her , ’
57909	57977	57899	57899	he	1268	‘ I was stuck into old Bounderby ’s bank ( where I never wanted to be ) , and I knew I should get into scrapes there , if she put old Bounderby ’s pipe out ; so I told her my wishes , and she came into them . She would do anything for me . It was very game of her , was n’t it ? ’
57978	57985	57862	57863	the whelp	1268	‘ It was charming , Tom ! ’
57986	58002	58004	58004	Tom	75	‘ Not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me , ’
58007	58071	58004	58004	Tom	75	‘ because my liberty and comfort , and perhaps my getting on , depended on it ; and she had no other lover , and staying at home was like staying in jail — especially when I was gone . It was n’t as if she gave up another lover for old Bounderby ; but still it was a good thing in her . ’
58072	58083	57862	57863	the whelp	1268	‘ Perfectly delightful . And she gets on so placidly . ’
58084	58087	58089	58089	Tom	75	‘ Oh , ’
58095	58180	58089	58089	Tom	75	‘ she ’s a regular girl . A girl can get on anywhere . She has settled down to the life , and _ she _ do n’t mind . It does just as well as another . Besides , though Loo is a girl , she ’s not a common sort of girl . She can shut herself up within herself , and think — as I have often known her sit and watch the fire — for an hour at a stretch . ’
58181	58192	58194	58194	Harthouse	162	‘ Ay , ay ? Has resources of her own , ’
58199	58210	58212	58212	Tom	75	‘ Not so much of that as you may suppose , ’
58214	58235	58212	58212	Tom	75	‘ for our governor had her crammed with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust . It ’s his system . ’
58236	58245	58247	58247	Harthouse	162	‘ Formed his daughter on his own model ? ’
58249	58267	58269	58269	Tom	75	‘ His daughter ? Ah ! and everybody else . Why , he formed Me that way ! ’
58271	58274	58269	58269	Tom	75	‘ Impossible ! ’
58275	58281	58283	58283	Tom	75	‘ He did , though , ’
58289	58333	58286	58286	his	75	‘ I mean to say , Mr. Harthouse , that when I first left home and went to old Bounderby ’s , I was as flat as a warming - pan , and knew no more about life , than any oyster does . ’
58334	58351	58269	58269	Tom	75	‘ Come , Tom ! I can hardly believe that . A joke ’s a joke . ’
58352	58357	58359	58360	the whelp	1268	‘ Upon my soul ! ’

58394	58424	58372	58372	He	75	‘ Oh ! I have picked up a little since . I do n’t deny that . But I have done it myself ; no thanks to the governor . ’
58425	58431	58269	58269	Tom	75	‘ And your intelligent sister ? ’
58432	58487	58488	58488	he	75	‘ My intelligent sister is about where she was . She used to complain to me that she had nothing to fall back upon , that girls usually fall back upon ; and I do n’t see how she is to have got over that since . But _ she _ do n’t mind , ’
58498	58507	58488	58488	he	75	‘ Girls can always get on , somehow . ’
58508	58539	58541	58543	Mr. James Harthouse	162	‘ Calling at the Bank yesterday evening , for Mr. Bounderby ’s address , I found an ancient lady there , who seems to entertain great admiration for your sister , ’
58560	58564	58566	58566	Tom	75	‘ Mother Sparsit ! ’
58568	58580	58566	58566	Tom	75	‘ What ! you have seen her already , have you ? ’
58622	58638	58640	58640	Tom	75	‘ Mother Sparsit ’s feeling for Loo is more than admiration , I should think , ’
58642	58665	58640	58640	Tom	75	‘ Say affection and devotion . Mother Sparsit never set her cap at Bounderby when he was a bachelor . Oh no ! ’

Slackbridge , the orator , looked about him with a withering smile ; and , holding out his right hand at arm ’s length ( as the manner of all Slackbridges is ) , to still the thundering sea , waited until there was a profound silence . ‘

He was pale and a little moved in the face — his lips especially showed it ; but he stood quiet , with his left hand at his chin , waiting to be heard . There was a chairman to regulate the proceedings , and this functionary now took the case into his own hands . ‘

To repent of his determination , would be to take a load from all their minds . He looked around him , and knew that it was so . Not a grain of anger with them was in his heart ; he knew them , far below their surface weaknesses and misconceptions , as no one but their fellow - labourer could . ‘

Not a sound was audible in the building , but the slight rustle of men moving a little apart , all along the centre of the room , to open a means of passing out , to the man with whom they had all bound themselves to renounce companionship . Looking at no one , and going his way with a lowly steadiness upon him that asserted nothing and sought nothing , Old Stephen , with all his troubles on his head , left the scene . Then Slackbridge , who had kept his oratorical arm extended during the going out , as if he were repressing with infinite solicitude and by a wonderful moral power the vehement passions of the multitude , applied himself to raising their spirits . Had not the Roman Brutus , oh , my British countrymen , condemned his son to death ; and had not the Spartan mothers , oh my soon to be victorious friends , driven their flying children on the points of their enemies ’

62606	62615	62604	62604	Stephen	137	’ said Bounderby , in his windy manner , ‘
62643	62708	62711	62717	the man I was telling you about	1415	’ It was into the drawing - room that he was thus bidden . A tea - table was set out ; and Mr. Bounderby ’s young wife , and her brother , and a great gentleman from London , were present . To whom Stephen made his obeisance , closing the door and standing near it , with his hat in his hand . ‘

62768	62772	62711	62717	the man I was telling you about	1415	’ said Bounderby , ‘
62776	62824	62711	62717	the man I was telling you about	1415	’ After the four days he had passed , this address fell rudely and discordantly on Stephen ’s ear . Besides being a rough handling of his wounded mind , it seemed to assume that he really was the self - interested deserter he had been called . ‘
62831	62835	62829	62829	sir	2713	’ said Stephen , ‘

You shall hear me ask this man a question . Pray , Mr. Blackpool’—wind springing up very fast—‘may I take the liberty of asking you how it happens that you refused to be in this Combination ? ’

65647	65686	65644	65645	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ that you are one of those chaps who have always got a grievance . And you go about , sowing it and raising crops . That ’s the business of _ your _ life , my friend . ’
65706	65723	65725	65726	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ You are such a waspish , raspish , ill - conditioned chap , you see , ’
65728	65789	65725	65726	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ that even your own Union , the men who know you best , will have nothing to do with you . I never thought those fellows could be right in anything ; but I tell you what ! I so far go along with them for a novelty , that _ I_’ll have nothing to do with you either . ’

66112	66133	66135	66137	the old woman	901	‘ Why , I come to be with this good lass pretty much as I came to be with you , ’
66147	66214	66135	66137	the old woman	901	‘ My visiting time is later this year than usual , for I have been rather troubled with shortness of breath , and so put it off till the weather was fine and warm . For the same reason I do n’t make all my journey in one day , but divide it into two days , and get a bed to - night at the Travellers ’
66256	66289	66290	66292	the old woman	901	’m going to tell you . I have heard of Mr. Bounderby being married . I read it in the paper , where it looked grand — oh , it looked fine ! ’
66300	66390	66392	66394	the old woman	901	‘ and I want to see his wife . I have never seen her yet . Now , if you ’ll believe me , she has n’t come out of that house since noon to - day . So not to give her up too easily , I was waiting about , a little last bit more , when I passed close to this good lass two or three times ; and her face being so friendly I spoke to her , and she spoke to me . There ! ’
66398	66421	66392	66394	the old woman	901	‘ you can make all the rest out for yourself now , a deal shorter than I can , I dare say ! ’
66483	66488	66490	66490	he	137	‘ Well , missus , ’

66598	66608	66591	66591	She	441	’ returned the old woman . Stephen nodded assent . ‘
66614	66623	66612	66612	master	2922	’ said he , glancing again at Rachael , ‘

66640	66649	66651	66651	Rachael	140	‘ Have you left his work , Stephen ? ’
66657	66662	66663	66663	he	3244	‘ Why , Rachael , ’

66740	66762	66651	66651	Rachael	140	’ tis a kindness to myseln ; anyways it mun be done . I mun turn my face fro Coketown fur th ’

66791	66812	66787	66787	I	0	’ said he , lifting off his hat , and smoothing his thin hair with the flat of his hand . ‘

66847	66972	66973	66973	I	0	’ Herein , too , the sense of even thinking unselfishly aided him . Before he had so much as closed Mr. Bounderby ’s door , he had reflected that at least his being obliged to go away was good for her , as it would save her from the chance of being brought into question for not withdrawing from him . Though it would cost him a hard pang to leave her , and though he could think of no similar place in which his condemnation would not pursue him , perhaps it was almost a relief to be forced away from the endurance of the last four days , even to unknown difficulties and distresses . So he said , with truth , ‘
66974	66981	66973	66973	I	0	’m more leetsome , Rachael , under ’
66990	67133	66985	66985	I	0	’ It was not her part to make his burden heavier . She answered with her comforting smile , and the three walked on together . Age , especially when it strives to be self - reliant and cheerful , finds much consideration among the poor . The old woman was so decent and contented , and made so light of her infirmities , though they had increased upon her since her former interview with Stephen , that they both took an interest in her . She was too sprightly to allow of their walking at a slow pace on her account , but she was very grateful to be talked to , and very willing to talk to any extent : so , when they came to their part of the town , she was more brisk and vivacious than ever . ‘
67142	67146	67140	67140	missus	3363	’ said Stephen , ‘

67195	67457	67180	67180	Rachael	140	’ They complied , and the three went on to the house where he lodged . When they turned into a narrow street , Stephen glanced at his window with a dread that always haunted his desolate home ; but it was open , as he had left it , and no one was there . The evil spirit of his life had flitted away again , months ago , and he had heard no more of her since . The only evidence of her last return now , were the scantier moveables in his room , and the grayer hair upon his head . He lighted a candle , set out his little tea - board , got hot water from below , and brought in small portions of tea and sugar , a loaf , and some butter from the nearest shop . The bread was new and crusty , the butter fresh , and the sugar lump , of course — in fulfilment of the standard testimony of the Coketown magnates , that these people lived like princes , sir . Rachael made the tea ( so large a party necessitated the borrowing of a cup ) , and the visitor enjoyed it mightily . It was the first glimpse of sociality the host had had for many days . He too , with the world a wide heath before him , enjoyed the meal — again in corroboration of the magnates , as exemplifying the utter want of calculation on the part of these people , sir . ‘
67466	67470	67464	67464	missus	3363	’ said Stephen , ‘

67981	67992	67977	67979	the old woman	901	‘ Let me be quite to myself in this corner . ’
68393	68430	68382	68382	she	91	‘ I have come to speak to you , in consequence of what passed just now . I should like to be serviceable to you , if you will let me . Is this your wife ? ’

68686	68693	68615	68615	Rachael	140	‘ The name of being troublesome . ’
68694	68741	68742	68742	Rachael	140	‘ Then , by the prejudices of his own class , and by the prejudices of the other , he is sacrificed alike ? Are the two so deeply separated in this town , that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them ? ’

He was at the bottom when she began to descend , and was in the street before she could take his arm . Mrs. Pegler remained in her corner until the brother and sister were gone , and until Stephen came back with the candle in his hand . She was in a state of inexpressible admiration of Mrs. Bounderby , and , like an unaccountable old woman , wept , ‘

The only difference between us and the professors of virtue or benevolence , or philanthropy — never mind the name — is , that we know it is all meaningless , and say so ; while they know it equally and will never say so . ’

This country , gradually softening towards the neighbourhood of Mr. Bounderby ’s retreat , there mellowed into a rustic landscape , golden with heath , and snowy with hawthorn in the spring of the year , and tremulous with leaves and their shadows all the summer time . The bank had foreclosed a mortgage effected on the property thus pleasantly situated , by one of the Coketown magnates , who , in his determination to make a shorter cut than usual to an enormous fortune , overspeculated himself by about two hundred thousand pounds . These accidents did sometimes happen in the best regulated families of Coketown , but the bankrupts had no connexion whatever with the improvident classes . It afforded Mr. Bounderby supreme satisfaction to instal himself in this snug little estate , and with demonstrative humility to grow cabbages in the flower - garden . He delighted to live , barrack - fashion , among the elegant furniture , and he bullied the very pictures with his origin . ‘
72719	72727	72717	72717	sir	2713	’ he would say to a visitor , ‘

Went to Westminster School as a King ’s Scholar , when I was principally living on garbage , and sleeping in market baskets . Why , if I wanted to keep a dozen horses — which I do n’t , for one ’s enough for me — I could n’t bear to see ’em
73046	73053	72945	72945	he	183	’em , sir , and not order ’em
73197	73244	73245	73246	Mrs. Bounderby	92	’ It was among the leafy shadows of this retirement , in the long sultry summer days , that Mr. Harthouse began to prove the face which had set him wondering when he first saw it , and to try if it would change for him . ‘
73276	73361	73262	73262	I	0	’ It was not by any wonderful accident that he found her , the time of day being that at which she was always alone , and the place being her favourite resort . It was an opening in a dark wood , where some felled trees lay , and where she would sit watching the fallen leaves of last year , as she had watched the falling ashes at home . He sat down beside her , with a glance at her face . ‘
73370	73386	73368	73368	Tom	75	’ Her colour brightened , and she turned to him with a look of interest . ‘

73835	73866	73832	73833	Mrs. Bounderby	92	’ he resumed , in a lighter manner , and yet with a show of effort in assuming it , which was even more expressive than the manner he dismissed ; ‘

74090	74109	74053	74053	I	0	’ said James Harthouse , again gliding with the same appearance of effort into his more airy manner ; ‘

74435	74502	74421	74421	I	0	’ Either she saw in his face that he knew , or she only feared in her conscience that he knew , that she spoke of some of her husband ’s gifts . She stopped , and reddened again . If he had not known it before , he would have known it then , though he had been a much duller man than he was . ‘
74639	74675	74632	74632	you	1664	’ She abruptly broke off . He was a ready man , and he saw , and seized , an opportunity here of presenting her own image to her , slightly disguised as her brother . ‘
74877	74915	74866	74866	I	0	’ As she sat looking straight before her , across the changing lights upon the grass into the darkness of the wood beyond , he saw in her face her application of his very distinctly uttered words . ‘

74956	74973	74949	74949	I	0	’ Louisa turned her eyes to his face , and asked him what fault was that ? ‘

75176	75216	75230	75231	Mrs. Bounderby	92	’ The wood floated before her , for her eyes were suffused with tears . They rose from a deep well , long concealed , and her heart was filled with acute pain that found no relief in them . ‘
75352	75374	75346	75346	Yonder	184	’ he added , having lifted up his eyes and looked about ; for he had watched her closely until now ; ‘
75461	75530	75531	75531	Halloa	103	’ He assisted her to rise , and she took his arm , and they advanced to meet the whelp . He was idly beating the branches as he lounged along : or he stooped viciously to rip the moss from the trees with his stick . He was startled when they came upon him while he was engaged in this latter pastime , and his colour changed . ‘
75533	75537	75531	75531	Halloa	103	’ he stammered ; ‘

75741	75757	75728	75728	you	75	’ said Louisa , showing no other sense of his discontent and ill - nature . ‘
75768	75774	75766	75766	Loo	100	’ returned her brother sulkily . ‘
75784	75785	75786	75786	Tom	75	’ ‘

75932	75997	75998	75998	Tom	75	’ They walked on to the house , where Louisa quitted her visitor ’s arm and went in . He stood looking after her , as she ascended the steps , and passed into the shadow of the door ; then put his hand upon her brother ’s shoulder again , and invited him with a confidential nod to a walk in the garden . ‘
76013	76100	76101	76101	Tom	75	’ They had stopped among a disorder of roses — it was part of Mr. Bounderby ’s humility to keep Nickits ’s roses on a reduced scale — and Tom sat down on a terrace - parapet , plucking buds and picking them to pieces ; while his powerful Familiar stood over him , with a foot upon the parapet , and his figure easily resting on the arm supported by that knee . They were just visible from her window . Perhaps she saw them . ‘
76108	76109	76101	76101	Tom	75	’ ‘
76115	76122	76112	76113	Mr. Harthouse	162	’ said Tom with a groan , ‘

76203	76247	76248	76248	Tom	75	’ He took to biting the rosebuds now , and tearing them away from his teeth with a hand that trembled like an infirm old man ’s . After one exceedingly observant look at him , his companion relapsed into his lightest air . ‘
76277	76278	76262	76262	You	75	’ ‘
76389	76412	76417	76417	Tom	75	’ He was almost crying , and scattered the buds about by dozens . Mr. Harthouse took him persuasively by the coat . ‘

76625	76705	76619	76619	I	0	’ There was a piece of ornamental water immediately below the parapet , on the other side , into which Mr. James Harthouse had a very strong inclination to pitch Mr. Thomas Gradgrind junior , as the injured men of Coketown threatened to pitch their property into the Atlantic . But he preserved his easy attitude ; and nothing more solid went over the stone balustrades than the accumulated rosebuds now floating about , a little surface - island . ‘
76710	76714	76619	76619	I	0	’ said Harthouse , ‘

76743	76836	76716	76716	me	0	’ And very white he looked , in contrast with the roses . Very white . Mr. Harthouse , as a thoroughly well - bred man , accustomed to the best society , was not to be surprised — he could as soon have been affected — but he raised his eyelids a little more , as if they were lifted by a feeble touch of wonder . Albeit it was as much against the precepts of his school to wonder , as it was against the doctrines of the Gradgrind College . ‘
76857	76858	76859	76860	Mr. Harthouse	162	’ ‘
76862	76886	76859	76860	Mr. Harthouse	162	’ returned Tom , now actually crying ; and his tears were better than his injuries , however pitiful a figure he made : ‘
76926	76931	76943	76944	Mr. Harthouse	162	’re a true friend . ’
76936	76941	76943	76944	Mr. Harthouse	162	‘ Whelp , whelp ! ’
76948	76955	76943	76944	Mr. Harthouse	162	‘ what an Ass you are ! ’
76956	76967	76969	76969	Tom	75	‘ And I take your offer as a great kindness , ’
76975	76984	76969	76969	Tom	75	‘ As a great kindness , Mr. Harthouse . ’

76993	77041	76990	76991	the other	1294	‘ it may be of more use by and by . And , my good fellow , if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you , I may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself . ’
77042	77046	77048	77048	Tom	75	‘ Thank you , ’
77059	77071	77048	77048	Tom	75	‘ I wish I had known you sooner , Mr. Harthouse . ’
77072	77080	77082	77083	Mr. Harthouse	162	‘ Now , you see , Tom , ’
77121	77149	77087	77087	himself	162	‘ every man is selfish in everything he does , and I am exactly like the rest of my fellow - creatures . I am desperately intent ; ’

77230	77238	77240	77240	Harthouse	162	‘ Having made which bargain , Tom , ’
77286	77297	77261	77261	he	162	‘ we will tear ourselves asunder until dinner - time . ’
77327	77338	77339	77339	he	92	‘ I did n’t mean to be cross , Loo , ’

78108	78126	78127	78128	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ I have heard you , and so has this brute . I have heard nothing else . ’

78241	78265	78267	78267	Bounderby	92	‘ Oh ! as a sum — if you stick to a sum — of not more than a hundred and fifty pound , ’
78272	78310	78267	78267	Bounderby	92	‘ But it ’s not the sum ; it ’s the fact . It ’s the fact of the Bank being robbed , that ’s the important circumstance . I am surprised you do n’t see it . ’
78311	78316	78318	78318	James	162	‘ My dear Bounderby , ’
78330	78395	78318	78318	James	162	‘ I _ do _ see it ; and am as overcome as you can possibly desire me to be , by the spectacle afforded to my mental view . Nevertheless , I may be allowed , I hope , to congratulate you — which I do with all my soul , I assure you — on your not having sustained a greater loss . ’
78396	78399	78401	78401	Bounderby	92	‘ Thank’ee , ’
78410	78425	78401	78401	Bounderby	92	‘ But I tell you what . It might have been twenty thousand pound . ’

78913	78945	78900	78900	I	0	’ Bitzer knuckled his forehead again , in a sneaking manner , and seemed at once particularly impressed and depressed by the instance last given of Mr. Bounderby ’s moral abstinence . ‘
78953	78958	78900	78900	I	0	’ resumed Mr. Bounderby . ‘
79016	79017	79018	79018	Sir	2713	’ ‘
79020	79025	79018	79018	Sir	2713	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
79100	79114	79116	79116	I	0	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , with a lofty sense of giving strict evidence , ‘
79154	79155	79147	79147	I	0	’ ‘
79158	79164	79166	79166	he	1748	’ said the exasperated Bounderby , ‘

79350	79357	79358	79358	He	75	’ asked Harthouse , glancing round . ‘
79365	79369	79358	79358	He	75	’ said Bounderby , ‘
79414	79417	79411	79411	I	0	’em that . ’
79418	79423	79439	79439	Bounderby	92	‘ Is anybody suspected ? ’
79424	79437	79439	79439	Bounderby	92	‘ Suspected ? I should think there was somebody suspected . Egod ! ’
79452	79471	79442	79443	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Josiah Bounderby of Coketown is not to be plundered and nobody suspected . No , thank you ! ’
79480	79483	79485	79485	Bounderby	96	‘ Well , ’
79496	79530	79485	79485	Bounderby	96	‘ I ’ll tell you . It ’s not to be mentioned everywhere ; it ’s not to be mentioned anywhere : in order that the scoundrels concerned ( there ’s a gang of ’em
79550	79558	79561	79561	you	162	’ Mr. Bounderby wiped his head again . ‘
79565	79571	79561	79561	you	162	’ here he violently exploded : ‘
79579	79580	79581	79581	I	0	’ ‘
79584	79590	79581	79581	I	0	’ said Harthouse , lazily , ‘
79596	79597	79594	79594	Blackpot	187	’ ‘
79606	79610	79604	79604	sir	2713	’ returned Bounderby , ‘
79617	79628	79614	79615	the man	3010	’ Louisa faintly uttered some word of incredulity and surprise . ‘
79635	79645	79646	79646	I	0	’ said Bounderby , immediately catching at the sound . ‘
79734	79759	79726	79726	I	0	’ Another of the popular fictions of Coketown , which some pains had been taken to disseminate — and which some people really believed . ‘
79768	79772	79761	79761	I	0	’ said Bounderby . ‘
79776	79891	79946	79947	Mrs. Sparsit	92	’em off , like books . Mrs. Sparsit , ma’am , I appeal to you . What warning did I give that fellow , the first time he set foot in the house , when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock Religion over , and floor the Established Church ? Mrs. Sparsit , in point of high connexions , you are on a level with the aristocracy,—did I say , or did I not say , to that fellow , “ you ca n’t hide the truth from me : you are not the kind of fellow I like ; you ’ll come to no good ” ? ’
79892	79897	79899	79900	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Assuredly , sir , ’
79902	79918	79899	79900	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ you did , in a highly impressive manner , give him such an admonition . ’
79919	79927	79929	79929	Bounderby	92	‘ When he shocked you , ma’am , ’
79931	79938	79929	79929	Bounderby	92	‘ when he shocked your feelings ? ’
79939	79944	79946	79947	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Yes , sir , ’
79957	80004	79954	79954	her	1775	‘ he certainly did so . Though I do not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such points — more foolish if the term is preferred — than they might have been , if I had always occupied my present position . ’
80022	80041	80013	80014	Mr. Harthouse	162	‘ I am the proprietor of this female , and she ’s worth your attention , I think . ’
80048	80081	80045	80045	his	92	‘ You can recall for yourself , Harthouse , what I said to him when you saw him . I did n’t mince the matter with him . I am never mealy with ’em
80085	80146	80147	80148	Mr. Bounderby	92	’em . Very well , sir . Three days after that , he bolted . Went off , nobody knows where : as my mother did in my infancy — only with this difference , that he is a worse subject than my mother , if possible . What did he do before he went ? What do you say ; ’
80178	80248	80151	80151	his	92	‘ to his being seen — night after night — watching the Bank?—to his lurking about there — after dark?—To its striking Mrs. Sparsit — that he could be lurking for no good — To her calling Bitzer ’s attention to him , and their both taking notice of him — And to its appearing on inquiry to - day — that he was also noticed by the neighbours ? ’
80270	80273	80275	80276	James Harthouse	162	‘ Suspicious , ’
80278	80281	80275	80276	James Harthouse	162	‘ certainly . ’
80282	80289	80291	80291	Bounderby	92	‘ I think so , sir , ’
80298	80308	80291	80291	Bounderby	92	‘ I think so . But there are more of ’em
80429	80450	80399	80399	she	440	’ There was such a person in the room that night , and she shrunk from observation , thought Louisa . ‘
80456	80463	80399	80399	she	440	’em , even as we already know ’em
80465	80476	80399	80399	she	440	’ said Bounderby , with many nods of hidden meaning . ‘
80512	80519	80399	80399	she	440	’em . It ’s policy to give ’em
80531	80532	80399	80399	she	440	’ ‘
80554	80559	80588	80588	Banks	160	’ replied James Harthouse , ‘
80590	80625	80630	80631	Loo Bounderby	100	’ He had gently taken Louisa ’s parasol from her hand , and had put it up for her ; and she walked under its shade , though the sun did not shine there . ‘
80633	80638	80630	80631	Loo Bounderby	100	’ said her husband , ‘
80674	80675	80677	80677	you	100	’ ‘
80683	80689	80681	80681	sir	2713	’ that discreet lady observed , ‘
80707	80794	80798	80798	my	0	’ It soon appeared that if Mrs. Sparsit had a failing in her association with that domestic establishment , it was that she was so excessively regardless of herself and regardful of others , as to be a nuisance . On being shown her chamber , she was so dreadfully sensible of its comforts as to suggest the inference that she would have preferred to pass the night on the mangle in the laundry . True , the Powlers and the Scadgerses were accustomed to splendour , ‘
80803	80824	80798	80798	my	0	’ Mrs. Sparsit was fond of observing with a lofty grace : particularly when any of the domestics were present , ‘
80837	80841	80843	80843	I	0	’ said she , ‘
80908	80941	80894	80894	I	0	’ The same Hermitical state of mind led to her renunciation of made dishes and wines at dinner , until fairly commanded by Mr. Bounderby to take them ; when she said , ‘
80950	80968	80943	80943	you	1792	’ and departed from a resolution of which she had made rather formal and public announcement , to ‘
80975	81100	80894	80894	I	0	’ She was likewise deeply apologetic for wanting the salt ; and , feeling amiably bound to bear out Mr. Bounderby to the fullest extent in the testimony he had borne to her nerves , occasionally sat back in her chair and silently wept ; at which periods a tear of large dimensions , like a crystal ear - ring , might be observed ( or rather , must be , for it insisted on public notice ) sliding down her Roman nose . But Mrs. Sparsit ’s greatest point , first and last , was her determination to pity Mr. Bounderby . There were occasions when in looking at him she was involuntarily moved to shake her head , as who would say , ‘
81106	81136	81104	81104	Yorick	191	’ After allowing herself to be betrayed into these evidences of emotion , she would force a lambent brightness , and would be fitfully cheerful , and would say , ‘
81151	81196	81137	81137	You	1792	’ and would appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that Mr. Bounderby bore up as he did . One idiosyncrasy for which she often apologized , she found it excessively difficult to conquer . She had a curious propensity to call Mrs. Bounderby ‘
81200	81302	81197	81198	Miss Gradgrind	127	’ and yielded to it some three or four score times in the course of the evening . Her repetition of this mistake covered Mrs. Sparsit with modest confusion ; but indeed , she said , it seemed so natural to say Miss Gradgrind : whereas , to persuade herself that the young lady whom she had had the happiness of knowing from a child could be really and truly Mrs. Bounderby , she found almost impossible . It was a further singularity of this remarkable case , that the more she thought about it , the more impossible it appeared ; ‘
81306	81310	81197	81198	Miss Gradgrind	127	’ she observed , ‘
81314	81390	81197	81198	Miss Gradgrind	127	’ In the drawing - room after dinner , Mr. Bounderby tried the case of the robbery , examined the witnesses , made notes of the evidence , found the suspected persons guilty , and sentenced them to the extreme punishment of the law . That done , Bitzer was dismissed to town with instructions to recommend Tom to come home by the mail - train . When candles were brought , Mrs. Sparsit murmured , ‘
81413	81449	81408	81408	I	0	’ Mr. Bounderby , upon whom these consolations had begun to produce the effect of making him , in a bull - headed blundering way , sentimental , sighed like some large sea - animal . ‘
81461	81466	81459	81459	sir	2713	’ said Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
81491	81492	81493	81493	I	0	’ ‘
81501	81506	81493	81493	I	0	’ said Mr. Bounderby , ‘

81517	81524	81493	81493	I	0	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , soothingly , ‘
81558	81632	81554	81554	you	2713	’ They played near a window , opening on the garden . It was a fine night : not moonlight , but sultry and fragrant . Louisa and Mr. Harthouse strolled out into the garden , where their voices could be heard in the stillness , though not what they said . Mrs. Sparsit , from her place at the backgammon board , was constantly straining her eyes to pierce the shadows without . ‘
81640	81645	81638	81638	ma’am	350	’ said Mr. Bounderby ; ‘
81656	81657	81654	81654	you	350	’ ‘
81664	81669	81662	81662	sir	2713	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
81677	81678	81670	81670	I	0	’ ‘
81691	81696	81681	81681	you	350	’ said Mr. Bounderby . ‘
81704	81709	81702	81702	sir	2713	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
81720	81721	81714	81715	Miss Gradgrind	127	’ ‘
81727	81732	81735	81735	sir	2713	’ said Mr. Bounderby . ‘
81737	81768	81735	81735	sir	2713	’ said Mrs. Sparsit . And was affected with a cough in her throat . When the time drew near for retiring , Mr. Bounderby took a glass of water . ‘
81773	81778	81771	81771	sir	2713	’ said Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
81791	81792	81771	81771	sir	2713	’ ‘
81809	81814	81795	81795	I	0	’ said Mr. Bounderby . ‘
81823	81828	81795	81795	I	0	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit ; ‘
81865	81892	81850	81850	I	0	’ Miss Gradgrind readily permitting Mrs. Sparsit to do anything she pleased , that considerate lady made the beverage , and handed it to Mr. Bounderby . ‘
81923	81930	81931	81931	Your	2713	’ And when Mr. Bounderby said , ‘
81936	81943	81947	81947	sir	2713	’ she answered with great feeling , ‘
81958	82255	82256	82256	Tom	75	’ Finally , she wished him good night , with great pathos ; and Mr. Bounderby went to bed , with a maudlin persuasion that he had been crossed in something tender , though he could not , for his life , have mentioned what it was . Long after Louisa had undressed and lain down , she watched and waited for her brother ’s coming home . That could hardly be , she knew , until an hour past midnight ; but in the country silence , which did anything but calm the trouble of her thoughts , time lagged wearily . At last , when the darkness and stillness had seemed for hours to thicken one another , she heard the bell at the gate . She felt as though she would have been glad that it rang on until daylight ; but it ceased , and the circles of its last sound spread out fainter and wider in the air , and all was dead again . She waited yet some quarter of an hour , as she judged . Then she arose , put on a loose robe , and went out of her room in the dark , and up the staircase to her brother ’s room . His door being shut , she softly opened it and spoke to him , approaching his bed with a noiseless step . She kneeled down beside it , passed her arm over his neck , and drew his face to hers . She knew that he only feigned to be asleep , but she said nothing to him . He started by and by as if he were just then awakened , and asked who that was , and what was the matter ? ‘
82288	82289	82290	82290	I	0	’ ‘
82305	82306	82307	82307	My	0	’ ‘
82311	82339	82307	82307	My	0	’ she laid her head down on his pillow , and her hair flowed over him as if she would hide him from every one but herself : ‘
82379	82380	82372	82372	Tom	75	’ ‘
82391	82392	82386	82386	you	75	’ ‘
82477	82478	82469	82469	Tom	75	’ ‘
82487	82488	82489	82489	You	75	’ ‘
82494	82514	82489	82489	You	75	’ in the energy of her love she took him to her bosom as if he were a child ; ‘
82575	82590	82573	82573	you	75	’ She turned her ear to his lips , but he remained doggedly silent . ‘
82597	82598	82573	82573	you	75	’ ‘
82660	82661	82662	82662	You	75	’ ‘
82666	82677	82662	82662	You	75	’ she whispered presently , more in her usual way . ‘
82686	82687	82688	82688	You	75	’ ‘
82706	82707	82724	82724	you	75	’ ‘

82797	82808	82810	82810	I	0	’ He was very quick upon her with this retort . ‘
82819	82837	82810	82810	I	0	’ said his sister , standing by the bed — she had gradually withdrawn herself and risen , ‘
82854	82855	82850	82850	I	0	’ ‘
82861	82866	82859	82859	Loo	100	’ returned her brother , ‘
82910	82936	82937	82937	Tom	75	’ It was too dark for either to see the other ’s face ; but each seemed very attentive , and to consider before speaking . ‘
82957	82958	82959	82959	I	0	’ ‘
82974	82975	82964	82964	I	0	’ ‘

83000	83013	82986	82987	Another person	1830	’ There was a pause , for he had hesitated and stopped . ‘
83017	83030	82986	82987	Another person	1830	’ resumed Tom , as if he had made up his mind , ‘
83131	83132	83128	83128	he	1828	’ ‘
83141	83142	83134	83134	he	1828	’ ‘
83162	83172	83160	83160	Loo	100	’ He sat up in bed and kissed her . ‘
83182	83183	83160	83160	Loo	100	’ ‘
83192	83193	83184	83184	You	0	’ ‘

83283	83812	83252	83252	Loo	100	’ Kissing her again , he turned round , drew the coverlet over his head , and lay as still as if that time had come by which she had adjured him . She stood for some time at the bedside before she slowly moved away . She stopped at the door , looked back when she had opened it , and asked him if he had called her ? But he lay still , and she softly closed the door and returned to her room . Then the wretched boy looked cautiously up and found her gone , crept out of bed , fastened his door , and threw himself upon his pillow again : tearing his hair , morosely crying , grudgingly loving her , hatefully but impenitently spurning himself , and no less hatefully and unprofitably spurning all the good in the world . CHAPTER IX HEARING THE LAST OF IT MRS . SPARSIT , lying by to recover the tone of her nerves in Mr. Bounderby ’s retreat , kept such a sharp look - out , night and day , under her Coriolanian eyebrows , that her eyes , like a couple of lighthouses on an iron - bound coast , might have warned all prudent mariners from that bold rock her Roman nose and the dark and craggy region in its neighbourhood , but for the placidity of her manner . Although it was hard to believe that her retiring for the night could be anything but a form , so severely wide awake were those classical eyes of hers , and so impossible did it seem that her rigid nose could yield to any relaxing influence , yet her manner of sitting , smoothing her uncomfortable , not to say , gritty mittens ( they were constructed of a cool fabric like a meat - safe ) , or of ambling to unknown places of destination with her foot in her cotton stirrup , was so perfectly serene , that most observers would have been constrained to suppose her a dove , embodied by some freak of nature , in the earthly tabernacle of a bird of the hook - beaked order . She was a most wonderful woman for prowling about the house . How she got from story to story was a mystery beyond solution . A lady so decorous in herself , and so highly connected , was not to be suspected of dropping over the banisters or sliding down them , yet her extraordinary facility of locomotion suggested the wild idea . Another noticeable circumstance in Mrs. Sparsit was , that she was never hurried . She would shoot with consummate velocity from the roof to the hall , yet would be in full possession of her breath and dignity on the moment of her arrival there . Neither was she ever seen by human vision to go at a great pace . She took very kindly to Mr. Harthouse , and had some pleasant conversation with him soon after her arrival . She made him her stately curtsey in the garden , one morning before breakfast . ‘
83820	83825	83827	83827	I	0	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
83856	83857	83851	83852	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ ‘
83877	83897	83861	83861	I	0	’ said Mr. Harthouse , inclining his head to Mrs. Sparsit with the most indolent of all possible airs . ‘
83907	83912	83905	83905	sir	2713	’ said Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
83944	83945	83950	83950	I	0	’ ‘
83956	83989	83950	83950	I	0	’ pursued Mrs. Sparsit ; after acknowledging the compliment with a drooping of her dark eyebrows , not altogether so mild in its expression as her voice was in its dulcet tones ; ‘
84035	84036	84027	84027	you	2713	’ ‘
84106	84138	84139	84139	You	2713	’ He was almost falling asleep over this compliment ; it took him so long to get through , and his mind wandered so much in the course of its execution . ‘
84167	84174	84163	84163	I	0	’ asked Mrs. Sparsit , sweetly . ‘
84181	84186	84175	84175	You	2713	’ said Mr. Harthouse . ‘
84192	84193	84188	84188	her	127	’ ‘
84199	84214	84197	84197	sir	2713	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one another . ‘
84218	84219	84197	84197	sir	2713	’ ‘
84226	84231	84197	84197	sir	2713	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
84266	84292	84263	84264	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ cried Mrs. Sparsit , nodding her head a great many times , as if she had been talking and thinking of no one else . ‘
84312	84373	84310	84310	sir	2713	’ Now , these persistent assuagements of his misery , and lightenings of his load , had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit , and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward . So , when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart , ‘
84397	84402	84385	84386	Miss Gradgrind	127	’ Mr. Bounderby replied , ‘
84443	84624	84430	84430	I	0	’ Mrs. Sparsit complied , and assumed her old position at table . This again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental . She was so humble withal , that when Louisa appeared , she rose , protesting she never could think of sitting in that place under existing circumstances , often as she had had the honour of making Mr. Bounderby ’s breakfast , before Mrs. Gradgrind — she begged pardon , she meant to say Miss Bounderby — she hoped to be excused , but she really could not get it right yet , though she trusted to become familiar with it by and by — had assumed her present position . It was only ( she observed ) because Miss Gradgrind happened to be a little late , and Mr. Bounderby ’s time was so very precious , and she knew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment , that she had taken the liberty of complying with his request ; long as his will had been a law to her . ‘
84634	84639	84632	84632	ma’am	350	’ said Mr. Bounderby , ‘
84661	84662	84658	84658	I	0	’ ‘
84670	84679	84668	84668	sir	2713	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , almost with severity , ‘
84701	84702	84699	84699	sir	2713	’ ‘
84724	84737	84720	84720	you	1850	’ said Mr. Bounderby , in a blustering way to his wife . ‘
84757	84758	84797	84797	ma’am	350	’ ‘
84775	84787	84770	84771	Mrs. Sparsit	92	’ said Mr. Bounderby , swelling with a sense of slight . ‘
84831	84832	84821	84821	You	350	’ ‘
84840	84847	84821	84821	You	350	’ asked Louisa , coldly surprised . ‘
84854	84855	84821	84821	You	350	’ ‘
84858	84862	84864	84864	you	350	’ repeated Bounderby . ‘
84907	84908	84896	84896	I	0	’ ‘
84926	84932	84933	84933	I	0	’ Louisa answered him composedly : ‘
84960	84961	84956	84956	you	350	’ ‘
84964	84969	84956	84956	you	350	’ returned Mr. Bounderby . ‘
84996	85030	85031	85031	You	350	’ She looked at him , as he struck the table and made the teacups ring , with a proud colour in her face that was a new change , Mr. Harthouse thought . ‘
85037	85041	85031	85031	You	350	’ said Louisa . ‘
85065	85196	85197	85198	My benefactor	1863	’ Nothing more was said on this theme , and Mr. Harthouse was soon idly gay on indifferent subjects . But from this day , the Sparsit action upon Mr. Bounderby threw Louisa and James Harthouse more together , and strengthened the dangerous alienation from her husband and confidence against him with another , into which she had fallen by degrees so fine that she could not retrace them if she tried . But whether she ever tried or no , lay hidden in her own closed heart . Mrs. Sparsit was so much affected on this particular occasion , that , assisting Mr. Bounderby to his hat after breakfast , and being then alone with him in the hall , she imprinted a chaste kiss upon his hand , murmured ‘
85200	85274	85197	85198	My benefactor	1863	’ and retired , overwhelmed with grief . Yet it is an indubitable fact , within the cognizance of this history , that five minutes after he had left the house in the self - same hat , the same descendant of the Scadgerses and connexion by matrimony of the Powlers , shook her right - hand mitten at his portrait , made a contemptuous grimace at that work of art , and said ‘
85289	86229	85283	85283	I	0	’ Mr. Bounderby had not been long gone , when Bitzer appeared . Bitzer had come down by train , shrieking and rattling over the long line of arches that bestrode the wild country of past and present coal - pits , with an express from Stone Lodge . It was a hasty note to inform Louisa that Mrs. Gradgrind lay very ill . She had never been well within her daughter ’s knowledge ; but , she had declined within the last few days , had continued sinking all through the night , and was now as nearly dead , as her limited capacity of being in any state that implied the ghost of an intention to get out of it , allowed . Accompanied by the lightest of porters , fit colourless servitor at Death ’s door when Mrs. Gradgrind knocked , Louisa rumbled to Coketown , over the coal - pits past and present , and was whirled into its smoky jaws . She dismissed the messenger to his own devices , and rode away to her old home . She had seldom been there since her marriage . Her father was usually sifting and sifting at his parliamentary cinder - heap in London ( without being observed to turn up many precious articles among the rubbish ) , and was still hard at it in the national dust - yard . Her mother had taken it rather as a disturbance than otherwise , to be visited , as she reclined upon her sofa ; young people , Louisa felt herself all unfit for ; Sissy she had never softened to again , since the night when the stroller ’s child had raised her eyes to look at Mr. Bounderby ’s intended wife . She had no inducements to go back , and had rarely gone . Neither , as she approached her old home now , did any of the best influences of old home descend upon her . The dreams of childhood — its airy fables ; its graceful , beautiful , humane , impossible adornments of the world beyond : so good to be believed in once , so good to be remembered when outgrown , for then the least among them rises to the stature of a great Charity in the heart , suffering little children to come into the midst of it , and to keep with their pure hands a garden in the stony ways of this world , wherein it were better for all the children of Adam that they should oftener sun themselves , simple and trustful , and not worldly - wise — what had she to do with these ? Remembrances of how she had journeyed to the little that she knew , by the enchanted roads of what she and millions of innocent creatures had hoped and imagined ; of how , first coming upon Reason through the tender light of Fancy , she had seen it a beneficent god , deferring to gods as great as itself ; not a grim Idol , cruel and cold , with its victims bound hand to foot , and its big dumb shape set up with a sightless stare , never to be moved by anything but so many calculated tons of leverage — what had she to do with these ? Her remembrances of home and childhood were remembrances of the drying up of every spring and fountain in her young heart as it gushed out . The golden waters were not there . They were flowing for the fertilization of the land where grapes are gathered from thorns , and figs from thistles . She went , with a heavy , hardened kind of sorrow upon her , into the house and into her mother ’s room . Since the time of her leaving home , Sissy had lived with the rest of the family on equal terms . Sissy was at her mother ’s side ; and Jane , her sister , now ten or twelve years old , was in the room . There was great trouble before it could be made known to Mrs. Gradgrind that her eldest child was there . She reclined , propped up , from mere habit , on a couch : as nearly in her old usual attitude , as anything so helpless could be kept in . She had positively refused to take to her bed ; on the ground that if she did , she would never hear the last of it . Her feeble voice sounded so far away in her bundle of shawls , and the sound of another voice addressing her seemed to take such a long time in getting down to her ears , that she might have been lying at the bottom of a well . The poor lady was nearer Truth than she ever had been : which had much to do with it . On being told that Mrs. Bounderby was there , she replied , at cross - purposes , that she had never called him by that name since he married Louisa ; that pending her choice of an objectionable name , she had called him J ; and that she could not at present depart from that regulation , not being yet provided with a permanent substitute . Louisa had sat by her for some minutes , and had spoken to her often , before she arrived at a clear understanding who it was . She then seemed to come to it all at once . ‘
86235	86240	85283	85283	I	0	’ said Mrs. Gradgrind , ‘
86273	86274	86275	86275	I	0	’ ‘
86288	86289	86290	86290	You	3090	’ ‘
86329	86330	86322	86322	Louisa	91	’ ‘
86339	86340	86322	86322	Louisa	91	’ ‘
86352	86357	86341	86341	I	0	’ said Mrs. Gradgrind , ‘
86370	86410	86411	86411	You	3090	’ After this strange speech , she lay silent for some time . Louisa , holding her hand , could feel no pulse ; but kissing it , could see a slight thin thread of life in fluttering motion . ‘
86418	86423	86411	86411	You	3090	’ said Mrs. Gradgrind . ‘
86443	86479	86437	86437	Sissy	76	’ She was brought , and stood with her hand in her sister ’s . Louisa had observed her with her arm round Sissy ’s neck , and she felt the difference of this approach . ‘
86488	86489	86492	86492	mother	3242	’ ‘
86503	86504	86437	86437	Sissy	76	’ ‘
86514	86523	86509	86509	I	0	’ Mrs. Gradgrind cried , with unexpected quickness . ‘
86553	86692	86541	86541	Sissy	76	’ Louisa had relinquished the hand : had thought that her sister ’s was a better and brighter face than hers had ever been : had seen in it , not without a rising feeling of resentment , even in that place and at that time , something of the gentleness of the other face in the room ; the sweet face with the trusting eyes , made paler than watching and sympathy made it , by the rich dark hair . Left alone with her mother , Louisa saw her lying with an awful lull upon her face , like one who was floating away upon some great water , all resistance over , content to be carried down the stream . She put the shadow of a hand to her lips again , and recalled her . ‘
86703	86704	86701	86701	mother	3242	’ ‘
86736	86737	86741	86741	mother	3242	’ ‘
86751	86752	86753	86753	You	3090	’ ‘
86792	86793	86784	86784	I	0	’ ‘
86801	86844	86797	86797	you	3242	’ But , it was only by dint of bending down to her ear , and at the same time attentively watching the lips as they moved , that she could link such faint and broken sounds into any chain of connexion . ‘
86905	86906	86907	86907	I	0	’ ‘
86922	86932	86910	86910	you	3242	’ This , to keep her from floating away . ‘
87024	87156	87158	87160	MRS . SPARSIT	92	’ Even the power of restlessness was gone , except from the poor head , which could just turn from side to side . She fancied , however , that her request had been complied with , and that the pen she could not have held was in her hand . It matters little what figures of wonderful no - meaning she began to trace upon her wrappers . The hand soon stopped in the midst of them ; the light that had always been feeble and dim behind the weak transparency , went out ; and even Mrs. Gradgrind , emerged from the shadow in which man walketh and disquieteth himself in vain , took upon her the dread solemnity of the sages and patriarchs . CHAPTER X MRS . SPARSIT ’S
87161	87410	87158	87160	MRS . SPARSIT	92	’S nerves being slow to recover their tone , the worthy woman made a stay of some weeks in duration at Mr. Bounderby ’s retreat , where , notwithstanding her anchorite turn of mind based upon her becoming consciousness of her altered station , she resigned herself with noble fortitude to lodging , as one may say , in clover , and feeding on the fat of the land . During the whole term of this recess from the guardianship of the Bank , Mrs. Sparsit was a pattern of consistency ; continuing to take such pity on Mr. Bounderby to his face , as is rarely taken on man , and to call his portrait a Noodle to _ its _ face , with the greatest acrimony and contempt . Mr. Bounderby , having got it into his explosive composition that Mrs. Sparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he had that general cross upon him in his deserts ( for he had not yet settled what it was ) , and further that Louisa would have objected to her as a frequent visitor if it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything he chose to do , resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily . So when her nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming sweetbreads in solitude , he said to her at the dinner - table , on the day before her departure , ‘
87438	87455	87416	87416	ma’am	350	’ To which Mrs. Sparsit returned , in effect , though not of the Mahomedan persuasion : ‘
87462	87673	87416	87416	ma’am	350	’ Now , Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman ; but she took an idea in the nature of an allegorical fancy , into her head . Much watching of Louisa , and much consequent observation of her impenetrable demeanour , which keenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit ’s edge , must have given her as it were a lift , in the way of inspiration . She erected in her mind a mighty Staircase , with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom ; and down those stairs , from day to day and hour to hour , she saw Louisa coming . It became the business of Mrs. Sparsit ’s life , to look up at her staircase , and to watch Louisa coming down . Sometimes slowly , sometimes quickly , sometimes several steps at one bout , sometimes stopping , never turning back . If she had once turned back , it might have been the death of Mrs. Sparsit in spleen and grief . She had been descending steadily , to the day , and on the day , when Mr. Bounderby issued the weekly invitation recorded above . Mrs. Sparsit was in good spirits , and inclined to be conversational . ‘
87679	87683	87677	87677	sir	2713	’ said she , ‘
87730	87731	87734	87734	ma’am	350	’ ‘
87762	87763	87760	87760	ma’am	350	’ ‘
87769	87778	87760	87760	ma’am	350	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , shaking her head . ‘
87787	87788	87785	87785	ma’am	350	’ ‘
87795	87807	87793	87793	sir	2713	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , with a gentle melancholy upon her . ‘
87815	87819	87793	87793	sir	2713	’ said Bounderby , ‘
87894	87895	87886	87886	She	1900	’ ‘
87898	87905	87886	87886	She	1900	’ Mrs. Sparsit sighed and shuddered . ‘
87910	87914	87886	87886	She	1900	’ continued Bounderby , ‘
87994	88002	87993	87993	you	350	’re about ; or half a hundred of ’em
88040	88042	88052	88053	Mrs. Sparsit	92	’em . ’
88043	88050	88052	88053	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Very sagacious indeed , sir , ’
88055	88067	88052	88053	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Very interesting . The old woman you mentioned , sir — ’
88068	88077	88079	88079	Bounderby	92	‘ The old woman I mentioned , ma’am , ’
88094	88153	88079	88079	Bounderby	92	‘ is not laid hold of ; but , she may take her oath she will be , if that is any satisfaction to her villainous old mind . In the mean time , ma’am , I am of opinion , if you ask me my opinion , that the less she is talked about , the better . ’
88219	88224	88226	88227	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ If not quite ! ’
88277	88286	88272	88272	they	1911	‘ You recollect the man , Mr. Harthouse ? ’
88287	88292	88272	88272	they	1911	‘ Oh , perfectly ! ’
88293	88306	88272	88272	they	1911	‘ His face , and his manner , and what he said ? ’
88307	88369	88272	88272	they	1911	‘ Perfectly . And an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be . Lengthy and prosy in the extreme . It was knowing to hold forth , in the humble - virtue school of eloquence ; but , I assure you I thought at the time , “ My good fellow , you are over - doing this ! ” ’
88370	88385	88272	88272	they	1911	‘ It has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man . ’
88386	88395	88397	88397	he	1912	‘ My dear Louisa — as Tom says . ’
88402	88411	88397	88397	he	1912	‘ You know no good of the fellow ? ’
88412	88417	88272	88272	they	1911	‘ No , certainly . ’
88418	88426	88272	88272	they	1911	‘ Nor of any other such person ? ’
88427	88432	88433	88433	she	1913	‘ How can I , ’
88450	88462	88433	88433	she	1913	‘ when I know nothing of them , men or women ? ’
88463	88721	88272	88272	they	1911	‘ My dear Louisa , then consent to receive the submissive representation of your devoted friend , who knows something of several varieties of his excellent fellow - creatures — for excellent they are , I am quite ready to believe , in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to what they can get hold of . This fellow talks . Well ; every fellow talks . He professes morality . Well ; all sorts of humbugs profess morality . From the House of Commons to the House of Correction , there is a general profession of morality , except among our people ; it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving . You saw and heard the case . Here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed friend Mr. Bounderby — who , as we know , is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so tight a hand . The member of the fluffy classes was injured , exasperated , left the house grumbling , met somebody who proposed to him to go in for some share in this Bank business , went in , put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before , and relieved his mind extremely . Really he would have been an uncommon , instead of a common , fellow , if he had not availed himself of such an opportunity . Or he may have originated it altogether , if he had the cleverness . ’
88722	88735	88737	88737	Louisa	91	‘ I almost feel as though it must be bad in me , ’
88744	88767	88737	88737	Louisa	91	‘ to be so ready to agree with you , and to be so lightened in my heart by what you say . ’
88768	88823	88824	88824	They	1914	‘ I only say what is reasonable ; nothing worse . I have talked it over with my friend Tom more than once — of course I remain on terms of perfect confidence with Tom — and he is quite of my opinion , and I am quite of his . Will you walk ? ’
89320	89331	89333	89334	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Your foot on the last step , my lady , ’
89349	89359	89333	89334	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ and all your art shall never blind me . ’
89500	89535	89488	89488	he	92	‘ But you ’ll go down to - morrow , ma’am , all the same . You ’ll go down just as if I was there . It will make no difference to you . ’
89536	89541	89543	89544	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Pray , sir , ’
89548	89578	89543	89544	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ let me beg you not to say that . Your absence will make a vast difference to me , sir , as I think you very well know . ’
89579	89598	89600	89601	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ Well , ma’am , then you must get on in my absence as well as you can , ’
89606	89610	89600	89601	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ Mr. Bounderby , ’
89615	89683	89612	89613	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ your will is to me a law , sir ; otherwise , it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands , not feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to Miss Gradgrind to receive me , as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality . But you shall say no more , sir . I will go , upon your invitation . ’
89684	89697	89699	89699	Bounderby	92	‘ Why , when I invite you to my house , ma’am , ’
89705	89715	89699	89699	Bounderby	92	‘ I should hope you want no other invitation . ’
89716	89723	89725	89726	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ No , indeed , sir , ’
89728	89752	89725	89726	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ I should hope not . Say no more , sir . I would , sir , I could see you gay again . ’
89753	89761	89763	89763	Bounderby	92	‘ What do you mean , ma’am ? ’
89765	89768	89763	89763	Bounderby	92	‘ Sir , ’
89773	89794	89770	89771	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ there was wo nt to be an elasticity in you which I sadly miss . Be buoyant , sir ! ’
89847	89850	89852	89853	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Bitzer , ’
89872	89906	89907	89909	Young Mr. Thomas	75	‘ present my compliments to young Mr. Thomas , and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop and walnut ketchup , with a glass of India ale ? ’
89930	89934	89936	89937	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Mr. Thomas , ’
89939	89954	89936	89937	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ these plain viands being on table , I thought you might be tempted . ’
89955	89961	89963	89964	the whelp	1268	‘ Thank’ee , Mrs. Sparsit , ’
89971	89980	89982	89983	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ How is Mr. Harthouse , Mr. Tom ? ’
89985	89993	89995	89995	Tom	75	‘ Oh , he ’s all right , ’
89997	90005	90006	90007	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Where may he be at present ? ’
90028	90035	90037	90037	Tom	75	‘ He is shooting in Yorkshire , ’
90039	90053	90037	90037	Tom	75	‘ Sent Loo a basket half as big as a church , yesterday . ’
90054	90062	90064	90065	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ The kind of gentleman , now , ’
90069	90080	90064	90065	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ whom one might wager to be a good shot ! ’
90081	90084	90086	90086	Tom	75	‘ Crack , ’
90139	90149	90151	90152	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine , ’
90154	90175	90151	90152	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ as indeed he is of most people . May we expect to see him again shortly , Mr. Tom ? ’
90176	90190	90192	90193	the whelp	1268	‘ Why , _ I _ expect to see him to - morrow , ’
90195	90199	90201	90202	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Good news ! ’
90206	90225	90227	90227	Tom	75	‘ I have got an appointment with him to meet him in the evening at the station here , ’
90229	90289	90227	90227	Tom	75	‘ and I am going to dine with him afterwards , I believe . He is not coming down to the country house for a week or so , being due somewhere else . At least , he says so ; but I should n’t wonder if he was to stop here over Sunday , and stray that way . ’
90290	90295	90297	90298	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Which reminds me ! ’
90300	90322	90297	90298	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Would you remember a message to your sister , Mr. Tom , if I was to charge you with one ? ’
90323	90330	90332	90334	the reluctant whelp	1942	‘ Well ? I ’ll try , ’

90346	90354	90356	90357	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ It is merely my respectful compliments , ’
90359	90388	90356	90357	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ and I fear I may not trouble her with my society this week ; being still a little nervous , and better perhaps by my poor self . ’
90389	90397	90399	90399	Tom	75	‘ Oh ! If that ’s all , ’
90401	90430	90399	90399	Tom	75	‘ it would n’t much matter , even if I was to forget it , for Loo ’s not likely to think of you unless she sees you . ’
90460	90471	90457	90457	he	75	‘ Well , Mrs. Sparsit , I must be off ! ’
90587	90721	90551	90551	her	1943	’ waiting - room windows , to appearing in its precincts openly . Tom was in attendance , and loitered about until the expected train came in . It brought no Mr. Harthouse . Tom waited until the crowd had dispersed , and the bustle was over ; and then referred to a posted list of trains , and took counsel with porters . That done , he strolled away idly , stopping in the street and looking up it and down it , and lifting his hat off and putting it on again , and yawning and stretching himself , and exhibiting all the symptoms of mortal weariness to be expected in one who had still to wait until the next train should come in , an hour and forty minutes hence . ‘
90734	90752	90551	90551	her	1943	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , starting from the dull office window whence she had watched him last . ‘
90760	91372	91373	91373	My	0	’ It was the conception of an inspired moment , and she shot off with her utmost swiftness to work it out . The station for the country house was at the opposite end of the town , the time was short , the road not easy ; but she was so quick in pouncing on a disengaged coach , so quick in darting out of it , producing her money , seizing her ticket , and diving into the train , that she was borne along the arches spanning the land of coal - pits past and present , as if she had been caught up in a cloud and whirled away . All the journey , immovable in the air though never left behind ; plain to the dark eyes of her mind , as the electric wires which ruled a colossal strip of music - paper out of the evening sky , were plain to the dark eyes of her body ; Mrs. Sparsit saw her staircase , with the figure coming down . Very near the bottom now . Upon the brink of the abyss . An overcast September evening , just at nightfall , saw beneath its drooping eyelids Mrs. Sparsit glide out of her carriage , pass down the wooden steps of the little station into a stony road , cross it into a green lane , and become hidden in a summer - growth of leaves and branches . One or two late birds sleepily chirping in their nests , and a bat heavily crossing and recrossing her , and the reek of her own tread in the thick dust that felt like velvet , were all Mrs. Sparsit heard or saw until she very softly closed a gate . She went up to the house , keeping within the shrubbery , and went round it , peeping between the leaves at the lower windows . Most of them were open , as they usually were in such warm weather , but there were no lights yet , and all was silent . She tried the garden with no better effect . She thought of the wood , and stole towards it , heedless of long grass and briers : of worms , snails , and slugs , and all the creeping things that be . With her dark eyes and her hook nose warily in advance of her , Mrs. Sparsit softly crushed her way through the thick undergrowth , so intent upon her object that she probably would have done no less , if the wood had been a wood of adders . Hark ! The smaller birds might have tumbled out of their nests , fascinated by the glittering of Mrs. Sparsit ’s eyes in the gloom , as she stopped and listened . Low voices close at hand . His voice and hers . The appointment _ was _ a device to keep the brother away ! There they were yonder , by the felled tree . Bending low among the dewy grass , Mrs. Sparsit advanced closer to them . She drew herself up , and stood behind a tree , like Robinson Crusoe in his ambuscade against the savages ; so near to them that at a spring , and that no great one , she could have touched them both . He was there secretly , and had not shown himself at the house . He had come on horseback , and must have passed through the neighbouring fields ; for his horse was tied to the meadow side of the fence , within a few paces . ‘
91377	91381	91373	91373	My	0	’ said he , ‘
91401	91402	91403	91403	You	1952	’ ‘
91433	91438	91423	91423	they	1953	’ thought Mrs. Sparsit ; ‘
91454	91543	91544	91544	My	0	’ That she hung her head , was certain . She urged him to go away , she commanded him to go away ; but she neither turned her face to him , nor raised it . Yet it was remarkable that she sat as still as ever the amiable woman in ambuscade had seen her sit , at any period in her life . Her hands rested in one another , like the hands of a statue ; and even her manner of speaking was not hurried . ‘
91548	91563	91544	91544	My	0	’ said Harthouse ; Mrs. Sparsit saw with delight that his arm embraced her ; ‘
91576	91577	91565	91565	you	1955	’ ‘
91581	91582	91565	91565	you	1955	’ ‘
91587	91591	91585	91585	Louisa	91	‘ Not here . ’
91592	91665	91703	91704	The listener	1958	‘ But we have so little time to make so much of , and I have come so far , and am altogether so devoted , and distracted . There never was a slave at once so devoted and ill - used by his mistress . To look for your sunny welcome that has warmed me into life , and to be received in your frozen manner , is heart - rending . ’
91666	91682	91585	91585	Louisa	91	‘ Am I to say again , that I must be left to myself here ? ’
91683	91698	91699	91699	They	1957	‘ But we must meet , my dear Louisa . Where shall we meet ? ’
91736	91765	91712	91712	she	91	‘ Shall I ride up to the house a few minutes hence , innocently supposing that its master is at home and will be charmed to receive me ? ’
91766	91769	91585	91585	Louisa	91	‘ No ! ’
91770	91851	91852	91853	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Your cruel commands are implicitly to be obeyed ; though I am the most unfortunate fellow in the world , I believe , to have been insensible to all other women , and to have fallen prostrate at last under the foot of the most beautiful , and the most engaging , and the most imperious . My dearest Louisa , I can not go myself , or let you go , in this hard abuse of your power . ’
92180	92187	92189	92190	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Oh , my dearest love , ’
92192	92202	92189	92190	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ you little think how well attended you are ! ’
92758	92768	92770	92771	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ She will be at Coketown long before him , ’
92773	92802	92770	92771	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ though his horse is never so good . Where will she wait for him ? And where will they go together ? Patience . We shall see . ’
92858	92865	92866	92866	she	1961	‘ She will get into one , ’
92869	92904	92866	92866	she	1961	‘ and will be away before I can follow in another . At all risks of being run over , I must see the number , and hear the order given to the coachman . ’
93084	93090	93069	93070	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ I have lost her ! ’
93267	93270	93248	93248	He	75	‘ Louisa ! ’
93271	93281	93320	93320	her	2002	‘ Father , I want to speak to you . ’
93282	93297	93299	93300	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ What is the matter ? How strange you look ! And good Heaven , ’
93307	93317	93318	93318	She	2002	‘ have you come here exposed to this storm ? ’
93332	93335	93320	93320	her	2002	‘ Yes . ’
93376	93394	93395	93395	She	2002	‘ What is it ? I conjure you , Louisa , tell me what is the matter . ’
93412	93423	93405	93405	her	2002	‘ Father , you have trained me from my cradle ? ’
93424	93429	93405	93405	her	2002	‘ Yes , Louisa . ’
93430	93445	93446	93446	He	75	‘ I curse the hour in which I was born to such a destiny . ’
93458	93467	93446	93446	He	75	‘ Curse the hour ? Curse the hour ? ’
93468	93538	93539	93539	She	2002	‘ How could you give me life , and take from me all the inappreciable things that raise it from the state of conscious death ? Where are the graces of my soul ? Where are the sentiments of my heart ? What have you done , O father , what have you done , with the garden that should have bloomed once , in this great wilderness here ! ’
93550	93597	93539	93539	She	2002	‘ If it had ever been here , its ashes alone would save me from the void in which my whole life sinks . I did not mean to say this ; but , father , you remember the last time we conversed in this room ? ’
93618	93623	93615	93615	he	2003	‘ Yes , Louisa . ’
93624	93709	93539	93539	She	2002	‘ What has risen to my lips now , would have risen to my lips then , if you had given me a moment ’s help . I do n’t reproach you , father . What you have never nurtured in me , you have never nurtured in yourself ; but O ! if you had only done so long ago , or if you had only neglected me , what a much better and much happier creature I should have been this day ! ’
93730	93835	93836	93836	He	2003	‘ Father , if you had known , when we were last together here , what even I feared while I strove against it — as it has been my task from infancy to strive against every natural prompting that has arisen in my heart ; if you had known that there lingered in my breast , sensibilities , affections , weaknesses capable of being cherished into strength , defying all the calculations ever made by man , and no more known to his arithmetic than his Creator is,—would you have given me to the husband whom I am now sure that I hate ? ’
93839	93848	93836	93836	He	2003	‘ No . No , my poor child . ’
93849	93954	94075	94075	he	2004	‘ Would you have doomed me , at any time , to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me ? Would you have robbed me — for no one ’s enrichment — only for the greater desolation of this world — of the immaterial part of my life , the spring and summer of my belief , my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me , my school in which I should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with them , and to hope in my little sphere to make them better ? ’
93955	93965	94075	94075	he	2004	‘ O no , no . No , Louisa . ’
93966	94061	94062	94062	He	2004	‘ Yet , father , if I had been stone blind ; if I had groped my way by my sense of touch , and had been free , while I knew the shapes and surfaces of things , to exercise my fancy somewhat , in regard to them ; I should have been a million times wiser , happier , more loving , more contented , more innocent and human in all good respects , than I am with the eyes I have . Now , hear what I have come to say . ’
94099	94151	94084	94084	she	2005	‘ With a hunger and thirst upon me , father , which have never been for a moment appeased ; with an ardent impulse towards some region where rules , and figures , and definitions were not quite absolute ; I have grown up , battling every inch of my way . ’
94152	94163	94084	94084	she	2005	‘ I never knew you were unhappy , my child . ’
94164	94240	94084	94084	she	2005	‘ Father , I always knew it . In this strife I have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon . What I have learned has left me doubting , misbelieving , despising , regretting , what I have not learned ; and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by , and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest . ’
94241	94249	94250	94250	he	2004	‘ And you so young , Louisa ! ’
94255	94420	94250	94250	he	2004	‘ And I so young . In this condition , father — for I show you now , without fear or favour , the ordinary deadened state of my mind as I know it — you proposed my husband to me . I took him . I never made a pretence to him or you that I loved him . I knew , and , father , you knew , and he knew , that I never did . I was not wholly indifferent , for I had a hope of being pleasant and useful to Tom . I made that wild escape into something visionary , and have slowly found out how wild it was . But Tom had been the subject of all the little tenderness of my life ; perhaps he became so because I knew so well how to pity him . It matters little now , except as it may dispose you to think more leniently of his errors . ’
94451	94524	94430	94430	she	2007	‘ When I was irrevocably married , there rose up into rebellion against the tie , the old strife , made fiercer by all those causes of disparity which arise out of our two individual natures , and which no general laws shall ever rule or state for me , father , until they shall be able to direct the anatomist where to strike his knife into the secrets of my soul . ’
94525	94528	94529	94529	he	335	‘ Louisa ! ’
94550	94571	94529	94529	he	335	‘ I do not reproach you , father , I make no complaint . I am here with another object . ’
94572	94586	94430	94430	she	2007	‘ What can I do , child ? Ask me what you will . ’
94587	94719	94738	94738	he	335	‘ I am coming to it . Father , chance then threw into my way a new acquaintance ; a man such as I had had no experience of ; used to the world ; light , polished , easy ; making no pretences ; avowing the low estimate of everything , that I was half afraid to form in secret ; conveying to me almost immediately , though I do n’t know how or by what degrees , that he understood me , and read my thoughts . I could not find that he was worse than I. There seemed to be a near affinity between us . I only wondered it should be worth his while , who cared for nothing else , to care so much for me . ’
94720	94726	94727	94727	Her	2010	‘ For you , Louisa ! ’
94759	94805	94806	94806	Her	2010	‘ I say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence . It matters very little how he gained it . Father , he did gain it . What you know of the story of my marriage , he soon knew , just as well . ’
94823	94870	94871	94871	She	2010	‘ I have done no worse , I have not disgraced you . But if you ask me whether I have loved him , or do love him , I tell you plainly , father , that it may be so . I do n’t know . ’
94925	95029	95030	95030	He	2013	‘ This night , my husband being away , he has been with me , declaring himself my lover . This minute he expects me , for I could release myself of his presence by no other means . I do not know that I am sorry , I do not know that I am ashamed , I do not know that I am degraded in my own esteem . All that I know is , your philosophy and your teaching will not save me . Now , father , you have brought me to this . Save me by some other means ! ’
95053	95069	95045	95045	she	2014	‘ I shall die if you hold me ! Let me fall upon the ground ! ’
95288	95297	95285	95285	she	91	‘ When was I brought to this room ? ’
95298	95304	95285	95285	she	91	‘ Last night , Louisa . ’
95305	95311	95285	95285	she	91	‘ Who brought me here ? ’
95312	95318	95285	95285	she	91	‘ Sissy , I believe . ’
95319	95326	95285	95285	she	91	‘ Why do you believe so ? ’
95327	95410	95285	95285	she	91	‘ Because I found her here this morning . She did n’t come to my bedside to wake me , as she always does ; and I went to look for her . She was not in her own room either ; and I went looking for her all over the house , until I found her here taking care of you and cooling your head . Will you see father ? Sissy said I was to tell him when you woke . ’
95411	95421	95423	95423	Louisa	91	‘ What a beaming face you have , Jane ! ’
95439	95461	95494	95494	she	91	‘ Have I ? I am very glad you think so . I am sure it must be Sissy ’s doing . ’
95476	95485	95494	95494	she	91	‘ You can tell father if you will . ’
95497	95516	95494	95494	she	91	‘ It was you who made my room so cheerful , and gave it this look of welcome ? ’
95517	95533	95494	95494	she	91	‘ Oh no , Louisa , it was done before I came . It was — ’
95658	95667	95668	95668	He	335	‘ My dear Louisa . My poor daughter . ’
95688	95693	95684	95684	He	335	‘ My unfortunate child . ’
95708	95824	95704	95704	he	335	‘ It would be hopeless for me , Louisa , to endeavour to tell you how overwhelmed I have been , and still am , by what broke upon me last night . The ground on which I stand has ceased to be solid under my feet . The only support on which I leaned , and the strength of which it seemed , and still does seem , impossible to question , has given way in an instant . I am stunned by these discoveries . I have no selfish meaning in what I say ; but I find the shock of what broke upon me last night , to be very heavy indeed . ’
95846	95956	95957	95957	He	2028	‘ I will not say , Louisa , that if you had by any happy chance undeceived me some time ago , it would have been better for us both ; better for your peace , and better for mine . For I am sensible that it may not have been a part of my system to invite any confidence of that kind . I had proved my — my system to myself , and I have rigidly administered it ; and I must bear the responsibility of its failures . I only entreat you to believe , my favourite child , that I have meant to do right . ’
96037	96079	96080	96080	He	2028	‘ I am well assured of what you say , father . I know I have been your favourite child . I know you have intended to make me happy . I have never blamed you , and I never shall . ’
96092	96174	96175	96175	He	2028	‘ My dear , I have remained all night at my table , pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between us . When I consider your character ; when I consider that what has been known to me for hours , has been concealed by you for years ; when I consider under what immediate pressure it has been forced from you at last ; I come to the conclusion that I can not but mistrust myself . ’
96245	96248	96250	96251	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ But , ’
96269	96387	96250	96251	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ if I see reason to mistrust myself for the past , Louisa , I should also mistrust myself for the present and the future . To speak unreservedly to you , I do . I am far from feeling convinced now , however differently I might have felt only this time yesterday , that I am fit for the trust you repose in me ; that I know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me ; that I have the right instinct — supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature — how to help you , and to set you right , my child . ’
96455	96460	96461	96461	he	2037	‘ Some persons hold , ’
96467	96559	96560	96560	He	2037	‘ that there is a wisdom of the Head , and that there is a wisdom of the Heart . I have not supposed so ; but , as I have said , I mistrust myself now . I have supposed the head to be all - sufficient . It may not be all - sufficient ; how can I venture this morning to say it is ! If that other kind of wisdom should be what I have neglected , and should be the instinct that is wanted , Louisa — ’
96612	96615	96617	96617	his	2037	‘ Louisa , ’
96625	96657	96658	96658	he	2037	‘ I have been absent from here , my dear , a good deal of late ; and though your sister ’s training has been pursued according to — the system , ’
96670	96709	96658	96658	he	2037	‘ it has necessarily been modified by daily associations begun , in her case , at an early age . I ask you — ignorantly and humbly , my daughter — for the better , do you think ? ’
96710	96713	96714	96714	she	2036	‘ Father , ’
96720	96769	96714	96714	she	2036	‘ if any harmony has been awakened in her young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to discord , let her thank Heaven for it , and go upon her happier way , taking it as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way . ’
96770	96778	96779	96779	he	2040	‘ O my child , my child ! ’
96787	96817	96779	96779	he	2040	‘ I am an unhappy man to see you thus ! What avails it to me that you do not reproach me , if I so bitterly reproach myself ! ’
96829	96881	96820	96820	his	2040	‘ Louisa , I have a misgiving that some change may have been slowly working about me in this house , by mere love and gratitude : that what the Head had left undone and could not do , the Heart may have been doing silently . Can it be so ? ’
96888	96923	96882	96882	She	2041	‘ I am not too proud to believe it , Louisa . How could I be arrogant , and you before me ! Can it be so ? Is it so , my dear ? ’
97211	97234	97204	97204	she	2041	‘ I hope I have not disturbed you . I have come to ask if you would let me stay with you ? ’
97235	97255	97204	97204	she	2041	‘ Why should you stay with me ? My sister will miss you . You are everything to her . ’
97256	97260	97265	97265	her	76	‘ Am I ? ’
97268	97280	97265	97265	her	76	‘ I would be something to you , if I might . ’
97281	97284	97286	97286	Louisa	91	‘ What ? ’
97291	97341	97286	97286	Louisa	91	‘ Whatever you want most , if I could be that . At all events , I would like to try to be as near it as I can . And however far off that may be , I will never tire of trying . Will you let me ? ’
97342	97351	97265	97265	her	76	‘ My father sent you to ask me . ’
97352	97356	97358	97358	Sissy	76	‘ No indeed , ’
97360	97386	97387	97387	She	91	‘ He told me that I might come in now , but he sent me away from the room this morning — or at least — ’
97392	97398	97400	97400	Louisa	91	‘ At least , what ? ’
97409	97436	97403	97403	her	91	‘ I thought it best myself that I should be sent away , for I felt very uncertain whether you would like to find me here . ’
97437	97446	97265	97265	her	76	‘ Have I always hated you so much ? ’
97447	97533	97534	97534	Her	2047	‘ I hope not , for I have always loved you , and have always wished that you should know it . But you changed to me a little , shortly before you left home . Not that I wondered at it . You knew so much , and I knew so little , and it was so natural in many ways , going as you were among other friends , that I had nothing to complain of , and was not at all hurt . ’
97557	97562	97564	97564	Sissy	76	‘ May I try ? ’
97606	97660	97581	97581	Louisa	91	‘ First , Sissy , do you know what I am ? I am so proud and so hardened , so confused and troubled , so resentful and unjust to every one and to myself , that everything is stormy , dark , and wicked to me . Does not that repel you ? ’
97661	97664	97581	97581	Louisa	91	‘ No ! ’
97665	97751	97581	97581	Louisa	91	‘ I am so unhappy , and all that should have made me otherwise is so laid waste , that if I had been bereft of sense to this hour , and instead of being as learned as you think me , had to begin to acquire the simplest truths , I could not want a guide to peace , contentment , honour , all the good of which I am quite devoid , more abjectly than I do . Does not that repel you ? ’
97752	97755	97581	97581	Louisa	91	‘ No ! ’
97827	97857	97815	97818	this stroller ’s child	2050	‘ Forgive me , pity me , help me ! Have compassion on my great need , and let me lay this head of mine upon a loving heart ! ’
97858	97864	97866	97866	Sissy	76	‘ O lay it here ! ’
97868	97876	97866	97866	Sissy	76	‘ Lay it here , my dear . ’
98210	98218	98220	98220	Tom	75	‘ Well ! I do n’t know , ’
98233	98272	98220	98220	Tom	75	‘ She was off somewhere at daybreak this morning . She ’s always full of mystery ; I hate her . So I do that white chap ; he ’s always got his blinking eyes upon a fellow . ’
98273	98282	98191	98192	Mrs. Sparsit	2066	‘ Where were you last night , Tom ? ’
98283	98290	98292	98292	Tom	75	‘ Where was I last night ! ’
98294	98337	98292	98292	Tom	75	‘ Come ! I like that . I was waiting for you , Mr. Harthouse , till it came down as _ I _ never saw it come down before . Where was I too ! Where were you , you mean . ’
98338	98347	98191	98192	Mrs. Sparsit	2066	‘ I was prevented from coming — detained . ’
98348	98351	98353	98353	Tom	75	‘ Detained ! ’
98355	98414	98353	98353	Tom	75	‘ Two of us were detained . I was detained looking for you , till I lost every train but the mail . It would have been a pleasant job to go down by that on such a night , and have to walk home through a pond . I was obliged to sleep in town after all . ’
98415	98418	98191	98192	Mrs. Sparsit	2066	‘ Where ? ’
98419	98432	98353	98353	Tom	75	‘ Where ? Why , in my own bed at Bounderby ’s . ’
98433	98440	98353	98353	Tom	75	‘ Did you see your sister ? ’
98441	98446	98448	98448	Tom	75	‘ How the deuce , ’
98452	98465	98448	98448	Tom	75	‘ could I see my sister when she was fifteen miles off ? ’
98619	98671	98673	98675	Mr. James Harthouse	162	‘ So , whether I am waiting for a hostile message , or an assignation , or a penitent remonstrance , or an impromptu wrestle with my friend Bounderby in the Lancashire manner — which would seem as likely as anything else in the present state of affairs — I’ll dine , ’
98677	98711	98673	98675	Mr. James Harthouse	162	‘ Bounderby has the advantage in point of weight ; and if anything of a British nature is to come off between us , it may be as well to be in training . ’
98727	98739	98749	98749	he	162	‘ Some dinner at six — with a beefsteak in it , ’
98819	98826	98827	98827	he	162	‘ It would n’t be bad , ’
98833	98845	98827	98827	he	162	‘ to give the waiter five shillings , and throw him . ’
98854	98871	98827	98827	he	162	‘ Or a fellow of about thirteen or fourteen stone might be hired by the hour . ’
98980	98989	99013	99013	he	162	‘ like the Holy Office and slow torture . ’
99057	99065	99045	99046	the waiter	4595	‘ Beg your pardon , sir . You ’re
99074	99113	99045	99046	the waiter	4595	’ A general recollection that this was the kind of thing the Police said to the swell mob , caused Mr. Harthouse to ask the waiter in return , with bristling indignation , what the Devil he meant by ‘
99115	99117	99119	99119	your	2713	’ ? ‘
99135	99136	99124	99126	Young lady outside	2081	’ ‘
99141	99142	99147	99147	sir	2713	’ ‘
99149	99283	99147	99147	sir	2713	’ Giving the waiter to the personage before mentioned , as a block - head duly qualified for that consignment , Mr. Harthouse hurried into the gallery . A young woman whom he had never seen stood there . Plainly dressed , very quiet , very pretty . As he conducted her into the room and placed a chair for her , he observed , by the light of the candles , that she was even prettier than he had at first believed . Her face was innocent and youthful , and its expression remarkably pleasant . She was not afraid of him , or in any way disconcerted ; she seemed to have her mind entirely preoccupied with the occasion of her visit , and to have substituted that consideration for herself . ‘
99290	99299	99284	99284	I	0	’ she said , when they were alone . ‘
99304	99311	99301	99302	Mr. Harthouse	162	’ He added in his mind , ‘
99340	99341	99313	99313	you	0	’ ‘
99356	99371	99380	99380	she	76	‘ what your honour as a gentleman binds you to , in other matters : ’
99386	99429	99380	99380	she	76	‘ I am sure I may rely upon it to keep my visit secret , and to keep secret what I am going to say . I will rely upon it , if you will tell me I may so far trust — ’
99430	99438	99380	99380	she	76	‘ You may , I assure you . ’
99439	99474	99475	99475	He	2084	‘ I am young , as you see ; I am alone , as you see . In coming to you , sir , I have no advice or encouragement beyond my own hope . ’
99478	99485	99487	99487	he	2084	‘ But that is very strong , ’
99501	99518	99497	99497	He	2084	‘ This is a very odd beginning . I do n’t see where we are going . ’
99519	99523	99525	99525	Sissy	76	‘ I think , ’
99527	99538	99525	99525	Sissy	76	‘ you have already guessed whom I left just now ! ’
99539	99567	99568	99568	he	2084	‘ I have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last four - and - twenty hours ( which have appeared as many years ) , ’
99571	99601	99568	99568	he	2084	‘ on a lady ’s account . The hopes I have been encouraged to form that you come from that lady , do not deceive me , I trust . ’
99602	99610	99525	99525	Sissy	76	‘ I left her within an hour . ’
99611	99615	99568	99568	he	2084	‘ At — ! ’
99616	99622	99525	99525	Sissy	76	‘ At her father ’s . ’
99639	99644	99645	99645	he	162	‘ Then I certainly , ’
99648	99659	99645	99645	he	162	‘ do _ not _ see where we are going . ’
99660	99713	99714	99715	Mr. Harthouse	162	‘ She hurried there last night . She arrived there in great agitation , and was insensible all through the night . I live at her father ’s , and was with her . You may be sure , sir , you will never see her again as long as you live . ’
99851	99904	99848	99848	he	162	‘ So startling an announcement , so confidently made , and by such lips , is really disconcerting in the last degree . May I be permitted to inquire , if you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless words , by the lady of whom we speak ? ’
99905	99913	99848	99848	he	162	‘ I have no charge from her . ’
99914	99966	99848	99848	he	162	‘ The drowning man catches at the straw . With no disrespect for your judgment , and with no doubt of your sincerity , excuse my saying that I cling to the belief that there is yet hope that I am not condemned to perpetual exile from that lady ’s presence . ’
99967	100022	99848	99848	he	162	‘ There is not the least hope . The first object of my coming here , sir , is to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her again , than there would be if she had died when she came home last night . ’
100023	100049	99848	99848	he	162	‘ Must believe ? But if I can’t — or if I should , by infirmity of nature , be obstinate — and wo n’t — ’
100050	100061	100062	100063	James Harthouse	162	‘ It is still true . There is no hope . ’
100105	100114	100115	100115	he	162	‘ Well ! If it should unhappily appear , ’
100118	100160	100115	100115	he	162	‘ after due pains and duty on my part , that I am brought to a position so desolate as this banishment , I shall not become the lady ’s persecutor . But you said you had no commission from her ? ’
100161	100236	100237	100237	He	2089	‘ I have only the commission of my love for her , and her love for me . I have no other trust , than that I have been with her since she came home , and that she has given me her confidence . I have no further trust , than that I know something of her character and her marriage . O Mr. Harthouse , I think you had that trust too ! ’
100280	100290	100291	100291	he	2089	‘ I am not a moral sort of fellow , ’
100294	100463	100291	100291	he	2089	‘ and I never make any pretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow . I am as immoral as need be . At the same time , in bringing any distress upon the lady who is the subject of the present conversation , or in unfortunately compromising her in any way , or in committing myself by any expression of sentiments towards her , not perfectly reconcilable with — in fact with — the domestic hearth ; or in taking any advantage of her father ’s being a machine , or of her brother ’s being a whelp , or of her husband ’s being a bear ; I beg to be allowed to assure you that I have had no particularly evil intentions , but have glided on from one step to another with a smoothness so perfectly diabolical , that I had not the slightest idea the catalogue was half so long until I began to turn it over . Whereas I find , ’
100472	100481	100465	100467	Mr. James Harthouse	162	‘ that it is really in several volumes . ’
100541	100641	100642	100642	he	162	‘ After what has been just now represented to me , in a manner I find it impossible to doubt — I know of hardly any other source from which I could have accepted it so readily — I feel bound to say to you , in whom the confidence you have mentioned has been reposed , that I can not refuse to contemplate the possibility ( however unexpected ) of my seeing the lady no more . I am solely to blame for the thing having come to this — and — and , I can not say , ’
100653	100683	100642	100642	he	162	‘ that I have any sanguine expectation of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow , or that I have any belief in any moral sort of fellow whatever . ’
100698	100702	100703	100703	he	162	‘ You spoke , ’
100715	100733	100703	100703	he	162	‘ of your first object . I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned ? ’
100734	100737	100709	100709	her	76	‘ Yes . ’
100738	100747	100703	100703	he	162	‘ Will you oblige me by confiding it ? ’
100748	100752	100703	100703	he	162	‘ Mr. Harthouse , ’
100791	100921	100923	100923	she	76	‘ the only reparation that remains with you , is to leave here immediately and finally . I am quite sure that you can mitigate in no other way the wrong and harm you have done . I am quite sure that it is the only compensation you have left it in your power to make . I do not say that it is much , or that it is enough ; but it is something , and it is necessary . Therefore , though without any other authority than I have given you , and even without the knowledge of any other person than yourself and myself , I ask you to depart from this place to - night , under an obligation never to return to it . ’
101026	101032	101033	101033	he	162	‘ But do you know , ’
101041	101112	101033	101033	he	162	‘ the extent of what you ask ? You probably are not aware that I am here on a public kind of business , preposterous enough in itself , but which I have gone in for , and sworn by , and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner ? You probably are not aware of that , but I assure you it ’s the fact . ’
101125	101129	101131	101132	Mr. Harthouse	162	‘ Besides which , ’
101145	101176	101131	101132	Mr. Harthouse	162	‘ it ’s so alarmingly absurd . It would make a man so ridiculous , after going in for these fellows , to back out in such an incomprehensible way . ’
101177	101183	101185	101185	Sissy	76	‘ I am quite sure , ’
101187	101213	101185	101185	Sissy	76	‘ that it is the only reparation in your power , sir . I am quite sure , or I would not have come here . ’
101225	101242	101214	101214	He	162	‘ Upon my soul , I do n’t know what to say . So immensely absurd ! ’
101256	101268	101269	101269	he	162	‘ If I were to do such a very ridiculous thing , ’
101284	101295	101269	101269	he	162	‘ it could only be in the most inviolable confidence . ’
101296	101305	101307	101307	Sissy	76	‘ I will trust to you , sir , ’
101309	101317	101307	101307	Sissy	76	‘ and you will trust to me . ’
101368	101382	101383	101383	he	162	‘ I suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position , ’
101409	101453	101383	101383	he	162	‘ But I see no way out of it . What will be , will be . _ This _ will be , I suppose . I must take off myself , I imagine — in short , I engage to do it . ’
101478	101486	101488	101490	Mr. James Harthouse	162	‘ You will permit me to say , ’
101492	101548	101488	101490	Mr. James Harthouse	162	‘ that I doubt if any other ambassador , or ambassadress , could have addressed me with the same success . I must not only regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position , but as being vanquished at all points . Will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy ’s name ? ’
101549	101555	101557	101558	the ambassadress	208	‘ _ My _ name ? ’
101560	101575	101557	101558	the ambassadress	208	‘ The only name I could possibly care to know , to - night . ’
101576	101580	101488	101490	Mr. James Harthouse	162	‘ Sissy Jupe . ’
101581	101593	101557	101558	the ambassadress	208	‘ Pardon my curiosity at parting . Related to the family ? ’
101594	101602	101604	101604	Sissy	76	‘ I am only a poor girl , ’
101606	101637	101638	101638	She	76	‘ I was separated from my father — he was only a stroller — and taken pity on by Mr. Gradgrind . I have lived in the house ever since . ’
101642	101651	101653	101655	Mr. James Harthouse	162	‘ It wanted this to complete the defeat , ’
101675	101710	101653	101655	Mr. James Harthouse	162	‘ The defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished . Only a poor girl — only a stroller — only James Harthouse made nothing of — only James Harthouse a Great Pyramid of failure . ’
101774	101780	101769	101769	He	162	‘ Send my fellow here . ’
101781	101788	101769	101769	He	162	‘ Gone to bed , sir . ’
101789	101800	101801	101801	He	162	‘ Tell him to get up , and pack up . ’
102315	102321	102323	102323	Bounderby	92	‘ Now , Tom Gradgrind , ’
102339	102367	102323	102323	Bounderby	92	‘ here ’s a lady here — Mrs. Sparsit — you know Mrs. Sparsit — who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb . ’
102368	102375	102377	102378	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ You have missed my letter ! ’
102385	102392	102394	102394	Bounderby	92	‘ Missed your letter , sir ! ’
102396	102429	102394	102394	Bounderby	92	‘ The present time is no time for letters . No man shall talk to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown about letters , with his mind in the state it ’s in now . ’
102430	102433	102435	102436	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Bounderby , ’
102445	102464	102435	102436	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ I speak of a very special letter I have written to you , in reference to Louisa . ’
102465	102469	102471	102471	Bounderby	96	‘ Tom Gradgrind , ’
102488	102515	102471	102471	Bounderby	96	‘ I speak of a very special messenger that has come to me , in reference to Louisa . Mrs. Sparsit , ma’am , stand forward ! ’
102566	102577	102579	102579	Bounderby	92	‘ If you ca n’t get it out , ma’am , ’
102581	102650	102579	102579	Bounderby	92	‘ leave _ me _ to get it out . This is not a time for a lady , however highly connected , to be totally inaudible , and seemingly swallowing marbles . Tom Gradgrind , Mrs. Sparsit latterly found herself , by accident , in a situation to overhear a conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious gentleman - friend , Mr. James Harthouse . ’
102651	102654	102656	102657	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Indeed ! ’
102659	102664	102666	102666	Bounderby	92	‘ Ah ! Indeed ! ’
102668	102674	102666	102666	Bounderby	92	‘ And in that conversation — ’
102675	102692	102579	102579	Bounderby	92	‘ It is not necessary to repeat its tenor , Bounderby . I know what passed . ’
102693	102699	102701	102701	Bounderby	92	‘ You do ? Perhaps , ’
102720	102732	102701	102701	Bounderby	92	‘ you know where your daughter is at the present time ! ’
102733	102740	102579	102579	Bounderby	92	‘ Undoubtedly . She is here . ’
102741	102744	102579	102579	Bounderby	92	‘ Here ? ’
102745	102890	102701	102701	Bounderby	92	‘ My dear Bounderby , let me beg you to restrain these loud out - breaks , on all accounts . Louisa is here . The moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak , and whom I deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you , Louisa hurried here , for protection . I myself had not been at home many hours , when I received her — here , in this room . She hurried by the train to town , she ran from town to this house , through a raging storm , and presented herself before me in a state of distraction . Of course , she has remained here ever since . Let me entreat you , for your own sake and for hers , to be more quiet . ’
102928	102974	102916	102920	the niece of Lady Scadgers	2117	‘ Now , ma’am ! We shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer , for going about the country at express pace , with no other luggage than a Cock - and - a - Bull , ma’am ! ’
102975	102978	102980	102981	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ Sir , ’
102983	103019	103022	103022	she	2118	‘ my nerves are at present too much shaken , and my health is at present too much impaired , in your service , to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears . ’
103026	103031	103033	103033	Bounderby	92	‘ Well , ma’am , ’
103035	103157	103033	103033	Bounderby	92	‘ without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family , what I have got to add to that , is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge , namely , a coach . And the coach in which we came here being at the door , you ’ll allow me to hand you down to it , and pack you home to the Bank : where the best course for you to pursue , will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear , and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed . ’
103195	103217	103218	103218	he	92	‘ Now , as you showed me in your face , Tom Gradgrind , that you wanted to speak to me , ’
103221	103326	103218	103218	he	92	‘ here I am . But , I am not in a very agreeable state , I tell you plainly : not relishing this business , even as it is , and not considering that I am at any time as dutifully and submissively treated by your daughter , as Josiah Bounderby of Coketown ought to be treated by his wife . You have your opinion , I dare say ; and I have mine , I know . If you mean to say anything to me to - night , that goes against this candid remark , you had better let it alone . ’
103357	103362	103363	103364	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ My dear Bounderby , ’

105770	105775	105768	105768	Bounderby	96	’ urged Mr. Gradgrind , ‘

105794	105803	105806	105806	I	0	’ said Bounderby , tossing his hat on : ‘
105879	106564	105864	105864	my	0	’ So Mr. Bounderby went home to his town house to bed . At five minutes past twelve o’clock next day , he directed Mrs. Bounderby ’s property to be carefully packed up and sent to Tom Gradgrind ’s ; advertised his country retreat for sale by private contract ; and resumed a bachelor life . CHAPTER IV LOST THE robbery at the Bank had not languished before , and did not cease to occupy a front place in the attention of the principal of that establishment now . In boastful proof of his promptitude and activity , as a remarkable man , and a self - made man , and a commercial wonder more admirable than Venus , who had risen out of the mud instead of the sea , he liked to show how little his domestic affairs abated his business ardour . Consequently , in the first few weeks of his resumed bachelorhood , he even advanced upon his usual display of bustle , and every day made such a rout in renewing his investigations into the robbery , that the officers who had it in hand almost wished it had never been committed . They were at fault too , and off the scent . Although they had been so quiet since the first outbreak of the matter , that most people really did suppose it to have been abandoned as hopeless , nothing new occurred . No implicated man or woman took untimely courage , or made a self - betraying step . More remarkable yet , Stephen Blackpool could not be heard of , and the mysterious old woman remained a mystery . Things having come to this pass , and showing no latent signs of stirring beyond it , the upshot of Mr. Bounderby ’s investigations was , that he resolved to hazard a bold burst . He drew up a placard , offering Twenty Pounds reward for the apprehension of Stephen Blackpool , suspected of complicity in the robbery of Coketown Bank on such a night ; he described the said Stephen Blackpool by dress , complexion , estimated height , and manner , as minutely as he could ; he recited how he had left the town , and in what direction he had been last seen going ; he had the whole printed in great black letters on a staring broadsheet ; and he caused the walls to be posted with it in the dead of night , so that it should strike upon the sight of the whole population at one blow . The factory - bells had need to ring their loudest that morning to disperse the groups of workers who stood in the tardy daybreak , collected round the placards , devouring them with eager eyes . Not the least eager of the eyes assembled , were the eyes of those who could not read . These people , as they listened to the friendly voice that read aloud — there was always some such ready to help them — stared at the characters which meant so much with a vague awe and respect that would have been half ludicrous , if any aspect of public ignorance could ever be otherwise than threatening and full of evil . Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter of these placards , among turning spindles , rattling looms , and whirling wheels , for hours afterwards ; and when the Hands cleared out again into the streets , there were still as many readers as before . Slackbridge , the delegate , had to address his audience too that night ; and Slackbridge had obtained a clean bill from the printer , and had brought it in his pocket . Oh , my friends and fellow - countrymen , the down - trodden operatives of Coketown , oh , my fellow - brothers and fellow - workmen and fellow - citizens and fellow - men , what a to - do was there , when Slackbridge unfolded what he called ‘
106569	106589	105864	105864	my	0	’ and held it up to the gaze , and for the execration of the working - man community ! ‘
107127	107145	107265	107266	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ Thus Slackbridge ; gnashing and perspiring after a prodigious sort . A few stern voices called out ‘
107148	107160	107265	107266	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ and a score or two hailed , with assenting cries of ‘
107165	107172	107265	107266	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ the caution from one man , ‘
107186	107253	107265	107266	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ But these were pigmies against an army ; the general assemblage subscribed to the gospel according to Slackbridge , and gave three cheers for him , as he sat demonstratively panting at them . These men and women were yet in the streets , passing quietly to their homes , when Sissy , who had been called away from Louisa some minutes before , returned . ‘
107258	107262	107265	107266	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ asked Louisa . ‘
107268	107277	107265	107266	Mr. Bounderby	92	’ said Sissy , timid of the name , ‘

107332	107341	107330	107330	Father	106	’ said Louisa , for he was present , ‘
107364	107404	107405	107406	Mrs. Bounderby	92	’ As he answered in the affirmative , Sissy went away to bring them . She reappeared with them directly . Tom was last ; and remained standing in the obscurest part of the room , near the door . ‘
107408	107419	107405	107406	Mrs. Bounderby	92	’ said her husband , entering with a cool nod , ‘
107492	107493	107494	107494	You	92	’ ‘
107504	107517	107494	107494	You	92	’ said Rachael , standing in front of Louisa . Tom coughed . ‘
107526	107536	107518	107518	You	92	’ repeated Rachael , as she did not answer , ‘
107540	107545	107546	107546	I	0	’ Tom coughed again . ‘
107549	107562	107546	107546	I	0	’ Rachael cast her eyes proudly towards Mr. Bounderby , and said , ‘

107675	107681	107682	107682	she	664	’ said the whelp bitterly , ‘

109472	109512	109470	109470	Sissy	76	‘ that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him , because he had been seen about the Bank at night ? He would then know what he would have to explain on coming back , and would be ready . ’

It has not been , sir , without some trouble that I have effected this ; but trouble in your service is to me a pleasure , and hunger , thirst , and cold a real gratification . ’

112518	112566	112513	112514	Mrs. Pegler	179	‘ My darling boy ! I am not to blame . It ’s not my fault , Josiah . I told this lady over and over again , that I knew she was doing what would not be agreeable to you , but she would do it . ’
112567	112602	112604	112604	Bounderby	96	‘ What did you let her bring you for ? Could n’t you knock her cap off , or her tooth out , or scratch her , or do something or other to her ? ’
112606	112749	112750	112751	Mr. Bounderby	92	‘ My own boy ! She threatened me that if I resisted her , I should be brought by constables , and it was better to come quietly than make that stir in such a’—Mrs . Pegler glanced timidly but proudly round the walls—‘such a fine house as this . Indeed , indeed , it is not my fault ! My dear , noble , stately boy ! I have always lived quiet , and secret , Josiah , my dear . I have never broken the condition once . I have never said I was your mother . I have admired you at a distance ; and if I have come to town sometimes , with long times between , to take a proud peep at you , I have done it unbeknown , my love , and gone away again . ’

112838	112865	112833	112833	he	75	‘ that in your old age you have the face to claim Mr. Bounderby for your son , after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him . ’

112879	112890	112876	112877	Mrs. Pegler	179	‘ _ Me _ inhuman ! To my dear boy ? ’
112891	112894	112896	112897	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Dear ! ’
112899	112941	112896	112897	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Yes ; dear in his self - made prosperity , madam , I dare say . Not very dear , however , when you deserted him in his infancy , and left him to the brutality of a drunken grandmother . ’
112942	112950	112952	112953	Mrs. Pegler	179	‘ _ I _ deserted my Josiah ! ’
112959	113009	113010	113010	She	179	‘ Now , Lord forgive you , sir , for your wicked imaginations , and for your scandal against the memory of my poor mother , who died in my arms before Josiah was born . May you repent of it , sir , and live to know better ! ’
113037	113061	113019	113020	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ Do you deny , then , madam , that you left your son to — to be brought up in the gutter ? ’
113062	113068	113070	113071	Mrs. Pegler	179	‘ Josiah in the gutter ! ’
113073	113159	113161	113162	Mrs. Pegler	179	‘ No such a thing , sir . Never ! For shame on you ! My dear boy knows , and will give _ you _ to know , that though he come of humble parents , he come of parents that loved him as dear as the best could , and never thought it hardship on themselves to pinch a bit that he might write and cipher beautiful , and I ’ve his books at home to show it ! Aye , have I ! ’
113168	113235	113161	113162	Mrs. Pegler	179	‘ And my dear boy knows , and will give _ you _ to know , sir , that after his beloved father died , when he was eight years old , his mother , too , could pinch a bit , as it was her duty and her pleasure and her pride to do it , to help him out in life , and put him ’
113379	113390	113392	113392	I	0	’ said poor old Mrs. Pegler , in affectionate championship , ‘
113458	113465	113450	113450	I	0	’ said Mrs. Pegler , lastly , ‘
113544	113610	113611	113611	I	0	’ The bystanders , on and off the dining - room chairs , raised a murmur of sympathy with Mrs. Pegler , and Mr. Gradgrind felt himself innocently placed in a very distressing predicament , when Mr. Bounderby , who had never ceased walking up and down , and had every moment swelled larger and larger , and grown redder and redder , stopped short . ‘
113617	113622	113611	113611	I	0	’ said Mr. Bounderby , ‘
113645	113661	113644	113644	they	2334	’re quite satisfied , perhaps they ’ll be so good as to disperse ; whether they ’re
113677	113699	113726	113727	Tom Gradgrind	75	’m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs , I have not undertaken to do it , and I ’m
113788	114655	113753	113753	my	0	’ Although Mr. Bounderby carried it off in these terms , holding the door open for the company to depart , there was a blustering sheepishness upon him , at once extremely crestfallen and superlatively absurd . Detected as the Bully of humility , who had built his windy reputation upon lies , and in his boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him as if he had advanced the mean claim ( there is no meaner ) to tack himself on to a pedigree , he cut a most ridiculous figure . With the people filing off at the door he held , who he knew would carry what had passed to the whole town , to be given to the four winds , he could not have looked a Bully more shorn and forlorn , if he had had his ears cropped . Even that unlucky female , Mrs. Sparsit , fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into the Slough of Despond , was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man and self - made Humbug , Josiah Bounderby of Coketown . Rachael and Sissy , leaving Mrs. Pegler to occupy a bed at her son ’s for that night , walked together to the gate of Stone Lodge and there parted . Mr. Gradgrind joined them before they had gone very far , and spoke with much interest of Stephen Blackpool ; for whom he thought this signal failure of the suspicions against Mrs. Pegler was likely to work well . As to the whelp ; throughout this scene as on all other late occasions , he had stuck close to Bounderby . He seemed to feel that as long as Bounderby could make no discovery without his knowledge , he was so far safe . He never visited his sister , and had only seen her once since she went home : that is to say on the night when he still stuck close to Bounderby , as already related . There was one dim unformed fear lingering about his sister ’s mind , to which she never gave utterance , which surrounded the graceless and ungrateful boy with a dreadful mystery . The same dark possibility had presented itself in the same shapeless guise , this very day , to Sissy , when Rachael spoke of some one who would be confounded by Stephen ’s return , having put him out of the way . Louisa had never spoken of harbouring any suspicion of her brother in connexion with the robbery , she and Sissy had held no confidence on the subject , save in that one interchange of looks when the unconscious father rested his gray head on his hand ; but it was understood between them , and they both knew it . This other fear was so awful , that it hovered about each of them like a ghostly shadow ; neither daring to think of its being near herself , far less of its being near the other . And still the forced spirit which the whelp had plucked up , throve with him . If Stephen Blackpool was not the thief , let him show himself . Why did n’t he ? Another night . Another day and night . No Stephen Blackpool . Where was the man , and why did he not come back ? CHAPTER VI THE STARLIGHT THE Sunday was a bright Sunday in autumn , clear and cool , when early in the morning Sissy and Rachael met , to walk in the country . As Coketown cast ashes not only on its own head but on the neighbourhood ’s too — after the manner of those pious persons who do penance for their own sins by putting other people into sackcloth — it was customary for those who now and then thirsted for a draught of pure air , which is not absolutely the most wicked among the vanities of life , to get a few miles away by the railroad , and then begin their walk , or their lounge in the fields . Sissy and Rachael helped themselves out of the smoke by the usual means , and were put down at a station about midway between the town and Mr. Bounderby ’s retreat . Though the green landscape was blotted here and there with heaps of coal , it was green elsewhere , and there were trees to see , and there were larks singing ( though it was Sunday ) , and there were pleasant scents in the air , and all was over - arched by a bright blue sky . In the distance one way , Coketown showed as a black mist ; in another distance hills began to rise ; in a third , there was a faint change in the light of the horizon where it shone upon the far - off sea . Under their feet , the grass was fresh ; beautiful shadows of branches flickered upon it , and speckled it ; hedgerows were luxuriant ; everything was at peace . Engines at pits ’
114849	114881	114883	114883	Sissy	76	‘ It is so still here , Rachael , and the way is so untrodden , that I think we must be the first who have been here all the summer . ’
114911	114943	114944	114944	She	76	‘ And yet I do n’t know . This has not been broken very long . The wood is quite fresh where it gave way . Here are footsteps too.—O Rachael ! ’
114961	114967	114955	114955	Rachael	140	‘ What is the matter ? ’
114968	114983	114984	114984	They	2337	‘ I do n’t know . There is a hat lying in the grass . ’
115022	115045	115015	115015	his	137	‘ O the poor lad , the poor lad ! He has been made away with . He is lying murdered here ! ’
115046	115058	115059	115059	Sissy	76	‘ Is there — has the hat any blood upon it ? ’
115131	115134	115135	115135	Sissy	76	‘ Rachael , ’
115138	115148	115135	115135	Sissy	76	‘ I will go on a little by myself . ’
115223	115238	115244	115244	her	140	‘ O , my good Lord ! He ’s down there ! Down there ! ’
115299	115331	115290	115290	she	140	‘ Rachael , dear Rachael , good Rachael , for the love of Heaven , not these dreadful cries ! Think of Stephen , think of Stephen , think of Stephen ! ’
115372	115406	115351	115351	Sissy	76	‘ Rachael , Stephen may be living . You would n’t leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place , a moment , if you could bring help to him ? ’
115407	115414	115454	115454	him	2351	‘ No , no , no ! ’
115415	115432	115433	115433	She	140	‘ Do n’t stir from here , for his sake ! Let me go and listen . ’
115554	115614	115542	115542	she	140	‘ Rachael , we must lose not a moment . We must go in different directions , seeking aid . You shall go by the way we have come , and I will go forward by the path . Tell any one you see , and every one what has happened . Think of Stephen , think of Stephen ! ’

116760	116783	116747	116747	he	2384	‘ Where ’s doctor ? He ’s hurt so very bad , sir , that we donno how to get him up . ’

See where your father is . Escape at once , for his sake and your own ! ” He was in a tremble before I whispered to him , and he started and trembled more then , and said , “ Where can I go ? I have very little money , and I do n’t know who will hide me ! ” I thought of father ’s old circus . I have not forgotten where Mr. Sleary goes at this time of year , and I read of him in a paper only the other day . I told him to hurry there , and tell his name , and ask Mr. Sleary to hide him till I came . “ I ’ll get to him before the morning , ” he said . And I saw him shrink away among the people . ’

But , caution being necessary in communicating with him — for there was a greater danger every moment of his being suspected now , and nobody could be sure at heart but that Mr. Bounderby himself , in a bullying vein of public zeal , might play a Roman part — it was consented that Sissy and Louisa should repair to the place in question , by a circuitous course , alone ; and that the unhappy father , setting forth in an opposite direction , should get round to the same bourne by another and wider route . It was further agreed that he should not present himself to Mr. Sleary , lest his intentions should be mistrusted , or the intelligence of his arrival should cause his son to take flight anew ; but , that the communication should be left to Sissy and Louisa to open ; and that they should inform the cause of so much misery and disgrace , of his father ’s being at hand and of the purpose for which they had come . When these arrangements had been well considered and were fully understood by all three , it was time to begin to carry them into execution . Early in the afternoon , Mr. Gradgrind walked direct from his own house into the country , to be taken up on the line by which he was to travel ; and at night the remaining two set forth upon their different course , encouraged by not seeing any face they knew . The two travelled all night , except when they were left , for odd numbers of minutes , at branch - places , up illimitable flights of steps , or down wells — which was the only variety of those branches — and , early in the morning , were turned out on a swamp , a mile or two from the town they sought . From this dismal spot they were rescued by a savage old postilion , who happened to be up early , kicking a horse in a fly : and so were smuggled into the town by all the back lanes where the pigs lived : which , although not a magnificent or even savoury approach , was , as is usual in such cases , the legitimate highway . The first thing they saw on entering the town was the skeleton of Sleary ’s Circus . The company had departed for another town more than twenty miles off , and had opened there last night . The connection between the two places was by a hilly turnpike - road , and the travelling on that road was very slow . Though they took but a hasty breakfast , and no rest ( which it would have been in vain to seek under such anxious circumstances ) , it was noon before they began to find the bills of Sleary ’s Horse - riding on barns and walls , and one o’clock when they stopped in the market - place . A Grand Morning Performance by the Riders , commencing at that very hour , was in course of announcement by the bellman as they set their feet upon the stones of the street . Sissy recommended that , to avoid making inquiries and attracting attention in the town , they should present themselves to pay at the door . If Mr. Sleary were taking the money , he would be sure to know her , and would proceed with discretion . If he were not , he would be sure to see them inside ; and , knowing what he had done with the fugitive , would proceed with discretion still . Therefore , they repaired , with fluttering hearts , to the well - remembered booth . The flag with the inscription SLEARY ’S

For , although an ingenious Allegory relating to a butcher , a three - legged stool , a dog , and a leg of mutton , this narrative consumed time ; and they were in great suspense . At last , however , little fair - haired Josephine made her curtsey amid great applause ; and the Clown , left alone in the ring , had just warmed himself , and said , ‘

She took Louisa with her ; and they were received by Mr. Sleary in a very little private apartment , with canvas sides , a grass floor , and a wooden ceiling all aslant , on which the box company stamped their approbation , as if they were coming through . ‘

Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy , who were both before him while his sister yet clung to his shoulder , stopped and recoiled . For , there was Bitzer , out of breath , his thin lips parted , his thin nostrils distended , his white eyelashes quivering , his colourless face more colourless than ever , as if he ran himself into a white heat , when other people ran themselves into a glow . There he stood , panting and heaving , as if he had never stopped since the night , now long ago , when he had run them down before . ‘

124432	124454	124456	124457	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ What motive — even what motive in reason — can you have for preventing the escape of this wretched youth , ’
124459	124474	124456	124457	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ and crushing his miserable father ? See his sister here . Pity us ! ’

124492	124682	124480	124480	Bitzer	77	‘ since you ask me what motive I have in reason , for taking young Mr. Tom back to Coketown , it is only reasonable to let you know . I have suspected young Mr. Tom of this bank - robbery from the first . I had had my eye upon him before that time , for I knew his ways . I have kept my observations to myself , but I have made them ; and I have got ample proofs against him now , besides his running away , and besides his own confession , which I was just in time to overhear . I had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday morning , and following you here . I am going to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown , in order to deliver him over to Mr. Bounderby . Sir , I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby will then promote me to young Mr. Tom ’s situation . And I wish to have his situation , sir , for it will be a rise to me , and will do me good . ’
124683	124697	124698	124699	Mr. Gradgrind	75	‘ If this is solely a question of self - interest with you — ’

124717	124783	124715	124715	Bitzer	77	‘ but I am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self - interest . What you must always appeal to , is a person ’s self - interest . It ’s your only hold . We are so constituted . I was brought up in that catechism when I was very young , sir , as you are aware . ’

124815	124885	124813	124813	Bitzer	77	‘ for hinting at the proposal ; but I will not set any sum against it . Knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative , I have gone over the calculations in my mind ; and I find that to compound a felony , even on very high terms indeed , would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the Bank . ’

124911	124975	124900	124900	he	75	‘ Bitzer , I have but one chance left to soften you . You were many years at my school . If , in remembrance of the pains bestowed upon you there , you can persuade yourself in any degree to disregard your present interest and release my son , I entreat and pray you to give him the benefit of that remembrance . ’

125136	125168	125134	125134	Bitzer	77	‘ that my schooling was cheap . But that comes right , sir . I was made in the cheapest market , and have to dispose of myself in the dearest . ’

125193	125276	125191	125191	he	77	‘ it ’s of no use doing that : it only worries . You seem to think that I have some animosity against young Mr. Tom ; whereas I have none at all . I am only going , on the reasonable grounds I have mentioned , to take him back to Coketown . If he was to resist , I should set up the cry of Stop thief ! But , he wo n’t resist , you may depend upon it . ’

It was a fine sight , to behold the learned dog barking round it , and Mr. Sleary instructing him , with his one practicable eye , that Bitzer was the object of his particular attentions . Soon after dark they all three got in and started ; the learned dog ( a formidable creature ) already pinning Bitzer with his eye , and sticking close to the wheel on his side , that he might be ready for him in the event of his showing the slightest disposition to alight . The other three sat up at the inn all night in great suspense . At eight o’clock in the morning Mr. Sleary and the dog reappeared : both in high spirits . ‘

128280	128350	128362	128363	Mrs. Sparsit	92	‘ You can take your own time for going , ma’am ; but perhaps in the meanwhile , it will be more agreeable to a lady of your powers of mind , to eat her meals by herself , and not to be intruded upon . I really ought to apologise to you — being only Josiah Bounderby of Coketown — for having stood in your light so long . ’

Nothing that a Noodle does , can awaken surprise or indignation ; the proceedings of a Noodle can only inspire contempt . ’
