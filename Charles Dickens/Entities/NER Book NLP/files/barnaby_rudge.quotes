But I could hardly have respected him more , whatever the stimulating influences of this sight might have been . He had not the least respect , I am sorry to say , for me in return , or for anybody but the cook ; to whom he was attached -- but only , I fear , as a Policeman might have been . Once , I met him unexpectedly , about half - a - mile from my house , walking down the middle of a public street , attended by a pretty large crowd , and spontaneously exhibiting the whole of his accomplishments . His gravity under those trying circumstances , I can never forget , nor the extraordinary gallantry with which , refusing to be brought home , he defended himself behind a pump , until overpowered by numbers . It may have been that he was too bright a genius to live long , or it may have been that he took some pernicious substance into his bill , and thence into his maw -- which is not improbable , seeing that he new - pointed the greater part of the garden - wall by digging out the mortar , broke countless squares of glass by scraping away the putty all round the frames , and tore up and swallowed , in splinters , the greater part of a wooden staircase of six steps and a landing -- but after some three years he too was taken ill , and died before the kitchen fire . He kept his eye to the last upon the meat as it roasted , and suddenly turned over on his back with a sepulchral cry of ‘

No account of the Gordon Riots having been to my knowledge introduced into any Work of Fiction , and the subject presenting very extraordinary and remarkable features , I was led to project this Tale . It is unnecessary to say , that those shameful tumults , while they reflect indelible disgrace upon the time in which they occurred , and all who had act or part in them , teach a good lesson . That what we falsely call a religious cry is easily raised by men who have no religion , and who in their daily practice set at nought the commonest principles of right and wrong ; that it is begotten of intolerance and persecution ; that it is senseless , besotted , inveterate and unmerciful ; all History teaches us . But perhaps we do not know it in our hearts too well , to profit by even so humble an example as the ‘

However imperfectly those disturbances are set forth in the following pages , they are impartially painted by one who has no sympathy with the Romish Church , though he acknowledges , as most men do , some esteemed friends among the followers of its creed . In the description of the principal outrages , reference has been had to the best authorities of that time , such as they are ; the account given in this Tale , of all the main features of the Riots , is substantially correct . Mr Dennis ’s allusions to the flourishing condition of his trade in those days , have their foundation in Truth , and not in the Author ’s fancy . Any file of old Newspapers , or odd volume of the Annual Register , will prove this with terrible ease . Even the case of Mary Jones , dwelt upon with so much pleasure by the same character , is no effort of invention . The facts were stated , exactly as they are stated here , in the House of Commons . Whether they afforded as much entertainment to the merry gentlemen assembled there , as some other most affecting circumstances of a similar nature mentioned by Sir Samuel Romilly , is not recorded . That the case of Mary Jones may speak the more emphatically for itself , I subjoin it , as related by SIR WILLIAM MEREDITH in a speech in Parliament , ‘

1494	2754	1480	1481	the child	458	’ Chapter 1 In the year 1775 , there stood upon the borders of Epping Forest , at a distance of about twelve miles from London -- measuring from the Standard in Cornhill , or rather from the spot on or near to which the Standard used to be in days of yore -- a house of public entertainment called the Maypole ; which fact was demonstrated to all such travellers as could neither read nor write ( and at that time a vast number both of travellers and stay - at - homes were in this condition ) by the emblem reared on the roadside over against the house , which , if not of those goodly proportions that Maypoles were wo nt to present in olden times , was a fair young ash , thirty feet in height , and straight as any arrow that ever English yeoman drew . The Maypole -- by which term from henceforth is meant the house , and not its sign -- the Maypole was an old building , with more gable ends than a lazy man would care to count on a sunny day ; huge zig - zag chimneys , out of which it seemed as though even smoke could not choose but come in more than naturally fantastic shapes , imparted to it in its tortuous progress ; and vast stables , gloomy , ruinous , and empty . The place was said to have been built in the days of King Henry the Eighth ; and there was a legend , not only that Queen Elizabeth had slept there one night while upon a hunting excursion , to wit , in a certain oak - panelled room with a deep bay window , but that next morning , while standing on a mounting block before the door with one foot in the stirrup , the virgin monarch had then and there boxed and cuffed an unlucky page for some neglect of duty . The matter - of - fact and doubtful folks , of whom there were a few among the Maypole customers , as unluckily there always are in every little community , were inclined to look upon this tradition as rather apocryphal ; but , whenever the landlord of that ancient hostelry appealed to the mounting block itself as evidence , and triumphantly pointed out that there it stood in the same place to that very day , the doubters never failed to be put down by a large majority , and all true believers exulted as in a victory . Whether these , and many other stories of the like nature , were true or untrue , the Maypole was really an old house , a very old house , perhaps as old as it claimed to be , and perhaps older , which will sometimes happen with houses of an uncertain , as with ladies of a certain , age . Its windows were old diamond - pane lattices , its floors were sunken and uneven , its ceilings blackened by the hand of time , and heavy with massive beams . Over the doorway was an ancient porch , quaintly and grotesquely carved ; and here on summer evenings the more favoured customers smoked and drank -- ay , and sang many a good song too , sometimes -- reposing on two grim - looking high - backed settles , which , like the twin dragons of some fairy tale , guarded the entrance to the mansion . In the chimneys of the disused rooms , swallows had built their nests for many a long year , and from earliest spring to latest autumn whole colonies of sparrows chirped and twittered in the eaves . There were more pigeons about the dreary stable - yard and out - buildings than anybody but the landlord could reckon up . The wheeling and circling flights of runts , fantails , tumblers , and pouters , were perhaps not quite consistent with the grave and sober character of the building , but the monotonous cooing , which never ceased to be raised by some among them all day long , suited it exactly , and seemed to lull it to rest . With its overhanging stories , drowsy little panes of glass , and front bulging out and projecting over the pathway , the old house looked as if it were nodding in its sleep . Indeed , it needed no very great stretch of fancy to detect in it other resemblances to humanity . The bricks of which it was built had originally been a deep dark red , but had grown yellow and discoloured like an old man ’s skin ; the sturdy timbers had decayed like teeth ; and here and there the ivy , like a warm garment to comfort it in its age , wrapt its green leaves closely round the time - worn walls . It was a hale and hearty age though , still : and in the summer or autumn evenings , when the glow of the setting sun fell upon the oak and chestnut trees of the adjacent forest , the old house , partaking of its lustre , seemed their fit companion , and to have many good years of life in him yet . The evening with which we have to do , was neither a summer nor an autumn one , but the twilight of a day in March , when the wind howled dismally among the bare branches of the trees , and rumbling in the wide chimneys and driving the rain against the windows of the Maypole Inn , gave such of its frequenters as chanced to be there at the moment an undeniable reason for prolonging their stay , and caused the landlord to prophesy that the night would certainly clear at eleven o’clock precisely,--which by a remarkable coincidence was the hour at which he always closed his house . The name of him upon whom the spirit of prophecy thus descended was John Willet , a burly , large - headed man with a fat face , which betokened profound obstinacy and slowness of apprehension , combined with a very strong reliance upon his own merits . It was John Willet ’s ordinary boast in his more placid moods that if he were slow he was sure ; which assertion could , in one sense at least , be by no means gainsaid , seeing that he was in everything unquestionably the reverse of fast , and withal one of the most dogged and positive fellows in existence -- always sure that what he thought or said or did was right , and holding it as a thing quite settled and ordained by the laws of nature and Providence , that anybody who said or did or thought otherwise must be inevitably and of necessity wrong . Mr Willet walked slowly up to the window , flattened his fat nose against the cold glass , and shading his eyes that his sight might not be affected by the ruddy glow of the fire , looked abroad . Then he walked slowly back to his old seat in the chimney - corner , and , composing himself in it with a slight shiver , such as a man might give way to and so acquire an additional relish for the warm blaze , said , looking round upon his guests : ‘
2774	2775	2778	2778	you	459	’ ‘
2783	2793	2778	2778	you	459	’ said a little man in the opposite corner . ‘
2807	2855	2802	2802	she	460	’ John looked sedately and solemnly at his questioner until he had brought his mind to bear upon the whole of his observation , and then made answer , in a tone which seemed to imply that the moon was peculiarly his business and nobody else ’s : ‘
2884	2885	2878	2878	I	0	’ ‘
2891	2915	2878	2878	I	0	’ said the little man . Again John waited leisurely until the observation had thoroughly penetrated to his brain , and then replying , ‘
2921	3754	2878	2878	I	0	’ applied a light to his pipe and smoked in placid silence ; now and then casting a sidelong look at a man wrapped in a loose riding - coat with huge cuffs ornamented with tarnished silver lace and large metal buttons , who sat apart from the regular frequenters of the house , and wearing a hat flapped over his face , which was still further shaded by the hand on which his forehead rested , looked unsociable enough . There was another guest , who sat , booted and spurred , at some distance from the fire also , and whose thoughts -- to judge from his folded arms and knitted brows , and from the untasted liquor before him -- were occupied with other matters than the topics under discussion or the persons who discussed them . This was a young man of about eight - and - twenty , rather above the middle height , and though of somewhat slight figure , gracefully and strongly made . He wore his own dark hair , and was accoutred in a riding dress , which together with his large boots ( resembling in shape and fashion those worn by our Life Guardsmen at the present day ) , showed indisputable traces of the bad condition of the roads . But travel - stained though he was , he was well and even richly attired , and without being overdressed looked a gallant gentleman . Lying upon the table beside him , as he had carelessly thrown them down , were a heavy riding - whip and a slouched hat , the latter worn no doubt as being best suited to the inclemency of the weather . There , too , were a pair of pistols in a holster - case , and a short riding - cloak . Little of his face was visible , except the long dark lashes which concealed his downcast eyes , but an air of careless ease and natural gracefulness of demeanour pervaded the figure , and seemed to comprehend even those slight accessories , which were all handsome , and in good keeping . Towards this young gentleman the eyes of Mr Willet wandered but once , and then as if in mute inquiry whether he had observed his silent neighbour . It was plain that John and the young gentleman had often met before . Finding that his look was not returned , or indeed observed by the person to whom it was addressed , John gradually concentrated the whole power of his eyes into one focus , and brought it to bear upon the man in the flapped hat , at whom he came to stare in course of time with an intensity so remarkable , that it affected his fireside cronies , who all , as with one accord , took their pipes from their lips , and stared with open mouths at the stranger likewise . The sturdy landlord had a large pair of dull fish - like eyes , and the little man who had hazarded the remark about the moon ( and who was the parish - clerk and bell - ringer of Chigwell , a village hard by ) had little round black shiny eyes like beads ; moreover this little man wore at the knees of his rusty black breeches , and on his rusty black coat , and all down his long flapped waistcoat , little queer buttons like nothing except his eyes ; but so like them , that as they twinkled and glistened in the light of the fire , which shone too in his bright shoe - buckles , he seemed all eyes from head to foot , and to be gazing with every one of them at the unknown customer . No wonder that a man should grow restless under such an inspection as this , to say nothing of the eyes belonging to short Tom Cobb the general chandler and post - office keeper , and long Phil Parkes the ranger , both of whom , infected by the example of their companions , regarded him of the flapped hat no less attentively . The stranger became restless ; perhaps from being exposed to this raking fire of eyes , perhaps from the nature of his previous meditations -- most probably from the latter cause , for as he changed his position and looked hastily round , he started to find himself the object of such keen regard , and darted an angry and suspicious glance at the fireside group . It had the effect of immediately diverting all eyes to the chimney , except those of John Willet , who finding himself as it were , caught in the fact , and not being ( as has been already observed ) of a very ready nature , remained staring at his guest in a particularly awkward and disconcerted manner . ‘
3757	3778	3779	3779	I	0	’ said the stranger . Well . There was not much in well . It was not a long speech . ‘
3786	3944	3781	3781	you	461	’ said the landlord , after a pause of two or three minutes for consideration . The stranger took off his hat , and disclosed the hard features of a man of sixty or thereabouts , much weatherbeaten and worn by time , and the naturally harsh expression of which was not improved by a dark handkerchief which was bound tightly round his head , and , while it served the purpose of a wig , shaded his forehead , and almost hid his eyebrows . If it were intended to conceal or divert attention from a deep gash , now healed into an ugly seam , which when it was first inflicted must have laid bare his cheekbone , the object was but indifferently attained , for it could scarcely fail to be noted at a glance . His complexion was of a cadaverous hue , and he had a grizzly jagged beard of some three weeks ’

4007	4019	4021	4021	Parkes	196	‘ Do you suppose highwaymen do n’t dress handsomer than that ? ’
4023	4053	4021	4021	Parkes	196	‘ It ’s a better business than you think for , Tom , and highwaymen do n’t need or use to be shabby , take my word for it . ’

4192	4237	4190	4190	Joe	197	‘ where ’s the public - house within a mile or so of the Maypole ? He means the great house -- the Warren -- naturally and of course . The old red brick house , sir , that stands in its own grounds-- ? ’
4238	4241	4243	4244	the stranger	7287	‘ Aye , ’
4246	4284	4286	4288	the young man	476	‘ And that fifteen or twenty years ago stood in a park five times as broad , which with other and richer property has bit by bit changed hands and dwindled away -- more ’s the pity ! ’
4290	4293	4190	4190	Joe	197	‘ Maybe , ’
4298	4328	4190	4190	Joe	197	‘ But my question related to the owner . What it has been I do n’t care to know , and what it is I can see for myself . ’
4370	4398	4346	4348	the young gentleman	7283	‘ The owner ’s name is Haredale , Mr Geoffrey Haredale , and’--again he glanced in the same direction as before--‘and a worthy gentleman too -- hem ! ’
4424	4458	4418	4419	the stranger	7287	‘ I turned out of my way coming here , and took the footpath that crosses the grounds . Who was the young lady that I saw entering a carriage ? His daughter ? ’
4459	4470	4472	4472	Joe	197	‘ Why , how should I know , honest man ? ’
4498	4527	4472	4472	Joe	197	‘ I did n’t see the young lady , you know . Whew ! There ’s the wind again -- AND rain -- well it IS a night ! ’
4532	4538	4539	4539	You	482	’ observed the strange man . ‘
4540	4545	4547	4547	Joe	197	’re used to it ? ’
4562	4566	4568	4569	the other	483	‘ Pretty well , ’
4571	4583	4568	4569	the other	483	‘ About the young lady -- has Mr Haredale a daughter ? ’
4584	4589	4591	4593	the young fellow	484	‘ No , no , ’
4596	4625	4591	4593	the young fellow	484	‘ he ’s a single gentleman -- he’s -- be quiet , ca n’t you , man ? Do n’t you see this talk is not relished yonder ? ’
4644	4666	4639	4640	his tormentor	485	‘ Single men have had daughters before now . Perhaps she may be his daughter , though he is not married . ’
4667	4673	4675	4675	Joe	197	‘ What do you mean ? ’
4687	4701	4675	4675	Joe	197	‘ You ’ll come in for it presently , I know you will ! ’
4702	4711	4682	4682	he	197	‘ I mean no harm’--returned the traveller boldly , ‘
4796	4992	4781	4781	I	0	’ The latter observation was addressed to the obvious cause of Joe Willet ’s discomposure , who had risen and was adjusting his riding - cloak preparatory to sallying abroad . Briefly replying that he could give him no information , the young man beckoned to Joe , and handing him a piece of money in payment of his reckoning , hurried out attended by young Willet himself , who taking up a candle followed to light him to the house - door . While Joe was absent on this errand , the elder Willet and his three companions continued to smoke with profound gravity , and in a deep silence , each having his eyes fixed on a huge copper boiler that was suspended over the fire . After some time John Willet slowly shook his head , and thereupon his friends slowly shook theirs ; but no man withdrew his eyes from the boiler , or altered the solemn expression of his countenance in the slightest degree . At length Joe returned -- very talkative and conciliatory , as though with a strong presentiment that he was going to be found fault with . ‘
5000	5017	5018	5018	He	491	’ he said , drawing a chair near the fire , and looking round for sympathy . ‘
5107	5128	5106	5106	I	0	’m not in love ( at least I do n’t think I am ) and that ’s the whole difference . ’
5129	5136	5138	5139	the stranger	7287	‘ He is in love then ? ’
5141	5144	5146	5146	Joe	197	‘ Rather , ’
5148	5164	5146	5146	Joe	197	‘ He ’ll never be more in love , and may very easily be less . ’
5165	5170	5172	5173	his father	470	‘ Silence , sir ! ’
5175	5184	5186	5187	Long Parkes	202	‘ What a chap you are , Joe ! ’
5189	5195	5197	5198	Tom Cobb	195	‘ Such a inconsiderate lad ! ’
5200	5216	5218	5221	the parish - clerk	7290	‘ Putting himself forward and wringing the very nose off his own father ’s face ! ’
5225	5231	5233	5234	poor Joe	197	‘ What HAVE I done ? ’
5236	5241	5243	5244	his father	470	‘ Silence , sir ! ’
5246	5281	5243	5244	his father	470	‘ what do you mean by talking , when you see people that are more than two or three times your age , sitting still and silent and not dreaming of saying a word ? ’
5282	5298	5300	5300	Joe	197	‘ Why that ’s the proper time for me to talk , is n’t it ? ’
5303	5310	5312	5313	his father	470	‘ The proper time , sir ! ’
5315	5323	5312	5313	his father	470	‘ the proper time ’s no time . ’
5324	5330	5332	5332	Parkes	202	‘ Ah to be sure ! ’
5354	5364	5366	5367	John Willet	193	‘ The proper time ’s no time , sir , ’
5369	5396	5366	5367	John Willet	193	‘ when I was your age I never talked , I never wanted to talk . I listened and improved myself that ’s what I did . ’
5397	5422	5424	5424	Parkes	202	‘ And you ’d find your father rather a tough customer in argeyment , Joe , if anybody was to try and tackle him , ’
5426	5431	5424	5424	Parkes	202	‘ For the matter o ’
5436	5469	5366	5367	John Willet	193	’ observed Mr Willet , blowing a long , thin , spiral cloud of smoke out of the corner of his mouth , and staring at it abstractedly as it floated away ; ‘
5474	5507	5424	5424	Parkes	202	’ that , Phil , argeyment is a gift of Natur . If Natur has gifted a man with powers of argeyment , a man has a right to make the best of ‘
5572	5611	5612	5612	You	504	’ The landlord pausing here for a very long time , Mr Parkes naturally concluded that he had brought his discourse to an end ; and therefore , turning to the young man with some austerity , exclaimed : ‘
5633	5638	5632	5632	I	0	’m thinking , sir . ’
5639	5642	5644	5645	John Willet	193	‘ IF , ’
5689	5767	5769	5769	John	193	‘ IF , sir , Natur has fixed upon me the gift of argeyment , why should I not own to it , and rather glory in the same ? Yes , sir , I AM a tough customer that way . You are right , sir . My toughness has been proved , sir , in this room many and many a time , as I think you know ; and if you do n’t know , ’
5779	5797	5769	5769	John	193	‘ so much the better , for I an’t proud and am not going to tell you . ’
5854	5862	5864	5864	Joe	197	‘ It ’s all very fine talking , ’
5878	5888	5864	5864	Joe	197	‘ But if you mean to tell me that I ’m
5894	5895	5898	5898	sir	7320	’ ‘
5900	5905	5898	5898	sir	7320	’ roared his father . ‘
5924	5939	5946	5946	you	7320	’re spoke to , you speak . When your opinion ’s not wanted and you ’re
6019	6020	6014	6017	King George the Second	201	’ ‘
6034	6062	6014	6017	King George the Second	201	’ said the parish - clerk , who , as the representative of church and state in that company , held himself bound to the nicest loyalty . ‘
6098	6099	6101	6101	you	523	’ ‘
6110	6115	6117	6117	I	0	’ said Mr Willet . ‘
6120	6125	6117	6117	I	0	’ replied the clerk . ‘
6129	6134	6117	6117	I	0	’ said Mr Willet . ‘
6231	6275	6277	6277	you	534	’ This elucidation of a knotty point being received with such marks of approval as to put John Willet into a good humour , he contented himself with repeating to his son his command of silence , and addressing the stranger , said : ‘
6319	6320	6313	6315	Mr Geoffrey Haredale	206	’ ‘
6326	6333	6313	6315	Mr Geoffrey Haredale	206	’ said the man , carelessly . ‘
6336	6341	6313	6315	Mr Geoffrey Haredale	206	’ rejoined the landlord , ‘
6352	6353	6348	6348	he	539	’ ‘
6357	6362	6348	6348	he	539	’ cried the other . ‘
6372	6401	6348	6348	he	539	’ said the landlord . The cronies nodded to each other , and Mr Parkes remarked in an undertone , shaking his head meanwhile as who should say , ‘
6415	6449	6409	6409	I	0	’ that John Willet was in amazing force to - night , and fit to tackle a Chief Justice . The stranger suffered a short pause to elapse , and then asked abruptly , ‘
6455	6456	6452	6452	you	0	’ ‘
6465	6470	6463	6463	friend	541	’ returned John Willet . ‘
6483	6484	6480	6480	you	0	’ ‘
6489	6497	6480	6480	you	0	’ said the strange man , gruffly ; ‘
6589	6590	6582	6582	you	0	’ ‘
6593	6611	6582	6582	you	0	’ returned the landlord , a little brought down from his dignity by the stranger ’s surliness , ‘
6665	6879	6882	6884	Mr Reuben Haredale	206	’ The man glanced at the parish - clerk , whose air of consciousness and importance plainly betokened him to be the person referred to , and , observing that he had taken his pipe from his lips , after a very long whiff to keep it alight , and was evidently about to tell his story without further solicitation , gathered his large coat about him , and shrinking further back was almost lost in the gloom of the spacious chimney - corner , except when the flame , struggling from under a great faggot , whose weight almost crushed it for the time , shot upward with a strong and sudden glare , and illumining his figure for a moment , seemed afterwards to cast it into deeper obscurity than before . By this flickering light , which made the old room , with its heavy timbers and panelled walls , look as if it were built of polished ebony -- the wind roaring and howling without , now rattling the latch and creaking the hinges of the stout oaken door , and now driving at the casement as though it would beat it in -- by this light , and under circumstances so auspicious , Solomon Daisy began his tale : ‘
6891	6920	6921	6921	Cobb	195	’ Here he came to a dead stop , and made so long a pause that even John Willet grew impatient and asked why he did not proceed . ‘
6923	6940	6921	6921	Cobb	195	’ said Solomon Daisy , dropping his voice and appealing to the post - office keeper ; ‘

6954	6955	6921	6921	Cobb	195	’ ‘
6959	6967	6921	6921	Cobb	195	’ said the clerk , bending forward , ‘
6978	6992	6995	6997	Mr Reuben Haredale	206	’ In a low voice they all acquiesced , and Solomon went on : ‘
7104	7206	7207	7208	Mr Haredale	206	’ Although the speaker addressed himself to the man who had shown so much curiosity about this same family , and made a pause here as if expecting some exclamation of surprise or encouragement , the latter made no remark , nor gave any indication that he heard or was interested in what was said . Solomon therefore turned to his old companions , whose noses were brightly illuminated by the deep red glow from the bowls of their pipes ; assured , by long experience , of their attention , and resolved to show his sense of such indecent behaviour . ‘
7210	7222	7207	7208	Mr Haredale	206	’ said Solomon , turning his back upon the strange man , ‘
7300	7348	7352	7354	two women servants	555	’ Mr Daisy stopped to take a whiff at his pipe , which was going out , and then proceeded -- at first in a snuffling tone , occasioned by keen enjoyment of the tobacco and strong pulling at the pipe , and afterwards with increasing distinctness : ‘
7424	7475	7385	7392	an old gentleman who lived at Chigwell Row	562	’ There was a movement in the little group of listeners , sufficiently indicative of the strong repugnance any one of them would have felt to have turned out at such a time upon such an errand . The clerk felt and understood it , and pursued his theme accordingly . ‘
7628	7702	7723	7723	I	0	’ At this point of the narrative , the dress of the strange man rustled as if he had turned himself to hear more distinctly . Slightly pointing over his shoulder , Solomon elevated his eyebrows and nodded a silent inquiry to Joe whether this was the case . Joe shaded his eyes with his hand and peered into the corner , but could make out nothing , and so shook his head . ‘
7836	8074	8086	8086	I	0	‘ I sat down to trim the candle , and when I had done so I could not persuade myself to get up again , and go about my work . I do n’t know how it was , but I thought of all the ghost stories I had ever heard , even those that I had heard when I was a boy at school , and had forgotten long ago ; and they did n’t come into my mind one after another , but all crowding at once , like . I recollected one story there was in the village , how that on a certain night in the year ( it might be that very night for anything I knew ) , all the dead people came out of the ground and sat at the heads of their own graves till morning . This made me think how many people I had known , were buried between the church - door and the churchyard gate , and what a dreadful thing it would be to have to pass among them and know them again , so earthy and unlike themselves . I had known all the niches and arches in the church from a child ; still , I could n’t persuade myself that those were their natural shadows which I saw on the pavement , but felt sure there were some ugly figures hiding among ‘
8187	8298	8299	8299	I	0	‘ I heard the ringing of another bell , and a deep bell too , plainly . It was only for an instant , and even then the wind carried the sound away , but I heard it . I listened for a long time , but it rang no more . I had heard of corpse candles , and at last I persuaded myself that this must be a corpse bell tolling of itself at midnight for the dead . I tolled my bell -- how , or how long , I do n’t know -- and ran home to bed as fast as I could touch the ground . ‘
8394	8402	8390	8390	he	206	‘ That was the bell I heard . ‘
8699	8702	8777	8777	he	205	’ Chapter 2 ‘
8707	8732	8777	8777	he	205	’ said the man who had been the cause of the narration.--‘Stranger still if it comes about as you predict . Is that all ? ’
8790	8795	8777	8777	he	205	‘ Is that all ? ’
8808	8813	8814	8814	he	205	‘ Is that all ? ’
8817	8833	8814	8814	he	205	‘ yes , that ’s all , sir . And enough too , I think . ’
8834	8869	8814	8814	he	205	‘ I think so too . My horse , young man ! He is but a hack hired from a roadside posting house , but he must carry me to London to - night . ’
8870	8875	8877	8877	Joe	197	‘ To - night ! ’
8879	8884	8886	8887	the other	483	‘ To - night , ’
8889	8915	8886	8887	the other	483	‘ What do you stare at ? This tavern would seem to be a house of call for all the gaping idlers of the neighbourhood ! ’
8983	9039	8960	8960	Joe	197	‘ It is not a very bold thing to wonder at your going on to - night . Surely you have been asked such a harmless question in an inn before , and in better weather than this . I thought you might n’t know the way , as you seem strange to this part . ’
9040	9043	9045	9046	the other	483	‘ The way-- ’
9050	9058	9045	9046	the other	483	‘ Yes . DO you know it ? ’
9059	9066	9068	9069	the man	472	‘ I’ll -- humph!--I’ll find it , ’
9080	9088	9068	9069	the man	472	‘ Landlord , take the reckoning here . ’
9231	9240	9242	9242	Joe	197	‘ He ’s pretty much of my opinion , ’
9251	9272	9242	9242	Joe	197	‘ I ’ll wager that your stopping here to - night would please him better than it would please me . ’
9273	9294	9348	9348	he	7287	‘ He and I are of different opinions , as we have been more than once on our way here , ’
9300	9320	9321	9322	The stranger	7287	‘ So I was thinking before you came out , for he has felt your spurs , poor beast . ’
9337	9347	9348	9348	he	7287	‘ You ’ll know me again , I see , ’
9367	9405	9348	9348	he	7287	‘ The man ’s worth knowing , master , who travels a road he do n’t know , mounted on a jaded horse , and leaves good quarters to do it on such a night as this . ’
9406	9419	9463	9463	he	472	‘ You have sharp eyes and a sharp tongue , I find . ’
9420	9438	9463	9463	he	472	‘ Both I hope by nature , but the last grows rusty sometimes for want of using . ’
9439	9456	9458	9459	the man	472	‘ Use the first less too , and keep their sharpness for your sweethearts , boy , ’
10140	10143	10148	10149	a man	7264	‘ Yoho ! ’
10151	10160	10148	10149	a man	7264	‘ What ’s that ? Who goes there ? ’
10161	10165	10167	10168	the traveller	7341	‘ A friend ! ’
10170	10174	10176	10177	the voice	635	‘ A friend ! ’
10179	10223	10176	10177	the voice	635	‘ Who calls himself a friend and rides like that , abusing Heaven ’s gifts in the shape of horseflesh , and endangering , not only his own neck ( which might be no great matter ) but the necks of other people ? ’
10224	10234	10236	10237	the traveller	7341	‘ You have a lantern there , I see , ’
10240	10263	10236	10237	the traveller	7341	‘ lend it me for a moment . You have wounded my horse , I think , with your shaft or wheel . ’
10264	10268	10270	10271	the other	483	‘ Wounded him ! ’
10273	10304	10270	10271	the other	483	‘ if I have n’t killed him , it ’s no fault of yours . What do you mean by galloping along the king ’s highway like that , eh ? ’
10305	10311	10313	10314	the traveller	7341	‘ Give me the light , ’
10322	10340	10313	10314	the traveller	7341	‘ and do n’t ask idle questions of a man who is in no mood for talking . ’
10341	10366	10270	10271	the other	483	‘ If you had said you were in no mood for talking before , I should perhaps have been in no mood for lighting , ’
10371	10406	10270	10271	the other	483	‘ Hows’ever as it ’s the poor horse that ’s damaged and not you , one of you is welcome to the light at all events -- but it ’s not the crusty one . ’
10742	10748	10750	10751	the traveller	7341	‘ He is not hurt , ’
10763	10775	10777	10779	the old man	655	‘ You have found that out at last , have you ? ’
10781	10799	10777	10779	the old man	655	‘ My eyes have seen more light than yours , but I would n’t change with you . ’
10800	10806	10750	10751	the traveller	7341	‘ What do you mean ? ’
10807	10842	10849	10850	the man	472	‘ Mean ! I could have told you he was n’t hurt , five minutes ago . Give me the light , friend ; ride forward at a gentler pace ; and good night . ’
10880	10901	10903	10908	the old man in the chaise	659	‘ Did you never see a locksmith before , that you start as if you had come upon a ghost ? ’
10910	10915	10916	10916	he	655	‘ or is this , ’
10933	11046	10916	10916	he	655	‘ a scheme for robbing me ? I know these roads , friend . When I travel them , I carry nothing but a few shillings , and not a crown ’s worth of them . I tell you plainly , to save us both trouble , that there ’s nothing to be got from me but a pretty stout arm considering my years , and this tool , which , mayhap from long acquaintance with , I can use pretty briskly . You shall not have it all your own way , I promise you , if you play at that game . With these words he stood upon the defensive . ‘
11059	11064	11056	11057	Gabriel Varden	212	’ replied the other . ‘
11072	11077	11078	11078	You	660	’ returned the locksmith . ‘
11091	11092	11089	11089	yours	660	’ ‘
11120	11125	11126	11126	You	660	’ replied the traveller . ‘
11141	11151	11157	11157	me	0	’ said Varden , descending nimbly from his chaise ; ‘
11162	11203	11157	11157	me	0	’ While the locksmith alighted , the traveller had regained his saddle , from which he now confronted the old man , who , moving as the horse moved in chafing under the tightened rein , kept close beside him . ‘
11213	11214	11210	11210	I	0	’ ‘
11218	11219	11210	11210	I	0	’ ‘

11261	11493	11256	11256	me	0	’ Finding that further resistance would only involve him in a personal struggle with an antagonist by no means to be despised , the traveller threw back his coat , and stooping down looked steadily at the locksmith . Perhaps two men more powerfully contrasted , never opposed each other face to face . The ruddy features of the locksmith so set off and heightened the excessive paleness of the man on horseback , that he looked like a bloodless ghost , while the moisture , which hard riding had brought out upon his skin , hung there in dark and heavy drops , like dews of agony and death . The countenance of the old locksmith lighted up with the smile of one expecting to detect in this unpromising stranger some latent roguery of eye or lip , which should reveal a familiar person in that arch disguise , and spoil his jest . The face of the other , sullen and fierce , but shrinking too , was that of a man who stood at bay ; while his firmly closed jaws , his puckered mouth , and more than all a certain stealthy motion of the hand within his breast , seemed to announce a desperate purpose very foreign to acting , or child ’s play . Thus they regarded each other for some time , in silence . ‘
11496	11506	11256	11256	me	0	’ he said when he had scanned his features ; ‘
11513	11514	11507	11507	I	0	’ ‘
11527	11532	11534	11534	Gabriel	212	‘ I do n’t , ’
11536	11557	11534	11534	Gabriel	212	‘ to be plain with you , friend , you do n’t carry in your countenance a letter of recommendation . ’
11558	11565	11567	11568	the traveller	7341	‘ It ’s not my wish , ’
11570	11578	11567	11568	the traveller	7341	‘ My humour is to be avoided . ’
11579	11582	11584	11585	the locksmith	7447	‘ Well , ’
11588	11597	11584	11585	the locksmith	7447	‘ I think you ’ll have your humour . ’
11598	11606	11608	11609	the traveller	7341	‘ I will , at any cost , ’
11611	11666	11608	11609	the traveller	7341	‘ In proof of it , lay this to heart -- that you were never in such peril of your life as you have been within these few moments ; when you are within five minutes of breathing your last , you will not be nearer death than you have been to - night ! ’
11667	11670	11672	11674	the sturdy locksmith	668	‘ Aye ! ’
11676	11684	11672	11674	the sturdy locksmith	668	‘ Aye ! and a violent death . ’
11685	11690	11608	11609	the traveller	7341	‘ From whose hand ? ’
11691	11695	11697	11698	the traveller	7341	‘ From mine , ’
11834	11936	11937	11937	Gabriel	212	‘ What in the name of wonder can this fellow be ! a madman ? a highwayman ? a cut - throat ? If he had not scoured off so fast , we ’d have seen who was in most danger , he or I. I never nearer death than I have been to - night ! I hope I may be no nearer to it for a score of years to come -- if so , I ’ll be content to be no farther from it . My stars!--a pretty brag this to a stout man -- pooh , pooh ! ’
11961	12089	11950	11951	the traveller	7341	‘ The Maypole -- two miles to the Maypole . I came the other road from the Warren after a long day ’s work at locks and bells , on purpose that I should not come by the Maypole and break my promise to Martha by looking in -- there ’s resolution ! It would be dangerous to go on to London without a light ; and it ’s four miles , and a good half mile besides , to the Halfway - House ; and between this and that is the very place where one needs a light most . Two miles to the Maypole ! I told Martha I would n’t ; I said I would n’t , and I didn’t -- there ’s resolution ! ’
12429	12436	12438	12439	the locksmith	7447	‘ The merciful man , Joe , ’
12441	12457	12438	12439	the locksmith	7447	‘ is merciful to his beast . I ’ll get out for a little while . ’
12710	12724	12726	12726	Solomon	205	‘ I wish he may be an honest man , that ’s all , ’
12756	12766	12726	12726	Solomon	205	‘ I wish he may be an honest man . ’
12767	12780	12782	12783	the locksmith	7447	‘ So we all do , I suppose , do n’t we ? ’
12785	12790	12792	12792	Joe	197	‘ I do n’t , ’
12794	12797	12799	12799	Gabriel	212	‘ No ! ’
12801	12837	12799	12799	Gabriel	212	‘ No . He struck me with his whip , the coward , when he was mounted and I afoot , and I should be better pleased that he turned out what I think him . ’
12838	12847	12726	12726	Solomon	205	‘ And what may that be , Joe ? ’
12848	12899	12799	12799	Gabriel	212	‘ No good , Mr Varden . You may shake your head , father , but I say no good , and will say no good , and I would say no good a hundred times over , if that would bring him back to have the drubbing he deserves . ’
12900	12907	12909	12910	John Willet	193	‘ Hold your tongue , sir , ’
12912	12998	12909	12910	John Willet	193	‘ I wo n’t , father . It ’s all along of you that he ventured to do what he did . Seeing me treated like a child , and put down like a fool , HE plucks up a heart and has a fling at a fellow that he thinks -- and may well think too -- hasn’t a grain of spirit . But he ’s mistaken , as I ’ll show him , and as I ’ll show all of you before long . ’
12999	13011	13013	13016	the astonished John Willet	193	‘ Does the boy know what he ’s a saying of ! ’
13018	13021	13023	13023	Joe	197	‘ Father , ’
13025	13201	13023	13023	Joe	197	‘ I know what I say and mean , well -- better than you do when you hear me . I can bear with you , but I can not bear the contempt that your treating me in the way you do , brings upon me from others every day . Look at other young men of my age . Have they no liberty , no will , no right to speak ? Are they obliged to sit mumchance , and to be ordered about till they are the laughing - stock of young and old ? I am a bye - word all over Chigwell , and I say -- and it ’s fairer my saying so now , than waiting till you are dead , and I have got your money -- I say , that before long I shall be driven to break such bounds , and that when I do , it wo n’t be me that you ’ll have to blame , but your own self , and no other . ’
13433	13448	13449	13449	he	197	‘ You have always been a very good friend to me , Mr Varden , ’
13472	13500	13449	13449	he	197	‘ I take it very kind of you to say all this , but the time ’s nearly come when the Maypole and I must part company . ’
13501	13510	13512	13512	Gabriel	212	‘ Roving stones gather no moss , Joe , ’
13514	13519	13521	13521	Joe	197	‘ Nor milestones much , ’

This accomplished , and the wounded man being covered with Varden ’s own greatcoat which he took off for the purpose , they proceeded onward at a brisk pace : Barnaby gaily counting the stars upon his fingers , and Gabriel inwardly congratulating himself upon having an adventure now , which would silence Mrs Varden on the subject of the Maypole , for that night , or there was no faith in woman . Chapter 4 In the venerable suburb -- it was a suburb once -- of Clerkenwell , towards that part of its confines which is nearest to the Charter House , and in one of those cool , shady streets , of which a few , widely scattered and dispersed , yet remain in such old parts of the metropolis,--each tenement quietly vegetating like an ancient citizen who long ago retired from business , and dozing on in its infirmity until in course of time it tumbles down , and is replaced by some extravagant young heir , flaunting in stucco and ornamental work , and all the vanities of modern days,--in this quarter , and in a street of this description , the business of the present chapter lies . At the time of which it treats , though only six - and - sixty years ago , a very large part of what is London now had no existence . Even in the brains of the wildest speculators , there had sprung up no long rows of streets connecting Highgate with Whitechapel , no assemblages of palaces in the swampy levels , nor little cities in the open fields . Although this part of town was then , as now , parcelled out in streets , and plentifully peopled , it wore a different aspect . There were gardens to many of the houses , and trees by the pavement side ; with an air of freshness breathing up and down , which in these days would be sought in vain . Fields were nigh at hand , through which the New River took its winding course , and where there was merry haymaking in the summer time . Nature was not so far removed , or hard to get at , as in these days ; and although there were busy trades in Clerkenwell , and working jewellers by scores , it was a purer place , with farm - houses nearer to it than many modern Londoners would readily believe , and lovers ’

After a long and patient contemplation of the golden key , and many such backward glances , Gabriel stepped into the road , and stole a look at the upper windows . One of them chanced to be thrown open at the moment , and a roguish face met his ; a face lighted up by the loveliest pair of sparkling eyes that ever locksmith looked upon ; the face of a pretty , laughing , girl ; dimpled and fresh , and healthful -- the very impersonation of good - humour and blooming beauty . ‘
17257	17271	17094	17094	his	805	’ she whispered , bending forward and pointing archly to the window underneath . ‘

17515	17521	17467	17467	he	0	’ said Gabriel to himself . ‘
17596	17621	17576	17576	you	223	’ So saying , and shaking his head gravely , he re - entered the workshop , and confronted the subject of these remarks . ‘
17630	17635	17636	17636	You	223	’ said the locksmith . ‘

These thoughts always led him to consider what a glorious engine the ‘

19052	19066	19022	19023	the locksmith	7447	‘ All true , my dear ; true as the Gospel , Doll . ’
19067	19085	19022	19023	the locksmith	7447	‘ Young Mr Chester robbed , and lying wounded in the road , when you came up ! ’
19086	19162	19022	19025	the locksmith ’s daughter	853	‘ Ay -- Mr Edward . And beside him , Barnaby , calling for help with all his might . It was well it happened as it did ; for the road ’s a lonely one , the hour was late , and , the night being cold , and poor Barnaby even less sensible than usual from surprise and fright , the young gentleman might have met his death in a very short time . ’
19163	19171	19173	19174	his daughter	7330	‘ I dread to think of it ! ’
19179	19186	19173	19174	his daughter	7330	‘ How did you know him ? ’
19187	19191	19193	19194	the locksmith	7447	‘ Know him ! ’
19196	19243	19193	19194	the locksmith	7447	‘ I did n’t know him -- how could I ? I had never seen him , often as I had heard and spoken of him . I took him to Mrs Rudge ’s ; and she no sooner saw him than the truth came out . ’
19244	19271	19022	19025	the locksmith ’s daughter	853	‘ Miss Emma , father -- If this news should reach her , enlarged upon as it is sure to be , she will go distracted . ’
19272	19289	19291	19292	the locksmith	7447	‘ Why , lookye there again , how a man suffers for being good - natured , ’
19294	19375	19291	19292	the locksmith	7447	‘ Miss Emma was with her uncle at the masquerade at Carlisle House , where she had gone , as the people at the Warren told me , sorely against her will . What does your blockhead father when he and Mrs Rudge have laid their heads together , but goes there when he ought to be abed , makes interest with his friend the doorkeeper , slips him on a mask and domino , and mixes with the masquers . ’
19376	19384	19386	19387	the girl	813	‘ And like himself to do so ! ’

However , he mingled with the crowd , and prettily worried and badgered he was , I warrant you , with people squeaking , “ Do n’t you know me ? ” and “ I ’ve found you out , ” and all that kind of nonsense in his ears . He might have wandered on till now , but in a little room there was a young lady who had taken off her mask , on account of the place being very warm , and was sitting there alone . ’
19534	19540	19542	19543	his daughter	7330	‘ And that was she ? ’
19546	19552	19554	19555	the locksmith	7447	‘ And that was she , ’
19557	19599	19554	19555	the locksmith	7447	‘ and I no sooner whispered to her what the matter was -- as softly , Doll , and with nearly as much art as you could have used yourself -- than she gives a kind of scream and faints away . ’
19600	19610	19612	19613	his daughter	7330	‘ What did you do -- what happened next ? ’
19615	19646	19648	19649	the locksmith	7447	‘ Why , the masks came flocking round , with a general noise and hubbub , and I thought myself in luck to get clear off , that ’s all , ’
19651	19688	19648	19649	the locksmith	7447	‘ What happened when I reached home you may guess , if you did n’t hear it . Ah ! Well , it ’s a poor heart that never rejoices.--Put Toby this way , my dear . ’
19898	19911	19913	19914	the locksmith	7447	‘ Why , what the devil ’s the matter with the lad ? ’
19916	19921	19913	19914	the locksmith	7447	‘ Is he choking ? ’

19945	19959	19982	19982	he	223	‘ What do you mean by making those horrible faces over your breakfast ? ’
19960	19969	19971	19972	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Faces are matters of taste , sir , ’
19990	19993	19995	19995	Gabriel	212	‘ Sim , ’
20000	20021	20022	20022	he	7447	‘ Do n’t be a fool , for I ’d rather see you in your senses . These young fellows , ’
20030	20112	20022	20022	he	7447	‘ are always committing some folly or another . There was a quarrel between Joe Willet and old John last night though I ca n’t say Joe was much in fault either . He ’ll be missing one of these mornings , and will have gone away upon some wild - goose errand , seeking his fortune.--Why , what ’s the matter , Doll ? YOU are making faces now . The girls are as bad as the boys every bit ! ’
20113	20119	20121	20121	Dolly	216	‘ It ’s the tea , ’
20144	20162	20121	20121	Dolly	216	’ Mr Tappertit looked immensely big at a quartern loaf on the table , and breathed hard . ‘
20167	20172	20121	20121	Dolly	216	’ returned the locksmith . ‘
20222	20223	20215	20215	he	197	’ ‘
20226	20234	20215	20215	he	197	’ cried Dolly in a faint voice . ‘
20239	20240	20215	20215	he	197	’ ‘
20252	20596	20597	20597	Joe	197	’ said the locksmith . But , before his daughter could make him any answer , she was taken with a troublesome cough , and it was such a very unpleasant cough , that , when she left off , the tears were starting in her bright eyes . The good - natured locksmith was still patting her on the back and applying such gentle restoratives , when a message arrived from Mrs Varden , making known to all whom it might concern , that she felt too much indisposed to rise after her great agitation and anxiety of the previous night ; and therefore desired to be immediately accommodated with the little black teapot of strong mixed tea , a couple of rounds of buttered toast , a middling - sized dish of beef and ham cut thin , and the Protestant Manual in two volumes post octavo . Like some other ladies who in remote ages flourished upon this globe , Mrs Varden was most devout when most ill - tempered . Whenever she and her husband were at unusual variance , then the Protestant Manual was in high feather . Knowing from experience what these requests portended , the triumvirate broke up ; Dolly , to see the orders executed with all despatch ; Gabriel , to some out - of - door work in his little chaise ; and Sim , to his daily duty in the workshop , to which retreat he carried the big look , although the loaf remained behind . Indeed the big look increased immensely , and when he had tied his apron on , became quite gigantic . It was not until he had several times walked up and down with folded arms , and the longest strides he could take , and had kicked a great many small articles out of his way , that his lip began to curl . At length , a gloomy derision came upon his features , and he smiled ; uttering meanwhile with supreme contempt the monosyllable ‘
20599	20600	20601	20601	I	0	’ ‘
20613	20617	20601	20601	I	0	’ he said , ‘
20632	20673	20674	20674	Joe	197	’ He walked up and down again much quicker than before , and if possible with longer strides ; sometimes stopping to take a glance at his legs , and sometimes to jerk out , and cast from him , another ‘
20676	20707	20674	20674	Joe	197	’ In the course of a quarter of an hour or so he again assumed the paper cap and tried to work . No . It could not be done . ‘
20716	20726	20708	20708	I	0	’ said Mr Tappertit , dashing it down again , ‘
20748	20793	20746	20746	Joe	197	’ Whirr - r - r - r. The grindstone was soon in motion ; the sparks were flying off in showers . This was the occupation for his heated spirit . Whirr - r - r - r - r - r - r. ‘
20800	20820	20746	20746	Joe	197	’ said Mr Tappertit , pausing as if in triumph , and wiping his heated face upon his sleeve . ‘
20836	21092	20827	20827	I	0	’ Whirr - r - r - r - r - r - r - r. Chapter 5 As soon as the business of the day was over , the locksmith sallied forth , alone , to visit the wounded gentleman and ascertain the progress of his recovery . The house where he had left him was in a by - street in Southwark , not far from London Bridge ; and thither he hied with all speed , bent upon returning with as little delay as might be , and getting to bed betimes . The evening was boisterous -- scarcely better than the previous night had been . It was not easy for a stout man like Gabriel to keep his legs at the street corners , or to make head against the high wind , which often fairly got the better of him , and drove him back some paces , or , in defiance of all his energy , forced him to take shelter in an arch or doorway until the fury of the gust was spent . Occasionally a hat or wig , or both , came spinning and trundling past him , like a mad thing ; while the more serious spectacle of falling tiles and slates , or of masses of brick and mortar or fragments of stone - coping rattling upon the pavement near at hand , and splitting into fragments , did not increase the pleasure of the journey , or make the way less dreary . ‘
21105	21120	20827	20827	I	0	’ said the locksmith , as he knocked softly at the widow ’s door . ‘
21135	21136	21127	21127	John	193	’ ‘
21141	21562	21127	21127	John	193	’ demanded a woman ’s voice from within . Being answered , it added a hasty word of welcome , and the door was quickly opened . She was about forty -- perhaps two or three years older -- with a cheerful aspect , and a face that had once been pretty . It bore traces of affliction and care , but they were of an old date , and Time had smoothed them . Any one who had bestowed but a casual glance on Barnaby might have known that this was his mother , from the strong resemblance between them ; but where in his face there was wildness and vacancy , in hers there was the patient composure of long effort and quiet resignation . One thing about this face was very strange and startling . You could not look upon it in its most cheerful mood without feeling that it had some extraordinary capacity of expressing terror . It was not on the surface . It was in no one feature that it lingered . You could not take the eyes or mouth , or lines upon the cheek , and say , if this or that were otherwise , it would not be so . Yet there it always lurked -- something for ever dimly seen , but ever there , and never absent for a moment . It was the faintest , palest shadow of some look , to which an instant of intense and most unutterable horror only could have given birth ; but indistinct and feeble as it was , it did suggest what that look must have been , and fixed it in the mind as if it had had existence in a dream . More faintly imaged , and wanting force and purpose , as it were , because of his darkened intellect , there was this same stamp upon the son . Seen in a picture , it must have had some legend with it , and would have haunted those who looked upon the canvas . They who knew the Maypole story , and could remember what the widow was , before her husband ’s and his master ’s murder , understood it well . They recollected how the change had come , and could call to mind that when her son was born , upon the very day the deed was known , he bore upon his wrist what seemed a smear of blood but half washed out . ‘
21569	21598	21563	21563	God	217	’ said the locksmith , as he followed her , with the air of an old friend , into a little parlour where a cheerful fire was burning . ‘
21602	21607	21600	21600	you	884	’ she answered smiling . ‘
21642	21643	21672	21672	neighbour	885	’ ‘
21648	21660	21672	21672	neighbour	885	’ returned the locksmith , rubbing his hands and warming them . ‘

21773	21784	21770	21771	No ladies	895	’ said Gabriel , elevating his eyebrows and looking disappointed . ‘
21788	21793	21770	21771	No ladies	895	’ replied the widow . ‘

21926	21933	21900	21900	neighbour	885	’ said the locksmith , kindly , ‘
21953	21996	21947	21947	he	890	’ The widow shook her head . And yet , though she knew the locksmith sought to cheer her , and spoke from no conviction of his own , she was glad to hear even this praise of her poor benighted son . ‘
22001	22006	22008	22009	the locksmith	7447	‘ cute man yet , ’
22011	22041	22042	22042	he	7447	‘ Take care , when we are growing old and foolish , Barnaby does n’t put us to the blush , that ’s all . But our other friend , ’
22067	22068	22042	22042	he	7447	’ ‘
22074	22084	22042	22042	he	7447	’ rejoined the widow , with a faint smile . ‘
22093	22101	22087	22087	He	890	’ said Varden , shaking his head . ‘
22148	22149	22142	22142	Him	890	’ ‘
22152	22157	22142	22142	Him	890	’ returned the widow . ‘
22174	22189	22190	22190	They	903	‘ Tis some one knocking softly at the shutter . Who can it be ! ’
22273	22280	22282	22283	the locksmith	7447	‘ Some thief or ruffian maybe , ’
22285	22291	22282	22283	the locksmith	7447	‘ Give me the light . ’
22292	22297	22298	22298	she	908	‘ No , no , ’
22302	22319	22298	22298	she	908	‘ Such visitors have never come to this poor dwelling . Do you stay here . You ’re

22339	22356	22327	22327	I	0	’ said the locksmith , unwillingly relinquishing the candle he had caught up from the table . ‘
22374	22378	22327	22327	I	0	’ she rejoined . ‘
22392	22481	22390	22390	you	908	’ Gabriel looked at her , in great surprise to see one who was usually so mild and quiet thus agitated , and with so little cause . She left the room and closed the door behind her . She stood for a moment as if hesitating , with her hand upon the lock . In this short interval the knocking came again , and a voice close to the window -- a voice the locksmith seemed to recollect , and to have some disagreeable association with -- whispered ‘
22485	22503	22390	22390	you	908	’ The words were uttered in that low distinct voice which finds its way so readily to sleepers ’
22609	22613	22662	22662	she	912	‘ My God ! ’
22763	22772	22773	22773	she	7604	‘ The other way -- the other way , ’
22776	22787	22773	22773	she	7604	‘ He went the other way . Turn -- turn ! ’
22788	22798	22800	22801	the locksmith	7447	‘ The other way ! I see him now , ’
22826	22827	22800	22801	the locksmith	7447	’ ‘
22834	22842	22846	22846	him	7447	’ exclaimed the woman , clasping him ; ‘

22876	22881	22851	22851	I	0	’ cried the locksmith . ‘
22917	23081	23082	23082	You	918	’ The old man looked at her in wonder , as she writhed and clung about him ; and , borne down by her passion , suffered her to drag him into the house . It was not until she had chained and double - locked the door , fastened every bolt and bar with the heat and fury of a maniac , and drawn him back into the room , that she turned upon him , once again , that stony look of horror , and , sinking down into a chair , covered her face , and shuddered , as though the hand of death were on her . Chapter 6 Beyond all measure astonished by the strange occurrences which had passed with so much violence and rapidity , the locksmith gazed upon the shuddering figure in the chair like one half stupefied , and would have gazed much longer , had not his tongue been loosened by compassion and humanity . ‘
23086	23090	23082	23082	You	918	’ said Gabriel . ‘
23098	23099	23094	23095	some neighbour	919	’ ‘
23105	23123	23094	23095	some neighbour	919	’ she rejoined , motioning to him with her trembling hand , and holding her face averted . ‘

23148	23152	23128	23128	you	0	’ said Gabriel . ‘
23157	23161	23163	23163	you	918	’ she returned . ‘
23175	23176	23171	23171	I	0	’ ‘
23179	23188	23177	23177	Neighbour	885	’ said the locksmith , after a pause . ‘
23237	23238	23221	23221	you	918	’ ‘
23245	23249	23239	23239	I	0	’ she replied . ‘

23301	23306	23292	23292	I	0	’ returned the locksmith . ‘
23323	23344	23345	23345	I	0	’ She was silent , but held to the chair as though to save herself from falling on the ground . ‘
23356	23361	23350	23352	an old acquaintance	925	’ said the locksmith , ‘
23460	23461	23458	23458	he	591	’ ‘
23472	23479	23462	23462	You	188	’ returned the widow , faintly . ‘
23512	23513	23505	23505	he	591	’ ‘
23524	23532	23515	23515	he	591	’ returned the locksmith with some irritation , ‘
23549	23550	23515	23515	he	591	’ ‘
23555	23564	23515	23515	he	591	’ she answered , rising as she spoke , ‘
23582	23583	23574	23574	I	0	’ ‘
23587	23593	23574	23574	I	0	’ repeated the wondering locksmith . ‘
23599	23603	23574	23574	I	0	’ she replied . ‘
23625	23653	23574	23574	I	0	’ Gabriel , who had stepped forward to render her assistance , fell back as she made this hasty exclamation , and regarded her in silent wonder . ‘
23661	23669	23574	23574	I	0	’ she said in a low voice , ‘
23684	23703	23675	23677	no honest man	930	’ When she had tottered to the door , she turned , and added with a stronger effort , ‘
23792	23998	23784	23784	I	0	’ Casting her eyes upon him for an instant , she withdrew , and left him there alone . Gabriel , not knowing what to think , stood staring at the door with a countenance full of surprise and dismay . The more he pondered on what had passed , the less able he was to give it any favourable interpretation . To find this widow woman , whose life for so many years had been supposed to be one of solitude and retirement , and who , in her quiet suffering character , had gained the good opinion and respect of all who knew her -- to find her linked mysteriously with an ill - omened man , alarmed at his appearance , and yet favouring his escape , was a discovery that pained as much as startled him . Her reliance on his secrecy , and his tacit acquiescence , increased his distress of mind . If he had spoken boldly , persisted in questioning her , detained her when she rose to leave the room , made any kind of protest , instead of silently compromising himself , as he felt he had done , he would have been more at ease . ‘
24017	24042	24011	24011	she	934	’ said Gabriel , putting his wig on one side to scratch his head with greater ease , and looking ruefully at the fire . ‘
24128	24165	24117	24117	women	648	’ He took his wig off outright as he made this reflection , and , warming his handkerchief at the fire began to rub and polish his bald head with it , until it glistened again . ‘
24169	24185	24117	24117	women	648	’ said the locksmith , softening under this soothing process , and stopping to smile , ‘
24317	24318	24335	24335	Barnaby	220	’ ‘
24321	24330	24335	24335	Barnaby	220	’ he cried , looking in and nodding . ‘
24342	24343	24335	24335	Barnaby	220	’ ‘
24348	24353	24335	24335	Barnaby	220	’ said the locksmith . ‘
24356	24365	24335	24335	Barnaby	220	’ cried Barnaby , glancing over his shoulder , ‘
24494	24495	24491	24491	he	220	’ ‘
24498	24502	24491	24491	he	220	’ asked Gabriel . ‘
24522	24523	24519	24519	you	0	’ ‘
24526	24527	24530	24530	He	220	’ ‘
24544	24553	24568	24569	the locksmith	7447	’re a wise man ; tell me that . ’
24554	24566	24568	24569	the locksmith	7447	‘ Beside him , Barnaby ; beside him , I suppose , ’
24571	24574	24575	24575	he	7447	‘ No ! ’
24582	24586	24579	24579	his	7447	‘ Guess again . ’
24587	24595	24568	24569	the locksmith	7447	‘ Gone out a walking , maybe ? ’
24596	24605	24606	24607	the idiot	7505	‘ He has changed shadows with a woman , ’
24623	24644	24606	24607	the idiot	7505	‘ Her shadow ’s always with him , and his with her . That ’s sport I think , eh ? ’
24645	24648	24650	24651	the locksmith	7447	‘ Barnaby , ’
24658	24664	24650	24651	the locksmith	7447	‘ come hither , lad . ’
24665	24677	24678	24678	he	7447	‘ I know what you want to say . I know ! ’
24686	24689	24678	24678	he	7447	‘ But I ’m
24693	24708	24710	24710	he	7447	’m silent . I only say so much to you -- are you ready ? ’
24730	24735	24737	24738	the locksmith	7447	‘ Softly -- gently , ’
24751	24759	24742	24742	his	7447	‘ I thought you had been asleep . ’
24760	24767	24768	24768	he	7447	‘ So I HAVE been asleep , ’
24777	24838	24768	24768	he	7447	‘ There have been great faces coming and going -- close to my face , and then a mile away -- low places to creep through , whether I would or no -- high churches to fall down from -- strange creatures crowded up together neck and heels , to sit upon the bed -- that ’s sleep , eh ? ’
24839	24846	24848	24849	the locksmith	7447	‘ Dreams , Barnaby , dreams , ’
24851	24854	24855	24855	he	7447	‘ Dreams ! ’
24864	24870	24855	24855	he	7447	‘ Those are not dreams . ’
24871	24875	24877	24878	the locksmith	7447	‘ What are , ’
24880	24886	24877	24878	the locksmith	7447	‘ if they are not ? ’
24887	24891	24893	24893	Barnaby	220	‘ I dreamed , ’
24915	24980	24909	24909	he	220	‘ I dreamed just now that something -- it was in the shape of a man -- followed me -- came softly after me -- wouldn’t let me be -- but was always hiding and crouching , like a cat in dark corners , waiting till I should pass ; when it crept out and came softly after me.--Did you ever see me run ? ’
24981	24989	25082	25082	Barnaby	220	‘ Many a time , you know . ’
24990	25053	25103	25104	the locksmith	7447	‘ You never saw me run as I did in this dream . Still it came creeping on to worry me . Nearer , nearer , nearer -- I ran faster -- leaped -- sprung out of bed , and to the window -- and there , in the street below -- but he is waiting for us . Are you coming ? ’
25054	25063	25065	25065	Varden	212	‘ What in the street below , Barnaby ? ’
25214	25225	25227	25227	Gabriel	212	‘ Say no more , sir , say no more , ’
25229	25262	25263	25263	he	212	‘ I hope I would have done at least as much for any man in such a strait , and most of all for you , sir . A certain young lady , ’
25270	25297	25263	25263	he	212	‘ has done us many a kind turn , and we naturally feel -- I hope I give you no offence in saying this , sir ? ’
25320	25327	25328	25328	he	476	‘ It ’s no great matter , ’
25340	25376	25328	25328	he	476	‘ a mere uneasiness arising at least as much from being cooped up here , as from the slight wound I have , or from the loss of blood . Be seated , Mr Varden . ’
25377	25395	25397	25398	the locksmith	7447	‘ If I may make so bold , Mr Edward , as to lean upon your chair , ’
25412	25445	25397	25398	the locksmith	7447	‘ I ’ll stand here for the convenience of speaking low . Barnaby is not in his quietest humour to - night , and at such times talking never does him good . ’
25486	25494	25496	25496	Varden	214	‘ Pray , tell me , sir , ’
25504	25525	25496	25496	Varden	214	‘ exactly what happened last night . I have my reason for inquiring . You left the Maypole , alone ? ’
25526	25553	25499	25499	his	214	‘ And walked homeward alone , until I had nearly reached the place where you found me , when I heard the gallop of a horse . ’
25554	25558	25560	25561	the locksmith	7447	‘ Behind you ? ’
25563	25593	25560	25561	the locksmith	7447	‘ Indeed , yes -- behind me . It was a single rider , who soon overtook me , and checking his horse , inquired the way to London . ’
25594	25617	25619	25619	Varden	214	‘ You were on the alert , sir , knowing how many highwaymen there are , scouring the roads in all directions ? ’
25621	25725	25726	25726	he	965	‘ I was , but I had only a stick , having imprudently left my pistols in their holster - case with the landlord ’s son . I directed him as he desired . Before the words had passed my lips , he rode upon me furiously , as if bent on trampling me down beneath his horse ’s hoofs . In starting aside , I slipped and fell . You found me with this stab and an ugly bruise or two , and without my purse -- in which he found little enough for his pains . And now , Mr Varden , ’
25736	25752	25726	25726	he	965	‘ saving the extent of my gratitude to you , you know as much as I. ’
25753	25756	25758	25758	Gabriel	212	‘ Except , ’
25773	25827	25758	25758	Gabriel	212	‘ except in respect of the robber himself . What like was he , sir ? Speak low , if you please . Barnaby means no harm , but I have watched him oftener than you , and I know , little as you would think it , that he ’s listening now . ’
25911	25918	25920	25920	Edward	228	‘ The night was so dark , ’
25922	25945	25920	25920	Edward	228	‘ the attack so sudden , and he so wrapped and muffled up , that I can hardly say . It seems that-- ’
25946	25955	25957	25958	the locksmith	7447	‘ Do n’t mention his name , sir , ’
25966	25981	25957	25958	the locksmith	7447	‘ I know HE saw him . I want to know what YOU saw . ’
25982	25988	25990	25990	Edward	228	‘ All I remember is , ’
25992	26116	25990	25990	Edward	228	‘ that as he checked his horse his hat was blown off . He caught it , and replaced it on his head , which I observed was bound with a dark handkerchief . A stranger entered the Maypole while I was there , whom I had not seen -- for I had sat apart for reasons of my own -- and when I rose to leave the room and glanced round , he was in the shadow of the chimney and hidden from my sight . But , if he and the robber were two different persons , their voices were strangely and most remarkably alike ; for directly the man addressed me in the road , I recognised his speech again . ’
26117	26133	26135	26136	the locksmith	7447	‘ It is as I feared . The very man was here to - night , ’
26141	26148	26135	26136	the locksmith	7447	‘ What dark history is this ! ’
26149	26152	25990	25990	Edward	228	‘ Halloa ! ’
26161	26182	26183	26184	The speaker	7395	‘ Halloa , halloa , halloa ! Bow wow wow . What ’s the matter here ! Hal - loa ! ’
26284	26289	26291	26291	Varden	212	‘ Look at him ! ’
26307	26325	26291	26291	Varden	212	‘ Was there ever such a knowing imp as that ! Oh he ’s a dreadful fellow ! ’
26383	26410	26411	26412	a devil	979	‘ Halloa , halloa , halloa ! What ’s the matter here ! Keep up your spirits . Never say die . Bow wow wow . I ’m
26415	26420	26435	26435	he	7447	’m a devil , I ’m
26440	26457	26459	26459	Varden	212	‘ I more than half believe he speaks the truth . Upon my word I do , ’
26461	26480	26459	26459	Varden	212	‘ Do you see how he looks at me , as if he knew what I was saying ? ’
26511	26513	26514	26515	a devil	979	‘ I ’m
26518	26523	26524	26525	a devil	979	’m a devil , I ’m
26527	26560	26524	26525	a devil	979	’ and flapped his wings against his sides as if he were bursting with laughter . Barnaby clapped his hands , and fairly rolled upon the ground in an ecstasy of delight . ‘
26566	26583	26564	26564	sir	7320	’ said the locksmith , shaking his head , and looking from one to the other . ‘
26591	26592	26564	26564	sir	7320	’ ‘
26596	26627	26564	26564	sir	7320	’ said Edward , holding out his forefinger to the raven , who , in acknowledgment of the attention , made a dive at it immediately with his iron bill . ‘
26632	26633	26634	26636	A mere boy	985	’ ‘
26640	26645	26634	26636	A mere boy	985	’ replied the locksmith . ‘
26663	26664	26666	26666	him	7447	’ ‘
26668	26694	26666	26666	him	7447	’ echoed Barnaby , sitting upright upon the floor , and staring vacantly at Gabriel , as he thrust his hair back from his face . ‘
26730	26741	26723	26723	He	7447	’m the man . Is that the truth , Grip ? ’
26763	26784	26714	26714	He	7447	‘ You need n’t let these fellows into our secrets . We understand each other . It ’s all right . ’
26785	26791	26793	26793	Barnaby	220	‘ I make HIM come ? ’
26800	26888	26793	26793	Barnaby	220	‘ Him , who never goes to sleep , or so much as winks!--Why , any time of night , you may see his eyes in my dark room , shining like two sparks . And every night , and all night too , he ’s broad awake , talking to himself , thinking what he shall do to - morrow , where we shall go , and what he shall steal , and hide , and bury . I make HIM come ! Ha ha ha ! ’
27213	27218	27220	27220	Edward	228	‘ By the bye , ’
27241	27278	27223	27223	he	228	‘ what noise was that below ? I heard your voice in the midst of it , and should have inquired before , but our other conversation drove it from my memory . What was it ? ’
27319	27335	27336	27336	He	220	’ Varden at length made answer , looking steadily at the widow as he spoke . ‘
27348	27363	27336	27336	He	220	’ She breathed more freely , but stood quite motionless . As the locksmith said ‘
27367	27475	27476	27476	I	0	’ and Barnaby caught up the candle to light him down the stairs , she took it from him , and charged him -- with more haste and earnestness than so slight an occasion appeared to warrant -- not to stir . The raven followed them to satisfy himself that all was right below , and when they reached the street - door , stood on the bottom stair drawing corks out of number . With a trembling hand she unfastened the chain and bolts , and turned the key . As she had her hand upon the latch , the locksmith said in a low voice , ‘
27586	27667	27684	27684	he	228	’ For a moment she hid her face in her hands and wept ; but resisting the strong impulse which evidently moved her to reply , opened the door -- no wider than was sufficient for the passage of his body -- and motioned him away . As the locksmith stood upon the step , it was chained and locked behind him , and the raven , in furtherance of these precautions , barked like a lusty house - dog . ‘
27716	27723	27684	27684	he	228	’ said the locksmith , musing . ‘
27783	28437	27778	27778	I	0	’ Chapter 7 Mrs Varden was a lady of what is commonly called an uncertain temper -- a phrase which being interpreted signifies a temper tolerably certain to make everybody more or less uncomfortable . Thus it generally happened , that when other people were merry , Mrs Varden was dull ; and that when other people were dull , Mrs Varden was disposed to be amazingly cheerful . Indeed the worthy housewife was of such a capricious nature , that she not only attained a higher pitch of genius than Macbeth , in respect of her ability to be wise , amazed , temperate and furious , loyal and neutral in an instant , but would sometimes ring the changes backwards and forwards on all possible moods and flights in one short quarter of an hour ; performing , as it were , a kind of triple bob major on the peal of instruments in the female belfry , with a skilfulness and rapidity of execution that astonished all who heard her . It had been observed in this good lady ( who did not want for personal attractions , being plump and buxom to look at , though like her fair daughter , somewhat short in stature ) that this uncertainty of disposition strengthened and increased with her temporal prosperity ; and divers wise men and matrons , on friendly terms with the locksmith and his family , even went so far as to assert , that a tumble down some half - dozen rounds in the world ’s ladder -- such as the breaking of the bank in which her husband kept his money , or some little fall of that kind -- would be the making of her , and could hardly fail to render her one of the most agreeable companions in existence . Whether they were right or wrong in this conjecture , certain it is that minds , like bodies , will often fall into a pimpled ill - conditioned state from mere excess of comfort , and like them , are often successfully cured by remedies in themselves very nauseous and unpalatable . Mrs Varden ’s chief aider and abettor , and at the same time her principal victim and object of wrath , was her single domestic servant , one Miss Miggs ; or as she was called , in conformity with those prejudices of society which lop and top from poor hand - maidens all such genteel excrescences -- Miggs . This Miggs was a tall young lady , very much addicted to pattens in private life ; slender and shrewish , of a rather uncomfortable figure , and though not absolutely ill - looking , of a sharp and acid visage . As a general principle and abstract proposition , Miggs held the male sex to be utterly contemptible and unworthy of notice ; to be fickle , false , base , sottish , inclined to perjury , and wholly undeserving . When particularly exasperated against them ( which , scandal said , was when Sim Tappertit slighted her most ) she was accustomed to wish with great emphasis that the whole race of women could but die off , in order that the men might be brought to know the real value of the blessings by which they set so little store ; nay , her feeling for her order ran so high , that she sometimes declared , if she could only have good security for a fair , round number -- say ten thousand -- of young virgins following her example , she would , to spite mankind , hang , drown , stab , or poison herself , with a joy past all expression . It was the voice of Miggs that greeted the locksmith , when he knocked at his own house , with a shrill cry of ‘
28442	28443	28444	28444	Me	0	’ ‘
28450	28460	28462	28462	Miggs	239	’ returned Gabriel . What , already , sir ! ’
28473	28495	28496	28496	Miggs	239	‘ We were just getting on our nightcaps to sit up,--me and mistress . Oh , she has been SO bad ! ’
28544	28552	28554	28554	Miggs	239	‘ Master ’s come home , mim , ’
28563	28600	28554	28554	Miggs	239	‘ You was wrong , mim , and I was right . I thought he would n’t keep us up so late , two nights running , mim . Master ’s always considerate so far . I ’m
28611	28651	28659	28660	the locksmith	7447	’m a little’--here Miggs simpered--‘a little sleepy myself ; I ’ll own it now , mim , though I said I was n’t when you asked me . It ai n’t of no consequence , mim , of course . ’
28652	28657	28659	28660	the locksmith	7447	‘ You had better , ’
28676	28687	28659	28660	the locksmith	7447	‘ you had better get to bed at once then . ’
28688	28695	28697	28697	Miggs	239	‘ Thanking you kindly , sir , ’
28699	28743	28697	28697	Miggs	239	‘ I could n’t take my rest in peace , nor fix my thoughts upon my prayers , otherways than that I knew mistress was comfortable in her bed this night ; by rights she ought to have been there , hours ago . ’
28744	28746	28659	28660	the locksmith	7447	‘ You ’re
28751	28766	28749	28749	mistress	7750	’ said Varden , pulling off his greatcoat , and looking at her askew . ‘
28773	28782	28771	28771	sir	7320	’ cried Miggs , with a flushed face , ‘
28831	28895	28898	28898	mim	7753	’ Here Mrs Varden , who , with her countenance shrouded in a large nightcap , had been all this time intent upon the Protestant Manual , looked round , and acknowledged Miggs ’s championship by commanding her to hold her tongue . Every little bone in Miggs ’s throat and neck developed itself with a spitefulness quite alarming , as she replied , ‘
28903	28904	28898	28898	mim	7753	’ ‘
28915	28945	28946	28946	You	7753	’ said the locksmith , taking a chair near his wife ( who had resumed her book ) , and rubbing his knees hard as he made the inquiry . ‘

29111	29167	29168	29168	Miggs	239	‘ yes , you would . I do n’t doubt it , Varden . Certainly you would . That ’s as much as to tell me that you would be hovering round me like a vulture , waiting till the breath was out of my body , that you might go and marry somebody else . ’
29194	29215	29189	29189	It	241	‘ I ca n’t help it . It ’s wrung from me by the dreadful brutality of that monster master . ’
29216	29228	29230	29231	Mrs Varden	219	‘ But you ’ll break my heart one of these days , ’
29237	29271	29230	29231	Mrs Varden	219	‘ and then we shall both be happy . My only desire is to see Dolly comfortably settled , and when she is , you may settle ME as soon as you like . ’

29332	29343	29345	29346	the locksmith	7447	‘ No , my dear , I spoke to you , ’
29348	29356	29358	29360	the obdurate lady	1021	‘ Did you hear me , Miggs ? ’
29369	29386	29358	29360	the obdurate lady	1021	‘ YOU are beginning to despise me now , are you ? But this is example ! ’

29921	29930	29919	29919	Varden	219	’ returned his wife , rising with dignity . ‘

30164	30191	30151	30151	Gabriel	242	‘ I wish somebody would marry Miggs . But that ’s impossible ! I wonder whether there ’s any madman alive , who would marry Miggs ! ’
30278	30291	30293	30293	Sim	223	‘ What the devil business has he to stop up so late ! ’
30308	30350	30355	30355	he	223	‘ Here ’s half the night gone already . There ’s only one good that has ever come to me , out of this cursed old rusty mechanical trade , and that ’s this piece of ironmongery , upon my soul ! ’
30661	30754	30657	30662	the locksmith ’s vagrant ‘ prentice	7784	‘ prentice groped his way ; and stopping at a house from whose defaced and rotten front the rude effigy of a bottle swung to and fro like some gibbeted malefactor , struck thrice upon an iron grating with his foot . After listening in vain for some response to his signal , Mr Tappertit became impatient , and struck the grating thrice again . A further delay ensued , but it was not of long duration . The ground seemed to open at his feet , and a ragged head appeared . ‘
30760	30770	30757	30758	the captain	1059	’ said a voice as ragged as the head . ‘
30773	30784	30757	30758	the captain	1059	’ replied Mr Tappertit haughtily , descending as he spoke , ‘

30802	30818	30819	30819	You	223	’ returned the voice , as its owner stopped to shut and fasten the grating . ‘

30826	30830	30832	30833	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Lead on , ’

30922	30925	30932	30932	he	223	‘ Forward ! ’
30992	30998	31000	31008	a lanky figure , rising as from a nap	1064	‘ Welcome , noble captain ! ’
31036	31043	31044	31044	he	1059	‘ What news to - night ? ’
31056	31060	31062	31063	the other	483	‘ Nothing particular , ’

31096	31107	31085	31085	you	1066	’ was all the captain deigned to say in answer . ‘

31118	31123	31124	31125	The comrade	1069	’ replied the follower . ‘

31506	31567	31502	31504	the blind man	1085	‘ what does my noble captain drink -- is it brandy , rum , usquebaugh ? Is it soaked gunpowder , or blazing oil ?

31568	31571	31573	31574	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ See , ’
31577	31612	31573	31574	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ that it ’s something strong , and comes quick ; and so long as you take care of that , you may bring it from the devil ’s cellar , if you like . ’
31613	31620	31622	31624	the blind man	1085	‘ Boldly said , noble captain ! ’
31626	31630	31622	31624	the blind man	1085	‘ Spoken like the ‘

31660	31671	31673	31674	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ I ’ll tell you what , my fine feller , ’
31708	31733	31698	31698	he	223	‘ if you make that row , you ’ll find that the captain ’s very far from joking , and so I tell you . ’
31734	31743	31745	31745	Stagg	244	‘ He ’s got his eyes on me ! ’
31764	31767	31745	31745	Stagg	244	‘ I feel ‘

32040	32049	32034	32034	I	0	’ cried the host , smiting them reproachfully , ‘

32077	32080	32082	32083	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Yours ! ’
32085	32128	32133	32133	he	223	‘ No , I should think not . Do n’t talk about those precious old toothpicks in the same breath with mine ; that ’s rather too much . Here . Take the glass . Benjamin . Lead on . To business ! ’
32525	32528	32530	32532	the mighty captain	1113	‘ Prentice ! ’
32534	32539	32530	32532	the mighty captain	1113	‘ who waits without ? ’
32541	32560	32530	32532	the mighty captain	1113	‘ prentice made answer that a stranger was in attendance , who claimed admission into that secret society of ‘
32598	32602	32578	32579	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Admit him ! ’
32608	32632	32530	32532	the mighty captain	1113	‘ prentice bowed once more , and so withdrew as he had come . There soon appeared at the same door , two other ‘

32820	32823	32824	32826	The long comrade	1083	‘ Proceed . ’
32877	32878	32869	32869	Curzon	248	’ ‘
32881	32888	32869	32869	Curzon	248	’ cried the captain , starting . ‘
32898	32903	32896	32896	you	1059	’ said the novice . ‘
32910	32915	32904	32905	Write Curzon	248	’ said the captain . ‘
32926	32927	32924	32924	Curzon	248	’ ‘
32932	32937	32930	32930	you	1059	’ said the novice , ‘
32947	32987	32944	32944	he	248	‘ prentice idle dog , and stops his beer unless he works to his liking . He gives Dutch cheese , too , eating Cheshire , sir , himself ; and Sundays out , are only once a month . ’
32988	32991	32993	32994	Mr Tappert	250	‘ This , ’
32997	33013	32993	32994	Mr Tappert	250	‘ is a flagrant case . Put two black crosses to the name of Curzon . ’
33014	33019	33021	33022	the novice	1118	‘ If the society , ’
33096	33123	33091	33091	she	7330	’ Mr Tappertit waved his grizzly truncheon as an admonition to him not to interrupt , and ordered three black crosses to the name of Curzon . ‘
33127	33134	33091	33091	she	7330	’ he said in gracious explanation , ‘
33141	33150	33091	33091	she	7330	‘ Prentice , do you love the Constitution ? ’
33167	33171	33091	33091	she	7330	‘ I do ! ’
33172	33187	33189	33190	the captain	1059	‘ The Church , the State , and everything established -- but the masters ? ’
33196	33200	33193	33194	the novice	1118	‘ I do . ’
33262	33418	33261	33263	the ‘ prentices	7555	‘ prentices had , in times gone by , had frequent holidays of right , broken people ’s heads by scores , defied their masters , nay , even achieved some glorious murders in the streets , which privileges had gradually been wrested from them , and in all which noble aspirations they were now restrained ; how the degrading checks imposed upon them were unquestionably attributable to the innovating spirit of the times , and how they united therefore to resist all change , except such change as would restore those good old English customs , by which they would stand or fall . After illustrating the wisdom of going backward , by reference to that sagacious fish , the crab , and the not unfrequent practice of the mule and donkey , he described their general objects ; which were briefly vengeance on their Tyrant Masters ( of whose grievous and insupportable oppression no ‘
33560	33735	33784	33787	the ‘ Prentice Knights	7832	‘ prentices , to damage or in any way disfigure Temple Bar , which was strictly constitutional and always to be approached with reverence . Having gone over these several heads with great eloquence and force , and having further informed the novice that this society had its origin in his own teeming brain , stimulated by a swelling sense of wrong and outrage , Mr Tappertit demanded whether he had strength of heart to take the mighty pledge required , or whether he would withdraw while retreat was yet in his power . To this the novice made rejoinder , that he would take the vow , though it should choke him ; and it was accordingly administered with many impressive circumstances , among which the lighting up of the two skulls with a candle - end inside of each , and a great many flourishes with the bone , were chiefly conspicuous ; not to mention a variety of grave exercises with the blunderbuss and sabre , and some dismal groaning by unseen ‘
33785	33877	33784	33787	the ‘ Prentice Knights	7832	‘ Prentice Knights resigned themselves to merriment . But Mr Tappertit , who had a soul above the vulgar herd , and who , on account of his greatness , could only afford to be merry now and then , threw himself on a bench with the air of a man who was faint with dignity . He looked with an indifferent eye , alike on skittles , cards , and dice , thinking only of the locksmith ’s daughter , and the base degenerate days on which he had fallen . ‘
33890	33901	33904	33905	gallant general	1147	’ said his host , taking a seat beside him . ‘
33907	33962	33904	33905	gallant general	1147	’ Mr Tappertit drained the proffered goblet to the dregs ; then thrust his hands into his pockets , and with a lowering visage walked among the skittles , while his followers ( such is the influence of superior genius ) restrained the ardent ball , and held his little shins in dumb respect . ‘
33984	33989	33991	33992	Mr Tappertit	223	’re the same thing , ’
34001	34076	33991	33992	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ I should have been all right . But to drag out a ignoble existence unbeknown to mankind in general -- patience ! I will be famous yet . A voice within me keeps on whispering Greatness . I shall burst out one of these days , and when I do , what power can keep me down ? I feel my soul getting into my head at the idea . More drink there ! ’
34077	34081	34083	34084	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ The novice , ’
34116	34117	34114	34114	he	1153	’ ‘
34123	34127	34128	34128	One	503	’ cried Stagg . ‘
34139	34140	34128	34128	One	503	’ ‘
34144	34174	34142	34142	you	1157	’ said Mr Tappertit , letting his gaze fall on the party indicated , who was indeed the new knight , by this time restored to his own apparel ; ‘
34188	34209	34176	34176	you	1157	’ The long comrade anticipated the reply , by producing it from the shelf on which it had been deposited . ‘
34212	34274	34278	34278	he	1158	’ said Mr Tappertit , scrutinising it attentively , while a breathless silence reigned around ; for he had constructed secret door - keys for the whole society , and perhaps owed something of his influence to that mean and trivial circumstance -- on such slight accidents do even men of mind depend!--‘This is easily made . Come hither , friend . ’
34302	34306	34307	34307	he	1158	‘ And so , ’
34330	34331	34307	34307	he	1158	’ ‘
34335	34338	34307	34307	he	1158	’ said the ‘
34341	34351	34307	34307	he	1158	‘ Honour bright . No chaff , you know . ’
34352	34356	34358	34359	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Have you , ’
34394	34402	34412	34414	the ‘ prentice	7550	‘ have you a -- a rival ? ’
34403	34410	34412	34414	the ‘ prentice	7550	‘ Not as I know on , ’
34413	34416	34412	34414	the ‘ prentice	7550	‘ prentice . ‘
34421	34429	34430	34432	The ‘ prentice	7550	’ said Mr Tappertit--‘what would you -- eh?-- ’
34431	34440	34412	34414	the ‘ prentice	7550	‘ prentice looked fierce and clenched his fists . ‘
34445	34451	34412	34414	the ‘ prentice	7550	’ cried Mr Tappertit hastily , ‘
34465	34518	34519	34520	Prentice Knights	246	’ So saying , he cast him off again ; and calling the long comrade aside after taking a few hasty turns by himself , bade him immediately write and post against the wall , a notice , proscribing one Joseph Willet ( commonly known as Joe ) of Chigwell ; forbidding all ‘
34746	34783	34745	34748	the ‘ Prentice Knights	7832	‘ Prentice Knights arose in haste , and marshalling into a line , filed off one by one and dispersed with all speed to their several homes , leaving their leader to pass the grating last . ‘
34790	34805	34745	34748	the ‘ Prentice Knights	7832	’ whispered the blind man as he held it open for his passage out ; ‘
34839	35213	34824	34837	a -- conceited , bragging , empty - headed , duck - legged idiot	1176	’ With which parting words , coolly added as he listened to his receding footsteps and locked the grate upon himself , he descended the steps , and lighting the fire below the little copper , prepared , without any assistance , for his daily occupation ; which was to retail at the area - head above pennyworths of broth and soup , and savoury puddings , compounded of such scraps as were to be bought in the heap for the least money at Fleet Market in the evening time ; and for the sale of which he had need to have depended chiefly on his private connection , for the court had no thoroughfare , and was not that kind of place in which many people were likely to take the air , or to frequent as an agreeable promenade . Chapter 9 Chronicler ’s are privileged to enter where they list , to come and go through keyholes , to ride upon the wind , to overcome , in their soarings up and down , all obstacles of distance , time , and place . Thrice blessed be this last consideration , since it enables us to follow the disdainful Miggs even into the sanctity of her chamber , and to hold her in sweet companionship through the dreary watches of the night ! Miss Miggs , having undone her mistress , as she phrased it ( which means , assisted to undress her ) , and having seen her comfortably to bed in the back room on the first floor , withdrew to her own apartment , in the attic story . Notwithstanding her declaration in the locksmith ’s presence , she was in no mood for sleep ; so , putting her light upon the table and withdrawing the little window curtain , she gazed out pensively at the wild night sky . Perhaps she wondered what star was destined for her habitation when she had run her little course below ; perhaps speculated which of those glimmering spheres might be the natal orb of Mr Tappertit ; perhaps marvelled how they could gaze down on that perfidious creature , man , and not sicken and turn green as chemists ’
35243	35373	35229	35229	she	1177	‘ prentice , was attracted by a noise in the next room to her own -- his room ; the room in which he slept , and dreamed -- it might be , sometimes dreamed of her . That he was not dreaming now , unless he was taking a walk in his sleep , was clear , for every now and then there came a shuffling noise , as though he were engaged in polishing the whitewashed wall ; then a gentle creaking of his door ; then the faintest indication of his stealthy footsteps on the landing - place outside . Noting this latter circumstance , Miss Miggs turned pale and shuddered , as mistrusting his intentions ; and more than once exclaimed , below her breath , ‘
35495	35498	35543	35543	she	1177	‘ Thieves ! ’
35500	35503	35543	35543	she	1177	‘ Murder ! ’
35632	35637	35639	35640	the damsel	1181	‘ Here ’s mysteries ! ’
35657	35666	35643	35643	she	1177	‘ Oh , gracious , here ’s mysteries ! ’
35732	35827	35731	35733	the ‘ prentice	7550	‘ prentice ; again he looked cautiously in at the parlour - door , but this time instead of retreating , he passed in and disappeared . Miggs was back in her room , and had her head out of the window , before an elderly gentleman could have winked and recovered from it . Out he came at the street - door , shut it carefully behind him , tried it with his knee , and swaggered off , putting something in his pocket as he went along . At this spectacle Miggs cried ‘
35830	35835	35731	35733	the ‘ prentice	7550	’ again , and then ‘
35839	35842	35731	35733	the ‘ prentice	7550	’ and then ‘
35847	35884	35731	35733	the ‘ prentice	7550	’ and then , candle in hand , went downstairs as he had done . Coming to the workshop , she saw the lamp burning on the forge , and everything as Sim had left it . ‘
35924	35928	35930	35932	the little villain	1186	’ cried Miggs . ‘
35934	35967	35930	35932	the little villain	1186	’ This conclusion was not arrived at without consideration , and much peeping and peering about ; nor was it unassisted by the recollection that she had on several occasions come upon the ‘
36186	36189	36191	36191	Miggs	239	‘ There ! ’
36197	36251	36191	36191	Miggs	239	‘ now let ’s see whether you wo n’t be glad to take some notice of me , mister . He , he , he ! You ’ll have eyes for somebody besides Miss Dolly now , I think . A fat - faced puss she is , as ever I come across ! ’
36310	36313	36301	36301	himself	223	‘ scraggy . ’
36314	36324	36326	36326	Miggs	239	‘ I do n’t go to bed this night ! ’
36357	36370	36372	36372	Miggs	239	‘ till you come home , my lad . I would n’t , ’
36375	36387	36372	36372	Miggs	239	‘ no , not for five - and - forty pound ! ’
36717	36720	36714	36715	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Hush ! ’
36738	36744	36746	36746	Miggs	239	‘ Tell me one thing , ’
36748	36753	36746	36746	Miggs	239	‘ Is it thieves ? ’
36754	36761	36763	36764	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ No -- no -- no ! ’
36766	36769	36771	36771	Miggs	239	‘ Then , ’
36778	36852	36771	36771	Miggs	239	‘ it ’s fire . Where is it , sir ? It ’s near this room , I know . I ’ve a good conscience , sir , and would much rather die than go down a ladder . All I wish is , respecting my love to my married sister , Golden Lion Court , number twenty - sivin , second bell - handle on the right - hand door - post . ’
36853	36856	36858	36859	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Miggs ! ’
36861	36874	36858	36859	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ do n’t you know me ? Sim , you know -- Sim-- ’
36875	36882	36884	36884	Miggs	239	‘ Oh ! what about him ! ’
36890	36912	36884	36884	Miggs	239	‘ Is he in any danger ? Is he in the midst of flames and blazes ! Oh gracious , gracious ! ’
36913	36916	36936	36936	you	239	‘ Why I ’m
36922	36933	36936	36936	you	239	’ rejoined Mr Tappertit , knocking himself on the breast . ‘
36948	36949	36946	36946	Miggs	239	’ ‘
36952	36961	36946	36946	Miggs	239	’ cried Miggs , unmindful of this compliment . ‘
36982	36983	36979	36979	mim	7753	’ ‘
36988	37023	36979	36979	mim	7753	’ cried Mr Tappertit , standing on tiptoe , as if by that means he , in the street , were any nearer being able to stop the mouth of Miggs in the garret . ‘
37058	37059	37060	37060	I	0	’ ‘
37067	37081	37082	37082	I	0	’ cried Miggs -- for that was her pronunciation of his Christian name . ‘
37123	37141	37143	37143	Miggs	239	’ And there she stopped and shivered , for her modesty caught cold at the very thought . ‘
37145	37162	37143	37143	Miggs	239	’ cried Mr Tappertit , getting under the lamp , that she might see his eyes . ‘
37166	37171	37165	37165	Miggs--	255	’ Miggs screamed slightly . ‘
37185	37210	37173	37173	I	0	’ and it is impossible to describe the use he made of his eyes when he said this--‘do -- for my sake , do . ’
37211	37215	37217	37217	Miggs	239	‘ Oh Simmun , ’
37219	37238	37217	37217	Miggs	239	‘ this is worse than all . I know if I come down , you ’ll go , and-- ’
37239	37246	37248	37249	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ And what , my precious ? ’
37251	37255	37257	37257	Miggs	239	‘ And try , ’
37261	37276	37257	37257	Miggs	239	‘ to kiss me , or some such dreadfulness ; I know you will ! ’
37277	37284	37286	37287	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ I swear I wo n’t , ’
37293	37337	37286	37287	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Upon my soul I wo n’t . It ’s getting broad day , and the watchman ’s waking up . Angelic Miggs ! If you ’ll only come and let me in , I promise you faithfully and truly I wo n’t . ’
37396	37405	37378	37378	her	239	‘ prentice in , she faintly articulated the words ‘
37410	37423	37424	37424	I	0	’ and yielding to her woman ’s nature , immediately became insensible . ‘
37431	37441	37426	37426	I	0	’ said Sim , rather embarrassed by this circumstance . ‘
37512	37626	37510	37510	you	239	’ As Miggs , however , was deaf to all entreaties , Mr Tappertit leant her against the wall as one might dispose of a walking - stick or umbrella , until he had secured the window , when he took her in his arms again , and , in short stages and with great difficulty -- arising from her being tall and his being short , and perhaps in some degree from that peculiar physical conformation on which he had already remarked -- carried her upstairs , and planting her , in the same umbrella and walking - stick fashion , just inside her own door , left her to her repose . ‘
37636	37650	37627	37627	He	1207	’ said Miss Miggs , recovering as soon as she was left alone ; ‘
37653	37673	37652	37652	I	0	’m in his confidence and he ca n’t help himself , nor could n’t if he was twenty Simmunses ! ’
38457	38463	38465	38466	the gentleman	1227	‘ A quaint place this , ’
38478	38484	38469	38469	his	1227	‘ Are you the landlord ? ’
38485	38492	38494	38495	John Willet	193	‘ At your service , sir , ’
38497	38546	38548	38549	the stranger	7287	‘ You can give my horse good stabling , can you , and me an early dinner ( I am not particular what , so that it be cleanly served ) , and a decent room of which there seems to be no lack in this great mansion , ’
38559	38566	38568	38568	John	193	‘ You can have , sir , ’
38575	38580	38568	38568	John	193	‘ anything you please . ’
38581	38590	38592	38593	the other	483	‘ It ’s well I am easily satisfied , ’
38598	38610	38592	38593	the other	483	‘ or that might prove a hardy pledge , my friend . ’
38632	38638	38640	38640	John	193	‘ Halloa there ! Hugh ! ’
38642	38687	38640	38640	John	193	‘ I ask your pardon , sir , for keeping you standing in the porch ; but my son has gone to town on business , and the boy being , as I may say , of a kind of use to me , I ’m
38756	38757	38759	38759	he	1240	’ ‘
38762	38767	38759	38759	he	1240	’ returned the other . ‘
38785	38786	38776	38776	he	1240	’ ‘
38799	38805	38793	38793	he	1240	’ said the distracted host , ‘
38828	38916	38808	38808	you	0	’ The guest made no remark upon this novel cure for drowsiness , and recipe for making people lively , but , with his hands clasped behind him , stood in the porch , very much amused to see old John , with the bridle in his hand , wavering between a strong impulse to abandon the animal to his fate , and a half disposition to lead him into the house , and shut him up in the parlour , while he waited on his master . ‘
38927	38941	38918	38919	the fellow	879	’ cried John , in the very height and zenith of his distress . ‘
38951	38991	38945	38945	me	0	’ The figure he addressed made no answer , but putting his hand upon the saddle , sprung into it at a bound , turned the horse ’s head towards the stable , and was gone in an instant . ‘
38999	39004	38945	38945	me	0	’ said the guest . ‘
39010	39037	39038	39038	He	879	’ replied John , looking at the place where the horse had been , as if not yet understanding quite , what had become of him . ‘
39075	39631	39071	39071	he	879	’ Having , in the absence of any more words , put this sudden climax to what he had faintly intended should be a long explanation of the whole life and character of his man , the oracular John Willet led the gentleman up his wide dismantled staircase into the Maypole ’s best apartment . It was spacious enough in all conscience , occupying the whole depth of the house , and having at either end a great bay window , as large as many modern rooms ; in which some few panes of stained glass , emblazoned with fragments of armorial bearings , though cracked , and patched , and shattered , yet remained ; attesting , by their presence , that the former owner had made the very light subservient to his state , and pressed the sun itself into his list of flatterers ; bidding it , when it shone into his chamber , reflect the badges of his ancient family , and take new hues and colours from their pride . But those were old days , and now every little ray came and went as it would ; telling the plain , bare , searching truth . Although the best room of the inn , it had the melancholy aspect of grandeur in decay , and was much too vast for comfort . Rich rustling hangings , waving on the walls ; and , better far , the rustling of youth and beauty ’s dress ; the light of women ’s eyes , outshining the tapers and their own rich jewels ; the sound of gentle tongues , and music , and the tread of maiden feet , had once been there , and filled it with delight . But they were gone , and with them all its gladness . It was no longer a home ; children were never born and bred there ; the fireside had become mercenary -- a something to be bought and sold -- a very courtezan : let who would die , or sit beside , or leave it , it was still the same -- it missed nobody , cared for nobody , had equal warmth and smiles for all . God help the man whose heart ever changes with the world , as an old mansion when it becomes an inn ! No effort had been made to furnish this chilly waste , but before the broad chimney a colony of chairs and tables had been planted on a square of carpet , flanked by a ghostly screen , enriched with figures , grinning and grotesque . After lighting with his own hands the faggots which were heaped upon the hearth , old John withdrew to hold grave council with his cook , touching the stranger ’s entertainment ; while the guest himself , seeing small comfort in the yet unkindled wood , opened a lattice in the distant window , and basked in a sickly gleam of cold March sun . Leaving the window now and then , to rake the crackling logs together , or pace the echoing room from end to end , he closed it when the fire was quite burnt up , and having wheeled the easiest chair into the warmest corner , summoned John Willet . ‘
39634	39681	39071	39071	he	879	’ said John . He wanted pen , ink , and paper . There was an old standish on the mantelshelf containing a dusty apology for all three . Having set this before him , the landlord was retiring , when he motioned him to stay . ‘
39691	39703	39776	39777	the guest	599	’ said the guest when he had written a few lines , ‘
39713	39771	39772	39772	I	0	’ As this was said in the tone of one who knew the fact , and asked the question as a thing of course , John contented himself with nodding his head in the affirmative ; at the same time taking one hand out of his pockets to cough behind , and then putting it in again . ‘
39790	39812	39776	39777	the guest	599	‘ conveyed there without loss of time , and an answer brought back here . Have you a messenger at hand ? ’
39827	39833	39835	39836	the guest	599	‘ Let me see him , ’
39897	39903	39905	39905	John	193	‘ Why the truth is , ’
39911	39964	39905	39905	John	193	‘ that the person who ’d go quickest , is a sort of natural , as one may say , sir ; and though quick of foot , and as much to be trusted as the post itself , he ’s not good at talking , being touched and flighty , sir . ’
39965	39970	39972	39973	the guest	599	‘ You do n’t , ’
39984	40003	39972	39973	the guest	599	‘ you do n’t mean -- what ’s the fellow ’s name -- you do n’t mean Barnaby ? ’
40004	40010	40012	40013	the landlord	439	‘ Yes , I do , ’
40023	40031	40033	40034	the guest	599	‘ How comes he to be here ? ’
40072	40081	40069	40069	his	599	‘ I saw him in London last night . ’
40082	40098	40100	40101	old John	193	‘ He ’s , for ever , here one hour , and there the next , ’
40115	40173	40100	40101	old John	193	‘ Sometimes he walks , and sometimes runs . He ’s known along the road by everybody , and sometimes comes here in a cart or chaise , and sometimes riding double . He comes and goes , through wind , rain , snow , and hail , and on the darkest nights . Nothing hurts HIM . ’
40174	40186	40188	40189	the guest	599	‘ He goes often to the Warren , does he not ? ’
40192	40218	40188	40189	the guest	599	‘ I seem to remember his mother telling me something to that effect yesterday . But I was not attending to the good woman much . ’
40219	40221	40100	40101	old John	193	‘ You ’re
40226	40231	40232	40232	he	1257	’ John made answer , ‘
40246	40247	40238	40238	sir	7320	’ ‘
40253	40271	40238	40238	sir	7320	’ returned the guest , taking a gold toothpick from his pocket with the same sweet smile . ‘
40280	40281	40238	40238	sir	7320	’ ‘
40284	40318	40238	40238	sir	7320	’ said John with a puzzled look , as if it occurred to him , dimly and afar off , that this might by possibility be a cool way of treating the subject . ‘
40326	40332	40238	40238	sir	7320	’ said the guest soliloquising , ‘
40389	40405	40406	40406	he	0	‘ Twould be enough to wear one ’s life out.--You were going to say , friend-- ’
40414	40445	40447	40447	John	193	‘ Only that Mrs Rudge lives on a little pension from the family , and that Barnaby ’s as free of the house as any cat or dog about it , ’
40449	40458	40406	40406	he	0	‘ Shall he do your errand , sir ? ’
40459	40463	40465	40466	the guest	599	‘ Oh yes , ’
40468	40518	40519	40519	John	193	‘ Oh certainly . Let him do it by all means . Please to bring him here that I may charge him to be quick . If he objects to come you may tell him it ’s Mr Chester . He will remember my name , I dare say . ’
40636	40642	40644	40645	Mr Chester	228	‘ Come hither , lad , ’
40647	40654	40644	40645	Mr Chester	228	‘ You know Mr Geoffrey Haredale ? ’
40669	40674	40665	40665	he	439	‘ You hear him ? ’
40702	40709	40711	40711	John	193	‘ He knows him , sir , ’
40718	40727	40711	40711	John	193	‘ as well as you or I do . ’
40728	40741	40743	40744	his guest	7304	‘ I have n’t the pleasure of much acquaintance with the gentleman , ’
40746	40760	40743	40744	his guest	7304	‘ YOU may have . Limit the comparison to yourself , my friend . ’
40803	40807	40809	40810	the guest	599	‘ Give that , ’
40832	40876	40809	40810	the guest	599	‘ into Mr Haredale ’s own hands . Wait for an answer , and bring it back to me here . If you should find that Mr Haredale is engaged just now , tell him -- can he remember a message , landlord ? ’
40877	40884	40886	40886	John	193	‘ When he chooses , sir , ’
40888	40896	40886	40886	John	193	‘ He wo n’t forget this one . ’
40897	40905	40906	40906	John	193	‘ How are you sure of that ? ’
40936	40948	40950	40951	Mr Chester	228	‘ Tell him then , Barnaby , should he be engaged , ’
40953	40994	40950	40951	Mr Chester	228	‘ that I shall be glad to wait his convenience here , and to see him ( if he will call ) at any time this evening.--At the worst I can have a bed here , Willet , I suppose ? ’
41021	41030	40995	40996	Old John	258	‘ I should believe you could , sir , ’
41081	41084	41086	41086	Barnaby	220	‘ Speed ! ’
41096	41113	41086	41086	Barnaby	220	‘ Speed ! If you want to see hurry and mystery , come here . Here ! ’
41147	41152	41153	41153	he	220	‘ Look down there , ’
41157	41227	41153	41153	he	220	‘ do you mark how they whisper in each other ’s ears ; then dance and leap , to make believe they are in sport ? Do you see how they stop for a moment , when they think there is no one looking , and mutter among themselves again ; and then how they roll and gambol , delighted with the mischief they ’ve been plotting ? Look at ‘
41282	41283	41279	41279	you	0	’ ‘
41289	41294	41240	41240	they	1277	’ returned the guest , ‘
41313	41314	41267	41267	I	0	’ ‘
41317	41332	41267	41267	I	0	’ echoed Barnaby , looking close into his face , and falling quickly back . ‘
41420	41426	41427	41429	the bright ones	1283	’re the dull men . We ’re
41448	41464	41446	41446	I	0	’ With that , he waved his hat above his head , and darted off . ‘
41473	41491	41465	41467	A strange creature	1284	’ said the guest , pulling out a handsome box , and taking a pinch of snuff . ‘
41496	41510	41514	41514	he	1284	’ said Mr Willet , very slowly , and after a long silence ; ‘
41548	41861	41862	41862	Barnaby	220	’ To record that Mr Chester smiled at John ’s remark would be little to the purpose , for he preserved the same conciliatory and pleasant look at all times . He drew his chair nearer to the fire though , as a kind of hint that he would prefer to be alone , and John , having no reasonable excuse for remaining , left him to himself . Very thoughtful old John Willet was , while the dinner was preparing ; and if his brain were ever less clear at one time than another , it is but reasonable to suppose that he addled it in no slight degree by shaking his head so much that day . That Mr Chester , between whom and Mr Haredale , it was notorious to all the neighbourhood , a deep and bitter animosity existed , should come down there for the sole purpose , as it seemed , of seeing him , and should choose the Maypole for their place of meeting , and should send to him express , were stumbling blocks John could not overcome . The only resource he had , was to consult the boiler , and wait impatiently for Barnaby ’s return . But Barnaby delayed beyond all precedent . The visitor ’s dinner was served , removed , his wine was set , the fire replenished , the hearth clean swept ; the light waned without , it grew dusk , became quite dark , and still no Barnaby appeared . Yet , though John Willet was full of wonder and misgiving , his guest sat cross - legged in the easy - chair , to all appearance as little ruffled in his thoughts as in his dress -- the same calm , easy , cool gentleman , without a care or thought beyond his golden toothpick . ‘
41866	41897	41862	41862	Barnaby	220	’ John ventured to observe , as he placed a pair of tarnished candlesticks , some three feet high , upon the table , and snuffed the lights they held . ‘
41903	41912	41898	41898	He	220	’ replied the guest , sipping his wine . ‘
41924	41933	41920	41920	I	0	’ John coughed and raked the fire together . ‘
41955	41960	41963	41963	I	0	’ said Mr Chester , ‘
42024	42025	42015	42015	you	1285	’ ‘
42032	42037	42030	42030	sir	7320	’ returned John Willet ; ‘
42096	42097	42075	42075	Your	1285	’ ‘
42105	42122	42075	42075	Your	1285	’ said the guest , shrugging his shoulders and wheeling his chair nearer to the fire . ‘
42152	42197	42198	42198	He	1297	’ John raked the faggots up again , more from habit than presence of mind , or any reference to this remark , and was about to withdraw , when a bounding step was heard upon the stair , and Barnaby came panting in . ‘
42212	42218	42198	42198	He	1297	’ he cried , advancing . ‘
42254	42255	42258	42258	his	1297	’ ‘
42261	42284	42258	42258	his	1297	’ asked the visitor , looking up , but without the smallest discomposure -- or at least without the show of any . ‘
42291	42295	42296	42296	He	1297	’ Barnaby rejoined . ‘

John Willet , who appeared to consider himself particularly and chiefly referred to under the term wise men , looked that way likewise , and with great solidity of feature . ‘
42495	42499	42488	42488	they	1305	’ asked Barnaby ; ‘

43440	43448	43438	43438	Solomon	205	‘ to take Mr Haredale ’s horse . ’

44082	44106	44080	44080	Willet	194	’ said Solomon Daisy , who had exhibited some impatience at the intrusion of so unworthy a subject on their more interesting theme , ‘

44128	44132	44123	44123	He	228	’ said John , ‘

44181	44220	44168	44168	He	228	’ Everybody looked at Mr Willet , after this alarming suggestion . Mr Willet looked at the fire , weighing in his own mind the effect which such an occurrence would be likely to have on the establishment . ‘
44223	44227	44168	44168	He	228	’ said John , ‘
44257	44258	44246	44246	he	228	’ ‘
44264	44268	44246	44246	he	228	’ returned Solomon , ‘
44326	44338	44324	44327	One of ‘ em	8023	‘ em will be wounded or perhaps killed in this house . ’
44339	44351	44353	44353	John	193	‘ That was a challenge that Barnaby took then , eh ? ’
44355	44376	44378	44380	the little man	7269	‘ --Inclosing a slip of paper with the measure of his sword upon it , I ’ll bet a guinea , ’
44382	44414	44378	44380	the little man	7269	‘ We know what sort of gentleman Mr Haredale is . You have told us what Barnaby said about his looks , when he came back . Depend upon it , I ’m
44421	44467	44378	44380	the little man	7269	’ The flip had had no flavour till now . The tobacco had been of mere English growth , compared with its present taste . A duel in that great old rambling room upstairs , and the best bed ordered already for the wounded man ! ‘
44477	44481	44482	44482	Heaven	210	’ said John . ‘
44488	44492	44493	44494	The gentlemen	1351	’ returned Solomon . ‘
44534	44576	44523	44523	they	1351	’ A shade passed over Mr Willet ’s face as he thought of broken windows and disabled furniture , but bethinking himself that one of the parties would probably be left alive to pay the damage , he brightened up again . ‘
44580	44590	44523	44523	they	1351	’ said Solomon , looking from face to face , ‘
44654	44655	44647	44647	We	1353	’ ‘
44659	44665	44647	44647	We	1353	’ they whispered all together . ‘
44675	44679	44647	44647	We	1353	’ said Solomon , ‘

44716	44720	44694	44694	you	1354	’ cried John . ‘

44858	44882	44883	44885	The very man	7696	’ As this recital ended , and they all drew closer round the fire , the tramp of a horse was heard without . ‘
44887	44894	44895	44895	Hugh	198	’ cried John , starting up . ‘
44899	44969	44897	44897	Hugh	198	’ The sleeper staggered to his feet , and hurried after him . John quickly returned , ushering in with great attention and deference ( for Mr Haredale was his landlord ) the long - expected visitor , who strode into the room clanking his heavy boots upon the floor ; and looking keenly round upon the bowing group , raised his hat in acknowledgment of their profound respect . ‘
44983	44997	44976	44976	Willet	194	’ he said , in a voice which sounded naturally stern and deep . ‘
45002	45003	45000	45000	he	1364	’ ‘
45012	45016	45000	45000	he	1364	’ answered John . ‘
45034	45081	45029	45029	Gentlemen	1335	’ With that , he signed to the landlord to go on before ; and went clanking out , and up the stairs ; old John , in his agitation , ingeniously lighting everything but the way , and making a stumble at every second step . ‘
45084	45094	45098	45098	myself	0	’ he said , when they reached the landing . ‘
45104	45435	45436	45436	Haredale	206	’ He laid his hand upon the door , entered , and shut it heavily . Mr Willet was by no means disposed to stand there listening by himself , especially as the walls were very thick ; so descended , with much greater alacrity than he had come up , and joined his friends below . Chapter 12 There was a brief pause in the state - room of the Maypole , as Mr Haredale tried the lock to satisfy himself that he had shut the door securely , and , striding up the dark chamber to where the screen inclosed a little patch of light and warmth , presented himself , abruptly and in silence , before the smiling guest . If the two had no greater sympathy in their inward thoughts than in their outward bearing and appearance , the meeting did not seem likely to prove a very calm or pleasant one . With no great disparity between them in point of years , they were , in every other respect , as unlike and far removed from each other as two men could well be . The one was soft - spoken , delicately made , precise , and elegant ; the other , a burly square - built man , negligently dressed , rough and abrupt in manner , stern , and , in his present mood , forbidding both in look and speech . The one preserved a calm and placid smile ; the other , a distrustful frown . The new - comer , indeed , appeared bent on showing by his every tone and gesture his determined opposition and hostility to the man he had come to meet . The guest who received him , on the other hand , seemed to feel that the contrast between them was all in his favour , and to derive a quiet exultation from it which put him more at his ease than ever . ‘
45438	45452	45436	45436	Haredale	206	’ said this gentleman , without the least appearance of embarrassment or reserve , ‘

45475	45484	45469	45469	They	1371	’ returned the other , waving his hand , ‘

45619	45649	45617	45617	Haredale	206	’ said Mr Chester , tapping his snuff - box , and following with a smile the impatient gesture he had made -- perhaps unconsciously -- towards his sword , ‘

45667	45672	45662	45662	I	0	’ returned the other , ‘

45997	46002	46004	46005	the other	483	‘ With my friends , ’
46007	46011	46013	46014	Mr Chester	228	‘ At least , ’
46016	46022	46013	46014	Mr Chester	228	‘ you will be seated ? ’
46023	46028	46030	46031	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I will stand , ’
46034	46058	46030	46031	Mr Haredale	206	‘ on this dismantled , beggared hearth , and not pollute it , fallen as it is , with mockeries . Go on . ’
46059	46066	46068	46069	the other	483	‘ You are wrong , Haredale , ’
46091	46172	46078	46078	he	483	‘ You are really very wrong . The world is a lively place enough , in which we must accommodate ourselves to circumstances , sail with the stream as glibly as we can , be content to take froth for substance , the surface for the depth , the counterfeit for the real coin . I wonder no philosopher has ever established that our globe itself is hollow . It should be , if Nature is consistent in her works . ’
46173	46181	46030	46031	Mr Haredale	206	‘ YOU think it is , perhaps ? ’
46182	46187	46188	46188	he	483	‘ I should say , ’
46195	46398	46192	46192	his	483	‘ there could be no doubt about it . Well ; we , in trifling with this jingling toy , have had the ill - luck to jostle and fall out . We are not what the world calls friends ; but we are as good and true and loving friends for all that , as nine out of every ten of those on whom it bestows the title . You have a niece , and I a son -- a fine lad , Haredale , but foolish . They fall in love with each other , and form what this same world calls an attachment ; meaning a something fanciful and false like the rest , which , if it took its own free time , would break like any other bubble . But it may not have its own free time -- will not , if they are left alone -- and the question is , shall we two , because society calls us enemies , stand aloof , and let them rush into each other ’s arms , when , by approaching each other sensibly , as we do now , we can prevent it , and part them ? ’
46399	46405	46407	46408	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I love my niece , ’
46415	46429	46407	46408	Mr Haredale	206	‘ It may sound strangely in your ears ; but I love her . ’
46430	46437	46439	46440	Mr Chester	228	‘ Strangely , my good fellow ! ’
46454	46483	46439	46440	Mr Chester	228	‘ Not at all . I like Ned too -- or , as you say , love him -- that ’s the word among such near relations . I ’m

46824	46844	46822	46822	Haredale	261	’ returned the other , rocking himself to and fro as in assent , and nodding at the fire , ‘

47520	47530	47506	47507	an heiress	1416	’ said Mr Haredale , drawing on his glove . ‘

47614	47622	47623	47623	Chester	228	’ he added , helping himself again . ‘
47625	47649	47623	47623	Chester	228	’ said Mr Haredale , after a short silence , during which he had eyed his smiling face from time to time intently , ‘

47671	47680	47657	47659	an evil spirit	1422	’ said the other , with a nod . ‘

47747	47764	47730	47730	you	0	’ returned the other , shrugging his shoulders and stretching himself more comfortably before the fire . ‘

47900	47926	47897	47897	I	0	’ said Mr Haredale , moving to and fro , and stopping , and moving on again , like one who was ill at ease , ‘

48024	48035	48037	48037	me	0	’ said Mr Chester , rising with a graceful indolence . ‘

48063	48105	48058	48058	I	0	’ So , waving his hand slightly , and putting on his hat as he turned upon his heel , he went clanking out as he had come , shut the door behind him , and tramped down the echoing stairs . ‘
48115	48129	48130	48132	A rough brute	1429	’ said Mr Chester , composing himself in the easy - chair again . ‘
48139	48531	48134	48137	Quite a human badger	1430	’ John Willet and his friends , who had been listening intently for the clash of swords , or firing of pistols in the great room , and had indeed settled the order in which they should rush in when summoned -- in which procession old John had carefully arranged that he should bring up the rear -- were very much astonished to see Mr Haredale come down without a scratch , call for his horse , and ride away thoughtfully at a footpace . After some consideration , it was decided that he had left the gentleman above , for dead , and had adopted this stratagem to divert suspicion or pursuit . As this conclusion involved the necessity of their going upstairs forthwith , they were about to ascend in the order they had agreed upon , when a smart ringing at the guest ’s bell , as if he had pulled it vigorously , overthrew all their speculations , and involved them in great uncertainty and doubt . At length Mr Willet agreed to go upstairs himself , escorted by Hugh and Barnaby , as the strongest and stoutest fellows on the premises , who were to make their appearance under pretence of clearing away the glasses . Under this protection , the brave and broad - faced John boldly entered the room , half a foot in advance , and received an order for a boot - jack without trembling . But when it was brought , and he leant his sturdy shoulder to the guest , Mr Willet was observed to look very hard into his boots as he pulled them off , and , by opening his eyes much wider than usual , to appear to express some surprise and disappointment at not finding them full of blood . He took occasion , too , to examine the gentleman as closely as he could , expecting to discover sundry loopholes in his person , pierced by his adversary ’s sword . Finding none , however , and observing in course of time that his guest was as cool and unruffled , both in his dress and temper , as he had been all day , old John at last heaved a deep sigh , and began to think no duel had been fought that night . ‘
48537	48542	48535	48535	Willet	194	’ said Mr Chester , ‘
48560	48561	48565	48565	sir	7320	’ ‘
48567	48601	48565	48565	sir	7320	’ returned John , taking up a candle , and nudging Barnaby and Hugh to accompany them , in case the gentleman should unexpectedly drop down faint or dead from some internal wound , ‘
48640	48773	48632	48632	sir	7320	’ In this order -- and still , in his earnest inspection , holding his candle very close to the guest ; now making him feel extremely warm about the legs , now threatening to set his wig on fire , and constantly begging his pardon with great awkwardness and embarrassment -- John led the party to the best bedroom , which was nearly as large as the chamber from which they had come , and held , drawn out near the fire for warmth , a great old spectral bedstead , hung with faded brocade , and ornamented , at the top of each carved post , with a plume of feathers that had once been white , but with dust and age had now grown hearse - like and funereal . ‘
48780	48816	48632	48632	sir	7320	’ said Mr Chester with a sweet smile , seating himself , when he had surveyed the room from end to end , in the easy - chair which his attendants wheeled before the fire . ‘
48839	48843	48844	48844	He	8082	’ Barnaby nodded . ‘
48856	48863	48864	48864	I	0	’ returned old John , officiously . ‘
48865	48874	48864	48864	I	0	’m afraid there an’t much good in em . ’
48875	48879	48881	48882	Mr Chester	228	‘ And Hugh ? ’
48888	48892	48893	48893	he	228	‘ Not I , ’
48896	48907	48893	48893	he	228	‘ I know his’--pointing to Barnaby--‘they’re well enough . He sings ‘
48917	48918	48914	48914	I	0	’ ‘
48927	48936	48925	48925	sir	7320	’ John whispered in his ear with dignity . ‘
48943	48985	48986	48987	The guest	599	’m sure . If he has any soul at all , sir , it must be such a very small one , that it do n’t signify what he does or does n’t in that way . Good night , sir ! ’
48989	48994	48986	48987	The guest	599	‘ God bless you ! ’
49044	49623	49036	49037	Joseph Willet	197	‘ prentices , had happened to be at home when his father ’s courtly guest presented himself before the Maypole door -- that is , if it had not perversely chanced to be one of the half - dozen days in the whole year on which he was at liberty to absent himself for as many hours without question or reproach -- he would have contrived , by hook or crook , to dive to the very bottom of Mr Chester ’s mystery , and to come at his purpose with as much certainty as though he had been his confidential adviser . In that fortunate case , the lovers would have had quick warning of the ills that threatened them , and the aid of various timely and wise suggestions to boot ; for all Joe ’s readiness of thought and action , and all his sympathies and good wishes , were enlisted in favour of the young people , and were staunch in devotion to their cause . Whether this disposition arose out of his old prepossessions in favour of the young lady , whose history had surrounded her in his mind , almost from his cradle , with circumstances of unusual interest ; or from his attachment towards the young gentleman , into whose confidence he had , through his shrewdness and alacrity , and the rendering of sundry important services as a spy and messenger , almost imperceptibly glided ; whether they had their origin in either of these sources , or in the habit natural to youth , or in the constant badgering and worrying of his venerable parent , or in any hidden little love affair of his own which gave him something of a fellow - feeling in the matter , it is needless to inquire -- especially as Joe was out of the way , and had no opportunity on that particular occasion of testifying to his sentiments either on one side or the other . It was , in fact , the twenty - fifth of March , which , as most people know to their cost , is , and has been time out of mind , one of those unpleasant epochs termed quarter - days . On this twenty - fifth of March , it was John Willet ’s pride annually to settle , in hard cash , his account with a certain vintner and distiller in the city of London ; to give into whose hands a canvas bag containing its exact amount , and not a penny more or less , was the end and object of a journey for Joe , so surely as the year and day came round . This journey was performed upon an old grey mare , concerning whom John had an indistinct set of ideas hovering about him , to the effect that she could win a plate or cup if she tried . She never had tried , and probably never would now , being some fourteen or fifteen years of age , short in wind , long in body , and rather the worse for wear in respect of her mane and tail . Notwithstanding these slight defects , John perfectly gloried in the animal ; and when she was brought round to the door by Hugh , actually retired into the bar , and there , in a secret grove of lemons , laughed with pride . ‘
49633	49652	49631	49631	Hugh	198	’ said John , when he had recovered enough self - command to appear at the door again . ‘
49668	49727	49036	49037	Joseph Willet	197	’ There was bone enough beyond all doubt ; and so Hugh seemed to think , as he sat sideways in the saddle , lazily doubled up with his chin nearly touching his knees ; and heedless of the dangling stirrups and loose bridle - rein , sauntered up and down on the little green before the door . ‘
49738	49762	49729	49729	you	1444	’ said John , appealing from this insensible person to his son and heir , who now appeared , fully equipped and ready . ‘
49769	49770	49771	49771	I	0	’ ‘
49784	49796	49779	49779	I	0	’ Joe replied , casting a disconsolate look at the animal . ‘
49808	49813	49805	49805	you	1444	’ retorted old John . ‘
49864	49907	49859	49859	your	1444	’ When Mr Willet , in his differences with his son , had exhausted all the questions that occurred to him , and Joe had said nothing at all in answer , he generally wound up by bidding him hold his tongue . ‘
49915	49937	49911	49912	the boy	7488	’ added Mr Willet , after he had stared at him for a little time , in a species of stupefaction , ‘
49958	49959	49949	49949	you	1444	’ ‘
49962	49968	49969	49969	I	0	’ said Joe , tartly ; ‘
49970	49982	49993	49994	Mr Willet	194	’m not . Now your mind ’s at ease , father . ’
49983	49991	49993	49994	Mr Willet	194	‘ With a milintary air , too ! ’
50003	50038	49993	49994	Mr Willet	194	‘ with a swaggering , fire - eating , biling - water drinking sort of way with him ! And what do you mean by pulling up the crocuses and snowdrops , eh sir ? ’
50039	50047	50049	50049	Joe	197	‘ It ’s only a little nosegay , ’
50053	50064	50049	50049	Joe	197	‘ There ’s no harm in that , I hope ? ’
50065	50067	49993	49994	Mr Willet	194	‘ You ’re
50078	50085	50049	50049	Joe	197	’ said Mr Willet , disdainfully , ‘

50106	50110	50097	50097	I	0	’ returned Joe . ‘

50144	50148	50149	50149	I	0	’ demanded John . ‘
50165	50169	50160	50160	I	0	’ said Joe . ‘

50197	50201	50195	50195	sir	7320	’ replied John ; ‘

50236	50240	50233	50233	I	0	’ returned Joe . ‘

50264	50268	50254	50254	you	7320	’ said John . ‘

50289	50295	50279	50279	you	7315	’ retorted Joe , sorrowfully ; ‘
50329	50377	50305	50305	you	7315	’re to pay for next time you go , as if I was not to be trusted with a few shillings ? Why do you use me like this ? It ’s not right of you . You ca n’t expect me to be quiet under it . ’
50378	50384	50386	50386	John	193	‘ Let him have money ! ’
50393	50421	50386	50386	John	193	‘ What does he call money -- guineas ? Has n’t he got money ? Over and above the tolls , has n’t he one and sixpence ? ’
50422	50427	50429	50430	his son	7374	‘ One and sixpence ! ’
50433	50438	50386	50386	John	193	‘ Yes , sir , ’
50442	50558	50386	50386	John	193	‘ one and sixpence . When I was your age , I had never seen so much money , in a heap . A shilling of it is in case of accidents -- the mare casting a shoe , or the like of that . The other sixpence is to spend in the diversions of London ; and the diversion I recommend is going to the top of the Monument , and sitting there . There ’s no temptation there , sir -- no drink -- no young women -- no bad characters of any sort -- nothing but imagination . That ’s the way I enjoyed myself when I was your age , sir . ’
50856	50863	50865	50865	Joe	197	‘ Stay there , old girl , ’
50867	50884	50865	50865	Joe	197	‘ and let us see whether there ’s any little commission for me to - day . ’
50931	51438	50865	50865	Joe	197	’ walking , brought him close to the house , towards which , and especially towards one particular window , he directed many covert glances . It was a dreary , silent building , with echoing courtyards , desolated turret - chambers , and whole suites of rooms shut up and mouldering to ruin . The terrace - garden , dark with the shade of overhanging trees , had an air of melancholy that was quite oppressive . Great iron gates , disused for many years , and red with rust , drooping on their hinges and overgrown with long rank grass , seemed as though they tried to sink into the ground , and hide their fallen state among the friendly weeds . The fantastic monsters on the walls , green with age and damp , and covered here and there with moss , looked grim and desolate . There was a sombre aspect even on that part of the mansion which was inhabited and kept in good repair , that struck the beholder with a sense of sadness ; of something forlorn and failing , whence cheerfulness was banished . It would have been difficult to imagine a bright fire blazing in the dull and darkened rooms , or to picture any gaiety of heart or revelry that the frowning walls shut in . It seemed a place where such things had been , but could be no more -- the very ghost of a house , haunting the old spot in its old outward form , and that was all . Much of this decayed and sombre look was attributable , no doubt , to the death of its former master , and the temper of its present occupant ; but remembering the tale connected with the mansion , it seemed the very place for such a deed , and one that might have been its predestined theatre years upon years ago . Viewed with reference to this legend , the sheet of water where the steward ’s body had been found appeared to wear a black and sullen character , such as no other pool might own ; the bell upon the roof that had told the tale of murder to the midnight wind , became a very phantom whose voice would raise the listener ’s hair on end ; and every leafless bough that nodded to another , had its stealthy whispering of the crime . Joe paced up and down the path , sometimes stopping in affected contemplation of the building or the prospect , sometimes leaning against a tree with an assumed air of idleness and indifference , but always keeping an eye upon the window he had singled out at first . After some quarter of an hour ’s delay , a small white hand was waved to him for an instant from this casement , and the young man , with a respectful bow , departed ; saying under his breath as he crossed his horse again , ‘
51447	51770	50865	50865	Joe	197	’ But the air of smartness , the cock of the hat to which John Willet had objected , and the spring nosegay , all betokened some little errand of his own , having a more interesting object than a vintner or even a locksmith . So , indeed , it turned out ; for when he had settled with the vintner -- whose place of business was down in some deep cellars hard by Thames Street , and who was as purple - faced an old gentleman as if he had all his life supported their arched roof on his head -- when he had settled the account , and taken the receipt , and declined tasting more than three glasses of old sherry , to the unbounded astonishment of the purple - faced vintner , who , gimlet in hand , had projected an attack upon at least a score of dusty casks , and who stood transfixed , or morally gimleted as it were , to his own wall -- when he had done all this , and disposed besides of a frugal dinner at the Black Lion in Whitechapel ; spurning the Monument and John ’s advice , he turned his steps towards the locksmith ’s house , attracted by the eyes of blooming Dolly Varden . Joe was by no means a sheepish fellow , but , for all that , when he got to the corner of the street in which the locksmith lived , he could by no means make up his mind to walk straight to the house . First , he resolved to stroll up another street for five minutes , then up another street for five minutes more , and so on until he had lost full half an hour , when he made a bold plunge and found himself with a red face and a beating heart in the smoky workshop . ‘
51778	51803	50865	50865	Joe	197	’ said Varden , rising from the desk at which he was busy with his books , and looking at him under his spectacles . ‘
51829	51830	51827	51827	Joe	197	’ ‘
51846	51847	51837	51837	they	1477	’ ‘
51852	51857	51837	51837	they	1477	’ said the locksmith . ‘
51870	51914	51837	51837	they	1477	’ foibles . How ’s the mare , Joe ? Does she do the four miles an hour as easily as ever ? Ha , ha , ha ! Does she , Joe ? Eh!--What have we there , Joe -- a nosegay ! ’
51915	51927	51938	51938	his	242	‘ A very poor one , sir -- I thought Miss Dolly-- ’
51928	51933	51935	51935	Gabriel	242	‘ No , no , ’
51946	51951	51943	51943	his	242	‘ not Dolly . Give ‘
51964	51974	51938	51938	his	242	‘ em to her mother . Would you mind giving ‘
51982	51983	51980	51980	Joe	197	’ ‘
51989	52009	51980	51980	Joe	197	’ Joe replied , and endeavouring , but not with the greatest possible success , to hide his disappointment . ‘
52017	52020	52028	52029	the locksmith	7447	’m sure . ’
52021	52026	52028	52029	the locksmith	7447	‘ That ’s right , ’
52037	52044	52028	52029	the locksmith	7447	‘ It do n’t matter who has ‘
52049	52050	52047	52047	Joe	197	’ ‘
52057	52068	52055	52055	sir	7320	’--Dear heart , how the words stuck in his throat ! ‘
52072	52076	52077	52077	I	0	’ said Gabriel . ‘
52091	52092	52093	52093	She	1487	’ ‘
52095	52099	52093	52093	She	1487	’ thought Joe . ‘
52102	52111	52112	52113	The locksmith	7447	‘ em I wonder -- Mrs or Miss ? ’
52137	52149	52112	52113	The locksmith	7447	‘ Martha , my dear , here ’s young Mr Willet . ’
52258	52260	52284	52284	you	1500	‘ I ’m
52271	52277	52262	52262	I	0	’ said the good lady , ‘
52293	52338	52284	52284	you	1500	’ Joe begged she would n’t mention it on any account , and smiled feebly as he saw them deposited on the sill outside . If anybody could have known the pains he had taken to make up that despised and misused bunch of flowers!-- ‘
52355	52360	52351	52351	I	0	’ said Mrs Varden . ‘
52362	52366	52369	52369	she	1501	’m better already . ’
52404	52406	52396	52396	he	197	‘ You ’re
52415	52419	52412	52413	Mr Joseph	264	’ said Mrs V. ‘
52426	52430	52420	52420	I	0	’ returned Joe . ‘
52432	52443	52445	52446	Mrs Varden	219	’re the cruellest and most inconsiderate people in the world , ’
52450	52513	52515	52516	Mrs Varden	219	‘ I wonder old Mr Willet , having been a married man himself , does n’t know better than to conduct himself as he does . His doing it for profit is no excuse . I would rather pay the money twenty times over , and have Varden come home like a respectable and sober tradesman . If there is one character , ’
52521	52536	52515	52516	Mrs Varden	219	‘ that offends and disgusts me more than another , it is a sot . ’
52537	52545	52547	52548	the locksmith	7447	‘ Come , Martha , my dear , ’
52551	52585	52547	52548	the locksmith	7447	‘ let us have tea , and do n’t let us talk about sots . There are none here , and Joe do n’t want to hear about them , I dare say . ’
52595	52603	52605	52606	Mrs Varden	219	‘ I dare say he does not , ’
52608	52649	52605	52606	Mrs Varden	219	‘ and I dare say you do not , Varden . It ’s a very unpleasant subject , I have no doubt , though I wo n’t say it ’s personal’--Miggs coughed--‘whatever I may be forced to think’--Miggs sneezed expressively . ‘
52723	52724	52708	52708	Miggs	239	’ ‘
52744	52773	52742	52742	Miggs	239	‘ If you had n’t the sweetness of an angel in you , mim , I do n’t think you could abear it , I raly do n’t . ’
52774	52777	52779	52780	Mrs Varden	219	‘ Miggs , ’
52782	52784	52779	52780	Mrs Varden	219	‘ you ’re
52787	52788	52779	52780	Mrs Varden	219	’ ‘
52795	52803	52793	52793	mim	7753	’ returned Miggs , with shrill rapidity , ‘
52826	52827	52823	52824	a servant	1513	’ ‘
52837	52847	52835	52835	yourself	219	’ retorted her mistress , looking round with dignity , ‘
52901	52902	52876	52876	herself	219	’ ‘
52918	52939	52903	52903	I	0	’ said Miggs , confident in the strength of her compliment , and developing strongly in the throat as usual , ‘
52979	52980	52981	52981	You	219	’ ‘
52991	52998	52988	52988	you	219	’ said Mrs Varden , loftily , ‘
53099	53765	53766	53766	I	0	’ This pronoun was understood in the plural sense , and included both gentlemen , upon both of whom it was rather hard and undeserved , for Gabriel had applied himself to the meal with a very promising appetite , until it was spoilt by Mrs Varden herself , and Joe had as great a liking for the female society of the locksmith ’s house -- or for a part of it at all events -- as man could well entertain . But he had no opportunity to say anything in his own defence , for at that moment Dolly herself appeared , and struck him quite dumb with her beauty . Never had Dolly looked so handsome as she did then , in all the glow and grace of youth , with all her charms increased a hundredfold by a most becoming dress , by a thousand little coquettish ways which nobody could assume with a better grace , and all the sparkling expectation of that accursed party . It is impossible to tell how Joe hated that party wherever it was , and all the other people who were going to it , whoever they were . And she hardly looked at him -- no , hardly looked at him . And when the chair was seen through the open door coming blundering into the workshop , she actually clapped her hands and seemed glad to go . But Joe gave her his arm -- there was some comfort in that -- and handed her into it . To see her seat herself inside , with her laughing eyes brighter than diamonds , and her hand -- surely she had the prettiest hand in the world -- on the ledge of the open window , and her little finger provokingly and pertly tilted up , as if it wondered why Joe did n’t squeeze or kiss it ! To think how well one or two of the modest snowdrops would have become that delicate bodice , and how they were lying neglected outside the parlour window ! To see how Miggs looked on with a face expressive of knowing how all this loveliness was got up , and of being in the secret of every string and pin and hook and eye , and of saying it ai n’t half as real as you think , and I could look quite as well myself if I took the pains ! To hear that provoking precious little scream when the chair was hoisted on its poles , and to catch that transient but not - to - be - forgotten vision of the happy face within -- what torments and aggravations , and yet what delights were these ! The very chairmen seemed favoured rivals as they bore her down the street . There never was such an alteration in a small room in a small time as in that parlour when they went back to finish tea . So dark , so deserted , so perfectly disenchanted . It seemed such sheer nonsense to be sitting tamely there , when she was at a dance with more lovers than man could calculate fluttering about her -- with the whole party doting on and adoring her , and wanting to marry her . Miggs was hovering about too ; and the fact of her existence , the mere circumstance of her ever having been born , appeared , after Dolly , such an unaccountable practical joke . It was impossible to talk . It could n’t be done . He had nothing left for it but to stir his tea round , and round , and round , and ruminate on all the fascinations of the locksmith ’s lovely daughter . Gabriel was dull too . It was a part of the certain uncertainty of Mrs Varden ’s temper , that when they were in this condition , she should be gay and sprightly . ‘
53777	53783	53773	53773	I	0	’ said the smiling housewife , ‘
53801	53802	53793	53793	I	0	’ ‘
53807	53811	53793	53793	I	0	’ sighed Miggs , ‘

53833	53840	53831	53831	Miggs	239	’ said Mrs Varden , rising , ‘
53849	53874	53884	53885	the locksmith	7447	’m a restraint here , and as I wish everybody to enjoy themselves as they best can , I feel I had better go . ’
53875	53882	53884	53885	the locksmith	7447	‘ No , no , Martha , ’
53887	53892	53884	53885	the locksmith	7447	‘ Stop here . I ’m
53906	53912	53904	53904	Joe	264	’ Joe started , and said ‘
53915	53916	53904	53904	Joe	264	’ ‘
53925	53930	53920	53920	Varden	219	’ returned his wife ; ‘
53980	54035	54046	54048	the good lady	8195	’m very glad to have seen you , and I only wish I could have provided something more suitable to your taste . Remember me very kindly if you please to old Mr Willet , and tell him that whenever he comes here I have a crow to pluck with him . Good night ! ’
54389	54398	54399	54399	he	197	‘ I thought it was you , sir , ’
54406	54422	54399	54399	he	197	‘ A fair evening , sir . Glad to see you out of doors again . ’
54429	54458	54423	54424	The gentleman	1227	‘ What gay doings have been going on to - day , Joe ? Is she as pretty as ever ? Nay , do n’t blush , man . ’
54459	54469	54471	54471	Joe	197	‘ If I coloured at all , Mr Edward , ’
54473	54516	54471	54471	Joe	197	‘ which I did n’t know I did , it was to think I should have been such a fool as ever to have any hope of her . She ’s as far out of my reach as -- as Heaven is . ’
54517	54531	54533	54533	Edward	228	‘ Well , Joe , I hope that ’s not altogether beyond it , ’
54539	54542	54533	54533	Edward	228	‘ Eh ? ’
54543	54546	54548	54548	Joe	197	‘ Ah ! ’
54550	54584	54548	54548	Joe	197	‘ It ’s all very fine talking , sir . Proverbs are easily made in cold blood . But it ca n’t be helped . Are you bound for our house , sir ? ’
54585	54612	54533	54533	Edward	228	‘ Yes . As I am not quite strong yet , I shall stay there to - night , and ride home coolly in the morning . ’
54613	54616	54548	54548	Joe	197	‘ If you ’re
54622	54630	54548	54548	Joe	197	’ said Joe after a short silence , ‘
54696	54697	54691	54691	I	0	’ ‘
54703	54707	54701	54701	I	0	’ returned Edward , ‘
54776	54956	54997	54997	sir	7320	’ Joe shook his head ; but there was something so cheery in the buoyant hopeful manner of this speech , that his spirits rose under its influence , and communicated as it would seem some new impulse even to the grey mare , who , breaking from her sober amble into a gentle trot , emulated the pace of Edward Chester ’s horse , and appeared to flatter herself that he was doing his very best . It was a fine dry night , and the light of a young moon , which was then just rising , shed around that peace and tranquillity which gives to evening time its most delicious charm . The lengthened shadows of the trees , softened as if reflected in still water , threw their carpet on the path the travellers pursued , and the light wind stirred yet more softly than before , as though it were soothing Nature in her sleep . By little and little they ceased talking , and rode on side by side in a pleasant silence . ‘
54966	54993	54997	54997	sir	7320	’ said Edward , as they rode along the lane from which , while the intervening trees were bare of leaves , that hostelry was visible . ‘
54999	55013	54997	54997	sir	7320	’ returned Joe , rising in his stirrups to get a better view . ‘
55041	55042	55043	55048	Some benighted horseman wending towards London	1552	’ ‘
55071	55075	55065	55066	the highwayman	1554	’ said Edward . ‘
55095	55096	55093	55093	sir--	1557	’ ‘
55123	55364	55118	55118	We	1559	’ They cantered forward at as brisk a pace as Joe ’s charger could attain , and presently stopped in the little copse where he had left her in the morning . Edward dismounted , gave his bridle to his companion , and walked with a light step towards the house . A female servant was waiting at a side gate in the garden - wall , and admitted him without delay . He hurried along the terrace - walk , and darted up a flight of broad steps leading into an old and gloomy hall , whose walls were ornamented with rusty suits of armour , antlers , weapons of the chase , and suchlike garniture . Here he paused , but not long ; for as he looked round , as if expecting the attendant to have followed , and wondering she had not done so , a lovely girl appeared , whose dark hair next moment rested on his breast . Almost at the same instant a heavy hand was laid upon her arm , Edward felt himself thrust away , and Mr Haredale stood between them . He regarded the young man sternly without removing his hat ; with one hand clasped his niece , and with the other , in which he held his riding - whip , motioned him towards the door . The young man drew himself up , and returned his gaze . ‘
55392	55397	55401	55401	sir	7320	’ said Mr Haredale . ‘
55408	55409	55410	55411	Miss Haredale	199	’ ‘
55415	55421	55410	55411	Miss Haredale	199	’ returned the young man , ‘
55463	55464	55446	55446	You	1560	’ ‘
55483	55488	55477	55479	a true man	932	’ retorted the other , ‘
55549	55550	55536	55536	I	0	’ ‘
55571	55575	55576	55576	Your	1560	’ said Edward . ‘
55591	55592	55593	55593	You	1560	’ ‘
55597	55604	55593	55593	You	1560	’ said Mr Haredale , calmly , ‘
55682	55739	55740	55741	Mr Haredale	206	’ As he said these words , he passed his arm about the waist of the terrified and weeping girl , and drew her closer to him ; and though the habitual severity of his manner was scarcely changed , there was yet apparent in the action an air of kindness and sympathy for her distress . ‘
55743	55747	55740	55741	Mr Haredale	206	’ said Edward , ‘
55832	55833	55834	55834	You	206	’ ‘
55841	55846	55834	55834	You	206	’ answered Mr Haredale , ‘
55904	55905	55883	55883	I	0	’ ‘
55911	55917	55883	55883	I	0	’ said Edward , scornfully . ‘
55929	55934	55883	55883	I	0	’ replied the other . ‘
55940	55941	55883	55883	I	0	’ ‘
55948	55952	55943	55943	you	206	’ said Edward . ‘
56114	56226	56227	56227	He	1589	’ With that , he pressed her cold hand to his lips , and once more encountering and returning Mr Haredale ’s steady look , withdrew . A few words to Joe as he mounted his horse sufficiently explained what had passed , and renewed all that young gentleman ’s despondency with tenfold aggravation . They rode back to the Maypole without exchanging a syllable , and arrived at the door with heavy hearts . Old John , who had peeped from behind the red curtain as they rode up shouting for Hugh , was out directly , and said with great importance as he held the young man ’s stirrup , ‘
56253	56254	56237	56239	A thorough gentleman	1590	’ ‘
56259	56268	56257	56257	Willet	197	’ said Edward carelessly , as he dismounted . ‘
56275	56279	56257	56257	Willet	197	’ replied John . ‘
56286	56287	56290	56290	he	1594	’ ‘
56293	56309	56290	56290	he	1594	’ said Edward , looking with a mixture of alarm and doubt , at Joe . ‘
56315	56319	56312	56312	you	7320	’ said Joe . ‘
56332	56333	56324	56325	Mr Edward	228	’ ‘
56345	56354	56338	56338	you	7320	’ said John , opening his eyes wide . ‘
56393	56394	56395	56395	My	0	’ ‘
56400	56401	56398	56398	Willet	197	’ ‘
56444	56460	56442	56442	sir	7320	’ said John , walking backwards into the road and looking up at the window . ‘
56473	56897	56470	56470	I	0	’ Edward glanced at the window also , and hastily murmuring that he had changed his mind -- forgotten something -- and must return to London , mounted his horse again and rode away ; leaving the Willets , father and son , looking at each other in mute astonishment . Chapter 15 At noon next day , John Willet ’s guest sat lingering over his breakfast in his own home , surrounded by a variety of comforts , which left the Maypole ’s highest flight and utmost stretch of accommodation at an infinite distance behind , and suggested comparisons very much to the disadvantage and disfavour of that venerable tavern . In the broad old - fashioned window - seat -- as capacious as many modern sofas , and cushioned to serve the purpose of a luxurious settee -- in the broad old - fashioned window - seat of a roomy chamber , Mr Chester lounged , very much at his ease , over a well - furnished breakfast - table . He had exchanged his riding - coat for a handsome morning - gown , his boots for slippers ; had been at great pains to atone for the having been obliged to make his toilet when he rose without the aid of dressing - case and tiring equipage ; and , having gradually forgotten through these means the discomforts of an indifferent night and an early ride , was in a state of perfect complacency , indolence , and satisfaction . The situation in which he found himself , indeed , was particularly favourable to the growth of these feelings ; for , not to mention the lazy influence of a late and lonely breakfast , with the additional sedative of a newspaper , there was an air of repose about his place of residence peculiar to itself , and which hangs about it , even in these times , when it is more bustling and busy than it was in days of yore . There are , still , worse places than the Temple , on a sultry day , for basking in the sun , or resting idly in the shade . There is yet a drowsiness in its courts , and a dreamy dulness in its trees and gardens ; those who pace its lanes and squares may yet hear the echoes of their footsteps on the sounding stones , and read upon its gates , in passing from the tumult of the Strand or Fleet Street , ‘
56905	57289	56470	56470	I	0	’ There is still the plash of falling water in fair Fountain Court , and there are yet nooks and corners where dun - haunted students may look down from their dusty garrets , on a vagrant ray of sunlight patching the shade of the tall houses , and seldom troubled to reflect a passing stranger ’s form . There is yet , in the Temple , something of a clerkly monkish atmosphere , which public offices of law have not disturbed , and even legal firms have failed to scare away . In summer time , its pumps suggest to thirsty idlers , springs cooler , and more sparkling , and deeper than other wells ; and as they trace the spillings of full pitchers on the heated ground , they snuff the freshness , and , sighing , cast sad looks towards the Thames , and think of baths and boats , and saunter on , despondent . It was in a room in Paper Buildings -- a row of goodly tenements , shaded in front by ancient trees , and looking , at the back , upon the Temple Gardens -- that this , our idler , lounged ; now taking up again the paper he had laid down a hundred times ; now trifling with the fragments of his meal ; now pulling forth his golden toothpick , and glancing leisurely about the room , or out at window into the trim garden walks , where a few early loiterers were already pacing to and fro . Here a pair of lovers met to quarrel and make up ; there a dark - eyed nursery - maid had better eyes for Templars than her charge ; on this hand an ancient spinster , with her lapdog in a string , regarded both enormities with scornful sidelong looks ; on that a weazen old gentleman , ogling the nursery - maid , looked with like scorn upon the spinster , and wondered she did n’t know she was no longer young . Apart from all these , on the river ’s margin two or three couple of business - talkers walked slowly up and down in earnest conversation ; and one young man sat thoughtfully on a bench , alone . ‘
57295	57319	57290	57290	Ned	228	’ said Mr Chester , glancing at this last - named person as he set down his teacup and plied the golden toothpick , ‘
57346	57364	57369	57369	he	228	’ As he spoke , the figure rose , and came towards him with a rapid pace . ‘
57374	57386	57369	57369	he	228	’ said the father , resuming his newspaper with a yawn . ‘
57390	57416	57387	57388	Dear Ned	228	’ Presently the room - door opened , and the young man entered ; to whom his father gently waved his hand , and smiled . ‘
57428	57432	57435	57435	Ned	228	’ said Edward . ‘
57450	57451	57445	57446	my constitution.--Have	1607	’ ‘

57464	57481	57459	57462	a very early dog	1608	’ cried his father , contemplating him from behind the toothpick , with a languid smile . ‘
57486	57502	57445	57446	my constitution.--Have	1607	’ said Edward , bringing a chair forward , and seating himself near the table , ‘

57548	57553	57558	57558	I	0	’ returned his father , ‘

57583	57587	57575	57575	I	0	’ said Edward . ‘
57598	57607	57591	57591	you	1610	’ returned his father , crossing his legs , ‘
57620	57626	57628	57629	the son	7610	‘ Plainly this , then , ’
57638	57667	57628	57629	the son	7610	‘ that I know where you were last night -- from being on the spot , indeed -- and whom you saw , and what your purpose was . ’
57668	57675	57677	57678	his father	470	‘ You do n’t say so ! ’
57680	57733	57677	57678	his father	470	‘ I am delighted to hear it . It saves us the worry , and terrible wear and tear of a long explanation , and is a great relief for both . At the very house ! Why did n’t you come up ? I should have been charmed to see you . ’
57734	57760	57762	57763	the son	7610	‘ I knew that what I had to say would be better said after a night ’s reflection , when both of us were cool , ’
57765	57766	57762	57763	the son	7610	‘ ’
57772	57777	57770	57770	Ned	228	’ rejoined the father , ‘
57850	57882	57847	57847	you	228	‘ I was about to say , Heaven knows how seriously and earnestly , that you have made me wretched , sir . Will you hear me gravely for a moment ? ’
57883	57888	57890	57891	his father	470	‘ My dear Ned , ’
57893	57911	57890	57891	his father	470	‘ I will hear you with the patience of an anchorite . Oblige me with the milk . ’
57912	57920	57921	57921	Edward	228	‘ I saw Miss Haredale last night , ’
57932	57987	57921	57921	Edward	228	‘ her uncle , in her presence , immediately after your interview , and , as of course I know , in consequence of it , forbade me the house , and , with circumstances of indignity which are of your creation I am sure , commanded me to leave it on the instant . ’
57988	58009	58011	58012	his father	470	‘ For his manner of doing so , I give you my honour , Ned , I am not accountable , ’
58014	58051	58011	58012	his father	470	‘ That you must excuse . He is a mere boor , a log , a brute , with no address in life.--Positively a fly in the jug . The first I have seen this year . ’
58067	58070	58072	58074	the young man	476	‘ Father , ’
58082	58123	58072	58074	the young man	476	‘ we must not trifle in this matter . We must not deceive each other , or ourselves . Let me pursue the manly open part I wish to take , and do not repel me by this unkind indifference . ’
58124	58132	58134	58135	the other	483	‘ Whether I am indifferent or no , ’
58137	58244	58134	58135	the other	483	‘ I leave you , my dear boy , to judge . A ride of twenty - five or thirty miles , through miry roads -- a Maypole dinner -- a tete - a - tete with Haredale , which , vanity apart , was quite a Valentine and Orson business -- a Maypole bed -- a Maypole landlord , and a Maypole retinue of idiots and centaurs;--whether the voluntary endurance of these things looks like indifference , dear Ned , or like the excessive anxiety , and devotion , and all that sort of thing , of a parent , you shall determine for yourself . ’
58245	58254	58256	58256	Edward	228	‘ I wish you to consider , sir , ’
58258	58274	58256	58256	Edward	228	‘ in what a cruel situation I am placed . Loving Miss Haredale as I do’-- ‘
58279	58288	58256	58256	Edward	228	’ interrupted his father with a compassionate smile , ‘

58462	58467	58427	58427	Ned	228	’ rejoined his son , ‘

59210	59233	59199	59199	you	228	’ Edward having obeyed him , he took an elegant little knife from his pocket , and paring his nails , continued : ‘

59600	59604	59592	59592	You	7320	’ said Edward . ‘

60059	60064	60053	60053	Ned	228	’ returned the father . ‘
60234	60250	60251	60251	I	0	’ The young man leant his head upon his hand , and made no answer . ‘
60256	60296	60251	60251	I	0	’ said the father rising , and walking slowly to and fro -- stopping now and then to glance at himself in the mirror , or survey a picture through his glass , with the air of a connoisseur , ‘

60379	60399	60373	60373	you	0	’ returned the son , raising his head for a moment , and then falling into his former attitude , ‘

60447	60590	60443	60443	My	0	’ said the father--‘for you really talk so like a child that I must call you one -- you were bred upon a careful principle ; the very manner of your education , I assure you , maintained my credit surprisingly . As to the life I lead , I must lead it , Ned . I must have these little refinements about me . I have always been used to them , and I can not exist without them . They must surround me , you observe , and therefore they are here . With regard to our circumstances , Ned , you may set your mind at rest upon that score . They are desperate . Your own appearance is by no means despicable , and our joint pocket - money alone devours our income . That ’s the truth . ’
60591	60624	60632	60632	his	1706	‘ Why have I never known this before ? Why have you encouraged me , sir , to an expenditure and mode of life to which we have no right or title ? ’
60625	60630	60632	60633	his father	470	‘ My good fellow , ’
60639	60734	60632	60633	his father	470	‘ if you made no appearance , how could you possibly succeed in the pursuit for which I destined you ? As to our mode of life , every man has a right to live in the best way he can ; and to make himself as comfortable as he can , or he is an unnatural scoundrel . Our debts , I grant , are very great , and therefore it the more behoves you , as a young man of principle and honour , to pay them off as speedily as possible . ’
60735	60741	60743	60743	Edward	228	‘ The villain ’s part , ’
60745	60773	60743	60743	Edward	228	‘ that I have unconsciously played ! I to win the heart of Emma Haredale ! I would , for her sake , I had died first ! ’
60774	60783	60785	60786	his father	470	‘ I am glad you see , Ned , ’
60788	61112	60785	60786	his father	470	‘ how perfectly self - evident it is , that nothing can be done in that quarter . But apart from this , and the necessity of your speedily bestowing yourself on another ( as you know you could to - morrow , if you chose ) , I wish you ’d look upon it pleasantly . In a religious point of view alone , how could you ever think of uniting yourself to a Catholic , unless she was amazingly rich ? You ought to be so very Protestant , coming of such a Protestant family as you do . Let us be moral , Ned , or we are nothing . Even if one could set that objection aside , which is impossible , we come to another which is quite conclusive . The very idea of marrying a girl whose father was killed , like meat ! Good God , Ned , how disagreeable ! Consider the impossibility of having any respect for your father - in - law under such unpleasant circumstances -- think of his having been “ viewed ” by jurors , and “ sat upon ” by coroners , and of his very doubtful position in the family ever afterwards . It seems to me such an indelicate sort of thing that I really think the girl ought to have been put to death by the state to prevent its happening . But I tease you perhaps . You would rather be alone ? My dear Ned , most willingly . God bless you . I shall be going out presently , but we shall meet to - night , or if not to - night , certainly to - morrow . Take care of yourself in the mean time , for both our sakes . You are a person of great consequence to me , Ned -- of vast consequence indeed . God bless you ! ’

Gaming , the vice which ran so high among all classes ( the fashion being of course set by the upper ) , was generally the cause of these disputes ; for cards and dice were as openly used , and worked as much mischief , and yielded as much excitement below stairs , as above . While incidents like these , arising out of drums and masquerades and parties at quadrille , were passing at the west end of the town , heavy stagecoaches and scarce heavier waggons were lumbering slowly towards the city , the coachmen , guard , and passengers , armed to the teeth , and the coach -- a day or so perhaps behind its time , but that was nothing -- despoiled by highwaymen ; who made no scruple to attack , alone and single - handed , a whole caravan of goods and men , and sometimes shot a passenger or two , and were sometimes shot themselves , as the case might be . On the morrow , rumours of this new act of daring on the road yielded matter for a few hours ’

63002	63026	62978	62979	this fellow	7469	‘ Blacker than last , though that was pitchy too . Did n’t I pass you near the turnpike in the Oxford Road ? ’
63027	63039	62978	62979	this fellow	7469	‘ It ’s like you may . I do n’t know . ’

63194	63204	63154	63155	the stranger	7287	’ replied the other , shaking him roughly off ; ‘
63212	63254	63262	63263	the fellow	879	’re a prudent man ; I carry arms which go off easily -- they have done so , before now -- and make it dangerous for strangers who do n’t know the trick of them , to lay hands upon me . ’

Give the alarm , cry out , refuse to shelter me . I will not hurt you . But I will not be taken alive ; and so surely as you threaten me above your breath , I fall a dead man on this floor .

65149	65153	65154	65154	he	1858	‘ For warmth , ’
65165	65175	65154	65154	he	1858	‘ For warmth . You are rich , perhaps ? ’
65176	65179	65180	65180	she	7604	‘ Very , ’
65184	65195	65180	65180	she	7604	‘ Very rich . No doubt I am very rich . ’

65233	65254	65255	65255	She	7604	‘ Give me your purse . You had it in your hand at the door . Give it to me . ’
65298	65342	65287	65287	she	7604	‘ Take what there is , take all , take more if more were there , but go before it is too late . I have heard a wayward step without , I know full well . It will return directly . Begone . ’
65343	65349	65287	65287	she	7604	‘ What do you mean ? ’
65350	65399	65287	65287	she	7604	‘ Do not stop to ask . I will not answer . Much as I dread to touch you , I would drag you to the door if I possessed the strength , rather than you should lose an instant . Miserable wretch ! fly from this place . ’
65400	65412	65414	65415	the man	472	‘ If there are spies without , I am safer here , ’

65437	65443	65445	65453	the widow , who had listened for the step	1864	‘ It is too late ! ’
65460	65485	65487	65487	she	1864	‘ Hark to that foot upon the ground . Do you tremble to hear it ! It is my son , my idiot son ! ’

65558	65616	65555	65556	the widow	7604	‘ has been upon me all my life , and I will not . Evil will fall upon him , if you stand eye to eye . My blighted boy ! Oh ! all good angels who know the truth -- hear a poor mother ’s prayer , and spare my boy from knowledge of this man ! ’

65629	65654	65626	65627	the man	472	‘ He calls you . That voice and cry ! It was he who grappled with me in the road . Was it he ? ’
65746	65757	65758	65758	he	472	‘ Why , who can keep out Grip and me ! ’
65772	65790	65758	65758	he	472	‘ Are you there , mother ? How long you keep us from the fire and light . ’
65823	65945	65811	65811	his	220	‘ We have been afield , mother -- leaping ditches , scrambling through hedges , running down steep banks , up and away , and hurrying on . The wind has been blowing , and the rushes and young plants bowing and bending to it , lest it should do them harm , the cowards -- and Grip -- ha ha ha!--brave Grip , who cares for nothing , and when the wind rolls him over in the dust , turns manfully to bite it -- Grip , bold Grip , has quarrelled with every little bowing twig -- thinking , he told me , that it mocked him -- and has worried it like a bulldog . Ha ha ha ! ’
66014	66023	66025	66025	Barnaby	220	‘ He takes such care of me besides ! ’
66027	66095	66096	66097	The raven	1309	‘ Such care , mother ! He watches all the time I sleep , and when I shut my eyes and make - believe to slumber , he practises new learning softly ; but he keeps his eye on me the while , and if he sees me laugh , though never so little , stops directly . He wo n’t surprise me till he ’s perfect . ’
66108	66123	66096	66097	The raven	1309	‘ Those are certainly some of my characteristics , and I glory in them . ’
66173	66182	66184	66184	Barnaby	220	‘ How pale you are to - night ! ’
66191	66204	66184	66184	Barnaby	220	‘ We have been cruel , Grip , and made her anxious ! ’
66267	66273	66275	66275	Barnaby	220	‘ He flaps his wings , ’
66290	66310	66275	66275	Barnaby	220	‘ as if there were strangers here , but Grip is wiser than to fancy that . Jump then ! ’
66429	66432	66434	66434	Barnaby	220	‘ Mother ! ’
66454	66475	66434	66434	Barnaby	220	‘ I ’ll tell you where we have been to - day , and what we have been doing,--shall I ? ’
66495	66501	66503	66503	Barnaby	220	‘ You must n’t tell , ’
66510	66567	66503	66503	Barnaby	220	‘ for it ’s a secret , mind , and only known to me , and Grip , and Hugh . We had the dog with us , but he ’s not like Grip , clever as he is , and does n’t guess it yet , I ’ll wager.--Why do you look behind me so ? ’
66568	66572	66573	66573	she	1880	‘ Did I ? ’
66577	66589	66573	66573	she	1880	‘ I did n’t know I did . Come nearer me . ’
66590	66595	66597	66597	Barnaby	220	‘ You are frightened ! ’
66602	66609	66597	66597	Barnaby	220	‘ Mother -- you do n’t see’-- ‘
66613	66614	66597	66597	Barnaby	220	’ ‘
66627	66646	66647	66647	I	0	’ he answered in a whisper , drawing closer to her and clasping the mark upon his wrist . ‘
66704	66750	66670	66670	you	1880	’ He fell into a shivering fit as he put the question , and shutting out the light with his hands , sat shaking in every limb until it had passed away . After a time , he raised his head and looked about him . ‘
66755	66756	66670	66670	you	1880	’ ‘
66763	66771	66670	66670	you	1880	’ rejoined his mother , soothing him . ‘
66789	66809	66780	66780	You	1880	’ He gazed at her vacantly , and , becoming reassured by degrees , burst into a wild laugh . ‘
66815	66821	66812	66812	us	1882	’ he said , thoughtfully . ‘
66837	66838	66812	66812	us	1882	’ ‘

66853	66913	66851	66851	I	0	’ said Barnaby,--‘that ’s it . Maypole Hugh , and I , you know , and Grip -- we have been lying in the forest , and among the trees by the road side , with a dark lantern after night came on , and the dog in a noose ready to slip him when the man came by . ’
66914	66918	66968	66968	He	1883	‘ What man ? ’
66919	66967	66968	66968	He	1883	‘ The robber ; him that the stars winked at . We have waited for him after dark these many nights , and we shall have him . I ’d know him in a thousand . Mother , see here ! This is the man . Look ! ’
67018	67028	67029	67029	he	1883	‘ Ha ha ha ! We shall have him , ’
67045	67087	67033	67033	himself	1883	‘ You shall see him , mother , bound hand and foot , and brought to London at a saddle - girth ; and you shall hear of him at Tyburn Tree if we have luck . So Hugh says . You ’re
67103	67104	67097	67097	you	1883	’ ‘
67109	67113	67114	67114	I	0	’ she answered . ‘
67132	67133	67121	67121	you	1883	’ ‘
67137	67141	67142	67142	I	0	’ he answered . ‘
67210	67268	67203	67203	Grip	237	’ The raven flapped his wings , and , croaking his satisfaction , hopped to the feet of his master , and there held his bill open , ready for snapping up such lumps of meat as he should throw him . Of these he received about a score in rapid succession , without the smallest discomposure . ‘
67273	67277	67203	67203	Grip	237	’ said Barnaby . ‘
67280	67284	67203	67203	Grip	237	’ cried Grip . ‘
67287	67483	67203	67203	Grip	237	’ But it appearing for a certainty that no more was to be had , he retreated with his store ; and disgorging the morsels one by one from his pouch , hid them in various corners -- taking particular care , however , to avoid the closet , as being doubtful of the hidden man ’s propensities and power of resisting temptation . When he had concluded these arrangements , he took a turn or two across the room with an elaborate assumption of having nothing on his mind ( but with one eye hard upon his treasure all the time ) , and then , and not till then , began to drag it out , piece by piece , and eat it with the utmost relish . Barnaby , for his part , having pressed his mother to eat in vain , made a hearty supper too . Once during the progress of his meal , he wanted more bread from the closet and rose to get it . She hurriedly interposed to prevent him , and summoning her utmost fortitude , passed into the recess , and brought it out herself . ‘
67486	67504	67203	67203	Grip	237	’ said Barnaby , looking at her steadfastly as she sat down beside him after doing so ; ‘
67512	67513	67203	67203	Grip	237	’ ‘
67518	67522	67203	67203	Grip	237	’ she answered . ‘
67552	67553	67554	67554	I	0	’ ‘
67564	67568	67554	67554	I	0	’ said Barnaby . ‘
67585	67591	67592	67592	I	0	’ She asked him why ? ‘
67598	67602	67592	67592	I	0	’ he said . ‘
67745	67746	67747	67747	I	0	’ ‘
67748	67752	67740	67740	her	1893	’m a devil ! ’
67758	67763	67765	67765	Barnaby	220	‘ No , no , ’
67767	67826	67765	67765	Barnaby	220	‘ But you said something in a prayer ; and when you rose and walked about , you looked ( as you have done ever since , mother , towards night on my birthday ) just as you do now . I have found that out , you see , though I am silly . So I say you ’re
67841	67897	67839	67839	Grip	237	’ The bird received this information with a crow of such duration as a cock , gifted with intelligence beyond all others of his kind , might usher in the longest day with . Then , as if he had well considered the sentiment , and regarded it as apposite to birthdays , he cried , ‘
67902	68063	68064	68064	Polly	188	’ a great many times , and flapped his wings for emphasis . The widow tried to make light of Barnaby ’s remark , and endeavoured to divert his attention to some new subject ; too easy a task at all times , as she knew . His supper done , Barnaby , regardless of her entreaties , stretched himself on the mat before the fire ; Grip perched upon his leg , and divided his time between dozing in the grateful warmth , and endeavouring ( as it presently appeared ) to recall a new accomplishment he had been studying all day . A long and profound silence ensued , broken only by some change of position on the part of Barnaby , whose eyes were still wide open and intently fixed upon the fire ; or by an effort of recollection on the part of Grip , who would cry in a low voice from time to time , ‘
68068	68117	68118	68118	Polly	188	’ and there stop short , forgetting the remainder , and go off in a doze again . After a long interval , Barnaby ’s breathing grew more deep and regular , and his eyes were closed . But even then the unquiet spirit of the raven interposed . ‘
68122	68194	68195	68195	Polly	188	’ cried Grip , and his master was broad awake again . At length Barnaby slept soundly , and the bird with his bill sunk upon his breast , his breast itself puffed out into a comfortable alderman - like form , and his bright eye growing smaller and smaller , really seemed to be subsiding into a state of repose . Now and then he muttered in a sepulchral voice , ‘
68199	68240	68195	68195	Polly	188	’ but very drowsily , and more like a drunken man than a reflecting raven . The widow , scarcely venturing to breathe , rose from her seat . The man glided from the closet , and extinguished the candle . ‘
68244	68258	68195	68195	Polly	188	’ cried Grip , suddenly struck with an idea and very much excited . ‘
68299	68304	68278	68278	Polly	188	’m a devil , I ’m
68309	68332	68278	68278	Polly	188	’m a ket - tle on , Keep up your spirits , Never say die , Bow , wow , wow , I ’m
68337	68344	68347	68347	Polly	188	’m a ket - tle , I ’m
68361	68437	68347	68347	Polly	188	’ They stood rooted to the ground , as though it had been a voice from the grave . But even this failed to awaken the sleeper . He turned over towards the fire , his arm fell to the ground , and his head drooped heavily upon it . The widow and her unwelcome visitor gazed at him and at each other for a moment , and then she motioned him towards the door . ‘
68440	68444	68445	68445	You	1897	’ he whispered . ‘
68451	68452	68445	68445	You	1897	’ ‘
68474	68475	68469	68469	I	0	’ ‘

68533	68543	68526	68526	you	1897	’ cried the widow , throwing herself between them . ‘
68546	68559	68544	68544	Woman	7510	’ he returned between his teeth , as he motioned her aside , ‘
68584	68638	68639	68639	Observe	276	’ With that he advanced , and bending down over the prostrate form , softly turned back the head and looked into the face . The light of the fire was upon it , and its every lineament was revealed distinctly . He contemplated it for a brief space , and hastily uprose . ‘
68641	68650	68639	68639	Observe	276	’ he whispered in the widow ’s ear : ‘
68708	68709	68699	68699	I	0	’ ‘
68725	68726	68719	68719	I	0	’ ‘
68772	68830	68769	68769	my	0	’ He pointed , as he left her , to the slumbering form , and stealthily withdrawing , made his way into the street . She fell on her knees beside the sleeper , and remained like one stricken into stone , until the tears which fear had frozen so long , came tenderly to her relief . ‘
68834	68838	68832	68832	Thou	1903	’ she cried , ‘
68930	69984	70001	70001	commander	1908	’ Chapter 18 Gliding along the silent streets , and holding his course where they were darkest and most gloomy , the man who had left the widow ’s house crossed London Bridge , and arriving in the City , plunged into the backways , lanes , and courts , between Cornhill and Smithfield ; with no more fixedness of purpose than to lose himself among their windings , and baffle pursuit , if any one were dogging his steps . It was the dead time of the night , and all was quiet . Now and then a drowsy watchman ’s footsteps sounded on the pavement , or the lamplighter on his rounds went flashing past , leaving behind a little track of smoke mingled with glowing morsels of his hot red link . He hid himself even from these partakers of his lonely walk , and , shrinking in some arch or doorway while they passed , issued forth again when they were gone and so pursued his solitary way . To be shelterless and alone in the open country , hearing the wind moan and watching for day through the whole long weary night ; to listen to the falling rain , and crouch for warmth beneath the lee of some old barn or rick , or in the hollow of a tree ; are dismal things -- but not so dismal as the wandering up and down where shelter is , and beds and sleepers are by thousands ; a houseless rejected creature . To pace the echoing stones from hour to hour , counting the dull chimes of the clocks ; to watch the lights twinkling in chamber windows , to think what happy forgetfulness each house shuts in ; that here are children coiled together in their beds , here youth , here age , here poverty , here wealth , all equal in their sleep , and all at rest ; to have nothing in common with the slumbering world around , not even sleep , Heaven ’s gift to all its creatures , and be akin to nothing but despair ; to feel , by the wretched contrast with everything on every hand , more utterly alone and cast away than in a trackless desert ; this is a kind of suffering , on which the rivers of great cities close full many a time , and which the solitude in crowds alone awakens . The miserable man paced up and down the streets -- so long , so wearisome , so like each other -- and often cast a wistful look towards the east , hoping to see the first faint streaks of day . But obdurate night had yet possession of the sky , and his disturbed and restless walk found no relief . One house in a back street was bright with the cheerful glare of lights ; there was the sound of music in it too , and the tread of dancers , and there were cheerful voices , and many a burst of laughter . To this place -- to be near something that was awake and glad -- he returned again and again ; and more than one of those who left it when the merriment was at its height , felt it a check upon their mirthful mood to see him flitting to and fro like an uneasy ghost . At last the guests departed , one and all ; and then the house was close shut up , and became as dull and silent as the rest . His wanderings brought him at one time to the city jail . Instead of hastening from it as a place of ill omen , and one he had cause to shun , he sat down on some steps hard by , and resting his chin upon his hand , gazed upon its rough and frowning walls as though even they became a refuge in his jaded eyes . He paced it round and round , came back to the same spot , and sat down again . He did this often , and once , with a hasty movement , crossed to where some men were watching in the prison lodge , and had his foot upon the steps as though determined to accost them . But looking round , he saw that the day began to break , and failing in his purpose , turned and fled . He was soon in the quarter he had lately traversed , and pacing to and fro again as he had done before . He was passing down a mean street , when from an alley close at hand some shouts of revelry arose , and there came straggling forth a dozen madcaps , whooping and calling to each other , who , parting noisily , took different ways and dispersed in smaller groups . Hoping that some low place of entertainment which would afford him a safe refuge might be near at hand , he turned into this court when they were all gone , and looked about for a half - opened door , or lighted window , or other indication of the place whence they had come . It was so profoundly dark , however , and so ill - favoured , that he concluded they had but turned up there , missing their way , and were pouring out again when he observed them . With this impression , and finding there was no outlet but that by which he had entered , he was about to turn , when from a grating near his feet a sudden stream of light appeared , and the sound of talking came . He retreated into a doorway to see who these talkers were , and to listen to them . The light came to the level of the pavement as he did this , and a man ascended , bearing in his hand a torch . This figure unlocked and held open the grating as for the passage of another , who presently appeared , in the form of a young man of small stature and uncommon self - importance , dressed in an obsolete and very gaudy fashion . ‘

70009	70048	70052	70052	captain	7793	’ In return to these compliments the other bade him hold his tongue , and keep his noise to himself , and laid upon him many similar injunctions , with great fluency of speech and sternness of manner . ‘
70059	70070	70071	70072	My captain	1094	’ returned the torch - bearer in a lower voice . ‘

70123	70151	70121	70121	Stagg	244	’ said Mr Tappertit , stepping on the pavement of the court , and brushing from his legs the dust he had contracted in his passage upward . ‘
70156	70166	70121	70121	Stagg	244	’ cried Stagg , clasping one of his ankles . ‘

70254	70289	70253	70253	you	1094	’re spoke to on particular subjects , and not otherways . Hold the torch up till I ’ve got to the end of the court , and then kennel yourself , do you hear ? ’
70290	70298	70253	70253	you	1094	‘ I hear you , noble captain . ’
70299	70303	70305	70306	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Obey then , ’
70309	70315	70305	70306	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Gentlemen , lead on ! ’
70410	70415	70404	70404	he	1085	‘ Who ’s there ? ’
70416	70420	70422	70423	the other	483	‘ A man , ’
70427	70431	70422	70423	the other	483	‘ A friend . ’
70432	70436	70438	70440	the blind man	1085	‘ A stranger ! ’
70442	70455	70438	70440	the blind man	1085	‘ Strangers are not my friends . What do you do there ? ’
70456	70477	70422	70423	the other	483	‘ I saw your company come out , and waited here till they were gone . I want a lodging . ’
70478	70485	70487	70487	Stagg	244	‘ A lodging at this time ! ’
70499	70508	70495	70495	he	244	‘ Do you know the day is breaking ? ’
70509	70514	70516	70517	the other	483	‘ I know it , ’
70519	70536	70516	70517	the other	483	‘ to my cost . I have been traversing this iron - hearted town all night . ’
70537	70545	70547	70549	the blind man	1085	‘ You had better traverse it again , ’
70555	70572	70547	70549	the blind man	1085	‘ till you find some lodgings suitable to your taste . I do n’t let any . ’
70573	70576	70516	70517	the other	483	‘ Stay ! ’
70587	70624	70626	70628	the blind man	1085	‘ I ’ll beat this light about that hangdog face of yours ( for hangdog it is , if it answers to your voice ) , and rouse the neighbourhood besides , if you detain me , ’
70630	70639	70626	70628	the blind man	1085	‘ Let me go . Do you hear ? ’
70640	70645	70647	70648	the other	483	‘ Do YOU hear ! ’
70664	70759	70647	70648	the other	483	‘ I beg nothing of you . I will pay for the shelter you give me . Death ! Is it much to ask of such as you ! I have come from the country , and desire to rest where there are none to question me . I am faint , exhausted , worn out , almost dead . Let me lie down , like a dog , before your fire . I ask no more than that . If you would be rid of me , I will depart to - morrow . ’
70760	70771	70773	70773	Stagg	244	‘ If a gentleman has been unfortunate on the road , ’

70856	70904	70833	70833	you	1934	’ The blind man complied after a moment ’s hesitation , and they descended together . The dialogue had passed as hurriedly as the words could be spoken , and they stood in his wretched room before he had had time to recover from his first surprise . ‘
70919	70928	70929	70929	You	1934	’ said the man , glancing keenly round . ‘
70935	70936	70937	70937	I	0	’ ‘
70954	71637	71638	71638	I	0	’ He bade him lead the way , and , by the light of the torch which his conductor held up for the purpose , inspected all three cellars narrowly . Assured that the blind man had spoken truth , and that he lived there alone , the visitor returned with him to the first , in which a fire was burning , and flung himself with a deep groan upon the ground before it . His host pursued his usual occupation without seeming to heed him any further . But directly he fell asleep -- and he noted his falling into a slumber , as readily as the keenest - sighted man could have done -- he knelt down beside him , and passed his hand lightly but carefully over his face and person . His sleep was checkered with starts and moans , and sometimes with a muttered word or two . His hands were clenched , his brow bent , and his mouth firmly set . All this , the blind man accurately marked ; and as if his curiosity were strongly awakened , and he had already some inkling of his mystery , he sat watching him , if the expression may be used , and listening , until it was broad day . Chapter 19 Dolly Varden ’s pretty little head was yet bewildered by various recollections of the party , and her bright eyes were yet dazzled by a crowd of images , dancing before them like motes in the sunbeams , among which the effigy of one partner in particular did especially figure , the same being a young coachmaker ( a master in his own right ) who had given her to understand , when he handed her into the chair at parting , that it was his fixed resolve to neglect his business from that time , and die slowly for the love of her -- Dolly ’s head , and eyes , and thoughts , and seven senses , were all in a state of flutter and confusion for which the party was accountable , although it was now three days old , when , as she was sitting listlessly at breakfast , reading all manner of fortunes ( that is to say , of married and flourishing fortunes ) in the grounds of her teacup , a step was heard in the workshop , and Mr Edward Chester was descried through the glass door , standing among the rusty locks and keys , like love among the roses -- for which apt comparison the historian may by no means take any credit to himself , the same being the invention , in a sentimental mood , of the chaste and modest Miggs , who , beholding him from the doorsteps she was then cleaning , did , in her maiden meditation , give utterance to the simile . The locksmith , who happened at the moment to have his eyes thrown upward and his head backward , in an intense communing with Toby , did not see his visitor , until Mrs Varden , more watchful than the rest , had desired Sim Tappertit to open the glass door and give him admission -- from which untoward circumstance the good lady argued ( for she could deduce a precious moral from the most trifling event ) that to take a draught of small ale in the morning was to observe a pernicious , irreligious , and Pagan custom , the relish whereof should be left to swine , and Satan , or at least to Popish persons , and should be shunned by the righteous as a work of sin and evil . She would no doubt have pursued her admonition much further , and would have founded on it a long list of precious precepts of inestimable value , but that the young gentleman standing by in a somewhat uncomfortable and discomfited manner while she read her spouse this lecture , occasioned her to bring it to a premature conclusion . ‘
71639	71648	71650	71651	Mrs Varden	219	’m sure you ’ll excuse me , sir , ’
71657	71677	71650	71651	Mrs Varden	219	‘ Varden is so very thoughtless , and needs so much reminding -- Sim , bring a chair here . ’
71694	71702	71704	71705	the locksmith	7447	‘ And you can go , Sim , ’
71787	71827	71829	71830	Mrs V.	265	‘ I am sure if there ’s anything we can do,--Varden , or I , or Dolly either,--to serve you , sir , at any time , you have only to say it , and it shall be done , ’
71831	71843	71845	71845	Edward	228	‘ I am much obliged to you , I am sure , ’
71847	71866	71867	71868	Mrs Varden	219	‘ You encourage me to say that I have come here now , to beg your good offices . ’
71874	71900	71902	71902	Edward	228	‘ It occurred to me that probably your fair daughter might be going to the Warren , either to - day or to - morrow , ’
71908	71980	71902	71902	Edward	228	‘ and if so , and you will allow her to take charge of this letter , ma’am , you will oblige me more than I can tell you . The truth is , that while I am very anxious it should reach its destination , I have particular reasons for not trusting it to any other conveyance ; so that without your help , I am wholly at a loss . ’
71981	72007	72008	72009	the lady	1941	‘ She was not going that way , sir , either to - day , or to - morrow , nor indeed all next week , ’
72013	72051	72053	72054	Mrs Varden	219	‘ but we shall be very glad to put ourselves out of the way on your account , and if you wish it , you may depend upon its going to - day . You might suppose , ’
72061	72111	72053	72054	Mrs Varden	219	‘ from Varden ’s sitting there so glum and silent , that he objected to this arrangement ; but you must not mind that , sir , if you please . It ’s his way at home . Out of doors , he can be cheerful and talkative enough . ’
72163	72167	72168	72168	he	1943	‘ My dear Martha-- ’
72171	72179	72181	72182	Mrs Varden	219	‘ Oh yes , I dare say , ’
72193	72202	72181	72182	Mrs Varden	219	‘ Very dear ! We all know that . ’
72203	72211	72213	72213	Gabriel	242	‘ No , but my good soul , ’
72215	72255	72213	72213	Gabriel	242	‘ you are quite mistaken . You are indeed . I was delighted to find you so kind and ready . I waited , my dear , anxiously , I assure you , to hear what you would say . ’
72256	72261	72263	72264	Mrs V.	265	‘ You waited anxiously , ’
72265	72301	72303	72304	the lady	1941	‘ Yes ! Thank you , Varden . You waited , as you always do , that I might bear the blame , if any came of it . But I am used to it , ’
72312	72319	72303	72304	the lady	1941	‘ and that ’s my comfort ! ’
72320	72328	72330	72330	Gabriel	242	‘ I give you my word , Martha-- ’
72332	72343	72345	72346	his wife	7765	‘ Let me give you MY word , my dear , ’
72352	72413	72345	72346	his wife	7765	‘ that such discussions as these between married people , are much better left alone . Therefore , if you please , Varden , we ’ll drop the subject . I have no wish to pursue it . I could . I might say a great deal . But I would rather not . Pray do n’t say any more . ’
72414	72424	72426	72428	the goaded locksmith	1947	‘ I do n’t want to say any more , ’
72430	72437	72439	72440	Mrs Varden	219	‘ Well then , do n’t , ’
72442	72451	72453	72454	the locksmith	7447	‘ Nor did I begin it , Martha , ’
72460	72466	72453	72454	the locksmith	7447	‘ I must say that . ’
72467	72476	72482	72482	her	7765	‘ You did not begin it , Varden ! ’
72504	72542	72495	72495	she	7765	‘ You did not begin it , Varden ! But you shall not say I was out of temper . No , you did not begin it , oh dear no , not you , my dear ! ’
72543	72548	72550	72551	the locksmith	7447	‘ Well , well , ’
72553	72559	72550	72551	the locksmith	7447	‘ That ’s settled then . ’
72560	72564	72566	72567	his wife	7765	‘ Oh yes , ’
72569	72632	72566	72567	his wife	7765	‘ quite . If you like to say Dolly began it , my dear , I shall not contradict you . I know my duty . I need know it , I am sure . I am often obliged to bear it in mind , when my inclination perhaps would be for the moment to forget it . Thank you , Varden . ’
72662	72683	72645	72645	she	7765	‘ If you desire to see the first and foremost among female martyrs , here she is , on view ! ’
72921	72923	72925	72926	the locksmith	7447	‘ Martha-- ’
72928	72935	72937	72938	his wife	7765	‘ I hear you , Varden , ’
72946	73007	72937	72938	his wife	7765	‘ I am sorry , my dear , you have such an objection to the Maypole and old John , for otherways as it ’s a very fine morning , and Saturday ’s not a busy day with us , we might have all three gone to Chigwell in the chaise , and had quite a happy day of it . ’
73026	73035	73037	73038	the locksmith	7447	‘ What is the matter now , Martha ? ’
73045	73054	73042	73042	Martha	213	‘ Oh ! do n’t speak to me , ’

73101	73135	73137	73138	the locksmith	7447	‘ would n’t have believed what ? Tell me what ’s wrong now . Do tell me . Upon my soul I do n’t know . Do YOU know , child ? Damme ! ’
73150	73162	73137	73138	the locksmith	7447	‘ nobody does know , I verily believe , but Miggs ! ’

73179	73213	73168	73169	Mrs Varden	219	‘ is attached to me , and that is sufficient to draw down hatred upon her in this house . She is a comfort to me , whatever she may be to others . ’
73214	73222	73224	73224	Gabriel	242	‘ She ’s no comfort to me , ’
73231	73250	73224	73224	Gabriel	242	‘ She ’s the misery of my life . She ’s all the plagues of Egypt in one . ’
73251	73262	73264	73265	Mrs Varden	219	‘ She ’s considered so , I have no doubt , ’
73267	73310	73264	73265	Mrs Varden	219	‘ I was prepared for that ; it ’s natural ; it ’s of a piece with the rest . When you taunt me as you do to my face , how can I wonder that you taunt her behind her back ! ’
73640	73655	73657	73657	Dolly	216	‘ If it ’s only for the sake of peace and quietness , father , ’

73999	74033	73992	73992	she	1980	’ Mrs Varden with a faint smile gently reproved her attendant for this enthusiasm , and reminded her at the same time that she was far too unwell to venture out that day . ‘

74228	74888	74889	74889	I	0	’ For five minutes or thereabouts , Mrs Varden remained mildly opposed to all her husband ’s prayers that she would oblige him by taking a day ’s pleasure , but relenting at length , she suffered herself to be persuaded , and granting him her free forgiveness ( the merit whereof , she meekly said , rested with the Manual and not with her ) , desired that Miggs might come and help her dress . The handmaid attended promptly , and it is but justice to their joint exertions to record that , when the good lady came downstairs in course of time , completely decked out for the journey , she really looked as if nothing had happened , and appeared in the very best health imaginable . As to Dolly , there she was again , the very pink and pattern of good looks , in a smart little cherry - coloured mantle , with a hood of the same drawn over her head , and upon the top of that hood , a little straw hat trimmed with cherry - coloured ribbons , and worn the merest trifle on one side -- just enough in short to make it the wickedest and most provoking head - dress that ever malicious milliner devised . And not to speak of the manner in which these cherry - coloured decorations brightened her eyes , or vied with her lips , or shed a new bloom on her face , she wore such a cruel little muff , and such a heart - rending pair of shoes , and was so surrounded and hemmed in , as it were , by aggravations of all kinds , that when Mr Tappettit , holding the horse ’s head , saw her come out of the house alone , such impulses came over him to decoy her into the chaise and drive off like mad , that he would unquestionably have done it , but for certain uneasy doubts besetting him as to the shortest way to Gretna Green ; whether it was up the street or down , or up the right - hand turning or the left ; and whether , supposing all the turnpikes to be carried by storm , the blacksmith in the end would marry them on credit ; which by reason of his clerical office appeared , even to his excited imagination , so unlikely , that he hesitated . And while he stood hesitating , and looking post - chaises - and - six at Dolly , out came his master and his mistress , and the constant Miggs , and the opportunity was gone for ever . For now the chaise creaked upon its springs , and Mrs Varden was inside ; and now it creaked again , and more than ever , and the locksmith was inside ; and now it bounded once , as if its heart beat lightly , and Dolly was inside ; and now it was gone and its place was empty , and he and that dreary Miggs were standing in the street together . The hearty locksmith was in as good a humour as if nothing had occurred for the last twelve months to put him out of his way , Dolly was all smiles and graces , and Mrs Varden was agreeable beyond all precedent . As they jogged through the streets talking of this thing and of that , who should be descried upon the pavement but that very coachmaker , looking so genteel that nobody would have believed he had ever had anything to do with a coach but riding in it , and bowing like any nobleman . To be sure Dolly was confused when she bowed again , and to be sure the cherry - coloured ribbons trembled a little when she met his mournful eye , which seemed to say , ‘
74909	74915	74908	74908	you	1991	’re the cause of it . ’
75004	75008	75002	75002	his	7447	‘ pulling - up ’
75281	75284	75295	75295	him	193	‘ Yoho ! ’
75853	75859	75861	75861	John	193	‘ A bit of fish , ’
75866	75906	75861	75861	John	193	‘ and some lamb chops ( breaded , with plenty of ketchup ) , and a good salad , and a roast spring chicken , with a dish of sausages and mashed potatoes , or something of that sort . ’
76559	76568	76570	76570	Dolly	216	‘ I have heard about it , miss , ’
76572	76593	76570	76570	Dolly	216	‘ and it ’s very sad indeed , but when things are at the worst they are sure to mend . ’
76594	76605	76607	76607	Emma	261	‘ But are you sure they are at the worst ? ’
76612	76636	76638	76638	Dolly	216	‘ Why , I do n’t see how they can very well be more unpromising than they are ; I really do n’t , ’
76640	76649	76638	76638	Dolly	216	‘ And I bring something to begin with . ’
76650	76655	76656	76656	Dolly	216	‘ Not from Edward ? ’
76911	76926	76928	76928	Dolly	216	‘ I am sure that ’s what I should do if it was me , ’
76930	76958	76928	76928	Dolly	216	‘ To make one ’s sweetheart miserable is well enough and quite right , but to be made miserable one ’s self is a little too much ! ’
77614	77620	77622	77623	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Come here , girl , ’
77631	77639	77622	77623	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I want to speak to you . ’
77640	77648	77622	77623	Mr Haredale	206	‘ If you please , sir , I ’m
77653	77657	77622	77623	Mr Haredale	206	’ faltered Dolly , ‘
77691	77692	77681	77681	you	206	’ ‘
77695	77715	77681	77681	you	206	’ said Mr Haredale , who had by this time led her into the room and closed the door . ‘
77727	77728	77721	77721	You	216	’ ‘
77751	77752	77753	77753	I	0	’ ‘
77759	77764	77756	77756	I	0	’ said Mr Haredale . ‘
77779	77780	77784	77784	sir	7320	’ ‘
77786	77790	77784	77784	sir	7320	’ faltered Dolly . ‘
77804	77823	77791	77791	You	206	’ Dolly hesitated for a little while , and somewhat emboldened by his manner , said at last , ‘
77834	77835	77847	77851	the bearer of the answer	2075	’ ‘
77853	77875	77876	77876	You	216	’ Dolly hesitated again , and not being able to decide upon any other course of action , burst into tears . ‘
77882	77887	77876	77876	You	216	’ said Mr Haredale . ‘
77925	77951	77954	77954	sir	7320	’ Dolly had what is popularly called a spirit of her own , and being now fairly at bay , made the best of it . ‘
77956	77967	77954	77954	sir	7320	’ she rejoined , trembling and frightened as she was . ‘
77994	78005	77993	77993	I	0	’m very sorry,--but I wo n’t . There , sir . ’
78006	78017	78019	78020	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I commend your firmness and your plain - speaking , ’
78022	78050	78019	78020	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Rest assured that I have as little desire to take your letter as your life . You are a very discreet messenger and a good girl . ’
78066	78070	78057	78057	she	2079	‘ coming over her ’
78106	78112	78114	78115	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I have some design , ’
78145	78184	78127	78127	he	7320	‘ of providing a companion for my niece ; for her life is a very lonely one . Would you like the office ? You are the oldest friend she has , and the best entitled to it . ’
78185	78193	78195	78195	Dolly	216	‘ I do n’t know , sir , ’
78205	78231	78200	78200	he	7320	‘ I ca n’t say . I do n’t know what they might wish at home . I could n’t give an opinion , sir . ’
78232	78245	78247	78248	Mr Haredale	206	‘ If your friends had no objection , would you have any ? ’
78250	78264	78247	78248	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Come . There ’s a plain question ; and easy to answer . ’
78265	78275	78277	78277	Dolly	216	‘ None at all that I know of sir , ’
78279	78297	78277	78277	Dolly	216	‘ I should be very glad to be near Miss Emma of course , and always am . ’
78298	78303	78305	78306	Mr Haredale	206	‘ That ’s well , ’
78308	78330	78305	78306	Mr Haredale	206	‘ That is all I had to say . You are anxious to go . Do n’t let me detain you . ’
79010	79015	79016	79016	she	216	‘ Was it you ? ’
79019	79036	79016	79016	she	216	‘ how glad I am to see you ! and how could you terrify me so ! ’
79057	79065	79067	79067	Dolly	216	‘ Did you come to meet me ? ’
79092	79101	79103	79103	Dolly	216	‘ I thought it likely they would send , ’
79110	79115	79117	79117	his	198	‘ Nobody sent me , ’
79121	79129	79117	79117	his	198	‘ I came of my own accord . ’
79319	79331	79333	79333	Hugh	198	‘ Why do you spend so much breath in avoiding me ? ’
79348	79370	79333	79333	Hugh	198	‘ I wish to get back as quickly as I can , and you walk too near me , answered Dolly . ’
79371	79375	79377	79377	Hugh	198	‘ Too near ! ’
79393	79399	79377	79377	Hugh	198	‘ Why too near ? You ’re
79407	79408	79377	79377	Hugh	198	’ ‘
79420	79424	79416	79416	You	2099	’ answered Dolly . ‘
79436	79437	79416	79416	You	2099	’ ‘
79442	79454	79416	79416	You	2099	’ he rejoined , endeavouring to draw her arm through his , ‘
79461	79514	79416	79416	You	2099	’ She released herself and clenching her little hand , struck him with right good will . At this , Maypole Hugh burst into a roar of laughter , and passing his arm about her waist , held her in his strong grasp as easily as if she had been a bird . ‘
79573	79574	79569	79569	I	0	’ ‘
79579	79593	79569	79569	I	0	’ she cried , endeavouring with both her hands to push him off . ‘
79600	79601	79602	79602	You	7750	’ ‘
79613	79617	79618	79618	You	7750	’ said Hugh . ‘
79650	79673	79674	79674	She	7750	’re proud . Ha ha ha ! You ca n’t hide your beauty from a poor fellow ; that ’s a comfort ! ’
79732	79735	79737	79739	the panting girl	2103	‘ Hugh , ’
79741	79772	79737	79739	the panting girl	2103	‘ good Hugh ; if you will leave me I will give you anything -- everything I have -- and never tell one word of this to any living creature . ’
79773	79779	79780	79780	he	0	‘ You had best not , ’
79783	79929	79780	79780	he	0	‘ Harkye , little dove , you had best not . All about here know me , and what I dare do if I have a mind . If ever you are going to tell , stop when the words are on your lips , and think of the mischief you ’ll bring , if you do , upon some innocent heads that you would n’t wish to hurt a hair of . Bring trouble on me , and I ’ll bring trouble and something more on them in return . I care no more for them than for so many dogs ; not so much -- why should I ? I ’d sooner kill a man than a dog any day . I ’ve never been sorry for a man ’s death in all my life , and I have for a dog ’s . ’
80028	80054	80012	80012	he	198	‘ Softly , darling -- gently -- would you fly from rough Hugh , that loves you as well as any drawing - room gallant ? ’
80055	80059	80060	80060	she	2104	‘ I would , ’
80069	80075	80060	80060	she	2104	‘ I will . Help ! ’
80076	80083	80085	80085	Hugh	198	‘ A fine for crying out , ’
80087	80110	80060	80060	she	2104	‘ Ha ha ha ! A fine , pretty one , from your lips . I pay myself ! Ha ha ha ! ’
80111	80118	80120	80120	she	2104	‘ Help ! help ! help ! ’
80143	80147	80149	80150	the girl	813	‘ Thank Heaven ! ’
80155	80166	80149	80150	the girl	813	‘ Joe , dear Joe , this way . Help ! ’
80206	80215	80196	80196	He	198	‘ Tell HIM : and see what follows ! ’
80241	80268	80235	80236	Joe Willet	197	‘ What is the matter ? are you hurt ? what was it ? who was it ? where is he ? what was he like ? ’
80455	80463	80465	80465	Joe	197	‘ What was it that frightened you ? ’
80550	80560	80524	80524	she	216	‘ Stop when the words are on your lips . ’
80733	80737	80723	80723	Dolly	216	‘ The letter ! ’
80738	80742	80744	80744	Joe	197	‘ What letter ? ’
80746	80763	80764	80764	she	216	‘ That I was carrying -- I had it in my hand . My bracelet too , ’
80771	80778	80764	80764	she	216	‘ I have lost them both . ’
80779	80786	80788	80788	Joe	197	‘ Do you mean just now ? ’
80790	80804	80806	80806	Dolly	216	‘ Either I dropped them then , or they were taken from me , ’
80817	80832	80806	80806	Dolly	216	‘ They are gone , both gone . What an unhappy girl I am ! ’
81298	81310	81312	81313	Mr Willet	194	‘ He ’s lying asleep before the kitchen fire , sir , ’
81315	81323	81312	81313	Mr Willet	194	‘ What do you want him for ? ’
81324	81340	81342	81342	Joe	197	‘ I want him to come with me to look after this bracelet and letter , ’
81344	81350	81342	81342	Joe	197	‘ Halloa there ! Hugh ! ’
81397	81404	81406	81406	Joe	197	‘ Here , sleepy - head , ’
81413	81440	81406	81406	Joe	197	‘ Carry this , and bring the dog , and that small cudgel of yours . And woe betide the fellow if we come upon him . ’
81441	81445	81447	81447	Hugh	198	‘ What fellow ? ’
81456	81460	81462	81462	Joe	197	‘ What fellow ? ’
81475	81544	81462	81462	Joe	197	‘ a fellow you ought to know of and be more alive about . It ’s well for the like of you , lazy giant that you are , to be snoring your time away in chimney - corners , when honest men ’s daughters ca n’t cross even our quiet meadows at nightfall without being set upon by footpads , and frightened out of their precious lives . ’
81545	81551	81553	81553	Hugh	198	‘ They never rob me , ’
81558	81585	81462	81462	Joe	197	‘ I have got nothing to lose . But I ’d as lief knock them at head as any other men . How many are there ? ’
81586	81590	81592	81592	Dolly	216	‘ Only one , ’
81601	81610	81612	81612	Hugh	198	‘ And what was he like , mistress ? ’
81636	81641	81612	81612	Hugh	198	‘ About my height ? ’
81642	81649	81650	81650	Dolly	216	‘ Not -- not so tall , ’
81659	81663	81665	81665	Hugh	198	‘ His dress , ’
81672	81706	81665	81665	Hugh	198	‘ like -- like any of ours now ? I know all the people hereabouts , and maybe could give a guess at the man , if I had anything to guide me . ’
81743	81757	81759	81759	Hugh	198	‘ You would n’t know him if you saw him then , belike ? ’
81765	81770	81772	81772	Dolly	216	‘ I should not , ’
81779	81832	81772	81772	Dolly	216	‘ I do n’t wish to see him . I ca n’t bear to think of him . I ca n’t talk about him any more . Do n’t go to look for these things , Mr Joe , pray do n’t . I entreat you not to go with that man . ’
81833	81840	81842	81842	Hugh	198	‘ Not to go with me ! ’
81844	81846	81842	81842	Hugh	198	‘ I ’m
81854	81881	81883	81883	Hugh	198	’re all afraid of me . Why , bless you mistress , I ’ve the tenderest heart alive . I love all the ladies , ma’am , ’
82231	82233	82223	82224	Mrs Varden	219	‘ Grace ’
82260	82264	82223	82224	Mrs Varden	219	‘ before meat , ’
83416	83420	83422	83423	the rider	612	‘ a friend ! ’
83438	83443	83445	83445	Dolly	216	‘ This man again ! ’
83449	83452	83454	83454	Joe	264	‘ Hugh ! ’
83456	83463	83454	83454	Joe	264	‘ What errand are you upon ? ’
83464	83473	83474	83474	he	264	‘ I come to ride back with you , ’
83485	83490	83474	83474	he	264	‘ HE sent me . ’
83491	83495	83498	83498	Joe	264	‘ My father ! ’
83511	83525	83498	83498	Joe	264	‘ Will he never think me man enough to take care of myself ! ’
83526	83529	83531	83531	Hugh	198	‘ Aye ! ’
83540	83560	83531	83531	Hugh	198	‘ The roads are not safe just now , he says , and you ’d better have a companion . ’
83561	83566	83568	83568	Joe	264	‘ Ride on then , ’
83570	83572	83568	83568	Joe	264	‘ I ’m
83579	83815	83568	83568	Joe	264	’ Hugh complied , and they went on again . It was his whim or humour to ride immediately before the chaise , and from this position he constantly turned his head , and looked back . Dolly felt that he looked at her , but she averted her eyes and feared to raise them once , so great was the dread with which he had inspired her . This interruption , and the consequent wakefulness of Mrs Varden , who had been nodding in her sleep up to this point , except for a minute or two at a time , when she roused herself to scold the locksmith for audaciously taking hold of her to prevent her nodding herself out of the chaise , put a restraint upon the whispered conversation , and made it difficult of resumption . Indeed , before they had gone another mile , Gabriel stopped at his wife ’s desire , and that good lady protested she would not hear of Joe ’s going a step further on any account whatever . It was in vain for Joe to protest on the other hand that he was by no means tired , and would turn back presently , and would see them safely past such a point , and so forth . Mrs Varden was obdurate , and being so was not to be overcome by mortal agency . ‘
83825	83831	83820	83820	I	0	’ said Joe , sorrowfully . ‘
83835	83844	83820	83820	I	0	’ said Dolly . She would have added , ‘
83858	84004	83856	83856	him	591	’ but he had turned his horse ’s head , and was standing close to them . She had therefore nothing for it but to suffer Joe to give her hand a gentle squeeze , and when the chaise had gone on for some distance , to look back and wave it , as he still lingered on the spot where they had parted , with the tall dark figure of Hugh beside him . What she thought about , going home ; and whether the coach - maker held as favourable a place in her meditations as he had occupied in the morning , is unknown . They reached home at last -- at last , for it was a long way , made none the shorter by Mrs Varden ’s grumbling . Miggs hearing the sound of wheels was at the door immediately . ‘
84015	84033	84012	84012	they	2168	’ cried Miggs , clapping her hands , and issuing forth to help her mistress to alight . ‘
84092	84093	84094	84094	I	0	’ ‘
84114	84119	84120	84120	Master	2174	’ said the locksmith . ‘
84126	84136	84124	84124	mim	7753	’ said Miggs , in a tone of commiseration , ‘
84145	84196	84144	84144	I	0	’m sure . After what he has seen of you this day , I never will believe but that he has a deal more affection in his heart than to speak unkind . Come in and sit yourself down by the fire ; there ’s a good dear -- do . ’
84224	84230	84232	84233	the locksmith	7447	‘ Martha , my dear , ’
84241	84283	84232	84233	the locksmith	7447	‘ if you ’ll look to Dolly yourself or let somebody else do it , perhaps it will be only kind and reasonable . She has been frightened , you know , and is not at all well to - night . ’
85322	85326	85328	85330	the young lady	7328	‘ Oh Simmun ! ’
85332	85347	85328	85330	the young lady	7328	‘ such goings on to - day ! Oh , gracious me , Simmun ! ’
85412	85423	85425	85425	Miggs	239	‘ I never heard the like , nor nobody else , ’
85427	85460	85425	85425	Miggs	239	‘ The idea of interfering with HER . What people can see in her to make it worth their while to do so , that ’s the joke -- he he he ! ’
85490	85493	85487	85487	she	2212	‘ her . ’
85494	85500	85502	85502	Miggs	239	‘ Why , that Dolly , ’
85513	85541	85502	85502	Miggs	239	‘ But , oh upon my word and honour , young Joseph Willet is a brave one ; and he do deserve her , that he do . ’
85542	85545	85547	85548	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Woman ! ’
85560	85563	85547	85548	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ beware ! ’
85564	85570	85572	85572	Miggs	239	‘ My stars , Simmun ! ’
85578	85590	85572	85572	Miggs	239	‘ You frighten me to death ! What ’s the matter ? ’
85591	85596	85598	85599	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ There are strings , ’
85613	85632	85602	85602	his	223	‘ in the human heart that had better not be wibrated . That ’s what ’s the matter . ’
85633	85641	85572	85572	Miggs	239	‘ Oh , very well -- if you ’re
85646	85653	85602	85602	his	223	’ cried Miggs , turning away . ‘
85659	85670	85602	85602	his	223	’ said Mr Tappertit , detaining her by the wrist . ‘
85688	85788	85680	85680	you	2214	’ Notwithstanding this uncivil exhortation , Miggs gladly did as she was required ; and told him how that their young mistress , being alone in the meadows after dark , had been attacked by three or four tall men , who would have certainly borne her away and perhaps murdered her , but for the timely arrival of Joseph Willet , who with his own single hand put them all to flight , and rescued her ; to the lasting admiration of his fellow - creatures generally , and to the eternal love and gratitude of Dolly Varden . ‘
85792	85825	85826	85826	His	2215	’ said Mr Tappertit , fetching a long breath when the tale was told , and rubbing his hair up till it stood stiff and straight on end all over his head . ‘
85831	85832	85835	85835	Simmun	254	’ ‘
85837	85838	85835	85835	Simmun	254	’ ‘
85843	85846	85835	85835	Simmun	254	’ said the ‘
85849	85863	85864	85864	Miggs	239	‘ his days are numbered . Leave me . Get along with you . ’
86032	86035	86078	86078	He	228	‘ the world ’
86197	86202	86203	86203	he	228	‘ Upon my honour , ’
86230	86293	86203	86203	he	228	‘ upon my honour , the most masterly composition , the most delicate thoughts , the finest code of morality , and the most gentlemanly sentiments in the universe ! Ah Ned , Ned , if you would but form your mind by such precepts , we should have but one common feeling on every subject that could possibly arise between us ! ’
86323	86328	86329	86329	he	228	‘ My Lord Chesterfield , ’
86345	86422	86329	86329	he	228	‘ if I could but have profited by your genius soon enough to have formed my son on the model you have left to all wise fathers , both he and I would have been rich men . Shakespeare was undoubtedly very fine in his way ; Milton good , though prosy ; Lord Bacon deep , and decidedly knowing ; but the writer who should be his country ’s pride , is my Lord Chesterfield . ’
86435	86449	86450	86450	he	228	‘ I thought I was tolerably accomplished as a man of the world , ’
86453	86603	86450	86450	he	228	‘ I flattered myself that I was pretty well versed in all those little arts and graces which distinguish men of the world from boors and peasants , and separate their character from those intensely vulgar sentiments which are called the national character . Apart from any natural prepossession in my own favour , I believed I was . Still , in every page of this enlightened writer , I find some captivating hypocrisy which has never occurred to me before , or some superlative piece of selfishness to which I was utterly a stranger . I should quite blush for myself before this stupendous creature , if remembering his precepts , one might blush at anything . An amazing man ! a nobleman indeed ! any King or Queen may make a Lord , but only the Devil himself -- and the Graces -- can make a Chesterfield . ’
86643	86646	86648	86648	they	2227	‘ For , ’
86650	86675	86648	86648	they	2227	‘ this is honesty , this is truth . All mankind are like us , but they have not the candour to avow it . ’
86801	86810	86811	86811	he	228	‘ A late hour for an importunate creditor , ’
86845	86905	86815	86815	his	228	‘ Much after their accustomed time . The usual pretence I suppose . No doubt a heavy payment to make up tomorrow . Poor fellow , he loses time , and time is money as the good proverb says -- I never found it out though . Well . What now ? You know I am not at home . ’
86906	86912	86914	86915	the servant	2235	‘ A man , sir , ’
86933	86975	86914	86915	the servant	2235	‘ has brought home the riding - whip you lost the other day . I told him you were out , but he said he was to wait while I brought it in , and would n’t go till I did . ’
86976	86982	86984	86985	his master	586	‘ He was quite right , ’
86987	86990	86914	86915	the servant	2235	‘ and you ’re
87020	87074	87002	87002	him	586	’ The man laid the whip on a chair , and withdrew . The master , who had only heard his foot upon the ground and had not taken the trouble to turn round and look at him , shut his book , and pursued the train of ideas his entrance had disturbed . ‘
87080	87090	87002	87002	him	586	’ he said , handling his snuff - box , ‘
87198	87199	87195	87195	you	2240	’ ‘
87204	87223	87195	87195	you	2240	’ replied Hugh , striding in , followed by a dog , as rough and sullen as himself ; ‘
87252	87253	87254	87256	My good fellow	8082	’ ‘
87258	87280	87254	87256	My good fellow	8082	’ returned the other , raising his head a little from the cushion and carelessly surveying him from top to toe , ‘
87312	87313	87314	87314	I	0	’ ‘
87315	87319	87321	87321	Hugh	198	’m well enough , ’
87324	87336	87321	87321	Hugh	198	‘ You look a perfect marvel of health . Sit down . ’
87337	87343	87345	87345	Hugh	198	‘ I ’d rather stand , ’
87347	87354	87345	87345	Hugh	198	‘ Please yourself my good fellow , ’
87378	87385	87356	87357	Mr Chester	228	‘ Please yourself by all means . ’
87432	87443	87444	87444	he	228	‘ Are you going to speak to me , master ? ’
87452	87457	87444	87444	he	228	‘ My worthy creature , ’
87462	87478	87480	87480	yourself	2245	‘ you are a little ruffled and out of humour . I ’ll wait till you ’re
87489	87721	87723	87723	you	2246	’ This behaviour had its intended effect . It humbled and abashed the man , and made him still more irresolute and uncertain . Hard words he could have returned , violence he would have repaid with interest ; but this cool , complacent , contemptuous , self - possessed reception , caused him to feel his inferiority more completely than the most elaborate arguments . Everything contributed to this effect . His own rough speech , contrasted with the soft persuasive accents of the other ; his rude bearing , and Mr Chester ’s polished manner ; the disorder and negligence of his ragged dress , and the elegant attire he saw before him ; with all the unaccustomed luxuries and comforts of the room , and the silence that gave him leisure to observe these things , and feel how ill at ease they made him ; all these influences , which have too often some effect on tutored minds and become of almost resistless power when brought to bear on such a mind as his , quelled Hugh completely . He moved by little and little nearer to Mr Chester ’s chair , and glancing over his shoulder at the reflection of his face in the glass , as if seeking for some encouragement in its expression , said at length , with a rough attempt at conciliation , ‘
87739	87740	87723	87723	you	2246	’ ‘
87744	87749	87751	87751	you	2246	’ said Mr Chester , ‘

87778	87785	87787	87787	I	0	’ returned Hugh with increased embarrassment , ‘
87823	87824	87812	87812	he	7320	’ ‘
87837	87851	87833	87835	a twin brother	2252	’ said Mr Chester , glancing at the reflection of his anxious face ; ‘
87861	87862	87833	87835	a twin brother	2252	’ ‘
87870	87874	87864	87864	I	0	’ said Hugh , ‘
87909	87938	87898	87898	I	0	’ As he spoke , he laid upon the dressing - table , Dolly ’s lost epistle . The very letter that had cost her so much trouble . ‘
87950	87968	87940	87940	you	2246	’ said Mr Chester , casting his eye upon it without the least perceptible surprise or pleasure . ‘
87972	87976	87940	87940	you	2246	’ said Hugh . ‘
87979	87980	87940	87940	you	2246	’ ‘

88001	88002	87996	87997	One Varden	216	’ ‘
88006	88012	87996	87997	One Varden	216	’ said Mr Chester gaily . ‘
88021	88022	88016	88016	you	2246	’ ‘
88026	88027	88016	88016	you	2246	’ ‘
88030	88063	88016	88016	you	2246	’ said the other , in a drawling manner , for he was fixing a very small patch of sticking plaster on a very small pimple near the corner of his mouth . ‘
88067	88068	88016	88016	you	2246	’ ‘
88073	88081	88016	88016	you	2246	’ replied Hugh , after some hesitation . ‘
88086	88087	88016	88016	you	2246	’ ‘
88090	88091	88092	88092	I	0	’ ‘
88095	88170	88171	88171	Hugh	198	’ said Mr Chester , in the same easy tone , and smiling twice or thrice to try if the patch adhered--‘I think there was something else . I have heard a trifle of jewellery spoken of -- a mere trifle -- a thing of such little value , indeed , that you may have forgotten it . Do you remember anything of the kind -- such as a bracelet now , for instance ? ’
88220	88230	88231	88231	he	0	‘ You took that for yourself my excellent friend , ’
88234	88279	88280	88280	he	0	‘ and may keep it . I am neither a thief nor a receiver . Do n’t show it to me . You had better hide it again , and lose no time . Do n’t let me see where you put it either , ’
88288	88290	88280	88280	he	0	‘ You ’re
88295	88310	88280	88280	he	0	’ said Hugh bluntly , despite the increasing awe in which he held him . ‘
88319	88328	88313	88313	you	198	’ striking the letter with his heavy hand . ‘
88336	88342	88329	88329	I	0	’ said Mr Chester coolly . ‘
88361	88375	88354	88354	You	7428	’ Hugh drew his sleeve across his lips , and gruffly answered yes . ‘
88394	88452	88354	88354	You	7428	’ He obeyed . His patron followed him with his eyes , and when his back was turned , smiled as he had never done when he stood beside the mirror . On his return he filled the glass , and bade him drink . That dram despatched , he poured him out another , and another . ‘
88459	88468	88472	88472	you	7428	’ he said , filling the glass again . ‘
88499	88512	88514	88514	I	0	’ he added , as he tossed it down his hairy throat , ‘
88523	88524	88514	88514	I	0	’ ‘
88550	88558	88559	88559	we	2263	’ said Mr Chester with great composure , ‘
88585	88586	88577	88577	You	7428	’ ‘
88596	88618	88619	88619	I	0	’ cried Hugh boisterously , waving the empty glass above his head , and throwing himself into a rude dancing attitude . ‘
88758	88759	88760	88760	You	0	’ ‘
88768	88799	88760	88760	You	0	’ said Mr Chester , putting on his cravat with great deliberation , and slightly moving his head from side to side to settle his chin in its proper place . ‘
88805	88806	88801	88803	a boon companion	2276	’ ‘
88815	88819	88813	88813	master	7428	’ said Hugh , ‘
88824	88833	88808	88808	you	7428	’ baring the brawny limb to the elbow . ‘
88860	88861	88862	88862	You	0	’ ‘
88867	88872	88862	88862	You	0	’ said Mr Chester , ‘
88881	88882	88883	88883	I	0	’ ‘
88907	88911	88927	88927	I	0	’ cried Hugh . ‘
88958	88959	88960	88960	You	0	’ ‘
88967	88988	88960	88960	You	0	’ said his patron , putting on his waistcoat with great nicety , and taking no heed of this request , ‘
89015	89016	89017	89017	I	0	’ ‘
89022	89023	89017	89017	I	0	’ ‘
89028	89033	89017	89017	I	0	’ said Mr Chester , ‘
89082	89140	89078	89078	yours	0	’ Hugh fell back a pace or two and surveyed him with a look of mingled terror , indignation , and surprise . Regarding himself in the glass with the same complacency as before , and speaking as smoothly as if he were discussing some pleasant chit - chat of the town , his patron went on : ‘
89219	89220	89207	89207	I	0	’ ‘
89225	89229	89207	89207	I	0	’ said Hugh . ‘
89244	89245	89232	89232	you	0	’ ‘
89248	89267	89268	89268	I	0	’ said Mr Chester , wheeling sharply round , and looking full at him for the first time . ‘
89278	89290	89268	89268	I	0	’ Hugh faltered , and muttered something which was not audible . ‘
89301	89310	89295	89295	I	0	’ said Mr Chester , with surpassing affability . ‘
89344	89642	89342	89342	yourself	0	’ With these words he turned to the glass again , and went on with his toilet . Hugh would have answered him that he , the questioner himself had set him on , but the words stuck in his throat . The consummate art with which his patron had led him to this point , and managed the whole conversation , perfectly baffled him . He did not doubt that if he had made the retort which was on his lips when Mr Chester turned round and questioned him so keenly , he would straightway have given him into custody and had him dragged before a justice with the stolen property upon him ; in which case it was as certain he would have been hung as it was that he had been born . The ascendency which it was the purpose of the man of the world to establish over this savage instrument , was gained from that time . Hugh ’s submission was complete . He dreaded him beyond description ; and felt that accident and artifice had spun a web about him , which at a touch from such a master - hand as his , would bind him to the gallows . With these thoughts passing through his mind , and yet wondering at the very same time how he who came there rioting in the confidence of this man ( as he thought ) , should be so soon and so thoroughly subdued , Hugh stood cowering before him , regarding him uneasily from time to time , while he finished dressing . When he had done so , he took up the letter , broke the seal , and throwing himself back in his chair , read it leisurely through . ‘
89676	89697	89698	89698	You	2291	’ As he spoke , he twisted it up , and glancing lazily round at Hugh as though he would say ‘
89702	89733	89698	89698	You	2291	’ held it in the flame of the candle . When it was in a full blaze , he tossed it into the grate , and there it smouldered away . ‘
89741	89749	89751	89751	you	7914	’ he said , turning to Hugh , ‘
89785	89812	89782	89782	your	7914	’ Hugh stepped forward to receive the piece of money he held out to him . As he put it in his hand , he added : ‘
89853	89875	89876	89876	He	0	’ This was said with a smile which implied -- or Hugh thought it did--‘fail to do so at your peril ! ’
89882	89887	89889	89890	his patron	2259	‘ And do n’t , ’
89901	89953	89889	89890	his patron	2259	‘ do n’t be at all downcast or uneasy respecting that little rashness we have been speaking of . Your neck is as safe in my hands , my good fellow , as though a baby ’s fingers clasped it , I assure you.--Take another glass . You are quieter now . ’
89975	89991	89993	89994	Mr Chester	228	‘ Do n’t you -- ha , ha!--don’t you drink to the drink any more ? ’
90002	90008	89997	89997	his	228	‘ To you , sir , ’
90021	90027	89997	89997	his	228	‘ I drink to you . ’
90028	90064	89997	89997	his	228	‘ Thank you . God bless you . By the bye , what is your name , my good soul ? You are called Hugh , I know , of course -- your other name ? ’
90065	90072	89997	89997	his	228	‘ I have no other name . ’
90073	90100	89997	89997	his	228	‘ A very strange fellow ! Do you mean that you never knew one , or that you do n’t choose to tell it ? Which ? ’
90101	90110	90112	90112	Hugh	198	‘ I ’d tell it if I could , ’
90116	90188	90112	90112	Hugh	198	‘ I ca n’t . I have been always called Hugh ; nothing more . I never knew , nor saw , nor thought about a father ; and I was a boy of six -- that ’s not very old -- when they hung my mother up at Tyburn for a couple of thousand men to stare at . They might have let her live . She was poor enough . ’
90189	90194	90196	90197	his patron	2259	‘ How very sad ! ’
90204	90216	90196	90197	his patron	2259	‘ I have no doubt she was an exceedingly fine woman . ’
90217	90225	90227	90227	Hugh	198	‘ You see that dog of mine ? ’
90231	90238	90247	90247	his	2259	‘ Faithful , I dare say ? ’
90250	90271	90247	90247	his	2259	‘ and immensely clever ? Virtuous and gifted animals , whether man or beast , always are so very hideous . ’
90272	90298	90300	90300	Hugh	198	‘ Such a dog as that , and one of the same breed , was the only living thing except me that howled that day , ’
90302	90380	90300	90300	Hugh	198	‘ Out of the two thousand odd -- there was a larger crowd for its being a woman -- the dog and I alone had any pity . If he ’d have been a man , he ’d have been glad to be quit of her , for she had been forced to keep him lean and half - starved ; but being a dog , and not having a man ’s sense , he was sorry . ’
90381	90391	90393	90394	Mr Chester	228	‘ It was dull of the brute , certainly , ’
90396	90403	90393	90394	Mr Chester	228	‘ and very like a brute . ’
90436	90440	90441	90441	he	198	‘ Good night , ’
90444	90448	90441	90441	he	198	‘ Remember ; you ’re
90514	90573	90512	90512	you	2298	’ Hugh truckled before the hidden meaning of these words as much as such a being could , and crept out of the door so submissively and subserviently -- with an air , in short , so different from that with which he had entered -- that his patron on being left alone , smiled more than ever . ‘
90577	90589	90590	90590	I	0	’ he said , as he took a pinch of snuff , ‘
90644	90682	90618	90618	she	879	’ With this comforting reflection , he put on his coat , took a farewell glance at the glass , and summoned his man , who promptly attended , followed by a chair and its two bearers . ‘
90685	90690	90618	90618	she	879	’ said Mr Chester . ‘
90746	91175	91176	91177	A friend	7434	’ The man obeyed ; and the room and its master being both purified , nothing remained for Mr Chester but to demand his hat , to fold it jauntily under his arm , to take his seat in the chair and be carried off ; humming a fashionable tune . Chapter 24 How the accomplished gentleman spent the evening in the midst of a dazzling and brilliant circle ; how he enchanted all those with whom he mingled by the grace of his deportment , the politeness of his manner , the vivacity of his conversation , and the sweetness of his voice ; how it was observed in every corner , that Chester was a man of that happy disposition that nothing ruffled him , that he was one on whom the world ’s cares and errors sat lightly as his dress , and in whose smiling face a calm and tranquil mind was constantly reflected ; how honest men , who by instinct knew him better , bowed down before him nevertheless , deferred to his every word , and courted his favourable notice ; how people , who really had good in them , went with the stream , and fawned and flattered , and approved , and despised themselves while they did so , and yet had not the courage to resist ; how , in short , he was one of those who are received and cherished in society ( as the phrase is ) by scores who individually would shrink from and be repelled by the object of their lavish regard ; are things of course , which will suggest themselves . Matter so commonplace needs but a passing glance , and there an end . The despisers of mankind -- apart from the mere fools and mimics , of that creed -- are of two sorts . They who believe their merit neglected and unappreciated , make up one class ; they who receive adulation and flattery , knowing their own worthlessness , compose the other . Be sure that the coldest - hearted misanthropes are ever of this last order . Mr Chester sat up in bed next morning , sipping his coffee , and remembering with a kind of contemptuous satisfaction how he had shone last night , and how he had been caressed and courted , when his servant brought in a very small scrap of dirty paper , tightly sealed in two places , on the inside whereof was inscribed in pretty large text these words : ‘
91196	91197	91207	91207	you	2307	’ ‘
91212	91234	91207	91207	you	2307	’ said his master . It was given him by a person then waiting at the door , the man replied . ‘
91241	91265	91267	91267	him	2309	’ said Mr Chester . With nothing more threatening about him , it appeared , than a leather apron and a dirty face . ‘
91271	91325	91267	91267	him	2309	’ In he came -- Mr Tappertit ; with his hair still on end , and a great lock in his hand , which he put down on the floor in the middle of the chamber as if he were about to go through some performances in which it was a necessary agent . ‘
91328	91337	91326	91326	Sir	7320	’ said Mr Tappertit with a low bow , ‘
91387	91447	91448	91448	You	7320	’ Mr Chester held the bed - curtain farther back , and looked at him with a vague impression that he was some maniac , who had not only broken open the door of his place of confinement , but had brought away the lock . Mr Tappertit bowed again , and displayed his legs to the best advantage . ‘
91454	91466	91452	91452	sir	7320	’ said Mr Tappertit , laying his hand upon his breast , ‘
91488	91489	91452	91452	sir	7320	’ ‘
91493	91498	91499	91499	I	0	’ asked Mr Chester . ‘

91516	91521	91452	91452	sir	7320	’ said Mr Tappertit . ‘
91557	91613	91619	91619	sir	7320	’ Mr Chester laid himself calmly down in bed again , and turning a perfectly undisturbed face towards the strange apparition , which had by this time closed the door , begged him to speak out , and to be as rational as he could , without putting himself to any very great personal inconvenience . ‘
91621	91640	91619	91619	sir	7320	’ said Mr Tappertit , producing a small pocket - handkerchief and shaking it out of the folds , ‘
91697	91709	91710	91710	you	7320	’ said Mr Tappertit , offering it with a graceful air , ‘
91717	91718	91720	91720	you	0	’ ‘
91722	91743	91766	91766	my	0	’ answered Mr Chester , politely accepting it , and turning to some blood - red characters at one end . ‘
91756	91757	91762	91762	sir	7320	’ ‘
91769	91772	91762	91762	sir	7320	’ replied the ‘
91775	91800	91802	91803	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ They are merely intended as directions to the washerwoman , and have no connection with myself or family . YOUR name , sir , ’
91812	91846	91802	91803	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ is Chester , I suppose ? You need n’t pull it off , sir , thank you . I observe E. C. from here . We will take the rest for granted . ’
91847	91853	91855	91856	Mr Chester	228	‘ Pray , Mr Tappertit , ’
91858	91888	91855	91856	Mr Chester	228	‘ has that complicated piece of ironmongery which you have done me the favour to bring with you , any immediate connection with the business we are to discuss ? ’
91889	91896	91898	91900	the ‘ prentice	7550	‘ It has not , sir , ’
91899	91902	91855	91856	Mr Chester	228	‘ prentice . ‘
91918	91919	91855	91856	Mr Chester	228	’ ‘
91928	91933	91855	91856	Mr Chester	228	’ said Mr Chester , ‘
91965	91966	91951	91951	you	228	’ ‘
91973	91985	91951	91951	you	228	’ said Mr Tappertit , suiting the action to the word . ‘
91996	91997	91986	91986	You	228	’ ‘
92017	92103	92011	92011	you	7320	’ During the whole of this dialogue , Mr Chester had suffered nothing but his smile of unvarying serenity and politeness to appear upon his face . Sim Tappertit , who had far too good an opinion of himself to suspect that anybody could be playing upon him , thought within himself that this was something like the respect to which he was entitled , and drew a comparison from this courteous demeanour of a stranger , by no means favourable to the worthy locksmith . ‘
92111	92116	92011	92011	you	7320	’ said Mr Tappertit , ‘
92146	92147	92136	92136	Sir	7320	’ ‘
92151	92156	92157	92157	you	223	’ said the other , ‘
92163	92164	92157	92157	you	223	’ ‘
92170	92173	92168	92168	sir	7320	’ replied the ‘
92176	92178	92182	92182	you	7320	‘ I ’m

92209	92214	92205	92205	he	1394	’ said Mr Chester . ‘
92231	92232	92227	92227	you	223	’ ‘
92249	92254	92227	92227	you	223	’ said Mr Tappertit ; ‘
92331	92332	92333	92334	Mr Tappertit	223	’ ‘
92347	92348	92349	92349	I	0	’ ‘
92359	92366	92349	92349	I	0	’ said Sim , much gratified , ‘
92476	92484	92473	92482	every man of ‘ em in the very fullest uniform	8852	‘ em in the very fullest uniform . ’
92500	92544	92485	92486	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Now , sir , I am a coming to the point . You will inquire of me , “ how is this to be prevented ? ” I ’ll tell you how . If an honest , civil , smiling gentleman like you-- ’
92545	92550	92485	92486	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Mr Tappertit -- really-- ’
92551	92557	92485	92486	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ No , no , I ’m
92560	92563	92485	92486	Mr Tappertit	223	’ rejoined the ‘
92566	92666	92485	92486	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ I am , upon my soul . If an honest , civil , smiling gentleman like you , was to talk but ten minutes to our old woman -- that ’s Mrs Varden -- and flatter her up a bit , you ’d gain her over for ever . Then there ’s this point got -- that her daughter Dolly,’--here a flush came over Mr Tappertit ’s face--‘wouldn’t be allowed to be a go - between from that time forward ; and till that point ’s got , there ’s nothing ever will prevent her . Mind that . ’
92667	92676	92485	92486	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Mr Tappertit , your knowledge of human nature-- ’
92677	92682	92684	92684	Sim	223	‘ Wait a minute , ’
92694	92861	92863	92864	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Now I come to THE point . Sir , there is a villain at that Maypole , a monster in human shape , a vagabond of the deepest dye , that unless you get rid of and have kidnapped and carried off at the very least -- nothing less will do -- will marry your son to that young woman , as certainly and as surely as if he was the Archbishop of Canterbury himself . He will , sir , for the hatred and malice that he bears to you ; let alone the pleasure of doing a bad action , which to him is its own reward . If you knew how this chap , this Joseph Willet -- that ’s his name -- comes backwards and forwards to our house , libelling , and denouncing , and threatening you , and how I shudder when I hear him , you ’d hate him worse than I do,--worse than I do , sir , ’
92882	92890	92879	92879	his	223	‘ if sich a thing is possible . ’
92891	92902	92879	92879	his	223	‘ A little private vengeance in this , Mr Tappertit ? ’
92903	92920	92922	92923	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Private vengeance , sir , or public sentiment , or both combined -- destroy him , ’
92925	92993	92994	92994	em	2347	‘ Miggs says so too . Miggs and me both say so . We ca n’t bear the plotting and undermining that takes place . Our souls recoil from it . Barnaby Rudge and Mrs Rudge are in it likewise ; but the villain , Joseph Willet , is the ringleader . Their plottings and schemes are known to me and Miggs . If you want information of ‘
93017	93092	93093	93094	That fellow	2350	’ With these words , Mr Tappertit , who seemed to expect no reply , and to hold it as a necessary consequence of his eloquence that his hearer should be utterly stunned , dumbfoundered , and overwhelmed , folded his arms so that the palm of each hand rested on the opposite shoulder , and disappeared after the manner of those mysterious warners of whom he had read in cheap story - books . ‘
93096	93110	93093	93094	That fellow	2350	’ said Mr Chester , relaxing his face when he was fairly gone , ‘
93176	94435	93170	93170	I	0	’ With that he fell into a quiet slumber:--subsided into such a gentle , pleasant sleep , that it was quite infantine . Chapter 25 Leaving the favoured , and well - received , and flattered of the world ; him of the world most worldly , who never compromised himself by an ungentlemanly action , and never was guilty of a manly one ; to lie smilingly asleep -- for even sleep , working but little change in his dissembling face , became with him a piece of cold , conventional hypocrisy -- we follow in the steps of two slow travellers on foot , making towards Chigwell . Barnaby and his mother . Grip in their company , of course . The widow , to whom each painful mile seemed longer than the last , toiled wearily along ; while Barnaby , yielding to every inconstant impulse , fluttered here and there , now leaving her far behind , now lingering far behind himself , now darting into some by - lane or path and leaving her to pursue her way alone , until he stealthily emerged again and came upon her with a wild shout of merriment , as his wayward and capricious nature prompted . Now he would call to her from the topmost branch of some high tree by the roadside ; now using his tall staff as a leaping - pole , come flying over ditch or hedge or five - barred gate ; now run with surprising swiftness for a mile or more on the straight road , and halting , sport upon a patch of grass with Grip till she came up . These were his delights ; and when his patient mother heard his merry voice , or looked into his flushed and healthy face , she would not have abated them by one sad word or murmur , though each had been to her a source of suffering in the same degree as it was to him of pleasure . It is something to look upon enjoyment , so that it be free and wild and in the face of nature , though it is but the enjoyment of an idiot . It is something to know that Heaven has left the capacity of gladness in such a creature ’s breast ; it is something to be assured that , however lightly men may crush that faculty in their fellows , the Great Creator of mankind imparts it even to his despised and slighted work . Who would not rather see a poor idiot happy in the sunlight , than a wise man pining in a darkened jail ! Ye men of gloom and austerity , who paint the face of Infinite Benevolence with an eternal frown ; read in the Everlasting Book , wide open to your view , the lesson it would teach . Its pictures are not in black and sombre hues , but bright and glowing tints ; its music -- save when ye drown it -- is not in sighs and groans , but songs and cheerful sounds . Listen to the million voices in the summer air , and find one dismal as your own . Remember , if ye can , the sense of hope and pleasure which every glad return of day awakens in the breast of all your kind who have not changed their nature ; and learn some wisdom even from the witless , when their hearts are lifted up they know not why , by all the mirth and happiness it brings . The widow ’s breast was full of care , was laden heavily with secret dread and sorrow ; but her boy ’s gaiety of heart gladdened her , and beguiled the long journey . Sometimes he would bid her lean upon his arm , and would keep beside her steadily for a short distance ; but it was more his nature to be rambling to and fro , and she better liked to see him free and happy , even than to have him near her , because she loved him better than herself . She had quitted the place to which they were travelling , directly after the event which had changed her whole existence ; and for two - and - twenty years had never had courage to revisit it . It was her native village . How many recollections crowded on her mind when it appeared in sight ! Two - and - twenty years . Her boy ’s whole life and history . The last time she looked back upon those roofs among the trees , she carried him in her arms , an infant . How often since that time had she sat beside him night and day , watching for the dawn of mind that never came ; how had she feared , and doubted , and yet hoped , long after conviction forced itself upon her ! The little stratagems she had devised to try him , the little tokens he had given in his childish way -- not of dulness but of something infinitely worse , so ghastly and unchildlike in its cunning -- came back as vividly as if but yesterday had intervened . The room in which they used to be ; the spot in which his cradle stood ; he , old and elfin - like in face , but ever dear to her , gazing at her with a wild and vacant eye , and crooning some uncouth song as she sat by and rocked him ; every circumstance of his infancy came thronging back , and the most trivial , perhaps , the most distinctly . His older childhood , too ; the strange imaginings he had ; his terror of certain senseless things -- familiar objects he endowed with life ; the slow and gradual breaking out of that one horror , in which , before his birth , his darkened intellect began ; how , in the midst of all , she had found some hope and comfort in his being unlike another child , and had gone on almost believing in the slow development of his mind until he grew a man , and then his childhood was complete and lasting ; one after another , all these old thoughts sprung up within her , strong after their long slumber and bitterer than ever . She took his arm and they hurried through the village street . It was the same as it was wo nt to be in old times , yet different too , and wore another air . The change was in herself , not it ; but she never thought of that , and wondered at its alteration , and where it lay , and what it was . The people all knew Barnaby , and the children of the place came flocking round him -- as she remembered to have done with their fathers and mothers round some silly beggarman , when a child herself . None of them knew her ; they passed each well - remembered house , and yard , and homestead ; and striking into the fields , were soon alone again . The Warren was the end of their journey . Mr Haredale was walking in the garden , and seeing them as they passed the iron gate , unlocked it , and bade them enter that way . ‘
94448	94455	94438	94438	you	2352	’ he said to the widow . ‘
94462	94463	94473	94473	sir	7320	’ ‘
94475	94479	94473	94473	sir	7320	’ she replied . ‘
94491	94492	94473	94473	sir	7320	’ ‘
94497	94498	94473	94473	sir	7320	’ ‘
94502	94513	94473	94473	sir	7320	’ said Mr Haredale , regarding her with some surprise , ‘
94570	94571	94573	94573	Grip	237	’ ‘
94576	94631	94645	94645	he	206	’ said Barnaby , holding the basket open . The raven hopped gravely out , and perching on his shoulder and addressing himself to Mr Haredale , cried -- as a hint , perhaps , that some temperate refreshment would be acceptable--‘Polly put the ket - tle on , we ’ll all have tea ! ’
94632	94638	94645	94645	he	206	‘ Hear me , Mary , ’
94656	94731	94645	94645	he	206	‘ Your life has been an example of patience and fortitude , except in this one particular which has often given me great pain . It is enough to know that you were cruelly involved in the calamity which deprived me of an only brother , and Emma of her father , without being obliged to suppose ( as I sometimes am ) that you associate us with the author of our joint misfortunes . ’
94732	94740	94741	94741	she	2352	‘ Associate you with him , sir ! ’
94744	94747	94749	94750	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Indeed , ’
94752	94796	94749	94750	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I think you do . I almost believe that because your husband was bound by so many ties to our relation , and died in his service and defence , you have come in some sort to connect us with his murder . ’
94797	94800	94801	94801	she	2352	‘ Alas ! ’
94804	94819	94801	94801	she	2352	‘ You little know my heart , sir . You little know the truth ! ’
94820	94842	94844	94845	Mr Haredale	206	‘ It is natural you should do so ; it is very probable you may , without being conscious of it , ’
94854	94906	94907	94907	he	206	‘ We are a fallen house . Money , dispensed with the most lavish hand , would be a poor recompense for sufferings like yours ; and thinly scattered by hands so pinched and tied as ours , it becomes a miserable mockery . I feel it so , God knows , ’
94912	94921	94907	94907	he	206	‘ Why should I wonder if she does ! ’
94922	94933	94934	94934	she	2352	‘ You do me wrong , dear sir , indeed , ’
94940	94955	94934	94934	she	2352	‘ and yet when you come to hear what I desire your leave to say-- ’
94956	94964	94965	94965	he	206	‘ I shall find my doubts confirmed ? ’
94976	94979	94965	94965	he	206	‘ Well ! ’
95000	95017	94982	94982	his	206	‘ And have you come all this way at last , solely to speak to me ? ’
95021	95024	95018	95018	She	2352	‘ Yes . ’
95025	95029	95030	95030	he	206	‘ A curse , ’
95033	95141	95030	95030	he	206	‘ upon the wretched state of us proud beggars , from whom the poor and rich are equally at a distance ; the one being forced to treat us with a show of cold respect ; the other condescending to us in their every deed and word , and keeping more aloof , the nearer they approach us.--Why , if it were pain to you ( as it must have been ) to break for this slight purpose the chain of habit forged through two - and - twenty years , could you not let me know your wish , and beg me to come to you ? ’
95142	95150	95151	95151	she	2352	‘ There was not time , sir , ’
95154	95188	95151	95151	she	2352	‘ I took my resolution but last night , and taking it , felt that I must not lose a day -- a day ! an hour -- in having speech with you . ’
95328	95342	95344	95344	Emma	230	‘ It is the return to this place after so long an absence , ’
95347	95365	95344	95344	Emma	230	‘ Pray ring , dear uncle -- or stay -- Barnaby will run himself and ask for wine-- ’
95366	95372	95373	95373	she	230	‘ Not for the world , ’
95376	95401	95373	95373	she	230	‘ It would have another taste -- I could not touch it . I want but a minute ’s rest . Nothing but that . ’
95703	95708	95710	95711	the widow	7604	‘ I scarcely know , ’
95716	95728	95710	95711	the widow	7604	‘ how to begin . You will think my mind disordered . ’
95729	95745	95747	95748	Mr Haredale	206	‘ The whole tenor of your quiet and reproachless life since you were last here , ’
95752	95818	95747	95748	Mr Haredale	206	‘ shall bear witness for you . Why do you fear to awaken such a suspicion ? You do not speak to strangers . You have not to claim our interest or consideration for the first time . Be more yourself . Take heart . Any advice or assistance that I can give you , you know is yours of right , and freely yours . ’
95819	95827	95828	95828	she	2379	‘ What if I came , sir , ’
95831	95875	95828	95828	she	2379	‘ I who have but one other friend on earth , to reject your aid from this moment , and to say that henceforth I launch myself upon the world , alone and unassisted , to sink or swim as Heaven may decree ! ’
95876	95891	95893	95894	Mr Haredale	206	‘ You would have , if you came to me for such a purpose , ’
95897	95930	95893	95894	Mr Haredale	206	‘ some reason to assign for conduct so extraordinary , which -- if one may entertain the possibility of anything so wild and strange -- would have its weight , of course . ’
95931	95936	95937	95937	she	2379	‘ That , sir , ’
95940	96009	96012	96012	she	2379	‘ is the misery of my distress . I can give no reason whatever . My own bare word is all that I can offer . It is my duty , my imperative and bounden duty . If I did not discharge it , I should be a base and guilty wretch . Having said that , my lips are sealed , and I can say no more . ’
96045	96150	96032	96032	she	2379	‘ Heaven is my witness , as my own heart is -- and yours , dear young lady , will speak for me , I know -- that I have lived , since that time we all have bitter reason to remember , in unchanging devotion , and gratitude to this family . Heaven is my witness that go where I may , I shall preserve those feelings unimpaired . And it is my witness , too , that they alone impel me to the course I must take , and from which nothing now shall turn me , as I hope for mercy . ’
96151	96157	96159	96160	Mr Haredale	206	‘ These are strange riddles , ’
96162	96169	96170	96170	she	2380	‘ In this world , sir , ’
96173	96202	96203	96203	she	2380	‘ they may , perhaps , never be explained . In another , the Truth will be discovered in its own good time . And may that time , ’
96210	96215	96203	96203	she	2380	‘ be far distant ! ’
96216	96222	96224	96225	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Let me be sure , ’
96227	96339	96203	96203	she	2380	‘ that I understand you , for I am doubtful of my own senses . Do you mean that you are resolved voluntarily to deprive yourself of those means of support you have received from us so long -- that you are determined to resign the annuity we settled on you twenty years ago -- to leave house , and home , and goods , and begin life anew -- and this , for some secret reason or monstrous fancy which is incapable of explanation , which only now exists , and has been dormant all this time ? In the name of God , under what delusion are you labouring ? ’
96340	96347	96348	96348	she	2380	‘ As I am deeply thankful , ’
96352	96420	96421	96421	she	2380	‘ for the kindness of those , alive and dead , who have owned this house ; and as I would not have its roof fall down and crush me , or its very walls drip blood , my name being spoken in their hearing ; I never will again subsist upon their bounty , or let it help me to subsistence . You do not know , ’
96426	96450	96421	96421	she	2380	‘ to what uses it may be applied ; into what hands it may pass . I do , and I renounce it . ’
96451	96454	96456	96457	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Surely , ’
96459	96466	96456	96457	Mr Haredale	206	‘ its uses rest with you . ’
96467	96528	96421	96421	she	2380	‘ They did . They rest with me no longer . It may be -- it IS -- devoted to purposes that mock the dead in their graves . It never can prosper with me . It will bring some other heavy judgement on the head of my dear son , whose innocence will suffer for his mother ’s guilt . ’
96529	96535	96537	96538	Mr Haredale	206	‘ What words are these ! ’
96545	96562	96537	96538	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Among what associates have you fallen ? Into what guilt have you ever been betrayed ? ’
96563	96788	96537	96538	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I am guilty , and yet innocent ; wrong , yet right ; good in intention , though constrained to shield and aid the bad . Ask me no more questions , sir ; but believe that I am rather to be pitied than condemned . I must leave my house to - morrow , for while I stay there , it is haunted . My future dwelling , if I am to live in peace , must be a secret . If my poor boy should ever stray this way , do not tempt him to disclose it or have him watched when he returns ; for if we are hunted , we must fly again . And now this load is off my mind , I beseech you -- and you , dear Miss Haredale , too -- to trust me if you can , and think of me kindly as you have been used to do . If I die and can not tell my secret even then ( for that may come to pass ) , it will sit the lighter on my breast in that hour for this day ’s work ; and on that day , and every day until it comes , I will pray for and thank you both , and trouble you no more . ’

97369	97699	97349	97349	his	220	’ but whether he addressed his observations to any supposed person below , or merely threw them off as a general remark , is matter of uncertainty . It was a quiet pretty spot , but a sad one for Barnaby ’s mother ; for Mr Reuben Haredale lay there , and near the vault in which his ashes rested , was a stone to the memory of her own husband , with a brief inscription recording how and when he had lost his life . She sat here , thoughtful and apart , until their time was out , and the distant horn told that the coach was coming . Barnaby , who had been sleeping on the grass , sprung up quickly at the sound ; and Grip , who appeared to understand it equally well , walked into his basket straightway , entreating society in general ( as though he intended a kind of satire upon them in connection with churchyards ) never to say die on any terms . They were soon on the coach - top and rolling along the road . It went round by the Maypole , and stopped at the door . Joe was from home , and Hugh came sluggishly out to hand up the parcel that it called for . There was no fear of old John coming out . They could see him from the coach - roof fast asleep in his cosy bar . It was a part of John ’s character . He made a point of going to sleep at the coach ’s time . He despised gadding about ; he looked upon coaches as things that ought to be indicted ; as disturbers of the peace of mankind ; as restless , bustling , busy , horn - blowing contrivances , quite beneath the dignity of men , and only suited to giddy girls that did nothing but chatter and go a - shopping . ‘
97709	97725	97700	97700	We	2398	’ John would say , if any unlucky stranger made inquiry touching the offensive vehicles ; ‘
97731	97740	97744	97744	they	8992	‘ em ; we ’d rather not ; they ’re
97745	97760	97762	97762	you	2402	’re worth , with their noise and rattle . If you like to wait for ‘
97772	97805	97806	97806	She	2403	‘ em ; they may call and they may not -- there ’s a carrier -- he was looked upon as quite good enough for us , when I was a boy . ’

I have kept the secret till now , and it will go no further than yourself , I know ; but I tell you that with my own eyes -- broad awake -- I saw , in the passage of her house one evening after dark , the highwayman who robbed and wounded Mr Edward Chester , and on the same night threatened me . ’
98203	98213	98215	98216	Mr Haredale	206	‘ And you made no effort to detain him ? ’
98219	98222	98215	98216	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Sir , ’
98227	98252	98224	98225	the locksmith	7447	‘ she herself prevented me -- held me , with all her strength , and hung about me until he had got clear off . ’
98336	98340	98342	98342	Gabriel	242	‘ I forbore , ’
98344	98431	98433	98437	the good - natured locksmith	7590	‘ from repeating one word of this to anybody , as it could do her no good and might do her great harm . I thought and hoped , to say the truth , that she would come to me , and talk to me about it , and tell me how it was ; but though I have purposely put myself in her way more than once or twice , she has never touched upon the subject -- except by a look . And indeed , ’
98439	98510	98433	98437	the good - natured locksmith	7590	‘ there was a good deal in the look , more than could have been put into a great many words . It said among other matters “ Do n’t ask me anything ” so imploringly , that I did n’t ask her anything . You ’ll think me an old fool , I know , sir . If it ’s any relief to call me one , pray do . ’
98511	98522	98524	98525	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I am greatly disturbed by what you tell me , ’
98531	98540	98524	98525	Mr Haredale	206	‘ What meaning do you attach to it ? ’
98558	98566	98568	98569	Mr Haredale	206	‘ She can not have married again , ’
98571	98580	98568	98569	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Not without our knowledge surely , sir . ’
98581	98686	98697	98698	the locksmith	7447	‘ She may have done so , in the fear that it would lead , if known , to some objection or estrangement . Suppose she married incautiously -- it is not improbable , for her existence has been a lonely and monotonous one for many years -- and the man turned out a ruffian , she would be anxious to screen him , and yet would revolt from his crimes . This might be . It bears strongly on the whole drift of her discourse yesterday , and would quite explain her conduct . Do you suppose Barnaby is privy to these circumstances ? ’
98687	98695	98697	98698	the locksmith	7447	‘ Quite impossible to say , sir , ’
98705	98742	98701	98701	his	7447	‘ and next to impossible to find out from him . If what you suppose is really the case , I tremble for the lad -- a notable person , sir , to put to bad uses-- ’
98743	98751	98753	98754	Mr Haredale	206	‘ It is not possible , Varden , ’
98769	98806	98753	98754	Mr Haredale	206	‘ that we have been blinded and deceived by this woman from the beginning ? It is not possible that this connection was formed in her husband ’s lifetime , and led to his and my brother’s-- ’
98807	98813	98815	98815	Gabriel	242	‘ Good God , sir , ’
98820	98878	98753	98754	Mr Haredale	206	‘ do n’t entertain such dark thoughts for a moment . Five - and - twenty years ago , where was there a girl like her ? A gay , handsome , laughing , bright - eyed damsel ! Think what she was , sir . It makes my heart ache now , even now , though I ’m

99034	99041	99043	99044	Mr Haredale	206	’re a good fellow , Varden , ’
99046	99077	99033	99033	You	7320	‘ and are quite right . I have brooded on that subject so long , that every breath of suspicion carries me back to it . You are quite right . ’
99078	99085	99087	99097	the locksmith with brightened eyes , and sturdy , honest voice	2442	‘ It is n’t , sir , ’
99099	99221	99223	99223	Gabriel	242	‘ it is n’t because I courted her before Rudge , and failed , that I say she was too good for him . She would have been as much too good for me . But she WAS too good for him ; he was n’t free and frank enough for her . I do n’t reproach his memory with it , poor fellow ; I only want to put her before you as she really was . For myself , I ’ll keep her old picture in my mind ; and thinking of that , and what has altered her , I ’ll stand her friend , and try to win her back to peace . And damme , sir , ’
99225	99271	99223	99223	Gabriel	242	‘ with your pardon for the word , I ’d do the same if she had married fifty highwaymen in a twelvemonth ; and think it in the Protestant Manual too , though Martha said it was n’t , tooth and nail , till doomsday ! ’
99335	99339	99332	99333	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Well said ! ’
99440	99481	99482	99483	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Haredale , my dear fellow , I am extremely glad to see you . How very much you have improved in your appearance since our last meeting ! I never saw you looking better . HOW do you do ? ’

99534	99599	99531	99531	he	228	‘ There is nobody but a very dilapidated female to perform such offices . You will excuse her infirmities ? If she were in a more elevated station of society , she would be gouty . Being but a hewer of wood and drawer of water , she is rheumatic . My dear Haredale , these are natural class distinctions , depend upon it . ’

99765	99777	99755	99756	Mr Haredale	206	‘ where is the person whom I came here to see ? ’
99778	99783	99784	99784	he	206	‘ My dear friend , ’
99787	99795	99784	99784	he	206	‘ I have not the least idea . ’

99871	99887	99868	99869	Mr Chester	228	‘ you are heated with walking . Sit down , I beg . Our friend is-- ’

100023	100032	100034	100035	Mr Chester	228	‘ The mystery is solved in a moment , ’
100037	100104	100034	100035	Mr Chester	228	‘ in a moment . Will you step aside with me one instant . You remember our little compact in reference to Ned , and your dear niece , Haredale ? You remember the list of assistants in their innocent intrigue ? You remember these two people being among them ? My dear fellow , congratulate yourself , and me . I have bought them off . ’
100105	100111	100113	100114	Mr Haredale	206	‘ You have done what ? ’
100116	100121	100113	100114	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Bought them off , ’
100127	100195	100034	100035	Mr Chester	228	‘ I have found it necessary to take some active steps towards setting this boy and girl attachment quite at rest , and have begun by removing these two agents . You are surprised ? Who CAN withstand the influence of a little money ! They wanted it , and have been bought off . We have nothing more to fear from them . They are gone . ’
100196	100199	100201	100202	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Gone ! ’
100204	100207	100201	100202	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Where ? ’

Between you and me they have their hidden reasons , but upon that point I have pledged myself to secrecy . She appointed to see you here to - night , I know , but found it inconvenient , and could n’t wait . Here is the key of the door . I am afraid you ’ll find it inconveniently large ; but as the tenement is yours , your good - nature will excuse that , Haredale , I am certain ! ’

100507	100517	100501	100502	Mr Haredale	206	‘ and thrive upon the thought . Good night ! ’
100560	100576	100578	100579	the locksmith	7447	‘ Yours , sir , would be too much honour for the like of me , ’
100583	100596	100598	100599	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I wish you to remain here a little while , Varden , ’
100606	100618	100598	100599	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I have a word or two to say to you . ’
100619	100630	100632	100633	Mr Chester	228	‘ I will not intrude upon your conference another moment , ’
100638	100651	100632	100633	Mr Chester	228	‘ May it be satisfactory to you both ! God bless you ! ’

100690	100795	100796	100796	he	206	‘ he is an atrocity that carries its own punishment along with it -- a bear that gnaws himself . And here is one of the inestimable advantages of having a perfect command over one ’s inclinations . I have been tempted in these two short interviews , to draw upon that fellow , fifty times . Five men in six would have yielded to the impulse . By suppressing mine , I wound him deeper and more keenly than if I were the best swordsman in all Europe , and he the worst . You are the wise man ’s very last resource , ’
100806	100859	100796	100796	he	206	‘ we can but appeal to you when all else is said and done . To come to you before , and thereby spare our adversaries so much , is a barbarian mode of warfare , quite unworthy of any man with the remotest pretensions to delicacy of feeling , or refinement . ’

101327	101335	101337	101337	Sim	223	‘ Then come this way , sir , ’

101660	101670	101658	101658	sir	7320	’ returned Mrs V. , blushing with great juvenility . ‘

101730	101929	101930	101930	My	0	’ Dolly showed some reluctance to perform this ceremony , but was sharply reproved by Mrs Varden , who insisted on her undergoing it that minute . For pride , she said with great severity , was one of the seven deadly sins , and humility and lowliness of heart were virtues . Wherefore she desired that Dolly would be kissed immediately , on pain of her just displeasure ; at the same time giving her to understand that whatever she saw her mother do , she might safely do herself , without being at the trouble of any reasoning or reflection on the subject -- which , indeed , was offensive and undutiful , and in direct contravention of the church catechism . Thus admonished , Dolly complied , though by no means willingly ; for there was a broad , bold look of admiration in Mr Chester ’s face , refined and polished though it sought to be , which distressed her very much . As she stood with downcast eyes , not liking to look up and meet his , he gazed upon her with an approving air , and then turned to her mother . ‘

102423	102520	102420	102421	Mr Chester	228	‘ --and the mention of his name reminds me , by the way , that I am about to beg the favour of a minute ’s talk with you alone -- the only thing I object to in it , is , that it DOES partake of insincerity . Now , however I may attempt to disguise the fact from myself in my affection for Ned , still I always revert to this -- that if we are not sincere , we are nothing . Nothing upon earth . Let us be sincere , my dear madam-- ’
102521	102525	102527	102528	Mrs Varden	219	‘ --and Protestant , ’
102530	102610	102527	102528	Mrs Varden	219	‘ --and Protestant above all things . Let us be sincere and Protestant , strictly moral , strictly just ( though always with a leaning towards mercy ) , strictly honest , and strictly true , and we gain -- it is a slight point , certainly , but still it is something tangible ; we throw up a groundwork and foundation , so to speak , of goodness , on which we may afterwards erect some worthy superstructure . ’
102723	103131	103132	103133	Dear madam	9093	‘ I am not proud , I am what you hear , but I consider myself no better than other people ; let us change the subject , pray’--was perfectly genuine and true . He so contrived it , and said it in that way that it appeared to have been forced from him , and its effect was marvellous . Aware of the impression he had made -- few men were quicker than he at such discoveries -- Mr Chester followed up the blow by propounding certain virtuous maxims , somewhat vague and general in their nature , doubtless , and occasionally partaking of the character of truisms , worn a little out at elbow , but delivered in so charming a voice and with such uncommon serenity and peace of mind , that they answered as well as the best . Nor is this to be wondered at ; for as hollow vessels produce a far more musical sound in falling than those which are substantial , so it will oftentimes be found that sentiments which have nothing in them make the loudest ringing in the world , and are the most relished . Mr Chester , with the volume gently extended in one hand , and with the other planted lightly on his breast , talked to them in the most delicious manner possible ; and quite enchanted all his hearers , notwithstanding their conflicting interests and thoughts . Even Dolly , who , between his keen regards and her eyeing over by Mr Tappertit , was put quite out of countenance , could not help owning within herself that he was the sweetest - spoken gentleman she had ever seen . Even Miss Miggs , who was divided between admiration of Mr Chester and a mortal jealousy of her young mistress , had sufficient leisure to be propitiated . Even Mr Tappertit , though occupied as we have seen in gazing at his heart ’s delight , could not wholly divert his thoughts from the voice of the other charmer . Mrs Varden , to her own private thinking , had never been so improved in all her life ; and when Mr Chester , rising and craving permission to speak with her apart , took her by the hand and led her at arm ’s length upstairs to the best sitting - room , she almost deemed him something more than human . ‘
103135	103147	103190	103192	an affectionate parent	2519	’ he said , pressing her hand delicately to his lips ; ‘
103151	103165	103166	103166	You	9093	’ Mrs Varden called up quite a courtly air , and became seated . ‘
103171	103182	103183	103183	You	9093	’ said Mr Chester , drawing a chair towards her . ‘
103199	103200	103196	103197	Mrs Varden	219	’ ‘
103210	103214	103208	103208	sir	7320	’ said Mrs V. ‘
103218	103230	103216	103216	you	9093	’ returned Mr Chester , tapping his snuff - box lid . ‘
103241	103281	103238	103239	Mrs Varden	219	’ Mrs Varden slightly raised her hands , shook her head , and looked at the ground as though she saw straight through the globe , out at the other end , and into the immensity of space beyond . ‘
103288	103293	103238	103239	Mrs Varden	219	’ said Mr Chester , ‘
103385	103393	103380	103380	I	0	’ Mrs Varden stammered that she was sorry-- ‘

103572	103582	103570	103570	Ned	228	’ resumed her tempter with his most winning air , ‘

103726	103762	103763	103763	My	0	’ Mrs Varden looked as wise as if she had really said something to deserve this compliment -- firmly believed she had , in short -- and her faith in her own shrewdness increased considerably . ‘

104119	104128	104116	104116	I	0	’ he answered , shrugging his shoulders meekly , ‘
104193	104203	104204	104204	He	228	’ Mrs Varden was perfectly aghast at the disclosure . ‘

104369	104374	104375	104376	this gentleman	755	’ thought Mrs Varden , ‘

104414	104415	104394	104394	you	0	’ ‘
104420	104430	104394	104394	you	0	’ said Mr Chester , not at all abashed , ‘

104584	104594	104597	104597	he	2581	’ said Mrs Varden , folding her hands loftily . ‘
104599	104604	104597	104597	he	2581	’ cried Mr Chester . ‘
104628	104629	104607	104608	Joseph Willet	197	’ ‘
104637	104644	104634	104634	his	2581	’ interposed Mrs Varden , bridling , ‘

104735	104736	104737	104738	My husband	2587	’ ‘
104740	104749	104737	104738	My husband	2587	’ said Mrs Varden , interposing with emotion , ‘
104795	104796	104776	104776	I	0	’ ‘
104813	104818	104811	104811	yours	2501	’ returned Mr Chester , ‘
104877	105109	105110	105112	this young lady	2562	’ With that he took Mrs Varden ’s hand again , and having pressed it to his lips with the highflown gallantry of the day -- a little burlesqued to render it the more striking in the good lady ’s unaccustomed eyes -- proceeded in the same strain of mingled sophistry , cajolery , and flattery , to entreat that her utmost influence might be exerted to restrain her husband and daughter from any further promotion of Edward ’s suit to Miss Haredale , and from aiding or abetting either party in any way . Mrs Varden was but a woman , and had her share of vanity , obstinacy , and love of power . She entered into a secret treaty of alliance , offensive and defensive , with her insinuating visitor ; and really did believe , as many others would have done who saw and heard him , that in so doing she furthered the ends of truth , justice , and morality , in a very uncommon degree . Overjoyed by the success of his negotiation , and mightily amused within himself , Mr Chester conducted her downstairs in the same state as before ; and having repeated the previous ceremony of salutation , which also as before comprehended Dolly , took his leave ; first completing the conquest of Miss Miggs ’s heart , by inquiring if ‘
105113	105121	105110	105112	this young lady	2562	’ would light him to the door . ‘
105126	105135	105110	105112	this young lady	2562	’ said Miggs , returning with the candle . ‘
105243	105305	105237	105237	I	0	’ Mrs Varden reproved her handmaid for this vain - speaking ; but very gently and mildly -- quite smilingly indeed -- remarking that she was a foolish , giddy , light - headed girl , whose spirits carried her beyond all bounds , and who did n’t mean half she said , or she would be quite angry with her . ‘
105310	105319	105237	105237	I	0	’ said Dolly , in a thoughtful manner , ‘
105356	105357	105345	105345	he	228	’ ‘
105383	105388	105359	105359	you	0	’ said Mrs Varden , ‘
105410	105432	105434	105436	the enraged matron	2606	’m astonished at you . The rudeness of your whole behaviour this evening has been disgraceful . Did anybody ever hear , ’
105442	105457	105434	105436	the enraged matron	2606	‘ of a daughter telling her own mother she has been made game of ! ’
106135	106139	106141	106141	Hugh	198	‘ I thought , ’
106156	106182	106141	106141	Hugh	198	‘ that you were a part of my dream . It was a curious one . I hope it may never come true , master . ’
106183	106189	106141	106141	Hugh	198	‘ What makes you shiver ? ’
106190	106199	106200	106200	he	198	‘ The -- the cold , I suppose , ’
106210	106219	106204	106204	he	198	‘ I hardly know where I am yet . ’
106220	106226	106228	106229	Mr Chester	228	‘ Do you know me ? ’
106231	106238	106239	106239	he	228	‘ Ay , I know you , ’
106242	106262	106263	106263	He	228	‘ I was dreaming of you -- we’re not where I thought we were . That ’s a comfort . ’
106361	106365	106317	106318	Mr Chester	228	‘ Come here , ’
106372	106383	106384	106384	he	228	‘ You have been drinking again , my fine fellow , ’
106402	106405	106384	106384	he	228	‘ As I ’m

106506	106512	106518	106519	young gentleman	2640	’ Hugh obeyed in silence . ‘
106521	106532	106518	106519	young gentleman	2640	’ said Mr Chester , as he put them on , ‘
106584	106603	106614	106614	you	198	’ Hugh obeyed again even more zealously -- and having done so , presented himself before his patron . ‘
106606	106611	106614	106614	you	198	’ said Mr Chester , ‘
106619	106620	106614	106614	you	198	’ ‘

106746	106751	106741	106741	He	1394	’ smiled Mr Chester , ‘

106773	106774	106763	106765	Varden ’s daughter	2656	’ ‘
106786	106793	106798	106798	her	2656	’ said Mr Chester , composedly . ‘

106869	106870	106856	106856	he	2647	’ ‘

106913	106917	106906	106906	you	0	’ retorted Hugh . ‘
106927	106928	106924	106924	I	0	’ ‘
106937	107001	106924	106924	I	0	’ said Mr Chester--‘really if you do not draw some nicer distinctions , your career will be cut short with most surprising suddenness . Do n’t you know that the letter you brought to me , was directed to my son who resides in this very place ? And can you descry no difference between his letters and those addressed to other people ? ’
107002	107010	107012	107012	Hugh	198	‘ If you do n’t want it , ’
107026	107049	107012	107012	Hugh	198	‘ give it me back , and I ’ll deliver it . I do n’t know how to please you , master . ’
107050	107056	107058	107059	his patron	2259	‘ I shall deliver it , ’
107070	107084	107058	107059	his patron	2259	‘ myself . Does the young lady walk out , on fine mornings ? ’
107085	107095	107012	107012	Hugh	198	‘ Mostly -- about noon is her usual time . ’
107096	107099	107058	107059	his patron	2259	‘ Alone ? ’
107100	107105	107058	107059	his patron	2259	‘ Yes , alone . ’
107106	107109	107012	107012	Hugh	198	‘ Where ? ’
107110	107122	107058	107059	his patron	2259	‘ In the grounds before the house.--Them that the footpath crosses . ’
107123	107144	107146	107147	Mr Chester	228	‘ If the weather should be fine , I may throw myself in her way to - morrow , perhaps , ’
107161	107265	107146	107147	Mr Chester	228	‘ Mr Hugh , if I should ride up to the Maypole door , you will do me the favour only to have seen me once . You must suppress your gratitude , and endeavour to forget my forbearance in the matter of the bracelet . It is natural it should break out , and it does you honour ; but when other folks are by , you must , for your own sake and safety , be as like your usual self as though you owed me no obligation whatever , and had never stood within these walls . You comprehend me ? ’
107329	107522	107314	107315	Mr Chester	228	‘ My good fellow , you have my promise , my word , my sealed bond ( for a verbal pledge with me is quite as good ) , that I will always protect you so long as you deserve it . Now , do set your mind at rest . Keep it at ease , I beg of you . When a man puts himself in my power so thoroughly as you have done , I really feel as though he had a kind of claim upon me . I am more disposed to mercy and forbearance under such circumstances than I can tell you , Hugh . Do look upon me as your protector , and rest assured , I entreat you , that on the subject of that indiscretion , you may preserve , as long as you and I are friends , the lightest heart that ever beat within a human breast . Fill that glass once more to cheer you on your road homewards -- I am really quite ashamed to think how far you have to go -- and then God bless you for the night . ’
107523	107527	107529	107529	Hugh	306	‘ They think , ’
107539	107567	107532	107532	he	306	‘ that I am sleeping soundly in the stable . Ha ha ha ! The stable door is shut , but the steed ’s gone , master . ’
107568	107576	107578	107579	his friend	7570	‘ You are a most convivial fellow , ’
107581	107606	107578	107579	his friend	7570	‘ and I love your humour of all things . Good night ! Take the greatest possible care of yourself , for my sake ! ’
107690	107693	107694	107694	he	228	‘ Well ! ’
107778	108139	107774	107774	We	2676	’ He went to bed and fell asleep , but had not slept long when he started up and thought that Hugh was at the outer door , calling in a strange voice , very different from his own , to be admitted . The delusion was so strong upon him , and was so full of that vague terror of the night in which such visions have their being , that he rose , and taking his sheathed sword in his hand , opened the door , and looked out upon the staircase , and towards the spot where Hugh had lain asleep ; and even spoke to him by name . But all was dark and quiet , and creeping back to bed again , he fell , after an hour ’s uneasy watching , into a second sleep , and woke no more till morning . Chapter 29 The thoughts of worldly men are for ever regulated by a moral law of gravitation , which , like the physical one , holds them down to earth . The bright glory of day , and the silent wonders of a starlit night , appeal to their minds in vain . There are no signs in the sun , or in the moon , or in the stars , for their reading . They are like some wise men , who , learning to know each planet by its Latin name , have quite forgotten such small heavenly constellations as Charity , Forbearance , Universal Love , and Mercy , although they shine by night and day so brightly that the blind may see them ; and who , looking upward at the spangled sky , see nothing there but the reflection of their own great wisdom and book - learning . It is curious to imagine these people of the world , busy in thought , turning their eyes towards the countless spheres that shine above us , and making them reflect the only images their minds contain . The man who lives but in the breath of princes , has nothing in his sight but stars for courtiers ’
108148	108645	108648	108648	you	2679	’ honours even in the sky ; to the money - hoarder , and the mass of worldly folk , the whole great universe above glitters with sterling coin -- fresh from the mint -- stamped with the sovereign ’s head -- coming always between them and heaven , turn where they may . So do the shadows of our own desires stand between us and our better angels , and thus their brightness is eclipsed . Everything was fresh and gay , as though the world were but that morning made , when Mr Chester rode at a tranquil pace along the Forest road . Though early in the season , it was warm and genial weather ; the trees were budding into leaf , the hedges and the grass were green , the air was musical with songs of birds , and high above them all the lark poured out her richest melody . In shady spots , the morning dew sparkled on each young leaf and blade of grass ; and where the sun was shining , some diamond drops yet glistened brightly , as in unwillingness to leave so fair a world , and have such brief existence . Even the light wind , whose rustling was as gentle to the ear as softly - falling water , had its hope and promise ; and , leaving a pleasant fragrance in its track as it went fluttering by , whispered of its intercourse with Summer , and of his happy coming . The solitary rider went glancing on among the trees , from sunlight into shade and back again , at the same even pace -- looking about him , certainly , from time to time , but with no greater thought of the day or the scene through which he moved , than that he was fortunate ( being choicely dressed ) to have such favourable weather . He smiled very complacently at such times , but rather as if he were satisfied with himself than with anything else : and so went riding on , upon his chestnut cob , as pleasant to look upon as his own horse , and probably far less sensitive to the many cheerful influences by which he was surrounded . In the course of time , the Maypole ’s massive chimneys rose upon his view : but he quickened not his pace one jot , and with the same cool gravity rode up to the tavern porch . John Willet , who was toasting his red face before a great fire in the bar , and who , with surpassing foresight and quickness of apprehension , had been thinking , as he looked at the blue sky , that if that state of things lasted much longer , it might ultimately become necessary to leave off fires and throw the windows open , issued forth to hold his stirrup ; calling lustily for Hugh . ‘
108649	108657	108659	108659	John	193	’re here , are you , sir ? ’
108671	108712	108659	108659	John	193	‘ Take this here valuable animal into the stable , and have more than particular care of him if you want to keep your place . A mortal lazy fellow , sir ; he needs a deal of looking after . ’
108713	108720	108722	108723	Mr Chester	228	‘ But you have a son , ’
108749	108758	108743	108743	his	228	‘ Why do n’t you make HIM useful ? ’
108759	108768	108770	108770	John	193	‘ Why , the truth is , sir , ’
108775	108783	108770	108770	John	193	‘ that my son -- what , you ’re
108792	108793	108790	108790	villain	1244	’ ‘
108798	108803	108790	108790	villain	1244	’ returned Hugh angrily . ‘
108826	108827	108815	108815	you	228	’ ‘
108839	108844	108815	108815	you	228	’ cried old John , ‘
108873	108915	108916	108916	we	2683	’ added Mr Willet , after an enormously long pause , during which he fixed his great dull eyes on Hugh , and waited with exemplary patience for any little property in the way of ideas that might come to him , ‘
108928	109031	109032	109032	You	228	’ Hugh shrugged his shoulders scornfully , and in his reckless swaggering way , crossed to the other side of the little green , and there , with the bridle slung loosely over his shoulder , led the horse to and fro , glancing at his master every now and then from under his bushy eyebrows , with as sinister an aspect as one would desire to see . Mr Chester , who , without appearing to do so , had eyed him attentively during this brief dispute , stepped into the porch , and turning abruptly to Mr Willet , said , ‘
109039	109040	109034	109035	strange servants	2685	’ ‘

109141	109170	109132	109134	an active fellow	2691	’ said Mr Chester , in a musing tone , which seemed to suggest that he would have said the same had there been nobody to hear him . ‘
109175	109187	109188	109189	that chap	8012	’ retorted John , with quite an expression in his face ; ‘
109219	109228	109229	109229	Hugh	198	’re one of the lively sort or not . ’
109340	109345	109347	109347	John	193	‘ There , sir , ’
109356	109391	109347	109347	John	193	‘ you wo n’t see that at many houses , besides the Maypole , where there ’s good accommodation for man and beast -- nor that neither , though that with him is nothing . ’
109419	109426	109428	109429	Mr Willet	194	‘ That with him is nothing , ’
109466	109555	109574	109574	his	194	‘ he ’ll get out of a’most any winder in the house . There never was such a chap for flinging himself about and never hurting his bones . It ’s my opinion , sir , that it ’s pretty nearly allowing to his not having any imagination ; and that if imagination could be ( which it ca n’t ) knocked into him , he ’d never be able to do it any more . But we was a - talking , sir , about my son . ’
109556	109563	109574	109574	his	194	‘ True , Willet , true , ’
109580	109589	109574	109574	his	194	‘ My good friend , what about him ? ’
109673	109676	109678	109678	John	193	‘ Sir , ’
109683	109765	109678	109678	John	193	‘ I know my duty . We want no love - making here , sir , unbeknown to parents . I respect a certain young gentleman , taking him in the light of a young gentleman ; I respect a certain young lady , taking her in the light of a young lady ; but of the two as a couple , I have no knowledge , sir , none whatever . My son , sir , is upon his patrole . ’
109766	109781	109783	109784	Mr Chester	228	‘ I thought I saw him looking through the corner window but this moment , ’
109799	109807	109809	109809	John	193	‘ No doubt you did , sir , ’
109811	109902	109809	109809	John	193	‘ He is upon his patrole of honour , sir , not to leave the premises . Me and some friends of mine that use the Maypole of an evening , sir , considered what was best to be done with him , to prevent his doing anything unpleasant in opposing your desires ; and we ’ve put him on his patrole . And what ’s more , sir , he wo n’t be off his patrole for a pretty long time to come , I can tell you that . ’
110520	110531	110509	110509	he	228	‘ I beg pardon -- do I address Miss Haredale ? ’
110548	110551	110509	110509	he	228	‘ Yes . ’
110552	110557	110558	110558	he	228	‘ Something told me , ’
110568	110660	110558	110558	he	228	‘ that it could be no other . Miss Haredale , I bear a name which is not unknown to you -- which it is a pride , and yet a pain to me to know , sounds pleasantly in your ears . I am a man advanced in life , as you see . I am the father of him whom you honour and distinguish above all other men . May I for weighty reasons which fill me with distress , beg but a minute ’s conversation with you here ? ’
110728	110756	110757	110757	She	2716	‘ A little more apart -- among these trees . It is an old man ’s hand , Miss Haredale ; an honest one , believe me . ’
110779	110786	110787	110787	she	2716	‘ You alarm me , sir , ’
110794	110808	110787	110787	she	2716	‘ You are not the bearer of any ill news , I hope ? ’

110825	110852	110817	110817	he	7395	‘ Edward is well -- quite well . It is of him I wish to speak , certainly ; but I have no misfortune to communicate . ’
110875	110935	110855	110855	her	2716	‘ I am sensible that I speak to you at a disadvantage , dear Miss Haredale . Believe me that I am not so forgetful of the feelings of my younger days as not to know that you are little disposed to view me with favour . You have heard me described as cold - hearted , calculating , selfish-- ’
110936	110952	110953	110953	I	0	‘ I have never , sir,’--she interposed with an altered manner and a firmer voice ; ‘
110987	110988	110976	110976	you	7395	’ ‘
111000	111001	110998	110999	your uncle--	2723	’ ‘
111011	111023	111005	111006	my uncle	2724	’ she replied , with a heightened colour in her cheek . ‘

111100	111113	111038	111038	mine	0	’ said Mr Chester , looking upward , and apostrophising the air ; ‘
111141	111192	111193	111193	I	0	’ She turned towards him quickly , and with a scornful look and flashing eyes . There were tears in Mr Chester ’s eyes , but he dashed them hurriedly away , as though unwilling that his weakness should be known , and regarded her with mingled admiration and compassion . ‘
111198	111202	111193	111193	I	0	’ he said , ‘
111321	111416	111417	111417	I	0	’ Oh ! If Mrs Varden could have seen the virtuous gentleman as he said these words , with indignation sparkling from his eyes -- if she could have heard his broken , quavering voice -- if she could have beheld him as he stood bareheaded in the sunlight , and with unwonted energy poured forth his eloquence ! With a haughty face , but pale and trembling too , Emma regarded him in silence . She neither spoke nor moved , but gazed upon him as though she would look into his heart . ‘
111421	111426	111417	111417	I	0	’ said Mr Chester , ‘
111469	111484	111465	111467	my unworthy son	2734	’ Still she looked at him steadily , and still said not one word . ‘

111587	111591	111592	111592	You	199	’ she faltered . ‘

111618	111625	111631	111631	your	199	’ said Mr Chester , soothingly , ‘
111690	111700	111687	111688	Miss Haredale	199	’ said the good gentleman , with great emotion , ‘
111734	111793	111794	111794	I	0	’ There appeared something so very candid , so scrupulously honourable , so very truthful and just in this course -- something which rendered the upright person who resorted to it , so worthy of belief -- that Emma ’s heart , for the first time , sunk within her . She turned away and burst into tears . ‘
111797	111815	111816	111816	I	0	’ said Mr Chester , leaning over her , and speaking in mild and quite venerable accents ; ‘
111917	111918	111913	111913	I	0	’ ‘
111926	111930	111919	111919	You	0	’ she answered , ‘

111951	111963	111919	111919	You	0	’ said Mr Chester , bending over her more affectionately still ; ‘
112206	112228	112231	112231	you	7914	’ She glanced proudly at him once more , as by an involuntary impulse , and with a swelling breast rejoined , ‘
112264	112265	112259	112259	I	0	’ ‘
112278	112282	112270	112270	I	0	’ he replied , ‘
112334	112407	112327	112327	I	0	’ At these words the young lady raised her eyes , which were filled with tears ; and seeing that her uncle indeed stood before them , and being quite unequal to the trial of hearing or of speaking one word more , hurriedly withdrew , and left them . They stood looking at each other , and at her retreating figure , and for a long time neither of them spoke . ‘
112416	112423	112327	112327	I	0	’ said Mr Haredale at length . ‘

112440	112464	112465	112465	you	2741	’ rejoined the other , resuming his accustomed manner with infinite readiness , and throwing himself upon the bench with a weary air , ‘
112597	112609	112610	112610	You	2741	’ Mr Haredale surveyed him with a look of cold contempt . ‘
112619	112627	112610	112610	You	2741	’ he said , folding his arms . ‘
112638	112639	112634	112634	I	0	’ ‘
112659	112671	112652	112652	You	2741	’ returned his friend , as he lazily crossed his legs . ‘
112896	112897	112888	112888	I	0	’ ‘
112915	112920	112898	112898	I	0	’ returned the other . ‘
112977	112978	112979	112979	You	2741	’ ‘
112984	112993	112979	112979	You	2741	’ said Mr Chester with a languid smile . ‘
113005	113109	113110	113111	Mr Chester	228	‘ Death , Chester , if your blood ran warmer in your veins , and there were no restraints upon me , such as those that hold and drag me back -- well ; it is done ; you tell me so , and on such a point I may believe you . When I am most remorseful for this treachery , I will think of you and your marriage , and try to justify myself in such remembrances , for having torn asunder Emma and your son , at any cost . Our bond is cancelled now , and we may part . ’
113165	113174	113175	113175	he	228	‘ My scapegoat and my drudge at school , ’
113186	113251	113175	113175	he	228	‘ my friend of later days , who could not keep his mistress when he had won her , and threw me in her way to carry off the prize ; I triumph in the present and the past . Bark on , ill - favoured , ill - conditioned cur ; fortune has ever been with me -- I like to hear you . ’
113326	113339	113341	113342	Mr Chester	228	‘ It MAY come to that one day , but not yet , ’
113361	113405	113345	113345	his	228	‘ Not yet , Haredale . Life is pleasant enough to me ; dull and full of heaviness to you . No . To cross swords with such a man -- to indulge his humour unless upon extremity -- would be weak indeed . ’
114272	114279	114281	114281	John	193	‘ None of that , sir , ’
114283	114310	114281	114281	John	193	‘ none of that , sir . No breaking of patroles . How dare you come out of the door , sir , without leave ? You ’re

114345	114371	114343	114343	father	7315	’ said Joe , imploringly , as he marked the smile upon their visitor ’s face , and observed the pleasure his disgrace afforded him . ‘
114383	114384	114332	114332	you	197	’ ‘
114391	114398	114332	114332	you	197	’ cried John , shaking him . ‘

114439	114469	114417	114417	John	193	‘ that wants to sneak into houses , and stir up differences between noble gentlemen and their sons , are you , eh ? Hold your tongue , sir . ’
114510	114515	114520	114520	he	197	‘ But for her , ’
114539	114576	114520	114520	he	197	‘ but for Dolly , who I could n’t bear should think me the rascal they would make me out to be if I ran away , this house and I should part to - night . ’
114642	114649	114651	114651	John	193	‘ We ’ll see , gentlemen , ’
114658	114689	114651	114651	John	193	‘ who ’s the master of this house , and who is n’t . We ’ll see whether boys are to govern men , or men are to govern boys . ’
114690	114696	114698	114699	Solomon Daisy	205	‘ And quite right too , ’
114705	114726	114698	114699	Solomon Daisy	205	‘ quite right , Johnny . Very good , Johnny . Well said , Mr Willet . Brayvo , sir . ’
114758	114804	114727	114727	John	193	‘ When I want encouragement from you , sir , I ’ll ask you for it . You let me alone , sir . I can get on without you , I hope . Do n’t you tackle me , sir , if you please . ’
114805	114821	114823	114825	the little man	7269	‘ Do n’t take it ill , Johnny ; I did n’t mean any harm , ’
114827	114833	114835	114835	John	193	‘ Very good , sir , ’
114846	114872	114835	114835	John	193	‘ Never mind , sir . I can stand pretty firm of myself , sir , I believe , without being shored up by you . ’
115010	115019	115021	115021	Joe	197	‘ I ’d recommend you , in return , ’
115030	115037	115021	115021	Joe	197	‘ not to talk to me . ’
115038	115045	115047	115048	Mr Willet	194	‘ Hold your tongue , sir , ’
115058	115065	115067	115067	Joe	197	‘ I wo n’t , father , ’
115085	115120	115073	115073	his	197	‘ these things are hard enough to bear from you ; from anybody else I never will endure them any more . Therefore I say , Mr Cobb , do n’t talk to me . ’
115121	115128	115130	115131	Mr Cobb	308	‘ Why , who are you , ’
115135	115138	115130	115131	Mr Cobb	308	‘ that you ’re
115149	115345	115147	115147	Joe	197	’ To which Joe returned no answer , but with a very ominous shake of the head , resumed his old position , which he would have peacefully preserved until the house shut up at night , but that Mr Cobb , stimulated by the wonder of the company at the young man ’s presumption , retorted with sundry taunts , which proved too much for flesh and blood to bear . Crowding into one moment the vexation and the wrath of years , Joe started up , overturned the table , fell upon his long enemy , pummelled him with all his might and main , and finished by driving him with surprising swiftness against a heap of spittoons in one corner ; plunging into which , head foremost , with a tremendous crash , he lay at full length among the ruins , stunned and motionless . Then , without waiting to receive the compliments of the bystanders on the victory he had won , he retreated to his own bedchamber , and considering himself in a state of siege , piled all the portable furniture against the door by way of barricade . ‘
115352	115369	115346	115346	I	0	’ said Joe , as he sat down upon his bedstead and wiped his heated face . ‘

116614	116625	116627	116627	Joe	197	‘ What noisy fellow is that in the next room ? ’
116644	116649	116651	116652	the Lion	2853	‘ A recruiting serjeant , ’
116674	116679	116681	116682	the Lion	2853	‘ And I wish , ’
116684	116724	116725	116725	em	2869	‘ he was anywhere else but here . The party make noise enough , but do n’t call for much . There ’s great cry there , Mr Willet , but very little wool . Your father would n’t like ‘
116730	116763	116681	116682	the Lion	2853	’ Perhaps not much under any circumstances . Perhaps if he could have known what was passing at that moment in Joe ’s mind , he would have liked them still less . ‘
116775	116791	116794	116794	he	2870	’ said Joe , glancing at a little round mirror that hung in the bar . ‘
116797	116802	116792	116792	I	0	’ replied the host . ‘
116818	116836	116817	116817	I	0	’m told there an’t a deal of difference between a fine man and another one , when they ’re

116862	116884	116858	116859	the Lion	2853	‘ not all . Those that are -- supposing it ’s done easy -- are the best off in my opinion . ’
116885	116888	116890	116890	Joe	197	‘ Ah ! ’
116892	116901	116890	116890	Joe	197	‘ but you do n’t care for glory . ’
116902	116906	116908	116909	the Lion	310	‘ For what ? ’
116911	116914	116908	116909	the Lion	310	‘ Glory . ’

116989	117065	116977	116978	the Glory	311	’ These remarks were not at all comforting . Joe walked out , stopped at the door of the next room , and listened . The serjeant was describing a military life . It was all drinking , he said , except that there were frequent intervals of eating and love - making . A battle was the finest thing in the world -- when your side won it -- and Englishmen always did that . ‘
117074	117083	117072	117072	sir	7320	’ said a timid voice in one corner . ‘
117093	117098	117072	117072	sir	7320	’ said the serjeant , ‘
117170	117262	117263	117263	I	0	’ The voice coughed , and said no more . Joe walked into the room . A group of half - a - dozen fellows had gathered together in the taproom , and were listening with greedy ears . One of them , a carter in a smockfrock , seemed wavering and disposed to enlist . The rest , who were by no means disposed , strongly urged him to do so ( according to the custom of mankind ) , backed the serjeant ’s arguments , and grinned among themselves . ‘
117269	117284	117263	117263	I	0	’ said the serjeant , who sat a little apart , drinking his liquor . ‘
117351	117418	117419	117419	You	2893	’m not a - going to tell tales out of school , but , damme , if every gentleman ’s son that carries arms in our corps , through being under a cloud and having little differences with his relations , was counted up’--here his eye fell on Joe again , and so good - naturedly , that Joe beckoned him out . He came directly . ‘

117487	117493	117494	117494	You	2893	’ said his new friend . ‘
117504	117518	117503	117503	You	2893	’re one of us by nature . What ’ll you take to drink ? ’
117519	117524	117526	117526	Joe	197	‘ Nothing just now , ’
117531	117541	117526	117526	Joe	197	‘ I have n’t quite made up my mind . ’
117542	117556	117558	117559	the serjeant	9293	‘ A mettlesome fellow like you , and not made up his mind ! ’
117561	117587	117558	117559	the serjeant	9293	‘ Here -- let me give the bell a pull , and you ’ll make up your mind in half a minute , I know . ’

117640	117648	117633	117633	you	2896	’ replied the serjeant with an oath , ‘
117669	117679	117686	117686	Joe	197	’ he used an adjective in this place--‘eyes on . ’
117680	117684	117686	117686	Joe	197	‘ Thank you , ’
117688	117718	117686	117686	Joe	197	‘ I did n’t ask you for want of a compliment , but thank you all the same . Do I look like a sneaking fellow or a liar ? ’
117774	117836	117766	117766	Joe	197	‘ You can trust me then , and credit what I say . I believe I shall enlist in your regiment to - night . The reason I do n’t do so now is , because I do n’t want until to - night , to do what I ca n’t recall . Where shall I find you , this evening ? ’
117891	117918	117920	117920	Joe	197	‘ And if I do come -- which it ’s a million to one , I shall -- when will you take me out of London ? ’
117922	117934	117936	117937	the serjeant	9293	‘ To - morrow morning , at half after eight o’clock , ’
117939	117962	117936	117937	the serjeant	9293	‘ You ’ll go abroad -- a country where it ’s all sunshine and plunder -- the finest climate in the world . ’
117963	117968	117970	117970	Joe	197	‘ To go abroad , ’
117977	117990	117970	117970	Joe	197	‘ is the very thing I want . You may expect me . ’
117991	117993	117936	117937	the serjeant	9293	‘ You ’re
118001	118020	118021	118021	You	197	’ cried the serjeant , holding Joe ’s hand in his , in the excess of his admiration . ‘
118022	118077	117970	117970	Joe	197	’re the boy to push your fortune . I do n’t say it because I bear you any envy , or would take away from the credit of the rise you ’ll make , but if I had been bred and taught like you , I ’d have been a colonel by this time . ’
118078	118083	118085	118085	Joe	197	‘ Tush , man ! ’
118087	118089	118085	118085	Joe	197	‘ I ’m
118126	118127	117970	117970	Joe	197	’ ‘
118133	118142	117970	117970	Joe	197	’ cried the serjeant , flourishing his cap . ‘
118148	118726	117970	117970	Joe	197	’ cried Joe , snapping his fingers . And so they parted . He had very little money in his pocket ; so little indeed , that after paying for his breakfast ( which he was too honest and perhaps too proud to score up to his father ’s charge ) he had but a penny left . He had courage , notwithstanding , to resist all the affectionate importunities of the serjeant , who waylaid him at the door with many protestations of eternal friendship , and did in particular request that he would do him the favour to accept of only one shilling as a temporary accommodation . Rejecting his offers both of cash and credit , Joe walked away with stick and bundle as before , bent upon getting through the day as he best could , and going down to the locksmith ’s in the dusk of the evening ; for it should go hard , he had resolved , but he would have a parting word with charming Dolly Varden . He went out by Islington and so on to Highgate , and sat on many stones and gates , but there were no voices in the bells to bid him turn . Since the time of noble Whittington , fair flower of merchants , bells have come to have less sympathy with humankind . They only ring for money and on state occasions . Wanderers have increased in number ; ships leave the Thames for distant regions , carrying from stem to stern no other cargo ; the bells are silent ; they ring out no entreaties or regrets ; they are used to it and have grown worldly . Joe bought a roll , and reduced his purse to the condition ( with a difference ) of that celebrated purse of Fortunatus , which , whatever were its favoured owner ’s necessities , had one unvarying amount in it . In these real times , when all the Fairies are dead and buried , there are still a great many purses which possess that quality . The sum - total they contain is expressed in arithmetic by a circle , and whether it be added to or multiplied by its own amount , the result of the problem is more easily stated than any known in figures . Evening drew on at last . With the desolate and solitary feeling of one who had no home or shelter , and was alone utterly in the world for the first time , he bent his steps towards the locksmith ’s house . He had delayed till now , knowing that Mrs Varden sometimes went out alone , or with Miggs for her sole attendant , to lectures in the evening ; and devoutly hoping that this might be one of her nights of moral culture . He had walked up and down before the house , on the opposite side of the way , two or three times , when as he returned to it again , he caught a glimpse of a fluttering skirt at the door . It was Dolly’s -- to whom else could it belong ? no dress but hers had such a flow as that . He plucked up his spirits , and followed it into the workshop of the Golden Key . His darkening the door caused her to look round . Oh that face ! ‘
118735	118739	118740	118740	I	0	’ thought Joe , ‘
118764	118917	118918	118918	I	0	’ He did n’t say this . He only thought it -- perhaps looked it also . Dolly was glad to see him , and was SO sorry her father and mother were away from home . Joe begged she would n’t mention it on any account . Dolly hesitated to lead the way into the parlour , for there it was nearly dark ; at the same time she hesitated to stand talking in the workshop , which was yet light and open to the street . They had got by some means , too , before the little forge ; and Joe having her hand in his ( which he had no right to have , for Dolly only gave it him to shake ) , it was so like standing before some homely altar being married , that it was the most embarrassing state of things in the world . ‘
118922	118926	118918	118918	I	0	’ said Joe , ‘
118956	119058	118951	118951	I	0	’ Now this was exactly what he should not have said . Here he was , talking like a gentleman at large who was free to come and go and roam about the world at pleasure , when that gallant coachmaker had vowed but the night before that Miss Varden held him bound in adamantine chains ; and had positively stated in so many words that she was killing him by inches , and that in a fortnight more or thereabouts he expected to make a decent end and leave the business to his mother . Dolly released her hand and said ‘
119061	119088	119089	119089	I	0	’ She remarked in the same breath that it was a fine night , and in short , betrayed no more emotion than the forge itself . ‘
119094	119098	119089	119089	I	0	’ said Joe , ‘
119112	119158	119105	119105	I	0	’ Dolly was more sorry than she could tell , that he should have taken so much trouble . It was such a long way , and he must have such a deal to do . And how WAS Mr Willet -- that dear old gentleman-- ‘
119165	119299	119162	119162	you	2915	’ cried Joe . All ! Good gracious , what did the man expect ! She was obliged to take her apron in her hand and run her eyes along the hem from corner to corner , to keep herself from laughing in his face;--not because his gaze confused her -- not at all . Joe had small experience in love affairs , and had no notion how different young ladies are at different times ; he had expected to take Dolly up again at the very point where he had left her after that delicious evening ride , and was no more prepared for such an alteration than to see the sun and moon change places . He had buoyed himself up all day with an indistinct idea that she would certainly say ‘
119304	119306	119162	119162	you	2915	’ or ‘
119312	119314	119162	119162	you	2915	’ or ‘
119320	119322	119317	119317	you	2917	’ or ‘
119329	119449	119325	119325	you	2917	’ or would give him some little encouragement of that sort ; he had even entertained the possibility of her bursting into tears , of her throwing herself into his arms , of her falling down in a fainting fit without previous word or sign ; but any approach to such a line of conduct as this , had been so far from his thoughts that he could only look at her in silent wonder . Dolly in the meanwhile , turned to the corners of her apron , and measured the sides , and smoothed out the wrinkles , and was as silent as he . At last after a long pause , Joe said good - bye . ‘
119477	119482	119462	119462	he	2917	‘ good - bye . ’
119483	119486	119488	119488	Joe	197	‘ Come , ’
119495	119674	119488	119488	Joe	197	‘ Dolly , dear Dolly , do n’t let us part like this . I love you dearly , with all my heart and soul ; with as much truth and earnestness as ever man loved woman in this world , I do believe . I am a poor fellow , as you know -- poorer now than ever , for I have fled from home , not being able to bear it any longer , and must fight my own way without help . You are beautiful , admired , are loved by everybody , are well off and happy ; and may you ever be so ! Heaven forbid I should ever make you otherwise ; but give me a word of comfort . Say something kind to me . I have no right to expect it of you , I know , but I ask it because I love you , and shall treasure the slightest word from you all through my life . Dolly , dearest , have you nothing to say to me ? ’
119779	119787	119789	119789	Dolly	216	‘ I have said good - bye , ’
119791	119809	119789	119789	Dolly	216	‘ twice . Take your arm away directly , Mr Joseph , or I ’ll call Miggs . ’
119810	119817	119819	119819	Joe	197	‘ I ’ll not reproach you , ’
119821	119873	119819	119819	Joe	197	‘ it ’s my fault , no doubt . I have thought sometimes that you did n’t quite despise me , but I was a fool to think so . Every one must , who has seen the life I have led -- you most of all . God bless you ! ’
120106	120113	120115	120117	the ‘ prentice	7550	‘ Have my ears deceived me , ’
120116	120119	120115	120117	the ‘ prentice	7550	‘ prentice , ‘

120180	120183	120142	120142	He	0	‘ If they ’re

121015	121020	121022	121023	Mr Chester	228	‘ My dear Edward , ’
121033	121057	121022	121023	Mr Chester	228	‘ do not extend your drowsy influence to the decanter . Suffer THAT to circulate , let your spirits be never so stagnant . ’
121073	121083	121085	121086	Mr Chester	228	‘ You do wrong not to fill your glass , ’
121096	121144	121085	121086	Mr Chester	228	‘ Wine in moderation -- not in excess , for that makes men ugly -- has a thousand pleasant influences . It brightens the eye , improves the voice , imparts a new vivacity to one ’s thoughts and conversation : you should try it , Ned . ’
121145	121149	121151	121152	his son	7374	‘ Ah father ! ’
121154	121156	121151	121152	his son	7374	‘ if-- ’
121157	121162	121169	121169	he	2963	‘ My good fellow , ’
121186	121243	121169	121169	he	2963	‘ for Heaven ’s sake do n’t call me by that obsolete and ancient name . Have some regard for delicacy . Am I grey , or wrinkled , do I go on crutches , have I lost my teeth , that you adopt such a mode of address ? Good God , how very coarse ! ’
121244	121258	121151	121152	his son	7374	‘ I was about to speak to you from my heart , sir , ’
121262	121280	121260	121260	Edward	228	‘ in the confidence which should subsist between us ; and you check me in the outset . ’
121281	121290	121292	121293	Mr Chester	228	‘ Now DO , Ned , DO not , ’
121301	121400	121292	121293	Mr Chester	228	‘ talk in that monstrous manner . About to speak from your heart . Do n’t you know that the heart is an ingenious part of our formation -- the centre of the blood - vessels and all that sort of thing -- which has no more to do with what you say or think , than your knees have ? How can you be so very vulgar and absurd ? These anatomical allusions should be left to gentlemen of the medical profession . They are really not agreeable in society . You quite surprise me , Ned . ’
121401	121433	121435	121436	his son	7374	‘ Well ! there are no such things to wound , or heal , or have regard for . I know your creed , sir , and will say no more , ’
121438	121442	121444	121445	Mr Chester	228	‘ There again , ’
121451	121566	121444	121445	Mr Chester	228	‘ you are wrong . I distinctly say there are such things . We know there are . The hearts of animals -- of bullocks , sheep , and so forth -- are cooked and devoured , as I am told , by the lower classes , with a vast deal of relish . Men are sometimes stabbed to the heart , shot to the heart ; but as to speaking from the heart , or to the heart , or being warm - hearted , or cold - hearted , or broken - hearted , or being all heart , or having no heart -- pah ! these things are nonsense , Ned . ’
121567	121573	121575	121576	his son	7374	‘ No doubt , sir , ’
121587	121591	121580	121580	he	228	‘ No doubt . ’
121592	121603	121605	121606	Mr Chester	228	‘ There ’s Haredale ’s niece , your late flame , ’
121616	121646	121605	121606	Mr Chester	228	‘ No doubt in your mind she was all heart once . Now she has none at all . Yet she is the same person , Ned , exactly . ’
121647	121656	121658	121658	Edward	228	‘ She is a changed person , sir , ’
121662	121672	121658	121658	Edward	228	‘ and changed by vile means , I believe . ’
121673	121684	121686	121687	his father	470	‘ You have had a cool dismissal , have you ? ’
121689	121708	121686	121687	his father	470	‘ Poor Ned ! I told you last night what would happen.--May I ask you for the nutcrackers ? ’
121709	121721	121723	121723	Edward	228	‘ She has been tampered with , and most treacherously deceived , ’
121730	121825	121723	121723	Edward	228	‘ I never will believe that the knowledge of my real position , given her by myself , has worked this change . I know she is beset and tortured . But though our contract is at an end , and broken past all redemption ; though I charge upon her want of firmness and want of truth , both to herself and me ; I do not now , and never will believe , that any sordid motive , or her own unbiassed will , has led her to this course -- never ! ’
121826	121832	121834	121835	his father	470	‘ You make me blush , ’
121838	122037	121834	121835	his father	470	‘ for the folly of your nature , in which -- but we never know ourselves -- I devoutly hope there is no reflection of my own . With regard to the young lady herself , she has done what is very natural and proper , my dear fellow ; what you yourself proposed , as I learn from Haredale ; and what I predicted -- with no great exercise of sagacity -- she would do . She supposed you to be rich , or at least quite rich enough ; and found you poor . Marriage is a civil contract ; people marry to better their worldly condition and improve appearances ; it is an affair of house and furniture , of liveries , servants , equipage , and so forth . The lady being poor and you poor also , there is an end of the matter . You can not enter upon these considerations , and have no manner of business with the ceremony . I drink her health in this glass , and respect and honour her for her extreme good sense . It is a lesson to you . Fill yours , Ned . ’
122038	122044	122046	122047	his son	7374	‘ It is a lesson , ’
122049	122067	122046	122047	his son	7374	‘ by which I hope I may never profit , and if years and experience impress it on-- ’
122068	122076	122078	122079	his father	470	‘ Do n’t say on the heart , ’
122081	122093	122095	122095	Edward	228	‘ On men whom the world and its hypocrisy have spoiled , ’
122098	122106	122095	122095	Edward	228	‘ Heaven keep me from its knowledge . ’
122107	122112	122118	122118	himself	470	‘ Come , sir , ’
122131	122184	122118	122118	himself	470	‘ we have had enough of this . Remember , if you please , your interest , your duty , your moral obligations , your filial affections , and all that sort of thing , which it is so very delightful and charming to reflect upon ; or you will repent it . ’
122185	122200	122202	122202	Edward	228	‘ I shall never repent the preservation of my self - respect , sir , ’
122204	122250	122202	122202	Edward	228	‘ Forgive me if I say that I will not sacrifice it at your bidding , and that I will not pursue the track which you would have me take , and to which the secret share you have had in this late separation tends . ’
122293	122407	122251	122252	His father	470	‘ Edward , my father had a son , who being a fool like you , and , like you , entertaining low and disobedient sentiments , he disinherited and cursed one morning after breakfast . The circumstance occurs to me with a singular clearness of recollection this evening . I remember eating muffins at the time , with marmalade . He led a miserable life ( the son , I mean ) and died early ; it was a happy release on all accounts ; he degraded the family very much . It is a sad circumstance , Edward , when a father finds it necessary to resort to such strong measures . ‘
122411	122415	122251	122252	His father	470	’ replied Edward , ‘
122452	122464	122449	122450	Dear father	2975	’ he added , more earnestly though in a gentler tone , ‘

122828	122881	122896	122896	your	7320	’ Edward left the room without another word or look , and turned his back upon the house for ever . The father ’s face was slightly flushed and heated , but his manner was quite unchanged , as he rang the bell again , and addressed the servant on his entrance . ‘

125677	125687	125689	125689	John	193	‘ Tell us what ’s the matter , sir , ’

125945	125950	125952	125952	Solomon	205	‘ Oh , Johnny , ’
125960	125999	125952	125952	Solomon	205	‘ Oh , Parkes . Oh , Tommy Cobb . Why did I leave this house to - night ! On the nineteenth of March -- of all nights in the year , on the nineteenth of March ! ’
126044	126049	126053	126053	his	194	‘ God forgive me , ’
126063	126072	126074	126075	Solomon Daisy	205	‘ When I left here to - night , ’
126077	126152	126074	126075	Solomon Daisy	205	‘ I little thought what day of the month it was . I have never gone alone into the church after dark on this day , for seven - and - twenty years . I have heard it said that as we keep our birthdays when we are alive , so the ghosts of dead people , who are not easy in their graves , keep the day they died upon.--How the wind roars ! ’
126163	126169	126170	126170	he	205	‘ I might have known , ’
126173	126213	126170	126170	he	205	‘ what night it was , by the foul weather . There ’s no such night in the whole year round as this is , always . I never sleep quietly in my bed on the nineteenth of March . ’
126214	126218	126220	126221	Tom Cobb	195	‘ Go on , ’
126228	126233	126220	126221	Tom Cobb	195	‘ Nor I neither . ’
126269	126354	126234	126235	Solomon Daisy	205	‘ Have I ever said that we are always brought back to this subject in some strange way , when the nineteenth of this month comes round ? Do you suppose it was by accident , I forgot to wind up the church - clock ? I never forgot it at any other time , though it ’s such a clumsy thing that it has to be wound up every day . Why should it escape my memory on this day of all others ? ‘
126475	126587	126467	126467	you	3078	‘ The wind was so strong , that it was as much as I could do to shut the church - door by putting my whole weight against it ; and even as it was , it burst wide open twice , with such strength that any of you would have sworn , if you had been leaning against it , as I was , that somebody was pushing on the other side . However , I got the key turned , went into the belfry , and wound up the clock -- which was very near run down , and would have stood stock - still in half an hour . ‘
126657	126814	126643	126643	I	0	’ Here old John precipitately interrupted the speaker , and begged that if Mr Parkes ( who was seated opposite to him and was staring directly over his head ) saw anything , he would have the goodness to mention it . Mr Parkes apologised , and remarked that he was only listening ; to which Mr Willet angrily retorted , that his listening with that kind of expression in his face was not agreeable , and that if he could n’t look like other people , he had better put his pocket - handkerchief over his head . Mr Parkes with great submission pledged himself to do so , if again required , and John Willet turning to Solomon desired him to proceed . After waiting until a violent gust of wind and rain , which seemed to shake even that sturdy house to its foundation , had passed away , the little man complied : ‘
126894	126895	126889	126889	I	0	’ ‘
126901	126906	126907	126907	I	0	’ asked Tom Cobb . ‘
126965	126966	126967	126967	I	0	’ ‘
126975	126995	126967	126967	I	0	’ said John , drawing a long breath , and looking round him like a man who felt relieved . ‘
126999	127004	126967	126967	I	0	’ returned his friend , ‘
127011	127012	127016	127016	you	0	’ ‘
127027	127043	127016	127016	you	0	’ asked John , pausing in the act of wiping his face upon his apron . ‘
127056	127057	127046	127046	you	0	’ ‘
127062	127063	127059	127059	I	0	’ ‘
127066	127074	127059	127059	I	0	’ echoed all three , bending forward . ‘
127086	127108	127110	127110	I	0	’ said the little man , with an expression of face which bore ample testimony to the sincerity of his conviction , ‘
127199	127200	127177	127177	It	3090	’ ‘
127203	127261	127177	127177	It	3090	’ they all three cried together . In the excess of his emotion ( for he fell back trembling in his chair , and waved his hand as if entreating them to question him no further ) , his answer was lost on all but old John Willet , who happened to be seated close beside him . ‘
127264	127283	127177	127177	It	3090	’ cried Parkes and Tom Cobb , looking eagerly by turns at Solomon Daisy and at Mr Willet . ‘
127288	127289	127290	127290	Gentlemen	1335	’ ‘
127292	127301	127290	127290	Gentlemen	1335	’ said Mr Willet after a long pause , ‘
127321	127327	127319	127319	March	321	’ A profound silence ensued . ‘
127335	127339	127329	127329	you	1335	’ said John , ‘
127429	127461	127423	127423	I	0	’ said Mr Willet , eyeing the corners of the room in a manner which showed that , like some other philosophers , he was not quite easy in his theory , ‘
127499	128083	128084	128084	He	3098	’ But this heretical doctrine was strongly opposed by the other three , who quoted a great many precedents to show that bad weather was the very time for such appearances ; and Mr Parkes ( who had had a ghost in his family , by the mother ’s side ) argued the matter with so much ingenuity and force of illustration , that John was only saved from having to retract his opinion by the opportune appearance of supper , to which they applied themselves with a dreadful relish . Even Solomon Daisy himself , by dint of the elevating influences of fire , lights , brandy , and good company , so far recovered as to handle his knife and fork in a highly creditable manner , and to display a capacity both of eating and drinking , such as banished all fear of his having sustained any lasting injury from his fright . Supper done , they crowded round the fire again , and , as is common on such occasions , propounded all manner of leading questions calculated to surround the story with new horrors and surprises . But Solomon Daisy , notwithstanding these temptations , adhered so steadily to his original account , and repeated it so often , with such slight variations , and with such solemn asseverations of its truth and reality , that his hearers were ( with good reason ) more astonished than at first . As he took John Willet ’s view of the matter in regard to the propriety of not bruiting the tale abroad , unless the spirit should appear to him again , in which case it would be necessary to take immediate counsel with the clergyman , it was solemnly resolved that it should be hushed up and kept quiet . And as most men like to have a secret to tell which may exalt their own importance , they arrived at this conclusion with perfect unanimity . As it was by this time growing late , and was long past their usual hour of separating , the cronies parted for the night . Solomon Daisy , with a fresh candle in his lantern , repaired homewards under the escort of long Phil Parkes and Mr Cobb , who were rather more nervous than himself . Mr Willet , after seeing them to the door , returned to collect his thoughts with the assistance of the boiler , and to listen to the storm of wind and rain , which had not yet abated one jot of its fury . Chapter 34 Before old John had looked at the boiler quite twenty minutes , he got his ideas into a focus , and brought them to bear upon Solomon Daisy ’s story . The more he thought of it , the more impressed he became with a sense of his own wisdom , and a desire that Mr Haredale should be impressed with it likewise . At length , to the end that he might sustain a principal and important character in the affair ; and might have the start of Solomon and his two friends , through whose means he knew the adventure , with a variety of exaggerations , would be known to at least a score of people , and most likely to Mr Haredale himself , by breakfast - time to - morrow ; he determined to repair to the Warren before going to bed . ‘
128089	128131	128084	128084	He	3098	’ thought John , as he took a candle in his hand , and setting it down in a corner out of the wind ’s way , opened a casement in the rear of the house , looking towards the stables . ‘
128198	128219	128221	128221	he	0	’ , and set one’s - self right besides . Halloa there ! Hugh -- Hugh . Hal - loa ! ’
128271	128284	128221	128221	he	0	‘ What ! Have n’t you sleep enough , growler , that you ’re
128293	128297	128221	128221	he	0	’ said John . ‘
128300	128313	128221	128221	he	0	’ replied the voice , as the speaker yawned and shook himself . ‘
128318	128319	128320	128320	I	0	’ ‘
128349	128353	128221	128221	he	0	’ said John ; ‘
128390	128482	128483	128483	You	3106	’ Hugh , with much low growling and muttering , went back into his lair ; and presently reappeared , carrying a lantern and a cudgel , and enveloped from head to foot in an old , frowzy , slouching horse - cloth . Mr Willet received this figure at the back - door , and ushered him into the bar , while he wrapped himself in sundry greatcoats and capes , and so tied and knotted his face in shawls and handkerchiefs , that how he breathed was a mystery . ‘
128511	128515	128507	128507	you	3106	’ said Hugh . ‘
128522	128527	128528	128528	I	0	’ returned Mr Willet . ‘
128586	128915	128935	128935	God	217	’ Hugh obeyed with a very indifferent grace , and a longing glance at the bottles . Old John , laying strict injunctions on his cook to keep the doors locked in his absence , and to open to nobody but himself on pain of dismissal , followed him into the blustering darkness out of doors . The way was wet and dismal , and the night so black , that if Mr Willet had been his own pilot , he would have walked into a deep horsepond within a few hundred yards of his own house , and would certainly have terminated his career in that ignoble sphere of action . But Hugh , who had a sight as keen as any hawk ’s , and , apart from that endowment , could have found his way blindfold to any place within a dozen miles , dragged old John along , quite deaf to his remonstrances , and took his own course without the slightest reference to , or notice of , his master . So they made head against the wind as they best could ; Hugh crushing the wet grass beneath his heavy tread , and stalking on after his ordinary savage fashion ; John Willet following at arm ’s length , picking his steps , and looking about him , now for bogs and ditches , and now for such stray ghosts as might be wandering abroad , with looks of as much dismay and uneasiness as his immovable face was capable of expressing . At length they stood upon the broad gravel - walk before the Warren - house . The building was profoundly dark , and none were moving near it save themselves . From one solitary turret - chamber , however , there shone a ray of light ; and towards this speck of comfort in the cold , cheerless , silent scene , Mr Willet bade his pilot lead him . ‘
128920	128928	128935	128935	God	217	’ said John , looking timidly upward ; ‘
128959	128960	128942	128943	his brother	3114	’ ‘
128969	128996	128966	128966	he	3114	’ asked Hugh , holding the lantern to his breast , to keep the candle from the wind , while he trimmed it with his fingers . ‘
129005	129006	128966	128966	he	3114	’ ‘
129009	129014	128966	128966	he	3114	’ said John indignantly . ‘
129041	129042	129029	129029	you	0	’ ‘
129053	129064	129038	129039	you ruffian	3118	’ cried Hugh , looking into John ’s fat face . ‘
129120	129262	129109	129110	One man	1808	’ Mr Willet fixed his dull eyes on his follower , and began -- by a species of inspiration -- to think it just barely possible that he was something of a dangerous character , and that it might be advisable to get rid of him one of these days . He was too prudent to say anything , with the journey home before him ; and therefore turned to the iron gate before which this brief dialogue had passed , and pulled the handle of the bell that hung beside it . The turret in which the light appeared being at one corner of the building , and only divided from the path by one of the garden - walks , upon which this gate opened , Mr Haredale threw up the window directly , and demanded who was there . ‘
129268	129272	129109	129110	One man	1808	’ said John , ‘
129295	129296	129297	129297	Willet	194	’ ‘
129303	129304	129297	129297	Willet	194	’ ‘
129315	129354	129355	129355	You	7320	’ Mr Haredale closed the window , and withdrew . He presently appeared at a door in the bottom of the turret , and coming across the garden - walk , unlocked the gate and let them in . ‘
129368	129369	129375	129375	sir	7320	’ ‘
129377	129381	129355	129355	You	7320	’ said John ; ‘
129397	129398	129411	129411	your	7320	’ ‘
129435	129559	129428	129428	You	7320	’ Hugh , who had already reached the turret , held it more steadily , and ascended first , turning round from time to time to shed his light downward on the steps . Mr Haredale following next , eyed his lowering face with no great favour ; and Hugh , looking down on him , returned his glances with interest , as they climbed the winding stairs . It terminated in a little ante - room adjoining that from which they had seen the light . Mr Haredale entered first , and led the way through it into the latter chamber , where he seated himself at a writing - table from which he had risen when they had rung the bell . ‘
129563	129579	129581	129581	you	3130	’ he said , beckoning to old John , who remained bowing at the door . ‘
129585	129596	129581	129581	you	3130	’ he added hastily to Hugh , who entered also . ‘
129607	129608	129601	129601	you	194	’ ‘
129613	129637	129611	129611	sir	7320	’ returned John , elevating his eyebrows , and lowering his voice to the tone in which the question had been asked him , ‘
129647	129648	129640	129642	a good guard	3135	’ ‘
129657	129669	129670	129670	I	0	’ said Mr Haredale , looking towards him as he spoke . ‘
129680	129681	129674	129674	He	2350	’ ‘
129690	129705	129687	129687	his	2350	’ returned Mr Willet , glancing over his shoulder at the organ in question , ‘
129708	129709	129674	129674	He	2350	’ ‘
129719	129724	129674	129674	He	2350	’ said Mr Haredale . ‘
129740	129933	129934	129934	You	3139	’ Hugh shrugged his shoulders , and with a disdainful look , which showed , either that he had overheard , or that he guessed the purport of their whispering , did as he was told . When he was shut out , Mr Haredale turned to John , and bade him go on with what he had to say , but not to speak too loud , for there were quick ears yonder . Thus cautioned , Mr Willet , in an oily whisper , recited all that he had heard and said that night ; laying particular stress upon his own sagacity , upon his great regard for the family , and upon his solicitude for their peace of mind and happiness . The story moved his auditor much more than he had expected . Mr Haredale often changed his attitude , rose and paced the room , returned again , desired him to repeat , as nearly as he could , the very words that Solomon had used , and gave so many other signs of being disturbed and ill at ease , that even Mr Willet was surprised . ‘
129939	129951	129934	129934	You	3139	’ he said , at the end of a long conversation , ‘
130046	130233	130040	130040	I	0	’ This was equal to John ’s most sanguine expectations ; but he would have preferred Mr Haredale ’s looking at him when he spoke , as if he really did thank him , to his walking up and down , speaking by fits and starts , often stopping with his eyes fixed on the ground , moving hurriedly on again , like one distracted , and seeming almost unconscious of what he said or did . This , however , was his manner ; and it was so embarrassing to John that he sat quite passive for a long time , not knowing what to do . At length he rose . Mr Haredale stared at him for a moment as though he had quite forgotten his being present , then shook hands with him , and opened the door . Hugh , who was , or feigned to be , fast asleep on the ante - chamber floor , sprang up on their entrance , and throwing his cloak about him , grasped his stick and lantern , and prepared to descend the stairs . ‘
130236	130241	130040	130040	I	0	’ said Mr Haredale . ‘
130247	130248	130243	130244	this man	711	’ ‘
130266	130271	130251	130251	He	711	’ replied John Willet . ‘
130291	130292	130281	130281	He	711	’ ‘
130301	130305	130307	130309	a hard master	3147	’ said Hugh . ‘
130327	130367	130370	130370	you	7320	’ As John made no reply , Mr Haredale brought out a glass of liquor , and gave it to Hugh , who , as he took it in his hand , threw part of it upon the floor . ‘
130384	130388	130389	130389	I	0	’ said John . ‘
130390	130395	130396	130396	Hugh	198	’m drinking a toast , ’
130416	130426	130408	130408	his	198	‘ a toast to this house and its master . ’
130906	130915	130879	130892	the horseman in the centre , who , interposing with an air of authority	3168	‘ Pray , is this the London road ? ’
130916	130926	130928	130928	Hugh	198	‘ If you follow it right , it is , ’
130931	130936	130938	130940	the same person	9389	‘ Nay , brother , ’
130942	130944	130938	130940	the same person	9389	‘ you ’re

130996	131000	130994	130994	sir	7320	’ answered John . ‘
131005	131019	131002	131002	I	0	’ he added in a subdued voice , as he turned to Hugh , ‘
131081	131091	131102	131104	the same speaker	3179	‘ em , and drown us ten miles off ? ’
131092	131100	131102	131104	the same speaker	3179	‘ How far is it to London ? ’
131106	131114	131116	131116	John	193	‘ Why , from here , sir , ’
131120	131128	131116	131116	John	193	‘ it ’s thirteen very easy mile . ’
131166	131176	131159	131161	the same person	9389	‘ Thirteen miles ! That ’s a long distance ! ’
131187	131190	131192	131193	the gentleman	1227	‘ Pray , ’
131195	131202	131192	131193	the gentleman	1227	‘ are there any inns hereabouts ? ’
131206	131209	131192	131193	the gentleman	1227	‘ inns , ’
131234	131240	131242	131243	Mr Willet	194	‘ There are no inns , ’
131254	131285	131242	131243	Mr Willet	194	‘ but there ’s a Inn -- one Inn -- the Maypole Inn . That ’s a Inn indeed . You wo n’t see the like of that Inn often . ’
131286	131293	131295	131296	the horseman	3184	‘ You keep it , perhaps ? ’
131300	131306	131308	131308	John	193	‘ I do , sir , ’
131319	131329	131308	131308	John	193	‘ And how far is the Maypole from here ? ’
131330	131367	131295	131296	the horseman	3184	‘ About a mile’--John was going to add that it was the easiest mile in all the world , when the third rider , who had hitherto kept a little in the rear , suddenly interposed : ‘
131411	131412	131413	131413	We	3190	’ ‘
131428	131432	131426	131426	sir	7320	’ answered John . ‘
131439	131440	131426	131426	sir	7320	’ ‘
131448	131457	131426	131426	sir	7320	’ interposed the gentleman who had spoken before ; ‘
131475	131476	131468	131469	my friend	1009	’ ‘
131672	131682	131669	131670	My lord	3194	’ said the speaker , rising in his stirrups , ‘

131733	131746	131710	131711	My lord	3194	’ exclaimed his lordship , lifting up his hat with great solemnity . ‘
131749	131750	131751	131752	John Grueby	322	’ ‘
131754	131769	131770	131771	his lordship	9517	’ said the long - winded gentleman , in a tone of mild reproof , ‘

131784	131797	131782	131782	sir	7320	’ said the man , sitting like a statue on his horse . ‘
131807	131825	131801	131801	YOU	7320	’ To which John Grueby made no reply at all , but sat looking straight before him . ‘
131832	131837	131830	131830	Grueby	322	’ said the gentleman . ‘
131872	131873	131859	131860	Bloody Mary	324	’ ‘
131878	131885	131876	131876	sir	7320	’ cried the man , gruffly , ‘
131966	132160	131945	131945	she	324	’ By this time Mr Willet , who had never heard so many words spoken together at one time , or delivered with such volubility and emphasis as by the long - winded gentleman ; and whose brain , being wholly unable to sustain or compass them , had quite given itself up for lost ; recovered so far as to observe that there was ample accommodation at the Maypole for all the party : good beds ; neat wines ; excellent entertainment for man and beast ; private rooms for large and small parties ; dinners dressed upon the shortest notice ; choice stabling , and a lock - up coach - house ; and , in short , to run over such recommendatory scraps of language as were painted up on various portions of the building , and which in the course of some forty years he had learnt to repeat with tolerable correctness . He was considering whether it was at all possible to insert any novel sentences to the same purpose , when the gentleman who had spoken first , turning to him of the long wind , exclaimed , ‘
132185	132186	132181	132181	You	7320	’ ‘
132196	132209	132187	132187	I	0	’ returned the person he appealed to , in a silky tone , ‘
132249	132250	132232	132233	his lordship	9517	’ ‘
132262	132268	132255	132255	landlord	7982	’ said Lord George Gordon ; ‘
132276	132277	132255	132255	landlord	7982	’ ‘
132288	132298	132279	132279	you	7982	’ said John Grueby , in a low voice , ‘
132335	132336	132337	132338	John Grueby	322	’ ‘
132343	132352	132337	132338	John Grueby	322	’ interposed Mr Gashford , falling back hastily . ‘
132393	132611	132379	132379	you	7982	’ John made no answer , but looking straight before him , as his custom seemed to be when the secretary spoke , bade Hugh push on , and followed close behind him . Then came his lordship , with Mr Willet at his bridle rein ; and , last of all , his lordship ’s secretary -- for that , it seemed , was Gashford ’s office . Hugh strode briskly on , often looking back at the servant , whose horse was close upon his heels , and glancing with a leer at his holster case of pistols , by which he seemed to set great store . He was a square - built , strong - made , bull - necked fellow , of the true English breed ; and as Hugh measured him with his eye , he measured Hugh , regarding him meanwhile with a look of bluff disdain . He was much older than the Maypole man , being to all appearance five - and - forty ; but was one of those self - possessed , hard - headed , imperturbable fellows , who , if they are ever beaten at fisticuffs , or other kind of warfare , never know it , and go on coolly till they win . ‘
132619	132625	132613	132613	I	0	’ said Hugh , tauntingly , ‘
132640	132675	132637	132637	I	0	’ John Grueby took no more notice of this remark than if he had been deaf and Hugh dumb ; but kept riding on quite comfortably , with his eyes fixed on the horizon . ‘
132692	132696	132677	132677	you	3231	’ said Hugh . ‘
132707	132728	132698	132698	you	3231	’ John Grueby looked at him sideways with the same contented air , but deigned not a word in answer . ‘
132732	132754	132698	132698	you	3231	’ said Hugh , giving his cudgel one of those skilful flourishes , in which the rustic of that time delighted . ‘
132757	132758	132698	132698	you	3231	’ ‘
132762	132786	132698	132698	you	3231	’ returned John Grueby , beating down his guard with his whip , and striking him on the head with its butt end . ‘
132816	132930	132802	132802	I	0	’ It was a pretty smart , loud - sounding rap , as it was , and evidently astonished Hugh ; who , for the moment , seemed disposed to drag his new acquaintance from his saddle . But his face betokening neither malice , triumph , rage , nor any lingering idea that he had given him offence ; his eyes gazing steadily in the old direction , and his manner being as careless and composed as if he had merely brushed away a fly ; Hugh was so puzzled , and so disposed to look upon him as a customer of almost supernatural toughness , that he merely laughed , and cried ‘
132934	133583	132802	132802	I	0	’ then , sheering off a little , led the way in silence . Before the lapse of many minutes the party halted at the Maypole door . Lord George and his secretary quickly dismounting , gave their horses to their servant , who , under the guidance of Hugh , repaired to the stables . Right glad to escape from the inclemency of the night , they followed Mr Willet into the common room , and stood warming themselves and drying their clothes before the cheerful fire , while he busied himself with such orders and preparations as his guest ’s high quality required . As he bustled in and out of the room , intent on these arrangements , he had an opportunity of observing the two travellers , of whom , as yet , he knew nothing but the voice . The lord , the great personage who did the Maypole so much honour , was about the middle height , of a slender make , and sallow complexion , with an aquiline nose , and long hair of a reddish brown , combed perfectly straight and smooth about his ears , and slightly powdered , but without the faintest vestige of a curl . He was attired , under his greatcoat , in a full suit of black , quite free from any ornament , and of the most precise and sober cut . The gravity of his dress , together with a certain lankness of cheek and stiffness of deportment , added nearly ten years to his age , but his figure was that of one not yet past thirty . As he stood musing in the red glow of the fire , it was striking to observe his very bright large eye , which betrayed a restlessness of thought and purpose , singularly at variance with the studied composure and sobriety of his mien , and with his quaint and sad apparel . It had nothing harsh or cruel in its expression ; neither had his face , which was thin and mild , and wore an air of melancholy ; but it was suggestive of an indefinable uneasiness ; which infected those who looked upon him , and filled them with a kind of pity for the man : though why it did so , they would have had some trouble to explain . Gashford , the secretary , was taller , angularly made , high - shouldered , bony , and ungraceful . His dress , in imitation of his superior , was demure and staid in the extreme ; his manner , formal and constrained . This gentleman had an overhanging brow , great hands and feet and ears , and a pair of eyes that seemed to have made an unnatural retreat into his head , and to have dug themselves a cave to hide in . His manner was smooth and humble , but very sly and slinking . He wore the aspect of a man who was always lying in wait for something that WOULDN’T come to pass ; but he looked patient -- very patient -- and fawned like a spaniel dog . Even now , while he warmed and rubbed his hands before the blaze , he had the air of one who only presumed to enjoy it in his degree as a commoner ; and though he knew his lord was not regarding him , he looked into his face from time to time , and with a meek and deferential manner , smiled as if for practice . Such were the guests whom old John Willet , with a fixed and leaden eye , surveyed a hundred times , and to whom he now advanced with a state candlestick in each hand , beseeching them to follow him into a worthier chamber . ‘
133588	133654	132802	132802	I	0	’ said John -- it is odd enough , but certain people seem to have as great a pleasure in pronouncing titles as their owners have in wearing them--‘this room , my lord , is n’t at all the sort of place for your lordship , and I have to beg your lordship ’s pardon for keeping you here , my lord , one minute . ’
133934	133941	133943	133943	Gashford	325	‘ So ends , my lord , ’
133952	133962	133943	133943	Gashford	325	‘ the blessed work of a most blessed day . ’
133963	133970	133976	133976	his	9517	‘ And of a blessed yesterday , ’
133979	134035	133976	133976	his	9517	‘ Ah!’--and here the secretary clasped his hands--‘a blessed yesterday indeed ! The Protestants of Suffolk are godly men and true . Though others of our countrymen have lost their way in darkness , even as we , my lord , did lose our road to - night , theirs is the light and glory . ’
134036	134044	134046	134047	Lord George	323	‘ Did I move them , Gashford ? ’
134049	134083	134046	134047	Lord George	323	‘ Move them , my lord ! Move them ! They cried to be led on against the Papists , they vowed a dreadful vengeance on their heads , they roared like men possessed-- ’
134084	134090	134092	134093	his lord	9564	‘ But not by devils , ’
134095	134105	134092	134093	his lord	9564	‘ By devils ! my lord ! By angels . ’
134106	134118	134120	134121	Lord George	323	‘ Yes -- oh surely -- by angels , no doubt , ’
134146	134155	134092	134093	his lord	9564	‘ Of course by angels -- eh Gashford ? ’
134156	134166	134168	134169	the secretary	9531	‘ You do not doubt it , my lord ? ’
134171	134176	134168	134169	the secretary	9531	‘ No -- No , ’
134181	134209	134210	134210	he	9564	‘ No . Why should I ? I suppose it would be decidedly irreligious to doubt it -- wouldn’t it , Gashford ? Though there certainly were , ’
134219	134229	134210	134210	he	9564	‘ some plaguy ill - looking characters among them . ’
134230	134235	134237	134238	the secretary	9531	‘ When you warmed , ’
134256	134480	134237	134238	the secretary	9531	‘ when you warmed into that noble outbreak ; when you told them that you were never of the lukewarm or the timid tribe , and bade them take heed that they were prepared to follow one who would lead them on , though to the very death ; when you spoke of a hundred and twenty thousand men across the Scottish border who would take their own redress at any time , if it were not conceded ; when you cried “ Perish the Pope and all his base adherents ; the penal laws against them shall never be repealed while Englishmen have hearts and hands”--and waved your own and touched your sword ; and when they cried “ No Popery ! ” and you cried “ No ; not even if we wade in blood , ” and they threw up their hats and cried “ Hurrah ! not even if we wade in blood ; No Popery ! Lord George ! Down with the Papists -- Vengeance on their heads : ” when this was said and done , and a word from you , my lord , could raise or still the tumult -- ah ! then I felt what greatness was indeed , and thought , When was there ever power like this of Lord George Gordon ’s ! ’
134481	134489	134253	134253	he	9564	‘ It ’s a great power . You ’re
134498	134505	134253	134253	he	9564	’ he cried with sparkling eyes . ‘

134525	134533	134512	134512	I	0	’ cried the secretary , looking upwards . ‘

134564	134571	134562	134562	I	0	’ he asked with evident delight . ‘

134619	134643	134617	134617	ours	3250	’ he rejoined , moving uneasily in his seat , and biting his nails as though he would pare them to the quick . ‘
134672	134673	134670	134670	you	325	’ ‘
134680	134703	134704	134704	ME	0	’ whined Gashford , drawing his chair nearer with an injured air , and laying his broad flat hand upon the table ; ‘
134706	134724	134704	134704	ME	0	’ he repeated , bending the dark hollows of his eyes upon him with an unwholesome smile , ‘

134781	134804	134775	134775	I	0	’ replied the other , shaking him by the hand , rising from his seat , and pacing restlessly about the room . ‘
134817	134827	134815	134815	Gashford	325	’ he added as he made a sudden halt . ‘
134834	134840	134815	134815	Gashford	325	’ returned the pliant secretary . ‘
134886	134887	134868	134868	them	8916	’ ‘
134891	134895	134898	134898	them	8916	’ repeated Gashford . ‘

134945	134962	134898	134898	them	8916	’ repeated Gashford again -- taking the lion ’s share of the mulled wine between whiles . ‘
134979	135003	134977	134977	Gashford	325	’ said Lord George with a heightened colour and in a louder voice , as he laid his fevered hand upon his shoulder , ‘
135082	135083	135104	135105	the people	8916	’ ‘
135086	135091	135104	135105	the people	8916	’ said the secretary , ‘

135123	135204	135205	135205	Gashford	325	’ It would be difficult to convey an adequate idea of the excited manner in which he gave these answers to the secretary ’s promptings ; of the rapidity of his utterance , or the violence of his tone and gesture ; in which , struggling through his Puritan ’s demeanour , was something wild and ungovernable which broke through all restraint . For some minutes he walked rapidly up and down the room , then stopping suddenly , exclaimed , ‘
135219	135220	135216	135216	You	325	’ ‘
135231	135244	135245	135245	I	0	’ replied the humble secretary , laying his hand upon his heart . ‘

135309	135326	135331	135332	the secretary	9531	‘ Too tired , my lord!--But this is his consideration ! Christian from head to foot . ’

135567	135590	135596	135596	his	3194	’ pursued John Grueby , looking , as usual , a long way off , and taking no notice of this hint , ‘

137275	137294	137273	137273	she	219	’ The secretary nodded , and rubbed the bridge of his nose with the feather of his pen . ‘
137301	137306	137295	137295	She	219	’ said Lord George . ‘
137324	137325	137326	137327	A malignant	3337	’ ‘
137329	137339	137326	137327	A malignant	3337	’ returned the secretary , folding up his papers . ‘

137376	137387	137366	137367	My lord	3194	’ he turned restlessly in his bed as he spoke , ‘
137421	137422	137419	137419	they	3340	’ ‘
137431	137468	137419	137419	they	3340	’ said Gashford , with a meaning look , which was rather the involuntary expression of his own thoughts than intended as any confirmation of his words , for the other ’s face was turned away . ‘
137478	137479	137419	137419	they	3340	’ ‘
137482	137493	137495	137495	their	3340	’ he said with a more restless motion than before , ‘
137536	137542	137533	137533	you	3343	’ The secretary was beginning with ‘
137548	137559	137543	137543	You	3343	’ when the other interrupted him , and impatiently rejoined : ‘
137594	137607	137566	137566	I	0	’ he cried , springing up in bed , after repeating the phrase ‘
137612	137622	137566	137566	I	0	’ to himself , at least a dozen times , ‘
137675	137676	137668	137668	I	0	’ ‘
137686	137690	137691	137691	I	0	’ cried Gashford . ‘
137723	138102	137716	137716	you	3352	’ The secretary drooped his head with an expression of perfect acquiescence in anything that had been said or might be ; and Lord George gradually sinking down upon his pillow , fell asleep . Although there was something very ludicrous in his vehement manner , taken in conjunction with his meagre aspect and ungraceful presence , it would scarcely have provoked a smile in any man of kindly feeling ; or even if it had , he would have felt sorry and almost angry with himself next moment , for yielding to the impulse . This lord was sincere in his violence and in his wavering . A nature prone to false enthusiasm , and the vanity of being a leader , were the worst qualities apparent in his composition . All the rest was weakness -- sheer weakness ; and it is the unhappy lot of thoroughly weak men , that their very sympathies , affections , confidences -- all the qualities which in better constituted minds are virtues -- dwindle into foibles , or turn into downright vices . Gashford , with many a sly look towards the bed , sat chuckling at his master ’s folly , until his deep and heavy breathing warned him that he might retire . Locking his desk , and replacing it within the trunk ( but not before he had taken from a secret lining two printed handbills ) , he cautiously withdrew ; looking back , as he went , at the pale face of the slumbering man , above whose head the dusty plumes that crowned the Maypole couch , waved drearily and sadly as though it were a bier . Stopping on the staircase to listen that all was quiet , and to take off his shoes lest his footsteps should alarm any light sleeper who might be near at hand , he descended to the ground floor , and thrust one of his bills beneath the great door of the house . That done , he crept softly back to his own chamber , and from the window let another fall -- carefully wrapt round a stone to save it from the wind -- into the yard below . They were addressed on the back ‘
138113	138120	137716	137716	you	3352	’ and bore within what follows : ‘
138186	138187	139174	139174	my	0	’ ‘
138194	138203	139174	139174	my	0	’ said Gashford as he closed the window . ‘
138210	139105	139106	139107	My lord	3194	’ Chapter 37 To surround anything , however monstrous or ridiculous , with an air of mystery , is to invest it with a secret charm , and power of attraction which to the crowd is irresistible . False priests , false prophets , false doctors , false patriots , false prodigies of every kind , veiling their proceedings in mystery , have always addressed themselves at an immense advantage to the popular credulity , and have been , perhaps , more indebted to that resource in gaining and keeping for a time the upper hand of Truth and Common Sense , than to any half - dozen items in the whole catalogue of imposture . Curiosity is , and has been from the creation of the world , a master - passion . To awaken it , to gratify it by slight degrees , and yet leave something always in suspense , is to establish the surest hold that can be had , in wrong , on the unthinking portion of mankind . If a man had stood on London Bridge , calling till he was hoarse , upon the passers - by , to join with Lord George Gordon , although for an object which no man understood , and which in that very incident had a charm of its own,--the probability is , that he might have influenced a score of people in a month . If all zealous Protestants had been publicly urged to join an association for the avowed purpose of singing a hymn or two occasionally , and hearing some indifferent speeches made , and ultimately of petitioning Parliament not to pass an act for abolishing the penal laws against Roman Catholic priests , the penalty of perpetual imprisonment denounced against those who educated children in that persuasion , and the disqualification of all members of the Romish church to inherit real property in the United Kingdom by right of purchase or descent,--matters so far removed from the business and bosoms of the mass , might perhaps have called together a hundred people . But when vague rumours got abroad , that in this Protestant association a secret power was mustering against the government for undefined and mighty purposes ; when the air was filled with whispers of a confederacy among the Popish powers to degrade and enslave England , establish an inquisition in London , and turn the pens of Smithfield market into stakes and cauldrons ; when terrors and alarms which no man understood were perpetually broached , both in and out of Parliament , by one enthusiast who did not understand himself , and bygone bugbears which had lain quietly in their graves for centuries , were raised again to haunt the ignorant and credulous ; when all this was done , as it were , in the dark , and secret invitations to join the Great Protestant Association in defence of religion , life , and liberty , were dropped in the public ways , thrust under the house - doors , tossed in at windows , and pressed into the hands of those who trod the streets by night ; when they glared from every wall , and shone on every post and pillar , so that stocks and stones appeared infected with the common fear , urging all men to join together blindfold in resistance of they knew not what , they knew not why;--then the mania spread indeed , and the body , still increasing every day , grew forty thousand strong . So said , at least , in this month of March , 1780 , Lord George Gordon , the Association ’s president . Whether it was the fact or otherwise , few men knew or cared to ascertain . It had never made any public demonstration ; had scarcely ever been heard of , save through him ; had never been seen ; and was supposed by many to be the mere creature of his disordered brain . He was accustomed to talk largely about numbers of men -- stimulated , as it was inferred , by certain successful disturbances , arising out of the same subject , which had occurred in Scotland in the previous year ; was looked upon as a cracked - brained member of the lower house , who attacked all parties and sided with none , and was very little regarded . It was known that there was discontent abroad -- there always is ; he had been accustomed to address the people by placard , speech , and pamphlet , upon other questions ; nothing had come , in England , of his past exertions , and nothing was apprehended from his present . Just as he has come upon the reader , he had come , from time to time , upon the public , and been forgotten in a day ; as suddenly as he appears in these pages , after a blank of five long years , did he and his proceedings begin to force themselves , about this period , upon the notice of thousands of people , who had mingled in active life during the whole interval , and who , without being deaf or blind to passing events , had scarcely ever thought of him before . ‘
139109	139126	139106	139107	My lord	3194	’ said Gashford in his ear , as he drew the curtains of his bed betimes ; ‘

139150	139160	139106	139107	My lord	3194	’ returned the secretary , with meekly folded hands . ‘

139197	139211	139191	139191	I	0	’ said Lord George , rubbing his eyes and looking round the room , ‘

139229	139237	139226	139227	My lord	3194	’ cried Gashford , with a smile . ‘
139240	139245	139226	139227	My lord	3194	’ returned his superior . ‘
139249	139255	139262	139264	the pious secretary	3361	’re not a Jew then ? ’
139256	139260	139262	139264	the pious secretary	3361	‘ A Jew ! ’
139268	139291	139262	139264	the pious secretary	3361	‘ I dreamed that we were Jews , Gashford . You and I -- both of us -- Jews with long beards . ’
139292	139306	139262	139264	the pious secretary	3361	‘ Heaven forbid , my lord ! We might as well be Papists . ’
139307	139313	139315	139316	the other	483	‘ I suppose we might , ’
139321	139331	139315	139316	the other	483	‘ Eh ? You really think so , Gashford ? ’
139332	139337	139338	139339	the secretary	9531	‘ Surely I do , ’
139348	139351	139352	139352	he	9531	‘ Humph ! ’
139355	139362	139352	139352	he	9531	‘ Yes , that seems reasonable . ’
139363	139368	139369	139370	the secretary	9531	‘ I hope my lord-- ’
139373	139376	139377	139377	he	9531	‘ Hope ! ’
139383	139402	139377	139377	he	9531	‘ Why do you say , you hope ? There ’s no harm in thinking of such things . ’
139403	139408	139410	139411	the Secretary	9531	‘ Not in dreams , ’
139413	139423	139410	139411	the Secretary	9531	‘ In dreams ! No , nor waking either . ’
139433	139557	139377	139377	he	9531	’ said Gashford , taking up Lord George ’s watch which lay upon a chair , and seeming to read the inscription on the seal , abstractedly . It was the slightest action possible , not obtruded on his notice , and apparently the result of a moment ’s absence of mind , not worth remark . But as the words were uttered , Lord George , who had been going on impetuously , stopped short , reddened , and was silent . Apparently quite unconscious of this change in his demeanour , the wily Secretary stepped a little apart , under pretence of pulling up the window - blind , and returning when the other had had time to recover , said : ‘
139650	139651	139685	139685	You	3371	’ ‘
139661	139666	139685	139685	You	3371	’ replied Lord George ; ‘
139732	139767	139768	139768	he	0	’ He said this with a heightened colour , and in a tone of such enthusiasm , that the secretary deemed all further prompting needless , and withdrew . --‘Dreamed he was a Jew , ’
139779	139875	139768	139768	he	0	‘ He may come to that before he dies . It ’s like enough . Well ! After a time , and provided I lost nothing by it , I do n’t see why that religion should n’t suit me as well as any other . There are rich men among the Jews ; shaving is very troublesome;--yes , it would suit me well enough . For the present , though , we must be Christian to the core . Our prophetic motto will suit all creeds in their turn , that ’s a comfort . ’
140451	140458	140461	140461	he	0	‘ Hurrah Geordie ! No Popery ! ’

140659	140665	140647	140647	their	3407	‘ Hurrah , my lord . ’

140912	140925	140901	140901	he	0	‘ Gentlemen , No Popery . Good day . God bless you . ’
140945	140952	140901	140901	he	0	‘ A speech ! a speech ! ’
141106	141112	141114	141114	Gashford	326	‘ Let him come in , ’
141116	141122	141124	141124	John	322	‘ Here ! come in ! ’
141129	141131	141132	141133	a Protestant	3425	‘ You ’re

141145	141153	141140	141140	I	0	’ replied a deep , gruff voice . ‘
141161	141166	141154	141154	You	322	’ said John Grueby . ‘
141177	141407	141171	141171	you	322	’ With which remark he gave the visitor admission , retired , and shut the door . The man who now confronted Gashford , was a squat , thickset personage , with a low , retreating forehead , a coarse shock head of hair , and eyes so small and near together , that his broken nose alone seemed to prevent their meeting and fusing into one of the usual size . A dingy handkerchief twisted like a cord about his neck , left its great veins exposed to view , and they were swollen and starting , as though with gulping down strong passions , malice , and ill - will . His dress was of threadbare velveteen -- a faded , rusty , whitened black , like the ashes of a pipe or a coal fire after a day ’s extinction ; discoloured with the soils of many a stale debauch , and reeking yet with pot - house odours . In lieu of buckles at his knees , he wore unequal loops of packthread ; and in his grimy hands he held a knotted stick , the knob of which was carved into a rough likeness of his own vile face . Such was the visitor who doffed his three - cornered hat in Gashford ’s presence , and waited , leering , for his notice . ‘
141412	141417	141410	141410	Dennis	187	’ cried the secretary . ‘

141429	141448	141450	141450	he	3194	’ cried the man , with a jerk of his thumb towards the quarter that he spoke of , ‘
141536	141547	141533	141534	Muster Gashford	325	’ And sometimes in the day - time , eh ? ’

141565	141574	141551	141551	you	187	’ roared the fellow , smiting his leg ; ‘

141606	141629	141601	141602	My lord	3194	‘ un at that , but he ’s a fool to you . Ah to be sure,--when I go out in state . ’
141630	141636	141638	141639	the secretary	9531	‘ And have your carriage , ’
141641	141655	141638	141639	the secretary	9531	‘ and your chaplain , eh ? and all the rest of it ? ’
141656	141665	141667	141667	Dennis	187	‘ You ’ll be the death of me , ’
141673	141688	141689	141689	he	187	‘ you will . But what ’s in the wind now , Muster Gashford , ’
141693	141714	141689	141689	he	187	‘ Eh ? Are we to be under orders to pull down one of them Popish chapels -- or what ? ’
141715	141718	141720	141721	the secretary	9531	‘ Hush ! ’
141733	141755	141720	141721	the secretary	9531	‘ Hush ! God bless me , Dennis ! We associate , you know , for strictly peaceable and lawful purposes . ’
141756	141763	141765	141766	the man	472	‘ I know , bless you , ’

141791	141836	141784	141784	I	0	’ said Gashford , smiling as before . And when he said so , Dennis roared again , and smote his leg still harder , and falling into fits of laughter , wiped his eyes with the corner of his neckerchief , and cried , ‘
141840	141845	141860	141860	Gashford	325	’ all England hollow ! ’

142430	142496	142427	142428	the hangman	3437	‘ If these Papists gets into power , and begins to boil and roast instead of hang , what becomes of my work !

142788	142847	142848	142848	You	3468	’ Gashford had leant back in his chair , regarding him with eyes so sunken , and so shadowed by his heavy brows , that for aught the hangman saw of them , he might have been stone blind . He remained smiling in silence for a short time longer , and then said , slowly and distinctly : ‘
142898	142899	142893	142893	you	3468	’ ‘
142924	142933	142915	142915	You	3468	’ returned the other , shaking his head . ‘

143123	143133	143111	143111	you	0	’ said the fellow , with an ugly wink . ‘
143142	143171	143134	143134	You	0	’ pursued the secretary , still smiling , and still managing his eyes so that he could watch him closely , and really not be seen in turn , ‘

143523	143539	143499	143499	he	198	‘ Nothing but that , master . It fell into good hands , you see . ’
143540	143545	143547	143547	Gashford	325	‘ What is this ! ’
143560	143585	143547	143547	Gashford	325	‘ Where did you get it from , my good fellow ; what does it mean ? I do n’t understand this at all . ’

143806	143814	143803	143804	Muster Gashford	325	’ wheezed the hangman under his breath , ‘

143859	143862	143863	143863	he	198	‘ Here ! ’

143982	143987	143979	143980	Muster Gashford	325	’ said Dennis approvingly . ‘

144036	144041	144031	144031	My	0	’ rejoined the hangman . ‘
144094	144127	144067	144067	I	0	’ With these and other expressions of confidence of the like flattering kind , Mr Dennis gave him a hearty slap on the back , which Hugh was not slow to return . ‘
144133	144138	144142	144142	brother	9503	’ cried the hangman . ‘
144144	144148	144151	144151	Popery	335	’ responded Hugh . ‘
144153	144162	144151	144151	Popery	335	’ said the secretary with his usual mildness . ‘
144169	144173	144151	144151	Popery	335	’ cried Dennis . ‘
144210	144278	144207	144208	Muster Gashford	325	’ The secretary regarded them both with a very favourable expression of countenance , while they gave loose to these and other demonstrations of their patriotic purpose ; and was about to make some remark aloud , when Dennis , stepping up to him , and shading his mouth with his hand , said , in a hoarse whisper , as he nudged him with his elbow : ‘
144329	144330	144327	144327	he	198	’ ‘
144336	144337	144331	144333	A powerful fellow	3505	’ ‘
144345	144417	144339	144339	you	3503	’ whispered Dennis , with a horrible kind of admiration , such as that with which a cannibal might regard his intimate friend , when hungry,--‘did you ever -- and here he drew still closer to his ear , and fenced his mouth with both his open hands--‘see such a throat as his ? Do but cast your eye upon it . There ’s a neck for stretching , Muster Gashford ! ’
144647	144654	144656	144656	Dennis	187	‘ Are you walking , brother ? ’
144658	144661	144656	144656	Dennis	187	‘ Ay ! ’
144665	144670	144656	144656	Dennis	187	‘ Where you will . ’
144671	144676	144678	144680	his new friend	9312	‘ That ’s social , ’
144682	144715	144716	144716	Hugh	198	‘ Which way shall we take ? Shall we go and have a look at doors that we shall make a pretty good clattering at , before long -- eh , brother ? ’
145353	145359	145361	145361	Hugh	198	‘ The hotter the better , ’
145363	145365	145361	145361	Hugh	198	‘ I ’m
145370	145374	145376	145377	his friend	7570	’--‘So am I , ’
145379	145888	145376	145377	his friend	7570	‘ and so are many of us ; and they shook hands upon it with a great oath , and with many terrible imprecations on the Papists . As they were thirsty by this time , Dennis proposed that they should repair together to The Boot , where there was good company and strong liquor . Hugh yielding a ready assent , they bent their steps that way with no loss of time . This Boot was a lone house of public entertainment , situated in the fields at the back of the Foundling Hospital ; a very solitary spot at that period , and quite deserted after dark . The tavern stood at some distance from any high road , and was approachable only by a dark and narrow lane ; so that Hugh was much surprised to find several people drinking there , and great merriment going on . He was still more surprised to find among them almost every face that had caught his attention in the crowd ; but his companion having whispered him outside the door , that it was not considered good manners at The Boot to appear at all curious about the company , he kept his own counsel , and made no show of recognition . Before putting his lips to the liquor which was brought for them , Dennis drank in a loud voice the health of Lord George Gordon , President of the Great Protestant Association ; which toast Hugh pledged likewise , with corresponding enthusiasm . A fiddler who was present , and who appeared to act as the appointed minstrel of the company , forthwith struck up a Scotch reel ; and that in tones so invigorating , that Hugh and his friend ( who had both been drinking before ) rose from their seats as by previous concert , and , to the great admiration of the assembled guests , performed an extemporaneous No - Popery Dance . Chapter 39 The applause which the performance of Hugh and his new friend elicited from the company at The Boot , had not yet subsided , and the two dancers were still panting from their exertions , which had been of a rather extreme and violent character , when the party was reinforced by the arrival of some more guests , who , being a detachment of United Bulldogs , were received with very flattering marks of distinction and respect . The leader of this small party -- for , including himself , they were but three in number -- was our old acquaintance , Mr Tappertit , who seemed , physically speaking , to have grown smaller with years ( particularly as to his legs , which were stupendously little ) , but who , in a moral point of view , in personal dignity and self - esteem , had swelled into a giant . Nor was it by any means difficult for the most unobservant person to detect this state of feeling in the quondam ‘

146115	146126	146128	146128	Dennis	187	‘ You ’ve seen my lord too , have you ? ’
146130	146137	146128	146128	Dennis	187	‘ I see him this afternoon . ’
146138	146160	146161	146162	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ My duty called me to the Lobby when our shop shut up ; and I saw him there , sir , ’

146181	146188	146190	146191	the fellow	879	‘ Lively , master , lively , ’

146265	146271	146273	146273	Hugh	198	‘ Looks or no looks , ’

146358	146404	146340	146340	Dennis	187	‘ was there ever such a game boy ! Why , I mean to say , brothers , that if Muster Gashford had gone a hundred mile and got together fifty men of the common run , they would n’t have been worth this one . ’
146482	146486	146487	146487	he	223	‘ I say , ’
146495	146503	146487	146487	he	223	‘ have n’t I seen you before ? ’
146504	146511	146513	146513	Hugh	198	‘ It ’s like you may , ’
146520	146530	146516	146516	his	198	‘ I do n’t know ; should n’t wonder . ’
146531	146541	146543	146543	Sim	223	‘ No , but it ’s very easily settled , ’
146545	146599	146516	146516	his	198	‘ Look at me . Did you ever see ME before ? You would n’t be likely to forget it , you know , if you ever did . Look at me . Do n’t be afraid ; I wo n’t do you any harm . Take a good look -- steady now . ’
146667	146670	146672	146673	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Come ! ’
146684	146692	146672	146673	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Do you know me , feller ? ’
146693	146697	146699	146699	Hugh	198	‘ Not I , ’
146701	146715	146699	146699	Hugh	198	‘ Ha ha ha ! Not I ! But I should like to . ’
146716	146729	146731	146732	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ And yet I ’d have wagered a seven - shilling piece , ’
146753	146763	146764	146764	Hugh	198	‘ that you once were hostler at the Maypole . ’
146780	146788	146790	146791	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ --And so you were , too , ’
146801	146823	146790	146791	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ When did MY eyes ever deceive -- unless it was a young woman ! Do n’t you know me now ? ’
146824	146828	146829	146829	Hugh	198	‘ Why it an’t-- ’
146832	146836	146838	146839	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ An’t it ? ’
146841	146857	146838	146839	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Are you sure of that ? You remember G. Varden , do n’t you ? ’
146877	146924	146926	146927	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ You remember coming down there , before I was out of my time , to ask after a vagabond that had bolted off , and left his disconsolate father a prey to the bitterest emotions , and all the rest of it -- don’t you ? ’
146929	146935	146937	146937	Hugh	198	‘ Of course I do ! ’
146939	146946	146937	146937	Hugh	198	‘ And I saw you there . ’
146947	146952	146954	146955	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Saw me there ! ’
146957	147023	146954	146955	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Yes , I should think you did see me there . The place would be troubled to go on without me . Do n’t you remember my thinking you liked the vagabond , and on that account going to quarrel with you ; and then finding you detested him worse than poison , going to drink with you ? Do n’t you remember that ? ’
147024	147029	147031	147031	Hugh	198	‘ To be sure ! ’
147033	147045	147047	147048	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Well ! and are you in the same mind now ? ’
147050	147053	147055	147055	Hugh	198	‘ Yes ! ’
147057	147064	147066	147067	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ You speak like a man , ’
147069	147078	147066	147067	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ and I ’ll shake hands with you . ’
147109	147113	147115	147116	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ I find , ’
147125	147151	147115	147116	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ that brother What’s - his - name and I are old acquaintance.--You never heard anything more of that rascal , I suppose , eh ? ’
147152	147157	147159	147159	Hugh	198	‘ Not a syllable , ’
147161	147184	147159	147159	Hugh	198	‘ I never want to . I do n’t believe I ever shall . He ’s dead long ago , I hope . ’
147185	147209	147211	147212	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ It ’s to be hoped , for the sake of mankind in general and the happiness of society , that he is , ’
147228	147262	147263	147263	Hugh	198	‘ Is your other hand at all cleaner ? Much the same . Well , I ’ll owe you another shake . We ’ll suppose it done , if you ’ve no objection . ’
147531	147539	147541	147541	Hugh	198	‘ Make anything you like of me ! ’
147553	147563	147564	147565	your man	3128	‘ Put me on any duty you please . I ’m
147619	148398	148402	148402	captain	7793	’ With that , he smote Mr Tappertit on the back , with such violence that his little body seemed to shrink into a mere nothing ; and roared again until the very foundlings near at hand were startled in their beds . In fact , a sense of something whimsical in their companionship seemed to have taken entire possession of his rude brain . The bare fact of being patronised by a great man whom he could have crushed with one hand , appeared in his eyes so eccentric and humorous , that a kind of ferocious merriment gained the mastery over him , and quite subdued his brutal nature . He roared and roared again ; toasted Mr Tappertit a hundred times ; declared himself a Bulldog to the core ; and vowed to be faithful to him to the last drop of blood in his veins . All these compliments Mr Tappertit received as matters of course -- flattering enough in their way , but entirely attributable to his vast superiority . His dignified self - possession only delighted Hugh the more ; and in a word , this giant and dwarf struck up a friendship which bade fair to be of long continuance , as the one held it to be his right to command , and the other considered it an exquisite pleasantry to obey . Nor was Hugh by any means a passive follower , who scrupled to act without precise and definite orders ; for when Mr Tappertit mounted on an empty cask which stood by way of rostrum in the room , and volunteered a speech upon the alarming crisis then at hand , he placed himself beside the orator , and though he grinned from ear to ear at every word he said , threw out such expressive hints to scoffers in the management of his cudgel , that those who were at first the most disposed to interrupt , became remarkably attentive , and were the loudest in their approbation . It was not all noise and jest , however , at The Boot , nor were the whole party listeners to the speech . There were some men at the other end of the room ( which was a long , low - roofed chamber ) in earnest conversation all the time ; and when any of this group went out , fresh people were sure to come in soon afterwards and sit down in their places , as though the others had relieved them on some watch or duty ; which it was pretty clear they did , for these changes took place by the clock , at intervals of half an hour . These persons whispered very much among themselves , and kept aloof , and often looked round , as jealous of their speech being overheard ; some two or three among them entered in books what seemed to be reports from the others ; when they were not thus employed one of them would turn to the newspapers which were strewn upon the table , and from the St James ’s Chronicle , the Herald , Chronicle , or Public Advertiser , would read to the rest in a low voice some passage having reference to the topic in which they were all so deeply interested . But the great attraction was a pamphlet called The Thunderer , which espoused their own opinions , and was supposed at that time to emanate directly from the Association . This was always in request ; and whether read aloud , to an eager knot of listeners , or by some solitary man , was certain to be followed by stormy talking and excited looks . In the midst of all his merriment , and admiration of his captain , Hugh was made sensible by these and other tokens , of the presence of an air of mystery , akin to that which had so much impressed him out of doors . It was impossible to discard a sense that something serious was going on , and that under the noisy revel of the public - house , there lurked unseen and dangerous matter . Little affected by this , however , he was perfectly satisfied with his quarters and would have remained there till morning , but that his conductor rose soon after midnight , to go home ; Mr Tappertit following his example , left him no excuse to stay . So they all three left the house together : roaring a No - Popery song until the fields resounded with the dismal noise . ‘
148404	148417	148418	148419	Another stave	3592	’ cried Hugh , when they had roared themselves out of breath . ‘
148421	148546	148418	148419	Another stave	3592	’ Mr Tappertit , nothing loath , began again ; and so the three went staggering on , arm - in - arm , shouting like madmen , and defying the watch with great valour . Indeed this did not require any unusual bravery or boldness , as the watchmen of that time , being selected for the office on account of excessive age and extraordinary infirmity , had a custom of shutting themselves up tight in their boxes on the first symptoms of disturbance , and remaining there until they disappeared . In these proceedings , Mr Dennis , who had a gruff voice and lungs of considerable power , distinguished himself very much , and acquired great credit with his two companions . ‘
148554	148559	148560	148560	You	3593	’ said Mr Tappertit . ‘
148561	148577	148560	148560	You	3593	’re so precious sly and close . Why do n’t you ever tell what trade you ’re
148580	148581	148560	148560	You	3593	’ ‘
148587	148599	148583	148584	the captain	1059	’ cried Hugh , beating his hat down on his head ; ‘
148609	148612	148583	148584	the captain	1059	’re of ? ’
148613	148615	148583	148584	the captain	1059	‘ I ’m
148642	148643	148645	148645	you	3593	’ ‘
148646	148651	148653	148654	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ prenticed to it ? ’
148656	148662	148664	148665	Mr Dennis	187	‘ No . Natural genius , ’
148667	148669	148664	148665	Mr Dennis	187	‘ No ‘

150099	150252	150091	150091	I	0	’ Chapter 40 Little thinking of the plan for his happy settlement in life which had suggested itself to the teeming brain of his provident commander , Hugh made no pause until Saint Dunstan ’s giants struck the hour above him , when he worked the handle of a pump which stood hard by , with great vigour , and thrusting his head under the spout , let the water gush upon him until a little stream ran down from every uncombed hair , and he was wet to the waist . Considerably refreshed by this ablution , both in mind and body , and almost sobered for the time , he dried himself as he best could ; then crossed the road , and plied the knocker of the Middle Temple gate . The night - porter looked through a small grating in the portal with a surly eye , and cried ‘
150255	150269	150091	150091	I	0	’ which greeting Hugh returned in kind , and bade him open quickly . ‘
150277	150282	150091	150091	I	0	’ cried the man ; ‘
150289	150290	150286	150286	you	3628	’ ‘
150295	150306	150286	150286	you	3628	’ Hugh replied , with a kick at the door . ‘
150311	150312	150286	150286	you	3628	’ ‘
150316	150317	150286	150286	you	3628	’ ‘

150328	150371	150372	150372	YOU	3628	’ Each of which answers , he emphasised with another kick . After a little growling on the other side , the gate was opened , and he passed in : undergoing a close inspection from the porter as he did so . ‘
150383	150388	150372	150372	YOU	3628	’ said the man . ‘
150391	150395	150396	150396	I	0	’ said Hugh . ‘
150402	150403	150372	150372	YOU	3628	’ ‘

150430	150490	150418	150418	I	0	’ Eyeing him with suspicious looks , the man , with key and lantern , walked on at his side , and attended him to Sir John Chester ’s door , at which Hugh gave one knock , that echoed through the dark staircase like a ghostly summons , and made the dull light tremble in the drowsy lamp . ‘
150499	150537	150492	150492	you	3628	’ said Hugh . Before the man had time to answer , a footstep was heard within , a light appeared , and Sir John , in his dressing - gown and slippers , opened the door . ‘
150546	150556	150543	150544	Sir John	342	’ said the porter , pulling off his hat . ‘
150587	150588	150576	150576	I	0	’ ‘
150591	150600	150576	150576	I	0	’ cried Sir John , raising his eyebrows . ‘
150634	150653	150627	150627	God	217	’ To be commended , thanked , God - blessed , and bade good night by one who carried ‘
150655	151111	150627	150627	God	217	’ before his name , and wrote himself M.P. to boot , was something for a porter . He withdrew with much humility and reverence . Sir John followed his late visitor into the dressing - room , and sitting in his easy - chair before the fire , and moving it so that he could see him as he stood , hat in hand , beside the door , looked at him from head to foot . The old face , calm and pleasant as ever ; the complexion , quite juvenile in its bloom and clearness ; the same smile ; the wonted precision and elegance of dress ; the white , well - ordered teeth ; the delicate hands ; the composed and quiet manner ; everything as it used to be : no mark of age or passion , envy , hate , or discontent : all unruffled and serene , and quite delightful to behold . He wrote himself M.P.--but how ? Why , thus . It was a proud family -- more proud , indeed , than wealthy . He had stood in danger of arrest ; of bailiffs , and a jail -- a vulgar jail , to which the common people with small incomes went . Gentlemen of ancient houses have no privilege of exemption from such cruel laws -- unless they are of one great house , and then they have . A proud man of his stock and kindred had the means of sending him there . He offered -- not indeed to pay his debts , but to let him sit for a close borough until his own son came of age , which , if he lived , would come to pass in twenty years . It was quite as good as an Insolvent Act , and infinitely more genteel . So Sir John Chester was a member of Parliament . But how Sir John ? Nothing so simple , or so easy . One touch with a sword of state , and the transformation was effected . John Chester , Esquire , M.P. , attended court -- went up with an address -- headed a deputation . Such elegance of manner , so many graces of deportment , such powers of conversation , could never pass unnoticed . Mr was too common for such merit . A man so gentlemanly should have been -- but Fortune is capricious -- born a Duke : just as some dukes should have been born labourers . He caught the fancy of the king , knelt down a grub , and rose a butterfly . John Chester , Esquire , was knighted and became Sir John . ‘
151125	151135	151112	151112	I	0	’ said Sir John after a pretty long silence , ‘
151145	151146	151137	151137	you	0	’ ‘

151160	151169	151157	151157	you	0	’ he retorted , glancing at his watch . ‘
151177	151236	151173	151173	you	0	’ Instead of replying , Hugh changed the leg on which he leant , shuffled his cap from one hand to the other , looked at the ground , the wall , the ceiling , and finally at Sir John himself ; before whose pleasant face he lowered his eyes again , and fixed them on the floor . ‘
151248	151258	151240	151240	you	0	’ quoth Sir John , lazily crossing his legs . ‘
151271	151272	151278	151278	master	7428	’ ‘
151280	151287	151278	151278	master	7428	’ growled Hugh , with humility . ‘

151302	151307	151299	151299	I	0	’ returned Sir John . ‘
151311	151316	151318	151318	you	7428	’ said Hugh uneasily , ‘
151353	151396	151398	151398	you	7428	’ Something like an expression of triumph in the perfect control he had established over this rough instrument appeared in the knight ’s face for an instant ; but it vanished directly , as he said -- paring his nails while speaking : ‘
151458	151474	151408	151408	you	7428	’ and here he turned his eyes upon him--‘to be more guarded . Will you ? ’
151475	151484	151486	151486	Hugh	198	‘ I meant to give you no offence , ’
151488	151505	151486	151486	Hugh	198	‘ I do n’t know what to say . You catch me up so very short . ’
151506	151531	151533	151534	his patron	2259	‘ You will be caught up much shorter , my good friend -- infinitely shorter -- one of these days , depend upon it , ’
151537	151568	151533	151534	his patron	2259	‘ By - the - bye , instead of wondering why you have been so long , my wonder should be why you came at all . Why did you ? ’
151569	151575	151577	151577	Hugh	198	‘ You know , master , ’
151579	151611	151577	151577	Hugh	198	‘ that I could n’t read the bill I found , and that supposing it to be something particular from the way it was wrapped up , I brought it here . ’
151612	151626	151628	151629	Sir John	342	‘ And could you ask no one else to read it , Bruin ? ’
151631	151672	151628	151629	Sir John	342	‘ No one that I could trust with secrets , master . Since Barnaby Rudge was lost sight of for good and all -- and that ’s five years ago -- I have n’t talked with any one but you . ’
151673	151684	151577	151577	Hugh	198	‘ You have done me honour , I am sure . ’
151685	151722	151724	151724	Hugh	198	‘ I have come to and fro , master , all through that time , when there was anything to tell , because I knew that you ’d be angry with me if I stayed away , ’
151736	151781	151724	151724	Hugh	198	‘ and because I wished to please you if I could , and not to have you go against me . There . That ’s the true reason why I came to - night . You know that , master , I am sure . ’
151782	151789	151791	151792	Sir John	342	‘ You are a specious fellow , ’
151800	151871	151795	151795	his	342	‘ and carry two faces under your hood , as well as the best . Did n’t you give me in this room , this evening , any other reason ; no dislike of anybody who has slighted you lately , on all occasions , abused you , treated you with rudeness ; acted towards you , more as if you were a mongrel dog than a man like himself ? ’
151872	151879	151881	151881	Hugh	198	‘ To be sure I did ! ’
151894	151947	151881	151881	Hugh	198	‘ and I say it all over now , again . I ’d do anything to have some revenge on him -- anything . And when you told me that he and all the Catholics would suffer from those who joined together under that handbill , I said I ’d make one of ‘
151962	152052	152053	152053	em	3642	‘ em . See whether I am as good as my word and turn out to be among the foremost , or no . I may n’t have much head , master , but I ’ve head enough to remember those that use me ill . You shall see , and so shall he , and so shall hundreds more , how my spirit backs me when the time comes . My bark is nothing to my bite . Some that I know had better have a wild lion among ‘
152066	152117	152118	152118	You	3644	’ The knight looked at him with a smile of far deeper meaning than ordinary ; and pointing to the old cupboard , followed him with his eyes while he filled and drank a glass of liquor ; and smiled when his back was turned , with deeper meaning yet . ‘
152128	152138	152118	152118	You	3644	’ he said , when Hugh confronted him again . ‘
152144	152148	152142	152142	master	7428	’ cried Hugh . ‘

152292	152299	152264	152266	A roaring dog	3654	’ replied Sir John , carelessly . ‘

152334	152339	152324	152324	He	3652	’ laughed Sir John . ‘

152612	152616	152618	152618	Hugh	198	‘ I would , ’
152629	152654	152618	152618	Hugh	198	‘ but what do I risk ! What do I stand a chance of losing , master ? Friends , home ? A fig for ‘

152758	152820	152729	152729	I	0	’ Hugh nodded , and touching his cap with an air of as much respect as he could summon up , departed . Sir John , fastening the doors behind him , went back to his dressing - room , and sat down once again before the fire , at which he gazed for a long time , in earnest meditation . ‘

153082	153114	153115	153115	I	0	’ When he came to this point , he took a pinch of snuff ; then beginning slowly to undress , he resumed his meditations , by saying with a smile : ‘
153218	153389	153417	153417	Women	648	’ So he took another pinch of snuff , and went to bed . Chapter 41 From the workshop of the Golden Key , there issued forth a tinkling sound , so merry and good - humoured , that it suggested the idea of some one working blithely , and made quite pleasant music . No man who hammered on at a dull monotonous duty , could have brought such cheerful notes from steel and iron ; none but a chirping , healthy , honest - hearted fellow , who made the best of everything , and felt kindly towards everybody , could have done it for an instant . He might have been a coppersmith , and still been musical . If he had sat in a jolting waggon , full of rods of iron , it seemed as if he would have brought some harmony out of it . Tink , tink , tink -- clear as a silver bell , and audible at every pause of the streets ’

154140	154160	154132	154133	Mrs Varden	219	‘ A fool indeed . A man at your time of life , Varden , should know better now . ’

154263	154270	154272	154273	the locksmith	7447	‘ Tut , tut , Martha , ’
154275	154324	154272	154273	the locksmith	7447	‘ do n’t take offence at nothing . I mean , how strange it is of you to run down volunteering , when it ’s done to defend you and all the other women , and our own fireside and everybody else ’s , in case of need . ’
154325	154330	154332	154333	Mrs Varden	219	‘ It ’s unchristian , ’
154339	154342	154344	154345	the locksmith	7447	‘ Unchristian ! ’
154347	154353	154344	154345	the locksmith	7447	‘ Why , what the devil-- ’
154465	154513	154455	154455	he	7447	‘ I was going to say , what on earth do you call it unchristian for ? Which would be most unchristian , Martha -- to sit quietly down and let our houses be sacked by a foreign army , or to turn out like men and drive ‘
154554	154558	154560	154560	you	219	’ When he said ‘
154562	154582	154560	154560	you	219	’ Mrs Varden , despite herself , relaxed into a smile . There was something complimentary in the idea . ‘
154593	154597	154560	154560	you	219	’ she simpered . ‘
154601	154606	154560	154560	you	219	’ repeated the locksmith . ‘
154693	154799	154679	154679	I	0	’ And here the locksmith laughed again so heartily , that tears came into his eyes -- much to Mrs Varden ’s indignation , who thought the capture of so sound a Protestant and estimable a private character as Miggs by a pagan negro , a circumstance too shocking and awful for contemplation . The picture Gabriel had drawn , indeed , threatened serious consequences , and would indubitably have led to them , but luckily at that moment a light footstep crossed the threshold , and Dolly , running in , threw her arms round her old father ’s neck and hugged him tight . ‘
154806	154810	154801	154801	she	3717	’ cried Gabriel . ‘
154828	155243	154817	154817	Doll	216	’ How well she looked ? Well ? Why , if he had exhausted every laudatory adjective in the dictionary , it would n’t have been praise enough . When and where was there ever such a plump , roguish , comely , bright - eyed , enticing , bewitching , captivating , maddening little puss in all this world , as Dolly ! What was the Dolly of five years ago , to the Dolly of that day ! How many coachmakers , saddlers , cabinet - makers , and professors of other useful arts , had deserted their fathers , mothers , sisters , brothers , and , most of all , their cousins , for the love of her ! How many unknown gentlemen -- supposed to be of mighty fortunes , if not titles -- had waited round the corner after dark , and tempted Miggs the incorruptible , with golden guineas , to deliver offers of marriage folded up in love - letters ! How many disconsolate fathers and substantial tradesmen had waited on the locksmith for the same purpose , with dismal tales of how their sons had lost their appetites , and taken to shut themselves up in dark bedrooms , and wandering in desolate suburbs with pale faces , and all because of Dolly Varden ’s loveliness and cruelty ! How many young men , in all previous times of unprecedented steadiness , had turned suddenly wild and wicked for the same reason , and , in an ecstasy of unrequited love , taken to wrench off door - knockers , and invert the boxes of rheumatic watchmen ! How had she recruited the king ’s service , both by sea and land , through rendering desperate his loving subjects between the ages of eighteen and twenty - five ! How many young ladies had publicly professed , with tears in their eyes , that for their tastes she was much too short , too tall , too bold , too cold , too stout , too thin , too fair , too dark -- too everything but handsome ! How many old ladies , taking counsel together , had thanked Heaven their daughters were not like her , and had hoped she might come to no harm , and had thought she would come to no good , and had wondered what people saw in her , and had arrived at the conclusion that she was ‘
155246	155442	154817	154817	Doll	216	’ in her looks , or had never come on in them , and that she was a thorough imposition and a popular mistake ! And yet here was this same Dolly Varden , so whimsical and hard to please that she was Dolly Varden still , all smiles and dimples and pleasant looks , and caring no more for the fifty or sixty young fellows who at that very moment were breaking their hearts to marry her , than if so many oysters had been crossed in love and opened afterwards . Dolly hugged her father as has been already stated , and having hugged her mother also , accompanied both into the little parlour where the cloth was already laid for dinner , and where Miss Miggs -- a trifle more rigid and bony than of yore -- received her with a sort of hysterical gasp , intended for a smile . Into the hands of that young virgin , she delivered her bonnet and walking dress ( all of a dreadful , artful , and designing kind ) , and then said with a laugh , which rivalled the locksmith ’s music , ‘
155454	155455	155445	155445	I	0	’ ‘
155465	155480	155463	155463	Doll	216	’ said her father , putting back the dark hair from her sparkling eyes , ‘
155492	155519	155520	155520	I	0	’ If there had been anybody of the male kind there to see her do it -- but there was not -- it was a mercy . ‘
155530	155535	155520	155520	I	0	’ said the locksmith , ‘
155558	155559	155556	155556	Doll	216	’ ‘
155571	155576	155567	155567	you	216	’ replied his daughter . ‘
155584	155585	155580	155580	you	216	’ ‘
155588	155593	155580	155580	you	216	’ cried the locksmith . ‘
155598	155599	155580	155580	you	216	’ ‘
155604	155608	155609	155609	you	216	’ said Dolly , ‘
155671	155672	155673	155674	Miss Emma	230	’ ‘
155685	155690	155681	155681	I	0	’ returned the locksmith . ‘
155697	155701	155691	155691	I	0	’ said Dolly ; ‘
155757	155758	155753	155753	your	0	’ ‘
155784	155789	155779	155779	you	0	’ returned the locksmith , ‘
155827	155828	155821	155821	he	206	’ ‘
155831	155835	155821	155821	he	206	’ said Dolly . ‘
155840	155849	155837	155837	I	0	’ resumed the locksmith , pinching her cheek , ‘
155904	156101	156102	156106	Great Britain drenched in gore	3729	’ Dolly might have remonstrated against this summary dismissal of the subject , notwithstanding the appearance of dinner , but at the mention of Blue Beard Mrs Varden interposed , protesting she could not find it in her conscience to sit tamely by , and hear her child recommended to peruse the adventures of a Turk and Mussulman -- far less of a fabulous Turk , which she considered that potentate to be . She held that , in such stirring and tremendous times as those in which they lived , it would be much more to the purpose if Dolly became a regular subscriber to the Thunderer , where she would have an opportunity of reading Lord George Gordon ’s speeches word for word , which would be a greater comfort and solace to her , than a hundred and fifty Blue Beards ever could impart . She appealed in support of this proposition to Miss Miggs , then in waiting , who said that indeed the peace of mind she had derived from the perusal of that paper generally , but especially of one article of the very last week as ever was , entitled ‘
156108	156368	156102	156106	Great Britain drenched in gore	3729	’ exceeded all belief ; the same composition , she added , had also wrought such a comforting effect on the mind of a married sister of hers , then resident at Golden Lion Court , number twenty - sivin , second bell - handle on the right - hand door - post , that , being in a delicate state of health , and in fact expecting an addition to her family , she had been seized with fits directly after its perusal , and had raved of the Inquisition ever since ; to the great improvement of her husband and friends . Miss Miggs went on to say that she would recommend all those whose hearts were hardened to hear Lord George themselves , whom she commended first , in respect of his steady Protestantism , then of his oratory , then of his eyes , then of his nose , then of his legs , and lastly of his figure generally , which she looked upon as fit for any statue , prince , or angel , to which sentiment Mrs Varden fully subscribed . Mrs Varden having cut in , looked at a box upon the mantelshelf , painted in imitation of a very red - brick dwelling - house , with a yellow roof ; having at top a real chimney , down which voluntary subscribers dropped their silver , gold , or pence , into the parlour ; and on the door the counterfeit presentment of a brass plate , whereon was legibly inscribed ‘
156537	156542	156544	156544	Miggs	239	‘ Oh , mim , ’
156546	156585	156587	156587	Miggs	239	‘ do n’t relude to that . I had no intentions , mim , that nobody should know . Such sacrifices as I can make , are quite a widder ’s mite . It ’s all I have , ’
156620	156720	156721	156721	You	239	’ This was quite true , though not perhaps in the sense that Miggs intended . As she never failed to keep her self - denial full in Mrs Varden ’s view , it drew forth so many gifts of caps and gowns and other articles of dress , that upon the whole the red - brick house was perhaps the best investment for her small capital she could possibly have hit upon ; returning her interest , at the rate of seven or eight per cent in money , and fifty at least in personal repute and credit . ‘
156728	156737	156721	156721	You	239	’ said Mrs Varden , herself in tears ; ‘
156756	156974	156747	156749	your poor mistress	3736	’ Miggs howled at this remark , in a peculiarly dismal way , and said she knowed that master hated her . That it was a dreadful thing to live in families and have dislikes , and not give satisfactions . That to make divisions was a thing she could not abear to think of , neither could her feelings let her do it . That if it was master ’s wishes as she and him should part , it was best they should part , and she hoped he might be the happier for it , and always wished him well , and that he might find somebody as would meet his dispositions . It would be a hard trial , she said , to part from such a missis , but she could meet any suffering when her conscience told her she was in the rights , and therefore she was willing even to go that lengths . She did not think , she added , that she could long survive the separations , but , as she was hated and looked upon unpleasant , perhaps her dying as soon as possible would be the best endings for all parties . With this affecting conclusion , Miss Miggs shed more tears , and sobbed abundantly . ‘
156982	156998	156980	156980	Varden	219	’ said his wife in a solemn voice , laying down her knife and fork . ‘
157008	157013	156980	156980	Varden	219	’ rejoined the locksmith , ‘
157022	157023	157015	157015	I	0	’ ‘
157036	157040	157034	157034	mim	7753	’ sobbed Miggs . ‘
157077	157189	157059	157059	me!--and	3741	’ Lest the reader should be at any loss to discover the cause of Miss Miggs ’s deep emotion , it may be whispered apart that , happening to be listening , as her custom sometimes was , when Gabriel and his wife conversed together , she had heard the locksmith ’s joke relative to the foreign black who played the tambourine , and bursting with the spiteful feelings which the taunt awoke in her fair breast , exploded in the manner we have witnessed . Matters having now arrived at a crisis , the locksmith , as usual , and for the sake of peace and quietness , gave in . ‘
157198	157202	157192	157192	you	0	’ he said . ‘
157253	157563	157565	157565	Christians	351	’ The allied powers deeming it good generalship to consider this a sufficient apology on the part of the enemy , and confession of having been in the wrong , did dry their eyes and take it in good part . Miss Miggs observed that she bore no malice , no not to her greatest foe , whom she rather loved the more indeed , the greater persecution she sustained . Mrs Varden approved of this meek and forgiving spirit in high terms , and incidentally declared as a closing article of agreement , that Dolly should accompany her to the Clerkenwell branch of the association , that very night . This was an extraordinary instance of her great prudence and policy ; having had this end in view from the first , and entertaining a secret misgiving that the locksmith ( who was bold when Dolly was in question ) would object , she had backed Miss Miggs up to this point , in order that she might have him at a disadvantage . The manoeuvre succeeded so well that Gabriel only made a wry face , and with the warning he had just had , fresh in his mind , did not dare to say one word . The difference ended , therefore , in Miggs being presented with a gown by Mrs Varden and half - a - crown by Dolly , as if she had eminently distinguished herself in the paths of morality and goodness . Mrs V. , according to custom , expressed her hope that Varden would take a lesson from what had passed and learn more generous conduct for the time to come ; and the dinner being now cold and nobody ’s appetite very much improved by what had passed , they went on with it , as Mrs Varden said , ‘
157567	157711	157565	157565	Christians	351	’ As there was to be a grand parade of the Royal East London Volunteers that afternoon , the locksmith did no more work ; but sat down comfortably with his pipe in his mouth , and his arm round his pretty daughter ’s waist , looking lovingly on Mrs V. , from time to time , and exhibiting from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot , one smiling surface of good humour . And to be sure , when it was time to dress him in his regimentals , and Dolly , hanging about him in all kinds of graceful winning ways , helped to button and buckle and brush him up and get him into one of the tightest coats that ever was made by mortal tailor , he was the proudest father in all England . ‘
157719	157771	157713	157715	a handy jade	3745	’ said the locksmith to Mrs Varden , who stood by with folded hands -- rather proud of her husband too -- while Miggs held his cap and sword at arm ’s length , as if mistrusting that the latter might run some one through the body of its own accord ; ‘
157783	157810	157778	157778	Doll	3747	’ Dolly did n’t ask why not , or say a word , indeed , but stooped her head down very low to tie his sash . ‘
157817	157822	157778	157778	Doll	3747	’ said honest Gabriel , ‘
157858	157884	157885	157886	Poor Joe	197	’ Dolly laughed -- not like herself at all -- the strangest little laugh that could be -- and held her head down lower still . ‘
157888	157897	157885	157886	Poor Joe	197	’ resumed the locksmith , muttering to himself ; ‘
157949	157984	157940	157940	you	704	’ What an ill - made sash it was ! There it was , loose again and trailing on the ground . Dolly was obliged to kneel down , and recommence at the beginning . ‘
157992	157998	157987	157988	young Willet	197	’ said his wife frowning ; ‘
158013	158025	158010	158010	I	0	’ Miss Miggs gave a great sniff to the same effect . ‘
158030	158035	158028	158028	Martha	213	’ cried the locksmith , ‘
158061	158062	158063	158064	A runaway	3756	’ ‘
158069	158082	158083	158084	A runaway	3756	’ said Mrs Varden . Miss Miggs expressed her concurrence as before . ‘
158094	158103	158104	158104	He	3751	’ returned the locksmith in a gentle tone . ‘
158131	158141	158129	158129	Martha	213	’ Mrs Varden coughed -- and so did Miggs . ‘
158158	158169	158173	158173	he	3751	’ said the locksmith smiling , and stroking his chin . ‘
158241	158249	158239	158239	Joe	197	’ pursued the locksmith , musing sorrowfully , ‘
158255	158256	158252	158253	Poor Joe	353	’ ‘
158262	158266	158259	158259	I	0	’ cried Miggs . ‘
158273	158274	158271	158271	me	0	’ ‘
158281	158290	158271	158271	me	0	’ said Gabriel , turning sharply to her . ‘
158299	158312	158296	158297	Miss Dolly	3767	’ said the handmaid , stooping down to look into her face , ‘
158337	158357	158359	158359	you	7320	’ cried the susceptible damsel , pressing her hand upon her side to quell the palpitation of her heart , ‘
158368	158417	158359	158359	you	7320	’ The locksmith , after glancing at Miss Miggs as if he could have wished to have a feather brought straightway , looked on with a broad stare while Dolly hurried away , followed by that sympathising young woman : then turning to his wife , stammered out , ‘
158432	158433	158434	158434	Your	7320	’ ‘
158437	158443	158434	158434	Your	7320	’ cried Mrs V. reproachfully . ‘
158453	158454	158446	158446	you	7320	’ ‘
158460	158465	158457	158457	I	0	’ said poor Gabriel . ‘
158491	158535	158489	158489	I	0	’ Mrs Varden merely replied that she had no patience with him , and bounced off after the other two . The unfortunate locksmith wound his sash about him , girded on his sword , put on his cap , and walked out . ‘
158547	158554	158536	158536	I	0	’ he said under his breath , ‘
158597	158860	158578	158578	my	0	’ But he forgot it before he reached the end of the street , and went on with a shining face , nodding to the neighbours , and showering about his friendly greetings like mild spring rain . Chapter 42 The Royal East London Volunteers made a brilliant sight that day : formed into lines , squares , circles , triangles , and what not , to the beating of drums , and the streaming of flags ; and performed a vast number of complex evolutions , in all of which Serjeant Varden bore a conspicuous share . Having displayed their military prowess to the utmost in these warlike shows , they marched in glittering order to the Chelsea Bun House , and regaled in the adjacent taverns until dark . Then at sound of drum they fell in again , and returned amidst the shouting of His Majesty ’s lieges to the place from whence they came . The homeward march being somewhat tardy,--owing to the un - soldierlike behaviour of certain corporals , who , being gentlemen of sedentary pursuits in private life and excitable out of doors , broke several windows with their bayonets , and rendered it imperative on the commanding officer to deliver them over to a strong guard , with whom they fought at intervals as they came along,--it was nine o’clock when the locksmith reached home . A hackney - coach was waiting near his door ; and as he passed it , Mr Haredale looked from the window and called him by his name . ‘
158873	158883	158871	158871	sir	7320	’ said the locksmith , stepping up to him . ‘
158897	158898	158886	158886	you	3772	’ ‘
158908	158913	158901	158901	nobody	7945	’ Mr Haredale answered ; ‘
158926	158927	158916	158916	I	0	’ ‘
158930	158941	158916	158916	I	0	’ muttered the locksmith , looking round at his house . ‘
158954	159006	159007	159007	Varden	219	’ Mr Haredale invited him to come into the coach , and , if he were not tired or anxious to go home , to ride with him a little way that they might have some talk together . Gabriel cheerfully complied , and the coachman mounting his box drove off . ‘
159009	159020	159007	159007	Varden	219	’ said Mr Haredale , after a minute ’s pause , ‘
159041	159042	159043	159043	I	0	’ ‘
159062	159067	159073	159073	yours	7320	’ replied the locksmith ; ‘

159095	159096	159078	159078	you	7320	’ ‘
159107	159113	159078	159078	you	7320	’ said the locksmith dubiously . ‘
159171	159172	159166	159166	sir	7320	’ ‘
159179	159184	159166	159166	sir	7320	’ he returned impatiently . ‘
159193	159194	159166	159166	sir	7320	’ ‘
159198	159203	159166	159166	sir	7320	’ rejoined the locksmith , ‘
159265	159266	159267	159267	Varden	219	’ ‘
159273	159278	159267	159267	Varden	219	’ said Mr Haredale , ‘
159361	159406	159433	159438	the victim of some hideous fancy	3790	’ His voice was so altered from its usual tones , and his manner bespoke so much emotion , that Gabriel , in his wonder , could only sit and look towards him in the darkness , and fancy the expression of his face . ‘
159412	159417	159433	159438	the victim of some hideous fancy	3790	’ continued Mr Haredale , ‘
159474	159475	159550	159550	You	219	’ ‘
159481	159489	159479	159479	sir	7320	’ said the locksmith after a pause , ‘
159498	159510	159479	159479	sir	7320	’ Mr Haredale hesitated for some moments , and then replied : ‘
159528	159549	159550	159550	You	219	’ As though he feared that Varden might express surprise , or reason with him , he hastily went on : ‘
159645	159646	159637	159637	I	0	’ ‘
159651	159656	159637	159637	I	0	’ asked the locksmith . ‘
159663	159667	159637	159637	I	0	’ he replied ; ‘
159780	159941	159771	159771	your	219	’ With that , as if to change the theme , he led the astounded locksmith back to the night of the Maypole highwayman , to the robbery of Edward Chester , to the reappearance of the man at Mrs Rudge ’s house , and to all the strange circumstances which afterwards occurred . He even asked him carelessly about the man ’s height , his face , his figure , whether he was like any one he had ever seen -- like Hugh , for instance , or any man he had known at any time -- and put many questions of that sort , which the locksmith , considering them as mere devices to engage his attention and prevent his expressing the astonishment he felt , answered pretty much at random . At length , they arrived at the corner of the street in which the house stood , where Mr Haredale , alighting , dismissed the coach . ‘
159951	159964	159965	159965	you	3799	’ he said , turning to the locksmith with a gloomy smile , ‘
159968	160179	159965	159965	you	3799	’ Gabriel , to whom all former marvels had been nothing in comparison with this , followed him along the narrow pavement in silence . When they reached the door , Mr Haredale softly opened it with a key he had about him , and closing it when Varden entered , they were left in thorough darkness . They groped their way into the ground - floor room . Here Mr Haredale struck a light , and kindled a pocket taper he had brought with him for the purpose . It was then , when the flame was full upon him , that the locksmith saw for the first time how haggard , pale , and changed he looked ; how worn and thin he was ; how perfectly his whole appearance coincided with all that he had said so strangely as they rode along . It was not an unnatural impulse in Gabriel , after what he had heard , to note curiously the expression of his eyes . It was perfectly collected and rational;--so much so , indeed , that he felt ashamed of his momentary suspicion , and drooped his own when Mr Haredale looked towards him , as if he feared they would betray his thoughts . ‘
160187	160209	159965	159965	you	3799	’ said Mr Haredale , with a glance towards the window , the crazy shutters of which were closed and fastened . ‘
160213	160239	159965	159965	you	3799	’ There was a kind of awe about the place , which would have rendered it difficult to speak in any other manner . Gabriel whispered ‘
160242	160565	159965	159965	you	3799	’ and followed him upstairs . Everything was just as they had seen it last . There was a sense of closeness from the exclusion of fresh air , and a gloom and heaviness around , as though long imprisonment had made the very silence sad . The homely hangings of the beds and windows had begun to droop ; the dust lay thick upon their dwindling folds ; and damps had made their way through ceiling , wall , and floor . The boards creaked beneath their tread , as if resenting the unaccustomed intrusion ; nimble spiders , paralysed by the taper ’s glare , checked the motion of their hundred legs upon the wall , or dropped like lifeless things upon the ground ; the death - watch ticked ; and the scampering feet of rats and mice rattled behind the wainscot . As they looked about them on the decaying furniture , it was strange to find how vividly it presented those to whom it had belonged , and with whom it was once familiar . Grip seemed to perch again upon his high - backed chair ; Barnaby to crouch in his old favourite corner by the fire ; the mother to resume her usual seat , and watch him as of old . Even when they could separate these objects from the phantoms of the mind which they invoked , the latter only glided out of sight , but lingered near them still ; for then they seemed to lurk in closets and behind the doors , ready to start out and suddenly accost them in well - remembered tones . They went downstairs , and again into the room they had just now left . Mr Haredale unbuckled his sword and laid it on the table , with a pair of pocket pistols ; then told the locksmith he would light him to the door . ‘
160575	160580	159965	159965	you	3799	’ said Gabriel lingering ; ‘
160588	162224	162225	162225	Haredale	206	’ He shook his head , and so plainly evinced his wish to be alone , that Gabriel could say no more . In another moment the locksmith was standing in the street , whence he could see that the light once more travelled upstairs , and soon returning to the room below , shone brightly through the chinks of the shutters . If ever man were sorely puzzled and perplexed , the locksmith was , that night . Even when snugly seated by his own fireside , with Mrs Varden opposite in a nightcap and night - jacket , and Dolly beside him ( in a most distracting dishabille ) curling her hair , and smiling as if she had never cried in all her life and never could -- even then , with Toby at his elbow and his pipe in his mouth , and Miggs ( but that perhaps was not much ) falling asleep in the background , he could not quite discard his wonder and uneasiness . So in his dreams -- still there was Mr Haredale , haggard and careworn , listening in the solitary house to every sound that stirred , with the taper shining through the chinks until the day should turn it pale and end his lonely watching . Chapter 43 Next morning brought no satisfaction to the locksmith ’s thoughts , nor next day , nor the next , nor many others . Often after nightfall he entered the street , and turned his eyes towards the well - known house ; and as surely as he did so , there was the solitary light , still gleaming through the crevices of the window - shutter , while all within was motionless , noiseless , cheerless , as a grave . Unwilling to hazard Mr Haredale ’s favour by disobeying his strict injunction , he never ventured to knock at the door or to make his presence known in any way . But whenever strong interest and curiosity attracted him to the spot -- which was not seldom -- the light was always there . If he could have known what passed within , the knowledge would have yielded him no clue to this mysterious vigil . At twilight , Mr Haredale shut himself up , and at daybreak he came forth . He never missed a night , always came and went alone , and never varied his proceedings in the least degree . The manner of his watch was this . At dusk , he entered the house in the same way as when the locksmith bore him company , kindled a light , went through the rooms , and narrowly examined them . That done , he returned to the chamber on the ground - floor , and laying his sword and pistols on the table , sat by it until morning . He usually had a book with him , and often tried to read , but never fixed his eyes or thoughts upon it for five minutes together . The slightest noise without doors , caught his ear ; a step upon the pavement seemed to make his heart leap . He was not without some refreshment during the long lonely hours ; generally carrying in his pocket a sandwich of bread and meat , and a small flask of wine . The latter diluted with large quantities of water , he drank in a heated , feverish way , as though his throat were dried ; but he scarcely ever broke his fast , by so much as a crumb of bread . If this voluntary sacrifice of sleep and comfort had its origin , as the locksmith on consideration was disposed to think , in any superstitious expectation of the fulfilment of a dream or vision connected with the event on which he had brooded for so many years , and if he waited for some ghostly visitor who walked abroad when men lay sleeping in their beds , he showed no trace of fear or wavering . His stern features expressed inflexible resolution ; his brows were puckered , and his lips compressed , with deep and settled purpose ; and when he started at a noise and listened , it was not with the start of fear but hope , and catching up his sword as though the hour had come at last , he would clutch it in his tight - clenched hand , and listen with sparkling eyes and eager looks , until it died away . These disappointments were numerous , for they ensued on almost every sound , but his constancy was not shaken . Still , every night he was at his post , the same stern , sleepless , sentinel ; and still night passed , and morning dawned , and he must watch again . This went on for weeks ; he had taken a lodging at Vauxhall in which to pass the day and rest himself ; and from this place , when the tide served , he usually came to London Bridge from Westminster by water , in order that he might avoid the busy streets . One evening , shortly before twilight , he came his accustomed road upon the river ’s bank , intending to pass through Westminster Hall into Palace Yard , and there take boat to London Bridge as usual . There was a pretty large concourse of people assembled round the Houses of Parliament , looking at the members as they entered and departed , and giving vent to rather noisy demonstrations of approval or dislike , according to their known opinions . As he made his way among the throng , he heard once or twice the No - Popery cry , which was then becoming pretty familiar to the ears of most men ; but holding it in very slight regard , and observing that the idlers were of the lowest grade , he neither thought nor cared about it , but made his way along , with perfect indifference . There were many little knots and groups of persons in Westminster Hall : some few looking upward at its noble ceiling , and at the rays of evening light , tinted by the setting sun , which streamed in aslant through its small windows , and growing dimmer by degrees , were quenched in the gathering gloom below ; some , noisy passengers , mechanics going home from work , and otherwise , who hurried quickly through , waking the echoes with their voices , and soon darkening the small door in the distance , as they passed into the street beyond ; some , in busy conference together on political or private matters , pacing slowly up and down with eyes that sought the ground , and seeming , by their attitudes , to listen earnestly from head to foot . Here , a dozen squabbling urchins made a very Babel in the air ; there , a solitary man , half clerk , half mendicant , paced up and down with hungry dejection in his look and gait ; at his elbow passed an errand - lad , swinging his basket round and round , and with his shrill whistle riving the very timbers of the roof ; while a more observant schoolboy , half - way through , pocketed his ball , and eyed the distant beadle as he came looming on . It was that time of evening when , if you shut your eyes and open them again , the darkness of an hour appears to have gathered in a second . The smooth - worn pavement , dusty with footsteps , still called upon the lofty walls to reiterate the shuffle and the tread of feet unceasingly , save when the closing of some heavy door resounded through the building like a clap of thunder , and drowned all other noises in its rolling sound . Mr Haredale , glancing only at such of these groups as he passed nearest to , and then in a manner betokening that his thoughts were elsewhere , had nearly traversed the Hall , when two persons before him caught his attention . One of these , a gentleman in elegant attire , carried in his hand a cane , which he twirled in a jaunty manner as he loitered on ; the other , an obsequious , crouching , fawning figure , listened to what he said -- at times throwing in a humble word himself -- and , with his shoulders shrugged up to his ears , rubbed his hands submissively , or answered at intervals by an inclination of the head , half - way between a nod of acquiescence , and a bow of most profound respect . In the abstract there was nothing very remarkable in this pair , for servility waiting on a handsome suit of clothes and a cane -- not to speak of gold and silver sticks , or wands of office -- is common enough . But there was that about the well - dressed man , yes , and about the other likewise , which struck Mr Haredale with no pleasant feeling . He hesitated , stopped , and would have stepped aside and turned out of his path , but at the moment , the other two faced about quickly , and stumbled upon him before he could avoid them . The gentleman with the cane lifted his hat and had begun to tender an apology , which Mr Haredale had begun as hastily to acknowledge and walk away , when he stopped short and cried , ‘
162236	162237	162225	162225	Haredale	206	’ ‘
162241	162246	162225	162225	Haredale	206	’ he returned impatiently ; ‘
162250	162251	162252	162254	My dear friend	9039	’ ‘
162256	162264	162252	162254	My dear friend	9039	’ cried the other , detaining him , ‘
162282	162283	162273	162273	Haredale	206	’ ‘
162289	162293	162284	162284	I	0	’ he said . ‘
162312	162313	162284	162284	I	0	’ ‘
162318	162329	162284	162284	I	0	’ replied Sir John ( for it was he ) , ‘
162381	162526	162527	162528	Mr Gashford	326	’ The friend , plainly very ill at ease , had made bold to press Sir John ’s arm , and to give him other significant hints that he was desirous of avoiding this introduction . As it did not suit Sir John ’s purpose , however , that it should be evaded , he appeared quite unconscious of these silent remonstrances , and inclined his hand towards him , as he spoke , to call attention to him more particularly . The friend , therefore , had nothing for it , but to muster up the pleasantest smile he could , and to make a conciliatory bow , as Mr Haredale turned his eyes upon him . Seeing that he was recognised , he put out his hand in an awkward and embarrassed manner , which was not mended by its contemptuous rejection . ‘
162530	162536	162527	162528	Mr Gashford	326	’ said Haredale , coldly . ‘
162602	162637	162584	162584	I	0	’ The secretary rubbed his hands and bowed , as though he would disarm his adversary by humbling himself before him . Sir John Chester again exclaimed , with an air of great gaiety , ‘
162649	162663	162664	162665	Mr Haredale	206	’ and took a pinch of snuff with his usual self - possession . ‘
162667	162690	162664	162665	Mr Haredale	206	’ said Gashford , stealthily raising his eyes , and letting them drop again when they met the other ’s steady gaze , ‘
162747	162748	162751	162751	sir	7320	’ ‘
162753	162766	162767	162767	You	7320	’ he rejoined with a sarcastic smile , finding the secretary stopped . ‘
162786	162794	162796	162797	Sir John	342	‘ No , but let us really , ’
162802	162917	162796	162797	Sir John	342	‘ let us really , for a moment , contemplate the very remarkable character of this meeting . Haredale , my dear friend , pardon me if I think you are not sufficiently impressed with its singularity . Here we stand , by no previous appointment or arrangement , three old schoolfellows , in Westminster Hall ; three old boarders in a remarkably dull and shady seminary at Saint Omer ’s , where you , being Catholics and of necessity educated out of England , were brought up ; and where I , being a promising young Protestant at that time , was sent to learn the French tongue from a native of Paris ! ’
162918	162927	162929	162930	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Add to the singularity , Sir John , ’
162932	163094	162929	162930	Mr Haredale	206	‘ that some of you Protestants of promise are at this moment leagued in yonder building , to prevent our having the surpassing and unheard - of privilege of teaching our children to read and write -- here -- in this land , where thousands of us enter your service every year , and to preserve the freedom of which , we die in bloody battles abroad , in heaps : and that others of you , to the number of some thousands as I learn , are led on to look on all men of my creed as wolves and beasts of prey , by this man Gashford . Add to it besides the bare fact that this man lives in society , walks the streets in broad day -- I was about to say , holds up his head , but that he does not -- and it will be strange , and very strange , I grant you . ’
163095	163105	163107	163108	Sir John	342	‘ Oh ! you are hard upon our friend , ’
163115	163125	163107	163108	Sir John	342	‘ You are really very hard upon our friend ! ’
163126	163135	163137	163137	Gashford	326	‘ Let him go on , Sir John , ’
163144	163193	163137	163137	Gashford	326	‘ Let him go on . I can make allowances , Sir John . I am honoured with your good opinion , and I can dispense with Mr Haredale ’s . Mr Haredale is a sufferer from the penal laws , and I ca n’t expect his favour . ’
163194	163205	163207	163208	Mr Haredale	206	‘ You have so much of my favour , sir , ’
163222	163247	163207	163208	Mr Haredale	206	‘ that I am glad to see you in such good company . You are the essence of your great Association , in yourselves . ’
163248	163255	163257	163258	Sir John	342	‘ Now , there you mistake , ’
163266	163382	163261	163261	his	342	‘ There -- which is a most remarkable circumstance for a man of your punctuality and exactness , Haredale -- you fall into error . I do n’t belong to the body ; I have an immense respect for its members , but I do n’t belong to it ; although I am , it is certainly true , the conscientious opponent of your being relieved . I feel it my duty to be so ; it is a most unfortunate necessity ; and cost me a bitter struggle.--Will you try this box ? If you do n’t object to a trifling infusion of a very chaste scent , you ’ll find its flavour exquisite . ’
163383	163392	163394	163395	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I ask your pardon , Sir John , ’
163407	163455	163394	163395	Mr Haredale	206	‘ for having ranked you among the humble instruments who are obvious and in all men ’s sight . I should have done more justice to your genius . Men of your capacity plot in secrecy and safety , and leave exposed posts to the duller wits . ’
163456	163465	163467	163468	Sir John	342	‘ Do n’t apologise , for the world , ’
163471	163492	163467	163468	Sir John	342	‘ old friends like you and I , may be allowed some freedoms , or the deuce is in it . ’
163538	163547	163549	163550	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Do n’t distress yourself , good sir , ’
163552	163565	163567	163567	he	206	‘ I ’ll take my leave , and put you at your ease-- ’
163834	163837	163826	163831	those who were outside the crowd	3824	‘ Silence , ’
163839	163843	163826	163831	those who were outside the crowd	3824	‘ Stand back , ’
163989	163996	163998	164000	Sir John Chester	342	‘ Mr Haredale , Lord George , ’
164013	164048	163998	164000	Sir John Chester	342	‘ A Catholic gentleman unfortunately -- most unhappily a Catholic -- but an esteemed acquaintance of mine , and once of Mr Gashford ’s . My dear Haredale , this is Lord George Gordon . ’
164049	164066	164068	164069	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I should have known that , had I been ignorant of his lordship ’s person , ’
164071	164120	164068	164069	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I hope there is but one gentleman in England who , addressing an ignorant and excited throng , would speak of a large body of his fellow - subjects in such injurious language as I heard this moment . For shame , my lord , for shame ! ’
164121	164131	164142	164142	his	323	‘ I can not talk to you , sir , ’
164151	164158	164142	164142	his	323	‘ we have nothing in common . ’
164159	164176	164178	164179	Mr Haredale	206	‘ We have much in common -- many things -- all that the Almighty gave us , ’
164181	164242	164178	164179	Mr Haredale	206	‘ and common charity , not to say common sense and common decency , should teach you to refrain from these proceedings . If every one of those men had arms in their hands at this moment , as they have them in their heads , I would not leave this place without telling you that you disgrace your station . ’
164243	164252	164253	164253	he	206	‘ I do n’t hear you , sir , ’
164262	164284	164253	164253	he	206	‘ I ca n’t hear you . It is indifferent to me what you say . Do n’t retort , Gashford , ’
164298	164310	164316	164316	he	206	‘ I can hold no communion with the worshippers of idols . ’
164351	164355	164357	164357	Haredale	206	‘ HE retort ! ’
164359	164373	164357	164357	Haredale	206	‘ Look you here , my lord . Do you know this man ? ’
164398	164402	164404	164405	Mr Haredale	206	‘ This man , ’
164414	164558	164404	164405	Mr Haredale	206	‘ who in his boyhood was a thief , and has been from that time to this , a servile , false , and truckling knave : this man , who has crawled and crept through life , wounding the hands he licked , and biting those he fawned upon : this sycophant , who never knew what honour , truth , or courage meant ; who robbed his benefactor ’s daughter of her virtue , and married her to break her heart , and did it , with stripes and cruelty : this creature , who has whined at kitchen windows for the broken food , and begged for halfpence at our chapel doors : this apostle of the faith , whose tender conscience can not bear the altars where his vicious life was publicly denounced -- Do you know this man ? ’
164559	164574	164576	164577	Sir John	342	‘ Oh , really -- you are very , very hard upon our friend ! ’
164579	164586	164588	164588	Gashford	326	‘ Let Mr Haredale go on , ’
164608	164657	164588	164588	Gashford	326	‘ I do n’t mind him , Sir John ; it ’s quite as indifferent to me what he says , as it is to my lord . If he reviles my lord , as you have heard , Sir John , how can I hope to escape ? ’
164658	164667	164668	164669	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Is it not enough , my lord , ’
164672	164756	164668	164669	Mr Haredale	206	‘ that I , as good a gentleman as you , must hold my property , such as it is , by a trick at which the state connives because of these hard laws ; and that we may not teach our youth in schools the common principles of right and wrong ; but must we be denounced and ridden by such men as this ! Here is a man to head your No - Popery cry ! For shame . For shame ! ’
164799	164806	164807	164807	He	342	‘ Oh dear me ! no . ’
164826	164903	164807	164807	He	342	‘ I have nothing to say , sir , in reply , and no desire to hear anything more . I beg you wo n’t obtrude your conversation , or these personal attacks , upon me . I shall not be deterred from doing my duty to my country and my countrymen , by any such attempts , whether they proceed from emissaries of the Pope or not , I assure you . Come , Gashford ! ’
165118	165124	165073	165073	himself	7287	‘ Down with the Papists ! ’
165150	165154	165145	165146	one man	1808	‘ Stone him ; ’
165157	165161	165145	165146	one man	1808	‘ Duck him ; ’
165169	165173	165145	165146	one man	1808	‘ No Popery ! ’
165322	165335	165299	165299	He	206	‘ Who did that ? Show me the man who hit me . ’
165367	165372	165373	165373	he	206	‘ Who did that ? ’
165376	165405	165373	165373	he	206	‘ Show me the man who did it . Dog , was it you ? It was your deed , if not your hand -- I know you . ’
165452	165460	165463	165465	one of you	3855	‘ My lord -- Sir John,’--he cried , ‘
165487	165587	165588	165588	My	0	’ With that he struck Sir John upon the breast with the flat of his weapon , and with a burning face and flashing eyes stood upon his guard ; alone , before them all . For an instant , for the briefest space of time the mind can readily conceive , there was a change in Sir John ’s smooth face , such as no man ever saw there . The next moment , he stepped forward , and laid one hand on Mr Haredale ’s arm , while with the other he endeavoured to appease the crowd . ‘
165619	165620	165621	165621	I	0	’ ‘
165632	165641	165642	165643	Sir John	342	’ he retorted , almost mad with rage . ‘
165657	165658	165649	165649	you	342	’ ‘
165664	165683	165662	165662	sir	7320	’ said a man , forcing his way between and pushing him towards the stairs with friendly violence , ‘
165795	166668	166669	166670	Muster Gashford	325	’ Mr Haredale , who began to turn faint and sick , felt how sensible this advice was , and descended the steps with his unknown friend ’s assistance . John Grueby ( for John it was ) helped him into the boat , and giving her a shove off , which sent her thirty feet into the tide , bade the waterman pull away like a Briton ; and walked up again as composedly as if he had just landed . There was at first a slight disposition on the part of the mob to resent this interference ; but John looking particularly strong and cool , and wearing besides Lord George ’s livery , they thought better of it , and contented themselves with sending a shower of small missiles after the boat , which plashed harmlessly in the water ; for she had by this time cleared the bridge , and was darting swiftly down the centre of the stream . From this amusement , they proceeded to giving Protestant knocks at the doors of private houses , breaking a few lamps , and assaulting some stray constables . But , it being whispered that a detachment of Life Guards had been sent for , they took to their heels with great expedition , and left the street quite clear . Chapter 44 When the concourse separated , and , dividing into chance clusters , drew off in various directions , there still remained upon the scene of the late disturbance , one man . This man was Gashford , who , bruised by his late fall , and hurt in a much greater degree by the indignity he had undergone , and the exposure of which he had been the victim , limped up and down , breathing curses and threats of vengeance . It was not the secretary ’s nature to waste his wrath in words . While he vented the froth of his malevolence in those effusions , he kept a steady eye on two men , who , having disappeared with the rest when the alarm was spread , had since returned , and were now visible in the moonlight , at no great distance , as they walked to and fro , and talked together . He made no move towards them , but waited patiently on the dark side of the street , until they were tired of strolling backwards and forwards and walked away in company . Then he followed , but at some distance : keeping them in view , without appearing to have that object , or being seen by them . They went up Parliament Street , past Saint Martin ’s church , and away by Saint Giles ’s to Tottenham Court Road , at the back of which , upon the western side , was then a place called the Green Lanes . This was a retired spot , not of the choicest kind , leading into the fields . Great heaps of ashes ; stagnant pools , overgrown with rank grass and duckweed ; broken turnstiles ; and the upright posts of palings long since carried off for firewood , which menaced all heedless walkers with their jagged and rusty nails ; were the leading features of the landscape : while here and there a donkey , or a ragged horse , tethered to a stake , and cropping off a wretched meal from the coarse stunted turf , were quite in keeping with the scene , and would have suggested ( if the houses had not done so , sufficiently , of themselves ) how very poor the people were who lived in the crazy huts adjacent , and how foolhardy it might prove for one who carried money , or wore decent clothes , to walk that way alone , unless by daylight . Poverty has its whims and shows of taste , as wealth has . Some of these cabins were turreted , some had false windows painted on their rotten walls ; one had a mimic clock , upon a crazy tower of four feet high , which screened the chimney ; each in its little patch of ground had a rude seat or arbour . The population dealt in bones , in rags , in broken glass , in old wheels , in birds , and dogs . These , in their several ways of stowage , filled the gardens ; and shedding a perfume , not of the most delicious nature , in the air , filled it besides with yelps , and screams , and howling . Into this retreat , the secretary followed the two men whom he had held in sight ; and here he saw them safely lodged , in one of the meanest houses , which was but a room , and that of small dimensions . He waited without , until the sound of their voices , joined in a discordant song , assured him they were making merry ; and then approaching the door , by means of a tottering plank which crossed the ditch in front , knocked at it with his hand . ‘
166672	166691	166669	166670	Muster Gashford	325	’ said the man who opened it , taking his pipe from his mouth , in evident surprise . ‘
166714	166801	166712	166712	sir	7320	’ Gashford required no second invitation , and entered with a gracious air . There was a fire in the rusty grate ( for though the spring was pretty far advanced , the nights were cold ) , and on a stool beside it Hugh sat smoking . Dennis placed a chair , his only one , for the secretary , in front of the hearth ; and took his seat again upon the stool he had left when he rose to give the visitor admission . ‘
166812	166828	166809	166810	Muster Gashford	325	’ he said , as he resumed his pipe , and looked at him askew . ‘
166849	166850	166846	166847	Muster Gashford	325	’ ‘
166857	166869	166846	166847	Muster Gashford	325	’ rejoined the secretary , with a friendly nod to Hugh . ‘
166891	166892	166893	166896	A very little one	3876	’ ‘
166898	166903	166893	166896	A very little one	3876	’ growled the hangman . ‘
166910	166911	166913	166913	me	0	’ ‘
166916	166920	166936	166936	master	7428	’ cried Hugh . ‘
166942	166943	166936	166936	master	7428	’ ‘
166950	166968	166936	166936	master	7428	’ said the secretary , with his worst expression of face , and in his mildest tones , ‘
166981	166982	166983	166983	I	0	’ ‘
166989	166993	166994	166994	I	0	’ replied Hugh . ‘
166995	167007	167034	167034	he	9531	’m open to orders . I do n’t care ; not I. ’
167008	167012	167034	167034	he	9531	‘ Nor I ! ’
167016	167020	167022	167023	the secretary	9531	‘ Brave fellows ! ’
167047	167070	167034	167034	he	9531	‘ By the bye’--and here he stopped and warmed his hands : then suddenly looked up--‘who threw that stone to - day ? ’
167084	167089	167076	167076	his	187	‘ A mystery indeed ! ’
167097	167103	167105	167106	the secretary	9531	‘ It was well done ! ’
167113	167122	167105	167106	the secretary	9531	‘ I should like to know that man . ’
167123	167127	167129	167129	Dennis	187	‘ Would you ? ’
167144	167156	167129	167129	Dennis	187	‘ Would you like to know that man , Muster Gashford ? ’
167157	167162	167164	167165	the secretary	9531	‘ I should indeed , ’
167167	167175	167177	167178	the hangman	3437	‘ Why then , Lord love you , ’
167194	167212	167213	167213	he	3437	‘ there he sits . That ’s the man . My stars and halters , Muster Gashford , ’
167234	167271	167220	167220	he	3437	‘ what a interesting blade he is ! He wants as much holding in as a thorough - bred bulldog . If it had n’t been for me to - day , he ’d have had that ‘
167287	167288	167220	167220	he	3437	’ ‘
167293	167308	167220	167220	he	3437	’ cried Hugh in a surly voice , as he overheard this last remark . ‘
167331	167332	167328	167328	I	0	’ ‘
167335	167355	167328	167328	I	0	’ retorted Dennis , shaking his head , with a kind of pity for his friend ’s ingenuous youth ; ‘
167378	167391	167397	167397	I	0	‘ em in the humour . There was n’t quite enough to provoke ‘
167421	167422	167423	167423	Dennis	187	’ ‘
167428	167434	167435	167435	He	187	’ said Gashford , smoothly . ‘
167448	167449	167440	167440	Dennis	187	’ ‘
167472	167509	167510	167510	Dennis	187	’ grinned the hangman , whispering the words behind his hand . The secretary laughed at this jest as much as Dennis could desire , and when he had done , said , turning to Hugh : ‘
167554	167555	167542	167542	I	0	’ ‘
167563	167571	167559	167561	the Lord Harry	358	’ cried Dennis with a noisy laugh , ‘
167631	167639	167627	167627	He	7264	‘ un to play with , is that ‘
167649	167701	167627	167627	He	7264	’ The secretary ’s face , as Dennis roared with laughter , and turned his wrinkled eyes on Hugh who did the like , might have furnished a study for the devil ’s picture . He sat quite silent until they were serious again , and then said , looking round : ‘
167803	167811	167813	167814	the hangman	3437	‘ I believe you , Muster Gashford , ’
167820	167846	167813	167814	the hangman	3437	‘ The uncertainties as I ’ve seen in reference to this here state of existence , the unexpected contingencies as have come about!--Oh my eye ! ’
167868	167872	167874	167875	the secretary	9531	‘ I say , ’
167884	168058	168060	168060	Gashford	325	‘ we ca n’t tell what may come to pass ; and if we should be obliged , against our wills , to have recourse to violence , my lord ( who has suffered terribly to - day , as far as words can go ) consigns to you two -- bearing in mind my recommendation of you both , as good staunch men , beyond all doubt and suspicion -- the pleasant task of punishing this Haredale . You may do as you please with him , or his , provided that you show no mercy , and no quarter , and leave no two beams of his house standing where the builder placed them . You may sack it , burn it , do with it as you like , but it must come down ; it must be razed to the ground ; and he , and all belonging to him , left as shelterless as new - born infants whom their mothers have exposed . Do you understand me ? ’
168071	168077	168079	168079	Hugh	198	‘ Understand you , master ! ’
168081	168093	168079	168079	Hugh	198	‘ You speak plain now . Why , this is hearty ! ’
168094	168102	168104	168104	Gashford	325	‘ I knew you would like it , ’
168112	168167	168168	168168	He	325	‘ I thought you would . Good night ! Do n’t rise , Dennis : I would rather find my way alone . I may have to make other visits here , and it ’s pleasant to come and go without disturbing you . I can find my way perfectly well . Good night ! ’
168196	168205	168206	168206	he	187	‘ This looks a little more like business ! ’
168209	168214	168216	168216	Hugh	198	‘ Ay , indeed ! ’
168218	168223	168216	168216	Hugh	198	‘ this suits me ! ’
168224	168234	168236	168237	the hangman	3437	‘ I ’ve heerd it said of Muster Gashford , ’
168239	168263	168236	168237	the hangman	3437	‘ that he ’d a surprising memory and wonderful firmness -- that he never forgot , and never forgave.--Let ’s drink his health ! ’
169869	169908	169867	169867	himself	220	‘ A brave evening , mother ! If we had , chinking in our pockets , but a few specks of that gold which is piled up yonder in the sky , we should be rich for life . ’
169909	169917	169919	169920	the widow	7604	‘ We are better as we are , ’
169926	169953	169919	169920	the widow	7604	‘ Let us be contented , and we do not want and need not care to have it , though it lay shining at our feet . ’
169954	169957	169959	169959	Barnaby	220	‘ Ay ! ’
169976	170017	169959	169959	Barnaby	220	‘ that ’s well enough , mother ; but gold ’s a good thing to have . I wish that I knew where to find it . Grip and I could do much with gold , be sure of that . ’
170018	170024	170025	170025	she	7604	‘ What would you do ? ’
170028	170112	170025	170025	she	7604	‘ What ! A world of things . We ’d dress finely -- you and I , I mean ; not Grip -- keep horses , dogs , wear bright colours and feathers , do no more work , live delicately and at our ease . Oh , we ’d find uses for it , mother , and uses that would do us good . I would I knew where gold was buried . How hard I ’d work to dig it up ! ’
170113	170119	170126	170126	her	756	‘ You do not know , ’
170136	170171	170126	170126	her	756	‘ what men have done to win it , and how they have found , too late , that it glitters brightest at a distance , and turns quite dim and dull when handled . ’
170172	170185	170186	170186	he	3949	‘ Ay , ay ; so you say ; so you think , ’
170197	170210	170186	170186	he	3949	‘ For all that , mother , I should like to try . ’
170211	170217	170218	170218	she	756	‘ Do you not see , ’
170221	170313	170218	170218	she	756	‘ how red it is ? Nothing bears so many stains of blood , as gold . Avoid it . None have such cause to hate its name as we have . Do not so much as think of it , dear love . It has brought such misery and suffering on your head and mine as few have known , and God grant few may have to undergo . I would rather we were dead and laid down in our graves , than you should ever come to love it . ’
170458	170465	170467	170468	the wayfarer	3955	‘ A blessing on those voices ! ’
170470	170507	170467	170468	the wayfarer	3955	‘ I feel the beauty of the night more keenly , when I hear them . They are like eyes to me . Will they speak again , and cheer the heart of a poor traveller ? ’
170508	170514	170516	170517	the widow	7604	‘ Have you no guide ? ’
170525	170530	170531	170531	he	3951	‘ None but that , ’
170542	170557	170531	170531	he	3951	‘ and sometimes a milder one at night , but she is idle now . ’
170558	170564	170467	170468	the wayfarer	3955	‘ Have you travelled far ? ’
170565	170572	170577	170577	he	3951	‘ A weary way and long , ’
170582	170616	170577	170577	he	3951	‘ A weary , weary , way . I struck my stick just now upon the bucket of your well -- be pleased to let me have a draught of water , lady . ’
170617	170625	170467	170468	the wayfarer	3955	‘ Why do you call me lady ? ’
170629	170637	170467	170468	the wayfarer	3955	‘ I am as poor as you . ’
170638	170652	170654	170655	the man	472	‘ Your speech is soft and gentle , and I judge by that , ’
170657	170687	170654	170655	the man	472	‘ The coarsest stuffs and finest silks , are -- apart from the sense of touch -- alike to me . I can not judge you by your dress . ’
170688	170694	170696	170696	Barnaby	220	‘ Come round this way , ’
170714	170722	170696	170696	Barnaby	220	‘ Put your hand in mine . You ’re
170755	170756	170750	170750	they	3959	’ ‘
170759	170764	170750	170750	they	3959	’ returned the other , ‘
170775	170802	170750	170750	they	3959	’ Barnaby looked curiously at his eyes , and touching them with his fingers , as an inquisitive child might , led him towards the house . ‘
170810	170821	170803	170803	You	220	’ said the widow , meeting him at the door . ‘
170831	170832	170824	170824	you	220	’ ‘
170850	170881	170837	170838	good teachers	3960	’ said the blind man , sitting down upon the chair to which Barnaby had led him , and putting his hat and stick upon the red - tiled floor . ‘
170898	170899	170893	170893	They	3962	’ ‘
170909	170920	170900	170900	You	220	’ said the widow , in a tone of pity . ‘
170925	170945	170900	170900	You	220	’ returned the blind man with a sigh , and yet with something of a smile upon his face , ‘
170974	171117	171119	171119	I	0	’ As he spoke , he raised the mug of water to his mouth . It was clear , and cold , and sparkling , but not to his taste nevertheless , or his thirst was not very great , for he only wetted his lips and put it down again . He wore , hanging with a long strap round his neck , a kind of scrip or wallet , in which to carry food . The widow set some bread and cheese before him , but he thanked her , and said that through the kindness of the charitable he had broken his fast once since morning , and was not hungry . When he had made her this reply , he opened his wallet , and took out a few pence , which was all it appeared to contain . ‘
171125	171137	171119	171119	I	0	’ he said , turning towards where Barnaby stood looking on , ‘
171184	171244	171254	171254	widow	3968	’ Barnaby looked at his mother , who nodded assent ; in another moment he was gone upon his charitable errand . The blind man sat listening with an attentive face , until long after the sound of his retreating footsteps was inaudible to the widow , and then said , suddenly , and in a very altered tone : ‘
171473	171546	171463	171463	you	1503	’ Having delivered himself of this speech with many flourishes of manner , he drew from beneath his coat a flat stone bottle , and holding the cork between his teeth , qualified his mug of water with a plentiful infusion of the liquor it contained . He politely drained the bumper to her health , and the ladies , and setting it down empty , smacked his lips with infinite relish . ‘
171557	171567	171549	171553	a citizen of the world	3983	’ said the blind man , corking his bottle , ‘
171644	171776	171633	171633	I	0	’ With that he slapped his bottle on its broad back , and having put it under his garment as before , crossed his legs and folded his hands , and settled himself in his chair , previous to proceeding any further . The change in his manner was so unexpected , the craft and wickedness of his deportment were so much aggravated by his condition -- for we are accustomed to see in those who have lost a human sense , something in its place almost divine -- and this alteration bred so many fears in her whom he addressed , that she could not pronounce one word . After waiting , as it seemed , for some remark or answer , and waiting in vain , the visitor resumed : ‘
171852	171853	171833	171833	you	3989	’ ‘
171860	171870	171854	171854	You	0	’ said the widow , with a stifled groan ; ‘
171880	171881	171889	171889	ma’am	1503	’ ‘
171891	171903	171884	171887	a man of honour	3994	’ said the blind man , striking himself on the breast , ‘
171929	171947	171956	171956	ma’am	1503	’ he added , seeming to catch with his quick ear the very motion of her hand , ‘
171966	172040	172041	172041	You	1503	’ She moved towards him , and stooped down . He muttered a word in her ear ; and , wringing her hands , she paced up and down the room like one distracted . The blind man , with perfect composure , produced his bottle again , mixed another glassful ; put it up as before ; and , drinking from time to time , followed her with his face in silence . ‘
172049	172061	172047	172047	widow	3968	’ he said after a time , pausing in his draught . ‘
172071	172072	172047	172047	widow	3968	’ ‘
172080	172084	172075	172075	you	0	’ she answered . ‘
172090	172091	172087	172087	you	0	’ ‘
172102	172120	172121	172121	Poor	4002	’ he retorted , stretching out his right hand , and rubbing his thumb upon its palm . ‘
172123	172127	172121	172121	Poor	4002	’ she cried . ‘
172133	172134	172135	172135	Comparisons	359	’ ‘
172139	172145	172135	172135	Comparisons	359	’ said the blind man . ‘
172208	172228	172230	172230	he	1009	’ She still walked wildly to and fro . At length , stopping abruptly before him , she said : ‘
172234	172235	172236	172236	He	1009	’ ‘
172243	172244	172236	172236	He	1009	’ ‘
172250	172251	172246	172246	I	0	’ ‘
172257	172265	172246	172246	I	0	’ said the blind man , calmly ; ‘
172274	172275	172270	172270	I	0	’ ‘
172281	172289	172270	172270	I	0	’ she answered , with a shudder . ‘
172293	172317	172319	172319	you	3968	’ he replied , crossing his legs again , for he had made as though he would rise and walk to the door . ‘
172364	172365	172367	172367	you	0	’ ‘
172376	172380	172367	172367	you	0	’ she retorted . ‘
172434	172445	172450	172450	ma’am	1503	’ The blind man snapped his fingers as he answered : ‘
172702	172718	172744	172744	I	0	’ She was about to speak , but he checked her , and went on . ‘
172819	172850	172801	172801	he	1009	’ He laid a great stress on these latter words , and paused as if to find out what effect they had produced . She only answered by her tears . ‘
172857	172865	172853	172855	a likely lad	4026	’ said the blind man , thoughtfully , ‘
172983	172998	172960	172960	widow	3968	’ She was about to answer him again , but again he stopped her . ‘
173039	173106	173038	173038	I	0	’m in no hurry . Night ’s coming on , and if I do n’t sleep here , I shall not go far . Twenty pounds ! Consider of it , ma’am , for twenty minutes ; give each pound a minute ; that ’s a fair allowance . I ’ll enjoy the air the while , which is very mild and pleasant in these parts . ’
173338	173348	173349	173349	he	4035	‘ For I carry some comfort , you see , ’
173352	173360	173349	173349	he	4035	‘ Taste that . Is it good ? ’
173384	173389	173391	173393	the blind man	1085	‘ Drink some more , ’
173395	173415	173391	173393	the blind man	1085	‘ do n’t be afraid of it . You do n’t taste anything like that , often , eh ? ’
173416	173419	173421	173421	Barnaby	220	‘ Often ! ’
173423	173426	173421	173421	Barnaby	220	‘ Never ! ’
173427	173431	173433	173435	the blind man	1085	‘ Too poor ? ’
173440	173463	173433	173435	the blind man	1085	‘ Ay . That ’s bad . Your mother , poor soul , would be happier if she was richer , Barnaby . ’
173464	173495	173497	173497	Barnaby	220	‘ Why , so I tell her -- the very thing I told her just before you came to - night , when all that gold was in the sky , ’
173513	173531	173497	173497	Barnaby	220	‘ Tell me . Is there any way of being rich , that I could find out ? ’
173532	173540	173581	173583	The blind man	1085	‘ Any way ! A hundred ways . ’
173541	173546	173547	173547	he	220	‘ Ay , ay ? ’
173550	173580	173581	173583	The blind man	1085	‘ Do you say so ? What are they?--Nay , mother , it ’s for your sake I ask ; not mine;--for yours , indeed . What are they ? ’
173609	173630	173581	173583	The blind man	1085	‘ Why , they are not to be found out by stay - at - homes , my good friend . ’
173631	173639	173641	173641	Barnaby	220	‘ By stay - at - homes ! ’
173648	173859	173641	173641	Barnaby	220	‘ But I am not one . Now , there you mistake . I am often out before the sun , and travel home when he has gone to rest . I am away in the woods before the day has reached the shady places , and am often there when the bright moon is peeping through the boughs , and looking down upon the other moon that lives in the water . As I walk along , I try to find , among the grass and moss , some of that small money for which she works so hard and used to shed so many tears . As I lie asleep in the shade , I dream of it -- dream of digging it up in heaps ; and spying it out , hidden under bushes ; and seeing it sparkle , as the dew - drops do , among the leaves . But I never find it . Tell me where it is . I ’d go there , if the journey were a whole year long , because I know she would be happier when I came home and brought some with me . Speak again . I ’ll listen to you if you talk all night . ’
173932	173970	173918	173918	he	1085	‘ It ’s in the world , bold Barnaby , the merry world ; not in solitary places like those you pass your time in , but in crowds , and where there ’s noise and rattle . ’
173971	173976	173978	173978	Barnaby	220	‘ Good ! good ! ’
173984	174005	173978	173978	Barnaby	220	‘ Yes ! I love that . Grip loves it too . It suits us both . That ’s brave ! ’
174006	174012	174014	174016	the blind man	1085	‘ --The kind of places , ’
174018	174075	174014	174016	the blind man	1085	‘ that a young fellow likes , and in which a good son may do more for his mother , and himself to boot , in a month , than he could here in all his life -- that is , if he had a friend , you know , and some one to advise with . ’
174076	174083	174085	174085	Barnaby	220	‘ You hear this , mother ? ’
174093	174129	174085	174085	Barnaby	220	‘ Never tell me we should n’t heed it , if it lay shining at our feet . Why do we heed it so much now ? Why do you toil from morning until night ? ’
174130	174133	174135	174137	the blind man	1085	‘ Surely , ’
174139	174153	174154	174154	he	1085	‘ surely . Have you no answer , widow ? Is your mind , ’
174158	174164	174154	174154	he	1085	‘ not made up yet ? ’
174165	174172	174173	174173	she	4046	‘ Let me speak with you , ’
174176	174179	174173	174173	she	4046	‘ apart . ’
174180	174188	174190	174190	Stagg	244	‘ Lay your hand upon my sleeve , ’
174197	174235	174236	174236	She	4046	‘ and lead me where you will . Courage , bold Barnaby . We ’ll talk more of this : I ’ve a fancy for you . Wait there till I come back . Now , widow . ’
174254	174261	174262	174262	she	4046	‘ You are a fit agent , ’
174271	174282	174262	174262	she	4046	‘ and well represent the man who sent you here . ’
174283	174293	174294	174294	Stagg	244	‘ I ’ll tell him that you said so , ’
174297	174327	174294	174294	Stagg	244	‘ He has a regard for you , and will respect me the more ( if possible ) for your praise . We must have our rights , widow . ’
174328	174335	174336	174336	she	4046	‘ Rights ! Do you know , ’
174339	174345	174336	174336	she	4046	‘ that a word from me-- ’
174346	174352	174354	174356	the blind man	1085	‘ Why do you stop ? ’
174364	174404	174354	174356	the blind man	1085	‘ Do I know that a word from you would place my friend in the last position of the dance of life ? Yes , I do . What of that ? It will never be spoken , widow . ’
174405	174412	174294	174294	Stagg	244	‘ You are sure of that ? ’
174413	174488	174489	174489	he	4051	‘ Quite -- so sure , that I do n’t come here to discuss the question . I say we must have our rights , or we must be bought off . Keep to that point , or let me return to my young friend , for I have an interest in the lad , and desire to put him in the way of making his fortune . Bah ! you need n’t speak , ’
174493	174694	174489	174489	he	4051	‘ I know what you would say : you have hinted at it once already . Have I no feeling for you , because I am blind ? No , I have not . Why do you expect me , being in darkness , to be better than men who have their sight -- why should you ? Is the hand of Heaven more manifest in my having no eyes , than in your having two ? It ’s the ca nt of you folks to be horrified if a blind man robs , or lies , or steals ; oh yes , it ’s far worse in him , who can barely live on the few halfpence that are thrown to him in streets , than in you , who can see , and work , and are not dependent on the mercies of the world . A curse on you ! You who have five senses may be wicked at your pleasure ; we who have four , and want the most important , are to live and be moral on our affliction . The true charity and justice of rich to poor , all the world over ! ’
174718	174721	174722	174722	he	4052	‘ Well ? ’
174731	174743	174722	174722	he	4052	‘ That should lead to something . The point , widow ? ’
174744	174751	174752	174752	she	4053	‘ First answer me one question , ’
174755	174769	174752	174752	she	4053	‘ You say he is close at hand . Has he left London ? ’
174770	174784	174786	174788	the blind man	1085	‘ Being close at hand , widow , it would seem he has , ’
174790	174801	174786	174788	the blind man	1085	‘ I mean , for good ? You know that . ’
174802	174835	174752	174752	she	4053	‘ Yes , for good . The truth is , widow , that his making a longer stay there might have had disagreeable consequences . He has come away for that reason . ’
174836	174839	174841	174842	the widow	7604	‘ Listen , ’
174855	174858	174841	174842	the widow	7604	‘ Count . ’
174859	174862	174864	174866	the blind man	1085	‘ Six , ’
174871	174875	174864	174866	the blind man	1085	‘ Any more ? ’
174876	174882	174883	174883	she	4053	‘ They are the savings , ’
174886	174894	174883	174883	she	4053	‘ of five years . Six guineas . ’
174929	175005	174864	174866	the blind man	1085	‘ These have been scraped together and laid by , lest sickness or death should separate my son and me . They have been purchased at the price of much hunger , hard labour , and want of rest . If you CAN take them -- do -- on condition that you leave this place upon the instant , and enter no more into that room , where he sits now , expecting your return . ’
175006	175010	175012	175014	the blind man	1085	‘ Six guineas , ’
175020	175041	175017	175017	his	1085	‘ though of the fullest weight that were ever coined , fall very far short of twenty pounds , widow . ’
175042	175077	174864	174866	the blind man	1085	‘ For such a sum , as you know , I must write to a distant part of the country . To do that , and receive an answer , I must have time . ’
175078	175082	175084	175084	Stagg	244	‘ Two days ? ’
175086	175089	175084	175084	Stagg	244	‘ More . ’
175090	175094	174864	174866	the blind man	1085	‘ Four days ? ’
175095	175124	174864	174866	the blind man	1085	‘ A week . Return on this day week , at the same hour , but not to the house . Wait at the corner of the lane . ’
175125	175129	175131	175133	the blind man	1085	‘ Of course , ’
175140	175147	175131	175133	the blind man	1085	‘ I shall find you there ? ’
175148	175187	174864	174866	the blind man	1085	‘ Where else can I take refuge ? Is it not enough that you have made a beggar of me , and that I have sacrificed my whole store , so hardly earned , to preserve this home ? ’
175188	175191	175193	175195	the blind man	1085	‘ Humph ! ’
175201	175227	175193	175195	the blind man	1085	‘ Set me with my face towards the point you speak of , and in the middle of the road . Is this the spot ? ’
175228	175232	174864	174866	the blind man	1085	‘ It is . ’
175233	175253	175254	175254	She	4061	‘ On this day week at sunset . And think of him within doors.--For the present , good night . ’
175359	175362	175364	175364	Barnaby	220	‘ Mother ! ’
175366	175378	175364	175364	Barnaby	220	‘ What is the matter ? Where is the blind man ? ’
175379	175384	175422	175422	her	4061	‘ He is gone . ’
175385	175388	175389	175389	he	220	‘ Gone ! ’
175395	175410	175389	175389	he	220	‘ I must have more talk with him . Which way did he take ? ’
175411	175417	175418	175418	she	4061	‘ I do n’t know , ’
175427	175444	175418	175418	she	4061	‘ You must not go out to - night . There are ghosts and dreams abroad . ’
175445	175448	175450	175450	Barnaby	220	‘ Ay ? ’
175457	175474	175450	175450	Barnaby	220	‘ It is not safe to stir . We must leave this place to - morrow . ’
175475	175489	175418	175418	she	4061	‘ This place ! This cottage -- and the little garden , mother ! ’
175490	175536	175450	175450	Barnaby	220	‘ Yes ! To - morrow morning at sunrise . We must travel to London ; lose ourselves in that wide place -- there would be some trace of us in any other town -- then travel on again , and find some new abode . ’
175939	175963	175934	175934	he	220	‘ Oh mother , mother , how mournful he will be when he scratches at the door , and finds it always shut ! ’
176587	176594	176596	176597	the gentleman	1227	‘ Who hast thou got here ? ’
176615	176628	176601	176602	the man	472	‘ who are these ? Eh ? art a beggar , woman ? ’
176642	176645	176647	176648	the gentleman	1227	‘ Vagrants , ’
176650	176685	176647	176648	the gentleman	1227	‘ vagrants and vagabonds . Thee wish to be made acquainted with the cage , dost thee -- the cage , the stocks , and the whipping - post ? Where dost come from ? ’
176726	176735	176737	176738	the gentleman	1227	‘ Do n’t be too sure of that , ’
176740	176780	176737	176738	the gentleman	1227	‘ we do n’t allow vagrants to roam about this place . I know what thou want’st -- stray linen drying on hedges , and stray poultry , eh ? What hast got in that basket , lazy hound ? ’
176781	176806	176737	176738	the gentleman	1227	‘ Grip , Grip , Grip -- Grip the clever , Grip the wicked , Grip the knowing -- Grip , Grip , Grip , ’
176824	176826	176827	176828	a devil	979	‘ I ’m

176866	176871	176864	176864	scoundrel	4114	’ said the gentleman , ‘
176878	177033	176874	176874	me	0	’ Barnaby , thus condescendingly addressed , produced his bird , but not without much fear and trembling , and set him down upon the ground ; which he had no sooner done than Grip drew fifty corks at least , and then began to dance ; at the same time eyeing the gentleman with surprising insolence of manner , and screwing his head so much on one side that he appeared desirous of screwing it off upon the spot . The cork - drawing seemed to make a greater impression on the gentleman ’s mind , than the raven ’s power of speech , and was indeed particularly adapted to his habits and capacity . He desired to have that done again , but despite his being very peremptory , and notwithstanding that Barnaby coaxed to the utmost , Grip turned a deaf ear to the request , and preserved a dead silence . ‘
177038	177072	176874	176874	me	0	’ said the gentleman , pointing to the house . But Grip , who had watched the action , anticipated his master , by hopping on before them;--constantly flapping his wings , and screaming ‘
177075	177205	177206	177207	An idiot	8891	’ meanwhile , as a hint perhaps that there was company coming , and a small collation would be acceptable . Barnaby and his mother walked on , on either side of the gentleman on horseback , who surveyed each of them from time to time in a proud and coarse manner , and occasionally thundered out some question , the tone of which alarmed Barnaby so much that he could find no answer , and , as a matter of course , could make him no reply . On one of these occasions , when the gentleman appeared disposed to exercise his horsewhip , the widow ventured to inform him in a low voice and with tears in her eyes , that her son was of weak mind . ‘
177211	177223	177206	177207	An idiot	8891	’ said the gentleman , looking at Barnaby as he spoke . ‘
177233	177234	177235	177235	She	4118	’ ‘
177238	177255	177263	177264	the widow	7604	’ was Barnaby ’s timid answer , pointing to his mother--‘I -- always , I believe . ’
177256	177261	177263	177264	the widow	7604	‘ From his birth , ’
177266	177273	177275	177276	the gentleman	1227	‘ I do n’t believe it , ’
177278	177319	177275	177276	the gentleman	1227	‘ not a bit of it . It ’s an excuse not to work . There ’s nothing like flogging to cure that disorder . I ’d make a difference in him in ten minutes , I ’ll be bound . ’
177320	177334	177336	177337	the widow	7604	‘ Heaven has made none in more than twice ten years , sir , ’
177340	177358	177336	177337	the widow	7604	‘ Then why do n’t you shut him up ? we pay enough for county institutions , damn ‘
177380	177399	177376	177376	I	0	’ Now , this gentleman had various endearing appellations among his intimate friends . By some he was called ‘
177408	177411	177412	177416	a fine old country gentleman	4125	’ by some ‘
177418	177421	177422	177424	a sporting gentleman	4126	’ by some ‘
177426	177429	177422	177424	a sporting gentleman	4126	’ by some ‘
177436	177439	177430	177434	a thorough - bred Englishman	4127	’ by some ‘
177445	177704	177440	177443	a genuine John Bull	4128	’ but they all agreed in one respect , and that was , that it was a pity there were not more like him , and that because there were not , the country was going to rack and ruin every day . He was in the commission of the peace , and could write his name almost legibly ; but his greatest qualifications were , that he was more severe with poachers , was a better shot , a harder rider , had better horses , kept better dogs , could eat more solid food , drink more strong wine , go to bed every night more drunk and get up every morning more sober , than any man in the county . In knowledge of horseflesh he was almost equal to a farrier , in stable learning he surpassed his own head groom , and in gluttony not a pig on his estate was a match for him . He had no seat in Parliament himself , but he was extremely patriotic , and usually drove his voters up to the poll with his own hands . He was warmly attached to church and state , and never appointed to the living in his gift any but a three - bottle man and a first - rate fox - hunter . He mistrusted the honesty of all poor people who could read and write , and had a secret jealousy of his own wife ( a young lady whom he had married for what his friends called ‘
177711	177849	177440	177443	a genuine John Bull	4128	’ that her father ’s property adjoined his own ) for possessing those accomplishments in a greater degree than himself . In short , Barnaby being an idiot , and Grip a creature of mere brute instinct , it would be very hard to say what this gentleman was . He rode up to the door of a handsome house approached by a great flight of steps , where a man was waiting to take his horse , and led the way into a large hall , which , spacious as it was , was tainted with the fumes of last night ’s stale debauch . Greatcoats , riding - whips , bridles , top - boots , spurs , and such gear , were strewn about on all sides , and formed , with some huge stags ’
177955	177971	177973	177974	the gentleman	1227	‘ Here ! Thou’st no delight in following the hounds as an Englishwoman should have , ’
177976	177988	177973	177974	the gentleman	1227	‘ See to this here . That ’ll please thee perhaps . ’
178012	178022	178024	178025	the gentleman	1227	‘ He ’s an idiot , the woman says , ’
178031	178038	178028	178028	his	1227	‘ I do n’t believe it . ’
178039	178045	178047	178048	the lady	1941	‘ Are you his mother ? ’
178054	178063	178065	178066	the gentleman	1227	‘ What ’s the use of asking HER ? ’
178076	178108	178065	178066	the gentleman	1227	‘ She ’ll tell thee so , of course . Most likely he ’s hired , at so much a day . There . Get on . Make him do something . ’
178244	178248	178250	178251	the gentleman	1227	‘ His price , ’
178260	178270	178250	178251	the gentleman	1227	‘ what dost want for him ? How much ? ’
178271	178279	178281	178281	Barnaby	220	‘ He ’s not to be sold , ’
178300	178306	178250	178251	the gentleman	1227	‘ Mother , come away . ’
178307	178322	178324	178325	the gentleman	1227	‘ Thou seest how much of an idiot he is , book - learner , ’
178333	178349	178324	178325	the gentleman	1227	‘ He can make a bargain . What dost want for him , old woman ? ’
178350	178359	178361	178362	the widow	7604	‘ He is my son ’s constant companion , ’
178364	178376	178361	178362	the widow	7604	‘ He is not to be sold , sir , indeed . ’
178377	178383	178385	178386	the gentleman	1227	‘ Not to be sold ! ’
178400	178406	178385	178386	the gentleman	1227	‘ Not to be sold ! ’
178407	178411	178412	178412	she	7604	‘ Indeed no , ’
178415	178432	178412	178412	she	7604	‘ We have never thought of parting with him , sir , I do assure you . ’
178466	178471	178458	178458	he	1227	‘ Eh ? What ? ’
178472	178488	178489	178489	she	7604	‘ We can hardly expect them to sell the bird , against their own desire , ’
178492	178499	178458	178458	he	1227	‘ If they prefer to keep him-- ’
178500	178506	178507	178507	he	1227	‘ Prefer to keep him ! ’
178510	178565	178566	178566	he	1227	‘ These people , who go tramping about the country a - pilfering and vagabondising on all hands , prefer to keep a bird , when a landed proprietor and a justice asks his price ! That old woman ’s been to school . I know she has . Do n’t tell me no , ’
178572	178578	178566	178566	he	1227	‘ I say , yes . ’
178597	178601	178603	178604	the gentleman	1227	‘ No harm ! ’
178606	178678	178603	178604	the gentleman	1227	‘ No . No harm . No harm , ye old rebel , not a bit of harm . If my clerk was here , I ’d set ye in the stocks , I would , or lay ye in jail for prowling up and down , on the look - out for petty larcenies , ye limb of a gipsy . Here , Simon , put these pilferers out , shove ‘
178686	178722	178603	178604	the gentleman	1227	‘ em ! Ye do n’t want to sell the bird , ye that come here to beg , do n’t ye ? If they an’t out in double - quick , set the dogs upon ‘
178725	178967	178968	178968	Mother	8432	’ They waited for no further dismissal , but fled precipitately , leaving the gentleman to storm away by himself ( for the poor lady had already retreated ) , and making a great many vain attempts to silence Grip , who , excited by the noise , drew corks enough for a city feast as they hurried down the avenue , and appeared to congratulate himself beyond measure on having been the cause of the disturbance . When they had nearly reached the lodge , another servant , emerging from the shrubbery , feigned to be very active in ordering them off , but this man put a crown into the widow ’s hand , and whispering that his lady sent it , thrust them gently from the gate . This incident only suggested to the widow ’s mind , when they halted at an alehouse some miles further on , and heard the justice ’s character as given by his friends , that perhaps something more than capacity of stomach and tastes for the kennel and the stable , were required to form either a perfect country gentleman , a thoroughbred Englishman , or a genuine John Bull ; and that possibly the terms were sometimes misappropriated , not to say disgraced . She little thought then , that a circumstance so slight would ever influence their future fortunes ; but time and experience enlightened her in this respect . ‘
178970	178995	178996	178996	we	4156	’ said Barnaby , as they were sitting next day in a waggon which was to take them within ten miles of the capital , ‘
178997	179014	179015	179015	She	8432	’re going to London first , you said . Shall we see that blind man there ? ’
179020	179024	179015	179015	She	8432	‘ Heaven forbid ! ’
179043	179050	179052	179052	Barnaby	220	‘ He ’s a wise man , ’
179059	179122	179052	179052	Barnaby	220	‘ I wish that we may meet with him again . What was it that he said of crowds ? That gold was to be found where people crowded , and not among the trees and in such quiet places ? He spoke as if he loved it ; London is a crowded place ; I think we shall meet him there . ’
179123	179135	179136	179136	she	4158	‘ But why do you desire to see him , love ? ’
179139	179142	179144	179144	Barnaby	220	‘ Because , ’
179151	179239	179144	179144	Barnaby	220	‘ he talked to me about gold , which is a rare thing , and say what you will , a thing you would like to have , I know . And because he came and went away so strangely -- just as white - headed old men come sometimes to my bed ’s foot in the night , and say what I ca n’t remember when the bright day returns . He told me he ’d come back . I wonder why he broke his word ! ’
179240	179262	179263	179263	He	220	‘ But you never thought of being rich or gay , before , dear Barnaby . You have always been contented . ’
179275	179282	179263	179263	He	220	‘ Ay ay -- oh yes , ’
180305	180314	180315	180315	he	4191	‘ Why , where have you come from , ’
180318	180349	180362	180362	she	7604	‘ that you have n’t heard of Lord George Gordon ’s great association ? This is the day that he presents the petition against the Catholics , God bless him ! ’
180350	180361	180362	180362	she	7604	‘ What have all these men to do with that ? ’
180365	180374	180375	180377	the old man	655	‘ What have they to do with it ! ’
180380	180430	180375	180377	the old man	655	‘ Why , how you talk ! Do n’t you know his lordship has declared he wo n’t present it to the house at all , unless it is attended to the door by forty thousand good and true men at least ? There ’s a crowd for you ! ’
180431	180436	180438	180438	Barnaby	220	‘ A crowd indeed ! ’
180440	180448	180438	180438	Barnaby	220	‘ Do you hear that , mother ! ’
180449	180452	180375	180377	the old man	655	‘ And they ’re
180461	180467	180375	180377	the old man	655	’ resumed the old man , ‘
180501	180515	180482	180482	He	323	’ and he pointed to where the House of Commons overlooked the river , ‘
180550	180579	180580	180580	Mother	222	’ And so , with much mumbling and chuckling and shaking of his forefinger , he rose , with the assistance of his stick , and tottered off . ‘
180582	180586	180580	180580	Mother	222	’ said Barnaby , ‘
180598	180599	180580	180580	Mother	222	’ ‘
180605	180610	180644	180644	they	4202	’ cried his mother . ‘
180615	180624	180644	180644	they	4202	’ he answered , plucking at her sleeve . ‘
180630	180631	180632	180632	You	4201	’ ‘
180637	180641	180632	180632	You	4201	’ she urged , ‘
180665	180666	180659	180660	Dear Barnaby	220	’ ‘
180671	180679	180659	180660	Dear Barnaby	220	’ he cried , patting her hand . ‘
180724	180777	180778	180779	Young man	7419	’ She tried with all the earnestness her fears engendered , to turn him from his purpose , but in vain . He was stooping down to buckle on his shoe , when a hackney - coach passed them rather quickly , and a voice inside called to the driver to stop . ‘
180781	180787	180778	180779	Young man	7419	’ said a voice within . ‘
180792	180799	180778	180779	Young man	7419	’ cried Barnaby , looking up . ‘
180806	180817	180801	180801	you	7419	’ returned the stranger , holding out a blue cockade . ‘
180832	180837	180778	180779	Young man	7419	’ exclaimed the widow . ‘
180844	180854	180840	180840	yourself	7419	’ said the man within the coach , coldly . ‘
180898	180907	180879	180879	He	476	’ Barnaby , trembling with impatience , cried , ‘
180917	180937	180914	180914	I	0	’ as he had cried a dozen times already . The man threw him a cockade , and crying , ‘
180946	181035	180914	180914	I	0	’ ordered the coachman to drive on fast ; and left them . With hands that trembled with his eagerness to fix the bauble in his hat , Barnaby was adjusting it as he best could , and hurriedly replying to the tears and entreaties of his mother , when two gentlemen passed on the opposite side of the way . Observing them , and seeing how Barnaby was occupied , they stopped , whispered together for an instant , turned back , and came over to them . ‘
181042	181069	181038	181038	you	0	’ said one of them , who was dressed in a plain suit of black , wore long lank hair , and carried a great cane . ‘
181079	181080	181081	181081	I	0	’ ‘
181087	181106	181085	181085	sir	7320	’ replied Barnaby , finishing his task , and putting his hat on with an air of pride . ‘
181113	181114	181121	181122	young man	7419	’ ‘
181136	181143	181121	181122	young man	7419	’ said the second gentleman mildly . ‘
181164	181165	181149	181151	Lord George Gordon	323	’ ‘
181170	181189	181168	181168	Gashford	325	’ said Lord George , as Barnaby pulled off his hat again and made him a low bow , ‘
181249	181263	181264	181264	You	7419	’ Barnaby shook his head and looked vacantly from one to the other . ‘
181272	181276	181264	181264	You	7419	’ said Gashford , ‘
181291	181292	181293	181293	He	323	’ ‘
181301	181306	181293	181293	He	323	’ the widow interposed . ‘
181337	181338	181314	181314	him	323	’ ‘
181356	181364	181314	181314	him	323	’ said Lord George to his secretary . ‘
181377	181378	181371	181371	I	0	’ ‘
181381	181389	181371	181371	I	0	’ cried Gashford with a solemn face . ‘
181399	181404	181390	181390	You	7419	’ said the widow . ‘
181477	181478	181479	181479	My	0	’ ‘
181483	181487	181479	181479	My	0	’ said Gashford , ‘

181537	181567	181535	181535	me	0	’ implored the widow , laying both her hands upon his breast , and scarcely knowing what she did , or said , in the earnestness of her supplication , ‘
181607	181608	181601	181601	he	7914	’ ‘
181621	181634	181601	181601	he	7914	’ said Lord George , evading her touch , and colouring deeply , ‘
181669	181670	181667	181667	mother	8432	’ ‘
181677	181688	181675	181675	you	3194	’ said Gashford , with a kind of meek severity . ‘
181699	181700	181701	181701	He	7914	’ ‘
181707	181724	181701	181701	He	7914	’ said Lord George , glancing at Barnaby , and whispering in his secretary ’s ear , ‘
181763	181764	181701	181701	He	7914	’ ‘
181768	181773	181701	181701	He	7914	’ replied the secretary ; ‘
181814	181844	181845	181845	he	4236	’ he added , with a lip that slightly curled as he looked at Barnaby , who stood twirling his hat , and stealthily beckoning them to come away , ‘
181860	181861	181845	181845	he	4236	’ ‘
181873	181881	181889	181889	you	0	’ said Lord George , addressing him ; ‘
181891	181892	181889	181889	you	0	’ ‘
181897	181905	181889	181889	you	0	’ said Barnaby , with sparkling eyes . ‘
181918	181919	181912	181912	I	0	’ ‘
181923	181937	181938	181938	I	0	’ replied Lord George , with a reproachful glance at the unhappy mother . ‘
181955	182382	182383	182383	Gashford	325	’ Barnaby kissed his mother tenderly on the cheek , and bidding her be of good cheer , for their fortunes were both made now , did as he was desired . She , poor woman , followed too -- with how much fear and grief it would be hard to tell . They passed quickly through the Bridge Road , where the shops were all shut up ( for the passage of the great crowd and the expectation of their return had alarmed the tradesmen for their goods and windows ) , and where , in the upper stories , all the inhabitants were congregated , looking down into the street below , with faces variously expressive of alarm , of interest , expectancy , and indignation . Some of these applauded , and some hissed ; but regardless of these interruptions -- for the noise of a vast congregation of people at a little distance , sounded in his ears like the roaring of the sea -- Lord George Gordon quickened his pace , and presently arrived before St George ’s Fields . They were really fields at that time , and of considerable extent . Here an immense multitude was collected , bearing flags of various kinds and sizes , but all of the same colour -- blue , like the cockades -- some sections marching to and fro in military array , and others drawn up in circles , squares , and lines . A large portion , both of the bodies which paraded the ground , and of those which remained stationary , were occupied in singing hymns or psalms . With whomsoever this originated , it was well done ; for the sound of so many thousand voices in the air must have stirred the heart of any man within him , and could not fail to have a wonderful effect upon enthusiasts , however mistaken . Scouts had been posted in advance of the great body , to give notice of their leader ’s coming . These falling back , the word was quickly passed through the whole host , and for a short interval there ensued a profound and deathlike silence , during which the mass was so still and quiet , that the fluttering of a banner caught the eye , and became a circumstance of note . Then they burst into a tremendous shout , into another , and another ; and the air seemed rent and shaken , as if by the discharge of cannon . ‘
182385	182416	182383	182383	Gashford	325	’ cried Lord George , pressing his secretary ’s arm tight within his own , and speaking with as much emotion in his voice , as in his altered face , ‘
182467	182468	182501	182501	my	0	’ ‘
182475	182480	182501	182501	my	0	’ said the secretary . ‘
182515	182516	182519	182519	you	0	’ ‘
182522	182545	182519	182519	you	0	’ cried his master , catching him by both hands ; for he had made a show of kneeling at his feet . ‘
182562	182602	182603	182603	Gashford	325	’ the tears stood in the eyes of the poor gentleman as he said the words.--‘Let us go among them ; we have to find a place in some division for this new recruit -- give me your hand . ’
183077	183081	183082	183082	he	7264	‘ How now ! ’
183085	183101	183082	183082	he	7264	‘ Barnaby Rudge ! Why , where have you been hiding for these hundred years ? ’
183157	183162	183168	183169	the other	483	‘ What ! Hugh ! ’
183163	183166	183168	183169	the other	483	‘ Hugh ! ’
183171	183214	183168	183169	the other	483	‘ ay , Hugh -- Maypole Hugh ! You remember my dog ? He ’s alive now , and will know you , I warrant . What , you wear the colour , do you ? Well done ! Ha ha ha ! ’
183215	183225	183227	183228	Lord George	323	‘ You know this young man , I see , ’
183230	183257	183227	183228	Lord George	323	‘ Know him , my lord ! as well as I know my own right hand . My captain knows him . We all know him . ’
183258	183267	183168	183169	the other	483	‘ Will you take him into your division ? ’
183268	183291	183293	183293	Hugh	198	‘ It has n’t in it a better , nor a nimbler , nor a more active man , than Barnaby Rudge , ’
183295	183327	183328	183328	he	198	‘ Show me the man who says it has ! Fall in , Barnaby . He shall march , my lord , between me and Dennis ; and he shall carry , ’
183345	183355	183328	183328	he	198	‘ the gayest silken streamer in this valiant army . ’
183356	183365	183367	183368	the widow	7604	‘ In the name of God , no ! ’
183373	183389	183367	183368	the widow	7604	‘ Barnaby -- my lord -- see -- he’ll come back -- Barnaby -- Barnaby ! ’
183390	183396	183398	183398	Hugh	198	‘ Women in the field ! ’
183409	183416	183398	183398	Hugh	198	‘ Holloa ! My captain there ! ’
183417	183424	183426	183427	Simon Tappertit	223	‘ What ’s the matter here ? ’
183436	183443	183426	183427	Simon Tappertit	223	‘ Do you call this order ? ’
183444	183451	183453	183453	Hugh	198	‘ Nothing like it , captain , ’
183464	183490	183460	183460	his	198	‘ It ’s against all orders . Ladies are carrying off our gallant soldiers from their duty . The word of command , captain ! They ’re

183502	183514	183426	183427	Simon Tappertit	223	’ cried Simon , with the whole power of his lungs . ‘
183519	184053	184056	184056	you	4277	’ She was thrown to the ground ; the whole field was in motion ; Barnaby was whirled away into the heart of a dense mass of men , and she saw him no more . Chapter 49 The mob had been divided from its first assemblage into four divisions ; the London , the Westminster , the Southwark , and the Scotch . Each of these divisions being subdivided into various bodies , and these bodies being drawn up in various forms and figures , the general arrangement was , except to the few chiefs and leaders , as unintelligible as the plan of a great battle to the meanest soldier in the field . It was not without its method , however ; for , in a very short space of time after being put in motion , the crowd had resolved itself into three great parties , and were prepared , as had been arranged , to cross the river by different bridges , and make for the House of Commons in separate detachments . At the head of that division which had Westminster Bridge for its approach to the scene of action , Lord George Gordon took his post ; with Gashford at his right hand , and sundry ruffians , of most unpromising appearance , forming a kind of staff about him . The conduct of a second party , whose route lay by Blackfriars , was entrusted to a committee of management , including perhaps a dozen men : while the third , which was to go by London Bridge , and through the main streets , in order that their numbers and their serious intentions might be the better known and appreciated by the citizens , were led by Simon Tappertit ( assisted by a few subalterns , selected from the Brotherhood of United Bulldogs ) , Dennis the hangman , Hugh , and some others . The word of command being given , each of these great bodies took the road assigned to it , and departed on its way , in perfect order and profound silence . That which went through the City greatly exceeded the others in number , and was of such prodigious extent that when the rear began to move , the front was nearly four miles in advance , notwithstanding that the men marched three abreast and followed very close upon each other . At the head of this party , in the place where Hugh , in the madness of his humour , had stationed him , and walking between that dangerous companion and the hangman , went Barnaby ; as many a man among the thousands who looked on that day afterwards remembered well . Forgetful of all other things in the ecstasy of the moment , his face flushed and his eyes sparkling with delight , heedless of the weight of the great banner he carried , and mindful only of its flashing in the sun and rustling in the summer breeze , on he went , proud , happy , elated past all telling:--the only light - hearted , undesigning creature , in the whole assembly . ‘
184061	184085	184056	184056	you	4277	’ asked Hugh , as they passed through the crowded streets , and looked up at the windows which were thronged with spectators . ‘

184158	184175	184156	184156	brother	9503	’ growled the hangman , glancing with no very approving eyes at Barnaby as he spoke : ‘
184207	184221	184222	184222	he	0	’re ready for action I hope , eh ? You , I mean , ’
184232	184245	184222	184222	he	0	‘ What are you staring at ? Why do n’t you speak ? ’
184263	184271	184273	184274	the latter	7398	‘ He do n’t understand your way , ’
184276	184294	184273	184274	the latter	7398	‘ Here , I ’ll explain it to him . Barnaby old boy , attend to me . ’
184295	184300	184302	184302	Barnaby	220	‘ I ’ll attend , ’
184308	184318	184302	184302	Barnaby	220	‘ but I wish I could see her somewhere . ’
184319	184323	184325	184325	Dennis	187	‘ See who ? ’
184331	184361	184325	184325	Dennis	187	‘ You an’t in love I hope , brother ? That an’t the sort of thing for us , you know . We must n’t have no love here . ’
184362	184376	184378	184378	Barnaby	220	‘ She would be proud indeed to see me now , eh Hugh ? ’
184380	184434	184378	184378	Barnaby	220	‘ Would n’t it make her glad to see me at the head of this large show ? She ’d cry for joy , I know she would . Where CAN she be ? She never sees me at my best , and what do I care to be gay and fine if SHE ’S
184438	184439	184378	184378	Barnaby	220	’ ‘
184447	184455	184456	184456	We	4286	’ asked Mr Dennis with supreme disdain . ‘

184582	184587	184589	184589	Hugh	198	‘ Barnaby ’s right , ’

184693	184703	184705	184705	you	4297	’ said Barnaby , his face beaming with delight : ‘
184721	184722	184718	184719	Kind Hugh	198	’ ‘
184733	184754	184731	184731	you	4297	’ retorted Hugh , with a wink at Dennis , who regarded his new companion in arms with great astonishment . ‘
184759	184763	184731	184731	you	4297	’ cried Barnaby . ‘
184768	184772	184731	184731	you	4297	’ said Hugh . ‘
184830	184843	184948	184948	he	220	‘ em safe . That ’s all we ’ve got to do . ’
184844	184849	184851	184851	Barnaby	220	‘ Is that all ? ’
184864	184897	184857	184857	he	220	‘ I warrant you I keep this one safe , then . You have put it in good hands . You know me , Hugh . Nobody shall wrest this flag away . ’
184898	184902	184904	184904	Hugh	198	‘ Well said ! ’
184906	184947	184948	184948	he	220	‘ Ha ha ! Nobly said ! That ’s the old stout Barnaby , that I have climbed and leaped with , many and many a day -- I knew I was not mistaken in Barnaby.--Don’t you see , man , ’
184964	185034	184948	184948	he	220	‘ that the lad ’s a natural , and can be got to do anything , if you take him the right way ? Letting alone the fun he is , he ’s worth a dozen men , in earnest , as you ’d find if you tried a fall with him . Leave him to me . You shall soon see whether he ’s of use or not . ’
185991	186253	185989	185990	The strangers	4366	’ gallery , which was immediately above the door of the House , had been ordered to be closed on the first rumour of disturbance , and was empty ; save that now and then Lord George took his seat there , for the convenience of coming to the head of the stairs which led to it , and repeating to the people what had passed within . It was on these stairs that Barnaby , Hugh , and Dennis were posted . There were two flights , short , steep , and narrow , running parallel to each other , and leading to two little doors communicating with a low passage which opened on the gallery . Between them was a kind of well , or unglazed skylight , for the admission of light and air into the lobby , which might be some eighteen or twenty feet below . Upon one of these little staircases -- not that at the head of which Lord George appeared from time to time , but the other -- Gashford stood with his elbow on the bannister , and his cheek resting on his hand , with his usual crafty aspect . Whenever he varied this attitude in the slightest degree -- so much as by the gentlest motion of his arm -- the uproar was certain to increase , not merely there , but in the lobby below ; from which place no doubt , some man who acted as fugleman to the rest , was constantly looking up and watching him . ‘
186256	186285	185989	185990	The strangers	4366	’ cried Hugh , in a voice which made itself heard even above the roar and tumult , as Lord George appeared at the top of the staircase . ‘
186293	186348	186349	186349	Gentlemen	1335	’ The noise continued , notwithstanding his appearance , until Gashford looked round . There was silence immediately -- even among the people in the passages without , and on the other staircases , who could neither see nor hear , but to whom , notwithstanding , the signal was conveyed with marvellous rapidity . ‘
186351	186363	186349	186349	Gentlemen	1335	’ said Lord George , who was very pale and agitated , ‘
186415	186416	186417	186417	We	4369	’ ‘
186423	186465	186466	186466	I	0	’ echoed the crowd . And so among their shouts and cheers and other cries , he bowed to them and retired , and presently came back again . There was another gesture from Gashford , and a dead silence directly . ‘
186470	186477	186516	186516	Providence	263	’ he said , this time , ‘
186525	186712	186713	186713	You	4372	’ This speech being a little more temperate than the last , was not so favourably received . When the noise and exasperation were at their height , he came back once more , and told them that the alarm had gone forth for many miles round ; that when the King heard of their assembling together in that great body , he had no doubt , His Majesty would send down private orders to have their wishes complied with ; and -- with the manner of his speech as childish , irresolute , and uncertain as his matter -- was proceeding in this strain , when two gentlemen suddenly appeared at the door where he stood , and pressing past him and coming a step or two lower down upon the stairs , confronted the people . The boldness of this action quite took them by surprise . They were not the less disconcerted , when one of the gentlemen , turning to Lord George , spoke thus -- in a loud voice that they might hear him well , but quite coolly and collectedly : ‘
186849	186850	186852	186852	my	0	’ ‘
186856	186868	186854	186854	George	323	’ said the other gentleman , addressing him in like manner , ‘
186926	187057	186908	186908	I	0	’ With that , they stepped back again , keeping their faces towards the crowd ; took each an arm of the misguided nobleman ; drew him into the passage , and shut the door ; which they directly locked and fastened on the inside . This was so quickly done , and the demeanour of both gentlemen -- who were not young men either -- was so gallant and resolute , that the crowd faltered and stared at each other with irresolute and timid looks . Many tried to turn towards the door ; some of the faintest - hearted cried they had best go back , and called to those behind to give way ; and the panic and confusion were increasing rapidly , when Gashford whispered Hugh . ‘
187061	187070	186908	186908	I	0	’ Hugh roared aloud , turning towards them . ‘
187148	188444	188504	188504	I	0	’ Without the delay of an instant , he threw himself headlong over the bannisters into the lobby below . He had hardly touched the ground when Barnaby was at his side . The chaplain ’s assistant , and some members who were imploring the people to retire , immediately withdrew ; and then , with a great shout , both crowds threw themselves against the doors pell - mell , and besieged the House in earnest . At that moment , when a second onset must have brought them into collision with those who stood on the defensive within , in which case great loss of life and bloodshed would inevitably have ensued,--the hindmost portion of the crowd gave way , and the rumour spread from mouth to mouth that a messenger had been despatched by water for the military , who were forming in the street . Fearful of sustaining a charge in the narrow passages in which they were so closely wedged together , the throng poured out as impetuously as they had flocked in . As the whole stream turned at once , Barnaby and Hugh went with it : and so , fighting and struggling and trampling on fallen men and being trampled on in turn themselves , they and the whole mass floated by degrees into the open street , where a large detachment of the Guards , both horse and foot , came hurrying up ; clearing the ground before them so rapidly that the people seemed to melt away as they advanced . The word of command to halt being given , the soldiers formed across the street ; the rioters , breathless and exhausted with their late exertions , formed likewise , though in a very irregular and disorderly manner . The commanding officer rode hastily into the open space between the two bodies , accompanied by a magistrate and an officer of the House of Commons , for whose accommodation a couple of troopers had hastily dismounted . The Riot Act was read , but not a man stirred . In the first rank of the insurgents , Barnaby and Hugh stood side by side . Somebody had thrust into Barnaby ’s hands when he came out into the street , his precious flag ; which , being now rolled up and tied round the pole , looked like a giant quarter - staff as he grasped it firmly and stood upon his guard . If ever man believed with his whole heart and soul that he was engaged in a just cause , and that he was bound to stand by his leader to the last , poor Barnaby believed it of himself and Lord George Gordon . After an ineffectual attempt to make himself heard , the magistrate gave the word and the Horse Guards came riding in among the crowd . But , even then , he galloped here and there , exhorting the people to disperse ; and , although heavy stones were thrown at the men , and some were desperately cut and bruised , they had no orders but to make prisoners of such of the rioters as were the most active , and to drive the people back with the flat of their sabres . As the horses came in among them , the throng gave way at many points , and the Guards , following up their advantage , were rapidly clearing the ground , when two or three of the foremost , who were in a manner cut off from the rest by the people closing round them , made straight towards Barnaby and Hugh , who had no doubt been pointed out as the two men who dropped into the lobby : laying about them now with some effect , and inflicting on the more turbulent of their opponents , a few slight flesh wounds , under the influence of which a man dropped , here and there , into the arms of his fellows , amid much groaning and confusion . At the sight of gashed and bloody faces , seen for a moment in the crowd , then hidden by the press around them , Barnaby turned pale and sick . But he stood his ground , and grasping his pole more firmly yet , kept his eye fixed upon the nearest soldier -- nodding his head meanwhile , as Hugh , with a scowling visage , whispered in his ear . The soldier came spurring on , making his horse rear as the people pressed about him , cutting at the hands of those who would have grasped his rein and forced his charger back , and waving to his comrades to follow -- and still Barnaby , without retreating an inch , waited for his coming . Some called to him to fly , and some were in the very act of closing round him , to prevent his being taken , when the pole swept into the air above the people ’s heads , and the man ’s saddle was empty in an instant . Then , he and Hugh turned and fled , the crowd opening to let them pass , and closing up again so quickly that there was no clue to the course they had taken . Panting for breath , hot , dusty , and exhausted with fatigue , they reached the riverside in safety , and getting into a boat with all despatch were soon out of any immediate danger . As they glided down the river , they plainly heard the people cheering ; and supposing they might have forced the soldiers to retreat , lay upon their oars for a few minutes , uncertain whether to return or not . But the crowd passing along Westminster Bridge , soon assured them that the populace were dispersing ; and Hugh rightly guessed from this , that they had cheered the magistrate for offering to dismiss the military on condition of their immediate departure to their several homes , and that he and Barnaby were better where they were . He advised , therefore , that they should proceed to Blackfriars , and , going ashore at the bridge , make the best of their way to The Boot ; where there was not only good entertainment and safe lodging , but where they would certainly be joined by many of their late companions . Barnaby assenting , they decided on this course of action , and pulled for Blackfriars accordingly . They landed at a critical time , and fortunately for themselves at the right moment . For , coming into Fleet Street , they found it in an unusual stir ; and inquiring the cause , were told that a body of Horse Guards had just galloped past , and that they were escorting some rioters whom they had made prisoners , to Newgate for safety . Not at all ill - pleased to have so narrowly escaped the cavalcade , they lost no more time in asking questions , but hurried to The Boot with as much speed as Hugh considered it prudent to make , without appearing singular or attracting an inconvenient share of public notice . Chapter 50 They were among the first to reach the tavern , but they had not been there many minutes , when several groups of men who had formed part of the crowd , came straggling in . Among them were Simon Tappertit and Mr Dennis ; both of whom , but especially the latter , greeted Barnaby with the utmost warmth , and paid him many compliments on the prowess he had shown . ‘
188447	188480	188504	188504	I	0	’ said Dennis , with an oath , as he rested his bludgeon in a corner with his hat upon it , and took his seat at the same table with them , ‘
188532	188537	188704	188705	the hangman	3437	’m disgusted with humanity . ’
188538	188543	188545	188546	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ On what account ? ’
188562	188574	188545	188546	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Do n’t you consider this a good beginning , mister ? ’
188575	188585	188587	188588	the hangman	3437	‘ Give me security that it an’t a ending , ’
188590	188702	188704	188705	the hangman	3437	‘ When that soldier went down , we might have made London ours ; but no;--we stand , and gape , and look on -- the justice ( I wish he had had a bullet in each eye , as he would have had , if we ’d gone to work my way ) says , “ My lads , if you ’ll give me your word to disperse , I ’ll order off the military , ” our people sets up a hurrah , throws up the game with the winning cards in their hands , and skulks away like a pack of tame curs as they are . Ah , ’
188714	188736	188704	188705	the hangman	3437	‘ it makes me blush for my feller creeturs . I wish I had been born a ox , I do ! ’
188737	188755	188757	188758	Simon Tappertit	223	‘ You ’d have been quite as agreeable a character if you had been , I think , ’
188767	188776	188778	188779	the hangman	3437	‘ Do n’t be too sure of that , ’
188785	188817	188778	188779	the hangman	3437	‘ if I was a horned animal at the present moment , with the smallest grain of sense , I ’d toss every man in this company , excepting them two , ’
188823	188833	188819	188819	Hugh	198	‘ for his manner of conducting himself this day . ’
189157	189165	189167	189168	the Secretary	9531	‘ Oh ! you ARE here then ? ’
189170	189174	189167	189168	the Secretary	9531	‘ Dear me ! ’
189175	189186	189187	189187	Dennis	187	‘ Why , where should we be , Muster Gashford ! ’
189197	189203	189204	189204	he	187	‘ Oh nowhere , nowhere , ’
189210	189236	189204	189204	he	187	‘ The streets are filled with blue cockades . I rather thought you might have been among them . I am glad you are not . ’
189237	189248	189250	189250	Hugh	198	‘ You have orders for us , master , then ? ’
189252	189280	189250	189250	Hugh	198	‘ Oh dear , no . Not I. No orders , my good fellow . What orders should I have ? You are not in my service . ’

189289	189300	189287	189287	Dennis	187	‘ we belong to the cause , do n’t we ? ’
189301	189305	189307	189308	the secretary	9531	‘ The cause ! ’
189319	189330	189307	189308	the secretary	9531	‘ There is no cause . The cause is lost . ’
189331	189334	189287	189287	Dennis	187	‘ Lost ! ’
189335	189398	189400	189400	he	187	‘ Oh yes . You have heard , I suppose ? The petition is rejected by a hundred and ninety - two , to six . It ’s quite final .

189523	189526	189528	189529	the secretary	9531	‘ Because , ’
189542	189569	189528	189529	the secretary	9531	‘ because to sit still and wear it , or to fall asleep and wear it , is a mockery . That ’s all , friend . ’

189584	189587	189589	189589	Gashford	325	‘ Nothing , ’

189771	189777	189759	189769	another man who dropped into the lobby from the stairs above	4414	’ said Gashford , coldly ; ‘

189791	189798	189789	189789	master	7428	’ cried Hugh , starting up . ‘

You ’ll find it your best policy , I have no doubt . ’
189900	189904	189906	189906	Hugh	198	‘ Come on ! ’

189945	189950	189952	189952	Hugh	198	‘ Anywhere ! Anything ! ’
189954	189974	189952	189952	Hugh	198	‘ Stand aside , master , or the window will serve our turn as well . Let us out ! ’

190132	190183	190184	190184	I	0	’ Hugh poised his sturdy arm aloft , and clapping Barnaby on the back , bade him fear nothing . They shook hands together -- poor Barnaby evidently possessed with the idea that he was among the most virtuous and disinterested heroes in the world -- and Gashford laughed again . ‘
190187	190220	190184	190184	I	0	’ he said smoothly , as he stood among them with a great measure of liquor in his hand , and filled their glasses as quickly and as often as they chose , ‘

190315	190343	190313	190313	Hugh	198	‘ No jails and halter for Barnaby and me . They must be frightened out of that . Leaders are wanted , are they ? Now boys ! ’

192446	192667	192668	192668	Simon	223	’ cried the well - known voice of Mr Tappertit . Gabriel opened the door , and gave him admission . He did not cut a very insinuating figure , for a man of his stature suffers in a crowd ; and having been active in yesterday morning ’s work , his dress was literally crushed from head to foot : his hat being beaten out of all shape , and his shoes trodden down at heel like slippers . His coat fluttered in strips about him , the buckles were torn away both from his knees and feet , half his neckerchief was gone , and the bosom of his shirt was rent to tatters . Yet notwithstanding all these personal disadvantages ; despite his being very weak from heat and fatigue ; and so begrimed with mud and dust that he might have been in a case , for anything of the real texture ( either of his skin or apparel ) that the eye could discern ; he stalked haughtily into the parlour , and throwing himself into a chair , and endeavouring to thrust his hands into the pockets of his small - clothes , which were turned inside out and displayed upon his legs , like tassels , surveyed the household with a gloomy dignity . ‘
192670	192676	192668	192668	Simon	223	’ said the locksmith gravely , ‘

192804	192836	192802	192802	Martha	213	’ said the locksmith , turning to his wife , and shaking his head sorrowfully , while a smile at the absurd figure beside him still played upon his open face , ‘

192945	192954	192934	192934	I	0	’ said the locksmith in a serious tone ; ‘

193059	193075	193077	193077	Simon	223	‘ He was not at Duke Street , or at Warwick Street , G. Varden , ’
193081	193134	193135	193135	he	223	‘ but he WAS at Westminster . Perhaps , sir , he kicked a county member , perhaps , sir , he tapped a lord -- you may stare , sir , I repeat it -- blood flowed from noses , and perhaps he tapped a lord . Who knows ? This , ’
193166	193178	193162	193163	Mrs Varden	219	‘ this was a bishop ’s . Beware , G. Varden ! ’
193179	193186	193188	193189	the locksmith	7447	‘ Now , I would rather , ’
193192	193218	193188	193189	the locksmith	7447	‘ have paid five hundred pounds , than had this come to pass . You idiot , do you know what peril you stand in ? ’
193219	193226	193228	193229	his journeyman	10893	‘ I know it , sir , ’
193231	193260	193228	193229	his journeyman	10893	‘ and it is my glory . I was there , everybody saw me there . I was conspicuous , and prominent . I will abide the consequences . ’

193347	193496	193340	193340	I	0	’ said Varden , turning hurriedly to his wife , and he washes himself clean and changes his dress , he may get to the Tower Stairs , and away by the Gravesend tide - boat , before any search is made for him . From there he can easily get on to Canterbury , where your cousin will give him work till this storm has blown over . I am not sure that I do right in screening him from the punishment he deserves , but he has lived in this house , man and boy , for a dozen years , and I should be sorry if for this one day ’s work he made a miserable end . Lock the front - door , Miggs , and show no light towards the street when you go upstairs . Quick , Simon ! Get to bed ! ’
193497	193505	193507	193508	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ And do you suppose , sir , ’
193550	193551	193553	193553	you	223	’ ‘

193588	193638	193639	193639	You	223	’ cried the two women together . Mr Tappertit stood upon his feet , and pushing his chair away to show that he needed no assistance , answered , swaying himself to and fro , and managing his head as if it had no connection whatever with his body : ‘
193651	193652	193653	193654	Oh Simmun	254	’ ‘
193656	193666	193653	193654	Oh Simmun	254	’ ejaculated that young lady in a faint voice . ‘
193685	193686	193680	193680	he	4530	’ ‘
193696	193712	193694	193694	sir	7320	’ returned Mr Tappertit , after glancing at her with a smile of ineffable disdain , ‘
193751	193786	193787	193792	All good friends to our cause	4535	’ With these words he held out at arm ’s length , a dirty , crumpled scrap of writing . The locksmith took it from him , opened it , and read as follows : ‘
193835	193836	193832	193833	GEORGE GORDON	323	’ ‘
193841	193851	193832	193833	GEORGE GORDON	323	’ said the locksmith , with an altered face . ‘

193958	193962	193954	193956	A fiery devil	4543	’ retorted Sim ; ‘
193980	193997	193979	193979	you	1503	’re done for , my buck . Be warned in time , G. Varden . Farewell ! ’
194062	194067	194069	194070	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ I tell you , ’
194072	194106	194069	194070	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ that my mind is made up . My bleeding country calls me and I go ! Miggs , if you do n’t get out of the way , I ’ll pinch you . ’
194141	194145	194147	194147	Simon	223	‘ Release me , ’
194163	194198	194147	194147	Simon	223	‘ Let me go ! I have made arrangements for you in an altered state of society , and mean to provide for you comfortably in life -- there ! Will that satisfy you ? ’
194199	194203	194205	194206	Miss Miggs	239	‘ Oh Simmun ! ’
194208	194226	194205	194206	Miss Miggs	239	‘ Oh my blessed Simmun ! Oh mim ! what are my feelings at this conflicting moment ! ’
194318	194322	194324	194324	Simon	223	‘ I leave , ’
194341	194353	194324	194324	Simon	223	‘ a box of things upstairs . Do what you like with ‘

194416	194427	194429	194429	you	586	’ returned the locksmith , planting himself in the doorway . ‘

194449	194454	194447	194447	Varden	219	’ rejoined Simon Tappertit . ‘

194508	194513	194496	194496	I	0	’ replied the locksmith . ‘
194521	194593	194496	194496	I	0	’ Simon made no answer , but gathering himself up as straight as he could , plunged head foremost at his old master , and the two went driving out into the workshop together , plying their hands and feet so briskly that they looked like half - a - dozen , while Miggs and Mrs Varden screamed for twelve . It would have been easy for Varden to knock his old ‘
194985	194996	194998	194999	the locksmith	7447	‘ Go thy ways , Sim , go thy ways , ’
195008	195037	194998	194999	the locksmith	7447	‘ I have done my best for thee , poor lad , and would have saved thee , but the rope is round thy neck , I fear . ’
195298	195303	195305	195305	Varden	219	‘ Yes , yes , ’
195307	195384	195305	195305	Varden	219	‘ of course -- I know that . I do n’t mean to reproach you , my dear . But recollect from this time that all good things perverted to evil purposes , are worse than those which are naturally bad . A thoroughly wicked woman , is wicked indeed . When religion goes wrong , she is very wrong , for the same reason . Let us say no more about it , my dear . ’
195441	195444	195446	195447	the locksmith	7447	‘ That , ’
195449	195474	195446	195447	the locksmith	7447	‘ is easily disposed of , and I would to Heaven that everything growing out of the same society could be settled as easily . ’
195475	195483	195489	195489	her	7765	‘ It happens very fortunately , Varden , ’
195495	195514	195489	195489	her	7765	‘ that in case any more disturbances should happen -- which I hope not ; I sincerely hope not-- ’
195515	195524	195446	195447	the locksmith	7447	‘ I hope so too , my dear . ’
195525	195547	195557	195558	the locksmith	7447	‘ --That in case any should occur , we have the piece of paper which that poor misguided young man brought . ’
195548	195555	195557	195558	the locksmith	7447	‘ Ay , to be sure , ’
195564	195572	195557	195558	the locksmith	7447	‘ Where is that piece of paper ? ’
195598	195603	195604	195604	she	219	‘ Not use it ? ’
195607	195611	195613	195614	the locksmith	7447	‘ Use it ! ’
195765	195766	195754	195754	I	0	’ ‘
195770	195775	195754	195754	I	0	’ said his wife . ‘
195778	195784	195754	195754	I	0	’ replied the locksmith cheerily , ‘
195836	196408	196409	196409	I	0	’ With that he gave his wife a hearty kiss , and bade her delay no longer , or it would be time to rise before she lay down to rest . Mrs Varden quite amiably and meekly walked upstairs , followed by Miggs , who , although a good deal subdued , could not refrain from sundry stimulative coughs and sniffs by the way , or from holding up her hands in astonishment at the daring conduct of master . Chapter 52 A mob is usually a creature of very mysterious existence , particularly in a large city . Where it comes from or whither it goes , few men can tell . Assembling and dispersing with equal suddenness , it is as difficult to follow to its various sources as the sea itself ; nor does the parallel stop here , for the ocean is not more fickle and uncertain , more terrible when roused , more unreasonable , or more cruel . The people who were boisterous at Westminster upon the Friday morning , and were eagerly bent upon the work of devastation in Duke Street and Warwick Street at night , were , in the mass , the same . Allowing for the chance accessions of which any crowd is morally sure in a town where there must always be a large number of idle and profligate persons , one and the same mob was at both places . Yet they spread themselves in various directions when they dispersed in the afternoon , made no appointment for reassembling , had no definite purpose or design , and indeed , for anything they knew , were scattered beyond the hope of future union . At The Boot , which , as has been shown , was in a manner the head - quarters of the rioters , there were not , upon this Friday night , a dozen people . Some slept in the stable and outhouses , some in the common room , some two or three in beds . The rest were in their usual homes or haunts . Perhaps not a score in all lay in the adjacent fields and lanes , and under haystacks , or near the warmth of brick - kilns , who had not their accustomed place of rest beneath the open sky . As to the public ways within the town , they had their ordinary nightly occupants , and no others ; the usual amount of vice and wretchedness , but no more . The experience of one evening , however , had taught the reckless leaders of disturbance , that they had but to show themselves in the streets , to be immediately surrounded by materials which they could only have kept together when their aid was not required , at great risk , expense , and trouble . Once possessed of this secret , they were as confident as if twenty thousand men , devoted to their will , had been encamped about them , and assumed a confidence which could not have been surpassed , though that had really been the case . All day , Saturday , they remained quiet . On Sunday , they rather studied how to keep their men within call , and in full hope , than to follow out , by any fierce measure , their first day ’s proceedings . ‘
196412	196454	196409	196409	I	0	’ said Dennis , as , with a loud yawn , he raised his body from a heap of straw on which he had been sleeping , and supporting his head upon his hand , appealed to Hugh on Sunday morning , ‘
196474	196475	196463	196463	he	325	’ ‘
196493	196499	196500	196500	I	0	’ growled Hugh in answer . ‘
196501	196512	196479	196479	his	325	’m in no humour to stir yet , though . I ’m
196539	196540	196541	196541	You	0	’ ‘
196551	196579	196580	196580	you	0	’ said Dennis , looking with great admiration at the uncombed head , matted beard , and torn hands and face of the wild figure before him ; ‘
196581	196616	196541	196541	You	0	’re such a devil of a fellow . You hurt yourself a hundred times more than you need , because you will be foremost in everything , and will do more than the rest . ’
196617	196624	196626	196626	Hugh	198	‘ For the matter of that , ’
196646	196678	196626	196626	Hugh	198	‘ there ’s one yonder as good as me . What did I tell you about him ? Did I say he was worth a dozen , when you doubted him ? ’
196715	196794	196796	196797	Mr Dennis	187	‘ Ay , ay , you knew him , brother , you knew him . But who ’d suppose to look at that chap now , that he could be the man he is ! Is n’t it a thousand cruel pities , brother , that instead of taking his nat’ral rest and qualifying himself for further exertions in this here honourable cause , he should be playing at soldiers like a boy ? And his cleanliness too ! ’
196818	196912	196796	196797	Mr Dennis	187	‘ what weaknesses he ’s guilty of ; with respect to his cleanliness ! At five o’clock this morning , there he was at the pump , though any one would think he had gone through enough , the day before yesterday , to be pretty fast asleep at that time . But no -- when I woke for a minute or two , there he was at the pump , and if you ’d seen him sticking them peacock ’s feathers into his hat when he ’d done washing -- ah ! I ’m
196936	197184	196796	196797	Mr Dennis	187	’ The subject of this dialogue and of these concluding remarks , which were uttered in a tone of philosophical meditation , was , as the reader will have divined , no other than Barnaby , who , with his flag in hand , stood sentry in the little patch of sunlight at the distant door , or walked to and fro outside , singing softly to himself ; and keeping time to the music of some clear church bells . Whether he stood still , leaning with both hands on the flagstaff , or , bearing it upon his shoulder , paced slowly up and down , the careful arrangement of his poor dress , and his erect and lofty bearing , showed how high a sense he had of the great importance of his trust , and how happy and how proud it made him . To Hugh and his companion , who lay in a dark corner of the gloomy shed , he , and the sunlight , and the peaceful Sabbath sound to which he made response , seemed like a bright picture framed by the door , and set off by the stable ’s blackness . The whole formed such a contrast to themselves , as they lay wallowing , like some obscene animals , in their squalor and wickedness on the two heaps of straw , that for a few moments they looked on without speaking , and felt almost ashamed . ‘
197187	197200	196796	196797	Mr Dennis	187	’ said Hugh at length , carrying it off with a laugh : ‘
197241	197242	197234	197234	I	0	’ ‘
197263	197279	197258	197258	I	0	’ retorted Dennis with a broad grin , and an oath of the same quality . ‘
197286	197287	197284	197284	brother	9503	’ ‘
197293	197304	197284	197284	brother	9503	’ said Hugh , crawling a little nearer to him , ‘
197333	197354	197356	197358	our noble captain	4611	’ Dennis looked to where Simon Tappertit lay coiled upon a truss of hay , snoring profoundly , and nodded . ‘
197360	197367	197356	197358	our noble captain	4611	’ continued Hugh with another laugh , ‘
197390	197391	197393	197394	the Papists	332	’ ‘
197396	197404	197393	197394	the Papists	332	’ asked Dennis , rubbing his hands . ‘
197414	197436	197393	197394	the Papists	332	‘ em at least , that some of us , and I for one , owe a good heavy grudge to . ’
197437	197455	197457	197457	Dennis	187	‘ Not Muster Gashford ’s friend that he spoke to us about in my house , eh ? ’
197464	197469	197471	197471	Hugh	198	‘ The same man , ’
197473	197479	197481	197482	Mr Dennis	187	‘ That ’s your sort , ’
197490	197524	197481	197482	Mr Dennis	187	‘ that ’s the kind of game . Let ’s have revenges and injuries , and all that , and we shall get on twice as fast . Now you talk , indeed ! ’
197525	197533	197535	197535	Hugh	198	‘ Ha ha ha ! The captain , ’
197537	197558	197535	197535	Hugh	198	‘ has thoughts of carrying off a woman in the bustle , and -- ha ha ha!--and so have I ! ’
197669	197761	197662	197662	Hugh	198	‘ Why , the people we mean to visit , were friends of his , once upon a time , and I know that much of him to feel pretty sure that if he thought we were going to do them any harm , he ’d be no friend to our side , but would lend a ready hand to the other . So I ’ve persuaded him ( for I know him of old ) that Lord George has picked him out to guard this place to - morrow while we ’re
197814	197826	197797	197797	you	4619	’ Mr Dennis exhausted himself in compliments , and then added , ‘
197832	197833	197797	197797	you	4619	’ ‘
197837	197841	197797	197797	you	4619	’ said Hugh , ‘
197917	197936	197953	197953	captain	7793	’ he added , rolling back the straw , and pointing to where the ground was newly turned , ‘
197955	198781	197953	197953	captain	7793	’ Mr Tappertit received these jovial promptings with a very bad grace , being much the worse , both in mind and body , for his two nights of debauch , and but indifferently able to stand upon his legs . With Hugh ’s assistance , however , he contrived to stagger to the pump ; and having refreshed himself with an abundant draught of cold water , and a copious shower of the same refreshing liquid on his head and face , he ordered some rum and milk to be served ; and upon that innocent beverage and some biscuits and cheese made a pretty hearty meal . That done , he disposed himself in an easy attitude on the ground beside his two companions ( who were carousing after their own tastes ) , and proceeded to enlighten Mr Dennis in reference to to - morrow ’s project . That their conversation was an interesting one , was rendered manifest by its length , and by the close attention of all three . That it was not of an oppressively grave character , but was enlivened by various pleasantries arising out of the subject , was clear from their loud and frequent roars of laughter , which startled Barnaby on his post , and made him wonder at their levity . But he was not summoned to join them , until they had eaten , and drunk , and slept , and talked together for some hours ; not , indeed , until the twilight ; when they informed him that they were about to make a slight demonstration in the streets -- just to keep the people ’s hands in , as it was Sunday night , and the public might otherwise be disappointed -- and that he was free to accompany them if he would . Without the slightest preparation , saving that they carried clubs and wore the blue cockade , they sallied out into the streets ; and , with no more settled design than that of doing as much mischief as they could , paraded them at random . Their numbers rapidly increasing , they soon divided into parties ; and agreeing to meet by - and - by , in the fields near Welbeck Street , scoured the town in various directions . The largest body , and that which augmented with the greatest rapidity , was the one to which Hugh and Barnaby belonged . This took its way towards Moorfields , where there was a rich chapel , and in which neighbourhood several Catholic families were known to reside . Beginning with the private houses so occupied , they broke open the doors and windows ; and while they destroyed the furniture and left but the bare walls , made a sharp search for tools and engines of destruction , such as hammers , pokers , axes , saws , and such like instruments . Many of the rioters made belts of cord , of handkerchiefs , or any material they found at hand , and wore these weapons as openly as pioneers upon a field - day . There was not the least disguise or concealment -- indeed , on this night , very little excitement or hurry . From the chapels , they tore down and took away the very altars , benches , pulpits , pews , and flooring ; from the dwelling - houses , the very wainscoting and stairs . This Sunday evening ’s recreation they pursued like mere workmen who had a certain task to do , and did it . Fifty resolute men might have turned them at any moment ; a single company of soldiers could have scattered them like dust ; but no man interposed , no authority restrained them , and , except by the terrified persons who fled from their approach , they were as little heeded as if they were pursuing their lawful occupations with the utmost sobriety and good conduct . In the same manner , they marched to the place of rendezvous agreed upon , made great fires in the fields , and reserving the most valuable of their spoils , burnt the rest . Priestly garments , images of saints , rich stuffs and ornaments , altar - furniture and household goods , were cast into the flames , and shed a glare on the whole country round ; but they danced and howled , and roared about these fires till they were tired , and were never for an instant checked . As the main body filed off from this scene of action , and passed down Welbeck Street , they came upon Gashford , who had been a witness of their proceedings , and was walking stealthily along the pavement . Keeping up with him , and yet not seeming to speak , Hugh muttered in his ear : ‘
198788	198789	198786	198786	master	7428	’ ‘
198792	198796	198786	198786	master	7428	’ said Gashford . ‘
198801	198802	198805	198805	you	7428	’ ‘
198808	198812	198805	198805	you	7428	’ said Hugh . ‘
198829	198830	198831	198831	I	0	’ ‘
198836	198856	198831	198831	I	0	’ said Gashford , pinching his arm with such malevolence that his nails seemed to meet in the skin ; ‘
198888	198889	198883	198883	you	7428	’ ‘
198896	198900	198894	198894	master	7428	’ said Hugh . ‘
198925	199702	199703	199703	Dennis	187	’ With that , he fell back into his place beside Barnaby ; and when the secretary looked after him , both were lost in the crowd . Chapter 53 The next day was ushered in by merry peals of bells , and by the firing of the Tower guns ; flags were hoisted on many of the church - steeples ; the usual demonstrations were made in honour of the anniversary of the King ’s birthday ; and every man went about his pleasure or business as if the city were in perfect order , and there were no half - smouldering embers in its secret places , which , on the approach of night , would kindle up again and scatter ruin and dismay abroad . The leaders of the riot , rendered still more daring by the success of last night and by the booty they had acquired , kept steadily together , and only thought of implicating the mass of their followers so deeply that no hope of pardon or reward might tempt them to betray their more notorious confederates into the hands of justice . Indeed , the sense of having gone too far to be forgiven , held the timid together no less than the bold . Many who would readily have pointed out the foremost rioters and given evidence against them , felt that escape by that means was hopeless , when their every act had been observed by scores of people who had taken no part in the disturbances ; who had suffered in their persons , peace , or property , by the outrages of the mob ; who would be most willing witnesses ; and whom the government would , no doubt , prefer to any King ’s evidence that might be offered . Many of this class had deserted their usual occupations on the Saturday morning ; some had been seen by their employers active in the tumult ; others knew they must be suspected , and that they would be discharged if they returned ; others had been desperate from the beginning , and comforted themselves with the homely proverb , that , being hanged at all , they might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb . They all hoped and believed , in a greater or less degree , that the government they seemed to have paralysed , would , in its terror , come to terms with them in the end , and suffer them to make their own conditions . The least sanguine among them reasoned with himself that , at the worst , they were too many to be all punished , and that he had as good a chance of escape as any other man . The great mass never reasoned or thought at all , but were stimulated by their own headlong passions , by poverty , by ignorance , by the love of mischief , and the hope of plunder . One other circumstance is worthy of remark ; and that is , that from the moment of their first outbreak at Westminster , every symptom of order or preconcerted arrangement among them vanished . When they divided into parties and ran to different quarters of the town , it was on the spontaneous suggestion of the moment . Each party swelled as it went along , like rivers as they roll towards the sea ; new leaders sprang up as they were wanted , disappeared when the necessity was over , and reappeared at the next crisis . Each tumult took shape and form from the circumstances of the moment ; sober workmen , going home from their day ’s labour , were seen to cast down their baskets of tools and become rioters in an instant ; mere boys on errands did the like . In a word , a moral plague ran through the city . The noise , and hurry , and excitement , had for hundreds and hundreds an attraction they had no firmness to resist . The contagion spread like a dread fever : an infectious madness , as yet not near its height , seized on new victims every hour , and society began to tremble at their ravings . It was between two and three o’clock in the afternoon when Gashford looked into the lair described in the last chapter , and seeing only Barnaby and Dennis there , inquired for Hugh . He was out , Barnaby told him ; had gone out more than an hour ago ; and had not yet returned . ‘
199705	199727	199728	199728	Dennis	187	’ said the smiling secretary , in his smoothest voice , as he sat down cross - legged on a barrel , ‘
199730	199751	199728	199728	Dennis	187	’ The hangman struggled into a sitting posture directly , and with his eyes wide open , looked towards him . ‘
199759	199765	199757	199757	Dennis	187	’ said Gashford , nodding . ‘
199780	199781	199778	199778	Dennis	187	’ ‘

199909	199920	199901	199901	I	0	’ said Gashford , in his unvarying , even tone . ‘
199926	199955	199956	199956	I	0	’ Mr Dennis looked round as in expectation of beholding him asleep upon his bed of straw ; then remembering he had seen him go out , replied : ‘

199992	199997	199985	199986	Muster Gashford	325	’ said the secretary , ‘
200040	200085	200015	200015	You	0	’ Dennis , who was very much baffled by the cool matter - of - course manner of this reply , recovered his self - possession on his professional pursuits being referred to , and pointing towards Barnaby , shook his head and frowned . ‘

200103	200112	200100	200101	Muster Gashford	325	’ said the hangman in a low voice , ‘

200192	200234	200189	200189	they	4634	’ he cried , joyfully welcoming Hugh with both hands , and then patting him fondly on the back , as if instead of being the rough companion he was , he had been one of the most prepossessing of men . ‘

200305	200308	200310	200310	Barnaby	220	‘ Hearty ! ’
200316	200365	200310	200310	Barnaby	220	‘ Ha ha ha ! And merry too , Hugh ! And ready to do anything for the good cause , and the right , and to help the kind , mild , pale - faced gentleman -- the lord they used so ill -- eh , Hugh ? ’
200366	200369	200371	200372	his friend	7570	‘ Ay ! ’
200395	200401	200390	200390	he	325	‘ Good day , master ! ’
200402	200409	200411	200412	the secretary	9531	‘ And good day to you , ’
200418	200436	200411	200412	the secretary	9531	‘ And many good days -- whole years of them , I hope . You are heated . ’
200437	200446	200448	200448	Hugh	198	‘ So would you have been , master , ’
200454	200467	200448	200448	Hugh	198	‘ if you ’d been running here as fast as I have . ’
200468	200486	200411	200412	the secretary	9531	‘ You know the news , then ? Yes , I supposed you would have heard it . ’
200487	200493	200411	200412	the secretary	9531	‘ News ! what news ? ’
200494	200499	200501	200501	Gashford	325	‘ You do n’t ? ’
200512	200546	200547	200547	he	325	‘ Dear me ! Come ; then I AM the first to make you acquainted with your distinguished position , after all . Do you see the King ’s Arms a - top ? ’
200573	200576	200578	200578	Hugh	198	‘ Well ! ’
200580	200587	200578	200578	Hugh	198	‘ What ’s that to me ? ’
200588	200595	200597	200598	the secretary	9531	‘ Much . A great deal , ’
200600	200604	200597	200598	the secretary	9531	‘ Read it . ’
200605	200623	200625	200625	Hugh	198	‘ I told you , the first time I saw you , that I could n’t read , ’
200629	200641	200625	200625	Hugh	198	‘ What in the Devil ’s name ’s inside of it ? ’
200642	200653	200655	200655	Gashford	325	‘ It is a proclamation from the King in Council , ’
200657	200710	200655	200655	Gashford	325	‘ dated to - day , and offering a reward of five hundred pounds -- five hundred pounds is a great deal of money , and a large temptation to some people -- to any one who will discover the person or persons most active in demolishing those chapels on Saturday night . ’
200711	200716	200718	200718	Hugh	198	‘ Is that all ? ’
200725	200731	200718	200718	Hugh	198	‘ I knew of that . ’
200732	200741	200743	200743	Gashford	325	‘ Truly I might have known you did , ’
200754	200774	200743	200743	Gashford	325	‘ Your friend , I might have guessed -- indeed I did guess -- was sure to tell you . ’
200775	200779	200781	200781	Hugh	198	‘ My friend ! ’
200791	200795	200781	200781	Hugh	198	‘ What friend ? ’
200796	200812	200814	200814	Gashford	325	‘ Tut tut -- do you suppose I do n’t know where you have been ? ’
200842	200855	200781	200781	Hugh	198	‘ How dull you think me ! Shall I say his name ? ’
200856	200859	200861	200861	Hugh	198	‘ No , ’
200870	200881	200883	200884	the secretary	9531	‘ You have also heard from him , no doubt , ’
200892	200926	200929	200929	he	198	‘ that the rioters who have been taken ( poor fellows ) are committed for trial , and that some very active witnesses have had the temerity to appear against them . Among others-- ’
200955	200978	200936	200936	he	198	‘ Among others , a gentleman who saw the work going on in Warwick Street ; a Catholic gentleman ; one Haredale . ’
201003	201011	201013	201013	Hugh	198	‘ Duty , duty , bold Barnaby ! ’
201038	201109	201122	201122	Sharp	370	‘ Mount guard without loss of time , for we are off upon our expedition . Up , Dennis , and get ready ! Take care that no one turns the straw upon my bed , brave Barnaby ; we know what ’s underneath it -- eh ? Now , master , quick ! What you have to say , say speedily , for the little captain and a cluster of ‘
201135	201206	201207	201207	You	4641	’ Barnaby was not proof against this bustle and despatch . The look of mingled astonishment and anger which had appeared in his face when he turned towards them , faded from it as the words passed from his memory , like breath from a polished mirror ; and grasping the weapon which Hugh forced upon him , he proudly took his station at the door , beyond their hearing . ‘
201216	201220	201207	201207	You	4641	’ said Hugh . ‘
201229	201230	201221	201221	YOU	4641	’ ‘
201242	201246	201247	201247	He	4644	’ urged Gashford . ‘
201277	201281	201282	201282	Dennis	187	’ said Hugh . ‘
201292	201332	201291	201291	they	4646	’re waiting for us ; I came to tell you . Reach me my stick and belt . Here ! Lend a hand , master . Fling this over my shoulder , and buckle it behind , will you ? ’
201333	201338	201340	201341	the secretary	9531	‘ Brisk as ever ! ’
201351	201369	201340	201341	the secretary	9531	‘ A man need be brisk to - day ; there ’s brisk work a - foot . ’
201370	201377	201379	201379	Gashford	325	‘ There is , is there ? ’
201407	201457	201393	201393	Hugh	198	‘ Is there ! You know there is ! Who knows better than you , master , that the first great step to be taken is to make examples of these witnesses , and frighten all men from appearing against us or any of our body , any more ? ’
201458	201466	201468	201468	Gashford	325	‘ There ’s one we know of , ’
201475	201490	201468	201468	Gashford	325	‘ who is at least as well informed upon that subject as you or I. ’
201491	201505	201506	201506	Hugh	198	‘ If we mean the same gentleman , as I suppose we do , ’
201510	201526	201506	201506	Hugh	198	‘ I tell you this -- he ’s as good and quick information about everything as-- ’
201549	201567	201528	201528	he	198	‘ as Old Nick himself . Have you done that , master ? How slow you are ! ’
201568	201575	201577	201577	Gashford	325	‘ It ’s quite fast now , ’
201581	201637	201577	201577	Gashford	325	‘ I say -- you did n’t find that your friend disapproved of to - day ’s little expedition ? Ha ha ha ! It is fortunate it jumps so well with the witness policy ; for , once planned , it must have been carried out . And now you are going , eh ? ’
201638	201646	201647	201647	Hugh	198	‘ Now we are going , master ! ’
201650	201655	201647	201647	Hugh	198	‘ Any parting words ? ’
201656	201662	201664	201664	Gashford	325	‘ Oh dear , no , ’
201667	201670	201664	201664	Gashford	325	‘ None ! ’
201671	201673	201647	201647	Hugh	198	‘ You ’re
201676	201685	201647	201647	Hugh	198	’ cried Hugh , nudging the grinning Dennis . ‘
201694	201737	201691	201692	Muster Gashford	325	’ chuckled the hangman . Gashford paused a moment , struggling with his caution and his malice ; then putting himself between the two men , and laying a hand upon the arm of each , said , in a cramped whisper : ‘
201884	203032	201882	201882	Hugh	198	’ The two looked at him , and at each other ; then bursting into a roar of laughter , brandished their staves above their heads , shook hands , and hurried out . When they had been gone a little time , Gashford followed . They were yet in sight , and hastening to that part of the adjacent fields in which their fellows had already mustered ; Hugh was looking back , and flourishing his hat to Barnaby , who , delighted with his trust , replied in the same way , and then resumed his pacing up and down before the stable - door , where his feet had worn a path already . And when Gashford himself was far distant , and looked back for the last time , he was still walking to and fro , with the same measured tread ; the most devoted and the blithest champion that ever maintained a post , and felt his heart lifted up with a brave sense of duty , and determination to defend it to the last . Smiling at the simplicity of the poor idiot , Gashford betook himself to Welbeck Street by a different path from that which he knew the rioters would take , and sitting down behind a curtain in one of the upper windows of Lord George Gordon ’s house , waited impatiently for their coming . They were so long , that although he knew it had been settled they should come that way , he had a misgiving they must have changed their plans and taken some other route . But at length the roar of voices was heard in the neighbouring fields , and soon afterwards they came thronging past , in a great body . However , they were not all , nor nearly all , in one body , but were , as he soon found , divided into four parties , each of which stopped before the house to give three cheers , and then went on ; the leaders crying out in what direction they were going , and calling on the spectators to join them . The first detachment , carrying , by way of banners , some relics of the havoc they had made in Moorfields , proclaimed that they were on their way to Chelsea , whence they would return in the same order , to make of the spoil they bore , a great bonfire , near at hand . The second gave out that they were bound for Wapping , to destroy a chapel ; the third , that their place of destination was East Smithfield , and their object the same . All this was done in broad , bright , summer day . Gay carriages and chairs stopped to let them pass , or turned back to avoid them ; people on foot stood aside in doorways , or perhaps knocked and begged permission to stand at a window , or in the hall , until the rioters had passed : but nobody interfered with them ; and when they had gone by , everything went on as usual . There still remained the fourth body , and for that the secretary looked with a most intense eagerness . At last it came up . It was numerous , and composed of picked men ; for as he gazed down among them , he recognised many upturned faces which he knew well -- those of Simon Tappertit , Hugh , and Dennis in the front , of course . They halted and cheered , as the others had done ; but when they moved again , they did not , like them , proclaim what design they had . Hugh merely raised his hat upon the bludgeon he carried , and glancing at a spectator on the opposite side of the way , was gone . Gashford followed the direction of his glance instinctively , and saw , standing on the pavement , and wearing the blue cockade , Sir John Chester . He held his hat an inch or two above his head , to propitiate the mob ; and , resting gracefully on his cane , smiling pleasantly , and displaying his dress and person to the very best advantage , looked on in the most tranquil state imaginable . For all that , and quick and dexterous as he was , Gashford had seen him recognise Hugh with the air of a patron . He had no longer any eyes for the crowd , but fixed his keen regards upon Sir John . He stood in the same place and posture until the last man in the concourse had turned the corner of the street ; then very deliberately took the blue cockade out of his hat ; put it carefully in his pocket , ready for the next emergency ; refreshed himself with a pinch of snuff ; put up his box ; and was walking slowly off , when a passing carriage stopped , and a lady ’s hand let down the glass . Sir John ’s hat was off again immediately . After a minute ’s conversation at the carriage - window , in which it was apparent that he was vastly entertaining on the subject of the mob , he stepped lightly in , and was driven away . The secretary smiled , but he had other thoughts to dwell upon , and soon dismissed the topic . Dinner was brought him , but he sent it down untasted ; and , in restless pacings up and down the room , and constant glances at the clock , and many futile efforts to sit down and read , or go to sleep , or look out of the window , consumed four weary hours . When the dial told him thus much time had crept away , he stole upstairs to the top of the house , and coming out upon the roof sat down , with his face towards the east . Heedless of the fresh air that blew upon his heated brow , of the pleasant meadows from which he turned , of the piles of roofs and chimneys upon which he looked , of the smoke and rising mist he vainly sought to pierce , of the shrill cries of children at their evening sports , the distant hum and turmoil of the town , the cheerful country breath that rustled past to meet it , and to droop , and die ; he watched , and watched , till it was dark save for the specks of light that twinkled in the streets below and far away -- and , as the darkness deepened , strained his gaze and grew more eager yet . ‘
203042	203047	203048	203048	Dog	355	’ he muttered restlessly . ‘
203062	203333	203058	203058	you	355	’ Chapter 54 Rumours of the prevailing disturbances had , by this time , begun to be pretty generally circulated through the towns and villages round London , and the tidings were everywhere received with that appetite for the marvellous and love of the terrible which have probably been among the natural characteristics of mankind since the creation of the world . These accounts , however , appeared , to many persons at that day -- as they would to us at the present , but that we know them to be matter of history -- so monstrous and improbable , that a great number of those who were resident at a distance , and who were credulous enough on other points , were really unable to bring their minds to believe that such things could be ; and rejected the intelligence they received on all hands , as wholly fabulous and absurd . Mr Willet -- not so much , perhaps , on account of his having argued and settled the matter with himself , as by reason of his constitutional obstinacy -- was one of those who positively refused to entertain the current topic for a moment . On this very evening , and perhaps at the very time when Gashford kept his solitary watch , old John was so red in the face with perpetually shaking his head in contradiction of his three ancient cronies and pot companions , that he was quite a phenomenon to behold , and lighted up the Maypole Porch wherein they sat together , like a monstrous carbuncle in a fairy tale . ‘
203340	203377	203335	203335	you	4660	’ said Mr Willet , looking hard at Solomon Daisy -- for it was his custom in cases of personal altercation to fasten upon the smallest man in the party--‘do you think , sir , that I ’m
203382	203383	203378	203380	a born fool	4662	’ ‘
203390	203407	203388	203388	Johnny	259	’ returned Solomon , looking round upon the little circle of which he formed a part : ‘
203416	203426	203415	203415	You	259	’re no fool , Johnny . No , no ! ’
203440	203450	203430	203431	Mr Parkes	204	‘ No , no , Johnny , not you ! ’
203484	203501	203469	203469	he	194	‘ Then what do you mean by coming here , and telling me that this evening you ’re
203528	203546	203566	203566	Johnny	259	’ said Mr Willet , putting his pipe in his mouth with an air of solemn disgust , ‘
203557	203558	203566	203566	Johnny	259	’ ‘
203568	203574	203566	203566	Johnny	259	’ pleaded Parkes , humbly . ‘
203583	203595	203575	203575	You	194	’ repeated Mr Willet , eyeing him from top to toe . ‘
203648	203649	203652	203652	Johnny	259	’ ‘
203664	203671	203657	203657	your	259	’ said the adventurous Mr Parkes . ‘
203677	203684	203674	203674	you	194	’ retorted John with great dignity . ‘
203686	203706	203657	203657	your	259	’re a contradicting pretty free , you are , sir . How do YOU know which it is ? I ’m
203716	203793	203795	203795	he	7320	’ Mr Parkes , finding himself in the position of having got into metaphysics without exactly seeing his way out of them , stammered forth an apology and retreated from the argument . There then ensued a silence of some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour , at the expiration of which period Mr Willet was observed to rumble and shake with laughter , and presently remarked , in reference to his late adversary , ‘
203803	203826	203795	203795	he	7320	’ Thereupon Messrs Cobb and Daisy laughed , and nodded , and Parkes was looked upon as thoroughly and effectually put down . ‘
203850	203858	203828	203828	you	194	’ said John , after another silence . ‘
203889	203890	203860	203860	you	194	’ ‘
203898	203903	203895	203895	you	194	’ returned Solomon Daisy , ‘
203968	203969	203941	203941	you	194	’ ‘
203974	203980	203983	203983	sir	7320	’ said Mr Willet testily . ‘

204005	204026	203997	203997	nobody	7945	’ said Solomon , rising , to divert the attention of his two friends , who tittered at this retort : ‘

204072	204083	204067	204067	I	0	’ returned the landlord , putting his into his pockets , ‘
204096	204830	204831	204831	Halloa	236	’ The three cronies were therefore reduced to the necessity of shaking his elbows ; having performed that ceremony , and brought from the house their hats , and sticks , and greatcoats , they bade him good night and departed ; promising to bring him on the morrow full and true accounts of the real state of the city , and if it were quiet , to give him the full merit of his victory . John Willet looked after them , as they plodded along the road in the rich glow of a summer evening ; and knocking the ashes out of his pipe , laughed inwardly at their folly , until his sides were sore . When he had quite exhausted himself -- which took some time , for he laughed as slowly as he thought and spoke -- he sat himself comfortably with his back to the house , put his legs upon the bench , then his apron over his face , and fell sound asleep . How long he slept , matters not ; but it was for no brief space , for when he awoke , the rich light had faded , the sombre hues of night were falling fast upon the landscape , and a few bright stars were already twinkling overhead . The birds were all at roost , the daisies on the green had closed their fairy hoods , the honeysuckle twining round the porch exhaled its perfume in a twofold degree , as though it lost its coyness at that silent time and loved to shed its fragrance on the night ; the ivy scarcely stirred its deep green leaves . How tranquil , and how beautiful it was ! Was there no sound in the air , besides the gentle rustling of the trees and the grasshopper ’s merry chirp ? Hark ! Something very faint and distant , not unlike the murmuring in a sea - shell . Now it grew louder , fainter now , and now it altogether died away . Presently , it came again , subsided , came once more , grew louder , fainter -- swelled into a roar . It was on the road , and varied with its windings . All at once it burst into a distinct sound -- the voices , and the tramping feet of many men . It is questionable whether old John Willet , even then , would have thought of the rioters but for the cries of his cook and housemaid , who ran screaming upstairs and locked themselves into one of the old garrets,--shrieking dismally when they had done so , by way of rendering their place of refuge perfectly secret and secure . These two females did afterwards depone that Mr Willet in his consternation uttered but one word , and called that up the stairs in a stentorian voice , six distinct times . But as this word was a monosyllable , which , however inoffensive when applied to the quadruped it denotes , is highly reprehensible when used in connection with females of unimpeachable character , many persons were inclined to believe that the young women laboured under some hallucination caused by excessive fear ; and that their ears deceived them . Be this as it may , John Willet , in whom the very uttermost extent of dull - headed perplexity supplied the place of courage , stationed himself in the porch , and waited for their coming up . Once , it dimly occurred to him that there was a kind of door to the house , which had a lock and bolts ; and at the same time some shadowy ideas of shutters to the lower windows , flitted through his brain . But he stood stock still , looking down the road in the direction in which the noise was rapidly advancing , and did not so much as take his hands out of his pockets . He had not to wait long . A dark mass , looming through a cloud of dust , soon became visible ; the mob quickened their pace ; shouting and whooping like savages , they came rushing on pell mell ; and in a few seconds he was bandied from hand to hand , in the heart of a crowd of men . ‘
204833	204851	204831	204831	Halloa	236	’ cried a voice he knew , as the man who spoke came cleaving through the throng . ‘
204876	204898	204872	204872	Ha	4688	’ Mr Willet looked at him , and saw it was Hugh ; but he said nothing , and thought nothing . ‘
204907	204918	204921	204921	Jack	259	’ cried Hugh , thrusting him back towards the house . ‘
204948	204955	204946	204946	Jack	259	’ John faintly articulated the words , ‘
204961	204962	204963	204963	He	236	’ ‘
204972	204997	204963	204963	He	236	’ cried Hugh , with a roar of laughter which was loudly echoed by the crowd . Then turning to John , he added , ‘
205004	205758	205002	205002	nobody	7945	’ John stared round at the mass of faces -- some grinning , some fierce , some lighted up by torches , some indistinct , some dusky and shadowy : some looking at him , some at his house , some at each other -- and while he was , as he thought , in the very act of doing so , found himself , without any consciousness of having moved , in the bar ; sitting down in an arm - chair , and watching the destruction of his property , as if it were some queer play or entertainment , of an astonishing and stupefying nature , but having no reference to himself -- that he could make out -- at all . Yes . Here was the bar -- the bar that the boldest never entered without special invitation -- the sanctuary , the mystery , the hallowed ground : here it was , crammed with men , clubs , sticks , torches , pistols ; filled with a deafening noise , oaths , shouts , screams , hootings ; changed all at once into a bear - garden , a madhouse , an infernal temple : men darting in and out , by door and window , smashing the glass , turning the taps , drinking liquor out of China punchbowls , sitting astride of casks , smoking private and personal pipes , cutting down the sacred grove of lemons , hacking and hewing at the celebrated cheese , breaking open inviolable drawers , putting things in their pockets which did n’t belong to them , dividing his own money before his own eyes , wantonly wasting , breaking , pulling down and tearing up : nothing quiet , nothing private : men everywhere -- above , below , overhead , in the bedrooms , in the kitchen , in the yard , in the stables -- clambering in at windows when there were doors wide open ; dropping out of windows when the stairs were handy ; leaping over the bannisters into chasms of passages : new faces and figures presenting themselves every instant -- some yelling , some singing , some fighting , some breaking glass and crockery , some laying the dust with the liquor they could n’t drink , some ringing the bells till they pulled them down , others beating them with pokers till they beat them into fragments : more men still -- more , more , more -- swarming on like insects : noise , smoke , light , darkness , frolic , anger , laughter , groans , plunder , fear , and ruin ! Nearly all the time while John looked on at this bewildering scene , Hugh kept near him ; and though he was the loudest , wildest , most destructive villain there , he saved his old master ’s bones a score of times . Nay , even when Mr Tappertit , excited by liquor , came up , and in assertion of his prerogative politely kicked John Willet on the shins , Hugh bade him return the compliment ; and if old John had had sufficient presence of mind to understand this whispered direction , and to profit by it , he might no doubt , under Hugh ’s protection , have done so with impunity . At length the band began to reassemble outside the house , and to call to those within , to join them , for they were losing time . These murmurs increasing , and attaining a high pitch , Hugh , and some of those who yet lingered in the bar , and who plainly were the leaders of the troop , took counsel together , apart , as to what was to be done with John , to keep him quiet until their Chigwell work was over . Some proposed to set the house on fire and leave him in it ; others , that he should be reduced to a state of temporary insensibility , by knocking on the head ; others , that he should be sworn to sit where he was until to - morrow at the same hour ; others again , that he should be gagged and taken off with them , under a sufficient guard . All these propositions being overruled , it was concluded , at last , to bind him in his chair , and the word was passed for Dennis . ‘
205764	205773	205762	205762	Jack	259	’ said Hugh , striding up to him : ‘
205796	205827	205828	205828	You	259	’ John Willet looked at another man , as if he did n’t know which was the speaker , and muttered something about an ordinary every Sunday at two o’clock . ‘
205844	205863	205840	205840	you	259	’ roared Hugh , impressing the assurance upon him by means of a heavy blow on the back . ‘
205894	205952	205892	205892	you	259	’ A glass of liquor being passed forward , Hugh poured the contents down old John ’s throat . Mr Willet feebly smacked his lips , thrust his hand into his pocket , and inquired what was to pay ; adding , as he looked vacantly round , that he believed there was a trifle of broken glass-- ‘
205968	205992	205953	205953	He	259	’ said Hugh , after shaking him , without any visible effect upon his system , until his keys rattled in his pocket . ‘
205998	206047	205996	205996	Dennis	187	’ The word was again passed , and presently Mr Dennis , with a long cord bound about his middle , something after the manner of a friar , came hurrying in , attended by a body - guard of half - a - dozen of his men . ‘
206054	206065	205996	205996	Dennis	187	’ cried Hugh , stamping his foot upon the ground . ‘
206069	206117	205996	205996	Dennis	187	’ Dennis , with a wink and a nod , unwound the cord from about his person , and raising his eyes to the ceiling , looked all over it , and round the walls and cornice , with a curious eye ; then shook his head . ‘
206126	206138	206120	206120	man	7337	’ cried Hugh , with another impatient stamp of his foot . ‘
206161	206162	206120	206120	man	7337	’ ‘
206172	206180	206170	206170	brother	9503	’ answered Dennis , stepping towards him ; ‘
206183	206210	206120	206120	man	7337	’ and here he whispered in his ear--‘unless we do it over the door , it ca n’t be done at all in this here room . ’
206211	206216	206217	206217	Hugh	198	‘ What ca n’t ? ’
206220	206225	206227	206227	Dennis	187	‘ What ca n’t ! ’
206229	206238	206227	206227	Dennis	187	‘ Why , the old man ca n’t . ’
206239	206250	206252	206252	Hugh	198	‘ Why , you were n’t going to hang him ! ’
206254	206259	206261	206262	the hangman	3437	‘ No , brother ? ’
206267	206271	206272	206272	Hugh	198	‘ What else ? ’
206337	206340	206341	206341	he	198	‘ There , ’
206366	206445	206446	206446	Hugh	198	‘ That ’s what I call pretty and workmanlike . He ’s quite a picter now . But , brother , just a word with you -- now that he ’s ready trussed , as one may say , would n’t it be better for all parties if we was to work him off ? It would read uncommon well in the newspapers , it would indeed . The public would think a great deal more on us ! ’
206495	206498	206524	206525	the rest	561	‘ Forward ! ’
206509	206514	206516	206516	Dennis	187	‘ To the Warren ! ’
206527	206536	206516	206516	Dennis	187	‘ A witness ’s house , my lads ! ’
207174	207182	207158	207158	It	7210	‘ Are you alone in this house ? ’
207301	207310	207312	207313	the man	472	‘ How long have you been sitting thus ? ’
207324	207332	207312	207313	the man	472	‘ Which way have the party gone ? ’
207375	207383	207385	207386	the man	472	‘ You would do well to speak , ’
207388	207414	207385	207386	the man	472	‘ you may keep a whole skin , though you have nothing else left that can be hurt . Which way have the party gone ? ’
207415	207418	207420	207420	John	193	‘ That ! ’
207457	207461	207463	207464	the man	472	‘ You lie ! ’
207473	207484	207463	207464	the man	472	‘ I came that way . You would betray me . ’
207672	207678	207650	207650	he	193	‘ Where are your servants ? ’
207715	207719	207711	207711	He	194	‘ Locked up . ’
207720	207739	207741	207742	the man	472	‘ Well for them if they remain quiet , and well for you if you do the like , ’
207744	207754	207741	207742	the man	472	‘ Now show me the way the party went . ’
208397	209115	208382	208382	Heaven	210	’ he had often peeped at when a little child : shrinking and shuddering -- there was a dreadful thing to think of now!--and clinging to an apron as he looked ! He sank upon the ground , and grovelling down as if he would dig himself a place to hide in , covered his face and ears : but no , no , no,--a hundred walls and roofs of brass would not shut out that bell , for in it spoke the wrathful voice of God , and from that voice , the whole wide universe could not afford a refuge ! While he rushed up and down , not knowing where to turn , and while he lay crouching there , the work went briskly on indeed . When they left the Maypole , the rioters formed into a solid body , and advanced at a quick pace towards the Warren . Rumour of their approach having gone before , they found the garden - doors fast closed , the windows made secure , and the house profoundly dark : not a light being visible in any portion of the building . After some fruitless ringing at the bells , and beating at the iron gates , they drew off a few paces to reconnoitre , and confer upon the course it would be best to take . Very little conference was needed , when all were bent upon one desperate purpose , infuriated with liquor , and flushed with successful riot . The word being given to surround the house , some climbed the gates , or dropped into the shallow trench and scaled the garden wall , while others pulled down the solid iron fence , and while they made a breach to enter by , made deadly weapons of the bars . The house being completely encircled , a small number of men were despatched to break open a tool - shed in the garden ; and during their absence on this errand , the remainder contented themselves with knocking violently at the doors , and calling to those within , to come down and open them on peril of their lives . No answer being returned to this repeated summons , and the detachment who had been sent away , coming back with an accession of pickaxes , spades , and hoes , they,--together with those who had such arms already , or carried ( as many did ) axes , poles , and crowbars,--struggled into the foremost rank , ready to beset the doors and windows . They had not at this time more than a dozen lighted torches among them ; but when these preparations were completed , flaming links were distributed and passed from hand to hand with such rapidity , that , in a minute ’s time , at least two - thirds of the whole roaring mass bore , each man in his hand , a blazing brand . Whirling these about their heads they raised a loud shout , and fell to work upon the doors and windows . Amidst the clattering of heavy blows , the rattling of broken glass , the cries and execrations of the mob , and all the din and turmoil of the scene , Hugh and his friends kept together at the turret - door where Mr Haredale had last admitted him and old John Willet ; and spent their united force on that . It was a strong old oaken door , guarded by good bolts and a heavy bar , but it soon went crashing in upon the narrow stairs behind , and made , as it were , a platform to facilitate their tearing up into the rooms above . Almost at the same moment , a dozen other points were forced , and at every one the crowd poured in like water . A few armed servant - men were posted in the hall , and when the rioters forced an entrance there , they fired some half - a - dozen shots . But these taking no effect , and the concourse coming on like an army of devils , they only thought of consulting their own safety , and retreated , echoing their assailants ’
209946	209949	209950	209950	he	198	‘ Here ! ’
209969	210023	210027	210027	he	198	‘ We have done all we can ; the fire is burning itself out ; and even the corners where it has n’t spread , are nothing but heaps of ruins . Disperse , my lads , while the coast ’s clear ; get back by different ways ; and meet as usual ! ’
211060	211064	211093	211096	neither of the three	4845	‘ No Popery , ’
211216	211227	211213	211213	he	472	‘ Good Heaven , what ’s that ! Another fire ! ’
211283	211289	211291	211292	the horseman	3184	‘ My mind misgives me , ’
211294	211319	211291	211292	the horseman	3184	‘ or I know from what far building those flames come . Do n’t stand aghast , my good fellow . Open the gate ! ’
211320	211323	211325	211326	the man	472	‘ Sir , ’
211342	211379	211337	211337	he	472	‘ I know you now , sir ; be advised by me ; do not go on . I saw them pass , and know what kind of men they are . You will be murdered . ’
211380	211385	211387	211388	the horseman	3184	‘ So be it ! ’
211403	211409	211411	211412	the man	472	‘ But sir -- sir , ’
211422	211438	211439	211439	he	472	‘ if you do go on , wear the blue riband . Here , sir , ’
211449	211488	211439	211439	he	472	‘ it ’s necessity , not choice , that makes me wear it ; it ’s love of life and home , sir . Wear it for this one night , sir ; only for this one night . ’
211489	211492	211494	211496	the three friends	1333	‘ Do ! ’
211503	211517	211494	211496	the three friends	1333	‘ Mr Haredale -- worthy sir -- good gentleman -- pray be persuaded . ’
211518	211523	211525	211526	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Who ’s that ? ’
211533	211541	211525	211526	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Did I hear Daisy ’s voice ? ’
211542	211548	211550	211552	the little man	7269	‘ You did , sir , ’
211554	211574	211525	211526	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Do be persuaded , sir . This gentleman says very true . Your life may hang upon it . ’
211575	211579	211581	211582	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Are you , ’
211585	211592	211581	211582	Mr Haredale	206	‘ afraid to come with me ? ’
211593	211602	211494	211496	the three friends	1333	‘ I , sir?--N - n - no . ’
211603	211692	211581	211582	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Put that riband in your hat . If we meet the rioters , swear that I took you prisoner for wearing it . I will tell them so with my own lips ; for as I hope for mercy when I die , I will take no quarter from them , nor shall they have quarter from me , if we come hand to hand to - night . Up here -- behind me -- quick ! Clasp me tight round the body , and fear nothing . ’
211783	211789	211776	211776	he	206	‘ It is my house , ’
211944	211956	211969	211969	himself	206	‘ Down -- for one moment -- for but one moment , ’
211971	211985	211991	211991	he	206	‘ Willet -- Willet -- where are my niece and servants -- Willet ! ’
212091	212096	212098	212098	Solomon	205	‘ Johnny , Johnny , ’
212160	212267	212151	212151	Johnny	259	’ Pointing to Mr Haredale as he said these words , little Solomon Daisy put his elbows on the back of Mr Willet ’s chair , and fairly blubbered on his shoulder . While Solomon was speaking , old John sat , mute as a stock - fish , staring at him with an unearthly glare , and displaying , by every possible symptom , entire and complete unconsciousness . But when Solomon was silent again , John followed with his great round eyes the direction of his looks , and did appear to have some dawning distant notion that somebody had come to see him . ‘
212278	212290	212291	212291	Daisy	205	’ said the little clerk , rapping himself on the breast . ‘
212312	212330	212310	212310	Johnny	259	’ Mr Willet reflected for a few moments , and then muttered , as it were mechanically : ‘
212340	212341	212310	212310	Johnny	259	’ ‘
212348	212356	212310	212310	Johnny	259	’ cried the little man , hastily ; ‘
212368	212378	212382	212382	Johnny	259	’re all right now , an’t you ? Say you ’re
212384	212385	212382	212382	Johnny	259	’ ‘
212389	212407	212382	212382	Johnny	259	’ pondered Mr Willet , as if that were a matter entirely between himself and his conscience . ‘
212413	212414	212415	212415	They	4878	’ ‘
212438	212453	212434	212434	they	4878	’ asked Solomon , with a very anxious glance at Mr Willet ’s head . ‘
212463	212553	212461	212461	they	4878	’ John knitted his brow ; looked downwards , as if he were mentally engaged in some arithmetical calculation ; then upwards , as if the total would not come at his call ; then at Solomon Daisy , from his eyebrow to his shoe - buckle ; then very slowly round the bar . And then a great , round , leaden - looking , and not at all transparent tear , came rolling out of each eye , and he said , as he shook his head : ‘
212569	212573	212461	212461	they	4878	‘ em kindly . ’
212574	212588	212590	212592	his little friend	4879	‘ No , no , no , do n’t say that , Johnny , ’
212594	212614	212590	212592	his little friend	4879	‘ It ’s very , very bad , but not quite so bad as that . No , no ! ’
212615	212621	212623	212623	John	193	‘ Look’ee here , sir ! ’
212649	212709	212590	212592	his little friend	4879	‘ Look’ee here , sir ! The very Maypole -- the old dumb Maypole -- stares in at the winder , as if it said , “ John Willet , John Willet , let ’s go and pitch ourselves in the nighest pool of water as is deep enough to hold us ; for our day is over ! ” ’
212710	212719	212721	212722	his friend	7570	‘ Do n’t , Johnny , do n’t , ’
212751	212758	212744	212744	he	194	‘ Please do n’t , Johnny ! ’
212759	212772	212774	212775	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Your loss is great , and your misfortune a heavy one , ’
212783	212837	212774	212775	Mr Haredale	206	‘ and this is not a time to comfort you . If it were , I am in no condition to do so . Before I leave you , tell me one thing , and try to tell me plainly , I implore you . Have you seen , or heard of Emma ? ’
212838	212841	212843	212844	Mr Willet	194	‘ No ! ’
212846	212854	212843	212844	Mr Willet	194	‘ Nor any one but these bloodhounds ? ’
212855	212858	212774	212775	Mr Haredale	206	‘ No ! ’
212859	212875	212877	212878	Mr Haredale	206	‘ They rode away , I trust in Heaven , before these dreadful scenes began , ’
212911	212917	212877	212878	Mr Haredale	206	‘ A knife , Daisy ! ’
212918	212923	212925	212925	John	193	‘ You did n’t , ’
212959	212960	212961	212961	Willet	194	’ ‘
212963	212983	212961	212961	Willet	194	’ cried Mr Haredale . Solomon dropped the knife , and instantly becoming limp from head to foot , exclaimed ‘
212987	212988	212961	212961	Willet	194	’ ‘
212991	213001	213012	213012	his	4883	’ said John , not at all regarding them , ‘
213052	213402	213043	213043	he	4883	’ His landlord , who had listened to these words with breathless attention , started that moment to his feet ; and , without a word , drew Solomon Daisy to the door , mounted his horse , took him up behind again , and flew rather than galloped towards the pile of ruins , which that day ’s sun had shone upon , a stately house . Mr Willet stared after them , listened , looked down upon himself to make quite sure that he was still unbound , and , without any manifestation of impatience , disappointment , or surprise , gently relapsed into the condition from which he had so imperfectly recovered . Mr Haredale tied his horse to the trunk of a tree , and grasping his companion ’s arm , stole softly along the footpath , and into what had been the garden of his house . He stopped for an instant to look upon its smoking walls , and at the stars that shone through roof and floor upon the heap of crumbling ashes . Solomon glanced timidly in his face , but his lips were tightly pressed together , a resolute and stern expression sat upon his brow , and not a tear , a look , or gesture indicating grief , escaped him . He drew his sword ; felt for a moment in his breast , as though he carried other arms about him ; then grasping Solomon by the wrist again , went with a cautious step all round the house . He looked into every doorway and gap in the wall ; retraced his steps at every rustling of the air among the leaves ; and searched in every shadowed nook with outstretched hands . Thus they made the circuit of the building : but they returned to the spot from which they had set out , without encountering any human being , or finding the least trace of any concealed straggler . After a short pause , Mr Haredale shouted twice or thrice . Then cried aloud , ‘
213437	214117	213431	213431	I	0	’ He called them all by name ; his voice was echoed in many mournful tones ; then all was silent as before . They were standing near the foot of the turret , where the alarm - bell hung . The fire had raged there , and the floors had been sawn , and hewn , and beaten down , besides . It was open to the night ; but a part of the staircase still remained , winding upward from a great mound of dust and cinders . Fragments of the jagged and broken steps offered an insecure and giddy footing here and there , and then were lost again , behind protruding angles of the wall , or in the deep shadows cast upon it by other portions of the ruin ; for by this time the moon had risen , and shone brightly . As they stood here , listening to the echoes as they died away , and hoping in vain to hear a voice they knew , some of the ashes in this turret slipped and rolled down . Startled by the least noise in that melancholy place , Solomon looked up in his companion ’s face , and saw that he had turned towards the spot , and that he watched and listened keenly . He covered the little man ’s mouth with his hand , and looked again . Instantly , with kindling eyes , he bade him on his life keep still , and neither speak nor move . Then holding his breath , and stooping down , he stole into the turret , with his drawn sword in his hand , and disappeared . Terrified to be left there by himself , under such desolate circumstances , and after all he had seen and heard that night , Solomon would have followed , but there had been something in Mr Haredale ’s manner and his look , the recollection of which held him spellbound . He stood rooted to the spot ; and scarcely venturing to breathe , looked up with mingled fear and wonder . Again the ashes slipped and rolled -- very , very softly -- again -- and then again , as though they crumbled underneath the tread of a stealthy foot . And now a figure was dimly visible ; climbing very softly ; and often stopping to look down ; now it pursued its difficult way ; and now it was hidden from the view again . It emerged once more , into the shadowy and uncertain light -- higher now , but not much , for the way was steep and toilsome , and its progress very slow . What phantom of the brain did he pursue ; and why did he look down so constantly ? He knew he was alone . Surely his mind was not affected by that night ’s loss and agony . He was not about to throw himself headlong from the summit of the tottering wall . Solomon turned sick , and clasped his hands . His limbs trembled beneath him , and a cold sweat broke out upon his pallid face . If he complied with Mr Haredale ’s last injunction now , it was because he had not the power to speak or move . He strained his gaze , and fixed it on a patch of moonlight , into which , if he continued to ascend , he must soon emerge . When he appeared there , he would try to call to him . Again the ashes slipped and crumbled ; some stones rolled down , and fell with a dull , heavy sound upon the ground below . He kept his eyes upon the piece of moonlight . The figure was coming on , for its shadow was already thrown upon the wall . Now it appeared -- and now looked round at him -- and now-- The horror - stricken clerk uttered a scream that pierced the air , and cried , ‘
214124	214165	214166	214166	Villain	374	’ Long before the echo of his cry had died away , another form rushed out into the light , flung itself upon the foremost one , knelt down upon its breast , and clutched its throat with both hands . ‘
214168	214183	214166	214166	Villain	374	’ cried Mr Haredale , in a terrible voice -- for it was he . ‘
214277	214288	214289	214289	you	4887	’ he added , as the murderer writhed and struggled , ‘
214302	214657	214289	214289	you	4887	’ Chapter 57 Barnaby , armed as we have seen , continued to pace up and down before the stable - door ; glad to be alone again , and heartily rejoicing in the unaccustomed silence and tranquillity . After the whirl of noise and riot in which the last two days had been passed , the pleasures of solitude and peace were enhanced a thousandfold . He felt quite happy ; and as he leaned upon his staff and mused , a bright smile overspread his face , and none but cheerful visions floated into his brain . Had he no thoughts of her , whose sole delight he was , and whom he had unconsciously plunged in such bitter sorrow and such deep affliction ? Oh , yes . She was at the heart of all his cheerful hopes and proud reflections . It was she whom all this honour and distinction were to gladden ; the joy and profit were for her . What delight it gave her to hear of the bravery of her poor boy ! Ah ! He would have known that , without Hugh ’s telling him . And what a precious thing it was to know she lived so happily , and heard with so much pride ( he pictured to himself her look when they told her ) that he was in such high esteem : bold among the boldest , and trusted before them all ! And when these frays were over , and the good lord had conquered his enemies , and they were all at peace again , and he and she were rich , what happiness they would have in talking of these troubled times when he was a great soldier : and when they sat alone together in the tranquil twilight , and she had no longer reason to be anxious for the morrow , what pleasure would he have in the reflection that this was his doing -- his -- poor foolish Barnaby ’s ; and in patting her on the cheek , and saying with a merry laugh , ‘
214670	215016	215017	215017	I	0	’ With a lighter heart and step , and eyes the brighter for the happy tear that dimmed them for a moment , Barnaby resumed his walk ; and singing gaily to himself , kept guard upon his quiet post . His comrade Grip , the partner of his watch , though fond of basking in the sunshine , preferred to - day to walk about the stable ; having a great deal to do in the way of scattering the straw , hiding under it such small articles as had been casually left about , and haunting Hugh ’s bed , to which he seemed to have taken a particular attachment . Sometimes Barnaby looked in and called him , and then he came hopping out ; but he merely did this as a concession to his master ’s weakness , and soon returned again to his own grave pursuits : peering into the straw with his bill , and rapidly covering up the place , as if , Midas - like , he were whispering secrets to the earth and burying them ; constantly busying himself upon the sly ; and affecting , whenever Barnaby came past , to look up in the clouds and have nothing whatever on his mind : in short , conducting himself , in many respects , in a more than usually thoughtful , deep , and mysterious manner . As the day crept on , Barnaby , who had no directions forbidding him to eat and drink upon his post , but had been , on the contrary , supplied with a bottle of beer and a basket of provisions , determined to break his fast , which he had not done since morning . To this end , he sat down on the ground before the door , and putting his staff across his knees in case of alarm or surprise , summoned Grip to dinner . This call , the bird obeyed with great alacrity ; crying , as he sidled up to his master , ‘
215018	215023	215106	215108	Grip Grip Grip	4897	’m a devil , I ’m

215040	215064	215068	215068	Grip	237	’ Having learnt this latter sentiment from the gentry among whom he had lived of late , he delivered it with uncommon emphasis . ‘
215070	215084	215068	215068	Grip	237	’ cried his master , as he fed him with the daintiest bits . ‘

215423	215442	215421	215421	Barnaby	220	‘ The rest are away -- they went by that path -- that one . A grand party ! ’
215443	215446	215448	215449	Lord George	323	‘ Ay ? ’
215456	215460	215448	215449	Lord George	323	‘ And you ? ’
215461	215496	215421	215421	Barnaby	220	‘ Oh ! They left me here to watch -- to mount guard -- to keep everything secure till they come back . I ’ll do it , sir , for your sake . You ’re
215528	215529	215421	215421	Barnaby	220	’ ‘
215534	215569	215421	215421	Barnaby	220	’ said Lord George -- pointing to the raven who was peeping out of the stable - door -- but still looking thoughtfully , and in some perplexity , it seemed , at Barnaby . ‘
215577	215586	215600	215601	My bird	4916	’ retorted Barnaby , with a wondering laugh . ‘

215628	215633	215610	215611	A devil	979	’ cried the raven . ‘
215638	215658	215659	215659	you	323	’ added Barnaby , laying his hand upon the neck of Lord George ’s horse , and speaking softly : ‘
215713	215795	215711	215711	Grip	237	’ The raven answered by an affectionate croak , and hopping on his master ’s arm , which he held downward for that purpose , submitted with an air of perfect indifference to be fondled , and turned his restless , curious eye , now upon Lord George , and now upon his man . Lord George , biting his nails in a discomfited manner , regarded Barnaby for some time in silence ; then beckoning to his servant , said : ‘
215801	215811	215799	215799	John	193	’ John Grueby touched his hat , and came . ‘
215821	215830	215813	215813	you	193	’ his master asked in a low voice . ‘
215836	215840	215813	215813	you	193	’ said John . ‘

215871	215878	215862	215862	his	4236	’ Lord George demanded , faltering . ‘
215881	215889	215862	215862	his	4236	’ said John , with emphatic brevity . ‘
215900	215911	215893	215893	you	193	’ said his master , speaking in a peevish tone . ‘
215927	215928	215922	215922	you	193	’ ‘
215932	215937	215922	215922	you	193	’ John Grueby answered , ‘

215977	215987	215971	215972	one man	1808	’ returned his angry master , glancing at himself ; ‘

216038	216044	216022	216022	he	4236	’ returned the unmoved John . ‘
216053	216063	216046	216046	you	0	’ cried his master , turning sharply upon him . ‘
216075	216079	216065	216066	any man	1392	’ answered John . ‘

216133	216142	216124	216125	Mr Gashford	326	’ replied John , touching his hat respectfully , ‘

216163	216168	216144	216144	I	0	’ said Lord George : ‘

216373	216378	216362	216362	you	3194	’ returned John Grueby , ‘

216445	216464	216465	216465	He	711	’ cried Lord George , addressing Barnaby , who had looked on and wondered while this dialogue passed . ‘
216491	216492	216488	216488	you	0	’ ‘
216499	216506	216493	216493	I	0	’ said John , in explanation , ‘

216563	216574	216576	216576	Barnaby	220	‘ He ’s a coward , Grip , a coward ! ’
216590	216603	216576	216576	Barnaby	220	‘ Let them come ! Gordon for ever ! Let them come ! ’
216604	216607	216609	216610	Lord George	323	‘ Ay ! ’
216612	216662	216609	216610	Lord George	323	‘ let them ! Let us see who will venture to attack a power like ours ; the solemn league of a whole people . THIS a madman ! You have said well , very well . I am proud to be the leader of such men as you . ’
218937	219570	219594	219594	you	5066	’ quarters , and the little scanty trees in front ; the drummer - boys practising in a distant courtyard ; the men at drill on the parade ; the two soldiers carrying a basket between them , who winked to each other as he went by , and slily pointed to their throats ; the spruce serjeant who hurried past with a cane in his hand , and under his arm a clasped book with a vellum cover ; the fellows in the ground - floor rooms , furbishing and brushing up their different articles of dress , who stopped to look at him , and whose voices as they spoke together echoed loudly through the empty galleries and passages;--everything , down to the stand of muskets before the guard - house , and the drum with a pipe - clayed belt attached , in one corner , impressed itself upon his observation , as though he had noticed them in the same place a hundred times , or had been a whole day among them , in place of one brief hurried minute . He was taken into a small paved back yard , and there they opened a great door , plated with iron , and pierced some five feet above the ground with a few holes to let in air and light . Into this dungeon he was walked straightway ; and having locked him up there , and placed a sentry over him , they left him to his meditations . The cell , or black hole , for it had those words painted on the door , was very dark , and having recently accommodated a drunken deserter , by no means clean . Barnaby felt his way to some straw at the farther end , and looking towards the door , tried to accustom himself to the gloom , which , coming from the bright sunshine out of doors , was not an easy task . There was a kind of portico or colonnade outside , and this obstructed even the little light that at the best could have found its way through the small apertures in the door . The footsteps of the sentinel echoed monotonously as he paced its stone pavement to and fro ( reminding Barnaby of the watch he had so lately kept himself ) ; and as he passed and repassed the door , he made the cell for an instant so black by the interposition of his body , that his going away again seemed like the appearance of a new ray of light , and was quite a circumstance to look for . When the prisoner had sat sometime upon the ground , gazing at the chinks , and listening to the advancing and receding footsteps of his guard , the man stood still upon his post . Barnaby , quite unable to think , or to speculate on what would be done with him , had been lulled into a kind of doze by his regular pace ; but his stopping roused him ; and then he became aware that two men were in conversation under the colonnade , and very near the door of his cell . How long they had been talking there , he could not tell , for he had fallen into an unconsciousness of his real position , and when the footsteps ceased , was answering aloud some question which seemed to have been put to him by Hugh in the stable , though of the fancied purport , either of question or reply , notwithstanding that he awoke with the latter on his lips , he had no recollection whatever . The first words that reached his ears , were these : ‘
219589	219590	219594	219594	you	5066	’ ‘
219660	219661	219672	219672	you	5066	’ ‘
219667	219668	219672	219672	you	5066	’ ‘
219737	219738	219755	219755	they	5073	’ ‘
219741	219747	219755	219755	they	5073	’ said the other voice . ‘
219779	219805	219774	219775	the officer	4990	’ Not very well knowing , as it seemed , how to overcome this difficulty , the other man contented himself with damning the magistrates . ‘
219811	219816	219774	219775	the officer	4990	’ said his friend . ‘
219825	219831	219822	219823	a magistrate	10786	’ returned the other voice . ‘
219895	219896	219899	219899	he	5080	’ ‘
219906	219915	219902	219904	Sir John Fielding	379	’ asked the man who had spoken first . ‘
219923	219928	219929	219929	Mark	247	’ returned the other . ‘
219985	220299	219982	219983	the magistrates	11437	’ When he had in some degree relieved his mind by cursing the magistrates in various other forms of speech , the man was silent , save for a low growling , still having reference to those authorities , which from time to time escaped him . Barnaby , who had wit enough to know that this conversation concerned , and very nearly concerned , himself , remained perfectly quiet until they ceased to speak , when he groped his way to the door , and peeping through the air - holes , tried to make out what kind of men they were , to whom he had been listening . The one who condemned the civil power in such strong terms , was a serjeant -- engaged just then , as the streaming ribands in his cap announced , on the recruiting service . He stood leaning sideways against a pillar nearly opposite the door , and as he growled to himself , drew figures on the pavement with his cane . The other man had his back towards the dungeon , and Barnaby could only see his form . To judge from that , he was a gallant , manly , handsome fellow , but he had lost his left arm . It had been taken off between the elbow and the shoulder , and his empty coat - sleeve hung across his breast . It was probably this circumstance which gave him an interest beyond any that his companion could boast of , and attracted Barnaby ’s attention . There was something soldierly in his bearing , and he wore a jaunty cap and jacket . Perhaps he had been in the service at one time or other . If he had , it could not have been very long ago , for he was but a young fellow now . ‘
220304	220309	219982	219983	the magistrates	11437	’ he said thoughtfully ; ‘

220388	220394	220369	220369	em	10784	’ said the serjeant testily ; ‘

220530	220535	220536	220536	he	476	‘ It ’s mine , ’

220788	220854	220783	220783	Barnaby	220	‘ If I was on the other side of the door and there were none to part us , you ’d change your note -- ay , you may toss your head -- you would ! Kill the bird -- do . Kill anything you can , and so revenge yourself on those who with their bare hands untied could do as much to you ! ’
220874	220887	220860	220860	he	237	‘ Good bye , Grip -- good bye , dear old Grip ! ’
222245	222248	222250	222250	Simon	223	‘ Well ! ’
222257	222262	222250	222250	Simon	223	‘ is all right ? ’

222508	222518	222429	222429	he	237	’ cried Hugh , seating himself on the pathway . ‘
222547	222666	222667	222667	I	0	’ Entering into his boisterous humour , for they all had drunk deeply , and were as wild as he , they crowded about him , while two of their number who had torches , held them up , one on either side of him , that his banquet might not be despatched in the dark . Mr Dennis , having by this time succeeded in extricating from his hat a great mass of pasty , which had been wedged in so tightly that it was not easily got out , put it before him ; and Hugh , having borrowed a notched and jagged knife from one of the company , fell to work upon it vigorously . ‘
222687	222695	222685	222685	brother	9503	’ said Dennis , after a pause . ‘
222709	222747	222754	222754	you	5175	’ Hugh looked at him , and at the blackened faces by which he was surrounded , and , stopping for a moment to flourish his knife above his head , answered with a roar of laughter . ‘
222756	222761	222754	222754	you	5175	’ said Simon Tappertit . ‘
222776	222828	222850	222850	Simon	223	’ retorted his lieutenant , parting the men who stood between them , with his knife , that he might see him,--‘to regale himself a little bit after such work as mine ? What a hard captain ! What a strict captain ! What a tyrannical captain ! Ha ha ha ! ’
222829	222848	222850	222850	Simon	223	‘ I wish one of you fellers would hold a bottle to his mouth to keep him quiet , ’
222852	222864	222850	222850	Simon	223	‘ unless you want the military to be down upon us . ’
222865	222875	222877	222877	Hugh	198	‘ And what if they are down upon us ! ’
222879	222888	222889	222889	em	5179	‘ Who cares ? Who ’s afraid ? Let ‘

223043	223047	223048	223048	he	198	‘ Now then , ’
223051	223053	223048	223048	he	198	‘ I ’m

223088	223130	223074	223074	I	0	’ He thrust the little man aside as he spoke , and mounting on the steps , which were half let down , pulled down the blind by force , and stared into the chaise like an ogre into his larder . ‘
223149	223170	223171	223171	you	5184	’ he cried , as he grasped a little hand that sought in vain to free itself from his grip : ‘
223253	223254	223249	223251	my pretty one	5187	’ ‘
223257	223272	223249	223251	my pretty one	5187	’ said Mr Tappertit , who had waited during this speech with considerable impatience . ‘
223282	224302	224303	224303	I	0	’ The little hand seconded this admonition by thrusting Hugh ’s great head away with all its force , and drawing up the blind , amidst his noisy laughter , and vows that he must have another look , for the last glimpse of that sweet face had provoked him past all bearing . However , as the suppressed impatience of the party now broke out into open murmurs , he abandoned this design , and taking his seat upon the bar , contented himself with tapping at the front windows of the carriage , and trying to steal a glance inside ; Mr Tappertit , mounting the steps and hanging on by the door , issued his directions to the driver with a commanding voice and attitude ; the rest got up behind , or ran by the side of the carriage , as they could ; some , in imitation of Hugh , endeavoured to see the face he had praised so highly , and were reminded of their impertinence by hints from the cudgel of Mr Tappertit . Thus they pursued their journey by circuitous and winding roads ; preserving , except when they halted to take breath , or to quarrel about the best way of reaching London , pretty good order and tolerable silence . In the mean time , Dolly -- beautiful , bewitching , captivating little Dolly -- her hair dishevelled , her dress torn , her dark eyelashes wet with tears , her bosom heaving -- her face , now pale with fear , now crimsoned with indignation -- her whole self a hundred times more beautiful in this heightened aspect than ever she had been before -- vainly strove to comfort Emma Haredale , and to impart to her the consolation of which she stood in so much need herself . The soldiers were sure to come ; they must be rescued ; it would be impossible to convey them through the streets of London when they set the threats of their guards at defiance , and shrieked to the passengers for help . If they did this when they came into the more frequented ways , she was certain -- she was quite certain -- they must be released . So poor Dolly said , and so poor Dolly tried to think ; but the invariable conclusion of all such arguments was , that Dolly burst into tears ; cried , as she wrung her hands , what would they do or think , or who would comfort them , at home , at the Golden Key ; and sobbed most piteously . Miss Haredale , whose feelings were usually of a quieter kind than Dolly ’s , and not so much upon the surface , was dreadfully alarmed , and indeed had only just recovered from a swoon . She was very pale , and the hand which Dolly held was quite cold ; but she bade her , nevertheless , remember that , under Providence , much must depend upon their own discretion ; that if they remained quiet and lulled the vigilance of the ruffians into whose hands they had fallen , the chances of their being able to procure assistance when they reached the town , were very much increased ; that unless society were quite unhinged , a hot pursuit must be immediately commenced ; and that her uncle , she might be sure , would never rest until he had found them out and rescued them . But as she said these latter words , the idea that he had fallen in a general massacre of the Catholics that night -- no very wild or improbable supposition after what they had seen and undergone -- struck her dumb ; and , lost in the horrors they had witnessed , and those they might be yet reserved for , she sat incapable of thought , or speech , or outward show of grief : as rigid , and almost as white and cold , as marble . Oh , how many , many times , in that long ride , did Dolly think of her old lover,--poor , fond , slighted Joe ! How many , many times , did she recall that night when she ran into his arms from the very man now projecting his hateful gaze into the darkness where she sat , and leering through the glass in monstrous admiration ! And when she thought of Joe , and what a brave fellow he was , and how he would have rode boldly up , and dashed in among these villains now , yes , though they were double the number -- and here she clenched her little hand , and pressed her foot upon the ground -- the pride she felt for a moment in having won his heart , faded in a burst of tears , and she sobbed more bitterly than ever . As the night wore on , and they proceeded by ways which were quite unknown to them -- for they could recognise none of the objects of which they sometimes caught a hurried glimpse -- their fears increased ; nor were they without good foundation ; it was not difficult for two beautiful young women to find , in their being borne they knew not whither by a band of daring villains who eyed them as some among these fellows did , reasons for the worst alarm . When they at last entered London , by a suburb with which they were wholly unacquainted , it was past midnight , and the streets were dark and empty . Nor was this the worst , for the carriage stopping in a lonely spot , Hugh suddenly opened the door , jumped in , and took his seat between them . It was in vain they cried for help . He put his arm about the neck of each , and swore to stifle them with kisses if they were not as silent as the grave . ‘
224311	224315	224303	224303	I	0	’ he said , ‘
224349	224481	224341	224341	I	0	’ They were proceeding at a rapid pace , and apparently with fewer attendants than before , though it was so dark ( the torches being extinguished ) that this was mere conjecture . They shrunk from his touch , each into the farthest corner of the carriage ; but shrink as Dolly would , his arm encircled her waist , and held her fast . She neither cried nor spoke , for terror and disgust deprived her of the power ; but she plucked at his hand as though she would die in the effort to disengage herself ; and crouching on the ground , with her head averted and held down , repelled him with a strength she wondered at as much as he . The carriage stopped again . ‘
224487	224513	224341	224341	I	0	’ said Hugh to the man who opened the door , as he took Miss Haredale ’s hand , and felt how heavily it fell . ‘
224518	224519	224514	224514	She	5190	’ ‘
224525	224535	224536	224536	She	5190	’ growled Dennis -- it was that amiable gentleman . ‘
224543	224550	224540	224540	I	0	‘ em to faint , unless they ’re

224596	224601	224585	224585	I	0	’ said the hangman . ‘
224629	224649	224653	224654	pretty bird	5194	’ Having by this time hoisted the young lady into his arms , he staggered off with his burden . ‘
224656	224665	224651	224651	ye	5190	’ said Hugh , drawing Dolly towards him . ‘
224703	224975	224692	224693	Pretty mistress	5185	’ Thrusting his face away with all her force , and holding down her head , Dolly submitted to be carried out of the chaise , and borne after Miss Haredale into a miserable cottage , where Hugh , after hugging her to his breast , set her gently down upon the floor . Poor Dolly ! Do what she would , she only looked the better for it , and tempted them the more . When her eyes flashed angrily , and her ripe lips slightly parted , to give her rapid breathing vent , who could resist it ? When she wept and sobbed as though her heart would break , and bemoaned her miseries in the sweetest voice that ever fell upon a listener ’s ear , who could be insensible to the little winning pettishness which now and then displayed itself , even in the sincerity and earnestness of her grief ? When , forgetful for a moment of herself , as she was now , she fell on her knees beside her friend , and bent over her , and laid her cheek to hers , and put her arms about her , what mortal eyes could have avoided wandering to the delicate bodice , the streaming hair , the neglected dress , the perfect abandonment and unconsciousness of the blooming little beauty ? Who could look on and see her lavish caresses and endearments , and not desire to be in Emma Haredale ’s place ; to be either her or Dolly ; either the hugging or the hugged ? Not Hugh . Not Dennis . ‘
224986	224991	224976	224976	I	0	’ said Mr Dennis , ‘

225222	225226	225215	225215	I	0	’ retorted Dennis . ‘
225260	225294	225253	225253	We	5213	’ He shook his head waggishly , leered at Hugh again , and laughed very much , as if he had said a noble thing , and rather thought he was coming out . ‘
225318	225339	225310	225310	I	0	’ said Dennis , cocking his hat for the convenience of scratching his head , and looking gravely at Hugh , ‘
225407	225517	225519	225520	Mr Dennis	187	‘ em in a cellar , that he showed no consideration to women . Now , I say that there judge did n’t know his business , brother ; and that if I had been that there highwayman or housebreaker , I should have made answer : “ What are you a talking of , my lord ? I showed the women as much consideration as the law does , and what more would you have me do ? ” If you was to count up in the newspapers the number of females as have been worked off in this here city alone , in the last ten year , ’
225523	225595	225519	225520	Mr Dennis	187	‘ you ’d be surprised at the total -- quite amazed , you would . There ’s a dignified and equal thing ; a beautiful thing ! But we ’ve no security for its lasting . Now that they ’ve begun to favour these here Papists , I should n’t wonder if they went and altered even THAT , one of these days . Upon my soul , I should n’t . ’
225659	225670	225672	225672	Dolly	216	‘ I knew it , I was sure of it ! ’
225674	225700	225672	225672	Dolly	216	‘ My dear father ’s at the door . Thank God , thank God ! Bless you , Sim . Heaven bless you for this ! ’

225869	225880	225866	225867	Miss V.	381	’ said Simon , laying his hand upon his breast , ‘
225883	226028	226030	226030	he	5231	‘ prentice , not a workman , not a slave , not the wictim of your father ’s tyrannical behaviour , but the leader of a great people , the captain of a noble band , in which these gentlemen are , as I may say , corporals and serjeants .

Dolly V. , sweet Dolly V. , for how many years have I looked forward to this present meeting ! For how many years has it been my intention to exalt and ennoble you ! I redeem it . Behold in me , your husband . Yes , beautiful Dolly -- charmer -- enslaver -- S. Tappertit is all your own ! ’

226291	226302	226304	226304	Simon	223	‘ They shall remain here together till to - morrow , ’

226358	226421	226354	226354	captain	7793	’ Hugh rejoined ; and as he spoke , and clapped his hand upon the shoulder of the little man , he laughed again , for some unknown reason , with tenfold violence . Mr Tappertit surveyed him from head to foot with lofty scorn ( this only made him laugh the more ) , and turning to the prisoners , said : ‘
226531	226599	226600	226600	I	0	’ With this last caution , which was true enough , he turned to the door , followed by Hugh and Dennis . They paused for a moment , going out , to look at them clasped in each other ’s arms , and then left the cottage ; fastening the door , and setting a good watch upon it , and indeed all round the house . ‘
226603	226614	226600	226600	I	0	’ growled Dennis , as they walked away in company , ‘

226845	226853	226854	226854	Hugh	198	‘ SHE never said ; not she . ’
226892	226895	226897	226897	Sim	223	‘ Hugh ! ’
226899	226931	226897	226897	Sim	223	‘ You have done well to - day . You shall be rewarded . So have you , Dennis.--There ’s no young woman YOU want to carry off , is there ? ’

226971	227021	226969	226969	Sim	223	‘ then we ’ll find some other way of making it up to you . As to you , old boy’--he turned to Hugh--‘you shall have Miggs ( her that I promised you , you know ) within three days . Mind . I pass my word for it . ’
227457	227463	227465	227465	Hugh	198	‘ Stop ! and why ? ’
227963	228152	228153	228154	The soldiers	10782	’ stalls , and offal and garbage of a hundred kinds . It was indispensable to most public conveniences in those days , that they should be public nuisances likewise ; and Fleet Market maintained the principle to admiration . To this place , perhaps because its sheds and baskets were a tolerable substitute for beds , or perhaps because it afforded the means of a hasty barricade in case of need , many of the rioters had straggled , not only that night , but for two or three nights before . It was now broad day , but the morning being cold , a group of them were gathered round a fire in a public - house , drinking hot purl , and smoking pipes , and planning new schemes for to - morrow . Hugh and his two friends being known to most of these men , were received with signal marks of approbation , and inducted into the most honourable seats . The room - door was closed and fastened to keep intruders at a distance , and then they proceeded to exchange news . ‘
228165	228169	228162	228162	I	0	’ said Hugh . ‘
228176	228247	228162	228162	I	0	’ Several cried that they did ; but the majority of the company having been engaged in the assault upon the Warren , and all present having been concerned in one or other of the night ’s expeditions , it proved that they knew no more than Hugh himself ; having been merely warned by each other , or by the scout , and knowing nothing of their own knowledge . ‘
228259	228267	228250	228254	a man on guard there	5298	’ said Hugh , looking round him , ‘
228299	228349	228291	228292	any man	1392	’ They shook their heads , and murmured an answer in the negative , as each man looked round and appealed to his fellow ; when a noise was heard without , and a man was heard to say that he wanted Hugh -- that he must see Hugh . ‘
228356	228366	228350	228350	He	5298	’ cried Hugh to those who kept the door ; ‘
228372	228373	228368	228368	him	5298	’ ‘
228378	228383	228368	228368	him	5298	’ muttered the others . ‘
228394	228457	228390	228390	him	5298	’ The door was accordingly unlocked and opened . A one - armed man , with his head and face tied up with a bloody cloth , as though he had been severely beaten , his clothes torn , and his remaining hand grasping a thick stick , rushed in among them , and panting for breath , demanded which was Hugh . ‘
228462	228470	228459	228459	he	5298	’ replied the person he inquired for . ‘

228639	228668	228669	228669	I	0	’ He pointed to his dress and to his bandaged head , and still panting for breath , glanced round the room ; then faced towards Hugh again . ‘
228675	228679	228669	228669	I	0	’ he said , ‘
228705	228743	228745	228745	he	0	’re a bold fellow , I know . So is he . He fought like a lion tonight , but it was of no use . I did my best , considering that I want this limb . ’
228888	228896	228880	228881	One man	1808	‘ Who ’ll follow me to Newgate ! ’
228994	229000	229002	229002	Hugh	198	‘ Not that jail alone , ’
229004	229038	229039	229039	he	198	‘ but every jail in London . They shall have no place to put their prisoners in . We ’ll burn them all down ; make bonfires of them every one ! Here ! ’
229049	229053	229039	229039	he	198	‘ Let all who ’re
229081	229785	229039	229039	he	198	’ Every man there . And they swore a great oath to release their friends from Newgate next night ; to force the doors and burn the jail ; or perish in the fire themselves . Chapter 61 On that same night -- events so crowd upon each other in convulsed and distracted times , that more than the stirring incidents of a whole life often become compressed into the compass of four - and - twenty hours -- on that same night , Mr Haredale , having strongly bound his prisoner , with the assistance of the sexton , and forced him to mount his horse , conducted him to Chigwell ; bent upon procuring a conveyance to London from that place , and carrying him at once before a justice . The disturbed state of the town would be , he knew , a sufficient reason for demanding the murderer ’s committal to prison before daybreak , as no man could answer for the security of any of the watch - houses or ordinary places of detention ; and to convey a prisoner through the streets when the mob were again abroad , would not only be a task of great danger and hazard , but would be to challenge an attempt at rescue . Directing the sexton to lead the horse , he walked close by the murderer ’s side , and in this order they reached the village about the middle of the night . The people were all awake and up , for they were fearful of being burnt in their beds , and sought to comfort and assure each other by watching in company . A few of the stoutest - hearted were armed and gathered in a body on the green . To these , who knew him well , Mr Haredale addressed himself , briefly narrating what had happened , and beseeching them to aid in conveying the criminal to London before the dawn of day . But not a man among them dared to help him by so much as the motion of a finger . The rioters , in their passage through the village , had menaced with their fiercest vengeance , any person who should aid in extinguishing the fire , or render the least assistance to him , or any Catholic whomsoever . Their threats extended to their lives and all they possessed . They were assembled for their own protection , and could not endanger themselves by lending any aid to him . This they told him , not without hesitation and regret , as they kept aloof in the moonlight and glanced fearfully at the ghostly rider , who , with his head drooping on his breast and his hat slouched down upon his brow , neither moved nor spoke . Finding it impossible to persuade them , and indeed hardly knowing how to do so after what they had seen of the fury of the crowd , Mr Haredale besought them that at least they would leave him free to act for himself , and would suffer him to take the only chaise and pair of horses that the place afforded . This was not acceded to without some difficulty , but in the end they told him to do what he would , and go away from them in heaven ’s name . Leaving the sexton at the horse ’s bridle , he drew out the chaise with his own hands , and would have harnessed the horses , but that the post - boy of the village -- a soft - hearted , good - for - nothing , vagabond kind of fellow -- was moved by his earnestness and passion , and , throwing down a pitchfork with which he was armed , swore that the rioters might cut him into mincemeat if they liked , but he would not stand by and see an honest gentleman who had done no wrong , reduced to such extremity , without doing what he could to help him . Mr Haredale shook him warmly by the hand , and thanked him from his heart . In five minutes ’

The gentleman never can be confounded with him , if you will have the goodness to say a few words , on oath , as to when he died , and how ; and that this person ( who I am told resembles him in some degree ) is no more he than I am .

235682	235717	235677	235677	they	5525	’ As he said these words , the lock was turned , and one of the prison turnkeys appearing at the door , announced that it was time for visitors to leave the jail . ‘
235721	235727	235677	235677	they	5525	’ said Stagg , meekly . ‘
235810	236386	235804	235804	I	0	’ So saying , and pausing for an instant at the door to turn his grinning face towards his friend , he departed . When the officer had seen him to the porch , he returned , and again unlocking and unbarring the door of the cell , set it wide open , informing its inmate that he was at liberty to walk in the adjacent yard , if he thought proper , for an hour . The prisoner answered with a sullen nod ; and being left alone again , sat brooding over what he had heard , and pondering upon the hopes the recent conversation had awakened ; gazing abstractedly , the while he did so , on the light without , and watching the shadows thrown by one wall on another , and on the stone - paved ground . It was a dull , square yard , made cold and gloomy by high walls , and seeming to chill the very sunlight . The stone , so bare , and rough , and obdurate , filled even him with longing thoughts of meadow - land and trees ; and with a burning wish to be at liberty . As he looked , he rose , and leaning against the door - post , gazed up at the bright blue sky , smiling even on that dreary home of crime . He seemed , for a moment , to remember lying on his back in some sweet - scented place , and gazing at it through moving branches , long ago . His attention was suddenly attracted by a clanking sound -- he knew what it was , for he had startled himself by making the same noise in walking to the door . Presently a voice began to sing , and he saw the shadow of a figure on the pavement . It stopped -- was silent all at once , as though the person for a moment had forgotten where he was , but soon remembered -- and so , with the same clanking noise , the shadow disappeared . He walked out into the court and paced it to and fro ; startling the echoes , as he went , with the harsh jangling of his fetters . There was a door near his , which , like his , stood ajar . He had not taken half - a - dozen turns up and down the yard , when , standing still to observe this door , he heard the clanking sound again . A face looked out of the grated window -- he saw it very dimly , for the cell was dark and the bars were heavy -- and directly afterwards , a man appeared , and came towards him . For the sense of loneliness he had , he might have been in jail a year . Made eager by the hope of companionship , he quickened his pace , and hastened to meet the man half way-- What was this ! His son ! They stood face to face , staring at each other . He shrinking and cowed , despite himself ; Barnaby struggling with his imperfect memory , and wondering where he had seen that face before . He was not uncertain long , for suddenly he laid hands upon him , and striving to bear him to the ground , cried : ‘
236397	236441	236392	236392	You	0	’ He said nothing in reply at first , but held down his head , and struggled with him silently . Finding the younger man too strong for him , he raised his face , looked close into his eyes , and said , ‘
236447	236665	236392	236392	You	0	’ God knows what magic the name had for his ears ; but Barnaby released his hold , fell back , and looked at him aghast . Suddenly he sprung towards him , put his arms about his neck , and pressed his head against his cheek . Yes , yes , he was ; he was sure he was . But where had he been so long , and why had he left his mother by herself , or worse than by herself , with her poor foolish boy ? And had she really been as happy as they said ? And where was she ? Was she near there ? She was not happy now , and he in jail ? Ah , no . Not a word was said in answer ; but Grip croaked loudly , and hopped about them , round and round , as if enclosing them in a magic circle , and invoking all the powers of mischief . Chapter 63 During the whole of this day , every regiment in or near the metropolis was on duty in one or other part of the town ; and the regulars and militia , in obedience to the orders which were sent to every barrack and station within twenty - four hours ’

When all was ready , Hugh and Dennis , with Simon Tappertit between them , led the way . Roaring and chafing like an angry sea , the crowd pressed after them . Instead of going straight down Holborn to the jail , as all expected , their leaders took the way to Clerkenwell , and pouring down a quiet street , halted before a locksmith ’s house -- the Golden Key . ‘
237826	237835	237642	237642	God	217	’ cried Hugh to the men about him . ‘
237855	237887	237851	237852	no one	7986	’ The shop was shut . Both door and shutters were of a strong and sturdy kind , and they knocked without effect . But the impatient crowd raising a cry of ‘
237894	237919	237851	237852	no one	7986	’ and torches being passed to the front , an upper window was thrown open , and the stout old locksmith stood before them . ‘
237926	237930	237923	237923	you	5608	’ he demanded . ‘
237936	237937	237923	237923	you	5608	’ ‘
237947	237958	237944	237945	old man	5611	’ retorted Hugh , waving his comrades to be silent , ‘

237980	237993	237978	237978	me	0	’ cried the locksmith , glancing at the regimental dress he wore : ‘

238078	238082	238074	238074	you	0	’ cried Hugh . ‘

238117	238139	238098	238098	I	0	’ cried the locksmith , in a voice that made them falter -- presenting , as he spoke , a gun . ‘
238153	238221	238147	238147	You	5608	’ The young fellow who held the light , and who was stooping down before the door , rose hastily at these words , and fell back . The locksmith ran his eye along the upturned faces , and kept the weapon levelled at the threshold of his house . It had no other rest than his shoulder , but was as steady as the house itself . ‘
238235	238240	238241	238241	I	0	’ he said firmly ; ‘
238245	238305	238241	238241	I	0	’ Snatching a torch from one who stood near him , Hugh was stepping forward with an oath , when he was arrested by a shrill and piercing shriek , and , looking upward , saw a fluttering garment on the house - top . There was another shriek , and another , and then a shrill voice cried , ‘
238310	238343	238307	238307	Simmun	254	’ At the same moment a lean neck was stretched over the parapet , and Miss Miggs , indistinctly seen in the gathering gloom of evening , screeched in a frenzied manner , ‘
238370	238416	238368	238368	me	0	’ Mr Tappertit , who was not at all flattered by this compliment , looked up , and bidding her hold her peace , ordered her to come down and open the door , for they wanted her master , and would take no denial . ‘

238536	238540	238541	238541	Simmun	254	’ screamed Miggs . ‘
238546	238694	238696	238696	Miggs	239	’m locked up in the front attic , through the little door on the right hand when you think you ’ve got to the very top of the stairs -- and up the flight of corner steps , being careful not to knock your heads against the rafters , and not to tread on one side in case you should fall into the two - pair bedroom through the lath and plasture , which do not bear , but the contrairy . Simmun and gentlemen , I ’ve been locked up here for safety , but my endeavours has always been , and always will be , to be on the right side -- the blessed side and to prenounce the Pope of Babylon , and all her inward and her outward workings , which is Pagin . My sentiments is of little consequences , I know , ’
238702	238738	238696	238696	Miggs	239	‘ for my positions is but a servant , and as sich , of humilities , still I gives expressions to my feelings , and places my reliances on them which entertains my own opinions ! ’
238909	238918	238920	238921	the locksmith	7447	‘ You have robbed me of my daughter , ’
238923	238981	238920	238921	the locksmith	7447	‘ who is far dearer to me than my life ; and you may take my life , if you will . I bless God that I have been enabled to keep my wife free of this scene ; and that He has made me a man who will not ask mercy at such hands as yours . ’
238982	238992	238994	238995	Mr Dennis	187	‘ And a wery game old gentleman you are , ’
238999	239038	238994	238995	Mr Dennis	187	‘ and you express yourself like a man . What ’s the odds , brother , whether it ’s a lamp - post to - night , or a feather - bed ten year to come , eh ? ’
239052	239057	239059	239068	the hangman , who particularly favoured the lamp - post	5634	‘ For my part , ’

239139	239148	239150	239150	Hugh	198	‘ Do n’t be a fool , master , ’
239159	239164	239150	239150	Hugh	198	‘ but do as you ’re

239181	239197	239199	239200	the locksmith	7447	‘ I ’ll do nothing at your request , or that of any scoundrel here , ’
239202	239237	239199	239200	the locksmith	7447	‘ If you want any service from me , you may spare yourselves the pains of telling me what it is . I tell you , beforehand , I ’ll do nothing for you . ’
239646	239664	239639	239643	some one at the window	5647	‘ He has a grey head . He is an old man : Do n’t hurt him ! ’

239727	239755	239714	239714	he	7447	‘ I do n’t ask it . My heart is green enough to scorn and despise every man among you , band of robbers that you are ! ’
239811	239820	239821	239821	he	7447	‘ So , tell him what we want , ’
239827	239849	239821	239821	he	7447	‘ and quickly . And open your ears , master , if you would ever use them after to - night . ’

239875	239879	239873	239873	Varden	212	’ said Sim , ‘

239922	239946	239920	239920	Simon	223	‘ and force the gates , and set the prisoners at liberty . You helped to make the lock of the great door . ’
239947	239951	239953	239954	the locksmith	7447	‘ I did , ’
239956	239972	239953	239954	the locksmith	7447	‘ You owe me no thanks for that -- as you ’ll find before long . ’
239973	239976	239895	239896	the locksmith	7447	‘ Maybe , ’
239981	239992	239895	239896	the locksmith	7447	‘ but you must show us how to force it . ’
239993	239997	239953	239954	the locksmith	7447	‘ Must I ! ’
239998	240025	239895	239896	the locksmith	7447	‘ Yes ; for you know , and I do n’t . You must come along with us , and pick it with your own hands . ’
240026	240031	240033	240034	the locksmith	7447	‘ When I do , ’
240037	240062	240033	240034	the locksmith	7447	‘ my hands shall drop off at the wrists , and you shall wear them , Simon Tappertit , on your shoulders for epaulettes . ’

240085	240139	240079	240080	the crowd	7574	‘ You fill a basket with the tools he ’ll want , while I bring him downstairs . Open the doors below , some of you . And light the great captain , others ! Is there no business afoot , my lads , that you can do nothing but stand and grumble ? ’
240452	240462	240447	240448	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ My Simmuns ’s life is not a wictim ! ’
240485	240489	240491	240492	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Oh bother ! ’
240494	240518	240491	240492	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ Here . Catch hold of her , somebody . Lock her up again ; she never ought to have been let out . ’

240562	240584	240553	240554	Mr Tappertit	223	‘ I ’ll let you fall if you do n’t . What are you sliding your feet off the ground for ? ’

240607	240613	240553	240554	Mr Tappertit	223	’ answered Simon , testily . ‘
240628	240629	240623	240623	I	0	’ ‘
240649	240653	240623	240623	I	0	’ cried Miggs . ‘

240680	240685	240670	240670	you	0	’ cried Mr Tappertit , ‘
240699	240717	240723	240723	you	0	’ he cried to one of the bystanders , in whose ear he whispered for a moment : ‘
240729	241040	240725	240725	You	0	’ The fellow nodded ; and taking her in his arms , notwithstanding her broken protestations , and her struggles ( which latter species of opposition , involving scratches , was much more difficult of resistance ) , carried her away . They who were in the house poured out into the street ; the locksmith was taken to the head of the crowd , and required to walk between his two conductors ; the whole body was put in rapid motion ; and without any shouts or noise they bore down straight on Newgate , and halted in a dense mass before the prison - gate . Chapter 64 Breaking the silence they had hitherto preserved , they raised a great cry as soon as they were ranged before the jail , and demanded to speak to the governor . This visit was not wholly unexpected , for his house , which fronted the street , was strongly barricaded , the wicket - gate of the prison was closed up , and at no loophole or grating was any person to be seen . Before they had repeated their summons many times , a man appeared upon the roof of the governor ’s house , and asked what it was they wanted . Some said one thing , some another , and some only groaned and hissed . It being now nearly dark , and the house high , many persons in the throng were not aware that any one had come to answer them , and continued their clamour until the intelligence was gradually diffused through the whole concourse . Ten minutes or more elapsed before any one voice could be heard with tolerable distinctness ; during which interval the figure remained perched alone , against the summer - evening sky , looking down into the troubled street . ‘
241044	241050	241042	241042	you	5678	’ said Hugh at length , ‘
241059	241060	241063	241063	he	395	’ ‘
241068	241087	241066	241066	brother	9503	’ whispered Dennis . But Hugh , without minding him , took his answer from the man himself . ‘
241090	241094	241095	241095	I	0	’ he said . ‘

241125	241179	241111	241111	master	7428	’ He glanced downward , as he spoke , into the jail : and the feeling that he could see into the different yards , and that he overlooked everything which was hidden from their view by the rugged walls , so lashed and goaded the mob , that they howled like wolves . ‘
241185	241189	241111	241111	master	7428	’ said Hugh , ‘

241246	241255	241256	241256	Akerman	395	‘ All I can do , good people , ’
241259	241300	241301	241301	He	395	‘ is to exhort you to disperse ; and to remind you that the consequences of any disturbance in this place , will be very severe , and bitterly repented by most of you , when it is too late . ’
241325	241329	241331	241331	Gabriel	212	‘ Mr Akerman , ’
241333	241337	241331	241331	Gabriel	212	‘ Mr Akerman . ’
241338	241349	241351	241352	the governor	11836	‘ I will hear no more from any of you , ’

241377	241401	241375	241375	Gabriel	212	‘ I am an honest man , Mr Akerman ; a respectable tradesman -- Gabriel Varden , the locksmith . You know me ? ’
241402	241408	241410	241411	the governor	11836	‘ You among the crowd ! ’
241417	241436	241438	241439	the locksmith	7447	‘ Brought here by force -- brought here to pick the lock of the great door for them , ’
241441	241485	241438	241439	the locksmith	7447	‘ Bear witness for me , Mr Akerman , that I refuse to do it ; and that I will not do it , come what may of my refusal . If any violence is done to me , please to remember this . ’
241486	241495	241497	241498	the governor	11836	‘ Is there no way of helping you ? ’
241500	241528	241530	241531	the locksmith	7447	‘ None , Mr Akerman . You ’ll do your duty , and I ’ll do mine . Once again , you robbers and cut - throats , ’
241538	241547	241530	241531	the locksmith	7447	‘ I refuse . Ah ! Howl till you ’re

241559	241566	241567	241568	Mr Varden	214	’ said the jailer , hastily . ‘
241589	241590	241594	241594	sir	7320	’ ‘
241596	241652	241656	241656	sir	7320	’ interposed the locksmith , who felt that the tone in which this was said , conveyed the speaker ’s impression that he had ample excuse for yielding to the furious multitude who beset and hemmed him in , on every side , and among whom he stood , an old man , quite alone ; ‘
241663	241664	241658	241658	I	0	’ ‘
241670	241677	241667	241668	that man	591	’ said the keeper , anxiously , ‘

241727	241731	241721	241721	We	5701	’ he answered , ‘
241762	241773	241760	241760	lads	5705	’ The mob replied to him with a loud Hurrah ! ‘
241782	241786	241774	241774	You	7428	’ cried Varden . ‘
241788	241807	241810	241812	no more parley	5707	‘ em out , in King George ’s name . Remember what I have said . Good night ! ’
241901	241904	241906	241908	the sturdy locksmith	668	‘ No , ’
241910	241915	241906	241908	the sturdy locksmith	668	‘ I will not ! ’
242030	242035	242005	242005	He	212	‘ I will not ! ’
242077	242082	242083	242083	he	212	‘ You cowardly dog ! ’
242086	242097	242083	242083	he	212	‘ Give me my daughter . Give me my daughter . ’
242104	242108	242102	242102	Some	1792	‘ Kill him , ’
242148	242162	242163	242163	he	212	‘ Is this all the return you make me , you ungrateful monster ? ’
242174	242180	242182	242183	the locksmith	7447	‘ Give me my daughter ! ’
242197	242203	242182	242183	the locksmith	7447	‘ Give me my daughter ! ’

242361	242403	242341	242341	they	8313	‘ Leave him to us . Why do you waste your whole strength on such as he , when a couple of men can finish him in as many minutes ! You lose time . Remember the prisoners ! remember Barnaby ! ’
246915	246919	246911	246911	he	187	‘ Dennis , you ’re
246925	246931	246932	246933	capital company	5956	’re a queer fellow ; you ’re
246942	247248	246911	246911	he	187	’ He sat in this way for some minutes , while the four men in the cells , who were certain that somebody had entered the gallery , but could not see who , gave vent to such piteous entreaties as wretches in their miserable condition may be supposed to have been inspired with : urging , whoever it was , to set them at liberty , for the love of Heaven ; and protesting , with great fervour , and truly enough , perhaps , for the time , that if they escaped , they would amend their ways , and would never , never , never again do wrong before God or man , but would lead penitent and sober lives , and sorrowfully repent the crimes they had committed . The terrible energy with which they spoke , would have moved any person , no matter how good or just ( if any good or just person could have strayed into that sad place that night ) , to have set them at liberty : and , while he would have left any other punishment to its free course , to have saved them from this last dreadful and repulsive penalty ; which never turned a man inclined to evil , and has hardened thousands who were half inclined to good . Mr Dennis , who had been bred and nurtured in the good old school , and had administered the good old laws on the good old plan , always once and sometimes twice every six weeks , for a long time , bore these appeals with a deal of philosophy . Being at last , however , rather disturbed in his pleasant reflection by their repetition , he rapped at one of the doors with his stick , and cried : ‘
247257	247283	246911	246911	he	187	’ At this they all cried together that they were to be hanged on the next day but one ; and again implored his aid . ‘
247289	247304	246911	246911	he	187	’ said Mr Dennis , playfully rapping the knuckles of the hand nearest him . ‘
247309	247313	246911	246911	he	187	’ they cried . ‘
247318	247341	246911	246911	he	187	’ said Mr Dennis , winking at the wall in the absence of any friend with whom he could humour the joke . ‘
247345	247356	247344	247344	you	5957	’re to be worked off , are you , brothers ? ’
247357	247366	247367	247369	one of them	9301	‘ Unless we are released to - night , ’
247372	247378	247367	247369	one of them	9301	‘ we are dead men ! ’
247379	247387	247389	247390	the hangman	3437	‘ I tell you what it is , ’
247394	247396	247389	247390	the hangman	3437	‘ I ’m
247404	247408	247367	247369	one of them	9301	’re not in that ‘
247423	247442	247422	247422	you	1009	’re not a - going to be released : do n’t think it -- Will you leave off that ‘
247458	247489	247455	247455	I	0	’ He followed up this reproof by rapping every set of knuckles one after the other , and having done so , resumed his seat again with a cheerful countenance . ‘
247495	247507	247455	247455	I	0	’ he said , crossing his legs and elevating his eyebrows : ‘
247513	247526	247455	247455	I	0	’ purpose for you ; a wery handsome prison ’s been made a ’
247546	247555	247531	247532	a parson	5962	’ purpose for you ; carts is maintained a ’
247563	247577	247562	247562	you	1009	’re not contented!--WILL you hold that noise , you sir in the furthest ? ’
247585	247594	247596	247597	Mr Dennis	187	‘ So well as I can make out , ’
247608	247622	247596	247597	Mr Dennis	187	‘ there ’s not a man among you . I begin to think I ’m
247674	247687	247688	247688	I	0	’ said the hangman , rapping at the door with his stick , ‘
247697	247703	247696	247696	I	0	’m ashamed of you . You ’re
247710	247736	247696	247696	I	0	’ After pausing for a moment to hear if anything could be pleaded in justification , Mr Dennis resumed in a sort of coaxing tone : ‘
247745	247836	247838	247839	the hangman	3437	’m come here to take care of you , and see that you an’t burnt , instead of the other thing . It ’s no use your making any noise , for you wo n’t be found out by them as has broken in , and you ’ll only be hoarse when you come to the speeches,--which is a pity . What I say in respect to the speeches always is , “ Give it mouth . ” That ’s my maxim . Give it mouth . I ’ve heerd , ’
247872	248013	247838	247839	the hangman	3437	‘ I ’ve heerd a eloquence on them boards -- you know what boards I mean -- and have heerd a degree of mouth given to them speeches , that they was as clear as a bell , and as good as a play . There ’s a pattern ! And always , when a thing of this natur ’s to come off , what I stand up for , is , a proper frame of mind . Let ’s have a proper frame of mind , and we can go through with it , creditable -- pleasant -- sociable . Whatever you do ( and I address myself in particular , to you in the furthest ) , never snivel . I ’d sooner by half , though I lose by it , see a man tear his clothes a ’
248017	248044	248046	248047	the hangman	3437	‘ em before they come to me , than find him snivelling . It ’s ten to one a better frame of mind , every way ! ’
248348	248351	248353	248353	Hugh	198	‘ Halloa ! ’
248366	248396	248353	248353	Hugh	198	‘ Dennis before us ! Well done , old boy . Be quick , and open here , for we shall be suffocated in the smoke , going out . ’
248397	248405	248407	248407	Dennis	187	‘ Go out at once , then , ’
248409	248416	248407	248407	Dennis	187	‘ What do you want here ? ’
248417	248420	248422	248422	Hugh	198	‘ Want ! ’
248424	248429	248422	248422	Hugh	198	‘ The four men . ’
248430	248434	248436	248437	the hangman	3437	‘ Four devils ! ’
248439	248445	248436	248437	the hangman	3437	‘ Do n’t you know they ’re
248470	248471	248516	248517	the hangman	3437	’ ‘
248479	248483	248525	248525	he	3437	’ cried Hugh . ‘
248487	248510	248525	248525	he	3437	‘ em ? Pull away these bars that have got fixed between the door and the ground ; and let us in . ’
248511	248514	248516	248517	the hangman	3437	‘ Brother , ’
248543	248593	248525	248525	he	3437	‘ ca n’t you leave these here four men to me , if I ’ve the whim ! You do what you like , and have what you like of everything for your share,--give me my share . I want these four men left alone , I tell you ! ’
248594	248607	248609	248609	Hugh	198	‘ Pull the bars down , or stand out of the way , ’
248613	248631	248633	248634	the hangman	3437	‘ You can turn the crowd if you like , you know that well enough , brother , ’
248638	248649	248633	248634	the hangman	3437	‘ What ! You WILL come in , will you ? ’
248650	248653	248633	248634	the hangman	3437	‘ Yes . ’
248654	248665	248633	248634	the hangman	3437	‘ You wo n’t let these men alone , and leave ‘
248680	248703	248678	248678	you	0	’ said the hangman , retreating to the door by which he had entered , and regarding his companion with a scowl . ‘
248714	248715	248716	248716	I	0	’ ‘
248733	248734	248730	248730	you	0	’ ‘
248739	248742	248744	248745	the hangman	3437	’m going , ’
248767	248771	248756	248756	he	0	‘ Remember where you ’re
248778	249219	248756	248756	he	0	’ With that , he shook his likeness at Hugh , and giving him a grin , compared with which his usual smile was amiable , disappeared , and shut the door . Hugh paused no longer , but goaded alike by the cries of the convicts , and by the impatience of the crowd , warned the man immediately behind him -- the way was only wide enough for one abreast -- to stand back , and wielded a sledge - hammer with such strength , that after a few blows the iron bent and broke , and gave them free admittance . If the two sons of one of these men , of whom mention has been made , were furious in their zeal before , they had now the wrath and vigour of lions . Calling to the man within each cell , to keep as far back as he could , lest the axes crashing through the door should wound him , a party went to work upon each one , to beat it in by sheer strength , and force the bolts and staples from their hold . But although these two lads had the weakest party , and the worst armed , and did not begin until after the others , having stopped to whisper to him through the grate , that door was the first open , and that man was the first out . As they dragged him into the gallery to knock off his irons , he fell down among them , a mere heap of chains , and was carried out in that state on men ’s shoulders , with no sign of life . The release of these four wretched creatures , and conveying them , astounded and bewildered , into the streets so full of life -- a spectacle they had never thought to see again , until they emerged from solitude and silence upon that last journey , when the air should be heavy with the pent - up breath of thousands , and the streets and houses should be built and roofed with human faces , not with bricks and tiles and stones -- was the crowning horror of the scene . Their pale and haggard looks and hollow eyes ; their staggering feet , and hands stretched out as if to save themselves from falling ; their wandering and uncertain air ; the way they heaved and gasped for breath , as though in water , when they were first plunged into the crowd ; all marked them for the men . No need to say ‘
249227	250416	248756	248756	he	0	’ for there were the words broadly stamped and branded on his face . The crowd fell off , as if they had been laid out for burial , and had risen in their shrouds ; and many were seen to shudder , as though they had been actually dead men , when they chanced to touch or brush against their garments . At the bidding of the mob , the houses were all illuminated that night -- lighted up from top to bottom as at a time of public gaiety and joy . Many years afterwards , old people who lived in their youth near this part of the city , remembered being in a great glare of light , within doors and without , and as they looked , timid and frightened children , from the windows , seeing a FACE go by . Though the whole great crowd and all its other terrors had faded from their recollection , this one object remained ; alone , distinct , and well remembered . Even in the unpractised minds of infants , one of these doomed men darting past , and but an instant seen , was an image of force enough to dim the whole concourse ; to find itself an all - absorbing place , and hold it ever after . When this last task had been achieved , the shouts and cries grew fainter ; the clank of fetters , which had resounded on all sides as the prisoners escaped , was heard no more ; all the noises of the crowd subsided into a hoarse and sullen murmur as it passed into the distance ; and when the human tide had rolled away , a melancholy heap of smoking ruins marked the spot where it had lately chafed and roared . Chapter 66 Although he had had no rest upon the previous night , and had watched with little intermission for some weeks past , sleeping only in the day by starts and snatches , Mr Haredale , from the dawn of morning until sunset , sought his niece in every place where he deemed it possible she could have taken refuge . All day long , nothing , save a draught of water , passed his lips ; though he prosecuted his inquiries far and wide , and never so much as sat down , once . In every quarter he could think of ; at Chigwell and in London ; at the houses of the tradespeople with whom he dealt , and of the friends he knew ; he pursued his search . A prey to the most harrowing anxieties and apprehensions , he went from magistrate to magistrate , and finally to the Secretary of State . The only comfort he received was from this minister , who assured him that the Government , being now driven to the exercise of the extreme prerogatives of the Crown , were determined to exert them ; that a proclamation would probably be out upon the morrow , giving to the military , discretionary and unlimited power in the suppression of the riots ; that the sympathies of the King , the Administration , and both Houses of Parliament , and indeed of all good men of every religious persuasion , were strongly with the injured Catholics ; and that justice should be done them at any cost or hazard . He told him , moreover , that other persons whose houses had been burnt , had for a time lost sight of their children or their relatives , but had , in every case , within his knowledge , succeeded in discovering them ; that his complaint should be remembered , and fully stated in the instructions given to the officers in command , and to all the inferior myrmidons of justice ; and that everything that could be done to help him , should be done , with a goodwill and in good faith . Grateful for this consolation , feeble as it was in its reference to the past , and little hope as it afforded him in connection with the subject of distress which lay nearest to his heart ; and really thankful for the interest the minister expressed , and seemed to feel , in his condition ; Mr Haredale withdrew . He found himself , with the night coming on , alone in the streets ; and destitute of any place in which to lay his head . He entered an hotel near Charing Cross , and ordered some refreshment and a bed . He saw that his faint and worn appearance attracted the attention of the landlord and his waiters ; and thinking that they might suppose him to be penniless , took out his purse , and laid it on the table . It was not that , the landlord said , in a faltering voice . If he were one of those who had suffered by the rioters , he durst not give him entertainment . He had a family of children , and had been twice warned to be careful in receiving guests . He heartily prayed his forgiveness , but what could he do ? Nothing . No man felt that more sincerely than Mr Haredale . He told the man as much , and left the house . Feeling that he might have anticipated this occurrence , after what he had seen at Chigwell in the morning , where no man dared to touch a spade , though he offered a large reward to all who would come and dig among the ruins of his house , he walked along the Strand ; too proud to expose himself to another refusal , and of too generous a spirit to involve in distress or ruin any honest tradesman who might be weak enough to give him shelter . He wandered into one of the streets by the side of the river , and was pacing in a thoughtful manner up and down , thinking of things that had happened long ago , when he heard a servant - man at an upper window call to another on the opposite side of the street , that the mob were setting fire to Newgate . To Newgate ! where that man was ! His failing strength returned , his energies came back with tenfold vigour , on the instant . If it were possible -- if they should set the murderer free -- was he , after all he had undergone , to die with the suspicion of having slain his own brother , dimly gathering about him-- He had no consciousness of going to the jail ; but there he stood , before it . There was the crowd wedged and pressed together in a dense , dark , moving mass ; and there were the flames soaring up into the air . His head turned round and round , lights flashed before his eyes , and he struggled hard with two men . ‘
250421	250425	248756	248756	he	0	’ said one . ‘
250451	250452	250444	250444	you	6000	’ ‘
250461	250473	250453	250454	The gentleman	1227	’ said the other , forcing him along as he spoke . ‘
250487	250564	250483	250483	him	1227	’ They had by this time got him into a court , hard by the prison . He looked from one to the other , and as he tried to release himself , felt that he tottered on his feet . He who had spoken first , was the old gentleman whom he had seen at the Lord Mayor ’s . The other was John Grueby , who had stood by him so manfully at Westminster . ‘
250570	250576	250483	250483	him	1227	’ he asked them faintly . ‘
250582	250583	250588	250589	the crowd	7574	’ ‘
250591	250596	250588	250589	the crowd	7574	’ returned the distiller ; ‘
250615	250616	250607	250607	You	6007	’ ‘
250619	250633	250607	250607	You	6007	’ said Mr Haredale , looking in a kind of stupor at John . ‘
250640	250646	250634	250634	He	1009	’ returned the old gentleman , ‘
250716	250725	250727	250727	John	322	’ --‘On one condition , please , sir , ’
250757	250758	250751	250752	My lord	3194	’ ‘
250768	250774	250751	250752	My lord	3194	’ rejoined the old distiller . ‘
250794	253275	253279	253279	they	6020	’ John Grueby added no entreaties , but he adopted a different kind of persuasion , by putting his arm through one of Mr Haredale ’s , while his master took the other , and leading him away with all speed . Sensible , from a strange lightness in his head , and a difficulty in fixing his thoughts on anything , even to the extent of bearing his companions in his mind for a minute together without looking at them , that his brain was affected by the agitation and suffering through which he had passed , and to which he was still a prey , Mr Haredale let them lead him where they would . As they went along , he was conscious of having no command over what he said or thought , and that he had a fear of going mad . The distiller lived , as he had told him when they first met , on Holborn Hill , where he had great storehouses and drove a large trade . They approached his house by a back entrance , lest they should attract the notice of the crowd , and went into an upper room which faced towards the street ; the windows , however , in common with those of every other room in the house , were boarded up inside , in order that , out of doors , all might appear quite dark . They laid him on a sofa in this chamber , perfectly insensible ; but John immediately fetching a surgeon , who took from him a large quantity of blood , he gradually came to himself . As he was , for the time , too weak to walk , they had no difficulty in persuading him to remain there all night , and got him to bed without loss of a minute . That done , they gave him cordial and some toast , and presently a pretty strong composing - draught , under the influence of which he soon fell into a lethargy , and , for a time , forgot his troubles . The vintner , who was a very hearty old fellow and a worthy man , had no thoughts of going to bed himself , for he had received several threatening warnings from the rioters , and had indeed gone out that evening to try and gather from the conversation of the mob whether his house was to be the next attacked . He sat all night in an easy - chair in the same room -- dozing a little now and then -- and received from time to time the reports of John Grueby and two or three other trustworthy persons in his employ , who went out into the streets as scouts ; and for whose entertainment an ample allowance of good cheer ( which the old vintner , despite his anxiety , now and then attacked himself ) was set forth in an adjoining chamber . These accounts were of a sufficiently alarming nature from the first ; but as the night wore on , they grew so much worse , and involved such a fearful amount of riot and destruction , that in comparison with these new tidings all the previous disturbances sunk to nothing . The first intelligence that came , was of the taking of Newgate , and the escape of all the prisoners , whose track , as they made up Holborn and into the adjacent streets , was proclaimed to those citizens who were shut up in their houses , by the rattling of their chains , which formed a dismal concert , and was heard in every direction , as though so many forges were at work . The flames too , shone so brightly through the vintner ’s skylights , that the rooms and staircases below were nearly as light as in broad day ; while the distant shouting of the mob seemed to shake the very walls and ceilings . At length they were heard approaching the house , and some minutes of terrible anxiety ensued . They came close up , and stopped before it ; but after giving three loud yells , went on . And although they returned several times that night , creating new alarms each time , they did nothing there ; having their hands full . Shortly after they had gone away for the first time , one of the scouts came running in with the news that they had stopped before Lord Mansfield ’s house in Bloomsbury Square . Soon afterwards there came another , and another , and then the first returned again , and so , by little and little , their tale was this:--That the mob gathering round Lord Mansfield ’s house , had called on those within to open the door , and receiving no reply ( for Lord and Lady Mansfield were at that moment escaping by the backway ) , forced an entrance according to their usual custom . That they then began to demolish the house with great fury , and setting fire to it in several parts , involved in a common ruin the whole of the costly furniture , the plate and jewels , a beautiful gallery of pictures , the rarest collection of manuscripts ever possessed by any one private person in the world , and worse than all , because nothing could replace this loss , the great Law Library , on almost every page of which were notes in the Judge ’s own hand , of inestimable value,--being the results of the study and experience of his whole life . That while they were howling and exulting round the fire , a troop of soldiers , with a magistrate among them , came up , and being too late ( for the mischief was by that time done ) , began to disperse the crowd . That the Riot Act being read , and the crowd still resisting , the soldiers received orders to fire , and levelling their muskets shot dead at the first discharge six men and a woman , and wounded many persons ; and loading again directly , fired another volley , but over the people ’s heads it was supposed , as none were seen to fall . That thereupon , and daunted by the shrieks and tumult , the crowd began to disperse , and the soldiers went away , leaving the killed and wounded on the ground : which they had no sooner done than the rioters came back again , and taking up the dead bodies , and the wounded people , formed into a rude procession , having the bodies in the front . That in this order they paraded off with a horrible merriment ; fixing weapons in the dead men ’s hands to make them look as if alive ; and preceded by a fellow ringing Lord Mansfield ’s dinner - bell with all his might . The scouts reported further , that this party meeting with some others who had been at similar work elsewhere , they all united into one , and drafting off a few men with the killed and wounded , marched away to Lord Mansfield ’s country seat at Caen Wood , between Hampstead and Highgate ; bent upon destroying that house likewise , and lighting up a great fire there , which from that height should be seen all over London . But in this , they were disappointed , for a party of horse having arrived before them , they retreated faster than they went , and came straight back to town . There being now a great many parties in the streets , each went to work according to its humour , and a dozen houses were quickly blazing , including those of Sir John Fielding and two other justices , and four in Holborn -- one of the greatest thoroughfares in London -- which were all burning at the same time , and burned until they went out of themselves , for the people cut the engine hose , and would not suffer the firemen to play upon the flames . At one house near Moorfields , they found in one of the rooms some canary birds in cages , and these they cast into the fire alive . The poor little creatures screamed , it was said , like infants , when they were flung upon the blaze ; and one man was so touched that he tried in vain to save them , which roused the indignation of the crowd , and nearly cost him his life . At this same house , one of the fellows who went through the rooms , breaking the furniture and helping to destroy the building , found a child ’s doll -- a poor toy -- which he exhibited at the window to the mob below , as the image of some unholy saint which the late occupants had worshipped . While he was doing this , another man with an equally tender conscience ( they had both been foremost in throwing down the canary birds for roasting alive ) , took his seat on the parapet of the house , and harangued the crowd from a pamphlet circulated by the Association , relative to the true principles of Christianity ! Meanwhile the Lord Mayor , with his hands in his pockets , looked on as an idle man might look at any other show , and seemed mightily satisfied to have got a good place . Such were the accounts brought to the old vintner by his servants as he sat at the side of Mr Haredale ’s bed , having been unable even to doze , after the first part of the night ; too much disturbed by his own fears ; by the cries of the mob , the light of the fires , and the firing of the soldiers . Such , with the addition of the release of all the prisoners in the New Jail at Clerkenwell , and as many robberies of passengers in the streets , as the crowd had leisure to indulge in , were the scenes of which Mr Haredale was happily unconscious , and which were all enacted before midnight . Chapter 67 When darkness broke away and morning began to dawn , the town wore a strange aspect indeed . Sleep had hardly been thought of all night . The general alarm was so apparent in the faces of the inhabitants , and its expression was so aggravated by want of rest ( few persons , with any property to lose , having dared go to bed since Monday ) , that a stranger coming into the streets would have supposed some mortal pest or plague to have been raging . In place of the usual cheerfulness and animation of morning , everything was dead and silent . The shops remained closed , offices and warehouses were shut , the coach and chair stands were deserted , no carts or waggons rumbled through the slowly waking streets , the early cries were all hushed ; a universal gloom prevailed . Great numbers of people were out , even at daybreak , but they flitted to and fro as though they shrank from the sound of their own footsteps ; the public ways were haunted rather than frequented ; and round the smoking ruins people stood apart from one another and in silence , not venturing to condemn the rioters , or to be supposed to do so , even in whispers . At the Lord President ’s in Piccadilly , at Lambeth Palace , at the Lord Chancellor ’s in Great Ormond Street , in the Royal Exchange , the Bank , the Guildhall , the Inns of Court , the Courts of Law , and every chamber fronting the streets near Westminster Hall and the Houses of Parliament , parties of soldiers were posted before daylight . A body of Horse Guards paraded Palace Yard ; an encampment was formed in the Park , where fifteen hundred men and five battalions of Militia were under arms ; the Tower was fortified , the drawbridges were raised , the cannon loaded and pointed , and two regiments of artillery busied in strengthening the fortress and preparing it for defence . A numerous detachment of soldiers were stationed to keep guard at the New River Head , which the people had threatened to attack , and where , it was said , they meant to cut off the main - pipes , so that there might be no water for the extinction of the flames . In the Poultry , and on Cornhill , and at several other leading points , iron chains were drawn across the street ; parties of soldiers were distributed in some of the old city churches while it was yet dark ; and in several private houses ( among them , Lord Rockingham ’s in Grosvenor Square ) ; which were blockaded as though to sustain a siege , and had guns pointed from the windows . When the sun rose , it shone into handsome apartments filled with armed men ; the furniture hastily heaped away in corners , and made of little or no account , in the terror of the time -- on arms glittering in city chambers , among desks and stools , and dusty books -- into little smoky churchyards in odd lanes and by - ways , with soldiers lying down among the tombs , or lounging under the shade of the one old tree , and their pile of muskets sparkling in the light -- on solitary sentries pacing up and down in courtyards , silent now , but yesterday resounding with the din and hum of business -- everywhere on guard - rooms , garrisons , and threatening preparations . As the day crept on , still more unusual sights were witnessed in the streets . The gates of the King ’s Bench and Fleet Prisons being opened at the usual hour , were found to have notices affixed to them , announcing that the rioters would come that night to burn them down . The wardens , too well knowing the likelihood there was of this promise being fulfilled , were fain to set their prisoners at liberty , and give them leave to move their goods ; so , all day , such of them as had any furniture were occupied in conveying it , some to this place , some to that , and not a few to the brokers ’

I could never make myself heard by knocking at a window now ; and even if I could , no one would be bold enough to connive at my escape . Through the cellars , there ’s a kind of passage into the back street by which we roll casks in and out . We shall have time to get down there before they can force an entry . Do not delay an instant , but come with me -- for both our sakes -- for mine -- my dear good sir ! ’

257098	257169	257096	257096	Joe	197	‘ first , that it was a bold thing to be in the crowd at all disguised as one of them ; though I wo n’t say much about that , on second thoughts , for that ’s my case too . Secondly , that it was a brave and glorious action -- that ’s what I call it -- to strike that fellow off his horse before their eyes ! ’
257170	257177	257009	257009	Joe	197	‘ What fellow ! Whose eyes ! ’
257178	257184	257186	257186	Joe	197	‘ What fellow , sir ! ’
257188	257264	257186	257186	Joe	197	‘ a fellow who has no goodwill to you , and who has the daring and devilry in him of twenty fellows . I know him of old .

Are you ready ? ’

260624	260647	260650	260651	the man	472	’ They had by this time returned to where he lay , and both stooped over him to look into his face . ‘
260653	260658	260650	260651	the man	472	’ his father murmured . ‘

260726	260755	260717	260717	you	0	’ said the murderer softly , as he started back a pace or two , and gazed with sunken jaw and staring eyes above his son ’s head . ‘
260759	260800	260717	260717	you	0	’ He remained in the same attitude and with the same expression on his face for a minute or more ; then glanced slowly round as if he had lost something ; and went shivering back , towards the shed . ‘
260809	261269	260802	260802	I	0	’ asked Barnaby , who had looked on , wondering . He only answered with a suppressed groan , and lying down upon the ground , wrapped his cloak about his head , and shrunk into the darkest corner . Finding that nothing would rouse Hugh now , or make him sensible for a moment , Barnaby dragged him along the grass , and laid him on a little heap of refuse hay and straw which had been his own bed ; first having brought some water from a running stream hard by , and washed his wound , and laved his hands and face . Then he lay down himself , between the two , to pass the night ; and looking at the stars , fell fast asleep . Awakened early in the morning , by the sunshine and the songs of birds , and hum of insects , he left them sleeping in the hut , and walked into the sweet and pleasant air . But he felt that on his jaded senses , oppressed and burdened with the dreadful scenes of last night , and many nights before , all the beauties of opening day , which he had so often tasted , and in which he had had such deep delight , fell heavily . He thought of the blithe mornings when he and the dogs went bounding on together through the woods and fields ; and the recollection filled his eyes with tears . He had no consciousness , God help him , of having done wrong , nor had he any new perception of the merits of the cause in which he had been engaged , or those of the men who advocated it ; but he was full of cares now , and regrets , and dismal recollections , and wishes ( quite unknown to him before ) that this or that event had never happened , and that the sorrow and suffering of so many people had been spared . And now he began to think how happy they would be -- his father , mother , he , and Hugh -- if they rambled away together , and lived in some lonely place , where there were none of these troubles ; and that perhaps the blind man , who had talked so wisely about gold , and told him of the great secrets he knew , could teach them how to live without being pinched by want . As this occurred to him , he was the more sorry that he had not seen him last night ; and he was still brooding over this regret , when his father came , and touched him on the shoulder . ‘
261272	261283	260802	260802	I	0	’ cried Barnaby , starting from his fit of thoughtfulness . ‘
261289	261290	261287	261287	you	6377	’ ‘

261366	261367	261354	261354	You	0	’ ‘
261371	261377	261369	261369	I	0	’ cried Barnaby , delighted ; ‘

261430	261431	261444	261444	He	1085	’ ‘
261438	261443	261434	261434	you	7315	’ he cried gaily . ‘
261452	261453	261444	261444	He	1085	’ ‘
261459	261476	261444	261444	He	1085	’ said his father , plucking the scraps of ribbon and the feathers from his hat , ‘
261523	261524	261516	261516	he	1085	’ ‘
261529	261533	261516	261516	he	1085	’ said Barnaby . ‘
261566	261948	261562	261562	I	0	’ He was speedily dressed , and as well disguised as he could be . With a lighter heart he then set off upon his second journey , leaving Hugh , who was still in a drunken stupor , stretched upon the ground within the shed , and his father walking to and fro before it . The murderer , full of anxious thoughts , looked after him , and paced up and down , disquieted by every breath of air that whispered among the boughs , and by every light shadow thrown by the passing clouds upon the daisied ground . He was anxious for his safe return , and yet , though his own life and safety hung upon it , felt a relief while he was gone . In the intense selfishness which the constant presence before him of his great crimes , and their consequences here and hereafter , engendered , every thought of Barnaby , as his son , was swallowed up and lost . Still , his presence was a torture and reproach ; in his wild eyes , there were terrible images of that guilty night ; with his unearthly aspect , and his half - formed mind , he seemed to the murderer a creature who had sprung into existence from his victim ’s blood . He could not bear his look , his voice , his touch ; and yet he was forced , by his own desperate condition and his only hope of cheating the gibbet , to have him by his side , and to know that he was inseparable from his single chance of escape . He walked to and fro , with little rest , all day , revolving these things in his mind ; and still Hugh lay , unconscious , in the shed . At length , when the sun was setting , Barnaby returned , leading the blind man , and talking earnestly to him as they came along together . The murderer advanced to meet them , and bidding his son go on and speak to Hugh , who had just then staggered to his feet , took his place at the blind man ’s elbow , and slowly followed , towards the shed . ‘
261955	261959	261951	261951	you	6387	’ said Stagg . ‘
261978	261979	261962	261962	you	6387	’ ‘
261988	261993	261981	261981	you	6387	’ returned the other . ‘

262119	262120	262108	262108	she	6391	’ ‘
262123	262138	262108	262108	she	6391	’ returned the blind man emphatically , as he turned his face towards him . ‘
262379	262435	262436	262436	You	6391	’ When he had concluded this narration , during which he had made several pauses , for the convenience of cracking and eating nuts , of which he seemed to have a pocketful , the blind man pulled a flask from his pocket , took a draught himself , and offered it to his companion . ‘
262444	262456	262436	262436	You	6391	’ he said , feeling that he pushed it from him . ‘
262475	262476	262477	262477	Death	403	’ ‘
262479	262488	262477	262477	Death	403	’ said the other , holding him back . ‘

Let me know where you are , and leave the rest to me . She MUST come round ; she ca n’t hold out long ; and as to the chances of your being retaken in the meanwhile , why it was n’t one man who got out of Newgate , but three hundred . Think of that , for your comfort . ’
262614	262622	262490	262490	you	6391	‘ We must support life . How ? ’
262623	262626	262628	262630	the blind man	1085	‘ How ! ’
262632	262653	262654	262654	he	1085	‘ By eating and drinking . And how get meat and drink , but by paying for it ! Money ! ’
262661	262722	262654	262654	he	1085	‘ Is money the word ? Why , the streets have been running money . Devil send that the sport ’s not over yet , for these are jolly times ; golden , rare , roaring , scrambling times . Hallo , bully ! Hallo ! Hallo ! Drink , bully , drink . Where are ye there ! Hallo ! ’
262762	262767	262768	262768	he	1085	‘ Put it about ! ’
262777	262805	262768	262768	he	1085	‘ The kennels run with wine and gold . Guineas and strong water flow from the very pumps . About with it , do n’t spare it ! ’
262891	262898	262900	262901	that personage	6409	‘ No offence , no offence , ’
262928	262970	262908	262908	Hugh	198	‘ No offence , brother . Barnaby here too , eh ? How are you , Barnaby ? And two other gentlemen ! Your humble servant , gentlemen . No offence to YOU either , I hope . Eh , brothers ? ’

263182	263188	263175	263175	your	198	’ Hugh answered , sulkily . ‘
263198	263207	263190	263190	I	0	’ said Dennis , with a friendly smile , ‘

263269	263286	263265	263265	you	198	’ He had by this time approached , and now ventured to sit down by him . ‘
263291	263295	263289	263289	I	0	’ answered Hugh . ‘
263337	263338	263322	263322	you	198	’ ‘
263347	263362	263363	263363	Your	198	’ said Dennis , gently checking Hugh ’s uplifted hand , which looked threatening . ‘
263373	263374	263363	263363	Your	198	’ ‘
263399	263414	263393	263393	I	0	’ he added , in the tone of a desponding and an injured man , ‘
263439	263454	263430	263430	I	0	’ Hugh told him , with an oath , that he had thought so . ‘
263457	263464	263430	263430	I	0	’ said Mr Dennis , mournfully , ‘
263509	263510	263507	263507	brother	9503	’ ‘
263517	263529	263515	263515	mine	9503	’ said Hugh , in the same sullen manner as before ; ‘
263553	263554	263515	263515	mine	9503	’ ‘
263560	263582	263515	263515	mine	9503	’ said Mr Dennis , still keeping it in his hand , and feeling the edge with an air of abstraction . ‘
263608	263623	263515	263515	mine	9503	’re not a - going to ask me to take a sup out of that ‘
263629	263659	263607	263607	you	9503	’ Hugh passed it towards him . As he raised it to his lips , Barnaby jumped up , and motioning them to be silent , looked eagerly out . ‘
263667	263688	263689	263689	Hush	405	’ said Dennis , glancing at Hugh and dropping the flask , but still holding the axe in his hand . ‘
263691	263696	263689	263689	Hush	405	’ he answered softly . ‘
263706	263707	263699	263699	I	0	’ ‘
263710	263731	263733	263733	SOLDIERS	10984	’ cried the hangman , raising his voice to its highest pitch , and laying hold of him and Hugh . ‘
263737	263765	263733	263733	SOLDIERS	10984	’ That moment , the shed was filled with armed men ; and a body of horse , galloping into the field , drew up before it . ‘
263768	263784	263733	263733	SOLDIERS	10984	’ said Dennis , who remained untouched among them when they had seized their prisoners ; ‘
263814	263829	263812	263812	brother	9503	’ he added , in a tone of resignation , addressing himself to Hugh ; ‘
263892	263906	263886	263886	you	9503	‘ em , gentlemen , I think I can make a shift to tie ‘
263913	264200	263910	263910	you	9503	’ But this operation was postponed for a few moments by a new occurrence . The blind man , whose ears were quicker than most people ’s sight , had been alarmed , before Barnaby , by a rustling in the bushes , under cover of which the soldiers had advanced . He retreated instantly -- had hidden somewhere for a minute -- and probably in his confusion mistaking the point at which he had emerged , was now seen running across the open meadow . An officer cried directly that he had helped to plunder a house last night . He was loudly called on , to surrender . He ran the harder , and in a few seconds would have been out of gunshot . The word was given , and the men fired . There was a breathless pause and a profound silence , during which all eyes were fixed upon him . He had been seen to start at the discharge , as if the report had frightened him . But he neither stopped nor slackened his pace in the least , and ran on full forty yards further . Then , without one reel or stagger , or sign of faintness , or quivering of any limb , he dropped . Some of them hurried up to where he lay;--the hangman with them . Everything had passed so quickly , that the smoke had not yet scattered , but curled slowly off in a little cloud , which seemed like the dead man ’s spirit moving solemnly away . There were a few drops of blood upon the grass -- more , when they turned him over -- that was all . ‘
264207	264232	264341	264342	the serjeant	9293	’ said the hangman , stooping one knee beside the body , and gazing up with a disconsolate face at the officer and men . ‘
264239	264240	264341	264342	the serjeant	9293	’ ‘
264247	264252	264253	264253	Serjeant	6435	’ replied the officer . ‘
264262	264330	264257	264257	he	6435	’ The man turned his pockets out upon the grass , and counted , besides some foreign coins and two rings , five - and - forty guineas in gold . These were bundled up in a handkerchief and carried away ; the body remained there for the present , but six men and the serjeant were left to take it to the nearest public - house . ‘
264336	264339	264341	264342	the serjeant	9293	’re going , ’
264369	264376	264381	264381	he	187	‘ Do n’t talk to me ! ’
264388	264395	264381	264381	he	187	‘ Here ’s a pretty sight ! ’
264396	264411	264413	264414	the serjeant	9293	‘ It ’s not one that you care for much , I should think , ’
264417	264422	264424	264425	Mr Dennis	187	‘ Why , who , ’
264428	264439	264424	264425	Mr Dennis	187	‘ should care for it , if I do n’t ? ’
264440	264454	264456	264457	the serjeant	9293	‘ Oh ! I did n’t know you was so tender - hearted , ’
264459	264464	264456	264457	the serjeant	9293	‘ That ’s all ! ’

264614	265594	264611	264611	wery	6448	’ Whether he derived any material consolation from binding the prisoners , is uncertain ; most probably he did . At all events his being summoned to that work , diverted him , for the time , from these painful reflections , and gave his thoughts a more congenial occupation . They were not all three carried off together , but in two parties ; Barnaby and his father , going by one road in the centre of a body of foot ; and Hugh , fast bound upon a horse , and strongly guarded by a troop of cavalry , being taken by another . They had no opportunity for the least communication , in the short interval which preceded their departure ; being kept strictly apart . Hugh only observed that Barnaby walked with a drooping head among his guard , and , without raising his eyes , that he tried to wave his fettered hand when he passed . For himself , he buoyed up his courage as he rode along , with the assurance that the mob would force his jail wherever it might be , and set him at liberty . But when they got into London , and more especially into Fleet Market , lately the stronghold of the rioters , where the military were rooting out the last remnant of the crowd , he saw that this hope was gone , and felt that he was riding to his death . Chapter 70 Mr Dennis having despatched this piece of business without any personal hurt or inconvenience , and having now retired into the tranquil respectability of private life , resolved to solace himself with half an hour or so of female society . With this amiable purpose in his mind , he bent his steps towards the house where Dolly and Miss Haredale were still confined , and whither Miss Miggs had also been removed by order of Mr Simon Tappertit . As he walked along the streets with his leather gloves clasped behind him , and his face indicative of cheerful thought and pleasant calculation , Mr Dennis might have been likened unto a farmer ruminating among his crops , and enjoying by anticipation the bountiful gifts of Providence . Look where he would , some heap of ruins afforded him rich promise of a working off ; the whole town appeared to have been ploughed and sown , and nurtured by most genial weather ; and a goodly harvest was at hand . Having taken up arms and resorted to deeds of violence , with the great main object of preserving the Old Bailey in all its purity , and the gallows in all its pristine usefulness and moral grandeur , it would perhaps be going too far to assert that Mr Dennis had ever distinctly contemplated and foreseen this happy state of things . He rather looked upon it as one of those beautiful dispensations which are inscrutably brought about for the behoof and advantage of good men . He felt , as it were , personally referred to , in this prosperous ripening for the gibbet ; and had never considered himself so much the pet and favourite child of Destiny , or loved that lady so well or with such a calm and virtuous reliance , in all his life . As to being taken up , himself , for a rioter , and punished with the rest , Mr Dennis dismissed that possibility from his thoughts as an idle chimera ; arguing that the line of conduct he had adopted at Newgate , and the service he had rendered that day , would be more than a set - off against any evidence which might identify him as a member of the crowd . That any charge of companionship which might be made against him by those who were themselves in danger , would certainly go for nought . And that if any trivial indiscretion on his part should unluckily come out , the uncommon usefulness of his office , at present , and the great demand for the exercise of its functions , would certainly cause it to be winked at , and passed over . In a word , he had played his cards throughout , with great care ; had changed sides at the very nick of time ; had delivered up two of the most notorious rioters , and a distinguished felon to boot ; and was quite at his ease . Saving -- for there is a reservation ; and even Mr Dennis was not perfectly happy -- saving for one circumstance ; to wit , the forcible detention of Dolly and Miss Haredale , in a house almost adjoining his own . This was a stumbling - block ; for if they were discovered and released , they could , by the testimony they had it in their power to give , place him in a situation of great jeopardy ; and to set them at liberty , first extorting from them an oath of secrecy and silence , was a thing not to be thought of . It was more , perhaps , with an eye to the danger which lurked in this quarter , than from his abstract love of conversation with the sex , that the hangman , quickening his steps , now hastened into their society , cursing the amorous natures of Hugh and Mr Tappertit with great heartiness , at every step he took . When he entered the miserable room in which they were confined , Dolly and Miss Haredale withdrew in silence to the remotest corner . But Miss Miggs , who was particularly tender of her reputation , immediately fell upon her knees and began to scream very loud , crying , ‘
265629	265634	265636	265636	Dennis	187	‘ Miss , miss , ’

265867	265981	265863	265863	you	239	’ The coaxing tone in which he said these latter words might have failed in its object , if he had not accompanied them with sundry sharp jerks of his thumb over one shoulder , and with divers winks and thrustings of his tongue into his cheek , from which signals the damsel gathered that he sought to speak to her apart , concerning Miss Haredale and Dolly . Her curiosity being very powerful , and her jealousy by no means inactive , she arose , and with a great deal of shivering and starting back , and much muscular action among all the small bones in her throat , gradually approached him . ‘
265985	266066	265863	265863	you	239	’ said the hangman . Suiting the action to the word , he thrust her rather suddenly and prematurely into a chair , and designing to reassure her by a little harmless jocularity , such as is adapted to please and fascinate the sex , converted his right forefinger into an ideal bradawl or gimlet , and made as though he would screw the same into her side -- whereat Miss Miggs shrieked again , and evinced symptoms of faintness . ‘
266072	266083	265863	265863	you	239	’ whispered Dennis , drawing his chair close to hers . ‘

266173	266220	266155	266156	good gentleman	11322	’ he said , looking so soothingly , not to say amorously on Miggs , that she sat , as she afterwards remarked , on pins and needles of the sharpest Whitechapel kind , not knowing what intentions might be suggesting that expression to his features : ‘

266324	266338	266320	266320	Miggs	239	‘ should not reduce me . No . Not if I was Wenis . ’

266357	266367	266369	266369	Miggs	239	‘ No , I am not , good gentleman , ’
266400	266417	266396	266396	she	239	‘ No , I am not , good gentleman . Do n’t charge me with it . ’
266549	266558	266560	266560	Dennis	187	‘ When was Simmuns here , I say ? ’
266566	266588	266560	266560	Dennis	187	‘ Not since yesterday morning ; and then only for a few minutes . Not all day , the day before . ’
266589	266602	266604	266604	Dennis	187	‘ You know he meant all along to carry off that one ! ’
266624	266689	266614	266614	his	187	’ Miss Miggs , who had fallen into a terrible state of grief when the first part of this sentence was spoken , recovered a little at the second , and seemed by the sudden check she put upon her tears , to intimate that possibly this arrangement might meet her views ; and that it might , perhaps , remain an open question . ‘
266693	266701	266702	266703	somebody else	7768	’ pursued Dennis , who observed this : ‘
266736	266741	266734	266734	him	7768	’ Miss Miggs relapsed . ‘
266746	266750	266743	266743	I	0	’ said Dennis , ‘
266778	267026	266764	266764	I	0	’ Miss Miggs , brightening again , rejoined , with many breaks and pauses from excess of feeling , that temptations had been Simmuns ’s bane . That it was not his faults , but hers ( meaning Dolly ’s ) . That men did not see through these dreadful arts as women did , and therefore was caged and trapped , as Simmun had been . That she had no personal motives to serve -- far from it -- on the contrary , her intentions was good towards all parties . But forasmuch as she knowed that Simmun , if united to any designing and artful minxes ( she would name no names , for that was not her dispositions)--to ANY designing and artful minxes -- must be made miserable and unhappy for life , she DID incline towards prewentions . Such , she added , was her free confessions . But as this was private feelings , and might perhaps be looked upon as wengeance , she begged the gentleman would say no more . Whatever he said , wishing to do her duty by all mankind , even by them as had ever been her bitterest enemies , she would not listen to him . With that she stopped her ears , and shook her head from side to side , to intimate to Mr Dennis that though he talked until he had no breath left , she was as deaf as any adder . ‘
267035	267040	266764	266764	I	0	’ said Mr Dennis , ‘
267087	267088	267092	267092	sir	7320	’ ‘
267094	267111	267092	267092	sir	7320	’ asked Miggs -- still with her fingers in her ears and her head shaking obstinately . ‘
267120	269554	267114	267116	the tallest one	6473	’ said Dennis , as he stroked his chin , and added , in an undertone to himself , something about not crossing Muster Gashford . Miss Miggs replied ( still being profoundly deaf ) that if Miss Haredale stood in the way at all , he might make himself quite easy on that score ; as she had gathered , from what passed between Hugh and Mr Tappertit when they were last there , that she was to be removed alone ( not by them , but by somebody else ) , to - morrow night . Mr Dennis opened his eyes very wide at this piece of information , whistled once , considered once , and finally slapped his head once and nodded once , as if he had got the clue to this mysterious removal , and so dismissed it . Then he imparted his design concerning Dolly to Miss Miggs , who was taken more deaf than before , when he began ; and so remained , all through . The notable scheme was this . Mr Dennis was immediately to seek out from among the rioters , some daring young fellow ( and he had one in his eye , he said ) , who , terrified by the threats he could hold out to him , and alarmed by the capture of so many who were no better and no worse than he , would gladly avail himself of any help to get abroad , and out of harm ’s way , with his plunder , even though his journey were incumbered by an unwilling companion ; indeed , the unwilling companion being a beautiful girl , would probably be an additional inducement and temptation . Such a person found , he proposed to bring him there on the ensuing night , when the tall one was taken off , and Miss Miggs had purposely retired ; and then that Dolly should be gagged , muffled in a cloak , and carried in any handy conveyance down to the river ’s side ; where there were abundant means of getting her smuggled snugly off in any small craft of doubtful character , and no questions asked . With regard to the expense of this removal , he would say , at a rough calculation , that two or three silver tea or coffee - pots , with something additional for drink ( such as a muffineer , or toast - rack ) , would more than cover it . Articles of plate of every kind having been buried by the rioters in several lonely parts of London , and particularly , as he knew , in St James ’s Square , which , though easy of access , was little frequented after dark , and had a convenient piece of water in the midst , the needful funds were close at hand , and could be had upon the shortest notice . With regard to Dolly , the gentleman would exercise his own discretion . He would be bound to do nothing but to take her away , and keep her away . All other arrangements and dispositions would rest entirely with himself . If Miss Miggs had had her hearing , no doubt she would have been greatly shocked by the indelicacy of a young female ’s going away with a stranger by night ( for her moral feelings , as we have said , were of the tenderest kind ) ; but directly Mr Dennis ceased to speak , she reminded him that he had only wasted breath . She then went on to say ( still with her fingers in her ears ) that nothing less than a severe practical lesson would save the locksmith ’s daughter from utter ruin ; and that she felt it , as it were , a moral obligation and a sacred duty to the family , to wish that some one would devise one for her reformation . Miss Miggs remarked , and very justly , as an abstract sentiment which happened to occur to her at the moment , that she dared to say the locksmith and his wife would murmur , and repine , if they were ever , by forcible abduction , or otherwise , to lose their child ; but that we seldom knew , in this world , what was best for us : such being our sinful and imperfect natures , that very few arrived at that clear understanding . Having brought their conversation to this satisfactory end , they parted : Dennis , to pursue his design , and take another walk about his farm ; Miss Miggs , to launch , when he left her , into such a burst of mental anguish ( which she gave them to understand was occasioned by certain tender things he had had the presumption and audacity to say ) , that little Dolly ’s heart was quite melted . Indeed , she said and did so much to soothe the outraged feelings of Miss Miggs , and looked so beautiful while doing so , that if that young maid had not had ample vent for her surpassing spite , in a knowledge of the mischief that was brewing , she must have scratched her features , on the spot . Chapter 71 All next day , Emma Haredale , Dolly , and Miggs , remained cooped up together in what had now been their prison for so many days , without seeing any person , or hearing any sound but the murmured conversation , in an outer room , of the men who kept watch over them . There appeared to be more of these fellows than there had been hitherto ; and they could no longer hear the voices of women , which they had before plainly distinguished . Some new excitement , too , seemed to prevail among them ; for there was much stealthy going in and out , and a constant questioning of those who were newly arrived . They had previously been quite reckless in their behaviour ; often making a great uproar ; quarrelling among themselves , fighting , dancing , and singing . They were now very subdued and silent , conversing almost in whispers , and stealing in and out with a soft and stealthy tread , very different from the boisterous trampling in which their arrivals and departures had hitherto been announced to the trembling captives . Whether this change was occasioned by the presence among them of some person of authority in their ranks , or by any other cause , they were unable to decide . Sometimes they thought it was in part attributable to there being a sick man in the chamber , for last night there had been a shuffling of feet , as though a burden were brought in , and afterwards a moaning noise . But they had no means of ascertaining the truth : for any question or entreaty on their parts only provoked a storm of execrations , or something worse ; and they were too happy to be left alone , unassailed by threats or admiration , to risk even that comfort , by any voluntary communication with those who held them in durance . It was sufficiently evident , both to Emma and to the locksmith ’s poor little daughter herself , that she , Dolly , was the great object of attraction ; and that so soon as they should have leisure to indulge in the softer passion , Hugh and Mr Tappertit would certainly fall to blows for her sake ; in which latter case , it was not very difficult to see whose prize she would become . With all her old horror of that man revived , and deepened into a degree of aversion and abhorrence which no language can describe ; with a thousand old recollections and regrets , and causes of distress , anxiety , and fear , besetting her on all sides ; poor Dolly Varden -- sweet , blooming , buxom Dolly -- began to hang her head , and fade , and droop , like a beautiful flower . The colour fled from her cheeks , her courage forsook her , her gentle heart failed . Unmindful of all her provoking caprices , forgetful of all her conquests and inconstancy , with all her winning little vanities quite gone , she nestled all the livelong day in Emma Haredale ’s bosom ; and , sometimes calling on her dear old grey - haired father , sometimes on her mother , and sometimes even on her old home , pined slowly away , like a poor bird in its cage . Light hearts , light hearts , that float so gaily on a smooth stream , that are so sparkling and buoyant in the sunshine -- down upon fruit , bloom upon flowers , blush in summer air , life of the winged insect , whose whole existence is a day -- how soon ye sink in troubled water ! Poor Dolly ’s heart -- a little , gentle , idle , fickle thing ; giddy , restless , fluttering ; constant to nothing but bright looks , and smiles and laughter -- Dolly ’s heart was breaking . Emma had known grief , and could bear it better . She had little comfort to impart , but she could soothe and tend her , and she did so ; and Dolly clung to her like a child to its nurse . In endeavouring to inspire her with some fortitude , she increased her own ; and though the nights were long , and the days dismal , and she felt the wasting influence of watching and fatigue , and had perhaps a more defined and clear perception of their destitute condition and its worst dangers , she uttered no complaint . Before the ruffians , in whose power they were , she bore herself so calmly , and with such an appearance , in the midst of all her terror , of a secret conviction that they dared not harm her , that there was not a man among them but held her in some degree of dread ; and more than one believed she had a weapon hidden in her dress , and was prepared to use it . Such was their condition when they were joined by Miss Miggs , who gave them to understand that she too had been taken prisoner because of her charms , and detailed such feats of resistance she had performed ( her virtue having given her supernatural strength ) , that they felt it quite a happiness to have her for a champion . Nor was this the only comfort they derived at first from Miggs ’s presence and society : for that young lady displayed such resignation and long - suffering , and so much meek endurance , under her trials , and breathed in all her chaste discourse a spirit of such holy confidence and resignation , and devout belief that all would happen for the best , that Emma felt her courage strengthened by the bright example ; never doubting but that everything she said was true , and that she , like them , was torn from all she loved , and agonised by doubt and apprehension . As to poor Dolly , she was roused , at first , by seeing one who came from home ; but when she heard under what circumstances she had left it , and into whose hands her father had fallen , she wept more bitterly than ever , and refused all comfort . Miss Miggs was at some trouble to reprove her for this state of mind , and to entreat her to take example by herself , who , she said , was now receiving back , with interest , tenfold the amount of her subscriptions to the red - brick dwelling - house , in the articles of peace of mind and a quiet conscience . And , while on serious topics , Miss Miggs considered it her duty to try her hand at the conversion of Miss Haredale ; for whose improvement she launched into a polemical address of some length , in the course whereof , she likened herself unto a chosen missionary , and that young lady to a cannibal in darkness . Indeed , she returned so often to these subjects , and so frequently called upon them to take a lesson from her,--at the same time vaunting and , as it were , rioting in , her huge unworthiness , and abundant excess of sin,--that , in the course of a short time , she became , in that small chamber , rather a nuisance than a comfort , and rendered them , if possible , even more unhappy than they had been before . The night had now come ; and for the first time ( for their jailers had been regular in bringing food and candles ) , they were left in darkness . Any change in their condition in such a place inspired new fears ; and when some hours had passed , and the gloom was still unbroken , Emma could no longer repress her alarm . They listened attentively . There was the same murmuring in the outer room , and now and then a moan which seemed to be wrung from a person in great pain , who made an effort to subdue it , but could not . Even these men seemed to be in darkness too ; for no light shone through the chinks in the door , nor were they moving , as their custom was , but quite still : the silence being unbroken by so much as the creaking of a board . At first , Miss Miggs wondered greatly in her own mind who this sick person might be ; but arriving , on second thoughts , at the conclusion that he was a part of the schemes on foot , and an artful device soon to be employed with great success , she opined , for Miss Haredale ’s comfort , that it must be some misguided Papist who had been wounded : and this happy supposition encouraged her to say , under her breath , ‘

271239	271248	271233	271234	pretty fool	6515	’ he replied , frowning angrily upon her . ‘
271353	271416	271336	271336	he	206	’ There was a reproof conveyed in these words , which to a nature like Emma Haredale ’s , was well addressed . But Dolly , who was differently constituted , was by no means touched by it , and still conjured her , in all the terms of affection and attachment she could think of , not to be lured away . ‘
271420	271451	271336	271336	he	206	’ said their visitor , who , although he sought to express the deepest interest , had something cold and even in his speech , that grated on the ear ; ‘

I can give some very valuable information , and render important assistance to any inquiry . You will have to answer it , if I receive ill usage . ‘
272415	272423	272329	272329	he	6528	’ cried Joe , in deep disgust . ‘

272477	272483	272485	272485	Joe	197	‘ And now , gentlemen , ’
272504	272520	272485	272485	Joe	197	‘ the sooner we get back to the Black Lion , the better , perhaps . ’
272711	273252	272706	272707	Simon Tappertit	223	‘ prentice , burnt and bruised , and with a gun - shot wound in his body ; and his legs -- his perfect legs , the pride and glory of his life , the comfort of his existence -- crushed into shapeless ugliness . Wondering no longer at the moans they had heard , Dolly kept closer to her father , and shuddered at the sight ; but neither bruises , burns , nor gun - shot wound , nor all the torture of his shattered limbs , sent half so keen a pang to Simon ’s breast , as Dolly passing out , with Joe for her preserver . A coach was ready at the door , and Dolly found herself safe and whole inside , between her father and mother , with Emma Haredale and her uncle , quite real , sitting opposite . But there was no Joe , no Edward ; and they had said nothing . They had only bowed once , and kept at a distance . Dear heart ! what a long way it was to the Black Lion ! Chapter 72 The Black Lion was so far off , and occupied such a length of time in the getting at , that notwithstanding the strong presumptive evidence she had about her of the late events being real and of actual occurrence , Dolly could not divest herself of the belief that she must be in a dream which was lasting all night . Nor was she quite certain that she saw and heard with her own proper senses , even when the coach , in the fulness of time , stopped at the Black Lion , and the host of that tavern approached in a gush of cheerful light to help them to dismount , and give them hearty welcome . There too , at the coach door , one on one side , one upon the other , were already Edward Chester and Joe Willet , who must have followed in another coach : and this was such a strange and unaccountable proceeding , that Dolly was the more inclined to favour the idea of her being fast asleep . But when Mr Willet appeared -- old John himself -- so heavy - headed and obstinate , and with such a double chin as the liveliest imagination could never in its boldest flights have conjured up in all its vast proportions -- then she stood corrected , and unwillingly admitted to herself that she was broad awake . And Joe had lost an arm -- he -- that well - made , handsome , gallant fellow ! As Dolly glanced towards him , and thought of the pain he must have suffered , and the far - off places in which he had been wandering , and wondered who had been his nurse , and hoped that whoever it was , she had been as kind and gentle and considerate as she would have been , the tears came rising to her bright eyes , one by one , little by little , until she could keep them back no longer , and so before them all , wept bitterly . ‘
273261	273268	273259	273259	Dolly	216	’ said her father , kindly . ‘
273286	273333	273280	273281	my love	1526	’ The locksmith ’s wife knew better perhaps , than he , what ailed her daughter . But Mrs Varden being quite an altered woman -- for the riots had done that good -- added her word to his , and comforted her with similar representations . ‘
273336	273349	273280	273281	my love	1526	’ said Mr Willet , senior , looking round upon the company , ‘
273369	273491	273364	273364	I	0	’ The Black Lion , who , like old John , had been waiting supper past all reasonable and conscionable hours , hailed this as a philosophical discovery of the profoundest and most penetrating kind ; and the table being already spread , they sat down to supper straightway . The conversation was not of the liveliest nature , nor were the appetites of some among them very keen . But , in both these respects , old John more than atoned for any deficiency on the part of the rest , and very much distinguished himself . It was not in point of actual conversation that Mr Willet shone so brilliantly , for he had none of his old cronies to ‘
273494	274227	273364	273364	I	0	’ and was rather timorous of venturing on Joe ; having certain vague misgivings within him , that he was ready on the shortest notice , and on receipt of the slightest offence , to fell the Black Lion to the floor of his own parlour , and immediately to withdraw to China or some other remote and unknown region , there to dwell for evermore , or at least until he had got rid of his remaining arm and both legs , and perhaps an eye or so , into the bargain . It was with a peculiar kind of pantomime that Mr Willet filled up every pause ; and in this he was considered by the Black Lion , who had been his familiar for some years , quite to surpass and go beyond himself , and outrun the expectations of his most admiring friends . The subject that worked in Mr Willet ’s mind , and occasioned these demonstrations , was no other than his son ’s bodily disfigurement , which he had never yet got himself thoroughly to believe , or comprehend . Shortly after their first meeting , he had been observed to wander , in a state of great perplexity , to the kitchen , and to direct his gaze towards the fire , as if in search of his usual adviser in all matters of doubt and difficulty . But there being no boiler at the Black Lion , and the rioters having so beaten and battered his own that it was quite unfit for further service , he wandered out again , in a perfect bog of uncertainty and mental confusion , and in that state took the strangest means of resolving his doubts : such as feeling the sleeve of his son ’s greatcoat as deeming it possible that his arm might be there ; looking at his own arms and those of everybody else , as if to assure himself that two and not one was the usual allowance ; sitting by the hour together in a brown study , as if he were endeavouring to recall Joe ’s image in his younger days , and to remember whether he really had in those times one arm or a pair ; and employing himself in many other speculations of the same kind . Finding himself at this supper , surrounded by faces with which he had been so well acquainted in old times , Mr Willet recurred to the subject with uncommon vigour ; apparently resolved to understand it now or never . Sometimes , after every two or three mouthfuls , he laid down his knife and fork , and stared at his son with all his might -- particularly at his maimed side ; then , he looked slowly round the table until he caught some person ’s eye , when he shook his head with great solemnity , patted his shoulder , winked , or as one may say -- for winking was a very slow process with him -- went to sleep with one eye for a minute or two ; and so , with another solemn shaking of his head , took up his knife and fork again , and went on eating . Sometimes , he put his food into his mouth abstractedly , and , with all his faculties concentrated on Joe , gazed at him in a fit of stupefaction as he cut his meat with one hand , until he was recalled to himself by symptoms of choking on his own part , and was by that means restored to consciousness . At other times he resorted to such small devices as asking him for the salt , the pepper , the vinegar , the mustard -- anything that was on his maimed side -- and watching him as he handed it . By dint of these experiments , he did at last so satisfy and convince himself , that , after a longer silence than he had yet maintained , he laid down his knife and fork on either side his plate , drank a long draught from a tankard beside him ( still keeping his eyes on Joe ) , and leaning backward in his chair and fetching a long breath , said , as he looked all round the board : ‘
274234	274235	274237	274237	George	323	’ ‘
274239	274252	274253	274253	he	323	’ said the Black Lion , striking the table with his hand , ‘
274258	274259	274253	274253	he	323	’ ‘
274264	274288	274262	274262	sir	7320	’ said Mr Willet , with the look of a man who felt that he had earned a compliment , and deserved it . ‘
274301	274302	274262	274262	sir	7320	’ ‘
274310	274318	274304	274304	him	323	’ said the Black Lion to Joe . ‘
274328	274329	274326	274326	father	7315	’ ‘
274337	274350	274326	274326	father	7315	’ repeated Mr Willet , softly ; again looking round the table . ‘
274359	274363	274326	274326	father	7315	’ said Joe . ‘
274372	274377	274326	274326	father	7315	’ repeated Mr Willet . ‘
274395	274512	274513	274513	My	0	’ Continuing to repeat these words to himself in a low tone of voice ( the same information had been conveyed to him in the same terms , at least fifty times before ) , Mr Willet arose from table , walked round to Joe , felt his empty sleeve all the way up , from the cuff , to where the stump of his arm remained ; shook his hand ; lighted his pipe at the fire , took a long whiff , walked to the door , turned round once when he had reached it , wiped his left eye with the back of his forefinger , and said , in a faltering voice : ‘
274677	274696	274673	274673	he	197	‘ Good night!’--he did n’t say Dolly , but there was comfort in his not saying Miss Varden . ‘
274700	274704	274673	274673	he	197	’ sobbed Dolly . ‘
274721	274726	274705	274705	I	0	’ said Joe kindly . ‘
274753	274759	274760	274760	You	216	’ Dolly cried the more . ‘

274810	274852	274808	274808	Joe	197	‘ but you are more beautiful than ever , now . You are indeed . There can be no harm in my saying so , for you must know it . You are told so very often , I am sure . ’
274945	274952	274954	274958	the locksmith ’s little daughter	6557	‘ I shall bless your name , ’
274960	274998	274954	274958	the locksmith ’s little daughter	6557	‘ as long as I live . I shall never hear it spoken without feeling as if my heart would burst . I shall remember it in my prayers , every night and morning till I die ! ’
274999	275003	275005	275005	Joe	197	‘ Will you ? ’
275009	275033	275005	275005	Joe	197	‘ Will you indeed ? It makes me -- well , it makes me very glad and proud to hear you say so . ’
275054	275058	275060	275060	Joe	197	‘ Your voice , ’
275062	275146	275060	275060	Joe	197	‘ brings up old times so pleasantly , that , for the moment , I feel as if that night -- there can be no harm in talking of that night now -- had come back , and nothing had happened in the mean time . I feel as if I had n’t suffered any hardships , but had knocked down poor Tom Cobb only yesterday , and had come to see you with my bundle on my shoulder before running away.--You remember ? ’
275187	275190	275191	275191	he	197	‘ Well ! ’
275195	275301	275191	275191	he	197	‘ it was to be otherwise , and was . I have been abroad , fighting all the summer and frozen up all the winter , ever since . I have come back as poor in purse as I went , and crippled for life besides . But , Dolly , I would rather have lost this other arm -- ay , I would rather have lost my head -- than have come back to find you dead , or anything but what I always pictured you to myself , and what I always hoped and wished to find you . Thank God for all ! ’
275351	275357	275359	275359	Joe	197	‘ I did hope once , ’
275366	275539	275359	275359	Joe	197	‘ that I might come back a rich man , and marry you . But I was a boy then , and have long known better than that . I am a poor , maimed , discharged soldier , and must be content to rub through life as I can . I ca n’t say , even now , that I shall be glad to see you married , Dolly ; but I AM glad -- yes , I am , and glad to think I can say so -- to know that you are admired and courted , and can pick and choose for a happy life . It ’s a comfort to me to know that you ’ll talk to your husband about me ; and I hope the time will come when I may be able to like him , and to shake hands with him , and to come and see you as a poor friend who knew you when you were a girl . God bless you ! ’
276003	276296	276001	276002	the labourers	6583	’ spades proved this , beyond a doubt . Seventy - two private houses and four strong jails were destroyed in the four great days of these riots . The total loss of property , as estimated by the sufferers , was one hundred and fifty - five thousand pounds ; at the lowest and least partial estimate of disinterested persons , it exceeded one hundred and twenty - five thousand pounds . For this immense loss , compensation was soon afterwards made out of the public purse , in pursuance of a vote of the House of Commons ; the sum being levied on the various wards in the city , on the county , and the borough of Southwark . Both Lord Mansfield and Lord Saville , however , who had been great sufferers , refused to accept of any compensation whatever . The House of Commons , sitting on Tuesday with locked and guarded doors , had passed a resolution to the effect that , as soon as the tumults subsided , it would immediately proceed to consider the petitions presented from many of his Majesty ’s Protestant subjects , and would take the same into its serious consideration . While this question was under debate , Mr Herbert , one of the members present , indignantly rose and called upon the House to observe that Lord George Gordon was then sitting under the gallery with the blue cockade , the signal of rebellion , in his hat . He was not only obliged , by those who sat near , to take it out ; but offering to go into the street to pacify the mob with the somewhat indefinite assurance that the House was prepared to give them ‘
276302	276775	276001	276002	the labourers	6583	’ was actually held down in his seat by the combined force of several members . In short , the disorder and violence which reigned triumphant out of doors , penetrated into the senate , and there , as elsewhere , terror and alarm prevailed , and ordinary forms were for the time forgotten . On the Thursday , both Houses had adjourned until the following Monday se’nnight , declaring it impossible to pursue their deliberations with the necessary gravity and freedom , while they were surrounded by armed troops . And now that the rioters were dispersed , the citizens were beset with a new fear ; for , finding the public thoroughfares and all their usual places of resort filled with soldiers entrusted with the free use of fire and sword , they began to lend a greedy ear to the rumours which were afloat of martial law being declared , and to dismal stories of prisoners having been seen hanging on lamp - posts in Cheapside and Fleet Street . These terrors being promptly dispelled by a Proclamation declaring that all the rioters in custody would be tried by a special commission in due course of law , a fresh alarm was engendered by its being whispered abroad that French money had been found on some of the rioters , and that the disturbances had been fomented by foreign powers who sought to compass the overthrow and ruin of England . This report , which was strengthened by the diffusion of anonymous handbills , but which , if it had any foundation at all , probably owed its origin to the circumstance of some few coins which were not English money having been swept into the pockets of the insurgents with other miscellaneous booty , and afterwards discovered on the prisoners or the dead bodies,--caused a great sensation ; and men ’s minds being in that excited state when they are most apt to catch at any shadow of apprehension , was bruited about with much industry . All remaining quiet , however , during the whole of this Friday , and on this Friday night , and no new discoveries being made , confidence began to be restored , and the most timid and desponding breathed again . In Southwark , no fewer than three thousand of the inhabitants formed themselves into a watch , and patrolled the streets every hour . Nor were the citizens slow to follow so good an example : and it being the manner of peaceful men to be very bold when the danger is over , they were abundantly fierce and daring ; not scrupling to question the stoutest passenger with great severity , and carrying it with a very high hand over all errand - boys , servant - girls , and ‘

276919	276953	276886	276886	he	220	‘ You hope ! Ay , but your hoping will not undo these chains . I hope , but they do n’t mind that . Grip hopes , but who cares for Grip ? ’

But who cares for Grip ? ’

277731	277795	277720	277721	the man	472	‘ when I spoke to you just now about my father you cried “ Hush ! ” and turned away your head . Why did you do so ? Tell me why , in a word . You thought HE was dead . You are not sorry that he is alive and has come back to us . Where is he ? Here ? ’
277796	277811	277812	277812	she	6600	‘ Do not ask any one where he is , or speak about him , ’
277816	277820	277822	277822	Barnaby	220	‘ Why not ? ’
277824	277860	277822	277822	Barnaby	220	‘ Because he is a stern man , and talks roughly ? Well ! I do n’t like him , or want to be with him by myself ; but why not speak about him ? ’
277861	277906	277720	277721	the man	472	‘ Because I am sorry that he is alive ; sorry that he has come back ; and sorry that he and you have ever met . Because , dear Barnaby , the endeavour of my life has been to keep you two asunder . ’
277907	277915	277998	277998	she	6601	‘ Father and son asunder ! Why ? ’
277916	277920	277921	277921	she	6601	‘ He has , ’
277927	277969	277921	277921	she	6601	‘ he has shed blood . The time has come when you must know it . He has shed the blood of one who loved him well , and trusted him , and never did him wrong in word or deed . ’
277994	277997	277998	277998	she	6601	‘ But , ’
278009	278115	278116	278116	She	6603	‘ although we shun him , he is your father , dearest , and I am his wretched wife . They seek his life , and he will lose it . It must not be by our means ; nay , if we could win him back to penitence , we should be bound to love him yet . Do not seem to know him , except as one who fled with you from the jail , and if they question you about him , do not answer them . God be with you through the night , dear boy ! God be with you ! ’
278568	278584	278564	278564	he	453	‘ Am I to live or die ? Do you murder too , or spare ? ’
278585	278592	278593	278593	she	756	‘ My son -- our son , ’
278596	278602	278593	278593	she	756	‘ is in this prison . ’
278603	278610	278611	278611	he	453	‘ What is that to me ? ’
278621	278649	278611	278611	he	453	‘ I know it . He can no more aid me than I can aid him . If you are come to talk of him , begone ! ’
278681	278693	278675	278675	he	453	‘ Am I to live or die ? Do you repent ? ’
278694	278698	278699	278699	she	756	‘ Oh!--do YOU ? ’
278702	278723	278675	278675	he	453	‘ Will you , while time remains ? Do not believe that I could save you , if I dared . ’
278724	278730	278731	278731	he	453	‘ Say if you would , ’
278747	278753	278675	278675	he	453	‘ Say if you would . ’
278754	278762	278675	278675	he	453	‘ Listen to me for one moment , ’
278766	278943	278763	278763	she	756	‘ for but a moment . I am but newly risen from a sick - bed , from which I never hoped to rise again . The best among us think , at such a time , of good intentions half - performed and duties left undone . If I have ever , since that fatal night , omitted to pray for your repentance before death -- if I omitted , even then , anything which might tend to urge it on you when the horror of your crime was fresh -- if , in our later meeting , I yielded to the dread that was upon me , and forgot to fall upon my knees and solemnly adjure you , in the name of him you sent to his account with Heaven , to prepare for the retribution which must come , and which is stealing on you now -- I humbly before you , and in the agony of supplication in which you see me , beseech that you will let me make atonement . ’
278944	278954	278955	278955	he	6618	‘ What is the meaning of your canting words ? ’
278959	278968	278955	278955	he	6618	‘ Speak so that I may understand you . ’
278969	278973	278974	278974	she	6619	‘ I will , ’
278977	279080	278974	278974	she	6619	‘ I desire to . Bear with me for a moment more . The hand of Him who set His curse on murder , is heavy on us now . You can not doubt it . Our son , our innocent boy , on whom His anger fell before his birth , is in this place in peril of his life -- brought here by your guilt ; yes , by that alone , as Heaven sees and knows , for he has been led astray in the darkness of his intellect , and that is the terrible consequence of your crime . ’
279081	279095	279096	279096	he	6620	‘ If you come , woman - like , to load me with reproaches-- ’
279105	279154	279096	279096	he	6620	‘ I do not . I have a different purpose . You must hear it . If not to - night , to - morrow ; if not to - morrow , at another time . You MUST hear it . Husband , escape is hopeless -- impossible . ’
279155	279164	279165	279165	he	6620	‘ You tell me so , do you ? ’
279177	279180	279165	279165	he	6620	‘ You ! ’
279181	279184	279185	279185	she	6621	‘ Yes , ’
279192	279196	279185	279185	she	6621	‘ But why ? ’
279197	279210	279096	279096	he	6620	‘ To make me easy in this jail . To make the time ‘
279232	279249	279185	279185	she	6621	’ he said , grinding his teeth , and smiling at her with a livid face . ‘
279257	279261	279185	279185	she	6621	’ she replied ; ‘
279377	279389	279390	279390	I	0	’ she cried , clasping her hands , and looking upward , ‘
279483	279535	279550	279550	you	6629	’ He fell back and gazed at her while she poured out these words , as though he were for a moment awed by her manner , and knew not what to do . But anger and fear soon got the mastery of him , and he spurned her from him . ‘
279538	279542	279550	279550	you	6629	’ he cried . ‘
279582	279583	279585	279585	him	6632	’ ‘
279592	279600	279585	279585	him	6632	’ she replied , wringing her hands . ‘
279650	279669	279670	279670	I	0	’ She would have urged him gently , even then , but he menaced her with his chain . ‘
279727	279929	279936	279936	he	6635	’ In a paroxysm of wrath , and terror , and the fear of death , he broke from her , and rushed into the darkness of his cell , where he cast himself jangling down upon the stone floor , and smote it with his ironed hands . The man returned to lock the dungeon door , and having done so , carried her away . On that warm , balmy night in June , there were glad faces and light hearts in all quarters of the town , and sleep , banished by the late horrors , was doubly welcomed . On that night , families made merry in their houses , and greeted each other on the common danger they had escaped ; and those who had been denounced , ventured into the streets ; and they who had been plundered , got good shelter . Even the timorous Lord Mayor , who was summoned that night before the Privy Council to answer for his conduct , came back contented ; observing to all his friends that he had got off very well with a reprimand , and repeating with huge satisfaction his memorable defence before the Council , ‘
279945	280133	279936	279936	he	6635	’ On that night , too , more of the scattered remnants of the mob were traced to their lurking - places , and taken ; and in the hospitals , and deep among the ruins they had made , and in the ditches , and fields , many unshrouded wretches lay dead : envied by those who had been active in the disturbances , and who pillowed their doomed heads in the temporary jails . And in the Tower , in a dreary room whose thick stone walls shut out the hum of life , and made a stillness which the records left by former prisoners with those silent witnesses seemed to deepen and intensify ; remorseful for every act that had been done by every man among the cruel crowd ; feeling for the time their guilt his own , and their lives put in peril by himself ; and finding , amidst such reflections , little comfort in fanaticism , or in his fancied call ; sat the unhappy author of all -- Lord George Gordon . He had been made prisoner that evening . ‘
280144	280167	280135	280135	you	6636	’ he said to the officers , who waited outside with the warrant for his arrest on a charge of High Treason , ‘
280174	280894	280895	280895	Brother	9503	’ which he did without resistance . He was conducted first before the Privy Council , and afterwards to the Horse Guards , and then was taken by way of Westminster Bridge , and back over London Bridge ( for the purpose of avoiding the main streets ) , to the Tower , under the strongest guard ever known to enter its gates with a single prisoner . Of all his forty thousand men , not one remained to bear him company . Friends , dependents , followers,--none were there . His fawning secretary had played the traitor ; and he whose weakness had been goaded and urged on by so many for their own purposes , was desolate and alone . Chapter 74 Mr Dennis , having been made prisoner late in the evening , was removed to a neighbouring round - house for that night , and carried before a justice for examination on the next day , Saturday . The charges against him being numerous and weighty , and it being in particular proved , by the testimony of Gabriel Varden , that he had shown a special desire to take his life , he was committed for trial . Moreover he was honoured with the distinction of being considered a chief among the insurgents , and received from the magistrate ’s lips the complimentary assurance that he was in a position of imminent danger , and would do well to prepare himself for the worst . To say that Mr Dennis ’s modesty was not somewhat startled by these honours , or that he was altogether prepared for so flattering a reception , would be to claim for him a greater amount of stoical philosophy than even he possessed . Indeed this gentleman ’s stoicism was of that not uncommon kind , which enables a man to bear with exemplary fortitude the afflictions of his friends , but renders him , by way of counterpoise , rather selfish and sensitive in respect of any that happen to befall himself . It is therefore no disparagement to the great officer in question to state , without disguise or concealment , that he was at first very much alarmed , and that he betrayed divers emotions of fear , until his reasoning powers came to his relief , and set before him a more hopeful prospect . In proportion as Mr Dennis exercised these intellectual qualities with which he was gifted , in reviewing his best chances of coming off handsomely and with small personal inconvenience , his spirits rose , and his confidence increased . When he remembered the great estimation in which his office was held , and the constant demand for his services ; when he bethought himself , how the Statute Book regarded him as a kind of Universal Medicine applicable to men , women , and children , of every age and variety of criminal constitution ; and how high he stood , in his official capacity , in the favour of the Crown , and both Houses of Parliament , the Mint , the Bank of England , and the Judges of the land ; when he recollected that whatever Ministry was in or out , he remained their peculiar pet and panacea , and that for his sake England stood single and conspicuous among the civilised nations of the earth : when he called these things to mind and dwelt upon them , he felt certain that the national gratitude MUST relieve him from the consequences of his late proceedings , and would certainly restore him to his old place in the happy social system . With these crumbs , or as one may say , with these whole loaves of comfort to regale upon , Mr Dennis took his place among the escort that awaited him , and repaired to jail with a manly indifference . Arriving at Newgate , where some of the ruined cells had been hastily fitted up for the safe keeping of rioters , he was warmly received by the turnkeys , as an unusual and interesting case , which agreeably relieved their monotonous duties . In this spirit , he was fettered with great care , and conveyed into the interior of the prison . ‘
280897	280925	281019	281020	the man	472	’ cried the hangman , as , following an officer , he traversed under these novel circumstances the remains of passages with which he was well acquainted , ‘
280935	280936	280933	280933	anybody	7183	’ ‘
280952	280957	280946	280946	you	9503	’ was the reply . ‘
280963	280974	280946	280946	you	9503	’re cramped for room , and you ’ll have company . ’
280975	280978	280980	280980	Dennis	187	‘ Well , ’
280982	281006	280980	280980	Dennis	187	‘ I do n’t object to company , brother . I rather like company . I was formed for society , I was . ’
281007	281017	281019	281020	the man	472	‘ That ’s rather a pity , an’t it ? ’
281022	281025	281027	281027	Dennis	187	‘ No , ’
281029	281031	281027	281027	Dennis	187	‘ I ’m
281047	281048	281045	281045	brother	9503	’ ‘
281056	281062	281051	281051	I	0	’ said the man carelessly . ‘
281086	281087	281088	281088	I	0	’ ‘
281091	281097	281088	281088	I	0	’ interposed the other quickly , ‘
281120	281121	281124	281125	nobody particular	6644	’ ‘
281134	281182	281129	281129	you	9503	’ said the man . Mr Dennis wiped his face , which had suddenly grown very hot , and remarking in a tremulous voice to his conductor that he had always been fond of his joke , followed him in silence until he stopped at a door . ‘
281191	281196	281129	281129	you	9503	’ he asked facetiously . ‘
281204	281231	281129	281129	you	9503	’ replied his friend . He was walking in , but not with the best possible grace , when he suddenly stopped , and started back . ‘
281234	281239	281240	281240	You	236	’ said the officer . ‘
281241	281244	281250	281250	Dennis	187	’re nervous . ’
281245	281248	281250	281250	Dennis	187	‘ Nervous ! ’
281255	281265	281250	281250	Dennis	187	‘ Well I may be . Shut the door . ’
281266	281272	281250	281250	Dennis	187	‘ I will , when you ’re
281275	281280	281250	281250	Dennis	187	’ returned the man . ‘
281289	281293	281282	281282	I	0	’ whispered Dennis . ‘
281314	281476	281305	281305	you	236	’ The officer seemed to entertain no particular desire on the subject one way or other , but briefly remarking that he had his orders , and intended to obey them , pushed him in , turned the key , and retired . Dennis stood trembling with his back against the door , and involuntarily raising his arm to defend himself , stared at a man , the only other tenant of the cell , who lay , stretched at his full length , upon a stone bench , and who paused in his deep breathing as if he were about to wake . But he rolled over on one side , let his arm fall negligently down , drew a long sigh , and murmuring indistinctly , fell fast asleep again . Relieved in some degree by this , the hangman took his eyes for an instant from the slumbering figure , and glanced round the cell in search of some ‘
281843	281852	281854	281854	Dennis	187	‘ Keep off , brother , keep off ! ’
281861	281870	281854	281854	Dennis	187	‘ Do n’t do me a mischief . I ’m
281887	281898	281899	281899	He	0	’m quite an old man . Do n’t hurt me ! ’
281939	281948	281950	281950	Dennis	187	‘ I ’ll get up certainly , brother , ’
281963	281974	281950	281950	Dennis	187	‘ I ’ll comply with any request of yours , I ’m
282001	282002	281996	281996	I	0	’ ‘
282010	282039	282005	282005	you	0	’ cried Hugh , clutching him by the collar with both hands , and shaking him as though he were bent on stopping his breath by that means . ‘
282047	282048	282042	282042	you	0	’ ‘
282059	282100	282042	282042	you	0	’ returned the hangman . Hugh made him no answer , but shaking him in his strong grip until his teeth chattered in his head , cast him down upon the floor , and flung himself on the bench again . ‘
282118	282122	282123	282123	I	0	’ he muttered , ‘
282135	282163	282164	282164	I	0	’ It was some time before Dennis had breath enough to speak , but as soon as he could resume his propitiatory strain , he did so . ‘
282175	282179	282180	282180	I	0	’ he whined ; ‘
282238	282239	282236	282236	you	9503	’ ‘
282248	282272	282236	282236	you	9503	’ asked Hugh , raising his head , with such a fierce expression , that the other durst not answer him just then . ‘
282277	282286	282236	282236	you	9503	’ said Dennis meekly , after a pause . ‘
282300	282393	282405	282405	he	0	’re five hundred strong . We may get off scot - free . Unlikelier things than that have come to pass . Even if we should n’t , and the chances fail , we can but be worked off once : and when it ’s well done , it ’s so neat , so skilful , so captiwating , if that do n’t seem too strong a word , that you ’d hardly believe it could be brought to sich perfection . Kill one ’s fellow - creeturs off , with muskets!--Pah ! ’
282506	282513	282515	282516	the hangman	3437	‘ The fact is , brother , ’
282525	282575	282515	282516	the hangman	3437	‘ that you got into bad company . The man that was with you was looked after more than you , and it was him I wanted . As to me , what have I got by it ? Here we are , in one and the same plight . ’
282576	282581	282583	282583	Hugh	198	‘ Lookee , rascal , ’
282589	282591	282586	282586	his	198	‘ I ’m
282624	282746	282761	282761	he	0	’re here , and it will soon be all over with you and me ; and I ’d as soon die as live , or live as die . Why should I trouble myself to have revenge on you ? To eat , and drink , and go to sleep , as long as I stay here , is all I care for . If there was but a little more sun to bask in , than can find its way into this cursed place , I ’d lie in it all day , and not trouble myself to sit or stand up once . That ’s all the care I have for myself . Why should I care for YOU ? ’
282829	282841	282842	282842	he	187	‘ Well said , brother ; nothing could be better said , ’
282847	282884	282842	282842	he	187	‘ We ’ll eat and drink of the best , and sleep our best , and make the best of it every way . Anything can be got for money . Let ’s spend it merrily . ’
282885	282888	282890	282890	Hugh	198	‘ Ay , ’
282901	282902	282842	282842	he	187	’ ‘
282914	282919	282905	282905	they	6664	’ said Mr Dennis ; ‘
282927	282928	282905	282905	they	6664	’ ‘
282937	282938	282932	282932	They	6664	’ ‘
282949	282953	282942	282942	I	0	’ Dennis began . ‘
282960	282961	282962	282963	My friends	8062	’ ‘
282965	282977	282962	282963	My friends	8062	’ cried Hugh , starting up and resting on his hands . ‘
282983	282984	282985	282985	Your	198	’ ‘
282989	282993	282985	282985	Your	198	’ said Dennis . ‘
282998	283009	283010	283010	He	198	’ laughed Hugh , waving one arm above his head . ‘
283059	283060	283052	283052	He	198	’ ‘
283063	283075	283076	283076	you	416	’ cried the hangman , whose features underwent a sudden change , ‘
283082	283083	283084	283084	I	0	’ ‘
283089	283093	283084	283084	I	0	’ Hugh interposed , ‘
283140	283145	283139	283139	I	0	’m going to sleep . ’
283146	283163	283165	283165	Dennis	187	‘ But I want to speak to you ; I want to hear more about that , ’
283170	283173	283174	283176	a wise man	7663	‘ If you ’re
283178	283193	283174	283176	a wise man	7663	’ growled Hugh , raising his head to look at him with a frown , ‘
283204	283209	283210	283210	Dennis	187	’m going to sleep . ’
283614	283682	283575	283575	He	342	‘ And my friend the centaur , goes the way of his mamma ! I am not surprised . And his mysterious friend Mr Dennis , likewise ! I am not surprised . And my old postman , the exceedingly free - and - easy young madman of Chigwell ! I am quite rejoiced . It ’s the very best thing that could possibly happen to him . ’
283747	283756	283729	283729	he	342	‘ I am obliged to you , Peak , ’

283777	283936	283768	283768	he	342	‘ that my friend the madman should have been within an ace of escaping , on his trial ; and it was a good stroke of chance ( or , as the world would say , a providential occurrence ) that the brother of my Lord Mayor should have been in court , with other country justices , into whose very dense heads curiosity had penetrated . For though the brother of my Lord Mayor was decidedly wrong ; and established his near relationship to that amusing person beyond all doubt , in stating that my friend was sane , and had , to his knowledge , wandered about the country with a vagabond parent , avowing revolutionary and rebellious sentiments ; I am not the less obliged to him for volunteering that evidence . These insane creatures make such very odd and embarrassing remarks , that they really ought to be hanged for the comfort of society . ’
283971	283979	283981	283982	Sir John	342	‘ They will be a singular party , ’
283996	284023	283985	283985	his	342	‘ a very curious party . The hangman himself ; the centaur ; and the madman . The centaur would make a very handsome preparation in Surgeons ’
284057	284114	284054	284055	the hairdresser	6693	’ This reminder to his servant was called forth by a knock at the door , which the man hastened to open . After a prolonged murmur of question and answer , he returned ; and as he cautiously closed the room - door behind him , a man was heard to cough in the passage . ‘
284125	284141	284123	284123	Peak	294	’ said Sir John , raising his hand in deprecation of his delivering any message ; ‘
284179	284240	284242	284242	him	294	’ Having nothing to oppose to this reproof , the man was about to withdraw , when the visitor who had given occasion to it , probably rendered impatient by delay , knocked with his knuckles at the chamber - door , and called out that he had urgent business with Sir John Chester , which admitted of no delay . ‘
284245	284250	284242	284242	him	294	’ said Sir John . ‘
284255	284265	284242	284242	him	294	’ he added , when the door was opened , ‘

284368	284392	284364	284364	we	6698	’ returned Sir John , whose face cleared up when he saw who it was , and whose prepossessing smile was now restored . ‘
284401	284409	284364	284364	we	6698	’ he added in his winning tone , ‘

284605	284620	284573	284574	Sir John	342	’ he added , with a glance at the man who stood looking on , ‘

284706	284710	284703	284704	Sir John	342	’ said Gabriel , ‘

284816	284827	284813	284814	Mr Varden	214	’ returned the other , perfectly composed under this exordium ; ‘
284856	284857	284858	284859	Sir John	342	’ ‘
284861	284885	284858	284859	Sir John	342	’ said Gabriel , who had acknowledged with a bow the invitation to be seated , but had not availed himself of it . ‘

284908	284919	284905	284906	Good Gad	418	’ cried Sir John , hastily sitting up in bed ; ‘
284993	285089	285090	285090	You	214	’ Gabriel returned no answer , but looked on in silence while Peak ( who had entered with the hot chocolate ) ran to a drawer , and returning with a bottle , sprinkled his master ’s dressing - gown and the bedding ; and besides moistening the locksmith himself , plentifully , described a circle round about him on the carpet . When he had done this , he again retired ; and Sir John , reclining in an easy attitude upon his pillow , once more turned a smiling face towards his visitor . ‘
285148	285155	285163	285164	Mr Varden	214	’ The locksmith inclined his head . ‘
285172	285186	285163	285164	Mr Varden	214	’ said Sir John Chester , confidentially , as he sipped his chocolate , ‘

285203	285208	285200	285201	Sir John	342	’ returned the locksmith , ‘

285289	285303	285269	285270	Sir John	342	’ said Sir John , setting down his cup , and laughing,--‘by whom ? ’
285304	285325	285327	285328	the locksmith	7447	‘ By a man called Dennis -- for many years the hangman , and to - morrow morning the hanged , ’
285411	285465	285396	285396	He	342	‘ And what does the gentleman require of me ? My memory may be at fault again , but I do n’t recollect that I ever had the pleasure of an introduction to him , or that I ever numbered him among my personal friends , I do assure you , Mr Varden . ’
285466	285470	285472	285473	the locksmith	7447	‘ Sir John , ’
285477	285519	285472	285473	the locksmith	7447	‘ I will tell you , as nearly as I can , in the words he used to me , what he desires that you should know , and what you ought to know without a moment ’s loss of time . ’
285547	285560	285524	285524	himself	342	‘ This is an amusing fellow ! I ’ll hear him out . ’
285561	285572	285574	285574	Gabriel	212	‘ You may have seen in the newspapers , sir , ’
285586	285622	285574	285574	Gabriel	212	‘ that I was a witness against this man upon his trial some days since ; and that it was not his fault I was alive , and able to speak to what I knew . ’
285623	285628	285630	285631	Sir John	342	‘ MAY have seen ! ’
285633	285689	285630	285631	Sir John	342	‘ My dear Mr Varden , you are quite a public character , and live in all men ’s thoughts most deservedly . Nothing can exceed the interest with which I read your testimony , and remembered that I had the pleasure of a slight acquaintance with you.---I hope we shall have your portrait published ? ’
285690	285696	285698	285699	the locksmith	7447	‘ This morning , sir , ’
285708	285773	285698	285699	the locksmith	7447	‘ early this morning , a message was brought to me from Newgate , at this man ’s request , desiring that I would go and see him , for he had something particular to communicate . I need n’t tell you that he is no friend of mine , and that I had never seen him , until the rioters beset my house . ’
285786	285797	285799	285799	Gabriel	212	‘ I knew , however , from the general report , ’
285801	285835	285799	285799	Gabriel	212	‘ that the order for his execution to - morrow , went down to the prison last night ; and looking upon him as a dying man , I complied with his request . ’
285836	285846	285848	285849	Sir John	342	‘ You are quite a Christian , Mr Varden , ’
285851	285869	285848	285849	Sir John	342	‘ and in that amiable capacity , you increase my desire that you should take a chair . ’
285870	285874	285876	285876	Gabriel	212	‘ He said , ’
285884	286000	285876	285876	Gabriel	212	‘ that he had sent to me , because he had no friend or companion in the whole world ( being the common hangman ) , and because he believed , from the way in which I had given my evidence , that I was an honest man , and would act truly by him . He said that , being shunned by every one who knew his calling , even by people of the lowest and most wretched grade , and finding , when he joined the rioters , that the men he acted with had no suspicion of it ( which I believe is true enough , for a poor fool of an old ‘
286030	286031	286013	286013	his	6722	’ ‘
286038	286054	286013	286013	his	6722	’ observed Sir John with a slight yawn , though still with the utmost affability , ‘
286078	286079	286059	286059	your	187	’ ‘
286082	286096	286059	286059	your	187	’ pursued the locksmith , quite unabashed and wholly regardless of these interruptions , ‘
286187	286233	286184	286185	Sir John	342	’ The knight laid down his paper fan , replaced his cup upon the table at his side , and , saving for the smile that lurked about his mouth , looked at the locksmith with as much steadiness as the locksmith looked at him . ‘
286384	286426	286382	286383	Sir John--	419	’ It might have been the effect of a passing cloud which obscured the sun , and cast a shadow on his face ; but the knight turned deadly pale . Still he met the locksmith ’s eye , as before . ‘
286436	286440	286427	286427	She	456	’ repeated Gabriel , ‘
286539	286651	286535	286535	she	456	’ Sir John stretched out his hand towards his cup . The locksmith going on , arrested it half - way . --‘Until she had but a minute to live . Then she broke silence , and said , in a low firm voice which no one heard but this executioner , for all other living creatures had retired and left her to her fate , “ If I had a dagger within these fingers and he was within my reach , I would strike him dead before me , even now ! ” The man asked “ Who ? ” She said , “ The father of her boy . ” ’
286684	286854	286663	286664	the locksmith	7447	‘ It was the first word she had ever spoken , from which it could be understood that she had any relative on earth . “ Was the child alive ? ” he asked . “ Yes . ” He asked her where it was , its name , and whether she had any wish respecting it . She had but one , she said . It was that the boy might live and grow , in utter ignorance of his father , so that no arts might teach him to be gentle and forgiving . When he became a man , she trusted to the God of their tribe to bring the father and the son together , and revenge her through her child . He asked her other questions , but she spoke no more . Indeed , he says , she scarcely said this much , to him , but stood with her face turned upwards to the sky , and never looked towards him once . ’
286872	286875	286882	286882	his	342	‘ Nature , ’
286901	286908	286882	286882	his	342	‘ You were observing , Mr Varden-- ’
286909	286914	286916	286917	the locksmith	7447	‘ That she never , ’
286938	287280	286934	286934	his	7447	‘ that she never looked towards him once , Sir John ; and so she died , and he forgot her . But , some years afterwards , a man was sentenced to die the same death , who was a gipsy too ; a sunburnt , swarthy fellow , almost a wild man ; and while he lay in prison , under sentence , he , who had seen the hangman more than once while he was free , cut an image of him on his stick , by way of braving death , and showing those who attended on him , how little he cared or thought about it . He gave this stick into his hands at Tyburn , and told him then , that the woman I have spoken of had left her own people to join a fine gentleman , and that , being deserted by him , and cast off by her old friends , she had sworn within her own proud breast , that whatever her misery might be , she would ask no help of any human being . He told him that she had kept her word to the last ; and that , meeting even him in the streets -- he had been fond of her once , it seems -- she had slipped from him by a trick , and he never saw her again , until , being in one of the frequent crowds at Tyburn , with some of his rough companions , he had been driven almost mad by seeing , in the criminal under another name , whose death he had come to witness , herself . Standing in the same place in which she had stood , he told the hangman this , and told him , too , her real name , which only her own people and the gentleman for whose sake she had left them , knew . That name he will tell again , Sir John , to none but you . ’
287281	287287	287289	287290	the knight	9961	‘ To none but me ! ’
287329	287361	287312	287312	his	9961	‘ but me!--My dear Mr Varden , how very preposterous , to select me for his confidence ! With you at his elbow , too , who are so perfectly trustworthy ! ’
287362	287369	287371	287372	the locksmith	7447	‘ Sir John , Sir John , ’
287374	287460	287371	287372	the locksmith	7447	‘ at twelve tomorrow , these men die . Hear the few words I have to add , and do not hope to deceive me ; for though I am a plain man of humble station , and you are a gentleman of rank and learning , the truth raises me to your level , and I KNOW that you anticipate the disclosure with which I am about to end , and that you believe this doomed man , Hugh , to be your son . ’
287461	287464	287466	287467	Sir John	342	‘ Nay , ’
287476	287496	287466	287467	Sir John	342	‘ the wild gentleman , who died so suddenly , scarcely went as far as that , I think ? ’
287497	287502	287504	287505	the locksmith	7447	‘ He did not , ’
287507	287582	287504	287505	the locksmith	7447	‘ for she had bound him by some pledge , known only to these people , and which the worst among them respect , not to tell your name : but , in a fantastic pattern on the stick , he had carved some letters , and when the hangman asked it , he bade him , especially if he should ever meet with her son in after life , remember that place well . ’
287583	287587	287466	287467	Sir John	342	‘ What place ? ’
287588	287591	287592	287593	The knight	9961	‘ Chester . ’

287624	287702	287621	287622	the locksmith	7447	‘ this is all that has been told to me ; but since these two men have been left for death , they have conferred together closely . See them , and hear what they can add . See this Dennis , and learn from him what he has not trusted to me . If you , who hold the clue to all , want corroboration ( which you do not ) , the means are easy . ’
287703	287708	287710	287712	Sir John Chester	342	‘ And to what , ’
287727	287757	287710	287712	Sir John Chester	342	‘ my dear , good - natured , estimable Mr Varden -- with whom I can not be angry if I would -- to what does all this tend ? ’
287758	287784	287786	287787	the locksmith	7447	‘ I take you for a man , Sir John , and I suppose it tends to some pleading of natural affection in your breast , ’
287789	287906	287786	287787	the locksmith	7447	‘ I suppose to the straining of every nerve , and the exertion of all the influence you have , or can make , in behalf of your miserable son , and the man who has disclosed his existence to you . At the worst , I suppose to your seeing your son , and awakening him to a sense of his crime and danger . He has no such sense now . Think what his life must have been , when he said in my hearing , that if I moved you to anything , it would be to hastening his death , and ensuring his silence , if you had it in your power ! ’
287907	287917	287919	287920	Sir John	342	‘ And have you , my good Mr Varden , ’
287928	287981	287919	287920	Sir John	342	‘ have you really lived to your present age , and remained so very simple and credulous , as to approach a gentleman of established character with such credentials as these , from desperate men in their last extremity , catching at any straw ? Oh dear ! Oh fie , fie ! ’
287994	288035	287990	287990	he	7447	‘ On any other subject , Mr Varden , I shall be delighted -- I shall be charmed -- to converse with you , but I owe it to my own character not to pursue this topic for another moment . ’
288036	288049	288051	288052	the locksmith	7447	‘ Think better of it , sir , when I am gone , ’
288054	288119	288051	288052	the locksmith	7447	‘ think better of it , sir . Although you have , thrice within as many weeks , turned your lawful son , Mr Edward , from your door , you may have time , you may have years to make your peace with HIM , Sir John : but that twelve o’clock will soon be here , and soon be past for ever . ’

Peak , show Mr Varden to the door . ’

This affair would make a noise abroad , if it rested on better evidence ; but , as it is , and by not joining the scattered links of the chain , I can afford to slight it.--Extremely distressing to be the parent of such an uncouth creature ! Still , I gave him very good advice . I told him he would certainly be hanged . I could have done no more if I had known of our relationship ; and there are a great many fathers who have never done as much for THEIR natural children.--The hairdresser may come in , Peak ! ’

291002	293277	293379	293379	D’ye	6830	’ Barnaby glanced once more through the grate into the empty yard ; and then watched Hugh as he strode to the steps leading to his sleeping - cell . He heard him shout , and burst into a roar of laughter , and saw him flourish his hat . Then he turned away himself , like one who walked in his sleep ; and , without any sense of fear or sorrow , lay down on his pallet , listening for the clock to strike again . Chapter 77 The time wore on . The noises in the streets became less frequent by degrees , until silence was scarcely broken save by the bells in church towers , marking the progress -- softer and more stealthy while the city slumbered -- of that Great Watcher with the hoary head , who never sleeps or rests . In the brief interval of darkness and repose which feverish towns enjoy , all busy sounds were hushed ; and those who awoke from dreams lay listening in their beds , and longed for dawn , and wished the dead of the night were past . Into the street outside the jail ’s main wall , workmen came straggling at this solemn hour , in groups of two or three , and meeting in the centre , cast their tools upon the ground and spoke in whispers . Others soon issued from the jail itself , bearing on their shoulders planks and beams : these materials being all brought forth , the rest bestirred themselves , and the dull sound of hammers began to echo through the stillness . Here and there among this knot of labourers , one , with a lantern or a smoky link , stood by to light his fellows at their work ; and by its doubtful aid , some might be dimly seen taking up the pavement of the road , while others held great upright posts , or fixed them in the holes thus made for their reception . Some dragged slowly on , towards the rest , an empty cart , which they brought rumbling from the prison - yard ; while others erected strong barriers across the street . All were busily engaged . Their dusky figures moving to and fro , at that unusual hour , so active and so silent , might have been taken for those of shadowy creatures toiling at midnight on some ghostly unsubstantial work , which , like themselves , would vanish with the first gleam of day , and leave but morning mist and vapour . While it was yet dark , a few lookers - on collected , who had plainly come there for the purpose and intended to remain : even those who had to pass the spot on their way to some other place , lingered , and lingered yet , as though the attraction of that were irresistible . Meanwhile the noise of saw and mallet went on briskly , mingled with the clattering of boards on the stone pavement of the road , and sometimes with the workmen ’s voices as they called to one another . Whenever the chimes of the neighbouring church were heard -- and that was every quarter of an hour -- a strange sensation , instantaneous and indescribable , but perfectly obvious , seemed to pervade them all . Gradually , a faint brightness appeared in the east , and the air , which had been very warm all through the night , felt cool and chilly . Though there was no daylight yet , the darkness was diminished , and the stars looked pale . The prison , which had been a mere black mass with little shape or form , put on its usual aspect ; and ever and anon a solitary watchman could be seen upon its roof , stopping to look down upon the preparations in the street . This man , from forming , as it were , a part of the jail , and knowing or being supposed to know all that was passing within , became an object of as much interest , and was as eagerly looked for , and as awfully pointed out , as if he had been a spirit . By and by , the feeble light grew stronger , and the houses with their signboards and inscriptions , stood plainly out , in the dull grey morning . Heavy stage waggons crawled from the inn - yard opposite ; and travellers peeped out ; and as they rolled sluggishly away , cast many a backward look towards the jail . And now , the sun ’s first beams came glancing into the street ; and the night ’s work , which , in its various stages and in the varied fancies of the lookers - on had taken a hundred shapes , wore its own proper form -- a scaffold , and a gibbet . As the warmth of the cheerful day began to shed itself upon the scanty crowd , the murmur of tongues was heard , shutters were thrown open , and blinds drawn up , and those who had slept in rooms over against the prison , where places to see the execution were let at high prices , rose hastily from their beds . In some of the houses , people were busy taking out the window - sashes for the better accommodation of spectators ; in others , the spectators were already seated , and beguiling the time with cards , or drink , or jokes among themselves . Some had purchased seats upon the house - tops , and were already crawling to their stations from parapet and garret - window . Some were yet bargaining for good places , and stood in them in a state of indecision : gazing at the slowly - swelling crowd , and at the workmen as they rested listlessly against the scaffold -- affecting to listen with indifference to the proprietor ’s eulogy of the commanding view his house afforded , and the surpassing cheapness of his terms . A fairer morning never shone . From the roofs and upper stories of these buildings , the spires of city churches and the great cathedral dome were visible , rising up beyond the prison , into the blue sky , and clad in the colour of light summer clouds , and showing in the clear atmosphere their every scrap of tracery and fretwork , and every niche and loophole . All was brightness and promise , excepting in the street below , into which ( for it yet lay in shadow ) the eye looked down as into a dark trench , where , in the midst of so much life , and hope , and renewal of existence , stood the terrible instrument of death . It seemed as if the very sun forbore to look upon it . But it was better , grim and sombre in the shade , than when , the day being more advanced , it stood confessed in the full glare and glory of the sun , with its black paint blistering , and its nooses dangling in the light like loathsome garlands . It was better in the solitude and gloom of midnight with a few forms clustering about it , than in the freshness and the stir of morning : the centre of an eager crowd . It was better haunting the street like a spectre , when men were in their beds , and influencing perchance the city ’s dreams , than braving the broad day , and thrusting its obscene presence upon their waking senses . Five o’clock had struck -- six -- seven -- and eight . Along the two main streets at either end of the cross - way , a living stream had now set in , rolling towards the marts of gain and business . Carts , coaches , waggons , trucks , and barrows , forced a passage through the outskirts of the throng , and clattered onward in the same direction . Some of these which were public conveyances and had come from a short distance in the country , stopped ; and the driver pointed to the gibbet with his whip , though he might have spared himself the pains , for the heads of all the passengers were turned that way without his help , and the coach - windows were stuck full of staring eyes . In some of the carts and waggons , women might be seen , glancing fearfully at the same unsightly thing ; and even little children were held up above the people ’s heads to see what kind of a toy a gallows was , and learn how men were hanged . Two rioters were to die before the prison , who had been concerned in the attack upon it ; and one directly afterwards in Bloomsbury Square . At nine o’clock , a strong body of military marched into the street , and formed and lined a narrow passage into Holborn , which had been indifferently kept all night by constables . Through this , another cart was brought ( the one already mentioned had been employed in the construction of the scaffold ) , and wheeled up to the prison - gate . These preparations made , the soldiers stood at ease ; the officers lounged to and fro , in the alley they had made , or talked together at the scaffold ’s foot ; and the concourse , which had been rapidly augmenting for some hours , and still received additions every minute , waited with an impatience which increased with every chime of St Sepulchre ’s clock , for twelve at noon . Up to this time they had been very quiet , comparatively silent , save when the arrival of some new party at a window , hitherto unoccupied , gave them something new to look at or to talk of . But , as the hour approached , a buzz and hum arose , which , deepening every moment , soon swelled into a roar , and seemed to fill the air . No words or even voices could be distinguished in this clamour , nor did they speak much to each other ; though such as were better informed upon the topic than the rest , would tell their neighbours , perhaps , that they might know the hangman when he came out , by his being the shorter one : and that the man who was to suffer with him was named Hugh : and that it was Barnaby Rudge who would be hanged in Bloomsbury Square . The hum grew , as the time drew near , so loud , that those who were at the windows could not hear the church - clock strike , though it was close at hand . Nor had they any need to hear it , either , for they could see it in the people ’s faces . So surely as another quarter chimed , there was a movement in the crowd -- as if something had passed over it -- as if the light upon them had been changed -- in which the fact was readable as on a brazen dial , figured by a giant ’s hand . Three quarters past eleven ! The murmur now was deafening , yet every man seemed mute . Look where you would among the crowd , you saw strained eyes and lips compressed ; it would have been difficult for the most vigilant observer to point this way or that , and say that yonder man had cried out . It were as easy to detect the motion of lips in a sea - shell . Three quarters past eleven ! Many spectators who had retired from the windows , came back refreshed , as though their watch had just begun . Those who had fallen asleep , roused themselves ; and every person in the crowd made one last effort to better his position -- which caused a press against the sturdy barriers that made them bend and yield like twigs . The officers , who until now had kept together , fell into their several positions , and gave the words of command . Swords were drawn , muskets shouldered , and the bright steel winding its way among the crowd , gleamed and glittered in the sun like a river . Along this shining path , two men came hurrying on , leading a horse , which was speedily harnessed to the cart at the prison - door . Then , a profound silence replaced the tumult that had so long been gathering , and a breathless pause ensued . Every window was now choked up with heads ; the house - tops teemed with people -- clinging to chimneys , peering over gable - ends , and holding on where the sudden loosening of any brick or stone would dash them down into the street . The church tower , the church roof , the church yard , the prison leads , the very water - spouts and lampposts -- every inch of room -- swarmed with human life . At the first stroke of twelve the prison - bell began to toll . Then the roar -- mingled now with cries of ‘
293281	293283	293379	293379	D’ye	6830	’ and ‘
293287	293378	293379	293379	D’ye	6830	’ and , from some specks in the great concourse , with a shriek or groan -- burst forth again . It was terrible to see -- if any one in that distraction of excitement could have seen -- the world of eager eyes , all strained upon the scaffold and the beam . The hollow murmuring was heard within the jail as plainly as without . The three were brought forth into the yard , together , as it resounded through the air . They knew its import well . ‘
293382	293391	293379	293379	D’ye	6830	’ cried Hugh , undaunted by the sound . ‘
293441	293465	293469	293469	master	7428	’ The Ordinary coming up at this moment , reproved him for his indecent mirth , and advised him to alter his demeanour . ‘
293471	293475	293469	293469	master	7428	’ said Hugh . ‘
293497	293508	293495	293495	me	0	’ he cried , as the other would have spoken , ‘
293529	293602	293526	293526	They	6831	’re the best maker of lobster salads in London . Ha , ha ! I ’ve heard that , you see , before now . Is it a good one , this morning -- is your hand in ? How does the breakfast look ? I hope there ’s enough , and to spare , for all this hungry company that ’ll sit down to it , when the sight ’s over . ’
293603	293607	293609	293610	the clergyman	9456	‘ I fear , ’
293616	293622	293613	293613	his	9456	‘ that you are incorrigible . ’
293623	293625	293613	293613	his	9456	‘ You ’re
293631	293636	293628	293628	I	0	’ rejoined Hugh sternly . ‘
293682	293740	293677	293677	your	7428	’ He pointed , as he spoke , to Dennis , who , with his legs trailing on the ground , was held between two men ; and who trembled so , that all his joints and limbs seemed racked by spasms . Turning from this wretched spectacle , he called to Barnaby , who stood apart . ‘
293758	293759	293756	293756	HIM	6838	’ ‘
293763	293772	293761	293761	you	7428	’ cried Barnaby , stepping lightly towards him , ‘
293774	293781	293756	293756	HIM	6838	’m not frightened , Hugh . I ’m
293815	293858	293810	293810	they	6840	’ Hugh gazed for a moment at his face , on which there was a strange , unearthly smile ; and at his eye , which sparkled brightly ; and interposing between him and the Ordinary , gruffly whispered to the latter : ‘
293889	294334	294335	294335	Gentlemen	1335	’ He was the only one of the three who had washed or trimmed himself that morning . Neither of the others had done so , since their doom was pronounced . He still wore the broken peacock ’s feathers in his hat ; and all his usual scraps of finery were carefully disposed about his person . His kindling eye , his firm step , his proud and resolute bearing , might have graced some lofty act of heroism ; some voluntary sacrifice , born of a noble cause and pure enthusiasm ; rather than that felon ’s death . But all these things increased his guilt . They were mere assumptions . The law had declared it so , and so it must be . The good minister had been greatly shocked , not a quarter of an hour before , at his parting with Grip . For one in his condition , to fondle a bird!--The yard was filled with people ; bluff civic functionaries , officers of justice , soldiers , the curious in such matters , and guests who had been bidden as to a wedding . Hugh looked about him , nodded gloomily to some person in authority , who indicated with his hand in what direction he was to proceed ; and clapping Barnaby on the shoulder , passed out with the gait of a lion . They entered a large room , so near to the scaffold that the voices of those who stood about it , could be plainly heard : some beseeching the javelin - men to take them out of the crowd : others crying to those behind , to stand back , for they were pressed to death , and suffocating for want of air . In the middle of this chamber , two smiths , with hammers , stood beside an anvil . Hugh walked straight up to them , and set his foot upon it with a sound as though it had been struck by a heavy weapon . Then , with folded arms , he stood to have his irons knocked off : scowling haughtily round , as those who were present eyed him narrowly and whispered to each other . It took so much time to drag Dennis in , that this ceremony was over with Hugh , and nearly over with Barnaby , before he appeared . He no sooner came into the place he knew so well , however , and among faces with which he was so familiar , than he recovered strength and sense enough to clasp his hands and make a last appeal . ‘
294340	294361	294362	294362	Governor	6845	’ cried the abject creature , grovelling down upon his knees , and actually prostrating himself upon the stone floor : ‘
294410	294411	294412	294412	Dennis	187	’ ‘
294414	294422	294423	294423	you	187	’ said the governor of the jail , ‘
294452	294453	294439	294439	You	187	’ ‘
294472	294484	294485	294486	The King	7438	’ cried the trembling wretch , looking wildly round for sympathy . ‘
294497	294572	294573	294573	he	0	’m sure they ca n’t know it ’s me ; or they never would bring me to this dreadful slaughterhouse . They know my name , but they do n’t know it ’s the same man . Stop my execution -- for charity ’s sake stop my execution , gentlemen -- till they can be told that I ’ve been hangman here , nigh thirty year . Will no one go and tell them ? ’
294597	294598	294599	294600	Mr Akerman	395	’ ‘
294602	294616	294599	294600	Mr Akerman	395	’ said a gentleman who stood by , after a moment ’s pause , ‘
294659	294660	294639	294639	me	0	’ ‘
294676	294696	294663	294663	they	6855	’ cried the criminal , shuffling towards this speaker on his knees , and holding up his folded hands ; ‘
294750	294777	294727	294727	They	6855	’ The governor beckoned with his hand , and the two men , who had supported him before , approached . He uttered a piercing cry : ‘
294852	294873	294881	294882	the crowd	7574	’ They took him to the anvil : but even then he could be heard above the clinking of the smiths ’
295030	295034	295035	295035	he	198	‘ To say ! ’
295038	295042	295035	295035	he	198	‘ Not I. I ’m
295045	295056	295057	295057	I	0	’ he added , as his eye fell upon Barnaby , ‘
295071	295102	295069	295069	lad	7665	’ There was , for the moment , something kind , and even tender , struggling in his fierce aspect , as he wrung his poor companion by the hand . ‘
295108	295116	295103	295103	I	0	’ he cried , looking firmly round , ‘
295171	295180	295152	295152	I	0	’ he added , wringing his hand again , ‘
295188	295189	295152	295152	I	0	’ ‘
295194	295201	295152	295152	I	0	’ said the idiot , mildly . ‘
295233	295234	295235	295235	I	0	’ ‘
295256	295274	295275	295275	I	0	’ said Hugh , laying his hand upon his head , and speaking in a lower voice . ‘
295284	295294	295295	295295	You	6873	’ he added roughly , in his former tone . ‘
295300	295303	295295	295295	You	6873	’ They murmured ‘
295306	295315	295316	295317	That gentleman	2209	’ and seemed to wonder why he asked . ‘
295319	295395	295396	295396	Barnaby	220	’ pointing to the clergyman--‘has often in the last few days spoken to me of faith , and strong belief . You see what I am -- more brute than man , as I have been often told -- but I had faith enough to believe , and did believe as strongly as any of you gentlemen can believe anything , that this one life would be spared . See what he is!--Look at him ! ’
295410	295421	295423	295423	Hugh	198	‘ If this was not faith , and strong belief ! ’
295449	295610	295435	295447	a savage prophet whom the near approach of Death had filled with inspiration	6880	‘ where are they ! What else should teach me -- me , born as I was born , and reared as I have been reared -- to hope for any mercy in this hardened , cruel , unrelenting place ! Upon these human shambles , I , who never raised this hand in prayer till now , call down the wrath of God ! On that black tree , of which I am the ripened fruit , I do invoke the curse of all its victims , past , and present , and to come . On the head of that man , who , in his conscience , owns me for his son , I leave the wish that he may never sicken on his bed of down , but die a violent death as I do now , and have the night - wind for his only mourner . To this I say , Amen , amen ! ’
295638	295644	295646	295647	the governor	11836	‘ There is nothing more ? ’
295671	295677	295649	295649	Hugh	198	‘ There is nothing more . ’
295678	295682	295646	295647	the governor	11836	‘ Move forward ! ’
295683	295686	295688	295688	Hugh	198	‘ --Unless , ’
295764	295774	295756	295756	I	0	’ he added , with a kind of laugh . ‘
295792	295980	295985	295988	a guard of soldiers	6889	’ He spoke no more , but moved onward in his place , with a careless air , though listening at the same time to the Service for the Dead , with something between sullen attention , and quickened curiosity . As soon as he had passed the door , his miserable associate was carried out ; and the crowd beheld the rest . Barnaby would have mounted the steps at the same time -- indeed he would have gone before them , but in both attempts he was restrained , as he was to undergo the sentence elsewhere . In a few minutes the sheriffs reappeared , the same procession was again formed , and they passed through various rooms and passages to another door -- that at which the cart was waiting . He held down his head to avoid seeing what he knew his eyes must otherwise encounter , and took his seat sorrowfully,--and yet with something of a childish pride and pleasure,--in the vehicle . The officers fell into their places at the sides , in front and in the rear ; the sheriffs ’

296668	296674	296596	296596	he	194	‘ coming on the parish , ’
296986	296991	296993	296993	Joe	197	‘ Why , father ! ’
297000	297002	296993	296993	Joe	197	‘ you ’re
297009	297010	296993	296993	Joe	197	’ ‘
297016	297024	296993	296993	Joe	197	’ said Mr Willet , chuckling again . ‘
297041	297071	297038	297039	the Salwanners	412	’ Having preferred this request , Mr Willet chuckled a third time , and after these unusual demonstrations of levity , he put his pipe in his mouth again . ‘
297080	297100	297074	297074	I	0	’ asked Joe , laying his hand upon his sire ’s shoulder , and looking down into his face . ‘
297131	297132	297127	297127	You	194	’ ‘
297138	297150	297127	297127	You	194	’ muttered Mr Willet , with his eyes upon the fire , ‘
297166	297167	297127	297127	You	194	’ ‘
297171	297192	297127	297127	You	194	’ returned Joe , smiling , and leaning with his remaining elbow on the back of his father ’s chair ; ‘
297222	297244	297210	297210	father	7315	’ This was one of those vast propositions which Mr Willet had never considered for an instant , and required time to ‘
297247	297254	297210	297210	father	7315	’ Wherefore he made no answer . ‘
297259	297263	297264	297264	he	6930	’ said Joe , ‘
297327	297344	297324	297324	you	194	’ Mr Willet had been softly repeating to himself , in a musing tone , the words ‘
297350	297362	297347	297348	the Salwanners	412	’ but he seemed embarrassed at having been overheard , and answered ‘
297365	297366	297347	297348	the Salwanners	412	’ ‘
297574	297738	297739	297739	Dolly	216	’ In the mind ’s eye of Mr Willet , the West Indies , and indeed all foreign countries , were inhabited by savage nations , who were perpetually burying pipes of peace , flourishing tomahawks , and puncturing strange patterns in their bodies . He no sooner heard this announcement , therefore , than he leaned back in his chair , took his pipe from his lips , and stared at his son with as much dismay as if he already beheld him tied to a stake , and tortured for the entertainment of a lively population . In what form of expression his feelings would have found a vent , it is impossible to say . Nor is it necessary : for , before a syllable occurred to him , Dolly Varden came running into the room , in tears , threw herself on Joe ’s breast without a word of explanation , and clasped her white arms round his neck . ‘
297741	297745	297746	297746	Dolly	216	’ cried Joe . ‘
297748	297749	297746	297746	Dolly	216	’ ‘
297761	297769	297746	297746	Dolly	216	’ exclaimed the locksmith ’s little daughter ; ‘
297799	297800	297801	297801	I	0	’ ‘
297805	297809	297801	297801	I	0	’ said Joe . ‘
297863	297900	297902	297902	you	197	’ He could say nothing to her . Not a syllable . There was an odd sort of eloquence in his one arm , which had crept round her waist : but his lips were mute . ‘
297916	297926	297902	297902	you	197	’ sobbed Dolly , clinging yet closer to him , ‘
297960	297961	297953	297953	I	0	’ ‘
297964	297976	297953	297953	I	0	’ repeated Joe , with a smile which seemed to say , ‘
297985	297986	297979	297985	a pretty figure for that . ’	13098	’ ‘
297991	298010	297979	297985	a pretty figure for that . ’	13098	’ she cried , with her whole heart and soul in her earnest voice , and gushing tears ; ‘
298070	298080	298057	298057	I	0	’ Did ever lover look as Joe looked now ! ‘
298084	298088	298081	298082	Dear Joe	423	’ said Dolly , ‘
298160	298188	298142	298142	I	0	’ The eloquence of Joe ’s arm surpassed the most impassioned language ; and so did that of his lips -- yet he said nothing , either . ‘
298195	298207	298142	298142	I	0	’ cried Dolly , trembling with the fervour of her speech , ‘
298280	298281	298272	298272	you	423	’ ‘
298287	298291	298272	298272	you	423	’ cried Joe , ‘
298302	298303	298304	298304	You	423	’ ‘
298309	298320	298304	298304	You	423	’ said Dolly , raising her pretty face to his , ‘
298442	298460	298439	298439	I	0	’ Joe could only repeat his former eloquence -- but it was very much to the purpose . ‘
298469	298473	298461	298461	They	6954	’ said Dolly . ‘
298534	298734	298529	298529	you	423	’ Well , well ! It do n’t matter what Joe said in answer , but he said a great deal ; and Dolly said a great deal too : and he folded Dolly in his one arm pretty tight , considering that it was but one ; and Dolly made no resistance : and if ever two people were happy in this world -- which is not an utterly miserable one , with all its faults -- we may , with some appearance of certainty , conclude that they were . To say that during these proceedings Mr Willet the elder underwent the greatest emotions of astonishment of which our common nature is susceptible -- to say that he was in a perfect paralysis of surprise , and that he wandered into the most stupendous and theretofore unattainable heights of complicated amazement -- would be to shadow forth his state of mind in the feeblest and lamest terms . If a roc , an eagle , a griffin , a flying elephant , a winged sea - horse , had suddenly appeared , and , taking him on its back , carried him bodily into the heart of the ‘
298737	298864	298865	298865	Father	211	’ it would have been to him as an everyday occurrence , in comparison with what he now beheld . To be sitting quietly by , seeing and hearing these things ; to be completely overlooked , unnoticed , and disregarded , while his son and a young lady were talking to each other in the most impassioned manner , kissing each other , and making themselves in all respects perfectly at home ; was a position so tremendous , so inexplicable , so utterly beyond the widest range of his capacity of comprehension , that he fell into a lethargy of wonder , and could no more rouse himself than an enchanted sleeper in the first year of his fairy lease , a century long . ‘
298867	298874	298875	298875	You	211	’ said Joe , presenting Dolly . ‘
298881	298921	298875	298875	You	211	’ Mr Willet looked first at her , then at his son , then back again at Dolly , and then made an ineffectual effort to extract a whiff from his pipe , which had gone out long ago . ‘
298938	298942	298926	298926	father	7315	’ urged Joe . ‘
298947	298952	298945	298945	Joseph	197	’ answered Mr Willet . ‘
298959	298960	298945	298945	Joseph	197	’ ‘
298965	298969	298945	298945	Joseph	197	’ said Joe . ‘
298973	298974	298945	298945	Joseph	197	’ ‘
298977	298982	298945	298945	Joseph	197	’ replied his father . ‘
298986	299148	299151	299151	Joseph	197	’ and with this remark , which he uttered in a low voice as though he were discussing some grave question with himself , he used the little finger -- if any of his fingers can be said to have come under that denomination -- of his right hand as a tobacco - stopper , and was silent again . And so he sat for half an hour at least , although Dolly , in the most endearing of manners , hoped , a dozen times , that he was not angry with her . So he sat for half an hour , quite motionless , and looking all the while like nothing so much as a great Dutch Pin or Skittle . At the expiration of that period , he suddenly , and without the least notice , burst ( to the great consternation of the young people ) into a very loud and very short laugh ; and repeating , ‘
299159	299571	299572	299572	Varden	219	’ went out for a walk . Chapter 79 Old John did not walk near the Golden Key , for between the Golden Key and the Black Lion there lay a wilderness of streets -- as everybody knows who is acquainted with the relative bearings of Clerkenwell and Whitechapel -- and he was by no means famous for pedestrian exercises . But the Golden Key lies in our way , though it was out of his ; so to the Golden Key this chapter goes . The Golden Key itself , fair emblem of the locksmith ’s trade , had been pulled down by the rioters , and roughly trampled under foot . But , now , it was hoisted up again in all the glory of a new coat of paint , and showed more bravely even than in days of yore . Indeed the whole house - front was spruce and trim , and so freshened up throughout , that if there yet remained at large any of the rioters who had been concerned in the attack upon it , the sight of the old , goodly , prosperous dwelling , so revived , must have been to them as gall and wormwood . The shutters of the shop were closed , however , and the window - blinds above were all pulled down , and in place of its usual cheerful appearance , the house had a look of sadness and an air of mourning ; which the neighbours , who in old days had often seen poor Barnaby go in and out , were at no loss to understand . The door stood partly open ; but the locksmith ’s hammer was unheard ; the cat sat moping on the ashy forge ; all was deserted , dark , and silent . On the threshold of this door , Mr Haredale and Edward Chester met . The younger man gave place ; and both passing in with a familiar air , which seemed to denote that they were tarrying there , or were well - accustomed to go to and fro unquestioned , shut it behind them . Entering the old back - parlour , and ascending the flight of stairs , abrupt and steep , and quaintly fashioned as of old , they turned into the best room ; the pride of Mrs Varden ’s heart , and erst the scene of Miggs ’s household labours . ‘
299584	299589	299580	299580	he	6962	’ said Mr Haredale . ‘
299603	299607	299590	299590	She	9454	’ Edward rejoined . ‘

299671	299672	299673	299673	He	6962	’ ‘

299745	299746	299747	299756	The cheeriest , stoutest - hearted fellow in the world	6970	’ ‘
299758	299759	299747	299756	The cheeriest , stoutest - hearted fellow in the world	6970	’ ‘
299790	299791	299780	299780	He	6962	’ ‘
299798	299808	299795	299796	all men	823	’ said Edward , after a moment ’s hesitation , ‘
299817	299818	299795	299796	all men	823	’ ‘
299824	299829	299795	299796	all men	823	’ returned Mr Haredale . ‘
299847	299882	299841	299841	You	0	’ In truth his pale and haggard face , and gloomy bearing , had so far influenced the remark , that Edward was , for the moment , at a loss to answer him . ‘
299887	299892	299841	299841	You	0	’ said Mr Haredale , ‘
299893	299991	299992	299992	Edward	228	’ twas not very difficult to read a thought so natural . But you are mistaken nevertheless . I have had my share of sorrows -- more than the common lot , perhaps , but I have borne them ill . I have broken where I should have bent ; and have mused and brooded , when my spirit should have mixed with all God ’s great creation . The men who learn endurance , are they who call the whole world , brother . I have turned FROM the world , and I pay the penalty . ’
300006	300122	299998	299998	he	228	‘ It is too late to evade it now . I sometimes think , that if I had to live my life once more , I might amend this fault -- not so much , I discover when I search my mind , for the love of what is right , as for my own sake . But even when I make these better resolutions , I instinctively recoil from the idea of suffering again what I have undergone ; and in this circumstance I find the unwelcome assurance that I should still be the same man , though I could cancel the past , and begin anew , with its experience to guide me . ’
300123	300133	300135	300135	Edward	228	‘ Nay , you make too sure of that , ’
300137	300142	300135	300135	Edward	228	‘ You think so , ’
300147	300208	300143	300144	Mr Haredale	206	‘ and I am glad you do . I know myself better , and therefore distrust myself more . Let us leave this subject for another -- not so far removed from it as it might , at first sight , seem to be . Sir , you still love my niece , and she is still attached to you . ’
300209	300219	300221	300221	Edward	228	‘ I have that assurance from her own lips , ’
300223	300248	300221	300221	Edward	228	‘ and you know -- I am sure you know -- that I would not exchange it for any blessing life could yield me . ’
300249	300259	300261	300262	Mr Haredale	206	‘ You are frank , honourable , and disinterested , ’
300264	300295	300296	300296	He	206	‘ you have forced the conviction that you are so , even on my once - jaundiced mind , and I believe you . Wait here till I come back . ’
300311	300319	300320	300320	he	206	‘ On that first and only time , ’
300331	300357	300320	300320	he	206	‘ when we three stood together under her father ’s roof , I told you to quit it , and charged you never to return . ’
300358	300370	300372	300372	Edward	228	‘ It is the only circumstance arising out of our love , ’
300374	300380	300372	300372	Edward	228	‘ that I have forgotten . ’
300381	300387	300389	300390	Mr Haredale	206	‘ You own a name , ’
300392	300488	300389	300390	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I had deep reason to remember . I was moved and goaded by recollections of personal wrong and injury , I know , but , even now I can not charge myself with having , then , or ever , lost sight of a heartfelt desire for her true happiness ; or with having acted -- however much I was mistaken -- with any other impulse than the one pure , single , earnest wish to be to her , as far as in my inferior nature lay , the father she had lost . ’
300489	300493	300495	300495	Emma	261	‘ Dear uncle , ’
300497	300551	300495	300495	Emma	261	‘ I have known no parent but you . I have loved the memory of others , but I have loved you all my life . Never was father kinder to his child than you have been to me , without the interval of one harsh hour , since I can first remember . ’
300552	300558	300559	300559	he	6978	‘ You speak too fondly , ’
300562	300651	300652	300652	He	6978	‘ and yet I can not wish you were less partial ; for I have a pleasure in hearing those words , and shall have in calling them to mind when we are far asunder , which nothing else could give me . Bear with me for a moment longer , Edward , for she and I have been together many years ; and although I believe that in resigning her to you I put the seal upon her future happiness , I find it needs an effort . ’
300669	300741	300652	300652	He	6978	‘ I have done you wrong , sir , and I ask your forgiveness -- in no common phrase , or show of sorrow ; but with earnestness and sincerity . In the same spirit , I acknowledge to you both that the time has been when I connived at treachery and falsehood -- which if I did not perpetrate myself , I still permitted -- to rend you two asunder . ’
300742	300749	300751	300751	Edward	228	‘ You judge yourself too harshly , ’
300753	300759	300652	300652	He	6978	‘ Let these things rest . ’
300760	300780	300781	300781	he	6978	‘ They rise in judgment against me when I look back , and not now for the first time , ’
300784	300824	300781	300781	he	6978	‘ I can not part from you without your full forgiveness ; for busy life and I have little left in common now , and I have regrets enough to carry into solitude , without addition to the stock . ’
300825	300834	300836	300836	Emma	261	‘ You bear a blessing from us both , ’
300838	300874	300836	300836	Emma	261	‘ Never mingle thoughts of me -- of me who owe you so much love and duty -- with anything but undying affection and gratitude for the past , and bright hopes for the future . ’
300875	300879	300881	300882	her uncle	7565	‘ The future , ’
300889	301016	300881	300882	her uncle	7565	‘ is a bright word for you , and its image should be wreathed with cheerful hopes . Mine is of another kind , but it will be one of peace , and free , I trust , from care or passion . When you quit England I shall leave it too . There are cloisters abroad ; and now that the two great objects of my life are set at rest , I know no better home . You droop at that , forgetting that I am growing old , and that my course is nearly run . Well , we will speak of it again -- not once or twice , but many times ; and you shall give me cheerful counsel , Emma . ’
301017	301024	301026	301027	his niece	8254	‘ And you will take it ? ’
301029	301036	301037	301037	he	7565	‘ I ’ll listen to it , ’
301044	301107	301037	301037	he	7565	‘ and it will have its weight , be certain . What have I left to say ? You have , of late , been much together . It is better and more fitting that the circumstances attendant on the past , which wrought your separation , and sowed between you suspicion and distrust , should not be entered on by me . ’
301108	301114	301116	301116	Emma	261	‘ Much , much better , ’
301118	301126	301128	301129	Mr Haredale	206	‘ I avow my share in them , ’
301131	301207	301208	301208	He	7565	‘ though I held it , at the time , in detestation . Let no man turn aside , ever so slightly , from the broad path of honour , on the plausible pretence that he is justified by the goodness of his end . All good ends can be worked out by good means . Those that can not , are bad ; and may be counted so at once , and left alone . ’
301222	301328	301208	301208	He	7565	‘ In goods and fortune you are now nearly equal . I have been her faithful steward , and to that remnant of a richer property which my brother left her , I desire to add , in token of my love , a poor pittance , scarcely worth the mention , for which I have no longer any need . I am glad you go abroad . Let our ill - fated house remain the ruin it is . When you return , after a few thriving years , you will command a better , and a more fortunate one . We are friends ? ’
301340	301351	301353	301354	Mr Haredale	206	‘ You are neither slow nor cold in your response , ’
301362	301439	301440	301440	He	6982	‘ and when I look upon you now , and know you , I feel that I would choose you for her husband . Her father had a generous nature , and you would have pleased him well . I give her to you in his name , and with his blessing . If the world and I part in this act , we part on happier terms than we have lived for many a day . ’
301530	301538	301540	301541	Mr Haredale	206	‘ This must be stopped -- quieted , ’
301545	301566	301540	301541	Mr Haredale	206	‘ We should have foreseen this , and provided against it . I will go out to them at once . ’
301622	301649	301602	301605	the locksmith ’s wife	2131	‘ She knows it all , dear sir!--she knows it all ! We broke it out to her by degrees , and she is quite prepared . ’
302142	302151	302153	302155	the panting locksmith	7008	‘ Such is the blessed end , sir , ’
302161	302184	302153	302155	the panting locksmith	7008	‘ of the best day ’s work we ever did . The rogues ! it ’s been hard fighting to get away from ‘
302207	302468	302469	302469	I	0	’ They had striven , all the previous day , to rescue Barnaby from his impending fate . Failing in their attempts , in the first quarter to which they addressed themselves , they renewed them in another . Failing there , likewise , they began afresh at midnight ; and made their way , not only to the judge and jury who had tried him , but to men of influence at court , to the young Prince of Wales , and even to the ante - chamber of the King himself . Successful , at last , in awakening an interest in his favour , and an inclination to inquire more dispassionately into his case , they had had an interview with the minister , in his bed , so late as eight o’clock that morning . The result of a searching inquiry ( in which they , who had known the poor fellow from his childhood , did other good service , besides bringing it about ) was , that between eleven and twelve o’clock , a free pardon to Barnaby Rudge was made out and signed , and entrusted to a horse - soldier for instant conveyance to the place of execution . This courier reached the spot just as the cart appeared in sight ; and Barnaby being carried back to jail , Mr Haredale , assured that all was safe , had gone straight from Bloomsbury Square to the Golden Key , leaving to Gabriel the grateful task of bringing him home in triumph . ‘
302474	302508	302469	302469	I	0	’ observed the locksmith , when he had shaken hands with all the males in the house , and hugged all the females , five - and - forty times , at least , ‘
302547	302558	302565	302565	I	0	’ he added , as he wiped his crimson face , ‘
302591	303124	303125	303125	You	7016	’ It was plain enough , however , that this was mere talk on Gabriel ’s part , and that the whole proceeding afforded him the keenest delight ; for the people continuing to make a great noise without , and to cheer as if their voices were in the freshest order , and good for a fortnight , he sent upstairs for Grip ( who had come home at his master ’s back , and had acknowledged the favours of the multitude by drawing blood from every finger that came within his reach ) , and with the bird upon his arm presented himself at the first - floor window , and waved his hat again until it dangled by a shred , between his finger and thumb . This demonstration having been received with appropriate shouts , and silence being in some degree restored , he thanked them for their sympathy ; and taking the liberty to inform them that there was a sick person in the house , proposed that they should give three cheers for King George , three more for Old England , and three more for nothing particular , as a closing ceremony . The crowd assenting , substituted Gabriel Varden for the nothing particular ; and giving him one over , for good measure , dispersed in high good - humour . What congratulations were exchanged among the inmates at the Golden Key , when they were left alone ; what an overflowing of joy and happiness there was among them ; how incapable it was of expression in Barnaby ’s own person ; and how he went wildly from one to another , until he became so far tranquillised , as to stretch himself on the ground beside his mother ’s couch and fall into a deep sleep ; are matters that need not be told . And it is well they happened to be of this class , for they would be very hard to tell , were their narration ever so indispensable . Before leaving this bright picture , it may be well to glance at a dark and very different one which was presented to only a few eyes , that same night . The scene was a churchyard ; the time , midnight ; the persons , Edward Chester , a clergyman , a grave - digger , and the four bearers of a homely coffin . They stood about a grave which had been newly dug , and one of the bearers held up a dim lantern,--the only light there -- which shed its feeble ray upon the book of prayer . He placed it for a moment on the coffin , when he and his companions were about to lower it down . There was no inscription on the lid . The mould fell solemnly upon the last house of this nameless man ; and the rattling dust left a dismal echo even in the accustomed ears of those who had borne it to its resting - place . The grave was filled in to the top , and trodden down . They all left the spot together . ‘
303132	303140	303125	303125	You	7016	’ asked the clergyman , of Edward . ‘

Chapter 80 That afternoon , when he had slept off his fatigue ; had shaved , and washed , and dressed , and freshened himself from top to toe ; when he had dined , comforted himself with a pipe , an extra Toby , a nap in the great arm - chair , and a quiet chat with Mrs Varden on everything that had happened , was happening , or about to happen , within the sphere of their domestic concern ; the locksmith sat himself down at the tea - table in the little back - parlour : the rosiest , cosiest , merriest , heartiest , best - contented old buck , in Great Britain or out of it . There he sat , with his beaming eye on Mrs V. , and his shining face suffused with gladness , and his capacious waistcoat smiling in every wrinkle , and his jovial humour peeping from under the table in the very plumpness of his legs ; a sight to turn the vinegar of misanthropy into purest milk of human kindness . There he sat , watching his wife as she decorated the room with flowers for the greater honour of Dolly and Joseph Willet , who had gone out walking , and for whom the tea - kettle had been singing gaily on the hob full twenty minutes , chirping as never kettle chirped before ; for whom the best service of real undoubted china , patterned with divers round - faced mandarins holding up broad umbrellas , was now displayed in all its glory ; to tempt whose appetites a clear , transparent , juicy ham , garnished with cool green lettuce - leaves and fragrant cucumber , reposed upon a shady table , covered with a snow - white cloth ; for whose delight , preserves and jams , crisp cakes and other pastry , short to eat , with cunning twists , and cottage loaves , and rolls of bread both white and brown , were all set forth in rich profusion ; in whose youth Mrs V. herself had grown quite young , and stood there in a gown of red and white : symmetrical in figure , buxom in bodice , ruddy in cheek and lip , faultless in ankle , laughing in face and mood , in all respects delicious to behold -- there sat the locksmith among all and every these delights , the sun that shone upon them all : the centre of the system : the source of light , heat , life , and frank enjoyment in the bright household world . And when had Dolly ever been the Dolly of that afternoon ? To see how she came in , arm - in - arm with Joe ; and how she made an effort not to blush or seem at all confused ; and how she made believe she did n’t care to sit on his side of the table ; and how she coaxed the locksmith in a whisper not to joke ; and how her colour came and went in a little restless flutter of happiness , which made her do everything wrong , and yet so charmingly wrong that it was better than right!--why , the locksmith could have looked on at this ( as he mentioned to Mrs Varden when they retired for the night ) for four - and - twenty hours at a stretch , and never wished it done . The recollections , too , with which they made merry over that long protracted tea ! The glee with which the locksmith asked Joe if he remembered that stormy night at the Maypole when he first asked after Dolly -- the laugh they all had , about that night when she was going out to the party in the sedan - chair -- the unmerciful manner in which they rallied Mrs Varden about putting those flowers outside that very window -- the difficulty Mrs Varden found in joining the laugh against herself , at first , and the extraordinary perception she had of the joke when she overcame it -- the confidential statements of Joe concerning the precise day and hour when he was first conscious of being fond of Dolly , and Dolly ’s blushing admissions , half volunteered and half extorted , as to the time from which she dated the discovery that she ‘
304029	304128	303214	303214	You	0	’ Joe -- here was an exhaustless fund of mirth and conversation . Then , there was a great deal to be said regarding Mrs Varden ’s doubts , and motherly alarms , and shrewd suspicions ; and it appeared that from Mrs Varden ’s penetration and extreme sagacity nothing had ever been hidden . She had known it all along . She had seen it from the first . She had always predicted it . She had been aware of it before the principals . She had said within herself ( for she remembered the exact words ) ‘
304146	304545	304140	304140	I	0	’ Accordingly , she had looked after him , and had observed many little circumstances ( all of which she named ) so exceedingly minute that nobody else could make anything out of them even now ; and had , it seemed from first to last , displayed the most unbounded tact and most consummate generalship . Of course the night when Joe WOULD ride homeward by the side of the chaise , and when Mrs Varden WOULD insist upon his going back again , was not forgotten -- nor the night when Dolly fainted on his name being mentioned -- nor the times upon times when Mrs Varden , ever watchful and prudent , had found her pining in her own chamber . In short , nothing was forgotten ; and everything by some means or other brought them back to the conclusion , that that was the happiest hour in all their lives ; consequently , that everything must have occurred for the best , and nothing could be suggested which would have made it better . While they were in the full glow of such discourse as this , there came a startling knock at the door , opening from the street into the workshop , which had been kept closed all day that the house might be more quiet . Joe , as in duty bound , would hear of nobody but himself going to open it ; and accordingly left the room for that purpose . It would have been odd enough , certainly , if Joe had forgotten the way to this door ; and even if he had , as it was a pretty large one and stood straight before him , he could not easily have missed it . But Dolly , perhaps because she was in the flutter of spirits before mentioned , or perhaps because she thought he would not be able to open it with his one arm -- she could have had no other reason -- hurried out after him ; and they stopped so long in the passage -- no doubt owing to Joe ’s entreaties that she would not expose herself to the draught of July air which must infallibly come rushing in on this same door being opened -- that the knock was repeated , in a yet more startling manner than before . ‘
304554	304559	304547	304547	anybody	7183	’ cried the locksmith . ‘
304565	304602	304562	304562	I	0	’ Upon that , Dolly went running back into the parlour , all dimples and blushes ; and Joe opened it with a mighty noise , and other superfluous demonstrations of being in a violent hurry . ‘
304605	304614	304562	304562	I	0	’ said the locksmith , when he reappeared : ‘
304628	304629	304624	304624	you	197	’ ‘
304639	304640	304624	304624	you	197	’ ‘
304651	304840	304841	304841	Damme	279	’ Mrs Varden , as much at a loss as her husband , could only shake her head in answer to his inquiring look : so , the locksmith wheeled his chair round to command a better view of the room - door , and stared at it with his eyes wide open , and a mingled expression of curiosity and wonder shining in his jolly face . Instead of some person or persons straightway appearing , divers remarkable sounds were heard , first in the workshop and afterwards in the little dark passage between it and the parlour , as though some unwieldy chest or heavy piece of furniture were being brought in , by an amount of human strength inadequate to the task . At length after much struggling and humping , and bruising of the wall on both sides , the door was forced open as by a battering - ram ; and the locksmith , steadily regarding what appeared beyond , smote his thigh , elevated his eyebrows , opened his mouth , and cried in a loud voice expressive of the utmost consternation : ‘
304850	304930	304846	304846	Miggs	239	’ The young damsel whom he named no sooner heard these words , than deserting a small boy and a very large box by which she was accompanied , and advancing with such precipitation that her bonnet flew off her head , burst into the room , clasped her hands ( in which she held a pair of pattens , one in each ) , raised her eyes devotedly to the ceiling , and shed a flood of tears . ‘
304935	304947	304846	304846	Miggs	239	’ cried the locksmith , looking at her in inexpressible desperation . ‘
304965	304966	304967	304968	Ho master	7028	’ ‘
304973	304977	304970	304971	ho mim	7029	’ cried Miggs , ‘
305013	305061	304970	304971	ho mim	7029	’ The locksmith looked from his wife to Dolly , and from Dolly to Joe , and from Joe to Miggs , with his eyebrows still elevated and his mouth still open . When his eyes got back to Miggs , they rested on her ; fascinated . ‘
305065	305072	304970	304971	ho mim	7029	’ cried Miggs with hysterical joy , ‘
305103	305160	305164	305164	her	7031	’ along with him and her , so pleasant and in all respects so affable and mild ; and me not knowing of it , and not being in the ways to make no preparations for their teas . Ho what a cutting thing it is , and yet what sweet sensations is awoke within me ! ’
305203	305234	305179	305179	her	7031	‘ And did my missis think -- ho goodness , did she think -- as her own Miggs , which supported her under so many trials , and understood her natur ’
305338	305717	305329	305329	she	7031	’ To none of these interrogatories , whereof every one was more pathetically delivered than the last , did Mrs Varden answer one word : but Miggs , not at all abashed by this circumstance , turned to the small boy in attendance -- her eldest nephew -- son of her own married sister -- born in Golden Lion Court , number twenty - sivin , and bred in the very shadow of the second bell - handle on the right - hand door - post -- and with a plentiful use of her pocket - handkerchief , addressed herself to him : requesting that on his return home he would console his parents for the loss of her , his aunt , by delivering to them a faithful statement of his having left her in the bosom of that family , with which , as his aforesaid parents well knew , her best affections were incorporated ; that he would remind them that nothing less than her imperious sense of duty , and devoted attachment to her old master and missis , likewise Miss Dolly and young Mr Joe , should ever have induced her to decline that pressing invitation which they , his parents , had , as he could testify , given her , to lodge and board with them , free of all cost and charge , for evermore ; lastly , that he would help her with her box upstairs , and then repair straight home , bearing her blessing and her strong injunctions to mingle in his prayers a supplication that he might in course of time grow up a locksmith , or a Mr Joe , and have Mrs Vardens and Miss Dollys for his relations and friends . Having brought this admonition to an end -- upon which , to say the truth , the young gentleman for whose benefit it was designed , bestowed little or no heed , having to all appearance his faculties absorbed in the contemplation of the sweetmeats,--Miss Miggs signified to the company in general that they were not to be uneasy , for she would soon return ; and , with her nephew ’s aid , prepared to bear her wardrobe up the staircase . ‘
305721	305729	305329	305329	she	7031	’ said the locksmith to his wife . ‘
305735	305736	305731	305731	you	812	’ ‘
305741	305745	305746	305746	I	0	’ she answered . ‘
305766	305810	305759	305759	her	812	’ Miggs , hearing this , let her end of the box fall heavily to the floor , gave a very loud sniff , crossed her arms , screwed down the corners of her mouth , and cried , in an ascending scale , ‘
305816	305821	305813	305814	good gracious	7038	’ three distinct times . ‘
305832	305837	305822	305822	You	812	’ remarked the locksmith . ‘
305860	305945	305843	305843	I	0	’ Miss Miggs clutched the bank - note he took from his pocket - book and held out to her ; deposited it in a small , red leather purse ; put the purse in her pocket ( displaying , as she did so , a considerable portion of some under - garment , made of flannel , and more black cotton stocking than is commonly seen in public ) ; and , tossing her head , as she looked at Mrs Varden , repeated-- ‘
305951	305952	305843	305843	I	0	’ ‘
305964	305969	305955	305955	you	812	’ observed the locksmith . ‘
305979	305985	305986	305986	you	7753	’ cried Miggs , bridling ; ‘
305998	306005	305993	305993	you	7753	‘ em down without me ? You ’re

306049	306090	306091	306091	I	0	’ With that she dropped a curtsey , and keeping her head erect , her ear towards Mrs Varden , and her eye on the rest of the company , as she alluded to them in her remarks , proceeded : ‘
306092	306097	306133	306133	he	7047	’m quite delighted , I ’m
306141	306246	306248	306248	she	7048	‘ specially considering how ill you always spoke of Mr Joe -- to have him for a son - in - law at last ; and I wonder Miss Dolly can put up with him , either , after being off and on for so many years with a coachmaker . But I HAVE heerd say , that the coachmaker thought twice about it -- he he he!--and that he told a young man as was a frind of his , that he hoped he knowed better than to be drawed into that ; though she and all the family DID pull uncommon strong ! ’
306263	306421	306248	306248	she	7048	‘ I HAVE heerd say , mim , that the illnesses of some ladies was all pretensions , and that they could faint away , stone dead , whenever they had the inclinations so to do .

I HAVE heerd the neighbours make remark as some one as they was acquainted with , was a poor good - natur’d mean - spirited creetur , as went out fishing for a wife one day , and caught a Tartar . Of course I never to my knowledge see the poor person himself . Nor did you neither , mim -- ho no . I wonder who it can be -- don’t you , mim ? No doubt you do , mim . Ho yes . He he he ! ’
306450	306452	306444	306444	she	239	‘ I ’m
306459	306467	306454	306455	Miss Dolly	7049	’ cried Miggs with a feeble titter . ‘

He he ! I would n’t have a husband with one arm , anyways . I would have two arms . I would have two arms , if it was me , though instead of hands they ’d only got hooks at the end , like our dustman ! ’
306919	306935	306941	306941	he	7447	‘ It ’s a thing to laugh at , Martha , not to care for , ’
306957	306998	306941	306941	he	7447	‘ What does it matter ? You had seen your fault before . Come ! Bring up Toby again , my dear ; Dolly shall sing us a song ; and we ’ll be all the merrier for this interruption ! ’
307852	307861	307862	307862	he	206	‘ Why have you brought it to me ? ’
307965	307975	307976	307976	he	206	‘ We thought you were a stranger , sir , ’
307979	308006	307976	307976	he	206	‘ and that you might believe our roads to be better than they are ; but perhaps you know them well , and carry fire - arms-- ’

308329	308376	308320	308320	he	206	‘ and there will be a merry fireside beneath its ivied roof . It is some comfort to know that everything will not be blighted hereabouts . I shall be glad to have one picture of life and cheerfulness to turn to , in my mind ! ’
308952	308960	308932	308932	he	711	‘ Why have you called to me ? ’
308961	308965	308971	308971	his	342	‘ To remark , ’
308975	308989	308967	308969	Sir John Chester	342	‘ what an odd chance it is , that we should meet here ! ’
308990	308997	308932	308932	he	711	‘ It IS a strange chance . ’
308998	309063	308932	308932	he	711	‘ Strange ? The most remarkable and singular thing in the world . I never ride in the evening ; I have not done so for years . The whim seized me , quite unaccountably , in the middle of last night.--How very picturesque this is!’--He pointed , as he spoke , to the dismantled house , and raised his glass to his eye . ‘
309072	309107	309064	309064	You	711	’ Sir John let fall his glass ; inclined his face towards him with an air of the most courteous inquiry ; and slightly shook his head as though he were remarking to himself , ‘

309128	309133	309118	309118	I	0	’ repeated Mr Haredale . ‘
309136	309145	309146	309146	Mine!--I	711	’ echoed Sir John , looking smilingly round . ‘

309210	309223	309201	309201	you	711	’ returned the knight , gently checking his impatience with his hand , ‘
309305	309346	309300	309300	you	711	’ He pulled out his snuff - box , and addressing him with the superior air of a man who , by reason of his higher nature , has a right to read a moral lesson to another , continued : ‘
309411	309416	309418	309419	Mr Haredale	206	’ --‘And shall again , ’

309474	309512	309471	309472	Mr Haredale	206	‘ you had spared me none . I would , with all my soul , you had been in Paradise ( if such a monstrous lie could be enacted ) , rather than here to - night . ’
309513	309516	309471	309472	Mr Haredale	206	‘ Nay , ’
309543	309544	309471	309472	Mr Haredale	206	’ ‘

309722	309736	309715	309715	I	0	’ he cried , abruptly pointing in his face , and stepping back , ‘
309743	309769	309770	309770	You	711	’ He had his hand upon his sword ; but the knight , with a contemptuous smile , replied to him as coldly as before . ‘

309903	309904	309905	309905	You	711	’ ‘
309908	309936	309905	309905	You	711	’ returned Sir John , suffering the current of his speech to flow as smoothly as if it had been stemmed by no one word of interruption , ‘
310089	310090	310076	310076	you	711	’ ‘
310101	310106	310118	310118	you	711	’ cried Mr Haredale ; ‘
310326	310446	310306	310306	I	0	’ With that he raised his arm , and struck him on the breast so that he staggered . Sir John , the instant he recovered , drew his sword , threw away the scabbard and his hat , and running on his adversary made a desperate lunge at his heart , which , but that his guard was quick and true , would have stretched him dead upon the grass . In the act of striking him , the torrent of his opponent ’s rage had reached a stop . He parried his rapid thrusts , without returning them , and called to him , with a frantic kind of terror in his face , to keep back . ‘
310457	310461	310306	310306	I	0	’ he cried . ‘
310470	310492	310306	310306	I	0	’ Seeing that he lowered his weapon , and that he would not thrust in turn , Sir John lowered his . ‘
310498	310503	310306	310306	I	0	’ his adversary cried . ‘
310509	310510	310511	310511	You	7165	’ ‘
310524	310547	310511	310511	You	7165	’ said Sir John , quite deliberately , though now he dropped his mask , and showed his hatred in his face , ‘

310694	310699	310690	310690	I	0	’ cried Mr Haredale , ‘

310737	310746	310726	310726	You	0	’ said Sir John , with a smile . ‘

310805	310816	310818	310818	you	0	’ cried his opponent , wildly stamping on the ground , ‘

310875	310885	310897	310897	Haredale	206	’ returned Sir John , without the least emotion , ‘
310946	314001	314002	314002	I	0	’ Not another word was spoken on either side . They crossed swords , though it was now quite dusk , and attacked each other fiercely . They were well matched , and each was thoroughly skilled in the management of his weapon . After a few seconds they grew hotter and more furious , and pressing on each other inflicted and received several slight wounds . It was directly after receiving one of these in his arm , that Mr Haredale , making a keener thrust as he felt the warm blood spirting out , plunged his sword through his opponent ’s body to the hilt . Their eyes met , and were on each other as he drew it out . He put his arm about the dying man , who repulsed him , feebly , and dropped upon the turf . Raising himself upon his hands , he gazed at him for an instant , with scorn and hatred in his look ; but , seeming to remember , even then , that this expression would distort his features after death , he tried to smile , and , faintly moving his right hand , as if to hide his bloody linen in his vest , fell back dead -- the phantom of last night . Chapter the Last A parting glance at such of the actors in this little history as it has not , in the course of its events , dismissed , will bring it to an end . Mr Haredale fled that night . Before pursuit could be begun , indeed before Sir John was traced or missed , he had left the kingdom . Repairing straight to a religious establishment , known throughout Europe for the rigour and severity of its discipline , and for the merciless penitence it exacted from those who sought its shelter as a refuge from the world , he took the vows which thenceforth shut him out from nature and his kind , and after a few remorseful years was buried in its gloomy cloisters . Two days elapsed before the body of Sir John was found . As soon as it was recognised and carried home , the faithful valet , true to his master ’s creed , eloped with all the cash and movables he could lay his hands on , and started as a finished gentleman upon his own account . In this career he met with great success , and would certainly have married an heiress in the end , but for an unlucky check which led to his premature decease . He sank under a contagious disorder , very prevalent at that time , and vulgarly termed the jail fever . Lord George Gordon , remaining in his prison in the Tower until Monday the fifth of February in the following year , was on that day solemnly tried at Westminster for High Treason . Of this crime he was , after a patient investigation , declared Not Guilty ; upon the ground that there was no proof of his having called the multitude together with any traitorous or unlawful intentions . Yet so many people were there , still , to whom those riots taught no lesson of reproof or moderation , that a public subscription was set on foot in Scotland to defray the cost of his defence . For seven years afterwards he remained , at the strong intercession of his friends , comparatively quiet ; saving that he , every now and then , took occasion to display his zeal for the Protestant faith in some extravagant proceeding which was the delight of its enemies ; and saving , besides , that he was formally excommunicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury , for refusing to appear as a witness in the Ecclesiastical Court when cited for that purpose . In the year 1788 he was stimulated by some new insanity to write and publish an injurious pamphlet , reflecting on the Queen of France , in very violent terms . Being indicted for the libel , and ( after various strange demonstrations in court ) found guilty , he fled into Holland in place of appearing to receive sentence : from whence , as the quiet burgomasters of Amsterdam had no relish for his company , he was sent home again with all speed . Arriving in the month of July at Harwich , and going thence to Birmingham , he made in the latter place , in August , a public profession of the Jewish religion ; and figured there as a Jew until he was arrested , and brought back to London to receive the sentence he had evaded . By virtue of this sentence he was , in the month of December , cast into Newgate for five years and ten months , and required besides to pay a large fine , and to furnish heavy securities for his future good behaviour . After addressing , in the midsummer of the following year , an appeal to the commiseration of the National Assembly of France , which the English minister refused to sanction , he composed himself to undergo his full term of punishment ; and suffering his beard to grow nearly to his waist , and conforming in all respects to the ceremonies of his new religion , he applied himself to the study of history , and occasionally to the art of painting , in which , in his younger days , he had shown some skill . Deserted by his former friends , and treated in all respects like the worst criminal in the jail , he lingered on , quite cheerful and resigned , until the 1st of November 1793 , when he died in his cell , being then only three - and - forty years of age . Many men with fewer sympathies for the distressed and needy , with less abilities and harder hearts , have made a shining figure and left a brilliant fame . He had his mourners . The prisoners bemoaned his loss , and missed him ; for though his means were not large , his charity was great , and in bestowing alms among them he considered the necessities of all alike , and knew no distinction of sect or creed . There are wise men in the highways of the world who may learn something , even from this poor crazy lord who died in Newgate . To the last , he was truly served by bluff John Grueby . John was at his side before he had been four - and - twenty hours in the Tower , and never left him until he died . He had one other constant attendant , in the person of a beautiful Jewish girl ; who attached herself to him from feelings half religious , half romantic , but whose virtuous and disinterested character appears to have been beyond the censure even of the most censorious . Gashford deserted him , of course . He subsisted for a time upon his traffic in his master ’s secrets ; and , this trade failing when the stock was quite exhausted , procured an appointment in the honourable corps of spies and eavesdroppers employed by the government . As one of these wretched underlings , he did his drudgery , sometimes abroad , sometimes at home , and long endured the various miseries of such a station . Ten or a dozen years ago -- not more -- a meagre , wan old man , diseased and miserably poor , was found dead in his bed at an obscure inn in the Borough , where he was quite unknown . He had taken poison . There was no clue to his name ; but it was discovered from certain entries in a pocket - book he carried , that he had been secretary to Lord George Gordon in the time of the famous riots . Many months after the re - establishment of peace and order , and even when it had ceased to be the town - talk , that every military officer , kept at free quarters by the City during the late alarms , had cost for his board and lodging four pounds four per day , and every private soldier two and twopence halfpenny ; many months after even this engrossing topic was forgotten , and the United Bulldogs were to a man all killed , imprisoned , or transported , Mr Simon Tappertit , being removed from a hospital to prison , and thence to his place of trial , was discharged by proclamation , on two wooden legs . Shorn of his graceful limbs , and brought down from his high estate to circumstances of utter destitution , and the deepest misery , he made shift to stump back to his old master , and beg for some relief . By the locksmith ’s advice and aid , he was established in business as a shoeblack , and opened shop under an archway near the Horse Guards . This being a central quarter , he quickly made a very large connection ; and on levee days , was sometimes known to have as many as twenty half - pay officers waiting their turn for polishing . Indeed his trade increased to that extent , that in course of time he entertained no less than two apprentices , besides taking for his wife the widow of an eminent bone and rag collector , formerly of Millbank . With this lady ( who assisted in the business ) he lived in great domestic happiness , only chequered by those little storms which serve to clear the atmosphere of wedlock , and brighten its horizon . In some of these gusts of bad weather , Mr Tappertit would , in the assertion of his prerogative , so far forget himself , as to correct his lady with a brush , or boot , or shoe ; while she ( but only in extreme cases ) would retaliate by taking off his legs , and leaving him exposed to the derision of those urchins who delight in mischief . Miss Miggs , baffled in all her schemes , matrimonial and otherwise , and cast upon a thankless , undeserving world , turned very sharp and sour ; and did at length become so acid , and did so pinch and slap and tweak the hair and noses of the youth of Golden Lion Court , that she was by one consent expelled that sanctuary , and desired to bless some other spot of earth , in preference . It chanced at that moment , that the justices of the peace for Middlesex proclaimed by public placard that they stood in need of a female turnkey for the County Bridewell , and appointed a day and hour for the inspection of candidates . Miss Miggs attending at the time appointed , was instantly chosen and selected from one hundred and twenty - four competitors , and at once promoted to the office ; which she held until her decease , more than thirty years afterwards , remaining single all that time . It was observed of this lady that while she was inflexible and grim to all her female flock , she was particularly so to those who could establish any claim to beauty : and it was often remarked as a proof of her indomitable virtue and severe chastity , that to such as had been frail she showed no mercy ; always falling upon them on the slightest occasion , or on no occasion at all , with the fullest measure of her wrath . Among other useful inventions which she practised upon this class of offenders and bequeathed to posterity , was the art of inflicting an exquisitely vicious poke or dig with the wards of a key in the small of the back , near the spine . She likewise originated a mode of treading by accident ( in pattens ) on such as had small feet ; also very remarkable for its ingenuity , and previously quite unknown . It was not very long , you may be sure , before Joe Willet and Dolly Varden were made husband and wife , and with a handsome sum in bank ( for the locksmith could afford to give his daughter a good dowry ) , reopened the Maypole . It was not very long , you may be sure , before a red - faced little boy was seen staggering about the Maypole passage , and kicking up his heels on the green before the door . It was not very long , counting by years , before there was a red - faced little girl , another red - faced little boy , and a whole troop of girls and boys : so that , go to Chigwell when you would , there would surely be seen , either in the village street , or on the green , or frolicking in the farm - yard -- for it was a farm now , as well as a tavern -- more small Joes and small Dollys than could be easily counted . It was not a very long time before these appearances ensued ; but it WAS a VERY long time before Joe looked five years older , or Dolly either , or the locksmith either , or his wife either : for cheerfulness and content are great beautifiers , and are famous preservers of youthful looks , depend upon it . It was a long time , too , before there was such a country inn as the Maypole , in all England : indeed it is a great question whether there has ever been such another to this hour , or ever will be . It was a long time too -- for Never , as the proverb says , is a long day -- before they forgot to have an interest in wounded soldiers at the Maypole , or before Joe omitted to refresh them , for the sake of his old campaign ; or before the serjeant left off looking in there , now and then ; or before they fatigued themselves , or each other , by talking on these occasions of battles and sieges , and hard weather and hard service , and a thousand things belonging to a soldier ’s life . As to the great silver snuff - box which the King sent Joe with his own hand , because of his conduct in the Riots , what guest ever went to the Maypole without putting finger and thumb into that box , and taking a great pinch , though he had never taken a pinch of snuff before , and almost sneezed himself into convulsions even then ? As to the purple - faced vintner , where is the man who lived in those times and never saw HIM at the Maypole : to all appearance as much at home in the best room , as if he lived there ? And as to the feastings and christenings , and revellings at Christmas , and celebrations of birthdays , wedding - days , and all manner of days , both at the Maypole and the Golden Key,--if they are not notorious , what facts are ? Mr Willet the elder , having been by some extraordinary means possessed with the idea that Joe wanted to be married , and that it would be well for him , his father , to retire into private life , and enable him to live in comfort , took up his abode in a small cottage at Chigwell ; where they widened and enlarged the fireplace for him , hung up the boiler , and furthermore planted in the little garden outside the front - door , a fictitious Maypole ; so that he was quite at home directly . To this , his new habitation , Tom Cobb , Phil Parkes , and Solomon Daisy went regularly every night : and in the chimney - corner , they all four quaffed , and smoked , and prosed , and dozed , as they had done of old . It being accidentally discovered after a short time that Mr Willet still appeared to consider himself a landlord by profession , Joe provided him with a slate , upon which the old man regularly scored up vast accounts for meat , drink , and tobacco . As he grew older this passion increased upon him ; and it became his delight to chalk against the name of each of his cronies a sum of enormous magnitude , and impossible to be paid : and such was his secret joy in these entries , that he would be perpetually seen going behind the door to look at them , and coming forth again , suffused with the liveliest satisfaction . He never recovered the surprise the Rioters had given him , and remained in the same mental condition down to the last moment of his life . It was like to have been brought to a speedy termination by the first sight of his first grandchild , which appeared to fill him with the belief that some alarming miracle had happened to Joe . Being promptly blooded , however , by a skilful surgeon , he rallied ; and although the doctors all agreed , on his being attacked with symptoms of apoplexy six months afterwards , that he ought to die , and took it very ill that he did not , he remained alive -- possibly on account of his constitutional slowness -- for nearly seven years more , when he was one morning found speechless in his bed . He lay in this state , free from all tokens of uneasiness , for a whole week , when he was suddenly restored to consciousness by hearing the nurse whisper in his son ’s ear that he was going . ‘
314003	314010	314012	314013	Mr Willet	194	’m a - going , Joseph , ’
314021	314643	314012	314013	Mr Willet	194	‘ to the Salwanners’--and immediately gave up the ghost . He left a large sum of money behind him ; even more than he was supposed to have been worth , although the neighbours , according to the custom of mankind in calculating the wealth that other people ought to have saved , had estimated his property in good round numbers . Joe inherited the whole ; so that he became a man of great consequence in those parts , and was perfectly independent . Some time elapsed before Barnaby got the better of the shock he had sustained , or regained his old health and gaiety . But he recovered by degrees : and although he could never separate his condemnation and escape from the idea of a terrific dream , he became , in other respects , more rational . Dating from the time of his recovery , he had a better memory and greater steadiness of purpose ; but a dark cloud overhung his whole previous existence , and never cleared away . He was not the less happy for this , for his love of freedom and interest in all that moved or grew , or had its being in the elements , remained to him unimpaired . He lived with his mother on the Maypole farm , tending the poultry and the cattle , working in a garden of his own , and helping everywhere . He was known to every bird and beast about the place , and had a name for every one . Never was there a lighter - hearted husbandman , a creature more popular with young and old , a blither or more happy soul than Barnaby ; and though he was free to ramble where he would , he never quitted Her , but was for evermore her stay and comfort . It was remarkable that although he had that dim sense of the past , he sought out Hugh ’s dog , and took him under his care ; and that he never could be tempted into London . When the Riots were many years old , and Edward and his wife came back to England with a family almost as numerous as Dolly ’s , and one day appeared at the Maypole porch , he knew them instantly , and wept and leaped for joy . But neither to visit them , nor on any other pretence , no matter how full of promise and enjoyment , could he be persuaded to set foot in the streets : nor did he ever conquer this repugnance or look upon the town again . Grip soon recovered his looks , and became as glossy and sleek as ever . But he was profoundly silent . Whether he had forgotten the art of Polite Conversation in Newgate , or had made a vow in those troubled times to forego , for a period , the display of his accomplishments , is matter of uncertainty ; but certain it is that for a whole year he never indulged in any other sound than a grave , decorous croak . At the expiration of that term , the morning being very bright and sunny , he was heard to address himself to the horses in the stable , upon the subject of the Kettle , so often mentioned in these pages ; and before the witness who overheard him could run into the house with the intelligence , and add to it upon his solemn affirmation the statement that he had heard him laugh , the bird himself advanced with fantastic steps to the very door of the bar , and there cried , ‘
314645	314650	314012	314013	Mr Willet	194	’m a devil , I ’m
314655	314659	314012	314013	Mr Willet	194	’m a devil ! ’
