Lizzie ’s father , composing himself into the easy attitude of one who had asserted the high moralities and taken an unassailable position , slowly lighted a pipe , and smoked , and took a survey of what he had in tow . What he had in tow , lunged itself at him sometimes in an awful manner when the boat was checked , and sometimes seemed to try to wrench itself away , though for the most part it followed submissively . A neophyte might have fancied that the ripples passing over it were dreadfully like faint changes of expression on a sightless face ; but Gaffer was no neophyte and had no fancies . Chapter 2 THE MAN FROM SOMEWHERE Mr and Mrs Veneering were bran - new people in a bran - new house in a bran - new quarter of London . Everything about the Veneerings was spick and span new . All their furniture was new , all their friends were new , all their servants were new , their plate was new , their carriage was new , their harness was new , their horses were new , their pictures were new , they themselves were new , they were as newly married as was lawfully compatible with their having a bran - new baby , and if they had set up a great - grandfather , he would have come home in matting from the Pantechnicon , without a scratch upon him , French polished to the crown of his head . For , in the Veneering establishment , from the hall - chairs with the new coat of arms , to the grand pianoforte with the new action , and upstairs again to the new fire - escape , all things were in a state of high varnish and polish . And what was observable in the furniture , was observable in the Veneerings — the surface smelt a little too much of the workshop and was a trifle sticky . There was an innocent piece of dinner - furniture that went upon easy castors and was kept over a livery stable - yard in Duke Street , Saint James ’s , when not in use , to whom the Veneerings were a source of blind confusion . The name of this article was Twemlow . Being first cousin to Lord Snigsworth , he was in frequent requisition , and at many houses might be said to represent the dining - table in its normal state . Mr and Mrs Veneering , for example , arranging a dinner , habitually started with Twemlow , and then put leaves in him , or added guests to him . Sometimes , the table consisted of Twemlow and half a dozen leaves ; sometimes , of Twemlow and a dozen leaves ; sometimes , Twemlow was pulled out to his utmost extent of twenty leaves . Mr and Mrs Veneering on occasions of ceremony faced each other in the centre of the board , and thus the parallel still held ; for , it always happened that the more Twemlow was pulled out , the further he found himself from the center , and nearer to the sideboard at one end of the room , or the window - curtains at the other . But , it was not this which steeped the feeble soul of Twemlow in confusion . This he was used to , and could take soundings of . The abyss to which he could find no bottom , and from which started forth the engrossing and ever - swelling difficulty of his life , was the insoluble question whether he was Veneering ’s oldest friend , or newest friend . To the excogitation of this problem , the harmless gentleman had devoted many anxious hours , both in his lodgings over the livery stable - yard , and in the cold gloom , favourable to meditation , of Saint James ’s Square . Thus . Twemlow had first known Veneering at his club , where Veneering then knew nobody but the man who made them known to one another , who seemed to be the most intimate friend he had in the world , and whom he had known two days — the bond of union between their souls , the nefarious conduct of the committee respecting the cookery of a fillet of veal , having been accidentally cemented at that date . Immediately upon this , Twemlow received an invitation to dine with Veneering , and dined : the man being of the party . Immediately upon that , Twemlow received an invitation to dine with the man , and dined : Veneering being of the party . At the man ’s were a Member , an Engineer , a Payer - off of the National Debt , a Poem on Shakespeare , a Grievance , and a Public Office , who all seem to be utter strangers to Veneering . And yet immediately after that , Twemlow received an invitation to dine at Veneerings , expressly to meet the Member , the Engineer , the Payer - off of the National Debt , the Poem on Shakespeare , the Grievance , and the Public Office , and , dining , discovered that all of them were the most intimate friends Veneering had in the world , and that the wives of all of them ( who were all there ) were the objects of Mrs Veneering ’s most devoted affection and tender confidence . Thus it had come about , that Mr Twemlow had said to himself in his lodgings , with his hand to his forehead : ‘
3253	3267	3235	3237	A fifth retainer	914	‘ Here is another wretched creature come to dinner ; such is life!’—announces , ‘
3273	3321	3268	3271	Mis - ter Twemlow	271	’ Mrs Veneering welcomes her sweet Mr Twemlow . Mr Veneering welcomes his dear Twemlow . Mrs Veneering does not expect that Mr Twemlow can in nature care much for such insipid things as babies , but so old a friend must please to look at baby . ‘
3336	3348	3334	3334	Tootleums	261	’ says Mr Veneering , nodding emotionally at that new article , ‘
3356	3394	3395	3397	Mis - ter	271	’ He then begs to make his dear Twemlow known to his two friends , Mr Boots and Mr Brewer — and clearly has no distinct idea which is which . But now a fearful circumstance occurs . ‘
3404	3405	3406	3407	My dear	919	’ ‘
3409	3431	3432	3433	the Podsnaps	264	’ says Mr Veneering to Mrs Veneering , with an air of much friendly interest , while the door stands open , ‘
3435	3466	3432	3433	the Podsnaps	264	’ A too , too smiling large man , with a fatal freshness on him , appearing with his wife , instantly deserts his wife and darts at Twemlow with : ‘
3501	3553	3497	3497	I	0	’ When the first shock fell upon him , Twemlow twice skipped back in his neat little shoes and his neat little silk stockings of a bygone fashion , as if impelled to leap over a sofa behind him ; but the large man closed with him and proved too strong . ‘
3557	3575	3497	3497	I	0	’ says the large man , trying to attract the attention of his wife in the distance , ‘
3591	3609	3610	3610	she	265	’ in his fatal freshness he seems to find perpetual verdure and eternal youth in the phrase , ‘
3623	3851	3853	3853	you	924	’ In the meantime , Mrs Podsnap , unable to originate a mistake on her own account , because Mrs Veneering is the only other lady there , does her best in the way of handsomely supporting her husband ’s , by looking towards Mr Twemlow with a plaintive countenance and remarking to Mrs Veneering in a feeling manner , firstly , that she fears he has been rather bilious of late , and , secondly , that the baby is already very like him . It is questionable whether any man quite relishes being mistaken for any other man ; but , Mr Veneering having this very evening set up the shirt - front of the young Antinous in new worked cambric just come home , is not at all complimented by being supposed to be Twemlow , who is dry and weazen and some thirty years older . Mrs Veneering equally resents the imputation of being the wife of Twemlow . As to Twemlow , he is so sensible of being a much better bred man than Veneering , that he considers the large man an offensive ass . In this complicated dilemma , Mr Veneering approaches the large man with extended hand and , smilingly assures that incorrigible personage that he is delighted to see him : who in his fatal freshness instantly replies : ‘
3885	3966	3881	3881	I	0	’ Then pouncing upon Twemlow , who holds back with all his feeble might , he is haling him off to present him , as Veneering , to Mrs Podsnap , when the arrival of more guests unravels the mistake . Whereupon , having re - shaken hands with Veneering as Veneering , he re - shakes hands with Twemlow as Twemlow , and winds it all up to his own perfect satisfaction by saying to the last - named , ‘
3980	4124	3976	3976	I	0	’ Now , Twemlow having undergone this terrific experience , having likewise noted the fusion of Boots in Brewer and Brewer in Boots , and having further observed that of the remaining seven guests four discrete characters enter with wandering eyes and wholly declined to commit themselves as to which is Veneering , until Veneering has them in his grasp;—Twemlow having profited by these studies , finds his brain wholesomely hardening as he approaches the conclusion that he really is Veneering ’s oldest friend , when his brain softens again and all is lost , through his eyes encountering Veneering and the large man linked together as twin brothers in the back drawing - room near the conservatory door , and through his ears informing him in the tones of Mrs Veneering that the same large man is to be baby ’s godfather . ‘
4131	4142	3976	3976	I	0	’ Thus the melancholy retainer , as who should say , ‘
4155	4187	4188	4188	Man	929	’ Twemlow , having no lady assigned him , goes down in the rear , with his hand to his forehead . Boots and Brewer , thinking him indisposed , whisper , ‘
4195	4266	4188	4188	Man	929	’ But he is only stunned by the unvanquishable difficulty of his existence . Revived by soup , Twemlow discourses mildly of the Court Circular with Boots and Brewer . Is appealed to , at the fish stage of the banquet , by Veneering , on the disputed question whether his cousin Lord Snigsworth is in or out of town ? Gives it that his cousin is out of town . ‘
4271	4275	4188	4188	Man	929	’ Veneering inquires . ‘
4279	4324	4188	4188	Man	929	’ Twemlow rejoins . Boots and Brewer regard this as a man to be cultivated ; and Veneering is clear that he is a remunerative article . Meantime the retainer goes round , like a gloomy Analytical Chemist : always seeming to say , after ‘
4339	4382	4188	4188	Man	929	’ The great looking - glass above the sideboard , reflects the table and the company . Reflects the new Veneering crest , in gold and eke in silver , frosted and also thawed , a camel of all work . The Heralds ’
4805	4807	4803	4807	a certain ‘ Mortimer ’	8687	‘ Mortimer ’
5043	5052	5041	5041	her	268	‘ I assure you , my dear Veneering — ’
5080	5129	5130	5130	Mortimer	287	‘ I assure you , my dear Veneering , that it is the oddest affair ! Like the advertising people , I do n’t ask you to trust me , without offering a respectable reference . Mortimer there , is my reference , and knows all about it . ’
5149	5155	5158	5158	his	287	‘ What ’s the use ! ’
5171	5176	5178	5179	Lady Tippins	268	‘ Now , Mortimer , ’
5204	5222	5185	5185	her	268	‘ I insist upon your telling all that is to be told about the man from Jamaica . ’
5223	5245	5247	5247	Mortimer	287	‘ Give you my honour I never heard of any man from Jamaica , except the man who was a brother , ’
5249	5254	5247	5247	Mortimer	287	‘ Tobago , then . ’
5255	5261	5185	5185	her	268	‘ Nor yet from Tobago . ’
5262	5265	5266	5266	Eugene	269	‘ Except , ’
5296	5335	5273	5276	the mature young lady	949	‘ except our friend who long lived on rice - pudding and isinglass , till at length to his something or other , his physician said something else , and a leg of mutton somehow ended in daygo . ’
5359	5367	5354	5354	he	269	‘ Now , my dear Mrs Veneering , ’
5496	5611	5612	5612	I	0	’ A grisly little fiction concerning her lovers is Lady Tippins ’s point . She is always attended by a lover or two , and she keeps a little list of her lovers , and she is always booking a new lover , or striking out an old lover , or putting a lover in her black list , or promoting a lover to her blue list , or adding up her lovers , or otherwise posting her book . Mrs Veneering is charmed by the humour , and so is Veneering . Perhaps it is enhanced by a certain yellow play in Lady Tippins ’s throat , like the legs of scratching poultry . ‘
5671	5676	5661	5661	you	971	’ to Mrs Veneering , ‘
5691	5703	5687	5687	you	971	’ This to Mortimer , with a rattle of her fan . ‘
5716	5736	5704	5704	We	974	’ Veneering observes . Then the four Buffers , taking heart of grace all four at once , say : ‘
5740	5741	5711	5714	the man from Somewhere	970	’ ‘
5745	5746	5711	5714	the man from Somewhere	970	’ ‘
5749	5750	5711	5714	the man from Somewhere	970	’ ‘
5757	5793	5711	5714	the man from Somewhere	970	’ And then Mrs Veneering — for the Lady Tippins ’s winning wiles are contagious — folds her hands in the manner of a supplicating child , turns to her left neighbour , and says , ‘
5802	5819	5820	5820	You	971	’ At which the four Buffers , again mysteriously moved all four at once , explain , ‘
5825	5826	5820	5820	You	971	’ ‘
5831	5836	5820	5820	You	971	’ says Mortimer languidly , ‘
5929	5932	5935	5935	Martin	272	’ Eugene suggests ‘
5938	5939	5935	5935	Martin	272	’ ‘
5946	5952	5956	5956	they	982	’ returns the unmoved Mortimer , ‘
5993	6035	6036	6037	The man	839	’ It is always noticeable at the table of the Veneerings , that no man troubles himself much about the Veneerings themselves , and that any one who has anything to tell , generally tells it to anybody else in preference . ‘
6039	6047	6051	6051	Harmon	273	’ Mortimer goes on , addressing Eugene , ‘
6068	6069	6057	6066	a tremendous old rascal who made his money by Dust	989	’ ‘
6076	6082	6057	6066	a tremendous old rascal who made his money by Dust	989	’ the gloomy Eugene inquires . ‘
6174	6223	6228	6228	I	0	’ A passing remembrance of Mrs Veneering , here induces Mortimer to address his next half - dozen words to her ; after which he wanders away again , tries Twemlow and finds he does n’t answer , ultimately takes up with the Buffers who receive him enthusiastically . ‘
6425	6481	6404	6406	the venerable parent	1005	’ Here , the Analytical Chemist ( who has evidently formed a very low opinion of Mortimer ’s story ) concedes a little claret to the Buffers ; who , again mysteriously moved all four at once , screw it slowly into themselves with a peculiar twist of enjoyment , as they cry in chorus , ‘
6486	6487	6404	6406	the venerable parent	1005	’ ‘
6643	6788	6789	6789	We	1017	’ There is that in the indolent Mortimer , which seems to hint that if good society might on any account allow itself to be impressible , he , one of good society , might have the weakness to be impressed by what he here relates . It is hidden with great pains , but it is in him . The gloomy Eugene too , is not without some kindred touch ; for , when that appalling Lady Tippins declares that if Another had survived , he should have gone down at the head of her list of lovers — and also when the mature young lady shrugs her epaulettes , and laughs at some private and confidential comment from the mature young gentleman — his gloom deepens to that degree that he trifles quite ferociously with his dessert - knife . Mortimer proceeds . ‘
6965	7016	6956	6956	grower	1034	’ At this juncture , shuffling is heard in the hall , and tapping is heard at the dining - room door . Analytical Chemist goes to the door , confers angrily with unseen tapper , appears to become mollified by descrying reason in the tapping , and goes out . ‘
7035	7055	6956	6956	grower	1034	’ A Buffer , suddenly astounding the other three , by detaching himself , and asserting individuality , inquires : ‘
7062	7063	7071	7071	you	1035	’ ‘
7080	7090	7076	7077	Venerable parent	1028	’ Same Buffer , emboldened by success , says : ‘
7093	7094	7076	7077	Venerable parent	1028	’ ‘
7105	7112	7076	7077	Venerable parent	1028	’ Same Buffer inquires with smartness , ‘
7116	7145	7146	7147	Venerable parent	1028	’ But herein perishes a melancholy example ; being regarded by the three other Buffers with a stony stare , and attracting no further attention from any mortal . ‘
7149	7172	7173	7175	The gratified Veneering	1038	’ Mortimer repeats with a passing remembrance that there is a Veneering at table , and for the first time addressing him—‘dies . ’
7180	7182	7173	7175	The gratified Veneering	1038	‘ dies ’
7213	7219	7221	7221	Mortimer	287	‘ His will is found , ’
7233	7328	7221	7221	Mortimer	287	‘ It is dated very soon after the son ’s flight . It leaves the lowest of the range of dust - mountains , with some sort of a dwelling - house at its foot , to an old servant who is sole executor , and all the rest of the property — which is very considerable — to the son . He directs himself to be buried with certain eccentric ceremonies and precautions against his coming to life , with which I need not bore you , and that ’s all — except — ’
7382	7477	7478	7479	Mrs Podsnap	265	‘ — Except that the son ’s inheriting is made conditional on his marrying a girl , who at the date of the will , was a child of four or five years old , and who is now a marriageable young woman . Advertisement and inquiry discovered the son in the man from Somewhere , and at the present moment , he is on his way home from there — no doubt , in a state of great astonishment — to succeed to a very large fortune , and to take a wife . ’
7694	7712	7665	7666	Lady Tippins	268	‘ Falser man than Don Juan ; why do n’t you take the note from the commendatore ? ’
7735	7740	7724	7724	Mortimer	287	‘ What ’s this ? ’
7747	7750	7752	7752	Mortimer	287	‘ WHO ? ’
7794	7803	7805	7805	Mortimer	287	‘ This arrives in an extraordinarily opportune manner , ’
7817	7830	7805	7805	Mortimer	287	‘ this is the conclusion of the story of the identical man . ’
7831	7835	7895	7896	ANOTHER MAN	1056	‘ Already married ? ’
7839	7844	7895	7896	ANOTHER MAN	1056	‘ Declines to marry ? ’

7867	7892	7865	7865	Mortimer	287	‘ remarkable thing , you are all wrong . The story is completer and rather more exciting than I supposed . Man ’s drowned ! ’
7994	8000	7958	7958	Mortimer	287	‘ Whose writing is this ? ’
8001	8006	8047	8048	The boy	1061	‘ Mine , sir . ’
8007	8015	8047	8048	The boy	1061	‘ Who told you to write it ? ’
8016	8023	7958	7958	Mortimer	287	‘ My father , Jesse Hexam . ’
8024	8033	8047	8048	The boy	1061	‘ Is it he who found the body ? ’
8034	8039	8047	8048	The boy	1061	‘ Yes , sir . ’
8040	8046	8047	8048	The boy	1061	‘ What is your father ? ’
8081	8090	8058	8058	they	1064	‘ He gets his living along - shore . ’
8091	8096	8047	8048	The boy	1061	‘ Is it far ? ’
8097	8102	8104	8105	the boy	1061	‘ Is which far ? ’

I went first to your office , according to the direction of the papers found in the pockets , and there I see nobody but a chap of about my age who sent me on here . ’
8308	8330	8331	8331	Mortimer	287	‘ Were any means taken , do you know , boy , to ascertain if it was possible to restore life ? ’
8341	8392	8331	8331	Mortimer	287	‘ You would n’t ask , sir , if you knew his state . Pharaoh ’s multitude that were drowned in the Red Sea , ai n’t more beyond restoring to life . If Lazarus was only half as far gone , that was the greatest of all the miracles . ’
8393	8396	8398	8398	Mortimer	287	‘ Halloa ! ’
8409	8425	8398	8398	Mortimer	287	‘ you seem to be at home in the Red Sea , my young friend ? ’
8426	8436	8438	8439	the boy	1061	‘ Read of it with teacher at the school , ’
8441	8445	8438	8439	the boy	1061	‘ And Lazarus ? ’
8446	8483	8398	8398	Mortimer	287	‘ Yes , and him too . But do n’t you tell my father ! We should have no peace in our place , if that got touched upon . It ’s my sister ’s contriving . ’
8484	8493	8398	8398	Mortimer	287	‘ You seem to have a good sister . ’
8494	8501	8503	8504	the boy	1061	‘ She ai n’t half bad , ’
8506	8526	8503	8504	the boy	1061	‘ but if she knows her letters it ’s the most she does — and them I learned her . ’
8581	8585	8562	8562	he	1061	‘ Well , I ’m

8606	8619	8598	8598	I	0	’ Eugene vouchsafed no answer ; but made the proposal to Mortimer , ‘
8630	8674	8598	8598	I	0	’ So , they all three went away together in the vehicle that had brought the boy ; the two friends ( once boys together at a public school ) inside , smoking cigars ; the messenger on the box beside the driver . ‘
8679	8688	8676	8676	me	0	’ said Mortimer , as they went along ; ‘
8755	8756	8758	8758	I	0	’ ‘
8760	8764	8758	8758	I	0	’ said Eugene , ‘
8801	8802	8792	8792	I	0	’ ‘
8815	8823	8834	8834	I	0	’ returned Mortimer , with great composure , ‘
8832	8833	8834	8834	I	0	’ ‘
8837	8850	8834	8834	I	0	’ said Eugene , putting his legs up on the opposite seat , ‘
8856	8857	8859	8859	I	0	’ ‘
8870	8874	8876	8876	you	269	’ returned Mortimer . ‘
8882	8883	8878	8878	I	0	’ ‘
8890	8896	8878	8878	I	0	’ said the gloomy Eugene , ‘
8917	8918	8923	8923	me	0	’ ‘
8925	8929	8923	8923	me	0	’ said Mortimer , ‘
8951	8952	8944	8944	we	1079	’ ‘
8980	8984	8986	8988	each of us	1085	’ said Eugene ; ‘
9016	9017	9006	9006	Cassim	285	’ ‘
9026	9030	9024	9024	one	1091	’ said Mortimer , ‘
9148	9149	9139	9139	you	0	’ ‘
9154	9178	9151	9151	idiots	1097	’ said Eugene , leaning back , folding his arms , smoking with his eyes shut , and speaking slightly through his nose , ‘
9278	9279	9287	9287	Eugene	269	’ ‘
9312	9313	9306	9306	I	0	’ ‘
9319	9495	9317	9317	I	0	’ said Eugene . And it is likely enough that ten thousand other young men , within the limits of the London Post - office town delivery , made the same hopeful remark in the course of the same evening . The wheels rolled on , and rolled down by the Monument and by the Tower , and by the Docks ; down by Ratcliffe , and by Rotherhithe ; down by where accumulated scum of humanity seemed to be washed from higher grounds , like so much moral sewage , and to be pausing until its own weight forced it over the bank and sunk it in the river . In and out among vessels that seemed to have got ashore , and houses that seemed to have got afloat — among bowsprits staring into windows , and windows staring into ships — the wheels rolled on , until they stopped at a dark corner , river - washed and otherwise not washed at all , where the boy alighted and opened the door . ‘
9510	9525	9317	9317	I	0	’ He spoke in the singular number , to the express exclusion of Eugene . ‘
9539	9561	9317	9317	I	0	’ said Mortimer , slipping over the stones and refuse on the shore , as the boy turned the corner sharp . ‘
9575	9863	9864	9865	The gentleman	1107	’ The low building had the look of having once been a mill . There was a rotten wart of wood upon its forehead that seemed to indicate where the sails had been , but the whole was very indistinctly seen in the obscurity of the night . The boy lifted the latch of the door , and they passed at once into a low circular room , where a man stood before a red fire , looking down into it , and a girl sat engaged in needlework . The fire was in a rusty brazier , not fitted to the hearth ; and a common lamp , shaped like a hyacinth - root , smoked and flared in the neck of a stone bottle on the table . There was a wooden bunk or berth in a corner , and in another corner a wooden stair leading above — so clumsy and steep that it was little better than a ladder . Two or three old sculls and oars stood against the wall , and against another part of the wall was a small dresser , making a spare show of the commonest articles of crockery and cooking - vessels . The roof of the room was not plastered , but was formed of the flooring of the room above . This , being very old , knotted , seamed , and beamed , gave a lowering aspect to the chamber ; and roof , and walls , and floor , alike abounding in old smears of flour , red - lead ( or some such stain which it had probably acquired in warehousing ) , and damp , alike had a look of decomposition . ‘
9869	9891	9892	9892	You	8755	’ The figure at the red fire turned , raised its ruffled head , and looked like a bird of prey . ‘
9893	9903	10012	10012	he	0	’re Mortimer Lightwood Esquire ; are you , sir ? ’
9904	9915	9917	9917	Mortimer	287	‘ Mortimer Lightwood is my name . What you found , ’
9926	9931	9917	9917	Mortimer	287	‘ is it here ? ’
9932	9933	10012	10012	he	0	‘ ’
9954	10001	10012	10012	he	0	’ notice of the circumstarnce to the police , and the police have took possession of it . No time ai n’t been lost , on any hand . The police have put into print already , and here ’s what the print says of it . ’
10053	10064	10066	10066	Lightwood	287	‘ Only papers on the unfortunate man , I see , ’
10081	10085	10066	10066	Lightwood	287	‘ Only papers . ’
10104	10108	10110	10110	Mortimer	287	‘ No money , ’
10112	10123	10110	10110	Mortimer	287	‘ but threepence in one of the skirt - pockets . ’
10124	10131	10133	10134	Gaffer Hexam	248	‘ Three . Penny . Pieces , ’
10141	10152	10133	10134	Gaffer Hexam	248	‘ The trousers pockets empty , and turned inside out . ’
10157	10183	10153	10154	Gaffer Hexam	248	‘ But that ’s common . Whether it ’s the wash of the tide or no , I ca n’t say . Now , here , ’
10192	10207	10153	10154	Gaffer Hexam	248	‘ HIS pockets was found empty , and turned inside out . And here , ’
10214	10256	10153	10154	Gaffer Hexam	248	‘ HER pocket was found empty , and turned inside out . And so was this one ’s . And so was that one ’s . I ca n’t read , nor I do n’t want to it , for I know ’em

He had the special peculiarity of some birds of prey , that when he knitted his brow , his ruffled crest stood highest . ‘
10506	10519	10504	10504	you	1124	’ asked Eugene . To which the bird of prey slowly rejoined , ‘
10529	10530	10504	10504	you	1124	’ ‘

10613	10623	10625	10625	Gaffer	248	‘ I do n’t suppose at all about it , ’
10627	10671	10673	10673	he	248	‘ I ai n’t one of the supposing sort . If you ’d got your living to haul out of the river every day of your life , you might n’t be much given to supposing . Am I to show the way ? ’

10749	10791	10792	10792	He	248	‘ I — I — am a stranger , and do n’t know the way . I — I — want to find the place where I can see what is described here . It is possible I may know it . ’
10844	10856	10803	10803	he	248	‘ This gentleman , Mr Lightwood , is on that business . ’
10857	10861	10866	10866	Mortimer	287	‘ Mr Lightwood ? ’
10879	10885	10887	10887	Mortimer	287	‘ I think , sir , ’
10900	10912	10887	10887	Mortimer	287	‘ that you did me the honour to mention my name ? ’
10913	10922	10894	10894	his	287	‘ I repeated it , after this man . ’
10923	10933	10894	10894	his	287	‘ You said you were a stranger in London ? ’
10934	10939	10887	10887	Mortimer	287	‘ An utter stranger . ’

10953	10985	10887	10887	Mortimer	287	‘ Then I believe I can assure you that you are on a fruitless errand , and will not find what you fear to find . Will you come with us ? ’
11117	11134	11112	11112	Gaffer	248	‘ Ah ! we know all about YOU , and you ’ll overdo it some day ; ’

11523	11535	11511	11512	Mr Inspector	288	‘ It has given him a bad turn to be sure ! ’
11573	11576	11578	11579	Mr Inspector	288	‘ Indeed ? ’
11586	11594	11578	11579	Mr Inspector	288	‘ where did you pick him up ? ’

11799	11861	11862	11862	You	288	’ Mr Inspector had not moved , and had given no order ; but , the satellite slipped his back against the wicket , and laid his left arm along the top of it , and with his right hand turned the bull’s - eye he had taken from his chief — in quite a casual manner — towards the stranger . ‘
11905	11911	11912	11912	You	288	’ Thus , Mr Inspector . ‘
11977	12001	11962	11962	you	288	’ Again he turned towards the wicket , where the satellite , with his eye upon his chief , remained a dumb statue . ‘

12057	12070	12036	12036	I	0	’ said Mr Inspector , with no change of voice or manner , ‘
12083	12084	12071	12071	you	288	’ ‘
12089	12165	12071	12071	you	288	’ Mr Inspector dipped a pen in his inkstand , and deftly laid it on a piece of paper close beside him ; then resumed his former attitude . The stranger stepped up to the desk , and wrote in a rather tremulous hand — Mr Inspector taking sidelong note of every hair of his head when it was bent down for the purpose—‘Mr Julius Handford , Exchequer Coffee House , Palace Yard , Westminster . ’
12166	12175	12036	12036	I	0	‘ Staying there , I presume , sir ? ’
12176	12180	12071	12071	you	288	‘ Staying there . ’

12189	12198	12036	12036	I	0	‘ Eh ? Yes — from the country . ’

12232	12265	12229	12230	Mr Inspector	288	‘ Take care of this piece of paper , keep him in view without giving offence , ascertain that he IS staying there , and find out anything you can about him . ’

Had seen scores of people come to identify , and never saw one person struck in that particular way . Might , however , have been Stomach and not Mind . If so , rum stomach . But to be sure there were rum everythings . Pity there was not a word of truth in that superstition about bodies bleeding when touched by the hand of the right person ; you never got a sign out of bodies . You got row enough out of such as her — she was good for all night now ( referring here to the banging demands for the liver ) , ‘
12500	12565	12488	12488	you	1181	’ There being nothing more to be done until the Inquest was held next day , the friends went away together , and Gaffer Hexam and his son went their separate way . But , arriving at the last corner , Gaffer bade his boy go home while he turned into a red - curtained tavern , that stood dropsically bulging over the causeway , ‘
12574	12609	12488	12488	you	1181	’ The boy lifted the latch he had lifted before , and found his sister again seated before the fire at her work . Who raised her head upon his coming in and asking : ‘

At mid - day following he reappeared at the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters , in the character , not new to him , of a witness before a Coroner ’s Jury . Mr Mortimer Lightwood , besides sustaining the character of one of the witnesses , doubled the part with that of the eminent solicitor who watched the proceedings on behalf of the representatives of the deceased , as was duly recorded in the newspapers . Mr Inspector watched the proceedings too , and kept his watching closely to himself . Mr Julius Handford having given his right address , and being reported in solvent circumstances as to his bill , though nothing more was known of him at his hotel except that his way of life was very retired , had no summons to appear , and was merely present in the shades of Mr Inspector ’s mind . The case was made interesting to the public , by Mr Mortimer Lightwood ’s evidence touching the circumstances under which the deceased , Mr John Harmon , had returned to England ; exclusive private proprietorship in which circumstances was set up at dinner - tables for several days , by Veneering , Twemlow , Podsnap , and all the Buffers : who all related them irreconcilably with one another , and contradicted themselves . It was also made interesting by the testimony of Job Potterson , the ship ’s steward , and one Mr Jacob Kibble , a fellow - passenger , that the deceased Mr John Harmon did bring over , in a hand - valise with which he did disembark , the sum realized by the forced sale of his little landed property , and that the sum exceeded , in ready money , seven hundred pounds . It was further made interesting , by the remarkable experiences of Jesse Hexam in having rescued from the Thames so many dead bodies , and for whose behoof a rapturous admirer subscribing himself ‘

Not to encumber this page by telling off the Wilfers in detail and casting them up in the gross , it is enough for the present that the rest were what is called ‘
16439	16481	16305	16305	I	0	’ in various ways , and that they were Many . So many , that when one of his dutiful children called in to see him , R. Wilfer generally seemed to say to himself , after a little mental arithmetic , ‘

16913	16970	16910	16910	I	0	’ Here , the huffing of Miss Bella and the loss of three of her men at a swoop , aggravated by the coronation of an opponent , led to that young lady ’s jerking the draught - board and pieces off the table : which her sister went down on her knees to pick up . ‘

17005	17049	17052	17054	R. W. Lavinia	304	’ It was one of the worthy woman ’s specialities that she had an amazing power of gratifying her splenetic or worldly - minded humours by extolling her own family : which she thus proceeded , in the present case , to do . ‘
17157	17180	17183	17183	pa	1329	’ Here , Miss Lavinia , from her kneeling situation under the table , put in that she did n’t want to be ‘

17359	17435	17436	17436	I	0	’ The good lady waved her gloves in a sense of the impossibility of saying more , and tied the pocket - handkerchief over her head in a tighter knot under her chin . Bella , who was now seated on the rug to warm herself , with her brown eyes on the fire and a handful of her brown curls in her mouth , laughed at this , and then pouted and half cried . ‘

17543	17587	17536	17536	you	1342	’ This abrupt change was occasioned by her father ’s face . She stopped to pull him down from his chair in an attitude highly favourable to strangulation , and to give him a kiss and a pat or two on the cheek . ‘

17764	17769	17757	17757	You	1329	’ Lavinia again interposed . ‘

17815	17820	17810	17810	you	1329	’ Lavinia again interposed . ‘

17877	17900	17871	17871	You	1329	’ Then , whimpering again , and at intervals biting the curls , and stopping to look how much was bitten off , ‘
18252	18294	18357	18357	her	1365	’ The young lady ’s lamentations were checked at this point by a knuckle , knocking at the half - open door of the room . The knuckle had knocked two or three times already , but had not been heard . ‘
18299	18313	18357	18357	her	1365	’ said Mrs Wilfer , in her Act - of - Parliament manner . ‘
18316	18352	18353	18355	The servant girl	1365	’ A gentleman coming in , Miss Bella , with a short and sharp exclamation , scrambled off the hearth - rug and massed the bitten curls together in their right place on her neck . ‘
18392	18393	18387	18387	her	1365	’ ‘
18397	18402	18387	18387	her	1365	’ returned Mrs Wilfer . ‘
18448	18510	18427	18427	He	1369	’ A dark gentleman . Thirty at the utmost . An expressive , one might say handsome , face . A very bad manner . In the last degree constrained , reserved , diffident , troubled . His eyes were on Miss Bella for an instant , and then looked at the ground as he addressed the master of the house . ‘
18566	18626	18627	18628	The gentleman	1107	’ Two or three times during this short address , the cherub addressed had made chubby motions towards a chair . The gentleman now took it , laying a hesitating hand on a corner of the table , and with another hesitating hand lifting the crown of his hat to his lips , and drawing it before his mouth . ‘
18633	18638	18627	18628	The gentleman	1107	’ said Mrs Wilfer , ‘
18656	18657	18627	18628	The gentleman	1107	’ ‘
18664	18680	18627	18628	The gentleman	1107	’ insinuated the landlord , expecting it to be received as a matter of course , ‘

18692	18701	18689	18689	I	0	’ returned the gentleman , after a pause , ‘
18800	18831	18789	18789	you	8755	’ Conscience causing R. Wilfer to colour , Mrs Wilfer , from a corner ( she always got into stately corners ) came to the rescue with a deep - toned ‘
18836	18837	18789	18789	you	8755	’ ‘
18847	18848	18872	18872	you	8755	’ ‘
18851	18858	18872	18872	you	8755	’ observed R. Wilfer , cheerfully , ‘
18869	18870	18872	18872	you	8755	’ ‘
18881	18906	18872	18872	you	8755	’ asked Miss Bella , in a low voice , and without looking over her shoulder as she warmed her foot on the fender . ‘
18914	18915	18916	18916	I	0	’ ‘
18935	19125	18916	18916	I	0	’ said Bella , with a toss of her curls . The gentleman listened to her , with a face of marked attention , though he neither looked up nor changed his attitude . He sat , still and silent , until his future landlord accepted his proposals , and brought writing materials to complete the business . He sat , still and silent , while the landlord wrote . When the agreement was ready in duplicate ( the landlord having worked at it like some cherubic scribe , in what is conventionally called a doubtful , which means a not at all doubtful , Old Master ) , it was signed by the contracting parties , Bella looking on as scornful witness . The contracting parties were R. Wilfer , and John Rokesmith Esquire . When it came to Bella ’s turn to sign her name , Mr Rokesmith , who was standing , as he had sat , with a hesitating hand upon the table , looked at her stealthily , but narrowly . He looked at the pretty figure bending down over the paper and saying , ‘
19140	19182	19132	19132	pa	1329	’ He looked at the beautiful brown hair , shading the coquettish face ; he looked at the free dash of the signature , which was a bold one for a woman ’s ; and then they looked at one another . ‘
19191	19192	19188	19189	Miss Wilfer	307	’ ‘
19195	19196	19197	19197	I	0	’ ‘

19225	19307	19308	19308	Pa	580	’ As there was nothing more to do but pay eight sovereigns in earnest of the bargain , pocket the agreement , appoint a time for the arrival of his furniture and himself , and go , Mr Rokesmith did that as awkwardly as it might be done , and was escorted by his landlord to the outer air . When R. Wilfer returned , candlestick in hand , to the bosom of his family , he found the bosom agitated . ‘
19310	19314	19308	19308	Pa	580	’ said Bella , ‘
19324	19325	19326	19326	Pa	580	’ ‘
19328	19332	19326	19326	Pa	580	’ said Lavinia , ‘
19339	19340	19336	19337	a Robber	1391	’ ‘
19355	19359	19336	19337	a Robber	1391	’ said Bella . ‘
19367	19368	19336	19337	a Robber	1391	’ ‘
19372	19377	19336	19337	a Robber	1391	’ said their father , ‘
19399	19400	19380	19382	a diffident gentleman	1394	’ ‘
19406	19412	19380	19382	a diffident gentleman	1394	’ cried Bella , impatiently . ‘
19422	19423	19380	19382	a diffident gentleman	1394	’ ‘
19435	19439	19441	19441	YOU	1396	’ demanded Lavinia . ‘
19446	19450	19451	19451	you	317	’ retorted Bella ; ‘
19493	19494	19495	19496	My dear	919	’ ‘
19501	19508	19495	19496	My dear	919	’ said the cherub - patriarch , ‘
19540	19793	19520	19521	eight sovereigns	1399	’ This was a neat and happy turn to give the subject , treats being rare in the Wilfer household , where a monotonous appearance of Dutch - cheese at ten o’clock in the evening had been rather frequently commented on by the dimpled shoulders of Miss Bella . Indeed , the modest Dutchman himself seemed conscious of his want of variety , and generally came before the family in a state of apologetic perspiration . After some discussion on the relative merits of veal - cutlet , sweetbread , and lobster , a decision was pronounced in favour of veal - cutlet . Mrs Wilfer then solemnly divested herself of her handkerchief and gloves , as a preliminary sacrifice to preparing the frying - pan , and R. W. himself went out to purchase the viand . He soon returned , bearing the same in a fresh cabbage - leaf , where it coyly embraced a rasher of ham . Melodious sounds were not long in rising from the frying - pan on the fire , or in seeming , as the firelight danced in the mellow halls of a couple of full bottles on the table , to play appropriate dance - music . The cloth was laid by Lavvy . Bella , as the acknowledged ornament of the family , employed both her hands in giving her hair an additional wave while sitting in the easiest chair , and occasionally threw in a direction touching the supper : as , ‘
19799	19806	19797	19797	ma	8918	’ or , to her sister , ‘
19823	19872	19818	19821	a dowdy little puss	1402	’ Meantime her father , chinking Mr Rokesmith ’s gold as he sat expectant between his knife and fork , remarked that six of those sovereigns came just in time for their landlord , and stood them in a little pile on the white tablecloth to look at . ‘
19878	19951	19873	19873	I	0	’ said Bella . But , observing a fall in her father ’s face , she went and sat down by him at the table , and began touching up his hair with the handle of a fork . It was one of the girl ’s spoilt ways to be always arranging the family ’s hair — perhaps because her own was so pretty , and occupied so much of her attention . ‘
19969	19970	19964	19964	you	0	’ ‘
19983	19984	19971	19971	I	0	’ ‘
19999	20018	20020	20020	I	0	’ said Bella , holding him by the chin , as she stuck his flaxen hair on end , ‘
20166	20283	20284	20284	Pa	580	’ However , as it was brown , even to Bella ’s taste , the young lady graciously partook of it without reconsignment to the frying - pan , and also , in due course , of the contents of the two bottles : whereof one held Scotch ale and the other rum . The latter perfume , with the fostering aid of boiling water and lemon - peel , diffused itself throughout the room , and became so highly concentrated around the warm fireside , that the wind passing over the house roof must have rushed off charged with a delicious whiff of it , after buzzing like a great bee at that particular chimneypot . ‘
20286	20300	20284	20284	Pa	580	’ said Bella , sipping the fragrant mixture and warming her favourite ankle ; ‘
20332	20333	20325	20325	you	580	’ ‘
20391	20392	20386	20386	he	273	’ ‘
20413	20423	20424	20424	You	0	’ said Bella , contemplating the ankle before mentioned . ‘
20459	20475	20476	20476	you	0	’ returned her father , as if the remembrance gave a relish to the rum ; ‘
20540	20541	20534	20534	you	0	’ ‘
20554	20555	20544	20544	he	1417	’ ‘
20593	20656	20582	20582	him	1417	’ As that was all the rum and water too , or , in other words , as R. W. delicately signified that his glass was empty , by throwing back his head and standing the glass upside down on his nose and upper lip , it might have been charitable in Mrs Wilfer to suggest replenishment . But that heroine briefly suggesting ‘
20658	20691	20582	20582	him	1417	’ instead , the bottles were put away , and the family retired ; she cherubically escorted , like some severe saint in a painting , or merely human matron allegorically treated . ‘
20700	20713	20582	20582	him	1417	’ said Lavinia when the two girls were alone in their room , ‘
20731	20732	20733	20733	You	1427	’ ‘
20746	20750	20733	20733	You	1427	’ retorted Bella . ‘

20854	20865	20881	20881	you	1427	’ muttered Lavvy , with a toss of her head . ‘
20871	20878	20868	20868	you	1427	’ asked Bella , very sharply . ‘
20886	21002	20881	20881	you	1427	’ Lavvy declining equally to repeat or to explain , Bella gradually lapsed over her hair - dressing into a soliloquy on the miseries of being poor , as exemplified in having nothing to put on , nothing to go out in , nothing to dress by , only a nasty box to dress at instead of a commodious dressing - table , and being obliged to take in suspicious lodgers . On the last grievance as her climax , she laid great stress — and might have laid greater , had she known that if Mr Julius Handford had a twin brother upon earth , Mr John Rokesmith was the man .

Over the house itself , he exercised the same imaginary power as over its inhabitants and their affairs . He had never been in it , the length of a piece of fat black water - pipe which trailed itself over the area - door into a damp stone passage , and had rather the air of a leech on the house that had ‘
21701	22075	21580	21580	he	839	’ wonderfully ; but this was no impediment to his arranging it according to a plan of his own . It was a great dingy house with a quantity of dim side window and blank back premises , and it cost his mind a world of trouble so to lay it out as to account for everything in its external appearance . But , this once done , was quite satisfactory , and he rested persuaded , that he knew his way about the house blindfold : from the barred garrets in the high roof , to the two iron extinguishers before the main door — which seemed to request all lively visitors to have the kindness to put themselves out , before entering . Assuredly , this stall of Silas Wegg ’s was the hardest little stall of all the sterile little stalls in London . It gave you the face - ache to look at his apples , the stomach - ache to look at his oranges , the tooth - ache to look at his nuts . Of the latter commodity he had always a grim little heap , on which lay a little wooden measure which had no discernible inside , and was considered to represent the penn’orth appointed by Magna Charta . Whether from too much east wind or no — it was an easterly corner — the stall , the stock , and the keeper , were all as dry as the Desert . Wegg was a knotty man , and a close - grained , with a face carved out of very hard material , that had just as much play of expression as a watchman ’s rattle . When he laughed , certain jerks occurred in it , and the rattle sprung . Sooth to say , he was so wooden a man that he seemed to have taken his wooden leg naturally , and rather suggested to the fanciful observer , that he might be expected — if his development received no untimely check — to be completely set up with a pair of wooden legs in about six months . Mr Wegg was an observant person , or , as he himself said , ‘
22082	22330	21580	21580	he	839	’ . He saluted all his regular passers - by every day , as he sat on his stool backed up by the lamp - post ; and on the adaptable character of these salutes he greatly plumed himself . Thus , to the rector , he addressed a bow , compounded of lay deference , and a slight touch of the shady preliminary meditation at church ; to the doctor , a confidential bow , as to a gentleman whose acquaintance with his inside he begged respectfully to acknowledge ; before the Quality he delighted to abase himself ; and for Uncle Parker , who was in the army ( at least , so he had settled it ) , he put his open hand to the side of his hat , in a military manner which that angry - eyed buttoned - up inflammatory - faced old gentleman appeared but imperfectly to appreciate . The only article in which Silas dealt , that was not hard , was gingerbread . On a certain day , some wretched infant having purchased the damp gingerbread - horse ( fearfully out of condition ) , and the adhesive bird - cage , which had been exposed for the day ’s sale , he had taken a tin box from under his stool to produce a relay of those dreadful specimens , and was going to look in at the lid , when he said to himself , pausing : ‘
22338	22469	21580	21580	he	839	’ The words referred to a broad , round - shouldered , one - sided old fellow in mourning , coming comically ambling towards the corner , dressed in a pea over - coat , and carrying a large stick . He wore thick shoes , and thick leather gaiters , and thick gloves like a hedger ’s . Both as to his dress and to himself , he was of an overlapping rhinoceros build , with folds in his cheeks , and his forehead , and his eyelids , and his lips , and his ears ; but with bright , eager , childishly - inquiring , grey eyes , under his ragged eyebrows , and broad - brimmed hat . A very odd - looking old fellow altogether . ‘
22475	22482	22471	22471	you	1453	’ repeated Mr Wegg , musing . ‘
22550	22585	22542	22542	I	0	’ Which Mr Wegg , having replaced his tin box , accordingly did , as he rose to bait his gingerbread - trap for some other devoted infant . The salute was acknowledged with : ‘
22594	22596	22634	22638	a ’ arty old cock	9022	’ ( ‘
22601	22609	22610	22610	HE	8755	’ said Mr Wegg , to himself ; ‘
22619	22621	22634	22638	a ’ arty old cock	9022	’ ) ‘
22628	22629	22634	22638	a ’ arty old cock	9022	’ ‘
22635	22642	22644	22645	Mr Wegg	319	’ arty old cock , too , ’

22659	22667	22675	22675	his	1459	‘ Do you remember me , then ? ’
22700	22724	22731	22732	the other	8572	‘ I have noticed you go past our house , sir , several times in the course of the last week or so . ’
22725	22729	22731	22732	the other	8572	‘ Our house , ’
22734	22738	22731	22732	the other	8572	‘ Meaning — ? ’
22739	22742	22744	22745	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Yes , ’
22765	22772	22774	22776	the old fellow	1463	‘ Oh ! Now , what , ’
22798	22806	22774	22776	the old fellow	1463	‘ what do they allow you now ? ’
22807	22819	22821	22821	Silas	319	‘ It ’s job work that I do for our house , ’
22829	22840	22821	22821	Silas	319	‘ it ’s not yet brought to an exact allowance . ’
22841	22872	22774	22776	the old fellow	1463	‘ Oh ! It ’s not yet brought to an exact allowance ? No ! It ’s not yet brought to an exact allowance . Oh!—Morning , morning , morning ! ’
22873	22883	22885	22885	Silas	319	‘ Appears to be rather a cracked old cock , ’
22912	22921	22904	22904	he	319	‘ How did you get your wooden leg ? ’
22934	22939	22922	22923	Mr Wegg	319	‘ In an accident . ’
22940	22946	22904	22904	he	319	‘ Do you like it ? ’
22947	22959	22960	22961	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Well ! I have n’t got to keep it warm , ’

23037	23048	23026	23027	Mr Wegg	319	‘ I never did hear of the name of Boffin . ’

23070	23078	23063	23064	Mr Wegg	319	‘ I ca n’t say I do . ’
23079	23087	22985	22986	the other	8572	‘ Why do n’t you like it ? ’
23088	23098	23100	23101	Mr Wegg	319	‘ I do n’t know why I do n’t , ’
23106	23114	23100	23101	Mr Wegg	319	‘ but I do n’t at all . ’
23115	23131	23133	23134	the stranger	1128	‘ Now , I ’ll tell you something that ’ll make you sorry for that , ’
23138	23144	23133	23134	the stranger	1128	‘ My name ’s Boffin . ’
23145	23152	23154	23155	Mr Wegg	319	‘ I ca n’t help it ! ’

23193	23211	23187	23188	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Do you like the name of Nicodemus ? Think it over . Nick , or Noddy . ’
23212	23219	23220	23221	Mr Wegg	319	‘ It is not , sir , ’
23244	23287	23288	23289	Mr Wegg	319	‘ it is not a name as I could wish any one that I had a respect for , to call ME by ; but there may be persons that would not view it with the same objections.—I do n’t know why , ’
23296	23300	23302	23303	that gentleman	1468	‘ Noddy Boffin , ’
23305	23325	23302	23303	that gentleman	1468	‘ Noddy . That ’s my name . Noddy — or Nick — Boffin . What ’s your name ? ’
23326	23332	23334	23335	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Silas Wegg.—I do n’t , ’
23347	23363	23338	23338	himself	319	‘ I do n’t know why Silas , and I do n’t know why Wegg . ’
23364	23369	23371	23372	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Now , Wegg , ’
23379	23400	23371	23372	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I want to make a sort of offer to you . Do you remember when you first see me ? ’
23424	23490	23401	23403	The wooden Wegg	319	‘ Let me think . I ai n’t quite sure , and yet I generally take a powerful sight of notice , too . Was it on a Monday morning , when the butcher - boy had been to our house for orders , and bought a ballad of me , which , being unacquainted with the tune , I run it over to him ? ’
23491	23505	23611	23612	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Right , Wegg , right ! But he bought more than one . ’
23506	23609	23611	23612	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Yes , to be sure , sir ; he bought several ; and wishing to lay out his money to the best , he took my opinion to guide his choice , and we went over the collection together . To be sure we did . Here was him as it might be , and here was myself as it might be , and there was you , Mr Boffin , as you identically are , with your self - same stick under your very same arm , and your very same back towards us . To — be — sure ! ’
23635	23643	23618	23619	Mr Boffin	324	‘ your wery self - same back ! ’
23644	23655	23611	23612	Mr Wegg	319	‘ What do you think I was doing , Wegg ? ’
23656	23674	23618	23619	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I should judge , sir , that you might be glancing your eye down the street . ’
23675	23685	23618	23619	Mr Boffin	324	‘ No , Wegg . I was a listening . ’
23686	23692	23694	23695	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Was you , indeed ? ’
23699	23732	23694	23695	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Not in a dishonourable way , Wegg , because you was singing to the butcher ; and you would n’t sing secrets to a butcher in the street , you know . ’
23733	23750	23752	23753	Mr Wegg	319	‘ It never happened that I did so yet , to the best of my remembrance , ’
23757	23780	23752	23753	Mr Wegg	319	‘ But I might do it . A man ca n’t say what he might wish to do some day or another . ’
23800	23803	23805	23805	Boffin	324	‘ Well , ’
23807	23834	23805	23805	Boffin	324	‘ I was a listening to you and to him . And what do you — you have n’t got another stool , have you ? I ’m

23874	23877	23879	23880	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Lard ! ’
23903	23939	23890	23890	he	324	‘ it ’s a pleasant place , this ! And then to be shut in on each side , with these ballads , like so many book - leaf blinkers ! Why , its delightful ! ’
23940	23949	23950	23951	Mr Wegg	319	‘ If I am not mistaken , sir , ’
23969	23983	23967	23967	Boffin	324	‘ you alluded to some offer or another that was in your mind ? ’
23984	23986	23890	23890	he	324	‘ I ’m
23995	24041	23967	23967	Boffin	324	’m coming to it ! I was going to say that when I listened that morning , I listened with hadmiration amounting to haw . I thought to myself , “ Here ’s a man with a wooden leg — a literary man with — “ ’
24042	24051	24053	24054	Mr Wegg	319	‘ N — not exactly so , sir , ’
24056	24084	24053	24054	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Why , you know every one of these songs by name and by tune , and if you want to read or to sing any one on ’em

24223	24231	24221	24221	sir	8755	’ Mr Wegg admitted , with modesty ; ‘

24406	24411	24380	24380	sir	8755	’ answered Mr Boffin , ‘

24629	24643	24625	24625	Wegg	319	’ tapping him on the breast with the head of his thick stick , ‘

24985	25010	25011	25012	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Per week . Yes . As to the amount of strain upon the intellect now . Was you thinking at all of poetry ? ’
25017	25023	25011	25012	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Would it come dearer ? ’
25028	25034	25024	25025	Mr Boffin	324	‘ It would come dearer , ’
25039	25071	25035	25036	Mr Wegg	319	‘ For when a person comes to grind off poetry night after night , it is but right he should expect to be paid for its weakening effect on his mind . ’
25072	25080	25082	25082	Boffin	324	‘ To tell you the truth Wegg , ’
25084	25130	25082	25082	Boffin	324	‘ I was n’t thinking of poetry , except in so fur as this:—If you was to happen now and then to feel yourself in the mind to tip me and Mrs Boffin one of your ballads , why then we should drop into poetry . ’

25142	25185	25140	25140	Wegg	319	‘ But not being a regular musical professional , I should be loath to engage myself for that ; and therefore when I dropped into poetry , I should ask to be considered so fur , in the light of a friend . ’

25286	25294	25277	25277	he	319	‘ Mr Boffin , I never bargain . ’
25295	25304	25306	25307	Mr Boffin	324	‘ So I should have thought of you ! ’

Ever since I was not so high as your stick . Ever since my eldest brother left our cottage to enlist into the army . On which occasion , as the ballad that was made about it describes : ‘
25738	25789	25721	25723	my eldest brother	9070	’ Much impressed by this family circumstance , and also by the friendly disposition of Mr Wegg , as exemplified in his so soon dropping into poetry , Mr Boffin again shook hands with that ligneous sharper , and besought him to name his hour . Mr Wegg named eight . ‘
25794	25799	25802	25803	The Bower	1498	’ said Mr Boffin , ‘

26486	26491	26482	26483	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Boffin ’s Bower . ’
26492	26510	26511	26511	Edward	340	‘ Eddard ! ( keep yer hi on his ears ) cut away to Boffin ’s Bower ! ’
26522	26540	26541	26541	Edward	340	‘ Eddard ! ( keep yer hi on his ears ) cut away to Old Harmon ’s . ’
26574	26583	26585	26586	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Was - it - Ev - verajail ? ’
26591	26606	26608	26609	his escort	1523	‘ Not a proper jail , wot you and me would get committed to , ’
26611	26614	26608	26609	his escort	1523	‘ they giv ’
26628	26629	26622	26623	Old Harmon	337	’ ‘
26642	26646	26636	26636	they	1525	’ asked Wegg . ‘
26674	26675	26636	26636	they	1525	’ ‘
26684	26688	26689	26689	I	0	’ asked Wegg . ‘
26717	26833	26834	26834	Supper	342	’ The effect of the name was so very alarming , in respect of causing a temporary disappearance of Edward ’s head , casting his hind hoofs in the air , greatly accelerating the pace and increasing the jolting , that Mr Wegg was fain to devote his attention exclusively to holding on , and to relinquish his desire of ascertaining whether this homage to Boffin was to be considered complimentary or the reverse . Presently , Edward stopped at a gateway , and Wegg discreetly lost no time in slipping out at the back of the truck . The moment he was landed , his late driver with a wave of the carrot , said ‘
26838	27015	27016	27017	Mrs Boffin	324	’ and he , the hind hoofs , the truck , and Edward , all seemed to fly into the air together , in a kind of apotheosis . Pushing the gate , which stood ajar , Wegg looked into an enclosed space where certain tall dark mounds rose high against the sky , and where the pathway to the Bower was indicated , as the moonlight showed , between two lines of broken crockery set in ashes . A white figure advancing along this path , proved to be nothing more ghostly than Mr Boffin , easily attired for the pursuit of knowledge , in an undress garment of short white smock - frock . Having received his literary friend with great cordiality , he conducted him to the interior of the Bower and there presented him to Mrs Boffin:—a stout lady of a rubicund and cheerful aspect , dressed ( to Mr Wegg ’s consternation ) in a low evening - dress of sable satin , and a large black velvet hat and feathers . ‘
27021	27025	27019	27019	Wegg	319	’ said Boffin , ‘
27082	27083	27060	27060	Henerietty	328	’ ‘
27097	27440	27088	27088	I	0	’ said Mrs Boffin . It was the queerest of rooms , fitted and furnished more like a luxurious amateur tap - room than anything else within the ken of Silas Wegg . There were two wooden settles by the fire , one on either side of it , with a corresponding table before each . On one of these tables , the eight volumes were ranged flat , in a row , like a galvanic battery ; on the other , certain squat case - bottles of inviting appearance seemed to stand on tiptoe to exchange glances with Mr Wegg over a front row of tumblers and a basin of white sugar . On the hob , a kettle steamed ; on the hearth , a cat reposed . Facing the fire between the settles , a sofa , a footstool , and a little table , formed a centrepiece devoted to Mrs Boffin . They were garish in taste and colour , but were expensive articles of drawing - room furniture that had a very odd look beside the settles and the flaring gaslight pendent from the ceiling . There was a flowery carpet on the floor ; but , instead of reaching to the fireside , its glowing vegetation stopped short at Mrs Boffin ’s footstool , and gave place to a region of sand and sawdust . Mr Wegg also noticed , with admiring eyes , that , while the flowery land displayed such hollow ornamentation as stuffed birds and waxen fruits under glass - shades , there were , in the territory where vegetation ceased , compensatory shelves on which the best part of a large pie and likewise of a cold joint were plainly discernible among other solids . The room itself was large , though low ; and the heavy frames of its old - fashioned windows , and the heavy beams in its crooked ceiling , seemed to indicate that it had once been a house of some mark standing alone in the country . ‘
27448	27458	27442	27442	you	1534	’ asked Mr Boffin , in his pouncing manner . ‘
27466	27470	27464	27464	sir	8755	’ said Wegg . ‘
27479	27480	27477	27477	sir	8755	’ ‘
27488	27489	27482	27482	you	1534	’ ‘
27499	27529	27482	27482	you	1534	’ Mr Wegg was beginning slowly and knowingly , with his head stuck on one side , as evasive people do begin , when the other cut him short : ‘
27573	27591	27560	27560	I	0	’m not . I do n’t go higher than comfort , and comfort of the sort that I ’m
27775	27825	27772	27773	old lady	1532	’ Mrs Boffin who , perpetually smiling , had approached and drawn her plump arm through her lord ’s , most willingly complied . Fashion , in the form of her black velvet hat and feathers , tried to prevent it ; but got deservedly crushed in the endeavour . ‘
27831	27846	27847	27847	you	319	’ said Mr Boffin , wiping his mouth with an air of much refreshment , ‘
28029	28030	28025	28025	you	319	’ ‘
28036	28052	28025	28025	you	319	’ returned Wegg , as if there were nothing new in his reading at all . ‘
28062	28063	28072	28072	Wegg	319	’ ‘
28074	28083	28072	28072	Wegg	319	’ asked Mr Boffin , with innocent eagerness . ‘
28090	28096	28088	28088	sir	8755	’ replied Wegg , coolly , ‘
28126	28261	28123	28124	Mr Boffin	324	’ His wooden conceit and craft kept exact pace with the delighted expectation of his victim . The visions rising before his mercenary mind , of the many ways in which this connexion was to be turned to account , never obscured the foremost idea natural to a dull overreaching man , that he must not make himself too cheap . Mrs Boffin ’s Fashion , as a less inexorable deity than the idol usually worshipped under that name , did not forbid her mixing for her literary guest , or asking if he found the result to his liking . On his returning a gracious answer and taking his place at the literary settle , Mr Boffin began to compose himself as a listener , at the opposite settle , with exultant eyes . ‘
28272	28280	28270	28270	Wegg	319	’ he said , filling his own , ‘
28329	28352	28353	28353	You	324	’ Wegg , who had been going to put on his spectacles , immediately laid them down , with the sprightly observation : ‘
28384	28385	28393	28393	Wegg	319	’ ‘
28395	28413	28393	28393	Wegg	319	’ replied Mr Boffin , with a glance of some little discomfiture at the Decline and Fall . ‘
28431	28435	28429	28429	sir	8755	’ asked Wegg . ‘
28444	28449	28429	28429	sir	8755	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
28479	28489	28493	28493	Wegg	319	’ said Mr Wegg , nodding his head emotionally . ‘
28495	28496	28493	28493	Wegg	319	’ ‘
28563	28667	28528	28528	yours	8755	’ Mr Wegg did not say what organ , but spoke with a cheerful generality . So , the pie was brought down , and the worthy Mr Boffin exercised his patience until Wegg , in the exercise of his knife and fork , had finished the dish : only profiting by the opportunity to inform Wegg that although it was not strictly Fashionable to keep the contents of a larder thus exposed to view , he ( Mr Boffin ) considered it hospitable ; for the reason , that instead of saying , in a comparatively unmeaning manner , to a visitor , ‘
28683	28693	28678	28678	you	8755	’ you took the bold practical course of saying , ‘
28715	28790	28791	28791	Hem	331	’ And now , Mr Wegg at length pushed away his plate and put on his spectacles , and Mr Boffin lighted his pipe and looked with beaming eyes into the opening world before him , and Mrs Boffin reclined in a fashionable manner on her sofa : as one who would be part of the audience if she found she could , and would go to sleep if she found she could n’t . ‘
28793	28797	28791	28791	Hem	331	’ began Wegg , ‘
28820	28832	28838	28838	Wegg	319	’ here he looked hard at the book , and stopped . ‘
28840	28841	28838	28838	Wegg	319	’ ‘
28856	28876	28851	28851	you	324	’ said Wegg with an air of insinuating frankness ( having first again looked hard at the book ) , ‘
28914	28915	28907	28907	you	324	’ ‘
28926	28927	28924	28924	Wegg	319	’ ‘
28936	28937	28932	28934	Roman . Roman	1571	’ ‘
28945	28946	28950	28950	sir	8755	’ ‘
28952	28972	28976	28976	sir	8755	’ Mr Wegg was faltering and in danger of breaking down , when a bright thought flashed upon him . ‘
29029	29059	29061	29062	Mrs Boffin	324	’ Mr Wegg thus came out of his disadvantage with quite a chivalrous air , and not only that , but by dint of repeating with a manly delicacy , ‘
29074	29226	29061	29062	Mrs Boffin	324	’ turned the disadvantage on Boffin , who felt that he had committed himself in a very painful manner . Then , Mr Wegg , in a dry unflinching way , entered on his task ; going straight across country at everything that came before him ; taking all the hard words , biographical and geographical ; getting rather shaken by Hadrian , Trajan , and the Antonines ; stumbling at Polybius ( pronounced Polly Beeious , and supposed by Mr Boffin to be a Roman virgin , and by Mrs Boffin to be responsible for that necessity of dropping it ) ; heavily unseated by Titus Antoninus Pius ; up again and galloping smoothly with Augustus ; finally , getting over the ground well with Commodus : who , under the appellation of Commodious , was held by Mr Boffin to have been quite unworthy of his English origin , and ‘
29235	29387	29416	29416	Commodious	352	’ in his government of the Roman people . With the death of this personage , Mr Wegg terminated his first reading ; long before which consummation several total eclipses of Mrs Boffin ’s candle behind her black velvet disc , would have been very alarming , but for being regularly accompanied by a potent smell of burnt pens when her feathers took fire , which acted as a restorative and woke her . Mr Wegg , having read on by rote and attached as few ideas as possible to the text , came out of the encounter fresh ; but , Mr Boffin , who had soon laid down his unfinished pipe , and had ever since sat intently staring with his eyes and mind at the confounding enormities of the Romans , was so severely punished that he could hardly wish his literary friend Good - night , and articulate ‘
29390	29391	29416	29416	Commodious	352	’ ‘
29394	29415	29416	29416	Commodious	352	’ gasped Mr Boffin , staring at the moon , after letting Wegg out at the gate and fastening it : ‘
29479	29507	29472	29472	Commodious	352	’em all off in a hundred goes ! As if that was n’t stunning enough , Vittle - us ( and well named too ) eats six millions ’
29557	29575	29546	29546	I	0	’ Mr Boffin added as he turned his pensive steps towards the Bower and shook his head , ‘
29593	29599	29592	29592	I	0	’m in for it now ! ’
30412	30417	30391	30392	the Porters	354	‘ The Early Purl House ’
30671	30680	30682	30684	Miss Abbey Potterson	357	‘ Now , you mind , you Riderhood , ’
30695	30757	30682	30684	Miss Abbey Potterson	357	‘ the Fellowship do n’t want you at all , and would rather by far have your room than your company ; but if you were as welcome here as you are not , you should n’t even then have another drop of drink here this night , after this present pint of beer . So make the most of it . ’
30758	30766	30645	30645	Abbey	357	‘ But you know , Miss Potterson , ’
30774	30789	30682	30684	Miss Abbey Potterson	357	‘ if I behave myself , you ca n’t help serving me , miss . ’
30790	30794	30796	30796	Abbey	357	‘ CAN’T I ! ’
30802	30816	30796	30796	Abbey	357	‘ No , Miss Potterson ; because , you see , the law — ’
30817	30827	30829	30830	Miss Abbey	357	‘ I am the law here , my man , ’
30832	30849	30829	30830	Miss Abbey	357	‘ and I ’ll soon convince you of that , if you doubt it at all . ’
30850	30864	30796	30796	Abbey	357	‘ I never said I did doubt it at all , Miss Abbey . ’
30865	30873	30874	30876	Abbey the supreme	359	‘ So much the better for you . ’

30987	31005	30984	30985	Miss Potterson	357	’ Miss Potterson read her newspaper with contracted brows , and took no notice until he whispered : ‘
31020	31074	31012	31012	I	0	’ Deigning then to turn her eyes sideways towards the suppliant , Miss Potterson beheld him knuckling his low forehead , and ducking at her with his head , as if he were asking leave to fling himself head foremost over the half - door and alight on his feet in the bar . ‘
31077	31093	31095	31095	your	357	’ said Miss Potterson , with a manner as short as she herself was long , ‘
31103	31104	31105	31106	Miss Potterson	357	’ ‘
31112	31131	31137	31138	Miss Potterson	357	’ sxcuse me taking the liberty of asking , is it my character that you take objections to ? ’
31132	31135	31137	31138	Miss Potterson	357	‘ Certainly , ’
31140	31145	31137	31138	Miss Potterson	357	‘ Is it that you ’re
31149	31150	31151	31151	I	0	’ ‘
31158	31163	31165	31165	you	357	’ interposed Miss Potterson , ‘
31169	31170	31165	31165	you	357	’ ‘
31182	31183	31179	31180	Miss Abbey	357	’ ‘

31364	31365	31352	31352	He	248	’ ‘

31392	31405	31382	31382	I	0	’ said Miss Abbey Potterson , knitting her brows again with disdain . ‘

31466	31481	31482	31482	you	357	’ suggested Miss Abbey , though with a deeper shade of perplexity than before , ‘
31486	31487	31484	31484	yourself	357	’ ‘
31544	31595	31615	31616	Miss Abbey	357	’em . How was his luck ? Always good . Notice this ! Always good ! Ah ! There ’s a many games , Miss Abbey , in which there ’s chance , but there ’s a many others in which there ’s skill too , mixed along with it . ’
31596	31613	31615	31616	Miss Abbey	357	‘ That Gaffer has a skill in finding what he finds , who doubts , man ? ’
31618	31629	31631	31631	Riderhood	360	‘ A skill in purwiding what he finds , perhaps , ’

32529	32536	32526	32527	Miss Abbey	357	‘ Can you eat a bit ? ’

32614	32620	32609	32610	Miss Abbey	357	‘ do you do it ? ’
32621	32628	32609	32610	Miss Abbey	357	‘ I do it , Miss ! ’
32629	32687	32609	32610	Miss Abbey	357	‘ There , there . Do n’t look astonished . I ought to have begun with a word of explanation , but it ’s my way to make short cuts at things . I always was a pepperer . You Bob Gliddery there , put the chain upon the door and get ye down to your supper . ’
32722	32729	32732	32733	Miss Potterson	357	‘ Lizzie Hexam , Lizzie Hexam , ’
32735	32757	32732	32733	Miss Potterson	357	‘ how often have I held out to you the opportunity of getting clear of your father , and doing well ? ’
32758	32763	32609	32610	Miss Abbey	357	‘ Very often , Miss. ’
32764	32794	32609	32610	Miss Abbey	357	‘ Very often ? Yes ! And I might as well have spoken to the iron funnel of the strongest sea - going steamer that passes the Fellowship Porters . ’
32795	32800	32801	32801	Lizzie	246	‘ No , Miss , ’
32804	32816	32801	32801	Lizzie	246	‘ because that would not be thankful , and I am . ’
32817	32836	32838	32839	Miss Abbey	357	‘ I vow and declare I am half ashamed of myself for taking such an interest in you , ’
32843	32867	32838	32839	Miss Abbey	357	‘ for I do n’t believe I should do it if you were not good - looking . Why ai n’t you ugly ? ’

32891	32928	32888	32889	Miss Potterson	357	‘ so it ’s no use going into that . I must take you as I find you . Which indeed is what I ’ve done . And you mean to say you are still obstinate ? ’
32929	32938	32999	33000	a pepperer	9134	‘ Not obstinate , Miss , I hope . ’
32939	32950	32888	32889	Miss Potterson	357	‘ Firm ( I suppose you call it ) then ? ’
32951	32958	32999	33000	a pepperer	9134	‘ Yes , Miss. Fixed like . ’
32959	32974	32976	32977	Miss Potterson	357	‘ Never was an obstinate person yet , who would own to the word ! ’

33117	33131	33115	33115	Miss	1697	’ she asked after a silence , with her eyes upon the ground . ‘
33173	33236	33153	33153	some	1699	’ The relief of hearing what she felt sure was a false suspicion , in place of the expected real and true one , so lightened Lizzie ’s breast for the moment , that Miss Abbey was amazed at her demeanour . She raised her eyes quickly , shook her head , and , in a kind of triumph , almost laughed . ‘
33246	33248	33249	33249	She	1701	’ ( ‘
33253	33258	33249	33249	She	1701	’ thought Miss Abbey , ‘
33269	33271	33262	33262	She	1701	’ ) ‘
33275	33286	33262	33262	She	1701	’ said Lizzie , as a recollection flashed upon her , ‘
33311	33312	33309	33309	Miss	1707	’ ‘
33319	33320	33323	33323	He	360	’ ‘
33381	33392	33393	33393	I	0	’ She bent forward to say it in a whisper . ‘
33396	33401	33393	33393	I	0	’ said Miss Abbey . ‘
33552	33611	33612	33612	You	1720	’ She asked this question , rather of the fire than of the hostess of the Fellowship Porters , and looked round the little bar with troubled eyes . But , Miss Potterson , as a ready schoolmistress accustomed to bring her pupils to book , set the matter in a light that was essentially of this world . ‘
33617	33621	33612	33612	You	1720	’ she said , ‘
33698	33699	33700	33700	You	1720	’ ‘

33730	33735	33728	33728	Lizzie	246	’ said Miss Potterson . ‘
33844	33884	33886	33886	you	0	’ In the sound good feeling and good sense of her entreaty , Miss Abbey had softened into a soothing tone , and had even drawn her arm round the girl ’s waist . But , she only replied , ‘
33922	33955	33915	33915	he	878	’ And then Miss Abbey , who , like all hard people when they do soften , felt that there was considerable compensation owing to her , underwent reaction and became frigid . ‘
33963	33967	33956	33956	I	0	’ she said , ‘
34002	34003	33994	33994	he	878	’ ‘

34026	34031	34006	34006	Miss	1734	’ returned Miss Abbey , ‘
34130	34170	34129	34129	I	0	’m not going to take upon myself to decide betwixt them . They are both tarred with a dirty brush , and I ca n’t have the Fellowships tarred with the same brush . That ’s all I know . ’
34171	34178	34180	34181	Lizzie Hexam	246	‘ Good - night , Miss ! ’
34185	34190	34180	34181	Lizzie Hexam	246	‘ Hah!—Good - night ! ’
34201	34216	34198	34198	her	357	‘ Believe me , Miss Abbey , I am truly grateful all the same . ’
34217	34225	34227	34229	the stately Abbey	357	‘ I can believe a good deal , ’
34231	34243	34227	34229	the stately Abbey	357	‘ so I ’ll try to believe that too , Lizzie . ’
34323	34328	34319	34319	he	1745	‘ so rattled to bed ’
34833	34906	34910	34910	she	357	‘ By the time of Miss Abbey ’s closing , and by the run of the tide , it must be one . Tide ’s running up . Father at Chiswick , would n’t think of coming down , till after the turn , and that ’s at half after four . I ’ll call Charley at six . I shall hear the church - clocks strike , as I sit here . ’
34931	34947	34910	34910	she	357	‘ Charley ’s hollow down by the flare is not there now . Poor Charley ! ’
35113	35118	35120	35121	her brother	1762	‘ Hal - loa ! ’
35128	35136	35120	35121	her brother	1762	‘ You made me jump , Charley . ’
35137	35177	35299	35299	her	1766	‘ Jump ! Did n’t you make ME jump , when I opened my eyes a moment ago , and saw you sitting there , like the ghost of a girl miser , in the dead of the night . ’
35178	35198	35120	35121	her brother	1762	‘ It ’s not the dead of the night , Charley . It ’s nigh six in the morning . ’
35199	35213	35120	35121	her brother	1762	‘ Is it though ? But what are you up to , Liz ? ’
35214	35222	35299	35299	her	1766	‘ Still telling your fortune , Charley . ’
35223	35238	35240	35241	the boy	1061	‘ It seems to be a precious small one , if that ’s it , ’
35243	35257	35240	35241	the boy	1061	‘ What are you putting that little pile of money by itself for ? ’
35258	35264	35299	35299	her	1766	‘ For you , Charley . ’
35265	35271	35299	35299	her	1766	‘ What do you mean ? ’
35272	35293	35240	35241	the boy	1061	‘ Get out of bed , Charley , and get washed and dressed , and then I ’ll tell you . ’
35337	35341	35344	35344	himself	1061	‘ I never , ’
35353	35369	35344	35344	himself	1061	‘ saw such a girl as you are . What IS the move , Liz ? ’
35370	35380	35330	35330	her	1766	‘ Are you almost ready for breakfast , Charley ? ’
35381	35399	35344	35344	himself	1061	‘ You can pour it out . Hal - loa ! I say ? And a bundle ? ’
35400	35407	35344	35344	himself	1061	‘ And a bundle , Charley . ’
35408	35420	35330	35330	her	1766	‘ You do n’t mean it ’s for me , too ? ’
35421	35431	35444	35444	he	1061	‘ Yes , Charley ; I do ; indeed . ’
35475	35540	35467	35467	his	1061	‘ You see , Charley dear , I have made up my mind that this is the right time for your going away from us . Over and above all the blessed change of by - and - bye , you ’ll be much happier , and do much better , even so soon as next month . Even so soon as next week . ’
35541	35549	35467	35467	his	1061	‘ How do you know I shall ? ’
35550	35564	35467	35467	his	1061	‘ I do n’t quite know how , Charley , but I do . ’
35618	35642	35656	35657	the boy	1061	‘ You must leave father to me , Charley — I will do what I can with him — but you must go . ’
35643	35654	35656	35657	the boy	1061	‘ You do n’t stand upon ceremony , I think , ’
35678	35684	35686	35687	the boy	1061	‘ I tell you what , ’
35698	35700	35686	35687	the boy	1061	‘ you ’re
35726	35727	35718	35718	you	1769	’ ‘
35770	35808	35823	35823	Liz	246	’ It was only when the boy rushed at her , and threw his arms round her neck , that she lost her self - restraint . But she lost it then , and wept over him . ‘
35841	35842	35833	35833	you	246	’ ‘
35856	35857	35853	35853	I	0	’ ‘
35876	35896	35874	35874	me	0	’ After a silence , she loosed him , to dry her eyes and regain her strong quiet influence . ‘
36041	36042	36043	36043	I	0	’ ‘
36046	36053	36043	36043	I	0	’ cried her brother , quickly . ‘
36081	36114	36077	36079	that Wrayburn one	1784	’ Perhaps a slight additional tinge of red flushed up into her face and brow , as with a nod she laid a hand upon his lips to keep him silently attentive . ‘
36221	36242	36213	36213	Charley	291	’ The boy looked at her with some doubt and surprise , but she went on again without heeding it . ‘
36304	36599	36301	36302	my Darling	1790	’ Though so young , she infused in these parting words a love that was far more like a mother ’s than a sister ’s , and before which the boy was quite bowed down . After holding her to his breast with a passionate cry , he took up his bundle and darted out at the door , with an arm across his eyes . The white face of the winter day came sluggishly on , veiled in a frosty mist ; and the shadowy ships in the river slowly changed to black substances ; and the sun , blood - red on the eastern marshes behind dark masts and yards , seemed filled with the ruins of a forest it had set on fire . Lizzie , looking for her father , saw him coming , and stood upon the causeway that he might see her . He had nothing with him but his boat , and came on apace . A knot of those amphibious human - creatures who appear to have some mysterious power of extracting a subsistence out of tidal water by looking at it , were gathered together about the causeway . As her father ’s boat grounded , they became contemplative of the mud , and dispersed themselves . She saw that the mute avoidance had begun . Gaffer saw it , too , in so far as that he was moved when he set foot on shore , to stare around him . But , he promptly set to work to haul up his boat , and make her fast , and take the sculls and rudder and rope out of her . Carrying these with Lizzie ’s aid , he passed up to his dwelling . ‘
36635	36636	36630	36630	You	1792	’ ‘
36668	36701	36702	36702	You	1792	’ Something suggestive in their colour , and perhaps in her face , struck him as he held them up ; he turned his shoulder and held them down to the fire . ‘
36716	36717	36714	36714	father	878	’ ‘
36738	36739	36735	36736	that boy	1796	’ ‘

36799	36825	36786	36786	father	878	’ said Gaffer , dropping the liquor into his cup from a squat black bottle , and dropping it slowly that it might seem more ; ‘
36846	36847	36786	36786	father	878	’ ‘
36880	36912	36870	36870	we	1802	’ But , he perceived that he was evaded , and , having thrown a hasty angry glance towards the bunk , plucked at a corner of her apron and asked : ‘
36920	36921	36922	36922	Father	293	’ ‘
36939	36974	36931	36931	I	0	’ He looked at her , stirred his tea and took two or three gulps , then cut at his piece of hot steak with his case - knife , and said , eating : ‘
36985	36986	36982	36983	that boy	1796	’ ‘
37008	37009	36997	36997	father	878	’ ‘
37014	37026	37010	37012	Unnat’ral young beggar	1807	’ said the parent , shaking his knife in the air . ‘
37051	37052	37042	37042	he	1796	’ ’
37057	37068	37053	37055	unnat’ral young beggar	1807	’ said the parent again , with his former action . ‘
37130	37131	37133	37133	him	1796	’ ‘
37145	37158	37133	37133	him	1796	’ said the father , again emphasizing his words with the knife . ‘
37212	37277	37278	37278	He	1796	’ He had pushed away his plate . With the natural need of a strong rough man in anger , to do something forcible , he now clutched his knife overhand , and struck downward with it at the end of every succeeding sentence . As he would have struck with his own clenched fist if there had chanced to be nothing in it . ‘
37387	37425	37384	37384	Lizzie	246	’ But , she stopped him with a cry . Looking at her he saw her , with a face quite strange to him , shrinking back against the wall , with her hands before her eyes . ‘
37446	37461	37462	37462	Father	293	’ He looked at the knife ; but in his astonishment still held it . ‘
37478	37503	37462	37462	Father	293	’ Confounded by her appearance and exclamation , he tossed it away , and stood up with his open hands held out before him . ‘
37524	37525	37513	37513	you	246	’ ‘
37538	37539	37532	37532	you	293	’ ‘
37545	37546	37532	37532	you	293	’ ‘
37583	37591	37532	37532	you	293	’ her hands covering her face again , ‘
37596	37597	37532	37532	you	293	’ ‘
37604	37663	37532	37532	you	293	’ The recollection of his murderous figure , combining with her trial of last night , and her trial of the morning , caused her to drop at his feet , without having answered . He had never seen her so before . He raised her with the utmost tenderness , calling her the best of daughters , and ‘
37668	37798	37532	37532	you	293	’ , and laid her head upon his knee , and tried to restore her . But failing , he laid her head gently down again , got a pillow and placed it under her dark hair , and sought on the table for a spoonful of brandy . There being none left , he hurriedly caught up the empty bottle , and ran out at the door . He returned as hurriedly as he had gone , with the bottle still empty . He kneeled down by her , took her head on his arm , and moistened her lips with a little water into which he dipped his fingers : saying , fiercely , as he looked around , now over this shoulder , now over that : ‘
37828	37916	37917	37917	Boffin	324	’ Chapter 7 MR WEGG LOOKS AFTER HIMSELF Silas Wegg , being on his road to the Roman Empire , approaches it by way of Clerkenwell . The time is early in the evening ; the weather moist and raw . Mr Wegg finds leisure to make a little circuit , by reason that he folds his screen early , now that he combines another source of income with it , and also that he feels it due to himself to be anxiously expected at the Bower . ‘
37928	37966	37917	37917	Boffin	324	’ says Silas , screwing up , as he stumps along , first his right eye , and then his left . Which is something superfluous in him , for Nature has already screwed both pretty tight . ‘
37980	37988	37968	37968	I	0	’ Silas pursues , stumping and meditating , ‘
38005	38136	37968	37968	I	0	’ Animated by this reflection , he stumps faster , and looks a long way before him , as a man with an ambitious project in abeyance often will do . Aware of a working - jeweller population taking sanctuary about the church in Clerkenwell , Mr Wegg is conscious of an interest in , and a respect for , the neighbourhood . But , his sensations in this regard halt as to their strict morality , as he halts in his gait ; for , they suggest the delights of a coat of invisibility in which to walk off safely with the precious stones and watch - cases , but stop short of any compunction for the people who would lose the same . Not , however , towards the ‘
38138	38385	37968	37968	I	0	’ where cunning artificers work in pearls and diamonds and gold and silver , making their hands so rich , that the enriched water in which they wash them is bought for the refiners;—not towards these does Mr Wegg stump , but towards the poorer shops of small retail traders in commodities to eat and drink and keep folks warm , and of Italian frame - makers , and of barbers , and of brokers , and of dealers in dogs and singing - birds . From these , in a narrow and a dirty street devoted to such callings , Mr Wegg selects one dark shop - window with a tallow candle dimly burning in it , surrounded by a muddle of objects vaguely resembling pieces of leather and dry stick , but among which nothing is resolvable into anything distinct , save the candle itself in its old tin candlestick , and two preserved frogs fighting a small - sword duel . Stumping with fresh vigour , he goes in at the dark greasy entry , pushes a little greasy dark reluctant side - door , and follows the door into the little dark greasy shop . It is so dark that nothing can be made out in it , over a little counter , but another tallow candle in another old tin candlestick , close to the face of a man stooping low in a chair . Mr Wegg nods to the face , ‘
38389	38492	37968	37968	I	0	’ The face looking up is a sallow face with weak eyes , surmounted by a tangle of reddish - dusty hair . The owner of the face has no cravat on , and has opened his tumbled shirt - collar to work with the more ease . For the same reason he has no coat on : only a loose waistcoat over his yellow linen . His eyes are like the over - tried eyes of an engraver , but he is not that ; his expression and stoop are like those of a shoemaker , but he is not that . ‘
38504	38539	38501	38501	you	379	’ With slowly dawning remembrance , Mr Venus rises , and holds his candle over the little counter , and holds it down towards the legs , natural and artificial , of Mr Wegg . ‘
38544	38550	38501	38501	you	379	’ he says , then . ‘
38556	38557	38553	38553	you	379	’ ‘
38563	38568	38558	38558	Wegg	319	’ that gentleman explains . ‘
38573	38578	38558	38558	Wegg	319	’ says the other . ‘
38582	38583	38558	38558	Wegg	319	’ ‘
38587	38592	38560	38560	you	319	’ says Mr Wegg . ‘
38597	38601	38560	38560	you	319	’ quoth Venus . ‘
38621	38679	38560	38560	you	319	’ The little counter being so short a counter that it leaves the fireplace , which would have been behind it if it had been longer , accessible , Mr Wegg sits down on a box in front of the fire , and inhales a warm and comfortable smell which is not the smell of the shop . ‘
38683	38698	38560	38560	you	319	’ Mr Wegg inwardly decides , as he takes a corrective sniff or two , ‘
38714	38719	38560	38560	you	319	’ with another sniff , ‘
38732	38733	38734	38734	My	0	’ ‘
38754	39117	38751	38751	you	319	’ It being one of Mr Wegg ’s guiding rules in life always to partake , he says he will . But , the little shop is so excessively dark , is stuck so full of black shelves and brackets and nooks and corners , that he sees Mr Venus ’s cup and saucer only because it is close under the candle , and does not see from what mysterious recess Mr Venus produces another for himself until it is under his nose . Concurrently , Wegg perceives a pretty little dead bird lying on the counter , with its head drooping on one side against the rim of Mr Venus ’s saucer , and a long stiff wire piercing its breast . As if it were Cock Robin , the hero of the ballad , and Mr Venus were the sparrow with his bow and arrow , and Mr Wegg were the fly with his little eye . Mr Venus dives , and produces another muffin , yet untoasted ; taking the arrow out of the breast of Cock Robin , he proceeds to toast it on the end of that cruel instrument . When it is brown , he dives again and produces butter , with which he completes his work . Mr Wegg , as an artful man who is sure of his supper by - and - bye , presses muffin on his host to soothe him into a compliant state of mind , or , as one might say , to grease his works . As the muffins disappear , little by little , the black shelves and nooks and corners begin to appear , and Mr Wegg gradually acquires an imperfect notion that over against him on the chimney - piece is a Hindoo baby in a bottle , curved up with his big head tucked under him , as he would instantly throw a summersault if the bottle were large enough . When he deems Mr Venus ’s wheels sufficiently lubricated , Mr Wegg approaches his object by asking , as he lightly taps his hands together , to express an undesigning frame of mind : ‘
39133	39134	39121	39121	I	0	’ ‘
39138	39145	39121	39121	I	0	’ says Mr Venus , uncompromisingly . ‘
39154	39164	39149	39149	I	0	’ asks Wegg , with an air of surprise . ‘
39169	39189	39149	39149	I	0	’ This would seem to be secretly agreeable to Wegg , but he veils his feelings , and observes , ‘
39199	39200	39195	39195	you	379	’ ‘
39206	39226	39195	39195	you	379	’ replies Venus , who is a haggard melancholy man , speaking in a weak voice of querulous complaint , ‘
39284	39285	39262	39266	Anybody with a passable knowledge	1831	’ ‘
39295	39303	39292	39293	Mr Venus	379	’ Wegg expostulates with some little irritation , ‘
39322	39323	39327	39327	I	0	’ ‘
39441	39464	39438	39439	Mr Wegg	319	’ Silas looks as hard at his one leg as he can in the dim light , and after a pause sulkily opines ‘
39487	39492	39479	39479	you	319	’ he demands impatiently . ‘
39511	39566	39438	39439	Mr Wegg	319	’ Mr Venus takes from a corner by his chair , the bones of a leg and foot , beautifully pure , and put together with exquisite neatness . These he compares with Mr Wegg ’s leg ; that gentleman looking on , as if he were being measured for a riding - boot . ‘
39606	39633	39598	39598	I	0	’ Mr Wegg having looked distrustfully at his own limb , and suspiciously at the pattern with which it has been compared , makes the point : ‘
39646	39647	39694	39696	that French gentleman	1840	’ ‘
39669	39693	39694	39696	that French gentleman	1840	’ As he nods towards a point of darkness behind Mr Wegg , the latter , with a slight start , looks round for ‘
39698	39738	39694	39696	that French gentleman	1840	’ whom he at length descries to be represented ( in a very workmanlike manner ) by his ribs only , standing on a shelf in another corner , like a piece of armour or a pair of stays . ‘
39741	39755	39694	39696	that French gentleman	1840	’ says Mr Wegg , with a sort of sense of being introduced ; ‘
39794	39821	39694	39696	that French gentleman	1840	’ At this moment the greasy door is violently pushed inward , and a boy follows it , who says , after having let it slam : ‘
39828	39829	39694	39696	that French gentleman	1840	’ ‘

39847	39937	39842	39842	you	319	’ The boy produces four shillings . Mr Venus , always in exceedingly low spirits and making whimpering sounds , peers about for the stuffed canary . On his taking the candle to assist his search , Mr Wegg observes that he has a convenient little shelf near his knees , exclusively appropriated to skeleton hands , which have very much the appearance of wanting to lay hold of him . From these Mr Venus rescues the canary in a glass case , and shows it to the boy . ‘

40057	40078	40040	40040	I	0	’ So the boy pipes , as he selects it from his change , and throws it on the counter . ‘

40165	40186	40160	40160	you	0	’ To which Mr Venus only replies , shaking his shock of dusty hair , and winking his weak eyes , ‘
40209	40231	40206	40206	you	319	’m down . You ’ve no idea how small you ’d come out , if I had the articulating of you . ’

40407	40441	40369	40370	human warious	1855	’ Having so held and waved the candle as that all these heterogeneous objects seemed to come forward obediently when they were named , and then retire again , Mr Venus despondently repeats , ‘
40449	40469	40447	40447	me	0	’ resumes his seat , and with drooping despondency upon him , falls to pouring himself out more tea . ‘

41606	41694	41586	41587	Mr Venus	379	‘ And so a man climbs to the top of the tree , Mr Wegg , only to see that there ’s no look - out when he ’s up there ! I sit here of a night surrounded by the lovely trophies of my art , and what have they done for me ? Ruined me . Brought me to the pass of being informed that “ she does not wish to regard herself , nor yet to be regarded , in that boney light ” ! ’

41886	41933	41821	41822	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Not at all , Mr Wegg . The old gentleman wanted to know the nature and worth of everything that was found in the dust ; and many ’s the bone , and feather , and what not , that he ’s brought to me . ’

There are no estates to manage , no rents to return so much per cent upon in bad times ( which is an extremely dear way of getting your name into the newspapers ) , no voters to become parboiled in hot water with , no agents to take the cream off the milk before it comes to table .

44147	44182	44140	44141	Mr Boffin	324	‘ that he ever went and made so much money . It would have been better for him if he had n’t so given himself up to it . You may depend upon it , ’

44223	44466	44467	44468	Mr Lightwood	287	‘ why , Lord save us ! when we come to take it to pieces , bit by bit , where ’s the satisfactoriness of the money as yet ? When the old man does right the poor boy after all , the poor boy gets no good of it . He gets made away with , at the moment when he ’s lifting ( as one may say ) the cup and sarser to his lips . Mr Lightwood , I will now name to you , that on behalf of the poor dear boy , me and Mrs Boffin have stood out against the old man times out of number , till he has called us every name he could lay his tongue to . I have seen him , after Mrs Boffin has given him her mind respecting the claims of the nat’ral affections , catch off Mrs Boffin ’s bonnet ( she wore , in general , a black straw , perched as a matter of convenience on the top of her head ) , and send it spinning across the yard . I have indeed . And once , when he did this in a manner that amounted to personal , I should have given him a rattler for himself , if Mrs Boffin had n’t thrown herself betwixt us , and received flush on the temple . Which dropped her , Mr Lightwood . Dropped her . ’
44470	44481	44467	44468	Mr Lightwood	287	‘ Equal honour — Mrs Boffin ’s head and heart . ’

44495	44577	44579	44580	Mr Boffin	324	‘ to show you , now the affairs are wound up , that me and Mrs Boffin have ever stood as we were in Christian honour bound , the children ’s friend . Me and Mrs Boffin stood the poor girl ’s friend ; me and Mrs Boffin stood the poor boy ’s friend ; me and Mrs Boffin up and faced the old man when we momently expected to be turned out for our pains . As to Mrs Boffin , ’
44585	44619	44582	44582	his	324	‘ she might n’t wish it mentioned now she ’s Fashionable , but she went so far as to tell him , in my presence , he was a flinty - hearted rascal . ’
44623	44639	44620	44621	Mr Lightwood	287	‘ Vigorous Saxon spirit — Mrs Boffin ’s ancestors — bowmen — Agincourt and Cressy . ’
44640	44653	44655	44656	Mr Boffin	324	‘ The last time me and Mrs Boffin saw the poor boy , ’
44671	45224	44620	44621	Mr Lightwood	287	‘ he was a child of seven year old . For when he came back to make intercession for his sister , me and Mrs Boffin were away overlooking a country contract which was to be sifted before carted , and he was come and gone in a single hour . I say he was a child of seven year old . He was going away , all alone and forlorn , to that foreign school , and he come into our place , situate up the yard of the present Bower , to have a warm at our fire . There was his little scanty travelling clothes upon him . There was his little scanty box outside in the shivering wind , which I was going to carry for him down to the steamboat , as the old man would n’t hear of allowing a sixpence coach - money . Mrs Boffin , then quite a young woman and pictur of a full - blown rose , stands him by her , kneels down at the fire , warms her two open hands , and falls to rubbing his cheeks ; but seeing the tears come into the child ’s eyes , the tears come fast into her own , and she holds him round the neck , like as if she was protecting him , and cries to me , “ I ’d give the wide wide world , I would , to run away with him ! ” I do n’t say but what it cut me , and but what it at the same time heightened my feelings of admiration for Mrs Boffin . The poor child clings to her for awhile , as she clings to him , and then , when the old man calls , he says “ I must go ! God bless you ! ” and for a moment rests his heart against her bosom , and looks up at both of us , as if it was in pain — in agony . Such a look ! I went aboard with him ( I gave him first what little treat I thought he ’d like ) , and I left him when he had fallen asleep in his berth , and I came back to Mrs Boffin . But tell her what I would of how I had left him , it all went for nothing , for , according to her thoughts , he never changed that look that he had looked up at us two . But it did one piece of good . Mrs Boffin and me had no child of our own , and had sometimes wished that how we had one . But not now . “ We might both of us die , ” says Mrs Boffin , “ and other eyes might see that lonely look in our child . ” So of a night , when it was very cold , or when the wind roared , or the rain dripped heavy , she would wake sobbing , and call out in a fluster , “ Do n’t you see the poor child ’s face ? O shelter the poor child!”—till in course of years it gently wore out , as many things do . ’
45225	45236	45238	45238	Mortimer	287	‘ My dear Mr Boffin , everything wears to rags , ’
45245	45257	45238	45238	Mortimer	287	‘ I wo n’t go so far as to say everything , ’
45270	45449	45264	45264	his	324	‘ because there ’s some things that I never found among the dust . Well , sir . So Mrs Boffin and me grow older and older in the old man ’s service , living and working pretty hard in it , till the old man is discovered dead in his bed . Then Mrs Boffin and me seal up his box , always standing on the table at the side of his bed , and having frequently heerd tell of the Temple as a spot where lawyer ’s dust is contracted for , I come down here in search of a lawyer to advise , and I see your young man up at this present elevation , chopping at the flies on the window - sill with his penknife , and I give him a Hoy ! not then having the pleasure of your acquaintance , and by that means come to gain the honour . Then you , and the gentleman in the uncomfortable neck - cloth under the little archway in Saint Paul ’s Churchyard — ’

45683	45692	45604	45605	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Mr Boffin , it ’s too much . ’
45693	45713	45617	45617	I	0	‘ Mr Lightwood , me and Mrs Boffin have fixed the sum together , and we stand to it . ’

45726	45771	45604	45605	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ speaking now with professional profundity , and not with individual imbecility , that the offer of such an immense reward is a temptation to forced suspicion , forced construction of circumstances , strained accusation , a whole tool - box of edged tools . ’

45915	45928	45900	45900	Lightwood	287	‘ has the gratification of taking the instruction . There is another ? ’
45929	45990	46007	46007	his	287	‘ There is just one other , and no more . Make me as compact a little will as can be reconciled with tightness , leaving the whole of the property to “ my beloved wife , Henerietty Boffin , sole executrix ” .

46039	46064	46035	46036	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Exactly so . And nothing can be more laudable . But is the tightness to bind Mrs Boffin to any and what conditions ? ’

46075	46107	46072	46073	her husband	8651	‘ No ! What are you thinking of ! What I want is , to make it all hers so tight as that her hold of it ca n’t be loosed . ’
46108	46122	46035	46036	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Hers freely , to do what she likes with ? Hers absolutely ? ’

46137	46163	46128	46129	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Hah ! I should think so ! It would be handsome in me to begin to bind Mrs Boffin at this time of day ! ’

However , sir , as you do n’t press yourself , I wish to meet you so far as saying , by all means call at the Bower if you like . Call in the course of a week or two . At the same time , I consider that I ought to name , in addition to what I have already named , that I have in my employment a literary man — WITH a wooden leg — as I have no thoughts of parting from . ’

50383	51140	51141	51146	Nod - dy Bof - fin	411	’ It was ruin to Mrs Boffin ’s aspirations , but , having so spoken , they sat side by side , a hopelessly Unfashionable pair . These two ignorant and unpolished people had guided themselves so far on in their journey of life , by a religious sense of duty and desire to do right . Ten thousand weaknesses and absurdities might have been detected in the breasts of both ; ten thousand vanities additional , possibly , in the breast of the woman . But the hard wrathful and sordid nature that had wrung as much work out of them as could be got in their best days , for as little money as could be paid to hurry on their worst , had never been so warped but that it knew their moral straightness and respected it . In its own despite , in a constant conflict with itself and them , it had done so . And this is the eternal law . For , Evil often stops short at itself and dies with the doer of it ; but Good , never . Through his most inveterate purposes , the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail had known these two faithful servants to be honest and true . While he raged at them and reviled them for opposing him with the speech of the honest and true , it had scratched his stony heart , and he had perceived the powerlessness of all his wealth to buy them if he had addressed himself to the attempt . So , even while he was their griping taskmaster and never gave them a good word , he had written their names down in his will . So , even while it was his daily declaration that he mistrusted all mankind — and sorely indeed he did mistrust all who bore any resemblance to himself — he was as certain that these two people , surviving him , would be trustworthy in all things from the greatest to the least , as he was that he must surely die . Mr and Mrs Boffin , sitting side by side , with Fashion withdrawn to an immeasurable distance , fell to discussing how they could best find their orphan . Mrs Boffin suggested advertisement in the newspapers , requesting orphans answering annexed description to apply at the Bower on a certain day ; but Mr Boffin wisely apprehending obstruction of the neighbouring thoroughfares by orphan swarms , this course was negatived . Mrs Boffin next suggested application to their clergyman for a likely orphan . Mr Boffin thinking better of this scheme , they resolved to call upon the reverend gentleman at once , and to take the same opportunity of making acquaintance with Miss Bella Wilfer . In order that these visits might be visits of state , Mrs Boffin ’s equipage was ordered out . This consisted of a long hammer - headed old horse , formerly used in the business , attached to a four - wheeled chaise of the same period , which had long been exclusively used by the Harmony Jail poultry as the favourite laying - place of several discreet hens . An unwonted application of corn to the horse , and of paint and varnish to the carriage , when both fell in as a part of the Boffin legacy , had made what Mr Boffin considered a neat turn - out of the whole ; and a driver being added , in the person of a long hammer - headed young man who was a very good match for the horse , left nothing to be desired . He , too , had been formerly used in the business , but was now entombed by an honest jobbing tailor of the district in a perfect Sepulchre of coat and gaiters , sealed with ponderous buttons . Behind this domestic , Mr and Mrs Boffin took their seats in the back compartment of the vehicle : which was sufficiently commodious , but had an undignified and alarming tendency , in getting over a rough crossing , to hiccup itself away from the front compartment . On their being descried emerging from the gates of the Bower , the neighbourhood turned out at door and window to salute the Boffins . Among those who were ever and again left behind , staring after the equipage , were many youthful spirits , who hailed it in stentorian tones with such congratulations as ‘
51148	51149	51141	51146	Nod - dy Bof - fin	411	’ ‘
51158	51159	51165	51167	Bof - fin	411	’ ‘
51169	51499	51500	51500	I	0	’ and other similar compliments . These , the hammer - headed young man took in such ill part that he often impaired the majesty of the progress by pulling up short , and making as though he would alight to exterminate the offenders ; a purpose from which he only allowed himself to be dissuaded after long and lively arguments with his employers . At length the Bower district was left behind , and the peaceful dwelling of the Reverend Frank Milvey was gained . The Reverend Frank Milvey ’s abode was a very modest abode , because his income was a very modest income . He was officially accessible to every blundering old woman who had incoherence to bestow upon him , and readily received the Boffins . He was quite a young man , expensively educated and wretchedly paid , with quite a young wife and half a dozen quite young children . He was under the necessity of teaching and translating from the classics , to eke out his scanty means , yet was generally expected to have more time to spare than the idlest person in the parish , and more money than the richest . He accepted the needless inequalities and inconsistencies of his life , with a kind of conventional submission that was almost slavish ; and any daring layman who would have adjusted such burdens as his , more decently and graciously , would have had small help from him . With a ready patient face and manner , and yet with a latent smile that showed a quick enough observation of Mrs Boffin ’s dress , Mr Milvey , in his little book - room — charged with sounds and cries as though the six children above were coming down through the ceiling , and the roasting leg of mutton below were coming up through the floor — listened to Mrs Boffin ’s statement of her want of an orphan . ‘
51503	51508	51500	51500	I	0	’ said Mr Milvey , ‘
51525	51528	51522	51523	Mrs Boffin	324	’ Never . ‘
51549	51567	51543	51543	you	0	’ In a general way , yes . Mr Milvey smiled again , as he remarked to himself ‘
51578	51603	51604	51604	I	0	’ It occurring to him , perhaps , that if they had been Curates , their wishes might have tended in the opposite direction . ‘
51607	51611	51604	51604	I	0	’ he pursued , ‘
51637	51644	51632	51632	I	0	’ So , Mr Milvey called , ‘
51650	51750	51751	51751	Mr	2016	’ and Mrs Milvey came down . A pretty , bright little woman , something worn by anxiety , who had repressed many pretty tastes and bright fancies , and substituted in their stead , schools , soup , flannel , coals , and all the week - day cares and Sunday coughs of a large population , young and old . As gallantly had Mr Milvey repressed much in himself that naturally belonged to his old studies and old fellow - students , and taken up among the poor and their children with the hard crumbs of life . ‘
51767	51814	51753	51754	Mrs Boffin	324	’ Mrs Milvey , with the most unaffected grace in the world , congratulated them , and was glad to see them . Yet her engaging face , being an open as well as a perceptive one , was not without her husband ’s latent smile . ‘
51827	51839	51840	51841	An orphan	9444	’ Mrs Milvey , looking rather alarmed , her husband added : ‘
51846	51847	51840	51841	An orphan	9444	’ ‘
51850	51862	51840	51841	An orphan	9444	’ said Mrs Milvey , reassured for her own little boys . ‘
51882	51895	51872	51874	old Mrs Goody	416	‘ Oh my DEAR Frank ! I DON’T think that would do ! ’
51896	51899	51868	51868	Margaretta	415	‘ No ? ’
51900	51904	51905	51908	The smiling Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Oh NO ! ’
51947	51952	51954	51955	Mrs Milvey	413	‘ I DON’T think , ’
51963	52005	51954	51955	Mrs Milvey	413	‘ — and I believe my husband will agree with me when he considers it again — that you could possibly keep that orphan clean from snuff . Because his grandmother takes so MANY ounces , and drops it over him . ’
52006	52020	52022	52023	Mr Milvey	413	‘ But he would not be living with his grandmother then , Margaretta , ’
52025	52148	52022	52023	Mr Milvey	413	‘ No , Frank , but it would be impossible to keep her from Mrs Boffin ’s house ; and the MORE there was to eat and drink there , the oftener she would go . And she IS an inconvenient woman . I HOPE it ’s not uncharitable to remember that last Christmas Eve she drank eleven cups of tea , and grumbled all the time . And she is NOT a grateful woman , Frank . You recollect her addressing a crowd outside this house , about her wrongs , when , one night after we had gone to bed , she brought back the petticoat of new flannel that had been given her , because it was too short . ’
52149	52154	52156	52157	Mr Milvey	413	‘ That ’s true , ’
52159	52172	52156	52157	Mr Milvey	413	‘ I do n’t think that would do . Would little Harrison — ’
52173	52178	52180	52182	his emphatic wife	2024	‘ Oh , FRANK ! ’
52184	52193	52180	52182	his emphatic wife	2024	‘ He has no grandmother , my dear . ’
52194	52212	52022	52023	Mr Milvey	413	‘ No , but I DON’T think Mrs Boffin would like an orphan who squints so MUCH . ’
52213	52219	52221	52222	Mr Milvey	413	‘ That ’s true again , ’
52229	52237	52221	52222	Mr Milvey	413	‘ If a little girl would do — ’
52238	52251	52022	52023	Mr Milvey	413	‘ But , my DEAR Frank , Mrs Boffin wants a boy . ’
52252	52258	52260	52261	Mr Milvey	413	‘ That ’s true again , ’
52263	52270	52260	52261	Mr Milvey	413	‘ Tom Bocker is a nice boy ’
52275	52282	52283	52284	Mrs Milvey	413	‘ But I DOUBT , Frank , ’
52292	52311	52283	52284	Mrs Milvey	413	‘ if Mrs Boffin wants an orphan QUITE nineteen , who drives a cart and waters the roads . ’
52344	52350	52337	52337	he	413	‘ that ’s true again . ’
52351	52356	52358	52359	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ I am sure , ’
52368	52389	52337	52337	he	413	‘ that if I had known you would have taken so much pains , sir — and you too , ma ’
52401	52402	52392	52392	I	0	’ ‘
52409	52414	52392	52392	I	0	’ urged Mrs Milvey . ‘
52422	52427	52392	52392	I	0	’ assented Mr Milvey , ‘
52442	52470	52392	52392	I	0	’ Which Mrs Milvey confirmed ; and really the kind , conscientious couple spoke , as if they kept some profitable orphan warehouse and were personally patronized . ‘
52478	52483	52392	52392	I	0	’ added Mr Milvey , ‘
52543	52544	52511	52511	you	324	’ ‘
52549	52556	52511	52511	you	324	’ said the emphatic little wife . ‘
52564	52580	52561	52561	I	0	’ pursued Mr Milvey , quite with the air as if he might have added , ‘
52584	52607	52511	52511	you	324	’ and quite as anxiously as if there were great competition in the business and he were afraid of losing an order , ‘
52669	52737	52620	52620	relations	2032	’ Accordingly , it was resolved that Mr and Mrs Milvey should search for an orphan likely to suit , and as free as possible from the foregoing objections , and should communicate again with Mrs Boffin . Then , Mr Boffin took the liberty of mentioning to Mr Milvey that if Mr Milvey would do him the kindness to be perpetually his banker to the extent of ‘
52746	52814	52620	52620	relations	2032	’ to be expended without any reference to him , he would be heartily obliged . At this , both Mr Milvey and Mrs Milvey were quite as much pleased as if they had no wants of their own , but only knew what poverty was , in the persons of other people ; and so the interview terminated with satisfaction and good opinion on all sides . ‘
52820	52839	52817	52818	old lady	1532	’ said Mr Boffin , as they resumed their seats behind the hammer - headed horse and man : ‘
52854	52978	52851	52851	Wilfer	307	’ It appeared , on their drawing up at the family gate , that to try Wilfer ’s was a thing more easily projected than done , on account of the extreme difficulty of getting into that establishment ; three pulls at the bell producing no external result ; though each was attended by audible sounds of scampering and rushing within . At the fourth tug — vindictively administered by the hammer - headed young man — Miss Lavinia appeared , emerging from the house in an accidental manner , with a bonnet and parasol , as designing to take a contemplative walk . The young lady was astonished to find visitors at the gate , and expressed her feelings in appropriate action . ‘
52986	53019	52981	52981	Mr	2038	’ growled the hammer - headed young man through the bars of the gate , and at the same time shaking it , as if he were on view in a Menagerie ; ‘
53028	53029	53020	53020	they	2039	’ ‘
53035	53040	53041	53041	Mr	2040	’ asked Miss Lavinia . ‘
53045	53087	53041	53041	Mr	2040	’ returned the young man , rising into a roar . Miss Lavinia tripped up the steps to the house - door , tripped down the steps with the key , tripped across the little garden , and opened the gate . ‘
53093	53100	53101	53102	Our servant	2042	’ said Miss Lavinia , haughtily . ‘
53106	53159	53160	53160	Mr	2043	’ Mr and Mrs Boffin complying , and pausing in the little hall until Miss Lavinia came up to show them where to go next , perceived three pairs of listening legs upon the stairs above . Mrs Wilfer ’s legs , Miss Bella ’s legs , Mr George Sampson ’s legs . ‘
53168	53201	53165	53165	I	0	’ said Lavinia , in a warning voice . Strained attention on the part of Mrs Wilfer ’s legs , of Miss Bella ’s legs , of Mr George Sampson ’s legs . ‘
53205	53206	53204	53204	Miss.	370	’ ‘
53223	53324	53218	53218	I’ll	0	’ Excited flight of Mrs Wilfer ’s legs , of Miss Bella ’s legs , of Mr George Sampson ’s legs . After waiting some quarter of an hour alone in the family sitting - room , which presented traces of having been so hastily arranged after a meal , that one might have doubted whether it was made tidy for visitors , or cleared for blindman ’s buff , Mr and Mrs Boffin became aware of the entrance of Mrs Wilfer , majestically faint , and with a condescending stitch in her side : which was her company manner . ‘
53328	53357	53218	53218	I’ll	0	’ said Mrs Wilfer , after the first salutations , and as soon as she had adjusted the handkerchief under her chin , and waved her gloved hands , ‘
53367	53368	53375	53375	ma’am	1643	’ ‘
53377	53382	53375	53375	ma’am	1643	’ returned Mr Boffin , ‘
53405	53406	53407	53407	I	0	’ ‘
53413	53426	53407	53407	I	0	’ returned Mrs Wilfer , with a dignified bend of her head , ‘
53433	53434	53407	53407	I	0	’ ‘
53442	53456	53436	53436	I	0	’ pursued Mr Boffin , while Mrs Boffin added confirmatory nods and smiles , ‘
53469	53470	53457	53457	you	1643	’ ‘
53474	53479	53457	53457	you	1643	’ said Mrs Wilfer . ‘
53480	53499	53440	53440	ma’am	1643	’ Twere unjust to visit upon Mr and Mrs Boffin , a calamity which was doubtless a dispensation . ’
53515	53525	53527	53530	the honest Mr Boffin	324	‘ That ’s fairly meant , I am sure , ’
53532	53671	53527	53530	the honest Mr Boffin	324	‘ Mrs Boffin and me , ma’am , are plain people , and we do n’t want to pretend to anything , nor yet to go round and round at anything because there ’s always a straight way to everything . Consequently , we make this call to say , that we shall be glad to have the honour and pleasure of your daughter ’s acquaintance , and that we shall be rejoiced if your daughter will come to consider our house in the light of her home equally with this . In short , we want to cheer your daughter , and to give her the opportunity of sharing such pleasures as we are a going to take ourselves . We want to brisk her up , and brisk her about , and give her a change . ’
53672	53677	53683	53684	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ That ’s it ! ’
53686	53694	53683	53684	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Lor ! Let ’s be comfortable . ’
53718	53749	53698	53698	her	302	‘ Pardon me . I have several daughters . Which of my daughters am I to understand is thus favoured by the kind intentions of Mr Boffin and his lady ? ’
53750	53756	53761	53762	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Do n’t you see ? ’
53766	53775	53761	53762	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Naturally , Miss Bella , you know . ’
53776	53781	53783	53784	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Oh - h ! ’
53792	53804	53783	53784	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ My daughter Bella is accessible and shall speak for herself . ’
53829	53836	53822	53824	the good lady	8937	‘ Send Miss Bella to me ! ’
53902	53912	53913	53914	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ The avocations of R. W. , my husband , ’

53955	53960	53962	53963	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Very pleasant premises ! ’
53967	53973	53979	53979	him	324	‘ Pardon me , sir , ’
53981	53992	53975	53976	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ it is the abode of conscious though independent Poverty . ’
54065	54077	54079	54080	Miss Bella	307	‘ I am much obliged to you , I am sure , ’
54087	54102	54079	54080	Miss Bella	307	‘ but I doubt if I have the inclination to go out at all . ’
54103	54106	54107	54108	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Bella ! ’
54112	54120	54107	54108	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Bella , you must conquer this . ’
54121	54137	54139	54140	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Yes , do what your Ma says , and conquer it , my dear , ’
54142	54166	54139	54140	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ because we shall be so glad to have you , and because you are much too pretty to keep yourself shut up . ’

54525	54540	54542	54543	Miss Lavinia	310	‘ Oh , my consent is of no consequence at all , I suppose ? ’
54545	54548	54550	54551	her sister	8932	‘ Lavvy , ’

Do you dare to suppose , you ridiculous girl , that Mr and Mrs Boffin would enter these doors upon a patronizing errand ; or , if they did , would remain within them , only for one single instant , while your mother had the strength yet remaining in her vital frame to request them to depart ? You little know your mother if you presume to think so . ’

Do you not comprehend that in presuming to hint that this lady and gentleman could have any idea of patronizing any member of your family — I care not which — you accuse them of an impertinence little less than insane ? ’
54823	54833	54835	54836	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Never mind me and Mrs Boffin , ma’am , ’

55175	55266	55267	55267	Your	2081	’ However , Bella compensating for all drawbacks by responding to the advances of the Boffins in an engaging way , that easy pair were on the whole well satisfied , and proposed to the said Bella that as soon as they should be in a condition to receive her in a manner suitable to their desires , Mrs Boffin should return with notice of the fact . This arrangement Mrs Wilfer sanctioned with a stately inclination of her head and wave of her gloves , as who should say , ‘
55283	55284	55280	55281	poor people	2083	’ ‘
55293	55305	55291	55291	ma’am	1643	’ said Mr Boffin , turning back as he was going , ‘
55311	55312	55313	55314	A gentleman	8943	’ ‘
55316	55326	55313	55314	A gentleman	8943	’ Mrs Wilfer answered , qualifying the low expression , ‘
55333	55334	55313	55314	A gentleman	8943	’ ‘
55343	55348	55335	55335	I	0	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
55366	55367	55362	55362	you	1643	’ ‘
55382	55383	55377	55380	a very eligible inmate	2092	’ ‘
55386	55391	55392	55392	you	1643	’ Mr Boffin explained , ‘
55397	55428	55392	55392	you	1643	’m not particularly well acquainted with Our Mutual Friend , for I have only seen him once . You give a good account of him . Is he at home ? ’
55429	55436	55438	55439	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Mr Rokesmith is at home , ’
55441	55444	55438	55439	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ indeed , ’
55450	55465	55438	55439	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ there he stands at the garden gate . Waiting for you , perhaps ? ’
55466	55470	55472	55473	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Perhaps so , ’
55475	55483	55472	55473	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Saw me come in , maybe . ’
55507	55518	55520	55521	Mr Boffin	324	‘ How are you , sir , how are you ? ’
55523	55541	55542	55542	She	302	‘ This is Mrs Boffin . Mr Rokesmith , that I told you of ; my dear . ’
55568	55579	55581	55582	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Good - bye for the present , Miss Bella , ’
55590	55612	55581	55582	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ We shall meet again soon ! And then I hope I shall have my little John Harmon to show you . ’
55654	55657	55650	55651	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Gracious ! ’
55663	55671	55650	55651	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ What ’s the matter , sir ? ’
55672	55681	55683	55684	Mr Rokesmith	315	‘ How can you show her the Dead ? ’
55686	55703	55650	55651	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ It ’s only an adopted child . One I have told her of . One I ’m
55711	55712	55713	55713	You	302	’ ‘
55719	55724	55713	55713	You	302	’ said Mr Rokesmith , ‘
55747	55890	55733	55733	you	302	’ Now , Bella suspected by this time that Mr Rokesmith admired her . Whether the knowledge ( for it was rather that than suspicion ) caused her to incline to him a little more , or a little less , than she had done at first ; whether it rendered her eager to find out more about him , because she sought to establish reason for her distrust , or because she sought to free him from it ; was as yet dark to her own heart . But at most times he occupied a great amount of her attention , and she had set her attention closely on this incident . That he knew it as well as she , she knew as well as he , when they were left together standing on the path by the garden gate . ‘
55899	55900	55896	55897	Miss Wilfer	307	’ ‘
55907	55945	55902	55902	you	2096	’ asked Bella . He smiled , reproaching her , and she coloured , reproaching herself — both , with the knowledge that she had meant to entrap him into an answer not true — when he said ‘
55951	55952	55955	55955	he	2096	’ ‘
55965	55966	55971	55971	he	2096	’ ‘
55974	55990	55971	55971	he	2096	’ Bella was nervous now , and would have been glad to recall her question . ‘
56054	56077	56080	56080	Bella	307	’ Re - entering the family - room in a meditative state , Miss Bella was received by the irrepressible Lavinia with : ‘
56143	56144	56132	56132	I	0	’ ‘
56147	56159	56160	56161	Miss Bella	307	’ quoth Mr George Sampson , moodily pulling his stopper out , ‘
56195	56380	56188	56188	he	324	’ and was going to say peril ; but Miss Lavinia , having no confidence in his mental powers , and feeling his oration to have no definite application to any circumstances , jerked his stopper in again , with a sharpness that made his eyes water . And now the worthy Mrs Wilfer , having used her youngest daughter as a lay - figure for the edification of these Boffins , became bland to her , and proceeded to develop her last instance of force of character , which was still in reserve . This was , to illuminate the family with her remarkable powers as a physiognomist ; powers that terrified R. W. when ever let loose , as being always fraught with gloom and evil which no inferior prescience was aware of . And this Mrs Wilfer now did , be it observed , in jealousy of these Boffins , in the very same moments when she was already reflecting how she would flourish these very same Boffins and the state they kept , over the heads of her Boffinless friends . ‘
56385	56390	56391	56391	I	0	’ said Mrs Wilfer , ‘
56440	56799	56431	56432	Mrs Boffin	324	’ As an incontrovertible proof that those baleful attributes were all there , Mrs Wilfer shuddered on the spot . Chapter 10 A MARRIAGE CONTRACT There is excitement in the Veneering mansion . The mature young lady is going to be married ( powder and all ) to the mature young gentleman , and she is to be married from the Veneering house , and the Veneerings are to give the breakfast . The Analytical , who objects as a matter of principle to everything that occurs on the premises , necessarily objects to the match ; but his consent has been dispensed with , and a spring - van is delivering its load of greenhouse plants at the door , in order that to - morrow ’s feast may be crowned with flowers . The mature young lady is a lady of property . The mature young gentleman is a gentleman of property . He invests his property . He goes , in a condescending amateurish way , into the City , attends meetings of Directors , and has to do with traffic in Shares . As is well known to the wise in their generation , traffic in Shares is the one thing to have to do with in this world . Have no antecedents , no established character , no cultivation , no ideas , no manners ; have Shares . Have Shares enough to be on Boards of Direction in capital letters , oscillate on mysterious business between London and Paris , and be great . Where does he come from ? Shares . Where is he going to ? Shares . What are his tastes ? Shares . Has he any principles ? Shares . What squeezes him into Parliament ? Shares . Perhaps he never of himself achieved success in anything , never originated anything , never produced anything ? Sufficient answer to all ; Shares . O mighty Shares ! To set those blaring images so high , and to cause us smaller vermin , as under the influence of henbane or opium , to cry out , night and day , ‘
56837	56942	56943	56943	Anastatia	421	’ ! While the Loves and Graces have been preparing this torch for Hymen , which is to be kindled to - morrow , Mr Twemlow has suffered much in his mind . It would seem that both the mature young lady and the mature young gentleman must indubitably be Veneering ’s oldest friends . Wards of his , perhaps ? Yet that can scarcely be , for they are older than himself . Veneering has been in their confidence throughout , and has done much to lure them to the altar . He has mentioned to Twemlow how he said to Mrs Veneering , ‘
56951	57010	56943	56943	Anastatia	421	’ He has mentioned to Twemlow how he regards Sophronia Akershem ( the mature young lady ) in the light of a sister , and Alfred Lammle ( the mature young gentleman ) in the light of a brother . Twemlow has asked him whether he went to school as a junior with Alfred ? He has answered , ‘
57014	57027	56943	56943	Anastatia	421	’ Whether Sophronia was adopted by his mother ? He has answered , ‘
57032	57156	56943	56943	Anastatia	421	’ Twemlow ’s hand has gone to his forehead with a lost air . But , two or three weeks ago , Twemlow , sitting over his newspaper , and over his dry - toast and weak tea , and over the stable - yard in Duke Street , St James ’s , received a highly - perfumed cocked - hat and monogram from Mrs Veneering , entreating her dearest Mr T. , if not particularly engaged that day , to come like a charming soul and make a fourth at dinner with dear Mr Podsnap , for the discussion of an interesting family topic ; the last three words doubly underlined and pointed with a note of admiration . And Twemlow replying , ‘
57165	57173	57174	57174	My	0	’ goes , and this takes place : ‘
57178	57182	57174	57174	My	0	’ says Veneering , ‘
57210	57334	57203	57203	You	271	’ Twemlow ought to know the dear friend Podsnap who covered him with so much confusion , and he says he does know him , and Podsnap reciprocates . Apparently , Podsnap has been so wrought upon in a short time , as to believe that he has been intimate in the house many , many , many years . In the friendliest manner he is making himself quite at home with his back to the fire , executing a statuette of the Colossus at Rhodes . Twemlow has before noticed in his feeble way how soon the Veneering guests become infected with the Veneering fiction . Not , however , that he has the least notion of its being his own case . ‘
57342	57349	57335	57336	Our friends	2113	’ pursues Veneering the veiled prophet : ‘
57408	57410	57433	57433	he	2120	’ ( ‘
57413	57423	57433	57433	he	2120	’ thinks Twemlow , with his eyes on Podsnap , ‘
57438	57440	57433	57433	he	2120	’ ) ‘
57445	57450	57461	57461	she	268	’ Veneering goes on , ‘
57472	57474	57461	57461	she	268	’ ( ‘
57477	57486	57461	57461	she	268	’ thinks Twemlow , with his eyes wandering , ‘
57496	57500	57495	57495	SHE	268	’S the other . ’
57502	57506	57508	57508	Veneering	421	‘ Mortimer Lightwood , ’
57510	57565	57508	57508	Veneering	421	‘ whom you both know , is out of town ; but he writes , in his whimsical manner , that as we ask him to be bridegroom ’s best man when the ceremony takes place , he will not refuse , though he does n’t see what he has to do with it . ’
57567	57570	57572	57572	Twemlow	271	‘ Oh ! ’
57579	57589	57575	57575	his	271	‘ then there are four of us , and HE ’S
57593	57595	57575	57575	his	271	’ ) ‘
57600	57604	57598	57598	Brewer	263	’ observes Veneering , ‘
57626	57628	57575	57575	his	271	’ ( ‘
57631	57640	57575	57575	his	271	’ thinks Twemlow , with his eyes shut , ‘
57645	57668	57669	57669	We	2122	’ But here collapses and does not completely recover until dinner is over and the Analytical has been requested to withdraw . ) ‘
57673	57677	57669	57669	We	2122	’ says Veneering , ‘
57709	57710	57714	57714	yourself	271	’ ‘
57716	57720	57714	57714	yourself	271	’ says Podsnap . ‘
57796	57797	57771	57771	Anastatia	421	’ ‘
57805	57812	57771	57771	Anastatia	421	’ Podsnap inquires of Mrs Veneering . ‘
57847	57889	57840	57840	he	424	’ Thus Mrs Veneering ; with her open hands pressed together , and each of her eight aquiline fingers looking so very like her one aquiline nose that the bran - new jewels on them seem necessary for distinction ’s sake . ‘
57896	57900	57894	57894	Podsnap	438	’ quoth Veneering , ‘
57938	57955	57935	57936	That friend	2138	’ saying the words as if the company were about a hundred and fifty in number , ‘
57966	57967	57964	57964	Twemlow	271	’ ‘
57970	57974	57975	57976	That friend	2138	’ from Podsnap . ‘
57978	57985	57975	57976	That friend	2138	’ Veneering repeats with greater firmness , ‘
58076	58534	58838	58839	No Adorable	2146	’ And , indeed , Veneering is much relieved in mind to find that Podsnap betrays no jealousy of Twemlow ’s elevation . So , it has come to pass that the spring - van is strewing flowers on the rosy hours and on the staircase , and that Twemlow is surveying the ground on which he is to play his distinguished part to - morrow . He has already been to the church , and taken note of the various impediments in the aisle , under the auspices of an extremely dreary widow who opens the pews , and whose left hand appears to be in a state of acute rheumatism , but is in fact voluntarily doubled up to act as a money - box . And now Veneering shoots out of the Study wherein he is accustomed , when contemplative , to give his mind to the carving and gilding of the Pilgrims going to Canterbury , in order to show Twemlow the little flourish he has prepared for the trumpets of fashion , describing how that on the seventeenth instant , at St James ’s Church , the Reverend Blank Blank , assisted by the Reverend Dash Dash , united in the bonds of matrimony , Alfred Lammle Esquire , of Sackville Street , Piccadilly , to Sophronia , only daughter of the late Horatio Akershem , Esquire , of Yorkshire . Also how the fair bride was married from the house of Hamilton Veneering , Esquire , of Stucconia , and was given away by Melvin Twemlow , Esquire , of Duke Street , St James ’s , second cousin to Lord Snigsworth , of Snigsworthy Park . While perusing which composition , Twemlow makes some opaque approach to perceiving that if the Reverend Blank Blank and the Reverend Dash Dash fail , after this introduction , to become enrolled in the list of Veneering ’s dearest and oldest friends , they will have none but themselves to thank for it . After which , appears Sophronia ( whom Twemlow has seen twice in his lifetime ) , to thank Twemlow for counterfeiting the late Horatio Akershem Esquire , broadly of Yorkshire . And after her , appears Alfred ( whom Twemlow has seen once in his lifetime ) , to do the same and to make a pasty sort of glitter , as if he were constructed for candle - light only , and had been let out into daylight by some grand mistake . And after that , comes Mrs Veneering , in a pervadingly aquiline state of figure , and with transparent little knobs on her temper , like the little transparent knob on the bridge of her nose , ‘
58542	58837	58838	58839	No Adorable	2146	’ as she tells her dear Mr Twemlow , and reluctantly revived with curacoa by the Analytical . And after that , the bridesmaids begin to come by rail - road from various parts of the country , and to come like adorable recruits enlisted by a sergeant not present ; for , on arriving at the Veneering depot , they are in a barrack of strangers . So , Twemlow goes home to Duke Street , St James ’s , to take a plate of mutton broth with a chop in it , and a look at the marriage - service , in order that he may cut in at the right place to - morrow ; and he is low , and feels it dull over the livery stable - yard , and is distinctly aware of a dint in his heart , made by the most adorable of the adorable bridesmaids . For , the poor little harmless gentleman once had his fancy , like the rest of us , and she did n’t answer ( as she often does not ) , and he thinks the adorable bridesmaid is like the fancy as she was then ( which she is not at all ) , and that if the fancy had not married some one else for money , but had married him for love , he and she would have been happy ( which they would n’t have been ) , and that she has a tenderness for him still ( whereas her toughness is a proverb ) . Brooding over the fire , with his dried little head in his dried little hands , and his dried little elbows on his dried little knees , Twemlow is melancholy . ‘
58846	58850	58851	58852	No Adorable	2146	’ thinks he . ‘
58869	58928	59127	59128	you wretch	2150	’ And so drops asleep , and has galvanic starts all over him . Betimes next morning , that horrible old Lady Tippins ( relict of the late Sir Thomas Tippins , knighted in mistake for somebody else by His Majesty King George the Third , who , while performing the ceremony , was graciously pleased to observe , ‘
58947	59124	59125	59125	Mortimer	287	’ ) begins to be dyed and varnished for the interesting occasion . She has a reputation for giving smart accounts of things , and she must be at these people ’s early , my dear , to lose nothing of the fun . Whereabout in the bonnet and drapery announced by her name , any fragment of the real woman may be concealed , is perhaps known to her maid ; but you could easily buy all you see of her , in Bond Street ; or you might scalp her , and peel her , and scrape her , and make two Lady Tippinses out of her , and yet not penetrate to the genuine article . She has a large gold eye - glass , has Lady Tippins , to survey the proceedings with . If she had one in each eye , it might keep that other drooping lid up , and look more uniform . But perennial youth is in her artificial flowers , and her list of lovers is full . ‘
59130	59142	59127	59127	you	287	’ says Lady Tippins , turning the eyeglass about and about , ‘
59151	59152	59127	59127	you	287	’ ‘
59158	59162	59163	59163	I	0	’ returns Mortimer , ‘
59174	59175	59169	59169	I	0	’ ‘
59187	59188	59193	59193	he	2151	’ ‘
59229	59359	59220	59220	I	0	’ returns Mortimer . Eugene is also in attendance , with a pervading air upon him of having presupposed the ceremony to be a funeral , and of being disappointed . The scene is the Vestry - room of St James ’s Church , with a number of leathery old registers on shelves , that might be bound in Lady Tippinses . But , hark ! A carriage at the gate , and Mortimer ’s man arrives , looking rather like a spurious Mephistopheles and an unacknowledged member of that gentleman ’s family . Whom Lady Tippins , surveying through her eye - glass , considers a fine man , and quite a catch ; and of whom Mortimer remarks , in the lowest spirits , as he approaches , ‘
59370	59405	59406	59406	Bride	433	’ More carriages at the gate , and lo the rest of the characters . Whom Lady Tippins , standing on a cushion , surveying through the eye - glass , thus checks off . ‘
59544	59945	59539	59540	Attendant unknowns	2164	’ Ceremony performed , register signed , Lady Tippins escorted out of sacred edifice by Veneering , carriages rolling back to Stucconia , servants with favours and flowers , Veneering ’s house reached , drawing - rooms most magnificent . Here , the Podsnaps await the happy party ; Mr Podsnap , with his hair - brushes made the most of ; that imperial rocking - horse , Mrs Podsnap , majestically skittish . Here , too , are Boots and Brewer , and the two other Buffers ; each Buffer with a flower in his button - hole , his hair curled , and his gloves buttoned on tight , apparently come prepared , if anything had happened to the bridegroom , to be married instantly . Here , too , the bride ’s aunt and next relation ; a widowed female of a Medusa sort , in a stoney cap , glaring petrifaction at her fellow - creatures . Here , too , the bride ’s trustee ; an oilcake - fed style of business - gentleman with mooney spectacles , and an object of much interest . Veneering launching himself upon this trustee as his oldest friend ( which makes seven , Twemlow thought ) , and confidentially retiring with him into the conservatory , it is understood that Veneering is his co - trustee , and that they are arranging about the fortune . Buffers are even overheard to whisper Thir - ty Thou - sand Pou - nds ! with a smack and a relish suggestive of the very finest oysters . Pokey unknowns , amazed to find how intimately they know Veneering , pluck up spirit , fold their arms , and begin to contradict him before breakfast . What time Mrs Veneering , carrying baby dressed as a bridesmaid , flits about among the company , emitting flashes of many - coloured lightning from diamonds , emeralds , and rubies . The Analytical , in course of time achieving what he feels to be due to himself in bringing to a dignified conclusion several quarrels he has on hand with the pastrycook ’s men , announces breakfast . Dining - room no less magnificent than drawing - room ; tables superb ; all the camels out , and all laden . Splendid cake , covered with Cupids , silver , and true - lovers ’
60237	60252	60224	60225	Lady Tippins	268	‘ No , no , no , not for me . Take it away ! ’
60991	61003	61005	61005	he	2210	‘ Do you mean to tell me , then , Sophronia — ’
61022	61043	61013	61013	Sophronia	625	‘ Do n’t put it upon ME , sir . I ask you , do YOU mean to tell me ? ’
61098	61105	61106	61107	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Do I mean to say ! ’
61116	61126	61127	61128	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Putting it on me ! The unmanly disingenuousness ! ’
61140	61144	61145	61146	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ The what ? ’
61158	61162	61163	61163	He	437	‘ The meanness . ’
61179	61191	61176	61176	he	437	‘ That is not what you said . You said disingenuousness . ’
61192	61198	61163	61163	He	437	‘ What if I did ? ’
61199	61213	61163	61163	He	437	‘ There is no “ if ” in the case . You did . ’
61214	61225	61176	61176	he	437	‘ I did , then . And what of it ? ’
61226	61231	61233	61234	Mr Lammle	437	‘ What of it ? ’
61236	61248	61233	61234	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Have you the face to utter the word to me ? ’
61249	61255	61257	61258	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ The face , too ! ’
61267	61282	61257	61258	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Pray , how dare you , sir , utter the word to me ? ’
61283	61288	61176	61176	he	437	‘ I never did . ’
61307	61320	61296	61297	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ I do n’t care what you uttered or did not utter . ’
61338	61369	61332	61333	Mr Lammle	437	‘ You shall proceed in your own way . You claim a right to ask me do I mean to tell you . Do I mean to tell you what ? ’
61370	61379	61257	61258	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ That you are a man of property ? ’
61380	61383	61257	61258	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ No . ’
61384	61393	61332	61333	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Then you married me on false pretences ? ’
61394	61419	61257	61258	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ So be it . Next comes what you mean to say . Do you mean to say you are a woman of property ? ’
61420	61423	61257	61258	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ No . ’
61424	61433	61332	61333	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Then you married me on false pretences . ’
61434	61477	61478	61479	the lady	2213	‘ If you were so dull a fortune - hunter that you deceived yourself , or if you were so greedy and grasping that you were over - willing to be deceived by appearances , is it my fault , you adventurer ? ’
61486	61499	61478	61479	the lady	2213	‘ I asked Veneering , and he told me you were rich . ’
61500	61503	61332	61333	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Veneering ! ’
61508	61517	61332	61333	Mr Lammle	437	‘ And what does Veneering know about me ! ’
61518	61525	61332	61333	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Was he not your trustee ? ’
61526	61587	61332	61333	Mr Lammle	437	‘ No . I have no trustee , but the one you saw on the day when you fraudulently married me . And his trust is not a very difficult one , for it is only an annuity of a hundred and fifteen pounds . I think there are some odd shillings or pence , if you are very particular . ’
61615	61639	61613	61613	himself	437	‘ Question for question . It is my turn again , Mrs Lammle . What made you suppose me a man of property ? ’
61640	61663	61332	61333	Mr Lammle	437	‘ You made me suppose you so . Perhaps you will deny that you always presented yourself to me in that character ? ’
61664	61685	61719	61720	the bride	9667	‘ But you asked somebody , too . Come , Mrs Lammle , admission for admission . You asked somebody ? ’
61686	61691	61613	61613	himself	437	‘ I asked Veneering . ’
61692	61713	61332	61333	Mr Lammle	437	‘ And Veneering knew as much of me as he knew of you , or as anybody knows of him . ’
61731	61741	61719	61720	the bride	9667	‘ I never will forgive the Veneerings for this ! ’
61742	61747	61749	61750	the bridegroom	2151	‘ Neither will I , ’
61860	61867	61868	61869	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Do you pretend to believe , ’
61874	61904	61868	61869	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ when you talk of my marrying you for worldly advantages , that it was within the bounds of reasonable probability that I would have married you for yourself ? ’
61905	61925	61868	61869	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Again there are two sides to the question , Mrs Lammle . What do you pretend to believe ? ’
61926	61937	61939	61940	the lady	2213	‘ So you first deceive me and then insult me ! ’
61947	61965	61939	61940	the lady	2213	‘ Not at all . I have originated nothing . The double - edged question was yours . ’
61966	61970	61971	61972	the bride	9667	‘ Was mine ! ’
62038	62043	62044	62044	he	2229	‘ Throw it away , ’
62052	62065	62044	62044	he	2229	‘ you have made it useless ; you look ridiculous with it . ’
62074	62079	62067	62067	she	9667	‘ A deliberate villain , ’
62297	62312	62293	62293	he	2229	‘ Now , get up , Mrs Lammle , and let us speak reasonably . ’
62326	62334	62339	62339	she	9667	‘ Get up , I tell you . ’
62349	62359	62339	62339	she	9667	‘ You tell me ! Tell me , forsooth ! ’
62390	62404	62385	62385	she	9667	‘ Enough of this . Come ! Do you hear ? Get up . ’
62431	62475	62410	62410	she	9667	‘ Mrs Lammle , we have both been deceiving , and we have both been deceived . We have both been biting , and we have both been bitten . In a nut - shell , there ’s the state of the case . ’
62476	62482	62385	62385	she	9667	‘ You sought me out — ’
62483	62531	62385	62385	she	9667	‘ Tut ! Let us have done with that . WE know very well how it was . Why should you and I talk about it , when you and I ca n’t disguise it ? To proceed . I am disappointed and cut a poor figure . ’
62532	62538	62410	62410	she	9667	‘ Am I no one ? ’
62539	62569	62385	62385	she	9667	‘ Some one — and I was coming to you , if you had waited a moment . You , too , are disappointed and cut a poor figure . ’
62570	62575	62385	62385	she	9667	‘ An injured figure ! ’
62576	62638	62410	62410	she	9667	‘ You are now cool enough , Sophronia , to see that you ca n’t be injured without my being equally injured ; and that therefore the mere word is not to the purpose . When I look back , I wonder how I can have been such a fool as to take you to so great an extent upon trust . ’
62639	62646	62647	62648	the bride	9667	‘ And when I look back — ’
62653	62673	62647	62648	the bride	9667	‘ And when you look back , you wonder how you can have been — you’ll excuse the word ? ’
62674	62683	62410	62410	she	9667	‘ Most certainly , with so much reason . ’
62684	62729	62410	62410	she	9667	‘ — Such a fool as to take ME to so great an extent upon trust . But the folly is committed on both sides . I can not get rid of you ; you can not get rid of me . What follows ? ’
62730	62735	62736	62737	the bride	9667	‘ Shame and misery , ’
62741	62820	62736	62737	the bride	9667	‘ I do n’t know . A mutual understanding follows , and I think it may carry us through . Here I split my discourse ( give me your arm , Sophronia ) , into three heads , to make it shorter and plainer . Firstly , it ’s enough to have been done , without the mortification of being known to have been done . So we agree to keep the fact to ourselves . You agree ? ’
62821	62830	62410	62410	she	9667	‘ If it is possible , I do . ’
62831	62891	62410	62410	she	9667	‘ Possible ! We have pretended well enough to one another . Ca n’t we , united , pretend to the world ? Agreed . Secondly , we owe the Veneerings a grudge , and we owe all other people the grudge of wishing them to be taken in , as we ourselves have been taken in . Agreed ? ’
62892	62897	62736	62737	the bride	9667	‘ Yes . Agreed . ’
62898	62958	62410	62410	she	9667	‘ We come smoothly to thirdly . You have called me an adventurer , Sophronia . So I am . In plain uncomplimentary English , so I am . So are you , my dear . So are many people . We agree to keep our own secret , and to work together in furtherance of our own schemes . ’
62959	62963	62410	62410	she	9667	‘ What schemes ? ’
62964	62986	62987	62987	She	2239	‘ Any scheme that will bring us money . By our own schemes , I mean our joint interest . Agreed ? ’
62995	63002	62987	62987	She	2239	‘ I suppose so . Agreed . ’
63003	63123	62410	62410	she	9667	‘ Carried at once , you see ! Now , Sophronia , only half a dozen words more . We know one another perfectly . Do n’t be tempted into twitting me with the past knowledge that you have of me , because it is identical with the past knowledge that I have of you , and in twitting me , you twit yourself , and I do n’t want to hear you do it . With this good understanding established between us , it is better never done . To wind up all:—You have shown temper today , Sophronia . Do n’t be betrayed into doing so again , because I have a Devil of a temper myself . ’
63398	63422	63423	63424	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ I do n’t want to know about it ; I do n’t choose to discuss it ; I do n’t admit it ! ’
63525	63529	63502	63502	he	438	‘ Not English ! ’
64055	64059	64053	64053	he	438	‘ the young person ’
64427	64433	64435	64436	Mrs Podsnap	265	‘ Georgiana is almost eighteen . ’
64443	64447	64449	64450	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ Almost eighteen . ’
64456	64470	64472	64473	Mrs Podsnap	265	‘ Really I think we should have some people on Georgiana ’s birthday . ’
64479	64494	64472	64473	Mrs Podsnap	265	‘ Which will enable us to clear off all those people who are due . ’
64589	64601	64578	64578	she	265	‘ Asked , at any rate , and got rid of ; ’
64811	64850	64807	64807	Everything	443	‘ Here you have as much of me in my ugliness as if I were only lead ; but I am so many ounces of precious metal worth so much an ounce;—wouldn’t you like to melt me down ? ’
65081	65085	65069	65070	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ Madame Podsnap ; ’
65090	65094	65069	65070	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ Mademoiselle Podsnap , ’
65100	65104	65112	65112	he	438	‘ ma fille , ’

65154	65161	65127	65127	he	438	‘ How Do You Like London ? ’
65191	65198	65174	65174	he	438	‘ London , Londres , London ? ’
65205	65212	65214	65215	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ You find it Very Large ? ’
65227	65232	65233	65235	The foreign gentleman	2325	‘ And Very Rich ? ’
65245	65252	65254	65255	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ Enormously Rich , We say , ’
65262	65294	65254	65255	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ Our English adverbs do Not terminate in Mong , and We Pronounce the “ ch ” as if there were a “ t ” before it . We say Ritch . ’
65295	65298	65300	65302	the foreign gentleman	2325	‘ Reetch , ’
65304	65312	65300	65302	the foreign gentleman	2325	‘ And Do You Find , Sir , ’
65320	65346	65314	65315	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ Many Evidences that Strike You , of our British Constitution in the Streets Of The World ’s Metropolis , London , Londres , London ? ’
65361	65366	65373	65373	he	438	‘ The Constitution Britannique , ’

65527	65532	65534	65535	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ I Was Inquiring , ’
65544	65568	65569	65571	The foreign gentleman	2325	‘ Whether You Have Observed in our Streets as We should say , Upon our Pavvy as You would say , any Tokens — ’

65618	65624	65626	65627	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ We call it Horse , ’
65632	65663	65626	65627	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ In England , Angleterre , England , We Aspirate the “ H , ” and We Say “ Horse . ” Only our Lower Classes Say “ Orse ! ” ’
65664	65667	65669	65671	the foreign gentleman	2325	‘ Pardon , ’
65673	65679	65669	65671	the foreign gentleman	2325	‘ I am alwiz wrong ! ’
65680	65684	65686	65687	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ Our Language , ’
65698	65720	65686	65687	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ is Difficult . Ours is a Copious Language , and Trying to Strangers . I will not Pursue my Question . ’
65736	65739	65722	65733	the lumpy gentleman , unwilling to give it up , again madly	2338	‘ ESKER , ’
65746	65751	65752	65753	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ It merely referred , ’
65763	65799	65752	65753	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ to Our Constitution , Sir . We Englishmen are Very Proud of our Constitution , Sir . It Was Bestowed Upon Us By Providence . No Other Country is so Favoured as This Country . ’
65800	65806	65807	65809	the foreign gentleman	2325	‘ And ozer countries ? — ’
65821	65865	65814	65815	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ We do not say Ozer ; we say Other : the letters are “ T ” and “ H ; ” You say Tay and Aish , You Know ; ( still with clemency ) . The sound is “ th”—“th ! ” ’
65866	65871	65873	65875	the foreign gentleman	2325	‘ And OTHER countries , ’
65877	65882	65873	65875	the foreign gentleman	2325	‘ They do how ? ’
65883	65889	65891	65892	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ They do , Sir , ’
65899	65917	65896	65896	his	438	‘ they do — I am sorry to be obliged to say it — AS they do . ’
65918	65927	65929	65931	the foreign gentleman	2325	‘ It was a little particular of Providence , ’
65935	65943	65929	65931	the foreign gentleman	2325	‘ for the frontier is not large . ’
65944	65947	65949	65950	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ Undoubtedly , ’
65952	66002	66004	66005	Mr Podsnap	438	‘ But So it is . It was the Charter of the Land . This Island was Blest , Sir , to the Direct Exclusion of such Other Countries as — as there may happen to be . And if we were all Englishmen present , I would say , ’
66020	66076	66017	66017	his	438	‘ that there is in the Englishman a combination of qualities , a modesty , an independence , a responsibility , a repose , combined with an absence of everything calculated to call a blush into the cheek of a young person , which one would seek in vain among the Nations of the Earth . ’
66171	66180	66181	66181	he	438	‘ Has anything more been heard , Veneering , ’
66184	66190	66181	66181	he	438	‘ of the lucky legatee ? ’
66191	66195	66197	66197	Veneering	260	‘ Nothing more , ’
66199	66250	66197	66197	Veneering	260	‘ than that he has come into possession of the property . I am told people now call him The Golden Dustman . I mentioned to you some time ago , I think , that the young lady whose intended husband was murdered is daughter to a clerk of mine ? ’
66251	66259	66261	66261	Podsnap	438	‘ Yes , you told me that , ’
66263	66333	66261	66261	Podsnap	438	‘ and by - the - bye , I wish you would tell it again here , for it ’s a curious coincidence — curious that the first news of the discovery should have been brought straight to your table ( when I was there ) , and curious that one of your people should have been so nearly interested in it . Just relate that , will you ? ’
67043	67050	67058	67058	she	423	‘ Why do n’t you play ? ’
67069	67073	67058	67058	she	423	‘ That card ? ’
67079	67082	67058	67058	she	423	‘ Yes , ’
67122	67142	67115	67116	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ Oh ! Indeed , it ’s very kind of you , but I am afraid I DON’T talk . ’

67162	67179	67158	67158	her	423	‘ Oh ! I am afraid you ’ll find me very dull . But Ma talks ! ’
67208	67214	67193	67193	her	451	‘ Fond of reading perhaps ? ’
67215	67228	67230	67231	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ Yes . At least I — don’t mind that so much , ’
67233	67244	67230	67231	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ M - m - m - m - music . ’
67266	67281	67251	67251	she	423	‘ I have n’t nerve to play even if I could . Ma plays . ’
67314	67321	67362	67363	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ Of course you like dancing ? ’
67322	67330	67332	67333	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ Oh no , I do n’t , ’
67335	67353	67332	67333	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ No ? With your youth and attractions ? Truly , my dear , you surprise me ! ’
67354	67360	67362	67363	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ I ca n’t say , ’

67412	67447	67332	67333	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ No , I am sure you wo n’t . I ca n’t say then how I should have liked it , if I had been a chimney - sweep on May - day . ’
67448	67451	67332	67333	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ Gracious ! ’
67462	67481	67459	67460	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ There ! I knew you ’d wonder . But you wo n’t mention it , will you ? ’
67482	67490	67492	67493	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Upon my word , my love , ’
67495	67585	67492	67493	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ you make me ten times more desirous , now I talk to you , to know you well than I was when I sat over yonder looking at you . How I wish we could be real friends ! Try me as a real friend . Come ! Do n’t fancy me a frumpy old married woman , my dear ; I was married but the other day , you know ; I am dressed as a bride now , you see . About the chimney - sweeps ? ’
67586	67592	67459	67460	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Hush ! Ma’ll hear . ’
67593	67603	67459	67460	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ She ca n’t hear from where she sits . ’
67604	67614	67616	67617	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ Do n’t you be too sure of that , ’
67624	67639	67616	67617	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ Well , what I mean is , that they seem to enjoy it . ’
67640	67658	67659	67660	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ And that perhaps you would have enjoyed it , if you had been one of them ? ’
67664	67673	67659	67660	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ Then you do n’t enjoy it now ? ’
67674	67680	67682	67683	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ How is it possible ? ’
67685	67714	67682	67683	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ Oh it is such a dreadful thing ! If I was wicked enough — and strong enough — to kill anybody , it should be my partner . ’

67842	67903	67839	67840	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ such a trial to me ! I so dread being awful . And it is so awful ! No one knows what I suffered at Madame Sauteuse ’s , where I learnt to dance and make presentation - curtseys , and other dreadful things — or at least where they tried to teach me . Ma can do it . ’
67904	67912	67914	67915	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ At any rate , my love , ’

67937	68042	67934	67935	Miss Podsnap	440	‘ but there ’s nothing gained by that . It ’s worse here , than at Madame Sauteuse ’s . Ma was there , and Ma ’s here ; but Pa was n’t there , and company was n’t there , and there were not real partners there . Oh there ’s Ma speaking to the man at the piano ! Oh there ’s Ma going up to somebody ! Oh I know she ’s going to bring him to me ! Oh please do n’t , please do n’t , please do n’t ! Oh keep away , keep away , keep away ! ’

68567	68589	68599	68600	Miss Podsnap	440	’ This shot was levelled under her breath at the gallant Grompus for bestowing an insinuating smile upon her in passing . ‘
68602	68613	68599	68600	Miss Podsnap	440	’ Mrs Lammle was beginning when the young lady interposed . ‘
68665	68666	68663	68663	Georgiana	441	’ ‘
68670	68676	68667	68668	Dearest Georgiana	441	’ Mrs Lammle began again . ‘
68680	68685	68678	68678	you	0	’ said Miss Podsnap . ‘
68715	68716	68719	68719	you	0	’ ‘
68724	68753	68719	68719	you	0	’ asked Miss Podsnap , plucking at her fingers in a troubled manner , and furtively casting her eyes now on Mrs Lammle , now on the ground . ‘

68796	68797	68799	68799	YOU	0	’ ‘
68804	68809	68799	68799	YOU	0	’ returned Miss Podsnap . ‘
68826	68890	68815	68815	you	0	’ Some little touch of conscience answering this perception of her having gained a purpose , called bloom enough into Mrs Lammle ’s face to make it look brighter as she sat smiling her best smile on her dear Georgiana , and shaking her head with an affectionate playfulness . Not that it meant anything , but that Georgiana seemed to like it . ‘
68896	68900	68892	68892	I	0	’ pursued Georgiana , ‘
68970	68971	68958	68958	I	0	’ ‘
68977	69006	68958	68958	I	0	’ Mrs Lammle was proceeding with every reassuring wile , when the head of that young lady suddenly went back against the wall again and her eyes closed . ‘
69063	69165	69060	69060	I	0	’ This time Georgiana accompanied her ejaculations with taps of her feet upon the floor , and was altogether in quite a desperate condition . But , there was no escape from the majestic Mrs Podsnap ’s production of an ambling stranger , with one eye screwed up into extinction and the other framed and glazed , who , having looked down out of that organ , as if he descried Miss Podsnap at the bottom of some perpendicular shaft , brought her to the surface , and ambled off with her . And then the captive at the piano played another ‘
69168	69307	69060	69060	I	0	’ expressive of his mournful aspirations after freedom , and other sixteen went through the former melancholy motions , and the ambler took Miss Podsnap for a furniture walk , as if he had struck out an entirely original conception . In the mean time a stray personage of a meek demeanour , who had wandered to the hearthrug and got among the heads of tribes assembled there in conference with Mr Podsnap , eliminated Mr Podsnap ’s flush and flourish by a highly unpolite remark ; no less than a reference to the circumstance that some half - dozen people had lately died in the streets , of starvation . It was clearly ill - timed after dinner . It was not adapted to the cheek of the young person . It was not in good taste . ‘
69314	69347	69308	69308	I	0	’ said Mr Podsnap , putting it behind him . The meek man was afraid we must take it as proved , because there were the Inquests and the Registrar ’s returns . ‘
69355	69463	69351	69351	their	2410	’ said Mr Podsnap . Veneering and other elders of tribes commended this way out of it . At once a short cut and a broad road . The man of meek demeanour intimated that truly it would seem from the facts , as if starvation had been forced upon the culprits in question — as if , in their wretched manner , they had made their weak protests against it — as if they would have taken the liberty of staving it off if they could — as if they would rather not have been starved upon the whole , if perfectly agreeable to all parties . ‘
69468	69476	69351	69351	their	2410	’ said Mr Podsnap , flushing angrily , ‘
69503	69534	69627	69627	you	8755	’ The meek man was quite willing to concede that , but perhaps it rendered the matter even worse , as showing that there must be something appallingly wrong somewhere . ‘
69537	69562	69627	69627	you	8755	’ said Mr Podsnap . The meek man hinted Would n’t it be well to try , very seriously , to find out where ? ‘
69565	69570	69627	69627	you	8755	’ said Mr Podsnap . ‘
69611	69625	69627	69627	you	8755	’ An approving murmur arose from the heads of tribes ; as saying , ‘
69634	69700	69701	69701	You	8755	’ He was not aware ( the meek man submitted of himself ) that he was driving at any ization . He had no favourite ization that he knew of . But he certainly was more staggered by these terrible occurrences than he was by names , of howsoever so many syllables . Might he ask , was dying of destitution and neglect necessarily English ? ‘
69713	69743	69710	69710	I	0	’ said Mr Podsnap . The meek man supposed he did , but supposed that had absolutely nothing to do with it , if its laws were well administered . ‘
69755	69763	69752	69752	you	8755	’ said Mr Podsnap , with severity , ‘
69778	69788	69789	69789	I	0	’ The meek man also hoped he knew that . ‘
69796	69805	69806	69806	I	0	’ said Mr Podsnap with a portentous air . ‘
69827	69890	69891	69891	I	0	’ In reference to that absurd and irreverent conventional phrase , the meek man said , for which Mr Podsnap was not responsible , he the meek man had no fear of doing anything so impossible ; but — But Mr Podsnap felt that the time had come for flushing and flourishing this meek man down for good . So he said : ‘
69958	69960	69955	69956	ME’—Mr Podsnap	457	‘ me ’
70009	70031	70004	70004	Providence	439	’ said Mr Podsnap , flushing high up among his hair - brushes , with a strong consciousness of personal affront , ‘
70071	70162	70069	70069	I	0	’ He finished with that flourish of his arm which added more expressively than any words , And I remove it from the face of the earth . Simultaneously with this quenching of the meek man ’s ineffectual fire ; Georgiana having left the ambler up a lane of sofa , in a No Thoroughfare of back drawing - room , to find his own way out , came back to Mrs Lammle . And who should be with Mrs Lammle , but Mr Lammle . So fond of her ! ‘
70187	70234	70236	70236	Georgiana	441	’ Mr Lammle was proud to be so soon distinguished by this special commendation to Miss Podsnap ’s favour . But if Mr Lammle were prone to be jealous of his dear Sophronia ’s friendships , he would be jealous of her feeling towards Miss Podsnap . ‘
70240	70245	70236	70236	Georgiana	441	’ interposed his wife . ‘
70251	70272	70249	70249	I?—Georgiana	458	’ Mr Lammle uttered the name , with a delicate curve of his right hand , from his lips outward . ‘
70304	70330	70300	70300	I	0	’ The object of this homage sat uneasily enough in receipt of it , and then said , turning to Mrs Lammle , much embarrassed : ‘
70347	70348	70342	70342	I	0	’ ‘
70363	70364	70372	70372	I	0	’ ‘
70385	70394	70374	70374	I	0	’ said Georgiana with a smile of relief . ‘
70403	70420	70395	70395	We	2429	’ observed Mrs Lammle , rising with a show of unwillingness , amidst a general dispersal . ‘
70429	70430	70426	70426	Georgiana	441	’ ‘
70433	70434	70426	70426	Georgiana	441	’ ‘
70441	70476	70438	70439	dear girl	2431	’ She had established an attraction over the shrinking nature upon which her smiling eyes were fixed , for Georgiana held her hand while she answered in a secret and half - frightened tone : ‘
70495	70834	70835	70836	that fellow	2432	’ Charming to see Mr and Mrs Lammle taking leave so gracefully , and going down the stairs so lovingly and sweetly . Not quite so charming to see their smiling faces fall and brood as they dropped moodily into separate corners of their little carriage . But to be sure that was a sight behind the scenes , which nobody saw , and which nobody was meant to see . Certain big , heavy vehicles , built on the model of the Podsnap plate , took away the heavy articles of guests weighing ever so much ; and the less valuable articles got away after their various manners ; and the Podsnap plate was put to bed . As Mr Podsnap stood with his back to the drawing - room fire , pulling up his shirtcollar , like a veritable cock of the walk literally pluming himself in the midst of his possessions , nothing would have astonished him more than an intimation that Miss Podsnap , or any other young person properly born and bred , could not be exactly put away like the plate , brought out like the plate , polished like the plate , counted , weighed , and valued like the plate . That such a young person could possibly have a morbid vacancy in the heart for anything younger than the plate , or less monotonous than the plate ; or that such a young person ’s thoughts could try to scale the region bounded on the north , south , east , and west , by the plate ; was a monstrous imagination which he would on the spot have flourished into space . This perhaps in some sort arose from Mr Podsnap ’s blushing young person being , so to speak , all cheek ; whereas there is a possibility that there may be young persons of a rather more complex organization . If Mr Podsnap , pulling up his shirt - collar , could only have heard himself called ‘
70837	70863	70864	70864	Sophronia	625	’ in a certain short dialogue , which passed between Mr and Mrs Lammle in their opposite corners of their little carriage , rolling home ! ‘
70870	70871	70864	70864	Sophronia	625	’ ‘

71024	71071	71015	71015	We	2437	’ Mrs Lammle winced a little at the reminder , but only enough to shake her scents and essences anew into the atmosphere of the little carriage , as she settled herself afresh in her own dark corner . Chapter 12 THE SWEAT OF AN HONEST MAN ’S

71677	71705	71674	71674	Lightwood	287	‘ Not more than any other place . And there would be no Circuit to go . But that ’s a selfish consideration , personal to me . ’

71757	71820	71747	71747	Eugene	269	‘ Lady Tippins could n’t put off to visit us , or , better still , might put off and get swamped . People could n’t ask one to wedding breakfasts . There would be no Precedents to hammer at , except the plain - sailing Precedent of keeping the light up . It would be exciting to look out for wrecks . ’
71821	71825	71827	71827	Lightwood	287	‘ But otherwise , ’
71829	71841	71827	71827	Lightwood	287	‘ there might be a degree of sameness in the life . ’
71842	71850	71852	71852	Eugene	269	‘ I have thought of that also , ’
71874	71933	71856	71856	he	269	‘ but it would be a defined and limited monotony . It would not extend beyond two people . Now , it ’s a question with me , Mortimer , whether a monotony defined with that precision and limited to that extent , might not be more endurable than the unlimited monotony of one ’s fellow - creatures . ’

72107	72131	72090	72090	He	269	‘ My respected father has found , down in the parental neighbourhood , a wife for his not - generally - respected son . ’

72141	72187	72096	72096	he	269	‘ With some money , of course , or he would not have found her . My respected father — let me shorten the dutiful tautology by substituting in future M. R. F. , which sounds military , and rather like the Duke of Wellington . ’
72188	72198	72090	72090	He	269	‘ What an absurd fellow you are , Eugene ! ’
72199	72303	72096	72096	he	269	‘ Not at all , I assure you . M. R. F. having always in the clearest manner provided ( as he calls it ) for his children by pre - arranging from the hour of the birth of each , and sometimes from an earlier period , what the devoted little victim ’s calling and course in life should be , M. R. F. pre - arranged for myself that I was to be the barrister I am ( with the slight addition of an enormous practice , which has not accrued ) , and also the married man I am not . ’
72304	72313	72096	72096	he	269	‘ The first you have often told me . ’
72314	72370	72096	72096	he	269	‘ The first I have often told you . Considering myself sufficiently incongruous on my legal eminence , I have until now suppressed my domestic destiny . You know M. R. F. , but not as well as I do . If you knew him as well as I do , he would amuse you . ’
72371	72377	72090	72090	He	269	‘ Filially spoken , Eugene ! ’
72378	72612	72096	72096	he	269	‘ Perfectly so , believe me ; and with every sentiment of affectionate deference towards M. R. F. But if he amuses me , I ca n’t help it . When my eldest brother was born , of course the rest of us knew ( I mean the rest of us would have known , if we had been in existence ) that he was heir to the Family Embarrassments — we call it before the company the Family Estate . But when my second brother was going to be born by - and - by , “ this , ” says M. R. F. , “ is a little pillar of the church . ” Was born , and became a pillar of the church ; a very shaky one . My third brother appeared , considerably in advance of his engagement to my mother ; but M. R. F. , not at all put out by surprise , instantly declared him a Circumnavigator . Was pitch - forked into the Navy , but has not circumnavigated . I announced myself and was disposed of with the highly satisfactory results embodied before you . When my younger brother was half an hour old , it was settled by M. R. F. that he should have a mechanical genius . And so on . Therefore I say that M. R. F. amuses me . ’
72613	72620	72090	72090	He	269	‘ Touching the lady , Eugene . ’
72621	72641	72096	72096	he	269	‘ There M. R. F. ceases to be amusing , because my intentions are opposed to touching the lady . ’
72642	72648	72096	72096	he	269	‘ Do you know her ? ’
72649	72655	72090	72090	He	269	‘ Not in the least . ’
72656	72664	72096	72096	he	269	‘ Had n’t you better see her ? ’
72665	72739	72096	72096	he	269	‘ My dear Mortimer , you have studied my character . Could I possibly go down there , labelled “ ELIGIBLE . ON VIEW , ” and meet the lady , similarly labelled ? Anything to carry out M. R. F. ’s arrangements , I am sure , with the greatest pleasure — except matrimony . Could I possibly support it ? I , so soon bored , so constantly , so fatally ? ’
72740	72751	72090	72090	He	269	‘ But you are not a consistent fellow , Eugene . ’
72752	72758	72096	72096	he	269	‘ In susceptibility to boredom , ’
72763	72775	72096	72096	he	269	‘ I assure you I am the most consistent of mankind . ’
72776	72796	72096	72096	he	269	‘ Why , it was but now that you were dwelling in the advantages of a monotony of two . ’
72797	72815	72816	72816	Mortimer	287	‘ In a lighthouse . Do me the justice to remember the condition . In a lighthouse . ’
72857	72896	72852	72852	he	269	‘ No , there is no help for it ; one of the prophetic deliveries of M. R. F. must for ever remain unfulfilled . With every disposition to oblige him , he must submit to a failure . ’
72944	72948	72950	72950	Eugene	269	‘ As if , ’
72952	72961	72962	72962	He	269	‘ as if the churchyard ghosts were rising . ’
73003	73026	72988	72988	he	269	‘ Apparently one of the ghosts has lost its way , and dropped in to be directed . Look at this phantom ! ’

73787	73797	73782	73782	YOU	929	’ jerked it into his stomach , as saying , ‘
73805	73819	73800	73800	YOU	929	’ To conclude , smacked his lips , as if all three replied , ‘

73915	73966	73880	73880	you	929	’m going to earn from five to ten thousand pound by the sweat of my brow ; and as a poor man doing justice to the sweat of my brow , is it likely I can afford to part with so much as my name without its being took down ? ’
74014	74017	74019	74019	Lightwood	466	‘ Now , ’
74021	74027	74019	74019	Lightwood	466	‘ what ’s your name ? ’

74530	74535	74537	74537	Riderhood	360	‘ On the grounds , ’
74546	74726	74537	74537	Riderhood	360	‘ that I was Gaffer ’s pardner , and suspected of him many a long day and many a dark night . On the grounds that I knowed his ways . On the grounds that I broke the pardnership because I see the danger ; which I warn you his daughter may tell you another story about that , for anythink I can say , but you know what it ’ll be worth , for she ’d tell you lies , the world round and the heavens broad , to save her father . On the grounds that it ’s well understood along the cause’ays and the stairs that he done it . On the grounds that he ’s fell off from , because he done it . On the grounds that I will swear he done it . On the grounds that you may take me where you will , and get me sworn to it . I do n’t want to back out of the consequences . I have made up MY mind . Take me anywheres . ’
74727	74733	74735	74735	Lightwood	466	‘ All this is nothing , ’
74737	74740	74742	74742	Riderhood	360	‘ Nothing ? ’
74748	74794	74742	74742	Riderhood	360	‘ Merely nothing . It goes to no more than that you suspect this man of the crime . You may do so with some reason , or you may do so with no reason , but he can not be convicted on your suspicion . ’
74795	74834	74836	74836	he	466	‘ Have n’t I said — I appeal to the T’other Governor as my witness — haven’t I said from the first minute that I opened my mouth in this here world - without - end - everlasting chair ’

74895	74923	74836	74836	he	466	‘ Surely not ; but you only offer to swear to your suspicion , and I tell you it is not enough to swear to your suspicion . ’
74924	74935	74936	74936	he	466	‘ Not enough , ai n’t it , Lawyer Lightwood ? ’
74940	74944	74936	74936	he	466	‘ Positively not . ’
74945	74972	74836	74836	he	466	‘ And did I say it WAS enough ? Now , I appeal to the T’other Governor . Now , fair ! Did I say so ? ’
74973	74987	74988	74988	Eugene	269	‘ He certainly has not said that he had no more to tell , ’

75298	75326	75289	75289	he	2507	’ replied Riderhood , always beating it out , with his head determinedly set askew , and his eyes watchfully dividing their attention between his two auditors , ‘
75401	75405	75388	75388	he	2507	’m a liar . ’
75406	75412	75400	75400	I	0	‘ What did he say ? ’
75413	75493	75400	75400	I	0	‘ I ’ll tell you ( take me down , T’other Governor , I ask no better ) . He come out first ; I come out last . I might be a minute arter him ; I might be half a minute , I might be a quarter of a minute ; I can not swear to that , and therefore I wo n’t . That ’s knowing the obligations of a Alfred David , ai n’t it ? ’
75494	75498	75388	75388	he	2507	‘ Go on . ’
75499	75523	75400	75400	I	0	‘ I found him a waiting to speak to me . He says to me , “ Rogue Riderhood”—for that ’s the name I ’m

75556	75557	75548	75548	Roger	470	’ ‘
75558	75869	75388	75388	he	2507	’ Scuse ME , Lawyer Lightwood , it ’s a part of the truth , and as such I do mind it , and I must mind it and I will mind it . “ Rogue Riderhood , ” he says , “ words passed betwixt us on the river tonight . ” Which they had ; ask his daughter ! “ I threatened you , ” he says , “ to chop you over the fingers with my boat ’s stretcher , or take a aim at your brains with my boathook . I did so on accounts of your looking too hard at what I had in tow , as if you was suspicious , and on accounts of your holding on to the gunwale of my boat . ” I says to him , “ Gaffer , I know it . ” He says to me , “ Rogue Riderhood , you are a man in a dozen”—I think he said in a score , but of that I am not positive , so take the lowest figure , for precious be the obligations of a Alfred David . “ And , ” he says , “ when your fellow - men is up , be it their lives or be it their watches , sharp is ever the word with you . Had you suspicions ? ” I says , “ Gaffer , I had ; and what ’s more , I have . ” He falls a shaking , and he says , “ Of what ? ” I says , “ Of foul play . ” He falls a shaking worse , and he says , “ There WAS foul play then . I done it for his money . Do n’t betray me ! ” Those were the words as ever he used . ’
75918	75922	75924	75924	Lightwood	466	‘ What more ? ’
75926	75936	75924	75924	Lightwood	466	‘ Of him , d’ye mean , Lawyer Lightwood ? ’
75937	75944	75956	75957	Governors Both	465	‘ Of anything to the purpose . ’
75945	75949	75924	75924	Lightwood	466	‘ Now , I ’m

76129	76215	76124	76124	I	0	’ Having given these words a swing to make them mount the higher and go the further , Rogue Riderhood poured himself out another glass of wine unbidden , and seemed to chew it , as , with the half - emptied glass in his hand , he stared at the candles . Mortimer glanced at Eugene , but Eugene sat glowering at his paper , and would give him no responsive glance . Mortimer again turned to the informer , to whom he said : ‘
76229	76249	76250	76250	Hages	472	’ Giving his wine a final chew , and swallowing it , the informer answered in a single word : ‘
76252	76253	76250	76250	Hages	472	’ ‘
76285	76291	76314	76314	I	0	’ said Mortimer , impatiently . ‘
76294	76312	76314	76314	I	0	’ Mr Riderhood very slowly and hoarsely chimed in , with several retrospective nods of his head . ‘

76392	76413	76388	76388	he	2519	’ said Eugene , drawing a lady ’s head upon his writing - paper , and touching it at intervals , ‘
76426	76427	76388	76388	he	2519	’ ‘
76492	76605	76613	76613	Eugene	269	’ ouse , it wo n’t run away,—there lives the lady , she ai n’t likely to be struck dead afore you get there — ask her!—but I could n’t do it . At last , out comes the new bill with your own lawful name , Lawyer Lightwood , printed to it , and then I asks the question of my own intellects , Am I to have this trouble on my mind for ever ? Am I never to throw it off ? Am I always to think more of Gaffer than of my own self ? If he ’s got a daughter , ai n’t I got a daughter ? ’
76606	76612	76613	76613	Eugene	269	‘ And echo answered — ? ’
76616	76622	76624	76625	Mr Riderhood	360	‘ “ You have , ” ’
76632	76644	76646	76646	Eugene	269	‘ Incidentally mentioning , at the same time , her age ? ’
76648	76688	76690	76691	Mr Riderhood	360	‘ Yes , governor . Two - and - twenty last October . And then I put it to myself , “ Regarding the money . It is a pot of money . ” For it IS a pot , ’
76696	76702	76690	76691	Mr Riderhood	360	‘ and why deny it ? ’
76703	76706	76710	76710	he	269	‘ Hear ! ’
76715	76823	76710	76710	he	269	‘ “ It is a pot of money ; but is it a sin for a labouring man that moistens every crust of bread he earns , with his tears — or if not with them , with the colds he catches in his head — is it a sin for that man to earn it ? Say there is anything again earning it . ” This I put to myself strong , as in duty bound ; “ how can it be said without blaming Lawyer Lightwood for offering it to be earned ? ” And was it for ME to blame Lawyer Lightwood ? No . ’
76824	76827	76829	76829	Eugene	269	‘ No , ’
76831	76837	76829	76829	Eugene	269	‘ Certainly not , Governor , ’
76842	76878	76879	76879	he	360	‘ So I made up my mind to get my trouble off my mind , and to earn by the sweat of my brow what was held out to me . And what ’s more , ’
76886	76948	76879	76879	he	360	‘ I mean to have it ! And now I tell you , once and away , Lawyer Lightwood , that Jesse Hexam , commonly called Gaffer , his hand and no other , done the deed , on his own confession to me . And I give him up to you , and I want him took . This night ! ’
76993	77012	76980	76981	Mortimer Lightwood	287	‘ I suppose I must go with this fellow to our imperturbable friend at the police - station . ’
77013	77017	77019	77019	Eugene	269	‘ I suppose , ’
77021	77029	77019	77019	Eugene	269	‘ there is no help for it . ’
77030	77036	76980	76981	Mortimer Lightwood	287	‘ Do you believe him ? ’
77037	77065	76980	76981	Mortimer Lightwood	287	‘ I believe him to be a thorough rascal . But he may tell the truth , for his own purpose , and for this occasion only . ’
77066	77074	77019	77019	Eugene	269	‘ It does n’t look like it . ’
77075	77080	77082	77082	Eugene	269	‘ HE does n’t , ’
77084	77121	77082	77082	Eugene	269	‘ But neither is his late partner , whom he denounces , a prepossessing person . The firm are cut - throat Shepherds both , in appearance . I should like to ask him one thing . ’

77232	77240	77197	77199	The honest man	2524	‘ And you implicate no other person ? ’
77241	77255	77197	77199	The honest man	2524	‘ It ai n’t what I implicate , it ’s what Gaffer implicated , ’
77263	77290	77197	77199	The honest man	2524	‘ I do n’t pretend to know more than that his words to me was , “ I done it . ” Those was his words . ’

77322	77333	77320	77320	Lightwood	287	‘ and give this fellow time to think of it . ’
77393	77403	77405	77405	Lightwood	287	‘ Now , if you will take the lead , ’
77407	77424	77405	77405	Lightwood	287	‘ Mr Wrayburn and I will follow . You know where to go , I suppose ? ’

78699	78726	78727	78727	Reserve	2562	’ said he , taking his hat from its peg , and putting a pair of handcuffs in his pocket as if they were his gloves . ‘

78741	78746	78734	78734	You	2562	’ Reserve again saluted . ‘
78781	78848	78779	78779	gentlemen	8832	’ As the three went out together , and Riderhood slouched off from under the trembling lamp his separate way , Lightwood asked the officer what he thought of this ? Mr Inspector replied , with due generality and reticence , that it was always more likely that a man had done a bad thing than that he had n’t . That he himself had several times ‘
78851	78898	78779	78779	gentlemen	8832	’ Gaffer , but had never been able to bring him to a satisfactory criminal total . That if this story was true , it was only in part true . That the two men , very shy characters , would have been jointly and pretty equally ‘
78902	78908	78779	78779	gentlemen	8832	’ but that this man had ‘
78910	78922	78924	78924	I	0	’ the other , to save himself and get the money . ‘
78927	78935	78924	78924	I	0	’ added Mr Inspector , in conclusion , ‘

79017	79025	79015	79015	Eugene	269	’ said Lightwood , over his shoulder . ‘
79033	79034	79026	79026	You	269	’ ‘
79038	79048	79026	79026	You	269	’ returned that unmoved barrister - at - law , ‘
79060	79115	79026	79026	You	269	’ Chapter 13 TRACKING THE BIRD OF PREY The two lime merchants , with their escort , entered the dominions of Miss Abbey Potterson , to whom their escort ( presenting them and their pretended business over the half - door of the bar , in a confidential way ) preferred his figurative request that ‘
79120	79207	79208	79208	They	2571	’ might be lighted in Cosy . Always well disposed to assist the constituted authorities , Miss Abbey bade Bob Gliddery attend the gentlemen to that retreat , and promptly enliven it with fire and gaslight . Of this commission the bare - armed Bob , leading the way with a flaming wisp of paper , so speedily acquitted himself , that Cosy seemed to leap out of a dark sleep and embrace them warmly , the moment they passed the lintels of its hospitable door . ‘
79215	79227	79208	79208	They	2571	’ said Mr Inspector , as a piece of local intelligence . ‘
79236	79271	79229	79229	you	2572	’ The answer being By all means , Bob Gliddery received his instructions from Mr Inspector , and departed in a becoming state of alacrity engendered by reverence for the majesty of the law . ‘
79278	79283	79229	79229	you	2572	’ said Mr Inspector , ‘
79294	79304	79285	79292	this man we have received our information from	2574	’ indicating Riderhood with his thumb over his shoulder , ‘
79366	79378	79357	79364	one of the opposite sex of my acquaintance	2579	’ vaguely indicating Miss Abbey with his thumb over his shoulder , ‘
79388	79406	79357	79364	one of the opposite sex of my acquaintance	2579	’ Then probably Mr Inspector was not quite unprepared for their visit that evening ? Lightwood hinted . ‘
79411	79416	79357	79364	one of the opposite sex of my acquaintance	2579	’ said Mr Inspector , ‘
79589	79590	79593	79596	a shipper of lime	2585	’ ‘
79598	79602	79593	79596	a shipper of lime	2585	’ began Eugene . ‘
79618	79623	79615	79615	you	2580	’ said Mr Inspector . ‘
79628	79632	79633	79634	my father	8756	’ said Eugene ; ‘

79738	79750	79735	79735	I	0	’ said Lightwood , pushing his friend aside with a laugh , ‘

79772	79780	79763	79763	gentlemen	8832	’ said Mr Inspector , with coolness . ‘

79815	79819	79809	79810	a boy	9216	’ remarked Eugene . ‘
79825	79826	79820	79820	He	9216	’ ‘
79829	79834	79820	79820	He	9216	’ said Mr Inspector . ‘
79847	79848	79841	79841	He	9216	’ ‘
79856	79860	79861	79861	She	9216	’ asked Eugene . ‘
79866	79871	79861	79861	She	9216	’ said Mr Inspector , ‘
79874	80096	79861	79861	She	9216	’ Bob ’s reappearance with a steaming jug broke off the conversation . But although the jug steamed forth a delicious perfume , its contents had not received that last happy touch which the surpassing finish of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters imparted on such momentous occasions . Bob carried in his left hand one of those iron models of sugar - loaf hats , before mentioned , into which he emptied the jug , and the pointed end of which he thrust deep down into the fire , so leaving it for a few moments while he disappeared and reappeared with three bright drinking - glasses . Placing these on the table and bending over the fire , meritoriously sensible of the trying nature of his duty , he watched the wreaths of steam , until at the special instant of projection he caught up the iron vessel and gave it one delicate twirl , causing it to send forth one gentle hiss . Then he restored the contents to the jug ; held over the steam of the jug , each of the three bright glasses in succession ; finally filled them all , and with a clear conscience awaited the applause of his fellow - creatures . It was bestowed ( Mr Inspector having proposed as an appropriate sentiment ‘
80101	80238	79861	79861	She	9216	’ ) and Bob withdrew to report the commendations of the guests to Miss Abbey in the bar . It may be here in confidence admitted that , the room being close shut in his absence , there had not appeared to be the slightest reason for the elaborate maintenance of this same lime fiction . Only it had been regarded by Mr Inspector as so uncommonly satisfactory , and so fraught with mysterious virtues , that neither of his clients had presumed to question it . Two taps were now heard on the outside of the window . Mr Inspector , hastily fortifying himself with another glass , strolled out with a noiseless foot and an unoccupied countenance . As one might go to survey the weather and the general aspect of the heavenly bodies . ‘
80246	80255	80244	80244	Mortimer	287	’ said Eugene , in a low voice . ‘
80262	80263	80256	80256	I	0	’ ‘
80266	80270	80256	80256	I	0	’ said Lightwood . ‘
80275	80276	80256	80256	I	0	’ ‘
80359	80360	80353	80353	you	287	’ ‘
80363	80367	80369	80369	you	287	’ returned Lightwood . ‘
80371	80372	80369	80369	you	287	’ ‘
80377	81221	81222	81222	Father	878	’ Their escort strolled back again , and reported . Divested of its various lime - lights and shadows , his report went to the effect that Gaffer was away in his boat , supposed to be on his old look - out ; that he had been expected last high - water ; that having missed it for some reason or other , he was not , according to his usual habits at night , to be counted on before next high - water , or it might be an hour or so later ; that his daughter , surveyed through the window , would seem to be so expecting him , for the supper was not cooking , but set out ready to be cooked ; that it would be high - water at about one , and that it was now barely ten ; that there was nothing to be done but watch and wait ; that the informer was keeping watch at the instant of that present reporting , but that two heads were better than one ( especially when the second was Mr Inspector ’s ) ; and that the reporter meant to share the watch . And forasmuch as crouching under the lee of a hauled - up boat on a night when it blew cold and strong , and when the weather was varied with blasts of hail at times , might be wearisome to amateurs , the reporter closed with the recommendation that the two gentlemen should remain , for a while at any rate , in their present quarters , which were weather - tight and warm . They were not inclined to dispute this recommendation , but they wanted to know where they could join the watchers when so disposed . Rather than trust to a verbal description of the place , which might mislead , Eugene ( with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had ) would go out with Mr Inspector , note the spot , and come back . On the shelving bank of the river , among the slimy stones of a causeway — not the special causeway of the Six Jolly Fellowships , which had a landing - place of its own , but another , a little removed , and very near to the old windmill which was the denounced man ’s dwelling - place — were a few boats ; some , moored and already beginning to float ; others , hauled up above the reach of the tide . Under one of these latter , Eugene ’s companion disappeared . And when Eugene had observed its position with reference to the other boats , and had made sure that he could not miss it , he turned his eyes upon the building where , as he had been told , the lonely girl with the dark hair sat by the fire . He could see the light of the fire shining through the window . Perhaps it drew him on to look in . Perhaps he had come out with the express intention . That part of the bank having rank grass growing on it , there was no difficulty in getting close , without any noise of footsteps : it was but to scramble up a ragged face of pretty hard mud some three or four feet high and come upon the grass and to the window . He came to the window by that means . She had no other light than the light of the fire . The unkindled lamp stood on the table . She sat on the ground , looking at the brazier , with her face leaning on her hand . There was a kind of film or flicker on her face , which at first he took to be the fitful firelight ; but , on a second look , he saw that she was weeping . A sad and solitary spectacle , as shown him by the rising and the falling of the fire . It was a little window of but four pieces of glass , and was not curtained ; he chose it because the larger window near it was . It showed him the room , and the bills upon the wall respecting the drowned people starting out and receding by turns . But he glanced slightly at them , though he looked long and steadily at her . A deep rich piece of colour , with the brown flush of her cheek and the shining lustre of her hair , though sad and solitary , weeping by the rising and the falling of the fire . She started up . He had been so very still that he felt sure it was not he who had disturbed her , so merely withdrew from the window and stood near it in the shadow of the wall . She opened the door , and said in an alarmed tone , ‘
81230	81234	81226	81226	you	878	’ And again , ‘
81237	81245	81246	81246	Father	293	’ And once again , after listening , ‘
81258	81317	81252	81252	you	878	’ No response . As she re - entered at the door , he dropped over the bank and made his way back , among the ooze and near the hiding - place , to Mortimer Lightwood : to whom he told what he had seen of the girl , and how this was becoming very grim indeed . ‘
81329	81333	81334	81334	he	2608	’ said Eugene , ‘
81339	81340	81334	81334	he	2608	’ ‘
81345	81349	81334	81334	he	2608	’ suggested Lightwood . ‘
81376	81380	81367	81368	a Sneak	2610	’ said Eugene . ‘
81389	81412	81367	81368	a Sneak	2610	’ Lightwood helped him to some more of that stuff , but it had been cooling , and did n’t answer now . ‘
81415	81426	81367	81368	a Sneak	2610	’ said Eugene , spitting it out among the ashes . ‘
81435	81436	81367	81368	a Sneak	2610	’ ‘
81451	81452	81453	81453	I	0	’ ‘

81502	81506	81497	81497	you	0	’ returned Eugene . ‘

81575	81683	81562	81562	they	354	’ Thereupon he stirred the fire , and sat down on one side of it . It struck eleven , and he made believe to compose himself patiently . But gradually he took the fidgets in one leg , and then in the other leg , and then in one arm , and then in the other arm , and then in his chin , and then in his back , and then in his forehead , and then in his hair , and then in his nose ; and then he stretched himself recumbent on two chairs , and groaned ; and then he started up . ‘

81733	81766	81727	81727	I	0	’ said Lightwood , sitting up facing him , with a tumbled head ; after going through some wonderful evolutions , in which his head had been the lowest part of him . ‘

81879	81920	81873	81873	Her	268	’ Mortimer rang the bell to pay the score , and Bob appeared to transact that business with him : whom Eugene , in his careless extravagance , asked if he would like a situation in the lime - trade ? ‘
81927	81931	81924	81925	no sir	2623	’ said Bob . ‘
81941	81942	81939	81939	sir	8755	’ ‘
81952	81956	81924	81925	no sir	2623	’ returned Eugene , ‘

81982	81986	81924	81925	no sir	2623	’ said Bob . ‘

82102	82110	82112	82112	Eugene	269	‘ I am in a ridiculous humour , ’
82114	82128	82112	82112	Eugene	269	‘ I am a ridiculous fellow . Everything is ridiculous . Come along ! ’
82216	82226	82228	82228	Eugene	269	‘ There ’s where she sits , you see , ’
82246	82255	82228	82228	Eugene	269	‘ There ’s the light of her fire . ’
82256	82266	82268	82268	Mortimer	287	‘ I ’ll take a peep through the window , ’
82270	82276	82268	82268	Mortimer	287	‘ No , do n’t ! ’
82284	82300	82301	82301	He	269	‘ Best , not make a show of her . Come to our honest friend . ’
82345	82351	82353	82353	Eugene	269	‘ Mr Inspector at home ? ’
82355	82362	82353	82353	Eugene	269	‘ Here I am , sir . ’
82363	82383	82301	82301	He	269	‘ And our friend of the perspiring brow is at the far corner there ? Good . Anything happened ? ’
82384	82416	82353	82353	Eugene	269	‘ His daughter has been out , thinking she heard him calling , unless it was a sign to him to keep out of the way . It might have been . ’
82417	82425	82427	82427	Eugene	269	‘ It might have been Rule Britannia , ’
82429	82437	82427	82427	Eugene	269	‘ but it was n’t . Mortimer ! ’
82438	82441	82353	82353	Eugene	269	‘ Here ! ’
82452	82461	82353	82353	Eugene	269	‘ Two burglaries now , and a forgery ! ’
82854	82942	82976	82976	you	2643	’ advantage ? The honest man who had expended the sweat of his brow became uneasy , and began to complain with bitterness of the proneness of mankind to cheat him — him invested with the dignity of Labour ! Their retreat was so chosen that while they could watch the river , they could watch the house . No one had passed in or out , since the daughter thought she heard the father calling . No one could pass in or out without being seen . ‘
82951	82956	82976	82976	you	2643	’ said Mr Inspector , ‘

83262	83316	83255	83255	Eugene	269	‘ it would be , that to tip a whistle is to advertise mystery and invite speculation . My honourable and gallant friend will , I trust , excuse me , as an independent member , for throwing out a remark which I feel to be due to this house and the country . ’

83388	83417	83365	83365	Eugene	269	‘ I can have no hesitation in replying ( it not being inconsistent with the public service ) that those accents were the accents of the T’other Governor . ’
83418	83442	83444	83445	the informer	2499	‘ You ’ve tolerable good eyes , ai n’t you , Governor ? You ’ve all tolerable good eyes , ai n’t you ? ’
83449	83503	83365	83365	Eugene	269	‘ Then if I row up under the Fellowship and lay there , no need to whistle . You ’ll make out that there ’s a speck of something or another there , and you ’ll know it ’s me , and you ’ll come down that cause’ay to me . Understood all ? ’

84042	84113	84039	84040	no Gaffer	2666	’ So spake Riderhood , staring disconsolate . As if with one accord , they all turned their eyes towards the light of the fire shining through the window . It was fainter and duller . Perhaps fire , like the higher animal and vegetable life it helps to sustain , has its greatest tendency towards death , when the night is dying and the day is not yet born . ‘

84327	84351	84353	84353	he	8828	’ There was a little backwardness in complying , for the freight looked too much for the boat ; but on Riderhood ’s protesting ‘
84389	84414	84370	84370	she	841	’ they carefully took their places , and trimmed the crazy thing . While they were doing so , Riderhood still sat staring disconsolate . ‘

84523	84556	84557	84557	I	0	’ cried Eugene ( he had recovered immediately on embarking ) , as they bumped heavily against a pile ; and then in a lower voice reversed his late apostrophe by remarking ( ‘
84617	84812	85182	85184	the honest man	2524	’ Indeed he had the full benefit of it , and it so mauled him , though he bent his head low and tried to present nothing but the mangy cap to it , that he dropped under the lee of a tier of shipping , and they lay there until it was over . The squall had come up , like a spiteful messenger before the morning ; there followed in its wake a ragged tear of light which ripped the dark clouds until they showed a great grey hole of day . They were all shivering , and everything about them seemed to be shivering ; the river itself ; craft , rigging , sails , such early smoke as there yet was on the shore . Black with wet , and altered to the eye by white patches of hail and sleet , the huddled buildings looked lower than usual , as if they were cowering , and had shrunk with the cold . Very little life was to be seen on either bank , windows and doors were shut , and the staring black and white letters upon wharves and warehouses ‘
84815	84821	85182	85184	the honest man	2524	’ said Eugene to Mortimer , ‘
84831	84991	85182	85184	the honest man	2524	’ As they glided slowly on , keeping under the shore and sneaking in and out among the shipping by back - alleys of water , in a pilfering way that seemed to be their boatman ’s normal manner of progression , all the objects among which they crept were so huge in contrast with their wretched boat , as to threaten to crush it . Not a ship ’s hull , with its rusty iron links of cable run out of hawse - holes long discoloured with the iron ’s rusty tears , but seemed to be there with a fell intention . Not a figure - head but had the menacing look of bursting forward to run them down . Not a sluice gate , or a painted scale upon a post or wall , showing the depth of water , but seemed to hint , like the dreadfully facetious Wolf in bed in Grandmamma ’s cottage , ‘
85002	85171	85182	85184	the honest man	2524	’ Not a lumbering black barge , with its cracked and blistered side impending over them , but seemed to suck at the river with a thirst for sucking them under . And everything so vaunted the spoiling influences of water — discoloured copper , rotten wood , honey - combed stone , green dank deposit — that the after - consequences of being crushed , sucked under , and drawn down , looked as ugly to the imagination as the main event . Some half - hour of this work , and Riderhood unshipped his sculls , stood holding on to a barge , and hand over hand long - wise along the barge ’s side gradually worked his boat under her head into a secret little nook of scummy water . And driven into that nook , and wedged as he had described , was Gaffer ’s boat ; that boat with the stain still in it , bearing some resemblance to a muffled human form . ‘
85176	85180	85182	85184	the honest man	2524	’m a liar ! ’

85803	85840	85787	85788	Mr Inspector	288	‘ you have had more practice in this than I have had , and ought to be a better workman at it . Undo the tow - rope , and we ’ll help you haul in . ’

He carries with him this coil of rope . He always carries with him this coil of rope . It ’s as well known to me as he was himself . Sometimes it lay in the bottom of his boat . Sometimes he hung it loose round his neck . He was a light - dresser was this man;—you see ? ’

88555	88567	88545	88546	Mr Boffin	324	‘ It was Secretary that you named ; was n’t it ? ’
88568	88573	88575	88576	Mr Rokesmith	315	‘ I said Secretary , ’
88578	88587	88589	88590	Mr Boffin	324	‘ It rather puzzled me at the time , ’
88592	88672	88589	88590	Mr Boffin	324	‘ and it rather puzzled me and Mrs Boffin when we spoke of it afterwards , because ( not to make a mystery of our belief ) we have always believed a Secretary to be a piece of furniture , mostly of mahogany , lined with green baize or leather , with a lot of little drawers in it . Now , you wo n’t think I take a liberty when I mention that you certainly ai n’t THAT . ’
88692	88702	88704	88705	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Why , as to Steward , you see , ’
88715	88752	88753	88754	Mr Rokesmith	315	‘ the odds are that Mrs Boffin and me may never go upon the water . Being both bad sailors , we should want a Steward if we did ; but there ’s generally one provided . ’

Relinquishing his hat and gloves , Mr Rokesmith sat down quietly at the table , arranged the open papers into an orderly heap , cast his eyes over each in succession , folded it , docketed it on the outside , laid it in a second heap , and , when that second heap was complete and the first gone , took from his pocket a piece of string and tied it together with a remarkably dexterous hand at a running curve and a loop . ‘

89862	89970	89859	89860	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Perhaps . Anyhow , he named to me that the house had a board up , “ This Eminently Aristocratic Mansion to be let or sold . ” Me and Mrs Boffin went to look at it , and finding it beyond a doubt Eminently Aristocratic ( though a trifle high and dull , which after all may be part of the same thing ) took it . My literary man was so friendly as to drop into a charming piece of poetry on that occasion , in which he complimented Mrs Boffin on coming into possession of — how did it go , my dear ? ’
89975	89996	89971	89972	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ “ The gay , the gay and festive scene , The halls , the halls of dazzling light . ” ’

Mrs Boffin took the opportunity of his being so engaged , to get a better observation of his face than she had yet taken . It impressed her in his favour , for she nodded aside to Mr Boffin , ‘

90671	90672	90668	90669	Mr Boffin	324	’ ‘

90710	91095	90697	90697	I	0	’ said Mr Boffin . And he and Mrs Boffin led the way . A gloomy house the Bower , with sordid signs on it of having been , through its long existence as Harmony Jail , in miserly holding . Bare of paint , bare of paper on the walls , bare of furniture , bare of experience of human life . Whatever is built by man for man ’s occupation , must , like natural creations , fulfil the intention of its existence , or soon perish . This old house had wasted — more from desuetude than it would have wasted from use , twenty years for one . A certain leanness falls upon houses not sufficiently imbued with life ( as if they were nourished upon it ) , which was very noticeable here . The staircase , balustrades , and rails , had a spare look — an air of being denuded to the bone — which the panels of the walls and the jambs of the doors and windows also bore . The scanty moveables partook of it ; save for the cleanliness of the place , the dust into which they were all resolving would have lain thick on the floors ; and those , both in colour and in grain , were worn like old faces that had kept much alone . The bedroom where the clutching old man had lost his grip on life , was left as he had left it . There was the old grisly four - post bedstead , without hangings , and with a jail - like upper rim of iron and spikes ; and there was the old patch - work counterpane . There was the tight - clenched old bureau , receding atop like a bad and secret forehead ; there was the cumbersome old table with twisted legs , at the bed - side ; and there was the box upon it , in which the will had lain . A few old chairs with patch - work covers , under which the more precious stuff to be preserved had slowly lost its quality of colour without imparting pleasure to any eye , stood against the wall . A hard family likeness was on all these things . ‘
91105	91110	91103	91103	Rokesmith	315	’ said Mr Boffin , ‘
91195	91215	91235	91235	We	2798	’ As the Secretary looked all round it , his eyes rested on a side door in a corner . ‘
91219	91228	91235	91235	We	2798	’ said Mr Boffin , unlocking the door , ‘
91332	91333	91315	91316	Mrs Boffin	324	’ ‘

91460	91566	91456	91458	poor little children	2826	’ said Mrs Boffin . They had opened the door at the bottom of the staircase giving on the yard , and they stood in the sunlight , looking at the scrawl of the two unsteady childish hands two or three steps up the staircase . There was something in this simple memento of a blighted childhood , and in the tenderness of Mrs Boffin , that touched the Secretary . Mr Boffin then showed his new man of business the Mounds , and his own particular Mound which had been left him as his legacy under the will before he acquired the whole estate . ‘
91575	91580	91456	91458	poor little children	2826	’ said Mr Boffin , ‘
91607	91682	91683	91683	You	2828	’ At the treasures of the yard , and at the outside of the house , and at the detached building which Mr Boffin pointed out as the residence of himself and his wife during the many years of their service , the Secretary looked with interest . It was not until Mr Boffin had shown him every wonder of the Bower twice over , that he remembered his having duties to discharge elsewhere . ‘

He now darted it at his patron , who took it , and felt his mind relieved of a great weight : observing that as they had arranged their joint affairs so satisfactorily , he would now be glad to look into those of Bully Sawyers . Which , indeed , had been left over - night in a very unpromising posture , and for whose impending expedition against the Persians the weather had been by no means favourable all day . Mr Wegg resumed his spectacles therefore . But Sawyers was not to be of the party that night ; for , before Wegg had found his place , Mrs Boffin ’s tread was heard upon the stairs , so unusually heavy and hurried , that Mr Boffin would have started up at the sound , anticipating some occurrence much out of the common course , even though she had not also called to him in an agitated tone . Mr Boffin hurried out , and found her on the dark staircase , panting , with a lighted candle in her hand . ‘

93989	94056	93980	93980	I	0	’ Much surprised , Mr Boffin went up stairs and accompanied Mrs Boffin into their own room : a second large room on the same floor as the room in which the late proprietor had died . Mr Boffin looked all round him , and saw nothing more unusual than various articles of folded linen on a large chest , which Mrs Boffin had been sorting . ‘
94067	94073	94090	94090	she	919	’re frightened ! YOU frightened ? ’
94074	94084	94090	94090	she	919	‘ I am not one of that sort certainly , ’
94107	94114	94090	94090	she	919	‘ but it ’s very strange ! ’
94115	94122	94090	94090	she	919	‘ What is , my dear ? ’
94123	94145	94090	94090	she	919	‘ Noddy , the faces of the old man and the two children are all over the house to - night . ’

94192	94209	94090	94090	she	919	‘ I do n’t know that I think I saw them anywhere . I felt them . ’
94210	94214	94090	94090	she	919	‘ Touched them ? ’
94215	94266	94090	94090	she	919	‘ No . Felt them in the air . I was sorting those things on the chest , and not thinking of the old man or the children , but singing to myself , when all in a moment I felt there was a face growing out of the dark . ’
94267	94271	94278	94278	him	8651	‘ What face ? ’
94280	94330	94278	94278	him	8651	‘ For a moment it was the old man ’s , and then it got younger . For a moment it was both the children ’s , and then it got older . For a moment it was a strange face , and then it was all the faces . ’
94331	94338	94090	94090	she	919	‘ And then it was gone ? ’
94339	94348	94090	94090	she	919	‘ Yes ; and then it was gone . ’
94349	94358	94090	94090	she	919	‘ Where were you then , old lady ? ’
94359	94465	94090	94090	she	919	‘ Here , at the chest . Well ; I got the better of it , and went on sorting , and went on singing to myself . “ Lor ! ” I says , “ I ’ll think of something else — something comfortable — and put it out of my head . ” So I thought of the new house and Miss Bella Wilfer , and was thinking at a great rate with that sheet there in my hand , when all of a sudden , the faces seemed to be hidden in among the folds of it and I let it drop . ’
94490	94498	94478	94479	Mr Boffin	324	‘ And then you ran down stairs ? ’
94499	94578	94090	94090	she	919	‘ No . I thought I ’d try another room , and shake it off . I says to myself , “ I ’ll go and walk slowly up and down the old man ’s room three times , from end to end , and then I shall have conquered it . ” I went in with the candle in my hand ; but the moment I came near the bed , the air got thick with them . ’
94579	94584	94478	94479	Mr Boffin	324	‘ With the faces ? ’
94585	94622	94623	94624	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Yes , and I even felt that they were in the dark behind the side - door , and on the little staircase , floating away into the yard . Then , I called you . ’
94654	94661	94663	94665	the Golden Dustman	10194	‘ I think , my dear , ’
94667	94725	94663	94665	the Golden Dustman	10194	‘ I ’ll at once get rid of Wegg for the night , because he ’s coming to inhabit the Bower , and it might be put into his head or somebody else ’s , if he heard this and it got about that the house is haunted . Whereas we know better . Do n’t we ? ’
94726	94737	94739	94740	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ I never had the feeling in the house before , ’
94742	94796	94739	94740	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ and I have been about it alone at all hours of the night . I have been in the house when Death was in it , and I have been in the house when Murder was a new part of its adventures , and I never had a fright in it yet . ’
94797	94806	94808	94809	Mr Boffin	324	‘ And wo n’t again , my dear , ’
94811	94827	94808	94809	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Depend upon it , it comes of thinking and dwelling on that dark spot . ’
94828	94839	94841	94842	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Yes ; but why did n’t it come before ? ’
95073	95079	95081	95082	Mr Boffin	324	‘ There , my dear ! ’
95090	95107	95081	95082	Mr Boffin	324	‘ That was the treatment , you see . Completely worked round , have n’t you ? ’

95162	95172	95159	95160	Mr Boffin	324	‘ But I ’ve only to shut my eyes . ’

Of course if you press it , Mr Boffin , I am ready to comply . But I should take it as a great favour if you would not press it without urgent occasion . ’
96257	96269	96242	96242	Lightwood	287	‘ Does your objection go to writing to Lightwood , Rokesmith ? ’
96270	96278	96318	96319	the Secretary	2769	‘ Not in the least , sir . ’
96279	96307	96242	96242	Lightwood	287	‘ Then perhaps you ’ll write him a line , and say he is free to do what he likes . I do n’t think it promises . ’
96308	96316	96318	96319	the Secretary	2769	‘ I do n’t think it promises , ’
96321	96331	96318	96319	the Secretary	2769	‘ Still , he may do what he likes . ’
96332	96403	96404	96405	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I will write immediately . Let me thank you for so considerately yielding to my disinclination . It may seem less unreasonable , if I avow to you that although I do n’t know Mr Lightwood , I have a disagreeable association connected with him . It is not his fault ; he is not at all to blame for it , and does not even know my name . ’
96535	96764	96523	96523	he	2769	’ Among his first occupations the pursuit of that orphan wanted by Mrs Boffin held a conspicuous place . From the earliest moment of his engagement he showed a particular desire to please her , and , knowing her to have this object at heart , he followed it up with unwearying alacrity and interest . Mr and Mrs Milvey had found their search a difficult one . Either an eligible orphan was of the wrong sex ( which almost always happened ) or was too old , or too young , or too sickly , or too dirty , or too much accustomed to the streets , or too likely to run away ; or , it was found impossible to complete the philanthropic transaction without buying the orphan . For , the instant it became known that anybody wanted the orphan , up started some affectionate relative of the orphan who put a price upon the orphan ’s head . The suddenness of an orphan ’s rise in the market was not to be paralleled by the maddest records of the Stock Exchange . He would be at five thousand per cent discount out at nurse making a mud pie at nine in the morning , and ( being inquired for ) would go up to five thousand per cent premium before noon . The market was ‘
96766	96846	96523	96523	he	2769	’ in various artful ways . Counterfeit stock got into circulation . Parents boldly represented themselves as dead , and brought their orphans with them . Genuine orphan - stock was surreptitiously withdrawn from the market . It being announced , by emissaries posted for the purpose , that Mr and Mrs Milvey were coming down the court , orphan scrip would be instantly concealed , and production refused , save on a condition usually stated by the brokers as ‘
96851	97347	97349	97349	his	2962	’ . Likewise , fluctuations of a wild and South - Sea nature were occasioned , by orphan - holders keeping back , and then rushing into the market a dozen together . But , the uniform principle at the root of all these various operations was bargain and sale ; and that principle could not be recognized by Mr and Mrs Milvey . At length , tidings were received by the Reverend Frank of a charming orphan to be found at Brentford . One of the deceased parents ( late his parishioners ) had a poor widowed grandmother in that agreeable town , and she , Mrs Betty Higden , had carried off the orphan with maternal care , but could not afford to keep him . The Secretary proposed to Mrs Boffin , either to go down himself and take a preliminary survey of this orphan , or to drive her down , that she might at once form her own opinion . Mrs Boffin preferring the latter course , they set off one morning in a hired phaeton , conveying the hammer - headed young man behind them . The abode of Mrs Betty Higden was not easy to find , lying in such complicated back settlements of muddy Brentford that they left their equipage at the sign of the Three Magpies , and went in search of it on foot . After many inquiries and defeats , there was pointed out to them in a lane , a very small cottage residence , with a board across the open doorway , hooked on to which board by the armpits was a young gentleman of tender years , angling for mud with a headless wooden horse and line . In this young sportsman , distinguished by a crisply curling auburn head and a bluff countenance , the Secretary descried the orphan . It unfortunately happened as they quickened their pace , that the orphan , lost to considerations of personal safety in the ardour of the moment , overbalanced himself and toppled into the street . Being an orphan of a chubby conformation , he then took to rolling , and had rolled into the gutter before they could come up . From the gutter he was rescued by John Rokesmith , and thus the first meeting with Mrs Higden was inaugurated by the awkward circumstance of their being in possession — one would say at first sight unlawful possession — of the orphan , upside down and purple in the countenance . The board across the doorway too , acting as a trap equally for the feet of Mrs Higden coming out , and the feet of Mrs Boffin and John Rokesmith going in , greatly increased the difficulty of the situation : to which the cries of the orphan imparted a lugubrious and inhuman character . At first , it was impossible to explain , on account of the orphan ’s ‘
97351	97742	97349	97349	his	2962	’ : a most terrific proceeding , super - inducing in the orphan lead - colour rigidity and a deadly silence , compared with which his cries were music yielding the height of enjoyment . But as he gradually recovered , Mrs Boffin gradually introduced herself ; and smiling peace was gradually wooed back to Mrs Betty Higden ’s home . It was then perceived to be a small home with a large mangle in it , at the handle of which machine stood a very long boy , with a very little head , and an open mouth of disproportionate capacity that seemed to assist his eyes in staring at the visitors . In a corner below the mangle , on a couple of stools , sat two very little children : a boy and a girl ; and when the very long boy , in an interval of staring , took a turn at the mangle , it was alarming to see how it lunged itself at those two innocents , like a catapult designed for their destruction , harmlessly retiring when within an inch of their heads . The room was clean and neat . It had a brick floor , and a window of diamond panes , and a flounce hanging below the chimney - piece , and strings nailed from bottom to top outside the window on which scarlet - beans were to grow in the coming season if the Fates were propitious . However propitious they might have been in the seasons that were gone , to Betty Higden in the matter of beans , they had not been very favourable in the matter of coins ; for it was easy to see that she was poor . She was one of those old women , was Mrs Betty Higden , who by dint of an indomitable purpose and a strong constitution fight out many years , though each year has come with its new knock - down blows fresh to the fight against her , wearied by it ; an active old woman , with a bright dark eye and a resolute face , yet quite a tender creature too ; not a logically - reasoning woman , but God is good , and hearts may count in Heaven as high as heads . ‘
97746	97756	97349	97349	his	2962	’ said she , when the business was opened , ‘
97790	97819	97784	97784	she	2964	’ The visitors glanced at the long boy , who seemed to indicate by a broader stare of his mouth and eyes that in him Sloppy stood confessed . ‘
97829	97833	97784	97784	she	2964	’ said Betty , ‘
97885	98006	97877	97877	He	496	’ The visitors again considered it a point of politeness to look at Sloppy , who , looking at them , suddenly threw back his head , extended his mouth to its utmost width , and laughed loud and long . At this the two innocents , with their brains in that apparent danger , laughed , and Mrs Higden laughed , and the orphan laughed , and then the visitors laughed . Which was more cheerful than intelligible . Then Sloppy seeming to be seized with an industrious mania or fury , turned to at the mangle , and impelled it at the heads of the innocents with such a creaking and rumbling , that Mrs Higden stopped him . ‘
98025	98026	98015	98015	Sloppy	496	’ ‘
98036	98041	98044	98044	ma’am	1643	’ said Mrs Boffin . ‘
98050	98051	98052	98052	Johnny	368	’ ‘
98056	98066	98052	98052	Johnny	368	’ cried Mrs Boffin , turning to the Secretary ; ‘
98087	98134	98081	98081	He	368	’ With his chin tucked down in his shy childish manner , he was looking furtively at Mrs Boffin out of his blue eyes , and reaching his fat dimpled hand up to the lips of the old woman , who was kissing it by times . ‘
98176	98177	98166	98166	she	2978	’ ‘
98186	98191	98166	98166	she	2978	’ said Mrs Boffin . ‘
98203	98204	98205	98205	Minders	2984	’ ‘
98207	98212	98205	98205	Minders	2984	’ the Secretary repeated . ‘
98262	98377	98260	98260	Poddles	499	’ Toddles was the pet - name of the boy ; Poddles of the girl . At their little unsteady pace , they came across the floor , hand - in - hand , as if they were traversing an extremely difficult road intersected by brooks , and , when they had had their heads patted by Mrs Betty Higden , made lunges at the orphan , dramatically representing an attempt to bear him , crowing , into captivity and slavery . All the three children enjoyed this to a delightful extent , and the sympathetic Sloppy again laughed long and loud . When it was discreet to stop the play , Betty Higden said ‘
98386	98409	98384	98384	Poddles	499	’ and they returned hand - in - hand across country , seeming to find the brooks rather swollen by late rains . ‘
98418	98435	98416	98416	Sloppy	496	’ said the Secretary , in doubt whether he was man , boy , or what . ‘
98441	98450	98451	98451	parents	10255	’ returned Betty Higden , dropping her voice ; ‘
98467	98474	98460	98460	He	2993	’ with a shiver of repugnance , ‘
98479	98480	98460	98460	He	2993	’ ‘
98486	98506	98507	98507	You	2998	’ said the Secretary . Mrs Higden set that resolute old face of hers , and darkly nodded yes . ‘
98514	98515	98507	98507	You	2998	’ ‘
98522	98528	98507	98507	You	2998	’ answered the old woman . ‘
98601	98662	98664	98664	I	0	’ A surprising spirit in this lonely woman after so many years of hard working , and hard living , my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards ! What is it that we call it in our grandiose speeches ? British independence , rather perverted ? Is that , or something like it , the ring of the ca nt ? ‘
98671	98818	98664	98664	I	0	’ said the dame , fondling the child—‘God help me and the like of me!—how the worn - out people that do come down to that , get driven from post to pillar and pillar to post , a - purpose to tire them out ! Do I never read how they are put off , put off , put off — how they are grudged , grudged , grudged , the shelter , or the doctor , or the drop of physic , or the bit of bread ? Do I never read how they grow heartsick of it and give it up , after having let themselves drop so low , and how they after all die out for want of help ? Then I say , I hope I can die as well as another , and I ’ll die without that disgrace . ’
98845	98851	98853	98854	old Betty	494	‘ Johnny , my pretty , ’
98870	99004	98853	98854	old Betty	494	‘ your old Granny Betty is nigher fourscore year than threescore and ten . She never begged nor had a penny of the Union money in all her life . She paid scot and she paid lot when she had money to pay ; she worked when she could , and she starved when she must . You pray that your Granny may have strength enough left her at the last ( she ’s strong for an old one , Johnny ) , to get up from her bed and run and hide herself and swown to death in a hole , sooner than fall into the hands of those Cruel Jacks we read of that dodge and drive , and worry and weary , and scorn and shame , the decent poor . ’
99074	99082	99084	99085	the Secretary	2769	‘ And does he work for you ? ’
99098	99101	99103	99103	Betty	494	‘ Yes , ’
99116	99121	99103	99103	Betty	494	‘ And well too . ’
99122	99128	99084	99085	the Secretary	2769	‘ Does he live here ? ’
99129	99198	99084	99085	the Secretary	2769	‘ He lives more here than anywhere . He was thought to be no better than a Natural , and first come to me as a Minder . I made interest with Mr Blogg the Beadle to have him as a Minder , seeing him by chance up at church , and thinking I might do something with him . For he was a weak ricketty creetur then . ’
99199	99208	99103	99103	Betty	494	‘ Is he called by his right name ? ’
99209	99240	99084	99085	the Secretary	2769	‘ Why , you see , speaking quite correctly , he has no right name . I always understood he took his name from being found on a Sloppy night . ’
99241	99248	99084	99085	the Secretary	2769	‘ He seems an amiable fellow . ’
99249	99263	99265	99265	Betty	494	‘ Bless you , sir , there ’s not a bit of him , ’
99267	99290	99265	99265	Betty	494	‘ that ’s not amiable . So you may judge how amiable he is , by running your eye along his heighth . ’
99436	99440	99442	99443	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ And now , ’
99445	99449	99442	99443	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ concerning Johnny . ’
99510	99518	99469	99469	his	368	‘ Yes , ma’am . Concerning Johnny . ’
99519	99529	99531	99532	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ If you trust the dear child to me , ’
99540	99576	99531	99532	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ he shall have the best of homes , the best of care , the best of education , the best of friends . Please God I will be a true good mother to him ! ’
99577	99601	99469	99469	his	368	‘ I am thankful to you , ma’am , and the dear child would be thankful if he was old enough to understand . ’
99612	99672	99469	99469	his	368	‘ I would n’t stand in the dear child ’s light , not if I had all my life before me instead of a very little of it . But I hope you wo n’t take it ill that I cleave to the child closer than words can tell , for he ’s the last living thing left me . ’
99673	99699	99531	99532	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Take it ill , my dear soul ? Is it likely ? And you so tender of him as to bring him home here ! ’
99700	99705	99707	99707	Betty	494	‘ I have seen , ’
99720	99796	99707	99707	Betty	494	‘ so many of them on my lap . And they are all gone but this one ! I am ashamed to seem so selfish , but I do n’t really mean it . It ’ll be the making of his fortune , and he ’ll be a gentleman when I am dead . I — I — don’t know what comes over me . I — try against it . Do n’t notice me ! ’
99971	99978	99980	99981	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ There , there , there ! ’
99995	100009	99985	99985	her	494	‘ Nothing is going to be done . Nobody need be frightened . We ’re

100028	100032	100017	100018	Mrs Higden	494	’ returned Betty . ‘
100043	100052	100040	100040	you	494	’ said Mrs Boffin in a lower voice . ‘
100064	100065	100040	100040	you	494	’ ‘
100076	100080	100081	100081	I	0	’ said Betty ; ‘

100123	100128	100113	100113	Johnny	368	’ returned Mrs Boffin ; ‘
100162	100171	100172	100172	Lor	482	’ Betty undertook that , cheerfully and readily . ‘
100174	100184	100172	100172	Lor	482	’ cried Mrs Boffin , looking radiantly about her , ‘
100218	100219	100220	100220	I	0	’ ‘
100225	100230	100223	100223	Sloppy	496	’ said Mrs Higden . ‘
100246	100251	100241	100241	him	3034	’ said Mrs Boffin . ‘
100285	100403	100404	100404	You	496	’ This still further brightened the face of affairs ; for , the highly sympathetic Sloppy , first broadly staring and grinning , and then roaring with laughter , Toddles and Poddles followed suit , and Johnny trumped the trick . T and P considering these favourable circumstances for the resumption of that dramatic descent upon Johnny , again came across - country hand - in - hand upon a buccaneering expedition ; and this having been fought out in the chimney corner behind Mrs Higden ’s chair , with great valour on both sides , those desperate pirates returned hand - in - hand to their stools , across the dry bed of a mountain torrent . ‘
100419	100425	100415	100415	Betty	494	’ said Mrs Boffin confidentially , ‘
100435	100436	100415	100415	Betty	494	’ ‘
100457	100467	100443	100443	ma’am	1643	’m strong . I can walk twenty mile if I ’m
100472	100489	100443	100443	ma’am	1643	’ Old Betty was proud , and said it with a sparkle in her bright eyes . ‘
100507	100512	100499	100499	you	496	’ returned Mrs Boffin . ‘
100527	100528	100525	100525	you	496	’ ‘
100534	100540	100525	100525	you	496	’ said Betty , smiling , ‘
100587	100599	100628	100628	Betty	505	’m not grateful , but I love to earn it better . ’
100600	100605	100607	100608	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Well , well ! ’
100610	100627	100628	100628	Betty	505	‘ I only spoke of little things , or I would n’t have taken the liberty . ’
100671	100844	100666	100666	she	505	‘ If I could have kept the dear child , without the dread that ’s always upon me of his coming to that fate I have spoken of , I could never have parted with him , even to you . For I love him , I love him , I love him ! I love my husband long dead and gone , in him ; I love my children dead and gone , in him ; I love my young and hopeful days dead and gone , in him . I could n’t sell that love , and look you in your bright kind face . It ’s a free gift . I am in want of nothing . When my strength fails me , if I can but die out quick and quiet , I shall be quite content . I have stood between my dead and that shame I have spoken of ; and it has been kept off from every one of them . Sewed into my gown , ’
100852	100913	100846	100846	her	3046	‘ is just enough to lay me in the grave . Only see that it ’s rightly spent , so as I may rest free to the last from that cruelty and disgrace , and you ’ll have done much more than a little thing for me , and all that in this present world my heart is set upon . ’
101369	101372	101374	101375	Miss Bella	307	‘ Eh ? ’
101390	101397	101374	101375	Miss Bella	307	‘ Oh ! It ’s you . ’
101398	101405	101374	101375	Miss Bella	307	‘ Only I. A fine evening ! ’
101406	101410	101412	101412	Bella	307	‘ Is it ? ’
101418	101438	101412	101412	Bella	307	‘ I suppose it is , now you mention it . I have not been thinking of the evening . ’
101439	101446	101374	101375	Miss Bella	307	‘ So intent upon your book ? ’
101447	101454	101456	101456	Bella	307	‘ Ye - e - es , ’
101464	101472	101456	101456	Bella	307	‘ A love story , Miss Wilfer ? ’
101473	101495	101374	101375	Miss Bella	307	‘ Oh dear no , or I should n’t be reading it . It ’s more about money than anything else . ’
101496	101508	101374	101375	Miss Bella	307	‘ And does it say that money is better than anything ? ’
101509	101514	101516	101516	Bella	307	‘ Upon my word , ’
101518	101547	101516	101516	Bella	307	‘ I forget what it says , but you can find out for yourself if you like , Mr Rokesmith . I do n’t want it any more . ’
101571	101584	101554	101554	she	2769	‘ I am charged with a message for you , Miss Wilfer . ’
101585	101591	101593	101593	Bella	307	‘ Impossible , I think ! ’
101599	101633	101593	101593	Bella	307	‘ From Mrs Boffin . She desired me to assure you of the pleasure she has in finding that she will be ready to receive you in another week or two at furthest . ’
101660	101671	101636	101636	her	307	‘ How did YOU come by the message , pray ? ’
101672	101691	101593	101593	Bella	307	‘ I have been waiting for an opportunity of telling you that I am Mr Boffin ’s Secretary . ’
101692	101700	101702	101703	Miss Bella	307	‘ I am as wise as ever , ’
101707	101723	101702	101703	Miss Bella	307	‘ for I do n’t know what a Secretary is . Not that it signifies . ’
101724	101729	101738	101738	he	2769	‘ Not at all . ’
101757	101770	101771	101771	she	307	‘ Then are you going to be always there , Mr Rokesmith ? ’
101782	101793	101771	101771	she	307	‘ Always ? No . Very much there ? Yes . ’
101794	101798	101800	101800	Bella	307	‘ Dear me ! ’
101808	101866	101800	101800	Bella	307	‘ But my position there as Secretary , will be very different from yours as guest . You will know little or nothing about me . I shall transact the business : you will transact the pleasure . I shall have my salary to earn ; you will have nothing to do but to enjoy and attract . ’
101867	101872	101874	101874	Bella	307	‘ Attract , sir ? ’
101887	101894	101874	101874	Bella	307	‘ I do n’t understand you . ’
101906	101920	101901	101902	Mr Rokesmith	315	‘ Excuse me ; when I first saw you in your black dress — ’
101922	101925	101901	101902	Mr Rokesmith	315	‘ There ! ’
101933	101949	101901	101902	Mr Rokesmith	315	‘ What did I say to them at home ? Everybody noticed that ridiculous mourning . ’
101951	101989	101901	101902	Mr Rokesmith	315	‘ When I first saw you in your black dress , I was at a loss to account for that distinction between yourself and your family . I hope it was not impertinent to speculate upon it ? ’
101990	101999	102001	102002	Miss Bella	307	‘ I hope not , I am sure , ’
102006	102019	102001	102002	Miss Bella	307	‘ But you ought to know best how you speculated upon it . ’
102034	102159	102023	102023	his	3067	‘ Since I have been entrusted with Mr Boffin ’s affairs , I have necessarily come to understand the little mystery . I venture to remark that I feel persuaded that much of your loss may be repaired . I speak , of course , merely of wealth , Miss Wilfer . The loss of a perfect stranger , whose worth , or worthlessness , I can not estimate — nor you either — is beside the question . But this excellent gentleman and lady are so full of simplicity , so full of generosity , so inclined towards you , and so desirous to — how shall I express it?—to make amends for their good fortune , that you have only to respond . ’
102185	102232	102234	102235	the Secretary	2769	‘ As we have been brought under one roof by an accidental combination of circumstances , which oddly extends itself to the new relations before us , I have taken the liberty of saying these few words . You do n’t consider them intrusive I hope ? ’
102239	102254	102256	102258	the young lady	1007	‘ Really , Mr Rokesmith , I ca n’t say what I consider them , ’
102260	102278	102256	102258	the young lady	1007	‘ They are perfectly new to me , and may be founded altogether on your own imagination . ’
102279	102284	102234	102235	the Secretary	2769	‘ You will see . ’
102326	102334	102336	102337	John Rokesmith	315	‘ I have been telling Miss Wilfer , ’
102347	102367	102340	102342	the majestic lady	3075	‘ that I have become , by a curious chance , Mr Boffin ’s Secretary or man of business . ’
102368	102373	102375	102376	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ I have not , ’
102394	102422	102379	102379	her	302	‘ the honour of any intimate acquaintance with Mr Boffin , and it is not for me to congratulate that gentleman on the acquisition he has made . ’
102423	102429	102431	102431	Rokesmith	315	‘ A poor one enough , ’
102433	102437	102431	102431	Rokesmith	315	‘ Pardon me , ’
102442	102482	102431	102431	Rokesmith	315	‘ the merits of Mr Boffin may be highly distinguished — may be more distinguished than the countenance of Mrs Boffin would imply — but it were the insanity of humility to deem him worthy of a better assistant . ’
102483	102509	102379	102379	her	302	‘ You are very good . I have also been telling Miss Wilfer that she is expected very shortly at the new residence in town . ’
102510	102515	102517	102518	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Having tacitly consented , ’
102535	102554	102517	102518	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ to my child ’s acceptance of the proffered attentions of Mrs Boffin , I interpose no objection . ’
102562	102572	102556	102557	Miss Bella	307	‘ Do n’t talk nonsense , ma , please . ’
102573	102576	102578	102579	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Peace ! ’
102581	102599	102578	102579	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ No , ma , I am not going to be made so absurd . Interposing objections ! ’
102600	102604	102606	102607	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ I say , ’

I trust that as a child of mine you will ever be sensible that it will be graceful in you , when associating with Mr and Mrs Boffin upon equal terms , to remember that the Secretary , Mr Rokesmith , as your father ’s lodger , has a claim on your good word . ’
103079	103105	103106	103106	he	2769	‘ So insolent , so trivial , so capricious , so mercenary , so careless , so hard to touch , so hard to turn ! ’

103142	103148	103152	103152	he	2769	‘ And if she knew ! ’
103806	104024	104025	104026	Nicodemus Boffin	318	‘ Supposing I was to be favoured with an order from Mr Boffin , my dear friend , it would be worth my while’—to do a certain thing that I hope might not prove wholly disagreeable to your feelings . But no one knows so well as the Secretary , who opens and reads the letters , what a set is made at the man marked by a stroke of notoriety . Oh the varieties of dust for ocular use , offered in exchange for the gold dust of the Golden Dustman ! Fifty - seven churches to be erected with half - crowns , forty - two parsonage houses to be repaired with shillings , seven - and - twenty organs to be built with halfpence , twelve hundred children to be brought up on postage stamps . Not that a half - crown , shilling , halfpenny , or postage stamp , would be particularly acceptable from Mr Boffin , but that it is so obvious he is the man to make up the deficiency . And then the charities , my Christian brother ! And mostly in difficulties , yet mostly lavish , too , in the expensive articles of print and paper . Large fat private double letter , sealed with ducal coronet . ‘
104136	104731	104126	104127	The Steward	3134	’ Friendly this , on the part of the Duke of Linseed ( and thoughtful in the postscript ) , only lithographed by the hundred and presenting but a pale individuality of an address to Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , in quite another hand . It takes two noble Earls and a Viscount , combined , to inform Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , in an equally flattering manner , that an estimable lady in the West of England has offered to present a purse containing twenty pounds , to the Society for Granting Annuities to Unassuming Members of the Middle Classes , if twenty individuals will previously present purses of one hundred pounds each . And those benevolent noblemen very kindly point out that if Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , should wish to present two or more purses , it will not be inconsistent with the design of the estimable lady in the West of England , provided each purse be coupled with the name of some member of his honoured and respected family . These are the corporate beggars . But there are , besides , the individual beggars ; and how does the heart of the Secretary fail him when he has to cope with THEM ! And they must be coped with to some extent , because they all enclose documents ( they call their scraps documents ; but they are , as to papers deserving the name , what minced veal is to a calf ) , the non - return of which would be their ruin . That is to say , they are utterly ruined now , but they would be more utterly ruined then . Among these correspondents are several daughters of general officers , long accustomed to every luxury of life ( except spelling ) , who little thought , when their gallant fathers waged war in the Peninsula , that they would ever have to appeal to those whom Providence , in its inscrutable wisdom , has blessed with untold gold , and from among whom they select the name of Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , for a maiden effort in this wise , understanding that he has such a heart as never was . The Secretary learns , too , that confidence between man and wife would seem to obtain but rarely when virtue is in distress , so numerous are the wives who take up their pens to ask Mr Boffin for money without the knowledge of their devoted husbands , who would never permit it ; while , on the other hand , so numerous are the husbands who take up their pens to ask Mr Boffin for money without the knowledge of their devoted wives , who would instantly go out of their senses if they had the least suspicion of the circumstance . There are the inspired beggars , too . These were sitting , only yesterday evening , musing over a fragment of candle which must soon go out and leave them in the dark for the rest of their nights , when surely some Angel whispered the name of Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , to their souls , imparting rays of hope , nay confidence , to which they had long been strangers ! Akin to these are the suggestively - befriended beggars . They were partaking of a cold potato and water by the flickering and gloomy light of a lucifer - match , in their lodgings ( rent considerably in arrear , and heartless landlady threatening expulsion ‘
104735	104752	104126	104127	The Steward	3134	’ into the streets ) , when a gifted friend happening to look in , said , ‘
104761	104985	104756	104759	Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire	318	’ and would take no denial . There are the nobly independent beggars too . These , in the days of their abundance , ever regarded gold as dross , and have not yet got over that only impediment in the way of their amassing wealth , but they want no dross from Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire ; No , Mr Boffin ; the world may term it pride , paltry pride if you will , but they would n’t take it if you offered it ; a loan , sir — for fourteen weeks to the day , interest calculated at the rate of five per cent per annum , to be bestowed upon any charitable institution you may name — is all they want of you , and if you have the meanness to refuse it , count on being despised by these great spirits . There are the beggars of punctual business - habits too . These will make an end of themselves at a quarter to one P.M. on Tuesday , if no Post - office order is in the interim received from Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire ; arriving after a quarter to one P.M. on Tuesday , it need not be sent , as they will then ( having made an exact memorandum of the heartless circumstances ) be ‘
104990	106319	104756	104759	Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire	318	’ There are the beggars on horseback too , in another sense from the sense of the proverb . These are mounted and ready to start on the highway to affluence . The goal is before them , the road is in the best condition , their spurs are on , the steed is willing , but , at the last moment , for want of some special thing — a clock , a violin , an astronomical telescope , an electrifying machine — they must dismount for ever , unless they receive its equivalent in money from Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire . Less given to detail are the beggars who make sporting ventures . These , usually to be addressed in reply under initials at a country post - office , inquire in feminine hands , Dare one who can not disclose herself to Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , but whose name might startle him were it revealed , solicit the immediate advance of two hundred pounds from unexpected riches exercising their noblest privilege in the trust of a common humanity ? In such a Dismal Swamp does the new house stand , and through it does the Secretary daily struggle breast - high . Not to mention all the people alive who have made inventions that wo n’t act , and all the jobbers who job in all the jobberies jobbed ; though these may be regarded as the Alligators of the Dismal Swamp , and are always lying by to drag the Golden Dustman under . But the old house . There are no designs against the Golden Dustman there ? There are no fish of the shark tribe in the Bower waters ? Perhaps not . Still , Wegg is established there , and would seem , judged by his secret proceedings , to cherish a notion of making a discovery . For , when a man with a wooden leg lies prone on his stomach to peep under bedsteads ; and hops up ladders , like some extinct bird , to survey the tops of presses and cupboards ; and provides himself an iron rod which he is always poking and prodding into dust - mounds ; the probability is that he expects to find something . BOOK THE SECOND — BIRDS OF A FEATHER Chapter 1 OF AN EDUCATIONAL CHARACTER The school at which young Charley Hexam had first learned from a book — the streets being , for pupils of his degree , the great Preparatory Establishment in which very much that is never unlearned is learned without and before book — was a miserable loft in an unsavoury yard . Its atmosphere was oppressive and disagreeable ; it was crowded , noisy , and confusing ; half the pupils dropped asleep , or fell into a state of waking stupefaction ; the other half kept them in either condition by maintaining a monotonous droning noise , as if they were performing , out of time and tune , on a ruder sort of bagpipe . The teachers , animated solely by good intentions , had no idea of execution , and a lamentable jumble was the upshot of their kind endeavours . It was a school for all ages , and for both sexes . The latter were kept apart , and the former were partitioned off into square assortments . But , all the place was pervaded by a grimly ludicrous pretence that every pupil was childish and innocent . This pretence , much favoured by the lady - visitors , led to the ghastliest absurdities . Young women old in the vices of the commonest and worst life , were expected to profess themselves enthralled by the good child ’s book , the Adventures of Little Margery , who resided in the village cottage by the mill ; severely reproved and morally squashed the miller , when she was five and he was fifty ; divided her porridge with singing birds ; denied herself a new nankeen bonnet , on the ground that the turnips did not wear nankeen bonnets , neither did the sheep who ate them ; who plaited straw and delivered the dreariest orations to all comers , at all sorts of unseasonable times . So , unwieldy young dredgers and hulking mudlarks were referred to the experiences of Thomas Twopence , who , having resolved not to rob ( under circumstances of uncommon atrocity ) his particular friend and benefactor , of eighteenpence , presently came into supernatural possession of three and sixpence , and lived a shining light ever afterwards . ( Note , that the benefactor came to no good . ) Several swaggering sinners had written their own biographies in the same strain ; it always appearing from the lessons of those very boastful persons , that you were to do good , not because it WAS good , but because you were to make a good thing of it . Contrariwise , the adult pupils were taught to read ( if they could learn ) out of the New Testament ; and by dint of stumbling over the syllables and keeping their bewildered eyes on the particular syllables coming round to their turn , were as absolutely ignorant of the sublime history , as if they had never seen or heard of it . An exceedingly and confoundingly perplexing jumble of a school , in fact , where black spirits and grey , red spirits and white , jumbled jumbled jumbled jumbled , jumbled every night . And particularly every Sunday night . For then , an inclined plane of unfortunate infants would be handed over to the prosiest and worst of all the teachers with good intentions , whom nobody older would endure . Who , taking his stand on the floor before them as chief executioner , would be attended by a conventional volunteer boy as executioner ’s assistant . When and where it first became the conventional system that a weary or inattentive infant in a class must have its face smoothed downward with a hot hand , or when and where the conventional volunteer boy first beheld such system in operation , and became inflamed with a sacred zeal to administer it , matters not . It was the function of the chief executioner to hold forth , and it was the function of the acolyte to dart at sleeping infants , yawning infants , restless infants , whimpering infants , and smooth their wretched faces ; sometimes with one hand , as if he were anointing them for a whisker ; sometimes with both hands , applied after the fashion of blinkers . And so the jumble would be in action in this department for a mortal hour ; the exponent drawling on to My Dearert Childerrenerr , let us say , for example , about the beautiful coming to the Sepulchre ; and repeating the word Sepulchre ( commonly used among infants ) five hundred times , and never once hinting what it meant ; the conventional boy smoothing away right and left , as an infallible commentary ; the whole hot - bed of flushed and exhausted infants exchanging measles , rashes , whooping - cough , fever , and stomach disorders , as if they were assembled in High Market for the purpose . Even in this temple of good intentions , an exceptionally sharp boy exceptionally determined to learn , could learn something , and , having learned it , could impart it much better than the teachers ; as being more knowing than they , and not at the disadvantage in which they stood towards the shrewder pupils . In this way it had come about that Charley Hexam had risen in the jumble , taught in the jumble , and been received from the jumble into a better school . ‘

106703	106741	106742	106742	I	0	’ The boy , with a return of that former reluctance or struggle or whatever it was , seemed to debate with himself . At length he said , raising his eyes to the master ’s face : ‘
106783	106784	106764	106764	you	291	’ ‘
106793	106798	106764	106764	you	291	’ asked the schoolmaster , ‘

106809	106816	106821	106822	Mr Headstone	517	’ said the boy , proudly , ‘
106845	106899	106821	106822	Mr Headstone	517	’ His confidence in her , sat more easily upon him than the indecision with which he had twice contended . It was his better nature to be true to her , if it were his worse nature to be wholly selfish . And as yet the better nature had the stronger hold . ‘
106908	106913	106902	106902	I	0	’ said the schoolmaster . ‘
106922	106923	106927	106928	Mr Headstone	517	’ ‘
106937	108148	106931	106931	I	0	’ Bradley Headstone , in his decent black coat and waistcoat , and decent white shirt , and decent formal black tie , and decent pantaloons of pepper and salt , with his decent silver watch in his pocket and its decent hair - guard round his neck , looked a thoroughly decent young man of six - and - twenty . He was never seen in any other dress , and yet there was a certain stiffness in his manner of wearing this , as if there were a want of adaptation between him and it , recalling some mechanics in their holiday clothes . He had acquired mechanically a great store of teacher ’s knowledge . He could do mental arithmetic mechanically , sing at sight mechanically , blow various wind instruments mechanically , even play the great church organ mechanically . From his early childhood up , his mind had been a place of mechanical stowage . The arrangement of his wholesale warehouse , so that it might be always ready to meet the demands of retail dealers — history here , geography there , astronomy to the right , political economy to the left — natural history , the physical sciences , figures , music , the lower mathematics , and what not , all in their several places — this care had imparted to his countenance a look of care ; while the habit of questioning and being questioned had given him a suspicious manner , or a manner that would be better described as one of lying in wait . There was a kind of settled trouble in the face . It was the face belonging to a naturally slow or inattentive intellect that had toiled hard to get what it had won , and that had to hold it now that it was gotten . He always seemed to be uneasy lest anything should be missing from his mental warehouse , and taking stock to assure himself . Suppression of so much to make room for so much , had given him a constrained manner , over and above . Yet there was enough of what was animal , and of what was fiery ( though smouldering ) , still visible in him , to suggest that if young Bradley Headstone , when a pauper lad , had chanced to be told off for the sea , he would not have been the last man in a ship ’s crew . Regarding that origin of his , he was proud , moody , and sullen , desiring it to be forgotten . And few people knew of it . In some visits to the Jumble his attention had been attracted to this boy Hexam . An undeniable boy for a pupil - teacher ; an undeniable boy to do credit to the master who should bring him on . Combined with this consideration , there may have been some thought of the pauper lad now never to be mentioned . Be that how it might , he had with pains gradually worked the boy into his own school , and procured him some offices to discharge there , which were repaid with food and lodging . Such were the circumstances that had brought together , Bradley Headstone and young Charley Hexam that autumn evening . Autumn , because full half a year had come and gone since the bird of prey lay dead upon the river - shore . The schools — for they were twofold , as the sexes — were down in that district of the flat country tending to the Thames , where Kent and Surrey meet , and where the railways still bestride the market - gardens that will soon die under them . The schools were newly built , and there were so many like them all over the country , that one might have thought the whole were but one restless edifice with the locomotive gift of Aladdin ’s palace . They were in a neighbourhood which looked like a toy neighbourhood taken in blocks out of a box by a child of particularly incoherent mind , and set up anyhow ; here , one side of a new street ; there , a large solitary public - house facing nowhere ; here , another unfinished street already in ruins ; there , a church ; here , an immense new warehouse ; there , a dilapidated old country villa ; then , a medley of black ditch , sparkling cucumber - frame , rank field , richly cultivated kitchen - garden , brick viaduct , arch - spanned canal , and disorder of frowziness and fog . As if the child had given the table a kick , and gone to sleep . But , even among school - buildings , school - teachers , and school - pupils , all according to pattern and all engendered in the light of the latest Gospel according to Monotony , the older pattern into which so many fortunes have been shaped for good and evil , comes out . It came out in Miss Peecher the schoolmistress , watering her flowers , as Mr Bradley Headstone walked forth . It came out in Miss Peecher the schoolmistress , watering the flowers in the little dusty bit of garden attached to her small official residence , with little windows like the eyes in needles , and little doors like the covers of school - books . Small , shining , neat , methodical , and buxom was Miss Peecher ; cherry - cheeked and tuneful of voice . A little pincushion , a little housewife , a little book , a little workbox , a little set of tables and weights and measures , and a little woman , all in one . She could write a little essay on any subject , exactly a slate long , beginning at the left - hand top of one side and ending at the right - hand bottom of the other , and the essay should be strictly according to rule . If Mr Bradley Headstone had addressed a written proposal of marriage to her , she would probably have replied in a complete little essay on the theme exactly a slate long , but would certainly have replied Yes . For she loved him . The decent hair - guard that went round his neck and took care of his decent silver watch was an object of envy to her . So would Miss Peecher have gone round his neck and taken care of him . Of him , insensible . Because he did not love Miss Peecher . Miss Peecher ’s favourite pupil , who assisted her in her little household , was in attendance with a can of water to replenish her little watering - pot , and sufficiently divined the state of Miss Peecher ’s affections to feel it necessary that she herself should love young Charley Hexam . So , there was a double palpitation among the double stocks and double wall - flowers , when the master and the boy looked over the little gate . ‘
108156	108161	108153	108154	Miss Peecher	519	’ said the Master . ‘
108170	108175	108167	108168	Mr Headstone	517	’ said Miss Peecher . ‘

108222	108283	108213	108213	Ours	3148	’ said the Master . Miss Peecher inverting her watering - pot , and very carefully shaking out the few last drops over a flower , as if there were some special virtue in them which would make it a Jack ’s beanstalk before morning , called for replenishment to her pupil , who had been speaking to the boy . ‘
108291	108296	108288	108289	Miss Peecher	519	’ said the Master . ‘
108304	108373	108301	108302	Mr Headstone	517	’ said the Mistress . The pupil had been , in her state of pupilage , so imbued with the class - custom of stretching out an arm , as if to hail a cab or omnibus , whenever she found she had an observation on hand to offer to Miss Peecher , that she often did it in their domestic relations ; and she did it now . ‘
108379	108384	108376	108377	Mary Anne	520	’ said Miss Peecher . ‘

108512	108530	108506	108507	Mary Anne	520	’ returned Miss Peecher , slightly colouring and shaking her head , a little out of humour ; ‘
108568	108590	108566	108566	They	3150	’ Mary Anne hooked her right arm behind her in her left hand , as being under examination , and replied : ‘

108732	108758	108730	108730	me	0	’ Mary Anne immediately hooked her right arm behind her in her left hand — an attitude absolutely necessary to the situation — and replied : ‘
108793	108794	108799	108800	Mary Anne	520	’ ‘
108802	108803	108799	108800	Mary Anne	520	’ ‘

108825	108833	108816	108817	Miss Peecher	519	’ remarked Miss Peecher , with encouragement . ‘
108855	109174	108852	108853	Mary Anne	520	’ This said , Miss Peecher finished the watering of her flowers , and went into her little official residence , and took a refresher of the principal rivers and mountains of the world , their breadths , depths , and heights , before settling the measurements of the body of a dress for her own personal occupation . Bradley Headstone and Charley Hexam duly got to the Surrey side of Westminster Bridge , and crossed the bridge , and made along the Middlesex shore towards Millbank . In this region are a certain little street called Church Street , and a certain little blind square , called Smith Square , in the centre of which last retreat is a very hideous church with four towers at the four corners , generally resembling some petrified monster , frightful and gigantic , on its back with its legs in the air . They found a tree near by in a corner , and a blacksmith ’s forge , and a timber yard , and a dealer ’s in old iron . What a rusty portion of a boiler and a great iron wheel or so meant by lying half - buried in the dealer ’s fore - court , nobody seemed to know or to want to know . Like the Miller of questionable jollity in the song , They cared for Nobody , no not they , and Nobody cared for them . After making the round of this place , and noting that there was a deadly kind of repose on it , more as though it had taken laudanum than fallen into a natural rest , they stopped at the point where the street and the square joined , and where there were some little quiet houses in a row . To these Charley Hexam finally led the way , and at one of these stopped . ‘

109220	109230	109206	109206	you	8755	’ returned the boy , with his former reluctance ; ‘

109309	109376	109377	109377	I	0	’ The boy knocked at a door , and the door promptly opened with a spring and a click . A parlour door within a small entry stood open , and disclosed a child — a dwarf — a girl — a something — sitting on a little low old - fashioned arm - chair , which had a kind of little working bench before it . ‘
109383	109388	109377	109377	I	0	’ said the child , ‘

109425	109433	109435	109436	the child	9306	‘ Nobody ’s at home at present , ’
109446	109462	109435	109436	the child	9306	‘ except the person of the house . What did you want , young man ? ’
109463	109471	109402	109402	I	0	‘ I wanted to see my sister . ’
109472	109479	109481	109482	the child	9306	‘ Many young men have sisters , ’

109562	109607	109556	109560	the person of the house	10654	‘ I thought it might be . Your sister will be in , in about a quarter of an hour . I am very fond of your sister . She ’s my particular friend . Take a seat . And this gentleman ’s name ? ’
109608	109615	109662	109664	the little figure	3173	‘ Mr Headstone , my schoolmaster . ’
109616	109655	109656	109656	They	3172	‘ Take a seat . And would you please to shut the street door first ? I ca n’t very well do it myself ; because my back ’s so bad , and my legs are so queer . ’
109798	109815	109816	109816	she	9306	‘ You ca n’t tell me the name of my trade , I ’ll be bound , ’
109826	109831	109833	109833	Charley	291	‘ You make pincushions , ’

110397	110398	110302	110302	she	10654	’ ‘
110405	110410	110302	110302	she	10654	’ asked Bradley Headstone . ‘

110426	110447	110413	110417	any of the neighbouring children	3192	’ cried the person of the house , with a little scream , as if the word had pricked her . ‘
110468	110525	110460	110460	I	0	’ She said this with an angry little shake of her tight fist close before her eyes . Perhaps it scarcely required the teacher - habit , to perceive that the doll ’s dressmaker was inclined to be bitter on the difference between herself and other children . But both master and pupil understood it so . ‘

110802	110851	110852	110852	I	0	’ It was difficult to guess the age of this strange creature , for her poor figure furnished no clue to it , and her face was at once so young and so old . Twelve , or at the most thirteen , might be near the mark . ‘

110920	110958	110906	110906	I	0	’ She listened to a step outside that caught her ear , and there was a soft knock at the door . Pulling at a handle within her reach , she said , with a pleased laugh : ‘
110976	110988	110989	110989	Charley	291	’ and Lizzie Hexam in a black dress entered the room . ‘
110993	111018	110989	110989	Charley	291	’ Taking him to her arms in the old way — of which he seemed a little ashamed — she saw no one else . ‘
111042	111102	111036	111037	Mr Headstone	517	’ Her eyes met those of the schoolmaster , who had evidently expected to see a very different sort of person , and a murmured word or two of salutation passed between them . She was a little flurried by the unexpected visit , and the schoolmaster was not at his ease . But he never was , quite . ‘
111138	111145	111154	111154	she	3210	’ Bradley seemed to think so . ‘
111156	111175	111179	111179	she	3210	’ cried the person of the house , resuming her occupation , though the twilight was falling fast . ‘

111245	111287	111242	111243	his sister	1021	‘ I supposed that if you wanted to see me you would have sent to me , appointing me to come somewhere near the school , as I did last time . I saw my brother near the school , sir , ’
111292	111319	111242	111243	his sister	1021	‘ because it ’s easier for me to go there , than for him to come here . I work about midway between the two places . ’

111341	111344	111332	111332	Bradley	517	‘ No . ’
111354	111363	111351	111351	her	3212	‘ Charley always does well , Mr Headstone ? ’
111364	111381	111242	111243	his sister	1021	‘ He could not do better . I regard his course as quite plain before him . ’
111382	111429	111351	111351	her	3212	‘ I hoped so . I am so thankful . So well done of you , Charley dear ! It is better for me not to come ( except when he wants me ) between him and his prospects . You think so , Mr Headstone ? ’
111470	111526	111466	111467	Bradley Headstone	517	‘ Your brother is very much occupied , you know . He has to work hard . One can not but say that the less his attention is diverted from his work , the better for his future . When he shall have established himself , why then — it will be another thing then . ’
111541	111557	111529	111529	her	246	‘ I always advised him as you advise him . Did I not , Charley ? ’
111558	111566	111568	111569	the boy	1061	‘ Well , never mind that now , ’

111591	111599	111529	111529	her	246	‘ You have your own room here ? ’
111600	111617	111568	111569	the boy	1061	‘ Oh yes . Upstairs . And it ’s quiet , and pleasant , and airy . ’
111618	111631	111643	111643	her	10654	‘ And she always has the use of this room for visitors , ’
111670	111684	111643	111643	her	10654	‘ Always this room for visitors ; have n’t you , Lizzie dear ? ’
111751	111761	111724	111724	she	9215	‘ Aha ! Caught you spying , did I ? ’
111850	111859	111861	111861	Bradley	517	‘ I ’ll saunter on by the river , ’
111863	111872	111861	111861	Bradley	517	‘ You will be glad to talk together . ’

111924	111935	111886	111887	the boy	1061	‘ I am very well where I am , Charley . ’
111936	111968	111886	111887	the boy	1061	‘ Very well where you are ! I am ashamed to have brought Mr Headstone with me . How came you to get into such company as that little witch ’s ? ’
111969	112008	111886	111887	the boy	1061	‘ By chance at first , as it seemed , Charley . But I think it must have been by something more than chance , for that child — You remember the bills upon the walls at home ? ’
112009	112043	112045	112046	the boy	1061	‘ Confound the bills upon the walls at home ! I want to forget the bills upon the walls at home , and it would be better for you to do the same , ’
112048	112055	112045	112046	the boy	1061	‘ Well ; what of them ? ’
112056	112067	111886	111887	the boy	1061	‘ This child is the grandchild of the old man . ’
112068	112073	111886	111887	the boy	1061	‘ What old man ? ’
112074	112091	112092	112093	The boy	1061	‘ The terrible drunken old man , in the list slippers and the night - cap . ’

The father is like his own father , a weak wretched trembling creature , falling to pieces , never sober . But a good workman too , at the work he does . The mother is dead . This poor ailing little creature has come to be what she is , surrounded by drunken people from her cradle — if she ever had one , Charley . ’
112227	112244	112246	112247	the boy	1061	‘ I do n’t see what you have to do with her , for all that , ’

What we have got to do , is , to turn our faces full in our new direction , and keep straight on . ’
112437	112452	112278	112279	His sister	1021	‘ And never look back ? Not even to try to make some amends ? ’

112470	112505	112462	112463	the boy	1061	‘ It was all very well when we sat before the fire — when we looked into the hollow down by the flare — but we are looking into the real world , now . ’
112506	112520	112278	112279	His sister	1021	‘ Ah , we were looking into the real world then , Charley ! ’
112521	112631	112632	112632	She	3237	‘ I understand what you mean by that , but you are not justified in it . I do n’t want , as I raise myself to shake you off , Liz . I want to carry you up with me . That ’s what I want to do , and mean to do . I know what I owe you . I said to Mr Headstone this very evening , “ After all , my sister got me here . ” Well , then . Do n’t pull me back , and hold me down . That ’s all I ask , and surely that ’s not unconscionable . ’

112670	112709	112632	112632	She	3237	‘ Nor could you be too far from it to please me . Let us get quit of it equally . Why should you linger about it any more than I ? I give it a wide berth . ’

You lodge yourself of your own accord in a house with a drunken — tailor , I suppose — or something of the sort , and a little crooked antic of a child , or old person , or whatever it is , and then you talk as if you were drawn or driven there . Now , do be more practical . ’

All I say is , that I hope you ’ll control your fancies a little , on my account . I ’ll get a school , and then you must come and live with me , and you ’ll have to control your fancies then , so why not now ? Now , say I have n’t vexed you . ’

113409	113432	113434	113434	he	517	‘ I beg your pardon , Mr Headstone , but I could n’t help wondering what in the world brought HIM here ! ’
113482	113494	113460	113460	he	517	‘ You do n’t appear to like your friend , Hexam ? ’
113495	113501	113503	113504	the boy	1061	‘ I DON’T like him , ’
113506	113510	113503	113504	the boy	1061	‘ Why not ? ’
113511	113534	113536	113537	the boy	1061	‘ He took hold of me by the chin in a precious impertinent way , the first time I ever saw him , ’
113539	113544	113536	113537	the boy	1061	‘ Again , why ? ’
113545	113573	113503	113504	the boy	1061	‘ For nothing . Or — it ’s much the same — because something I happened to say about my sister did n’t happen to please him . ’
113574	113581	113536	113537	the boy	1061	‘ Then he knows your sister ? ’
113582	113590	113592	113593	the boy	1061	‘ He did n’t at that time , ’
113599	113603	113592	113593	the boy	1061	‘ Does now ? ’
113642	113647	113637	113637	he	1061	‘ Yes , sir . ’
113648	113658	113614	113616	Mr Bradley Headstone	517	‘ Going to see her , I dare say . ’

113672	113690	113667	113668	the boy	1061	‘ He does n’t know her well enough . I should like to catch him at it ! ’
113724	113744	113705	113706	the master	10550	‘ You were going to tell me something about that person . What did you say his name was ? ’
113745	113808	113705	113706	the master	10550	‘ Wrayburn . Mr Eugene Wrayburn . He is what they call a barrister , with nothing to do . The first time he came to our old place was when my father was alive . He came on business ; not that it was HIS business — HE never had any business — he was brought by a friend of his . ’
113809	113815	113705	113706	the master	10550	‘ And the other times ? ’
113816	113937	113705	113706	the master	10550	‘ There was only one other time that I know of . When my father was killed by accident , he chanced to be one of the finders . He was mooning about , I suppose , taking liberties with people ’s chins ; but there he was , somehow . He brought the news home to my sister early in the morning , and brought Miss Abbey Potterson , a neighbour , to help break it to her . He was mooning about the house when I was fetched home in the afternoon — they did n’t know where to find me till my sister could be brought round sufficiently to tell them — and then he mooned away . ’
113938	113944	113705	113706	the master	10550	‘ And is that all ? ’
113945	113952	113953	113954	Bradley Headstone	517	‘ That ’s all , sir . ’
113990	113997	113985	113985	Bradley	517	‘ I suppose — your sister — ’
114009	114018	113985	113985	Bradley	517	‘ has received hardly any teaching , Hexam ? ’
114019	114025	113705	113706	the master	10550	‘ Hardly any , sir . ’
114026	114059	113985	113985	Bradley	517	‘ Sacrificed , no doubt , to her father ’s objections . I remember them in your case . Yet — your sister — scarcely looks or speaks like an ignorant person . ’
114060	114115	113705	113706	the master	10550	‘ Lizzie has as much thought as the best , Mr Headstone . Too much , perhaps , without teaching . I used to call the fire at home , her books , for she was always full of fancies — sometimes quite wise fancies , considering — when she sat looking at it . ’
114116	114123	114125	114126	Bradley Headstone	517	‘ I do n’t like that , ’

114270	114271	114260	114268	a sister who has been very good to me	3275	’ ‘
114274	114301	114260	114268	a sister who has been very good to me	3275	’ said Bradley Headstone in a slurring way , for his mind scarcely seemed to touch that point , so smoothly did it glide to another , ‘

114607	114718	114600	114600	I	0	’ Their walk was almost a silent one afterwards , until it ended at the school - house . There , one of neat Miss Peecher ’s little windows , like the eyes in needles , was illuminated , and in a corner near it sat Mary Anne watching , while Miss Peecher at the table stitched at the neat little body she was making up by brown paper pattern for her own wearing . N.B. Miss Peecher and Miss Peecher ’s pupils were not much encouraged in the unscholastic art of needlework , by Government . Mary Anne with her face to the window , held her arm up . ‘
114724	114725	114721	114722	Mary Anne	520	’ ‘
114733	114744	114726	114727	Mr Headstone	517	’ In about a minute , Mary Anne again hailed . ‘

114761	114874	114747	114748	Mary Anne	520	’ Miss Peecher repressed a sigh as she gathered her work together for bed , and transfixed that part of her dress where her heart would have been if she had had the dress on , with a sharp , sharp needle . Chapter 2 STILL EDUCATIONAL The person of the house , doll ’s dressmaker and manufacturer of ornamental pincushions and pen - wipers , sat in her quaint little low arm - chair , singing in the dark , until Lizzie came back . The person of the house had attained that dignity while yet of very tender years indeed , through being the only trustworthy person IN the house . ‘
114882	114892	114876	114876	Lizzie	246	’ said she , breaking off in her song , ‘

114910	114936	114942	114944	the blind man	3290	’ returned Lizzie , playfully smoothing the bright long fair hair which grew very luxuriant and beautiful on the head of the doll ’s dressmaker . ‘

115008	115138	115004	115004	he	1888	’ Lizzie finished putting the hair carefully back over the misshapen shoulders , and then lighted a candle . It showed the little parlour to be dingy , but orderly and clean . She stood it on the mantelshelf , remote from the dressmaker ’s eyes , and then put the room door open , and the house door open , and turned the little low chair and its occupant towards the outer air . It was a sultry night , and this was a fine - weather arrangement when the day ’s work was done . To complete it , she seated herself in a chair by the side of the little chair , and protectingly drew under her arm the spare hand that crept up to her . ‘
115156	115188	115144	115145	Jenny Wren	523	’ said the person of the house . Her real name was Fanny Cleaver ; but she had long ago chosen to bestow upon herself the appellation of Miss Jenny Wren . ‘

115630	115636	115627	115628	Miss Wren	523	‘ So I am told , ’

115670	115751	115665	115665	I	0	’ He gave his hand to Jenny Wren , and he gave his hand to Lizzie , and he stood leaning by the door at Lizzie ’s side . He had been strolling with his cigar , he said , ( it was smoked out and gone by this time , ) and he had strolled round to return in that direction that he might look in as he passed . Had she not seen her brother to - night ? ‘
115754	115795	115796	115797	The schoolmaster	10545	’ said Lizzie , whose manner was a little troubled . Gracious condescension on our brother ’s part ! Mr Eugene Wrayburn thought he had passed my young gentleman on the bridge yonder . Who was his friend with him ? ‘
115799	115800	115796	115797	The schoolmaster	10545	’ ‘
115809	115893	115796	115797	The schoolmaster	10545	’ Lizzie sat so still , that one could not have said wherein the fact of her manner being troubled was expressed ; and yet one could not have doubted it . Eugene was as easy as ever ; but perhaps , as she sat with her eyes cast down , it might have been rather more perceptible that his attention was concentrated upon her for certain moments , than its concentration upon any subject for any short time ever was , elsewhere . ‘
115902	115906	115900	115900	Lizzie	246	’ said Eugene . ‘

116125	116129	116134	116135	Mr Wrayburn	269	’ said Eugene . ‘

116549	116730	116531	116531	he	908	’ It chanced to be a subtle string to sound , in her who had so spoken to her brother within the hour . It sounded far more forcibly , because of the change in the speaker for the moment ; the passing appearance of earnestness , complete conviction , injured resentment of suspicion , generous and unselfish interest . All these qualities , in him usually so light and careless , she felt to be inseparable from some touch of their opposites in her own breast . She thought , had she , so far below him and so different , rejected this disinterestedness , because of some vain misgiving that he sought her out , or heeded any personal attractions that he might descry in her ? The poor girl , pure of heart and purpose , could not bear to think it . Sinking before her own eyes , as she suspected herself of it , she drooped her head as though she had done him some wicked and grievous injury , and broke into silent tears . ‘
116736	116745	116746	116746	I	0	’ said Eugene , very , very kindly . ‘
116787	116802	116783	116783	I	0	’ Disappointed of doing her a service . How else COULD he be disappointed ? ‘
116810	116814	116783	116783	I	0	’ laughed Eugene ; ‘
116927	116963	116892	116893	Miss J.	525	’ If he meant to follow home what was in Lizzie ’s thoughts , it was skilfully done . If he followed it by mere fortuitous coincidence , it was done by an evil chance . ‘
116972	116976	116892	116893	Miss J.	525	’ said Eugene . ‘

117217	117230	117214	117215	Mr Wrayburn	269	’ said Lizzie ; the more repentant , the less he claimed . ‘

117278	117279	117275	117276	Mr Wrayburn	269	’ ‘

117384	117440	117441	117441	I	0	’ There was an appearance of openness , trustfulness , unsuspecting generosity , in his words and manner , that won the poor girl over ; and not only won her over , but again caused her to feel as though she had been influenced by the opposite qualities , with vanity at their head . ‘
117483	117520	117480	117480	Jenny	523	’ The little creature had been leaning back , attentive , with her elbows resting on the elbows of her chair , and her chin upon her hands . Without changing her attitude , she answered , ‘
117523	117541	117480	117480	Jenny	523	’ so suddenly that it rather seemed as if she had chopped the monosyllable than spoken it . ‘
117555	117556	117480	117480	Jenny	523	’ ‘
117561	117583	117584	117584	I	0	’ said Eugene , giving Lizzie his hand before lightly waving it , as if he waved the whole subject away . ‘
117600	117611	117612	117612	I	0	’ Then he fell to talking playfully with Jenny Wren . ‘
117623	117627	117620	117621	Miss Jenny	523	’ he said . ‘

117705	117710	117698	117698	I	0	’ Miss Wren retorted ; ‘

117806	117826	117773	117773	you	523	’ said Eugene ; shocked — to do him justice — at the thought of trifling with her infirmity . ‘

117862	117869	117871	117872	Miss Wren	523	‘ There ’s something in that , ’
117874	117887	117871	117872	Miss Wren	523	‘ you have a sort of an idea in your noddle sometimes . ’
117895	117903	117871	117872	Miss Wren	523	‘ Talking of ideas , my Lizzie , ’
117917	117946	117871	117872	Miss Wren	523	‘ I wonder how it happens that when I am work , work , working here , all alone in the summer - time , I smell flowers . ’
117947	117957	117958	117958	Eugene	269	‘ As a commonplace individual , I should say , ’
117982	117983	117977	117977	you	3347	’ ‘
117989	118018	117985	117985	I	0	’ said the little creature , resting one arm upon the elbow of her chair , resting her chin upon that hand , and looking vacantly before her ; ‘

118136	118165	118133	118134	Jenny dear	523	’ said her friend : with a glance towards Eugene as if she would have asked him whether they were given the child in compensation for her losses . ‘
118186	118200	118202	118202	they	3349	’ cried the little creature , holding out her hand and looking upward , ‘
118205	118233	118202	118202	they	3349	’ There was something in the face and action for the moment , quite inspired and beautiful . Then the chin dropped musingly upon the hand again . ‘
118262	118273	118296	118296	They	3351	’ in a tone as though it were ages ago , ‘
118579	118631	118635	118635	you	3358	’ By degrees , as she progressed in this remembrance , the hand was raised , the late ecstatic look returned , and she became quite beautiful . Having so paused for a moment , silent , with a listening smile upon her face , she looked round and recalled herself . ‘

118677	118689	118690	118690	you	0	’ observed Eugene , quite ready to profit by the hint , ‘

118749	118775	118737	118737	you	3358	’ said Eugene , not understanding , and looking for an explanation . But Lizzie , with her lips only , shaping the two words , ‘
118779	118892	118737	118737	you	3358	’ he delayed no longer . He took his leave immediately . At the corner of the street he stopped to light another cigar , and possibly to ask himself what he was doing otherwise . If so , the answer was indefinite and vague . Who knows what he is doing , who is careless what he does ! A man stumbled against him as he turned away , who mumbled some maudlin apology . Looking after this man , Eugene saw him go in at the door by which he himself had just come out . On the man ’s stumbling into the room , Lizzie rose to leave it . ‘
118901	118915	118898	118899	Miss Hexam	528	’ he said in a submissive manner , speaking thickly and with difficulty . ‘
118942	118961	118965	118965	Jenny	523	’ Lizzie murmured that she had something to do in her own room , and went away upstairs . ‘
118967	118974	118965	118965	Jenny	523	’ said the man , timidly . ‘
118993	119017	118965	118965	Jenny	523	’ To which the person of the house , stretching out her arm in an attitude of command , replied with irresponsive asperity : ‘
119035	119077	118965	118965	Jenny	523	’ The wretched spectacle made as if he would have offered some remonstrance ; but not venturing to resist the person of the house , thought better of it , and went and sat down on a particular chair of disgrace . ‘
119084	119097	119098	119098	You	528	’ cried the person of the house , pointing her little finger , ‘
119121	119236	119116	119116	you	528	’ The shaking figure , unnerved and disjointed from head to foot , put out its two hands a little way , as making overtures of peace and reconciliation . Abject tears stood in its eyes , and stained the blotched red of its cheeks . The swollen lead - coloured under lip trembled with a shameful whine . The whole indecorous threadbare ruin , from the broken shoes to the prematurely - grey scanty hair , grovelled . Not with any sense worthy to be called a sense , of this dire reversal of the places of parent and child , but in a pitiful expostulation to be let off from a scolding . ‘
119245	119250	119237	119237	I	0	’ cried Miss Wren . ‘
119259	119272	119275	119278	you disgraceful old chap	3374	’ ( which indeed it did not require discernment to discover ) . ‘
119280	119304	119275	119278	you disgraceful old chap	3374	’ The very breathing of the figure was contemptible , as it laboured and rattled in that operation , like a blundering clock . ‘
119316	119324	119307	119307	slave	3375	’ pursued the person of the house , ‘
119337	119344	119332	119332	you	528	’ There was something in that emphasized ‘
119347	119387	119332	119332	you	528	’ which absurdly frightened the figure . As often as the person of the house worked her way round to it — even as soon as he saw that it was coming — he collapsed in an extra degree . ‘
119400	119408	119388	119388	I	0	’ said the person of the house . ‘
119454	119455	119458	119459	my dear	919	’ ‘
119461	119466	119458	119459	my dear	919	’ stammered the father . ‘
119469	119495	119458	119459	my dear	919	’ said the person of the house , terrifying him by a grand muster of her spirits and forces before recurring to the emphatic word , ‘
119503	119504	119498	119498	you	0	’ ‘
119512	119522	119523	119523	I’LL	0	’ was the miserable creature ’s plea in extenuation . ‘
119531	119544	119523	119523	I’LL	0	’ retorted the person of the house , speaking with vehement sharpness , ‘
119603	119604	119595	119595	you	528	’ ‘
119618	119624	119614	119615	Trouble nobody	3383	’ cried the wretched figure . ‘
119629	119657	119614	119615	Trouble nobody	3383	’ said the person of the house , tapping the table near her in a business - like manner , and shaking her head and her chin ; ‘
119674	119685	119669	119669	your	528	’ The obedient figure began to rummage in its pockets . ‘
119699	119707	119614	119615	Trouble nobody	3383	’ said the person of the house . ‘
119721	119773	119614	119615	Trouble nobody	3383	’ Such a business as he made of collecting it from his dogs’-eared pockets ; of expecting it in this pocket , and not finding it ; of not expecting it in that pocket , and passing it over ; of finding no pocket where that other pocket ought to be ! ‘
119778	119799	119614	119615	Trouble nobody	3383	’ demanded the person of the house , when a confused heap of pence and shillings lay on the table . ‘
119804	119818	119614	119615	Trouble nobody	3383	’ was the rueful answer , with an accordant shake of the head . ‘
119842	119845	119847	119851	the person of the house	10654	’em so ! ’
119882	119891	119893	119894	Miss Wren	523	‘ Here ’s but seven and eightpence halfpenny ! ’
119903	119917	119893	119894	Miss Wren	523	‘ Oh , you prodigal old son ! Now you shall be starved . ’
119918	119926	119927	119927	he	0	‘ No , do n’t starve me , ’
119932	119943	119945	119946	Miss Wren	523	‘ If you were treated as you ought to be , ’
119948	119958	119945	119946	Miss Wren	523	‘ you ’d be fed upon the skewers of cats ’
119979	120001	119945	119946	Miss Wren	523	’ When he stumbled out of the corner to comply , he again put out both his hands , and pleaded : ‘
120008	120009	119945	119946	Miss Wren	523	’ ‘
120017	120026	119945	119946	Miss Wren	523	’ cried Miss Wren , snapping him up . ‘
120034	120047	120033	120033	I	0	’m not going to forgive you . Go to bed this moment ! ’
120051	120053	120058	120058	he	0	‘ What ’
120094	120104	120090	120090	Lizzie	246	‘ Shall we have our supper , Jenny dear ? ’
120105	120123	120129	120129	her	523	‘ Ah ! bless us and save us , we need have something to keep us going , ’
120177	120191	120198	120198	she	246	‘ Now for supper ! What are you thinking of , Jenny darling ? ’
120192	120197	120198	120198	she	246	‘ I was thinking , ’
120208	120224	120198	120198	she	246	‘ what I would do to Him , if he should turn out a drunkard . ’
120225	120233	120235	120235	Lizzie	246	‘ Oh , but he wo n’t , ’
120237	120247	120235	120235	Lizzie	246	‘ You ’ll take care of that , beforehand . ’
120248	120282	120198	120198	she	246	‘ I shall try to take care of it beforehand , but he might deceive me . Oh , my dear , all those fellows with their tricks and their manners do deceive ! ’
120291	120377	120198	120198	she	246	‘ And if so , I tell you what I think I ’d do . When he was asleep , I ’d make a spoon red hot , and I ’d have some boiling liquor bubbling in a saucepan , and I ’d take it out hissing , and I ’d open his mouth with the other hand — or perhaps he ’d sleep with his mouth ready open — and I ’d pour it down his throat , and blister it and choke him . ’
120378	120390	120392	120392	Lizzie	246	‘ I am sure you would do no such horrible thing , ’
120394	120412	120392	120392	Lizzie	246	‘ Should n’t I ? Well ; perhaps I should n’t . But I should like to ! ’
120413	120422	120198	120198	she	246	‘ I am equally sure you would not . ’
120423	120462	120392	120392	Lizzie	246	‘ Not even like to ? Well , you generally know best . Only you have n’t always lived among it as I have lived — and your back is n’t bad and your legs are not queer . ’
120644	120683	120631	120631	she	246	‘ a representative man’—which can not in these times be doubted — and that Her Majesty ’s faithful Commons are incomplete without him . So , Britannia mentions to a legal gentleman of her acquaintance that if Veneering will ‘
120686	120780	120631	120631	she	246	’ five thousand pounds , he may write a couple of initial letters after his name at the extremely cheap rate of two thousand five hundred per letter . It is clearly understood between Britannia and the legal gentleman that nobody is to take up the five thousand pounds , but that being put down they will disappear by magical conjuration and enchantment . The legal gentleman in Britannia ’s confidence going straight from that lady to Veneering , thus commissioned , Veneering declares himself highly flattered , but requires breathing time to ascertain ‘
120789	120811	120631	120631	she	246	’ Above all things , he says , it behoves him to be clear , at a crisis of this importance , ‘
120820	120873	120874	120874	We	3408	’ The legal gentleman , in the interests of his client can not allow much time for this purpose , as the lady rather thinks she knows somebody prepared to put down six thousand pounds ; but he says he will give Veneering four hours . Veneering then says to Mrs Veneering , ‘
120878	120942	120943	120943	We	3408	’ and throws himself into a Hansom cab . Mrs Veneering in the same moment relinquishes baby to Nurse ; presses her aquiline hands upon her brow , to arrange the throbbing intellect within ; orders out the carriage ; and repeats in a distracted and devoted manner , compounded of Ophelia and any self - immolating female of antiquity you may prefer , ‘
120947	121077	121080	121080	Twemlow	271	’ Veneering having instructed his driver to charge at the Public in the streets , like the Life - Guards at Waterloo , is driven furiously to Duke Street , Saint James ’s . There , he finds Twemlow in his lodgings , fresh from the hands of a secret artist who has been doing something to his hair with yolks of eggs . The process requiring that Twemlow shall , for two hours after the application , allow his hair to stick upright and dry gradually , he is in an appropriate state for the receipt of startling intelligence ; looking equally like the Monument on Fish Street Hill , and King Priam on a certain incendiary occasion not wholly unknown as a neat point from the classics . ‘
121082	121091	121080	121080	Twemlow	271	’ says Veneering , grasping both his hands , ‘
121101	121103	121080	121080	Twemlow	271	’ ( ‘
121116	121120	121122	121122	I	0	’ thinks Twemlow , ‘
121125	121127	121122	121122	I	0	’ ) ‘
121181	121190	121172	121172	you	919	’ In sudden low spirits , Twemlow replies , ‘
121198	121199	121200	121200	My	0	’ ‘
121204	121215	121172	121172	you	919	’ says Veneering , not previously aware of having any , ‘
121244	121245	121236	121237	Lord Snigsworth	256	’ ‘
121251	121255	121236	121237	Lord Snigsworth	256	’ says Twemlow ; ‘
121258	121284	121236	121237	Lord Snigsworth	256	’ And perplexedly scratching his head , forgetful of the yolks of eggs , is the more discomfited by being reminded how stickey he is . ‘
121294	121298	121236	121237	Lord Snigsworth	256	’ pursues Veneering , ‘
121344	121367	121337	121337	you	919	’ This , Twemlow is so kind as to promise , with every appearance of most heartily intending to keep his word . ‘
121428	121439	121440	121440	You	919	’ Says Twemlow , with his hand to his forehead , ‘
121448	121449	121450	121450	I	0	’ ‘
121457	121458	121450	121450	I	0	’ ‘
121468	121469	121470	121470	I	0	’ ‘
121477	121478	121475	121475	Twemlow	271	’ ‘
121486	121531	121541	121541	Veneering	260	’ urges Twemlow with great nicety , as if ; in the case of its having been off the whole , he would have done it directly—‘ON the whole , I must beg you to excuse me from addressing any communication to Lord Snigsworth . ’
121532	121539	121541	121541	Veneering	260	‘ Bless you , bless you ! ’
121700	121712	121714	121714	Twemlow	271	‘ One thing , however , I CAN do for you , ’
121716	121725	121714	121714	Twemlow	271	‘ and that is , work for you . ’
121731	121736	121738	121738	Twemlow	271	‘ I ’ll go , ’
121747	121760	121738	121738	Twemlow	271	‘ to the club;—let us see now ; what o’clock is it ? ’
121761	121767	121714	121714	Twemlow	271	‘ Twenty minutes to eleven . ’
121768	121773	121775	121775	Twemlow	271	‘ I ’ll be , ’
121777	121796	121775	121775	Twemlow	271	‘ at the club by ten minutes to twelve , and I ’ll never leave it all day . ’
121810	121870	121797	121797	Veneering	260	‘ Thank you , thank you . I knew I could rely upon you . I said to Anastatia before leaving home just now to come to you — of course the first friend I have seen on a subject so momentous to me , my dear Twemlow — I said to Anastatia , “ We must work . ” ’
121871	121880	121882	121882	Twemlow	271	‘ You were right , you were right , ’
121884	121892	121882	121882	Twemlow	271	‘ Tell me . Is SHE working ? ’
121893	121897	121899	121899	Veneering	421	‘ She is , ’
121901	121904	121899	121899	Veneering	421	‘ Good ! ’
121915	121938	121906	121906	Twemlow	271	‘ A woman ’s tact is invaluable . To have the dear sex with us , is to have everything with us . ’
121939	121948	121950	121950	Veneering	421	‘ But you have not imparted to me , ’
121952	121964	121950	121950	Veneering	421	‘ what you think of my entering the House of Commons ? ’
121965	121969	121971	121971	Twemlow	271	‘ I think , ’
121975	121985	121986	121986	Veneering	421	‘ that it is the best club in London . ’
122125	122131	122132	122132	Man	929	‘ Do you know Veneering ? ’
122135	122143	122144	122144	Twemlow	271	‘ No ; member of the club ? ’
122147	122157	122158	122158	Man	287	‘ Yes . Coming in for Pocket - Breaches . ’
122161	122173	122158	122158	Man	287	‘ Ah ! Hope he may find it worth the money ! ’
122320	122326	122328	122328	Podsnap	438	‘ will rally round him ? ’
122333	122348	122328	122328	Podsnap	438	‘ Now , first of all , Veneering , do you ask my advice ? ’
122361	122372	122374	122374	Podsnap	438	‘ Yes , yes , that ’s all very well , ’
122376	122413	122414	122414	Veneering	421	‘ but have you made up your mind to take this borough of Pocket - Breaches on its own terms , or do you ask my opinion whether you shall take it or leave it alone ? ’
122435	122447	122449	122449	Podsnap	438	‘ Now , I ’ll be plain with you , Veneering , ’
122455	122476	122452	122452	his	438	‘ You will infer that I do n’t care about Parliament , from the fact of my not being there ? ’
122520	122528	122530	122530	Podsnap	438	‘ It is not worth my while , ’
122536	122586	122530	122530	Podsnap	438	‘ and it is the reverse of important to my position . But it is not my wish to set myself up as law for another man , differently situated . You think it IS worth YOUR while , and IS important to YOUR position . Is that so ? ’
122604	122613	122615	122615	Podsnap	438	‘ Then you do n’t ask my advice , ’
122617	122644	122615	122615	Podsnap	438	‘ Good . Then I wo n’t give it you . But you do ask my help . Good . Then I ’ll work for you . ’
122701	122713	122715	122715	Podsnap	438	‘ I have nothing very particular to do to - day , ’
122717	122791	122715	122715	Podsnap	438	‘ and I ’ll mix with some influential people . I had engaged myself to dinner , but I ’ll send Mrs Podsnap and get off going myself ; and I ’ll dine with you at eight . It ’s important we should report progress and compare notes . Now , let me see . You ought to have a couple of active energetic fellows , of gentlemanly manners , to go about . ’
122803	122812	122814	122814	Podsnap	265	‘ Whom I have met at your house , ’
122816	122836	122814	122814	Podsnap	265	‘ Yes . They ’ll do very well . Let them each have a cab , and go about . ’
123041	123047	123029	123029	she	3447	‘ To Lady Tippins ’s . ’
123227	123231	123197	123198	Mrs Veneering	260	‘ We must work ’
123311	123315	123317	123318	Lady Tippins	268	‘ My love , ’
123320	123330	123317	123318	Lady Tippins	268	‘ compose yourself ; we ’ll bring him in . ’
123399	123556	123398	123398	I	0	’m pretending to be an electioneering agent . And for what place of all places ? Pocket - Breaches . And why ? Because the dearest friend I have in the world has bought it . And who is the dearest friend I have in the world ? A man of the name of Veneering . Not omitting his wife , who is the other dearest friend I have in the world ; and I positively declare I forgot their baby , who is the other . And we are carrying on this little farce to keep up appearances , and is n’t it refreshing ! Then , my precious child , the fun of it is that nobody knows who these Veneerings are , and that they know nobody , and that they have a house out of the Tales of the Genii , and give dinners out of the Arabian Nights . Curious to see ’em
123565	123571	123573	123573	They	3469	’em . Come and dine with ’em
123771	123775	123722	123724	the bewitching Tippins	3479	‘ going about , ’
123962	124054	124105	124105	We	3488	’ legs on the very spot , lest Boots and Brewer should have instant occasion to mount and away . Those fleet messengers require the Analytical to see that their hats are deposited where they can be laid hold of at an instant ’s notice ; and they dine ( remarkably well though ) with the air of firemen in charge of an engine , expecting intelligence of some tremendous conflagration . Mrs Veneering faintly remarks , as dinner opens , that many such days would be too much for her . ‘
124067	124071	124105	124105	We	3488	’ says Podsnap ; ‘
124079	124080	124073	124073	we	3488	’ ‘
124087	124098	124073	124073	we	3488	’ says Lady Tippins , sportively waving her green fan . ‘
124103	124104	124105	124105	We	3488	’ ‘
124111	124115	124116	124116	We	3488	’ says Twemlow . ‘
124122	124169	124116	124116	We	3488	’ say Boots and Brewer . Strictly speaking , it would be hard to show cause why they should not bring him in , Pocket - Breaches having closed its little bargain , and there being no opposition . However , it is agreed that they must ‘
124171	124360	124361	124361	I	0	’ to the last , and that if they did not work , something indefinite would happen . It is likewise agreed that they are all so exhausted with the work behind them , and need to be so fortified for the work before them , as to require peculiar strengthening from Veneering ’s cellar . Therefore , the Analytical has orders to produce the cream of the cream of his binns , and therefore it falls out that rallying becomes rather a trying word for the occasion ; Lady Tippins being observed gamely to inculcate the necessity of rearing round their dear Veneering ; Podsnap advocating roaring round him ; Boots and Brewer declaring their intention of reeling round him ; and Veneering thanking his devoted friends one and all , with great emotion , for rarullarulling round him . In these inspiring moments , Brewer strikes out an idea which is the great hit of the day . He consults his watch , and says ( like Guy Fawkes ) , he ’ll now go down to the House of Commons and see how things look . ‘
124373	124383	124361	124361	I	0	’ says Brewer , with a deeply mysterious countenance , ‘
124407	124408	124409	124409	You	0	’ ‘
124415	124475	124409	124409	You	0	’ says Podsnap . Veneering expresses his inability ever to acknowledge this last service . Tears stand in Mrs Veneering ’s affectionate eyes . Boots shows envy , loses ground , and is regarded as possessing a second - rate mind . They all crowd to the door , to see Brewer off . Brewer says to his driver , ‘
124484	124501	124409	124409	You	0	’ eyeing the animal with critical scrutiny . Driver says he ’s as fresh as butter . ‘
124507	124511	124409	124409	You	0	’ says Brewer ; ‘
124516	124537	124409	124409	You	0	’ Driver darts up , Brewer leaps in , they cheer him as he departs , and Mr Podsnap says , ‘
124562	124617	124557	124557	his	3495	’ When the time comes for Veneering to deliver a neat and appropriate stammer to the men of Pocket - Breaches , only Podsnap and Twemlow accompany him by railway to that sequestered spot . The legal gentleman is at the Pocket - Breaches Branch Station , with an open carriage with a printed bill ‘
124621	124713	124714	124714	He	3496	’ stuck upon it , as if it were a wall ; and they gloriously proceed , amidst the grins of the populace , to a feeble little town hall on crutches , with some onions and bootlaces under it , which the legal gentleman says are a Market ; and from the front window of that edifice Veneering speaks to the listening earth . In the moment of his taking his hat off , Podsnap , as per agreement made with Mrs Veneering , telegraphs to that wife and mother , ‘
124718	124759	124714	124714	He	3496	’ Veneering loses his way in the usual No Thoroughfares of speech , and Podsnap and Twemlow say Hear hear ! and sometimes , when he ca n’t by any means back himself out of some very unlucky No Thoroughfare , ‘
124775	124903	124767	124767	He	3496	’ with an air of facetious conviction , as if the ingenuity of the thing gave them a sensation of exquisite pleasure . But Veneering makes two remarkably good points ; so good , that they are supposed to have been suggested to him by the legal gentleman in Britannia ’s confidence , while briefly conferring on the stairs . Point the first is this . Veneering institutes an original comparison between the country , and a ship ; pointedly calling the ship , the Vessel of the State , and the Minister the Man at the Helm . Veneering ’s object is to let Pocket - Breaches know that his friend on his right ( Podsnap ) is a man of wealth . Consequently says he , ‘
125007	125071	125002	125002	he	10059	’ Point the second is this . The telling fact that Twemlow is related to Lord Snigsworth , must be let off . Veneering supposes a state of public affairs that probably never could by any possibility exist ( though this is not quite certain , in consequence of his picture being unintelligible to himself and everybody else ) , and thus proceeds . ‘
125386	125402	125403	125403	He	3521	’ Veneering finishes with this last success , and Mr Podsnap telegraphs to Mrs Veneering , ‘
125407	125442	125403	125403	He	3521	’ Then , dinner is had at the Hotel with the legal gentleman , and then there are in due succession , nomination , and declaration . Finally Mr Podsnap telegraphs to Mrs Veneering , ‘
125449	125490	125443	125443	We	3529	’ Another gorgeous dinner awaits them on their return to the Veneering halls , and Lady Tippins awaits them , and Boots and Brewer await them . There is a modest assertion on everybody ’s part that everybody single - handed ‘
125494	125597	125443	125443	We	3529	’ ; but in the main it is conceded by all , that that stroke of business on Brewer ’s part , in going down to the house that night to see how things looked , was the master - stroke . A touching little incident is related by Mrs Veneering , in the course of the evening . Mrs Veneering is habitually disposed to be tearful , and has an extra disposition that way after her late excitement . Previous to withdrawing from the dinner - table with Lady Tippins , she says , in a pathetic and physically weak manner : ‘
125639	125655	125631	125631	Baby	529	’ The Analytical chemist , who is gloomily looking on , has diabolical impulses to suggest ‘
125657	125668	125675	125675	Baby	529	’ and throw up his situation ; but represses them . ‘
125686	125702	125675	125675	Baby	529	’ Mrs Veneering stopping here , Mr Podsnap deems it incumbent on him to say : ‘
125707	125708	125703	125703	I	0	’ ‘
125717	125731	125713	125713	I	0	’ says Mrs Veneering , looking about her for her pocket - handkerchief , ‘
125748	125889	125733	125734	the Fairies	3534	’ So overcome by the sentiment is Mrs Veneering , that they all get up to make a clear stage for Veneering , who goes round the table to the rescue , and bears her out backward , with her feet impressively scraping the carpet : after remarking that her work has been too much for her strength . Whether the fairies made any mention of the five thousand pounds , and it disagreed with Baby , is not speculated upon . Poor little Twemlow , quite done up , is touched , and still continues touched after he is safely housed over the livery - stable yard in Duke Street , Saint James ’s . But there , upon his sofa , a tremendous consideration breaks in upon the mild gentleman , putting all softer considerations to the rout . ‘
125920	125948	125949	125949	I	0	’ After having paced the room in distress of mind , with his hand to his forehead , the innocent Twemlow returns to his sofa and moans : ‘
125980	126110	125962	125962	He	8828	’ Chapter 4 CUPID PROMPTED To use the cold language of the world , Mrs Alfred Lammle rapidly improved the acquaintance of Miss Podsnap . To use the warm language of Mrs Lammle , she and her sweet Georgiana soon became one : in heart , in mind , in sentiment , in soul . Whenever Georgiana could escape from the thraldom of Podsnappery ; could throw off the bedclothes of the custard - coloured phaeton , and get up ; could shrink out of the range of her mother ’s rocking , and ( so to speak ) rescue her poor little frosty toes from being rocked over ; she repaired to her friend , Mrs Alfred Lammle . Mrs Podsnap by no means objected . As a consciously ‘
126114	126376	125962	125962	He	8828	’ accustomed to overhear herself so denominated by elderly osteologists pursuing their studies in dinner society , Mrs Podsnap could dispense with her daughter . Mr Podsnap , for his part , on being informed where Georgiana was , swelled with patronage of the Lammles . That they , when unable to lay hold of him , should respectfully grasp at the hem of his mantle ; that they , when they could not bask in the glory of him the sun , should take up with the pale reflected light of the watery young moon his daughter ; appeared quite natural , becoming , and proper . It gave him a better opinion of the discretion of the Lammles than he had heretofore held , as showing that they appreciated the value of the connexion . So , Georgiana repairing to her friend , Mr Podsnap went out to dinner , and to dinner , and yet to dinner , arm in arm with Mrs Podsnap : settling his obstinate head in his cravat and shirt - collar , much as if he were performing on the Pandean pipes , in his own honour , the triumphal march , See the conquering Podsnap comes , Sound the trumpets , beat the drums ! It was a trait in Mr Podsnap ’s character ( and in one form or other it will be generally seen to pervade the depths and shallows of Podsnappery ) , that he could not endure a hint of disparagement of any friend or acquaintance of his . ‘
126381	126393	126379	126379	you	3541	’ he would seem to say , in such a case . ‘
126450	126613	126441	126441	I	0	’ Hence , if any one in his presence had presumed to doubt the responsibility of the Lammles , he would have been mightily huffed . Not that any one did , for Veneering , M.P. , was always the authority for their being very rich , and perhaps believed it . As indeed he might , if he chose , for anything he knew of the matter . Mr and Mrs Lammle ’s house in Sackville Street , Piccadilly , was but a temporary residence . It has done well enough , they informed their friends , for Mr Lammle when a bachelor , but it would not do now . So , they were always looking at palatial residences in the best situations , and always very nearly taking or buying one , but never quite concluding the bargain . Hereby they made for themselves a shining little reputation apart . People said , on seeing a vacant palatial residence , ‘
126621	126738	126441	126441	I	0	’ and wrote to the Lammles about it , and the Lammles always went to look at it , but unfortunately it never exactly answered . In short , they suffered so many disappointments , that they began to think it would be necessary to build a palatial residence . And hereby they made another shining reputation ; many persons of their acquaintance becoming by anticipation dissatisfied with their own houses , and envious of the non - existent Lammle structure . The handsome fittings and furnishings of the house in Sackville Street were piled thick and high over the skeleton up - stairs , and if it ever whispered from under its load of upholstery , ‘
126746	126796	126441	126441	I	0	’ it was to very few ears , and certainly never to Miss Podsnap ’s . What Miss Podsnap was particularly charmed with , next to the graces of her friend , was the happiness of her friend ’s married life . This was frequently their theme of conversation . ‘
126801	126806	126441	126441	I	0	’ said Miss Podsnap , ‘

127219	127226	127207	127207	Georgiana	441	’ Miss Podsnap blushingly besought her . ‘
127254	127294	127244	127244	he	3554	’ Sophronia ’s glance was as if a rather new light broke in upon her . It shaded off into a cool smile , as she said , with her eyes upon her lunch , and her eyebrows raised : ‘
127328	127329	127317	127317	Georgiana	441	’ ‘
127336	127340	127317	127317	Georgiana	441	’ said Georgiana . ‘

127372	127392	127370	127370	Georgiana	441	’ inquired Mrs Lammle , still smiling coolly with her eyes upon her lunch , and her eyebrows raised . ‘
127396	127403	127370	127370	Georgiana	441	’ returned poor little Miss Podsnap . ‘
127480	127532	127550	127550	they	3566	’ Ah ! here was Alfred . Having stolen in unobserved , he playfully leaned on the back of Sophronia ’s chair , and , as Miss Podsnap saw him , put one of Sophronia ’s wandering locks to his lips , and waved a kiss from it towards Miss Podsnap . ‘
127541	127547	127550	127550	they	3566	’ inquired the captivating Alfred . ‘
127553	127558	127550	127550	they	3566	’ returned his wife , ‘

127672	127689	127662	127662	Sophronia	625	’ and kissed her hand . In return for which she kissed his watch - chain . ‘
127708	127718	127720	127720	Georgiana	441	’ said Alfred , drawing a seat between them . ‘
127725	127736	127720	127720	Georgiana	441	’ replied his wife . Alfred touchingly appealed to Georgiana . ‘
127743	127748	127741	127741	nobody	8619	’ replied Miss Podsnap . ‘

Mrs Lammle flew to embrace her darling little Georgy , and when the first transports were over , presented Mr Fledgeby . Mr Lammle came on the scene last , for he was always late , and so were the frequenters always late ; all hands being bound to be made late , by private information about the Bourse , and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths . A handsome little dinner was served immediately , and Mr Lammle sat sparkling at his end of the table , with his servant behind his chair , and HIS ever - lingering doubts upon the subject of his wages behind himself . Mr Lammle ’s utmost powers of sparkling were in requisition to - day , for Fascination Fledgeby and Georgiana not only struck each other speechless , but struck each other into astonishing attitudes ; Georgiana , as she sat facing Fledgeby , making such efforts to conceal her elbows as were totally incompatible with the use of a knife and fork ; and Fledgeby , as he sat facing Georgiana , avoiding her countenance by every possible device , and betraying the discomposure of his mind in feeling for his whiskers with his spoon , his wine glass , and his bread . So , Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle had to prompt , and this is how they prompted . ‘
130037	130055	130035	130035	Georgiana	441	’ said Mr Lammle , low and smiling , and sparkling all over , like a harlequin ; ‘

130206	130221	130199	130199	Fledgeby	543	’ Miss Podsnap faintly ejaculated : when Mrs Lammle took the prompt - book . ‘
130262	130286	130251	130252	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ Fledgeby must have conducted it on his side with immense art , for no appearance of uttering one syllable had escaped him . ‘

130320	130339	130343	130343	him	543	’ asked Mrs Lammle . Trying to look as if he knew anything about it , Fascination replied , ‘

130352	130357	130347	130347	We	3638	’ said Mrs Lammle , ‘

130472	130605	130466	130466	I	0	’ Still , it would n’t do . They would not look at one another . No , not even when the sparkling host proposed that the quartette should take an appropriately sparkling glass of wine . Georgiana looked from her wine glass at Mr Lammle and at Mrs Lammle ; but might n’t , could n’t , should n’t , would n’t , look at Mr Fledgeby . Fascination looked from his wine glass at Mrs Lammle and at Mr Lammle ; but might n’t , could n’t , should n’t , would n’t , look at Georgiana . More prompting was necessary . Cupid must be brought up to the mark . The manager had put him down in the bill for the part , and he must play it . ‘
130611	130616	130606	130606	Sophronia	625	’ said Mr Lammle , ‘

130632	130637	130629	130629	I	0	’ said Mrs Lammle , ‘

130663	130673	130658	130658	Georgy	547	’ remarked Mrs Lammle aside to her dear girl , ‘
130691	130780	130688	130689	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ Fascination wished to know if the colour were not called rose - colour ? Yes , said Mr Lammle ; actually he knew everything ; it was really rose - colour . Fascination took rose - colour to mean the colour of roses . ( In this he was very warmly supported by Mr and Mrs Lammle . ) Fascination had heard the term Queen of Flowers applied to the Rose . Similarly , it might be said that the dress was the Queen of Dresses . ( ‘
130786	130832	130784	130784	Fledgeby	543	’ from Mr Lammle . ) Notwithstanding , Fascination ’s opinion was that we all had our eyes — or at least a large majority of us — and that — and — and his farther opinion was several ands , with nothing beyond them . ‘
130838	130843	130835	130836	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ said Mrs Lammle , ‘
130868	130869	130853	130854	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ ‘
130874	130879	130835	130836	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ cried Mr Lammle ; ‘
130888	130889	130835	130836	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ ‘
130893	130908	130835	130836	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ said Mrs Lammle , stealing her affectionate hand towards her dear girl ’s , ‘
130914	130915	130916	130916	She	547	’ ‘
130919	130928	130916	130916	She	547	’ replied Mr Lammle , interpreting for her , ‘
131004	131005	131006	131006	He	543	’ ‘
131009	131039	131006	131006	He	543	’ replied Mrs Lammle , interpreting for him , and patting the back of her dear girl ’s hand , as if it were Fledgeby who was patting it , ‘
131061	131077	131078	131078	he	543	’ expressing more feeling as if it were more feeling on the part of Fledgeby , ‘
131086	131145	131082	131082	he	543	’ Still , no not even now , would they look at one another . Seeming to gnash his sparkling teeth , studs , eyes , and buttons , all at once , Mr Lammle secretly bent a dark frown on the two , expressive of an intense desire to bring them together by knocking their heads together . ‘
131158	131173	131156	131156	Fledgeby	543	’ he asked , stopping very short , to prevent himself from running on into ‘
131177	131178	131156	131156	Fledgeby	543	’ ‘
131185	131189	131156	131156	Fledgeby	543	’ said Fledgeby . ‘
131201	131202	131192	131192	I	0	’ ‘
131211	131216	131205	131205	you	543	’ said Mrs Lammle . ‘
131221	131232	131205	131205	you	543	’ replied Georgiana , faintly , under the sympathetic coincidence . ‘
131237	131252	131253	131253	you	543	’ said Mrs Lammle , charmed by the discovery which flowed from the premises , ‘
131263	131299	131300	131300	I	0	’ Even the craven Fledgeby felt that the time was now come when he must strike a blow . He struck it by saying , partly to Mrs Lammle and partly to the circumambient air , ‘
131310	131335	131360	131360	Fate	550	’ As he stopped dead , Mr Lammle , making that gingerous bush of his whiskers to look out of , offered him the word ‘
131338	131339	131360	131360	Fate	550	’ ‘
131350	131354	131355	131355	I	0	’ said Fledgeby . ‘
131406	131426	131428	131428	you	0	’ To which Georgiana replied , hooking her two little fingers in one another , and addressing the tablecloth , ‘
131449	131569	131443	131443	I	0	’ Content perforce with this success for the time , Mr Lammle let Miss Podsnap out of the room , as if he were opening her cage door , and Mrs Lammle followed . Coffee being presently served up stairs , he kept a watch on Fledgeby until Miss Podsnap ’s cup was empty , and then directed him with his finger ( as if that young gentleman were a slow Retriever ) to go and fetch it . This feat he performed , not only without failure , but even with the original embellishment of informing Miss Podsnap that green tea was considered bad for the nerves . Though there Miss Podsnap unintentionally threw him out by faltering , ‘
131581	131598	131604	131605	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ Which he was not prepared to elucidate . The carriage announced , Mrs Lammle said ; ‘
131620	131737	131738	131738	Alfred	437	’ And he took her , and Mrs Lammle went next , and Mr Lammle went last , savagely following his little flock , like a drover . But he was all sparkle and glitter in the box at the Opera , and there he and his dear wife made a conversation between Fledgeby and Georgiana in the following ingenious and skilful manner . They sat in this order : Mrs Lammle , Fascination Fledgeby , Georgiana , Mr Lammle . Mrs Lammle made leading remarks to Fledgeby , only requiring monosyllabic replies . Mr Lammle did the like with Georgiana . At times Mrs Lammle would lean forward to address Mr Lammle to this purpose . ‘
131770	131778	131743	131744	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ To which Mr Lammle would reply , ‘
131810	131818	131794	131795	the lady	2213	’ To which Mrs Lammle would rejoin , ‘
131830	131839	131825	131826	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ this . To which Alfred would demur : ‘
131849	131939	131845	131845	Georgiana	441	’ that . Through this device the two young people conversed at great length and committed themselves to a variety of delicate sentiments , without having once opened their lips , save to say yes or no , and even that not to one another . Fledgeby took his leave of Miss Podsnap at the carriage door , and the Lammles dropped her at her own home , and on the way Mrs Lammle archly rallied her , in her fond and protecting manner , by saying at intervals , ‘
131947	131958	131959	131959	You	625	’ Which was not much ; but the tone added , ‘
131965	132048	131962	131963	your Fledgeby	3648	’ And thus the Lammles got home at last , and the lady sat down moody and weary , looking at her dark lord engaged in a deed of violence with a bottle of soda - water as though he were wringing the neck of some unlucky creature and pouring its blood down his throat . As he wiped his dripping whiskers in an ogreish way , he met her eyes , and pausing , said , with no very gentle voice : ‘
132051	132052	131962	131963	your Fledgeby	3648	’ ‘
132063	132064	132065	132065	I	0	’ ‘

132301	132859	132862	132862	you	3656	’ Chapter 5 MERCURY PROMPTING Fledgeby deserved Mr Alfred Lammle ’s eulogium . He was the meanest cur existing , with a single pair of legs . And instinct ( a word we all clearly understand ) going largely on four legs , and reason always on two , meanness on four legs never attains the perfection of meanness on two . The father of this young gentleman had been a money - lender , who had transacted professional business with the mother of this young gentleman , when he , the latter , was waiting in the vast dark ante - chambers of the present world to be born . The lady , a widow , being unable to pay the money - lender , married him ; and in due course , Fledgeby was summoned out of the vast dark ante - chambers to come and be presented to the Registrar - General . Rather a curious speculation how Fledgeby would otherwise have disposed of his leisure until Doomsday . Fledgeby ’s mother offended her family by marrying Fledgeby ’s father . It is one of the easiest achievements in life to offend your family when your family want to get rid of you . Fledgeby ’s mother ’s family had been very much offended with her for being poor , and broke with her for becoming comparatively rich . Fledgeby ’s mother ’s family was the Snigsworth family . She had even the high honour to be cousin to Lord Snigsworth — so many times removed that the noble Earl would have had no compunction in removing her one time more and dropping her clean outside the cousinly pale ; but cousin for all that . Among her pre - matrimonial transactions with Fledgeby ’s father , Fledgeby ’s mother had raised money of him at a great disadvantage on a certain reversionary interest . The reversion falling in soon after they were married , Fledgeby ’s father laid hold of the cash for his separate use and benefit . This led to subjective differences of opinion , not to say objective interchanges of boot - jacks , backgammon boards , and other such domestic missiles , between Fledgeby ’s father and Fledgeby ’s mother , and those led to Fledgeby ’s mother spending as much money as she could , and to Fledgeby ’s father doing all he could n’t to restrain her . Fledgeby ’s childhood had been , in consequence , a stormy one ; but the winds and the waves had gone down in the grave , and Fledgeby flourished alone . He lived in chambers in the Albany , did Fledgeby , and maintained a spruce appearance . But his youthful fire was all composed of sparks from the grindstone ; and as the sparks flew off , went out , and never warmed anything , be sure that Fledgeby had his tools at the grindstone , and turned it with a wary eye . Mr Alfred Lammle came round to the Albany to breakfast with Fledgeby . Present on the table , one scanty pot of tea , one scanty loaf , two scanty pats of butter , two scanty rashers of bacon , two pitiful eggs , and an abundance of handsome china bought a secondhand bargain . ‘
132867	132872	132862	132862	you	3656	’ asked Mr Lammle . ‘

133176	133195	133197	133197	Lammle	437	‘ If I had held my tongue , you would never have seen the subject of my question , ’

133250	133253	133254	133255	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Can ? ’
133261	133307	133254	133255	Mr Lammle	437	‘ I should think you could ! Why , when these fellows of our acquaintance drink and you drink with them , the more talkative they get , the more silent you get . The more they let out , the more you keep in . ’
133308	133316	133318	133318	Fledgeby	543	‘ I do n’t object , Lammle , ’
133325	133346	133318	133318	Fledgeby	543	‘ to being understood , though I object to being questioned . That certainly IS the way I do it . ’
133347	133373	133254	133255	Mr Lammle	437	‘ And when all the rest of us are discussing our ventures , none of us ever know what a single venture of yours is ! ’
133374	133386	133388	133388	Fledgeby	543	‘ And none of you ever will from me , Lammle , ’
133395	133405	133388	133388	Fledgeby	543	‘ that certainly IS the way I do it . ’
133406	133416	133418	133418	Lammle	437	‘ Why of course it is , I know ! ’
133447	133472	133433	133433	his	437	‘ If I had n’t known it of my Fledgeby , should I have proposed our little compact of advantage , to my Fledgeby ? ’
133473	133476	133481	133481	his	543	‘ Ah ! ’
133485	133529	133481	133481	his	543	‘ But I am not to be got at in that way . I am not vain . That sort of vanity do n’t pay , Lammle . No , no , no . Compliments only make me hold my tongue the more . ’
133606	133621	133597	133597	he	437	‘ What — the — Dev - il is this fellow about this morning ? ’
133622	133630	133632	133633	Fascination Fledgeby	543	‘ Now , look here , Lammle , ’
133656	133755	133641	133641	his	543	‘ look here , Lammle ; I am very well aware that I did n’t show to advantage last night , and that you and your wife — who , I consider , is a very clever woman and an agreeable woman — did . I am not calculated to show to advantage under that sort of circumstances . I know very well you two did show to advantage , and managed capitally . But do n’t you on that account come talking to me as if I was your doll and puppet , because I am not . ‘
133760	133791	133641	133641	his	543	’ cried Alfred , after studying with a look the meanness that was fain to have the meanest help , and yet was so mean as to turn upon it : ‘
133801	133802	133803	133803	You	3668	’ ‘
133841	133842	133823	133823	your	3668	’ ‘
133860	133864	133846	133846	you	3668	’ retorted Lammle , ‘
133868	133869	133870	133870	I	0	’ ‘
133909	133910	133911	133911	I	0	’ ‘
133914	133922	133911	133911	I	0	’ exclaimed Lammle , shrugging his shoulders . ‘
133925	134016	134018	134018	Fledgeby	543	’ pursued the other—‘or take it in your head that people are your puppets because they do n’t come out to advantage at the particular moments when you do , with the assistance of a very clever and agreeable wife . All the rest keep on doing , and let Mrs Lammle keep on doing . Now , I have held my tongue when I thought proper , and I have spoken when I thought proper , and there ’s an end of that . And now the question is , ’
134025	134032	134018	134018	Fledgeby	543	‘ will you have another egg ? ’
134033	134040	134042	134042	Lammle	423	‘ No , I wo n’t , ’
134046	134049	134042	134042	Lammle	423	‘ Perhaps you ’re
134059	134068	134018	134018	Fledgeby	543	’ replied Fascination , in greatly improved spirits . ‘
134101	134102	134018	134018	Fledgeby	543	’ ‘
134109	134113	134105	134105	I	0	’ repeated Lammle . ‘
134118	134533	134115	134115	I	0	’ said Fascination . And it was not a mere retort for the sound ’s sake , but was a cheerful cogent consequence of the refusal ; for if Lammle had applied himself again to the loaf , it would have been so heavily visited , in Fledgeby ’s opinion , as to demand abstinence from bread , on his part , for the remainder of that meal at least , if not for the whole of the next . Whether this young gentleman ( for he was but three - and - twenty ) combined with the miserly vice of an old man , any of the open - handed vices of a young one , was a moot point ; so very honourably did he keep his own counsel . He was sensible of the value of appearances as an investment , and liked to dress well ; but he drove a bargain for every moveable about him , from the coat on his back to the china on his breakfast - table ; and every bargain by representing somebody ’s ruin or somebody ’s loss , acquired a peculiar charm for him . It was a part of his avarice to take , within narrow bounds , long odds at races ; if he won , he drove harder bargains ; if he lost , he half starved himself until next time . Why money should be so precious to an Ass too dull and mean to exchange it for any other satisfaction , is strange ; but there is no animal so sure to get laden with it , as the Ass who sees nothing written on the face of the earth and sky but the three letters L. S. D.—not Luxury , Sensuality , Dissoluteness , which they often stand for , but the three dry letters . Your concentrated Fox is seldom comparable to your concentrated Ass in money - breeding . Fascination Fledgeby feigned to be a young gentleman living on his means , but was known secretly to be a kind of outlaw in the bill - broking line , and to put money out at high interest in various ways . His circle of familiar acquaintance , from Mr Lammle round , all had a touch of the outlaw , as to their rovings in the merry greenwood of Jobbery Forest , lying on the outskirts of the Share - Market and the Stock Exchange . ‘
134540	134550	134536	134536	you	3673	’ said Fledgeby , eating his bread and butter , ‘
134559	134560	134536	134536	you	3673	’ ‘
134563	134574	134536	134536	you	3673	’ replied Lammle , glooming considerably under his late treatment . ‘
134582	134586	134536	134536	you	3673	’ said Fledgeby . ‘
134597	134618	134587	134588	The sex	3675	’ said Lammle sulkily , but with the air of a man who had not been able to help himself . ‘
134631	134652	134629	134629	you	3673	’ asked Fledgeby . The other smiled ( an ugly smile ) , and tapped one tap upon his nose . ‘

134808	134825	134798	134798	I	0	’ said Fledgeby , not at all pleased to be reminded of his having forgotten it , ‘

134869	134884	134864	134864	you	0	’ replied Fledgeby , sharpening , the moment his interest was touched by another . ‘
134932	135013	134919	134919	Georgiana	441	’ The respected Mr Lammle was a bully , by nature and by usual practice . Perceiving , as Fledgeby ’s affronts cumulated , that conciliation by no means answered the purpose here , he now directed a scowling look into Fledgeby ’s small eyes for the effect of the opposite treatment . Satisfied by what he saw there , he burst into a violent passion and struck his hand upon the table , making the china ring and dance . ‘
135023	135030	135014	135014	You	0	’ cried Mr Lammle , rising . ‘
135046	135047	135048	135048	I	0	’ ‘

135071	135076	135063	135063	You	0	’ repeated Mr Lammle . ‘

135092	135098	135086	135086	I	0	’ urged Fledgeby , quailing . ‘
135107	135117	135104	135105	vulgar vagabond	3687	’ said Mr Lammle , looking fiercely about him , ‘
135149	135150	135145	135145	I’d	0	’ ‘
135156	135160	135152	135152	you	0	’ pleaded Fledgeby . ‘

135181	135188	135178	135179	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ said Lammle advancing on him . ‘
135208	135222	135223	135223	I	0	’ Fledgeby covered it with his hand instead , and said , retreating , ‘

135238	135263	135264	135264	I	0	’ repeated Lammle . Still covering that feature and backing , Mr Fledgeby reiterated ( apparently with a severe cold in his head ) , ‘
135274	135275	135277	135278	this fellow	9949	’ ‘
135280	135378	135277	135278	this fellow	9949	’ exclaimed Lammle , stopping and making the most of his chest—‘This fellow presumes on my having selected him out of all the young fellows I know , for an advantageous opportunity ! This fellow presumes on my having in my desk round the corner , his dirty note of hand for a wretched sum payable on the occurrence of a certain event , which event can only be of my and my wife ’s bringing about ! This fellow , Fledgeby , presumes to be impertinent to me , Lammle . Give me your nose sir ! ’
135379	135389	135391	135391	Fledgeby	543	‘ No ! Stop ! I beg your pardon , ’
135396	135404	135406	135407	Mr Lammle	437	‘ What do you say , sir ? ’
135415	135421	135423	135423	Fledgeby	543	‘ I beg your pardon , ’
135425	135454	135423	135423	Fledgeby	543	‘ Repeat your words louder , sir . The just indignation of a gentleman has sent the blood boiling to my head . I do n’t hear you . ’
135455	135459	135461	135461	Fledgeby	543	‘ I say , ’
135468	135474	135461	135461	Fledgeby	543	‘ I beg your pardon . ’
135479	135486	135488	135488	he	437	‘ As a man of honour , ’
135496	135501	135488	135488	he	437	‘ I am disarmed . ’
135570	135573	135574	135574	he	548	‘ Lammle , ’
135583	135591	135574	135574	he	548	‘ I hope we are friends again ? ’
135592	135596	135640	135641	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Mr Fledgeby , ’
135600	135605	135574	135574	he	548	‘ say no more . ’
135606	135618	135620	135620	Fledgeby	548	‘ I must have gone too far in making myself disagreeable , ’
135622	135629	135620	135620	Fledgeby	548	‘ but I never intended it . ’
135630	135639	135640	135641	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Say no more , say no more ! ’
135648	135654	135640	135641	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Give me your’—Fledgeby started—‘hand . ’

136167	136173	136174	136174	He	548	‘ These are nice games ! ’
136258	136266	136268	136268	Fledgeby	548	‘ What have you been up to ? ’
136274	136279	136281	136283	the Jewish man	3716	‘ Generous Christian master , ’
136285	136296	136281	136283	the Jewish man	3716	‘ it being holiday , I looked for no one . ’
136297	136302	136304	136304	Fledgeby	548	‘ Holiday he blowed ! ’
136308	136322	136304	136304	Fledgeby	548	‘ What have YOU got to do with holidays ? Shut the door . ’
136529	136544	136546	136546	Fledgeby	548	‘ You have not told me what you were up to , you sir , ’
136558	136567	136546	136546	Fledgeby	548	‘ Sir , I was breathing the air . ’
136568	136579	136606	136608	the old man	1902	‘ In the cellar , that you did n’t hear ? ’
136580	136587	136546	136546	Fledgeby	548	‘ On the house - top . ’
136588	136601	136546	136546	Fledgeby	548	‘ Upon my soul ! That ’s a way of doing business . ’
136602	136605	136606	136608	the old man	1902	‘ Sir , ’
136617	136637	136606	136608	the old man	1902	‘ there must be two parties to the transaction of business , and the holiday has left me alone . ’
136638	136660	136546	136546	Fledgeby	548	‘ Ah ! Ca n’t be buyer and seller too . That ’s what the Jews say ; ai n’t it ? ’
136661	136673	136675	136677	the old man	1902	‘ At least we say truly , if we say so , ’
136682	136696	136698	136699	Fascination Fledgeby	543	‘ Your people need speak the truth sometimes , for they lie enough , ’

136716	136726	136709	136711	the old man	1902	‘ too much untruth among all denominations of men . ’
136749	136753	136754	136754	he	543	‘ For instance , ’
136767	136780	136754	136754	he	543	‘ who but you and I ever heard of a poor Jew ? ’
136781	136785	136787	136789	the old man	1902	‘ The Jews , ’

136818	136822	136824	136824	Fledgeby	543	‘ Bother that ! ’
136826	136874	136875	136877	The old man	1902	‘ You know what I mean . You ’d persuade me if you could , that you are a poor Jew . I wish you ’d confess how much you really did make out of my late governor . I should have a better opinion of you . ’
136891	136904	136906	136908	the ingenious Fledgeby	543	‘ Do n’t go on posturing like a Deaf and Dumb School , ’
136910	136925	136906	136908	the ingenious Fledgeby	543	‘ but express yourself like a Christian — or as nearly as you can . ’
136926	136939	136941	136943	the old man	1902	‘ I had had sickness and misfortunes , and was so poor , ’
136945	136975	136941	136943	the old man	1902	‘ as hopelessly to owe the father , principal and interest . The son inheriting , was so merciful as to forgive me both , and place me here . ’
137015	137025	137027	137027	Fledgeby	543	‘ You wo n’t say more , I see , ’
137050	137078	137034	137034	he	543	‘ and so it ’s of no use my putting it to you . But confess this , Riah ; who believes you to be poor now ? ’
137079	137083	137085	137087	the old man	1902	‘ No one , ’

137095	137099	137085	137087	the old man	1902	’ assented Fledgeby . ‘
137103	137117	137100	137101	No one	1150	’ repeated the old man with a grave slow wave of his head . ‘
137139	137162	137126	137126	I	0	’ with a lithe sweep of his easily - turning hand around him , to comprehend the various objects on the shelves ; ‘

137225	137229	137219	137219	I	0	’ interposed Fledgeby , ‘

137241	137320	137230	137230	I	0	‘ Sir , I tell them no more than I am about to repeat . When I tell them , “ I can not promise this , I can not answer for the other , I must see my principal , I have not the money , I am a poor man and it does not rest with me , ” they are so unbelieving and so impatient , that they sometimes curse me in Jehovah ’s name . ’
137321	137330	137332	137333	Fascination Fledgeby	543	‘ That ’s deuced good , that is ! ’
137335	137404	137332	137333	Fascination Fledgeby	543	‘ And at other times they say , “ Can it never be done without these tricks , Mr Riah ? Come , come , Mr Riah , we know the arts of your people”—my people!—“If the money is to be lent , fetch it , fetch it ; if it is not to be lent , keep it and say so . ” They never believe me . ’
137405	137407	137459	137459	Fledgeby	543	‘ THAT ’S

137487	137587	137482	137482	I	0	’ Not a syllable of this reflection shaped itself in any scrap of Mr Fledgeby ’s breath , lest it should tend to put his servant ’s price up . But looking at the old man as he stood quiet with his head bowed and his eyes cast down , he felt that to relinquish an inch of his baldness , an inch of his grey hair , an inch of his coat - skirt , an inch of his hat - brim , an inch of his walking - staff , would be to relinquish hundreds of pounds . ‘
137593	137605	137591	137591	Riah	563	’ said Fledgeby , mollified by these self - approving considerations . ‘

137977	137989	138005	138005	George	303	’ The old man took a step back , and hesitated . ‘

138102	138218	138220	138220	he	8755	’ Passing him with a courteous reverence , specially unlike any action that Mr Fledgeby could for his life have imparted to his own head and hands , the old man began to ascend the stairs . As he toiled on before , with his palm upon the stair - rail , and his long black skirt , a very gaberdine , overhanging each successive step , he might have been the leader in some pilgrimage of devotional ascent to a prophet ’s tomb . Not troubled by any such weak imagining , Fascination Fledgeby merely speculated on the time of life at which his beard had begun , and thought once more what a good ’

138564	138587	138560	138560	Jenny	523	‘ Very difficult to fit too , because their figures are so uncertain . You never know where to expect their waists . ’

138647	138658	138660	138660	Fledgeby	543	‘ Not much good to be got out of that , ’
138662	138668	138660	138660	Fledgeby	543	‘ Depends upon the person ! ’

138702	138768	138689	138690	the Jew	3774	‘ through their coming here to buy of our damage and waste for Miss Jenny ’s millinery . Our waste goes into the best of company , sir , on her rosy - cheeked little customers . They wear it in their hair , and on their ball - dresses , and even ( so she tells me ) are presented at Court with it . ’
138769	138772	138774	138774	Fledgeby	543	‘ Ah ! ’
138788	138802	138774	138774	Fledgeby	543	‘ she ’s been buying that basketful to - day , I suppose ? ’
138803	138809	138810	138811	Miss Jenny	523	‘ I suppose she has , ’
138814	138824	138810	138811	Miss Jenny	523	‘ and paying for it too , most likely ! ’

139122	139173	139120	139120	Jenny	523	‘ But it ’s so high . And you see the clouds rushing on above the narrow streets , not minding them , and you see the golden arrows pointing at the mountains in the sky from which the wind comes , and you feel as if you were dead . ’
139188	139198	139200	139200	Fledgeby	543	‘ How do you feel when you are dead ? ’

He toiled out at that low door so bent and worn , and then he took his breath and stood upright , and looked all round him at the sky , and the wind blew upon him , and his life down in the dark was over!—Till he was called back to life , ’
139402	139410	139388	139388	she	523	‘ Why did you call him back ? ’

140327	140336	140338	140338	Mortimer	566	‘ This very complete little kitchen of ours , ’

140479	140482	140484	140484	Eugene	269	‘ See ! ’
140486	140680	140484	140484	Eugene	269	‘ miniature flour - barrel , rolling - pin , spice - box , shelf of brown jars , chopping - board , coffee - mill , dresser elegantly furnished with crockery , saucepans and pans , roasting jack , a charming kettle , an armoury of dish - covers . The moral influence of these objects , in forming the domestic virtues , may have an immense influence upon me ; not upon you , for you are a hopeless case , but upon me . In fact , I have an idea that I feel the domestic virtues already forming . Do me the favour to step into my bedroom . Secretaire , you see , and abstruse set of solid mahogany pigeon - holes , one for every letter of the alphabet . To what use do I devote them ? I receive a bill — say from Jones . I docket it neatly at the secretaire , JONES , and I put it into pigeonhole J. It ’s the next thing to a receipt and is quite as satisfactory to ME . And I very much wish , Mortimer , ’
140696	140735	140484	140484	Eugene	269	‘ that my example might induce YOU to cultivate habits of punctuality and method ; and , by means of the moral influences with which I have surrounded you , to encourage the formation of the domestic virtues . ’

140889	140901	140887	140887	Eugene	269	‘ The moral influences are beginning to work . Say on . ’

140943	140963	140931	140931	Eugene	269	‘ I trace the happy influences of the little flour - barrel and the coffee - mill . Gratifying . ’
140964	140967	140969	140969	Mortimer	566	‘ Eugene , ’
140998	141006	141007	141007	Eugene	269	‘ you are withholding something from me . ’
141016	141177	141007	141007	Eugene	269	‘ All this past summer , you have been withholding something from me . Before we entered on our boating vacation , you were as bent upon it as I have seen you upon anything since we first rowed together . But you cared very little for it when it came , often found it a tie and a drag upon you , and were constantly away . Now it was well enough half - a - dozen times , a dozen times , twenty times , to say to me in your own odd manner , which I know so well and like so much , that your disappearances were precautions against our boring one another ; but of course after a short while I began to know that they covered something . I do n’t ask what it is , as you have not told me ; but the fact is so . Say , is it not ? ’
141178	141189	141191	141191	Eugene	269	‘ I give you my word of honour , Mortimer , ’
141202	141209	141191	141191	Eugene	269	‘ that I do n’t know . ’
141210	141217	141377	141377	he	269	‘ Do n’t know , Eugene ? ’
141218	141246	141007	141007	Eugene	269	‘ Upon my soul , do n’t know . I know less about myself than about most people in the world , and I do n’t know . ’
141247	141256	141191	141191	Eugene	269	‘ You have some design in your mind ? ’
141257	141268	141377	141377	he	269	‘ Have I ? I do n’t think I have . ’
141269	141288	141007	141007	Eugene	269	‘ At any rate , you have some subject of interest there which used not to be there ? ’
141289	141296	141298	141298	Eugene	269	‘ I really ca n’t say , ’
141311	141373	141377	141377	he	269	‘ At times I have thought yes ; at other times I have thought no . Now , I have been inclined to pursue such a subject ; now I have felt that it was absurd , and that it tired and embarrassed me . Absolutely , I ca n’t say . Frankly and faithfully , I would if I could . ’
141405	141545	141393	141393	he	269	‘ You must take your friend as he is . You know what I am , my dear Mortimer . You know how dreadfully susceptible I am to boredom . You know that when I became enough of a man to find myself an embodied conundrum , I bored myself to the last degree by trying to find out what I meant . You know that at length I gave it up , and declined to guess any more . Then how can I possibly give you the answer that I have not discovered ? The old nursery form runs , “ Riddle - me - riddle - me - ree , p’raps you ca n’t tell me what this may be ? ” My reply runs , “ No . Upon my life , I ca n’t . ” ’
141607	141613	141615	141615	Eugene	566	‘ Come , dear boy ! ’
141617	141641	141615	141615	Eugene	566	‘ Let us try the effect of smoking . If it enlightens me at all on this question , I will impart unreservedly . ’
141691	141695	141697	141697	Eugene	566	‘ No enlightenment , ’

141729	141765	141766	141766	Eugene	566	‘ nothing can come from it . So I shall hope that this may hold good throughout , and that there may be nothing on foot . Nothing injurious to you , Eugene , or — ’
141817	141820	141814	141814	he	566	‘ Or ? ’
141821	141829	141814	141814	he	566	‘ Or injurious to any one else . ’
141830	141833	141835	141835	Eugene	566	‘ How , ’
141855	141863	141835	141835	Eugene	566	‘ how injurious to any one else ? ’
141864	141870	141814	141814	he	566	‘ I do n’t know . ’

141966	142037	141963	141963	he	566	‘ stray into the court . They examine the door - posts of number one , seeking the name they want . Not finding it at number one , they come to number two . On the hat of wanderer number two , the shorter one , I drop this pellet . Hitting him on the hat , I smoke serenely , and become absorbed in contemplation of the sky . ’
142086	142091	142093	142093	Eugene	566	‘ When they emerge , ’

142269	142280	142281	142281	He	269	‘ Oh , yes , yes . I recollect him ! ’
142332	142341	142320	142320	Wrayburn	269	‘ He says he has something to say . ’

142384	142402	142381	142382	the boy	1061	‘ And I mean to say what I want to say , too , Mr Eugene Wrayburn ! ’
142435	142444	142428	142428	he	269	‘ And who may this other person be ? ’
142445	142453	142455	142455	Bradley	517	‘ I am Charles Hexam ’s friend , ’

142656	142665	142667	142667	Eugene	269	‘ In most respects , I dare say , ’
142673	142696	142667	142667	Eugene	269	‘ though whether high or low is of no importance . You have my name very correctly . Pray what is yours ? ’

142710	142713	142715	142715	Eugene	269	‘ True , ’
142727	142756	142715	142715	Eugene	269	‘ it does not concern me at all to know . I can say Schoolmaster , which is a most respectable title . You are right , Schoolmaster . ’

142814	142857	142811	142812	the boy	1061	‘ I want a word with you . I have wanted it so much , that we have looked out your address in the book , and we have been to your office , and we have come from your office here . ’

143046	143054	143056	143056	Eugene	269	‘ Was this worth while , Schoolmaster ? ’
143066	143083	143056	143056	Eugene	269	‘ So much trouble for nothing ? You should know best , but I think not . ’

143123	143207	143119	143119	I	0	’ He said it so tauntingly in his perfect placidity , that the respectable right - hand clutching the respectable hair - guard of the respectable watch could have wound it round his throat and strangled him with it . Not another word did Eugene deem it worth while to utter , but stood leaning his head upon his hand , smoking , and looking imperturbably at the chafing Bradley Headstone with his clutching right - hand , until Bradley was wellnigh mad . ‘
143211	143216	143208	143209	Mr Wrayburn	269	’ proceeded the boy , ‘
143542	143594	143596	143596	I	0	’ The boyish weakness of this speech , combined with its great selfishness , made it a poor one indeed . And yet Bradley Headstone , used to the little audience of a school , and unused to the larger ways of men , showed a kind of exultation in it . ‘
143602	143625	143596	143596	I	0	’ pursued the boy , forced into the use of the third person by the hopelessness of addressing him in the first , ‘

143892	143905	143907	143907	I	0	’ A pause ensued , in which the schoolmaster looked very awkward . ‘
143912	143930	143907	143907	I	0	’ said Eugene , removing his fast - waning cigar from his lips to glance at it , ‘

143946	143969	143943	143944	Mr Lightwood	566	’ added the boy , with a burning face , under the flaming aggravation of getting no sort of answer or attention , ‘

144133	144173	144131	144131	Hexam	291	’ he returned . The boy complying with an indignant look and as much noise as he could make , swung out of the room ; and Lightwood went to the window , and leaned there , looking out . ‘
144188	144212	144174	144174	You	3875	’ said Bradley to Eugene , speaking in a carefully weighed and measured tone , or he could not have spoken at all . ‘
144219	144223	144213	144213	I	0	’ replied Eugene , ‘

146477	146764	146472	146472	I	0	’ Chapter 7 IN WHICH A FRIENDLY MOVE IS ORIGINATED The arrangement between Mr Boffin and his literary man , Mr Silas Wegg , so far altered with the altered habits of Mr Boffin ’s life , as that the Roman Empire usually declined in the morning and in the eminently aristocratic family mansion , rather than in the evening , as of yore , and in Boffin ’s Bower . There were occasions , however , when Mr Boffin , seeking a brief refuge from the blandishments of fashion , would present himself at the Bower after dark , to anticipate the next sallying forth of Wegg , and would there , on the old settle , pursue the downward fortunes of those enervated and corrupted masters of the world who were by this time on their last legs . If Wegg had been worse paid for his office , or better qualified to discharge it , he would have considered these visits complimentary and agreeable ; but , holding the position of a handsomely - remunerated humbug , he resented them . This was quite according to rule , for the incompetent servant , by whomsoever employed , is always against his employer . Even those born governors , noble and right honourable creatures , who have been the most imbecile in high places , have uniformly shown themselves the most opposed ( sometimes in belying distrust , sometimes in vapid insolence ) to THEIR employer . What is in such wise true of the public master and servant , is equally true of the private master and servant all the world over . When Mr Silas Wegg did at last obtain free access to ‘
146767	146870	146765	146765	Our	3950	’ , as he had been wo nt to call the mansion outside which he had sat shelterless so long , and when he did at last find it in all particulars as different from his mental plans of it as according to the nature of things it well could be , that far - seeing and far - reaching character , by way of asserting himself and making out a case for compensation , affected to fall into a melancholy strain of musing over the mournful past ; as if the house and he had had a fall in life together . ‘
146876	146891	146874	146874	sir	8755	’ Silas would say to his patron , sadly nodding his head and musing , ‘
146953	147034	146946	146946	Ah	3957	’ So tender were his lamentations , that the kindly Mr Boffin was quite sorry for him , and almost felt mistrustful that in buying the house he had done him an irreparable injury . Two or three diplomatic interviews , the result of great subtlety on Mr Wegg ’s part , but assuming the mask of careless yielding to a fortuitous combination of circumstances impelling him towards Clerkenwell , had enabled him to complete his bargain with Mr Venus . ‘
147042	147052	146946	146946	Ah	3957	’ said Silas , when the bargain was closed , ‘
147080	147081	147082	147082	You	0	’ ‘

147571	147590	147592	147593	Mr Venus	379	‘ Then I ’d rather , Mr Wegg , you put it another time , penn’orth - etically , ’
147597	147611	147592	147593	Mr Venus	379	‘ for I tell you candidly I do n’t like your little cases . ’
147667	147670	147671	147671	Wegg	319	‘ Tolerable , ’
147674	147714	147671	147671	Wegg	319	‘ But bear in mind , Mr Venus , that there ’s no gold without its alloy . Mix for yourself and take a seat in the chimbley - corner . Will you perform upon a pipe , sir ? ’
147715	147725	147727	147728	the other	8572	‘ I am but an indifferent performer , sir , ’
147730	147744	147727	147728	the other	8572	‘ but I ’ll accompany you with a whiff or two at intervals . ’
147768	147787	147671	147671	Wegg	319	‘ And there ’s alloy even in this metal of yours , Mr Wegg , you was remarking ? ’
147788	147791	147793	147793	Wegg	319	‘ Mystery , ’
147795	147834	147793	147793	Wegg	319	‘ I do n’t like it , Mr Venus . I do n’t like to have the life knocked out of former inhabitants of this house , in the gloomy dark , and not know who did it . ’
147835	147845	147671	147671	Wegg	319	‘ Might you have any suspicions , Mr Wegg ? ’
147846	147849	147851	147852	that gentleman	1468	‘ No , ’
147854	147868	147851	147852	that gentleman	1468	‘ I know who profits by it . But I ’ve no suspicions . ’
147919	147922	147924	147924	Wegg	319	‘ Similarly , ’
147926	148041	147924	147924	Wegg	319	‘ I have observations as I can offer upon certain points and parties ; but I make no objections , Mr Venus . Here is an immense fortune drops from the clouds upon a person that shall be nameless . Here is a weekly allowance , with a certain weight of coals , drops from the clouds upon me . Which of us is the better man ? Not the person that shall be nameless . That ’s an observation of mine , but I do n’t make it an objection . I take my allowance and my certain weight of coals . He takes his fortune . That ’s the way it works . ’

Which of us two has , in the service of him that shall be nameless , tackled the Romans , both civil and military , till he has got as husky as if he ’d been weaned and ever since brought up on sawdust ? Not the talking - over stranger . Yet the house is as free to him as if it was his , and he has his room , and is put upon a footing , and draws about a thousand a year . I am banished to the Bower , to be found in it like a piece of furniture whenever wanted . Merit , therefore , do n’t win . That ’s the way it works . I observe it , because I ca n’t help observing it , being accustomed to take a powerful sight of notice ; but I do n’t object . Ever here before , Mr Venus ? ’

149478	149503	149463	149464	Mr Wegg	319	’ cries Wegg ; and the apostrophe is not the less impressive for the Being ’s hand being actually upon his rum and water ; ‘

149578	149617	149522	149526	the species of old gentleman	4000	’ says Mr Wegg , again holding out Mr Venus ’s palm as if he were going to tell his fortune by chiromancy , and holding his own up ready for smiting it when the time should come ; ‘
149710	149711	149701	149702	Mr Venus	379	’ ‘
149732	149737	149738	149738	he	1414	’ Mr Venus rejoins , ‘
149749	149771	149738	149738	he	1414	’ The palm of Silas Wegg descends with a sounding smack upon the palm of Venus , and Wegg lavishly exclaims , ‘
149784	149848	149849	149850	Mr Venus	379	’ Having now hitched his wooden leg and his chair close in front of Mr Venus , Mr Wegg rapidly mixes for both , gives his visitor his glass , touches its rim with the rim of his own , puts his own to his lips , puts it down , and spreading his hands on his visitor ’s knees thus addresses him : ‘
149925	149940	149944	149945	Mr Wegg	319	’ Mr Venus , passively winking his weak eyes both at once , demands : ‘
149947	149948	149944	149945	Mr Wegg	319	’ ‘
149967	149968	149965	149965	sir	8755	’ ‘

150058	150089	150117	150118	Mr Wegg	319	’ says Mr Venus , looking up , after meditating with his hair held in his hands , as if he could only fix his attention by fixing his head ; ‘
150120	150121	150117	150118	Mr Wegg	319	’ ‘
150155	150164	150208	150209	Mr Venus	379	’ Mr Venus rubs an eyebrow , interrogatively . ‘

150225	150230	150208	150209	Mr Venus	379	’ Mr Venus propounds . ‘

150255	150266	150251	150251	Wegg	319	‘ In the cause of the right , Mr Wegg ? ’
150267	150370	150371	150372	Mr Wegg	319	‘ Always so , Mr Venus . If the parties should use them in the cause of the wrong , that would be their act and deed . Mr Venus . I have an opinion of you , sir , to which it is not easy to give mouth . Since I called upon you that evening when you were , as I may say , floating your powerful mind in tea , I have felt that you required to be roused with an object . In this friendly move , sir , you will have a glorious object to rouse you . ’
150443	150449	150451	150451	Wegg	319	‘ While as to myself , ’
150453	150532	150451	150451	Wegg	319	‘ I am not good at it . Whether I gave myself up to prodding , or whether I gave myself up to scooping , I could n’t do it with that delicate touch so as not to show that I was disturbing the mounds . Quite different with YOU , going to work ( as YOU would ) in the light of a fellow - man , holily pledged in a friendly move to his brother man . ’
150640	150642	150644	150644	he	319	‘ which ’
150652	150660	150644	150644	he	319	‘ was surely never meant for nothing . ’
150821	150834	150835	150835	he	379	‘ I see you have tried it by yourself , Mr Wegg , ’
150842	150852	150835	150835	he	379	‘ You have found out the difficulties by experience . ’
150853	150867	150869	150869	Wegg	319	‘ No , it can hardly be said that I have tried it , ’
150878	150888	150869	150869	Wegg	319	‘ I have just skimmed it . Skimmed it . ’
150889	150897	150900	150900	his	319	‘ And found nothing besides the difficulties ? ’
150903	150916	150918	150918	Venus	379	‘ I scarcely know what to say to this , Mr Wegg , ’
150926	150930	150931	150931	Wegg	319	‘ Say yes , ’
150935	150969	150931	150931	Wegg	319	‘ If I was n’t soured , my answer would be no . But being soured , Mr Wegg , and driven to reckless madness and desperation , I suppose it ’s Yes . ’
151068	151074	151076	151076	Venus	379	‘ There ’s a footstep ! ’
151078	151081	151083	151083	Wegg	319	‘ Where ? ’
151087	151092	151083	151083	Wegg	319	‘ Outside . St ! ’
151151	151155	151157	151157	Wegg	319	‘ Come in ! ’
151191	151205	151206	151208	The friendly movers	4020	‘ Pray is Mr Silas Wegg here ? Oh ! I see him ! ’
151288	151314	151255	151256	Mr Venus	379	‘ Good evening , Mr Wegg . The yard gate - lock should be looked to , if you please ; it do n’t catch . ’
151315	151321	151323	151323	Wegg	319	‘ Is it Mr Rokesmith ? ’
151325	151388	151323	151323	Wegg	319	‘ It is Mr Rokesmith . Do n’t let me disturb you . I am not coming in . I have only a message for you , which I undertook to deliver on my way home to my lodgings . I was in two minds about coming beyond the gate without ringing : not knowing but you might have a dog about . ’
151389	151395	151397	151397	Wegg	319	‘ I wish I had , ’
151410	151424	151397	151397	Wegg	319	‘ St ! Hush ! The talking - over stranger , Mr Venus . ’
151425	151433	151435	151437	the staring Secretary	4031	‘ Is that any one I know ? ’
151439	151455	151435	151437	the staring Secretary	4031	‘ No , Mr Rokesmith . Friend of mine . Passing the evening with me . ’
151456	151556	151397	151397	Wegg	319	‘ Oh ! I beg his pardon . Mr Boffin wishes you to know that he does not expect you to stay at home any evening , on the chance of his coming . It has occurred to him that he may , without intending it , have been a tie upon you . In future , if he should come without notice , he will take his chance of finding you , and it will be all the same to him if he does not . I undertook to tell you on my way . That ’s all . ’
151561	151565	151566	151567	the Secretary	2769	‘ Good night , ’
151596	151605	151607	151607	Wegg	319	‘ And for that individual , Mr Venus , ’
151615	151632	151607	151607	Wegg	319	‘ I have been passed over ! Let me ask you what you think of him ? ’
151666	151670	151664	151664	he	379	‘ a singular look ’
151672	151682	151684	151684	Wegg	319	‘ A double look , you mean , sir , ’
151692	151722	151684	151684	Wegg	319	‘ That ’s HIS look . Any amount of singular look for me , but not a double look ! That ’s an under - handed mind , sir . ’
151723	151733	151734	151734	Venus	379	‘ Do you say there ’s something against him ? ’
151737	151742	151744	151744	Wegg	319	‘ Something against him ? ’
151746	151784	151744	151744	Wegg	319	‘ Something ? What would the relief be to my feelings — as a fellow - man — if I was n’t the slave of truth , and did n’t feel myself compelled to answer , Everything ! ’
151821	151830	151831	151831	he	319	‘ On this starlight night , Mr Venus , ’
151858	151890	151835	151835	he	319	‘ on this starlight night to think that talking - over strangers , and underhanded minds , can go walking home under the sky , as if they was all square ! ’
151891	151898	151900	151901	Mr Venus	379	‘ The spectacle of those orbs , ’
151911	151935	151900	151901	Mr Venus	379	‘ brings heavy on me her crushing words that she did not wish to regard herself nor yet to be regarded in that — ’
151936	151947	151835	151835	he	319	‘ I know ! I know ! You need n’t repeat ’em
151949	151957	151900	151901	Mr Venus	379	’ says Wegg , pressing his hand . ‘
152002	152009	152011	152011	her	4039	’ Mr Venus begins drearily replying , ‘
152031	152040	152020	152020	she	4039	’ when Silas cuts him short with dignity . ‘
152082	152361	152531	152533	An invaluable man	4044	’ Chapter 8 IN WHICH AN INNOCENT ELOPEMENT OCCURS The minion of fortune and the worm of the hour , or in less cutting language , Nicodemus Boffin , Esquire , the Golden Dustman , had become as much at home in his eminently aristocratic family mansion as he was likely ever to be . He could not but feel that , like an eminently aristocratic family cheese , it was much too large for his wants , and bred an infinite amount of parasites ; but he was content to regard this drawback on his property as a sort of perpetual Legacy Duty . He felt the more resigned to it , forasmuch as Mrs Boffin enjoyed herself completely , and Miss Bella was delighted . That young lady was , no doubt , an acquisition to the Boffins . She was far too pretty to be unattractive anywhere , and far too quick of perception to be below the tone of her new career . Whether it improved her heart might be a matter of taste that was open to question ; but as touching another matter of taste , its improvement of her appearance and manner , there could be no question whatever . And thus it soon came about that Miss Bella began to set Mrs Boffin right ; and even further , that Miss Bella began to feel ill at ease , and as it were responsible , when she saw Mrs Boffin going wrong . Not that so sweet a disposition and so sound a nature could ever go very wrong even among the great visiting authorities who agreed that the Boffins were ‘
152364	152530	152531	152533	An invaluable man	4044	’ ( which for certain was not their own case in saying so ) , but that when she made a slip on the social ice on which all the children of Podsnappery , with genteel souls to be saved , are required to skate in circles , or to slide in long rows , she inevitably tripped Miss Bella up ( so that young lady felt ) , and caused her to experience great confusion under the glances of the more skilful performers engaged in those ice - exercises . At Miss Bella ’s time of life it was not to be expected that she should examine herself very closely on the congruity or stability of her position in Mr Boffin ’s house . And as she had never been sparing of complaints of her old home when she had no other to compare it with , so there was no novelty of ingratitude or disdain in her very much preferring her new one . ‘
152537	152549	152535	152535	Rokesmith	315	’ said Mr Boffin , after some two or three months . ‘
152559	152572	152551	152551	I	0	’ Neither could Bella , so she found the subject rather interesting . ‘
152588	152593	152607	152607	he	4044	’ said Mr Boffin , ‘
152644	152645	152611	152611	his	4044	’ ‘

152664	152669	152670	152670	he	4044	’ said Mr Boffin , ‘
152710	152711	152704	152704	he	4044	’ ‘
152719	152732	152733	152733	I	0	’ said Miss Bella , with an airy toss of her head , ‘

152749	152758	152759	152759	He	4044	’ replied Mr Boffin , thinking it over . ‘
152767	152768	152759	152759	He	4044	’ ‘
152776	152780	152770	152770	he	4044	’ suggested Bella . ‘
152790	152791	152784	152784	he	4044	’ ‘
152807	152825	152826	152826	Rokesmith	315	’ repeated Mr Boffin , with a shake of his head , after again thinking it over ; ‘
152841	152842	152833	152833	he	4044	’ ‘
152851	152855	152846	152846	he	4044	’ asked Bella . ‘
152861	152866	152846	152846	he	4044	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
152894	152901	152892	152892	you	919	’ Oho ! thought Miss Bella . ‘
152913	152941	152945	152946	a Secretary	9366	’ For Mr Mortimer Lightwood had dined there two or three times , and she had met him elsewhere , and he had shown her some attention . ‘
152962	153019	152945	152946	a Secretary	9366	’ That Pa ’s daughter should be so contemptuous of Pa ’s lodger was odd ; but there were odder anomalies than that in the mind of the spoilt girl : spoilt first by poverty , and then by wealth . Be it this history ’s part , however , to leave them to unravel themselves . ‘
153028	153034	153025	153025	I	0	’ Miss Bella reflected scornfully , ‘
153081	153217	153218	153218	You	4062	’ Yet it was not so very long ago that Bella had been fluttered by the discovery that this same Secretary and lodger seem to like her . Ah ! but the eminently aristocratic mansion and Mrs Boffin ’s dressmaker had not come into play then . In spite of his seemingly retiring manners a very intrusive person , this Secretary and lodger , in Miss Bella ’s opinion . Always a light in his office - room when we came home from the play or Opera , and he always at the carriage - door to hand us out . Always a provoking radiance too on Mrs Boffin ’s face , and an abominably cheerful reception of him , as if it were possible seriously to approve what the man had in his mind ! ‘
153226	153243	153218	153218	You	4062	’ said the Secretary , encountering her by chance alone in the great drawing - room , ‘
153265	153266	153249	153249	I	0	’ ‘
153276	153286	153270	153270	you	0	’ inquired Miss Bella , with languidly drooping eyelids . ‘
153299	153336	153292	153293	your father	908	’ She coloured under the retort — so skilfully thrust , that the words seemed to be merely a plain answer , given in plain good faith — and said , rather more emphatically and sharply : ‘
153346	153347	153342	153342	you	0	’ ‘
153362	153371	153356	153356	you	4062	’ replied the Secretary with his former air . ‘
153404	153405	153393	153393	I	0	’ ‘
153416	153426	153406	153406	You	4062	’ She was too quick in this petulant sally against ‘
153430	153447	153448	153448	They	4071	’ ; and she felt that she had been so when she met his quiet look . ‘
153463	153477	153478	153478	They	4071	’ said Bella , making haste to take refuge in ill - usage . ‘
153496	153497	153486	153486	I	0	’ ‘
153505	153509	153498	153498	I	0	’ exclaimed Bella . ‘

153581	153587	153612	153612	they	4072	’ he replied with earnestness . ‘
153641	153642	153629	153629	I	0	’ ‘
153649	153663	153643	153643	I	0	’ said Bella , looking at him as if he had reproved her , ‘

153674	153680	153683	153683	me	0	’ he asked , hesitating , ‘

153741	153846	153735	153735	I	0	’ He lingered a moment , as though to give her the opportunity of prolonging the conversation if she wished . As she remained silent , he left her . Two incidents of the little interview were felt by Miss Bella herself , when alone again , to be very curious . The first was , that he unquestionably left her with a penitent air upon her , and a penitent feeling in her heart . The second was , that she had not an intention or a thought of going home , until she had announced it to him as a settled design . ‘
153862	153868	153869	153869	He	4075	’ was her mental inquiry : ‘
153895	154045	154046	154046	I	0	’ Mrs Boffin , insisting that Bella should make tomorrow ’s expedition in the chariot , she went home in great grandeur . Mrs Wilfer and Miss Lavinia had speculated much on the probabilities and improbabilities of her coming in this gorgeous state , and , on beholding the chariot from the window at which they were secreted to look out for it , agreed that it must be detained at the door as long as possible , for the mortification and confusion of the neighbours . Then they repaired to the usual family room , to receive Miss Bella with a becoming show of indifference . The family room looked very small and very mean , and the downward staircase by which it was attained looked very narrow and very crooked . The little house and all its arrangements were a poor contrast to the eminently aristocratic dwelling . ‘
154051	154055	154046	154046	I	0	’ thought Bella , ‘
154066	154107	154057	154057	I	0	’ Gloomy majesty on the part of Mrs Wilfer , and native pertness on the part of Lavvy , did not mend the matter . Bella really stood in natural need of a little help , and she got none . ‘
154110	154136	154057	154057	I	0	’ said Mrs Wilfer , presenting a cheek to be kissed , as sympathetic and responsive as the back of the bowl of a spoon , ‘
154153	154154	154155	154155	Ma	451	’ ‘
154157	154162	154155	154155	Ma	451	’ Miss Lavinia interposed , ‘
154205	154206	154185	154185	you	451	’ ‘
154212	154218	154207	154207	I	0	’ Mrs Wilfer sternly proclaimed , ‘

154231	154235	154229	154229	Ma	451	’ returned Lavvy , ‘
154248	154305	154239	154239	you	451	’ The lofty glare with which the majestic woman received this answer , might have embarrassed a less pert opponent , but it had no effect upon Lavinia : who , leaving her parent to the enjoyment of any amount of glaring at she might deem desirable under the circumstances , accosted her sister , undismayed . ‘
154341	154342	154338	154339	your Boffins	2099	’ ‘
154345	154350	154338	154339	your Boffins	2099	’ exclaimed Mrs Wilfer . ‘

154397	154406	154395	154395	Minx	571	’ said Mrs Wilfer , with dread severity . ‘
154421	154431	154395	154395	Minx	571	’ returned Lavinia , coolly , tossing her head ; ‘
154464	154467	154479	154480	Mrs Wilfer	302	’m married ! ’
154468	154477	154479	154480	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ You will not ? YOU will not ? ’
154484	154498	154479	154480	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ No , Ma , I will not . Nothing shall induce me . ’
154511	154519	154521	154521	she	302	‘ But it was to be expected ; ’
154524	154550	154521	154521	she	302	‘ A child of mine deserts me for the proud and prosperous , and another child of mine despises me . It is quite fitting . ’
154551	154554	154555	154555	Bella	307	‘ Ma , ’
154559	154591	154555	154555	Bella	307	‘ Mr and Mrs Boffin are prosperous , no doubt ; but you have no right to say they are proud . You must know very well that they are not . ’
154592	154598	154600	154600	Lavvy	317	‘ In short , Ma , ’
154613	154639	154600	154600	Lavvy	317	‘ you must know very well — or if you do n’t , more shame for you!—that Mr and Mrs Boffin are just absolute perfection . ’
154640	154643	154645	154646	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Truly , ’
154653	154787	154645	154646	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ it would seem that we are required to think so . And this , Lavinia , is my reason for objecting to a tone of levity . Mrs Boffin ( of whose physiognomy I can never speak with the composure I would desire to preserve ) , and your mother , are not on terms of intimacy . It is not for a moment to be supposed that she and her husband dare to presume to speak of this family as the Wilfers . I can not therefore condescend to speak of them as the Boffins . No ; for such a tone — call it familiarity , levity , equality , or what you will — would imply those social interchanges which do not exist . Do I render myself intelligible ? ’
154811	154830	154806	154806	Lavinia	310	‘ After all , you know , Bella , you have n’t told us how your Whatshisnames are . ’
154831	154842	154844	154844	Bella	307	‘ I do n’t want to speak of them here , ’
154857	154873	154844	154844	Bella	307	‘ They are much too kind and too good to be drawn into these discussions . ’
154874	154880	154882	154883	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Why put it so ? ’
154889	154937	154882	154883	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Why adopt a circuitous form of speech ? It is polite and it is obliging ; but why do it ? Why not openly say that they are much too kind and too good for US ? We understand the allusion . Why disguise the phrase ? ’
154938	154941	154943	154943	Bella	307	‘ Ma , ’
154952	154967	154943	154943	Bella	307	‘ you are enough to drive a saint mad , and so is Lavvy . ’
154968	154972	154974	154975	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Unfortunate Lavvy ! ’
154983	154994	154974	154975	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ She always comes for it . My poor child ! ’
155018	155034	154996	154996	Lavvy	317	‘ Do n’t patronize ME , Ma , because I can take care of myself . ’
155035	155040	155042	155043	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ I only wonder , ’
155064	155130	155042	155043	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ that you found time and inclination to tear yourself from Mr and Mrs Boffin , and come to see us at all . I only wonder that our claims , contending against the superior claims of Mr and Mrs Boffin , had any weight . I feel I ought to be thankful for gaining so much , in competition with Mr and Mrs Boffin . ’
155176	155179	155181	155181	Bella	307	‘ Ma , ’
155185	155302	155181	155181	Bella	307	‘ you force me to say that I am truly sorry I did come home , and that I never will come home again , except when poor dear Pa is here . For , Pa is too magnanimous to feel envy and spite towards my generous friends , and Pa is delicate enough and gentle enough to remember the sort of little claim they thought I had upon them and the unusually trying position in which , through no act of my own , I had been placed . And I always did love poor dear Pa better than all the rest of you put together , and I always do and I always shall ! ’
155322	155328	155330	155331	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ I think , R.W. , ’
155342	155392	155330	155331	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ that if you were present , it would be a trial to your feelings to hear your wife and the mother of your family depreciated in your name . But Fate has spared you this , R.W. , whatever it may have thought proper to inflict upon her ! ’
155400	155406	155394	155395	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ I hate the Boffins ! ’
155411	155428	155429	155430	the Boffins	410	‘ I do n’t care who objects to their being called the Boffins . I WILL call ’em
155471	155486	155463	155463	I	0	’ which was not strictly the fact , but the young lady was excited : ‘
155504	155533	155535	155535	Me	0	’ Here Miss Lavinia burst into tears . The front garden - gate clanked , and the Secretary was seen coming at a brisk pace up the steps . ‘
155543	155562	155581	155581	he	4094	’ said Mrs Wilfer , rising with stately resignation as she shook her head and dried her eyes ; ‘
155599	155622	155592	155592	him	4094	’ With those words she stalked out . In a few moments she stalked in again , proclaiming in her heraldic manner , ‘
155636	155666	155623	155624	Mr Rokesmith	315	’ Mr Rokesmith followed close upon his name , and of course saw what was amiss . But he discreetly affected to see nothing , and addressed Miss Bella . ‘
155724	155736	155715	155715	I	0	’ Bella took it in her hand , and thanked him . ‘
155781	155811	155779	155779	Lavvy	317	’ and with a kiss for each Miss Bella turned to the door . The Secretary would have attended her , but Mrs Wilfer advancing and saying with dignity , ‘
155836	155870	155871	155876	The male domestic of Mrs Boffin	4101	’ he begged pardon and gave place . It was a very magnificent spectacle indeed , to see Mrs Wilfer throw open the house - door , and loudly demand with extended gloves , ‘
155878	155892	155893	155894	Miss Wilfer	307	’ To whom presenting himself , she delivered the brief but majestic charge , ‘
155899	155996	155893	155894	Miss Wilfer	307	’ and so delivered her over , like a female Lieutenant of the Tower relinquishing a State Prisoner . The effect of this ceremonial was for some quarter of an hour afterwards perfectly paralyzing on the neighbours , and was much enhanced by the worthy lady airing herself for that term in a kind of splendidly serene trance on the top step . When Bella was seated in the carriage , she opened the little packet in her hand . It contained a pretty purse , and the purse contained a bank note for fifty pounds . ‘
156008	156012	156014	156014	I	0	’ said Bella , ‘
156023	156069	156070	156075	the male domestic of Mrs Boffin	4101	’ As she was uninformed respecting the exact locality of the place of business of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles , but knew it to be near Mincing Lane , she directed herself to be driven to the corner of that darksome spot . Thence she despatched ‘
156077	156183	156070	156075	the male domestic of Mrs Boffin	4101	’ in search of the counting - house of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles , with a message importing that if R. Wilfer could come out , there was a lady waiting who would be glad to speak with him . The delivery of these mysterious words from the mouth of a footman caused so great an excitement in the counting - house , that a youthful scout was instantly appointed to follow Rumty , observe the lady , and come in with his report . Nor was the agitation by any means diminished , when the scout rushed back with the intelligence that the lady was ‘
156196	156245	156070	156075	the male domestic of Mrs Boffin	4101	’ Rumty himself , with his pen behind his ear under his rusty hat , arrived at the carriage - door in a breathless condition , and had been fairly lugged into the vehicle by his cravat and embraced almost unto choking , before he recognized his daughter . ‘
156250	156257	156070	156075	the male domestic of Mrs Boffin	4101	’ he then panted , incoherently . ‘
156282	156283	156271	156271	you	4106	’ ‘
156295	156296	156292	156293	Pa dear	4111	’ ‘
156309	156316	156304	156304	you	580	’ asked R. W. , dubiously . ‘
156327	156328	156325	156325	Lavvy	317	’ ‘
156338	156344	156325	156325	Lavvy	317	’ observed the patient cherub ; ‘

156389	156390	156388	156388	Pa.	577	’ ‘
156420	156442	156388	156388	Pa.	577	’ replied R. Wilfer , modestly dropping his voice on the word , as he eyed the canary - coloured fittings . ‘
156451	156452	156449	156449	Pa	580	’ ‘
156472	156483	156449	156449	Pa	580	’ he admitted , drawing his hand across his mouth . ‘

156633	156634	156638	156638	I	0	’ ‘
156652	156665	156648	156648	I	0	’ her father delicately hinted , with a glance out at window , ‘
156696	156727	156728	156728	I	0	’ Bella laughed and put on his hat again . But when his boyish figure bobbed away , its shabbiness and cheerful patience smote the tears out of her eyes . ‘
156738	156744	156730	156731	that Secretary	4124	’ she said to herself , ‘
156752	156771	156730	156731	that Secretary	4124	’ Back came her father , more like a boy than ever , in his release from school . ‘
156788	156789	156799	156799	Pa	580	’ ‘
156824	156829	156830	156830	You	580	’ It demanded cogitation . ‘
156836	156840	156830	156830	You	580	’ he explained , ‘
156861	156867	156830	156830	You	580	’ At length he suggested , ‘
156880	156911	156830	156830	You	580	’ So , they were driven there , and Bella dismissed the chariot ; sending a pencilled note by it to Mrs Boffin , that she was with her father . ‘
156933	156934	156935	156935	I	0	’ ‘
156943	156944	156945	156945	You	580	’ ‘

157039	157048	157049	157049	You	580	’ pointing her forefinger at him , merrily . ‘
157062	157134	157059	157059	you	580	’ There was water in the foolish little fellow ’s eyes , but she kissed them dry ( though her own were wet ) , and he bobbed away again . After half an hour , he came back , so brilliantly transformed , that Bella was obliged to walk round him in ecstatic admiration twenty times , before she could draw her arm through his , and delightedly squeeze it . ‘
157139	157147	157137	157137	Pa	580	’ said Bella , hugging him close , ‘
157156	157157	157137	157137	Pa	580	’ ‘

157210	157217	157180	157180	you	580	’ said R. W. , timidly , ‘

157518	157533	157510	157510	We	4158	’ he returned , thinking about it , not quite satisfied with the phrase : ‘
157613	157623	157611	157611	Bella	307	’ he added , after a moment ’s reflection ; ‘
157781	157782	157783	157784	Poor Pa	580	’ ‘
157786	157797	157783	157784	Poor Pa	580	’ thought Bella , as she hung upon his arm . ‘
157810	157822	157801	157801	I	0	’ the cherub pursued mildly and without a notion of complaining , ‘
157834	157835	157847	157847	Pa.	577	’ ‘
157891	157892	157887	157887	I	0	’ ‘
157908	158706	158707	158707	I	0	’ A happy and a chatty man was Pa in his new clothes that day . Take it for all in all , it was perhaps the happiest day he had ever known in his life ; not even excepting that on which his heroic partner had approached the nuptial altar to the tune of the Dead March in Saul . The little expedition down the river was delightful , and the little room overlooking the river into which they were shown for dinner was delightful . Everything was delightful . The park was delightful , the punch was delightful , the dishes of fish were delightful , the wine was delightful . Bella was more delightful than any other item in the festival ; drawing Pa out in the gayest manner ; making a point of always mentioning herself as the lovely woman ; stimulating Pa to order things , by declaring that the lovely woman insisted on being treated with them ; and in short causing Pa to be quite enraptured with the consideration that he WAS the Pa of such a charming daughter . And then , as they sat looking at the ships and steamboats making their way to the sea with the tide that was running down , the lovely woman imagined all sorts of voyages for herself and Pa. Now , Pa , in the character of owner of a lumbering square - sailed collier , was tacking away to Newcastle , to fetch black diamonds to make his fortune with ; now , Pa was going to China in that handsome threemasted ship , to bring home opium , with which he would for ever cut out Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles , and to bring home silks and shawls without end for the decoration of his charming daughter . Now , John Harmon ’s disastrous fate was all a dream , and he had come home and found the lovely woman just the article for him , and the lovely woman had found him just the article for her , and they were going away on a trip , in their gallant bark , to look after their vines , with streamers flying at all points , a band playing on deck and Pa established in the great cabin . Now , John Harmon was consigned to his grave again , and a merchant of immense wealth ( name unknown ) had courted and married the lovely woman , and he was so enormously rich that everything you saw upon the river sailing or steaming belonged to him , and he kept a perfect fleet of yachts for pleasure , and that little impudent yacht which you saw over there , with the great white sail , was called The Bella , in honour of his wife , and she held her state aboard when it pleased her , like a modern Cleopatra . Anon , there would embark in that troop - ship when she got to Gravesend , a mighty general , of large property ( name also unknown ) , who would n’t hear of going to victory without his wife , and whose wife was the lovely woman , and she was destined to become the idol of all the red coats and blue jackets alow and aloft . And then again : you saw that ship being towed out by a steam - tug ? Well ! where did you suppose she was going to ? She was going among the coral reefs and cocoa - nuts and all that sort of thing , and she was chartered for a fortunate individual of the name of Pa ( himself on board , and much respected by all hands ) , and she was going , for his sole profit and advantage , to fetch a cargo of sweet - smelling woods , the most beautiful that ever were seen , and the most profitable that ever were heard of ; and her cargo would be a great fortune , as indeed it ought to be : the lovely woman who had purchased her and fitted her expressly for this voyage , being married to an Indian Prince , who was a Something - or - Other , and who wore Cashmere shawls all over himself and diamonds and emeralds blazing in his turban , and was beautifully coffee - coloured and excessively devoted , though a little too jealous . Thus Bella ran on merrily , in a manner perfectly enchanting to Pa , who was as willing to put his head into the Sultan ’s tub of water as the beggar - boys below the window were to put THEIR heads in the mud . ‘
158713	158719	158795	158795	Pa	580	’ said Pa after dinner , ‘
158737	158791	158795	158795	Pa	580	’ Bella shook her head . Did n’t know . Could n’t say . All she was able to report was , that she was most handsomely supplied with everything she could possibly want , and that whenever she hinted at leaving Mr and Mrs Boffin , they would n’t hear of it . ‘
158797	158801	158802	158802	I	0	’ pursued Bella , ‘
158824	158825	158826	158826	I	0	’ ‘
158838	158854	158833	158833	you	919	’ returned her father , first glancing at himself ; and then at the dessert . ‘

158904	158908	158897	158897	I	0	’ returned R. W. ‘
158924	158942	158919	158922	Pa. O - o	577	’ cried Bella , screwing the exclamation out of herself with a twist of her dimpled chin . ‘
158948	158966	158945	158946	so mercenary	4177	’ With a wistful glance R. W. said , in default of having anything better to say : ‘
158981	158982	158970	158970	you	580	’ ‘
159089	159090	159080	159080	I	0	’ ‘

159114	159140	159112	159112	Pa	580	’ said Bella , nodding at him , with her very pretty eyebrows raised as high as they would go , and looking comically frightened . ‘
159152	159153	159154	159154	Lor	482	’ ‘

159214	159229	159191	159192	a Pa	4186	’ added Bella , laughing as she pointed a rallying finger at his face , ‘

159277	159288	159263	159263	you	577	’ observed R. W. , with some trepidation of manner , ‘

159303	159307	159263	159263	you	577	’ laughed Bella . ‘
159376	159441	159356	159356	I	0	’ R. W. submitted his head to the operator , and the operator went on talking ; at the same time putting separate locks of his hair through a curious process of being smartly rolled over her two revolving forefingers , which were then suddenly pulled out of it in opposite lateral directions . On each of these occasions the patient winced and winked . ‘
159482	159510	159473	159473	I	0	’ R. W. cast up his eyes towards her , as well as he could under the operating circumstances , and said in a tone of remonstrance , ‘

159795	159807	159808	159808	Pa	580	’ her father was emphatically beginning : when she stopped him . ‘

159948	159972	159981	159981	Pa	580	’ Fain to be satisfied with this concession from the lovely woman , R. W. rang the bell , and paid the bill . ‘
159983	160021	159981	159981	Pa	580	’ said Bella , rolling up the purse when they were alone again , hammering it small with her little fist on the table , and cramming it into one of the pockets of his new waistcoat , ‘
160095	160243	160248	160248	Pa	580	’ After which , she tugged at his coat with both hands , and pulled him all askew in buttoning that garment over the precious waistcoat pocket , and then tied her dimples into her bonnet - strings in a very knowing way , and took him back to London . Arrived at Mr Boffin ’s door , she set him with his back against it , tenderly took him by the ears as convenient handles for her purpose , and kissed him until he knocked muffled double knocks at the door with the back of his head . That done , she once more reminded him of their compact and gaily parted from him . Not so gaily , however , but that tears filled her eyes as he went away down the dark street . Not so gaily , but that she several times said , ‘
160259	160356	160257	160257	Pa	580	’ before she took heart to knock at the door . Not so gaily , but that the brilliant furniture seemed to stare her out of countenance as if it insisted on being compared with the dingy furniture at home . Not so gaily , but that she fell into very low spirits sitting late in her own room , and very heartily wept , as she wished , now that the deceased old John Harmon had never made a will about her , now that the deceased young John Harmon had lived to marry her . ‘

160385	160482	160483	160484	Mrs Boffin	324	’ Chapter 9 IN WHICH THE ORPHAN MAKES HIS WILL The Secretary , working in the Dismal Swamp betimes next morning , was informed that a youth waited in the hall who gave the name of Sloppy . The footman who communicated this intelligence made a decent pause before uttering the name , to express that it was forced on his reluctance by the youth in question , and that if the youth had had the good sense and good taste to inherit some other name it would have spared the feelings of him the bearer . ‘
160491	160501	160503	160503	him	4203	’ said the Secretary in a perfectly composed way . ‘
160506	160534	160503	160503	him	4203	’ Mr Sloppy being introduced , remained close to the door : revealing in various parts of his form many surprising , confounding , and incomprehensible buttons . ‘

160561	160599	160559	160559	you	4203	’ Sloppy explained that he had meant to come before , but that the Orphan ( of whom he made mention as Our Johnny ) had been ailing , and he had waited to report him well . ‘
160606	160611	160613	160613	he	4203	’ said the Secretary . ‘
160617	160639	160613	160613	he	4203	’ said Sloppy . Mr Sloppy having shaken his head to a considerable extent , proceeded to remark that he thought Johnny ‘

160682	160715	160675	160675	he	0	’em wot you could n’t kiver with a sixpence . Pressed to fall back upon a nominative case , he opined that they wos about as red as ever red could be . ‘

160749	160799	160800	160800	He	8755	’ John Rokesmith hoped the child had had medical attendance ? Oh yes , said Sloppy , he had been took to the doctor ’s shop once . And what did the doctor call it ? Rokesmith asked him . After some perplexed reflection , Sloppy answered , brightening , ‘
160811	160816	160800	160800	He	8755	’ Rokesmith suggested measles . ‘
160819	160825	160800	160800	He	8755	’ said Sloppy with confidence , ‘
160835	160860	160833	160833	sir	8755	’ ( Mr Sloppy was elevated by this fact , and seemed to consider that it reflected credit on the poor little patient . ) ‘

161055	161211	161053	161053	Sloppy	496	‘ when I was a - turning at the wheel pretty late , the mangle seemed to go like Our Johnny ’s breathing . It begun beautiful , then as it went out it shook a little and got unsteady , then as it took the turn to come home it had a rattle - like and lumbered a bit , then it come smooth , and so it went on till I scarce know’d which was mangle and which was Our Johnny . Nor Our Johnny , he scarce know’d either , for sometimes when the mangle lumbers he says , “ Me choking , Granny ! ” and Mrs Higden holds him up in her lap and says to me “ Bide a bit , Sloppy , ” and we all stops together . And when Our Johnny gets his breathing again , I turns again , and we all goes on together . ’
161272	161277	161279	161279	Rokesmith	315	‘ This is unfortunate , ’
161281	161298	161279	161279	Rokesmith	315	‘ I must go and break it to Mrs Boffin . Stay you here , Sloppy . ’
161359	161370	161372	161373	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Ah , my poor dear pretty little John Harmon ! ’
161375	161379	161381	161383	the sympathetic Sloppy	496	‘ Yes mum , ’
161385	161403	161405	161407	the pleasant creature	2063	‘ You do n’t think he is in a very , very bad way , do you ? ’
161445	161451	161453	161454	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ So bad as that ! ’
161456	161468	161453	161454	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ And Betty Higden not to tell me of it sooner ! ’
161469	161480	161482	161482	Sloppy	496	‘ I think she might have been mistrustful , mum , ’
161486	161495	161482	161482	Sloppy	496	‘ Of what , for Heaven ’s sake ? ’
161496	161507	161509	161509	Sloppy	496	‘ I think she might have been mistrustful , mum , ’
161513	161548	161509	161509	Sloppy	496	‘ of standing in Our Johnny ’s light . There ’s so much trouble in illness , and so much expense , and she ’s seen such a lot of its being objected to . ’
161549	161557	161559	161560	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ But she never can have thought , ’
161562	161572	161559	161560	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ that I would grudge the dear child anything ? ’
161573	161608	161609	161609	Sloppy	496	‘ No mum , but she might have thought ( as a habit - like ) of its standing in Johnny ’s light , and might have tried to bring him through it unbeknownst . ’
161787	161802	161804	161805	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ It ’s not a right place for the poor child to stay in , ’

162987	163008	162980	162982	the good Lord	4252	’m quick to take this fright , I know , and my head is summ’at light with wearying and watching . ’

163079	163086	163088	163091	the sweet compassionate soul	4254	‘ Now , see , Betty , ’
163098	163181	163088	163091	the sweet compassionate soul	4254	‘ what I really did mean , and what I should have begun by saying out , if I had only been a little wiser and handier . We want to move Johnny to a place where there are none but children ; a place set up on purpose for sick children ; where the good doctors and nurses pass their lives with children , talk to none but children , touch none but children , comfort and cure none but children . ’
163182	163190	163192	163194	the old woman	10331	‘ Is there really such a place ? ’
163202	163243	163192	163194	the old woman	10331	‘ Yes , Betty , on my word , and you shall see it . If my home was a better place for the dear boy , I ’d take him to it ; but indeed indeed it ’s not . ’
163244	163250	163252	163252	Betty	494	‘ You shall take him , ’
163260	163296	163252	163252	Betty	494	‘ where you will , my deary . I am not so hard , but that I believe your face and voice , and I will , as long as I can see and hear . ’
163455	163466	163448	163449	the doctor	9014	‘ This should have been days ago . Too late ! ’
163668	164000	164001	164001	I	0	’ houses , woolly dogs with mechanical barks in them not very dissimilar from the artificial voice pervading the bowels of the yellow bird , tin armies , Moorish tumblers , wooden tea things , and the riches of the earth . As Johnny murmured something in his placid admiration , the ministering women at his bed ’s head asked him what he said . It seemed that he wanted to know whether all these were brothers and sisters of his ? So they told him yes . It seemed then , that he wanted to know whether God had brought them all together there ? So they told him yes again . They made out then , that he wanted to know whether they would all get out of pain ? So they answered yes to that question likewise , and made him understand that the reply included himself . Johnny ’s powers of sustaining conversation were as yet so very imperfectly developed , even in a state of health , that in sickness they were little more than monosyllabic . But , he had to be washed and tended , and remedies were applied , and though those offices were far , far more skilfully and lightly done than ever anything had been done for him in his little life , so rough and short , they would have hurt and tired him but for an amazing circumstance which laid hold of his attention . This was no less than the appearance on his own little platform in pairs , of All Creation , on its way into his own particular ark : the elephant leading , and the fly , with a diffident sense of his size , politely bringing up the rear . A very little brother lying in the next bed with a broken leg , was so enchanted by this spectacle that his delight exalted its enthralling interest ; and so came rest and sleep . ‘
164016	164021	164014	164014	Betty	494	’ whispered Mrs Boffin . ‘
164039	164077	164024	164024	ma’am	1643	’ So , they kissed him , and left him there , and old Betty was to come back early in the morning , and nobody but Rokesmith knew for certain how that the doctor had said , ‘
164088	164346	164351	164351	Johnny	368	’ But , Rokesmith knowing it , and knowing that his bearing it in mind would be acceptable thereafter to that good woman who had been the only light in the childhood of desolate John Harmon dead and gone , resolved that late at night he would go back to the bedside of John Harmon ’s namesake , and see how it fared with him . The family whom God had brought together were not all asleep , but were all quiet . From bed to bed , a light womanly tread and a pleasant fresh face passed in the silence of the night . A little head would lift itself up into the softened light here and there , to be kissed as the face went by — for these little patients are very loving — and would then submit itself to be composed to rest again . The mite with the broken leg was restless , and moaned ; but after a while turned his face towards Johnny ’s bed , to fortify himself with a view of the ark , and fell asleep . Over most of the beds , the toys were yet grouped as the children had left them when they last laid themselves down , and , in their innocent grotesqueness and incongruity , they might have stood for the children ’s dreams . The doctor came in too , to see how it fared with Johnny . And he and Rokesmith stood together , looking down with compassion on him . ‘
164353	164373	164374	164374	Him	368	’ Rokesmith was the questioner , and put an arm round the poor baby as he made a struggle . ‘
164376	164382	164383	164383	Those	2094	’ said the little fellow . ‘
164385	164481	164383	164383	Those	2094	’ The doctor was quick to understand children , and , taking the horse , the ark , the yellow bird , and the man in the Guards , from Johnny ’s bed , softly placed them on that of his next neighbour , the mite with the broken leg . With a weary and yet a pleased smile , and with an action as if he stretched his little figure out to rest , the child heaved his body on the sustaining arm , and seeking Rokesmith ’s face with his lips , said : ‘
164489	165104	164383	164383	Those	2094	’ Having now bequeathed all he had to dispose of , and arranged his affairs in this world , Johnny , thus speaking , left it . Chapter 10 A SUCCESSOR Some of the Reverend Frank Milvey ’s brethren had found themselves exceedingly uncomfortable in their minds , because they were required to bury the dead too hopefully . But , the Reverend Frank , inclining to the belief that they were required to do one or two other things ( say out of nine - and - thirty ) calculated to trouble their consciences rather more if they would think as much about them , held his peace . Indeed , the Reverend Frank Milvey was a forbearing man , who noticed many sad warps and blights in the vineyard wherein he worked , and did not profess that they made him savagely wise . He only learned that the more he himself knew , in his little limited human way , the better he could distantly imagine what Omniscience might know . Wherefore , if the Reverend Frank had had to read the words that troubled some of his brethren , and profitably touched innumerable hearts , in a worse case than Johnny ’s , he would have done so out of the pity and humility of his soul . Reading them over Johnny , he thought of his own six children , but not of his poverty , and read them with dimmed eyes . And very seriously did he and his bright little wife , who had been listening , look down into the small grave and walk home arm - in - arm . There was grief in the aristocratic house , and there was joy in the Bower . Mr Wegg argued , if an orphan were wanted , was he not an orphan himself ; and could a better be desired ? And why go beating about Brentford bushes , seeking orphans forsooth who had established no claims upon you and made no sacrifices for you , when here was an orphan ready to your hand who had given up in your cause , Miss Elizabeth , Master George , Aunt Jane , and Uncle Parker ? Mr Wegg chuckled , consequently , when he heard the tidings . Nay , it was afterwards affirmed by a witness who shall at present be nameless , that in the seclusion of the Bower he poked out his wooden leg , in the stage - ballet manner , and executed a taunting or triumphant pirouette on the genuine leg remaining to him . John Rokesmith ’s manner towards Mrs Boffin at this time , was more the manner of a young man towards a mother , than that of a Secretary towards his employer ’s wife . It had always been marked by a subdued affectionate deference that seemed to have sprung up on the very day of his engagement ; whatever was odd in her dress or her ways had seemed to have no oddity for him ; he had sometimes borne a quietly - amused face in her company , but still it had seemed as if the pleasure her genial temper and radiant nature yielded him , could have been quite as naturally expressed in a tear as in a smile . The completeness of his sympathy with her fancy for having a little John Harmon to protect and rear , he had shown in every act and word , and now that the kind fancy was disappointed , he treated it with a manly tenderness and respect for which she could hardly thank him enough . ‘

165595	165624	165626	165626	Noddy	326	’ said that worthy soul , taking her comfortable place on a large ottoman in the centre of the room , and drawing her arm through Bella ’s ; ‘

165844	165859	165805	165806	John Harmon	273	’ said Mr Boffin , gravely propounding a case for his Secretary ’s opinion ; ‘
165868	165869	165805	165806	John Harmon	273	’ ‘
165880	165886	165805	165806	John Harmon	273	’ said Rokesmith , gently . ‘

165936	166025	166035	166036	Mr Boffin	324	’ said Bella , colouring—‘or at least it was not , until it led to my being here — but that is not the point in my thoughts . As we had given the name to the poor child , and as the poor child took so lovingly to me , I think I should feel jealous of calling another child by it . I think I should feel as if the name had become endeared to me , and I had no right to use it so . ’
166026	166033	166035	166036	Mr Boffin	324	‘ And that ’s your opinion ? ’
166049	166061	166063	166064	the Secretary	2769	‘ I say again , it is a matter of feeling , ’
166066	166078	166063	166064	the Secretary	2769	‘ I think Miss Wilfer ’s feeling very womanly and pretty . ’
166079	166089	166091	166092	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Now , give us your opinion , Noddy , ’
166094	166101	166091	166092	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ My opinion , old lady , ’
166107	166112	166103	166105	the Golden Dustman	449	‘ is your opinion . ’
166113	166116	166118	166119	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Then , ’
166121	166248	166118	166119	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ we agree not to revive John Harmon ’s name , but to let it rest in the grave . It is , as Mr Rokesmith says , a matter of feeling , but Lor how many matters ARE matters of feeling ! Well ; and so I come to the second thing I have thought of . You must know , Bella , my dear , and Mr Rokesmith , that when I first named to my husband my thoughts of adopting a little orphan boy in remembrance of John Harmon , I further named to my husband that it was comforting to think that how the poor boy would be benefited by John ’s own money , and protected from John ’s own forlornness . ’
166249	166254	166256	166257	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Hear , hear ! ’
166259	166266	166256	166257	Mr Boffin	324	‘ So she did . Ancoar ! ’
166267	166278	166280	166281	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ No , not Ancoar , Noddy , my dear , ’
166283	166376	166280	166281	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ because I am going to say something else . I meant that , I am sure , as much as I still mean it . But this little death has made me ask myself the question , seriously , whether I was n’t too bent upon pleasing myself . Else why did I seek out so much for a pretty child , and a child quite to my liking ? Wanting to do good , why not do it for its own sake , and put my tastes and likings by ? ’
166377	166380	166382	166382	Bella	307	‘ Perhaps , ’
166407	166438	166386	166386	she	307	‘ perhaps , in reviving the name , you would not have liked to give it to a less interesting child than the original . He interested you very much . ’
166439	166445	166447	166448	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Well , my dear , ’
166455	166516	166447	166448	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ it ’s kind of you to find that reason out , and I hope it may have been so , and indeed to a certain extent I believe it was so , but I am afraid not to the whole extent . However , that do n’t come in question now , because we have done with the name . ’
166517	166525	166527	166527	Bella	307	‘ Laid it up as a remembrance , ’
166531	166585	166527	166527	Bella	307	‘ Much better said , my dear ; laid it up as a remembrance . Well then ; I have been thinking if I take any orphan to provide for , let it not be a pet and a plaything for me , but a creature to be helped for its own sake . ’
166586	166591	166593	166593	Bella	307	‘ Not pretty then ? ’
166595	166598	166593	166593	Bella	307	‘ No , ’
166605	166610	166612	166612	Bella	307	‘ Nor prepossessing then ? ’
166614	166617	166612	166612	Bella	307	‘ No , ’
166622	166694	166619	166620	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Not necessarily so . That ’s as it may happen . A well - disposed boy comes in my way who may be even a little wanting in such advantages for getting on in life , but is honest and industrious and requires a helping hand and deserves it . If I am very much in earnest and quite determined to be unselfish , let me take care of HIM . ’
166733	166742	166744	166744	Rokesmith	315	‘ Shall he be brought here , ma’am ? ’
166746	166749	166751	166752	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Yes , ’
167004	167014	167018	167018	him	496	‘ And how is Betty , my good fellow ? ’
167020	167025	167027	167027	Sloppy	496	‘ Thankee , mum , ’
167029	167057	167027	167027	Sloppy	496	‘ she do pretty nicely , and sending her dooty and many thanks for the tea and all faviours and wishing to know the family ’s healths . ’
167058	167066	167018	167018	him	496	‘ Have you just come , Sloppy ? ’
167067	167072	167027	167027	Sloppy	496	‘ Yes , mum . ’
167073	167083	167027	167027	Sloppy	496	‘ Then you have not had your dinner yet ? ’
167084	167115	167018	167018	him	496	‘ No , mum . But I mean to it . For I ai n’t forgotten your handsome orders that I was never to go away without having had a good ’
167131	167136	167027	167027	Sloppy	496	’em , for I reckoned ’em
167141	167163	167027	167027	Sloppy	496	’em ; meat one , beer two , vegetables three , and which was four?—Why , pudding , HE was four ! ’
167180	167189	167191	167192	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ How are the two poor little Minders ? ’
167194	167206	167191	167192	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Striking right out , mum , and coming round beautiful . ’
167227	167230	167224	167224	her	4317	‘ Sloppy . ’
167231	167236	167224	167224	her	4317	‘ Yes , mum . ’
167237	167252	167224	167224	her	4317	‘ Come forward , Sloppy . Should you like to dine here every day ? ’
167253	167259	167224	167224	her	4317	‘ Off of all four on ’em
167266	167285	167264	167264	mum	11572	’ Sloppy ’s feelings obliged him to squeeze his hat , and contract one leg at the knee . ‘

167317	167339	167314	167315	Mrs Higden	494	’ said Sloppy , checking himself in his raptures , drawing back , and shaking his head with very serious meaning . ‘
167387	167414	167415	167415	You	496	’ At the mere thought of Mrs Higden in this inconceivable affliction , Mr Sloppy ’s countenance became pale , and manifested the most distressful emotions . ‘
167426	167430	167424	167424	Sloppy	496	’ said Mrs Boffin ‘
167485	167486	167492	167492	mum	11572	’ ‘
167494	167500	167492	167492	mum	11572	’ answered the ecstatic Sloppy , ‘
167553	167564	167565	167565	I	0	’ added Sloppy , after a moment ’s apologetic reflection , ‘

168307	168311	168313	168314	Miss Peecher	519	‘ I wonder , ’
168331	168339	168317	168317	she	519	‘ what they call Hexam ’s sister ? ’
168356	168362	168340	168341	Mary Anne	520	‘ Well , Mary Anne ? ’
168363	168371	168317	168317	she	519	‘ She is named Lizzie , ma’am . ’
168372	168386	168388	168389	Miss Peecher	519	‘ She can hardly be named Lizzie , I think , Mary Anne , ’
168397	168407	168388	168389	Miss Peecher	519	‘ Is Lizzie a Christian name , Mary Anne ? ’
168429	168440	168418	168418	herself	520	‘ No , it is a corruption , Miss Peecher . ’
168441	168448	168449	168450	Miss Peecher	519	‘ Who gave her that name ? ’
168487	168498	168449	168450	Miss Peecher	519	‘ I mean of what name is it a corruption ? ’
168499	168508	168463	168463	she	519	‘ Elizabeth , or Eliza , Miss Peecher . ’
168509	168534	168535	168536	Miss Peecher	519	‘ Right , Mary Anne . Whether there were any Lizzies in the early Christian Church must be considered very doubtful , very doubtful . ’
168542	168573	168535	168536	Miss Peecher	519	‘ Speaking correctly , we say , then , that Hexam ’s sister is called Lizzie ; not that she is named so . Do we not , Mary Anne ? ’
168574	168581	168463	168463	she	519	‘ We do , Miss Peecher . ’
168582	168586	168588	168589	Miss Peecher	519	‘ And where , ’
168615	168639	168593	168593	her	519	‘ where does this young woman , who is called but not named Lizzie , live ? Think , now , before answering . ’
168640	168654	168669	168670	Miss Peecher	519	‘ In Church Street , Smith Square , by Mill Bank , ma’am . ’

168897	168936	168881	168881	You	520	’ The discreet Mary Anne resumed her seat and her silence , and stitched , and stitched , and was stitching when the schoolmaster ’s shadow came in before him , announcing that he might be instantly expected . ‘
168943	168956	168940	168941	Miss Peecher	519	’ he said , pursuing the shadow , and taking its place . ‘

169052	169062	169063	169064	Charley Hexam	291	’ repeated Miss Peecher , in her own thoughts . ‘

169169	169182	169127	169127	sir	8755	’ pursued Bradley , laying his door - key on the table , ‘
169201	169202	169198	169199	Miss Peecher	519	’ ‘

169663	169670	169646	169646	He	517	’ thought that sharp young personage , ‘

169757	169781	169784	169784	you	0	’ Bradley glanced distrustfully at the shrewd face again bending over the work , and said , trying to conquer doubt and hesitation : ‘

169819	169834	169813	169813	you	517	’ returned Miss Wren , snapping her fingers in a volley of impatient snaps , ‘

170070	170104	170062	170062	her	592	’ pursued Miss Wren , doing so , and making two little dabs at him in the air with her needle , as if she pricked him with it in his own eyes ; ‘

170217	170222	170177	170177	him	291	’ exclaimed the dressmaker . ‘

170444	170461	170463	170464	Miss Wren	523	‘ The third party hobbles awfully , you know , when she ’s left to herself ; ’
170466	170492	170463	170464	Miss Wren	523	‘ her back being so bad , and her legs so queer ; so she ca n’t retire gracefully unless you help her , Lizzie . ’

170573	170605	170571	170571	he	517	‘ I come from Charley , because I left him only a little while ago ; but I am not commissioned by Charley . I come of my own spontaneous act . ’
170646	170651	170653	170653	Bradley	517	‘ The fact is , ’
170683	170715	170716	170716	He	517	‘ the truth is , that Charley , having no secrets from me ( to the best of my belief ) , has confided the whole of this matter to me . ’
170726	170732	170723	170723	Lizzie	246	‘ what matter , sir ? ’
170733	170737	170739	170740	the schoolmaster	10545	‘ I thought , ’
170769	170826	170827	170827	He	517	‘ that it might be so superfluous as to be almost impertinent , to enter upon a definition of it . My allusion was to this matter of your having put aside your brother ’s plans for you , and given the preference to those of Mr — I believe the name is Mr Eugene Wrayburn . ’
170872	170930	170860	170860	he	517	‘ Your brother ’s plans were communicated to me when he first had them in his thoughts . In point of fact he spoke to me about them when I was last here — when we were walking back together , and when I — when the impression was fresh upon me of having seen his sister . ’
170979	170986	170988	170988	Bradley	517	‘ I approved of his idea , ’
171011	171086	170988	170988	Bradley	517	‘ both because your brother ought naturally to be the originator of any such scheme , and because I hoped to be able to promote it . I should have had inexpressible pleasure , I should have taken inexpressible interest , in promoting it . Therefore I must acknowledge that when your brother was disappointed , I too was disappointed . I wish to avoid reservation or concealment , and I fully acknowledge that . ’
171162	171274	171275	171275	He	4397	‘ I am a man of strong feelings , and I have strongly felt this disappointment . I do strongly feel it . I do n’t show what I feel ; some of us are obliged habitually to keep it down . To keep it down . But to return to your brother . He has taken the matter so much to heart that he has remonstrated ( in my presence he remonstrated ) with Mr Eugene Wrayburn , if that be the name . He did so , quite ineffectually . As any one not blinded to the real character of Mr — Mr Eugene Wrayburn — would readily suppose . ’
171314	171378	171379	171380	Lizzie Hexam	246	‘ Finally , I resolved to come here alone , and appeal to you . I resolved to come here alone , and entreat you to retract the course you have chosen , and instead of confiding in a mere stranger — a person of most insolent behaviour to your brother and others — to prefer your brother and your brother ’s friend . ’
171416	171524	171410	171410	she	246	‘ I can not doubt , Mr Headstone , that your visit is well meant . You have been so good a friend to Charley that I have no right to doubt it . I have nothing to tell Charley , but that I accepted the help to which he so much objects before he made any plans for me ; or certainly before I knew of any . It was considerately and delicately offered , and there were reasons that had weight with me which should be as dear to Charley as to me . I have no more to say to Charley on this subject . ’
171549	171563	171564	171564	she	4398	‘ I should have told Charley , if he had come to me , ’
171576	171655	171564	171564	she	4398	‘ that Jenny and I find our teacher very able and very patient , and that she takes great pains with us . So much so , that we have said to her we hope in a very little while to be able to go on by ourselves . Charley knows about teachers , and I should also have told him , for his satisfaction , that ours comes from an institution where teachers are regularly brought up . ’

171684	171745	171670	171670	his	517	‘ I should like to ask you , if I may without offence , whether you would have objected — no ; rather , I should like to say , if I may without offence , that I wish I had had the opportunity of coming here with your brother and devoting my poor abilities and experience to your service . ’
171746	171753	171781	171781	he	517	‘ Thank you , Mr Headstone . ’
171754	171759	171760	171760	he	517	‘ But I fear , ’
171801	171815	171781	171781	he	517	‘ that my humble services would not have found much favour with you ? ’
171853	171944	171841	171841	he	517	‘ There is only one thing more I had to say , but it is the most important . There is a reason against this matter , there is a personal relation concerned in this matter , not yet explained to you . It might — I do n’t say it would — it might — induce you to think differently . To proceed under the present circumstances is out of the question . Will you please come to the understanding that there shall be another interview on the subject ? ’
171945	171952	171841	171841	he	517	‘ With Charley , Mr Headstone ? ’

Now that the speaker ceased , the little creature laid down her head again , and moaned , ‘

173882	175165	173871	173871	She	246	’ She had stretched her hands up with that higher and better look , and now she turned again , and folded them round Lizzie ’s neck , and rocked herself on Lizzie ’s breast . Chapter 12 MORE BIRDS OF PREY Rogue Riderhood dwelt deep and dark in Limehouse Hole , among the riggers , and the mast , oar and block makers , and the boat - builders , and the sail - lofts , as in a kind of ship ’s hold stored full of waterside characters , some no better than himself , some very much better , and none much worse . The Hole , albeit in a general way not over nice in its choice of company , was rather shy in reference to the honour of cultivating the Rogue ’s acquaintance ; more frequently giving him the cold shoulder than the warm hand , and seldom or never drinking with him unless at his own expense . A part of the Hole , indeed , contained so much public spirit and private virtue that not even this strong leverage could move it to good fellowship with a tainted accuser . But , there may have been the drawback on this magnanimous morality , that its exponents held a true witness before Justice to be the next unneighbourly and accursed character to a false one . Had it not been for the daughter whom he often mentioned , Mr Riderhood might have found the Hole a mere grave as to any means it would yield him of getting a living . But Miss Pleasant Riderhood had some little position and connection in Limehouse Hole . Upon the smallest of small scales , she was an unlicensed pawnbroker , keeping what was popularly called a Leaving Shop , by lending insignificant sums on insignificant articles of property deposited with her as security . In her four - and - twentieth year of life , Pleasant was already in her fifth year of this way of trade . Her deceased mother had established the business , and on that parent ’s demise she had appropriated a secret capital of fifteen shillings to establishing herself in it ; the existence of such capital in a pillow being the last intelligible confidential communication made to her by the departed , before succumbing to dropsical conditions of snuff and gin , incompatible equally with coherence and existence . Why christened Pleasant , the late Mrs Riderhood might possibly have been at some time able to explain , and possibly not . Her daughter had no information on that point . Pleasant she found herself , and she could n’t help it . She had not been consulted on the question , any more than on the question of her coming into these terrestrial parts , to want a name . Similarly , she found herself possessed of what is colloquially termed a swivel eye ( derived from her father ) , which she might perhaps have declined if her sentiments on the subject had been taken . She was not otherwise positively ill - looking , though anxious , meagre , of a muddy complexion , and looking as old again as she really was . As some dogs have it in the blood , or are trained , to worry certain creatures to a certain point , so — not to make the comparison disrespectfully — Pleasant Riderhood had it in the blood , or had been trained , to regard seamen , within certain limits , as her prey . Show her a man in a blue jacket , and , figuratively speaking , she pinned him instantly . Yet , all things considered , she was not of an evil mind or an unkindly disposition . For , observe how many things were to be considered according to her own unfortunate experience . Show Pleasant Riderhood a Wedding in the street , and she only saw two people taking out a regular licence to quarrel and fight . Show her a Christening , and she saw a little heathen personage having a quite superfluous name bestowed upon it , inasmuch as it would be commonly addressed by some abusive epithet : which little personage was not in the least wanted by anybody , and would be shoved and banged out of everybody ’s way , until it should grow big enough to shove and bang . Show her a Funeral , and she saw an unremunerative ceremony in the nature of a black masquerade , conferring a temporary gentility on the performers , at an immense expense , and representing the only formal party ever given by the deceased . Show her a live father , and she saw but a duplicate of her own father , who from her infancy had been taken with fits and starts of discharging his duty to her , which duty was always incorporated in the form of a fist or a leathern strap , and being discharged hurt her . All things considered , therefore , Pleasant Riderhood was not so very , very bad . There was even a touch of romance in her — of such romance as could creep into Limehouse Hole — and maybe sometimes of a summer evening , when she stood with folded arms at her shop - door , looking from the reeking street to the sky where the sun was setting , she may have had some vaporous visions of far - off islands in the southern seas or elsewhere ( not being geographically particular ) , where it would be good to roam with a congenial partner among groves of bread - fruit , waiting for ships to be wafted from the hollow ports of civilization . For , sailors to be got the better of , were essential to Miss Pleasant ’s Eden . Not on a summer evening did she come to her little shop - door , when a certain man standing over against the house on the opposite side of the street took notice of her . That was on a cold shrewd windy evening , after dark . Pleasant Riderhood shared with most of the lady inhabitants of the Hole , the peculiarity that her hair was a ragged knot , constantly coming down behind , and that she never could enter upon any undertaking without first twisting it into place . At that particular moment , being newly come to the threshold to take a look out of doors , she was winding herself up with both hands after this fashion . And so prevalent was the fashion , that on the occasion of a fight or other disturbance in the Hole , the ladies would be seen flocking from all quarters universally twisting their back - hair as they came along , and many of them , in the hurry of the moment , carrying their back - combs in their mouths . It was a wretched little shop , with a roof that any man standing in it could touch with his hand ; little better than a cellar or cave , down three steps . Yet in its ill - lighted window , among a flaring handkerchief or two , an old peacoat or so , a few valueless watches and compasses , a jar of tobacco and two crossed pipes , a bottle of walnut ketchup , and some horrible sweets these — creature discomforts serving as a blind to the main business of the Leaving Shop — was displayed the inscription SEAMAN ’S

176668	176672	176665	176665	you	594	’ asked Pleasant . ‘
176697	176718	176689	176689	you	594	’ Pleasant with a grave look shook her head ; importing that she understood the process , but decidedly disapproved . ‘
176725	176729	176689	176689	you	594	’ said she , ‘
176749	176750	176735	176736	No one	1150	’ ‘

Bringing her inherited eye to bear upon him , Pleasant Riderhood felt more and more uncomfortable , his manner was so mysterious , so stern , so self - possessed . ‘
176927	176932	176850	176850	my	0	’ said the damsel , ‘
177011	177112	176998	176999	my mother	9865	’ In the way of trade Miss Pleasant would have taken — and indeed did take when she could — as much as thirty shillings a week for board that would be dear at five , and likewise conducted the Leaving business upon correspondingly equitable principles ; yet she had that tenderness of conscience and those feelings of humanity , that the moment her ideas of trade were overstepped , she became the seaman ’s champion , even against her father whom she seldom otherwise resisted . But , she was here interrupted by her father ’s voice exclaiming angrily , ‘
177118	177193	176998	176999	my mother	9865	’ and by her father ’s hat being heavily flung from his hand and striking her face . Accustomed to such occasional manifestations of his sense of parental duty , Pleasant merely wiped her face on her hair ( which of course had tumbled down ) before she twisted it up . This was another common procedure on the part of the ladies of the Hole , when heated by verbal or fistic altercation . ‘
177210	177255	177258	177258	you	4475	’ growled Mr Riderhood , stooping to pick up his hat , and making a feint at her with his head and right elbow ; for he took the delicate subject of robbing seamen in extraordinary dudgeon , and was out of humour too . ‘

180581	180856	180574	180574	he	9179	‘ Captain ! Mentioning them unfort’net words of mine respecting Gaffer , it is contrairily to be bore in mind that Gaffer always were a precious rascal , and that his line were a thieving line . Likeways when I went to them two Governors , Lawyer Lightwood and the t’other Governor , with my information , I may have been a little over - eager for the cause of justice , or ( to put it another way ) a little over - stimilated by them feelings which rouses a man up , when a pot of money is going about , to get his hand into that pot of money for his family ’s sake . Besides which , I think the wine of them two Governors was — I will not say a hocussed wine , but fur from a wine as was elthy for the mind . And there ’s another thing to be remembered , Captain . Did I stick to them words when Gaffer was no more , and did I say bold to them two Governors , “ Governors both , wot I informed I still inform ; wot was took down I hold to ” ? No . I says , frank and open — no shuffling , mind you , Captain!—“I may have been mistook , I ’ve been a thinking of it , it may n’t have been took down correct on this and that , and I wo n’t swear to thick and thin , I ’d rayther forfeit your good opinions than do it . ” And so far as I know , ’
180870	180915	180858	180859	Mr Riderhood	360	‘ I HAVE actiwally forfeited the good opinions of several persons — even your own , Captain , if I understand your words — but I ’d sooner do it than be forswore . There ; if that ’s conspiracy , call me conspirator . ’

180934	180967	180923	180924	the visitor	9882	‘ a statement that it was all utterly false , and the poor girl shall have it . I will bring it with me for your signature , when I come again . ’
180968	180977	180979	180979	Riderhood	360	‘ When might you be expected , Captain ? ’
180989	181007	180979	180979	Riderhood	360	‘ Quite soon enough for you . I shall not disappoint you ; do n’t be afraid . ’
181008	181020	180923	180924	the visitor	9882	‘ Might you be inclined to leave any name , Captain ? ’
181021	181034	180923	180924	the visitor	9882	‘ No , not at all . I have no such intention . ’
181035	181048	181050	181050	Riderhood	360	‘ “ Shall ” is summ’at of a hard word , Captain , ’

181153	181179	181183	181184	Mr Riderhood	360	‘ Hear me out , Captain , hear me out ! All I was wishing to mention , Captain , afore you took your departer , ’
181192	181203	181183	181184	Mr Riderhood	360	‘ was , your handsome words relating to the reward . ’

181550	181619	181620	181620	He	839	‘ I have never been here since that night , and never was here before that night , but thus much I recognize . I wonder which way did we take when we came out of that shop . We turned to the right as I have turned , but I can recall no more . Did we go by this alley ? Or down that little lane ? ’
181640	181734	181735	181735	He	839	‘ I remember there were poles pushed out of upper windows on which clothes were drying , and I remember a low public - house , and the sound flowing down a narrow passage belonging to it of the scraping of a fiddle and the shuffling of feet . But here are all these things in the lane , and here are all these things in the alley . And I have nothing else in my mind but a wall , a dark doorway , a flight of stairs , and a room . ’
181790	181805	181807	181807	he	839	‘ This is like what I have read in narratives of escape from prison , ’
181809	181845	181807	181807	he	839	‘ where the little track of the fugitives in the night always seems to take the shape of the great round world , on which they wander ; as if it were a secret law . ’
181981	181993	181995	181995	he	839	‘ I have no clue to the scene of my death , ’
181997	182027	181995	181995	he	839	‘ Not that it matters now . But having risked discovery by venturing here at all , I should have been glad to track some part of the way . ’
182110	182121	182123	182123	he	839	‘ It is a sensation not experienced by many mortals , ’
182125	182202	182123	182123	he	839	‘ to be looking into a churchyard on a wild windy night , and to feel that I no more hold a place among the living than these dead do , and even to know that I lie buried somewhere else , as they lie buried here . Nothing uses me to it . A spirit that was once a man could hardly feel stranger or lonelier , going unrecognized among mankind , than I feel . ‘
182302	182470	182475	182476	third mate	4566	‘ When I came to England , attracted to the country with which I had none but most miserable associations , by the accounts of my fine inheritance that found me abroad , I came back , shrinking from my father ’s money , shrinking from my father ’s memory , mistrustful of being forced on a mercenary wife , mistrustful of my father ’s intention in thrusting that marriage on me , mistrustful that I was already growing avaricious , mistrustful that I was slackening in gratitude to the two dear noble honest friends who had made the only sunlight in my childish life or that of my heartbroken sister . I came back , timid , divided in my mind , afraid of myself and everybody here , knowing of nothing but wretchedness that my father ’s wealth had ever brought about . Now , stop , and so far think it out , John Harmon . Is that so ? That is exactly so . ‘
182662	182873	182877	182877	he	4577	‘ However , a sociable word or two on these mistakes became an easy introduction between us , and the weather was hot , and he helped me to a cool cabin on deck alongside his own , and his first school had been at Brussels as mine had been , and he had learnt French as I had learnt it , and he had a little history of himself to relate — God only knows how much of it true , and how much of it false — that had its likeness to mine . I had been a seaman too . So we got to be confidential together , and the more easily yet , because he and every one on board had known by general rumour what I was making the voyage to England for . By such degrees and means , he came to the knowledge of my uneasiness of mind , and of its setting at that time in the direction of desiring to see and form some judgment of my allotted wife , before she could possibly know me for myself ; also to try Mrs Boffin and give her a glad surprise . So the plot was made out of our getting common sailors ’
182965	183059	183061	183061	I	0	‘ His advantage in all this was , that for a time I was to be lost . It might be for a day or for two days , but I must be lost sight of on landing , or there would be recognition , anticipation , and failure . Therefore , I disembarked with my valise in my hand — as Potterson the steward and Mr Jacob Kibble my fellow - passenger afterwards remembered — and waited for him in the dark by that very Limehouse Church which is now behind me . ‘
183156	183201	183210	183210	he	360	‘ But let me go on thinking the facts out , and avoid confusing them with my speculations . Whether he took me by a straight way or a crooked way , what is that to the purpose now ? Steady , John Harmon . ‘
183414	183579	183580	183580	He	360	‘ It is my conviction that we can not have gone a mile from that shop , before we came to the wall , the dark doorway , the flight of stairs , and the room . The night was particularly dark and it rained hard . As I think the circumstances back , I hear the rain splashing on the stone pavement of the passage , which was not under cover . The room overlooked the river , or a dock , or a creek , and the tide was out . Being possessed of the time down to that point , I know by the hour that it must have been about low water ; but while the coffee was getting ready , I drew back the curtain ( a dark - brown curtain ) , and , looking out , knew by the kind of reflection below , of the few neighbouring lights , that they were reflected in tidal mud . ‘
183746	183791	183792	183792	I	0	‘ Now , I pass to sick and deranged impressions ; they are so strong , that I rely upon them ; but there are spaces between them that I know nothing about , and they are not pervaded by any idea of time . ‘
184048	184091	184024	184024	I	0	‘ This is still correct ? Still correct , with the exception that I can not possibly express it to myself without using the word I. But it was not I. There was no such thing as I , within my knowledge . ‘
184186	184314	184176	184176	I	0	‘ I was very weak and faint , frightfully oppressed with drowsiness , and driving fast with the tide . Looking over the black water , I saw the lights racing past me on the two banks of the river , as if they were eager to be gone and leave me dying in the dark . The tide was running down , but I knew nothing of up or down then . When , guiding myself safely with Heaven ’s assistance before the fierce set of the water , I at last caught at a boat moored , one of a tier of boats at a causeway , I was sucked under her , and came up , only just alive , on the other side . ‘
184446	184576	184438	184438	I	0	‘ I have checked the calculation often , and it must have been two nights that I lay recovering in that public - house . Let me see . Yes . I am sure it was while I lay in that bed there , that the thought entered my head of turning the danger I had passed through , to the account of being for some time supposed to have disappeared mysteriously , and of proving Bella . The dread of our being forced on one another , and perpetuating the fate that seemed to have fallen on my father ’s riches — the fate that they should lead to nothing but evil — was strong upon the moral timidity that dates from my childhood with my poor sister . ‘
184671	184744	184748	184748	I	0	‘ I could not have done it , but for the fortune in the waterproof belt round my body . Not a great fortune , forty and odd pounds for the inheritor of a hundred and odd thousand ! But it was enough . Without it I must have disclosed myself . Without it , I could never have gone to that Exchequer Coffee House , or taken Mrs Wilfer ’s lodgings . ‘
184862	184897	184898	184898	I	0	‘ Again I ramble away from thinking it out to the end . It is not so far to the end that I need be tempted to break off . Now , on straight ! ‘
185087	185189	185191	185192	John Harmon	273	‘ That night I almost gave up my mystery , though I suspected no one , could offer no information , knew absolutely nothing save that the murdered man was not I , but Radfoot . Next day while I hesitated , and next day while I hesitated , it seemed as if the whole country were determined to have me dead . The Inquest declared me dead , the Government proclaimed me dead ; I could not listen at my fireside for five minutes to the outer noises , but it was borne into my ears that I was dead . ‘
185263	185326	185253	185254	John Rokesmith	315	‘ Now , is it all thought out ? All to this time ? Nothing omitted ? No , nothing . But beyond this time ? To think it out through the future , is a harder though a much shorter task than to think it out through the past . John Harmon is dead . Should John Harmon come to life ? ‘
185337	185338	185253	185254	John Rokesmith	315	’ ‘
185470	185674	185677	185677	I	0	‘ Now , take no . The reasons why John Harmon should not come to life . Because he has passively allowed these dear old faithful friends to pass into possession of the property . Because he sees them happy with it , making a good use of it , effacing the old rust and tarnish on the money . Because they have virtually adopted Bella , and will provide for her . Because there is affection enough in her nature , and warmth enough in her heart , to develop into something enduringly good , under favourable conditions . Because her faults have been intensified by her place in my father ’s will , and she is already growing better . Because her marriage with John Harmon , after what I have heard from her own lips , would be a shocking mockery , of which both she and I must always be conscious , and which would degrade her in her mind , and me in mine , and each of us in the other ’s . Because if John Harmon comes to life and does not marry her , the property falls into the very hands that hold it now . ‘
185810	185910	185804	185805	a Sultan	4634	‘ What would I have ? If the dead could know , or do know , how the living use them , who among the hosts of dead has found a more disinterested fidelity on earth than I ? Is not that enough for me ? If I had come back , these noble creatures would have welcomed me , wept over me , given up everything to me with joy . I did not come back , and they have passed unspoiled into my place . Let them rest in it , and let Bella rest in hers . ‘
186068	186146	186060	186061	John Harmon	273	‘ That I may never , in the days to come afar off , have any weak misgiving that Bella might , in any contingency , have taken me for my own sake if I had plainly asked her , I WILL plainly ask her : proving beyond all question what I already know too well . And now it is all thought out , from the beginning to the end , and my mind is easier . ’

186469	186491	186415	186418	the late John Harmon	273	‘ Yes , quite well . I was sorry to hear , when I came in , that YOU were not . ’
186492	186536	186415	186418	the late John Harmon	273	‘ A mere nothing . I had a headache — gone now — and was not quite fit for a hot theatre , so I stayed at home . I asked you if you were not well , because you look so white . ’

187935	187966	187920	187920	Bella	307	‘ is it generous and honourable to use the power here which your favour with Mr and Mrs Boffin and your ability in your place give you , against me ? ’

187972	188013	187920	187920	Bella	307	‘ Is it generous and honourable to form a plan for gradually bringing their influence to bear upon a suit which I have shown you that I do not like , and which I tell you that I utterly reject ? ’
188041	188096	187881	187881	Bella	307	‘ Would it be generous and honourable to step into your place — if you did so , for I do n’t know that you did , and I hope you did not — anticipating , or knowing beforehand , that I should come here , and designing to take me at this disadvantage ? ’
188097	188104	188106	188107	the Secretary	2769	‘ This mean and cruel disadvantage , ’

188129	188168	188116	188117	The Secretary	2769	‘ You are wholly mistaken , Miss Wilfer ; wonderfully mistaken . I can not say , however , that it is your fault . If I deserve better things of you , you do not know it . ’

188185	188297	188177	188177	Bella	307	‘ you know the history of my being here at all . I have heard Mr Boffin say that you are master of every line and word of that will , as you are master of all his affairs . And was it not enough that I should have been willed away , like a horse , or a dog , or a bird ; but must you too begin to dispose of me in your mind , and speculate in me , as soon as I had ceased to be the talk and the laugh of the town ? Am I for ever to be made the property of strangers ? ’
188298	188302	188304	188305	the Secretary	2769	‘ Believe me , ’

188381	188453	188454	188454	He	4665	‘ I am glad I have spoken , then , Mr Rokesmith . It has been painful and difficult , but it is done . If I have hurt you , I hope you will forgive me .

192185	192198	192176	192176	ye	2767	’ said the stanch old heart , observant of Bella ’s face : ‘
192236	192268	192230	192233	a farmer ’s wife	4757	’ The Secretary took that opportunity of touching on the practical question of Mr Sloppy ’s capabilities . He would have made a wonderful cabinet - maker , said Mrs Higden , ‘
192281	192363	192230	192233	a farmer ’s wife	4757	’ She had seen him handle tools that he had borrowed to mend the mangle , or to knock a broken piece of furniture together , in a surprising manner . As to constructing toys for the Minders , out of nothing , he had done that daily . And once as many as a dozen people had got together in the lane to see the neatness with which he fitted the broken pieces of a foreign monkey ’s musical instrument . ‘
192368	192373	192230	192233	a farmer ’s wife	4757	’ said the Secretary . ‘
192386	192526	192527	192527	I	0	’ John Harmon being buried under mountains now , the Secretary that very same day set himself to finish his affairs and have done with him . He drew up an ample declaration , to be signed by Rogue Riderhood ( knowing he could get his signature to it , by making him another and much shorter evening call ) , and then considered to whom should he give the document ? To Hexam ’s son , or daughter ? Resolved speedily , to the daughter . But it would be safer to avoid seeing the daughter , because the son had seen Julius Handford , and — he could not be too careful — there might possibly be some comparison of notes between the son and daughter , which would awaken slumbering suspicion , and lead to consequences . ‘
192531	192535	192527	192527	I	0	’ he reflected , ‘
192547	192715	192527	192527	I	0	’ Therefore , best to send it to the daughter under cover by the post . Pleasant Riderhood had undertaken to find out where she lived , and it was not necessary that it should be attended by a single word of explanation . So far , straight . But , all that he knew of the daughter he derived from Mrs Boffin ’s accounts of what she heard from Mr Lightwood , who seemed to have a reputation for his manner of relating a story , and to have made this story quite his own . It interested him , and he would like to have the means of knowing more — as , for instance , that she received the exonerating paper , and that it satisfied her — by opening some channel altogether independent of Lightwood : who likewise had seen Julius Handford , who had publicly advertised for Julius Handford , and whom of all men he , the Secretary , most avoided . ‘
192746	192958	192960	192960	I	0	’ Now , to cast about for some likely means of opening such a channel . The boy , Hexam , was training for and with a schoolmaster . The Secretary knew it , because his sister ’s share in that disposal of him seemed to be the best part of Lightwood ’s account of the family . This young fellow , Sloppy , stood in need of some instruction . If he , the Secretary , engaged that schoolmaster to impart it to him , the channel might be opened . The next point was , did Mrs Boffin know the schoolmaster ’s name ? No , but she knew where the school was . Quite enough . Promptly the Secretary wrote to the master of that school , and that very evening Bradley Headstone answered in person . The Secretary stated to the schoolmaster how the object was , to send to him for certain occasional evening instruction , a youth whom Mr and Mrs Boffin wished to help to an industrious and useful place in life . The schoolmaster was willing to undertake the charge of such a pupil . The Secretary inquired on what terms ? The schoolmaster stated on what terms . Agreed and disposed of . ‘
192965	192970	192960	192960	I	0	’ said Bradley Headstone , ‘

193030	193058	193027	193028	Mr Harmon	273	’ said Bradley : who would have been a great deal more at a loss than he was , if he had known to whom he spoke : ‘

193192	193273	193188	193188	His	287	’ He could hardly get the words out , even then and there , so fierce did he grow ( though keeping himself down with infinite pains of repression ) , when the careless and contemptuous bearing of Eugene Wrayburn rose before his mind . The Secretary saw there was a strong feeling here on some sore point , and he would have made a diversion from it , but for Bradley ’s holding to it in his cumbersome way . ‘
193285	193291	193274	193274	I	0	’ he said , doggedly . ‘
193303	193372	193299	193301	Mr Eugene Wrayburn	269	’ The Secretary remembered him . In his disturbed recollection of that night when he was striving against the drugged drink , there was but a dim image of Eugene ’s person ; but he remembered his name , and his manner of speaking , and how he had gone with them to view the body , and where he had stood , and what he had said . ‘
193383	193394	193375	193376	Mr Headstone	517	’ he asked , again trying to make a diversion , ‘

193408	193422	193406	193406	Lizzie	494	’ said the schoolmaster , with a strong contraction of his whole face . ‘

193578	193590	193571	193571	I	0	’ said Bradley , after casting his eyes on the ground , ‘
193649	193734	193737	193737	you	0	’ With a shaking hand , Bradley took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow . The Secretary thought , as he glanced at the schoolmaster ’s face , that he had opened a channel here indeed , and that it was an unexpectedly dark and deep and stormy one , and difficult to sound . All at once , in the midst of his turbulent emotions , Bradley stopped and seemed to challenge his look . Much as though he suddenly asked him , ‘
193742	193743	193737	193737	you	0	’ ‘
193756	193768	193751	193751	your	0	’ said the Secretary , quietly going back to the point ; ‘
193856	193857	193858	193858	Sir	8755	’ ‘
193860	193868	193858	193858	Sir	8755	’ replied Bradley , very restlessly indeed , ‘
193878	193879	193869	193869	I	0	’ ‘
193887	193892	193869	193869	I	0	’ said the Secretary . ‘
193924	193925	193928	193928	sir	8755	’ ‘
193930	193940	193928	193928	sir	8755	’ returned Bradley , with a kind of anger . ‘
193949	193950	193951	193952	The sister	4347	’ ‘
193954	193977	193951	193952	The sister	4347	’ said Bradley , separating his words over - carefully , and speaking as if he were repeating them from a book , ‘
194086	194087	194074	194074	I	0	’ ‘
194095	194136	194074	194074	I	0	’ said the Secretary . Bradley Headstone knotted his brows , and squared his large lower jaw , and fixed his eyes on the ground with an air of determination that seemed unnecessary to the occasion , as he replied : ‘
194144	194289	194290	194290	I	0	’ The Secretary had no reason or excuse for prolonging the conversation , and it ended here . Within three hours the oakum - headed apparition once more dived into the Leaving Shop , and that night Rogue Riderhood ’s recantation lay in the post office , addressed under cover to Lizzie Hexam at her right address . All these proceedings occupied John Rokesmith so much , that it was not until the following day that he saw Bella again . It seemed then to be tacitly understood between them that they were to be as distantly easy as they could , without attracting the attention of Mr and Mrs Boffin to any marked change in their manner . The fitting out of old Betty Higden was favourable to this , as keeping Bella engaged and interested , and as occupying the general attention . ‘
194293	194329	194290	194290	I	0	’ said Rokesmith , when they all stood about her , while she packed her tidy basket — except Bella , who was busily helping on her knees at the chair on which it stood ; ‘
194385	194386	194379	194379	they	4800	’ ‘
194393	194398	194379	194379	they	4800	’ said Mr Boffin ; ‘
194414	194415	194379	194379	they	4800	’ ‘
194434	194439	194432	194432	Noddy	326	’ said Mrs Boffin . ‘
194447	194453	194432	194432	Noddy	326	’ returned the Golden Dustman . ‘
194457	194458	194432	194432	Noddy	326	’ ‘
194473	194480	194481	194481	I	0	’ asked Bella , looking up . ‘
194499	194504	194505	194505	Patrons	4801	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
194559	194618	194522	194523	Deceased Patronesses	4812	’em pretty well up to his neck ! If Mr Tom Noakes gives his five shillings ai n’t he a Patron , and if Mrs Jack Styles gives her five shillings ai n’t she a Patroness ? What the deuce is it all about ? If it ai n’t stark staring impudence , what do you call it ? ’
194619	194627	194628	194629	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Do n’t be warm , Noddy , ’
194632	194635	194637	194638	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Warm ! ’
194640	194825	194637	194638	Mr Boffin	324	‘ It ’s enough to make a man smoking hot . I ca n’t go anywhere without being Patronized . I do n’t want to be Patronized . If I buy a ticket for a Flower Show , or a Music Show , or any sort of Show , and pay pretty heavy for it , why am I to be Patroned and Patronessed as if the Patrons and Patronesses treated me ? If there ’s a good thing to be done , ca n’t it be done on its own merits ? If there ’s a bad thing to be done , can it ever be Patroned and Patronessed right ? Yet when a new Institution ’s going to be built , it seems to me that the bricks and mortar ai n’t made of half so much consequence as the Patrons and Patronesses ; no , nor yet the objects . I wish somebody would tell me whether other countries get Patronized to anything like the extent of this one ! And as to the Patrons and Patronesses themselves , I wonder they ’re
194853	194885	194831	194831	They	4815	’ Having delivered himself of these remarks , Mr Boffin took a trot , according to his usual custom , and trotted back to the spot from which he had started . ‘
194893	194898	194891	194891	Rokesmith	315	’ said Mr Boffin , ‘
194900	194938	194940	194941	Mr Boffin	324	’re as right as a trivet . Give her the letter , make her take the letter , put it in her pocket by violence . She might fall sick . You know you might fall sick , ’
194943	194961	194940	194941	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Do n’t deny it , Mrs Higden , in your obstinacy ; you know you might . ’
194978	194983	194985	194986	Mr Boffin	324	‘ That ’s right ! ’
194988	195016	194985	194986	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Come ! That ’s sensible . And do n’t be thankful to us ( for we never thought of it ) , but to Mr Rokesmith . ’
195032	195040	195042	195043	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Now , how do you feel ? ’
195045	195051	195042	195043	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Do you like it ? ’
195052	195058	195060	195060	Betty	494	‘ The letter , sir ? ’
195062	195071	195060	195060	Betty	494	‘ Ay , it ’s a beautiful letter ! ’
195072	195083	195085	195086	Mr Boffin	324	‘ No , no , no ; not the letter , ’
195088	195096	195060	195060	Betty	494	‘ the idea . Are you sure you ’re
195105	195106	195060	195060	Betty	494	’ ‘
195132	195133	195130	195130	sir	8755	’ ‘
195146	195151	195130	195130	sir	8755	’ urged Mr Boffin ; ‘
195202	195222	195184	195195	a retired literary man of the name of Wegg that lives there	4820	’ Old Betty was proof even against this temptation , and fell to adjusting her black bonnet and shawl . ‘
195239	195244	195223	195223	I	0	’ said Mr Boffin , ‘
195291	195369	195285	195285	Betty	505	’ It was the man in the Guards who had been on duty over Johnny ’s bed . The solitary old woman showed what it was , and put it up quietly in her dress . Then , she gratefully took leave of Mrs Boffin , and of Mr Boffin , and of Rokesmith , and then put her old withered arms round Bella ’s young and blooming neck , and said , repeating Johnny ’s words : ‘
195377	195508	195509	195512	That dolls ’ dressmaker	12200	’ The Secretary looked on from a doorway at the boofer lady thus encircled , and still looked on at the boofer lady standing alone there , when the determined old figure with its steady bright eyes was trudging through the streets , away from paralysis and pauperism . Chapter 15 THE WHOLE CASE SO FAR Bradley Headstone held fast by that other interview he was to have with Lizzie Hexam . In stipulating for it , he had been impelled by a feeling little short of desperation , and the feeling abided by him . It was very soon after his interview with the Secretary , that he and Charley Hexam set out one leaden evening , not unnoticed by Miss Peecher , to have this desperate interview accomplished . ‘
195511	195514	195516	195516	Bradley	517	’ dressmaker , ’
195518	195530	195516	195516	Bradley	517	‘ is favourable neither to me nor to you , Hexam . ’
195531	195587	195509	195512	That dolls ’ dressmaker	12200	‘ A pert crooked little chit , Mr Headstone ! I knew she would put herself in the way , if she could , and would be sure to strike in with something impertinent . It was on that account that I proposed our going to the City to - night and meeting my sister . ’
195588	195593	195595	195595	Bradley	517	‘ So I supposed , ’
195608	195613	195595	195595	Bradley	517	‘ So I supposed . ’
195614	195620	195622	195622	Charley	291	‘ Nobody but my sister , ’
195624	195661	195622	195622	Charley	291	‘ would have found out such an extraordinary companion . She has done it in a ridiculous fancy of giving herself up to another . She told me so , that night when we went there . ’
195662	195673	195675	195675	Bradley	517	‘ Why should she give herself up to the dressmaker ? ’
195677	195680	195682	195683	the boy	1061	‘ Oh ! ’
195687	195734	195682	195683	the boy	1061	‘ One of her romantic ideas ! I tried to convince her so , but I did n’t succeed . However , what we have got to do , is , to succeed to - night , Mr Headstone , and then all the rest follows . ’
195735	195743	195622	195622	Charley	291	‘ You are still sanguine , Hexam . ’
195744	195760	195682	195683	the boy	1061	‘ Certainly I am , sir . Why , we have everything on our side . ’
195761	195768	195770	195770	Bradley	517	‘ Except your sister , perhaps , ’
195783	195789	195791	195792	the boy	1061	‘ Everything on our side , ’
195797	195811	195791	195792	the boy	1061	‘ Respectability , an excellent connexion for me , common sense , everything ! ’
195812	195827	195829	195829	Bradley	517	‘ To be sure , your sister has always shown herself a devoted sister , ’
195843	195886	195829	195829	Bradley	517	‘ Naturally , Mr Headstone , I have a good deal of influence with her . And now that you have honoured me with your confidence and spoken to me first , I say again , we have everything on our side . ’
195892	195899	195888	195888	Bradley	517	‘ Except your sister , perhaps . ’
196186	196202	196176	196176	Bradley	517	‘ Here she comes , Mr Headstone ! Let us go forward and meet her . ’
196235	196247	196248	196248	she	246	‘ Why , where are you going , Charley , dear ? ’
196253	196264	196248	196248	she	246	‘ Nowhere . We came on purpose to meet you . ’
196265	196272	196218	196218	she	246	‘ To meet me , Charley ? ’
196273	196336	196248	196248	she	246	‘ Yes . We are going to walk with you . But do n’t let us take the great leading streets where every one walks , and we ca n’t hear ourselves speak . Let us go by the quiet backways . Here ’s a large paved court by this church , and quiet , too . Let us go up here . ’
196337	196348	196218	196218	she	246	‘ But it ’s not in the way , Charley . ’
196349	196354	196356	196357	the boy	1061	‘ Yes it is , ’
196361	196374	196356	196357	the boy	1061	‘ It ’s in my way , and my way is yours . ’
196407	196414	196397	196397	He	1061	‘ Come along , Mr Headstone . ’
196532	196660	196526	196527	the boy	1061	‘ Lizzie , Mr Headstone has something to say to you . I do n’t wish to be an interruption either to him or to you , and so I ’ll go and take a little stroll and come back . I know in a general way what Mr Headstone intends to say , and I very highly approve of it , as I hope — and indeed I do not doubt — you will . I need n’t tell you , Lizzie , that I am under great obligations to Mr Headstone , and that I am very anxious for Mr Headstone to succeed in all he undertakes . As I hope — and as , indeed , I do n’t doubt — you must be . ’
196661	196664	196666	196667	his sister	1021	‘ Charley , ’
196677	196699	196666	196667	his sister	1021	‘ I think you had better stay . I think Mr Headstone had better not say what he thinks of saying . ’
196700	196711	196526	196527	the boy	1061	‘ Why , how do you know what it is ? ’
196716	196724	196526	196527	the boy	1061	‘ Perhaps I do n’t , but — ’
196725	196777	196778	196778	She	1021	‘ Perhaps you do n’t ? No , Liz , I should think not . If you knew what it was , you would give me a very different answer . There ; let go ; be sensible . I wonder you do n’t remember that Mr Headstone is looking on . ’
196793	196806	196788	196788	he	4864	‘ Now Liz , be a rational girl and a good sister , ’
196832	196836	196837	196837	he	4864	‘ I said , ’
196840	196922	196837	196837	he	4864	‘ when I saw you last , that there was something unexplained , which might perhaps influence you . I have come this evening to explain it . I hope you will not judge of me by my hesitating manner when I speak to you . You see me at my greatest disadvantage . It is most unfortunate for me that I wish you to see me at my best , and that I know you see me at my worst . ’
196939	196952	196953	196953	he	4868	‘ It seems egotistical to begin by saying so much about myself , ’
196956	197004	196953	196953	he	4868	‘ but whatever I say to you seems , even in my own ears , below what I want to say , and different from what I want to say . I ca n’t help it . So it is . You are the ruin of me . ’
197031	197118	197005	197005	She	4867	‘ Yes ! you are the ruin — the ruin — the ruin — of me . I have no resources in myself , I have no confidence in myself , I have no government of myself when you are near me or in my thoughts . And you are always in my thoughts now . I have never been quit of you since I first saw you . Oh , that was a wretched day for me ! That was a wretched , miserable day ! ’
197136	197157	197133	197133	she	4869	‘ Mr Headstone , I am grieved to have done you any harm , but I have never meant it . ’
197158	197161	197162	197162	he	4868	‘ There ! ’
197167	197208	197211	197211	himself	4868	‘ Now , I seem to have reproached you , instead of revealing to you the state of my own mind ! Bear with me . I am always wrong when you are in question . It is my doom . ’
197255	197331	197251	197251	he	4868	‘ I must try to give expression to what is in my mind ; it shall and must be spoken . Though you see me so confounded — though you strike me so helpless — I ask you to believe that there are many people who think well of me ; that there are some people who highly esteem me ; that I have in my way won a Station which is considered worth winning . ’
197332	197352	197251	197251	he	4868	‘ Surely , Mr Headstone , I do believe it . Surely I have always known it from Charley . ’
197353	197421	197251	197251	he	4868	‘ I ask you to believe that if I were to offer my home such as it is , my station such as it is , my affections such as they are , to any one of the best considered , and best qualified , and most distinguished , among the young women engaged in my calling , they would probably be accepted . Even readily accepted . ’
197422	197429	197431	197431	Lizzie	246	‘ I do not doubt it , ’
197440	197489	197431	197431	Lizzie	246	‘ I have sometimes had it in my thoughts to make that offer and to settle down as many men of my class do : I on the one side of a school , my wife on the other , both of us interested in the same work . ’
197490	197498	197500	197501	Lizzie Hexam	246	‘ Why have you not done so ? ’
197503	197511	197500	197501	Lizzie Hexam	246	‘ Why do you not do so ? ’
197512	197533	197534	197534	he	4871	‘ Far better that I never did ! The only one grain of comfort I have had these many weeks , ’
197574	197628	197552	197552	his	4871	‘ the only one grain of comfort I have had these many weeks is , that I never did . For if I had , and if the same spell had come upon me for my ruin , I know I should have broken that tie asunder as if it had been thread . ’
197653	197736	197644	197644	He	4871	‘ No ! It would not have been voluntary on my part , any more than it is voluntary in me to be here now . You draw me to you . If I were shut up in a strong prison , you would draw me out . I should break through the wall to come to you . If I were lying on a sick bed , you would draw me up — to stagger to your feet and fall there . ’
197781	197832	197774	197774	he	4871	‘ No man knows till the time comes , what depths are within him . To some men it never comes ; let them rest and be thankful ! To me , you brought it ; on me , you forced it ; and the bottom of this raging sea , ’
197839	197847	197774	197774	he	4871	‘ has been heaved up ever since . ’
197848	197880	197774	197774	he	4871	‘ Mr Headstone , I have heard enough . Let me stop you here . It will be better for you and better for me . Let us find my brother . ’
197881	197987	197988	197988	She	4874	‘ Not yet . It shall and must be spoken . I have been in torments ever since I stopped short of it before . You are alarmed . It is another of my miseries that I can not speak to you or speak of you without stumbling at every syllable , unless I let the check go altogether and run mad . Here is a man lighting the lamps . He will be gone directly . I entreat of you let us walk round this place again . You have no reason to look alarmed ; I can restrain myself , and I will . ’
198079	198420	198064	198064	he	4877	‘ You know what I am going to say . I love you . What other men may mean when they use that expression , I can not tell ; what I mean is , that I am under the influence of some tremendous attraction which I have resisted in vain , and which overmasters me . You could draw me to fire , you could draw me to water , you could draw me to the gallows , you could draw me to any death , you could draw me to anything I have most avoided , you could draw me to any exposure and disgrace . This and the confusion of my thoughts , so that I am fit for nothing , is what I mean by your being the ruin of me . But if you would return a favourable answer to my offer of myself in marriage , you could draw me to any good — every good — with equal force . My circumstances are quite easy , and you would want for nothing . My reputation stands quite high , and would be a shield for yours . If you saw me at my work , able to do it well and respected in it , you might even come to take a sort of pride in me;—I would try hard that you should . Whatever considerations I may have thought of against this offer , I have conquered , and I make it with all my heart . Your brother favours me to the utmost , and it is likely that we might live and work together ; anyhow , it is certain that he would have my best influence and support . I do n’t know what I could say more if I tried . I might only weaken what is ill enough said as it is . I only add that if it is any claim on you to be in earnest , I am in thorough earnest , dreadful earnest . ’
198442	198446	198064	198064	he	4877	‘ Mr Headstone — ’
198447	198490	198492	198492	she	4880	‘ Stop ! I implore you , before you answer me , to walk round this place once more . It will give you a minute ’s time to think , and me a minute ’s time to get some fortitude together . ’
198516	198520	198521	198521	he	4878	‘ Is it , ’
198532	198538	198521	198521	he	4878	‘ yes , or no ? ’
198539	198573	198652	198652	he	4878	‘ Mr Headstone , I thank you sincerely , I thank you gratefully , and hope you may find a worthy wife before long and be very happy . But it is no . ’
198574	198588	198589	198589	he	4878	‘ Is no short time necessary for reflection ; no weeks or days ? ’
198600	198604	198589	198589	he	4878	‘ None whatever . ’
198605	198623	198652	198652	he	4878	‘ Are you quite decided , and is there no chance of any change in my favour ? ’
198624	198646	198652	198652	he	4878	‘ I am quite decided , Mr Headstone , and I am bound to answer I am certain there is none . ’
198647	198650	198652	198652	he	4878	‘ Then , ’
198683	198694	198652	198652	he	4878	‘ then I hope that I may never kill him ! ’
198757	198774	198786	198786	he	4878	‘ Mr Headstone , let me go . Mr Headstone , I must call for help ! ’
198775	198785	198786	198786	he	4878	‘ It is I who should call for help , ’
198789	198801	198786	198786	he	4878	‘ you do n’t know yet how much I need it . ’
198855	198869	198839	198839	he	4878	‘ There ! You see I have recovered myself . Hear me out . ’
198948	198961	198962	198962	he	4878	‘ This time , at least , I will leave nothing unsaid , ’
198983	199007	198962	198962	he	4878	‘ this last time at least I will not be tortured with after - thoughts of a lost opportunity . Mr Eugene Wrayburn . ’
199008	199022	199023	199024	Lizzie Hexam	246	‘ Was it of him you spoke in your ungovernable rage and violence ? ’
199045	199054	199029	199029	He	4878	‘ Was it Mr Wrayburn that you threatened ? ’
199072	199093	199055	199055	He	4878	‘ You asked me to hear you out , and you will not speak . Let me find my brother . ’
199094	199102	199103	199103	Her	4883	‘ Stay ! I threatened no one . ’
199135	199140	199141	199141	he	4878	‘ Mr Eugene Wrayburn , ’
199144	199158	199141	199141	he	4878	‘ Why do you mention that name again and again , Mr Headstone ? ’
199159	199202	199210	199210	his	4878	‘ Because it is the text of the little I have left to say . Observe ! There are no threats in it . If I utter a threat , stop me , and fasten it upon me . Mr Eugene Wrayburn . ’
199223	199253	199141	199141	he	4878	‘ He haunts you . You accept favours from him . You are willing enough to listen to HIM . I know it , as well as he does . ’
199254	199267	199269	199269	Lizzie	246	‘ Mr Wrayburn has been considerate and good to me , sir , ’
199273	199288	199269	199269	Lizzie	246	‘ in connexion with the death and with the memory of my poor father . ’
199289	199310	199141	199141	he	4878	‘ No doubt . He is of course a very considerate and a very good man , Mr Eugene Wrayburn . ’
199311	199321	199323	199323	Lizzie	246	‘ He is nothing to you , I think , ’
199333	199350	199323	199323	Lizzie	246	‘ Oh yes , he is . There you mistake . He is much to me . ’
199351	199359	199141	199141	he	4878	‘ What can he be to you ? ’
199360	199372	199374	199374	Bradley	517	‘ He can be a rival to me among other things , ’
199376	199380	199382	199382	Lizzie	246	‘ Mr Headstone , ’
199389	199450	199451	199451	His	517	‘ it is cowardly in you to speak to me in this way . But it makes me able to tell you that I do not like you , and that I never have liked you from the first , and that no other living creature has anything to do with the effect you have produced upon me for yourself . ’
199475	199573	199472	199472	his	517	‘ I was going on with the little I had left to say . I knew all this about Mr Eugene Wrayburn , all the while you were drawing me to you . I strove against the knowledge , but quite in vain . It made no difference in me . With Mr Eugene Wrayburn in my mind , I went on . With Mr Eugene Wrayburn in my mind , I spoke to you just now . With Mr Eugene Wrayburn in my mind , I have been set aside and I have been cast out . ’
199574	199599	199601	199601	Lizzie	246	‘ If you give those names to my thanking you for your proposal and declining it , is it my fault , Mr Headstone ? ’
199624	199630	199631	199631	he	4886	‘ I am not complaining , ’
199634	199677	199631	199631	he	4886	‘ I am only stating the case . I had to wrestle with my self - respect when I submitted to be drawn to you in spite of Mr Wrayburn . You may imagine how low my self - respect lies now . ’
199702	199710	199712	199712	Bradley	517	‘ And it lies under his feet , ’
199735	199757	199712	199712	Bradley	517	‘ Remember that ! It lies under that fellow ’s feet , and he treads upon it and exults above it . ’
199758	199763	199765	199765	Lizzie	246	‘ He does not ! ’
199767	199771	199773	199773	Bradley	517	‘ He does ! ’
199775	199819	199765	199765	Lizzie	246	‘ I have stood before him face to face , and he crushed me down in the dirt of his contempt , and walked over me . Why ? Because he knew with triumph what was in store for me to - night . ’
199820	199831	199712	199712	Bradley	517	‘ O , Mr Headstone , you talk quite wildly . ’
199832	199877	199765	199765	Lizzie	246	‘ Quite collectedly . I know what I say too well . Now I have said all . I have used no threat , remember ; I have done no more than show you how the case stands;—how the case stands , so far . ’
199916	199984	199901	199901	Bradley	517	‘ Charley Hexam , I am going home . I must walk home by myself to - night , and get shut up in my room without being spoken to . Give me half an hour ’s start , and let me be , till you find me at my work in the morning . I shall be at my work in the morning just as usual . ’
200037	200059	200030	200030	he	1061	‘ What is the meaning of this ? What have you done to my best friend ? Out with the truth ! ’
200060	200063	200065	200066	his sister	1021	‘ Charley ! ’
200068	200075	200065	200066	his sister	1021	‘ Speak a little more considerately ! ’
200076	200093	200095	200096	the boy	1061	‘ I am not in the humour for consideration , or for nonsense of any sort , ’
200098	200116	200095	200096	the boy	1061	‘ What have you been doing ? Why has Mr Headstone gone from us in that way ? ’
200117	200135	200065	200066	his sister	1021	‘ He asked me — you know he asked me — to be his wife , Charley . ’
200136	200139	200141	200142	the boy	1061	‘ Well ? ’
200146	200162	200141	200142	the boy	1061	‘ And I was obliged to tell him that I could not be his wife . ’
200163	200171	200173	200174	the boy	1061	‘ You were obliged to tell him , ’
200187	200206	200178	200178	his	1061	‘ You were obliged to tell him ! Do you know that he is worth fifty of you ? ’
200207	200223	200141	200142	the boy	1061	‘ It may easily be so , Charley , but I can not marry him . ’
200224	200247	200141	200142	the boy	1061	‘ You mean that you are conscious that you ca n’t appreciate him , and do n’t deserve him , I suppose ? ’
200248	200268	200178	200178	his	1061	‘ I mean that I do not like him , Charley , and that I will never marry him . ’
200269	200274	200276	200277	the boy	1061	‘ Upon my soul , ’
200279	200338	200276	200277	the boy	1061	‘ you are a nice picture of a sister ! Upon my soul , you are a pretty piece of disinterestedness ! And so all my endeavours to cancel the past and to raise myself in the world , and to raise you with me , are to be beaten down by YOUR low whims ; are they ? ’
200339	200348	200178	200178	his	1061	‘ I will not reproach you , Charley . ’
200349	200353	200355	200356	the boy	1061	‘ Hear her ! ’
200364	200432	200355	200356	the boy	1061	‘ She wo n’t reproach me ! She does her best to destroy my fortunes and her own , and she wo n’t reproach me ! Why , you ’ll tell me , next , that you wo n’t reproach Mr Headstone for coming out of the sphere to which he is an ornament , and putting himself at YOUR feet , to be rejected by YOU ! ’
200433	200479	200507	200507	adviser	4907	‘ No , Charley ; I will only tell you , as I told himself , that I thank him for doing so , that I am sorry he did so , and that I hope he will do much better , and be happy . ’
200538	200570	200531	200531	he	1061	‘ Now , come , Liz ; do n’t let us quarrel : let us be reasonable and talk this over like brother and sister . Will you listen to me ? ’
200571	200576	200577	200577	she	4904	‘ Oh , Charley ! ’
200584	200598	200577	200577	she	4904	‘ do I not listen to you , and hear many hard things ! ’
200599	200755	200531	200531	he	1061	‘ Then I am sorry . There , Liz ! I am unfeignedly sorry . Only you do put me out so . Now see . Mr Headstone is perfectly devoted to you . He has told me in the strongest manner that he has never been his old self for one single minute since I first brought him to see you . Miss Peecher , our schoolmistress — pretty and young , and all that — is known to be very much attached to him , and he wo n’t so much as look at her or hear of her . Now , his devotion to you must be a disinterested one ; must n’t it ? If he married Miss Peecher , he would be a great deal better off in all worldly respects , than in marrying you . Well then ; he has nothing to get by it , has he ? ’
200756	200762	200531	200531	he	1061	‘ Nothing , Heaven knows ! ’
200763	200768	200770	200771	the boy	1061	‘ Very well then , ’
200773	200956	200770	200771	the boy	1061	‘ that ’s something in his favour , and a great thing . Then I come in . Mr Headstone has always got me on , and he has a good deal in his power , and of course if he was my brother - in - law he would n’t get me on less , but would get me on more . Mr Headstone comes and confides in me , in a very delicate way , and says , “ I hope my marrying your sister would be agreeable to you , Hexam , and useful to you ? ” I say , “ There ’s nothing in the world , Mr Headstone , that I could be better pleased with . ” Mr Headstone says , “ Then I may rely upon your intimate knowledge of me for your good word with your sister , Hexam ? ” And I say , “ Certainly , Mr Headstone , and naturally I have a good deal of influence with her . ” So I have ; have n’t I , Liz ? ’
200957	200962	201080	201082	Miss Jenny Wren	523	‘ Yes , Charley . ’
200963	201061	200770	200771	the boy	1061	‘ Well said ! Now , you see , we begin to get on , the moment we begin to be really talking it over , like brother and sister . Very well . Then YOU come in . As Mr Headstone ’s wife you would be occupying a most respectable station , and you would be holding a far better place in society than you hold now , and you would at length get quit of the river - side and the old disagreeables belonging to it , and you would be rid for good of dolls ’
201140	201210	201122	201123	Mr Headstone	517	’ They were walking slowly as the boy spoke , and here he stood still , to see what effect he had made . His sister ’s eyes were fixed upon him ; but as they showed no yielding , and as she remained silent , he walked her on again . There was some discomfiture in his tone as he resumed , though he tried to conceal it . ‘
201351	201372	201375	201375	you	246	’ He stopped again . The pale face looked anxiously and lovingly at him , but she shook her head . ‘
201378	201384	201375	201375	you	246	’ said the boy sharply . ‘
201453	201454	201441	201441	I	0	’ ‘
201459	201470	201472	201472	herself	11046	’ cried the boy , contemptuously throwing her off again , ‘
201476	201477	201472	201472	herself	11046	’ ‘
201528	201529	201522	201522	you	291	’ ‘
201532	201551	201522	201522	you	291	’ said the boy , taking no heed of the remonstrance , and pursuing his own mortified disappointment , ‘
201565	201566	201559	201559	you	291	’ ‘
201581	201582	201570	201570	I	0	’ ‘
201588	201597	201599	201599	you	291	’ said the boy in a violent tone , ‘
201618	201619	201620	201620	Charley	291	’ ‘
201634	201635	201620	201620	Charley	291	’ ‘
201643	201649	201637	201637	you	291	’ doggedly pursued the boy . ‘
201698	201699	201700	201700	Charley	291	’ ‘
201758	201759	201760	201760	I	0	’ ‘
201800	201885	201794	201794	I	0	’ He threw up his ungrateful and ungracious hand as if it set up a barrier between them , and flung himself upon his heel and left her . She remained impassive on the same spot , silent and motionless , until the striking of the church clock roused her , and she turned away . But then , with the breaking up of her immobility came the breaking up of the waters that the cold heart of the selfish boy had frozen . And ‘
201896	201898	201794	201794	I	0	’ and ‘
201917	202007	201794	201794	I	0	’ were all the words she said , as she laid her face in her hands on the stone coping . A figure passed by , and passed on , but stopped and looked round at her . It was the figure of an old man with a bowed head , wearing a large brimmed low - crowned hat , and a long - skirted coat . After hesitating a little , the figure turned back , and , advancing with an air of gentleness and compassion , said : ‘
202065	202082	202057	202057	I	0	’ She raised her head at the sound of these kind words , and answered gladly , ‘
202092	202093	202090	202090	you	563	’ ‘
202097	202103	202090	202090	you	563	’ said the old man , ‘
202138	202139	202135	202136	poor girl	4930	’ ‘
202147	202151	202140	202141	My brother	10703	’ sobbed Lizzie , ‘
202156	202157	202140	202141	My brother	10703	’ ‘
202164	202171	202158	202158	He	10703	’ said the Jew , angrily . ‘
202262	202316	202317	202317	Lizzie	246	’ She accepted the support he offered her , and they slowly passed out of the churchyard . They were in the act of emerging into the main thoroughfare , when another figure loitering discontentedly by , and looking up the street and down it , and all about , started and exclaimed , ‘
202333	202378	202379	202379	Lizzie	246	’ As Eugene Wrayburn thus addressed her , she drew closer to the Jew , and bent her head . The Jew having taken in the whole of Eugene at one sharp glance , cast his eyes upon the ground , and stood mute . ‘
202386	202387	202379	202379	Lizzie	246	’ ‘
202418	202419	202416	202416	me	0	’ ‘
202461	202465	202455	202455	I	0	’ added Eugene , ‘
202472	202479	202480	202482	an old clothesman	4941	’ with a look at Riah , ‘
202484	202503	202455	202455	I	0	’ The Jew lifted up his eyes , and took in Eugene once more , at another glance . ‘
202530	202531	202528	202528	yourself	246	’ ‘
202536	202546	202532	202534	Mysteries of Udolpho	612	’ said Eugene , with a look of wonder . ‘
202567	202568	202569	202571	A trustworthy friend	4945	’ ‘
202573	202577	202569	202571	A trustworthy friend	4945	’ said Lizzie . ‘
202586	202590	202578	202578	I	0	’ returned Eugene . ‘
202604	202605	202606	202606	Her	246	’ ‘
202612	202624	202606	202606	Her	246	’ said the old man , lifting up his eyes again . ‘
202630	202638	202639	202640	Our brother	10815	’ returned Eugene , with airy contempt . ‘
202658	202709	202654	202655	our brother	10815	’ The old man lifted up his eyes again , with one grave look at Wrayburn , and one grave glance at Lizzie , as she stood looking down . Both were so full of meaning that even Eugene was checked in his light career , and subsided into a thoughtful ‘
202712	202764	202654	202655	our brother	10815	’ With an air of perfect patience the old man , remaining mute and keeping his eyes cast down , stood , retaining Lizzie ’s arm , as though in his habit of passive endurance , it would be all one to him if he had stood there motionless all night . ‘
202769	202779	202654	202655	our brother	10815	’ said Eugene , who soon found this fatiguing , ‘
202815	202824	202810	202810	you	613	’ But the old man stood stock still . ‘
202831	202837	202828	202829	Mr Aaron	613	’ said Eugene , politely ; ‘
202844	202850	202828	202829	Mr Aaron	613	’ Then turning to Lizzie , ‘
202860	202861	202854	202855	Mr Aaron	613	’ ‘
202871	202879	202868	202869	Christian gentleman	4954	’ replied the old man , calmly ; ‘
202925	202926	202916	202916	I	0	’ ‘
202936	202946	202948	202948	me	0	’ said Eugene , quite undisturbed in his ease . ‘
202960	202966	202967	202967	I	0	’ replied the old man . ‘
202974	202975	202976	202976	I	0	’ ‘
202982	202986	202976	202976	I	0	’ said Lizzie , ‘

203054	203071	203036	203036	I	0	’ he returned , in a low voice , bending over her on the other side ; ‘
203078	203079	203036	203036	I	0	’ ‘
203091	203099	203036	203036	I	0	’ He snapped his fingers and laughed . ‘
203102	203106	203036	203036	I	0	’ said he , ‘
203151	203437	203438	203439	Mr Aaron	613	’ He knew his power over her . He knew that she would not insist upon his leaving her . He knew that , her fears for him being aroused , she would be uneasy if he were out of her sight . For all his seeming levity and carelessness , he knew whatever he chose to know of the thoughts of her heart . And going on at her side , so gaily , regardless of all that had been urged against him ; so superior in his sallies and self - possession to the gloomy constraint of her suitor and the selfish petulance of her brother ; so faithful to her , as it seemed , when her own stock was faithless ; what an immense advantage , what an overpowering influence , were his that night ! Add to the rest , poor girl , that she had heard him vilified for her sake , and that she had suffered for his , and where the wonder that his occasional tones of serious interest ( setting off his carelessness , as if it were assumed to calm her ) , that his lightest touch , his lightest look , his very presence beside her in the dark common street , were like glimpses of an enchanted world , which it was natural for jealousy and malice and all meanness to be unable to bear the brightness of , and to gird at as bad spirits might . Nothing more being said of repairing to Riah ’s , they went direct to Lizzie ’s lodging . A little short of the house - door she parted from them , and went in alone . ‘
203441	203454	203438	203439	Mr Aaron	613	’ said Eugene , when they were left together in the street , ‘
203471	203472	203473	203473	Sir	8755	’ ‘
203475	203480	203473	203473	Sir	8755	’ returned the other , ‘

203611	204037	203603	203603	We	4965	’ with a heavy sigh . The heavy sigh was repeated as if by an echo , an hour afterwards , when Riah , who had been sitting on some dark steps in a corner over against the house , arose and went his patient way ; stealing through the streets in his ancient dress , like the ghost of a departed Time . Chapter 16 AN ANNIVERSARY OCCASION The estimable Twemlow , dressing himself in his lodgings over the stable - yard in Duke Street , Saint James ’s , and hearing the horses at their toilette below , finds himself on the whole in a disadvantageous position as compared with the noble animals at livery . For whereas , on the one hand , he has no attendant to slap him soundingly and require him in gruff accents to come up and come over , still , on the other hand , he has no attendant at all ; and the mild gentleman ’s finger - joints and other joints working rustily in the morning , he could deem it agreeable even to be tied up by the countenance at his chamber - door , so he were there skilfully rubbed down and slushed and sluiced and polished and clothed , while himself taking merely a passive part in these trying transactions . How the fascinating Tippins gets on when arraying herself for the bewilderment of the senses of men , is known only to the Graces and her maid ; but perhaps even that engaging creature , though not reduced to the self - dependence of Twemlow could dispense with a good deal of the trouble attendant on the daily restoration of her charms , seeing that as to her face and neck this adorable divinity is , as it were , a diurnal species of lobster — throwing off a shell every forenoon , and needing to keep in a retired spot until the new crust hardens . Howbeit , Twemlow doth at length invest himself with collar and cravat and wristbands to his knuckles , and goeth forth to breakfast . And to breakfast with whom but his near neighbours , the Lammles of Sackville Street , who have imparted to him that he will meet his distant kinsman , Mr Fledgely . The awful Snigsworth might taboo and prohibit Fledgely , but the peaceable Twemlow reasons , If he IS my kinsman I did n’t make him so , and to meet a man is not to know him . ’
204164	204191	204159	204159	Tartar	618	‘ As he will never distinguish himself , he must be a poor gentleman - pensioner of mine , and let him hereby consider himself pensioned . ’
204368	204900	204364	204364	he	271	’ door , drives up a little one - horse carriage , containing Tippins the divine . Tippins , letting down the window , playfully extols the vigilance of her cavalier in being in waiting there to hand her out . Twemlow hands her out with as much polite gravity as if she were anything real , and they proceed upstairs . Tippins all abroad about the legs , and seeking to express that those unsteady articles are only skipping in their native buoyancy . And dear Mrs Lammle and dear Mr Lammle , how do you do , and when are you going down to what’s - its - name place — Guy , Earl of Warwick , you know — what is it?—Dun Cow — to claim the flitch of bacon ? And Mortimer , whose name is for ever blotted out from my list of lovers , by reason first of fickleness and then of base desertion , how do YOU do , wretch ? And Mr Wrayburn , YOU here ! What can YOU come for , because we are all very sure before - hand that you are not going to talk ! And Veneering , M.P. , how are things going on down at the house , and when will you turn out those terrible people for us ? And Mrs Veneering , my dear , can it positively be true that you go down to that stifling place night after night , to hear those men prose ? Talking of which , Veneering , why do n’t you prose , for you have n’t opened your lips there yet , and we are dying to hear what you have got to say to us ! Miss Podsnap , charmed to see you . Pa , here ? No ! Ma , neither ? Oh ! Mr Boots ! Delighted . Mr Brewer ! This IS a gathering of the clans . Thus Tippins , and surveys Fledgeby and outsiders through golden glass , murmuring as she turns about and about , in her innocent giddy way , Anybody else I know ? No , I think not . Nobody there . Nobody THERE . Nobody anywhere ! Mr Lammle , all a - glitter , produces his friend Fledgeby , as dying for the honour of presentation to Lady Tippins . Fledgeby presented , has the air of going to say something , has the air of going to say nothing , has an air successively of meditation , of resignation , and of desolation , backs on Brewer , makes the tour of Boots , and fades into the extreme background , feeling for his whisker , as if it might have turned up since he was there five minutes ago . But Lammle has him out again before he has so much as completely ascertained the bareness of the land . He would seem to be in a bad way , Fledgeby ; for Lammle represents him as dying again . He is dying now , of want of presentation to Twemlow . Twemlow offers his hand . Glad to see him . ‘

204918	204922	204364	204364	he	271	’ says Fledgeby , ‘

204958	205025	204954	204954	You	4975	’ says Twemlow . But is felled flat by Fledgeby ’s taking it quite ill , and replying , No , he do n’t like town . Lammle tries to break the force of the fall , by remarking that some people do not like town . Fledgeby retorting that he never heard of any such case but his own , Twemlow goes down again heavily . ‘
205036	205055	205033	205033	I	0	’ says Twemlow , returning to the mark with great spirit . Fledgeby has not heard of anything . ‘
205066	205070	205033	205033	I	0	’ says Lammle . ‘

Somehow the execution of this little concerted piece appears to raise the general spirits as with a sense of duty done , and sets the company a going . Everybody seems more equal than before , to the calamity of being in the society of everybody else . Even Eugene standing in a window , moodily swinging the tassel of a blind , gives it a smarter jerk now , as if he found himself in better case . Breakfast announced . Everything on table showy and gaudy , but with a self - assertingly temporary and nomadic air on the decorations , as boasting that they will be much more showy and gaudy in the palatial residence . Mr Lammle ’s own particular servant behind his chair ; the Analytical behind Veneering ’s chair ; instances in point that such servants fall into two classes : one mistrusting the master ’s acquaintances , and the other mistrusting the master . Mr Lammle ’s servant , of the second class . Appearing to be lost in wonder and low spirits because the police are so long in coming to take his master up on some charge of the first magnitude . Veneering , M.P. , on the right of Mrs Lammle ; Twemlow on her left ; Mrs Veneering , W.M.P. ( wife of Member of Parliament ) , and Lady Tippins on Mr Lammle ’s right and left . But be sure that well within the fascination of Mr Lammle ’s eye and smile sits little Georgiana . And be sure that close to little Georgiana , also under inspection by the same gingerous gentleman , sits Fledgeby . Oftener than twice or thrice while breakfast is in progress , Mr Twemlow gives a little sudden turn towards Mrs Lammle , and then says to her , ‘
205403	205601	205400	205400	your	4983	’ This not being Twemlow ’s usual way , why is it his way to - day ? Why , the truth is , Twemlow repeatedly labours under the impression that Mrs Lammle is going to speak to him , and turning finds that it is not so , and mostly that she has her eyes upon Veneering . Strange that this impression so abides by Twemlow after being corrected , yet so it is . Lady Tippins partaking plentifully of the fruits of the earth ( including grape - juice in the category ) becomes livelier , and applies herself to elicit sparks from Mortimer Lightwood . It is always understood among the initiated , that that faithless lover must be planted at table opposite to Lady Tippins , who will then strike conversational fire out of him . In a pause of mastication and deglutition , Lady Tippins , contemplating Mortimer , recalls that it was at our dear Veneerings , and in the presence of a party who are surely all here , that he told them his story of the man from somewhere , which afterwards became so horribly interesting and vulgarly popular . ‘

205673	205726	205650	205651	Lady Tippins	268	’ Mortimer parries thus , with a sense upon him that elsewhere it is Eugene and not he who is the jester , and that in these circles where Eugene persists in being speechless , he , Mortimer , is but the double of the friend on whom he has founded himself . ‘

205883	205941	205846	205846	I	0	’ Boots and Brewer immediately perceive that it is immensely worth mentioning , and become politely clamorous . Veneering is also visited by a perception to the same effect . But it is understood that his attention is now rather used up , and difficult to hold , that being the tone of the House of Commons . ‘

206591	206592	206587	206587	she	246	’ ‘
206595	206601	206587	206587	she	246	’ is the general echo . ‘
206604	206608	206609	206609	Nobody	8619	’ says Mortimer . ‘
206636	206758	206765	206765	he	5015	’ Tippins , with a bewitching little scream , opines that we shall every one of us be murdered in our beds . Eugene eyes her as if some of us would be enough for him . Mrs Veneering , W.M.P. , remarks that these social mysteries make one afraid of leaving Baby . Veneering , M.P. , wishes to be informed ( with something of a second - hand air of seeing the Right Honourable Gentleman at the head of the Home Department in his place ) whether it is intended to be conveyed that the vanished person has been spirited away or otherwise harmed ? Instead of Lightwood ’s answering , Eugene answers , and answers hastily and vexedly : ‘
206781	207273	207274	207274	Lammle	625	’ However , the great subject of the happiness of Mr and Mrs Lammle must not be allowed to vanish with the other vanishments — with the vanishing of the murderer , the vanishing of Julius Handford , the vanishing of Lizzie Hexam,—and therefore Veneering must recall the present sheep to the pen from which they have strayed . Who so fit to discourse of the happiness of Mr and Mrs Lammle , they being the dearest and oldest friends he has in the world ; or what audience so fit for him to take into his confidence as that audience , a noun of multitude or signifying many , who are all the oldest and dearest friends he has in the world ? So Veneering , without the formality of rising , launches into a familiar oration , gradually toning into the Parliamentary sing - song , in which he sees at that board his dear friend Twemlow who on that day twelvemonth bestowed on his dear friend Lammle the fair hand of his dear friend Sophronia , and in which he also sees at that board his dear friends Boots and Brewer whose rallying round him at a period when his dear friend Lady Tippins likewise rallied round him — ay , and in the foremost rank — he can never forget while memory holds her seat . But he is free to confess that he misses from that board his dear old friend Podsnap , though he is well represented by his dear young friend Georgiana . And he further sees at that board ( this he announces with pomp , as if exulting in the powers of an extraordinary telescope ) his friend Mr Fledgeby , if he will permit him to call him so . For all of these reasons , and many more which he right well knows will have occurred to persons of your exceptional acuteness , he is here to submit to you that the time has arrived when , with our hearts in our glasses , with tears in our eyes , with blessings on our lips , and in a general way with a profusion of gammon and spinach in our emotional larders , we should one and all drink to our dear friends the Lammles , wishing them many years as happy as the last , and many many friends as congenially united as themselves . And this he will add ; that Anastatia Veneering ( who is instantly heard to weep ) is formed on the same model as her old and chosen friend Sophronia Lammle , in respect that she is devoted to the man who wooed and won her , and nobly discharges the duties of a wife . Seeing no better way out of it , Veneering here pulls up his oratorical Pegasus extremely short , and plumps down , clean over his head , with : ‘
207280	207408	207274	207274	Lammle	625	’ Then Lammle . Too much of him every way ; pervadingly too much nose of a coarse wrong shape , and his nose in his mind and his manners ; too much smile to be real ; too much frown to be false ; too many large teeth to be visible at once without suggesting a bite . He thanks you , dear friends , for your kindly greeting , and hopes to receive you — it may be on the next of these delightful occasions — in a residence better suited to your claims on the rites of hospitality . He will never forget that at Veneering ’s he first saw Sophronia . Sophronia will never forget that at Veneering ’s she first saw him . ‘
207449	207758	207759	207760	Mr Twemlow	271	‘ No , no , from Veneering)—oh yes , yes , and let him rely upon it , they will if they can ! His marriage with Sophronia was not a marriage of interest on either side : she had her little fortune , he had his little fortune : they joined their little fortunes : it was a marriage of pure inclination and suitability . Thank you ! Sophronia and he are fond of the society of young people ; but he is not sure that their house would be a good house for young people proposing to remain single , since the contemplation of its domestic bliss might induce them to change their minds . He will not apply this to any one present ; certainly not to their darling little Georgiana . Again thank you ! Neither , by - the - by , will he apply it to his friend Fledgeby . He thanks Veneering for the feeling manner in which he referred to their common friend Fledgeby , for he holds that gentleman in the highest estimation . Thank you . In fact ( returning unexpectedly to Fledgeby ) , the better you know him , the more you find in him that you desire to know . Again thank you ! In his dear Sophronia ’s name and in his own , thank you ! Mrs Lammle has sat quite still , with her eyes cast down upon the table - cloth . As Mr Lammle ’s address ends , Twemlow once more turns to her involuntarily , not cured yet of that often recurring impression that she is going to speak to him . This time she really is going to speak to him . Veneering is talking with his other next neighbour , and she speaks in a low voice . ‘
207762	207766	207759	207760	Mr Twemlow	271	’ He answers , ‘
207774	207788	207789	207789	You	271	’ Still a little doubtful , because of her not looking at him . ‘
207824	207825	207806	207806	you	271	’ ‘

207868	208077	208078	208078	You	5019	’ Intensely astonished , Twemlow puts his hand to his forehead , and sinks back in his chair meditating . Mrs Lammle rises . All rise . The ladies go up stairs . The gentlemen soon saunter after them . Fledgeby has devoted the interval to taking an observation of Boots ’s whiskers , Brewer ’s whiskers , and Lammle ’s whiskers , and considering which pattern of whisker he would prefer to produce out of himself by friction , if the Genie of the cheek would only answer to his rubbing . In the drawing - room , groups form as usual . Lightwood , Boots , and Brewer , flutter like moths around that yellow wax candle — guttering down , and with some hint of a winding - sheet in it — Lady Tippins . Outsiders cultivate Veneering , M P. , and Mrs Veneering , W.M.P. Lammle stands with folded arms , Mephistophelean in a corner , with Georgiana and Fledgeby . Mrs Lammle , on a sofa by a table , invites Mr Twemlow ’s attention to a book of portraits in her hand . Mr Twemlow takes his station on a settee before her , and Mrs Lammle shows him a portrait . ‘
208085	208090	208078	208078	You	5019	’ she says softly , ‘
208100	208117	208094	208094	you	5019	’ Disturbed Twemlow , making an effort not to look so , looks much more so . ‘

For the moment , Mrs Lammle does not turn to them , but remains looking at Twemlow looking at Alfred ’s portrait through his eyeglass . The moment past , Twemlow drops his eyeglass at its ribbon ’s length , rises , and closes the book with an emphasis which makes that fragile nursling of the fairies , Tippins , start . Then good - bye and good - bye , and charming occasion worthy of the Golden Age , and more about the flitch of bacon , and the like of that ; and Twemlow goes staggering across Piccadilly with his hand to his forehead , and is nearly run down by a flushed lettercart , and at last drops safe in his easy - chair , innocent good gentleman , with his hand to his forehead still , and his head in a whirl . BOOK THE THIRD — A LONG LANE Chapter 1 LODGERS IN QUEER STREET It was a foggy day in London , and the fog was heavy and dark . Animate London , with smarting eyes and irritated lungs , was blinking , wheezing , and choking ; inanimate London was a sooty spectre , divided in purpose between being visible and invisible , and so being wholly neither . Gaslights flared in the shops with a haggard and unblest air , as knowing themselves to be night - creatures that had no business abroad under the sun ; while the sun itself when it was for a few moments dimly indicated through circling eddies of fog , showed as if it had gone out and were collapsing flat and cold . Even in the surrounding country it was a foggy day , but there the fog was grey , whereas in London it was , at about the boundary line , dark yellow , and a little within it brown , and then browner , and then browner , until at the heart of the City — which call Saint Mary Axe — it was rusty - black . From any point of the high ridge of land northward , it might have been discerned that the loftiest buildings made an occasional struggle to get their heads above the foggy sea , and especially that the great dome of Saint Paul ’s seemed to die hard ; but this was not perceivable in the streets at their feet , where the whole metropolis was a heap of vapour charged with muffled sound of wheels , and enfolding a gigantic catarrh . At nine o’clock on such a morning , the place of business of Pubsey and Co. was not the liveliest object even in Saint Mary Axe — which is not a very lively spot — with a sobbing gaslight in the counting - house window , and a burglarious stream of fog creeping in to strangle it through the keyhole of the main door . But the light went out , and the main door opened , and Riah came forth with a bag under his arm . Almost in the act of coming out at the door , Riah went into the fog , and was lost to the eyes of Saint Mary Axe . But the eyes of this history can follow him westward , by Cornhill , Cheapside , Fleet Street , and the Strand , to Piccadilly and the Albany . Thither he went at his grave and measured pace , staff in hand , skirt at heel ; and more than one head , turning to look back at his venerable figure already lost in the mist , supposed it to be some ordinary figure indistinctly seen , which fancy and the fog had worked into that passing likeness . Arrived at the house in which his master ’s chambers were on the second floor , Riah proceeded up the stairs , and paused at Fascination Fledgeby ’s door . Making free with neither bell nor knocker , he struck upon the door with the top of his staff , and , having listened , sat down on the threshold . It was characteristic of his habitual submission , that he sat down on the raw dark staircase , as many of his ancestors had probably sat down in dungeons , taking what befell him as it might befall . After a time , when he had grown so cold as to be fain to blow upon his fingers , he arose and knocked with his staff again , and listened again , and again sat down to wait . Thrice he repeated these actions before his listening ears were greeted by the voice of Fledgeby , calling from his bed , ‘
210138	210222	209293	209294	Mr Twemlow	271	’ But , in lieu of coming directly , he fell into a sweet sleep for some quarter of an hour more , during which added interval Riah sat upon the stairs and waited with perfect patience . At length the door stood open , and Mr Fledgeby ’s retreating drapery plunged into bed again . Following it at a respectful distance , Riah passed into the bed - chamber , where a fire had been sometime lighted , and was burning briskly . ‘
210236	210262	210263	210263	Sir	8755	’ inquired Fledgeby , turning away beneath the clothes , and presenting a comfortable rampart of shoulder to the chilled figure of the old man . ‘
210276	210277	210263	210263	Sir	8755	’ ‘
210290	210291	210295	210295	sir	8755	’ ‘
210297	210298	210295	210295	sir	8755	’ ‘
210304	210305	210295	210295	sir	8755	’ ‘
210310	210359	210295	210295	sir	8755	’ said Riah , drawing out a handkerchief , and wiping the moisture from his beard and long grey hair as he stood on the verge of the rug , with his eyes on the acceptable fire . With a plunge of enjoyment , Fledgeby settled himself afresh . ‘
210375	210379	210382	210382	sir	8755	’ he asked . ‘
210399	210400	210401	210401	You	5048	’ ‘
210408	210427	210401	210401	You	5048	’ returned Fledgeby , disappointed in his desire to heighten the contrast between his bed and the streets . ‘
210430	210441	210429	210429	you	5048	’re always bragging about something . Got the books there ? ’
210442	210449	210429	210429	you	5048	‘ They are here , sir . ’
210450	210473	210429	210429	you	5048	‘ All right . I ’ll turn the general subject over in my mind for a minute or two , and while I ’m
210487	210619	210476	210476	you	5048	’ With another comfortable plunge , Mr Fledgeby fell asleep again . The old man , having obeyed his directions , sat down on the edge of a chair , and , folding his hands before him , gradually yielded to the influence of the warmth , and dozed . He was roused by Mr Fledgeby ’s appearing erect at the foot of the bed , in Turkish slippers , rose - coloured Turkish trousers ( got cheap from somebody who had cheated some other somebody out of them ) , and a gown and cap to correspond . In that costume he would have left nothing to be desired , if he had been further fitted out with a bottomless chair , a lantern , and a bunch of matches . ‘
210623	210626	210628	210628	Fascination	543	’ un ! ’
210635	210667	210628	210628	Fascination	543	‘ what dodgery are you up to next , sitting there with your eyes shut ? You ai n’t asleep . Catch a weasel at it , and catch a Jew ! ’
210668	210678	210680	210682	the old man	1902	‘ Truly , sir , I fear I nodded , ’
210684	210688	210680	210682	the old man	1902	‘ Not you ! ’
210697	210744	210680	210682	the old man	1902	‘ A telling move with a good many , I dare say , but it wo n’t put ME off my guard . Not a bad notion though , if you want to look indifferent in driving a bargain . Oh , you are a dodger ! ’
210827	210830	210832	210832	Fledgeby	543	‘ Now ! ’
210834	210865	210832	210832	Fledgeby	543	‘ Fork out your balance in hand , and prove by figures how you make it out that it ai n’t more . First of all , light that candle . ’
210913	210917	210918	210918	he	543	‘ I suppose , ’
210929	210964	210918	210918	he	543	‘ you have n’t been lightening any of these ; but it ’s a trade of your people ’s , you know . YOU understand what sweating a pound means , do n’t you ? ’
210965	210973	210975	210977	the old man	1902	‘ Much as you do , sir , ’
211005	211015	210991	210991	he	1902	‘ May I take the liberty to say something ? ’
211016	211020	211021	211021	Fledgeby	543	‘ You may , ’
211025	211067	211021	211021	Fledgeby	543	‘ Do you not , sir — without intending it — of a surety without intending it — sometimes mingle the character I fairly earn in your employment , with the character which it is your policy that I should bear ? ’
211068	211089	211090	211090	Fascination	543	‘ I do n’t find it worth my while to cut things so fine as to go into the inquiry , ’
211094	211099	211090	211090	Fascination	543	‘ Not in justice ? ’
211100	211104	211106	211106	Fledgeby	543	‘ Bother justice ! ’
211108	211113	211106	211106	Fledgeby	543	‘ Not in generosity ? ’
211114	211119	211121	211121	Fledgeby	543	‘ Jews and generosity ! ’
211123	211142	211121	211121	Fledgeby	543	‘ That ’s a good connexion ! Bring out your vouchers , and do n’t talk Jerusalem palaver . ’
211186	211189	211191	211191	Fledgeby	543	‘ Next , ’
211193	211235	211191	211191	Fledgeby	543	‘ concerning that bill - broking branch of the business ; the branch I like best . What queer bills are to be bought , and at what prices ? You have got your list of what ’s in the market ? ’
211236	211243	211245	211245	Riah	563	‘ Sir , a long list , ’
211278	211281	211286	211286	he	543	‘ Whew ! ’
211293	211316	211286	211286	he	543	‘ Queer Street is full of lodgers just at present ! These are to be disposed of in parcels ; are they ? ’
211317	211324	211326	211328	the old man	1902	‘ In parcels as set forth , ’
211337	211342	211326	211328	the old man	1902	‘ or the lump . ’
211343	211357	211359	211359	Fledgeby	543	‘ Half the lump will be waste - paper , one knows beforehand , ’
211361	211377	211359	211359	Fledgeby	543	‘ Can you get it at waste - paper price ? That ’s the question . ’
211546	211559	211561	211561	Fledgeby	548	‘ Hark ! That ’s your doing , you Pump of Israel , ’
211563	211571	211561	211561	Fledgeby	548	‘ you ca n’t have shut it . ’
211589	211597	211583	211585	Mr Alfred Lammle	437	‘ Are you anywhere here , Fledgeby ? ’
211622	211627	211583	211585	Mr Alfred Lammle	437	‘ Here I am ! ’
211634	211638	211640	211640	Fledgeby	548	‘ Come in ! ’
211642	211719	211640	211640	Fledgeby	548	‘ This gentleman is only Pubsey and Co. of Saint Mary Axe , that I am trying to make terms for an unfortunate friend with in a matter of some dishonoured bills . But really Pubsey and Co. are so strict with their debtors , and so hard to move , that I seem to be wasting my time . Ca n’t I make ANY terms with you on my friend ’s part , Mr Riah ? ’
211720	211731	211733	211734	the Jew	3774	‘ I am but the representative of another , sir , ’

Saint Mary Axe , or of somebody : which is far from our intention . Mr Riah , if you would have the kindness to step into the next room for a few moments while I speak with Mr Lammle here , I should like to try to make terms with you once again before you go . ’
212142	212145	212147	212147	Fledgeby	548	‘ Halloa ! ’
212149	212155	212147	212147	Fledgeby	548	‘ There ’s something wrong ! ’

212167	212173	212175	212175	Fledgeby	548	‘ Because you show it , ’

212191	212203	212189	212189	Lammle	437	‘ there IS something wrong ; the whole thing ’s wrong . ’
212204	212208	212210	212210	Fascination	543	‘ I say ! ’
212236	212243	212245	212245	Lammle	437	‘ I tell you , Fledgeby , ’

212287	212297	212298	212298	Fledgeby	543	‘ THE game . OUR game . Read that . ’
212311	212392	212298	212298	Fledgeby	543	‘ Alfred Lammle , Esquire . Sir : Allow Mrs Podsnap and myself to express our united sense of the polite attentions of Mrs Alfred Lammle and yourself towards our daughter , Georgiana . Allow us also , wholly to reject them for the future , and to communicate our final desire that the two families may become entire strangers . I have the honour to be , Sir , your most obedient and very humble servant , JOHN PODSNAP . ’
212433	212439	212441	212441	Fledgeby	543	‘ Whose doing is this ? ’
212443	212448	212450	212450	Lammle	423	‘ Impossible to imagine , ’
212452	212455	212450	212450	Lammle	423	‘ Perhaps , ’
212467	212477	212457	212457	Fledgeby	543	‘ somebody has been giving you a bad character . ’

212554	212598	212552	212552	Fledgeby	543	‘ This wo n’t improve with talking about . If we ever find out who did it , we ’ll mark that person . There ’s nothing more to be said , except that you undertook to do what circumstances prevent your doing . ’
212599	212625	212627	212627	Lammle	423	‘ And that you undertook to do what you might have done by this time , if you had made a prompter use of circumstances , ’

212646	212652	212636	212636	Fledgeby	543	‘ is matter of opinion . ’

212835	212955	212828	212829	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ And if we ever find out who did this , we ’ll mark that person . And in the most friendly manner , let me mention one thing more . I do n’t know what your circumstances are , and I do n’t ask . You have sustained a loss here . Many men are liable to be involved at times , and you may be , or you may not be . But whatever you do , Lammle , don’t — don’t — don’t , I beg of you — ever fall into the hands of Pubsey and Co. in the next room , for they are grinders . Regular flayers and grinders , my dear Lammle , ’
212963	213022	212957	212957	Fledgeby	543	‘ and they ’ll skin you by the inch , from the nape of your neck to the sole of your foot , and grind every inch of your skin to tooth - powder . You have seen what Mr Riah is . Never fall into his hands , Lammle , I beg of you as a friend ! ’
213053	213066	213068	213070	the candid Fledgeby	543	‘ To confess the fact , I was made a little uneasy , ’
213072	213156	213068	213070	the candid Fledgeby	543	‘ by the manner in which that Jew looked at you when he heard your name . I did n’t like his eye . But it may have been the heated fancy of a friend . Of course if you are sure that you have no personal security out , which you may not be quite equal to meeting , and which can have got into his hands , it must have been fancy . Still , I did n’t like his eye . ’
213211	213222	213224	213224	Fledgeby	543	‘ But I must n’t keep him waiting too long , ’
213226	213253	213224	213224	Fledgeby	543	‘ or he ’ll revenge it on my unfortunate friend . How ’s your very clever and agreeable wife ? She knows we have broken down ? ’
213254	213261	213183	213183	Fledgeby	543	‘ I showed her the letter . ’
213262	213267	213269	213269	Fledgeby	543	‘ Very much surprised ? ’
213271	213281	213283	213283	Lammle	437	‘ I think she would have been more so , ’
213285	213295	213283	213283	Lammle	437	‘ if there had been more go in YOU ? ’
213296	213305	213183	213183	Fledgeby	543	‘ Oh!—She lays it upon me , then ? ’
213306	213318	213183	213183	Fledgeby	543	‘ Mr Fledgeby , I will not have my words misconstrued . ’
213319	213327	213329	213329	Fledgeby	543	‘ Do n’t break out , Lammle , ’
213336	213363	213329	213329	Fledgeby	543	‘ because there ’s no occasion . I only asked a question . Then she do n’t lay it upon me ? To ask another question . ’
213364	213369	213183	213183	Fledgeby	543	‘ No , sir . ’
213370	213374	213376	213376	Fledgeby	543	‘ Very good , ’

213473	213534	213471	213471	Fledgeby	543	‘ and which money ca n’t produce ; you are boastful of your manners and your conversation ; you wanted to pull my nose , and you have let me in for a failure , and your wife says I am the cause of it . I ’ll bowl you down . I will , though I have no whiskers , ’

214006	214030	214032	214032	Fledgeby	548	‘ Is she in your garden up atop of that house — gone up to be dead , or whatever the game is ? ’
214034	214039	214032	214032	Fledgeby	548	‘ No , sir . ’
214040	214046	214047	214047	Riah	563	‘ Where is she then ? ’
214085	214088	214090	214090	Fledgeby	548	‘ Come ! ’
214092	214123	214124	214126	The old man	1902	‘ I wo n’t press that just now . But I want to know this , and I will know this , mind you . What are you up to ? ’
214155	214164	214166	214166	Fledgeby	548	‘ You ca n’t be a gallivanting dodger , ’
214168	214171	214166	214166	Fledgeby	548	‘ For you ’re
214199	214206	214227	214227	sir	8755	’re one of the Patriarchs ; you ’re

214229	214233	214227	214227	sir	8755	’ expostulated Riah . ‘
214242	214243	214240	214240	sir	8755	’ ‘
214247	214259	214227	214227	sir	8755	’ retorted Fledgeby , with some slight tinge of a blush , ‘

214308	214309	214290	214290	your	8755	’ ‘
214313	214322	214290	214290	your	8755	’ cried Fledgeby , with a mocking lip . ‘
214332	214333	214339	214339	sir	8755	’ ‘
214341	214351	214339	214339	sir	8755	’ the other still stipulated , with respectful firmness . ‘
214359	214415	214339	214339	sir	8755	’ said Fledgeby . The old man , never bidden to sit down , stood with an earnest hand laid on the back of the young man ’s easy chair . The young man sat looking at the fire with a face of listening curiosity , ready to check him off and catch him tripping . ‘
214419	214423	214339	214339	sir	8755	’ said Fledgeby . ‘
214429	214430	214431	214431	Sir	8755	’ ‘
214443	214469	214433	214433	I	0	’ Mr Fledgeby could only express the feelings to which this incredible statement gave rise in his breast , by a prodigiously long derisive sniff . ‘
214503	214508	214510	214510	you	8755	’ said the Jew . ‘
214512	214518	214510	214510	you	8755	’ said Fledgeby , distrustfully . ‘
214527	214528	214522	214522	you	8755	’ ‘
214586	214587	214588	214588	She	4955	’ ‘

214775	214783	214784	214784	I	0	’ asked Fledgeby , feeling his cheek . ‘
214788	214794	214784	214784	I	0	’ said the old man , ‘
214799	214819	214784	214784	I	0	’ with a grave smooth outward sweep from one another of his two open hands at arm ’s length ; ‘
214851	214870	214904	214904	you	0	’ Fledgeby ’s eyes had come from the fire to notice the action of his hands when he said ‘
214875	214896	214904	214904	you	0	’ Fledgeby now tried ( very unsuccessfully ) to imitate that action , as he shook his head and said , ‘
214912	214967	214968	214968	Lizzie	246	’ With one hand across his breast and the other on the easy chair , Riah , without justifying himself , waited for further questioning . But , that it was hopeless to question him on that one reserved point , Fledgeby , with his small eyes too near together , saw full well . ‘
214970	214985	214968	214968	Lizzie	246	’ said Fledgeby , looking at the fire again , and then looking up . ‘
215020	215028	215006	215006	I	0	’ Riah bent his head in assent . ‘
215035	215039	215032	215032	you	0	’ said Fledgeby . ‘
215065	215066	215067	215067	Nominally	634	’ ‘

215100	215103	215105	215105	Fledgeby	548	’ un , ’
215114	215119	215105	215105	Fledgeby	548	‘ say the name . ’
215120	215123	215099	215101	old ’ un	12474	‘ Wrayburn . ’
215124	215128	215130	215130	Fledgeby	548	‘ By Jupiter ! ’
215132	215204	215130	215130	Fledgeby	548	‘ That one , is it ? I thought it might be the other , but I never dreamt of that one ! I should n’t object to your baulking either of the pair , dodger , for they are both conceited enough ; but that one is as cool a customer as ever I met with . Got a beard besides , and presumes upon it . Well done , old ’
215212	215228	215105	215105	Fledgeby	548	’ Brightened by this unexpected commendation , Riah asked were there more instructions for him ? ‘
215231	215235	215105	215105	Fledgeby	548	’ said Fledgeby , ‘
215253	215317	215320	215320	you	2859	’ Dismissed with those pleasing words , the old man took his broad hat and staff , and left the great presence : more as if he were some superior creature benignantly blessing Mr Fledgeby , than the poor dependent on whom he set his foot . Left alone , Mr Fledgeby locked his outer door , and came back to his fire . ‘
215322	215328	215320	215320	you	2859	’ said Fascination to himself . ‘
215340	215366	215337	215337	you	2859	’ This he twice or thrice repeated with much complacency , as he again dispersed the legs of the Turkish trousers and bent the knees . ‘
215376	215381	215372	215372	I	0	’ he then soliloquised . ‘
215424	215460	215461	215461	I	0	’ Herein he was quite accurate ; it being his habit , not to jump , or leap , or make an upward spring , at anything in life , but to crawl at everything . ‘
215466	215475	215461	215461	I	0	’ pursued Fledgeby , feeling for his whisker , ‘
215565	215581	215556	215557	a Jew	3795	’ Another dry twist in place of a smile , made his face crooked here . ‘
215586	215590	215594	215596	fellow - Christians	5124	’ proceeded Fledgeby , ‘
215673	215885	215896	215896	her	523	’ With this apostrophe Mr Fledgeby appropriately proceeded to divest himself of his Turkish garments , and invest himself with Christian attire . Pending which operation , and his morning ablutions , and his anointing of himself with the last infallible preparation for the production of luxuriant and glossy hair upon the human countenance ( quacks being the only sages he believed in besides usurers ) , the murky fog closed about him and shut him up in its sooty embrace . If it had never let him out any more , the world would have had no irreparable loss , but could have easily replaced him from its stock on hand . Chapter 2 A RESPECTED FRIEND IN A NEW ASPECT In the evening of this same foggy day when the yellow window - blind of Pubsey and Co. was drawn down upon the day ’s work , Riah the Jew once more came forth into Saint Mary Axe . But this time he carried no bag , and was not bound on his master ’s affairs . He passed over London Bridge , and returned to the Middlesex shore by that of Westminster , and so , ever wading through the fog , waded to the doorstep of the dolls ’
215973	215979	215981	215983	Miss Jenny Wren	523	‘ Good evening , godmother ! ’
215999	216011	216013	216015	Miss Jenny Wren	523	‘ Wo n’t you come in and warm yourself , godmother ? ’
216017	216029	216013	216015	Miss Jenny Wren	523	‘ Not if you are ready , Cinderella , my dear . ’
216030	216033	216035	216036	Miss Wren	523	‘ Well ! ’
216040	216079	216081	216081	she	523	‘ Now you ARE a clever old boy ! If we gave prizes at this establishment ( but we only keep blanks ) , you should have the first silver medal , for taking me up so quick . ’
216173	216186	216188	216189	Miss Wren	523	‘ No , no , no ! I ’ll carry it myself , ’
216191	216193	216188	216189	Miss Wren	523	‘ I ’m
216231	216234	216221	216221	I	0	’ purpose . ’
216245	216257	216259	216260	Miss Wren	523	‘ Yes , it was truly sharp of you , godmother , ’
216265	216321	216323	216324	Miss Jenny	523	‘ to understand me . But , you see , you ARE so like the fairy godmother in the bright little books ! You look so unlike the rest of people , and so much as if you had changed yourself into that shape , just this moment , with some benevolent object . Boh ! ’
216336	216349	216323	216324	Miss Jenny	523	‘ I can see your features , godmother , behind the beard . ’
216350	216364	216327	216327	her	523	‘ Does the fancy go to my changing other objects too , Jenny ? ’
216365	216411	216323	216324	Miss Jenny	523	‘ Ah ! That it does ! If you ’d only borrow my stick and tap this piece of pavement — this dirty stone that my foot taps — it would start up a coach and six . I say ! Let ’s believe so ! ’
216412	216418	216420	216423	the good old man	5132	‘ With all my heart , ’
216425	216520	216420	216423	the good old man	5132	‘ And I ’ll tell you what I must ask you to do , godmother . I must ask you to be so kind as give my child a tap , and change him altogether . O my child has been such a bad , bad child of late ! It worries me nearly out of my wits . Not done a stroke of work these ten days . Has had the horrors , too , and fancied that four copper - coloured men in red wanted to throw him into a fiery furnace . ’
216521	216529	216323	216324	Miss Jenny	523	‘ But that ’s dangerous , Jenny . ’
216530	216636	216323	216324	Miss Jenny	523	‘ Dangerous , godmother ? My child is always dangerous , more or less . He might’—here the little creature glanced back over her shoulder at the sky—‘be setting the house on fire at this present moment . I do n’t know who would have a child , for my part ! It ’s no use shaking him . I have shaken him till I have made myself giddy . “ Why do n’t you mind your Commandments and honour your parent , you naughty old boy ? ” I said to him all the time . But he only whimpered and stared at me . ’
216637	216646	216648	216648	Riah	565	‘ What shall be changed , after him ? ’
216655	216710	216648	216648	Riah	565	‘ Upon my word , godmother , I am afraid I must be selfish next , and get you to set me right in the back and the legs . It ’s a little thing to you with your power , godmother , but it ’s a great deal to poor weak aching me . ’
216730	216734	216323	216324	Miss Jenny	523	‘ And then ? ’
216735	216819	216648	216648	Riah	565	‘ Yes , and then — YOU know , godmother . We ’ll both jump up into the coach and six and go to Lizzie . This reminds me , godmother , to ask you a serious question . You are as wise as wise can be ( having been brought up by the fairies ) , and you can tell me this : Is it better to have had a good thing and lost it , or never to have had it ? ’
216820	216827	216323	216324	Miss Jenny	523	‘ Explain , god - daughter . ’
216828	216851	216859	216859	she	5133	‘ I feel so much more solitary and helpless without Lizzie now , than I used to feel before I knew her . ’
216864	216877	216879	216883	the Jew,—‘that of a wife	5134	‘ Some beloved companionship fades out of most lives , my dear , ’
216909	216910	216879	216883	the Jew,—‘that of a wife	5134	’ ‘
216913	216936	216879	216883	the Jew,—‘that of a wife	5134	’ said Miss Wren thoughtfully , by no means convinced , and chopping the exclamation with that sharp little hatchet of hers ; ‘
216970	216971	216953	216953	You	5138	’ ‘
216987	216994	216953	216953	You	5138	’ asked the old man tenderly . ‘
216997	217005	216953	216953	You	5138	’ exclaimed Miss Wren with another chop . ‘
217014	217027	216953	216953	You	5138	’ she added with the quaint hitch of her chin and eyes , ‘
217041	217123	217029	217029	you	0	’ Thus conversing , and having crossed Westminster Bridge , they traversed the ground that Riah had lately traversed , and new ground likewise ; for , when they had recrossed the Thames by way of London Bridge , they struck down by the river and held their still foggier course that way . But previously , as they were going along , Jenny twisted her venerable friend aside to a brilliantly - lighted toy - shop window , and said : ‘
217127	217133	216953	216953	You	5138	’em ! All my work ! ’
217203	217210	217212	217214	the old man	1902	‘ Pretty , pretty , pretty ! ’
217222	217227	217219	217219	his	1902	‘ Most elegant taste ! ’
217228	217232	217219	217219	his	1902	‘ Glad you like ’em
217234	217241	217219	217219	his	1902	’ returned Miss Wren , loftily . ‘
217286	217298	217302	217302	godmother	12562	’ He looked at her as not understanding what she said . ‘
217304	217309	217300	217300	you	12562	’ said Miss Wren , ‘
217359	217360	217349	217357	the great ladies that takes it out of me	5147	’ ‘
217368	217372	217349	217357	the great ladies that takes it out of me	5147	’ asked Riah . ‘
217383	217388	217425	217426	the crowd	5151	’ returned Miss Wren . ‘
217506	217514	217500	217500	she	5152	‘ How that little creature is staring ! ’
217629	217688	217697	217699	Lady Belinda Whitrose	638	’em , just the same . When they go bobbing into the hall from the carriage , and catch a glimpse of my little physiognomy poked out from behind a policeman ’s cape in the rain , I dare say they think I am wondering and admiring with all my eyes and heart , but they little think they ’re
217826	217974	217802	217803	Lady Belinda	638	’ When they had plodded on for some time nigh the river , Riah asked the way to a certain tavern called the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters . Following the directions he received , they arrived , after two or three puzzled stoppages for consideration , and some uncertain looking about them , at the door of Miss Abbey Potterson ’s dominions . A peep through the glass portion of the door revealed to them the glories of the bar , and Miss Abbey herself seated in state on her snug throne , reading the newspaper . To whom , with deference , they presented themselves . Taking her eyes off her newspaper , and pausing with a suspended expression of countenance , as if she must finish the paragraph in hand before undertaking any other business whatever , Miss Abbey demanded , with some slight asperity : ‘
217983	217984	217802	217803	Lady Belinda	638	’ ‘
217991	218001	217988	217989	Miss Potterson	357	’ asked the old man , uncovering his head . ‘
218014	218019	218011	218011	you	5164	’ replied the hostess . ‘
218028	218117	218026	218026	madam	5021	’ By this time Miss Abbey ’s eyes had possessed themselves of the small figure of Miss Jenny Wren . For the closer observation of which , Miss Abbey laid aside her newspaper , rose , and looked over the half - door of the bar . The crutch - stick seemed to entreat for its owner leave to come in and rest by the fire ; so , Miss Abbey opened the half - door , and said , as though replying to the crutch - stick : ‘
218128	218129	218026	218026	madam	5021	’ ‘
218135	218145	218133	218133	Riah	565	’ said the old man , with courteous action , ‘
218160	218161	218156	218158	my young companion	5168	’ ‘
218166	218171	218156	218158	my young companion	5168	’ interposed Miss Wren . ‘
218180	218239	218175	218176	the lady	2213	’ She produced it from her pocket with an air , after struggling with the gigantic door - key which had got upon the top of it and kept it down . Miss Abbey , with manifest tokens of astonishment , took the diminutive document , and found it to run concisely thus : — MISS JENNY WREN DOLLS ’
218249	218252	218254	218255	Miss Potterson	357	‘ Lud ! ’
218264	218280	218282	218282	Riah	565	‘ We take the liberty of coming , my young companion and I , madam , ’
218284	218291	218282	218282	Riah	565	‘ on behalf of Lizzie Hexam . ’
218305	218317	218292	218293	Miss Potterson	357	’ dressmaker . She looked round rather angrily , and said : ‘
218327	218328	218321	218325	a very proud young woman	5172	’ ‘
218335	218341	218321	218325	a very proud young woman	5172	’ returned Riah , dexterously , ‘
218357	218358	218352	218352	she	246	’ ‘
218372	218385	218352	218352	she	246	’ asked Miss Potterson , as though supposing her to have emigrated . ‘
218390	218466	218467	218467	he	5175	’ was the cautious answer,—‘she made us promise to come and show you a paper , which she left in our hands for that special purpose . I am an unserviceable friend of hers , who began to know her after her departure from this neighbourhood . She has been for some time living with my young companion , and has been a helpful and a comfortable friend to her . Much needed , madam , ’
218475	218487	218467	218467	he	5175	‘ Believe me ; if you knew all , much needed . ’
218488	218494	218496	218497	Miss Abbey	357	‘ I can believe that , ’
218508	218536	218496	218497	Miss Abbey	357	‘ And if it ’s proud to have a heart that never hardens , and a temper that never tires , and a touch that never hurts , ’
218544	218559	218537	218538	Miss Jenny	523	‘ she is proud . And if it ’s not , she is NOT . ’
218586	218593	218595	218596	Miss Abbey	357	‘ You do right , child , ’
218598	218610	218595	218596	Miss Abbey	357	‘ to speak well of those who deserve well of you . ’
218611	218616	218618	218619	Miss Wren	523	‘ Right or wrong , ’
218631	218651	218618	218619	Miss Wren	523	‘ I mean to do it , and you may make up your mind to THAT , old lady . ’
218652	218660	218662	218663	the Jew	3774	‘ Here is the paper , madam , ’
218684	218692	218682	218682	Riderhood	360	‘ Will you please to read it ? ’
218693	218699	218701	218702	Miss Abbey	357	‘ But first of all , ’
218704	218714	218701	218702	Miss Abbey	357	‘ — did you ever taste shrub , child ? ’
218721	218727	218718	218718	her	523	‘ Should you like to ? ’
218728	218735	218737	218738	Miss Wren	523	‘ Should if it ’s good , ’

I have my doubts whether he is not the villain who solely did the deed ; but I have no expectation of those doubts ever being cleared up now . I believe I did Lizzie ’s father wrong , but never Lizzie ’s self ; because when things were at the worst I trusted her , had perfect confidence in her , and tried to persuade her to come to me for a refuge . I am very sorry to have done a man wrong , particularly when it ca n’t be undone . Be kind enough to let Lizzie know what I say ; not forgetting that if she will come to the Porters , after all , bygones being bygones , she will find a home at the Porters , and a friend at the Porters . She knows Miss Abbey of old , remind her , and she knows what - like the home , and what - like the friend , is likely to turn out .

Chapter 4 A HAPPY RETURN OF THE DAY Mr and Mrs Wilfer had seen a full quarter of a hundred more anniversaries of their wedding day than Mr and Mrs Lammle had seen of theirs , but they still celebrated the occasion in the bosom of their family . Not that these celebrations ever resulted in anything particularly agreeable , or that the family was ever disappointed by that circumstance on account of having looked forward to the return of the auspicious day with sanguine anticipations of enjoyment . It was kept morally , rather as a Fast than a Feast , enabling Mrs Wilfer to hold a sombre darkling state , which exhibited that impressive woman in her choicest colours . The noble lady ’s condition on these delightful occasions was one compounded of heroic endurance and heroic forgiveness . Lurid indications of the better marriages she might have made , shone athwart the awful gloom of her composure , and fitfully revealed the cherub as a little monster unaccountably favoured by Heaven , who had possessed himself of a blessing for which many of his superiors had sued and contended in vain . So firmly had this his position towards his treasure become established , that when the anniversary arrived , it always found him in an apologetic state . It is not impossible that his modest penitence may have even gone the length of sometimes severely reproving him for that he ever took the liberty of making so exalted a character his wife . As for the children of the union , their experience of these festivals had been sufficiently uncomfortable to lead them annually to wish , when out of their tenderest years , either that Ma had married somebody else instead of much - teased Pa , or that Pa had married somebody else instead of Ma . When there came to be but two sisters left at home , the daring mind of Bella on the next of these occasions scaled the height of wondering with droll vexation ‘
224154	224303	224304	224304	I	0	’ The revolving year now bringing the day round in its orderly sequence , Bella arrived in the Boffin chariot to assist at the celebration . It was the family custom when the day recurred , to sacrifice a pair of fowls on the altar of Hymen ; and Bella had sent a note beforehand , to intimate that she would bring the votive offering with her . So , Bella and the fowls , by the united energies of two horses , two men , four wheels , and a plum - pudding carriage dog with as uncomfortable a collar on as if he had been George the Fourth , were deposited at the door of the parental dwelling . They were there received by Mrs Wilfer in person , whose dignity on this , as on most special occasions , was heightened by a mysterious toothache . ‘
224313	224317	224304	224304	I	0	’ said Bella . ‘
224323	224379	224304	224304	I	0	’ The male domestic of Mrs Boffin touched his hat , and in the act of departure had an awful glare bestowed upon him by Mrs Wilfer , intended to carry deep into his audacious soul the assurance that , whatever his private suspicions might be , male domestics in livery were no rarity there . ‘
224385	224389	224393	224393	you	5340	’ said Bella , ‘
224396	224397	224398	224398	I	0	’ ‘
224405	224410	224398	224398	I	0	’ replied Mrs Wilfer , ‘
224416	224417	224403	224403	Bella	638	’ ‘
224423	224427	224428	224428	you	451	’ said Bella ; ‘
224437	224438	224428	224428	you	451	’ ‘
224448	224457	224443	224443	Ma	451	’ interposed Lavvy , over the maternal shoulder , ‘
224486	224520	224521	224522	Mr Rokesmith	315	’ Mrs Wilfer , with a look too full of majesty to be accompanied by any words , attended both her daughters to the kitchen , where the sacrifice was to be prepared . ‘
224524	224530	224521	224522	Mr Rokesmith	315	’ said she , resignedly , ‘
224625	224653	224617	224617	he	5343	’ Bella happened to know that he had no engagement out of his own room at Mr Boffin ’s , but she approved of his staying away . ‘
224665	224669	224654	224654	We	5342	’ she thought , ‘
224681	224856	224861	224861	sir	8755	’ Yet she had sufficient curiosity about his room , to run up to it with the least possible delay , and make a close inspection of its contents . It was tastefully though economically furnished , and very neatly arranged . There were shelves and stands of books , English , French , and Italian ; and in a portfolio on the writing - table there were sheets upon sheets of memoranda and calculations in figures , evidently referring to the Boffin property . On that table also , carefully backed with canvas , varnished , mounted , and rolled like a map , was the placard descriptive of the murdered man who had come from afar to be her husband . She shrank from this ghostly surprise , and felt quite frightened as she rolled and tied it up again . Peeping about here and there , she came upon a print , a graceful head of a pretty woman , elegantly framed , hanging in the corner by the easy chair . ‘
224863	224874	224879	224879	sir	8755	’ said Bella , after stopping to ruminate before it . ‘
224890	224908	224887	224887	you	8755	’S like . But I ’ll tell you what it ’s much more like — your impudence ! ’
224932	224937	224939	224939	Bella	638	‘ Now , Ma , ’
224952	224978	224939	224939	Bella	638	‘ you and Lavvy think magnificent me fit for nothing , but I intend to prove the contrary . I mean to be Cook today . ’

225079	225089	225077	225077	Bella	638	‘ that is precisely the state of the case . ’

225184	225207	225180	225181	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ if you persist in what I can not but regard as conduct utterly incompatible with the equipage in which you arrived — ’
225209	225216	225180	225181	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Which I do , Ma . ’
225218	225232	225156	225156	Bella	638	‘ First , then , you put the fowls down to the fire . ’
225233	225240	225242	225242	Bella	638	‘ To — be — sure ! ’
225244	225259	225242	225242	Bella	638	‘ and flour them , and twirl them round , and there they go ! ’
225268	225275	225242	225242	Bella	638	‘ What ’s next , Ma ? ’
225276	225279	225281	225282	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Next , ’

225518	225523	225525	225525	Lavinia	310	‘ Look at Ma , ’
225541	225586	225525	225525	Lavinia	310	‘ If one was the most dutiful child in existence ( of course on the whole one hopes one is ) , is n’t she enough to make one want to poke her with something wooden , sitting there bolt upright in a corner ? ’
225587	225591	225593	225593	Bella	638	‘ Only suppose , ’
225595	225608	225525	225525	Lavinia	310	‘ that poor Pa was to sit bolt upright in another corner . ’
225609	225619	225621	225621	Lavvy	317	‘ My dear , he could n’t do it , ’
225623	225650	225621	225621	Lavvy	317	‘ Pa would loll directly . But indeed I do not believe there ever was any human creature who could keep so bolt upright as Ma , ‘
225676	225677	225674	225674	Ma	451	’ ‘
225684	225701	225679	225679	I	0	’ returned Mrs Wilfer , turning her eyes upon her youngest born , with scornful fortitude . ‘
225710	225711	225712	225712	You	451	’ ‘
225721	225727	225719	225719	Ma	451	’ retorted Lavvy the bold . ‘
225730	225735	225719	225719	Ma	451	’ repeated her parent , ‘
225766	225767	225770	225770	Ma	451	’ ‘
225772	225776	225770	225770	Ma	451	’ returned Lavvy , ‘
225849	225850	225851	225851	You	451	’ ‘
225856	225861	225863	225863	you	451	’ said Mrs Wilfer , ‘
225910	225911	225914	225914	Ma	451	’ ‘
225916	225920	225914	225914	Ma	451	’ replied Lavvy , ‘
225947	226049	226050	226050	I	0	’ Whether or no the sharp vigour of this sally on a weak point of Mrs Wilfer ’s entrenchments might have routed that heroine for the time , is rendered uncertain by the arrival of a flag of truce in the person of Mr George Sampson : bidden to the feast as a friend of the family , whose affections were now understood to be in course of transference from Bella to Lavinia , and whom Lavinia kept — possibly in remembrance of his bad taste in having overlooked her in the first instance — under a course of stinging discipline . ‘
226057	226073	226054	226055	Mrs Wilfer	302	’ said Mr George Sampson , who had meditated this neat address while coming along , ‘
226078	226099	226100	226100	I	0	’ Mrs Wilfer thanked him with a magnanimous sigh , and again became an unresisting prey to that inscrutable toothache . ‘
226104	226110	226262	226262	I	0	’ said Mr Sampson feebly , ‘
226118	226214	226112	226113	Miss Bella	307	’ Here Miss Lavinia descended on the ill - starred young gentleman with a crushing supposition that at all events it was no business of his . This disposed of Mr Sampson in a melancholy retirement of spirit , until the cherub arrived , whose amazement at the lovely woman ’s occupation was great . However , she persisted in dishing the dinner as well as cooking it , and then sat down , bibless and apronless , to partake of it as an illustrious guest : Mrs Wilfer first responding to her husband ’s cheerful ‘
226223	226239	226112	226113	Miss Bella	307	’ with a sepulchral Amen , calculated to cast a damp upon the stoutest appetite . ‘
226243	226256	226265	226265	Pa	580	’ said Bella , as she watched the carving of the fowls , ‘
226272	226273	226265	226265	Pa	580	’ ‘
226288	226291	226292	226292	I	0	’ returned Pa. ‘
226303	226304	226305	226305	They	5369	’ ‘
226310	226314	226305	226305	They	5369	’ said Bella . ‘
226328	226333	226317	226317	I	0	’ rejoined her father , ‘
226339	226614	226335	226335	they	5369	’ So , the gridiron was put in requisition , and the good - tempered cherub , who was often as un - cherubically employed in his own family as if he had been in the employment of some of the Old Masters , undertook to grill the fowls . Indeed , except in respect of staring about him ( a branch of the public service to which the pictorial cherub is much addicted ) , this domestic cherub discharged as many odd functions as his prototype ; with the difference , say , that he performed with a blacking - brush on the family ’s boots , instead of performing on enormous wind instruments and double - basses , and that he conducted himself with cheerful alacrity to much useful purpose , instead of foreshortening himself in the air with the vaguest intentions . Bella helped him with his supplemental cookery , and made him very happy , but put him in mortal terror too by asking him when they sat down at table again , how he supposed they cooked fowls at the Greenwich dinners , and whether he believed they really were such pleasant dinners as people said ? His secret winks and nods of remonstrance , in reply , made the mischievous Bella laugh until she choked , and then Lavinia was obliged to slap her on the back , and then she laughed the more . But her mother was a fine corrective at the other end of the table ; to whom her father , in the innocence of his good - fellowship , at intervals appealed with : ‘
226627	226628	226618	226618	I	0	’ ‘
226635	226641	226632	226633	R. W.	304	’ she would sonorously reply . ‘
226655	226656	226647	226647	you	919	’ ‘
226661	226673	226647	226647	you	919	’ would be the rejoinder , in exactly the same tone . ‘
226685	226686	226675	226675	you	919	’ ‘
226699	226700	226697	226698	R. W.	304	’ ‘
226712	226713	226714	226714	I	0	’ ‘
226726	226790	226697	226698	R. W.	304	’ The stately woman would then , with a meritorious appearance of devoting herself to the general good , pursue her dinner as if she were feeding somebody else on high public grounds . Bella had brought dessert and two bottles of wine , thus shedding unprecedented splendour on the occasion . Mrs Wilfer did the honours of the first glass by proclaiming : ‘
226798	226810	226697	226698	R. W.	304	‘ Thank you , my dear . And I to you . ’
226811	226816	226818	226818	Bella	307	‘ Pa and Ma ! ’
226820	226824	226818	226818	Bella	307	‘ Permit me , ’
226833	226864	226825	226826	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ No . I think not . I drank to your papa . If , however , you insist on including me , I can in gratitude offer no objection . ’
226865	226872	226874	226874	Lavvy	317	‘ Why , Lor , Ma , ’
226878	226899	226874	226874	Lavvy	317	‘ is n’t it the day that made you and Pa one and the same ? I have no patience ! ’
226900	226983	226825	226826	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ By whatever other circumstance the day may be marked , it is not the day , Lavinia , on which I will allow a child of mine to pounce upon me . I beg — nay , command!—that you will not pounce . R. W. , it is appropriate to recall that it is for you to command and for me to obey . It is your house , and you are master at your own table . Both our healths ! ’
226991	227002	227004	227005	the cherub	11485	‘ I really am a little afraid , my dear , ’
227008	227016	227004	227005	the cherub	11485	‘ that you are not enjoying yourself ? ’
227017	227022	227024	227025	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ On the contrary , ’
227027	227036	227024	227025	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ quite so . Why should I not ? ’
227037	227050	227004	227005	the cherub	11485	‘ I thought , my dear , that perhaps your face might — ’
227051	227075	227077	227077	she	302	‘ My face might be a martyrdom , but what would that import , or who should know it , if I smiled ? ’
227130	227136	227138	227139	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ The mind naturally falls , ’
227141	227163	227138	227139	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ shall I say into a reverie , or shall I say into a retrospect ? on a day like this . ’
227179	227182	227164	227164	Lavvy	317	‘ For goodness ’
227200	227201	227193	227193	Ma	451	’ ‘
227205	227214	227193	227193	Ma	451	’ pursued Mrs Wilfer in an oratorical manner , ‘
227272	227279	227260	227270	a finer woman than my mother ; never than my father	5378	’ The irrepressible Lavvy remarked aloud , ‘
227290	227291	227284	227284	he	5381	’ ‘
227295	227311	227292	227293	Your grandpapa	5383	’ retorted Mrs Wilfer , with an awful look , and in an awful tone , ‘
227384	227444	227460	227460	she	646	’ These remarks being offered to Mr George Sampson , who had not the courage to come out for single combat , but lurked with his chest under the table and his eyes cast down , Mrs Wilfer proceeded , in a voice of increasing sternness and impressiveness , until she should force that skulker to give himself up . ‘
227573	227609	227611	227618	the most prominent members of that distinguished circle	5395	’ ( Here Mr Sampson delivered himself captive , and said , with an uneasy movement on his chair , that three was a large number , and it must have been highly entertaining . ) ‘
227636	227653	227654	227655	This gentleman	8826	’ ( Here Mr Sampson said , with no reason whatever , Of course not . ) ‘
227673	227692	227693	227693	I	0	’ ( Here Mr Sampson murmured that when it came to that , you could always tell . ) ‘
227794	227811	227812	227812	She	1338	’ ( Here Mr Sampson glanced at his host and shook his head with despondency . ) ‘
227854	227873	227879	227879	I	0	’ said Mrs Wilfer , deepening her voice , as if she were relating a terrible ghost story , ‘
227911	227989	227990	227990	My	0	’ Mr Sampson at length released from the custody of Mrs Wilfer ’s eye , now drew a long breath , and made the original and striking remark that there was no accounting for these sort of presentiments . R. W. scratched his head and looked apologetically all round the table until he came to his wife , when observing her as it were shrouded in a more sombre veil than before , he once more hinted , ‘
228004	228012	227997	227997	you	919	’ To which she once more replied , ‘
228022	228250	228017	228018	R. W.	304	’ The wretched Mr Sampson ’s position at this agreeable entertainment was truly pitiable . For , not only was he exposed defenceless to the harangues of Mrs Wilfer , but he received the utmost contumely at the hands of Lavinia ; who , partly to show Bella that she ( Lavinia ) could do what she liked with him , and partly to pay him off for still obviously admiring Bella ’s beauty , led him the life of a dog . Illuminated on the one hand by the stately graces of Mrs Wilfer ’s oratory , and shadowed on the other by the checks and frowns of the young lady to whom he had devoted himself in his destitution , the sufferings of this young gentleman were distressing to witness . If his mind for the moment reeled under them , it may be urged , in extenuation of its weakness , that it was constitutionally a knock - knee’d mind and never very strong upon its legs . The rosy hours were thus beguiled until it was time for Bella to have Pa ’s escort back . The dimples duly tied up in the bonnet - strings and the leave - taking done , they got out into the air , and the cherub drew a long breath as if he found it refreshing . ‘
228256	228260	228254	228254	Pa	580	’ said Bella , ‘
228268	228269	228254	228254	Pa	580	’ ‘
228275	228280	228254	228254	Pa	580	’ returned the cherub , ‘
228285	228288	228289	228289	Bella	307	’em gone . ’
228310	228317	228318	228318	he	580	‘ Thank you , my dear , ’
228327	228347	228318	228318	he	580	‘ I am all right , my dear . Well , and how do you get on , Bella ? ’
228348	228357	228289	228289	Bella	307	‘ I am not at all improved , Pa. ’
228358	228365	228318	228318	he	580	‘ Ai n’t you really though ? ’
228366	228378	228289	228289	Bella	307	‘ No , Pa. On the contrary , I am worse . ’
228379	228382	228384	228385	the cherub	11485	‘ Lor ! ’
228387	228445	228384	228385	the cherub	11485	‘ I am worse , Pa. I make so many calculations how much a year I must have when I marry , and what is the least I can manage to do with , that I am beginning to get wrinkles over my nose . Did you notice any wrinkles over my nose this evening , Pa ? ’
228459	228546	228451	228451	Bella	307	‘ You wo n’t laugh , sir , when you see your lovely woman turning haggard . You had better be prepared in time , I can tell you . I shall not be able to keep my greediness for money out of my eyes long , and when you see it there you ’ll be sorry , and serve you right for not being warned in time . Now , sir , we entered into a bond of confidence . Have you anything to impart ? ’
228547	228561	228680	228681	her father	1004	‘ I thought it was you who was to impart , my love . ’
228562	228670	228680	228681	her father	1004	‘ Oh ! did you indeed , sir ? Then why did n’t you ask me , the moment we came out ? The confidences of lovely women are not to be slighted . However , I forgive you this once , and look here , Pa ; that’s’—Bella laid the little forefinger of her right glove on her lip , and then laid it on her father ’s lip—‘that ’s a kiss for you . And now I am going seriously to tell you — let me see how many — four secrets . Mind ! Serious , grave , weighty secrets . Strictly between ourselves . ’
228671	228678	228680	228681	her father	1004	‘ Number one , my dear ? ’
228690	228694	228696	228696	Bella	307	‘ Number one , ’
228698	228720	228696	228696	Bella	307	‘ will electrify you , Pa. Who do you think has’—she was confused here in spite of her merry way of beginning ‘
228728	228755	228756	228757	Mr Rokesmith	315	’ Pa looked in her face , and looked at the ground , and looked in her face again , and declared he could never guess . ‘

228782	228791	228780	228780	Pa	1329	’ said Bella separating the syllables for emphasis . ‘
228799	228809	228794	228794	you	307	’ Pa answered quietly with the counter - question , ‘

229070	229081	229063	229063	Pa	580	’ rejoined Bella , giving him another shake or two . ‘

229123	229132	229100	229100	he	1329	’ said the cherub , a little depressed . ‘

229219	229230	229212	229212	they	5425	’ Here the grateful girl burst out crying very heartily . ‘
229238	229250	229212	229212	they	5425	’ said her father , with his hand to his eyes ; ‘
229314	229459	229303	229303	I	0	’ The good soft little fellow , drying his eyes , here , Bella put her arms round his neck and tenderly kissed him on the high road , passionately telling him he was the best of fathers and the best of friends , and that on her wedding - morning she would go down on her knees to him and beg his pardon for having ever teased him or seemed insensible to the worth of such a patient , sympathetic , genial , fresh young heart . At every one of her adjectives she redoubled her kisses , and finally kissed his hat off , and then laughed immoderately when the wind took it and he ran after it . When he had recovered his hat and his breath , and they were going on again once more , said her father then : ‘
229466	229478	229303	229303	I	0	’ Bella ’s countenance fell in the midst of her mirth . ‘
229516	229536	229491	229491	Pa.	577	’ The change in her , strengthened the cherub ’s interest in number four , and he said quietly : ‘
229553	229565	229550	229551	my dear	919	’ Bella looked at him pensively , and shook her head . ‘

Ill news travels fast . We shall know full soon . On that very night of her return from the Happy Return , something chanced which Bella closely followed with her eyes and ears . There was an apartment at the side of the Boffin mansion , known as Mr Boffin ’s room . Far less grand than the rest of the house , it was far more comfortable , being pervaded by a certain air of homely snugness , which upholstering despotism had banished to that spot when it inexorably set its face against Mr Boffin ’s appeals for mercy in behalf of any other chamber . Thus , although a room of modest situation — for its windows gave on Silas Wegg ’s old corner — and of no pretensions to velvet , satin , or gilding , it had got itself established in a domestic position analogous to that of an easy dressing - gown or pair of slippers ; and whenever the family wanted to enjoy a particularly pleasant fireside evening , they enjoyed it , as an institution that must be , in Mr Boffin ’s room . Mr and Mrs Boffin were reported sitting in this room , when Bella got back . Entering it , she found the Secretary there too ; in official attendance it would appear , for he was standing with some papers in his hand by a table with shaded candles on it , at which Mr Boffin was seated thrown back in his easy chair . ‘
230292	230301	230290	230290	sir	8755	’ said Bella , hesitating at the door . ‘
230314	230342	230343	230344	Mrs Boffin	324	’re one of ourselves . We never make company of you . Come in , come in . Here ’s the old lady in her usual place . ’
230388	230393	230395	230397	the Golden Dustman	10194	‘ Now , Rokesmith , ’
230421	230426	230418	230418	she	307	‘ where were we ? ’
230427	230434	230436	230437	the Secretary	2769	‘ You were saying , sir , ’
230455	230468	230436	230437	the Secretary	2769	‘ that you considered the time had come for fixing my salary . ’
230469	230480	230482	230483	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Do n’t be above calling it wages , man , ’
230487	230504	230482	230483	Mr Boffin	324	‘ What the deuce ! I never talked of any salary when I was in service . ’
230505	230509	230515	230515	himself	2769	‘ My wages , ’
230517	230528	230530	230531	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Rokesmith , you are not proud , I hope ? ’
230537	230544	230530	230531	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I hope not , sir . ’
230545	230556	230558	230559	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Because I never was , when I was poor , ’
230561	230606	230558	230559	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Poverty and pride do n’t go at all well together . Mind that . How can they go well together ? Why it stands to reason . A man , being poor , has nothing to be proud of . It ’s nonsense . ’
230634	230636	230638	230638	his	2769	‘ nonsense ’
230641	230649	230651	230652	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Now , concerning these same wages , ’
230654	230658	230651	230652	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Sit down . ’
230664	230673	230675	230676	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Why did n’t you sit down before ? ’
230680	230724	230675	230676	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I hope that was n’t pride ? But about these wages . Now , I ’ve gone into the matter , and I say two hundred a year . What do you think of it ? Do you think it ’s enough ? ’
230725	230735	230651	230652	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Thank you . It is a fair proposal . ’
230736	230745	230746	230747	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I do n’t say , you know , ’
230750	230900	230746	230747	Mr Boffin	324	‘ but what it may be more than enough . And I ’ll tell you why , Rokesmith . A man of property , like me , is bound to consider the market - price . At first I did n’t enter into that as much as I might have done ; but I ’ve got acquainted with other men of property since , and I ’ve got acquainted with the duties of property . I must n’t go putting the market - price up , because money may happen not to be an object with me . A sheep is worth so much in the market , and I ought to give it and no more . A secretary is worth so much in the market , and I ought to give it and no more . However , I do n’t mind stretching a point with you . ’
230901	230910	230912	230913	the Secretary	2769	‘ Mr Boffin , you are very good , ’
230919	230926	230928	230929	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Then we put the figure , ’
230931	230992	230928	230929	Mr Boffin	324	‘ at two hundred a year . Then the figure ’s disposed of . Now , there must be no misunderstanding regarding what I buy for two hundred a year . If I pay for a sheep , I buy it out and out . Similarly , if I pay for a secretary , I buy HIM out and out . ’
230993	231004	230746	230747	Mr Boffin	324	‘ In other words , you purchase my whole time ? ’
231005	231013	231015	231016	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Certainly I do . Look here , ’
231018	231102	231015	231016	Mr Boffin	324	‘ it ai n’t that I want to occupy your whole time ; you can take up a book for a minute or two when you ’ve nothing better to do , though I think you ’ll a’most always find something useful to do . But I want to keep you in attendance . It ’s convenient to have you at all times ready on the premises . Therefore , betwixt your breakfast and your supper,—on the premises I expect to find you . ’
231107	231119	231121	231122	Mr Boffin	324	‘ In bygone days , when I was in service myself , ’
231124	231203	231121	231122	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I could n’t go cutting about at my will and pleasure , and you wo n’t expect to go cutting about at your will and pleasure . You ’ve rather got into a habit of that , lately ; but perhaps it was for want of a right specification betwixt us . Now , let there be a right specification betwixt us , and let it be this . If you want leave , ask for it . ’
231223	231230	231232	231233	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I ’ll have a bell , ’
231235	231272	231232	231233	Mr Boffin	324	‘ hung from this room to yours , and when I want you , I ’ll touch it . I do n’t call to mind that I have anything more to say at the present moment . ’
231312	231325	231327	231328	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I have let that chap , that young man of mine , ’
231339	231379	231327	231328	Mr Boffin	324	‘ get above his work . It wo n’t do . I must have him down a peg . A man of property owes a duty to other men of property , and must look sharp after his inferiors . ’
231448	231451	231453	231454	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Noddy , ’
231463	231467	231469	231471	the Golden Dustman	10194	‘ My dear , ’
231479	231526	231469	231471	the Golden Dustman	10194	‘ Excuse my putting it to you , Noddy , but now really ! Have n’t you been a little strict with Mr Rokesmith to - night ? Have n’t you been a little — just a little little — not quite like your old self ? ’
231527	231537	231539	231540	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Why , old woman , I hope so , ’
231548	231554	231539	231540	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Hope so , deary ? ’
231555	231612	231469	231471	the Golden Dustman	10194	‘ Our old selves would n’t do here , old lady . Have n’t you found that out yet ? Our old selves would be fit for nothing here but to be robbed and imposed upon . Our old selves were n’t people of fortune ; our new selves are ; it ’s a great difference . ’
231613	231616	231618	231619	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Ah ! ’
231640	231645	231618	231619	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ A great difference . ’
231646	231656	231658	231659	her husband	8651	‘ And we must be up to the difference , ’
231661	231722	231658	231659	her husband	8651	‘ we must be equal to the change ; that ’s what we must be . We ’ve got to hold our own now , against everybody ( for everybody ’s hand is stretched out to be dipped into our pockets ) , and we have got to recollect that money makes money , as well as makes everything else . ’
231723	231727	231729	231730	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Mentioning recollecting , ’
231750	231821	231744	231744	her	5462	‘ do you recollect , Noddy , how you said to Mr Rokesmith when he first came to see us at the Bower , and you engaged him — how you said to him that if it had pleased Heaven to send John Harmon to his fortune safe , we could have been content with the one Mound which was our legacy , and should never have wanted the rest ? ’
231822	231857	231744	231744	her	5462	‘ Ay , I remember , old lady . But we had n’t tried what it was to have the rest then . Our new shoes had come home , but we had n’t put ’em
231861	231863	231744	231744	her	5462	’re wearing ’em
231867	231869	231744	231744	her	5462	’re wearing ’em
231877	231893	231860	231860	We	5464	’ Mrs Boffin took up her work again , and plied her needle in silence . ‘
231904	231928	231898	231902	that young man of mine	12845	’ said Mr Boffin , dropping his voice and glancing towards the door with an apprehension of being overheard by some eavesdropper there , ‘
231963	232018	231958	231958	you	5467	’em , they wo n’t believe in your being any better than themselves , if as good , after the stories ( lies mostly ) that they have heard of your beginnings . There ’s nothing betwixt stiffening yourself up , and throwing yourself away ; take my word for that , old lady . ’
232053	232056	232058	232058	he	12845	‘ Hows’ever , ’
232060	232074	232058	232058	he	12845	‘ this is n’t entertaining to Miss Bella . Is it , Bella ? ’
232110	232121	232123	232124	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Hah ! Better employed than to attend to it , ’
232126	232152	232123	232124	Mr Boffin	324	‘ That ’s right , that ’s right . Especially as you have no call to be told how to value yourself , my dear . ’
232163	232175	232160	232160	Bella	307	‘ I hope sir , you do n’t think me vain ? ’
232176	232184	232186	232187	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Not a bit , my dear , ’
232189	232286	232288	232289	Mr Boffin	324	‘ But I think it ’s very creditable in you , at your age , to be so well up with the pace of the world , and to know what to go in for . You are right . Go in for money , my love . Money ’s the article . You ’ll make money of your good looks , and of the money Mrs Boffin and me will have the pleasure of settling upon you , and you ’ll live and die rich . That ’s the state to live and die in ! ’
232296	232303	232288	232289	Mr Boffin	324	‘ R — r — rich ! ’
232334	232345	232324	232324	she	5468	‘ Do n’t mind him , Bella , my dear . ’
232346	232349	232351	232352	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Eh ? ’
232354	232361	232324	232324	she	5468	‘ What ! Not mind him ? ’
232362	232369	232371	232372	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ I do n’t mean that , ’
232379	232424	232425	232425	She	5468	‘ but I mean , do n’t believe him to be anything but good and generous , Bella , because he is the best of men . No , I must say that much , Noddy . You are always the best of men . ’
232446	232456	232458	232459	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ And as to you , my dear Bella , ’
232467	232501	232458	232459	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ he is so much attached to you , whatever he says , that your own father has not a truer interest in you and can hardly like you better than he does . ’
232502	232506	232508	232509	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Says too ! ’
232511	232617	232508	232509	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Whatever he says ! Why , I say so , openly . Give me a kiss , my dear child , in saying Good Night , and let me confirm what my old lady tells you . I am very fond of you , my dear , and I am entirely of your mind , and you and I will take care that you shall be rich . These good looks of yours ( which you have some right to be vain of ; my dear , though you are not , you know ) are worth money , and you shall make money of ’em
232654	232716	232723	232723	him	5474	’ Somehow , Bella was not so well pleased with this assurance and this prospect as she might have been . Somehow , when she put her arms round Mrs Boffin ’s neck and said Good Night , she derived a sense of unworthiness from the still anxious face of that good woman and her obvious wish to excuse her husband . ‘
232725	232736	232723	232723	him	5474	’ thought Bella , sitting down in her own room . ‘
232799	232817	232820	232820	you	5474	’ said Bella , sternly putting the question to herself in the looking - glass as usual , ‘
232830	233123	232820	232820	you	5474	’ The looking - glass preserving a discreet ministerial silence when thus called upon for explanation , Bella went to bed with a weariness upon her spirit which was more than the weariness of want of sleep . And again in the morning , she looked for the cloud , and for the deepening of the cloud , upon the Golden Dustman ’s face . She had begun by this time to be his frequent companion in his morning strolls about the streets , and it was at this time that he made her a party to his engaging in a curious pursuit . Having been hard at work in one dull enclosure all his life , he had a child ’s delight in looking at shops . It had been one of the first novelties and pleasures of his freedom , and was equally the delight of his wife . For many years their only walks in London had been taken on Sundays when the shops were shut ; and when every day in the week became their holiday , they derived an enjoyment from the variety and fancy and beauty of the display in the windows , which seemed incapable of exhaustion . As if the principal streets were a great Theatre and the play were childishly new to them , Mr and Mrs Boffin , from the beginning of Bella ’s intimacy in their house , had been constantly in the front row , charmed with all they saw and applauding vigorously . But now , Mr Boffin ’s interest began to centre in book - shops ; and more than that — for that of itself would not have been much — in one exceptional kind of book . ‘
233131	233147	233148	233148	you	919	’ Mr Boffin would say , checking Bella ’s arm at a bookseller ’s window ; ‘
233162	233187	233195	233196	Mr Boffin	324	’re bright . Now , look well about you , my dear , and tell me if you see any book about a Miser . ’
233231	233267	233226	233227	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Now , look well all round , my dear , for a Life of a Miser , or any book of that sort ; any Lives of odd characters who may have been Misers . ’
233391	233393	233379	233380	a bookseller	12894	‘ Characters ’
234068	234089	234054	234057	the latter worthy soul	5499	‘ Mrs Lammle is a younger companion for her than I am , and Lor ! she ’s more fashionable . ’
234336	234343	234345	234346	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ I fear , Bella dear , ’
234353	234363	234345	234346	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ that you will be very hard to please . ’
234364	234375	234377	234377	Bella	307	‘ I do n’t expect to be pleased , dear , ’
234387	234393	234384	234384	her	307	‘ Truly , my love , ’
234407	234423	234398	234398	her	625	‘ it would not be very easy to find a man worthy of your attractions . ’
234424	234435	234437	234437	Bella	307	‘ The question is not a man , my dear , ’
234441	234446	234437	234437	Bella	307	‘ but an establishment . ’
234447	234451	234453	234454	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ My love , ’
234456	234523	234453	234454	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ your prudence amazes me — where DID you study life so well!—you are right . In such a case as yours , the object is a fitting establishment . You could not descend to an inadequate one from Mr Boffin ’s house , and even if your beauty alone could not command it , it is to be assumed that Mr and Mrs Boffin will — ’
234524	234531	234532	234532	Bella	307	‘ Oh ! they have already , ’
234535	234542	234532	234532	Bella	307	‘ No ! Have they really ? ’
234571	234577	234578	234578	she	307	‘ That is to say , ’
234581	234607	234578	234578	she	307	‘ they have told me they mean to portion me as their adopted child , if you mean that . But do n’t mention it . ’
234608	234612	234614	234615	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Mention it ! ’
234633	234639	234619	234619	she	423	‘ Men - tion it ! ’
234640	234651	234652	234652	Bella	307	‘ I do n’t mind telling you , Mrs Lammle — ’
234656	234670	234652	234652	Bella	307	‘ My love , say Sophronia , or I must not say Bella . ’
234677	234680	234681	234681	Bella	307	‘ Oh ! ’
234684	234722	234681	234681	Bella	307	‘ Oh!—Sophronia then — I do n’t mind telling you , Sophronia , that I am convinced I have no heart , as people call it ; and that I think that sort of thing is nonsense . ’
234723	234727	234729	234730	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Brave girl ! ’
234732	234736	234729	234730	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ And so , ’
234740	234766	234779	234780	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ as to seeking to please myself , I do n’t ; except in the one respect I have mentioned . I am indifferent otherwise . ’
234767	234777	234779	234780	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ But you ca n’t help pleasing , Bella , ’
234793	234869	234779	234780	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ you ca n’t help making a proud and an admiring husband . You may not care to please yourself , and you may not care to please him , but you are not a free agent as to pleasing : you are forced to do that , in spite of yourself , my dear ; so it may be a question whether you may not as well please yourself too , if you can . ’
234936	234951	234953	234953	Bella	307	‘ Do n’t talk of pleasing in spite of one ’s self , dear , ’
234955	234963	234953	234953	Bella	307	‘ I have had enough of that . ’
234964	234967	234969	234970	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Ay ? ’
234972	234980	234969	234970	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Am I already corroborated , Bella ? ’
234981	235003	234953	234953	Bella	307	‘ Never mind , Sophronia , we will not speak of it any more . Do n’t ask me about it . ’
235021	235050	235017	235017	she	423	‘ Tell me , Bella . Come , my dear . What provoking burr has been inconveniently attracted to the charming skirts , and with difficulty shaken off ? ’
235051	235055	235057	235057	Bella	307	‘ Provoking indeed , ’
235059	235073	235017	235017	she	423	‘ and no burr to boast of ! But do n’t ask me . ’
235074	235079	234969	234970	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Shall I guess ? ’
235080	235094	235017	235017	she	423	‘ You would never guess . What would you say to our Secretary ? ’
235095	235117	235017	235017	she	423	‘ My dear ! The hermit Secretary , who creeps up and down the back stairs , and is never seen ! ’
235118	235133	235135	235135	Bella	307	‘ I do n’t know about his creeping up and down the back stairs , ’
235140	235198	235135	235135	Bella	307	‘ further than knowing that he does no such thing ; and as to his never being seen , I should be content never to have seen him , though he is quite as visible as you are . But I pleased HIM ( for my sins ) and he had the presumption to tell me so . ’
235199	235213	235017	235017	she	423	‘ The man never made a declaration to you , my dear Bella ! ’
235214	235223	235225	235225	Bella	307	‘ Are you sure of that , Sophronia ? ’
235227	235242	235225	235225	Bella	307	‘ I am not . In fact , I am sure of the contrary . ’
235243	235250	235252	235253	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ The man must be mad , ’
235261	235270	235272	235272	Bella	307	‘ He appeared to be in his senses , ’
235278	235358	235275	235275	her	307	‘ and he had plenty to say for himself . I told him my opinion of his declaration and his conduct , and dismissed him . Of course this has all been very inconvenient to me , and very disagreeable . It has remained a secret , however . That word reminds me to observe , Sophronia , that I have glided on into telling you the secret , and that I rely upon you never to mention it . ’
235359	235363	235365	235366	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Mention it ! ’

You ’ll charge the quarter ’s rent to me , and we must try and save it somewhere . You ’ve got some lovely furniture ; have n’t you ? ’

240483	240488	240517	240517	you	8755	’ demanded Mr Boffin . ‘
240496	240504	240517	240517	you	8755	’ repeated Silas , reading very distinctly , ‘
240523	240537	240538	240538	Mounds	101	’ This , to secure attention to his adding with his lips only , ‘
240540	240566	240538	240538	Mounds	101	’ Mr Boffin drew an arm - chair into the space where he stood , and said , seating himself and slyly rubbing his hands : ‘
240571	240646	240538	240538	Mounds	101	’ Mr Wegg pursued the biography of that eminent man through its various phases of avarice and dirt , through Miss Dancer ’s death on a sick regimen of cold dumpling , and through Mr Dancer ’s keeping his rags together with a hayband , and warming his dinner by sitting upon it , down to the consolatory incident of his dying naked in a sack . After which he read on as follows : ‘
240699	240726	240756	240757	Captain Holmes	676	’ ( Here Mr Wegg eyes his comrade and the room in which they sat : which had not been repaired for a long time . ) ‘
240774	240780	240767	240768	the miser	5527	’ ( Here Mr Wegg repeated ‘
240783	240792	240767	240768	the miser	5527	’ , and pegged his comrade again . ) ‘
240861	240885	240910	240910	they	5619	’ ( Here Mr Wegg ’s wooden leg started forward under the table , and slowly elevated itself as he read on . ) ‘
240928	240940	240910	240910	they	5619	’ ; ( Here Mr Venus looked at the wall . ) ‘
240954	240968	240910	240910	they	5619	’ ; ( Here Mr Venus looked under himself on the settle . ) ‘
241058	241194	241236	241236	your	8755	’ On the way to this crisis Mr Wegg ’s wooden leg had gradually elevated itself more and more , and he had nudged Mr Venus with his opposite elbow deeper and deeper , until at length the preservation of his balance became incompatible with the two actions , and he now dropped over sideways upon that gentleman , squeezing him against the settle ’s edge . Nor did either of the two , for some few seconds , make any effort to recover himself ; both remaining in a kind of pecuniary swoon . But the sight of Mr Boffin sitting in the arm - chair hugging himself , with his eyes upon the fire , acted as a restorative . Counterfeiting a sneeze to cover their movements , Mr Wegg , with a spasmodic ‘
241199	241211	241236	241236	your	8755	’ pulled himself and Mr Venus up in a masterly manner . ‘
241218	241225	241236	241236	your	8755	’ said Mr Boffin , hungrily . ‘
241243	241244	241240	241241	John Elwes	667	’ ‘
241247	241252	241240	241241	John Elwes	667	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
241260	241381	241257	241257	John	667	’ He did not appear to have hidden anything , so went off rather flatly . But an exemplary lady named Wilcocks , who had stowed away gold and silver in a pickle - pot in a clock - case , a canister - full of treasure in a hole under her stairs , and a quantity of money in an old rat - trap , revived the interest . To her succeeded another lady , claiming to be a pauper , whose wealth was found wrapped up in little scraps of paper and old rag . To her , another lady , apple - woman by trade , who had saved a fortune of ten thousand pounds and hidden it ‘
241398	241422	241257	241257	John	667	’ To her , a French gentleman , who had crammed up his chimney , rather to the detriment of its drawing powers , ‘
241443	241468	241257	241257	John	667	’ as discovered by a chimneysweep after his death . By these steps Mr Wegg arrived at a concluding instance of the human Magpie : ‘
241691	241692	241670	241671	the other	8572	’ ‘
241695	241700	241670	241671	the other	8572	’ cried Mr Boffin . ‘
241713	241719	241766	241766	you	5637	’em , and yet one of ’em
241725	241764	241766	241766	you	5637	’ Mr Venus , who since his introduction to the French gentleman , had been stooping to peer up the chimney , had his attention recalled by the last sentence , and took the liberty of repeating it . ‘
241770	241778	241766	241766	you	5637	’ asked Mr Boffin , turning suddenly . ‘
241786	241787	241766	241766	you	5637	’ ‘
241799	241810	241789	241789	you	5637	’ Mr Venus answered that he found it extremely interesting . ‘
241815	241820	241789	241789	you	5637	’ said Mr Boffin , ‘
241856	241867	241977	241977	you	5637	’ Mr Venus expressed his acknowledgments and accepted the invitation . ‘
241882	241889	241977	241977	you	5637	’ said Mr Boffin , ruminating ; ‘
241893	241894	241896	241896	sir	8755	’ ‘
241898	241921	241896	241896	sir	8755	’ observed Wegg , with a propitiatory face to draw him out , and with another peg at his friend and brother , ‘
241928	241929	241896	241896	sir	8755	’ ‘
241932	241937	241896	241896	sir	8755	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
241943	241971	241977	241977	you	5637	’ Mr Wegg , in a languid transport , again dropped over on Mr Venus , and again recovering himself , masked his emotions with a sneeze . ’
241989	241990	241987	241987	sir	8755	’ ‘
241995	242000	241987	241987	sir	8755	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
242017	242036	241987	241987	sir	8755	’ He was on his knees on the floor in a moment , groping eagerly among the books . ‘
242044	242048	242042	242042	sir	8755	’ asked Wegg . ‘
242060	242074	242051	242051	I	0	’ said Mr Boffin , dusting it with the sleeve of his coat . ‘
242102	242112	242100	242100	Wegg	319	’ Silas took the book and turned the leaves . ‘
242118	242119	242116	242116	sir	8755	’ ‘
242127	242132	242116	242116	sir	8755	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
242141	242142	242116	242116	sir	8755	’ ‘
242160	242161	242166	242166	him	679	’ ‘
242168	242173	242166	242166	him	679	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
242188	242189	242177	242184	a person who swallowed a crown - piece	5648	’ ‘
242194	242199	242177	242184	a person who swallowed a crown - piece	5648	’ asked Mr Boffin . ‘
242206	242214	242204	242204	sir	8755	’ replied Wegg , consulting the text , ‘
242246	242247	242177	242184	a person who swallowed a crown - piece	5648	’ ‘
242252	242257	242177	242184	a person who swallowed a crown - piece	5648	’ cried Mr Boffin . ‘
242261	242262	242177	242184	a person who swallowed a crown - piece	5648	’ ‘
242270	242276	242177	242184	a person who swallowed a crown - piece	5648	’ read Silas Wegg aloud , ‘
242549	242550	242519	242519	he	5667	’ ‘
242553	242558	242519	242519	he	5667	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
242576	242585	242519	242519	he	5667	’ He then added in a slow tone , ‘
242594	242654	242519	242519	he	5667	’ And as he rolled his eyes all round the room , Wegg and Venus likewise rolled their eyes all round the room . And then Wegg , singly , fixed his eyes on Mr Boffin looking at the fire again ; as if he had a mind to spring upon him and demand his thoughts or his life . ‘
242665	242677	242519	242519	he	5667	’ said Mr Boffin , waving his hand after a silence . ‘
242709	242816	242817	242817	I	0	’ While speaking , he thrust his hand into the breast of his outer coat , and struggled with some object there that was too large to be got out easily . What was the stupefaction of the friendly movers when this object at last emerging , proved to be a much - dilapidated dark lantern ! Without at all noticing the effect produced by this little instrument , Mr Boffin stood it on his knee , and , producing a box of matches , deliberately lighted the candle in the lantern , blew out the kindled match , and cast the end into the fire . ‘
242818	242823	242824	242824	he	0	’m going , Wegg , ’
242828	242866	242824	242824	he	0	‘ to take a turn about the place and round the yard . I do n’t want you . Me and this same lantern have taken hundreds — thousands — of such turns in our time together . ’
242867	242903	242904	242904	I	0	‘ But I could n’t think , sir — not on any account , I couldn’t,’—Wegg was politely beginning , when Mr Boffin , who had risen and was going towards the door , stopped : ‘
242917	242996	242915	242915	Wegg	319	’ Wegg looked intelligently thoughtful , as if that had not occurred to his mind until he now brought it to bear on the circumstance . He had nothing for it but to let Mr Boffin go out and shut the door behind him . But , the instant he was on the other side of it , Wegg clutched Venus with both hands , and said in a choking whisper , as if he were being strangled : ‘
243021	243022	243010	243010	he	379	’ ‘
243028	243035	243026	243026	he	379	’ asked Venus , also strangling . ‘
243062	243063	243057	243057	I	0	’ ‘
243069	243091	243066	243066	you	681	’ asked Venus , clutching him with both hands , so that they stood interlocked like a couple of preposterous gladiators . ‘
243121	243159	243112	243112	We	5675	’ Releasing each other , they crept to the door , opened it softly , and peeped out . It was a cloudy night , and the black shadow of the Mounds made the dark yard darker . ‘
243166	243170	243162	243164	a double swindler	5676	’ whispered Wegg , ‘
243198	243237	243238	243238	He	379	’ Cautiously along the path that was bordered by fragments of crockery set in ashes , the two stole after him . They could hear him at his peculiar trot , crushing the loose cinders as he went . ‘
243245	243249	243238	243238	He	379	’ muttered Silas , ‘
243263	243288	243256	243256	his	379	’ But he did turn it on , almost in that same instant , and flashed its light upon the first of the Mounds . ‘
243294	243301	243256	243256	his	379	’ asked Venus in a whisper . ‘
243306	243314	243302	243302	He	379	’ said Silas in the same tone . ‘
243345	243346	243338	243338	he	379	’ ‘
243350	243354	243338	243338	he	379	’ answered Venus . ‘
243374	243375	243356	243356	he	379	’ ‘
243387	243391	243356	243356	he	379	’ suggested Wegg , ‘
243397	243398	243356	243356	he	379	’ ‘
243408	243483	243356	243356	he	379	’ said Venus . Discreet advice too , for he darkened his lantern again , and the mound turned black . After a few seconds , he turned the light on once more , and was seen standing at the foot of the second mound , slowly raising the lantern little by little until he held it up at arm ’s length , as if he were examining the condition of the whole surface . ‘
243492	243496	243356	243356	he	379	’ said Venus . ‘
243499	243503	243356	243356	he	379	’ said Wegg , ‘
243509	243510	243504	243504	he	379	’ ‘
243515	243519	243521	243521	he	379	’ whispered Venus , ‘
243535	243536	243521	243521	he	379	’ ‘
243539	243543	243521	243521	he	379	’ returned Wegg , ‘
243554	243583	243586	243586	he	379	’ This exclamation was elicited by his having turned the lantern off again , and on again , and being visible at the foot of the third mound . ‘
243592	243596	243586	243586	he	379	’ said Venus . ‘
243601	243628	243586	243586	he	379	’ said Wegg . At a nimbler trot , as if the shovel over his shoulder stimulated him by reviving old associations , Mr Boffin ascended the ‘
243631	243744	243747	243747	his	5681	’ , up the Mound which he had described to Silas Wegg on the occasion of their beginning to decline and fall . On striking into it he turned his lantern off . The two followed him , stooping low , so that their figures might make no mark in relief against the sky when he should turn his lantern on again . Mr Venus took the lead , towing Mr Wegg , in order that his refractory leg might be promptly extricated from any pitfalls it should dig for itself . They could just make out that the Golden Dustman stopped to breathe . Of course they stopped too , instantly . ‘
243751	243761	243747	243747	his	5681	’ whispered Wegg , as he recovered his wind , ‘
243765	243766	243747	243747	his	5681	’ ‘
243774	243778	243747	243747	his	5681	’ returned Venus . ‘
243819	243820	243822	243822	he	5681	’ ‘
243827	243841	243822	243822	he	5681	’ said Venus , keeping watch upon his dusky figure all the time , ‘
243848	243946	243822	243822	he	5681	’ He went on again , and they followed again . Gaining the top of the Mound , he turned on his light — but only partially — and stood it on the ground . A bare lopsided weatherbeaten pole was planted in the ashes there , and had been there many a year . Hard by this pole , his lantern stood : lighting a few feet of the lower part of it and a little of the ashy surface around , and then casting off a purposeless little clear trail of light into the air . ‘
243958	243969	243822	243822	he	5681	’ whispered Venus as they dropped low and kept close . ‘
243979	244422	243822	243822	he	5681	’ whispered Wegg . He was going to dig , with whatsoever object , for he tucked up his cuffs and spat on his hands , and then went at it like an old digger as he was . He had no design upon the pole , except that he measured a shovel ’s length from it before beginning , nor was it his purpose to dig deep . Some dozen or so of expert strokes sufficed . Then , he stopped , looked down into the cavity , bent over it , and took out what appeared to be an ordinary case - bottle : one of those squat , high - shouldered , short - necked glass bottles which the Dutchman is said to keep his Courage in . As soon as he had done this , he turned off his lantern , and they could hear that he was filling up the hole in the dark . The ashes being easily moved by a skilful hand , the spies took this as a hint to make off in good time . Accordingly , Mr Venus slipped past Mr Wegg and towed him down . But Mr Wegg ’s descent was not accomplished without some personal inconvenience , for his self - willed leg sticking into the ashes about half way down , and time pressing , Mr Venus took the liberty of hauling him from his tether by the collar : which occasioned him to make the rest of the journey on his back , with his head enveloped in the skirts of his coat , and his wooden leg coming last , like a drag . So flustered was Mr Wegg by this mode of travelling , that when he was set on the level ground with his intellectual developments uppermost , he was quite unconscious of his bearings , and had not the least idea where his place of residence was to be found , until Mr Venus shoved him into it . Even then he staggered round and round , weakly staring about him , until Mr Venus with a hard brush brushed his senses into him and the dust out of him . Mr Boffin came down leisurely , for this brushing process had been well accomplished , and Mr Venus had had time to take his breath , before he reappeared . That he had the bottle somewhere about him could not be doubted ; where , was not so clear . He wore a large rough coat , buttoned over , and it might be in any one of half a dozen pockets . ‘
244430	244435	244428	244428	Wegg	319	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
244444	244464	244436	244436	You	319	’ Mr Wegg replied , with literal exactness , that he felt as if he had had a turn . ‘
244467	244497	244436	244436	You	319	’ said Mr Boffin , blowing out the light in the lantern , shutting it up , and stowing it away in the breast of his coat as before . ‘
244506	244541	244504	244504	Wegg	319	’ Mr Wegg again replied , with strict adherence to truth , that he did n’t think he had ever had a similar sensation in his head , to anything like the same extent . ‘
244550	244555	244436	244436	You	319	’ said Mr Boffin , ‘
244581	244582	244586	244586	sir	8755	’ ‘
244588	244589	244586	244586	sir	8755	’ ‘
244596	244627	244593	244594	the Mounds	10172	’ The friendly movers made such an obvious effort not to look at one another , that they might as well have stared at one another with all their might . ‘
244637	244641	244644	244644	they	10172	’ asked Silas . ‘
244645	244656	244644	244644	they	10172	’re going . Mine ’s as good as gone already . ’
244657	244674	244593	244594	the Mounds	10172	‘ You mean the little one of the three , with the pole atop , sir . ’
244675	244678	244680	244681	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Yes , ’
244701	244719	244680	244681	Mr Boffin	324	‘ It has fetched a penny . It ’ll begin to be carted off to - morrow . ’
244720	244735	244737	244737	Silas	319	‘ Have you been out to take leave of your old friend , sir ? ’
244741	244744	244746	244747	Mr Boffin	324	‘ No , ’
244749	244759	244760	244760	He	5686	‘ What the devil put that in your head ? ’
244804	244810	244812	244812	Wegg	319	‘ No offence , sir , ’
244816	244820	244812	244812	Wegg	319	‘ No offence . ’
244852	244857	244858	244858	he	5686	‘ Good - night , ’
244899	244966	244967	244967	He	5686	’ Avarice , and the evening ’s legends of avarice , and the inflammatory effect of what he had seen , and perhaps the rush of his ill - conditioned blood to his brain in his descent , wrought Silas Wegg to such a pitch of insatiable appetite , that when the door closed he made a swoop at it and drew Venus along with him . ‘
244972	244976	244967	244967	He	5686	’ he cried . ‘
244998	244999	244992	244992	We	5687	’ ‘
245010	245017	245002	245002	you	5686	’ said Venus , restraining him . ‘
245059	245060	245043	245043	you	5686	’ ‘
245075	245087	245066	245066	you	5686	’ muttered Venus , sturdily , clasping him in his arms . ‘
245093	245097	245089	245089	you	5686	’ retorted Wegg . ‘
245164	245422	245423	245423	Brother	658	’ As in his wildness he was making a strong struggle for it , Mr Venus deemed it expedient to lift him , throw him , and fall with him ; well knowing that , once down , he would not be up again easily with his wooden leg . So they both rolled on the floor , and , as they did so , Mr Boffin shut the gate . Chapter 7 THE FRIENDLY MOVE TAKES UP A STRONG POSITION The friendly movers sat upright on the floor , panting and eyeing one another , after Mr Boffin had slammed the gate and gone away . In the weak eyes of Venus , and in every reddish dust - coloured hair in his shock of hair , there was a marked distrust of Wegg and an alertness to fly at him on perceiving the smallest occasion . In the hard - grained face of Wegg , and in his stiff knotty figure ( he looked like a German wooden toy ) , there was expressed a politic conciliation , which had no spontaneity in it . Both were flushed , flustered , and rumpled , by the late scuffle ; and Wegg , in coming to the ground , had received a humming knock on the back of his devoted head , which caused him still to rub it with an air of having been highly — but disagreeably — astonished . Each was silent for some time , leaving it to the other to begin . ‘
245425	245435	245436	245436	you	658	’ said Wegg , at length breaking the silence , ‘
245449	245476	245445	245445	I	0	’ Mr Venus knowingly cocked his shock of hair , as rather thinking Mr Wegg had remembered himself , in respect of appearing without any disguise . ‘
245480	245484	245478	245478	comrade	5569	’ pursued Wegg , ‘
245505	245538	245502	245503	Uncle Parker	323	’ Mr Venus admitted that he had never known those distinguished persons , and added , in effect , that he had never so much as desired the honour of their acquaintance . ‘
245546	245550	245544	245544	comrade	5569	’ retorted Wegg : ‘
245585	245636	245637	245637	Comrade	5569	’ Offering these excusatory words as if they reflected great credit on himself , Mr Wegg impelled himself with his hands towards a chair in a corner of the room , and there , after a variety of awkward gambols , attained a perpendicular position . Mr Venus also rose . ‘
245639	245643	245637	245637	Comrade	5569	’ said Wegg , ‘
245657	245684	245655	245655	yours	5569	’ Mr Venus involuntarily smoothed his countenance , and looked at his hand , as if to see whether any of its speaking properties came off . ‘
245694	245705	245708	245708	I	0	’ pursued Wegg , pointing his words with his forefinger , ‘
245719	245720	245758	245758	your	658	’ ‘
245724	245728	245758	245758	your	658	’ said Venus . ‘
245732	245743	245758	245758	your	658	’ returned Wegg , with a sort of joyful affability , ‘
245804	245808	245800	245800	Your	658	’ said Wegg , ‘
245829	245830	245817	245817	you	658	’ ‘
245837	245841	245833	245833	I	0	’ said Venus . ‘
245850	245860	245833	245833	I	0	’ returned Wegg , with the same joyful candour . ‘
245914	245969	245970	245970	Your	658	’ Having thus elongated and emphasized the word Surprise , Mr Wegg shook his friend and brother by both hands , and then clapped him on both knees , like an affectionate patron who entreated him not to mention so small a service as that which it had been his happy privilege to render . ‘
245974	245978	245970	245970	Your	658	’ said Wegg , ‘
246005	246006	245998	245998	I	0	’ ‘
246009	246019	245998	245998	I	0	’ retorted Venus snappishly , after waiting in vain . ‘
246035	246036	246038	246038	me	0	’ ‘
246041	246045	246046	246046	I	0	’ said Wegg . ‘
246047	246078	246038	246038	me	0	’m a - going to . Hear me out ! Man and brother , partner in feelings equally with undertakings and actions , I have found a cash - box . ’
246079	246082	246046	246046	I	0	‘ Where ? ’
246083	246089	246091	246091	Wegg	319	‘ — Hear me out ! ’
246122	246130	246046	246046	I	0	‘ On a certain day , sir — ’
246131	246134	246136	246136	Venus	379	‘ When ? ’
246139	246144	246136	246136	Venus	379	‘ N — no , ’
246160	246349	246149	246149	his	319	‘ No , sir ! That ’s not your expressive countenance which asks that question . That ’s your voice ; merely your voice . To proceed . On a certain day , sir , I happened to be walking in the yard — taking my lonely round — for in the words of a friend of my own family , the author of All ’s Well arranged as a duett : “ Deserted , as you will remember , Mr Venus , by the waning moon , When stars , it will occur to you before I mention it , proclaim night ’s cheerless noon , On tower , fort , or tented ground , The sentry walks his lonely round , The sentry walks ; ” — under those circumstances , sir , I happened to be walking in the yard early one afternoon , and happened to have an iron rod in my hand , with which I have been sometimes accustomed to beguile the monotony of a literary life , when I struck it against an object not necessary to trouble you by naming — ’
246350	246358	246360	246360	Venus	379	‘ It is necessary . What object ? ’
246367	246373	246375	246375	Wegg	319	‘ — Hear me out ! ’
246377	246435	246375	246375	Wegg	319	‘ The Pump.—When I struck it against the Pump , and found , not only that the top was loose and opened with a lid , but that something in it rattled . That something , comrade , I discovered to be a small flat oblong cash - box . Shall I say it was disappointingly light ? ’
246436	246443	246445	246445	Venus	379	‘ There were papers in it , ’
246447	246455	246457	246457	Wegg	319	‘ There your expressive countenance speaks indeed ! ’
246459	246499	246457	246457	Wegg	319	‘ A paper . The box was locked , tied up , and sealed , and on the outside was a parchment label , with the writing , “ MY WILL , JOHN HARMON , TEMPORARILY DEPOSITED HERE . ” ’
246500	246507	246509	246509	Venus	379	‘ We must know its contents , ’
246511	246517	246519	246519	Wegg	319	‘ — Hear me out ! ’
246521	246533	246519	246519	Wegg	319	‘ I said so , and I broke the box open . ’
246534	246540	246542	246542	Venus	379	‘ Without coming to me ! ’
246544	246550	246552	246552	Wegg	319	‘ Exactly so , sir ! ’
246558	246681	246552	246552	Wegg	319	‘ I see I take you with me ! Hear , hear , hear ! Resolved , as your discriminating good sense perceives , that if you was to have a sap — pur — IZE , it should be a complete one ! Well , sir . And so , as you have honoured me by anticipating , I examined the document . Regularly executed , regularly witnessed , very short . Inasmuch as he has never made friends , and has ever had a rebellious family , he , John Harmon , gives to Nicodemus Boffin the Little Mound , which is quite enough for him , and gives the whole rest and residue of his property to the Crown . ’
246682	246698	246700	246700	Venus	379	‘ The date of the will that has been proved , must be looked to , ’
246702	246711	246700	246700	Venus	379	‘ It may be later than this one . ’
246712	246718	246720	246720	Wegg	319	‘ — Hear me out ! ’
246722	246774	246776	246776	Wegg	319	‘ I said so . I paid a shilling ( never mind your sixpence of it ) to look up that will . Brother , that will is dated months before this will . And now , as a fellow - man , and as a partner in a friendly move , ’
246794	246817	246776	246776	Wegg	319	‘ say have I completed my labour of love to your perfect satisfaction , and are you sap — pur — IZED ? ’
246836	246899	246818	246819	Mr Venus	379	‘ This is great news indeed , Mr Wegg . There ’s no denying it . But I could have wished you had told it me before you got your fright to - night , and I could have wished you had ever asked me as your partner what we were to do , before you thought you were dividing a responsibility . ’
246900	246906	246908	246908	Wegg	319	‘ — Hear me out ! ’
246910	246937	246908	246908	Wegg	319	‘ I knew you was a - going to say so . But alone I bore the anxiety , and alone I ’ll bear the blame ! ’
246946	246949	246951	246951	Venus	379	‘ No , ’
246953	246963	246951	246951	Venus	379	‘ Let ’s see this will and this box . ’
246964	246971	246973	246973	Wegg	319	‘ Do I understand , brother , ’
246978	246992	246973	246973	Wegg	319	‘ that it is your wish to see this will and this — ? ’
247002	247008	247010	247010	Wegg	319	‘ — Hear me out ! ’
247012	247022	247010	247010	Wegg	319	‘ Hear me out ! I ’ll go and fetch ’em
247024	247085	247010	247010	Wegg	319	’ After being some time absent , as if in his covetousness he could hardly make up his mind to produce the treasure to his partner , he returned with an old leathern hat - box , into which he had put the other box , for the better preservation of commonplace appearances , and for the disarming of suspicion . ‘
247096	247107	247010	247010	Wegg	319	’ said Silas in a low voice , looking around : ‘
247136	247137	247180	247180	I	0	’ ‘
247144	247148	247180	247180	I	0	’ assented Venus . ‘
247154	247177	247180	247180	I	0	’ Jealous of the custody of the box , and yet fearful of opening it under the existing circumstances , Wegg hesitated . ‘
247184	247190	247180	247180	I	0	’ repeated Venus , chafing , ‘
247195	247214	247180	247180	I	0	’ Not very well seeing his way to a refusal , Mr Wegg then rejoined in a gush , ‘
247220	247330	247180	247180	I	0	’ So he locked up the Bower and they set forth : Mr Venus taking his arm , and keeping it with remarkable tenacity . They found the usual dim light burning in the window of Mr Venus ’s establishment , imperfectly disclosing to the public the usual pair of preserved frogs , sword in hand , with their point of honour still unsettled . Mr Venus had closed his shop door on coming out , and now opened it with the key and shut it again as soon as they were within ; but not before he had put up and barred the shutters of the shop window . ‘
247341	247346	247331	247332	No one	1150	’ said he then , ‘
247357	247579	247331	247332	No one	1150	’ So he raked together the yet warm cinders in the rusty grate , and made a fire , and trimmed the candle on the little counter . As the fire cast its flickering gleams here and there upon the dark greasy walls ; the Hindoo baby , the African baby , the articulated English baby , the assortment of skulls , and the rest of the collection , came starting to their various stations as if they had all been out , like their master and were punctual in a general rendezvous to assist at the secret . The French gentleman had grown considerably since Mr Wegg last saw him , being now accommodated with a pair of legs and a head , though his arms were yet in abeyance . To whomsoever the head had originally belonged , Silas Wegg would have regarded it as a personal favour if he had not cut quite so many teeth . Silas took his seat in silence on the wooden box before the fire , and Venus dropping into his low chair produced from among his skeleton hands , his tea - tray and tea - cups , and put the kettle on . Silas inwardly approved of these preparations , trusting they might end in Mr Venus ’s diluting his intellect . ‘
247584	247588	247740	247740	sir	8755	’ said Venus , ‘
247601	247680	247682	247682	I	0	’ With still reluctant hands , and not without several glances towards the skeleton hands , as if he mistrusted that a couple of them might spring forth and clutch the document , Wegg opened the hat - box and revealed the cash - box , opened the cash - box and revealed the will . He held a corner of it tight , while Venus , taking hold of another corner , searchingly and attentively read it . ‘
247692	247699	247682	247682	I	0	’ said Mr Wegg at length . ‘
247705	247737	247702	247702	you	5679	’ said Mr Venus . Mr Wegg thereupon made an easy , graceful movement , as though he would fold it up ; but Mr Venus held on by his corner . ‘
247742	247756	247740	247740	sir	8755	’ said Mr Venus , winking his weak eyes and shaking his head . ‘
247791	247792	247778	247778	you	5679	’ ‘
247796	247800	247793	247793	I	0	’ said Wegg . ‘
247807	247811	247805	247805	partner	5679	’ retorted Venus . ‘
247852	247853	247856	247856	you	5679	’ ‘
247859	247865	247856	247856	you	5679	’ said Wegg , quickly . ‘
247871	247877	247866	247866	I	0	’ replied Venus , slowly , ‘
247931	247932	247935	247935	you	0	’ ‘
247941	247946	247935	247935	you	0	’ asked Wegg again . ‘
247956	247963	247947	247947	I	0	’ said Mr Venus , placidly , ‘
248019	248020	248021	248022	No man	8713	’ ‘
248025	248036	248021	248022	No man	8713	’ assented Mr Wegg , with a somewhat staggered air . ‘
248046	248050	248053	248053	you	5724	’ said Venus , ‘
248065	248086	248021	248022	No man	8713	’re sitting . There ’s the Miscellanies of several human specimens , in the lovely compo - one behind the door ’
248096	248110	248092	248094	the French gentleman	1861	‘ It still wants a pair of arms . I DON’T say that I ’m
248115	248117	248021	248022	No man	8713	’em . ’
248118	248129	248130	248130	Silas	319	‘ You must be wandering in your mind , partner , ’
248133	248142	248130	248130	Silas	319	‘ You ’ll excuse me if I wander , ’
248146	248180	248144	248144	Venus	379	‘ I am sometimes rather subject to it . I like my art , and I know how to exercise my art , and I mean to have the keeping of this document . ’
248181	248195	248197	248197	Wegg	319	‘ But what has that got to do with your art , partner ? ’
248233	248243	248226	248226	himself	379	‘ She ’ll bile in a couple of minutes . ’
248326	248329	248331	248331	Wegg	319	‘ Partner , ’
248339	248355	248331	248331	Wegg	319	‘ I propose that we cut it in half , and each keep a half . ’
248367	248385	248356	248356	Venus	379	‘ It would n’t do to mutilate it , partner . It might seem to be cancelled . ’
248386	248389	248391	248391	Wegg	319	‘ Partner , ’
248405	248414	248391	248391	Wegg	319	‘ do n’t your speaking countenance say that you ’re
248424	248435	248391	248391	Wegg	319	’ Venus shook his shock of hair as he replied , ‘
248478	248502	248470	248470	I	0	’ Silas hesitated a little longer , and then suddenly releasing his corner , and resuming his buoyant and benignant tone , exclaimed , ‘
248519	248534	248538	248538	his	0	’re welcome to it , partner , in a spirit of trust and confidence . ’
248587	248595	248584	248584	He	379	‘ A cup of tea , partner ? ’
248602	248607	248584	248584	He	379	‘ Thank’ee , partner , ’
248617	248620	248622	248622	Venus	379	‘ Next , ’
248641	248654	248622	248622	Venus	379	‘ comes the question , What ’s the course to be pursued ? ’
248820	248823	248799	248799	he	319	‘ Halves ! ’
248831	248834	248799	248799	he	319	‘ Halves ! ’
249226	249229	249230	249230	he	319	‘ Halves ! ’
249396	249399	249401	249401	Wegg	319	‘ Brother , ’
249410	249440	249401	249401	Wegg	319	‘ I should like to ask you something . You remember the night when I first looked in here , and found you floating your powerful mind in tea ? ’
249450	249458	249460	249460	Wegg	319	‘ And there you sit , sir , ’
249468	249590	249592	249593	Mr Wegg	319	‘ as if you had never left off ! There you sit , sir , as if you had an unlimited capacity of assimilating the flagrant article ! There you sit , sir , in the midst of your works , looking as if you ’d been called upon for Home , Sweet Home , and was obleeging the company ! “ A exile from home splendour dazzles in vain , O give you your lowly Preparations again , The birds stuffed so sweetly that ca n’t be expected to come at your call , Give you these with the peace of mind dearer than all . Home , Home , Home , sweet Home ! ” — Be it ever , ’
249603	249618	249592	249593	Mr Wegg	319	‘ ever so ghastly , all things considered there ’s no place like it . ’
249619	249636	249638	249638	Venus	379	‘ You said you ’d like to ask something ; but you have n’t asked it , ’
249645	249651	249653	249653	Wegg	319	‘ Your peace of mind , ’
249658	249672	249592	249593	Mr Wegg	319	‘ your peace of mind was in a poor way that night . HOW ’S
249684	249685	249686	249686	She	5761	’ ‘
249691	249706	249686	249686	She	5761	’ replied Mr Venus with a comical mixture of indignant obstinacy and tender melancholy , ‘
249730	249731	249738	249738	me	0	’ ‘
249740	249761	249738	249738	me	0	’ exclaimed Wegg with a sigh , but eyeing him while pretending to keep him company in eyeing the fire , ‘
249809	249810	249811	249812	Her father	1004	’ ‘
249814	249826	249811	249812	Her father	1004	’ rejoined Venus , and then stopped to swallow more tea , ‘
249835	249836	249811	249812	Her father	1004	’ ‘
249849	249855	249837	249837	You	319	’ observed Wegg , pensively . ‘

249872	249873	249869	249870	Pleasant Riderhood	594	’ ‘
249878	249882	249883	249884	Pleasant Riderhood	594	’ cried Wegg . ‘

249963	249994	249954	249954	I	0	’ said Venus , taking another gulp of tea and mournfully winking at the fire—‘looking for parrots’—taking another gulp and stopping . Mr Wegg hinted , to jog his attention : ‘
250012	250013	249954	249954	I	0	’ ‘
250020	250025	249954	249954	I	0	’ said Venus fretfully . ‘

250058	250059	250056	250056	sir	8755	’ ‘
250174	250189	250190	250191	Mr Wegg	319	’em as mine . To such an extent have I fallen off under it . ’
250209	250217	250218	250218	he	319	‘ Why I remember , Mr Venus , ’
250226	250266	250288	250288	his	379	‘ ( for I remember every word that falls from you , sir ) , I remember that you said that night , you had got up there — and then your words was , “ Never mind . ” ’
250267	250277	250279	250279	Venus	379	‘ — The parrot that I bought of her , ’
250291	250330	250279	250279	Venus	379	‘ Yes ; there it lies on its side , dried up ; except for its plumage , very like myself . I ’ve never had the heart to prepare it , and I never shall have now . ’
250653	250663	250665	250665	Wegg	319	‘ There ’ll shortly be an end of YOU , ’
250675	250681	250682	250683	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ YOUR varnish is fading . ’
250689	250700	250702	250702	Wegg	319	‘ Look out for a fall , my Lady Dustwoman , ’
250714	250720	250722	250722	Wegg	319	‘ How brisk we are ! ’

You might be took with your deadness again , half a mile off — or half of half a quarter , for the matter of that — and then it would be asked , Why did that there honest Deputy Lock , let her go , instead of putting her safe with the Parish ? That ’s what a man of his character ought to have done , it would be argueyfied , ’
254687	254712	254673	254675	the Deputy Lock	13184	‘ he ought to have handed her over safe to the Parish . That was to be expected of a man of his merits . ’

254837	254846	254824	254824	he	13184	‘ might you call a morsel of money ? ’
254873	254891	254893	254894	the Deputy	13197	‘ If I was to let you go instead of handing you over safe to the Parish , ’
254903	254918	254893	254894	the Deputy	13197	‘ might it be your own free wish to leave that there behind you ? ’
254919	254933	254900	254900	his	13197	‘ Take it , Master , take it , and welcome and thankful ! ’
254934	254936	254893	254894	the Deputy	13197	‘ I ’m
254940	254960	254893	254894	the Deputy	13197	’ said the Deputy , giving her back the letter , and pocketing the coins , one by one , ‘
254972	255002	255004	255004	I	0	’ here he drew his sleeve across his forehead , as if this particular portion of his humble gains were the result of sheer hard labour and virtuous industry ; ‘
255017	255162	254900	254900	his	13197	’ She was gone out of the Lock - house as soon as he gave her this permission , and her tottering steps were on the road again . But , afraid to go back and afraid to go forward ; seeing what she fled from , in the sky - glare of the lights of the little town before her , and leaving a confused horror of it everywhere behind her , as if she had escaped it in every stone of every market - place ; she struck off by side ways , among which she got bewildered and lost . That night she took refuge from the Samaritan in his latest accredited form , under a farmer ’s rick ; and if — worth thinking of , perhaps , my fellow - Christians — the Samaritan had in the lonely night , ‘
255169	255510	255511	255511	She	5943	’ , she would have most devoutly thanked High Heaven for her escape from him . The morning found her afoot again , but fast declining as to the clearness of her thoughts , though not as to the steadiness of her purpose . Comprehending that her strength was quitting her , and that the struggle of her life was almost ended , she could neither reason out the means of getting back to her protectors , nor even form the idea . The overmastering dread , and the proud stubborn resolution it engendered in her to die undegraded , were the two distinct impressions left in her failing mind . Supported only by a sense that she was bent on conquering in her life - long fight , she went on . The time was come , now , when the wants of this little life were passing away from her . She could not have swallowed food , though a table had been spread for her in the next field . The day was cold and wet , but she scarcely knew it . She crept on , poor soul , like a criminal afraid of being taken , and felt little beyond the terror of falling down while it was yet daylight , and being found alive . She had no fear that she would live through another night . Sewn in the breast of her gown , the money to pay for her burial was still intact . If she could wear through the day , and then lie down to die under cover of the darkness , she would die independent . If she were captured previously , the money would be taken from her as a pauper who had no right to it , and she would be carried to the accursed workhouse . Gaining her end , the letter would be found in her breast , along with the money , and the gentlefolks would say when it was given back to them , ‘
255551	255690	255531	255531	she	5943	’ Most illogical , inconsequential , and light - headed , this ; but travellers in the valley of the shadow of death are apt to be light - headed ; and worn - out old people of low estate have a trick of reasoning as indifferently as they live , and doubtless would appreciate our Poor Law more philosophically on an income of ten thousand a year . So , keeping to byways , and shunning human approach , this troublesome old woman hid herself , and fared on all through the dreary day . Yet so unlike was she to vagrant hiders in general , that sometimes , as the day advanced , there was a bright fire in her eyes , and a quicker beating at her feeble heart , as though she said exultingly , ‘
255699	255779	255691	255692	The Lord	10107	’ By what visionary hands she was led along upon that journey of escape from the Samaritan ; by what voices , hushed in the grave , she seemed to be addressed ; how she fancied the dead child in her arms again , and times innumerable adjusted her shawl to keep it warm ; what infinite variety of forms of tower and roof and steeple the trees took ; how many furious horsemen rode at her , crying , ‘
255791	255846	255788	255789	Betty Higden	505	’ and melted away as they came close ; be these things left untold . Faring on and hiding , hiding and faring on , the poor harmless creature , as though she were a Murderess and the whole country were up after her , wore out the day , and gained the night . ‘
255855	255958	255788	255789	Betty Higden	505	’ she had sometimes murmured , on the day ’s pilgrimage , when she had raised her head and taken any note of the real objects about her . There now arose in the darkness , a great building , full of lighted windows . Smoke was issuing from a high chimney in the rear of it , and there was the sound of a water - wheel at the side . Between her and the building , lay a piece of water , in which the lighted windows were reflected , and on its nearest margin was a plantation of trees . ‘

255990	256117	255959	255959	I	0	’ She crept among the trees to the trunk of a tree whence she could see , beyond some intervening trees and branches , the lighted windows , both in their reality and their reflection in the water . She placed her orderly little basket at her side , and sank upon the ground , supporting herself against the tree . It brought to her mind the foot of the Cross , and she committed herself to Him who died upon it . Her strength held out to enable her to arrange the letter in her breast , so as that it could be seen that she had a paper there . It had held out for this , and it departed when this was done . ‘

And Sloppy — on whom the brave deceased had never turned her back until she ran away from him , knowing that otherwise he would not be separated from her — Sloppy could not in his conscience as yet find the hearty thanks required of it . Selfish in Sloppy , and yet excusable , it may be humbly hoped , because our sister had been more than his mother . The words were read above the ashes of Betty Higden , in a corner of a churchyard near the river ; in a churchyard so obscure that there was nothing in it but grass - mounds , not so much as one single tombstone . It might not be to do an unreasonably great deal for the diggers and hewers , in a registering age , if we ticketed their graves at the common charge ; so that a new generation might know which was which : so that the soldier , sailor , emigrant , coming home , should be able to identify the resting - place of father , mother , playmate , or betrothed . For , we turn up our eyes and say that we are all alike in death , and we might turn them down and work the saying out in this world , so far . It would be sentimental , perhaps ? But how say ye , my lords and gentleman and honourable boards , shall we not find good standing - room left for a little sentiment , if we look into our crowds ? Near unto the Reverend Frank Milvey as he read , stood his little wife , John Rokesmith the Secretary , and Bella Wilfer . These , over and above Sloppy , were the mourners at the lowly grave . Not a penny had been added to the money sewn in her dress : what her honest spirit had so long projected , was fulfilled . ‘
257393	257412	257385	257385	I	0	’ said Sloppy , laying it , inconsolable , against the church door , when all was done : ‘
257443	257496	257497	257497	SHE	5972	’ The Reverend Frank Milvey , comforting Sloppy , expounded to him how the best of us were more or less remiss in our turnings at our respective Mangles — some of us very much so — and how we were all a halting , failing , feeble , and inconstant crew . ‘
257502	257520	257497	257497	SHE	5972	’ said Sloppy , taking this ghostly counsel rather ill , in behalf of his late benefactress . ‘
257587	257624	257559	257559	she	5972	’ With those heartfelt words , Sloppy removed his dejected head from the church door , and took it back to the grave in the corner , and laid it down there , and wept alone . ‘
257631	257645	257559	257559	she	5972	’ said the Reverend Frank Milvey , brushing his hand across his eyes , ‘
257674	257816	257817	257817	I	0	’ They left him undisturbed , and passed out at the wicket - gate . The water - wheel of the paper - mill was audible there , and seemed to have a softening influence on the bright wintry scene . They had arrived but a little while before , and Lizzie Hexam now told them the little she could add to the letter in which she had enclosed Mr Rokesmith ’s letter and had asked for their instructions . This was merely how she had heard the groan , and what had afterwards passed , and how she had obtained leave for the remains to be placed in that sweet , fresh , empty store - room of the mill from which they had just accompanied them to the churchyard , and how the last requests had been religiously observed . ‘
257832	257836	257817	257817	I	0	’ said Lizzie . ‘
257859	257860	257863	257867	the Jew who received us	5985	’ ‘
257869	257875	257863	257867	the Jew who received us	5985	’ said Mrs Milvey . ( ‘
257879	257886	257863	257867	the Jew who received us	5985	’ observed her husband in parenthesis , ‘
257890	257892	257893	257894	The gentleman	1107	’ ) ‘
257900	257904	257893	257894	The gentleman	1107	’ said Lizzie , ‘
257941	257942	257929	257929	I	0	’ ‘
257951	257969	257945	257945	they	5992	’ suggested Mrs Milvey , bristling in her good little way , as a clergyman ’s wife . ‘
257976	257985	257945	257945	they	5992	’ asked Lizzie , with a modest smile . ‘
257993	258006	258007	258007	They	5992	’ said Mrs Milvey . Lizzie shook her head , still smiling . ‘
258094	258095	258084	258084	they	5992	’ ‘
258102	258109	258111	258113	little Mrs Milvey	413	’re a favourite , my dear , ’
258119	258133	258135	258135	Lizzie	246	‘ It would be very ungrateful in me to say I am not , ’
258137	258215	258135	258135	Lizzie	246	‘ for I have been already raised to a place of confidence here . But that makes no difference in their following their own religion and leaving all of us to ours . They never talk of theirs to us , and they never talk of ours to us . If I was the last in the mill , it would be just the same . They never asked me what religion that poor thing had followed . ’
258216	258220	258222	258223	Mrs Milvey	413	‘ My dear , ’
258231	258240	258222	258223	Mrs Milvey	413	‘ I wish you would talk to her . ’
258241	258245	258247	258249	the Reverend Frank	412	‘ My dear , ’
258257	258292	258247	258249	the Reverend Frank	412	‘ I think I will leave it to somebody else . The circumstances are hardly favourable . There are plenty of talkers going about , my love , and she will soon find one . ’
258566	258582	258561	258561	Bella	307	‘ Had n’t we better talk about the commission we have undertaken , Mr Rokesmith ? ’
258583	258588	258590	258591	the Secretary	2769	‘ By all means , ’
258593	258597	258590	258591	the Secretary	2769	‘ I suppose , ’
258601	258616	258590	258591	the Secretary	2769	‘ that we ARE both commissioned , or we should n’t both be here ? ’
258617	258622	258624	258625	the Secretary	2769	‘ I suppose so , ’
258629	258641	258643	258643	Bella	307	‘ When I proposed to come with Mr and Mrs Milvey , ’
258645	258702	258643	258643	Bella	307	‘ Mrs Boffin urged me to do so , in order that I might give her my small report — it ’s not worth anything , Mr Rokesmith , except for it ’s being a woman’s — which indeed with you may be a fresh reason for it ’s being worth nothing — of Lizzie Hexam . ’
258703	258707	258709	258710	the Secretary	2769	‘ Mr Boffin , ’
258712	258722	258709	258710	the Secretary	2769	‘ directed me to come for the same purpose . ’
258742	258752	258754	258754	Bella	307	‘ You think well of her , Mr Rokesmith ? ’
258763	258770	258754	258754	Bella	307	‘ I think highly of her . ’
258771	258790	258709	258710	the Secretary	2769	‘ I am so glad of that ! Something quite refined in her beauty , is there not ? ’
258791	258798	258754	258754	Bella	307	‘ Her appearance is very striking . ’
258799	258833	258835	258835	Bella	307	‘ There is a shade of sadness upon her that is quite touching . At least I — I am not setting up my own poor opinion , you know , Mr Rokesmith , ’
258847	258853	258835	258835	Bella	307	‘ I am consulting you . ’
258854	258866	258868	258869	the Secretary	2769	‘ I noticed that sadness . I hope it may not , ’
258875	258888	258868	258869	the Secretary	2769	‘ be the result of the false accusation which has been retracted . ’
258915	258948	258900	258900	Bella	307	‘ Oh , Mr Rokesmith , do n’t be hard with me , do n’t be stern with me ; be magnanimous ! I want to talk with you on equal terms . ’
258958	258992	258949	258950	The Secretary	2769	‘ Upon my honour I had no thought but for you . I forced myself to be constrained , lest you might misinterpret my being more natural . There . It ’s gone . ’
258993	258997	258999	258999	Bella	307	‘ Thank you , ’
259007	259011	258999	258999	Bella	307	‘ Forgive me . ’
259012	259015	259017	259018	the Secretary	2769	‘ No ! ’
259022	259026	259017	259018	the Secretary	2769	‘ Forgive ME ! ’
259070	259079	259081	259082	the Secretary	2769	‘ You were going to speak to me , ’
259098	259118	259081	259082	the Secretary	2769	‘ about Lizzie Hexam . So was I going to speak to you , if I could have begun . ’
259119	259128	259130	259130	Bella	307	‘ Now that you CAN begin , sir , ’
259150	259158	259137	259137	she	307	‘ what were you going to say ? ’
259159	259207	259208	259208	Bella	307	‘ You remember , of course , that in her short letter to Mrs Boffin — short , but containing everything to the purpose — she stipulated that either her name , or else her place of residence , must be kept strictly a secret among us . ’
259212	259275	259208	259208	Bella	307	‘ It is my duty to find out why she made that stipulation . I have it in charge from Mr Boffin to discover , and I am very desirous for myself to discover , whether that retracted accusation still leaves any stain upon her . I mean whether it places her at any disadvantage towards any one , even towards herself . ’
259276	259279	259281	259281	Bella	307	‘ Yes , ’
259286	259297	259281	259281	Bella	307	‘ I understand . That seems wise , and considerate . ’
259298	259346	259208	259208	Bella	307	‘ You may not have noticed , Miss Wilfer , that she has the same kind of interest in you , that you have in her . Just as you are attracted by her beaut — by her appearance and manner , she is attracted by yours . ’
259347	259355	259357	259357	Bella	307	‘ I certainly have NOT noticed it , ’
259365	259375	259376	259377	The Secretary	2769	‘ and I should have given her credit for — ’
259389	259394	259383	259383	his	2769	‘ not for better taste ’
259412	259416	259418	259419	the Secretary	2769	‘ And so , ’
259421	259526	259528	259529	the Secretary	2769	‘ if you would speak with her alone before we go away from here , I feel quite sure that a natural and easy confidence would arise between you . Of course you would not be asked to betray it ; and of course you would not , if you were . But if you do not object to put this question to her — to ascertain for us her own feeling in this one matter — you can do so at a far greater advantage than I or any else could . Mr Boffin is anxious on the subject . And I am , ’
259534	259543	259528	259529	the Secretary	2769	‘ for a special reason , very anxious . ’
259544	259553	259555	259555	Bella	307	‘ I shall be happy , Mr Rokesmith , ’
259557	259587	259555	259555	Bella	307	‘ to be of the least use ; for I feel , after the serious scene of to - day , that I am useless enough in this world . ’
259588	259594	259596	259597	the Secretary	2769	‘ Do n’t say that , ’
259599	259607	259609	259609	Bella	307	‘ Oh , but I mean that , ’
259615	259624	259626	259627	the Secretary	2769	‘ No one is useless in this world , ’
259629	259641	259626	259627	the Secretary	2769	‘ who lightens the burden of it for any one else . ’
259642	259653	259655	259655	Bella	307	‘ But I assure you I DON’T , Mr Rokesmith , ’
259661	259667	259655	259655	Bella	307	‘ Not for your father ? ’
259668	259690	259626	259627	the Secretary	2769	‘ Dear , loving , self - forgetting , easily - satisfied Pa ! Oh , yes ! He thinks so . ’
259691	259701	259703	259704	the Secretary	2769	‘ It is enough if he only thinks so , ’
259706	259721	259703	259704	the Secretary	2769	‘ Excuse the interruption : I do n’t like to hear you depreciate yourself . ’
259722	259731	259733	259733	Bella	307	‘ But YOU once depreciated ME , sir , ’
259737	259754	259733	259733	Bella	307	‘ and I hope you may be satisfied with the consequences you brought upon your head ! ’
259773	259841	259764	259764	she	307	‘ Mr Rokesmith , it seems so long since we spoke together naturally , that I am embarrassed in approaching another subject . Mr Boffin . You know I am very grateful to him ; do n’t you ? You know I feel a true respect for him , and am bound to him by the strong ties of his own generosity ; now do n’t you ? ’
259842	259854	259764	259764	she	307	‘ Unquestionably . And also that you are his favourite companion . ’
259855	259860	259862	259862	Bella	307	‘ That makes it , ’
259864	259880	259862	259862	Bella	307	‘ so very difficult to speak of him . But—. Does he treat you well ? ’
259881	259889	259890	259891	the Secretary	2769	‘ You see how he treats me , ’
259902	259912	259914	259914	Bella	307	‘ Yes , and I see it with pain , ’
259950	259957	259959	259959	Bella	307	‘ I see it with pain , ’
259961	260013	259959	259959	Bella	307	‘ and it often makes me miserable . Miserable , because I can not bear to be supposed to approve of it , or have any indirect share in it . Miserable , because I can not bear to be forced to admit to myself that Fortune is spoiling Mr Boffin . ’
260014	260018	260020	260021	the Secretary	2769	‘ Miss Wilfer , ’
260028	260064	260020	260021	the Secretary	2769	‘ if you could know with what delight I make the discovery that Fortune is n’t spoiling YOU , you would know that it more than compensates me for any slight at any other hands . ’
260065	260074	260076	260076	Bella	307	‘ Oh , do n’t speak of ME , ’
260088	260098	260076	260076	Bella	307	‘ You do n’t know me as well as — ’
260099	260105	260107	260108	the Secretary	2769	‘ As you know yourself ? ’
260115	260121	260107	260108	the Secretary	2769	‘ DO you know yourself ? ’
260122	260130	260132	260132	Bella	307	‘ I know quite enough of myself , ’
260150	260163	260132	260132	Bella	307	‘ and I do n’t improve upon acquaintance . But Mr Boffin . ’
260164	260186	260188	260189	the Secretary	2769	‘ That Mr Boffin ’s manner to me , or consideration for me , is not what it used to be , ’
260191	260204	260188	260189	the Secretary	2769	‘ must be admitted . It is too plain to be denied . ’
260205	260216	260218	260218	Bella	307	‘ Are you disposed to deny it , Mr Rokesmith ? ’
260226	260250	260218	260218	Bella	307	‘ Ought I not to be glad to do so , if I could : though it were only for my own sake ? ’
260251	260254	260256	260256	Bella	307	‘ Truly , ’
260258	260289	260256	260256	Bella	307	‘ it must try you very much , and — you must please promise me that you wo n’t take ill what I am going to add , Mr Rokesmith ? ’
260290	260299	260333	260333	his	2769	‘ I promise it with all my heart . ’
260300	260311	260313	260313	Bella	307	‘ — And it must sometimes , I should think , ’
260317	260327	260313	260313	Bella	307	‘ a little lower you in your own estimation ? ’
260350	260446	260346	260347	the Secretary	2769	‘ I have very strong reasons , Miss Wilfer , for bearing with the drawbacks of my position in the house we both inhabit . Believe that they are not all mercenary , although I have , through a series of strange fatalities , faded out of my place in life . If what you see with such a gracious and good sympathy is calculated to rouse my pride , there are other considerations ( and those you do not see ) urging me to quiet endurance . The latter are by far the stronger . ’
260447	260457	260459	260459	Bella	307	‘ I think I have noticed , Mr Rokesmith , ’
260474	260490	260459	260459	Bella	307	‘ that you repress yourself , and force yourself , to act a passive part . ’
260491	260524	260346	260347	the Secretary	2769	‘ You are right . I repress myself and force myself to act a part . It is not in tameness of spirit that I submit . I have a settled purpose . ’
260525	260534	260536	260536	Bella	307	‘ And a good one , I hope , ’
260538	260547	260548	260548	he	2769	‘ And a good one , I hope , ’
260556	260564	260566	260566	Bella	307	‘ Sometimes I have fancied , sir , ’
260573	260589	260566	260566	Bella	307	‘ that your great regard for Mrs Boffin is a very powerful motive with you . ’
260590	260626	260346	260347	the Secretary	2769	‘ You are right again ; it is . I would do anything for her , bear anything for her . There are no words to express how I esteem that good , good woman . ’
260627	260644	260566	260566	Bella	307	‘ As I do too ! May I ask you one thing more , Mr Rokesmith ? ’
260645	260649	260566	260566	Bella	307	‘ Anything more . ’
260650	260669	260346	260347	the Secretary	2769	‘ Of course you see that she really suffers , when Mr Boffin shows how he is changing ? ’
260670	260691	260566	260566	Bella	307	‘ I see it , every day , as you see it , and am grieved to give her pain . ’
260692	260698	260700	260700	Bella	307	‘ To give her pain ? ’
260712	260722	260700	260700	Bella	307	‘ I am generally the unfortunate cause of it . ’
260723	260750	260566	260566	Bella	307	‘ Perhaps she says to you , as she often says to me , that he is the best of men , in spite of all . ’
260751	260771	260773	260774	the Secretary	2769	‘ I often overhear her , in her honest and beautiful devotion to him , saying so to you , ’
260782	260796	260773	260774	the Secretary	2769	‘ but I can not assert that she ever says so to me . ’
261121	261133	261135	261135	Lizzie	246	‘ I am afraid it is a poor room for you , ’
261154	261165	261167	261167	Bella	307	‘ Not so poor as you think , my dear , ’
261169	261175	261167	261167	Bella	307	‘ if you knew all . ’
261299	261307	261309	261309	Lizzie	246	‘ It ’s quite new to me , ’
261311	261343	261309	261309	Lizzie	246	‘ to be visited by a lady so nearly of my own age , and so pretty , as you . It ’s a pleasure to me to look at you . ’
261344	261353	261355	261355	Bella	307	‘ I have nothing left to begin with , ’
261359	261392	261355	261355	Bella	307	‘ because I was going to say that it was a pleasure to me to look at you , Lizzie . But we can begin without a beginning , ca n’t we ? ’
261410	261415	261417	261417	Bella	307	‘ Now , dear , ’
261441	261503	261417	261417	Bella	307	‘ I am commissioned with something to say , and I dare say I shall say it wrong , but I wo n’t if I can help it . It is in reference to your letter to Mr and Mrs Boffin , and this is what it is . Let me see . Oh yes ! This is what it is . ’
261552	261559	261561	261561	Bella	307	‘ I feel , my dear , ’
261579	261674	261561	261561	Bella	307	‘ that the subject must be a painful one to you , but I am mixed up in it also ; for — I do n’t know whether you may know it or suspect it — I am the willed - away girl who was to have been married to the unfortunate gentleman , if he had been pleased to approve of me . So I was dragged into the subject without my consent , and you were dragged into it without your consent , and there is very little to choose between us . ’
261675	261681	261683	261683	Lizzie	246	‘ I had no doubt , ’
261685	261708	261683	261683	Lizzie	246	‘ that you were the Miss Wilfer I have often heard named . Can you tell me who my unknown friend is ? ’
261709	261716	261718	261718	Bella	307	‘ Unknown friend , my dear ? ’
261720	261739	261718	261718	Bella	307	‘ Who caused the charge against poor father to be contradicted , and sent me the written paper . ’
261754	261764	261766	261766	Lizzie	246	‘ I should have been glad to thank him , ’
261768	261800	261766	261766	Lizzie	246	‘ He has done a great deal for me . I must hope that he will let me thank him some day . You asked me has it anything to do — ’
261801	261808	261809	261809	Bella	307	‘ It or the accusation itself , ’
261813	261834	261809	261809	Bella	307	‘ Yes . Has either anything to do with my wishing to live quite secret and retired here ? No . ’
261871	261878	261880	261880	Bella	307	‘ Have you lived much alone ? ’
261882	261916	261880	261880	Bella	307	‘ Yes . It ’s nothing new to me . I used to be always alone many hours together , in the day and in the night , when poor father was alive . ’
261917	261928	261847	261847	her	246	‘ You have a brother , I have been told ? ’
261929	261966	261968	261968	she	246	‘ I have a brother , but he is not friendly with me . He is a very good boy though , and has raised himself by his industry . I do n’t complain of him . ’
262001	262022	261992	261992	Bella	307	‘ Lizzie , I wish you would tell me whether you have any friend of your own sex and age . ’
262023	262040	261847	261847	her	246	‘ I have lived that lonely kind of life , that I have never had one , ’
262045	262050	262052	262052	Bella	307	‘ Nor I neither , ’
262054	262151	262052	262052	Bella	307	‘ Not that my life has been lonely , for I could have sometimes wished it lonelier , instead of having Ma going on like the Tragic Muse with a face - ache in majestic corners , and Lavvy being spiteful — though of course I am very fond of them both . I wish you could make a friend of me , Lizzie . Do you think you could ? I have no more of what they call character , my dear , than a canary - bird , but I know I am trustworthy . ’
262218	262227	262214	262214	Bella	307	‘ Do you think you could , Lizzie ? ’
262262	262269	262271	262271	Bella	307	‘ Tell me , my dear , ’
262273	262286	262271	262271	Bella	307	‘ what is the matter , and why you live like this . ’
262296	262303	262287	262287	Lizzie	246	‘ You must have many lovers — ’
262315	262324	262305	262305	Bella	307	‘ My dear , I have n’t one ! ’
262325	262329	262287	262287	Lizzie	246	‘ Not one ? ’
262330	262336	262338	262338	Bella	307	‘ Well ! Perhaps one , ’
262340	262402	262338	262338	Bella	307	‘ I am sure I do n’t know . I HAD one , but what he may think about it at the present time I ca n’t say . Perhaps I have half a one ( of course I do n’t count that Idiot , George Sampson ) . However , never mind me . I want to hear about you . ’
262403	262410	262412	262412	Lizzie	246	‘ There is a certain man , ’
262414	262475	262412	262412	Lizzie	246	‘ a passionate and angry man , who says he loves me , and who I must believe does love me . He is the friend of my brother . I shrank from him within myself when my brother first brought him to me ; but the last time I saw him he terrified me more than I can say . ’
262480	262492	262477	262477	she	6068	‘ Did you come here to escape from him , Lizzie ? ’
262493	262504	262338	262338	Bella	307	‘ I came here immediately after he so alarmed me . ’
262505	262513	262338	262338	Bella	307	‘ Are you afraid of him here ? ’
262514	262558	262477	262477	she	6068	‘ I am not timid generally , but I am always afraid of him . I am afraid to see a newspaper , or to hear a word spoken of what is done in London , lest he should have done some violence . ’
262559	262572	262574	262574	Bella	307	‘ Then you are not afraid of him for yourself , dear ? ’
262582	262612	262574	262574	Bella	307	‘ I should be even that , if I met him about here . I look round for him always , as I pass to and fro at night . ’
262613	262630	262477	262477	she	6068	‘ Are you afraid of anything he may do to himself in London , my dear ? ’
262631	262655	262477	262477	she	6068	‘ No . He might be fierce enough even to do some violence to himself , but I do n’t think of that . ’
262656	262665	262667	262667	Bella	307	‘ Then it would almost seem , dear , ’
262670	262679	262667	262667	Bella	307	‘ as if there must be somebody else ? ’
262693	262766	262680	262680	Lizzie	246	‘ The words are always in my ears , and the blow he struck upon a stone wall as he said them is always before my eyes . I have tried hard to think it not worth remembering , but I can not make so little of it . His hand was trickling down with blood as he said to me , “ Then I hope that I may never kill him ! ’
262802	262814	262777	262777	her	307	‘ Kill him ! Is this man so jealous , then ? ’
262815	262820	262822	262822	Lizzie	246	‘ Of a gentleman , ’
262824	262863	262822	262822	Lizzie	246	‘ — I hardly know how to tell you — of a gentleman far above me and my way of life , who broke father ’s death to me , and has shown an interest in me since . ’
262864	262870	262873	262873	her	246	‘ Does he love you ? ’
262876	262882	262873	262873	her	246	‘ Does he admire you ? ’
262899	262910	262892	262892	her	246	‘ Is it through his influence that you came here ? ’
262911	262941	262873	262873	her	246	‘ O no ! And of all the world I would n’t have him know that I am here , or get the least clue where to find me . ’
262942	262949	262951	262951	Bella	307	‘ Lizzie , dear ! Why ? ’
262969	262991	262873	262873	her	246	‘ No . Do n’t say why . That was a foolish question of mine . I see , I see . ’
263043	263049	263050	263050	she	246	‘ You know all now , ’
263060	263168	263050	263050	she	246	‘ There is nothing left out . This is my reason for living secret here , with the aid of a good old man who is my true friend . For a short part of my life at home with father , I knew of things — don’t ask me what — that I set my face against , and tried to better . I do n’t think I could have done more , then , without letting my hold on father go ; but they sometimes lie heavy on my mind . By doing all for the best , I hope I may wear them out . ’
263169	263175	263177	263177	Bella	307	‘ And wear out too , ’
263180	263197	263177	263177	Bella	307	‘ this weakness , Lizzie , in favour of one who is not worthy of it . ’
263198	263210	263050	263050	she	246	‘ No . I do n’t want to wear that out , ’
263216	263251	263050	263050	she	246	‘ nor do I want to believe , nor do I believe , that he is not worthy of it . What should I gain by that , and how much should I lose ! ’
263269	263334	263266	263266	she	307	‘ Do n’t think that I press you , Lizzie ; but would n’t you gain in peace , and hope , and even in freedom ? Would n’t it be better not to live a secret life in hiding , and not to be shut out from your natural and wholesome prospects ? Forgive my asking you , would that be no gain ? ’
263335	263355	263266	263266	she	307	‘ Does a woman ’s heart that — that has that weakness in it which you have spoken of , ’
263359	263365	263357	263357	Lizzie	246	‘ seek to gain anything ? ’
263392	263413	263388	263388	she	307	‘ There , you little mercenary wretch ! Do you hear that ? Ai n’t you ashamed of your self ? ’
263433	263440	263442	263442	Bella	307	‘ But you said , Lizzie , ’
263455	263475	263449	263449	she	307	‘ that you would lose , besides . Would you mind telling me what you would lose , Lizzie ? ’
263476	263720	263721	263721	They	6073	‘ I should lose some of the best recollections , best encouragements , and best objects , that I carry through my daily life . I should lose my belief that if I had been his equal , and he had loved me , I should have tried with all my might to make him better and happier , as he would have made me . I should lose almost all the value that I put upon the little learning I have , which is all owing to him , and which I conquered the difficulties of , that he might not think it thrown away upon me . I should lose a kind of picture of him — or of what he might have been , if I had been a lady , and he had loved me — which is always with me , and which I somehow feel that I could not do a mean or a wrong thing before . I should leave off prizing the remembrance that he has done me nothing but good since I have known him , and that he has made a change within me , like — like the change in the grain of these hands , which were coarse , and cracked , and hard , and brown when I rowed on the river with father , and are softened and made supple by this new work as you see them now . ’
263734	263741	263743	263743	she	6074	‘ Understand me , my dear ; ’
263747	263890	263743	263743	she	6074	‘ I have never dreamed of the possibility of his being anything to me on this earth but the kind picture that I know I could not make you understand , if the understanding was not in your own breast already . I have no more dreamed of the possibility of MY being his wife , than he ever has — and words could not be stronger than that . And yet I love him . I love him so much , and so dearly , that when I sometimes think my life may be but a weary one , I am proud of it and glad of it . I am proud and glad to suffer something for him , even though it is of no service to him , and he will never know of it or care for it . ’
263944	263953	263955	263955	Lizzie	246	‘ It was late upon a wretched night , ’
263957	264085	263955	263955	Lizzie	246	‘ when his eyes first looked at me in my old river - side home , very different from this . His eyes may never look at me again . I would rather that they never did ; I hope that they never may . But I would not have the light of them taken out of my life , for anything my life can give me . I have told you everything now , my dear . If it comes a little strange to me to have parted with it , I am not sorry . I had no thought of ever parting with a single word of it , a moment before you came in ; but you came in , and my mind changed . ’
264101	264106	264108	264108	Bella	307	‘ I only wish , ’
264110	264118	264108	264108	Bella	307	‘ I was more deserving of it . ’
264119	264125	264127	264127	Lizzie	246	‘ More deserving of it ? ’
264134	264145	264147	264147	Bella	307	‘ I do n’t mean in respect of keeping it , ’
264149	264206	264147	264147	Bella	307	‘ because any one should tear me to bits before getting at a syllable of it — though there ’s no merit in that , for I am naturally as obstinate as a Pig . What I mean is , Lizzie , that I am a mere impertinent piece of conceit , and you shame me . ’
264237	264241	264231	264231	she	307	‘ My dear ! ’
264242	264256	264258	264258	Bella	307	‘ Oh , it ’s all very well to call me your dear , ’
264265	264293	264258	264258	Bella	307	‘ and I am glad to be called so , though I have slight enough claim to be . But I AM such a nasty little thing ! ’
264294	264298	264300	264300	Lizzie	246	‘ My dear ! ’
264303	264316	264318	264318	Bella	307	‘ Such a shallow , cold , worldly , Limited little brute ! ’
264329	264334	264336	264336	Lizzie	246	‘ Do you think , ’
264348	264356	264336	264336	Lizzie	246	‘ that I do n’t know better ? ’
264357	264364	264366	264366	Bella	307	‘ DO you know better though ? ’
264368	264403	264366	264366	Bella	307	‘ Do you really believe you know better ? Oh , I should be so glad if you did know better , but I am so very much afraid that I must know best ! ’
264424	264429	264431	264431	Bella	307	‘ I suppose so , ’
264433	264449	264431	264431	Bella	307	‘ I look in the glass often enough , and I chatter like a Magpie . ’
264450	264466	264468	264468	Lizzie	246	‘ I have seen your face , and heard your voice , at any rate , ’
264470	264505	264468	264468	Lizzie	246	‘ and they have tempted me to say to you — with a certainty of not going wrong — what I thought I should never say to any one . Does that look ill ? ’
264506	264515	264517	264517	Bella	307	‘ No , I hope it does n’t , ’
264532	264543	264545	264545	Lizzie	246	‘ I used once to see pictures in the fire , ’
264548	264569	264545	264545	Lizzie	246	‘ to please my brother . Shall I tell you what I see down there where the fire is glowing ? ’
264600	264606	264608	264608	Lizzie	246	‘ Shall I tell you , ’
264610	264617	264608	264608	Lizzie	246	‘ what I see down there ? ’
264618	264623	264625	264625	Bella	307	‘ Limited little b ? ’
264631	264667	264625	264625	Bella	307	‘ A heart well worth winning , and well won . A heart that , once won , goes through fire and water for the winner , and never changes , and is never daunted . ’
264668	264673	264675	264675	Bella	307	‘ Girl ’s heart ? ’
264684	264693	264681	264681	Lizzie	246	‘ And the figure to which it belongs — ’
264694	264698	264700	264700	Bella	307	‘ Is yours , ’
264702	264711	264700	264700	Bella	307	‘ No . Most clearly and distinctly yours . ’
264774	264783	264785	264786	the Secretary	2769	‘ You look rather serious , Miss Wilfer , ’
264791	264797	264799	264800	Miss Wilfer	307	‘ I feel rather serious , ’
264967	264975	264977	264977	Bella	307	‘ Can you believe , Mr Rokesmith , ’
264979	264998	264977	264977	Bella	307	‘ that I feel as if whole years had passed since I went into Lizzie Hexam ’s cottage ? ’
264999	265010	265011	265011	he	496	‘ We have crowded a good deal into the day , ’
265014	265030	265011	265011	he	496	‘ and you were much affected in the churchyard . You are over - tired . ’
265031	265084	264977	264977	Bella	307	‘ No , I am not at all tired . I have not quite expressed what I mean . I do n’t mean that I feel as if a great space of time had gone by , but that I feel as if much had happened — to myself , you know . ’
265085	265092	265011	265011	he	496	‘ For good , I hope ? ’
265093	265098	265100	265100	Bella	307	‘ I hope so , ’
265102	265164	265100	265100	Bella	307	‘ You are cold ; I felt you tremble . Pray let me put this wrapper of mine about you . May I fold it over this shoulder without injuring your dress ? Now , it will be too heavy and too long . Let me carry this end over my arm , as you have no arm to give me . ’
265203	265226	265185	265185	she	6096	‘ I have had a long and interesting talk with Lizzie , Mr Rokesmith , and she gave me her full confidence . ’
265227	265234	265236	265237	the Secretary	2769	‘ She could not withhold it , ’
265239	265246	265248	265248	Bella	307	‘ I wonder how you come , ’
265258	265270	265253	265253	she	307	‘ to say to me just what she said about it ! ’
265271	265288	265185	265185	she	6096	‘ I infer that it must be because I feel just as she felt about it . ’
265289	265303	265305	265305	Bella	307	‘ And how was that , do you mean to say , sir ? ’
265310	265332	265305	265305	Bella	307	‘ That if you were inclined to win her confidence — anybody ’s confidence — you were sure to do it . ’
265402	265412	265399	265399	her	307	‘ What beautiful stars and what a glorious night ! ’
265416	265419	265413	265414	the Secretary	2769	‘ Yes , ’
265523	265530	265532	265534	Mr Eugene Wrayburn	269	‘ And so , Miss Wren , ’
265536	265548	265532	265534	Mr Eugene Wrayburn	269	‘ I can not persuade you to dress me a doll ? ’
265549	265552	265554	265555	Miss Wren	523	‘ No , ’
265558	265572	265554	265555	Miss Wren	523	‘ if you want one , go and buy one at the shop . ’
265573	265580	265582	265583	Mr Wrayburn	269	‘ And my charming young goddaughter , ’
265586	265591	265582	265583	Mr Wrayburn	269	‘ down in Hertfordshire — ’
265593	265601	265603	265604	Miss Wren	523	‘ Humbugshire you mean , I think , ’
265607	265637	265582	265583	Mr Wrayburn	269	‘ — is to be put upon the cold footing of the general public , and is to derive no advantage from my private acquaintance with the Court Dressmaker ? ’
265638	265671	265582	265583	Mr Wrayburn	269	‘ If it ’s any advantage to your charming godchild — and oh , a precious godfather she has got!’—replied Miss Wren , pricking at him in the air with her needle , ‘
265698	265760	265689	265689	her	13408	’ Miss Wren was busy at her work by candle - light , and Mr Wrayburn , half amused and half vexed , and all idle and shiftless , stood by her bench looking on . Miss Wren ’s troublesome child was in the corner in deep disgrace , and exhibiting great wretchedness in the shivering stage of prostration from drink . ‘
265767	265781	265763	265763	you	6113	’ exclaimed Miss Wren , attracted by the sound of his chattering teeth , ‘
265811	265835	265804	265804	Bee	699	’ On her accompanying each of these reproaches with a threatening stamp of the foot , the wretched creature protested with a whine . ‘
265843	265848	265804	265804	Bee	699	’ Miss Wren proceeded ; ‘
265914	265915	265900	265901	the dustman	6117	’ ‘

266000	266036	266037	266043	A muddling and a swipey old child	6123	’ Assuredly , in his worse than swinish state ( for swine at least fatten on their guzzling , and make themselves good to eat ) , he was a pretty object for any eyes . ‘
266045	266056	266037	266043	A muddling and a swipey old child	6123	’ said Miss Wren , rating him with great severity , ‘
266104	266105	266098	266098	he	6121	’ ‘
266114	266123	266098	266098	he	6121	’ cried the subject of these angry remarks . ‘

266229	266279	266280	266280	I	0	’ Obeying her , he shambled out , and Eugene Wrayburn saw the tears exude from between the little creature ’s fingers as she kept her hand before her eyes . He was sorry , but his sympathy did not move his carelessness to do anything but feel sorry . ‘

266377	266394	266293	266294	Miss Wren	523	‘ Are you so obstinate on the subject of a doll ’s dress for my godchild ? ’
266395	266398	266400	266401	Miss Wren	523	‘ Ah ! ’
266409	266443	266406	266406	her	523	‘ I am so obstinate . And of course it ’s on the subject of a doll ’s dress — or ADdress — whichever you like . Get along and give it up ! ’
266462	266464	266406	266406	her	523	‘ Give ’em
266479	266491	266474	266474	you	6129	’ said Miss Wren , as she turned and espied him . ‘
266511	266622	266624	266624	you	6129	’ The miserable man , feebly rubbing the back of his faltering hands downward from the wrists , shuffled on to his post of disgrace ; but not without a curious glance at Eugene in passing him , accompanied with what seemed as if it might have been an action of his elbow , if any action of any limb or joint he had , would have answered truly to his will . Taking no more particular notice of him than instinctively falling away from the disagreeable contact , Eugene , with a lazy compliment or so to Miss Wren , begged leave to light his cigar , and departed . ‘
266629	266645	266624	266624	you	6129	’ said Jenny , shaking her head and her emphatic little forefinger at her burden , ‘
266668	266679	266684	266684	she	6133	’m gone , and I ’ll know the reason why . ’

He lounged along moodily , and stopped at Charing Cross to look about him , with as little interest in the crowd as any man might take , and was lounging on again , when a most unexpected object caught his eyes . No less an object than Jenny Wren ’s bad boy trying to make up his mind to cross the road . A more ridiculous and feeble spectacle than this tottering wretch making unsteady sallies into the roadway , and as often staggering back again , oppressed by terrors of vehicles that were a long way off or were nowhere , the streets could not have shown . Over and over again , when the course was perfectly clear , he set out , got half way , described a loop , turned , and went back again ; when he might have crossed and re - crossed half a dozen times . Then , he would stand shivering on the edge of the pavement , looking up the street and looking down , while scores of people jostled him , and crossed , and went on . Stimulated in course of time by the sight of so many successes , he would make another sally , make another loop , would all but have his foot on the opposite pavement , would see or imagine something coming , and would stagger back again . There , he would stand making spasmodic preparations as if for a great leap , and at last would decide on a start at precisely the wrong moment , and would be roared at by drivers , and would shrink back once more , and stand in the old spot shivering , with the whole of the proceedings to go through again . ‘

Eugene drew a chair to the fire by which he was having his wine and reading the evening paper , and brought a glass , and filled it for good fellowship ’s sake . ‘

268109	268123	268025	268025	I	0	’ Lightwood was beginning to remonstrate , when he caught at the words : ‘
268295	268358	268359	268364	The frolicsome youth of the neighbourhood	6167	’ Lightwood was shaking his head over the air with which his friend held forth thus — an air so whimsically open and argumentative as almost to deprive what he said of the appearance of evasion — when a shuffling was heard at the outer door , and then an undecided knock , as though some hand were groping for the knocker . ‘
268366	268370	268359	268364	The frolicsome youth of the neighbourhood	6167	’ said Eugene , ‘
268413	268481	268482	268484	This interesting gentleman	6169	’ His friend had barely had time to recall the unprecedented gleam of determination with which he had spoken of finding this girl , and which had faded out of him with the breath of the spoken words , when Eugene came back , ushering in a most disgraceful shadow of a man , shaking from head to foot , and clothed in shabby grease and smear . ‘
268486	268490	268492	268493	the son	8732	’ said Eugene , ‘

268563	268575	268561	268561	Mortimer	287	’ pursued Eugene , as Lightwood stared at the obscene visitor , ‘
268625	268656	268617	268618	Mr Dolls	702	’ The wretched object being much embarrassed by holding what remained of his hat , Eugene airily tossed it to the door , and put him down in a chair . ‘

268702	268744	268691	268692	Mr Dolls	702	’ said Mr Dolls . A judiciously small quantity of the spirit was given him in a wine - glass , and he began to convey it to his mouth , with all kinds of falterings and gyrations on the road . ‘
268751	268757	268691	268692	Mr Dolls	702	’ remarked Eugene to Lightwood , ‘

268844	268851	268842	268842	Eugene	269	’ cried Lightwood , laughing again , ‘

Mr Dolls then fell a crying , and then exhibited a tendency to fall asleep . This last manifestation as by far the most alarming , by reason of its threatening his prolonged stay on the premises , necessitated vigorous measures . Eugene picked up his worn - out hat with the tongs , clapped it on his head , and , taking him by the collar — all this at arm ’s length — conducted him down stairs and out of the precincts into Fleet Street . There , he turned his face westward , and left him . When he got back , Lightwood was standing over the fire , brooding in a sufficiently low - spirited manner . ‘

271472	271479	271494	271494	Yoicks	707	’ cried Eugene , rising too . ‘

271606	271641	271591	271591	We	6241	’ As the two friends passed out of the Temple into the public street , Eugene demanded with a show of courteous patronage in which direction Mortimer would you like the run to be ? ‘
271652	271656	271591	271591	We	6241	’ said Eugene , ‘
271675	271687	271669	271669	your	0	’ Mortimer assented to Bethnal Green , and they turned eastward . ‘
271699	271703	271704	271704	we	6241	’ pursued Eugene , ‘
271717	271751	271714	271715	the schoolmaster	10545	’ But , they both saw him , before they got there ; alone , and stealing after them in the shadow of the houses , on the opposite side of the way . ‘
271756	271760	271753	271753	your	0	’ said Eugene , ‘
271812	271973	271808	271808	I	0	’ At what a rate he went , to breathe the schoolmaster ; and how he then lounged and loitered , to put his patience to another kind of wear ; what preposterous ways he took , with no other object on earth than to disappoint and punish him ; and how he wore him out by every piece of ingenuity that his eccentric humour could devise ; all this Lightwood noted , with a feeling of astonishment that so careless a man could be so wary , and that so idle a man could take so much trouble . At last , far on in the third hour of the pleasures of the chase , when he had brought the poor dogging wretch round again into the City , he twisted Mortimer up a few dark entries , twisted him into a little square court , twisted him sharp round again , and they almost ran against Bradley Headstone . ‘
271985	272005	272007	272007	you	6249	’ remarked Eugene aloud with the utmost coolness , as though there were no one within hearing by themselves : ‘
272019	272199	272011	272011	I	0	’ It was not too strong a phrase for the occasion . Looking like the hunted and not the hunter , baffled , worn , with the exhaustion of deferred hope and consuming hate and anger in his face , white - lipped , wild - eyed , draggle - haired , seamed with jealousy and anger , and torturing himself with the conviction that he showed it all and they exulted in it , he went by them in the dark , like a haggard head suspended in the air : so completely did the force of his expression cancel his figure . Mortimer Lightwood was not an extraordinarily impressible man , but this face impressed him . He spoke of it more than once on the remainder of the way home , and more than once when they got home . They had been abed in their respective rooms two or three hours , when Eugene was partly awakened by hearing a footstep going about , and was fully awakened by seeing Lightwood standing at his bedside . ‘
272205	272206	272203	272203	Mortimer	287	’ ‘
272209	272210	272203	272203	Mortimer	287	’ ‘

272261	272269	272270	272270	I	0	’ said Eugene with a light laugh , ‘
272273	273013	272270	272270	I	0	’ And turned over , and fell asleep again . Chapter 11 IN THE DARK There was no sleep for Bradley Headstone on that night when Eugene Wrayburn turned so easily in his bed ; there was no sleep for little Miss Peecher . Bradley consumed the lonely hours , and consumed himself in haunting the spot where his careless rival lay a dreaming ; little Miss Peecher wore them away in listening for the return home of the master of her heart , and in sorrowfully presaging that much was amiss with him . Yet more was amiss with him than Miss Peecher ’s simply arranged little work - box of thoughts , fitted with no gloomy and dark recesses , could hold . For , the state of the man was murderous . The state of the man was murderous , and he knew it . More ; he irritated it , with a kind of perverse pleasure akin to that which a sick man sometimes has in irritating a wound upon his body . Tied up all day with his disciplined show upon him , subdued to the performance of his routine of educational tricks , encircled by a gabbling crowd , he broke loose at night like an ill - tamed wild animal . Under his daily restraint , it was his compensation , not his trouble , to give a glance towards his state at night , and to the freedom of its being indulged . If great criminals told the truth — which , being great criminals , they do not — they would very rarely tell of their struggles against the crime . Their struggles are towards it . They buffet with opposing waves , to gain the bloody shore , not to recede from it . This man perfectly comprehended that he hated his rival with his strongest and worst forces , and that if he tracked him to Lizzie Hexam , his so doing would never serve himself with her , or serve her . All his pains were taken , to the end that he might incense himself with the sight of the detested figure in her company and favour , in her place of concealment . And he knew as well what act of his would follow if he did , as he knew that his mother had borne him . Granted , that he may not have held it necessary to make express mention to himself of the one familiar truth any more than of the other . He knew equally well that he fed his wrath and hatred , and that he accumulated provocation and self - justification , by being made the nightly sport of the reckless and insolent Eugene . Knowing all this,—and still always going on with infinite endurance , pains , and perseverance , could his dark soul doubt whither he went ? Baffled , exasperated , and weary , he lingered opposite the Temple gate when it closed on Wrayburn and Lightwood , debating with himself should he go home for that time or should he watch longer . Possessed in his jealousy by the fixed idea that Wrayburn was in the secret , if it were not altogether of his contriving , Bradley was as confident of getting the better of him at last by sullenly sticking to him , as he would have been — and often had been — of mastering any piece of study in the way of his vocation , by the like slow persistent process . A man of rapid passions and sluggish intelligence , it had served him often and should serve him again . The suspicion crossed him as he rested in a doorway with his eyes upon the Temple gate , that perhaps she was even concealed in that set of Chambers . It would furnish another reason for Wrayburn ’s purposeless walks , and it might be . He thought of it and thought of it , until he resolved to steal up the stairs , if the gatekeeper would let him through , and listen . So , the haggard head suspended in the air flitted across the road , like the spectre of one of the many heads erst hoisted upon neighbouring Temple Bar , and stopped before the watchman . The watchman looked at it , and asked : ‘
273017	273018	273019	273020	Mr Wrayburn	269	’ ‘
273022	273023	273019	273020	Mr Wrayburn	269	’ ‘
273029	273030	273031	273031	He	269	’ ‘
273070	273253	273066	273066	I	0	’ The watchman said no more , but opened the gate , though rather doubtfully . Seeing , however , that the visitor went straight and fast in the right direction , he seemed satisfied . The haggard head floated up the dark staircase , and softly descended nearer to the floor outside the outer door of the chambers . The doors of the rooms within , appeared to be standing open . There were rays of candlelight from one of them , and there was the sound of a footstep going about . There were two voices . The words they uttered were not distinguishable , but they were both the voices of men . In a few moments the voices were silent , and there was no sound of footstep , and the inner light went out . If Lightwood could have seen the face which kept him awake , staring and listening in the darkness outside the door as he spoke of it , he might have been less disposed to sleep , through the remainder of the night . ‘
273257	273261	273263	273263	she	6251	’ said Bradley ; ‘
273268	273307	273263	273263	she	6251	’ The head arose to its former height from the ground , floated down the stair - case again , and passed on to the gate . A man was standing there , in parley with the watchman . ‘
273310	273315	273263	273263	she	6251	’ said the watchman . ‘
273320	273337	273317	273317	he	269	’ Perceiving himself to be the antecedent , Bradley looked from the watchman to the man . ‘
273348	273359	273361	273361	I	0	’ the watchman explained , showing it in his hand ; ‘
273385	273386	273418	273418	my	0	’ ‘
273389	273405	273418	273418	my	0	’ said Bradley , glancing at the man , who was a stranger to him . ‘
273408	273417	273418	273418	my	0	’ the man assented in a surly way ; ‘
273448	273479	273486	273487	the man	839	’ As Bradley passed out at the gate with an undecided foot , he heard it shut behind him , and heard the footstep of the man coming after him . ‘
273480	273484	273486	273487	the man	839	’ Scuse me , ’
273509	273520	273486	273487	the man	839	‘ but might you be acquainted with the T’other Governor ? ’
273521	273525	273527	273527	Bradley	517	‘ With whom ? ’

273554	273563	273534	273535	the man	839	‘ I do n’t know what you mean . ’
273564	273569	273534	273535	the man	839	‘ Why look here , ’
273586	273631	273534	273535	the man	839	‘ There ’s two Governors , ai n’t there ? One and one , two — Lawyer Lightwood , my first finger , he ’s one , ai n’t he ? Well ; might you be acquainted with my middle finger , the T’other ? ’
273632	273641	273643	273643	Bradley	517	‘ I know quite as much of him , ’
273655	273662	273643	273643	Bradley	517	‘ as I want to know . ’
273663	273666	273668	273669	the man	839	‘ Hooroar ! ’
273671	273688	273668	273669	the man	839	‘ Hooroar T’other t’other Governor . Hooroar T’otherest Governor ! I am of your way of thinkin ’

273720	273729	273717	273718	T’otherest Governor	6260	’ replied the man , becoming hoarsely confidential . ‘

273788	273799	273785	273786	T’otherest Governor	6260	’ returned the man in a tone of injured innocence , ‘
273940	273980	273935	273935	I	0	’ It was not so much in deference to these strong testimonials to character , as in his restless casting about for any way or help towards the discovery on which he was concentrated , that Bradley Headstone replied : ‘
274009	274010	273995	273995	You	6270	’ ‘

274134	274205	274206	274206	You	6270	’ Startled by the implication that his face revealed too much of his mind , Bradley made an effort to clear his brow . It might be worth knowing what this strange man ’s business was with Lightwood , or Wrayburn , or both , at such an unseasonable hour . He set himself to find out , for the man might prove to be a messenger between those two . ‘
274213	274224	274206	274206	You	6270	’ he remarked , with a lumbering show of ease . ‘

274481	274498	274500	274500	Bradley	517	‘ Was that your business at Mr Lightwood ’s chambers in the middle of the night ? ’

For ( as I says under my mark ) I have had trouble enough along of you and your friend . If you , Lawyer Lightwood , had backed me good and true , and if the T’other Governor had took me down correct ( I says under my mark ) , I should have been worth money at the present time , instead of having a barge - load of bad names chucked at me , and being forced to eat my words , which is a unsatisfying sort of food wotever a man ’s appetite !

275705	275747	275700	275700	Riderhood	360	‘ If they did ! They will . Let me ask you a question . I know something more than your name about you ; I knew something about Gaffer Hexam . When did you last set eyes upon his daughter ? ’
275748	275762	275764	275765	Mr Riderhood	360	‘ When did I last set eyes upon his daughter , T’otherest Governor ? ’
275780	275795	275773	275774	the other	8572	‘ Yes . Not to speak to her . To see her — anywhere ? ’
275839	275860	275823	275823	he	11793	‘ I ai n’t set eyes upon her — never once — not since the day of Gaffer ’s death . ’
275861	275870	275911	275911	he	360	‘ You know her well , by sight ? ’
275871	275882	275911	275911	he	360	‘ I should think I did ! No one better . ’
275883	275891	275911	275911	he	360	‘ And you know him as well ? ’
275892	275897	275899	275899	Riderhood	360	‘ Who ’s him ? ’
275920	275939	275911	275911	he	360	‘ Curse the name ! Is it so agreeable to you that you want to hear it again ? ’
275940	275945	275947	275947	Riderhood	360	‘ Oh ! HIM ! ’
275973	275982	275960	275960	he	360	‘ I ’d know HIM among a thousand . ’

276034	276050	276051	276051	Bradley	517	’em together , T’otherest Governor , on the very day when Gaffer was towed ashore . ’
276090	276102	276104	276105	the Rogue	11793	‘ You shall put it plain if you want it answered , ’
276109	276119	276104	276105	the Rogue	11793	‘ I ai n’t a - going a wolunteering . ’
276120	276130	276132	276132	Bradley	517	‘ Well ! was he insolent to her too ? ’
276137	276150	276132	276132	Bradley	517	‘ Or did he make a show of being kind to her ? ’
276151	276164	276166	276166	Riderhood	360	‘ He made a show of being most uncommon kind to her , ’
276168	276175	276166	276166	Riderhood	360	‘ By George ! now I — ’
276194	276201	276203	276204	Mr Riderhood	360	‘ Now I think of it , ’
276215	276223	276209	276209	he	360	‘ Now I see you so jealous , ’
276233	276249	276209	276209	he	360	‘ P’r’aps he went and took me down wrong , a purpose , on account o ’
276255	276572	276209	276209	he	360	’ The baseness of confirming him in this suspicion or pretence of one ( for he could not have really entertained it ) , was a line ’s breadth beyond the mark the schoolmaster had reached . The baseness of communing and intriguing with the fellow who would have set that stain upon her , and upon her brother too , was attained . The line ’s breadth further , lay beyond . He made no reply , but walked on with a lowering face . What he might gain by this acquaintance , he could not work out in his slow and cumbrous thoughts . The man had an injury against the object of his hatred , and that was something ; though it was less than he supposed , for there dwelt in the man no such deadly rage and resentment as burned in his own breast . The man knew her , and might by a fortunate chance see her , or hear of her ; that was something , as enlisting one pair of eyes and ears the more . The man was a bad man , and willing enough to be in his pay . That was something , for his own state and purpose were as bad as bad could be , and he seemed to derive a vague support from the possession of a congenial instrument , though it might never be used . Suddenly he stood still , and asked Riderhood point - blank if he knew where she was ? Clearly , he did not know . He asked Riderhood if he would be willing , in case any intelligence of her , or of Wrayburn as seeking her or associating with her , should fall in his way , to communicate it if it were paid for ? He would be very willing indeed . He was ‘

276588	276607	276578	276578	he	6302	’Cause they had both stood betwixt him and his getting his living by the sweat of his brow . ‘
276615	276628	276578	276578	he	6302	’ said Bradley Headstone , after some more discourse to this effect , ‘

277242	277248	277250	277251	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ It seems to me , ’
277253	277270	277250	277251	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ that you have had no money at all , ever since we have been married . ’
277271	277277	277279	277280	Mr Lammle	437	‘ What seems to you , ’
277282	277301	277279	277280	Mr Lammle	437	‘ to have been the case , may possibly have been the case . It does n’t matter . ’
277366	277377	277379	277380	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ I have never seen any money in the house , ’
277385	277395	277379	277380	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ except my own annuity . That I swear . ’
277396	277406	277408	277409	Mr Lammle	437	‘ You need n’t take the trouble of swearing , ’
277414	277434	277408	277409	Mr Lammle	437	‘ once more , it does n’t matter . You never turned your annuity to so good an account . ’
277435	277444	277446	277447	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Good an account ! In what way ? ’
277449	277461	277463	277464	Mr Lammle	437	‘ In the way of getting credit , and living well , ’
277491	277499	277501	277502	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ And what is to happen next ? ’
277507	277514	277516	277517	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Smash is to happen next , ’
277584	277587	277589	277590	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Sophronia , ’
277605	277608	277589	277590	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Sophronia ! ’
277609	277612	277593	277594	the servant	6341	‘ Well ? ’
277613	277622	277623	277623	He	437	‘ Attend to me , if you please . ’
277637	277711	277623	277623	He	437	‘ I want to take counsel with you . Come , come ; no more trifling . You know our league and covenant . We are to work together for our joint interest , and you are as knowing a hand as I am . We should n’t be together , if you were not . What ’s to be done ? We are hemmed into a corner . What shall we do ? ’
277712	277725	277726	277727	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Have you no scheme on foot that will bring in anything ? ’
277740	277769	277770	277770	She	423	‘ No ; as adventurers we are obliged to play rash games for chances of high winnings , and there has been a run of luck against us . ’
277774	277779	277770	277770	She	423	‘ Have you nothing — ’
277785	277796	277781	277781	he	437	‘ We , Sophronia . We , we , we . ’
277797	277804	277623	277623	He	437	‘ Have we nothing to sell ? ’
277805	277853	277726	277727	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Deuce a bit . I have given a Jew a bill of sale on this furniture , and he could take it to - morrow , to - day , now . He would have taken it before now , I believe , but for Fledgeby . ’
277854	277863	277781	277781	he	437	‘ What has Fledgeby to do with him ? ’
277864	277891	277623	277623	He	437	‘ Knew him . Cautioned me against him before I got into his claws . Could n’t persuade him then , in behalf of somebody else . ’
277892	277906	277726	277727	Mr Lammle	437	‘ Do you mean that Fledgeby has at all softened him towards you ? ’
277907	277918	277781	277781	he	437	‘ Us , Sophronia . Us , us , us . ’
277919	277923	277781	277781	he	437	‘ Towards us ? ’
277924	277955	277726	277727	Mr Lammle	437	‘ I mean that the Jew has not yet done what he might have done , and that Fledgeby takes the credit of having got him to hold his hand . ’
277956	277962	277781	277781	he	437	‘ Do you believe Fledgeby ? ’
277963	277989	277781	277781	he	437	‘ Sophronia , I never believe anybody . I never have , my dear , since I believed you . But it looks like it . ’
278044	278062	278064	278064	Lammle	437	‘ If we could have packed the brute off with Georgiana;—but however ; that ’s spilled milk . ’
278155	278164	278149	278149	herself	6342	‘ If we could borrow money , Alfred — ’
278165	278186	278187	278188	her husband	8651	‘ Beg money , borrow money , or steal money . It would be all one to us , Sophronia , ’
278192	278201	278187	278188	her husband	8651	‘ — Then , we could weather this ? ’
278202	278222	278235	278235	he	437	‘ No doubt . To offer another original and undeniable remark , Sophronia , two and two make four . ’
278273	278280	278281	278281	she	6342	‘ It is natural , Alfred , ’
278293	278311	278281	278281	she	6342	‘ to think in such an emergency of the richest people we know , and the simplest . ’
278312	278318	278366	278366	his	437	‘ Just so , Sophronia . ’
278319	278323	278366	278366	his	437	‘ The Boffins . ’
278324	278330	278281	278281	she	6342	‘ Just so , Sophronia . ’
278331	278341	278366	278366	his	437	‘ Is there nothing to be done with them ? ’
278342	278354	278355	278355	She	6342	‘ What is there to be done with them , Sophronia ? ’
278373	278386	278387	278387	he	437	‘ Of course I have repeatedly thought of the Boffins , Sophronia , ’
278395	278422	278387	278387	he	437	‘ but I have seen my way to nothing . They are well guarded . That infernal Secretary stands between them and — people of merit . ’
278423	278432	278434	278434	she	6342	‘ If he could be got rid of ? ’
278445	278451	278453	278455	her watchful husband	6345	‘ Take time , Sophronia , ’
278462	278483	278453	278455	her watchful husband	6345	‘ If working him out of the way could be presented in the light of a service to Mr Boffin ? ’
278484	278490	278387	278387	he	437	‘ Take time , Sophronia . ’
278491	278510	278387	278387	he	437	‘ We have remarked lately , Alfred , that the old man is turning very suspicious and distrustful . ’
278511	278537	278453	278455	her watchful husband	6345	‘ Miserly too , my dear ; which is far the most unpromising for us . Nevertheless , take time , Sophronia , take time . ’
278545	278569	278538	278538	She	6342	‘ Suppose we should address ourselves to that tendency in him of which we have made ourselves quite sure . Suppose my conscience — ’
278570	278585	278387	278387	he	437	‘ And we know what a conscience it is , my soul . Yes ? ’
278586	278630	278387	278387	he	437	‘ Suppose my conscience should not allow me to keep to myself any longer what that upstart girl told me of the Secretary ’s having made a declaration to her . Suppose my conscience should oblige me to repeat it to Mr Boffin . ’
278631	278637	278639	278639	Lammle	437	‘ I rather like that , ’
278641	278661	278639	278639	Lammle	437	‘ Suppose I so repeated it to Mr Boffin , as to insinuate that my sensitive delicacy and honour — ’
278662	278669	278387	278387	he	437	‘ Very good words , Sophronia . ’
278670	278682	278683	278683	she	6346	‘ — As to insinuate that OUR sensitive delicacy and honour , ’
278694	278762	278683	278683	she	6346	‘ would not allow us to be silent parties to so mercenary and designing a speculation on the Secretary ’s part , and so gross a breach of faith towards his confiding employer . Suppose I had imparted my virtuous uneasiness to my excellent husband , and he had said , in his integrity , “ Sophronia , you must immediately disclose this to Mr Boffin . ” ’
278763	278769	278771	278771	Lammle	625	‘ Once more , Sophronia , ’
278781	278787	278771	278771	Lammle	625	‘ I rather like that . ’
278788	278797	278798	278798	she	6346	‘ You remark that he is well guarded , ’
278801	278826	278798	278798	she	6346	‘ I think so too . But if this should lead to his discharging his Secretary , there would be a weak place made . ’
278827	278842	278771	278771	Lammle	625	‘ Go on expounding , Sophronia . I begin to like this very much . ’
278843	278922	278771	278771	Lammle	625	‘ Having , in our unimpeachable rectitude , done him the service of opening his eyes to the treachery of the person he trusted , we shall have established a claim upon him and a confidence with him . Whether it can be made much of , or little of , we must wait — because we ca n’t help it — to see . Probably we shall make the most of it that is to be made . ’
278923	278926	278928	278928	Lammle	625	‘ Probably , ’
278930	278937	278938	278938	she	6346	‘ Do you think it impossible , ’
278948	278956	278938	278938	she	6346	‘ that you might replace the Secretary ? ’
278957	278980	278981	278981	She	6346	‘ Not impossible , Sophronia . It might be brought about . At any rate it might be skilfully led up to . ’
278996	279000	279001	279001	she	6346	‘ Mr Lammle , ’
279013	279096	279001	279001	she	6346	‘ Mr Lammle would be so delighted to do anything in his power . Mr Lammle , himself a man of business as well as a capitalist . Mr Lammle , accustomed to be intrusted with the most delicate affairs . Mr Lammle , who has managed my own little fortune so admirably , but who , to be sure , began to make his reputation with the advantage of being a man of property , above temptation , and beyond suspicion . ’
279218	279251	279252	279253	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ It appears to me , Sophronia , that you have omitted one branch of the subject . Perhaps not , for women understand women . We might oust the girl herself ? ’
279258	279282	279255	279255	her	423	‘ She has an immensely strong hold upon them both , Alfred . Not to be compared with that of a paid secretary . ’
279283	279289	279291	279291	Lammle	423	‘ But the dear child , ’
279298	279325	279291	279291	Lammle	423	‘ ought to have been open with her benefactor and benefactress . The darling love ought to have reposed unbounded confidence in her benefactor and benefactress . ’
279332	279339	279341	279342	her husband	8651	‘ Well ! Women understand women , ’
279347	279388	279341	279342	her husband	8651	‘ I do n’t press it . It might be the making of our fortune to make a clean sweep of them both . With me to manage the property , and my wife to manage the people — Whew ! ’
279397	279423	279394	279394	she	625	‘ They will never quarrel with the girl . They will never punish the girl . We must accept the girl , rely upon it . ’
279424	279427	279429	279429	Lammle	423	‘ Well ! ’
279435	279450	279429	279429	Lammle	423	‘ so be it : only always remember that we do n’t want her . ’
279451	279460	279462	279463	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Now , the sole remaining question is , ’
279465	279471	279462	279463	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ when shall I begin ? ’
279472	279505	279429	279429	Lammle	423	‘ You can not begin too soon , Sophronia . As I have told you , the condition of our affairs is desperate , and may be blown upon at any moment . ’
279506	279573	279429	279429	Lammle	423	‘ I must secure Mr Boffin alone , Alfred . If his wife was present , she would throw oil upon the waters . I know I should fail to move him to an angry outburst , if his wife was there . And as to the girl herself — as I am going to betray her confidence , she is equally out of the question . ’
279574	279585	279587	279587	Lammle	423	‘ It would n’t do to write for an appointment ? ’
279589	279613	279587	279587	Lammle	423	‘ No , certainly not . They would wonder among themselves why I wrote , and I want to have him wholly unprepared . ’
279614	279624	279626	279626	Lammle	423	‘ Call , and ask to see him alone ? ’
279628	279677	279626	279626	Lammle	423	‘ I would rather not do that either . Leave it to me . Spare me the little carriage for to - day , and for to - morrow ( if I do n’t succeed to - day ) , and I ’ll lie in wait for him . ’
279699	279704	279706	279706	Lammle	423	‘ Here ’s Fledgeby , ’
279708	279748	279706	279706	Lammle	423	‘ He admires you , and has a high opinion of you . I ’ll be out . Coax him to use his influence with the Jew . His name is Riah , of the House of Pubsey and Co. ’
279791	279795	279797	279798	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Mr Fledgeby , ’
279807	279842	279797	279798	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ so glad to see you ! My poor dear Alfred , who is greatly worried just now about his affairs , went out rather early . Dear Mr Fledgeby , do sit down . ’
279889	279942	279797	279798	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Dear Mr Fledgeby , it was needless to mention to you that my poor dear Alfred is much worried about his affairs at present , for he has told me what a comfort you are to him in his temporary difficulties , and what a great service you have rendered him . ’
279943	279946	279948	279949	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ Oh ! ’
279951	279954	279956	279957	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Yes , ’
279959	279965	279967	279968	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ I did n’t know , ’
279978	279989	279967	279968	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ but that Lammle might be reserved about his affairs . ’
279990	279995	279997	279998	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Not to me , ’
280004	280009	280011	280011	Fledgeby	548	‘ Oh , indeed ? ’

280028	280038	280040	280041	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ Yes . I — I always understood so , ’
280043	280120	280040	280041	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ And as the wife of Alfred , may I , dear Mr Fledgeby , wholly without his authority or knowledge , as I am sure your discernment will perceive , entreat you to continue that great service , and once more use your well - earned influence with Mr Riah for a little more indulgence ? The name I have heard Alfred mention , tossing in his dreams , IS Riah ; is it not ? ’
280121	280130	280132	280133	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ The name of the Creditor is Riah , ’
280146	280154	280040	280041	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ Saint Mary Axe . Pubsey and Co. ’

280223	280260	280220	280221	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ Gender — is ever what a man is bound to listen to , and I wish it rested with myself . But this Riah is a nasty one , Mrs Lammle ; he really is . ’
280261	280273	280205	280206	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ Not if YOU speak to him , dear Mr Fledgeby . ’
280274	280283	280285	280285	Fledgeby	548	‘ Upon my soul and body he is ! ’

280447	280458	280443	280445	dear Mr Fledgeby	548	’ Mrs Lammle went on in a very interesting manner , ‘

281162	281186	281159	281160	you Jew	6366	’ The old man stood irresolute and uncertain for a moment , as if there might be further instructions for him in reserve . ‘
281193	281203	281207	281207	he	6365	’ he at length asked in a low voice . ‘
281211	281215	281221	281221	he	6365	’ exclaimed Fledgeby . ‘

281371	281382	281365	281365	he	6365	’ was Mr Fledgeby ’s commentary delivered with a wink , ‘
281387	281513	281521	281521	her	6369	’ He then with a lazy grandeur asserted his rights as lord of Pubsey and Co. by poking his cane at the stools and boxes , and spitting in the fireplace , and so loitered royally to the window and looked out into the narrow street , with his small eyes just peering over the top of Pubsey and Co. ’s blind . As a blind in more senses than one , it reminded him that he was alone in the counting - house with the front door open . He was moving away to shut it , lest he should be injudiciously identified with the establishment , when he was stopped by some one coming to the door . This some one was the dolls ’
281623	281632	281634	281635	Miss Wren	523	‘ Hope I see you well , sir , ’

281671	281695	281668	281668	he	548	‘ he has cut out and left me expecting him back , in an odd way . Have n’t I seen you before ? ’
281696	281706	281708	281709	Miss Wren	523	‘ Once before — if you had your eyesight , ’
281720	281744	281708	281709	Miss Wren	523	‘ When you were carrying on some games up at the top of the house . I remember . How ’s your friend ? ’
281745	281758	281760	281761	Miss Wren	523	‘ I have more friends than one , sir , I hope , ’
281763	281767	281760	281761	Miss Wren	523	‘ Which friend ? ’

281910	281935	281904	281904	I	0	’ said Fledgeby , turning his head towards her ; for he had been sitting blinking at the light , and feeling his cheek . ‘

281964	281969	281970	281970	He	0	’ exclaimed Miss Wren . ‘

282039	282051	282052	282052	He	10550	’ said Mr Fledgeby , with a cool and contemptuous shrug . ‘
282151	282164	282140	282140	He	0	’ added Mr Fledgeby , after casting about for an expressive phrase , ‘
282172	282173	282189	282189	her	6386	’ ‘
282178	282182	282189	282189	her	6386	’ cried the dolls ’

282208	282219	282221	282221	I	0	‘ I can , my little woman , retorted Fledgeby , ‘
282228	282282	282224	282224	I	0	’ This repudiation was not only an act of deliberate policy on Fledgeby ’s part , in case of his being surprised by any other caller , but was also a retort upon Miss Wren for her over - sharpness , and a pleasant instance of his humour as regarded the old Jew . ‘
282316	282479	282305	282305	I	0	’ This was Fledgeby ’s habitual reflection in the way of business , and it was sharpened just now by the old man ’s presuming to have a secret from him : though of the secret itself , as annoying somebody else whom he disliked , he by no means disapproved . Miss Wren with a fallen countenance sat behind the door looking thoughtfully at the ground , and the long and patient silence had again set in for some time , when the expression of Mr Fledgeby ’s face betokened that through the upper portion of the door , which was of glass , he saw some one faltering on the brink of the counting - house . Presently there was a rustle and a tap , and then some more rustling and another tap . Fledgeby taking no notice , the door was at length softly opened , and the dried face of a mild little elderly gentleman looked in . ‘
282483	282491	282480	282481	Mr Riah	563	’ said this visitor , very politely . ‘
282500	282505	282506	282506	He	6387	’ returned Mr Fledgeby . ‘
282529	282568	282573	282573	sir	8755	’ The gentleman took a chair , and put his hand to his forehead , as if he were in a melancholy frame of mind . Mr Fledgeby eyed him aside , and seemed to relish his attitude . ‘
282575	282622	282573	282573	sir	8755	’ remarked Fledgeby . The little dried gentleman was so occupied with his own depressed reflections that he did not notice the remark until the sound of Mr Fledgeby ’s voice had died out of the counting - house . Then he started , and said : ‘
282637	282638	282639	282639	I	0	’ ‘
282642	282652	282639	282639	I	0	’ remarked Fledgeby , a little louder than before , ‘
282659	282660	282639	282639	I	0	’ ‘
282673	282713	282714	282715	Mr Twemlow	271	’ Again the little dried gentleman put his hand to his forehead , and again Mr Fledgeby seemed to enjoy his doing it . When the gentleman changed his attitude with a sigh , Fledgeby spake with a grin . ‘
282720	282728	282714	282715	Mr Twemlow	271	’ The dried gentleman seemed much surprised . ‘
282740	282744	282714	282715	Mr Twemlow	271	’ said Fledgeby . ‘
282798	282938	282949	282949	her	6397	’ There might have been a touch of impertinence in the last words ; on the other hand , it might have been but the native grace of Mr Fledgeby ’s manner . Mr Fledgeby sat on a stool with a foot on the rail of another stool , and his hat on . Mr Twemlow had uncovered on looking in at the door , and remained so . Now the conscientious Twemlow , knowing what he had done to thwart the gracious Fledgeby , was particularly disconcerted by this encounter . He was as ill at ease as a gentleman well could be . He felt himself bound to conduct himself stiffly towards Fledgeby , and he made him a distant bow . Fledgeby made his small eyes smaller in taking special note of his manner . The dolls ’
282979	282986	282988	282989	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ He ’s a long time , ’

283019	283026	283028	283028	Fledgeby	548	‘ As near as a toucher , ’
283030	283050	283028	283028	Fledgeby	548	‘ I hope , Mr Twemlow , your business here may be of a more agreeable character than mine . ’
283051	283057	283059	283060	Mr Twemlow	271	‘ Thank you , sir , ’
283090	283098	283100	283100	Fledgeby	548	‘ What I know of Mr Riah , ’
283111	283139	283100	283100	Fledgeby	548	‘ leads me to believe that this is about the shop for disagreeable business . I have always found him the bitingest and tightest screw in London . ’
283157	283162	283164	283164	Fledgeby	548	‘ So much so , ’
283166	283211	283164	283164	Fledgeby	548	‘ that if it was n’t to be true to a friend , nobody should catch me waiting here a single minute . But if you have friends in adversity , stand by them . That ’s what I say and act up to . ’
283230	283238	283239	283239	he	271	‘ You are very right , sir , ’
283244	283253	283239	283239	he	271	‘ You indicate the generous and manly course . ’
283254	283261	283263	283263	Fledgeby	548	‘ Glad to have your approbation , ’
283265	283274	283276	283276	he	548	‘ It ’s a coincidence , Mr Twemlow ; ’
283287	283320	283276	283276	he	548	‘ that the friends I am standing by to - day are the friends at whose house I met you ! The Lammles . She ’s a very taking and agreeable woman ? ’
283328	283331	283332	283332	he	271	‘ Yes , ’
283335	283339	283332	283332	he	271	‘ She is . ’
283340	283420	283421	283421	Twemlow	271	‘ And when she appealed to me this morning , to come and try what I could do to pacify their creditor , this Mr Riah — that I certainly have gained some little influence with in transacting business for another friend , but nothing like so much as she supposes — and when a woman like that spoke to me as her dearest Mr Fledgeby , and shed tears — why what could I do , you know ? ’
283423	283428	283421	283421	Twemlow	271	‘ Nothing but come . ’
283429	283442	283444	283444	Fledgeby	548	‘ Nothing but come . And so I came . But why , ’
283457	283520	283447	283447	his	548	‘ why Riah should have started up , when I told him that the Lammles entreated him to hold over a Bill of Sale he has on all their effects ; and why he should have cut out , saying he would be back directly ; and why he should have left me here alone so long ; I can not understand . ’
283613	283666	283598	283601	the confiding young man	6404	‘ I beg your pardon , Mr Twemlow ; you see I am acquainted with the nature of the affairs that are transacted here . Is there anything I can do for you here ? You have always been brought up as a gentleman , and never as a man of business ; ’
283676	283695	283598	283601	the confiding young man	6404	‘ and perhaps you are but a poor man of business . What else is to be expected ! ’
283696	283713	283715	283715	Twemlow	271	‘ I am even a poorer man of business than I am a man , sir , ’
283717	283783	283784	283786	Good childish creature	6406	‘ and I could hardly express my deficiency in a stronger way . I really do not so much as clearly understand my position in the matter on which I am brought here . But there are reasons which make me very delicate of accepting your assistance . I am greatly , greatly , disinclined to profit by it . I do n’t deserve it . ’
283816	283819	283821	283821	Fledgeby	548	‘ Perhaps , ’
283823	283842	283821	283821	Fledgeby	548	‘ you may be a little proud of entering on the topic,—having been brought up as a gentleman . ’
283843	283851	283853	283853	Twemlow	271	‘ It ’s not that , sir , ’
283855	283872	283853	283853	Twemlow	271	‘ it ’s not that . I hope I distinguish between true pride and false pride . ’
283873	283883	283885	283885	Fledgeby	548	‘ I have no pride at all , myself , ’
283887	283936	283853	283853	Twemlow	271	‘ and perhaps I do n’t cut things so fine as to know one from t’other . But I know this is a place where even a man of business needs his wits about him ; and if mine can be of any use to you here , you ’re
283941	283942	283885	283885	Fledgeby	548	’ ‘
283948	283954	283943	283943	You	271	’ said Twemlow , faltering . ‘
283961	283962	283963	283963	I	0	’ ‘
283970	283980	283963	283963	I	0	’ proceeded Fledgeby with an ill - favoured glance , ‘
284034	284051	284031	284032	Mr Twemlow	271	’ Twemlow , much disturbed , and with his hand fluttering about his forehead , replied : ‘
284055	284149	284031	284032	Mr Twemlow	271	’ The confiding young man besought him to state his case . The innocent Twemlow , expecting Fledgeby to be astounded by what he should unfold , and not for an instant conceiving the possibility of its happening every day , but treating of it as a terrible phenomenon occurring in the course of ages , related how that he had had a deceased friend , a married civil officer with a family , who had wanted money for change of place or change of post , and how he , Twemlow , had ‘
284155	284199	284031	284032	Mr Twemlow	271	’ with the usual , but in the eyes of Twemlow almost incredible result that he had been left to repay what he had never had . How , in the course of years , he had reduced the principal by trifling sums , ‘
284202	284206	284031	284032	Mr Twemlow	271	’ said Twemlow , ‘

284285	284336	284474	284475	Mr Twemlow	271	’ had some way fallen into the possession of Mr Riah , who had sent him notice to redeem it by paying up in full , in one plump sum , or take tremendous consequences . This , with hazy remembrances of how he had been carried to some office to ‘
284339	284468	284469	284469	I	0	’ ( as he recollected the phrase ) , and how he had been carried to another office where his life was assured for somebody not wholly unconnected with the sherry trade whom he remembered by the remarkable circumstance that he had a Straduarius violin to dispose of , and also a Madonna , formed the sum and substance of Mr Twemlow ’s narrative . Through which stalked the shadow of the awful Snigsworth , eyed afar off by money - lenders as Security in the Mist , and menacing Twemlow with his baronial truncheon . To all , Mr Fledgeby listened with the modest gravity becoming a confiding young man who knew it all beforehand , and , when it was finished , seriously shook his head . ‘

284556	284581	284610	284610	you	8755	’ returned Fledgeby . Whereat Mr Twemlow leaned his innocent head upon his hand , and moaned a little moan of distress and disgrace . ‘
284584	284595	284610	284610	you	8755	’ said Fledgeby , appearing to pluck up his spirits , ‘
284636	284680	284693	284693	Twemlow	271	’re my friend , and I ’ll say my say for you , instead of your saying it for yourself ; I may be able to do it in a more business - like way . You wo n’t consider it a liberty ? ’
284681	284691	284693	284693	Twemlow	271	‘ I thank you again and again , sir , ’
284695	284743	284693	284693	Twemlow	271	‘ I am strong , strongly , disinclined to avail myself of your generosity , though my helplessness yields . For I can not but feel that I — to put it in the mildest form of speech — that I have done nothing to deserve it . ’
284744	284750	284752	284752	Fledgeby	548	‘ Where CAN he be ? ’
284760	284778	284752	284752	Fledgeby	548	‘ What CAN he have gone out for ? Did you ever see him , Mr Twemlow ? ’
284779	284782	284693	284693	Twemlow	271	‘ Never . ’
284783	284855	284693	284693	Twemlow	271	‘ He is a thorough Jew to look at , but he is a more thorough Jew to deal with . He ’s worst when he ’s quiet . If he ’s quiet , I shall take it as a very bad sign . Keep your eye upon him when he comes in , and , if he ’s quiet , do n’t be hopeful . Here he is!—He looks quiet . ’
284890	284896	284898	284898	Fledgeby	548	‘ Why , Mr Riah , ’
284900	284907	284898	284898	Fledgeby	548	‘ I thought you were lost ! ’
284945	284950	284952	284952	Fledgeby	548	‘ I really thought , ’

285021	285047	285049	285049	Fledgeby	548	‘ You ca n’t have rushed out to get the start of everybody else , and put in that bill of sale at Lammle ’s ? ’
285051	285060	285049	285049	Fledgeby	548	‘ Say you have n’t , Mr Riah . ’

285514	285544	285511	285512	Mr Twemlow	271	’ The old man looked into Fledgeby ’s little eyes for any sign of leave to be easy with Mr Twemlow ; but there was no sign in them . ‘
285556	285560	285553	285554	Mr Riah	563	’ said Fledgeby ; ‘

285653	285681	285682	285682	I	0	’ The old man looked again for any sign of permission to spare the poor little gentleman . No . Mr Fledgeby meant him to be racked . ‘
285690	285694	285687	285688	Mr Twemlow	271	’ said Riah . ‘
285717	285718	285729	285730	Mr Riah	563	’ ‘
285732	285742	285726	285726	you	1902	’ asked Fledgeby , to make things quite explicit . ‘
285752	285785	285726	285726	you	1902	’ was Riah ’s answer . Mr Fledgeby shook his head deploringly at Twemlow , and mutely expressed in reference to the venerable figure standing before him with eyes upon the ground : ‘
285795	285796	285797	285798	Mr Riah	563	’ ‘
285800	285835	285797	285798	Mr Riah	563	’ said Fledgeby . The old man lifted up his eyes once more to the little eyes in Mr Fledgeby ’s head , with some reviving hope that the sign might be coming yet . ‘
285870	285871	285866	285866	you	563	’ ‘

285934	285951	285900	285900	you	563	’ answered Riah , as he read his master ’s face , and learnt the book . ‘
285968	285976	285900	285900	you	563	’ said Fledgeby , with peculiar unction , ‘
285997	286036	286037	286037	I	0	’ This required no answer , and received none . Poor Mr Twemlow , who had betrayed the keenest mental terrors since his noble kinsman loomed in the perspective , rose with a sigh to take his departure . ‘
286045	286055	286037	286037	I	0	’ he said , offering Fledgeby his feverish hand . ‘

286112	286126	286109	286110	Mr Twemlow	271	’ said the Jew , then addressing him directly for the first time . ‘
286177	286292	286309	286310	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ When he had said these words in an emphatic manner , he acknowledged Mr Twemlow ’s still polite motion of his head , and that amiable little worthy took his departure in the lowest spirits . Fascination Fledgeby was in such a merry vein when the counting - house was cleared of him , that he had nothing for it but to go to the window , and lean his arms on the frame of the blind , and have his silent laugh out , with his back to his subordinate . When he turned round again with a composed countenance , his subordinate still stood in the same place , and the dolls ’
286304	286307	286309	286310	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ Halloa ! ’

286420	286437	286416	286418	my Cinderella dear	6443	’ said the old man in a whisper , and with a worn - out look , ‘

Putting the same meaning into other words , I do not mean to turn a single dishonest penny by this affair . As the best amends I can make you for having ever gone into it , I make known to you , as a warning , what Wegg has found out . My opinion is , that Wegg is not to be silenced at a modest price , and I build that opinion on his beginning to dispose of your property the moment he knew his power . Whether it ’s worth your while to silence him at any price , you will decide for yourself , and take your measures accordingly . As far as I am concerned , I have no price . If I am ever called upon for the truth , I tell it , but I want to do no more than I have now done and ended . ’

289280	289410	289278	289278	Venus	379	‘ Get behind the young alligator in the corner , Mr Boffin , and judge him for yourself . I wo n’t light a candle till he ’s gone ; there ’ll only be the glow of the fire ; Wegg ’s well acquainted with the alligator , and he wo n’t take particular notice of him . Draw your legs in , Mr Boffin , at present I see a pair of shoes at the end of his tail . Get your head well behind his smile , Mr Boffin , and you ’ll lie comfortable there ; you ’ll find plenty of room behind his smile . He ’s a little dusty , but he ’s very like you in tone . Are you right , sir ? ’
289426	289429	289431	289432	that gentleman	1468	‘ Partner , ’
289438	289443	289431	289432	that gentleman	1468	‘ how ’s yourself ? ’
289444	289447	289449	289450	Mr Venus	379	‘ Tolerable , ’
289452	289459	289449	289450	Mr Venus	379	‘ Not much to boast of . ’
289460	289465	289467	289467	Wegg	714	‘ In - deed ! ’
289469	289476	289467	289467	Wegg	714	‘ sorry , partner , that you ’re

289543	289551	289538	289538	you	5679	’ said Wegg , rubbing his hands . ‘
289596	289645	289589	289589	I	0	’ Turning his back and turning a key , Mr Venus produced the document , holding on by his usual corner . Mr Wegg , holding on by the opposite corner , sat down on the seat so lately vacated by Mr Boffin , and looked it over . ‘
289651	289666	289649	289649	sir	8755	’ he slowly and unwillingly admitted , in his reluctance to loose his hold , ‘
289670	289689	289589	289589	I	0	’ And greedily watched his partner as he turned his back again , and turned his key again . ‘

289741	289758	289729	289734	That foxey old grasper and griper	6515	’ inquired Venus , with a glance towards the alligator ’s yard or two of smile . ‘
289763	289773	289774	289774	Boffin	714	’ cried Wegg , yielding to his honest indignation . ‘

290186	290200	290184	290184	partner	5679	’ assented Wegg , put into a better humour by the ready admission . ‘

290251	290255	290244	290245	Mr Wegg	714	’ said Venus , ‘

290405	290411	290402	290402	I	0	’ returned that estimable man , ‘
290461	290466	290460	290460	you	714	’re a beggar . ” ’
290467	290476	290460	290460	you	714	‘ Suppose he says nothing , Mr Wegg ? ’
290477	290480	290482	290482	Wegg	714	‘ Then , ’
290484	290564	290482	290482	Wegg	714	‘ we shall have come to an understanding with very little trouble , and I ’ll break him and drive him , Mr Venus . I ’ll put him in harness , and I ’ll bear him up tight , and I ’ll break him and drive him . The harder the old Dust is driven , sir , the higher he ’ll pay . And I mean to be paid high , Mr Venus , I promise you . ’
290565	290574	290460	290460	you	714	‘ You speak quite revengefully , Mr Wegg . ’
290575	290647	290482	290482	Wegg	714	‘ Revengefully , sir ? Is it for him that I have declined and falled , night after night ? Is it for his pleasure that I ’ve waited at home of an evening , like a set of skittles , to be set up and knocked over , set up and knocked over , by whatever balls — or books — he chose to bring against me ? Why , I ’m
290662	290687	290482	290482	Wegg	714	’ Perhaps it was with the malicious intent of urging him on to his worst that Mr Venus looked as if he doubted that . ‘
290714	290732	290734	290734	I	0	’ said Wegg , falling back upon his strongest terms of reprobation , and slapping the counter , ‘
290809	290912	290795	290795	I	0	’ There was a grin upon the ghastly countenance of the French gentleman under the influence of the firelight , as if he were computing how many thousand slanderers and traitors array themselves against the fortunate , on premises exactly answering to those of Mr Wegg . One might have fancied that the big - headed babies were toppling over with their hydrocephalic attempts to reckon up the children of men who transform their benefactors into their injurers by the same process . The yard or two of smile on the part of the alligator might have been invested with the meaning , ‘

290935	290949	290950	290950	your	0	’ said Wegg , possibly with some slight perception to the foregoing effect , ‘

291084	291088	291078	291079	Mr Wegg	319	’ remarked Venus , ‘

291172	291190	291161	291162	Mr Venus	379	’ With this agreeable promise Wegg stumped out , and shut the shop - door after him . ‘
291201	291205	291198	291199	Mr Boffin	714	’ said Venus , ‘
291214	291283	291207	291207	you	714	’ So , he lighting a candle and holding it up at arm ’s length , Mr Boffin disengaged himself from behind the alligator ’s smile , with an expression of countenance so very downcast that it not only appeared as if the alligator had the whole of the joke to himself , but further as if it had been conceived and executed at Mr Boffin ’s expense . ‘
291290	291313	291207	291207	you	714	’ said Mr Boffin , dusting his arms and legs as he came forth , the alligator having been but musty company . ‘
291320	291321	291316	291318	a dreadful fellow	6550	’ ‘

291354	291358	291351	291352	Mr Boffin	714	’ remarked Venus , ‘

291440	291445	291432	291432	I	0	’ returned Mr Boffin , ‘
291475	291486	291473	291473	he	714	’ Mr Venus opined that such was clearly his intention . ‘
291503	291508	291473	291473	he	714	’ said Mr Boffin ; ‘
291551	291569	291570	291570	I	0	’ Venus naturally inquired how long Mr Boffin thought it might take him to turn himself round ? ‘
291578	291589	291573	291573	I	0	’ was the answer , given quite at a loss . ‘
291640	291663	291638	291638	Venus	379	’ Mr Venus preferred , he said , to leave Mr Boffin to arrive at his own conclusions on that delicate question . ‘
291675	291680	291667	291667	I	0	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
291782	291812	291765	291765	I	0	’ Mr Venus listened to these lamentations in silence , while Mr Boffin jogged to and fro , holding his pockets as if he had a pain in them . ‘
291844	291904	291839	291839	you	0	’ Venus replied that as Wegg had found the document and handed it to him , it was his intention to hand it back to Wegg , with the declaration that he himself would have nothing to say to it , or do with it , and that Wegg must act as he chose , and take the consequences . ‘
291917	291924	291907	291907	he	6561	’ cried Mr Boffin , ruefully . ‘
291948	292009	292013	292013	you	0	’ Mr Venus could only repeat that it was his fixed intention to betake himself to the paths of science , and to walk in the same all the days of his life ; not dropping down upon his fellow - creatures until they were deceased , and then only to articulate them to the best of his humble ability . ‘
292026	292037	292013	292013	you	0	’ asked Mr Boffin , retiring on his other idea . ‘
292052	292070	292013	292013	you	0	’ No . That would protract the mental uneasiness of Mr Venus too long , he said . ‘
292081	292086	292089	292089	I	0	’ demanded Mr Boffin ; ‘
292099	292146	292089	292089	I	0	’ If by good and sufficient reason Mr Boffin meant honest and unimpeachable reason , that might weigh with Mr Venus against his personal wishes and convenience . But he must add that he saw no opening to the possibility of such reason being shown him . ‘
292154	292159	292152	292152	Venus	379	’ said Mr Boffin , ‘
292164	292165	292152	292152	Venus	379	’ ‘
292173	292185	292171	292171	sir	8755	’ asked Mr Venus , with an incredulous smile and blink . ‘
292195	292200	292171	292171	sir	8755	’ said Mr Boffin , ‘
292258	292259	292245	292245	I	0	’ ‘
292265	292273	292262	292263	Mr Boffin	714	’ said Venus , after brief consideration . ‘
292284	292285	292280	292280	Venus	379	’ ‘
292297	292298	292294	292295	Mr Boffin	714	’ ‘

292342	292352	292353	292353	They	6477	’ said Mr Boffin , glancing round the shop . ‘
292392	292409	292390	292390	Venus	379	’ With that he jogged out into the street , and jogged upon his homeward way . ‘
292415	292427	292412	292412	I	0	’ he meditated as he went along , nursing his stick , ‘
292476	292712	292713	292713	I	0	’ It was a cunning and suspicious idea , quite in the way of his school of Misers , and he looked very cunning and suspicious as he went jogging through the streets . More than once or twice , more than twice or thrice , say half a dozen times , he took his stick from the arm on which he nursed it , and hit a straight sharp rap at the air with its head . Possibly the wooden countenance of Mr Silas Wegg was incorporeally before him at those moments , for he hit with intense satisfaction . He was within a few streets of his own house , when a little private carriage , coming in the contrary direction , passed him , turned round , and passed him again . It was a little carriage of eccentric movement , for again he heard it stop behind him and turn round , and again he saw it pass him . Then it stopped , and then went on , out of sight . But , not far out of sight , for , when he came to the corner of his own street , there it stood again . There was a lady ’s face at the window as he came up with this carriage , and he was passing it when the lady softly called to him by his name . ‘
292720	292730	292718	292718	Ma’am	721	’ said Mr Boffin , coming to a stop . ‘
292736	292756	292733	292734	Mrs Lammle	423	’ said the lady . Mr Boffin went up to the window , and hoped Mrs Lammle was well . ‘
292794	292814	292815	292815	I	0	’ Mr Boffin proposed that Mrs Lammle should drive on to his house , a few hundred yards further . ‘
292860	292870	292853	292853	You	714	’ Mr Boffin said no , but meant yes . ‘
292962	292964	292986	292986	Alfred	423	’ ( ‘
292974	292983	292986	292986	Alfred	423	’ thought Mr Boffin , quite bewildered . ) ‘

293052	293063	293035	293035	you	0	’ and took his seat at Mrs Lammle ’s side . ‘

293108	293486	293487	293487	I	0	’ Chapter 15 THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN AT HIS WORST The breakfast table at Mr Boffin ’s was usually a very pleasant one , and was always presided over by Bella . As though he began each new day in his healthy natural character , and some waking hours were necessary to his relapse into the corrupting influences of his wealth , the face and the demeanour of the Golden Dustman were generally unclouded at that meal . It would have been easy to believe then , that there was no change in him . It was as the day went on that the clouds gathered , and the brightness of the morning became obscured . One might have said that the shadows of avarice and distrust lengthened as his own shadow lengthened , and that the night closed around him gradually . But , one morning long afterwards to be remembered , it was black midnight with the Golden Dustman when he first appeared . His altered character had never been so grossly marked . His bearing towards his Secretary was so charged with insolent distrust and arrogance , that the latter rose and left the table before breakfast was half done . The look he directed at the Secretary ’s retiring figure was so cunningly malignant , that Bella would have sat astounded and indignant , even though he had not gone the length of secretly threatening Rokesmith with his clenched fist as he closed the door . This unlucky morning , of all mornings in the year , was the morning next after Mr Boffin ’s interview with Mrs Lammle in her little carriage . Bella looked to Mrs Boffin ’s face for comment on , or explanation of , this stormy humour in her husband , but none was there . An anxious and a distressed observation of her own face was all she could read in it . When they were left alone together — which was not until noon , for Mr Boffin sat long in his easy - chair , by turns jogging up and down the breakfast - room , clenching his fist and muttering — Bella , in consternation , asked her what had happened , what was wrong ? ‘
293506	293656	293500	293500	I	0	’ was all the answer she could get . And still , whenever , in her wonder and dismay , she raised her eyes to Mrs Boffin ’s face , she saw in it the same anxious and distressed observation of her own . Oppressed by her sense that trouble was impending , and lost in speculations why Mrs Boffin should look at her as if she had any part in it , Bella found the day long and dreary . It was far on in the afternoon when , she being in her own room , a servant brought her a message from Mr Boffin begging her to come to his . Mrs Boffin was there , seated on a sofa , and Mr Boffin was jogging up and down . On seeing Bella he stopped , beckoned her to him , and drew her arm through his . ‘
293665	293671	293662	293663	my dear	919	’ he said , gently ; ‘
293699	293700	293693	293693	I	0	’ ‘
293705	293719	293693	293693	I	0	’ thought Bella . And then repeated aloud in a tone of astonishment : ‘
293726	293727	293724	293724	sir	8755	’ ‘
293732	293737	293724	293724	sir	8755	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
293750	293782	293743	293744	Mr Rokesmith	315	’ Bella would have been lost in perplexity if there had been pause enough ; but the servant found Mr Rokesmith near at hand , and he almost immediately presented himself . ‘
293789	293794	293795	293795	I	0	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
293814	293815	293816	293816	I	0	’ ‘
293825	293843	293816	293816	I	0	’ returned the Secretary , as , having closed the door , he turned and faced him , ‘

293858	293863	293855	293855	you	0	’ blustered Mr Boffin . ‘

293896	293908	293909	293909	I	0	’ said Mr Boffin with a threatening roll of his head . ‘
293913	293943	293909	293909	I	0	’ returned the Secretary . He was quiet and respectful ; but stood , as Bella thought ( and was glad to think ) , on his manhood too . ‘
293948	293953	293946	293946	sir	8755	’ said Mr Boffin , ‘
293963	294026	294027	294027	I	0	’ Bella involuntarily raising her eyes , when this sudden reference was made to herself , met those of Mr Rokesmith . He was pale and seemed agitated . Then her eyes passed on to Mrs Boffin ’s , and she met the look again . In a flash it enlightened her , and she began to understand what she had done . ‘
294034	294039	294027	294027	I	0	’ Mr Boffin repeated , ‘
294049	294050	294051	294051	I	0	’ ‘
294055	294090	294051	294051	I	0	’ returned the Secretary . As his glance rested again on Bella for a moment , she thought there was reproach in it . But it is possible that the reproach was within herself . ‘
294097	294102	294095	294095	sir	8755	’ said Mr Boffin , ‘

294168	294173	294180	294180	you	8755	’ retorted Mr Boffin . ‘

294243	294250	294238	294238	he	2769	‘ So I see and hear . ’
294251	294263	294265	294266	Mr Boffin	324	‘ It was sheer Insolence in you , I tell you , ’
294268	294318	294265	294266	Mr Boffin	324	‘ even to think of this young lady . This young lady was far above YOU . This young lady was no match for YOU . This young lady was lying in wait ( as she was qualified to do ) for money , and you had no money . ’

294352	294404	294319	294319	Bella	307	‘ that you were to have the audacity to follow up this young lady ? This young lady was looking about the market for a good bid ; she was n’t in it to be snapped up by fellows that had no money to lay out ; nothing to buy with . ’

294495	294503	294489	294489	Bella	307	‘ You wrong me , wrong me ! ’

You hear me tell you that the first side of your conduct was Insolence — Insolence and Presumption . Answer me one thing , if you can . Did n’t this young lady tell you so herself ? ’
294591	294598	294600	294600	Bella	307	‘ Did I , Mr Rokesmith ? ’
294607	294617	294600	294600	Bella	307	‘ O say , Mr Rokesmith ! Did I ? ’

294634	294645	294647	294648	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Ah ! You ca n’t deny it , though ! ’
294658	294669	294671	294671	Bella	307	‘ But I have asked him to forgive me since , ’
294673	294695	294671	294671	Bella	307	‘ and I would ask him to forgive me now again , upon my knees , if it would spare him ! ’
294705	294709	294711	294712	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Old lady , ’
294714	294772	294711	294712	Mr Boffin	324	‘ stop that noise ! Tender - hearted in you , Miss Bella ; but I mean to have it out right through with this young man , having got him into a corner .

294936	294957	294965	294965	they	6597	’em , similar to mine ? Did n’t everybody want to make grabs at what they ’d got , and bring ’em

295159	295171	295143	295144	Mr Boffin	324	’ retorted Mr Boffin as if he had n’t done so . ‘
295196	295231	295195	295195	you	315	’re a needy chap that I pick up in the street . You come and ask me in the street to take you for a Secretary , and I take you . Very good . ’
295232	295236	295238	295239	the Secretary	2769	‘ Very bad , ’
295241	295247	295249	295250	Mr Boffin	324	‘ What do you say ? ’
295282	295336	295262	295263	Mr Boffin	324	‘ This Rokesmith is a needy young man that I take for my Secretary out of the open street . This Rokesmith gets acquainted with my affairs , and gets to know that I mean to settle a sum of money on this young lady . “ Oho ! ” says this Rokesmith ; ’
295367	295475	295477	295478	Mr Boffin	324	‘ “ This will be a good haul ; I ’ll go in for this ! ” And so this Rokesmith , greedy and hungering , begins a - creeping on his hands and knees towards the money . Not so bad a speculation either : for if this young lady had had less spirit , or had had less sense , through being at all in the romantic line , by George he might have worked it out and made it pay ! But fortunately she was too many for him , and a pretty figure he cuts now he is exposed . There he stands ! ’
295487	295492	295482	295482	himself	324	‘ Look at him ! ’
295493	295501	295503	295504	the Secretary	2769	‘ Your unfortunate suspicions , Mr Boffin — ’
295506	295517	295519	295520	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Precious unfortunate for you , I can tell you , ’
295522	295553	295519	295520	Mr Boffin	324	‘ — are not to be combated by any one , and I address myself to no such hopeless task . But I will say a word upon the truth . ’
295554	295564	295566	295567	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Yah ! Much you care about the truth , ’

295629	295640	295642	295643	the Secretary	2769	‘ Our connexion being at an end , Mr Boffin , ’
295645	295659	295642	295643	the Secretary	2769	‘ it can be of very little moment to me what you say . ’
295660	295668	295670	295671	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Oh ! You are knowing enough , ’
295678	295747	295670	295671	Mr Boffin	324	‘ to have found out that our connexion ’s at an end , eh ? But you ca n’t get beforehand with me . Look at this in my hand . This is your pay , on your discharge . You can only follow suit . You ca n’t deprive me of the lead . Let ’s have no pretending that you discharge yourself . I discharge you . ’
295748	295754	295756	295757	the Secretary	2769	‘ So that I go , ’
295767	295775	295764	295764	his	2769	‘ it is all one to me . ’
295776	295780	295782	295783	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Is it ? ’
295785	295858	295782	295783	Mr Boffin	324	‘ But it ’s two to me , let me tell you . Allowing a fellow that ’s found out , to discharge himself , is one thing ; discharging him for insolence and presumption , and likewise for designs upon his master ’s money , is another . One and one ’s two ; not one . ( Old lady , do n’t you cut in . You keep still . ) ’
295859	295871	295873	295874	the Secretary	2769	‘ Have you said all you wish to say to me ? ’
295876	295887	295889	295890	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I do n’t know whether I have or not , ’
295892	295896	295889	295890	Mr Boffin	324	‘ It depends . ’
295897	295918	295782	295783	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Perhaps you will consider whether there are any other strong expressions that you would like to bestow upon me ? ’
295919	295925	295927	295928	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I ’ll consider that , ’
295932	295959	295927	295928	Mr Boffin	324	‘ at my convenience , and not at yours . You want the last word . It may not be suitable to let you have it . ’
295960	295974	295976	295978	poor Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Noddy ! My dear , dear Noddy ! You sound so hard ! ’
295986	295990	295992	295993	her husband	8651	‘ Old lady , ’
295999	296033	295992	295993	her husband	8651	‘ if you cut in when requested not , I ’ll get a pillow and carry you out of the room upon it . What do you want to say , you Rokesmith ? ’
296034	296057	295927	295928	Mr Boffin	324	‘ To you , Mr Boffin , nothing . But to Miss Wilfer and to your good kind wife , a word . ’
296058	296064	296066	296067	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Out with it then , ’
296069	296083	296066	296067	Mr Boffin	324	‘ and cut it short , for we ’ve had enough of you . ’
296084	296089	296091	296092	the Secretary	2769	‘ I have borne , ’
296099	296217	296091	296092	the Secretary	2769	‘ with my false position here , that I might not be separated from Miss Wilfer . To be near her , has been a recompense to me from day to day , even for the undeserved treatment I have had here , and for the degraded aspect in which she has often seen me . Since Miss Wilfer rejected me , I have never again urged my suit , to the best of my belief , with a spoken syllable or a look . But I have never changed in my devotion to her , except — if she will forgive my saying so — that it is deeper than it was , and better founded . ’
296218	296235	296237	296238	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Now , mark this chap ’s saying Miss Wilfer , when he means L.s.d . ! ’
296245	296264	296237	296238	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Now , mark this chap ’s making Miss Wilfer stand for Pounds , Shillings , and Pence ! ’
296265	296272	296274	296275	the Secretary	2769	‘ My feeling for Miss Wilfer , ’
296283	296324	296274	296275	the Secretary	2769	‘ is not one to be ashamed of . I avow it . I love her . Let me go where I may when I presently leave this house , I shall go into a blank life , leaving her . ’
296325	296332	296334	296335	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Leaving L.s.d . behind me , ’
296346	296352	296353	296354	the Secretary	2769	‘ That I am incapable , ’
296363	296443	296445	296446	the Secretary	2769	‘ of a mercenary project , or a mercenary thought , in connexion with Miss Wilfer , is nothing meritorious in me , because any prize that I could put before my fancy would sink into insignificance beside her . If the greatest wealth or the highest rank were hers , it would only be important in my sight as removing her still farther from me , and making me more hopeless , if that could be . Say , ’
296455	296489	296445	296446	the Secretary	2769	‘ say that with a word she could strip Mr Boffin of his fortune and take possession of it , she would be of no greater worth in my eyes than she is . ’
296490	296502	296504	296505	Mr Boffin	324	‘ What do you think by this time , old lady , ’
296516	296580	296504	296505	Mr Boffin	324	‘ about this Rokesmith here , and his caring for the truth ? You need n’t say what you think , my dear , because I do n’t want you to cut in , but you can think it all the same . As to taking possession of my property , I warrant you he would n’t do that himself if he could . ’
296581	296584	296586	296587	the Secretary	2769	‘ No , ’

296909	296928	296930	296931	Mr Boffin	324	‘ But luckily he had n’t to deal with the people he supposed , Bella , my dear ! ’
296933	297016	296930	296931	Mr Boffin	324	‘ No ! Luckily he had to deal with you , and with me , and with Daniel and Miss Dancer , and with Elwes , and with Vulture Hopkins , and with Blewbury Jones and all the rest of us , one down t’other come on . And he ’s beat ; that ’s what he is ; regularly beat . He thought to squeeze money out of us , and he has done for himself instead , Bella my dear ! ’
297102	297111	297113	297115	the Golden Dustman	10194	‘ There ’s your pay , Mister Rokesmith , ’

297748	297757	297745	297746	Mrs Boffin	324	’ said Rokesmith , quietly turning to her , ‘
297783	297784	297776	297777	Miss Wilfer	307	’ ‘
297791	297805	297806	297806	you	919	’ said Mr Boffin , laying his hand on Bella ’s head again , ‘

298033	298098	298101	298102	my dear	919	’ So , crying out in a wild way that she could not bear this , Bella drooped her head on Mrs Boffin ’s ready breast . John Rokesmith from his place in the room , and Mr Boffin from his , looked on at her in silence until she was silent herself . Then Mr Boffin observed in a soothing and comfortable tone , ‘
298123	298151	298101	298102	my dear	919	’m sure , at your being a little flurried by having a scene with this fellow , but it ’s all over , my dear , and you ’re

298346	298368	298340	298340	you	0	’ Mr Boffin , seeming to become convinced that this was a fit , rolled his eyes and loosened his neckcloth . ‘

298468	298511	298461	298461	Bella	307	‘ that you had not one single farthing in the world . If any true friend and well - wisher could make you a bankrupt , you would be a Duck ; but as a man of property you are a Demon ! ’
298532	298580	298525	298525	Bella	307	‘ Mr Rokesmith , pray stay one moment . Pray hear one word from me before you go ! I am deeply sorry for the reproaches you have borne on my account . Out of the depths of my heart I earnestly and truly beg your pardon . ’
298608	298613	298598	298598	he	6660	‘ God bless you ! ’
298631	298767	298624	298624	her	307	‘ There is not an ungenerous word that I have heard addressed to you — heard with scorn and indignation , Mr Rokesmith — but it has wounded me far more than you , for I have deserved it , and you never have . Mr Rokesmith , it is to me you owe this perverted account of what passed between us that night . I parted with the secret , even while I was angry with myself for doing so . It was very bad in me , but indeed it was not wicked . I did it in a moment of conceit and folly — one of my many such moments — one of my many such hours — years . As I am punished for it severely , try to forgive it ! ’

298777	298938	298939	298939	He	6661	‘ Thank you . O thank you ! Do n’t part from me till I have said one other word , to do you justice . The only fault you can be truly charged with , in having spoken to me as you did that night — with how much delicacy and how much forbearance no one but I can know or be grateful to you for — is , that you laid yourself open to be slighted by a worldly shallow girl whose head was turned , and who was quite unable to rise to the worth of what you offered her . Mr Rokesmith , that girl has often seen herself in a pitiful and poor light since , but never in so pitiful and poor a light as now , when the mean tone in which she answered you — sordid and vain girl that she was — has been echoed in her ears by Mr Boffin . ’
298945	298959	298961	298961	Bella	307	‘ Mr Boffin ’s speeches were detestable to me , shocking to me , ’
298974	299013	299014	299014	He	6661	‘ It is quite true that there was a time , and very lately , when I deserved to be so “ righted , ” Mr Rokesmith ; but I hope that I shall never deserve it again ! ’
299067	299072	299074	299074	Bella	307	‘ He is gone , ’
299094	299119	299086	299086	her	307	‘ He has been most shamefully abused , and most unjustly and most basely driven away , and I am the cause of it ! ’
299196	299199	299188	299188	he	324	‘ Well ! ’
299293	299299	299301	299301	Bella	307	‘ I must go home , ’
299306	299328	299301	299301	Bella	307	‘ I am very grateful to you for all you have done for me , but I ca n’t stay here . ’
299329	299334	299336	299337	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ My darling girl ! ’
299339	299348	299350	299350	Bella	307	‘ No , I ca n’t stay here , ’
299352	299363	299350	299350	Bella	307	‘ I ca n’t indeed.—Ugh ! you vicious old thing ! ’
299371	299380	299382	299383	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Do n’t be rash , my love , ’
299385	299393	299382	299383	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Think well of what you do . ’
299394	299403	299405	299406	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Yes , you had better think well , ’
299408	299418	299420	299420	Bella	307	‘ I shall never more think well of YOU , ’
299445	299492	299494	299494	Bella	307	‘ No ! Never again ! Your money has changed you to marble . You are a hard - hearted Miser . You are worse than Dancer , worse than Hopkins , worse than Blackberry Jones , worse than any of the wretches . And more ! ’
299501	299513	299494	299494	Bella	307	‘ you were wholly undeserving of the Gentleman you have lost . ’
299514	299527	299528	299530	the Golden Dustman	10194	‘ Why , you do n’t mean to say , Miss Bella , ’
299534	299543	299528	299530	the Golden Dustman	10194	‘ that you set up Rokesmith against me ? ’
299544	299548	299550	299550	Bella	307	‘ I do ! ’
299552	299561	299550	299550	Bella	307	‘ He is worth a Million of you . ’
299604	299614	299616	299616	Bella	307	‘ I would rather he thought well of me , ’
299618	299649	299616	299616	Bella	307	‘ though he swept the street for bread , than that you did , though you splashed the mud upon him from the wheels of a chariot of pure gold.—There ! ’
299650	299653	299679	299679	him	6669	‘ Well I ’m
299656	299663	299616	299616	Bella	307	’ cried Mr Boffin , staring . ‘
299690	299735	299681	299681	I	0	’ said Bella—‘There ! And throughout I saw in him the master , and I saw in you the man — There ! And when you used him shamefully , I took his part and loved him — There ! I boast of it ! ’
299760	299766	299768	299769	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Now , look here , ’
299787	299800	299774	299774	he	324	‘ Give me your attention , Bella . I am not angry . ’
299801	299805	299807	299807	Bella	307	‘ I AM ! ’
299809	299813	299815	299817	the Golden Dustman	449	‘ I say , ’
299819	299858	299815	299817	the Golden Dustman	449	‘ I am not angry , and I mean kindly to you , and I want to overlook this . So you ’ll stay where you are , and we ’ll agree to say no more about it . ’
299859	299868	299870	299870	Bella	307	‘ No , I ca n’t stay here , ’
299876	299892	299870	299870	Bella	307	‘ I ca n’t think of staying here . I must go home for good . ’
299893	299901	299902	299903	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Now , do n’t be silly , ’
299906	299921	299870	299870	Bella	307	‘ Do n’t do what you ca n’t undo ; do n’t do what you ’re

300062	300096	300041	300041	I	0	’m a - going to settle money on you , if you leave us like this , because I am not . No , Bella ! Be careful ! Not one brass farthing . ’
300097	300100	300102	300102	Bella	307	‘ Expect ! ’
300106	300127	300102	300102	Bella	307	‘ Do you think that any power on earth could make me take it , if you did , sir ? ’
300187	300189	300163	300163	she	307	‘ You ’re
300201	300205	300206	300206	You	6673	’ cried Bella . ‘
300207	300261	300262	300263	Mrs Boffin	324	’re the best of human creatures . I can never be thankful enough to you , and I can never forget you . If I should live to be blind and deaf I know I shall see and hear you , in my fancy , to the last of my dim old days ! ’
300346	300352	300354	300354	Bella	307	‘ I am very glad , ’
300356	300395	300354	300354	Bella	307	‘ that I called you names , sir , because you richly deserved it . But I am very sorry that I called you names , because you used to be so different . Say good - bye ! ’
300396	300401	300403	300404	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Good - bye , ’
300408	300431	300433	300433	Bella	307	‘ If I knew which of your hands was the least spoilt , I would ask you to let me touch it , ’
300435	300463	300433	300433	Bella	307	‘ for the last time . But not because I repent of what I have said to you . For I do n’t . It ’s true ! ’
300464	300470	300472	300473	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Try the left hand , ’
300483	300490	300472	300473	Mr Boffin	324	‘ it ’s the least used . ’
300491	300502	300504	300504	Bella	307	‘ You have been wonderfully good and kind to me , ’
300506	300545	300504	300504	Bella	307	‘ and I kiss it for that . You have been as bad as bad could be to Mr Rokesmith , and I throw it away for that . Thank you for myself , and good - bye ! ’
300546	300551	300553	300554	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Good - bye , ’
300648	300658	300660	300660	Bella	307	‘ I wo n’t take one of the others , ’
300678	300696	300707	300707	she	307	‘ I ’ll leave all the presents behind , and begin again entirely on my own account . ’
300747	300754	300756	300756	Bella	307	‘ Now , I am complete , ’
300758	300805	300756	300756	Bella	307	‘ It ’s a little trying , but I have steeped my eyes in cold water , and I wo n’t cry any more . You have been a pleasant room to me , dear room . Adieu ! We shall never see each other again . ’
300949	300955	300957	300957	Bella	307	‘ That was well done ! ’
300971	301006	300957	300957	Bella	307	‘ If I had left myself any breath to cry with , I should have cried again . Now poor dear darling little Pa , you are going to see your lovely woman unexpectedly . ’
301456	301461	301462	301462	He	1004	‘ My gracious me ! ’
301481	301496	301497	301497	he	1004	‘ For it ’s after hours and I am all alone , my dear , ’
301500	301519	301497	301497	he	1004	‘ and am having — as I sometimes do when they are all gone — a quiet tea . ’
301549	301559	301561	301562	her father	1004	‘ I never was so surprised , my dear ! ’
301564	301608	301561	301562	her father	1004	‘ I could n’t believe my eyes . Upon my life , I thought they had taken to lying ! The idea of your coming down the Lane yourself ! Why did n’t you send the footman down the Lane , my dear ? ’
301609	301619	301561	301561	her	307	‘ I have brought no footman with me , Pa. ’
301620	301637	301561	301562	her father	1004	‘ Oh indeed ! But you have brought the elegant turn - out , my love ? ’
301638	301642	301561	301562	her father	1004	‘ No , Pa. ’
301643	301653	301561	301561	her	307	‘ You never can have walked , my dear ? ’
301654	301661	301662	301662	He	6718	‘ Yes , I have , Pa. ’
301685	301711	301675	301675	her	307	‘ The consequence is , Pa , that your lovely woman feels a little faint , and would very much like to share your tea . ’
301777	301782	301784	301785	her father	1004	‘ My dear child , ’
301787	301830	301784	301785	her father	1004	‘ the idea of your partaking of such lowly fare ! But at least you must have your own loaf and your own penn’orth . One moment , my dear . The Dairy is just over the way and round the corner . ’
301848	301853	301854	301854	he	1004	‘ My dear child , ’
301869	301877	301854	301854	he	1004	‘ the idea of a splendid — ! ’
301889	301897	301854	301854	he	1004	‘ What ’s the matter , Pa ? ’
301898	301905	301906	301906	he	1004	‘ — of a splendid female , ’
301911	301931	301906	301906	he	1004	‘ putting up with such accommodation as the present!—Is that a new dress you have on , my dear ? ’
301932	301947	301854	301854	he	1004	‘ No , Pa , an old one . Do n’t you remember it ? ’
301948	301960	301906	301906	he	1004	‘ Why , I THOUGHT I remembered it , my dear ! ’
301961	301971	301906	301906	he	1004	‘ You should , for you bought it , Pa. ’
301972	301983	301989	301989	himself	11485	‘ Yes , I THOUGHT I bought it my dear ! ’
302001	302020	301989	301989	himself	11485	‘ And have you grown so fickle that you do n’t like your own taste , Pa dear ? ’
302021	302027	302028	302028	he	11485	‘ Well , my love , ’
302051	302065	302028	302028	he	11485	‘ I should have thought it was hardly sufficiently splendid for existing circumstances . ’
302066	302072	302074	302074	Bella	307	‘ And so , Pa , ’
302086	302119	302074	302074	Bella	307	‘ you sometimes have a quiet tea here all alone ? I am not in the tea ’s way , if I draw my arm over your shoulder like this , Pa ? ’
302120	302190	302028	302028	he	11485	‘ Yes , my dear , and no , my dear . Yes to the first question , and Certainly Not to the second . Respecting the quiet tea , my dear , why you see the occupations of the day are sometimes a little wearing ; and if there ’s nothing interposed between the day and your mother , why SHE is sometimes a little wearing , too . ’
302191	302196	302074	302074	Bella	307	‘ I know , Pa. ’
302197	302236	302074	302074	Bella	307	‘ Yes , my dear . So sometimes I put a quiet tea at the window here , with a little quiet contemplation of the Lane ( which comes soothing ) , between the day , and domestic — ’
302237	302240	302242	302242	Bella	307	‘ Bliss , ’
302246	302251	302253	302254	her father	1004	‘ And domestic Bliss , ’
302267	302298	302263	302263	Bella	307	‘ And it is in this dark dingy place of captivity , poor dear , that you pass all the hours of your life when you are not at home ? ’
302299	302331	302376	302377	her father	1004	‘ Not at home , or not on the road there , or on the road here , my love . Yes . You see that little desk in the corner ? ’
302332	302356	302263	302263	Bella	307	‘ In the dark corner , furthest both from the light and from the fireplace ? The shabbiest desk of all the desks ? ’
302357	302374	302376	302377	her father	1004	‘ Now , does it really strike you in that point of view , my dear ? ’
302389	302401	302383	302383	his	1004	‘ that ’s mine . That ’s called Rumty ’s Perch . ’
302402	302406	302408	302408	Bella	307	‘ Whose Perch ? ’
302413	302439	302408	302408	Bella	307	‘ Rumty ’s . You see , being rather high and up two steps they call it a Perch . And they call ME Rumty . ’
302440	302445	302447	302447	Bella	307	‘ How dare they ! ’
302449	302451	302447	302447	Bella	307	‘ They ’re
302459	302463	302408	302408	Bella	307	’re playful . They ’re
302474	302513	302458	302458	they	6725	’re playful . What does it matter ? It might be Surly , or Sulky , or fifty disagreeable things that I really should n’t like to be considered . But Rumty ! Lor , why not Rumty ? ’
302558	302565	302566	302566	she	307	‘ I should have done better , ’
302569	302607	302566	302566	she	307	‘ to tell him at first ; I should have done better to tell him just now , when he had some slight misgiving ; he is quite happy again , and I shall make him wretched . ’
302666	302684	302662	302662	herself	307	‘ Pa dear , do n’t be cast down , but I must tell you something disagreeable ! ’

302727	302735	302702	302702	he	6726	‘ Why here ’s Mr Rokesmith now ! ’
302736	302745	302747	302747	Bella	307	‘ No , no , Pa , no , ’
302752	302756	302747	302747	Bella	307	‘ Surely not . ’

303531	303538	303540	303541	the cherub	11485	‘ I think , my dears , ’
303543	303596	303540	303541	the cherub	11485	‘ that if you could make it convenient to sit one on one side of me , and the other on the other , we should get on rather more consecutively , and make things rather plainer . John Rokesmith mentioned , a while ago , that he had no present occupation . ’
303597	303600	303602	303602	Rokesmith	315	‘ None , ’
303604	303611	303613	303613	Bella	307	‘ No , Pa , none , ’
303615	303621	303623	303624	the cherub	11485	‘ From which I argue , ’
303626	303634	303623	303624	the cherub	11485	‘ that he has left Mr Boffin ? ’
303635	303642	303540	303541	the cherub	11485	‘ Yes , Pa. And so — ’
303643	303671	303623	303624	the cherub	11485	‘ Stop a bit , my dear . I wish to lead up to it by degrees . And that Mr Boffin has not treated him well ? ’
303672	303682	303684	303684	Bella	307	‘ Has treated him most shamefully , dear Pa ! ’
303690	303694	303696	303697	the cherub	11485	‘ Of which , ’
303705	303728	303696	303697	the cherub	11485	‘ a certain mercenary young person distantly related to myself , could not approve ? Am I leading up to it right ? ’
303729	303737	303739	303739	Bella	307	‘ Could not approve , sweet Pa , ’
303750	303754	303756	303757	the cherub	11485	‘ Upon which , ’
303759	303841	303756	303757	the cherub	11485	‘ the certain mercenary young person distantly related to myself , having previously observed and mentioned to myself that prosperity was spoiling Mr Boffin , felt that she must not sell her sense of what was right and what was wrong , and what was true and what was false , and what was just and what was unjust , for any price that could be paid to her by any one alive ? Am I leading up to it right ? ’
303852	303859	303860	303861	the cherub	11485	‘ And therefore — and therefore , ’
303882	303943	303870	303870	Bella	307	‘ this mercenary young person distantly related to myself , refused the price , took off the splendid fashions that were part of it , put on the comparatively poor dress that I had last given her , and trusting to my supporting her in what was right , came straight to me . Have I led up to it ? ’
303962	303972	303974	303976	her good father	6744	‘ The mercenary young person distantly related to myself , ’
303978	304096	303974	303976	her good father	6744	‘ did well ! The mercenary young person distantly related to myself , did not trust to me in vain ! I admire this mercenary young person distantly related to myself , more in this dress than if she had come to me in China silks , Cashmere shawls , and Golconda diamonds . I love this young person dearly . I say to the man of this young person ’s heart , out of my heart and with all of it , “ My blessing on this engagement betwixt you , and she brings you a good fortune when she brings you the poverty she has accepted for your sake and the honest truth ’s ! ” ’
304143	304194	304132	304132	He	6745	‘ And now , my dear child , if you think you can entertain John Rokesmith for a minute and a half , I ’ll run over to the Dairy , and fetch HIM a cottage loaf and a drink of milk , that we may all have tea together . ’
304229	304237	304199	304199	Bella	307	‘ Somebody ’s been drinking MY milk ! ’
304307	304311	304313	304314	the cherub	11485	‘ To think , ’
304324	304365	304313	304314	the cherub	11485	‘ that anything of a tender nature should come off here , is what tickles me . To think that ever I should have seen my Bella folded in the arms of her future husband , HERE , you know ! ’
304414	304427	304394	304395	the cherub	11485	‘ Hem!—Have you thought at all about your mother , my dear ? ’
304428	304432	304394	304395	the cherub	11485	‘ Yes , Pa. ’
304433	304445	304394	304395	the cherub	11485	‘ And your sister Lavvy , for instance , my dear ? ’
304446	304486	304394	304395	the cherub	11485	‘ Yes , Pa. I think we had better not enter into particulars at home . I think it will be quite enough to say that I had a difference with Mr Boffin , and have left for good . ’
304487	304499	304501	304502	her father	1004	‘ John Rokesmith being acquainted with your Ma , my love , ’
304509	304530	304501	304502	her father	1004	‘ I need have no delicacy in hinting before him that you may perhaps find your Ma a little wearing . ’
304531	304538	304540	304540	Bella	307	‘ A little , patient Pa ? ’
304557	304578	304579	304580	the cherub	11485	‘ Well ! We ’ll say , strictly in confidence among ourselves , wearing ; we wo n’t qualify it , ’
304584	304593	304579	304580	the cherub	11485	‘ And your sister ’s temper is wearing . ’
304594	304601	304501	304502	her father	1004	‘ I do n’t mind , Pa. ’
304602	304614	304616	304617	her father	1004	‘ And you must prepare yourself you know , my precious , ’
304623	304649	304616	304617	her father	1004	‘ for our looking very poor and meagre at home , and being at the best but very uncomfortable , after Mr Boffin ’s house . ’
304650	304667	304501	304502	her father	1004	‘ I do n’t mind , Pa. I could bear much harder trials — for John . ’
304701	304704	304706	304707	the cherub	11485	‘ Well ! ’
304715	304747	304706	304707	the cherub	11485	‘ when you — when you come back from retirement , my love , and reappear on the surface , I think it will be time to lock up and go . ’
304800	304819	304821	304821	her	307	‘ Show me what you do here all day long , dear Pa. Do you write like this ? ’
304937	304965	304933	304933	he	6767	‘ I think , my dears , I ’ll take the lead on the other side of the road , and seem not to belong to you . ’
305020	305026	305027	305028	the cherub	11485	‘ I think , John , ’
305033	305054	305027	305028	the cherub	11485	‘ that if you can spare me the young person distantly related to myself , I ’ll take her in . ’
305055	305062	305064	305064	John	315	‘ I ca n’t spare her , ’
305066	305076	305064	305064	John	315	‘ but I must lend her to you.—My Darling ! ’
305089	305095	305097	305097	Bella	307	‘ Now , dearest Pa , ’
305104	305135	305097	305097	Bella	307	‘ put your hand in mine , and we ’ll run home as fast as ever we can run , and get it over . Now , Pa. Once ! — ’
305136	305140	305141	305142	the cherub	11485	‘ My dear , ’
305152	305163	305141	305142	the cherub	11485	‘ I was going to observe that if your mother — ’
305164	305177	305179	305179	Bella	307	‘ You must n’t hang back , sir , to gain time , ’
305187	305219	305183	305183	her	307	‘ do you see that , sir ? That ’s the mark ; come up to the mark , sir . Once ! Twice ! Three times and away , Pa ! ’
305247	305253	305255	305255	Bella	307	‘ Now , dear Pa , ’
305278	305285	305255	305255	Bella	307	‘ we are in for it ! ’
305311	305319	305321	305322	Miss Lavvy	317	‘ Why , it ’s never Bella ! ’
305333	305340	305321	305322	Miss Lavvy	317	‘ Ma ! Here ’s Bella ! ’
305376	305386	305388	305388	she	302	‘ My child is welcome , though unlooked for , ’
305410	305434	305388	305388	she	302	‘ You too , R. W. , are welcome , though late . Does the male domestic of Mrs Boffin hear me there ? ’
305455	305466	305468	305468	Bella	307	‘ There is no one waiting , Ma , dear , ’
305470	305477	305468	305468	Bella	307	‘ There is no one waiting ? ’
305485	305492	305479	305480	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ No , Ma , dear . ’
305509	305513	305516	305516	she	302	‘ An Enigma ! ’
305535	305541	305532	305532	she	302	‘ Unless , R. W. : ’
305550	305598	305532	305532	she	302	‘ you have taken the precaution of making some addition to our frugal supper on your way home , it will prove but a distasteful one to Bella . Cold neck of mutton and a lettuce can ill compete with the luxuries of Mr Boffin ’s board . ’
305599	305610	305612	305612	Bella	307	‘ Pray do n’t talk like that , Ma dear , ’
305614	305624	305612	305612	Bella	307	‘ Mr Boffin ’s board is nothing to me . ’
305643	305648	305661	305661	her	302	‘ Why , Bella ! ’
305649	305657	305661	305661	her	302	‘ Yes , Lavvy , I know . ’
305678	305683	305661	305661	her	302	‘ Why , Bella ! ’
305684	305726	305661	305661	her	302	‘ Yes , Lavvy , I know what I have got on . I was going to tell Ma when you interrupted . I have left Mr Boffin ’s house for good , Ma , and I have come home again . ’
305773	305780	305782	305782	Bella	307	‘ In short , dear Ma , ’
305795	305834	305782	305782	Bella	307	‘ I have had a very serious difference with Mr Boffin on the subject of his treatment of a member of his household , and it ’s a final difference , and there ’s an end of all . ’
305835	305847	305849	305850	R. W.	304	‘ And I am bound to tell you , my dear , ’
305854	305890	305849	305850	R. W.	304	‘ that Bella has acted in a truly brave spirit , and with a truly right feeling . And therefore I hope , my dear , you ’ll not allow yourself to be greatly disappointed . ’
305891	305894	305896	305897	Miss Lavvy	317	‘ George ! ’
305912	305927	305896	305897	Miss Lavvy	317	‘ George Sampson , speak ! What did I tell you about those Boffins ? ’
305981	305985	305972	305972	he	249	‘ Yes indeed . ’
305986	306000	306002	306003	Miss Lavvy	317	‘ Yes ! I told George Sampson , as George Sampson tells you , ’
306005	306060	306002	306003	Miss Lavvy	317	‘ that those hateful Boffins would pick a quarrel with Bella , as soon as her novelty had worn off . Have they done it , or have they not ? Was I right , or was I wrong ? And what do you say to us , Bella , of your Boffins now ? ’
306061	306066	306068	306068	Bella	307	‘ Lavvy and Ma , ’
306070	306124	306068	306068	Bella	307	‘ I say of Mr and Mrs Boffin what I always have said ; and I always shall say of them what I always have said . But nothing will induce me to quarrel with any one to - night . I hope you are not sorry to see me , Ma dear , ’
306128	306142	306068	306068	Bella	307	‘ and I hope you are not sorry to see me , Lavvy , ’
306147	306167	306168	306168	Bella	307	‘ and as I notice the lettuce Ma mentioned , on the table , I ’ll make the salad . ’
306271	306277	306279	306279	Bella	307	‘ Now , Ma dear , ’
306284	306298	306299	306300	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ the salad ’s ready , and it ’s past supper - time . ’
306307	306310	306315	306315	her	310	‘ George ! ’
306320	306325	306315	306315	her	310	‘ Ma ’s chair ! ’
306410	306420	306405	306407	a third person	6788	‘ Mutton to your Ma , Bella , my dear ’
306423	306445	306405	306407	a third person	6788	‘ Lavvy , I dare say your Ma would take some lettuce if you were to put it on her plate . ’
306488	306496	306468	306468	she	302	‘ What is this I am doing ? ’
306598	306639	306641	306641	Lavinia	310	‘ It was not worth troubling you about , Bella , when you were in a sphere so far removed from your family as to make it a matter in which you could be expected to take very little interest , ’
306649	306660	306646	306646	her	310	‘ but George Sampson is paying his addresses to me . ’
306720	306728	306730	306731	Miss Lavinia	310	‘ George is getting on very well , ’
306768	306783	306785	306785	you	310	’ here Miss Lavinia checked herself in a bounce , and added more placidly , ‘
306804	306805	306795	306795	I	0	’ ‘
306816	306817	306812	306812	I	0	’ ‘
306882	306883	306889	306890	dear Lavvy	317	’ ‘
306892	306896	306889	306890	dear Lavvy	317	’ said Bella . ‘
306903	306908	306889	306890	dear Lavvy	317	’ replied Miss Lavinia ; ‘
306969	306970	306963	306963	I	0	’ ‘
306981	306989	306973	306973	you	317	’ inquired Bella , with a smile . ‘
307002	307007	307000	307000	Bella	307	’ replied the Irrepressible . ‘
307102	307175	307098	307098	I	0	’ Whether the Irrepressible felt slighted by Bella ’s declaration that she would not quarrel , or whether her spitefulness was evoked by Bella ’s return to the sphere of Mr George Sampson ’s courtship , or whether it was a necessary fillip to her spirits that she should come into collision with somebody on the present occasion,—anyhow she made a dash at her stately parent now , with the greatest impetuosity . ‘
307213	307214	307216	307216	you	310	’ ‘
307223	307228	307216	307216	you	310	’ said Mrs Wilfer . ‘
307233	307234	307230	307230	you	310	’ ‘
307245	307275	307282	307283	Mrs Wilfer	302	’ sake . A girl who is old enough to be engaged , is quite old enough to object to be stared at as if she was a Clock . ’
307276	307280	307282	307283	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Audacious one ! ’
307285	307313	307282	307283	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Your grandmamma , if so addressed by one of her daughters , at any age , would have insisted on her retiring to a dark apartment . ’
307314	307318	307323	307323	her	728	‘ My grandmamma , ’
307332	307346	307323	307323	her	728	‘ would n’t have sat staring people out of countenance , I think . ’
307347	307351	307353	307354	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ She would ! ’
307356	307368	307370	307370	Lavvy	728	‘ Then it ’s a pity she did n’t know better , ’
307372	307441	307370	307370	Lavvy	728	‘ And if my grandmamma was n’t in her dotage when she took to insisting on people ’s retiring to dark apartments , she ought to have been . A pretty exhibition my grandmamma must have made of herself ! I wonder whether she ever insisted on people ’s retiring into the ball of St Paul ’s ; and if she did , how she got them there ! ’
307442	307445	307447	307448	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Silence ! ’
307450	307455	307447	307448	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ I command silence ! ’
307456	307469	307471	307471	Lavinia	310	‘ I have not the slightest intention of being silent , Ma , ’
307474	307558	307471	307471	Lavinia	310	‘ but quite the contrary . I am not going to be eyed as if I had come from the Boffins , and sit silent under it . I am not going to have George Sampson eyed as if HE had come from the Boffins , and sit silent under it . If Pa thinks proper to be eyed as if HE had come from the Boffins also , well and good . I do n’t choose to . And I wo n’t ! ’
307576	307624	307570	307571	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ You rebellious spirit ! You mutinous child ! Tell me this , Lavinia . If in violation of your mother ’s sentiments , you had condescended to allow yourself to be patronized by the Boffins , and if you had come from those halls of slavery — ’
307625	307633	307635	307635	Lavinia	310	‘ That ’s mere nonsense , Ma , ’
307637	307640	307642	307643	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ How ! ’
307649	307662	307642	307643	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Halls of slavery , Ma , is mere stuff and nonsense , ’
307668	307719	307570	307571	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ I say , presumptuous child , if you had come from the neighbourhood of Portland Place , bending under the yoke of patronage and attended by its domestics in glittering garb to visit me , do you think my deep - seated feelings could have been expressed in looks ? ’
307720	307729	307731	307731	Lavinia	310	‘ All I think about it , is , ’
307733	307745	307731	307731	Lavinia	310	‘ that I should wish them expressed to the right person . ’
307746	307750	307752	307753	her mother	8936	‘ And if , ’
307755	307824	307825	307825	Lavinia	310	‘ if making light of my warnings that the face of Mrs Boffin alone was a face teeming with evil , you had clung to Mrs Boffin instead of to me , and had after all come home rejected by Mrs Boffin , trampled under foot by Mrs Boffin , and cast out by Mrs Boffin , do you think my feelings could have been expressed in looks ? ’
307852	307873	307847	307847	Bella	307	‘ Good night , dear Ma . I have had a tiring day , and I ’ll go to bed . ’
308001	308013	308015	308016	the cherub	11485	‘ My dear , you most unquestionably ARE a lovely woman , ’
308026	308032	308034	308034	Bella	307	‘ Look here , sir , ’
308036	308072	308034	308034	Bella	307	‘ when your lovely woman marries , you shall have that piece if you like , and she ’ll make you a chain of it . Would you prize that remembrance of the dear creature ? ’
308073	308079	308034	308034	Bella	307	‘ Yes , my precious . ’
308080	308088	308034	308034	Bella	307	‘ Then you shall have it if you ’re
308111	308112	308093	308093	I	0	’ ‘
308116	308127	308093	308093	I	0	’ returned her father , in the simplest good faith , ‘
308182	308213	308297	308297	she	6816	’re never out of a wearing subject , my dear , I assure you . I am afraid you find your old room with Lavvy , dreadfully inconvenient , Bella ? ’

308240	308281	308320	308320	she	6816	‘ Well , my child , you used to complain of it when it was n’t such a contrast as it must be now . Upon my word , I can only answer , because you are so much improved . ’

308340	308494	308338	308338	Bella	307	‘ Your lovely woman was told her fortune to night on her way home . It wo n’t be a large fortune , because if the lovely woman ’s Intended gets a certain appointment that he hopes to get soon , she will marry on a hundred and fifty pounds a year . But that ’s at first , and even if it should never be more , the lovely woman will make it quite enough . But that ’s not all , sir . In the fortune there ’s a certain fair man — a little man , the fortune - teller said — who , it seems , will always find himself near the lovely woman , and will always have kept , expressly for him , such a peaceful corner in the lovely woman ’s little house as never was . Tell me the name of that man , sir . ’

308533	308626	308523	308523	Bella	307	‘ He ’s the Knave of Wilfers ! Dear Pa , the lovely woman means to look forward to this fortune that has been told for her , so delightfully , and to cause it to make her a much better lovely woman than she ever has been yet . What the little fair man is expected to do , sir , is to look forward to it also , by saying to himself when he is in danger of being over - worried , “ I see land at last ! ” ‘
308633	308638	308523	308523	Bella	307	’ repeated her father . ‘
308647	308660	308641	308644	a dear Knave of	6819	’ exclaimed Bella ; then putting out her small white bare foot , ‘
308721	308765	308711	308713	fair little man	6824	’ Chapter 17 A SOCIAL CHORUS Amazement sits enthroned upon the countenances of Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle ’s circle of acquaintance , when the disposal of their first - class furniture and effects ( including a Billiard Table in capital letters ) , ‘
308775	309338	308711	308713	fair little man	6824	’ is publicly announced on a waving hearthrug in Sackville Street . But , nobody is half so much amazed as Hamilton Veneering , Esquire , M.P. for Pocket - Breaches , who instantly begins to find out that the Lammles are the only people ever entered on his soul ’s register , who are NOT the oldest and dearest friends he has in the world . Mrs Veneering , W.M.P. for Pocket - Breaches , like a faithful wife shares her husband ’s discovery and inexpressible astonishment . Perhaps the Veneerings twain may deem the last unutterable feeling particularly due to their reputation , by reason that once upon a time some of the longer heads in the City are whispered to have shaken themselves , when Veneering ’s extensive dealings and great wealth were mentioned . But , it is certain that neither Mr nor Mrs Veneering can find words to wonder in , and it becomes necessary that they give to the oldest and dearest friends they have in the world , a wondering dinner . For , it is by this time noticeable that , whatever befals , the Veneerings must give a dinner upon it . Lady Tippins lives in a chronic state of invitation to dine with the Veneerings , and in a chronic state of inflammation arising from the dinners . Boots and Brewer go about in cabs , with no other intelligible business on earth than to beat up people to come and dine with the Veneerings . Veneering pervades the legislative lobbies , intent upon entrapping his fellow - legislators to dinner . Mrs Veneering dined with five - and - twenty bran - new faces over night ; calls upon them all to day ; sends them every one a dinner - card to - morrow , for the week after next ; before that dinner is digested , calls upon their brothers and sisters , their sons and daughters , their nephews and nieces , their aunts and uncles and cousins , and invites them all to dinner . And still , as at first , howsoever , the dining circle widens , it is to be observed that all the diners are consistent in appearing to go to the Veneerings , not to dine with Mr and Mrs Veneering ( which would seem to be the last thing in their minds ) , but to dine with one another . Perhaps , after all,—who knows?—Veneering may find this dining , though expensive , remunerative , in the sense that it makes champions . Mr Podsnap , as a representative man , is not alone in caring very particularly for his own dignity , if not for that of his acquaintances , and therefore in angrily supporting the acquaintances who have taken out his Permit , lest , in their being lessened , he should be . The gold and silver camels , and the ice - pails , and the rest of the Veneering table decorations , make a brilliant show , and when I , Podsnap , casually remark elsewhere that I dined last Monday with a gorgeous caravan of camels , I find it personally offensive to have it hinted to me that they are broken - kneed camels , or camels labouring under suspicion of any sort . ‘
309389	309480	309373	309373	you	6828	’ The camels are polishing up in the Analytical ’s pantry for the dinner of wonderment on the occasion of the Lammles going to pieces , and Mr Twemlow feels a little queer on the sofa at his lodgings over the stable yard in Duke Street , Saint James ’s , in consequence of having taken two advertised pills at about mid - day , on the faith of the printed representation accompanying the box ( price one and a penny halfpenny , government stamp included ) , that the same ‘
309499	309552	309553	309554	A lady	9939	’ To whom , while sickly with the fancy of an insoluble pill sticking in his gullet , and also with the sensation of a deposit of warm gum languidly wandering within him a little lower down , a servant enters with the announcement that a lady wishes to speak with him . ‘
309556	309565	309553	309554	A lady	9939	’ says Twemlow , pluming his ruffled feathers . ‘
309575	309665	309667	309668	the lady	2213	’ The lady ’s name is Lammle . The lady will not detain Mr Twemlow longer than a very few minutes . The lady is sure that Mr Twemlow will do her the kindness to see her , on being told that she particularly desires a short interview . The lady has no doubt whatever of Mr Twemlow ’s compliance when he hears her name . Has begged the servant to be particular not to mistake her name . Would have sent in a card , but has none . ‘
309671	309778	309667	309668	the lady	2213	’ Lady shown in , comes in . Mr Twemlow ’s little rooms are modestly furnished , in an old - fashioned manner ( rather like the housekeeper ’s room at Snigsworthy Park ) , and would be bare of mere ornament , were it not for a full - length engraving of the sublime Snigsworth over the chimneypiece , snorting at a Corinthian column , with an enormous roll of paper at his feet , and a heavy curtain going to tumble down on his head ; those accessories being understood to represent the noble lord as somehow in the act of saving his country . ‘
309787	309798	309784	309785	Mrs Lammle	423	’ Mrs Lammle takes a seat and opens the conversation . ‘
309843	309861	309804	309805	Mr Twemlow	271	’ Mindful of the wondering dinner , Twemlow , with a little twinge , admits the imputation . ‘
309867	309885	309804	309805	Mr Twemlow	271	’ says Mrs Lammle , with a certain hardened manner upon her , that makes Twemlow shrink , ‘
309937	309958	309932	309932	I	0	’ Mr Twemlow ’s dry and hollow cheeks become more dry and hollow at the prospect of some new complication . ‘

310026	310058	310059	310059	My	0	’ Mrs Lammle , by far the more observant of the two , scarcely finds it necessary to look at Twemlow while he speaks , so easily does she read him . ‘
310133	310162	310163	310163	I	0	’ Twemlow going on to reply , she rests her eyes again , knowing her ears to be quite enough for the contents of so weak a vessel . ‘
310169	310175	310166	310166	I	0	’ says Twemlow , nervously , ‘

310231	310253	310229	310229	Sir	8755	’ says Mrs Lammle , raising her eyes to his face again , and quite daunting him with her hardened manner , ‘

310285	310289	310282	310282	I	0	’ says Twemlow . ‘
310342	310368	310369	310370	Mr Twemlow	271	’ Seeing the effect she produces on him by her indifferent laugh and cold look , she keeps her eyes upon him as she proceeds . ‘
310463	310476	310455	310456	a gentleman	8943	’ Twemlow sits murmuring to himself with his hand to his forehead . ‘
310484	310490	310455	310456	a gentleman	8943	’ Mrs Lammle goes on , ‘
310516	310543	310507	310507	I	0	’ She looks steadily at Mr Twemlow , until , with a shrug , he makes her a little one - sided bow , as though saying ‘
310557	310572	310548	310548	you	271	’ and then she moistens her lips , and shows a sense of relief . ‘
310606	310607	310603	310604	Mr Twemlow	271	’ ‘
310610	310619	310621	310621	me	0	’ says Twemlow , rising as she rises . ‘

310736	310759	310732	310732	he	548	’ retorts Mrs Lammle , who again has saved her eyes while listening , and uses them with strong effect while speaking . ‘
310762	310763	310732	310732	he	548	’ ‘
310776	310784	310768	310768	he	548	’ says Mrs Lammle , seriously pondering . ‘
310795	310846	310768	310768	he	548	’ Twemlow hesitates . He is shorter than the lady as well as weaker , and , as she stands above him with her hardened manner and her well - used eyes , he finds himself at such a disadvantage that he would like to be of the opposite sex . ‘
310861	310862	310863	310863	I	0	’ ‘
310867	310881	310768	310768	he	548	’ says the mild little gentleman , coming to his answer by degrees , ‘

311166	311167	311168	311169	Mr Twemlow	271	’ ‘
311171	311197	311168	311169	Mr Twemlow	271	’ says Mrs Lammle , fixing his eyes with hers : which he would prevent her doing if he could , but he ca n’t ; ‘
311263	311264	311229	311229	your	271	’ ‘
311267	311274	311229	311229	your	271	’ cries Twemlow , standing aghast . ‘
311281	311282	311277	311277	you	271	’ ‘
311309	311310	311229	311229	your	271	’ ‘

311326	311340	311229	311229	your	271	’ says Mrs Lammle , coldly and boldly , and with some disdain , ‘
311408	311409	311397	311398	Mr Twemlow	271	’ ‘
311415	311422	311413	311413	madam	5021	’ Twemlow ventures gently to argue . ‘
311442	311443	311444	311444	Men	928	’ ‘
311452	311472	311474	311474	they	928	’ quoth Mrs Lammle , glancing haughtily at the Snigsworth portrait , and shaking out her dress before departing ; ‘
311587	311618	311619	311619	I	0	’ As she moves towards the door , Mr Twemlow , attending on her , expresses his soothing hope that the condition of Mr Lammle ’s affairs is not irretrievable . ‘
311624	311649	311619	311619	I	0	’ Mrs Lammle answers , stopping , and sketching out the pattern of the paper on the wall with the point of her parasol ; ‘
311691	311716	311688	311688	I	0	’ Mr Twemlow , in his good - natured desire to make the best of it , remarks that there are pleasant lives abroad . ‘
311719	311730	311688	311688	I	0	’ returns Mrs Lammle , still sketching on the wall ; ‘
311766	311831	311835	311836	Mr Twemlow	271	’ It is much for Mr Lammle , Twemlow politely intimates ( though greatly shocked ) , to have one always beside him who is attached to him in all his fortunes , and whose restraining influence will prevent him from courses that would be discreditable and ruinous . As he says it , Mrs Lammle leaves off sketching , and looks at him . ‘
311936	312495	312749	312749	I.	6879	’ With those words , she walks out into Duke Street , Saint James ’s . Mr Twemlow returning to his sofa , lays down his aching head on its slippery little horsehair bolster , with a strong internal conviction that a painful interview is not the kind of thing to be taken after the dinner pills which are so highly salutary in connexion with the pleasures of the table . But , six o’clock in the evening finds the worthy little gentleman getting better , and also getting himself into his obsolete little silk stockings and pumps , for the wondering dinner at the Veneerings . And seven o’clock in the evening finds him trotting out into Duke Street , to trot to the corner and save a sixpence in coach - hire . Tippins the divine has dined herself into such a condition by this time , that a morbid mind might desire her , for a blessed change , to sup at last , and turn into bed . Such a mind has Mr Eugene Wrayburn , whom Twemlow finds contemplating Tippins with the moodiest of visages , while that playful creature rallies him on being so long overdue at the woolsack . Skittish is Tippins with Mortimer Lightwood too , and has raps to give him with her fan for having been best man at the nuptials of these deceiving what’s - their - names who have gone to pieces . Though , indeed , the fan is generally lively , and taps away at the men in all directions , with something of a grisly sound suggestive of the clattering of Lady Tippins ’s bones . A new race of intimate friends has sprung up at Veneering ’s since he went into Parliament for the public good , to whom Mrs Veneering is very attentive . These friends , like astronomical distances , are only to be spoken of in the very largest figures . Boots says that one of them is a Contractor who ( it has been calculated ) gives employment , directly and indirectly , to five hundred thousand men . Brewer says that another of them is a Chairman , in such request at so many Boards , so far apart , that he never travels less by railway than three thousand miles a week . Buffer says that another of them had n’t a sixpence eighteen months ago , and , through the brilliancy of his genius in getting those shares issued at eighty - five , and buying them all up with no money and selling them at par for cash , has now three hundred and seventy - five thousand pounds — Buffer particularly insisting on the odd seventy - five , and declining to take a farthing less . With Buffer , Boots , and Brewer , Lady Tippins is eminently facetious on the subject of these Fathers of the Scrip - Church : surveying them through her eyeglass , and inquiring whether Boots and Brewer and Buffer think they will make her fortune if she makes love to them ? with other pleasantries of that nature . Veneering , in his different way , is much occupied with the Fathers too , piously retiring with them into the conservatory , from which retreat the word ‘
312497	312711	312712	312712	I	0	’ is occasionally heard , and where the Fathers instruct Veneering how he must leave the valley of the piano on his left , take the level of the mantelpiece , cross by an open cutting at the candelabra , seize the carrying - traffic at the console , and cut up the opposition root and branch at the window curtains . Mr and Mrs Podsnap are of the company , and the Fathers descry in Mrs Podsnap a fine woman . She is consigned to a Father — Boots ’s Father , who employs five hundred thousand men — and is brought to anchor on Veneering ’s left ; thus affording opportunity to the sportive Tippins on his right ( he , as usual , being mere vacant space ) , to entreat to be told something about those loves of Navvies , and whether they really do live on raw beefsteaks , and drink porter out of their barrows . But , in spite of such little skirmishes it is felt that this was to be a wondering dinner , and that the wondering must not be neglected . Accordingly , Brewer , as the man who has the greatest reputation to sustain , becomes the interpreter of the general instinct . ‘
312715	312723	312749	312749	I.	6879	’ says Brewer in a favourable pause , ‘
312737	312746	312730	312730	I	0	’ Boots ( devoured by envy ) says , ‘
312750	312754	312757	312757	I	0	’ Buffer says , ‘
312758	312772	312757	312757	I	0	’ ; but can find nobody to care whether he did or not . ‘
312779	312783	312784	312784	I	0	’ inquires Veneering . ‘
312788	312810	312784	312784	I	0	’ replies Brewer , looking about for anybody else to address his answer to , and giving the preference to Lightwood ; ‘
312831	312832	312834	312834	I	0	’ ‘
312839	312931	312834	312834	I	0	’ says Lightwood . Brewer begs to know now , would it be fair to ask a professional man how — on — earth — these — people — ever — did — come — TO — such — A — total smash ? ( Brewer ’s divisions being for emphasis . ) Lightwood replies that he was consulted certainly , but could give no opinion which would pay off the Bill of Sale , and therefore violates no confidence in supposing that it came of their living beyond their means . ‘
312935	312939	312834	312834	I	0	’ says Veneering , ‘
312945	313002	312834	312834	I	0	’ Hah ! That is felt on all hands to be a shot in the bull ’s eye . How CAN people do that ! The Analytical Chemist going round with champagne , looks very much as if HE could give them a pretty good idea how people did that , if he had a mind . ‘
313005	313040	312834	312834	I	0	’ says Mrs Veneering , laying down her fork to press her aquiline hands together at the tips of the fingers , and addressing the Father who travels the three thousand miles per week : ‘
313066	313085	313061	313061	I	0	’ Eugene suggests that Mrs Lammle , not being a mother , had no baby to look at . ‘
313088	313093	313061	313061	I	0	’ says Mrs Veneering , ‘
313101	313169	313061	313061	I	0	’ Boots is clear that the principle is the same . So is Buffer . It is the unfortunate destiny of Buffer to damage a cause by espousing it . The rest of the company have meekly yielded to the proposition that the principle is the same , until Buffer says it is ; when instantly a general murmur arises that the principle is not the same . ‘
313176	313191	313171	313171	I	0	’ says the Father of the three hundred and seventy - five thousand pounds , ‘
313212	313230	313210	313210	society	6410	’ Veneering is bound to confess that they dined here , and were even married from here . ‘
313237	313242	313232	313232	I	0	’ pursues the Father , ‘
313287	313305	313232	313232	I	0	’ Eugene ( who would seem to be in a gloomy state of suggestiveness ) , suggests , ‘
313316	313388	313232	313232	I	0	’ This is too insolvent a state of things for the Father to entertain . It is too insolvent a state of things for any one with any self - respect to entertain , and is universally scouted . But , it is so amazing how any people can have come to a total smash , that everybody feels bound to account for it specially . One of the Fathers says , ‘
313392	313399	313232	313232	I	0	’ Another of the Fathers says , ‘
313409	313412	313413	313413	Horses	732	’ Boots says ‘
313415	313423	313413	313413	Horses	732	’ Lady Tippins says to her fan , ‘
313427	313453	313413	313413	Horses	732	’ Mr Podsnap , saying nothing , is referred to for his opinion ; which he delivers as follows ; much flushed and extremely angry : ‘
313499	313708	313497	313497	I	0	’ And with his favourite right - arm flourish which sweeps away everything and settles it for ever , Mr Podsnap sweeps these inconveniently unexplainable wretches who have lived beyond their means and gone to total smash , off the face of the universe . Eugene , leaning back in his chair , is observing Mr Podsnap with an irreverent face , and may be about to offer a new suggestion , when the Analytical is beheld in collision with the Coachman ; the Coachman manifesting a purpose of coming at the company with a silver salver , as though intent upon making a collection for his wife and family ; the Analytical cutting him off at the sideboard . The superior stateliness , if not the superior generalship , of the Analytical prevails over a man who is as nothing off the box ; and the Coachman , yielding up his salver , retires defeated . Then , the Analytical , perusing a scrap of paper lying on the salver , with the air of a literary Censor , adjusts it , takes his time about going to the table with it , and presents it to Mr Eugene Wrayburn . Whereupon the pleasant Tippins says aloud , ‘
313715	313777	313709	313711	The Lord Chancellor	6891	’ With distracting coolness and slowness — for he knows the curiosity of the Charmer to be always devouring — Eugene makes a pretence of getting out an eyeglass , polishing it , and reading the paper with difficulty , long after he has seen what is written on it . What is written on it in wet ink , is : ‘
313781	313782	313778	313779	Young Blight	385	’ ‘
313785	313799	313778	313779	Young Blight	385	’ says Eugene over his shoulder , in confidence , with the Analytical . ‘
313802	313812	313778	313779	Young Blight	385	’ returns the Analytical in responsive confidence . Eugene looks ‘
313816	313839	313814	313814	me	0	’ towards Mrs Veneering , goes out , and finds Young Blight , Mortimer ’s clerk , at the hall - door . ‘
313866	313879	313881	313881	I	0	’ says that discreet young gentleman , standing on tiptoe to whisper ; ‘

313973	314031	313967	313967	I	0	’ Goes out straightway , and , leisurely leaning his arms on the open window of a cab in waiting , looks in at Mr Dolls : who has brought his own atmosphere with him , and would seem from its odour to have brought it , for convenience of carriage , in a rum - cask . ‘
314038	314039	314033	314033	Dolls	702	’ ‘
314048	314109	313967	313967	I	0	’ After carefully reading the dingy scrap of paper handed to him , and as carefully tucking it into his waistcoat pocket , Eugene tells out the money ; beginning incautiously by telling the first shilling into Mr Dolls ’s hand , which instantly jerks it out of window ; and ending by telling the fifteen shillings on the seat . ‘
314129	314163	314164	314164	I	0	’ Returning to the dining - room , and pausing for an instant behind the screen at the door , Eugene overhears , above the hum and clatter , the fair Tippins saying : ‘
314177	314178	314180	314180	you	702	’ ‘
314182	314186	314180	314180	you	702	’ mutters Eugene , ‘

BOOK THE FOURTH — A TURNING Chapter 1 SETTING TRAPS Plashwater Weir Mill Lock looked tranquil and pretty on an evening in the summer time . A soft air stirred the leaves of the fresh green trees , and passed like a smooth shadow over the river , and like a smoother shadow over the yielding grass . The voice of the falling water , like the voices of the sea and the wind , were as an outer memory to a contemplative listener ; but not particularly so to Mr Riderhood , who sat on one of the blunt wooden levers of his lock - gates , dozing . Wine must be got into a butt by some agency before it can be drawn out ; and the wine of sentiment never having been got into Mr Riderhood by any agency , nothing in nature tapped him . As the Rogue sat , ever and again nodding himself off his balance , his recovery was always attended by an angry stare and growl , as if , in the absence of any one else , he had aggressive inclinations towards himself . In one of these starts the cry of ‘
314462	314533	314219	314219	I	0	’ prevented his relapse into a doze . Shaking himself as he got up like the surly brute he was , he gave his growl a responsive twist at the end , and turned his face down - stream to see who hailed . It was an amateur - sculler , well up to his work though taking it easily , in so light a boat that the Rogue remarked : ‘
314545	314549	314219	314219	I	0	’ been a Wagerbut ’
314602	314606	314607	314609	Mr Eugene Wrayburn	269	‘ T’other governor , ’
314858	314873	314875	314875	Eugene	269	‘ Ay , ay ? It ’s you , is it , honest friend ? ’
314885	314893	314875	314875	Eugene	269	‘ You got the place , then ? ’
314894	314915	314918	314918	Riderhood	360	‘ I got the place , and no thanks to you for it , nor yet none to Lawyer Lightwood , ’
314920	314929	314931	314931	Eugene	269	‘ We saved our recommendation , honest fellow , ’
314933	314965	314931	314931	Eugene	269	‘ for the next candidate — the one who will offer himself when you are transported or hanged . Do n’t be long about it ; will you be so good ? ’
315214	315232	315198	315198	Riderhood	360	‘ Hi — I — i ! Lock , ho ! Lock ! Plashwater Weir Mill Lock ! ’

315298	315304	315306	315306	Riderhood	360	‘ Wish I may die , ’

315347	315445	315317	315317	he	360	’ Truly , Bradley Headstone had taken careful note of the honest man ’s dress in the course of that night - walk they had had together . He must have committed it to memory , and slowly got it by heart . It was exactly reproduced in the dress he now wore . And whereas , in his own schoolmaster clothes , he usually looked as if they were the clothes of some other man , he now looked , in the clothes of some other man or men , as if they were his own . ‘
315450	315461	315462	315462	they	6924	’ said Bradley , whose surprise had a genuine air ; ‘

315534	315568	315574	315574	YOU’VE	9945	’ As he expressively jerked his pointing finger in the direction the boat had taken , a flush of impatience mounted into Bradley ’s face , and he looked anxiously up the river . ‘
315580	315593	315574	315574	YOU’VE	9945	’ said Riderhood , when the schoolmaster ’s eyes came back again . ‘

315668	315675	315655	315655	I	0	’ was the coolly growled reply . ‘

315753	315764	315766	315766	Riderhood	360	‘ Ha ha ! Do n’t be afeerd , T’otherest , ’
315768	315837	315766	315766	Riderhood	360	‘ The T’other ’s got to make way agin the stream , and he takes it easy . You can soon come up with him . But wot ’s the good of saying that to you ! YOU know how fur you could have outwalked him betwixt anywheres about where he lost the tide — say Richmond — and this , if you had a mind to it . ’
315838	315847	315849	315849	Bradley	517	‘ You think I have been following him ? ’
315851	315857	315859	315859	Riderhood	360	‘ I KNOW you have , ’
315861	315870	315871	315871	Bradley	517	‘ Well ! I have , I have , ’
315874	315877	315871	315871	Bradley	517	‘ But , ’
315886	315891	315871	315871	Bradley	517	‘ he may land . ’
315892	315906	315908	315908	Riderhood	360	‘ Easy you ! He wo n’t be lost if he does land , ’
315910	315941	315908	315908	Riderhood	360	‘ He must leave his boat behind him . He ca n’t make a bundle or a parcel on it , and carry it ashore with him under his arm . ’
315942	315951	315953	315953	Bradley	517	‘ He was speaking to you just now , ’
315968	315974	315953	315953	Bradley	517	‘ What did he say ? ’
315975	315978	315980	315980	Riderhood	360	‘ Cheek , ’
315982	315985	315980	315980	Riderhood	360	‘ What ? ’
315986	315989	315991	315991	Riderhood	360	‘ Cheek , ’
315998	316016	315991	315991	Riderhood	360	‘ cheek is what he said . He ca n’t say nothing but cheek . I ’d ha ’
316038	316061	316063	316063	him	6934	’ Bradley turned away his haggard face for a few moments , and then said , tearing up a tuft of grass : ‘
316065	316066	316063	316063	him	6934	’ ‘
316069	316073	316063	316063	him	6934	’ cried Riderhood . ‘

316092	316111	316113	316113	his	6934	’ said Bradley , with an effort at self - repression that forced him to wipe his face , ‘
316120	316121	316113	316113	his	6934	’ ‘
316127	316135	316113	316113	his	6934	’ answered Riderhood , with sullen ferocity , ‘
316147	316148	316150	316150	him	6934	’ ‘
316155	316159	316161	316161	him	6934	’ cried Bradley . ‘
316276	316333	316358	316358	T’otherest	736	’ Riderhood , looking fixedly at him , gradually arose from his recumbent posture while the schoolmaster said these words with the utmost concentration of rage and hatred . So , when the words were all spoken , he too kneeled on one knee on the grass , and the two men looked at one another . ‘
316336	316351	316358	316358	T’otherest	736	’ said Riderhood , very deliberately spitting out the grass he had been chewing . ‘
316369	316370	316371	316371	He	6934	’ ‘
316375	316379	316371	316371	He	6934	’ answered Bradley , ‘

316462	316481	316482	316482	you	0	’ retorted Riderhood , completely ridding himself of his grass , and drawing his sleeve across his mouth , ‘

316504	316527	316539	316539	George	249	’ said Bradley , in a low voice , bending forward to lay his hand upon the Lock - keeper ’s shoulder . ‘

316541	316555	316539	316539	George	249	’ muttered Riderhood , with his eyes on the passion - wasted face . ‘

316572	316580	316582	316582	Bradley	517	‘ And I have never left him , ’
316593	316614	316582	316582	Bradley	517	‘ since they began . And I never will leave him now , till I have seen him with her . ’
316615	316625	316627	316627	Riderhood	360	‘ And when you have seen him with her ? ’
316629	316638	316627	316627	Riderhood	360	‘ — I ’ll come back to you . ’
316736	316744	316746	316746	Bradley	517	‘ I have a pound for you , ’
316748	316753	316755	316755	Riderhood	360	‘ You ’ve two , ’
316827	316835	316837	316838	Bradley Headstone	517	‘ Now , I must follow him , ’
316840	316881	316837	316838	Bradley Headstone	517	‘ He takes this river - road — the fool!—to confuse observation , or divert attention , if not solely to baffle me . But he must have the power of making himself invisible before he can shake Me off . ’
316885	316911	316882	316882	Riderhood	360	‘ If you do n’t get disapinted agin , T’otherest , maybe you ’ll put up at the Lock - house when you come back ? ’
316912	316916	316917	316917	Riderhood	360	‘ I will . ’
317269	317292	317250	317251	the Rogue	11793	‘ Why did he copy my clothes ? He could have looked like what he wanted to look like , without that . ’
317477	317480	317482	317483	the Rogue	11793	‘ Now , ’
317485	317509	317482	317483	the Rogue	11793	‘ if arter he sees me in this neckhankecher , I see him in a sim’lar neckhankecher , it wo n’t be accident ! ’

317893	317904	317891	317891	he	0	‘ I wonder you have no thought of being drowned . ’
317905	317911	317913	317913	Riderhood	360	‘ I ca n’t be ! ’

318055	318062	318064	318064	Riderhood	360	‘ You seem to like it , ’

Bradley ate and drank . As he sat at his platter and mug , Riderhood saw him , again and yet again , steal a look at the neckerchief , as if he were correcting his slow observation and prompting his sluggish memory . ‘
318492	318498	318500	318502	that honest creature	6986	’re ready for your snooze , ’

I saw them’—he stopped as though he were suffocating , and began again—‘I saw them walking side by side , last night . ’
318867	318873	318794	318794	Riderhood	360	‘ What did you do ? ’

319273	319286	319267	319267	Riderhood	360	‘ I asked you wot you wos a - going to do . ’

319373	319380	319315	319315	he	0	‘ Well , perhaps you did . ’
319381	319412	319361	319362	the other	8572	‘ Well ! Anyways I says it again . Sleep where you slept last ; the sounder and longer you can sleep , the better you ’ll know arterwards what you ’re
319416	319781	319361	319362	the other	8572	’ His pointing to the truckle bed in the corner , seemed gradually to bring that poor couch to Bradley ’s wandering remembrance . He slipped off his worn down - trodden shoes , and cast himself heavily , all wet as he was , upon the bed . Riderhood sat down in his wooden arm - chair , and looked through the window at the lightning , and listened to the thunder . But , his thoughts were far from being absorbed by the thunder and the lightning , for again and again and again he looked very curiously at the exhausted man upon the bed . The man had turned up the collar of the rough coat he wore , to shelter himself from the storm , and had buttoned it about his neck . Unconscious of that , and of most things , he had left the coat so , both when he had laved his face in the river , and when he had cast himself upon the bed ; though it would have been much easier to him if he had unloosened it . The thunder rolled heavily , and the forked lightning seemed to make jagged rents in every part of the vast curtain without , as Riderhood sat by the window , glancing at the bed . Sometimes , he saw the man upon the bed , by a red light ; sometimes , by a blue ; sometimes , he scarcely saw him in the darkness of the storm ; sometimes he saw nothing of him in the blinding glare of palpitating white fire . Anon , the rain would come again with a tremendous rush , and the river would seem to rise to meet it , and a blast of wind , bursting upon the door , would flutter the hair and dress of the man , as if invisible messengers were come around the bed to carry him away . From all these phases of the storm , Riderhood would turn , as if they were interruptions — rather striking interruptions possibly , but interruptions still — of his scrutiny of the sleeper . ‘
319786	319792	319782	319782	He	6995	’ he said within himself ; ‘
319830	319839	319868	319868	governor	9945	’ He very cautiously rose to his feet . ‘
319842	319853	319855	319855	you	6996	’ he said , in a low , calm voice , ‘
319878	319882	319871	319871	I	0	’ No answer . ‘
319894	319905	319871	319871	I	0	’ muttered Riderhood in a lower and a different voice ; ‘
319916	320025	320026	320027	Poor man	6999	’ The sleeper moving an arm , he sat down again in his chair , and feigned to watch the storm from the window . It was a grand spectacle , but not so grand as to keep his eyes , for half a minute together , from stealing a look at the man upon the bed . It was at the concealed throat of the sleeper that Riderhood so often looked so curiously , until the sleep seemed to deepen into the stupor of the dead - tired in mind and body . Then , Riderhood came from the window cautiously , and stood by the bed . ‘
320029	320057	320026	320027	Poor man	6999	’ he murmured in a low tone , with a crafty face , and a very watchful eye and ready foot , lest he should start up ; ‘
320102	320342	320343	320343	My	0	’ He touched the first button with a very cautious hand , and a step backward . But , the sleeper remaining in profound unconsciousness , he touched the other buttons with a more assured hand , and perhaps the more lightly on that account . Softly and slowly , he opened the coat and drew it back . The draggling ends of a bright - red neckerchief were then disclosed , and he had even been at the pains of dipping parts of it in some liquid , to give it the appearance of having become stained by wear . With a much - perplexed face , Riderhood looked from it to the sleeper , and from the sleeper to it , and finally crept back to his chair , and there , with his hand to his chin , sat long in a brown study , looking at both . Chapter 2 THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN RISES A LITTLE Mr and Mrs Lammle had come to breakfast with Mr and Mrs Boffin . They were not absolutely uninvited , but had pressed themselves with so much urgency on the golden couple , that evasion of the honour and pleasure of their company would have been difficult , if desired . They were in a charming state of mind , were Mr and Mrs Lammle , and almost as fond of Mr and Mrs Boffin as of one another . ‘
320348	320353	320343	320343	My	0	’ said Mrs Lammle , ‘
320409	320444	320445	320445	My	0	’ This being said aloud , gave Mr Lammle an opportunity , as he came with Mr Boffin from the window to the breakfast table , of taking up his dear and honoured wife . ‘
320448	320453	320454	320454	your	7004	’ said that gentleman , ‘
320464	320465	320454	320454	your	7004	’ ‘
320474	320482	320472	320472	Alfred	437	’ urged the lady , tenderly moved ; ‘

320512	320513	320502	320502	you	7004	’ ‘

320579	320592	320577	320577	Sophronia	625	’ said Mr Lammle , soaring into a tone of moral grandeur , ‘
320635	320636	320632	320632	I	0	’ ‘
320647	320648	320649	320650	My love	972	’ ‘
320658	320659	320664	320664	Lawyer	9322	’ ‘
320666	320673	320676	320677	dear Sophronia	7013	’ said Mrs Lammle , archly . ‘
320740	320741	320742	320742	Alfred	423	’ ‘
320744	320745	320746	320746	They	7015	’ ‘
320818	320964	320968	320969	my husband	1339	’ It struck Mrs Lammle that it appeared rather difficult this morning to bring Mr and Mrs Boffin into agreeable conversation . Here had been several lures thrown out , and neither of them had uttered a word . Here were she , Mrs Lammle , and her husband discoursing at once affectingly and effectively , but discoursing alone . Assuming that the dear old creatures were impressed by what they heard , still one would like to be sure of it , the more so , as at least one of the dear old creatures was somewhat pointedly referred to . If the dear old creatures were too bashful or too dull to assume their required places in the discussion , why then it would seem desirable that the dear old creatures should be taken by their heads and shoulders and brought into it . ‘
320974	320992	320968	320969	my husband	1339	’ asked Mrs Lammle , therefore , with an innocent air , of Mr and Mrs Boffin , ‘
321047	321125	321044	321045	Mrs Boffin	324	’ Still , neither Mr and Mrs Boffin said a word . He sat with his eyes on his plate , eating his muffins and ham , and she sat shyly looking at the teapot . Mrs Lammle ’s innocent appeal was merely thrown into the air , to mingle with the steam of the urn . Glancing towards Mr and Mrs Boffin , she very slightly raised her eyebrows , as though inquiring of her husband : ‘
321133	321170	321044	321045	Mrs Boffin	324	’ Mr Lammle , who had found his chest effective on a variety of occasions , manoeuvred his capacious shirt front into the largest demonstration possible , and then smiling retorted on his wife , thus : ‘
321195	321196	321177	321178	Mrs Boffin	324	’ ‘
321214	321215	321204	321204	you	437	’ ‘
321274	321276	321271	321272	Mrs Boffin	324	’ ( ‘
321285	321294	321282	321283	this Lawyer	7027	’ Mrs Lammle gaily whispered to Mrs Boffin . ‘
321314	321361	321304	321304	he	7027	’ ) Several white dints began to come and go about Mr Lammle ’s nose , as he observed that Mrs Boffin merely looked up from the teapot for a moment with an embarrassed smile , which was no smile , and then looked down again . ‘
321370	321379	321363	321363	you	0	’ inquired Alfred , in a rallying tone . ‘
321385	321393	321382	321382	I	0	’ said Mrs Lammle , still gaily , ‘
321416	321421	321413	321414	my Lord	3522	’ To Mr Boffin . ‘
321434	321439	321427	321427	you	0	’ was his answer . ‘
321448	321504	321427	321427	you	0	’ Both husband and wife glanced at him , very doubtfully . His manner was grave , but not coarse , and derived some dignity from a certain repressed dislike of the tone of the conversation . Again Mrs Lammle raised her eyebrows for instruction from her husband . He replied in a slight nod , ‘
321506	321509	321532	321533	Mrs Lammle	423	’em again . ’
321510	321528	321532	321533	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ To protect myself against the suspicion of covert self - laudation , my dear Mrs Boffin , ’
321536	321545	321532	321533	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ I must tell you how it was . ’
321546	321553	321554	321555	Mr Boffin	324	‘ No . Pray do n’t , ’
321565	321570	321558	321559	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ The Court objects ? ’
321571	321574	321576	321577	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Ma’am , ’
321579	321631	321576	321577	Mr Boffin	324	‘ the Court ( if I am the Court ) does object . The Court objects for two reasons . First , because the Court do n’t think it fair . Secondly , because the dear old lady , Mrs Court ( if I am Mr ) gets distressed by it . ’
321666	321675	321663	321663	she	423	‘ What does the Court not consider fair ? ’
321676	321682	321684	321685	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Letting you go on , ’
321717	321770	321771	321772	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ It ’s not above - board and it ’s not fair . When the old lady is uncomfortable , there ’s sure to be good reason for it . I see she is uncomfortable , and I plainly see this is the good reason wherefore . HAVE you breakfasted , ma’am . ’
321799	321806	321808	321809	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Have YOU breakfasted , sir ? ’
321811	321815	321817	321817	Alfred	423	‘ Thank you , ’
321824	321840	321841	321841	He	324	‘ If Mrs Boffin will oblige me , I ’ll take another cup of tea . ’
321903	321908	321909	321909	he	324	‘ A thousand thanks , ’
321913	321918	321909	321909	he	324	‘ I have breakfasted . ’
321919	321924	321926	321927	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Now , which , ’
321937	321945	321926	321927	Mr Boffin	324	‘ which of you two is Cashier ? ’
321946	321952	321958	321958	he	8651	‘ Sophronia , my dear , ’
321990	321997	321973	321973	he	8651	‘ it shall be your department . ’
321998	322003	322005	322006	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I would rather , ’
322008	322147	322005	322006	Mr Boffin	324	‘ that it was your husband ’s , ma’am , because — but never mind , because , I would rather have to do with him . However , what I have to say , I will say with as little offence as possible ; if I can say it without any , I shall be heartily glad . You two have done me a service , a very great service , in doing what you did ( my old lady knows what it was ) , and I have put into this envelope a bank note for a hundred pound . I consider the service well worth a hundred pound , and I am well pleased to pay the money . Would you do me the favour to take it , and likewise to accept my thanks ? ’
322232	322238	322240	322241	Mr Boffin	324	‘ It is not impossible , ’
322246	322266	322240	322241	Mr Boffin	324	‘ that you have had some general idea , sir , of replacing Rokesmith , in course of time ? ’
322267	322272	322274	322274	Alfred	437	‘ It is not , ’
322287	322291	322274	322274	Alfred	437	‘ not impossible . ’
322292	322298	322300	322301	Mr Boffin	324	‘ And perhaps , ma’am , ’
322306	322368	322300	322301	Mr Boffin	324	‘ you have been so kind as to take up my old lady in your own mind , and to do her the honour of turning the question over whether you might n’t one of these days have her in charge , like ? Whether you might n’t be a sort of Miss Bella Wilfer to her , and something more ? ’
322369	322374	322376	322377	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ I should hope , ’
322389	322419	322376	322377	Mrs Lammle	423	‘ that if I were anything to your wife , sir , I could hardly fail to be something more than Miss Bella Wilfer , as you call her . ’
322420	322429	322431	322432	Mr Boffin	324	‘ What do YOU call her , ma’am ? ’
322450	322468	322470	322471	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Again I think I may say , that ’s not impossible . Is it , sir ? ’
322477	322482	322484	322484	Alfred	423	‘ It is not , ’
322491	322495	322484	322484	Alfred	423	‘ not impossible . ’
322496	322499	322501	322502	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Now , ’
322506	322535	322501	322502	Mr Boffin	324	‘ it wo n’t do . I do n’t wish to say a single word that might be afterwards remembered as unpleasant ; but it wo n’t do . ’
322536	322542	322543	322544	her husband	8651	‘ Sophronia , my love , ’
322551	322560	322543	322544	her husband	8651	‘ you hear ? It wo n’t do . ’
322561	322564	322566	322567	Mr Boffin	324	‘ No , ’
322575	322613	322566	322567	Mr Boffin	324	‘ it really wo n’t . You positively must excuse us . If you ’ll go your way , we ’ll go ours , and so I hope this affair ends to the satisfaction of all parties . ’
322635	322646	322648	322649	Mr Boffin	324	‘ The best thing we can make of the affair , ’
322651	322699	322648	322649	Mr Boffin	324	‘ is a matter of business , and as a matter of business it ’s brought to a conclusion . You have done me a great service , a very great service , and I have paid for it . Is there any objection to the price ? ’
322732	322736	322738	322739	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Very good , ’
322741	322836	322738	322739	Mr Boffin	324	‘ We hope ( my old lady and me ) that you ’ll give us credit for taking the plainest and honestest short - cut that could be taken under the circumstances . We have talked it over with a deal of care ( my old lady and me ) , and we have felt that at all to lead you on , or even at all to let you go on of your own selves , would n’t be the right thing . So , I have openly given you to understand that — ’
322864	322906	322908	322909	Mr Boffin	324	‘ — that it wo n’t do . If I could have put the case more pleasantly I would ; but I hope I have n’t put it very unpleasantly ; at all events I have n’t meant to . So , ’
322916	322939	322908	322909	Mr Boffin	324	‘ wishing you well in the way you go , we now conclude with the observation that perhaps you ’ll go it . ’

323012	323141	323005	323005	she	441	‘ to think that you and Alfred should be ruined ! Oh , my poor dear Sophronia , to think that you should have had a Sale at your house after all your kindness to me ! Oh , Mr and Mrs Boffin , pray forgive me for this intrusion , but you do n’t know how fond I was of Sophronia when Pa would n’t let me go there any more , or what I have felt for Sophronia since I heard from Ma of her having been brought low in the world . You do n’t , you ca n’t , you never can , think , how I have lain awake at night and cried for my good Sophronia , my first and only friend ! ’
323211	323218	323220	323222	poor little Georgiana	441	‘ I have n’t a minute , ’
323224	323351	323220	323222	poor little Georgiana	441	‘ to stay . I am out shopping early with Ma , and I said I had a headache and got Ma to leave me outside in the phaeton , in Piccadilly , and ran round to Sackville Street , and heard that Sophronia was here , and then Ma came to see , oh such a dreadful old stony woman from the country in a turban in Portland Place , and I said I would n’t go up with Ma but would drive round and leave cards for the Boffins , which is taking a liberty with the name ; but oh my goodness I am distracted , and the phaeton ’s at the door , and what would Pa say if he knew it ! ’
323352	323362	323364	323365	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Do n’t ye be timid , my dear , ’
323367	323375	323364	323365	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ You came in to see us . ’
323376	323385	323387	323387	Georgiana	441	‘ Oh , no , I did n’t , ’
323389	323443	323387	323387	Georgiana	441	‘ It ’s very impolite , I know , but I came to see my poor Sophronia , my only friend . Oh ! how I felt the separation , my dear Sophronia , before I knew you were brought low in the world , and how much more I feel it now ! ’
323472	323480	323482	323482	Georgiana	441	‘ But I ’ve come on business , ’
323498	323606	323482	323482	Georgiana	441	‘ and if I do n’t despatch it I shall have come for nothing , and oh good gracious ! what would Pa say if he knew of Sackville Street , and what would Ma say if she was kept waiting on the doorsteps of that dreadful turban , and there never were such pawing horses as ours unsettling my mind every moment more and more when I want more mind than I have got , by pawing up Mr Boffin ’s street where they have no business to be . Oh ! where is , where is it ? Oh ! I ca n’t find it ! ’
323619	323628	323630	323631	Mr Boffin	324	‘ What do you miss , my dear ? ’
323636	323644	323646	323646	Georgiana	441	‘ Oh ! it ’s little enough , ’
323648	323739	323646	323646	Georgiana	441	‘ because Ma always treats me as if I was in the nursery ( I am sure I wish I was ! ) , but I hardly ever spend it and it has mounted up to fifteen pounds , Sophronia , and I hope three five - pound notes are better than nothing , though so little , so little ! And now I have found that — oh , my goodness ! there ’s the other gone next ! Oh no , it is n’t , here it is ! ’
323756	323767	323769	323769	Georgiana	441	‘ Ma says chits and jewels have no business together , ’
323771	323824	323769	323769	Georgiana	441	‘ and that ’s the reason why I have no trinkets except this , but I suppose my aunt Hawkinson was of a different opinion , because she left me this , though I used to think she might just as well have buried it , for it ’s always kept in jewellers ’
323860	323861	323846	323846	you	441	’ ‘
323867	323876	323846	323846	you	441	’ said Mr Boffin , gently taking it . ‘

324297	324392	324289	324289	somebody	1744	’ Mr Boffin took her down , and saw her driven away , with her poor little red eyes and weak chin peering over the great apron of the custard - coloured phaeton , as if she had been ordered to expiate some childish misdemeanour by going to bed in the daylight , and were peeping over the counterpane in a miserable flutter of repentance and low spirits . Returning to the breakfast - room , he found Mrs Lammle still standing on her side of the table , and Mr Lammle on his . ‘
324398	324410	324289	324289	somebody	1744	’ said Mr Boffin , showing the money and the necklace , ‘
324418	324458	324459	324459	You	0	’ Mrs Lammle had taken up her parasol from a side table , and stood sketching with it on the pattern of the damask cloth , as she had sketched on the pattern of Mr Twemlow ’s papered wall . ‘
324470	324485	324467	324468	Mr Boffin	324	’ she said , turning her head towards him , but not her eyes . ‘
324488	324493	324467	324468	Mr Boffin	324	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
324507	324526	324494	324494	I	0	’ Mrs Lammle explained , in a measured voice , and with an emphasis on her last word . ‘
324529	324533	324494	324494	I	0	’ he returned . ‘
324578	324579	324576	324576	herself	7062	’ ‘
324585	324602	324576	324576	herself	7062	’ said Mrs Lammle , still sketching , and seeming to bestow great pains upon it , ‘
324641	324642	324635	324635	you	324	’ ‘
324649	324660	324635	324635	you	324	’ said Mrs Boffin , in her ready good nature . ‘
324666	324667	324668	324668	Sophronia	625	’ ‘
324670	324677	324668	324668	Sophronia	625	’ asked her husband , mockingly , ‘
324682	324683	324679	324679	you	625	’ ‘
324692	324697	324688	324690	my good sir	11276	’ Mr Boffin interposed , ‘
324741	324742	324727	324728	Mrs Lammle	423	’ ‘
324755	324776	324747	324747	I	0	’ She stood sketching on the table - cloth , with her face clouded and set , and was silent . ‘
324779	324783	324784	324784	I	0	’ said Alfred , ‘
324835	324836	324808	324808	Georgiana	441	’ ‘
324842	324944	324838	324838	you	324	’ was Mr Boffin ’s comment , as he put it in his pocket . Alfred followed it with his looks , and also greedily pursued the notes until they vanished into Mr Boffin ’s waistcoat pocket . Then he directed a look , half exasperated and half jeering , at his wife . She still stood sketching ; but , as she sketched , there was a struggle within her , which found expression in the depth of the few last lines the parasol point indented into the table - cloth , and then some tears fell from her eyes . ‘
324951	324955	324948	324949	the woman	9386	’ exclaimed Lammle , ‘
324962	324987	324956	324956	she	9386	’ She walked to the window , flinching under his angry stare , looked out for a moment , and turned round quite coldly . ‘
325031	325032	325033	325033	You	324	’ ‘
325043	325044	325038	325038	you	324	’ ‘
325089	325090	325084	325084	you	324	’ ‘
325104	325105	325100	325100	you	324	’ ‘
325121	325397	325398	325398	You	7076	’ She passed out and he followed her . Mr and Mrs Boffin had the curiosity softly to raise a window and look after them as they went down the long street . They walked arm - in - arm , showily enough , but without appearing to interchange a syllable . It might have been fanciful to suppose that under their outer bearing there was something of the shamed air of two cheats who were linked together by concealed handcuffs ; but , not so , to suppose that they were haggardly weary of one another , of themselves , and of all this world . In turning the street corner they might have turned out of this world , for anything Mr and Mrs Boffin ever saw of them to the contrary ; for , they set eyes on the Lammles never more . Chapter 3 THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN SINKS AGAIN The evening of that day being one of the reading evenings at the Bower , Mr Boffin kissed Mrs Boffin after a five o’clock dinner , and trotted out , nursing his big stick in both arms , so that , as of old , it seemed to be whispering in his ear . He carried so very attentive an expression on his countenance that it appeared as if the confidential discourse of the big stick required to be followed closely . Mr Boffin ’s face was like the face of a thoughtful listener to an intricate communication , and , in trotting along , he occasionally glanced at that companion with the look of a man who was interposing the remark : ‘
325404	325459	325398	325398	You	7076	’ Mr Boffin and his stick went on alone together , until they arrived at certain cross - ways where they would be likely to fall in with any one coming , at about the same time , from Clerkenwell to the Bower . Here they stopped , and Mr Boffin consulted his watch . ‘
325472	325476	325477	325477	I	0	’ said he . ‘
325478	325482	325477	325477	I	0	’m rather early . ’
325533	325538	325540	325541	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Thank’ee , Venus , ’
325543	325550	325540	325541	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Thank’ee , thank’ee , thank’ee ! ’
325578	325639	325572	325572	he	324	‘ All right , Venus , all right . Now , that you ’ve been to see me , and have consented to keep up the appearance before Wegg of remaining in it for a time , I have got a sort of a backer . All right , Venus . Thank’ee , Venus . Thank’ee , thank’ee , thank’ee ! ’
325660	325678	325680	325681	Mr Boffin	714	‘ Do you think Wegg is likely to drop down upon me to - night , Venus ? ’
325690	325698	325680	325681	Mr Boffin	714	‘ I think he is , sir . ’
325699	325711	325572	325572	he	324	‘ Have you any particular reason for thinking so , Venus ? ’
325712	325717	325680	325681	Mr Boffin	714	‘ Well , sir , ’
325722	325780	325782	325783	Mr Venus	379	‘ the fact is , he has given me another look - in , to make sure of what he calls our stock - in - trade being correct , and he has mentioned his intention that he was not to be put off beginning with you the very next time you should come . And this , ’
325787	325799	325782	325783	Mr Venus	379	‘ being the very next time , you know , sir — ’
325801	325819	325821	325822	Mr Boffin	714	‘ Why , therefore you suppose he ’ll turn to at the grindstone , eh , Wegg ? ’
325824	325830	325821	325822	Mr Boffin	714	‘ Just so , sir . ’
325859	325918	325919	325920	Mr Venus	379	‘ He ’s a terrible fellow , Venus ; he ’s an awful fellow . I do n’t know how ever I shall go through with it . You must stand by me , Venus like a good man and true . You ’ll do all you can to stand by me , Venus ; wo n’t you ? ’
325979	325985	325986	325986	he	714	‘ Mr Boffin , sir ? ’
325989	325991	325986	325986	he	714	‘ You ’re

326016	326027	326011	326011	you	714	’ returned the literary gentleman , with a threatening sneer . ‘
326046	326047	326030	326030	I	0	’ ‘
326056	326057	326048	326048	You	714	’ ‘

326116	326122	326106	326106	Wegg	714	’ was the ironical answer . ‘
326139	326140	326137	326137	sir	8755	’ ‘
326207	326265	326195	326195	you	8755	’ An unholy glare of contradiction and offence shone in the eyes of Mr Wegg , as he turned the key on his patron , after ushering him into the yard with this vocal quotation . Mr Boffin ’s air was crestfallen and submissive . Whispered Wegg to Venus , as they crossed the yard behind him : ‘
326281	326287	326273	326273	he	5542	’ Whispered Venus to Wegg : ‘
326304	326350	326296	326296	I	0	’ Mr Boffin , entering the usual chamber , laid his stick upon the settle usually reserved for him , thrust his hands into his pockets , and , with his shoulders raised and his hat drooping back upon them , looking disconsolately at Wegg . ‘
326364	326374	326356	326357	Mr Venus	379	’ remarked that man of might , addressing him , ‘
326402	326436	326441	326441	I	0	’ Mr Boffin shook it off with one shake , so that it dropped on the floor behind him , and remained in his former attitude with his former rueful look upon him . ‘
326442	326454	326456	326456	Wegg	714	’m a - going to call you Boffin , for short , ’
326458	326475	326456	326456	Wegg	714	‘ If you do n’t like it , it ’s open to you to lump it . ’
326476	326485	326486	326487	Mr Boffin	714	‘ I do n’t mind it , Wegg , ’
326490	326509	326486	326487	Mr Boffin	714	‘ That ’s lucky for you , Boffin . Now , do you want to be read to ? ’
326510	326524	326456	326456	Wegg	714	‘ I do n’t particularly care about it to - night , Wegg . ’
326525	326533	326535	326536	Mr Wegg	714	‘ Because if you did want to , ’
326552	326567	326546	326546	his	714	‘ you would n’t be . I ’ve been your slave long enough . I ’m

326610	326619	326608	326608	Wegg	714	’ returned Mr Boffin , with folded hands , ‘
326626	326627	326628	326628	I	0	’ ‘
326634	326638	326628	326628	I	0	’ Wegg retorted . ‘
326669	326670	326671	326671	He	7099	’ ‘
326685	326690	326691	326691	Boffin	714	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘
326693	326697	326691	326691	Boffin	714	’ retorted Wegg , ‘
326709	326786	326698	326698	I	0	’ Here Mr Venus interposed , and remarked that he conceived Mr Boffin to have taken the description literally ; the rather , forasmuch as he , Mr Venus , had himself supposed the menial to have contracted an affliction or a habit of the nose , involving a serious drawback on the pleasures of social intercourse , until he had discovered that Mr Wegg ’s description of him was to be accepted as merely figurative . ‘
326793	326797	326798	326798	he	7099	’ said Wegg , ‘
326844	326883	326884	326884	I	0	’ The unsuspecting Sloppy was at that moment airing his many buttons within view of the window . Mr Boffin , after a short interval of impassive discomfiture , opened the window and beckoned him to come in . ‘
326889	326918	326884	326884	I	0	’ said Wegg , with one arm a - kimbo and his head on one side , like a bullying counsel pausing for an answer from a witness , ‘
326929	326947	326948	326948	Sloppy	496	’ In humble obedience , when the button - gleaming Sloppy entered Mr Boffin said to him : ‘
326974	326975	326960	326960	He	714	’ ‘
326979	326985	326960	326960	He	714	’ Mr Wegg severely stipulated . ‘
326989	327038	327039	327040	The atomspear	7107	’ said Mr Boffin . Sloppy stared , with both his eyes and all his buttons , and his mouth wide open ; but was without loss of time escorted forth by Silas Wegg , pushed out at the yard gate by the shoulders , and locked out . ‘
327042	327061	327039	327040	The atomspear	7107	’ said Wegg , stumping back into the room again , a little reddened by his late exertion , ‘
327087	327124	327080	327080	Boffin	714	’ Mr Boffin , still with his hands ruefully stuck in his pockets , sat on the edge of the settle , shrunk into a small compass , and eyed the potent Silas with conciliatory looks . ‘
327128	327137	327138	327139	this gentleman	8826	’ said Silas Wegg , pointing out Venus , ‘
327184	327185	327169	327169	he	8826	’ ‘
327194	327205	327186	327186	I	0	’ Mr Boffin was beginning , when Silas stopped him . ‘
327215	327235	327186	327186	I	0	’re called upon to answer . You ’ll find you ’ve got quite enough to do . Now , you ’re
327243	327263	327272	327273	Mr Boffin	714	’re in possession of property to which you ’ve no right at all ? Are you aware of that ? ’
327264	327270	327272	327273	Mr Boffin	714	‘ Venus tells me so , ’
327285	327291	327293	327293	Silas	319	‘ I tell you so , ’
327295	327360	327293	327293	Silas	319	‘ Now , here ’s my hat , Boffin , and here ’s my walking - stick . Trifle with me , and instead of making a bargain with you , I ’ll put on my hat and take up my walking - stick , and go out , and make a bargain with the rightful owner . Now , what do you say ? ’
327361	327365	327367	327368	Mr Boffin	714	‘ I say , ’
327383	327404	327377	327377	his	714	‘ that I am sure I do n’t want to trifle , Wegg . I have said so to Venus . ’
327405	327412	327414	327414	Venus	379	‘ You certainly have , sir , ’
327416	327418	327414	327414	Venus	379	‘ You ’re
327431	327444	327427	327427	you	714	’ remonstrated Silas , with a disapproving shake of his wooden head . ‘

327529	327545	327501	327501	I	0	’ Mr Wegg again planted his arm , and put his head on one side . ‘

327553	327559	327560	327560	I	0	’ said the inexorable Wegg : ‘

327583	327589	327566	327566	I	0	’ cried that unfortunate gentleman . ‘

327622	327632	327616	327616	you	714	’ said Silas , poking his head at him . ‘
327686	327694	327696	327696	me	0	’ For he had paused a moment . ‘
327698	327705	327696	327696	me	0	’ cried that unfortunate gentleman again , ‘
327714	327735	327696	327696	me	0	’m almost off my head . You hurry me so . Be so good as name the terms , Wegg . ’
327736	327743	327745	327745	Silas	319	‘ Now , mark , Boffin , ’
327747	327749	327745	327745	Silas	319	‘ Mark ’em
327754	327807	327808	327809	Mr Venus	379	’re the lowest terms and the only terms . You ’ll throw your Mound ( the little Mound as comes to you any way ) into the general estate , and then you ’ll divide the whole property into three parts , and you ’ll keep one and hand over the others . ’
327836	327845	327846	327846	Wegg	714	‘ Now , wait a bit , Boffin , ’
327849	327891	327846	327846	Wegg	714	‘ there ’s something more . You ’ve been a squandering this property — laying some of it out on yourself . _ That _ wo n’t do . You ’ve bought a house . You ’ll be charged for it . ’
327892	327900	327901	327902	Mr Boffin	714	‘ I shall be ruined , Wegg ! ’
327906	327932	327901	327902	Mr Boffin	714	‘ Now , wait a bit , Boffin ; there ’s something more . You ’ll leave me in sole custody of these Mounds till they ’re

328013	328014	327901	327902	Mr Boffin	714	’ ‘
328028	328041	327901	327902	Mr Boffin	714	’ cried the Golden Dustman , with his hands to his head . ‘
328100	328101	328106	328106	Wegg	714	’ ‘
328108	328113	328114	328114	I	0	’ protested Mr Boffin . ‘
328120	328121	328118	328118	myself	0	’ ‘
328129	328133	328127	328127	Boffin	714	’ inquired Silas . ‘
328161	328162	328165	328166	Mr Venus	379	’ ‘
328168	328183	328165	328166	Mr Venus	379	’ said Wegg , turning to his partner with a knowing and superior air , ‘
328225	328233	328212	328212	We	319	’ Mr Boffin drew a deep groan . ‘
328282	328283	328277	328277	He	7121	’ ‘
328289	328315	328320	328320	he	7121	’ said Mr Boffin , speaking in a muffled voice , with his hands before his face , as he rocked himself on the settle . ‘
328322	328328	328320	328320	he	7121	’ returned Wegg , surprised . ‘
328344	328412	328335	328335	I	0	’ The unlucky gentleman continuing to rock himself to and fro , and to utter an occasional moan , Mr Venus besought him to bear up against his reverses , and to take time to accustom himself to the thought of his new position . But , his taking time was exactly the thing of all others that Silas Wegg could not be induced to hear of . ‘
328422	328607	328608	328608	I	0	’ was the motto which that obdurate person many times repeated ; shaking his fist at Mr Boffin , and pegging his motto into the floor with his wooden leg , in a threatening and alarming manner . At length , Mr Boffin entreated to be allowed a quarter of an hour ’s grace , and a cooling walk of that duration in the yard . With some difficulty Mr Wegg granted this great favour , but only on condition that he accompanied Mr Boffin in his walk , as not knowing what he might fraudulently unearth if he were left to himself . A more absurd sight than Mr Boffin in his mental irritation trotting very nimbly , and Mr Wegg hopping after him with great exertion , eager to watch the slightest turn of an eyelash , lest it should indicate a spot rich with some secret , assuredly had never been seen in the shadow of the Mounds . Mr Wegg was much distressed when the quarter of an hour expired , and came hopping in , a very bad second . ‘
328614	328643	328608	328608	I	0	’ cried Mr Boffin , flouncing on the settle in a forlorn manner , with his hands deep in his pockets , as if his pockets had sunk . ‘
328679	328955	328956	328956	I	0	’ Wegg , who was all for clinching the nail he had so strongly driven home , announced that Boffin should see it without an hour ’s delay . Taking him into custody for that purpose , or overshadowing him as if he really were his Evil Genius in visible form , Mr Wegg clapped Mr Boffin ’s hat upon the back of his head , and walked him out by the arm , asserting a proprietorship over his soul and body that was at once more grim and more ridiculous than anything in Mr Venus ’s rare collection . That light - haired gentleman followed close upon their heels , at least backing up Mr Boffin in a literal sense , if he had not had recent opportunities of doing so spiritually ; while Mr Boffin , trotting on as hard as he could trot , involved Silas Wegg in frequent collisions with the public , much as a pre - occupied blind man ’s dog may be seen to involve his master . Thus they reached Mr Venus ’s establishment , somewhat heated by the nature of their progress thither . Mr Wegg , especially , was in a flaming glow , and stood in the little shop , panting and mopping his head with his pocket - handkerchief , speechless for several minutes . Meanwhile , Mr Venus , who had left the duelling frogs to fight it out in his absence by candlelight for the public delectation , put the shutters up . When all was snug , and the shop - door fastened , he said to the perspiring Silas : ‘
328969	328970	328959	328960	Mr Wegg	319	’ ‘
328978	328984	328959	328960	Mr Wegg	319	’ replied that discreet character ; ‘
329018	329027	328991	328991	you	8755	’ Mr Venus did as he was asked . ‘
329031	329038	328991	328991	you	8755	’ said Silas , looking about : ‘
329061	329068	329045	329045	you	8755	’ Venus handed him the chair . ‘
329073	329077	329087	329087	you	714	’ said Wegg , ‘
329089	329133	329087	329087	you	714	’ Mr Boffin , as if he were about to have his portrait painted , or to be electrified , or to be made a Freemason , or to be placed at any other solitary disadvantage , ascended the rostrum prepared for him . ‘
329139	329148	329136	329137	Mr Venus	379	’ said Silas , taking off his coat , ‘
329211	329280	329205	329205	he	3317	’ Mr Boffin seemed rather inclined to object to these precautionary arrangements , but , being immediately embraced by Wegg , resigned himself . Venus then produced the document , and Mr Boffin slowly spelt it out aloud : so very slowly , that Wegg , who was holding him in the chair with the grip of a wrestler , became again exceedingly the worse for his exertions . ‘
329293	329299	329290	329291	Mr Venus	379	’ he uttered with difficulty , ‘
329308	329367	329205	329205	he	3317	’ At length the document was restored to its place ; and Wegg , whose uncomfortable attitude had been that of a very persevering man unsuccessfully attempting to stand upon his head , took a seat to recover himself . Mr Boffin , for his part , made no attempt to come down , but remained aloft disconsolate . ‘
329372	329387	329370	329370	Boffin	714	’ said Wegg , as soon as he was in a condition to speak . ‘
329393	329394	329397	329397	Wegg	714	’ ‘
329399	329406	329397	329397	Wegg	714	’ said Mr Boffin , meekly . ‘
329412	329413	329409	329409	I	0	’ ‘
329423	329424	329427	329427	Wegg	714	’ ‘
329435	329443	329431	329431	Wegg	714	’ was the slow and sad reply . ‘
329451	329455	329431	329431	Wegg	714	’ said Wegg , ‘
329489	329509	329510	329511	Mr Venus	379	’ ouse , I think I ’d take the friendly liberty of asking you for a specimen of it . ’
329530	329539	329540	329541	that gentleman	1468	‘ Will you mix it , Mr Wegg ? ’
329545	329572	329540	329541	that gentleman	1468	‘ I think not , sir . On so auspicious an occasion , I prefer to take it in the form of a Gum - Tickler . ’
329618	329623	329595	329595	Wegg	714	‘ Bof — fin ! ’
329624	329629	329630	329630	he	714	‘ Yes , Wegg , ’
329645	329679	329630	329630	he	714	‘ I have n’t mentioned one thing , because it ’s a detail that comes of course . You must be followed up , you know . You must be kept under inspection . ’
329680	329687	329689	329690	Mr Boffin	714	‘ I do n’t quite understand , ’
329692	329697	329699	329699	Wegg	714	‘ Do n’t you ? ’
329701	329720	329699	329699	Wegg	714	‘ Where ’s your wits , Boffin ? Till the Mounds is down and this business completed , you ’re
329753	329754	329755	329755	I	0	’ ‘
329762	329773	329755	329755	I	0	’ said Mr Boffin , in a tone of despondency , ‘
329785	329786	329775	329775	I	0	’ ‘
329796	329817	329793	329793	d’ye	7133	’ inquired Wegg , helping himself to a third Gum - Tickler — for he had already taken a second . ‘
329856	329857	329829	329829	she	1988	’ ‘
329863	329880	329858	329858	I	0	’ returned Wegg , shaking his head sagaciously , and bestowing a wooden wink upon him , ‘
329920	329921	329915	329915	I	0	’ ‘
329929	329937	329940	329940	you	714	’ Mr Boffin feelingly represented to him : ‘
329962	329963	329964	329964	I	0	’ ‘
329972	329976	329964	329964	I	0	’ blustered Wegg . ‘
329991	329992	329989	329989	you	714	’ ‘
329998	330004	330005	330007	my old lady	1988	’ Mr Boffin gently represented ; ‘
330013	330014	330005	330007	my old lady	1988	’ ‘
330021	330025	330028	330028	herself	7140	’ returned Wegg , ‘
330037	330066	330067	330067	I	0	’ Mr Boffin seemed a little less patient at this point than at any other of the negotiations . But he commanded himself , and said tamely enough : ‘
330080	330081	330078	330078	Wegg	714	’ ‘
330084	330101	330105	330107	your old lady	7140	’ said Wegg , contemptuously , though , perhaps , perceiving some hint of danger otherwise , ‘
330128	330150	330127	330127	I	0	’m as good a man as you , and better . Ask me to dinner . Give me the run of your ’
330196	330197	330189	330190	Uncle Parker	323	’ ‘
330205	330209	330200	330201	Mr Wegg	714	’ Venus urged . ‘
330220	330242	330215	330215	you	714	’ he returned , with some little thickness of speech , in consequence of the Gum - Ticklers having tickled it . ‘
330287	330384	330279	330279	Boffin	714	’ Mr Boffin descended with an air of resignation , and gave himself up , after taking friendly leave of Mr Venus . Once more , Inspector and Inspected went through the streets together , and so arrived at Mr Boffin ’s door . But even there , when Mr Boffin had given his keeper good - night , and had let himself in with his key , and had softly closed the door , even there and then , the all - powerful Silas must needs claim another assertion of his newly - asserted power . ‘
330389	330396	330399	330399	Wegg	319	’ he called through the keyhole . ‘
330401	330410	330399	330399	Wegg	319	’ was the reply through the same channel . ‘
330426	330447	330489	330489	Wegg	319	’ Mr Boffin — ah , how fallen from the high estate of his honest simplicity!—opened the door and obeyed . ‘
330458	330480	330451	330451	You	714	’ said Wegg , with a grin . The door was hardly closed , when he again called through the keyhole : ‘
330485	330486	330489	330489	Wegg	319	’ ‘
330491	330640	330489	330489	Wegg	319	’ This time Silas made no reply , but laboured with a will at turning an imaginary grindstone outside the keyhole , while Mr Boffin stooped at it within ; he then laughed silently , and stumped home . Chapter 4 A RUNAWAY MATCH Cherubic Pa arose with as little noise as possible from beside majestic Ma , one morning early , having a holiday before him . Pa and the lovely woman had a rather particular appointment to keep . Yet Pa and the lovely woman were not going out together . Bella was up before four , but had no bonnet on . She was waiting at the foot of the stairs — was sitting on the bottom stair , in fact — to receive Pa when he came down , but her only object seemed to be to get Pa well out of the house . ‘
330648	330659	330489	330489	Wegg	319	’ whispered Bella , after greeting him with a hug , ‘
330688	330689	330683	330683	you	319	’ ‘
330722	330780	330783	330783	YOU	919	’ Bella tucked her arm in his with a merry noiseless laugh , and they went down to the kitchen on tiptoe ; she stopping on every separate stair to put the tip of her forefinger on her rosy lips , and then lay it on his lips , according to her favourite petting way of kissing Pa. ‘
330789	330801	330783	330783	YOU	919	’ asked R. W. , as she gave him his breakfast . ‘
330829	330830	330818	330821	the fair little man	7154	’ ‘
330839	330870	330818	330821	the fair little man	7154	’ said her father . Bella put another of those finger - seals upon his lips , and then said , kneeling down by him as he sat at table : ‘
330914	330915	330898	330898	I	0	’ ‘
330944	330953	330898	330898	I	0	’ with his caressing hand upon her hair . ‘
330960	330968	330898	330898	I	0	’ returned Bella , pretending to pout . ‘
331065	331071	331056	331056	I	0	’ said Bella , nodding . ‘
331136	331176	331121	331121	you	8755	’ As Pa bent his head , she cried over him a little , and then said ( after having stopped to dry her eyes on his white waistcoat , the discovery of which incongruous circumstance made her laugh ): ‘
331202	331203	331195	331195	you	8755	’ ‘
331208	331211	331206	331206	Bella	307	’ repeated Pa. ‘
331219	331220	331221	331221	I	0	’ ‘
331231	331234	331221	331221	I	0	’ said Pa. ‘
331271	331272	331273	331273	I	0	’ ‘
331278	331281	331275	331276	the darling	7166	’ said Pa. ‘
331293	331294	331295	331295	You	307	’ ‘
331299	331302	331295	331295	You	307	’ repeated Pa. ‘
331306	331307	331295	331295	You	307	’ ‘
331313	331316	331309	331309	you	307	’ said Pa. ‘
331360	331383	331384	331385	Dear Pa	580	’ Here , she quite forgot that it was Pa ’s turn to make the responses , and clung to his neck . ‘
331455	331456	331432	331432	I	0	’ ‘
331497	331498	331500	331500	I	0	’ ‘
331509	331527	331500	331500	I	0	’ asked Bella , laughing ( notwithstanding her repentance ) , with fantastic pleasure in the picture , ‘
331536	331537	331529	331529	I	0	’ ‘
331550	331551	331555	331555	I	0	’ ‘
331575	331579	331568	331568	I	0	’ said Bella . ‘
331588	331589	331586	331586	Pa	580	’ ‘
331605	331606	331603	331603	I	0	’ ‘
331611	331615	331603	331603	I	0	’ cried Bella . ‘
331634	331781	331628	331628	Fly	746	’ So , they went softly up the kitchen stairs on tiptoe , and Bella with her light hand softly removed the fastenings of the house door , and Pa , having received a parting hug , made off . When he had gone a little way , he looked back . Upon which , Bella set another of those finger seals upon the air , and thrust out her little foot expressive of the mark . Pa , in appropriate action , expressed fidelity to the mark , and made off as fast as he could go . Bella walked thoughtfully in the garden for an hour and more , and then , returning to the bedroom where Lavvy the Irrepressible still slumbered , put on a little bonnet of quiet , but on the whole of sly appearance , which she had yesterday made . ‘
331791	332157	331789	331789	Lavvy	728	’ she said , as she stooped down and kissed her . The Irrepressible , with a bounce in the bed , and a remark that it was n’t time to get up yet , relapsed into unconsciousness , if she had come out of it . Behold Bella tripping along the streets , the dearest girl afoot under the summer sun ! Behold Pa waiting for Bella behind a pump , at least three miles from the parental roof - tree . Behold Bella and Pa aboard an early steamboat for Greenwich . Were they expected at Greenwich ? Probably . At least , Mr John Rokesmith was on the pier looking out , about a couple of hours before the coaly ( but to him gold - dusty ) little steamboat got her steam up in London . Probably . At least , Mr John Rokesmith seemed perfectly satisfied when he descried them on board . Probably . At least , Bella no sooner stepped ashore than she took Mr John Rokesmith ’s arm , without evincing surprise , and the two walked away together with an ethereal air of happiness which , as it were , wafted up from the earth and drew after them a gruff and glum old pensioner to see it out . Two wooden legs had this gruff and glum old pensioner , and , a minute before Bella stepped out of the boat , and drew that confiding little arm of hers through Rokesmith ’s , he had had no object in life but tobacco , and not enough of that . Stranded was Gruff and Glum in a harbour of everlasting mud , when all in an instant Bella floated him , and away he went . Say , cherubic parent taking the lead , in what direction do we steer first ? With some such inquiry in his thoughts , Gruff and Glum , stricken by so sudden an interest that he perked his neck and looked over the intervening people , as if he were trying to stand on tiptoe with his two wooden legs , took an observation of R. W. There was no ‘
332159	332513	332514	332514	You	7177	’ in the case , Gruff and Glum made out ; the cherubic parent was bearing down and crowding on direct for Greenwich church , to see his relations . For , Gruff and Glum , though most events acted on him simply as tobacco - stoppers , pressing down and condensing the quids within him , might be imagined to trace a family resemblance between the cherubs in the church architecture , and the cherub in the white waistcoat . Some remembrance of old Valentines , wherein a cherub , less appropriately attired for a proverbially uncertain climate , had been seen conducting lovers to the altar , might have been fancied to inflame the ardour of his timber toes . Be it as it might , he gave his moorings the slip , and followed in chase . The cherub went before , all beaming smiles ; Bella and John Rokesmith followed ; Gruff and Glum stuck to them like wax . For years , the wings of his mind had gone to look after the legs of his body ; but Bella had brought them back for him per steamer , and they were spread again . He was a slow sailer on a wind of happiness , but he took a cross cut for the rendezvous , and pegged away as if he were scoring furiously at cribbage . When the shadow of the church - porch swallowed them up , victorious Gruff and Glum likewise presented himself to be swallowed up . And by this time the cherubic parent was so fearful of surprise , that , but for the two wooden legs on which Gruff and Glum was reassuringly mounted , his conscience might have introduced , in the person of that pensioner , his own stately lady disguised , arrived at Greenwich in a car and griffins , like the spiteful Fairy at the christenings of the Princesses , to do something dreadful to the marriage service . And truly he had a momentary reason to be pale of face , and to whisper to Bella , ‘
332530	332769	332525	332525	you	7177	’ on account of a mysterious rustling and a stealthy movement somewhere in the remote neighbourhood of the organ , though it was gone directly and was heard no more . Albeit it was heard of afterwards , as will afterwards be read in this veracious register of marriage . Who taketh ? I , John , and so do I , Bella . Who giveth ? I , R. W. Forasmuch , Gruff and Glum , as John and Bella have consented together in holy wedlock , you may ( in short ) consider it done , and withdraw your two wooden legs from this temple . To the foregoing purport , the Minister speaking , as directed by the Rubric , to the People , selectly represented in the present instance by G. and G. above mentioned . And now , the church - porch having swallowed up Bella Wilfer for ever and ever , had it not in its power to relinquish that young woman , but slid into the happy sunlight , Mrs John Rokesmith instead . And long on the bright steps stood Gruff and Glum , looking after the pretty bride , with a narcotic consciousness of having dreamed a dream . After which , Bella took out from her pocket a little letter , and read it aloud to Pa and John ; this being a true copy of the same . ‘
332854	332895	332851	332851	P.S.—Rokesmith	754	’ Then , John Rokesmith put the queen ’s countenance on the letter — when had Her Gracious Majesty looked so benign as on that blessed morning!—and then Bella popped it into the post - office , and said merrily , ‘
332912	333118	332899	332899	Pa	580	’ Pa was , at first , in the stirred depths of his conscience , so far from sure of being safe yet , that he made out majestic matrons lurking in ambush among the harmless trees of Greenwich Park , and seemed to see a stately countenance tied up in a well - known pocket - handkerchief glooming down at him from a window of the Observatory , where the Familiars of the Astronomer Royal nightly outwatch the winking stars . But , the minutes passing on and no Mrs Wilfer in the flesh appearing , he became more confident , and so repaired with good heart and appetite to Mr and Mrs John Rokesmith ’s cottage on Blackheath , where breakfast was ready . A modest little cottage but a bright and a fresh , and on the snowy tablecloth the prettiest of little breakfasts . In waiting , too , like an attendant summer breeze , a fluttering young damsel , all pink and ribbons , blushing as if she had been married instead of Bella , and yet asserting the triumph of her sex over both John and Pa , in an exulting and exalted flurry : as who should say , ‘
333139	333190	333191	333191	Pa	580	’ This same young damsel was Bella ’s serving - maid , and unto her did deliver a bunch of keys , commanding treasures in the way of dry - saltery , groceries , jams and pickles , the investigation of which made pastime after breakfast , when Bella declared that ‘
333206	333296	333191	333191	Pa	580	’ and when Pa had all sorts of things poked into his mouth , and did n’t quite know what to do with them when they were put there . Then they , all three , out for a charming ride , and for a charming stroll among heath in bloom , and there behold the identical Gruff and Glum with his wooden legs horizontally disposed before him , apparently sitting meditating on the vicissitudes of life ! To whom said Bella , in her light - hearted surprise : ‘
333313	333449	333450	333450	You	7184	’ To which Gruff and Glum responded that he see her married this morning , my Beauty , and that if it warn’t a liberty he wished her ji and the fairest of fair wind and weather ; further , in a general way requesting to know what cheer ? and scrambling up on his two wooden legs to salute , hat in hand , ship - shape , with the gallantry of a man - of - warsman and a heart of oak . It was a pleasant sight , in the midst of the golden bloom , to see this salt old Gruff and Glum , waving his shovel hat at Bella , while his thin white hair flowed free , as if she had once more launched him into blue water again . ‘
333457	333461	333450	333450	You	7184	’ said Bella , ‘
333478	333484	333470	333470	I	0	’ Answered Gruff and Glum , ‘
333501	333637	333638	333638	I	0	’ So it was done to the general contentment ; and if Gruff and Glum did n’t in the course of the afternoon splice the main brace , it was not for want of the means of inflicting that outrage on the feelings of the Infant Bands of Hope . But , the marriage dinner was the crowning success , for what had bride and bridegroom plotted to do , but to have and to hold that dinner in the very room of the very hotel where Pa and the lovely woman had once dined together ! Bella sat between Pa and John , and divided her attentions pretty equally , but felt it necessary ( in the waiter ’s absence before dinner ) to remind Pa that she was HIS lovely woman no longer . ‘
333648	333653	333638	333638	I	0	’ returned the cherub , ‘
333660	333661	333655	333655	I	0	’ ‘
333672	333673	333666	333666	You	919	’ ‘
333693	333694	333696	333696	you	919	’ ‘
333759	333790	333757	333757	Pa	580	’ Bella put her finger on her own lip , and then on Pa ’s , and then on her own lip again , and then on her husband ’s . ‘
333802	334312	334315	334315	him	7198	’ The appearance of dinner here cut Bella short in one of her disappearances : the more effectually , because it was put on under the auspices of a solemn gentleman in black clothes and a white cravat , who looked much more like a clergyman than THE clergyman , and seemed to have mounted a great deal higher in the church : not to say , scaled the steeple . This dignitary , conferring in secrecy with John Rokesmith on the subject of punch and wines , bent his head as though stooping to the Papistical practice of receiving auricular confession . Likewise , on John ’s offering a suggestion which did n’t meet his views , his face became overcast and reproachful , as enjoining penance . What a dinner ! Specimens of all the fishes that swim in the sea , surely had swum their way to it , and if samples of the fishes of divers colours that made a speech in the Arabian Nights ( quite a ministerial explanation in respect of cloudiness ) , and then jumped out of the frying - pan , were not to be recognized , it was only because they had all become of one hue by being cooked in batter among the whitebait . And the dishes being seasoned with Bliss — an article which they are sometimes out of , at Greenwich — were of perfect flavour , and the golden drinks had been bottled in the golden age and hoarding up their sparkles ever since . The best of it was , that Bella and John and the cherub had made a covenant that they would not reveal to mortal eyes any appearance whatever of being a wedding party . Now , the supervising dignitary , the Archbishop of Greenwich , knew this as well as if he had performed the nuptial ceremony . And the loftiness with which his Grace entered into their confidence without being invited , and insisted on a show of keeping the waiters out of it , was the crowning glory of the entertainment . There was an innocent young waiter of a slender form and with weakish legs , as yet unversed in the wiles of waiterhood , and but too evidently of a romantic temperament , and deeply ( it were not too much to add hopelessly ) in love with some young female not aware of his merit . This guileless youth , descrying the position of affairs , which even his innocence could not mistake , limited his waiting to languishing admiringly against the sideboard when Bella did n’t want anything , and swooping at her when she did . Him , his Grace the Archbishop perpetually obstructed , cutting him out with his elbow in the moment of success , despatching him in degrading quest of melted butter , and , when by any chance he got hold of any dish worth having , bereaving him of it , and ordering him to stand back . ‘
334319	334329	334315	334315	him	7198	’ said the Archbishop in a low stately voice ; ‘
334345	334389	334390	334391	Whereunto Bella	307	’ This induced John Rokesmith to observe — by way of making the thing more natural—‘Bella , my love , this is so much more successful than any of our past anniversaries , that I think we must keep our future anniversaries here . ’
334408	334419	334390	334391	Whereunto Bella	307	‘ Indeed , I think so , John , dear . ’
334449	334461	334421	334424	the Archbishop of Greenwich	14574	‘ I call upon you by your fealty to believe this ! ’

You will also at once infer the nature and even the terms of the toast I am about to propose on the present occasion . Gentlemen — and Bella and John — the present occasion is an occasion fraught with feelings that I can not trust myself to express . But gentlemen — and Bella and John — for the part I have had in it , for the confidence you have placed in me , and for the affectionate good - nature and kindness with which you have determined not to find me in the way , when I am well aware that I can not be otherwise than in it more or less , I do most heartily thank you . Gentlemen — and Bella and John — my love to you , and may we meet , as on the present occasion , on many future occasions ; that is to say , gentlemen — and Bella and John — on many happy returns of the present happy occasion . ’

336236	336264	336226	336227	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Truly so ? I was not aware that Mr John Rokesmith was a gentleman of landed property . But I am much relieved to hear it . ’

336515	336521	336523	336523	Lavinia	310	‘ The true point is , ’
336525	336647	336523	336523	Lavinia	310	‘ that Bella has behaved in a most unsisterly way to me , and might have severely compromised me with George and with George ’s family , by making off and getting married in this very low and disreputable manner — with some pew - opener or other , I suppose , for a bridesmaid — when she ought to have confided in me , and ought to have said , “ If , Lavvy , you consider it due to your engagement with George , that you should countenance the occasion by being present , then Lavvy , I beg you to BE present , keeping my secret from Ma and Pa. ” As of course I should have done . ’
336648	336659	336661	336662	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ As of course you would have done ? Ingrate ! ’

337523	337541	337513	337514	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ to run counter to the feelings of a child of mine , and of a Youth , ’
337551	337633	337542	337543	Mr Sampson	249	‘ who is the object of her maiden preference . I may feel — nay , know — that I have been deluded and deceived . I may feel — nay , know — that I have been set aside and passed over . I may feel — nay , know — that after having so far overcome my repugnance towards Mr and Mrs Boffin as to receive them under this roof , and to consent to your daughter Bella ’s , ’
337640	337653	337542	337543	Mr Sampson	249	‘ residing under theirs , it were well if your daughter Bella , ’
337660	337722	337542	337543	Mr Sampson	249	‘ had profited in a worldly point of view by a connection so distasteful , so disreputable . I may feel — nay , know — that in uniting herself to Mr Rokesmith she has united herself to one who is , in spite of shallow sophistry , a Mendicant . And I may feel well assured that your daughter Bella , ’
337729	337755	337756	337757	Mr Sampson	249	‘ does not exalt her family by becoming a Mendicant ’s bride . But I suppress what I feel , and say nothing of it . ’
337896	337901	337903	337904	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Therefore , R. W. ’
337916	337934	337903	337904	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ let your daughter Bella come when she will , and she will be received . So , ’

337968	337995	337966	337966	Lavinia	310	‘ that you will not tell Bella what I have undergone . It can do no good , and it might cause her to reproach herself . ’

338006	338013	338003	338004	Mr Sampson	249	‘ she ought to know it . ’

338032	338045	338021	338021	Lavinia	310	‘ No , dearest George , let it be buried in oblivion . ’
338051	338055	338046	338047	Mr Sampson	249	‘ too noble . ’
338056	338065	338067	338067	Lavinia	310	‘ Nothing is too noble , dearest George , ’
338069	338174	338175	338176	Mr Sampson	249	‘ And Pa , I hope you will be careful not to refer before Bella , if you can help it , to my engagement to George . It might seem like reminding her of her having cast herself away . And I hope , Pa , that you will think it equally right to avoid mentioning George ’s rising prospects , when Bella is present . It might seem like taunting her with her own poor fortunes . Let me ever remember that I am her younger sister , and ever spare her painful contrasts , which could not but wound her sharply . ’
338194	338212	338188	338189	Miss Lavvy	317	‘ No , dearest George , I am but too well aware that I am merely human . ’
338393	338405	338406	338406	she	9511	‘ Can you think of your daughter Bella , and sleep ? ’
338416	338427	338412	338412	he	8651	‘ Yes , I think I can , my dear . ’
338428	338431	338433	338434	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Then , ’
338440	338458	338433	338434	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ I would recommend you , if you have a human feeling , to retire to bed . ’
338459	338466	338467	338467	he	8651	‘ Thank you , my dear , ’
338470	338481	338467	338467	he	8651	‘ I think it IS the best place for me . ’
338565	338569	338571	338571	Bella	307	‘ Dearest Ma , ’
338582	338591	338571	338571	Bella	307	‘ how do you do , dearest Ma ? ’
338599	338673	338571	338571	Bella	307	‘ And Lavvy darling , how do YOU do , and how ’s George Sampson , and how is he getting on , and when are you going to be married , and how rich are you going to grow ? You must tell me all about it , Lavvy dear , immediately . John , love , kiss Ma and Lavvy , and then we shall all be at home and comfortable . ’
338715	338862	338701	338701	Bella	307	‘ Dearest Ma and Lavvy , you both take sugar , I know . And Pa ( you good little Pa ) , you do n’t take milk . John does . I did n’t before I was married ; but I do now , because John does . John dear , did you kiss Ma and Lavvy ? Oh , you did ! Quite correct , John dear ; but I did n’t see you do it , so I asked . Cut some bread and butter , John ; that ’s a love . Ma likes it doubled . And now you must tell me , dearest Ma and Lavvy , upon your words and honours ! Did n’t you for a moment — just a moment — think I was a dreadful little wretch when I wrote to say I had run away ? ’
338884	339080	338876	338876	her	14618	‘ I think it must have made you rather cross , dear Ma and Lavvy , and I know I deserved that you should be very cross . But you see I had been such a heedless , heartless creature , and had led you so to expect that I should marry for money , and so to make sure that I was incapable of marrying for love , that I thought you could n’t believe me . Because , you see , you did n’t know how much of Good , Good , Good , I had learnt from John . Well ! So I was sly about it , and ashamed of what you supposed me to be , and fearful that we could n’t understand one another and might come to words , which we should all be sorry for afterwards , and so I said to John that if he liked to take me without any fuss , he might . And as he did like , I let him . And we were married at Greenwich church in the presence of nobody — except an unknown individual who dropped in , ’
339088	339139	339082	339082	her	7271	‘ and half a pensioner . And now , is n’t it nice , dearest Ma and Lavvy , to know that no words have been said which any of us can be sorry for , and that we are all the best of friends at the pleasantest of teas ! ’
339174	339218	339148	339148	she	7271	‘ And now you will naturally want to know , dearest Ma and Lavvy , how we live , and what we have got to live upon . Well ! And so we live on Blackheath , in the charm — ingest of dolls ’
339309	339310	339323	339323	you	8651	’ ‘
339326	339347	339323	339323	you	8651	’ said her husband , smiling , as he stood by her side , without her having detected his approach , ‘
339357	339371	339354	339354	my	0	’ But Bella started up , and put her hand upon his lips . ‘

339508	339522	339504	339504	I	0	’ said John , with a very expressive look of admiration around him , ‘
339528	339557	339504	339504	I	0	’ She laid her laughing cheek upon his breast to thank him , and said , looking at the rest of them sideways out of her bright eyes : ‘
339588	339778	339779	339779	John	315	’ Even Mrs Wilfer relaxed under the influence of her married daughter , and seemed in a majestic manner to imply remotely that if R. W. had been a more deserving object , she too might have condescended to come down from her pedestal for his beguilement . Miss Lavinia , on the other hand , had strong doubts of the policy of the course of treatment , and whether it might not spoil Mr Sampson , if experimented on in the case of that young gentleman . R. W. himself was for his part convinced that he was father of one of the most charming of girls , and that Rokesmith was the most favoured of men ; which opinion , if propounded to him , Rokesmith would probably not have contested . The newly - married pair left early , so that they might walk at leisure to their starting - place from London , for Greenwich . At first they were very cheerful and talked much ; but after a while , Bella fancied that her husband was turning somewhat thoughtful . So she asked him : ‘

339802	339812	339798	339798	you	315	’ said Bella , looking up into his face , ‘

339845	339846	339836	339836	you	315	’ ‘
339852	339860	339847	339847	You	315	’ repeated Bella , shrinking a little . ‘

339985	339990	339980	339980	sir	8755	’ Bella playfully rejoined ; ‘
340027	340037	340046	340046	you	0	’ Laughing and pressing her arm , he retorted : ‘
340051	340052	340053	340053	I	0	’ ‘
340058	340067	340053	340053	I	0	’ said Bella , thoughtfully shaking her head . ‘

340111	340120	340097	340097	you	0	’ he asked , looking earnestly at her . ‘
340152	340153	340154	340154	I	0	’ ‘
340160	340161	340154	340154	I	0	’ ‘
340165	340166	340163	340163	John	762	’ ‘
340256	340257	340231	340231	you	7297	’ ‘
340297	340298	340291	340291	I	0	’ ‘
340301	340305	340291	340291	I	0	’ he pursued , ‘
340356	340357	340379	340379	you	762	’ ‘
340363	340375	340379	340379	you	762	’ said Bella , glancing downward at the feet in question , ‘
340417	340418	340419	340419	You	762	’ ‘
340431	340432	340429	340429	Bella	307	’ ‘
340514	340615	340512	340512	John	762	’ They were not the less happy for such talk , and home was not the less home for coming after it . Bella was fast developing a perfect genius for home . All the loves and graces seemed ( her husband thought ) to have taken domestic service with her , and to help her to make home engaging . Her married life glided happily on . She was alone all day , for , after an early breakfast her husband repaired every morning to the City , and did not return until their late dinner hour . He was ‘
340621	340977	340512	340512	John	762	’ he explained to Bella : which she found quite satisfactory , without pursuing the China house into minuter details than a wholesale vision of tea , rice , odd - smelling silks , carved boxes , and tight - eyed people in more than double - soled shoes , with their pigtails pulling their heads of hair off , painted on transparent porcelain . She always walked with her husband to the railroad , and was always there again to meet him ; her old coquettish ways a little sobered down ( but not much ) , and her dress as daintily managed as if she managed nothing else . But , John gone to business and Bella returned home , the dress would be laid aside , trim little wrappers and aprons would be substituted , and Bella , putting back her hair with both hands , as if she were making the most business - like arrangements for going dramatically distracted , would enter on the household affairs of the day . Such weighing and mixing and chopping and grating , such dusting and washing and polishing , such snipping and weeding and trowelling and other small gardening , such making and mending and folding and airing , such diverse arrangements , and above all such severe study ! For Mrs J. R. , who had never been wo nt to do too much at home as Miss B. W. , was under the constant necessity of referring for advice and support to a sage volume entitled The Complete British Family Housewife , which she would sit consulting , with her elbows on the table and her temples on her hands , like some perplexed enchantress poring over the Black Art . This , principally because the Complete British Housewife , however sound a Briton at heart , was by no means an expert Briton at expressing herself with clearness in the British tongue , and sometimes might have issued her directions to equal purpose in the Kamskatchan language . In any crisis of this nature , Bella would suddenly exclaim aloud , ‘
340997	341048	340991	340991	You	7306	’ And having made this marginal note , would try the Housewife again , with all her dimples screwed into an expression of profound research . There was likewise a coolness on the part of the British Housewife , which Mrs John Rokesmith found highly exasperating . She would say , ‘
341053	341076	340991	340991	You	7306	’ as if a general should command a private to catch a Tartar . Or , she would casually issue the order , ‘
341082	341118	340991	340991	You	7306	’ of something entirely unattainable . In these , the Housewife ’s most glaring moments of unreason , Bella would shut her up and knock her on the table , apostrophising her with the compliment , ‘
341138	341293	341135	341135	you	7306	’ Another branch of study claimed the attention of Mrs John Rokesmith for a regular period every day . This was the mastering of the newspaper , so that she might be close up with John on general topics when John came home . In her desire to be in all things his companion , she would have set herself with equal zeal to master Algebra , or Euclid , if he had divided his soul between her and either . Wonderful was the way in which she would store up the City Intelligence , and beamingly shed it upon John in the course of the evening ; incidentally mentioning the commodities that were looking up in the markets , and how much gold had been taken to the Bank , and trying to look wise and serious over it until she would laugh at herself most charmingly and would say , kissing him : ‘
341304	341456	341301	341302	John dear	7187	’ For a City man , John certainly did appear to care as little as might be for the looking up or looking down of things , as well as for the gold that got taken to the Bank . But he cared , beyond all expression , for his wife , as a most precious and sweet commodity that was always looking up , and that never was worth less than all the gold in the world . And she , being inspired by her affection , and having a quick wit and a fine ready instinct , made amazing progress in her domestic efficiency , though , as an endearing creature , she made no progress at all . This was her husband ’s verdict , and he justified it by telling her that she had begun her married life as the most endearing creature that could possibly be . ‘
341465	341471	341458	341458	you	7311	’ he said , fondly . ‘
341482	341483	341458	341458	you	7311	’ ‘
341490	341491	341493	341493	you	0	’ ‘

341517	341530	341511	341511	you	315	’ said Bella , taking him by a button of his coat , ‘
341546	341564	341542	341542	John	315	’ Nothing should induce John to do it , when she asked him not to do it . ‘
341579	341580	341571	341571	John	315	’ ‘
341590	341591	341571	341571	John	315	’ ‘

341638	341652	341635	341635	I	0	’ said Bella , laughing as she laid her head upon his shoulder . ‘
341670	341683	341667	341667	I	0	’ And she laughed again , and something glistened in her eyes . ‘
341693	341699	341685	341685	you	7311	’ he asked her coaxingly . ‘
341713	341714	341706	341706	you	7311	’ ‘
341723	341724	341716	341716	you	315	’ ‘
341730	341749	341706	341706	you	7311	’ Bella confidently answered . But then , suddenly changing , she said , between laughing and glistening : ‘
341762	341763	341757	341757	I	0	’ ‘
341806	341911	341912	341912	You	7318	’ Bella might be very anxious on the subject , but she scarcely seemed so at the moment . With an absent air , she was investigating that button on her husband ’s coat , when Pa came in to spend the evening . Pa had his special chair and his special corner reserved for him on all occasions , and — without disparagement of his domestic joys — was far happier there , than anywhere . It was always pleasantly droll to see Pa and Bella together ; but on this present evening her husband thought her more than usually fantastic with him . ‘
341920	341924	341942	341942	they	7321	’ said Bella , ‘
341954	341955	341942	341942	they	7321	’ ‘
341961	341980	341942	341942	they	7321	’ replied the cherub , smiling and rubbing his hands as she sat him down in his chair , ‘
342009	342010	342003	342003	you	7318	’ ‘
342013	342017	342003	342003	you	7318	’ said Bella . ‘

342096	342106	342071	342071	you	0	’ said the cherub , after a little consideration , ‘

342121	342125	342116	342119	a very bad boy	7331	’ retorted Bella , ‘

342142	342147	342139	342140	My Bella	14010	’ rejoined her father , ‘
342163	342169	342155	342155	I	0	’ Which his face confirmed . ‘
342189	342193	342187	342187	I	0	’ said Bella ; ‘

342228	342229	342222	342222	we	7333	’ ‘
342239	342254	342230	342230	He	7334	’ said Bella , looking at her father ’s hand and lightly slapping it , ‘
342270	342271	342266	342268	a grubby child	7337	’ ‘
342277	342282	342266	342268	a grubby child	7337	’ said her father , ‘

342311	342324	342297	342297	you	919	’ cried Bella , taking him by the front of his coat , ‘
342349	342413	342347	342347	sir	8755	’ The cherub , to his genial amusement , was accordingly conducted to a little washing - room , where Bella soaped his face and rubbed his face , and soaped his hands and rubbed his hands , and splashed him and rinsed him and towelled him , until he was as red as beet - root , even to his very ears : ‘
342424	342430	342422	342422	sir	8755	’ said Bella , busily . ‘
342463	342543	342445	342445	me	0	’ Her father being more than willing to obey , she dressed his hair in her most elaborate manner , brushing it out straight , parting it , winding it over her fingers , sticking it up on end , and constantly falling back on John to get a good look at the effect of it . Who always received her on his disengaged arm , and detained her , while the patient cherub stood waiting to be finished . ‘
342546	342560	342445	342445	me	0	’ said Bella , when she had at last completed the final touches . ‘
342583	342648	342445	342445	me	0	’ The cherub investing himself with his coat was led back to his corner — where , but for having no egotism in his pleasant nature , he would have answered well enough for that radiant though self - sufficient boy , Jack Horner — Bella with her own hands laid a cloth for him , and brought him his supper on a tray . ‘
342653	342657	342445	342445	me	0	’ said she , ‘
342666	342919	342445	342445	me	0	’ and tied a napkin under his chin , in a very methodical manner . While he took his supper , Bella sat by him , sometimes admonishing him to hold his fork by the handle , like a polite child , and at other times carving for him , or pouring out his drink . Fantastic as it all was , and accustomed as she ever had been to make a plaything of her good father , ever delighted that she should put him to that account , still there was an occasional something on Bella ’s part that was new . It could not be said that she was less playful , whimsical , or natural , than she always had been ; but it seemed , her husband thought , as if there were some rather graver reason than he had supposed for what she had so lately said , and as if throughout all this , there were glimpses of an underlying seriousness . It was a circumstance in support of this view of the case , that when she had lighted her father ’s pipe , and mixed him his glass of grog , she sat down on a stool between her father and her husband , leaning her arm upon the latter , and was very quiet . So quiet , that when her father rose to take his leave , she looked round with a start , as if she had forgotten his being there . ‘
342930	342931	342928	342928	John	315	’ ‘
342940	342941	342938	342938	you	7345	’ ‘

343066	343099	343063	343064	gentle Pa	580	’ Left to herself she sat down to write , and wrote Lizzie a long letter . She had but completed it and read it over , when her husband came back . ‘
343108	343112	343106	343106	sir	8755	’ said Bella ; ‘
343188	343274	343277	343277	sir	8755	’ Her letter folded , sealed , and directed , and her pen wiped , and her middle finger wiped , and her desk locked up and put away , and these transactions performed with an air of severe business sedateness , which the Complete British Housewife might have assumed , and certainly would not have rounded off and broken down in with a musical laugh , as Bella did : she placed her husband in his chair , and placed herself upon her stool . ‘
343290	343323	343324	343325	John Rokesmith	315	’ A question more decidedly rushing at the secret he was keeping from her , could not have astounded him . But he kept his countenance and his secret , and answered , ‘
343330	343331	343324	343325	John Rokesmith	315	’ ‘
343341	343360	343361	343361	My	0	’ With a returning suspicion that something might have betrayed him to her , he answered , interrogatively , ‘

343375	343379	343361	343361	My	0	’ said Bella . ‘
343452	343503	343429	343429	you	315	’ Again , his secret ! He looked down at her as she looked up at him , with her hands folded on his knee , and it was as nearly told as ever secret was . Having no reply ready , he could do no better than embrace her . ‘
343510	343514	343429	343429	you	315	’ said Bella , ‘
343537	343538	343530	343530	I	0	’ ‘

343565	343569	343562	343562	John	315	’ Bella hesitated . ‘

343720	343731	343733	343733	I	0	’ he softly asked her with his lips to hers , ‘

343856	343877	343878	343878	I	0	’ She did so on his neck , and , still clinging there , laughed a little when she said , ‘

343897	343901	343887	343887	John	315	’ said John , ‘

344315	344323	344304	344304	we	7372	’ cried her husband , rallying her , ‘
344334	344335	344362	344362	Lord	7373	’ ‘
344339	344351	344362	344362	Lord	7373	’ said Bella , twisting the button and shaking her head , ‘

344375	344379	344362	344362	Lord	7373	’ exclaimed John . ‘
344391	344400	344362	344362	Lord	7373	’ said Bella , occupied with the button , ‘
344426	344457	344423	344423	John	315	’ As he bent his face to hers , she raised hers to meet it , and laid her little right hand on his eyes , and kept it there . ‘

344524	345311	344522	344522	John	315	’ Chapter 6 A CRY FOR HELP The Paper Mill had stopped work for the night , and the paths and roads in its neighbourhood were sprinkled with clusters of people going home from their day ’s labour in it . There were men , women , and children in the groups , and there was no want of lively colour to flutter in the gentle evening wind . The mingling of various voices and the sound of laughter made a cheerful impression upon the ear , analogous to that of the fluttering colours upon the eye . Into the sheet of water reflecting the flushed sky in the foreground of the living picture , a knot of urchins were casting stones , and watching the expansion of the rippling circles . So , in the rosy evening , one might watch the ever - widening beauty of the landscape — beyond the newly - released workers wending home — beyond the silver river — beyond the deep green fields of corn , so prospering , that the loiterers in their narrow threads of pathway seemed to float immersed breast - high — beyond the hedgerows and the clumps of trees — beyond the windmills on the ridge — away to where the sky appeared to meet the earth , as if there were no immensity of space between mankind and Heaven . It was a Saturday evening , and at such a time the village dogs , always much more interested in the doings of humanity than in the affairs of their own species , were particularly active . At the general shop , at the butcher ’s and at the public - house , they evinced an inquiring spirit never to be satiated . Their especial interest in the public - house would seem to imply some latent rakishness in the canine character ; for little was eaten there , and they , having no taste for beer or tobacco ( Mrs Hubbard ’s dog is said to have smoked , but proof is wanting ) , could only have been attracted by sympathy with loose convivial habits . Moreover , a most wretched fiddle played within ; a fiddle so unutterably vile , that one lean long - bodied cur , with a better ear than the rest , found himself under compulsion at intervals to go round the corner and howl . Yet , even he returned to the public - house on each occasion with the tenacity of a confirmed drunkard . Fearful to relate , there was even a sort of little Fair in the village . Some despairing gingerbread that had been vainly trying to dispose of itself all over the country , and had cast a quantity of dust upon its head in its mortification , again appealed to the public from an infirm booth . So did a heap of nuts , long , long exiled from Barcelona , and yet speaking English so indifferently as to call fourteen of themselves a pint . A Peep - show which had originally started with the Battle of Waterloo , and had since made it every other battle of later date by altering the Duke of Wellington ’s nose , tempted the student of illustrated history . A Fat Lady , perhaps in part sustained upon postponed pork , her professional associate being a Learned Pig , displayed her life - size picture in a low dress as she appeared when presented at Court , several yards round . All this was a vicious spectacle as any poor idea of amusement on the part of the rougher hewers of wood and drawers of water in this land of England ever is and shall be . They MUST NOT vary the rheumatism with amusement . They may vary it with fever and ague , or with as many rheumatic variations as they have joints ; but positively not with entertainment after their own manner . The various sounds arising from this scene of depravity , and floating away into the still evening air , made the evening , at any point which they just reached fitfully , mellowed by the distance , more still by contrast . Such was the stillness of the evening to Eugene Wrayburn , as he walked by the river with his hands behind him . He walked slowly , and with the measured step and preoccupied air of one who was waiting . He walked between the two points , an osier - bed at this end and some floating lilies at that , and at each point stopped and looked expectantly in one direction . ‘
345317	345369	344522	344522	John	315	’ said he . It was very quiet . Some sheep were grazing on the grass by the river - side , and it seemed to him that he had never before heard the crisp tearing sound with which they cropped it . He stopped idly , and looked at them . ‘
345412	345425	345393	345393	you	7382	’ A rustle in a field beyond the hedge attracted his attention . ‘
345432	345445	345446	345450	No jealous paper - miller	7384	’ he asked himself leisurely going towards the gate and looking over . ‘
345468	345581	345636	345636	she	7387	’ The field had been newly mown , and there were yet the marks of the scythe on the yellow - green ground , and the track of wheels where the hay had been carried . Following the tracks with his eyes , the view closed with the new hayrick in a corner . Now , if he had gone on to the hayrick , and gone round it ? But , say that the event was to be , as the event fell out , and how idle are such suppositions ! Besides , if he had gone ; what is there of warning in a Bargeman lying on his face ? ‘
345589	345606	345636	345636	she	7387	’ was all he thought about it ; and came back , and resumed his walk . ‘
345618	345630	345614	345614	her	7387	’ said Eugene , after taking some half - dozen turns , ‘
345660	345680	345681	345681	I	0	’ Turning again at the water - lilies , he saw her coming , and advanced to meet her . ‘
345701	345702	345681	345681	I	0	’ ‘
345734	345735	345725	345729	several people in passing along	7390	’ ‘
345752	345794	345725	345729	several people in passing along	7390	’ he asked , as he took her hand and drew it through his arm . She submitted to walk slowly on , with downcast eyes . He put her hand to his lips , and she quietly drew it away . ‘
345809	345833	345796	345796	you	269	’ For , his arm was already stealing round her waist . She stopped again , and gave him an earnest supplicating look . ‘
345840	345854	345836	345836	Lizzie	246	’ said he , in an easy way though ill at ease with himself ‘

345986	345987	345982	345982	you	246	’ ‘
345999	346010	345989	345989	you	246	’ for , his arm was coming about her again ; ‘
346022	346023	346019	346020	Mr Wrayburn	269	’ ‘
346039	346051	346037	346037	Lizzie	246	’ he answered with pleasant gaiety as he folded his arms . ‘

346079	346099	346100	346100	you	0	’ said Lizzie , fixing her eyes upon him with the look of supplication which troubled his better nature , ‘

346132	346137	346100	346100	you	0	’ replied Eugene composedly , ‘

346171	346172	346168	346169	Mr Wrayburn	269	’ ‘
346179	346184	346161	346161	you	0	’ he openly answered , ‘

346232	346241	346229	346230	Mr Wrayburn	269	’ she answered , suddenly breaking into tears , ‘
346268	346269	346253	346254	Mr Wrayburn	269	’ ‘
346299	346305	346297	346297	Eugene	269	‘ do n’t be distressed ! ’
346306	346346	346348	346348	Lizzie	246	‘ What else can I be , when I know the distance and the difference between us ? What else can I be , when to tell me why you came here , is to put me to shame ! ’
346390	346505	346506	346506	She	7398	‘ Lizzie ! I never thought before , that there was a woman in the world who could affect me so much by saying so little . But do n’t be hard in your construction of me . You do n’t know what my state of mind towards you is . You do n’t know how you haunt me and bewilder me . You do n’t know how the cursed carelessness that is over - officious in helping me at every other turning of my life , WON’T help me here . You have struck it dead , I think , and I sometimes almost wish you had struck me dead along with it . ’
346559	346632	346550	346550	she	7398	‘ It grieves you to see me distressed , Mr Wrayburn ; it grieves me to see you distressed . I do n’t reproach you . Indeed I do n’t reproach you . You have not felt this as I feel it , being so different from me , and beginning from another point of view . You have not thought . But I entreat you to think now , think now ! ’
346633	346641	346643	346643	Eugene	269	‘ What am I to think of ? ’
346647	346652	346643	346643	Eugene	269	‘ Think of me . ’
346653	346672	346550	346550	she	7398	‘ Tell me how NOT to think of you , Lizzie , and you ’ll change me altogether . ’
346673	346790	346550	346550	she	7398	‘ I do n’t mean in that way . Think of me , as belonging to another station , and quite cut off from you in honour . Remember that I have no protector near me , unless I have one in your noble heart . Respect my good name . If you feel towards me , in one particular , as you might if I was a lady , give me the full claims of a lady upon your generous behaviour . I am removed from you and your family by being a working girl . How true a gentleman to be as considerate of me as if I was removed by being a Queen ! ’
346815	346825	346812	346812	he	7400	‘ Have I injured you so much , Lizzie ? ’
346826	346893	346550	346550	she	7398	‘ No , no . You may set me quite right . I do n’t speak of the past , Mr Wrayburn , but of the present and the future . Are we not here now , because through two days you have followed me so closely where there are so many eyes to see you , that I consented to this appointment as an escape ? ’
346894	346906	346908	346908	Eugene	269	‘ Again , not very flattering to my self - love , ’
346912	346920	346908	346908	Eugene	269	‘ but yes . Yes . Yes . ’
346921	346953	346954	346954	He	269	‘ Then I beseech you , Mr Wrayburn , I beg and pray you , leave this neighbourhood . If you do not , consider to what you will drive me . ’
346969	346982	346958	346958	himself	269	‘ Drive you ? To what shall I drive you , Lizzie ? ’
346983	347044	346908	346908	Eugene	269	‘ You will drive me away . I live here peacefully and respected , and I am well employed here . You will force me to quit this place as I quitted London , and — by following me again — will force me to quit the next place in which I may find refuge , as I quitted this . ’
347045	347073	346908	346908	Eugene	269	‘ Are you so determined , Lizzie — forgive the word I am going to use , for its literal truth — to fly from a lover ? ’
347074	347080	347081	347081	she	7402	‘ I am so determined , ’
347088	347138	347081	347081	she	7402	‘ to fly from such a lover . There was a poor woman died here but a little while ago , scores of years older than I am , whom I found by chance , lying on the wet earth . You may have heard some account of her ? ’
347139	347145	347146	347146	he	7403	‘ I think I have , ’
347149	347156	347146	347146	he	7403	‘ if her name was Higden . ’
347157	347264	347265	347265	He	7404	‘ Her name was Higden . Though she was so weak and old , she kept true to one purpose to the very last . Even at the very last , she made me promise that her purpose should be kept to , after she was dead , so settled was her determination . What she did , I can do . Mr Wrayburn , if I believed — but I do not believe — that you could be so cruel to me as to drive me from place to place to wear me out , you should drive me to death and not do it . ’
347368	347411	347361	347361	he	7404	‘ Lizzie ! Rest so a moment . Answer what I ask you . If I had not been what you call removed from you and cut off from you , would you have made this appeal to me to leave you ? ’
347412	347436	347361	347361	he	7404	‘ I do n’t know , I do n’t know . Do n’t ask me , Mr Wrayburn . Let me go back . ’
347437	347477	347522	347522	he	7406	‘ I swear to you , Lizzie , you shall go directly . I swear to you , you shall go alone . I ’ll not accompany you , I ’ll not follow you , if you will reply . ’
347478	347506	347361	347361	he	7404	‘ How can I , Mr Wrayburn ? How can I tell you what I should have done , if you had not been what you are ? ’
347507	347521	347522	347522	he	7406	‘ If I had not been what you make me out to be , ’
347533	347541	347522	347522	he	7406	‘ would you still have hated me ? ’
347542	347547	347548	347548	she	7407	‘ O Mr Wrayburn , ’
347555	347566	347548	347548	she	7407	‘ you know me better than to think I do ! ’
347567	347592	347522	347522	he	7406	‘ If I had not been what you make me out to be , Lizzie , would you still have been indifferent to me ? ’
347593	347598	347599	347599	she	7407	‘ O Mr Wrayburn , ’
347604	347613	347599	347599	she	7407	‘ you know me better than that too ! ’
347664	347739	347658	347658	he	7406	‘ If I know you better than quite to believe ( unfortunate dog though I am ! ) that you hate me , or even that you are wholly indifferent to me , Lizzie , let me know so much more from yourself before we separate . Let me know how you would have dealt with me if you had regarded me as being what you would have considered on equal terms with you . ’
347740	347896	347658	347658	he	7406	‘ It is impossible , Mr Wrayburn . How can I think of you as being on equal terms with me ? If my mind could put you on equal terms with me , you could not be yourself . How could I remember , then , the night when I first saw you , and when I went out of the room because you looked at me so attentively ? Or , the night that passed into the morning when you broke to me that my father was dead ? Or , the nights when you used to come to see me at my next home ? Or , your having known how uninstructed I was , and having caused me to be taught better ? Or , my having so looked up to you and wondered at you , and at first thought you so good to be at all mindful of me ? ’
347897	347924	347992	347992	she	7408	‘ Only “ at first ” thought me so good , Lizzie ? What did you think me after “ at first ” ? So bad ? ’
347925	347979	347658	347658	he	7406	‘ I do n’t say that . I do n’t mean that . But after the first wonder and pleasure of being noticed by one so different from any one who had ever spoken to me , I began to feel that it might have been better if I had never seen you . ’
347980	347983	347658	347658	he	7406	‘ Why ? ’
347984	347991	347992	347992	she	7408	‘ Because you WERE so different , ’
347999	348012	347992	347992	she	7408	‘ Because it was so endless , so hopeless . Spare me ! ’
348013	348024	348025	348025	he	7409	‘ Did you think for me at all , Lizzie ? ’
348036	348050	348025	348025	he	7409	‘ Not much , Mr Wrayburn . Not much until to - night . ’
348051	348058	347658	347658	he	7406	‘ Will you tell me why ? ’
348059	348129	348025	348025	he	7409	‘ I never supposed until to - night that you needed to be thought for . But if you do need to be ; if you do truly feel at heart that you have indeed been towards me what you have called yourself to - night , and that there is nothing for us in this life but separation ; then Heaven help you , and Heaven bless you ! ’
348190	348222	348183	348183	he	7409	‘ I promised that I would not accompany you , nor follow you . Shall I keep you in view ? You have been agitated , and it ’s growing dark . ’
348223	348244	348309	348309	he	7411	‘ I am used to be out alone at this hour , and I entreat you not to do so . ’
348245	348271	348309	348309	he	7411	‘ I promise . I can bring myself to promise nothing more tonight , Lizzie , except that I will try what I can do . ’
348272	348301	348183	348183	he	7409	‘ There is but one means , Mr Wrayburn , of sparing yourself and of sparing me , every way . Leave this neighbourhood to - morrow morning . ’
348302	348307	348309	348309	he	7411	‘ I will try . ’
348337	348345	348347	348347	Eugene	269	‘ Now , could Mortimer believe this ? ’
348362	348370	348371	348371	He	7411	‘ Can I even believe it myself ? ’
348391	348404	348406	348406	his	7411	‘ A most ridiculous position this , to be found out in ! ’
348428	348452	348406	348406	his	7411	‘ Yet I have gained a wonderful power over her , too , let her be as much in earnest as she will ! ’
348500	348575	348476	348476	he	7411	‘ And she loves me . And so earnest a character must be very earnest in that passion . She can not choose for herself to be strong in this fancy , wavering in that , and weak in the other . She must go through with her nature , as I must go through with mine . If mine exacts its pains and penalties all round , so must hers , I suppose . ’
348587	348718	348584	348584	he	7411	‘ Now , if I married her . If , outfacing the absurdity of the situation in correspondence with M. R. F. , I astonished M. R. F. to the utmost extent of his respected powers , by informing him that I had married her , how would M. R. F. reason with the legal mind ? “ You would n’t marry for some money and some station , because you were frightfully likely to become bored . Are you less frightfully likely to become bored , marrying for no money and no station ? Are you sure of yourself ? ” Legal mind , in spite of forensic protestations , must secretly admit , “ Good reasoning on the part of M. R. F. NOT sure of myself . ” ’
348748	348752	348754	348754	Eugene	269	‘ And yet , ’
348756	348902	348754	348754	Eugene	269	‘ I should like to see the fellow ( Mortimer excepted ) who would undertake to tell me that this was not a real sentiment on my part , won out of me by her beauty and her worth , in spite of myself , and that I would not be true to her . I should particularly like to see the fellow to - night who would tell me so , or who would tell me anything that could be construed to her disadvantage ; for I am wearily out of sorts with one Wrayburn who cuts a sorry figure , and I would far rather be out of sorts with somebody else . “ Eugene , Eugene , Eugene , this is a bad business . ” Ah ! So go the Mortimer Lightwood bells , and they sound melancholy to - night . ’
348918	348927	348928	348928	he	7415	‘ Where is the analogy , Brute Beast , ’
348932	348984	348928	348928	he	7415	‘ between a woman whom your father coolly finds out for you and a woman whom you have found out for yourself , and have ever drifted after with more and more of constancy since you first set eyes upon her ? Ass ! Can you reason no better than that ? ’
349038	349051	349118	349118	He	7415	‘ Eugene , Eugene , Eugene , this is a bad business ! ’
349054	349071	349118	349118	He	7415	‘ I wish I could stop the Lightwood peal , for it sounds like a knell . ’
349184	349189	349191	349191	Eugene	269	‘ Halloa , friend ! ’
349197	349202	349191	349191	Eugene	269	‘ are you blind ? ’
349506	349515	349517	349517	Eugene	269	‘ Out of the question to marry her , ’
349519	349532	349533	349533	He	269	‘ and out of the question to leave her . The crisis ! ’
350820	350828	350799	350799	she	246	‘ if she had anything to forgive . ’
351141	351147	351125	351129	The first of the surgeons	7503	‘ Who brought him in ? ’
351148	351156	351158	351158	Lizzie	246	‘ I brought him in , sir , ’
351166	351184	351158	351158	Lizzie	246	‘ You , my dear ? You could not lift , far less carry , this weight . ’
351185	351205	351206	351207	The surgeon	7505	‘ I think I could not , at another time , sir ; but I am sure I did . ’
351341	351348	351350	351352	the first surgeon	7509	‘ Attend to the poor girl , ’
351355	351425	351350	351352	the first surgeon	7509	‘ She is quite unconscious . She sees nothing and hears nothing . All the better for her ! Do n’t rouse her , if you can help it ; only move her . Poor girl , poor girl ! She must be amazingly strong of heart , but it is much to be feared that she has set her heart upon the dead . Be gentle with her . ’
351630	351637	351638	351638	he	7515	‘ Is he afraid of me ? ’

351945	351956	351958	351958	Bradley	517	‘ Yes . I had better sleep , I think , ’
351965	351974	351976	351976	Riderhood	383	‘ I myself should recommend it , governor , ’
351978	351985	351976	351976	Riderhood	383	‘ Might you be anyways dry ? ’
351986	351995	351997	351997	Bradley	517	‘ Yes . I should like a drink , ’
352134	352213	352120	352120	He	360	‘ One of his sleeves is tore right away below the elber , and the t’other ’s had a good rip at the shoulder .

And he ’s spotted , and I know with what , and with whose . Hooroar ! ’

You know that I took you with me when I was watching him with a view to recovering my sister and bringing her to her senses ; you know that I have allowed myself to be mixed up with you , all through this business , in favouring your desire to marry my sister . And how do you know that , pursuing the ends of your own violent temper , you have not laid me open to suspicion ? Is that your gratitude to me , Mr Headstone ? ’

What I mean is this : if you were a good master , I was a good pupil . I have done you plenty of credit , and in improving my own reputation I have improved yours quite as much . Very well then . Starting on equal terms , I want to put before you how you have shown your gratitude to me , for doing all I could to further your wishes with reference to my sister . You have compromised me by being seen about with me , endeavouring to counteract this Mr Eugene Wrayburn . That ’s the first thing you have done . If my character , and my now dropping you , help me out of that , Mr Headstone , the deliverance is to be attributed to me , and not to you . No thanks to you for it ! ’

You are as well aware as I am , that I have had many disadvantages to leave behind me in life . You have heard me mention my father , and you are sufficiently acquainted with the fact that the home from which I , as I may say , escaped , might have been a more creditable one than it was . My father died , and then it might have been supposed that my way to respectability was pretty clear . No . For then my sister begins . ’

I confided in you about her . I explained her character to you , and how she interposed some ridiculous fanciful notions in the way of our being as respectable as I tried for . You fell in love with her , and I favoured you with all my might . She could not be induced to favour you , and so we came into collision with this Mr Eugene Wrayburn . Now , what have you done ? Why , you have justified my sister in being firmly set against you from first to last , and you have put me in the wrong again ! And why have you done it ? Because , Mr Headstone , you are in all your passions so selfish , and so concentrated upon yourself that you have not bestowed one proper thought on me . ’
356453	356457	356458	356458	he	1061	‘ It is , ’

Not content with doing what I have put before you , you will drag my name into notoriety through dragging my sister’s — which you are pretty sure to do , if my suspicions have any foundation at all — and the worse you prove to be , the harder it will be for me to detach myself from being associated with you in people ’s minds . ’
356585	356839	356578	356578	he	1061	‘ However , I have made up my mind that I will become respectable in the scale of society , and that I will not be dragged down by others . I have done with my sister as well as with you . Since she cares so little for me as to care nothing for undermining my respectability , she shall go her way and I will go mine . My prospects are very good , and I mean to follow them alone . Mr Headstone , I do n’t say what you have got upon your conscience , for I do n’t know . Whatever lies upon it , I hope you will see the justice of keeping wide and clear of me , and will find a consolation in completely exonerating all but yourself . I hope , before many years are out , to succeed the master in my present school , and the mistress being a single woman , though some years older than I am , I might even marry her . If it is any comfort to you to know what plans I may work out by keeping myself strictly respectable in the scale of society , these are the plans at present occurring to me . In conclusion , if you feel a sense of having injured me , and a desire to make some small reparation , I hope you will think how respectable you might have been yourself and will contemplate your blighted existence . ’

She often moralized over her work on the tricks and the manners of that venerable cheat , but made her little purchases elsewhere , and lived a secluded life . After much consultation with herself , she decided not to put Lizzie Hexam on her guard against the old man , arguing that the disappointment of finding him out would come upon her quite soon enough . Therefore , in her communication with her friend by letter , she was silent on this theme , and principally dilated on the backslidings of her bad child , who every day grew worse and worse . ‘

But dead drunk or dead sober ( he had come to such a pass that he was least alive in the latter state ) , it was always on the conscience of the paralytic scarecrow that he had betrayed his sharp parent for sixty threepennyworths of rum , which were all gone , and that her sharpness would infallibly detect his having done it , sooner or later . All things considered therefore , and addition made of the state of his body to the state of his mind , the bed on which Mr Dolls reposed was a bed of roses from which the flowers and leaves had entirely faded , leaving him to lie upon the thorns and stalks . On a certain day , Miss Wren was alone at her work , with the house - door set open for coolness , and was trolling in a small sweet voice a mournful little song which might have been the song of the doll she was dressing , bemoaning the brittleness and meltability of wax , when whom should she descry standing on the pavement , looking in at her , but Mr Fledgeby . ‘

358588	358597	358599	358600	Miss Wren	523	‘ Light blue , my sweet young lady , ’

358677	358682	358690	358691	Little Eyes	780	’ thought the dressmaker . ‘
358714	358720	358713	358713	you	7615	’re too cunning by half . ’
358721	358729	358731	358731	Fledgeby	548	‘ And I take it for granted , ’
358733	358754	358731	358731	Fledgeby	548	‘ that to get the most of your materials for nothing would be well worth your while , Miss Jenny ? ’
358755	358763	358765	358766	the dressmaker	10803	‘ You may take it for granted , ’
358772	358785	358765	358766	the dressmaker	10803	‘ that it ’s always well worth my while to make money . ’
358786	358789	358791	358791	Fledgeby	548	‘ Now , ’

You ca n’t come to be intimate with such a deep file as Judah without beginning to see a little way into him , you know , ’
358873	358878	358880	358881	the dressmaker	10803	‘ I must own , ’
358890	358900	358880	358881	the dressmaker	10803	‘ that we are not good friends at present . ’

358976	358999	359002	359002	I	0	’ Mr Fledgeby said this with some display of indignant warmth , as if he was counsel in the cause for Virtue . ‘
359010	359015	359002	359002	I	0	’ began the dressmaker . ‘
359023	359027	359019	359019	I	0	’ said Fledgeby . ‘

She then briskly resumed her work , and said with a sidelong glance of her eyes and chin at Mr Fledgeby : ‘
359301	359302	359232	359232	you	0	’ ‘
359307	359311	359232	359232	you	0	’ replied Fledgeby . ‘

359330	359341	359314	359314	you	0	’ said Jenny , in her abruptest and shortest manner . ‘

359371	359376	359367	359369	Those two ladies	7627	’ pointing to dolls , ‘

359509	359510	359506	359507	Miss Jenny	523	’ ‘
359518	359560	359515	359516	young man	10661	’ Mr Fledgeby ’s prepossessing form withdrew itself ; and the little dressmaker , clipping and snipping and stitching , and stitching and snipping and clipping , fell to work at a great rate ; musing and muttering all the time . ‘
359679	359714	359678	359678	HE	7634	’S a liar . That ’s all I can make out at present ; but you may go to bed in the Albany , Piccadilly , with THAT for your pillow , young man ! ’

359957	360039	360040	360040	You	7640	’ dressmaker . However , she was on the alert next morning , and drove to Bond Street , and set down the two ladies punctually , and then directed her equipage to conduct her to the Albany . Arrived at the doorway of the house in which Mr Fledgeby ’s chambers were , she found a lady standing there in a travelling dress , holding in her hand — of all things in the world — a gentleman ’s hat . ‘
360045	360054	360055	360055	I	0	’ said the lady in a stern manner . ‘
360065	360066	360055	360055	I	0	’ ‘
360119	360171	360109	360110	the gentleman	1107	’ While speaking , and afterwards , the lady kept watchfully between her and the staircase , as if prepared to oppose her going up , by force . The lady being of a stature to stop her with a hand , and looking mightily determined , the dressmaker stood still . ‘
360179	360184	360176	360176	you	7640	’ asked the lady . ‘
360190	360195	360176	360176	you	7640	’ said the dressmaker . ‘
360201	360210	360198	360198	you	7640	’ asked the lady , altering her phrase . ‘
360220	360230	360231	360232	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ said the dressmaker , with an inquiring look . ‘
360241	360248	360234	360234	his	548	’ remarked the lady , smiling . ‘
360259	360260	360250	360254	somebody ’s beating a carpet	7647	’ ‘
360270	360374	360261	360262	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ replied the smiling lady . Miss Wren had a reasonably good eye for smiles , being well accustomed to them on the part of her young friends , though their smiles mostly ran smaller than in nature . But she had never seen so singular a smile as that upon this lady ’s face . It twitched her nostrils open in a remarkable manner , and contracted her lips and eyebrows . It was a smile of enjoyment too , though of such a fierce kind that Miss Wren thought she would rather not enjoy herself than do it in that way . ‘
360377	360385	360261	360262	Mr Fledgeby	548	’ said the lady , watching her . ‘

360419	360428	360413	360413	I	0	’ said Miss Wren , staring about her . ‘

360456	360563	360451	360451	you	0	’ returned the lady with a significant frown , and drawing closer . On this hint , the dressmaker relinquished the idea , and stood looking at the lady as hard as the lady looked at her . Meanwhile the dressmaker listened with amazement to the odd noises which still continued , and the lady listened too , but with a coolness in which there was no trace of amazement . Soon afterwards , came a slamming and banging of doors ; and then came running down stairs , a gentleman with whiskers , and out of breath , who seemed to be red - hot . ‘
360571	360576	360569	360569	Alfred	423	’ inquired the lady . ‘
360581	360594	360569	360569	Alfred	423	’ replied the gentleman , as he took his hat from her . ‘
360608	360617	360595	360595	You	0	’ said the lady , moving haughtily away . ‘
360632	360638	360621	360621	you	0	’ added the gentleman politely , ‘
360675	360707	360708	360710	Mr Alfred Lammle	437	’ The three pieces of stick were three broken and frayed fragments of a stout lithe cane . Miss Jenny taking them wonderingly , and the gentleman repeating with a grin , ‘
360725	360747	360774	360774	Lammle	437	’ the lady and gentleman walked away quite deliberately , and Miss Jenny and her crutch - stick went up stairs . ‘
360754	360766	360774	360774	Lammle	437	’ Miss Jenny repeated as she panted from stair to stair , ‘
360785	360799	360774	360774	Lammle	437	’ With a gleam of new intelligence in her sharp face , the dolls ’
360832	360841	360843	360844	Miss Jenny	523	‘ Good gracious ! Is Little Eyes choking ? ’
360930	360934	360936	360937	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ Oh Lord ! ’
360939	360978	360936	360937	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ Oh my eye ! Stop thief ! I am strangling . Fire ! Oh my eye ! A glass of water . Give me a glass of water . Shut the door . Murder ! Oh Lord ! ’
361035	361040	361042	361042	Fledgeby	548	‘ Oh my eye ! ’
361047	361088	361042	361042	Fledgeby	548	‘ It ’s salt and snuff . It ’s up my nose , and down my throat , and in my wind - pipe . Ugh ! Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Ah — h — h — h ! ’

361127	361152	361096	361096	his	548	’ cried Fledgeby , starting , over on his back , in a spasmodic way that caused the dressmaker to retreat to the wall . ‘
361205	361226	361231	361231	he	548	’ Here Mr Fledgeby bounded up , and bounded down , and went rolling over and over again . The dolls ’
361293	361304	361283	361284	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ Oh my eye ! do n’t slap me ! I ’m
361313	361372	361309	361309	I	0	’ However , he gradually ceased to choke and crow , saving at intervals , and Miss Jenny got him into an easy - chair : where , with his eyes red and watery , with his features swollen , and with some half - dozen livid bars across his face , he presented a most rueful sight . ‘
361386	361391	361392	361392	I	0	’ inquired Miss Jenny . ‘
361398	361404	361392	361392	I	0	’ the dismal youth replied . ‘

361483	361494	361437	361437	He	548	’ asked Miss Jenny , showing the pieces of cane . ‘
361500	361513	361514	361514	He	548	’ said Fledgeby , eyeing it with the air of an acquaintance . ‘
361532	361533	361535	361535	he	548	’ ‘
361555	361558	361552	361552	Jenny	523	‘ Oh ! ’
361565	361584	361560	361561	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ she was holding his hat , was she ? I might have known she was in it . ’
361585	361630	361631	361632	Miss Jenny	523	‘ When he came down stairs and joined the lady who would n’t let me come up , he gave me the pieces for you , and I was to say , “ With Mr Alfred Lammle ’s compliments on his leaving England . ” ’

361698	361706	361708	361708	Fledgeby	548	‘ Stop ! No , do n’t ! ’
361710	361739	361708	361708	Fledgeby	548	‘ Do n’t , please . We had better keep it quiet . Will you be so good as shut the door ? Oh I do smart so ! ’
361769	361776	361778	361779	Mr Fledgeby	548	‘ Now the door ’s shut , ’

362345	362349	362342	362343	young man	10661	’ said the dolls ’

363226	363561	363219	363221	the old man	1902	‘ that I will straightway tell you what an impression it wrought upon me . I was hateful in mine own eyes . I was hateful to myself , in being so hateful to the debtor and to you . But more than that , and worse than that , and to pass out far and broad beyond myself — I reflected that evening , sitting alone in my garden on the housetop , that I was doing dishonour to my ancient faith and race . I reflected — clearly reflected for the first time — that in bending my neck to the yoke I was willing to wear , I bent the unwilling necks of the whole Jewish people . For it is not , in Christian countries , with the Jews as with other peoples . Men say , “ This is a bad Greek , but there are good Greeks . This is a bad Turk , but there are good Turks . ” Not so with the Jews . Men find the bad among us easily enough — among what peoples are the bad not easily found?—but they take the worst of us as samples of the best ; they take the lowest of us as presentations of the highest ; and they say “ All Jews are alike . ” If , doing what I was content to do here , because I was grateful for the past and have small need of money now , I had been a Christian , I could have done it , compromising no one but my individual self . But doing it as a Jew , I could not choose but compromise the Jews of all conditions and all countries . It is a little hard upon us , but it is the truth . I would that all our people remembered it ! Though I have little right to say so , seeing that it came home so late to me . ’

364104	364144	364145	364145	Godmother	785	’ This expression of regret being but partially intelligible to Mr Riah , the old man reverted to the injuries Fledgeby had received , and hinted at the necessity of his at once going to tend that beaten cur . ‘

364295	364325	364326	364326	Riah	563	’ They were still debating this point when a shadow darkened the entry , and the glass door was opened by a messenger who brought a letter unceremoniously addressed , ‘
364328	364358	364326	364326	Riah	563	’ To which he said there was an answer wanted . The letter , which was scrawled in pencil uphill and downhill and round crooked corners , ran thus : ‘

364524	364529	364531	364532	Miss Wren	523	‘ Well , godmother , ’

364581	364612	364564	364564	Jenny	523	’ asked Miss Wren . The old man smiled , but looked about him with a look of having lost his way in life , which did not escape the dolls ’
364615	364620	364622	364622	he	1902	‘ Verily , Jenny , ’
364624	364670	364622	364622	he	1902	‘ the question is to the purpose , and more easily asked than answered . But as I have experience of the ready goodwill and good help of those who have given occupation to Lizzie , I think I will seek them out for myself . ’
364671	364675	364677	364678	Miss Wren	523	‘ On foot ? ’
364684	364687	364689	364691	the old man	1902	‘ Ay ! ’
364693	364700	364689	364691	the old man	1902	‘ Have I not my staff ? ’

364737	364771	364772	364774	The old man	1902	‘ for the time being , at all events , is to come home with me , godmother . Nobody ’s there but my bad child , and Lizzie ’s lodging stands empty . ’

It was carried home , and , by reason that the staircase was very narrow , it was put down in the parlour — the little working - bench being set aside to make room for it — and there , in the midst of the dolls with no speculation in their eyes , lay Mr Dolls with no speculation in his . Many flaunting dolls had to be gaily dressed , before the money was in the dressmaker ’s pocket to get mourning for Mr Dolls . As the old man , Riah , sat by , helping her in such small ways as he could , he found it difficult to make out whether she really did realize that the deceased had been her father . ‘

He was taken on the shoulders of half a dozen blossom - faced men , who shuffled with him to the churchyard , and who were preceded by another blossom - faced man , affecting a stately stalk , as if he were a Policeman of the D(eath ) Division , and ceremoniously pretending not to know his intimate acquaintances , as he led the pageant . Yet , the spectacle of only one little mourner hobbling after , caused many people to turn their heads with a look of interest . At last the troublesome deceased was got into the ground , to be buried no more , and the stately stalker stalked back before the solitary dressmaker , as if she were bound in honour to have no notion of the way home . Those Furies , the conventionalities , being thus appeased , he left her . ‘

367761	367770	367741	367743	a doll clergyman	7827	’ said Miss Jenny , shaking her forefinger , ‘
367800	367918	367797	367798	Jack Robinson	788	’ With her expert little ways in sharp action , she had got a doll into whitey - brown paper orders , before the meal was over , and was displaying it for the edification of the Jewish mind , when a knock was heard at the street - door . Riah went to open it , and presently came back , ushering in , with the grave and courteous air that sat so well upon him , a gentleman . The gentleman was a stranger to the dressmaker ; but even in the moment of his casting his eyes upon her , there was something in his manner which brought to her remembrance Mr Eugene Wrayburn . ‘
367922	367927	367797	367798	Jack Robinson	788	’ said the gentleman . ‘

368081	368095	368075	368077	Mr Eugene Wrayburn	269	’ The dressmaker clasped her hands , and uttered a little piteous cry . ‘
368099	368106	368075	368077	Mr Eugene Wrayburn	269	’ repeated Lightwood , with emotion , ‘
368203	368226	368198	368198	he	269	’ The dressmaker , with her hands still clasped , looked affrightedly from the one to the other of her two companions . ‘

368325	368613	368614	368614	they	7841	’ DRESSMAKER DISCOVERS A WORD A darkened and hushed room ; the river outside the windows flowing on to the vast ocean ; a figure on the bed , swathed and bandaged and bound , lying helpless on its back , with its two useless arms in splints at its sides . Only two days of usage so familiarized the little dressmaker with this scene , that it held the place occupied two days ago by the recollections of years . He had scarcely moved since her arrival . Sometimes his eyes were open , sometimes closed . When they were open , there was no meaning in their unwinking stare at one spot straight before them , unless for a moment the brow knitted into a faint expression of anger , or surprise . Then , Mortimer Lightwood would speak to him , and on occasions he would be so far roused as to make an attempt to pronounce his friend ’s name . But , in an instant consciousness was gone again , and no spirit of Eugene was in Eugene ’s crushed outer form . They provided Jenny with materials for plying her work , and she had a little table placed at the foot of his bed . Sitting there , with her rich shower of hair falling over the chair - back , they hoped she might attract his notice . With the same object , she would sing , just above her breath , when he opened his eyes , or she saw his brow knit into that faint expression , so evanescent that it was like a shape made in water . But as yet he had not heeded . The ‘
368615	368669	368683	368683	Mortimer	287	’ here mentioned were the medical attendant ; Lizzie , who was there in all her intervals of rest ; and Lightwood , who never left him . The two days became three , and the three days became four . At length , quite unexpectedly , he said something in a whisper . ‘
368678	368679	368676	368676	Eugene	269	’ ‘

368766	368776	368757	368757	Eugene	269	‘ but I am very glad to see you . ’
368811	368821	368808	368808	he	287	‘ Ask her if she has seen the children . ’
368837	368847	368834	368834	he	287	‘ Ask her if she has smelt the flowers . ’
368848	368854	368856	368856	Jenny	523	‘ Oh ! I know ! ’

368934	368960	368877	368877	she	4394	‘ I have not seen them since I saw you . I never see them now , but I am hardly ever in pain now . ’

369126	369165	369166	369166	Mortimer	287	‘ To prevent my wandering away I do n’t know where — for I begin to be sensible that I have just come back , and that I shall lose myself again — do so , dear boy ! ’
369205	369254	369202	369202	he	287	‘ Do n’t tell me not to speak , for I must speak . If you knew the harassing anxiety that gnaws and wears me when I am wandering in those places — where are those endless places , Mortimer ? They must be at an immense distance ! ’
369275	369291	369269	369269	he	269	‘ Do n’t be afraid — I am not gone yet . What was it ? ’
369292	369358	369269	369269	he	269	‘ You wanted to tell me something , Eugene . My poor dear fellow , you wanted to say something to your old friend — to the friend who has always loved you , admired you , imitated you , founded himself upon you , been nothing without you , and who , God knows , would be here in your place if he could ! ’

369476	369545	369372	369373	the other	8572	‘ Her innocent reputation would be ruined , my friend . She would be punished , not he .

Do n’t think of avenging me ; think only of hushing the story and protecting her . You can confuse the case , and turn aside the circumstances . Listen to what I say to you . It was not the schoolmaster , Bradley Headstone . Do you hear me ? Twice ; it was not the schoolmaster , Bradley Headstone . Do you hear me ? Three times ; it was not the schoolmaster , Bradley Headstone . ’

369937	370481	369935	369936	The dolls	3346	’ dressmaker , all softened compassion now , watched him with an earnestness that never relaxed . She would regularly change the ice , or the cooling spirit , on his head , and would keep her ear at the pillow betweenwhiles , listening for any faint words that fell from him in his wanderings . It was amazing through how many hours at a time she would remain beside him , in a crouching attitude , attentive to his slightest moan . As he could not move a hand , he could make no sign of distress ; but , through this close watching ( if through no secret sympathy or power ) the little creature attained an understanding of him that Lightwood did not possess . Mortimer would often turn to her , as if she were an interpreter between this sentient world and the insensible man ; and she would change the dressing of a wound , or ease a ligature , or turn his face , or alter the pressure of the bedclothes on him , with an absolute certainty of doing right . The natural lightness and delicacy of touch which had become very refined by practice in her miniature work , no doubt was involved in this ; but her perception was at least as fine . The one word , Lizzie , he muttered millions of times . In a certain phase of his distressful state , which was the worst to those who tended him , he would roll his head upon the pillow , incessantly repeating the name in a hurried and impatient manner , with the misery of a disturbed mind , and the monotony of a machine . Equally , when he lay still and staring , he would repeat it for hours without cessation , but then , always in a tone of subdued warning and horror . Her presence and her touch upon his breast or face would often stop this , and then they learned to expect that he would for some time remain still , with his eyes closed , and that he would be conscious on opening them . But , the heavy disappointment of their hope — revived by the welcome silence of the room — was , that his spirit would glide away again and be lost , in the moment of their joy that it was there . This frequent rising of a drowning man from the deep , to sink again , was dreadful to the beholders . But , gradually the change stole upon him that it became dreadful to himself . His desire to impart something that was on his mind , his unspeakable yearning to have speech with his friend and make a communication to him , so troubled him when he recovered consciousness , that its term was thereby shortened . As the man rising from the deep would disappear the sooner for fighting with the water , so he in his desperate struggle went down again . One afternoon when he had been lying still , and Lizzie , unrecognized , had just stolen out of the room to pursue her occupation , he uttered Lightwood ’s name . ‘

373574	374051	373571	373572	Mr Lightwood	287	’ They started directly , in a little carriage that Lightwood had brought with him from never - to - be - forgotten Greenwich ; and from Greenwich they started directly for London ; and in London they waited at a railway station until such time as the Reverend Frank Milvey , and Margaretta his wife , with whom Mortimer Lightwood had been already in conference , should come and join them . That worthy couple were delayed by a portentous old parishioner of the female gender , who was one of the plagues of their lives , and with whom they bore with most exemplary sweetness and good - humour , notwithstanding her having an infection of absurdity about her , that communicated itself to everything with which , and everybody with whom , she came in contact . She was a member of the Reverend Frank ’s congregation , and made a point of distinguishing herself in that body , by conspicuously weeping at everything , however cheering , said by the Reverend Frank in his public ministration ; also by applying to herself the various lamentations of David , and complaining in a personally injured manner ( much in arrear of the clerk and the rest of the respondents ) that her enemies were digging pit - falls about her , and breaking her with rods of iron . Indeed , this old widow discharged herself of that portion of the Morning and Evening Service as if she were lodging a complaint on oath and applying for a warrant before a magistrate . But this was not her most inconvenient characteristic , for that took the form of an impression , usually recurring in inclement weather and at about daybreak , that she had something on her mind and stood in immediate need of the Reverend Frank to come and take it off . Many a time had that kind creature got up , and gone out to Mrs Sprodgkin ( such was the disciple ’s name ) , suppressing a strong sense of her comicality by his strong sense of duty , and perfectly knowing that nothing but a cold would come of it . However , beyond themselves , the Reverend Frank Milvey and Mrs Milvey seldom hinted that Mrs Sprodgkin was hardly worth the trouble she gave ; but both made the best of her , as they did of all their troubles . This very exacting member of the fold appeared to be endowed with a sixth sense , in regard of knowing when the Reverend Frank Milvey least desired her company , and with promptitude appearing in his little hall . Consequently , when the Reverend Frank had willingly engaged that he and his wife would accompany Lightwood back , he said , as a matter of course : ‘
374075	374088	374072	374073	Mrs Sprodgkin	790	’ To which Mrs Milvey replied , in her pleasantly emphatic way , ‘
374106	374222	374225	374225	Sally	792	’ Words that were scarcely uttered when their theme was announced as in faithful attendance below , desiring counsel on a spiritual matter . The points on which Mrs Sprodgkin sought elucidation being seldom of a pressing nature ( as Who begat Whom , or some information concerning the Amorites ) , Mrs Milvey on this special occasion resorted to the device of buying her off with a present of tea and sugar , and a loaf and butter . These gifts Mrs Sprodgkin accepted , but still insisted on dutifully remaining in the hall , to curtsey to the Reverend Frank as he came forth . Who , incautiously saying in his genial manner , ‘
374231	374361	374225	374225	Sally	792	’ involved himself in a discursive address from Mrs Sprodgkin , revolving around the result that she regarded tea and sugar in the light of myrrh and frankincense , and considered bread and butter identical with locusts and wild honey . Having communicated this edifying piece of information , Mrs Sprodgkin was left still unadjourned in the hall , and Mr and Mrs Milvey hurried in a heated condition to the railway station . All of which is here recorded to the honour of that good Christian pair , representatives of hundreds of other good Christian pairs as conscientious and as useful , who merge the smallness of their work in its greatness , and feel in no danger of losing dignity when they adapt themselves to incomprehensible humbugs . ‘
374376	374411	374427	374427	Frank	412	’ was the Reverend Frank ’s apology to Lightwood , taking no thought of himself . To which Mrs Milvey added , taking thought for him , like the championing little wife she was ; ‘
374452	374494	374497	374498	Mr Rokesmith	315	’ Bella felt conscious , in spite of her late pledge for herself , that her husband ’s absence would give disagreeable occasion for surprise to the Milveys . Nor could she appear quite at her ease when Mrs Milvey asked : ‘
374513	374579	374509	374509	he	7898	’ It becoming necessary , upon this , to send him to bed again and hold him in waiting to be lanced again , Bella did it . But not half as well on the second occasion as on the first ; for , a twice - told white one seems almost to become a black one , when you are not used to it . ‘
374583	374588	374509	374509	he	7898	’ said Mrs Milvey , ‘
374640	374669	374670	374670	I	0	’ By way of making the white one whiter , Bella hastened to stipulate that he was not in pain . Mrs Milvey was SO glad of it . ‘

374814	374991	374811	374811	him	3176	’ The reference was to a young man of reserved appearance , in a coat and waistcoat of black , and pantaloons of pepper and salt . He had come into the office of the station , from its interior , in an unsettled way , immediately after Lightwood had gone out to the train ; and he had been hurriedly reading the printed bills and notices on the wall . He had had a wandering interest in what was said among the people waiting there and passing to and fro . He had drawn nearer , at about the time when Mrs Milvey mentioned Lizzie Hexam , and had remained near , since : though always glancing towards the door by which Lightwood had gone out . He stood with his back towards them , and his gloved hands clasped behind him . There was now so evident a faltering upon him , expressive of indecision whether or no he should express his having heard himself referred to , that Mr Milvey spoke to him . ‘
374999	375003	374811	374811	him	3176	’ he said , ‘

375288	375325	375285	375286	Lizzie Hexam	246	’ He seemed to be a shy man , struggling against nervousness , and spoke in a very constrained way . The break he set between his last two sentences was quite embarrassing to his hearer . ‘
375328	375333	375285	375286	Lizzie Hexam	246	’ replied Mr Milvey . ‘
375342	375343	375344	375344	I	0	’ ‘
375387	375415	375416	375416	I	0	’ Mr Milvey thought this a man with a very odd manner , and a dark downward look ; but he answered in his usual open way . ‘
375452	375453	375440	375440	You	8755	’ ‘
375483	375503	375481	375481	sir	8755	’ A man with a very odd manner indeed , and with a lurking look that was quite oppressive . ‘
375509	375514	375516	375516	you	8755	’ said Mr Milvey , ‘
375543	375549	375535	375535	I	0	’ The schoolmaster started back . ‘
375557	375566	375555	375555	myself	0	’ said Mr Milvey , with a smile , ‘
375583	375611	375612	375612	You	0	’ Bradley Headstone caught hold of a pillar behind him . If Mr Milvey knew an ashy face when he saw it , he saw it then . ‘
375620	375621	375617	375618	Mr Headstone	517	’ ‘
375678	375752	375755	375769	a person outside who seems to be really ill , and to require some help	7934	’ As Mr Milvey , who had no more minutes to spare , made a suitable reply and turned back into the office , he observed the schoolmaster to lean against the pillar with his hat in his hand , and to pull at his neckcloth as if he were trying to tear it off . The Reverend Frank accordingly directed the notice of one of the attendants to him , by saying : ‘
375778	375830	375772	375772	he	7934	’ Lightwood had by this time secured their places , and the departure - bell was about to be rung . They took their seats , and were beginning to move out of the station , when the same attendant came running along the platform , looking into all the carriages . ‘
375839	375863	375833	375833	You	7935	’ he said , springing on the step , and holding the window - frame by his elbow , as the carriage moved . ‘
375876	375877	375878	375878	I	0	’ ‘
375907	376280	375893	375893	He	7937	’ He was took very bad to be sure , and was biting and knocking about him ( the man said ) furiously . Would the gentleman give him his card , as he had seen him first ? The gentleman did so , with the explanation that he knew no more of the man attacked than that he was a man of a very respectable occupation , who had said he was out of health , as his appearance would of itself have indicated . The attendant received the card , watched his opportunity for sliding down , slid down , and so it ended . Then , the train rattled among the house - tops , and among the ragged sides of houses torn down to make way for it , and over the swarming streets , and under the fruitful earth , until it shot across the river : bursting over the quiet surface like a bomb - shell , and gone again as if it had exploded in the rush of smoke and steam and glare . A little more , and again it roared across the river , a great rocket : spurning the watery turnings and doublings with ineffable contempt , and going straight to its end , as Father Time goes to his . To whom it is no matter what living waters run high or low , reflect the heavenly lights and darknesses , produce their little growth of weeds and flowers , turn here , turn there , are noisy or still , are troubled or at rest , for their course has one sure termination , though their sources and devices are many . Then , a carriage ride succeeded , near the solemn river , stealing away by night , as all things steal away , by night and by day , so quietly yielding to the attraction of the loadstone rock of Eternity ; and the nearer they drew to the chamber where Eugene lay , the more they feared that they might find his wanderings done . At last they saw its dim light shining out , and it gave them hope : though Lightwood faltered as he thought : ‘
376294	376501	376286	376286	she	7939	’ But he lay quiet , half in stupor , half in sleep . Bella , entering with a raised admonitory finger , kissed Lizzie softly , but said not a word . Neither did any of them speak , but all sat down at the foot of the bed , silently waiting . And now , in this night - watch , mingling with the flow of the river and with the rush of the train , came the questions into Bella ’s mind again : What could be in the depths of that mystery of John ’s ? Why was it that he had never been seen by Mr Lightwood , whom he still avoided ? When would that trial come , through which her faith in , and her duty to , her dear husband , was to carry her , rendering him triumphant ? For , that had been his term . Her passing through the trial was to make the man she loved with all her heart , triumphant . Term not to sink out of sight in Bella ’s breast . Far on in the night , Eugene opened his eyes . He was sensible , and said at once : ‘
376514	376525	376528	376528	Eugene	269	’ Lightwood was there immediately , to answer for himself . ‘
376535	376536	376528	376528	Eugene	269	’ ‘
376540	376547	376528	376528	Eugene	269	’ returned Eugene with a smile , ‘
376573	376574	376570	376570	I	0	’ ‘
376580	376585	376570	376570	I	0	’ said Mr Milvey . ‘
376597	376598	376594	376595	Mr Wrayburn	269	’ ‘
376604	376608	376599	376599	I	0	’ said Eugene . ‘
376616	376709	376713	376713	her	7944	’ Eugene turned his eyes towards Lizzie , as if to spare her , and answered nothing . Then , they all stood around the bed , and Mr Milvey , opening his book , began the service ; so rarely associated with the shadow of death ; so inseparable in the mind from a flush of life and gaiety and hope and health and joy . Bella thought how different from her own sunny little wedding , and wept . Mrs Milvey overflowed with pity , and wept too . The dolls ’
376832	376841	376843	376843	Eugene	269	‘ Undraw the curtains , my dear girl , ’
376849	376859	376843	376843	Eugene	269	‘ and let us see our wedding - day . ’
376886	376892	376894	376894	Eugene	269	‘ I bless the day ! ’
376896	376902	376904	376904	Lizzie	246	‘ I bless the day ! ’
376906	376920	376922	376922	Eugene	269	‘ You have made a poor marriage of it , my sweet wife , ’
376924	376949	376922	376922	Eugene	269	‘ A shattered graceless fellow , stretched at his length here , and next to nothing for you when you are a young widow . ’
376950	376970	376971	376971	she	246	‘ I have made the marriage that I would have given all the world to dare to hope for , ’
376974	376981	376983	376983	Eugene	269	‘ You have thrown yourself away , ’
376989	377015	376983	376983	Eugene	269	‘ But you have followed the treasure of your heart . My justification is , that you had thrown that away first , dear girl ! ’
377016	377026	377056	377056	she	246	‘ No . I had given it to you . ’
377027	377036	376983	376983	Eugene	269	‘ The same thing , my poor Lizzie ! ’
377037	377047	376983	376983	Eugene	269	‘ Hush ! hush ! A very different thing . ’
377063	377066	377068	377068	Eugene	269	‘ No , ’
377075	377096	377068	377068	Eugene	269	‘ let me look at you , Lizzie , while I can . You brave devoted girl ! You heroine ! ’
377133	377136	377138	377138	Eugene	269	‘ Lizzie , ’
377144	377176	377138	377138	Eugene	269	‘ when you see me wandering away from this refuge that I have so ill deserved , speak to me by my name , and I think I shall come back . ’
377177	377183	377219	377219	she	246	‘ Yes , dear Eugene . ’
377184	377187	377188	377188	he	269	‘ There ! ’
377193	377204	377188	377188	he	269	‘ I should have gone then , but for that ! ’
377228	377235	377219	377219	she	246	‘ Eugene , my dear husband ! ’
377240	377252	377236	377236	He	269	‘ There again ! You see how you can recall me ! ’
377326	377333	377334	377334	he	269	‘ Ah , my beloved Lizzie ! ’
377339	377354	377334	377334	he	269	‘ How shall I ever pay all I owe you , if I recover ! ’
377355	377363	377364	377364	she	246	‘ Do n’t be ashamed of me , ’
377367	377377	377364	377364	she	246	‘ and you will have more than paid all . ’
377378	377396	377334	377334	he	269	‘ It would require a life , Lizzie , to pay all ; more than a life . ’
377397	377428	377334	377334	he	269	‘ Live for that , then ; live for me , Eugene ; live to see how hard I will try to improve myself , and never to discredit you . ’
377429	377434	377435	377435	he	269	‘ My darling girl , ’
377452	377475	377435	377435	he	269	‘ On the contrary , I have been thinking whether it is not the best thing I can do , to die . ’
377476	377492	377334	377334	he	269	‘ The best thing you can do , to leave me with a broken heart ? ’
377493	377553	377334	377334	he	269	‘ I do n’t mean that , my dear girl . I was not thinking of that . What I was thinking of was this . Out of your compassion for me , in this maimed and broken state , you make so much of me — you think so well of me — you love me so dearly . ’
377554	377562	377334	377334	he	269	‘ Heaven knows I love you dearly ! ’
377563	377583	377334	377334	he	269	‘ And Heaven knows I prize it ! Well . If I live , you ’ll find me out . ’
377584	377609	377334	377334	he	269	‘ I shall find out that my husband has a mine of purpose and energy , and will turn it to the best account ? ’
377610	377618	377620	377620	Eugene	269	‘ I hope so , dearest Lizzie , ’
377629	377709	377620	377620	Eugene	269	‘ I hope so . But I ca n’t summon the vanity to think so . How can I think so , looking back on such a trifling wasted youth as mine ! I humbly hope it ; but I dare n’t believe it . There is a sharp misgiving in my conscience that if I were to live , I should disappoint your good opinion and my own — and that I ought to die , my dear ! ’
377776	377789	377772	377774	Mr John Rokesmith	315	‘ Would you not like to be rich NOW , my darling ? ’
377790	377808	377772	377774	Mr John Rokesmith	315	‘ How can you ask me such a question , John dear ? Am I not rich ? ’
378157	378164	378165	378165	she	307	‘ You know , John dear , ’
378175	378235	378165	378165	she	307	‘ that I hope I may safely be trusted in great things . And it surely can not be a little thing that causes you so much uneasiness . It ’s very considerate of you to try to hide from me that you are uncomfortable about something , but it ’s quite impossible to be done , John love . ’
378236	378248	378165	378165	she	307	‘ I admit that I am rather uneasy , my own . ’
378249	378260	378274	378274	Bella	307	‘ Then please to tell me what about , sir . ’
378268	378272	378274	378274	Bella	307	‘ Never mind ! ’
378278	378296	378274	378274	Bella	307	‘ John requires me to put perfect faith in him , and he shall not be disappointed . ’
378454	378460	378463	378463	she	307	‘ a very rainbow for colours ’
378563	378574	378559	378559	John	315	‘ No jewels for your own wear , for instance ? ’
378652	378661	378662	378662	he	287	‘ Mr Lightwood and I have met before , ’
378665	378671	378672	378672	Bella	307	‘ Met before , John ? ’
378680	378691	378672	378672	Bella	307	‘ Mr Lightwood told me he had never seen you . ’
378692	378702	378704	378704	Lightwood	287	‘ I did not then know that I had , ’
378711	378724	378704	378704	Lightwood	287	‘ I believed that I had only heard of — Mr Rokesmith . ’
378732	378742	378744	378745	her husband	8651	‘ When Mr Lightwood saw me , my love , ’
378757	378764	378744	378745	her husband	8651	‘ my name was Julius Handford . ’
378814	378825	378827	378827	Lightwood	287	‘ I would have avoided mentioning it in your presence , ’
378833	378874	378827	378827	Lightwood	287	‘ but since your husband mentions it himself , I must confirm his strange admission . I saw him as Mr Julius Handford , and I afterwards ( unquestionably to his knowledge ) took great pains to trace him out . ’
378875	378889	378891	378891	Rokesmith	315	‘ Quite true . But it was not my object or my interest , ’
378895	378901	378891	378891	Rokesmith	315	‘ to be traced out . ’
378914	378918	378902	378902	Bella	307	‘ Mr Lightwood , ’
378923	378993	378902	378902	Bella	307	‘ as chance has brought us face to face at last — which is not to be wondered at , for the wonder is , that , in spite of all my pains to the contrary , chance has not confronted us together sooner — I have only to remind you that you have been at my house , and to add that I have not changed my residence . ’
378994	378996	378998	378998	Lightwood	287	‘ Sir ’
379007	379049	378998	378998	Lightwood	287	‘ my position is a truly painful one . I hope that no complicity in a very dark transaction may attach to you , but you can not fail to know that your own extraordinary conduct has laid you under suspicion . ’
379050	379056	378902	378902	Bella	307	‘ I know it has , ’
379062	379067	379069	379069	Lightwood	287	‘ My professional duty , ’
379078	379116	379117	379117	Bella	307	‘ is greatly at variance with my personal inclination ; but I doubt , Mr Handford , or Mr Rokesmith , whether I am justified in taking leave of you here , with your whole course unexplained . ’
379125	379154	379156	379156	Rokesmith	315	‘ Do n’t be alarmed , my darling . Mr Lightwood will find that he is quite justified in taking leave of me here . At all events , ’
379158	379172	379156	379156	Rokesmith	315	‘ he will find that I mean to take leave of him here . ’
379173	379179	379181	379181	Lightwood	287	‘ I think , sir , ’
379183	379212	379181	379181	Lightwood	287	‘ you can scarcely deny that when I came to your house on the occasion to which you have referred , you avoided me of a set purpose . ’
379213	379294	379295	379295	Lightwood	287	‘ Mr Lightwood , I assure you I have no disposition to deny it , or intention to deny it . I should have continued to avoid you , in pursuance of the same set purpose , for a short time longer , if we had not met now . I am going straight home , and shall remain at home to - morrow until noon . Hereafter , I hope we may be better acquainted . Good - day . ’
379352	379369	379339	379340	John Rokesmith	315	‘ And you do n’t ask me , my dear , why I bore that name ? ’
379370	379386	379389	379389	her	8645	‘ No , John love . I should dearly like to know , of course ; ’
379394	379431	379389	379389	her	8645	‘ but I wait until you can tell me of your own free will . You asked me if I could have perfect faith in you , and I said yes , and I meant it . ’
379473	379500	379463	379463	she	307	‘ You can not have been prepared , my dearest , for such a discovery as that this mysterious Mr Handford was identical with your husband ? ’
379501	379526	379527	379527	He	8011	‘ No , John dear , of course not . But you told me to prepare to be tried , and I prepared myself . ’
379552	379556	379557	379557	he	8011	‘ And now , ’
379561	379599	379557	379557	he	8011	‘ lay stress , my dear , on these words that I am going to add . I stand in no kind of peril , and I can by possibility be hurt at no one ’s hand . ’
379600	379613	379557	379557	he	8011	‘ You are quite , quite sure of that , John dear ? ’
379614	379641	379557	379557	he	8011	‘ Not a hair of my head ! Moreover , I have done no wrong , and have injured no man . Shall I swear it ? ’
379642	379647	379649	379649	Bella	307	‘ No , John ! ’
379663	379668	379652	379652	her	307	‘ Never to me ! ’
379669	379673	379674	379674	he	8011	‘ But circumstances , ’
379677	379714	379674	379674	he	8011	‘ — I can , and I will , disperse them in a moment — have surrounded me with one of the strangest suspicions ever known . You heard Mr Lightwood speak of a dark transaction ? ’
379715	379720	379652	379652	her	307	‘ Yes , John . ’
379721	379732	379652	379652	her	307	‘ You are prepared to hear explicitly what he meant ? ’
379733	379738	379674	379674	he	8011	‘ Yes , John . ’
379739	379755	379652	379652	her	307	‘ My life , he meant the murder of John Harmon , your allotted husband . ’
379769	379778	379762	379762	Bella	307	‘ You can not be suspected , John ? ’
379779	379791	379674	379674	he	8011	‘ Dear love , I can be — for I am ! ’
379818	379823	379824	379824	she	307	‘ How dare they ! ’
379836	379845	379846	379846	He	8011	‘ My beloved husband , how dare they ! ’
379864	379876	379846	379846	He	8011	‘ Even knowing this , you can trust me , Bella ? ’

380266	380274	380276	380277	Mr Inspector	288	‘ You favoured me , Mr Handford , ’
380279	380367	380276	380277	Mr Inspector	288	‘ by writing down your name and address , and I produce the piece of paper on which you wrote it . Comparing the same with the writing on the fly - leaf of this book on the table — and a sweet pretty volume it is — I find the writing of the entry , “ Mrs John Rokesmith . From her husband on her birthday”—and very gratifying to the feelings such memorials are — to correspond exactly . Can I have a word with you ? ’

380542	380560	380539	380540	her husband	8651	‘ is satisfied that she can have no reason for being alarmed , whatever the business is . ’
380561	380568	380570	380571	Mr Inspector	288	‘ Really ? Is that so ? ’
380573	380715	380570	380571	Mr Inspector	288	‘ But it ’s a sex to live and learn from , and there ’s nothing a lady ca n’t accomplish when she once fully gives her mind to it . It ’s the case with my own wife . Well , ma’am , this good gentleman of yours has given rise to a rather large amount of trouble which might have been avoided if he had come forward and explained himself . Well you see ! He DIDN’T come forward and explain himself . Consequently , now that we meet , him and me , you ’ll say — and say right — that there ’s nothing to be alarmed at , in my proposing to him TO come forward — or , putting the same meaning in another form , to come along with me — and explain himself . ’
380726	380733	380740	380740	his	288	‘ to come along with me , ’
380752	380762	380764	380765	John Rokesmith	315	‘ Do you propose to take me into custody ? ’

380785	380801	380776	380777	Mr Inspector	288	‘ ai n’t it enough that I propose that you shall come along with me ? ’
380802	380807	380764	380765	John Rokesmith	315	‘ For what reason ? ’
380808	380816	380818	380819	Mr Inspector	288	‘ Lord bless my soul and body ! ’
380821	380836	380818	380819	Mr Inspector	288	‘ I wonder at it in a man of your education . Why argue ? ’
380837	380845	380764	380765	John Rokesmith	315	‘ What do you charge against me ? ’
380846	380855	380857	380858	Mr Inspector	288	‘ I wonder at you before a lady , ’
380865	380933	380861	380861	his	288	‘ I wonder , brought up as you have been , you have n’t a more delicate mind ! I charge you , then , with being some way concerned in the Harmon Murder . I do n’t say whether before , or in , or after , the fact . I do n’t say whether with having some knowledge of it that has n’t come out . ’
380934	380948	380764	380765	John Rokesmith	315	‘ You do n’t surprise me . I foresaw your visit this afternoon . ’

381005	381025	381002	381003	Mr Inspector	288	‘ Now , having received the caution , do you still say that you foresaw my visit this afternoon ? ’
381026	381047	380764	380765	John Rokesmith	315	‘ Yes . And I will say something more , if you will step with me into the next room . ’

381666	381676	381678	381678	Bella	307	‘ We are not going in here , John ? ’
381684	381707	381678	381678	Bella	307	‘ Yes , my dear ; but of our own accord . We shall come out again as easily , never fear . ’
381896	381904	381888	381888	He	288	‘ Nothing could be better , for they ’re
381914	382022	381888	381888	He	288	’ and then they all three went out together . Still , as in a dream , Bella found herself entering a snug old - fashioned public - house , and found herself smuggled into a little three - cornered room nearly opposite the bar of that establishment . Mr Inspector achieved the smuggling of herself and John into this queer room , called Cosy in an inscription on the door , by entering in the narrow passage first in order , and suddenly turning round upon them with extended arms , as if they had been two sheep . The room was lighted for their reception . ‘
382025	382037	381888	381888	He	288	’ said Mr Inspector to John , turning the gas lower ; ‘

382165	382174	382162	382163	Miss Abbey	369	‘ What have you got in hand now ? ’
382175	382188	382190	382191	Mr Inspector	288	‘ Thanking you for your compliment : not much , Miss Abbey , ’
382195	382203	382205	382206	Miss Abbey	369	‘ Who have you got in Cosy ? ’
382208	382217	382205	382206	Miss Abbey	369	‘ Only a gentleman and his wife , Miss. ’
382218	382243	382245	382246	Miss Abbey	369	‘ And who are they ? If one may ask it without detriment to your deep plans in the interests of the honest public ? ’
382257	382290	382245	382246	Miss Abbey	369	‘ They are strangers in this part of the town , Miss Abbey . They are waiting till I shall want the gentleman to show himself somewhere , for half a moment . ’
382291	382294	382245	382246	Miss Abbey	369	‘ While they ’re

382479	382484	382421	382421	I	0	’ cried Mr Inspector . ‘

382784	382789	382777	382777	YOU	294	’ returned Miss Abbey , ‘

382959	382982	382984	382985	Mr Inspector	288	‘ And talk of Time slipping by you , as if it was an animal at rustic sports with its tail soaped , ’
382997	383049	382984	382985	Mr Inspector	288	‘ why , well you may . Well you may . How has it slipped by us , since the time when Mr Job Potterson here present , Mr Jacob Kibble here present , and an Officer of the Force here present , first came together on a matter of Identification ! ’
383068	383076	383077	383078	Mr Inspector	288	‘ How has Time slipped by us , ’

383571	383579	383581	383581	John	315	‘ I am afraid , my life , ’

383609	383617	383619	383619	John	315	‘ The reason why I said afraid , ’
383621	383629	383619	383619	John	315	‘ is , because we must move . ’
383630	383634	383528	383530	The inexhaustible baby	7977	‘ O John ! ’
383635	383681	383528	383530	The inexhaustible baby	7977	‘ Yes , my dear , we must move . We must have our head - quarters in London now . In short , there ’s a dwelling - house rent - free , attached to my new position , and we must occupy it . ’

386118	386123	386128	386128	John	273	’ cried Mrs Boffin . ‘
386164	386183	386152	386152	we	8154	’ Mr Boffin hitched up a chair , and added his broad brown right hand to the heap . ‘
386188	386198	386152	386152	we	8154	’ said Mrs Boffin , giving it a kiss . ‘
386231	386368	386230	386230	you	273	’re John ! ” John catches of me , it is true ; but I ai n’t a light weight , bless ye , and he ’s forced to let me down . Noddy , he hears a noise , and in he trots , and as soon as I anyways comes to myself I calls to him , “ Noddy , well I might say as I did say , that night at the Bower , for the Lord be thankful this is John ! ” On which he gives a heave , and down he goes likewise , with his head under the writing - table . This brings me round comfortable , and that brings him round comfortable , and then John and him and me we all fall a crying for joy . ’
386369	386380	386381	386382	her husband	8651	‘ Yes ! They cry for joy , my darling , ’
386386	386407	386411	386411	him	8651	‘ You understand ? These two , whom I come to life to disappoint and dispossess , cry for joy ! ’
386424	386438	386440	386441	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ That ’s right , my dear , do n’t you mind him , ’
386443	386586	386440	386441	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ stick to me . Well ! Then we sits down , gradually gets cool , and holds a confabulation . John , he tells us how he is despairing in his mind on accounts of a certain fair young person , and how , if I had n’t found him out , he was going away to seek his fortune far and wide , and had fully meant never to come to life , but to leave the property as our wrongful inheritance for ever and a day . At which you never see a man so frightened as my Noddy was . For to think that he should have come into the property wrongful , however innocent , and — more than that — might have gone on keeping it to his dying day , turned him whiter than chalk . ’
386587	386592	386594	386595	Mr Boffin	324	‘ And you too , ’
386597	386609	386611	386612	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Do n’t you mind him , neither , my deary , ’
386614	386695	386611	386612	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ stick to me . This brings up a confabulation regarding the certain fair young person ; when Noddy he gives it as his opinion that she is a deary creetur . “ She may be a leetle spoilt , and nat’rally spoilt , ” he says , “ by circumstances , but that ’s only the surface , and I lay my life , ” he says , “ that she ’s the true golden gold at heart . ” ’
386696	386701	386703	386704	Mr Boffin	324	‘ So did you , ’
386706	386719	386703	386704	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Do n’t you mind him a single morsel , my dear , ’
386724	386760	386721	386722	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ but stick to me . Then says John , O , if he could but prove so ! Then we both of us ups and says , that minute , “ Prove so ! ” ’
386804	386815	386817	386818	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ “ Prove it , John ! ” we says , ’
386820	386976	386817	386818	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ “ Prove it and overcome your doubts with triumph , and be happy for the first time in your life , and for the rest of your life . ” This puts John in a state , to be sure . Then we says , “ What will content you ? If she was to stand up for you when you was slighted , if she was to show herself of a generous mind when you was oppressed , if she was to be truest to you when you was poorest and friendliest , and all this against her own seeming interest , how would that do ? ” “ Do ? ” says John , “ it would raise me to the skies . ” “ Then , ” says my Noddy , “ make your preparations for the ascent , John , it being my firm belief that up you go ! ” ’
387006	387021	387023	387024	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ From the first , you was always a special favourite of Noddy ’s , ’
387030	387068	387027	387027	her	307	‘ O you were ! And if I had been inclined to be jealous , I do n’t know what I might n’t have done to you . But as I wasn’t — why , my beauty , ’
387077	387114	387156	387156	he	8581	‘ I made you a special favourite of my own too . But the horses is coming round the corner . Well ! Then says my Noddy , shaking his sides till he was fit to make ’em
387159	387170	387156	387156	he	8581	’ cried Mrs Boffin , in an ecstacy of admiration . ‘
387189	387200	387181	387181	he	8581	’ Bella looked half frightened , and yet half laughed . ‘
387206	387211	387204	387204	you	273	’ pursued Mrs Boffin , ‘
387371	387405	387344	387344	he	8581	’ Mr Boffin , with his face bent over his heavy hand , made no sound , but rolled his shoulders when thus referred to , as if he were vastly enjoying himself . ‘
387414	387419	387420	387420	you	0	’ pursued Mrs Boffin , ‘
387718	387755	387713	387713	God	486	’ The pile of hands dispersed , and Bella and Mrs Boffin took a good long hug of one another : to the apparent peril of the inexhaustible baby , lying staring in Bella ’s lap . ‘
387762	387768	387713	387713	God	486	’ said Bella , pondering . ‘
387776	387777	387713	387713	God	486	’ ‘
387788	387797	387713	387713	God	486	’ returned Mrs Boffin , full of glee . ‘
387809	387813	387799	387799	you	8167	’ asked Bella . ‘
387821	387828	387829	387829	John	273	’ said Mrs Boffin , archly . ‘
387832	387836	387837	387837	you	273	’ said Bella , ‘
387838	387849	387829	387829	John	273	’re a good nurse ; will you please hold baby ? ’
387911	387979	387981	387981	Bella	307	‘ Please I beg your pardon , and I made a small mistake of a word when I took leave of you last . Please I think you are better ( not worse ) than Hopkins , better ( not worse ) than Dancer , better ( not worse ) than Blackberry Jones , better ( not worse ) than any of them ! Please something more ! ’
388004	388044	387989	387989	she	307	‘ Please I have found out something not yet mentioned . Please I do n’t believe you are a hard - hearted miser at all , and please I do n’t believe you ever for one single minute were ! ’
388085	388095	388097	388097	Bella	307	‘ O , I understand you now , sir ! ’
388099	388134	388097	388097	Bella	307	‘ I want neither you nor any one else to tell me the rest of the story . I can tell it to YOU , now , if you would like to hear it . ’
388135	388142	388144	388145	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Can you , my dear ? ’
388147	388152	388144	388145	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Tell it then . ’
388153	388156	388158	388158	Bella	307	‘ What ? ’
388170	388307	388158	388158	Bella	307	‘ When you saw what a greedy little wretch you were the patron of , you determined to show her how much misused and misprized riches could do , and often had done , to spoil people ; did you ? Not caring what she thought of you ( and Goodness knows THAT was of no consequence ! ) you showed her , in yourself , the most detestable sides of wealth , saying in your own mind , “ This shallow creature would never work the truth out of her own weak soul , if she had a hundred years to do it in ; but a glaring instance kept before her may open even her eyes and set her thinking . ” That was what you said to yourself , was it , sir ? ’
388308	388317	388318	388319	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I never said anything of the sort , ’
388329	388340	388342	388342	Bella	307	‘ Then you ought to have said it , sir , ’
388352	388426	388342	388342	Bella	307	‘ for you must have thought and meant it . You saw that good fortune was turning my stupid head and hardening my silly heart — was making me grasping , calculating , insolent , insufferable — and you took the pains to be the dearest and kindest fingerpost that ever was set up anywhere , pointing out the road that I was taking and the end it led to . Confess instantly ! ’
388427	388430	388432	388433	Mr Boffin	324	‘ John , ’
388445	388456	388432	388433	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I wish you ’d help me out of this . ’
388457	388468	388470	388470	Bella	307	‘ You ca n’t be heard by counsel , sir , ’
388472	388482	388470	388470	Bella	307	‘ You must speak for yourself . Confess instantly ! ’
388483	388489	388491	388492	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Well , my dear , ’
388494	388600	388491	388492	Mr Boffin	324	‘ the truth is , that when we did go in for the little scheme that my old lady has pinted out , I did put it to John , what did he think of going in for some such general scheme as YOU have pinted out ? But I did n’t in any way so word it , because I did n’t in any way so mean it . I only said to John , would n’t it be more consistent , me going in for being a reg’lar brown bear respecting him , to go in as a reg’lar brown bear all round ? ’
388601	388608	388610	388610	Bella	307	‘ Confess this minute , sir , ’
388612	388623	388610	388610	Bella	307	‘ that you did it to correct and amend me ! ’
388624	388631	388633	388634	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Certainly , my dear child , ’
388636	388779	388633	388634	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I did n’t do it to harm you ; you may be sure of that . And I did hope it might just hint a caution . Still , it ought to be mentioned that no sooner had my old lady found out John , than John made known to her and me that he had had his eye upon a thankless person by the name of Silas Wegg . Partly for the punishment of which Wegg , by leading him on in a very unhandsome and underhanded game that he was playing , them books that you and me bought so many of together ( and , by - the - by , my dear , he was n’t Blackberry Jones , but Blewberry ) was read aloud to me by that person of the name of Silas Wegg aforesaid . ’
388821	388824	388826	388826	Bella	307	‘ Still , ’
388833	388868	388870	388870	Bella	307	‘ there remain two things that I can not understand . Mrs Boffin never supposed any part of the change in Mr Boffin to be real ; did she?—You never did ; did you ? ’
388876	388879	388881	388882	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ No ! ’
388892	388903	388905	388905	Bella	307	‘ And yet you took it very much to heart , ’
388907	388918	388905	388905	Bella	307	‘ I remember its making you very uneasy , indeed . ’
388919	388933	388935	388936	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Ecod , you see Mrs John has a sharp eye , John ! ’
388946	388948	388939	388939	his	324	‘ You ’re
388968	388969	388954	388956	The old lady	12826	’ ‘
388972	388976	388954	388956	The old lady	12826	’ asked Bella . ‘
388989	388990	388983	388983	she	12826	’ ‘
389002	389007	388998	389000	the old lady	12826	’ said Mr Boffin ; ‘
389024	389084	389085	389086	Mrs Boffin	324	’m rather proud of it . My dear , the old lady thinks so high of me that she could n’t abear to see and hear me coming out as a reg’lar brown one . Could n’t abear to make - believe as I meant it ! In consequence of which , we was everlastingly in danger with her . ’
389113	389121	389123	389124	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I assure you , my dear , ’
389126	389225	389123	389124	Mr Boffin	324	‘ that on the celebrated day when I made what has since been agreed upon to be my grandest demonstration — I allude to Mew says the cat , Quack quack says the duck , and Bow - wow - wow says the dog — I assure you , my dear , that on that celebrated day , them flinty and unbelieving words hit my old lady so hard on my account , that I had to hold her , to prevent her running out after you , and defending me by saying I was playing a part . ’
389279	389291	389292	389292	he	324	‘ Never thought of it afore the moment , my dear ! ’
389297	389410	389292	389292	he	324	‘ When John said , if he had been so happy as to win your affections and possess your heart , it come into my head to turn round upon him with “ Win her affections and possess her heart ! Mew says the cat , Quack quack says the duck , and Bow - wow - wow says the dog . ” I could n’t tell you how it come into my head or where from , but it had so much the sound of a rasper that I own to you it astonished myself . I was awful nigh bursting out a laughing though , when it made John stare ! ’
389411	389418	389419	389420	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ You said , my pretty , ’
389424	389436	389419	389420	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ that there was one other thing you could n’t understand . ’
389437	389441	389443	389443	Bella	307	‘ O yes ! ’
389452	389533	389443	389443	Bella	307	‘ but that I never shall be able to understand as long as I live . It is , how John could love me so when I so little deserved it , and how you , Mr and Mrs Boffin , could be so forgetful of yourselves , and take such pains and trouble , to make me a little better , and after all to help him to so unworthy a wife . But I am very very grateful . ’
389673	389688	389692	389693	John Harmon	273	‘ I have already informed my venerable Ma that I know all about it ! ’
389791	389800	389802	389803	John Harmon	273	‘ though we were hard put to it , ’
389805	389816	389802	389803	John Harmon	273	‘ to get it done in so short a time . ’
389864	389872	389874	389875	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Come and look in , Noddy ! ’
389945	389965	389967	389968	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ It looks as if the old man ’s spirit had found rest at last ; do n’t it ? ’
389970	389976	389967	389968	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Yes , old lady . ’
389977	390009	389967	389968	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ And as if his money had turned bright again , after a long long rust in the dark , and was at last a beginning to sparkle in the sunlight ? ’
390010	390016	389967	389968	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Yes , old lady . ’
390017	390032	389967	389968	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ And it makes a pretty and a promising picter ; do n’t it ? ’
390033	390039	389967	389968	Mrs Boffin	324	‘ Yes , old lady . ’
390073	390090	390054	390055	Mr Boffin	324	‘ A pretty and a hopeful picter ? Mew , Quack quack , Bow - wow ! ’
390340	390809	390331	390335	This supervisor of the proceedings	8210	’ rights to cart off by daylight , nightlight , torchlight , when they would , must have been the death of Silas if the work had lasted much longer . Seeming never to need sleep himself , he would reappear , with a tied - up broken head , in fantail hat and velveteen smalls , like an accursed goblin , at the most unholy and untimely hours . Tired out by keeping close ward over a long day ’s work in fog and rain , Silas would have just crawled to bed and be dozing , when a horrid shake and rumble under his pillow would announce an approaching train of carts , escorted by this Demon of Unrest , to fall to work again . At another time , he would be rumbled up out of his soundest sleep , in the dead of the night ; at another , would be kept at his post eight - and - forty hours on end . The more his persecutor besought him not to trouble himself to turn out , the more suspicious was the crafty Wegg that indications had been observed of something hidden somewhere , and that attempts were on foot to circumvent him . So continually broken was his rest through these means , that he led the life of having wagered to keep ten thousand dog - watches in ten thousand hours , and looked piteously upon himself as always getting up and yet never going to bed . So gaunt and haggard had he grown at last , that his wooden leg showed disproportionate , and presented a thriving appearance in contrast with the rest of his plagued body , which might almost have been termed chubby . However , Wegg ’s comfort was , that all his disagreeables were now over , and that he was immediately coming into his property . Of late , the grindstone did undoubtedly appear to have been whirling at his own nose rather than Boffin ’s , but Boffin ’s nose was now to be sharpened fine . Thus far , Mr Wegg had let his dusty friend off lightly , having been baulked in that amiable design of frequently dining with him , by the machinations of the sleepless dustman . He had been constrained to depute Mr Venus to keep their dusty friend , Boffin , under inspection , while he himself turned lank and lean at the Bower . To Mr Venus ’s museum Mr Wegg repaired when at length the Mounds were down and gone . It being evening , he found that gentleman , as he expected , seated over his fire ; but did not find him , as he expected , floating his powerful mind in tea . ‘
390818	390836	390837	390837	I	0	’ said Wegg , seeming to take it ill , and stopping and sniffing as he entered . ‘
390844	390848	390837	390837	I	0	’ said Venus . ‘
390861	390868	390859	390859	you	8755	’ asked Wegg , sniffing again . ‘
390874	390878	390859	390859	you	8755	’ said Venus . ‘
390892	390895	390859	390859	you	8755	’ punch . ’
390896	390902	390859	390859	you	8755	‘ What do you call cobblers ’
390905	390916	390859	390859	you	8755	’ demanded Wegg , in a worse humour than before . ‘
390929	390933	390927	390927	sir	8755	’ returned Venus , ‘
390971	390972	390859	390859	you	8755	’ ‘
390978	390989	390859	390859	you	8755	’ said Wegg gloomily , as he sat himself down . ‘
390998	391002	390859	390859	you	8755	’ cried Venus . ‘
391009	391010	390859	390859	you	8755	’ ‘
391015	391021	391012	391012	I	0	’ returned Wegg very surlily . ‘
391064	391065	391060	391060	he	8581	’ ‘
391086	391087	391077	391077	You	8755	’ ‘
391103	391107	391094	391094	you	8755	’ growled Wegg . ‘
391117	391136	391108	391108	You	8755	’ This circumstance appeared , in his then state of mind , to give Mr Wegg uncommon offence . ‘
391146	391156	391159	391160	Mr Wegg	319	’ said Wegg , missing the usual dusty shock . ‘
391173	391174	391159	391160	Mr Wegg	319	’ ‘
391186	391194	391207	391208	Mr Wegg	319	’ said Wegg , with culminating discontent . ‘
391203	391204	391197	391197	you	8755	’ ‘
391210	391220	391207	391208	Mr Wegg	319	’ said Venus , smiling in a sprightly manner , ‘
391235	391236	391223	391223	you	319	’ ‘
391244	391248	391237	391237	I	0	’ retorted Wegg . ‘
391311	391312	391317	391317	sir	8755	’ ‘
391319	391323	391317	391317	sir	8755	’ said Venus . ‘
391337	391338	391335	391335	you	319	’ ‘
391341	391345	391335	391335	you	319	’ grumbled Wegg , ‘
391398	391399	391408	391409	Mr Wegg	319	’ ‘
391411	391424	391408	391409	Mr Wegg	319	’ said Venus , contemplating his figure with an artist ’s eye . ‘
391471	391525	391460	391465	the French gentleman in the corner	8222	’ Mr Wegg , glancing in great dudgeon towards the French gentleman ’s corner , seemed to notice something new there , which induced him to glance at the opposite corner , and then to put on his glasses and stare at all the nooks and corners of the dim shop in succession . ‘
391537	391541	391544	391545	Mr Wegg	319	’ he exclaimed . ‘

391615	391621	391582	391582	Silas	319	‘ To the old party ? ’

Not sounded , unless in the most respectful and tuneful manner . Of such melodious strings is Miss Pleasant Riderhood formed . ’
391731	391741	391743	391743	Wegg	319	‘ Then it IS the lady as formerly objected ? ’

391975	392149	391973	391973	Venus	379	‘ what the nature of the lady ’s objection was , I may impart , without violating any of the tender confidences since sprung up between the lady and myself , how it has been met , through the kind interference of two good friends of mine : one , previously acquainted with the lady : and one , not . The pint was thrown out , sir , by those two friends when they did me the great service of waiting on the lady to try if a union betwixt the lady and me could not be brought to bear — the pint , I say , was thrown out by them , sir , whether if , after marriage , I confined myself to the articulation of men , children , and the lower animals , it might not relieve the lady ’s mind of her feeling respecting being as a lady — regarded in a bony light . It was a happy thought , sir , and it took root . ’
392150	392158	392160	392160	Wegg	319	‘ It would seem , Mr Venus , ’
392168	392176	392160	392160	Wegg	319	‘ that you are flush of friends ? ’
392177	392183	392184	392185	that gentleman	1468	‘ Pretty well , sir , ’
392195	392205	392184	392185	that gentleman	1468	‘ So - so , sir . Pretty well . ’
392206	392209	392211	392211	Wegg	319	‘ However , ’
392222	392255	392211	392211	Wegg	319	‘ I wish you joy . One man spends his fortune in one way , and another in another . You are going to try matrimony . I mean to try travelling . ’

392263	392346	392211	392211	Wegg	319	‘ Change of air , sea - scenery , and my natural rest , I hope may bring me round after the persecutions I have undergone from the dustman with his head tied up , which I just now mentioned . The tough job being ended and the Mounds laid low , the hour is come for Boffin to stump up . Would ten to - morrow morning suit you , partner , for finally bringing Boffin ’s nose to the grindstone ? ’
392362	392374	392376	392376	Silas	319	‘ You have had him well under inspection , I hope ? ’
392390	392446	392448	392448	Wegg	319	‘ Suppose you was just to step round to - night then , and give him orders from me — I say from me , because he knows I wo n’t be played with — to be ready with his papers , his accounts , and his cash , at that time in the morning ? ’
392450	392504	392448	392448	Wegg	319	‘ And as a matter of form , which will be agreeable to your own feelings , before we go out ( for I ’ll walk with you part of the way , though my leg gives under me with weariness ) , let ’s have a look at the stock in trade . ’

392721	392732	392734	392734	Wegg	319	‘ Now , I tell you what , young fellow , ’
392736	392760	392734	392734	Wegg	319	‘ I wo n’t have it . This wo n’t do for me . I do n’t want menials . I want Boffin . ’

393017	393052	393004	393004	Wegg	319	‘ Very good ! I gave directions for YOU to be dismissed . And you ai n’t gone , ai n’t you ? Oh ! We ’ll look into this presently . Very good ! ’

393311	393324	393325	393326	Mr Boffin	324	‘ No fellows , or I ’ll throw you out of winder ! ’

393393	393404	393406	393407	Mr Boffin	324	‘ That ’s not going to be done , Wegg , ’

393512	393517	393519	393519	Venus	379	‘ Certainly , sir , ’
393529	393588	393589	393590	Mr Wegg	319	‘ There it is . Having now , sir , parted with it , I wish to make a small observation : not so much because it is anyways necessary , or expresses any new doctrine or discovery , as because it is a comfort to my mind . Silas Wegg , you are a precious old rascal . ’
393624	393628	393630	393630	Venus	379	‘ Silas Wegg , ’
393632	393662	393630	393630	Venus	379	‘ know that I took the liberty of taking Mr Boffin into our concern as a sleeping partner , at a very early period of our firm ’s existence . ’
393663	393667	393669	393670	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Quite true , ’
393672	393700	393669	393670	Mr Boffin	324	‘ and I tested Venus by making him a pretended proposal or two ; and I found him on the whole a very honest man , Wegg . ’
393701	393715	393716	393716	Venus	379	‘ So Mr Boffin , in his indulgence , is pleased to say , ’
393719	393756	393716	393716	Venus	379	‘ though in the beginning of this dirt , my hands were not , for a few hours , quite as clean as I could wish . But I hope I made early and full amends . ’
393757	393763	393765	393766	Mr Boffin	324	‘ Venus , you did , ’
393768	393775	393776	393776	Venus	379	‘ Certainly , certainly , certainly . ’
393785	393851	393776	393776	Venus	379	‘ Thank you , sir . I am much obliged to you , sir , for all . For your good opinion now , for your way of receiving and encouraging me when I first put myself in communication with you , and for the influence since so kindly brought to bear upon a certain lady , both by yourself and by Mr John Harmon . ’
393904	393915	393917	393917	Venus	379	‘ Everything else between you and me , Mr Wegg , ’
393919	394005	393917	393917	Venus	379	‘ now explains itself , and you can now make out , sir , without further words from me . But totally to prevent any unpleasantness or mistake that might arise on what I consider an important point , to be made quite clear at the close of our acquaintance , I beg the leave of Mr Boffin and Mr John Harmon to repeat an observation which I have already had the pleasure of bringing under your notice . You are a precious old rascal ! ’
394006	394012	394014	394014	Wegg	319	‘ You are a fool , ’
394023	394077	394079	394079	Wegg	319	‘ and I ’d have got rid of you before now , if I could have struck out any way of doing it . I have thought it over , I can tell you . You may go , and welcome . You leave the more for me . Because , you know , ’
394092	394129	394089	394090	Mr Harmon	273	‘ I am worth my price , and I mean to have it . This getting off is all very well in its way , and it tells with such an anatomical Pump as this one , ’
394135	394169	394089	394090	Mr Harmon	273	‘ but it wo n’t do with a Man . I am here to be bought off , and I have named my figure . Now , buy me , or leave me . ’
394170	394178	394180	394181	Mr Boffin	324	‘ I ’ll leave you , Wegg , ’
394185	394193	394180	394181	Mr Boffin	324	‘ as far as I am concerned . ’
394194	394199	394201	394201	Wegg	319	‘ Bof — fin ! ’
394211	394258	394201	394201	Wegg	319	‘ I understand YOUR new - born boldness . I see the brass underneath YOUR silver plating . YOU have got YOUR nose out of joint . Knowing that you ’ve nothing at stake , you can afford to come the independent game . Why , you ’re

394406	394422	394424	394424	you	8255	’ said John Harmon , with as much indifference as was compatible with extreme sternness . ‘
394427	394431	394424	394424	you	8255	’ cried Wegg . ‘
394434	394463	394424	394424	you	8255	’ screwing the weight of his body upon his wooden leg , and screwing his wooden head very much on one side , and screwing up one eye : ‘

394483	394542	394543	394543	You	8255	’ said John Harmon . Wegg had repeated the word with a sneer , and was entering on some sarcastic retort , when , to his boundless amazement , he found himself gripped by the cravat ; shaken until his teeth chattered ; shoved back , staggering , into a corner of the room ; and pinned there . ‘
394546	394561	394562	394562	You	8255	’ said John Harmon , whose seafaring hold was like that of a vice . ‘
394563	394571	394573	394573	Silas	319	’re knocking my head against the wall , ’
394576	394587	394573	394573	Silas	319	‘ I mean to knock your head against the wall , ’
394605	394633	394634	394634	Sloppy	496	‘ and I ’d give a thousand pounds for leave to knock your brains out . Listen , you scoundrel , and look at that Dutch bottle . ’
394643	394971	394634	394634	Sloppy	496	‘ That Dutch bottle , scoundrel , contained the latest will of the many wills made by my unhappy self - tormenting father . That will gives everything absolutely to my noble benefactor and yours , Mr Boffin , excluding and reviling me , and my sister ( then already dead of a broken heart ) , by name . That Dutch bottle was found by my noble benefactor and yours , after he entered on possession of the estate . That Dutch bottle distressed him beyond measure , because , though I and my sister were both no more , it cast a slur upon our memory which he knew we had done nothing in our miserable youth , to deserve . That Dutch bottle , therefore , he buried in the Mound belonging to him , and there it lay while you , you thankless wretch , were prodding and poking — often very near it , I dare say . His intention was , that it should never see the light ; but he was afraid to destroy it , lest to destroy such a document , even with his great generous motive , might be an offence at law . After the discovery was made here who I was , Mr Boffin , still restless on the subject , told me , upon certain conditions impossible for such a hound as you to appreciate , the secret of that Dutch bottle . I urged upon him the necessity of its being dug up , and the paper being legally produced and established . The first thing you saw him do , and the second thing has been done without your knowledge . Consequently , the paper now rattling in your hand as I shake you — and I should like to shake the life out of you — is worth less than the rotten cork of the Dutch bottle , do you understand ? ’
394996	395001	395003	395004	John Harmon	273	‘ Now , scoundrel , ’
395023	395026	395003	395004	John Harmon	273	’ length , ‘
395176	395188	395173	395173	you	273	’ Here , John Harmon assisted his comprehension with another shake . ‘

395348	395369	395371	395371	I	0	’ added John Harmon through his clenched teeth , and with a very ugly turn indeed on Wegg ’s cravat , ‘
395401	395488	395489	395489	I	0	’ Silas , released , put his hand to his throat , cleared it , and looked as if he had a rather large fishbone in that region . Simultaneously with this action on his part in his corner , a singular , and on the surface an incomprehensible , movement was made by Mr Sloppy : who began backing towards Mr Wegg along the wall , in the manner of a porter or heaver who is about to lift a sack of flour or coals . ‘
395495	395504	395489	395489	I	0	’ said Mr Boffin , in his clemency , ‘

395602	395609	395599	395600	Mr Boffin	324	’ returned Wegg in avaricious humiliation : ‘

395649	395654	395642	395642	they	8271	’ said John Harmon , ‘

395674	395689	395671	395672	Mr Boffin	324	’ resumed Wegg , with a malignant glance in the last speaker ’s direction , ‘

395761	395774	395776	395776	I	0	’ said Mr Boffin uneasily , with his hand in his pocket , ‘

395825	395836	395814	395814	I	0	’ Mr Wegg went on , in a meditative manner , ‘
395870	395871	395867	395868	Mr Boffin	324	’ ‘
395886	395892	395876	395876	I	0	’ the Golden Dustman muttered . ‘

395971	395994	395968	395969	Mr Boffin	324	’ The Golden Dustman seeming to be engaged in some abstruse calculation , Mr Wegg assisted him with the following additional items . ‘
396067	396084	396128	396128	you	324	’ Mr Sloppy still continued his singular , and on the surface his incomprehensible , movement . ‘
396091	396099	396128	396128	you	324	’ said Wegg with a melancholy air , ‘
396193	396194	396183	396183	I	0	’ ‘
396197	396202	396183	396183	I	0	’ said Mr Boffin . ‘

396225	397399	396217	396217	I	0	’ The words were but out of his mouth when John Harmon lifted his finger , and Sloppy , who was now close to Wegg , backed to Wegg ’s back , stooped , grasped his coat collar behind with both hands , and deftly swung him up like the sack of flour or coals before mentioned . A countenance of special discontent and amazement Mr Wegg exhibited in this position , with his buttons almost as prominently on view as Sloppy ’s own , and with his wooden leg in a highly unaccommodating state . But , not for many seconds was his countenance visible in the room ; for , Sloppy lightly trotted out with him and trotted down the staircase , Mr Venus attending to open the street door . Mr Sloppy ’s instructions had been to deposit his burden in the road ; but , a scavenger ’s cart happening to stand unattended at the corner , with its little ladder planted against the wheel , Mr S. found it impossible to resist the temptation of shooting Mr Silas Wegg into the cart ’s contents . A somewhat difficult feat , achieved with great dexterity , and with a prodigious splash . Chapter 15 WHAT WAS CAUGHT IN THE TRAPS THAT WERE SET How Bradley Headstone had been racked and riven in his mind since the quiet evening when by the river - side he had risen , as it were , out of the ashes of the Bargeman , none but he could have told . Not even he could have told , for such misery can only be felt . First , he had to bear the combined weight of the knowledge of what he had done , of that haunting reproach that he might have done it so much better , and of the dread of discovery . This was load enough to crush him , and he laboured under it day and night . It was as heavy on him in his scanty sleep , as in his red - eyed waking hours . It bore him down with a dread unchanging monotony , in which there was not a moment ’s variety . The overweighted beast of burden , or the overweighted slave , can for certain instants shift the physical load , and find some slight respite even in enforcing additional pain upon such a set of muscles or such a limb . Not even that poor mockery of relief could the wretched man obtain , under the steady pressure of the infernal atmosphere into which he had entered . Time went by , and no visible suspicion dogged him ; time went by , and in such public accounts of the attack as were renewed at intervals , he began to see Mr Lightwood ( who acted as lawyer for the injured man ) straying further from the fact , going wider of the issue , and evidently slackening in his zeal . By degrees , a glimmering of the cause of this began to break on Bradley ’s sight . Then came the chance meeting with Mr Milvey at the railway station ( where he often lingered in his leisure hours , as a place where any fresh news of his deed would be circulated , or any placard referring to it would be posted ) , and then he saw in the light what he had brought about . For , then he saw that through his desperate attempt to separate those two for ever , he had been made the means of uniting them . That he had dipped his hands in blood , to mark himself a miserable fool and tool . That Eugene Wrayburn , for his wife ’s sake , set him aside and left him to crawl along his blasted course . He thought of Fate , or Providence , or be the directing Power what it might , as having put a fraud upon him — overreached him — and in his impotent mad rage bit , and tore , and had his fit . New assurance of the truth came upon him in the next few following days , when it was put forth how the wounded man had been married on his bed , and to whom , and how , though always in a dangerous condition , he was a shade better . Bradley would far rather have been seized for his murder , than he would have read that passage , knowing himself spared , and knowing why . But , not to be still further defrauded and overreached — which he would be , if implicated by Riderhood , and punished by the law for his abject failure , as though it had been a success — he kept close in his school during the day , ventured out warily at night , and went no more to the railway station . He examined the advertisements in the newspapers for any sign that Riderhood acted on his hinted threat of so summoning him to renew their acquaintance , but found none . Having paid him handsomely for the support and accommodation he had had at the Lock House , and knowing him to be a very ignorant man who could not write , he began to doubt whether he was to be feared at all , or whether they need ever meet again . All this time , his mind was never off the rack , and his raging sense of having been made to fling himself across the chasm which divided those two , and bridge it over for their coming together , never cooled down . This horrible condition brought on other fits . He could not have said how many , or when ; but he saw in the faces of his pupils that they had seen him in that state , and that they were possessed by a dread of his relapsing . One winter day when a slight fall of snow was feathering the sills and frames of the schoolroom windows , he stood at his black board , crayon in hand , about to commence with a class ; when , reading in the countenances of those boys that there was something wrong , and that they seemed in alarm for him , he turned his eyes to the door towards which they faced . He then saw a slouching man of forbidding appearance standing in the midst of the school , with a bundle under his arm ; and saw that it was Riderhood . He sat down on a stool which one of his boys put for him , and he had a passing knowledge that he was in danger of falling , and that his face was becoming distorted . But , the fit went off for that time , and he wiped his mouth , and stood up again . ‘

400808	400835	400806	400806	Riderhood	594	’ he said , raising himself in his chair , after a long silence , and drawing out his purse and putting it on the table . ‘

401221	401312	401212	401212	Riderhood	594	‘ I spoke to her . I did n’t say much to her . She was put in a fluster by my dropping in among the young ladies ( I never did set up for a lady ’s man ) , and she took me into her parlour to hope as there was nothink wrong . I tells her , “ O no , nothink wrong . The master ’s my wery good friend . ” But I see how the land laid , and that she was comfortable off . ’
401337	401350	401352	401352	Riderhood	594	‘ She could n’t live more handy to you than she does , ’

401668	401933	401666	401666	Master	2991	’ Without a sign to show that he heard , Bradley walked out of the Lock House . Catching up from the table a piece of bread , and taking his Bargeman ’s bundle under his arm , Riderhood immediately followed him . Bradley turned towards London . Riderhood caught him up , and walked at his side . The two men trudged on , side by side , in silence , full three miles . Suddenly , Bradley turned to retrace his course . Instantly , Riderhood turned likewise , and they went back side by side . Bradley re - entered the Lock House . So did Riderhood . Bradley sat down in the window . Riderhood warmed himself at the fire . After an hour or more , Bradley abruptly got up again , and again went out , but this time turned the other way . Riderhood was close after him , caught him up in a few paces , and walked at his side . This time , as before , when he found his attendant not to be shaken off , Bradley suddenly turned back . This time , as before , Riderhood turned back along with him . But , not this time , as before , did they go into the Lock House , for Bradley came to a stand on the snow - covered turf by the Lock , looking up the river and down the river . Navigation was impeded by the frost , and the scene was a mere white and yellow desert . ‘
401940	401948	401938	401938	Master	2991	’ urged Riderhood , at his side . ‘
401989	402010	401978	401978	I	0	’ Without a word of reply , Bradley passed quickly from him over the wooden bridge on the lock gates . ‘
402024	402030	402031	402032	The Weir	807	’ said Riderhood , following . ‘
402047	402076	402044	402044	you	2991	’ Without taking the least notice , Bradley leaned his body against a post , in a resting attitude , and there rested with his eyes cast down . ‘
402081	402087	402088	402088	I	0	’ said Riderhood , gruffly , ‘
402100	402142	402088	402088	I	0	’ With a rattle and a rush of water , he then swung - to the lock gates that were standing open , before opening the others . So , both sets of gates were , for the moment , closed . ‘
402156	402163	402151	402151	Bradley	517	’ said Riderhood , passing him , ‘
402183	402220	402181	402181	you	2991	’ Bradley had caught him round the body . He seemed to be girdled with an iron ring . They were on the brink of the Lock , about midway between the two sets of gates . ‘
402224	402228	402230	402230	I	0	’ said Riderhood , ‘
402248	402298	402230	402230	I	0	’ Bradley was drawing to the Lock - edge . Riderhood was drawing away from it . It was a strong grapple , and a fierce struggle , arm and leg . Bradley got him round , with his back to the Lock , and still worked him backward . ‘
402302	402306	402311	402311	you	2991	’ said Riderhood . ‘

402351	402362	402363	402363	I	0	’ returned Bradley , in a desperate , clenched voice . ‘
402385	402551	402563	402563	her	8385	’ Riderhood went over into the smooth pit , backward , and Bradley Headstone upon him . When the two were found , lying under the ooze and scum behind one of the rotting gates , Riderhood ’s hold had relaxed , probably in falling , and his eyes were staring upward . But , he was girdled still with Bradley ’s iron ring , and the rivets of the iron ring held tight .

403245	403253	403241	403241	her	317	‘ that you ’d loll a little . ’
403254	403257	403259	403260	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ How ! ’
403262	403265	403259	403260	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Loll ! ’
403266	403271	403241	403241	her	317	‘ Yes , Ma . ’

403282	403289	403278	403280	the impressive lady	8408	‘ I am incapable of it . ’
403290	403332	403241	403241	her	317	‘ I am sure you look so , Ma . But why one should go out to dine with one ’s own daughter or sister , as if one ’s under - petticoat was a backboard , I do NOT understand . ’
403333	403339	403341	403342	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Neither do I understand , ’
403348	403371	403341	403342	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ how a young lady can mention the garment in the name of which you have indulged . I blush for you . ’
403372	403378	403380	403380	Lavvy	317	‘ Thank you , Ma , ’
403384	403405	403380	403380	Lavvy	317	‘ but I can do it for myself , I am obliged to you , when there ’s any occasion . ’
403434	403449	403341	403342	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ After all , you know , ma’am , we know it ’s there . ’
403459	403466	403468	403469	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ We know it ’s there ! ’
403473	403478	403468	403469	Mrs Wilfer	302	‘ Really , George , ’
403483	403508	403480	403481	Miss Lavinia	310	‘ I must say that I do n’t understand your allusions , and that I think you might be more delicate and less personal . ’
403509	403513	403515	403516	Mr Sampson	249	‘ Go it ! ’
403530	403541	403515	403516	Mr Sampson	249	‘ Oh yes ! Go it , Miss Lavinia Wilfer ! ’
403542	403567	403569	403570	Miss Lavinia	310	‘ What you may mean , George Sampson , by your omnibus - driving expressions , I can not pretend to imagine . Neither , ’
403572	403601	403569	403570	Miss Lavinia	310	‘ Mr George Sampson , do I wish to imagine . It is enough for me to know in my own heart that I am not going to — ’
403623	403627	403616	403617	Miss Lavinia	310	‘ going to it ’
403644	403648	403650	403651	Mr Sampson	249	‘ Oh yes ! ’
403656	403665	403650	403651	Mr Sampson	249	‘ Thus it ever is . I never — ’
403666	403673	403677	403677	him	249	‘ If you mean to say , ’
403712	403724	403707	403707	We	8411	’ ( As if this were a home - thrust . ) ‘
403727	403737	403725	403725	Lavinia	310	’ returned Mr Sampson , in a dismal vein , ‘
403782	403787	403778	403778	you	8414	’ said Mr Sampson , ‘
403816	403842	403843	403844	Mr Sampson	249	’ The stately lady , Mrs Wilfer , perceiving her opportunity of delivering a few remarks from the throne , here took up the altercation . ‘
403846	403850	403843	403844	Mr Sampson	249	’ she began , ‘
403866	403867	403869	403869	him	10410	’ ‘
403874	403881	403872	403872	Ma	451	’ Miss Lavvy interposed with haughtiness . ‘
403893	403894	403888	403888	he	10410	’ ‘
403899	403904	403897	403897	Lavinia	310	’ quoth Mrs Wilfer , ‘
403925	403927	403914	403916	Mr George Sampson	249	’ ( ‘
403944	403949	403942	403942	Ma	451	’ Miss Lavvy interposed , ‘
403962	403964	403951	403951	I	0	’ ) ‘
403967	403974	403975	403975	I	0	’ said Mrs Wilfer , solemnly . ‘
404042	404052	404038	404040	Mr George Sampson	249	’ proceeded Mrs Wilfer , majestically waving her gloves , ‘
404142	404143	404125	404125	I	0	’ ‘
404150	404160	404125	404125	I	0	’ Mr Sampson explained , in exceedingly low spirits , ‘
404221	404222	404213	404213	her	310	’ ‘
404234	404243	404224	404224	you	0	’ observed Miss Lavinia , with much politeness , ‘
404263	404264	404252	404252	you	0	’ ‘
404268	404275	404252	404252	you	0	’ urged Mr Sampson , pathetically , ‘
404280	404281	404278	404278	you	813	’ ‘
404295	404301	404284	404284	you	0	’ returned the young lady , ‘
404308	404309	404304	404304	you	0	’ ‘
404313	404318	404322	404322	ma’am	1643	’ pursued Mr Sampson , ‘
404379	404386	404388	404388	he	1643	’ Mr Sampson slapped his forehead , ‘
404398	404399	404388	404388	he	1643	’ ‘
404419	404424	404388	404388	he	1643	’ said Miss Lavvy , ‘
404441	404452	404438	404438	MY	0	’ Mr Sampson immediately expressed his fervent Opinion that this was ‘
404456	404548	404574	404574	yours	0	’ , and was brought upon his knees at Miss Lavinia ’s feet . It was the crowning addition indispensable to the full enjoyment of both mother and daughter , to bear Mr Sampson , a grateful captive , into the glittering halls he had mentioned , and to parade him through the same , at once a living witness of their glory , and a bright instance of their condescension . Ascending the staircase , Miss Lavinia permitted him to walk at her side , with the air of saying : ‘
404578	404607	404608	404608	Exotics	815	’ She also benignantly intimated to him , aloud , the nature of the objects upon which he looked , and to which he was unaccustomed : as , ‘
404612	404613	404610	404610	George	249	’ ‘
404619	404620	404617	404617	George	249	’ ‘
404627	405106	404625	404625	George	249	’ and the like . While , through the whole of the decorations , Mrs Wilfer led the way with the bearing of a Savage Chief , who would feel himself compromised by manifesting the slightest token of surprise or admiration . Indeed , the bearing of this impressive woman , throughout the day , was a pattern to all impressive women under similar circumstances . She renewed the acquaintance of Mr and Mrs Boffin , as if Mr and Mrs Boffin had said of her what she had said of them , and as if Time alone could quite wear her injury out . She regarded every servant who approached her , as her sworn enemy , expressly intending to offer her affronts with the dishes , and to pour forth outrages on her moral feelings from the decanters . She sat erect at table , on the right hand of her son - in - law , as half suspecting poison in the viands , and as bearing up with native force of character against other deadly ambushes . Her carriage towards Bella was as a carriage towards a young lady of good position , whom she had met in society a few years ago . Even when , slightly thawing under the influence of sparkling champagne , she related to her son - in - law some passages of domestic interest concerning her papa , she infused into the narrative such Arctic suggestions of her having been an unappreciated blessing to mankind , since her papa ’s days , and also of that gentleman ’s having been a frosty impersonation of a frosty race , as struck cold to the very soles of the feet of the hearers . The Inexhaustible being produced , staring , and evidently intending a weak and washy smile shortly , no sooner beheld her , than it was stricken spasmodic and inconsolable . When she took her leave at last , it would have been hard to say whether it was with the air of going to the scaffold herself , or of leaving the inmates of the house for immediate execution . Yet , John Harmon enjoyed it all merrily , and told his wife , when he and she were alone , that her natural ways had never seemed so dearly natural as beside this foil , and that although he did not dispute her being her father ’s daughter , he should ever remain stedfast in the faith that she could not be her mother ’s . This visit was , as has been said , a grand event . Another event , not grand but deemed in the house a special one , occurred at about the same period ; and this was , the first interview between Mr Sloppy and Miss Wren . The dolls ’
405142	405148	405150	405151	Miss Wren	523	‘ Come in , sir , ’
405160	405167	405150	405151	Miss Wren	523	‘ And who may you be ? ’
405177	405181	405183	405183	Jenny	523	‘ Oh indeed ! ’
405185	405204	405183	405183	Jenny	523	‘ Ah ! I have been looking forward to knowing you . I heard of your distinguishing yourself . ’
405205	405211	405213	405213	Sloppy	496	‘ Did you , Miss ? ’
405215	405233	405213	405213	Sloppy	496	‘ I am sure I am glad to hear it , but I do n’t know how . ’
405234	405243	405245	405246	Miss Wren	523	‘ Pitching somebody into a mud - cart , ’
405248	405254	405256	405256	Sloppy	496	‘ Oh ! That way ! ’
405258	405262	405256	405256	Sloppy	496	‘ Yes , Miss. ’
405271	405275	405277	405278	Miss Wren	523	‘ Bless us ! ’
405284	405311	405277	405278	Miss Wren	523	‘ Do n’t open your mouth as wide as that , young man , or it ’ll catch so , and not shut again some day . ’
405332	405336	405327	405327	his	496	‘ Why , you ’re
405341	405346	405348	405348	he	496	’ said Miss Wren , ‘
405363	405364	405366	405366	he	496	’ ‘
405373	405377	405366	405366	he	496	’ asked Sloppy . ‘
405380	405385	405366	405366	he	496	’ said Miss Wren . ‘
405388	405415	405366	405366	he	496	’ Her visitor glanced round the room — which had many comforts in it now , that had not been in it before — and said : ‘
405423	405424	405422	405422	Miss.	8441	’ ‘
405432	405437	405426	405426	you	496	’ returned Miss Wren . ‘
405446	405469	405441	405441	you	496	’ The honesty of Mr Sloppy being severely taxed by the question , he twisted a button , grinned , and faltered . ‘
405474	405484	405441	405441	you	496	’ said Miss Wren , with an arch look . ‘
405495	405513	405487	405487	you	496	’ In shaking her head at him after asking the question , she shook her hair down . ‘
405516	405526	405487	405487	you	496	’ cried Sloppy , in a burst of admiration . ‘
405536	405570	405571	405571	You	8441	’ Miss Wren , with her usual expressive hitch , went on with her work . But , left her hair as it was ; not displeased by the effect it had made . ‘
405583	405587	405581	405581	Miss	1350	’ asked Sloppy . ‘
405590	405599	405581	405581	Miss	1350	’ said Miss Wren , with a chop . ‘
405607	405608	405603	405605	my fairy godmother	8444	’ ‘
405611	405620	405603	405605	my fairy godmother	8444	’ Mr Sloppy could n’t make it out ; ‘
405629	405630	405624	405624	you	8441	’ ‘
405633	405641	405624	405624	you	8441	’ replied Miss Wren , more seriously . ‘
405656	405668	405670	405670	you	8441	’ And she shook her head , and drew a sigh . ‘
405682	405686	405687	405687	you	8441	’ she added , ‘
405707	405708	405709	405709	You	8441	’ ‘
405718	405731	405709	405709	You	8441	’ said Sloppy , glancing at the array of dolls in hand , ‘
405749	405750	405740	405740	Miss	8449	’ ‘
405760	405771	405740	405740	Miss	8449	’ returned the dress - maker , tossing her head . ‘
405795	405796	405778	405778	I	0	’ ‘
405802	405815	405800	405800	I	0	’ said Sloppy , in something of a self - reproachful tone , ‘
405839	405840	405826	405827	Mr Boffin	324	’ ‘
405849	405854	405841	405841	I	0	’ observed Miss Wren ; ‘
405861	405866	405841	405841	I	0	’ Mr Sloppy nodded . ‘
405893	405894	405885	405885	I	0	’ ‘
405901	405902	405903	405903	I	0	’ ‘
405908	405916	405903	405903	I	0	’ said Sloppy , surveying the room , ‘
405978	405979	405972	405972	him	8452	’ ‘
405985	406001	405972	405972	him	8452	’ returned the little creature , with a quick flush of her face and neck . ‘
406006	406048	406049	406049	I	0	’ Poor Sloppy flushed too , for there was an instinctive delicacy behind his buttons , and his own hand had struck it . He said , perhaps , the best thing in the way of amends that could be said . ‘
406078	406098	406073	406073	I	0	’ Miss Wren was in the act of handing it to him over her bench , when she paused . ‘
406108	406114	406100	406100	you	0	’ she said , sharply . ‘
406136	406137	406122	406122	Kicketty	817	’ ‘
406150	406182	406143	406143	you	0	’ said Sloppy . The little dressmaker sat down again , and gave it into his hand , saying , with that better look upon her , and with a smile : ‘
406186	406187	406184	406184	you	0	’ ‘
406197	406219	406184	406184	you	0	’ said Sloppy , after measuring the handle on his sleeve , and softly standing the stick aside against the wall , ‘
406268	406296	406184	406184	you	0	’ Mrs Higden and Johnny a comic song myself , with “ Spoken ” in it . Though that ’s not your sort , I ’ll wager . ’
406297	406306	406308	406309	the dressmaker	10803	‘ You are a very kind young man , ’
406311	406328	406329	406329	she	10803	‘ a really kind young man . I accept your offer.—I suppose He wo n’t mind , ’
406339	406348	406329	406329	she	10803	‘ and if he does , he may ! ’
406349	406360	406362	406362	Sloppy	496	‘ Meaning him that you call your father , Miss , ’
406364	406369	406371	406372	Miss Wren	523	‘ No , no , ’
406374	406381	406371	406372	Miss Wren	523	‘ Him , Him , Him ! ’
406382	406389	406391	406391	Sloppy	496	‘ Him , him , him ? ’
406401	406412	406414	406415	Miss Wren	523	‘ Him who is coming to court and marry me , ’
406417	406426	406414	406415	Miss Wren	523	‘ Dear me , how slow you are ! ’
406427	406432	406434	406434	Sloppy	496	‘ Oh ! HIM ! ’
406446	406460	406468	406469	Miss Wren	523	‘ I never thought of him . When is he coming , Miss ? ’
406461	406466	406468	406469	Miss Wren	523	‘ What a question ! ’
406471	406477	406468	406469	Miss Wren	523	‘ How should I know ! ’
406478	406487	406468	406469	Miss Wren	523	‘ Where is he coming from , Miss ? ’
406488	406534	406468	406469	Miss Wren	523	‘ Why , good gracious , how can I tell ! He is coming from somewhere or other , I suppose , and he is coming some day or other , I suppose . I do n’t know any more about him , at present . ’
406570	406587	406568	406569	the dolls	3346	’ dressmaker laughed very heartily indeed . So they both laughed , till they were tired . ‘
406594	406599	406568	406569	the dolls	3346	’ said Miss Wren . ‘
406602	406636	406649	406649	Sloppy	496	’ sake , stop , Giant , or I shall be swallowed up alive , before I know it . And to this minute you have n’t said what you ’ve come for . ’
406637	406647	406649	406649	Sloppy	496	‘ I have come for little Miss Harmonses doll , ’
406651	406657	406659	406660	Miss Wren	523	‘ I thought as much , ’
406662	406715	406659	406660	Miss Wren	523	‘ and here is little Miss Harmonses doll waiting for you . She ’s folded up in silver paper , you see , as if she was wrapped from head to foot in new Bank notes . Take care of her , and there ’s my hand , and thank you again . ’
406716	406732	406734	406734	Sloppy	496	‘ I ’ll take more care of her than if she was a gold image , ’
406736	406754	406734	406734	Sloppy	496	‘ and there ’s both MY hands , Miss , and I ’ll soon come back again . ’
406957	406963	406965	406965	Eugene	269	‘ I make no protestations , ’
406967	406980	406965	406965	Eugene	269	‘ — who does , who means them!—I have made a resolution . ’
406981	406989	406997	406997	her	8645	‘ But would you believe , Bella , ’
407014	407037	406991	406992	his wife	8645	‘ that on our wedding day he told me he almost thought the best thing he could do , was to die ? ’
407038	407048	407050	407050	Eugene	269	‘ As I did n’t do it , Lizzie , ’
407052	407066	407050	407050	Eugene	269	‘ I ’ll do that better thing you suggested — for your sake . ’
407099	407109	407110	407110	Eugene	269	‘ Nothing short of force will make her go , ’
407122	407127	407128	407128	Eugene	269	‘ Dear old fellow , ’
407138	407255	407131	407131	Lightwood	287	‘ you could n’t have come at a better time , for my mind is full , and I want to empty it . First , of my present , before I touch upon my future . M. R. F. , who is a much younger cavalier than I , and a professed admirer of beauty , was so affable as to remark the other day ( he paid us a visit of two days up the river there , and much objected to the accommodation of the hotel ) , that Lizzie ought to have her portrait painted . Which , coming from M. R. F. , may be considered equivalent to a melodramatic blessing . ’
407256	407262	407264	407264	Mortimer	287	‘ You are getting well , ’
407270	407273	407275	407275	Eugene	269	‘ Really , ’
407277	407364	407275	407275	Eugene	269	‘ I mean it . When M. R. F. said that , and followed it up by rolling the claret ( for which he called , and I paid ) , in his mouth , and saying , “ My dear son , why do you drink this trash ? ” it was tantamount in him — to a paternal benediction on our union , accompanied with a gush of tears . The coolness of M. R. F. is not to be measured by ordinary standards . ’
407365	407369	407371	407371	Lightwood	287	‘ True enough , ’
407373	407378	407371	407371	Lightwood	287	‘ That ’s all , ’
407382	407540	407371	407371	Lightwood	287	‘ that I shall ever hear from M. R. F. on the subject , and he will continue to saunter through the world with his hat on one side . My marriage being thus solemnly recognized at the family altar , I have no further trouble on that score . Next , you really have done wonders for me , Mortimer , in easing my money - perplexities , and with such a guardian and steward beside me , as the preserver of my life ( I am hardly strong yet , you see , for I am not man enough to refer to her without a trembling voice — she is so inexpressibly dear to me , Mortimer ! ) , the little that I can call my own will be more than it ever has been . It need be more , for you know what it always has been in my hands . Nothing . ’
407541	407602	407371	407371	Lightwood	287	‘ Worse than nothing , I fancy , Eugene . My own small income ( I devoutly wish that my grandfather had left it to the Ocean rather than to me ! ) has been an effective Something , in the way of preventing me from turning to at Anything . And I think yours has been much the same . ’
407603	407611	407613	407613	Eugene	269	‘ There spake the voice of wisdom , ’
407615	407677	407613	407613	Eugene	269	‘ We are shepherds both . In turning to at last , we turn to in earnest . Let us say no more of that , for a few years to come . Now , I have had an idea , Mortimer , of taking myself and my wife to one of the colonies , and working at my vocation there . ’
407678	407694	407371	407371	Lightwood	287	‘ I should be lost without you , Eugene ; but you may be right . ’
407695	407698	407700	407700	Eugene	269	‘ No , ’
407704	407710	407711	407711	He	269	‘ Not right . Wrong ! ’
407731	407742	407743	407743	Eugene	269	‘ You think this thumped head of mine is excited ? ’
407752	407843	407743	407743	Eugene	269	‘ not so , believe me . I can say to you of the healthful music of my pulse what Hamlet said of his . My blood is up , but wholesomely up , when I think of it . Tell me ! Shall I turn coward to Lizzie , and sneak away with her , as if I were ashamed of her ! Where would your friend ’s part in this world be , Mortimer , if she had turned coward to him , and on immeasurably better occasion ? ’
407844	407849	407851	407851	Lightwood	287	‘ Honourable and stanch , ’
407853	407859	407851	407851	Lightwood	287	‘ And yet , Eugene — ’
407860	407867	407743	407743	Eugene	269	‘ And yet what , Mortimer ? ’
407868	407903	407743	407743	Eugene	269	‘ And yet , are you sure that you might not feel ( for her sake , I say for her sake ) any slight coldness towards her on the part of — Society ? ’
407904	407917	407919	407919	Eugene	269	‘ O ! You and I may well stumble at the word , ’
407923	407930	407919	407919	Eugene	269	‘ Do we mean our Tippins ? ’
407931	407936	407938	407938	Mortimer	287	‘ Perhaps we do , ’
407943	407949	407951	407951	Eugene	269	‘ Faith , we DO ! ’
407957	408112	407951	407951	Eugene	269	‘ We may hide behind the bush and beat about it , but we DO ! Now , my wife is something nearer to my heart , Mortimer , than Tippins is , and I owe her a little more than I owe to Tippins , and I am rather prouder of her than I ever was of Tippins . Therefore , I will fight it out to the last gasp , with her and for her , here , in the open field . When I hide her , or strike for her , faint - heartedly , in a hole or a corner , do you whom I love next best upon earth , tell me what I shall most righteously deserve to be told:—that she would have done well to turn me over with her foot that night when I lay bleeding to death , and spat in my dastard face . ’
408187	408225	408184	408184	she	494	‘ Eugene , dear , you made me go out , but I ought to have stayed with you . You are more flushed than you have been for many days . What have you been doing ? ’
408226	408229	408231	408231	Eugene	269	‘ Nothing , ’
408233	408242	408184	408184	she	494	‘ but looking forward to your coming back . ’
408243	408250	408252	408252	Lizzie	494	‘ And talking to Mr Lightwood , ’
408261	408273	408252	408252	Lizzie	494	‘ But it can not have been Society that disturbed you . ’
408274	408281	408283	408283	Eugene	269	‘ Faith , my dear love ! ’
408298	408307	408292	408292	he	269	‘ I rather think it WAS Society though ! ’
408899	408908	408910	408910	Podsnap	265	‘ We know what Russia means , sir , ’
408912	408940	408910	408910	Podsnap	265	‘ we know what France wants ; we see what America is up to ; but we know what England is . That ’s enough for us . ’

408991	408995	408997	408997	Lightwood	287	‘ Thank you , ’
408999	409010	408997	408997	Lightwood	287	‘ It made no complaint of being in pain anywhere . ’
409011	409021	409023	409024	Lady Tippins	268	‘ Say , how did you leave the savages ? ’
409026	409037	409039	409039	Lightwood	287	‘ They were becoming civilized when I left Juan Fernandez , ’
409041	409055	409039	409039	Lightwood	287	‘ At least they were eating one another , which looked like it . ’

409119	409124	409109	409109	Mortimer	287	‘ So I was ! ’

409182	409193	409195	409195	Mortimer	287	‘ However she got to it , she graced it , ’
409210	409238	409197	409198	Lady Tippins	268	‘ Graced it ! Take care of me if I faint , Veneering . He means to tell us , that a horrid female waterman is graceful ! ’
409239	409253	409255	409255	Lightwood	287	‘ Pardon me . I mean to tell you nothing , Lady Tippins , ’
409273	409287	409289	409290	Lady Tippins	268	‘ You shall not escape me in this way , you morose backwoodsman , ’
409292	409356	409289	409290	Lady Tippins	268	‘ You shall not evade the question , to screen your friend Eugene , who has made this exhibition of himself . The knowledge shall be brought home to you that such a ridiculous affair is condemned by the voice of Society . My dear Mrs Veneering , do let us resolve ourselves into a Committee of the whole House on the subject . ’
409369	409389	409390	409390	Veneering	260	‘ Oh yes ! Do let us resolve ourselves into a Committee of the whole House ! So delicious ! ’
409393	409412	409390	409390	Veneering	260	‘ As many as are of that opinion , say Aye,—contrary , No — the Ayes have it . ’
409423	409432	409434	409435	Lady Tippins	268	‘ Now , I am Chairwoman of Committees ! ’
409438	409444	409446	409447	Mrs Veneering	260	‘ What spirits she has ! ’
409456	409460	409462	409464	the sprightly one	8519	‘ And this , ’
409466	409537	409462	409464	the sprightly one	8519	‘ is a Committee of the whole House to what - you - may - call - it — elicit , I suppose — the voice of Society . The question before the Committee is , whether a young man of very fair family , good appearance , and some talent , makes a fool or a wise man of himself in marrying a female waterman , turned factory girl . ’
409538	409545	409446	409447	Mrs Veneering	260	‘ Hardly so , I think , ’
409552	409629	409546	409548	the stubborn Mortimer	8520	‘ I take the question to be , whether such a man as you describe , Lady Tippins , does right or wrong in marrying a brave woman ( I say nothing of her beauty ) , who has saved his life , with a wonderful energy and address ; whom he knows to be virtuous , and possessed of remarkable qualities ; whom he has long admired , and who is deeply attached to him . ’
409630	409636	409638	409638	Podsnap	265	‘ But , excuse me , ’
409652	409662	409638	409638	Podsnap	265	‘ was this young woman ever a female waterman ? ’
409663	409680	409684	409686	the young woman	4992	‘ Never . But she sometimes rowed in a boat with her father , I believe . ’

409737	409753	409698	409698	Buffer	276	‘ Never . But she had some employment in a paper mill , I believe . ’
409761	409765	409766	409766	Boots	262	‘ Oh dear ! ’
409769	409773	409766	409766	Boots	262	‘ Oh dear ! ’
409777	409781	409774	409774	Buffer	276	‘ Oh dear ! ’
409791	409800	409802	409802	Podsnap	265	‘ Then all I have to say is , ’
409813	409847	409802	409802	Podsnap	265	‘ that my gorge rises against such a marriage — that it offends and disgusts me — that it makes me sick — and that I desire to know no more about it . ’
409849	409854	409856	409856	Mortimer	287	‘ Now I wonder , ’
409860	409869	409856	409856	Mortimer	287	‘ whether YOU are the Voice of Society ! ’
409871	409878	409880	409881	Lady Tippins	268	‘ Hear , hear , hear ! ’
409883	409902	409880	409881	Lady Tippins	268	‘ Your opinion of this MESALLIANCE , honourable colleagues of the honourable member who has just sat down ? ’
409957	409988	410001	410002	the Voice	8526	’ Mrs Podsnap stops there , delicately intimating that every such man should look out for a fine woman as nearly resembling herself as he may hope to discover . ( ‘
409993	409997	409990	409990	I	0	’ thinks Mortimer , ‘
410004	410368	410001	410002	the Voice	8526	’ ) Lady Tippins next canvasses the Contractor , of five hundred thousand power . It appears to this potentate , that what the man in question should have done , would have been , to buy the young woman a boat and a small annuity , and set her up for herself . These things are a question of beefsteaks and porter . You buy the young woman a boat . Very good . You buy her , at the same time , a small annuity . You speak of that annuity in pounds sterling , but it is in reality so many pounds of beefsteaks and so many pints of porter . On the one hand , the young woman has the boat . On the other hand , she consumes so many pounds of beefsteaks and so many pints of porter . Those beefsteaks and that porter are the fuel to that young woman ’s engine . She derives therefrom a certain amount of power to row the boat ; that power will produce so much money ; you add that to the small annuity ; and thus you get at the young woman ’s income . That ( it seems to the Contractor ) is the way of looking at it . The fair enslaver having fallen into one of her gentle sleeps during the last exposition , nobody likes to wake her . Fortunately , she comes awake of herself , and puts the question to the Wandering Chairman . The Wanderer can only speak of the case as if it were his own . If such a young woman as the young woman described , had saved his own life , he would have been very much obliged to her , would n’t have married her , and would have got her a berth in an Electric Telegraph Office , where young women answer very well . What does the Genius of the three hundred and seventy - five thousand pounds , no shillings , and nopence , think ? He ca n’t say what he thinks , without asking : Had the young woman any money ? ‘
410371	410380	410001	410002	the Voice	8526	’ says Lightwood , in an uncompromising voice ; ‘
410384	410385	410001	410002	the Voice	8526	’ ‘
410390	410400	410001	410002	the Voice	8526	’ is then the compressed verdict of the Genius . ‘
410416	410551	410552	410552	I	0	’ What does Boots say ? Boots says he would n’t have done it under twenty thousand pound . What does Brewer say ? Brewer says what Boots says . What does Buffer say ? Buffer says he knows a man who married a bathing - woman , and bolted . Lady Tippins fancies she has collected the suffrages of the whole Committee ( nobody dreaming of asking the Veneerings for their opinion ) , when , looking round the table through her eyeglass , she perceives Mr Twemlow with his hand to his forehead . Good gracious ! My Twemlow forgotten ! My dearest ! My own ! What is his vote ? Twemlow has the air of being ill at ease , as he takes his hand from his forehead and replies . ‘
410558	410562	410552	410552	I	0	’ says he , ‘
410575	410576	410552	410552	I	0	’ ‘
410589	410593	410577	410578	A gentleman	8943	’ flushes Podsnap . ‘
410599	410609	410597	410597	sir	8755	’ says Twemlow , rather less mildly than usual , ‘
410648	410649	410650	410651	This lady	9538	’ ‘
410653	410657	410650	410651	This lady	9538	’ echoes Podsnap . ‘
410660	410671	410672	410672	YOU	8755	’ returns Twemlow , with his wristbands bristling a little , ‘
410698	410721	410722	410722	I	0	’ This being something in the nature of a poser for Podsnap , he merely waves it away with a speechless wave . ‘
410725	410729	410722	410722	I	0	’ resumes Twemlow , ‘
410825	410826	410827	410827	I	0	’ ‘
410833	410837	410850	410851	Mr Podsnap	438	’ sneers Podsnap , ‘

410853	410857	410859	410859	me	0	’ retorts Twemlow , ‘
410902	410955	410956	410956	I	0	’ Somehow , a canopy of wet blanket seems to descend upon the company , and Lady Tippins was never known to turn so very greedy or so very cross . Mortimer Lightwood alone brightens . He has been asking himself , as to every other member of the Committee in turn , ‘
410964	411514	410961	410962	the Voice	8526	’ But he does not ask himself the question after Twemlow has spoken , and he glances in Twemlow ’s direction as if he were grateful . When the company disperse — by which time Mr and Mrs Veneering have had quite as much as they want of the honour , and the guests have had quite as much as THEY want of the other honour — Mortimer sees Twemlow home , shakes hands with him cordially at parting , and fares to the Temple , gaily . POSTSCRIPT IN LIEU OF PREFACE When I devised this story , I foresaw the likelihood that a class of readers and commentators would suppose that I was at great pains to conceal exactly what I was at great pains to suggest : namely , that Mr John Harmon was not slain , and that Mr John Rokesmith was he . Pleasing myself with the idea that the supposition might in part arise out of some ingenuity in the story , and thinking it worth while , in the interests of art , to hint to an audience that an artist ( of whatever denomination ) may perhaps be trusted to know what he is about in his vocation , if they will concede him a little patience , I was not alarmed by the anticipation . To keep for a long time unsuspected , yet always working itself out , another purpose originating in that leading incident , and turning it to a pleasant and useful account at last , was at once the most interesting and the most difficult part of my design . Its difficulty was much enhanced by the mode of publication ; for , it would be very unreasonable to expect that many readers , pursuing a story in portions from month to month through nineteen months , will , until they have it before them complete , perceive the relations of its finer threads to the whole pattern which is always before the eyes of the story - weaver at his loom . Yet , that I hold the advantages of the mode of publication to outweigh its disadvantages , may be easily believed of one who revived it in the Pickwick Papers after long disuse , and has pursued it ever since . There is sometimes an odd disposition in this country to dispute as improbable in fiction , what are the commonest experiences in fact . Therefore , I note here , though it may not be at all necessary , that there are hundreds of Will Cases ( as they are called ) , far more remarkable than that fancied in this book ; and that the stores of the Prerogative Office teem with instances of testators who have made , changed , contradicted , hidden , forgotten , left cancelled , and left uncancelled , each many more wills than were ever made by the elder Mr Harmon of Harmony Jail . In my social experiences since Mrs Betty Higden came upon the scene and left it , I have found Circumlocutional champions disposed to be warm with me on the subject of my view of the Poor Law . My friend Mr Bounderby could never see any difference between leaving the Coketown ‘
