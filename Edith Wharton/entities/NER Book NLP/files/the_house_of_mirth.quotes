278	286	287	287	She	109	“ Mr. Selden — what good luck ! ”
430	434	435	435	she	109	“ What luck ! ”
438	449	435	435	she	109	“ How nice of you to come to my rescue ! ”
473	529	530	530	She	109	“ Oh , almost any — even to sitting on a bench and talking to me . One sits out a cotillion — why not sit out a train ? It is n’t a bit hotter here than in Mrs. Van Osburgh ’s conservatory — and some of the women are not a bit uglier . ”
570	582	583	583	She	109	“ And there is n’t another till half - past five . ”
593	653	583	583	She	109	“ Just two hours to wait . And I do n’t know what to do with myself . My maid came up this morning to do some shopping for me , and was to go on to Bellomont at one o’clock , and my aunt ’s house is closed , and I do n’t know a soul in town . ”
661	691	654	654	She	109	“ It IS hotter than Mrs. Van Osburgh ’s , after all . If you can spare the time , do take me somewhere for a breath of air . ”
747	761	762	762	She	109	“ Shall we go over to Sherry ’s for a cup of tea ? ”
773	825	826	826	she	109	“ So many people come up to town on a Monday — one is sure to meet a lot of bores . I ’m as old as the hills , of course , and it ought not to make any difference ; but if I’M old enough , you ’re not , ”
830	845	826	826	she	109	“ I ’m dying for tea — but is n’t there a quieter place ? ”
896	901	913	913	he	320	“ argument from design . ”
902	912	913	913	he	320	“ The resources of New York are rather meagre , ”
916	932	913	913	he	320	“ but I ’ll find a hansom first , and then we ’ll invent something . ”
1018	1028	1029	1029	she	109	“ How delicious ! Let us walk a little , ”
1267	1288	1261	1261	she	109	“ Oh , dear , I ’m so hot and thirsty — and what a hideous place New York is ! ”
1299	1320	1289	1289	She	109	“ Other cities put on their best clothes in summer , but New York seems to sit in its shirtsleeves . ”
1331	1352	1321	1321	Her	109	“ Someone has had the humanity to plant a few trees over there . Let us go into the shade . ”
1353	1364	1366	1366	Selden	108	“ I am glad my street meets with your approval , ”
1373	1382	1383	1383	She	109	“ Your street ? Do you live here ? ”
1420	1450	1451	1451	She	109	“ Ah , yes — to be sure : THE BENEDICK . What a nice - looking building ! I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen it before . ”
1469	1481	1451	1451	She	109	“ Which are your windows ? Those with the awnings down ? ”
1482	1490	1451	1451	She	109	“ On the top floor — yes . ”
1491	1507	1508	1508	He	108	“ And that nice little balcony is yours ? How cool it looks up there ! ”
1513	1519	1520	1520	he	108	“ Come up and see , ”
1523	1544	1520	1520	he	108	“ I can give you a cup of tea in no time — and you wo n’t meet any bores . ”
1573	1587	1588	1588	she	109	“ Why not ? It ’s too tempting — I’ll take the risk , ”
1591	1599	1600	1600	he	108	“ Oh , I ’m not dangerous , ”
1670	1710	1711	1711	He	108	“ There ’s no one here ; but I have a servant who is supposed to come in the mornings , and it ’s just possible he may have put out the tea - things and provided some cake . ”
1831	1857	1858	1858	She	109	“ How delicious to have a place like this all to one ’s self ! What a miserable thing it is to be a woman . ”
1877	1881	1882	1882	he	108	“ Even women , ”
1885	1897	1882	1882	he	108	“ have been known to enjoy the privileges of a flat . ”
1898	1918	1867	1867	Selden	108	“ Oh , governesses — or widows . But not girls — not poor , miserable , marriageable girls ! ”
1919	1931	1932	1932	She	109	“ I even know a girl who lives in a flat . ”
1938	1942	1932	1932	She	109	“ You do ? ”
1943	1947	1948	1948	he	108	“ I do , ”
1963	1974	1948	1948	he	108	“ Oh , I know — you mean Gerty Farish . ”
1981	2028	1975	1975	She	109	“ But I said MARRIAGEABLE — and besides , she has a horrid little place , and no maid , and such queer things to eat . Her cook does the washing and the food tastes of soap . I should hate that , you know . ”
2029	2041	2043	2043	Selden	108	“ You should n’t dine with her on wash - days , ”
2169	2181	2182	2182	she	109	“ It was horrid of me to say that of Gerty , ”
2188	2290	2182	2182	she	109	“ I forgot she was your cousin . But we ’re so different , you know : she likes being good , and I like being happy . And besides , she is free and I am not . If I were , I daresay I could manage to be happy even in her flat . It must be pure bliss to arrange the furniture just as one likes , and give all the horrors to the ash - man . If I could only do over my aunt ’s drawing - room I know I should be a better woman . ”
2291	2298	2299	2299	he	341	“ Is it so very bad ? ”
2321	2337	2303	2303	She	342	“ That shows how seldom you come there . Why do n’t you come oftener ? ”
2338	2355	2182	2182	she	109	“ When I do come , it ’s not to look at Mrs. Peniston ’s furniture . ”
2356	2359	2360	2360	she	342	“ Nonsense , ”
2363	2382	2360	2360	she	342	“ You do n’t come at all — and yet we get on so well when we meet . ”
2383	2390	2391	2391	he	341	“ Perhaps that ’s the reason , ”
2395	2417	2391	2391	he	341	“ I ’m afraid I have n’t any cream , you know — shall you mind a slice of lemon instead ? ”
2418	2425	2426	2426	She	342	“ I shall like it better . ”
2442	2450	2451	2451	she	342	“ But that is not the reason , ”
2454	2460	2451	2451	she	342	“ The reason for what ? ”
2461	2467	2468	2468	She	342	“ For your never coming . ”
2481	2534	2535	2535	She	342	“ I wish I knew — I wish I could make you out . Of course I know there are men who do n’t like me — one can tell that at a glance . And there are others who are afraid of me : they think I want to marry them . ”
2542	2564	2535	2535	She	342	“ But I do n’t think you dislike me — and you ca n’t possibly think I want to marry you . ”
2565	2574	2575	2575	he	341	“ No — I absolve you of that , ”
2578	2585	2575	2575	he	341	“ Well , then — — ? ”
2688	2693	2694	2694	he	341	“ Well , then , ”
2700	2707	2694	2694	he	341	“ perhaps THAT ’S the reason . ”
2708	2711	2694	2694	he	341	“ What ? ”
2712	2741	2742	2742	He	341	“ The fact that you do n’t want to marry me . Perhaps I do n’t regard it as such a strong inducement to go and see you . ”
2761	2794	2795	2795	She	342	“ Dear Mr. Selden , that was n’t worthy of you . It ’s stupid of you to make love to me , and it is n’t like you to be stupid . ”
2832	2838	2839	2839	she	342	“ Do n’t you see , ”
2842	2922	2839	2839	she	342	“ that there are men enough to say pleasant things to me , and that what I want is a friend who wo n’t be afraid to say disagreeable ones when I need them ? Sometimes I have fancied you might be that friend — I do n’t know why , except that you are neither a prig nor a bounder , and that I should n’t have to pretend with you or be on my guard against you . ”
2948	2961	2962	2962	she	342	“ You do n’t know how much I need such a friend , ”
2965	3063	2962	2962	she	342	“ My aunt is full of copy - book axioms , but they were all meant to apply to conduct in the early fifties . I always feel that to live up to them would include wearing book - muslin with gigot sleeves . And the other women — my best friends — well , they use me or abuse me ; but they do n’t care a straw what happens to me . I ’ve been about too long — people are getting tired of me ; they are beginning to say I ought to marry . ”
3100	3108	3109	3109	She	349	“ Well , why do n’t you ? ”
3114	3139	3109	3109	She	349	“ Ah , I see you ARE a friend after all , and that is one of the disagreeable things I was asking for . ”
3140	3149	3150	3150	he	115	“ It was n’t meant to be disagreeable , ”
3154	3172	3173	3173	She	349	“ Is n’t marriage your vocation ? Is n’t it what you ’re all brought up for ? ”
3176	3186	3173	3173	She	349	“ I suppose so . What else is there ? ”
3187	3202	3203	3203	She	349	“ Exactly . And so why not take the plunge and have it over ? ”
3208	3224	3203	3203	She	349	“ You speak as if I ought to marry the first man who came along . ”
3225	3254	3255	3255	She	349	“ I did n’t mean to imply that you are as hard put to it as that . But there must be some one with the requisite qualifications . ”
3261	3303	3255	3255	She	349	“ I threw away one or two good chances when I first came out — I suppose every girl does ; and you know I am horribly poor — and very expensive . I must have a great deal of money . ”
3318	3325	3326	3326	he	115	“ What ’s become of Dillworth ? ”
3329	3366	3326	3326	he	115	“ Oh , his mother was frightened — she was afraid I should have all the family jewels reset . And she wanted me to promise that I would n’t do over the drawing - room . ”
3367	3376	3449	3449	She	350	“ The very thing you are marrying for ! ”
3377	3388	3449	3449	She	350	“ Exactly . So she packed him off to India . ”
3389	3401	3402	3402	He	115	“ Hard luck — but you can do better than Dillworth . ”
3437	3448	3449	3449	She	350	“ Have I time ? Just a whiff , then . ”
3593	3609	3585	3585	she	350	“ You collect , do n’t you — you know about first editions and things ? ”
3610	3647	3648	3648	She	350	“ As much as a man may who has no money to spend . Now and then I pick up something in the rubbish heap ; and I go and look on at the big sales . ”
3677	3686	3669	3669	she	350	“ And Americana — do you collect Americana ? ”
3692	3728	3729	3729	She	350	“ No , that ’s rather out of my line . I ’m not really a collector , you see ; I simply like to have good editions of the books I am fond of . ”
3735	3745	3729	3729	She	350	“ And Americana are horribly dull , I suppose ? ”
3746	3790	3791	3791	She	350	“ I should fancy so — except to the historian . But your real collector values a thing for its rarity . I do n’t suppose the buyers of Americana sit up reading them all night — old Jefferson Gryce certainly did n’t . ”
3798	3849	3791	3791	She	350	“ And yet they fetch fabulous prices , do n’t they ? It seems so odd to want to pay a lot for an ugly badly - printed book that one is never going to read ! And I suppose most of the owners of Americana are not historians either ? ”
3850	3891	3892	3892	He	353	“ No ; very few of the historians can afford to buy them . They have to use those in the public libraries or in private collections . It seems to be the mere rarity that attracts the average collector . ”
4103	4110	4111	4111	she	350	“ Do n’t you ever mind , ”
4115	4128	4111	4111	she	350	“ not being rich enough to buy all the books you want ? ”
4145	4162	4129	4129	He	353	“ Do n’t I just ? Do you take me for a saint on a pillar ? ”
4163	4174	4131	4131	her	350	“ And having to work — do you mind that ? ”
4175	4193	4131	4131	her	350	“ Oh , the work itself is not so bad — I’m rather fond of the law . ”
4194	4221	4129	4129	He	353	“ No ; but the being tied down : the routine — don’t you ever want to get away , to see new places and people ? ”
4222	4237	4238	4238	She	350	“ Horribly — especially when I see all my friends rushing to the steamer . ”
4244	4259	4238	4238	She	350	“ But do you mind enough — to marry to get out of it ? ”
4266	4270	4271	4271	he	353	“ God forbid ! ”
4287	4306	4307	4307	She	350	“ Ah , there ’s the difference — a girl must , a man may if he chooses . ”
4312	4423	4307	4307	She	350	“ Your coat ’s a little shabby — but who cares ? It does n’t keep people from asking you to dine . If I were shabby no one would have me : a woman is asked out as much for her clothes as for herself . The clothes are the background , the frame , if you like : they do n’t make success , but they are a part of it . Who wants a dingy woman ? We are expected to be pretty and well - dressed till we drop — and if we ca n’t keep it up alone , we have to go into partnership . ”
4452	4485	4486	4486	She	350	“ Ah , well , there must be plenty of capital on the look - out for such an investment . Perhaps you ’ll meet your fate tonight at the Trenors ’ . ”
4492	4535	4486	4486	She	350	“ I thought you might be going there — oh , not in that capacity ! But there are to be a lot of your set — Gwen Van Osburgh , the Wetheralls , Lady Cressida Raith — and the George Dorsets . ”
4558	4584	4536	4536	She	350	“ Mrs. Trenor asked me ; but I ca n’t get away till the end of the week ; and those big parties bore me . ”
4585	4593	4594	4594	she	350	“ Ah , so they do me , ”
4597	4602	4594	4594	she	350	“ Then why go ? ”
4603	4634	4536	4536	She	350	“ It ’s part of the business — you forget ! And besides , if I did n’t , I should be playing bezique with my aunt at Richfield Springs . ”
4635	4645	4646	4646	he	115	“ That ’s almost as bad as marrying Dillworth , ”
4667	4681	4661	4661	She	350	“ Dear me ! I must be off . It ’s after five . ”
4792	4808	4779	4779	she	350	“ It ’s been delightful ; and now you will have to return my visit . ”
4809	4823	4779	4779	she	350	“ But do n’t you want me to see you to the station ? ”
4824	4833	4834	4834	She	350	“ No ; good bye here , please . ”
4850	4862	4863	4863	he	115	“ Good bye , then — and good luck at Bellomont ! ”
5027	5033	5035	5035	Lily	109	“ I beg your pardon , ”
5279	5293	5294	5294	he	383	“ Miss Bart ? Well — of all people ! This IS luck , ”
5312	5322	5323	5323	she	109	“ Oh , Mr. Rosedale — how are you ? ”
5408	5421	5422	5422	he	383	“ Been up to town for a little shopping , I suppose ? ”
5451	5479	5446	5446	herself	109	“ Yes — I came up to see my dress - maker . I am just on my way to catch the train to the Trenors ’ . ”
5480	5491	5492	5492	he	383	“ Ah — your dress - maker ; just so , ”
5496	5511	5492	5492	he	383	“ I did n’t know there were any dress - makers in the Benedick . ”
5512	5516	5517	5517	She	109	“ The Benedick ? ”
5522	5531	5517	5517	She	109	“ Is that the name of this building ? ”
5532	5568	5569	5569	His	383	“ Yes , that ’s the name : I believe it ’s an old word for bachelor , is n’t it ? I happen to own the building — that ’s the way I know . ”
5579	5622	5573	5573	he	383	“ But you must let me take you to the station . The Trenors are at Bellomont , of course ? You ’ve barely time to catch the five - forty . The dress - maker kept you waiting , I suppose . ”
5629	5634	5635	5635	she	109	“ Oh , thanks , ”
5661	5676	5677	5677	she	109	“ You ’re very kind ; but I could n’t think of troubling you , ”
6193	6194	6207	6207	his	124	“ crushes”—Rosedale
6361	6364	6356	6357	Mr. Rosedale	124	“ impossible , ”

7136	7163	7164	7164	She	109	“ Oh , Mr. Gryce , is it you ? I ’m so sorry — I was trying to find the porter and get some tea . ”
7258	7271	7272	7272	she	109	“ The chair next to mine is empty — do take it , ”
7304	7321	7322	7322	She	109	“ Ah — and here is the porter , and perhaps we can have some tea . ”
7550	7564	7565	7565	she	109	“ Is it quite right — I have n’t made it too strong ? ”
7582	7589	7590	7590	she	109	“ I daresay it is true , ”
7921	7925	7926	7926	she	109	“ And how , ”
7932	7941	7926	7926	she	109	“ are you getting on with your Americana ? ”
7973	7982	7983	7983	he	127	“ I ’ve got a few new things , ”

But I MUST have a seat in this carriage — porter , you must find me a place at once . Ca n’t some one be put somewhere else ? I want to be with my friends . Oh , how do you do , Mr. Gryce ? Do please make him understand that I must have a seat next to you and Lily . ”
9813	9837	9838	9838	she	131	“ And at this hour of the day I do n’t suppose you ’ve a single one left , have you , Lily ? ”
9862	9870	9871	9871	she	131	“ What an absurd question , Bertha ! ”
9890	9934	9871	9871	she	131	“ Why , do n’t you smoke ? Since when have you given it up ? What — you never — — And you do n’t either , Mr. Gryce ? Ah , of course — how stupid of me — I understand . ”

13348	13354	13355	13355	Lily	109	“ I was only saying , ”
13358	13403	13404	13404	She	109	“ that I hate to see faded flowers at luncheon ; and mother says a bunch of lilies - of - the - valley would not cost more than twelve dollars . May n’t I tell the florist to send a few every day ? ”
13523	13549	13550	13550	He	137	“ Twelve dollars — twelve dollars a day for flowers ? Oh , certainly , my dear — give him an order for twelve hundred . ”
13563	13577	13578	13578	she	109	“ You need n’t wait , Poleworth — I will ring for you , ”

13655	13660	13661	13661	she	109	“ Are you ill ? ”
13664	13675	13676	13676	he	609	“ Ill ? — — No , I ’m ruined , ”

13715	13721	13722	13722	she	109	“ Shut the pantry door , ”
13802	13837	13838	13838	she	136	“ Your father is not well — he does n’t know what he is saying . It is nothing — but you had better go upstairs ; and do n’t talk to the servants , ”
14122	14145	14115	14116	Mrs. Bart	136	“ You are sorry for him now — but you will feel differently when you see what he has done to us . ”

15203	15232	15233	15233	she	109	“ Do n’t let it creep up on you and drag you down . Fight your way out of it somehow — you’re young and can do it , ”
15326	15335	15319	15320	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ I ’ll try her for a year . ”

16792	16824	16781	16782	her hostess	745	“ if it is not too much of a bore to be down by ten , will you come to my sitting - room to help me with some tiresome things ? ”
17273	17284	17285	17285	she	123	“ Oh , Lily , that ’s nice of you , ”
17315	17325	17326	17326	she	123	“ There are such lots of horrors this morning , ”
17538	17541	17558	17559	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ go back ”
17545	17557	17558	17559	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ It was simply inhuman of Pragg to go off now , ”
17571	17915	17558	17559	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ She says her sister is going to have a baby — as if that were anything to having a house - party ! I ’m sure I shall get most horribly mixed up and there will be some awful rows . When I was down at Tuxedo I asked a lot of people for next week , and I ’ve mislaid the list and ca n’t remember who is coming . And this week is going to be a horrid failure too — and Gwen Van Osburgh will go back and tell her mother how bored people were . I did mean to ask the Wetheralls — that was a blunder of Gus ’s . They disapprove of Carry Fisher , you know . As if one could help having Carry Fisher ! It WAS foolish of her to get that second divorce — Carry always overdoes things — but she said the only way to get a penny out of Fisher was to divorce him and make him pay alimony . And poor Carry has to consider every dollar . It ’s really absurd of Alice Wetherall to make such a fuss about meeting her , when one thinks of what society is coming to . Some one said the other day that there was a divorce and a case of appendicitis in every family one knows . Besides , Carry is the only person who can keep Gus in a good humour when we have bores in the house . Have you noticed that ALL the husbands like her ? All , I mean , except her own . It ’s rather clever of her to have made a specialty of devoting herself to dull people — the field is such a large one , and she has it practically to herself . She finds compensations , no doubt — I know she borrows money of Gus — but then I ’d PAY her to keep him in a good humour , so I ca n’t complain , after all . ”
17934	17944	17945	17945	she	123	“ But it is only the Wetheralls and Carry , ”
17955	17969	17945	17945	she	123	“ The truth is , I ’m awfully disappointed in Lady Cressida Raith . ”
17970	17979	17558	17559	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ Disappointed ? Had you known her before ? ”
17980	18259	18260	18261	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ Mercy , no — never saw her till yesterday . Lady Skiddaw sent her over with letters to the Van Osburghs , and I heard that Maria Van Osburgh was asking a big party to meet her this week , so I thought it would be fun to get her away , and Jack Stepney , who knew her in India , managed it for me . Maria was furious , and actually had the impudence to make Gwen invite herself here , so that they should n’t be QUITE out of it — if I ’d known what Lady Cressida was like , they could have had her and welcome ! But I thought any friend of the Skiddaws ’ was sure to be amusing . You remember what fun Lady Skiddaw was ? There were times when I simply had to send the girls out of the room . Besides , Lady Cressida is the Duchess of Beltshire ’s sister , and I naturally supposed she was the same sort ; but you never can tell in those English families . They are so big that there ’s room for all kinds , and it turns out that Lady Cressida is the moral one — married a clergyman and does missionary work in the East End . Think of my taking such a lot of trouble about a clergyman ’s wife , who wears Indian jewelry and botanizes ! She made Gus take her all through the glass - houses yesterday , and bothered him to death by asking him the names of the plants . Fancy treating Gus as if he were the gardener ! ”
18271	18288	18290	18291	Miss Bart	109	“ Oh , well , perhaps Lady Cressida will reconcile the Wetheralls to meeting Carry Fisher , ”
18294	18383	18385	18386	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ I ’m sure I hope so ! But she is boring all the men horribly , and if she takes to distributing tracts , as I hear she does , it will be too depressing . The worst of it is that she would have been so useful at the right time . You know we have to have the Bishop once a year , and she would have given just the right tone to things . I always have horrid luck about the Bishop ’s visits , ”
18402	18438	18385	18386	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ last year , when he came , Gus forgot all about his being here , and brought home the Ned Wintons and the Farleys — five divorces and six sets of children between them ! ”
18439	18446	18447	18447	Lily	109	“ When is Lady Cressida going ? ”
18459	18504	18450	18451	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ My dear , if one only knew ! I was in such a hurry to get her away from Maria that I actually forgot to name a date , and Gus says she told some one she meant to stop here all winter . ”
18505	18514	18385	18386	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ To stop here ? In this house ? ”
18515	18540	18385	18386	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ Do n’t be silly — in America . But if no one else asks her — you know they NEVER go to hotels . ”
18541	18551	18450	18451	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ Perhaps Gus only said it to frighten you . ”
18552	18617	18385	18386	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ No — I heard her tell Bertha Dorset that she had six months to put in while her husband was taking the cure in the Engadine . You should have seen Bertha look vacant ! But it ’s no joke , you know — if she stays here all the autumn she ’ll spoil everything , and Maria Van Osburgh will simply exult . ”
18632	18647	18622	18623	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ Oh , Judy — as if any one were ever bored at Bellomont ! ”
18653	18694	18648	18649	Miss Bart	109	“ You know perfectly well that , if Mrs. Van Osburgh were to get all the right people and leave you with all the wrong ones , you ’d manage to make things go off , and she would n’t . ”
18721	18729	18730	18730	she	123	“ It is n’t only Lady Cressida , ”
18733	18752	18730	18730	she	123	“ Everything has gone wrong this week . I can see that Bertha Dorset is furious with me . ”
18753	18760	18648	18649	Miss Bart	109	“ Furious with you ? Why ? ”
18761	18793	18794	18795	Miss Bart	109	“ Because I told her that Lawrence Selden was coming ; but he would n’t , after all , and she ’s quite unreasonable enough to think it ’s my fault . ”
18811	18819	18820	18820	she	109	“ I thought that was all over , ”
18823	18903	18820	18820	she	109	“ So it is , on his side . And of course Bertha has been idle since . But I fancy she ’s out of a job just at present — and some one gave me a hint that I had better ask Lawrence . Well , I DID ask him — but I could n’t make him come ; and now I suppose she ’ll take it out of me by being perfectly nasty to every one else . ”
18904	18924	18925	18926	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ Oh , she may take it out of HIM by being perfectly charming — to some one else . ”
18932	18997	18925	18926	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ She knows he would n’t mind . And who else is there ? Alice Wetherall wo n’t let Lucius out of her sight . Ned Silverton ca n’t take his eyes off Carry Fisher — poor boy ! Gus is bored by Bertha , Jack Stepney knows her too well — and — well , to be sure , there ’s Percy Gryce ! ”
19016	19032	19006	19007	Miss Bart	109	“ Oh , she and Mr. Gryce would not be likely to hit it off . ”
19033	19087	19088	19088	Lily	109	“ You mean that she ’d shock him and he ’d bore her ? Well , that ’s not such a bad beginning , you know . But I hope she wo n’t take it into her head to be nice to him , for I asked him here on purpose for you . ”
19091	19105	19088	19088	Lily	109	“ MERCI DU COMPLIMENT ! I should certainly have no show against Bertha . ”
19106	19162	19163	19164	Miss Bart	109	“ Do you think I am uncomplimentary ? I ’m not really , you know . Every one knows you ’re a thousand times handsomer and cleverer than Bertha ; but then you ’re not nasty . And for always getting what she wants in the long run , commend me to a nasty woman . ”
19170	19180	19163	19164	Miss Bart	109	“ I thought you were so fond of Bertha . ”
19181	19242	19163	19164	Miss Bart	109	“ Oh , I am — it ’s much safer to be fond of dangerous people . But she IS dangerous — and if I ever saw her up to mischief it ’s now . I can tell by poor George ’s manner . That man is a perfect barometer — he always knows when Bertha is going to — — ”
19243	19247	19248	19249	Miss Bart	109	“ To fall ? ”
19252	19294	19248	19249	Miss Bart	109	“ Do n’t be shocking ! You know he believes in her still . And of course I do n’t say there ’s any real harm in Bertha . Only she delights in making people miserable , and especially poor George . ”
19295	19316	19163	19164	Miss Bart	109	“ Well , he seems cut out for the part — I do n’t wonder she likes more cheerful companionship . ”
19317	19386	19387	19388	Miss Bart	109	“ Oh , George is not as dismal as you think . If Bertha did worry him he would be quite different . Or if she ’d leave him alone , and let him arrange his life as he pleases . But she does n’t dare lose her hold of him on account of the money , and so when HE is n’t jealous she pretends to be . ”
19408	19413	19414	19414	she	745	“ Do you know , ”
19421	19440	19414	19414	she	745	“ I believe I ’ll call up Lawrence on the telephone and tell him he simply MUST come ? ”
19441	19447	19449	19449	Lily	109	“ Oh , do n’t , ”
19489	19509	19468	19469	her hostess	745	“ Good gracious , Lily , how handsome you are ! Why ? Do you dislike him so much ? ”
19510	19543	19544	19545	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ Not at all ; I like him . But if you are actuated by the benevolent intention of protecting me from Bertha — I do n’t think I need your protection . ”
19552	19566	19544	19545	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ Lily!——PERCY ? Do you mean to say you ’ve actually done it ? ”
19571	19590	19567	19568	Miss Bart	109	“ I only mean to say that Mr. Gryce and I are getting to be very good friends . ”
19591	19597	19598	19599	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ H’m — I see . ”
19607	19654	19598	19599	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ You know they say he has eight hundred thousand a year — and spends nothing , except on some rubbishy old books . And his mother has heart - disease and will leave him a lot more . OH , LILY , DO GO SLOWLY , ”
19668	19676	19677	19677	she	109	“ I should n’t , for instance , ”
19680	19698	19677	19677	she	109	“ be in any haste to tell him that he had a lot of rubbishy old books . ”
19699	19733	19781	19782	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ No , of course not ; I know you ’re wonderful about getting up people ’s subjects . But he ’s horribly shy , and easily shocked , and — and — — ”
19734	19758	19781	19782	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ Why do n’t you say it , Judy ? I have the reputation of being on the hunt for a rich husband ? ”
19759	19779	19781	19782	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ Oh , I do n’t mean that ; he would n’t believe it of you — at first , ”
19788	19858	19781	19782	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ But you know things are rather lively here at times — I must give Jack and Gus a hint — and if he thought you were what his mother would call fast — oh , well , you know what I mean . Do n’t wear your scarlet CREPE - DE - CHINE for dinner , and do n’t smoke if you can help it , Lily dear ! ”
19870	19924	19859	19859	Lily	109	“ You ’re very kind , Judy : I ’ll lock up my cigarettes and wear that last year ’s dress you sent me this morning . And if you are really interested in my career , perhaps you ’ll be kind enough not to ask me to play bridge again this evening . ”
19925	19981	19983	19984	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ Bridge ? Does he mind bridge , too ? Oh , Lily , what an awful life you ’ll lead ! But of course I won’t — why did n’t you give me a hint last night ? There ’s nothing I would n’t do , you poor duck , to see you happy ! ”
20007	20013	20014	20014	she	123	“ You ’re quite sure , ”
20024	20037	20014	20014	she	123	“ that you would n’t like me to telephone for Lawrence Selden ? ”
20038	20042	20044	20044	Lily	109	“ Quite sure , ”

20921	20927	20928	20928	Lily	109	“ How impatient men are ! ”
20931	20987	20928	20928	Lily	109	“ All Jack has to do to get everything he wants is to keep quiet and let that girl marry him ; whereas I have to calculate and contrive , and retreat and advance , as if I were going through an intricate dance , where one misstep would throw me hopelessly out of time . ”

21148	21198	21145	21145	Lily	109	“ they never do . Each of them wants a creature of a different race , of Jack ’s race and mine , with all sorts of intuitions , sensations and perceptions that they do n’t even guess the existence of . And they always get what they want . ”
22244	22252	22253	22253	he	808	“ You see I came after all , ”

24834	24843	24830	24830	she	109	“ Are n’t you horribly jealous of her ? ”
24851	24898	24899	24899	he	167	“ Oh , abominably — you’ve just hit it — keeps me awake at night . The doctors tell me that ’s what has knocked my digestion out — being so infernally jealous of her.—I ca n’t eat a mouthful of this stuff , you know , ”
25047	25060	25063	25063	her	109	“ And of course you ’ll have Sim Rosedale as best man ! ”
25081	25100	25074	25074	Stepney	125	“ Jove , that ’s an idea . What a thumping present I ’d get out of him ! ”

26447	26452	26454	26455	Mrs. Dorset	131	“ Late for what ? ”
26458	26473	26454	26455	Mrs. Dorset	131	“ Not for luncheon , certainly — but perhaps you had an earlier engagement ? ”
26474	26480	26482	26482	Lily	109	“ Yes , I had , ”
26485	26506	26482	26482	Lily	109	“ Really ? Perhaps I am in the way , then ? But Mr. Selden is entirely at your disposal . ”
26526	26536	26537	26537	she	109	“ Oh , dear , no — do stay , ”
26543	26556	26537	26537	she	109	“ I do n’t in the least want to drive you away . ”
26557	26575	26515	26516	her antagonist	961	“ You ’re awfully good , dear , but I never interfere with Mr. Selden ’s engagements . ”
26628	26665	26666	26666	She	109	“ But I have no engagement with Mr. Selden ! My engagement was to go to church ; and I ’m afraid the omnibus has started without me . HAS it started , do you know ? ”
26684	26752	26669	26669	Selden	108	“ Ah , then I shall have to walk ; I promised Hilda and Muriel to go to church with them . It ’s too late to walk there , you say ? Well , I shall have the credit of trying , at any rate — and the advantage of escaping part of the service . I ’m not so sorry for myself , after all ! ”
27323	27329	27330	27330	he	108	“ How fast you walk ! ”

27388	27399	27381	27381	she	109	“ Well — waiting to see if you would come . ”
27400	27432	27381	27381	she	109	“ I seize the distinction , but I do n’t mind it , since doing the one involved doing the other . But were n’t you sure that I should come ? ”
27433	27455	27381	27381	she	109	“ If I waited long enough — but you see I had only a limited time to give to the experiment . ”
27456	27464	27381	27381	she	109	“ Why limited ? Limited by luncheon ? ”
27465	27473	27381	27381	she	109	“ No ; by my other engagement . ”

27501	27528	27529	27529	Lily	109	“ Ah , I see ; I might have known you were fully provided with alternatives . And is the other person coming home this way ? ”
27533	27562	27529	27529	Lily	109	“ That ’s just what I do n’t know ; and to find out , it is my business to get to church before the service is over . ”
27563	27601	27602	27602	Lily	109	“ Exactly ; and it is my business to prevent your doing so ; in which case the other person , piqued by your absence , will form the desperate resolve of driving back in the omnibus . ”
27620	27632	27633	27633	she	109	“ Is that what you would do in such an emergency ? ”
27643	27652	27653	27653	he	108	“ I am here to prove to you , ”
27656	27667	27653	27653	he	108	“ what I am capable of doing in an emergency ! ”
27668	27686	27633	27633	she	109	“ Walking a mile in an hour — you must own that the omnibus would be quicker ! ”
27687	27707	27708	27708	They	983	“ Ah — but will he find you in the end ? That ’s the only test of success . ”
27743	27754	27740	27740	she	109	“ Well , if it is , he has succeeded . ”
27853	27867	27868	27868	Selden	108	“ Ah — now I see why you were getting up your Americana ! ”
27958	27979	27940	27940	she	109	“ That was why I was waiting for you — to thank you for having given me so many points ! ”
27980	27997	27999	27999	Selden	108	“ Ah , you can hardly do justice to the subject in such a short time , ”
28026	28060	28013	28013	she	109	“ Wo n’t you devote your afternoon to it ? You know I must be off tomorrow morning . We ’ll take a walk , and you can thank me at your leisure . ”
28420	28426	28427	28427	Selden	108	“ Let us sit here , ”
29253	29271	29244	29244	her	109	“ I have broken two engagements for you today . How many have you broken for me ? ”
29272	29275	29277	29277	Selden	108	“ None , ”
29280	29290	29277	29277	Selden	108	“ My only engagement at Bellomont was with you . ”
29300	29311	29291	29291	She	109	“ Did you really come to Bellomont to see me ? ”
29312	29318	29319	29319	Her	109	“ Of course I did . ”
29324	29327	29328	29328	she	109	“ Why ? ”
29344	29363	29328	29328	she	109	“ Because you ’re such a wonderful spectacle : I always like to see what you are doing . ”
29364	29380	29381	29381	Selden	108	“ How do you know what I should be doing if you were not here ? ”
29384	29405	29381	29381	Selden	108	“ I do n’t flatter myself that my coming has deflected your course of action by a hair ’s breadth . ”
29406	29430	29328	29328	she	109	“ That ’s absurd — since , if you were not here , I could obviously not be taking a walk with you . ”
29431	29486	29487	29487	Lily	109	“ No ; but your taking a walk with me is only another way of making use of your material . You are an artist and I happen to be the bit of colour you are using today . It ’s a part of your cleverness to be able to produce premeditated effects extemporaneously . ”
29910	29924	29925	29925	she	109	“ I thought , after all , the air might do me good , ”
30023	30029	30030	30030	she	109	“ I do n’t know , ”
30033	30043	30030	30030	she	109	“ why you are always accusing me of premeditation . ”
30044	30084	30197	30197	Selden	108	“ I thought you confessed to it : you told me the other day that you had to follow a certain line — and if one does a thing at all it is a merit to do it thoroughly . ”
30085	30137	30197	30197	Selden	108	“ If you mean that a girl who has no one to think for her is obliged to think for herself , I am quite willing to accept the imputation . But you must find me a dismal kind of person if you suppose that I never yield to an impulse . ”
30138	30163	30030	30030	she	109	“ Ah , but I do n’t suppose that : have n’t I told you that your genius lies in converting impulses into intentions ? ”
30164	30168	30169	30169	she	1043	“ My genius ? ”
30178	30196	30169	30169	she	1043	“ Is there any final test of genius but success ? And I certainly have n’t succeeded . ”
30211	30227	30197	30197	Selden	108	“ Success — what is success ? I shall be interested to have your definition . ”
30228	30231	30232	30232	She	1043	“ Success ? ”
30235	30269	30232	30232	She	1043	“ Why , to get as much as one can out of life , I suppose . It ’s a relative quality , after all . Is n’t that your idea of it ? ”
30270	30279	30280	30280	He	108	“ My idea of it ? God forbid ! ”
30301	30307	30308	30308	he	108	“ My idea of success , ”
30311	30316	30308	30308	he	108	“ is personal freedom . ”
30317	30324	30232	30232	She	1043	“ Freedom ? Freedom from worries ? ”
30325	30363	30364	30364	She	1043	“ From everything — from money , from poverty , from ease and anxiety , from all the material accidents . To keep a kind of republic of the spirit — that ’s what I call success . ”
30372	30394	30395	30395	He	108	“ I know — I know — it ’s strange ; but that ’s just what I ’ve been feeling today . ”
30406	30415	30416	30416	he	108	“ Is the feeling so rare with you ? ”
30427	30468	30419	30419	She	1043	“ You think me horribly sordid , do n’t you ? But perhaps it ’s rather that I never had any choice . There was no one , I mean , to tell me about the republic of the spirit . ”
30469	30489	30419	30419	She	1043	“ There never is — it ’s a country one has to find the way to one ’s self . ”
30490	30507	30419	30419	She	1043	“ But I should never have found my way there if you had n’t told me . ”
30508	30527	30419	30419	She	1043	“ Ah , there are sign - posts — but one has to know how to read them . ”
30528	30539	30540	30540	she	1043	“ Well , I have known , I have known ! ”
30548	30583	30540	30540	she	1043	“ Whenever I see you , I find myself spelling out a letter of the sign — and yesterday — last evening at dinner — I suddenly saw a little way into your republic . ”
30807	30810	30811	30811	he	108	“ Well , ”
30814	30833	30811	30811	he	108	“ did it make you want to see more ? Are you going to become one of us ? ”
30853	30868	30845	30845	she	1043	“ Oh , do give me one — I have n’t smoked for days ! ”
30869	30880	30811	30811	he	108	“ Why such unnatural abstinence ? Everybody smokes at Bellomont . ”
30881	30910	30811	30811	he	108	“ Yes — but it is not considered becoming in a JEUNE FILLE A MARIER ; and at the present moment I am a JEUNE FILLE A MARIER . ”
30911	30927	30845	30845	she	1043	“ Ah , then I ’m afraid we ca n’t let you into the republic . ”
30928	30938	30811	30811	he	108	“ Why not ? Is it a celibate order ? ”
30939	30986	30811	30811	he	108	“ Not in the least , though I ’m bound to say there are not many married people in it . But you will marry some one very rich , and it ’s as hard for rich people to get into as the kingdom of heaven . ”
30987	31035	30811	30811	he	108	“ That ’s unjust , I think , because , as I understand it , one of the conditions of citizenship is not to think too much about money , and the only way not to think about money is to have a great deal of it . ”
31036	31119	31120	31120	Lily	109	“ You might as well say that the only way not to think about air is to have enough to breathe . That is true enough in a sense ; but your lungs are thinking about the air , if you are not . And so it is with your rich people — they may not be thinking of money , but they ’re breathing it all the while ; take them into another element and see how they squirm and gasp ! ”
31134	31140	31141	31141	she	109	“ It seems to me , ”
31146	31163	31141	31141	she	109	“ that you spend a good deal of your time in the element you disapprove of . ”
31171	31227	31228	31228	Lily	109	“ Yes ; but I have tried to remain amphibious : it ’s all right as long as one ’s lungs can work in another air . The real alchemy consists in being able to turn gold back again into something else ; and that ’s the secret that most of your friends have lost . ”
31231	31237	31238	31238	she	109	“ Do n’t you think , ”
31244	31319	31238	31238	she	109	“ that the people who find fault with society are too apt to regard it as an end and not a means , just as the people who despise money speak as if its only use were to be kept in bags and gloated over ? Is n’t it fairer to look at them both as opportunities , which may be used either stupidly or intelligently , according to the capacity of the user ? ”
31320	31427	31430	31430	himself	108	“ That is certainly the sane view ; but the queer thing about society is that the people who regard it as an end are those who are in it , and not the critics on the fence . It ’s just the other way with most shows — the audience may be under the illusion , but the actors know that real life is on the other side of the footlights . The people who take society as an escape from work are putting it to its proper use ; but when it becomes the thing worked for it distorts all the relations of life . ”
31435	31439	31440	31440	he	108	“ Good heavens ! ”
31444	31591	31440	31440	he	108	“ I do n’t underrate the decorative side of life . It seems to me the sense of splendour has justified itself by what it has produced . The worst of it is that so much human nature is used up in the process . If we ’re all the raw stuff of the cosmic effects , one would rather be the fire that tempers a sword than the fish that dyes a purple cloak . And a society like ours wastes such good material in producing its little patch of purple ! Look at a boy like Ned Silverton — he ’s really too good to be used to refurbish anybody ’s social shabbiness . There ’s a lad just setting out to discover the universe : is n’t it a pity he should end by finding it in Mrs. Fisher ’s drawing - room ? ”
31592	31634	31635	31635	Selden	108	“ Ned is a dear boy , and I hope he will keep his illusions long enough to write some nice poetry about them ; but do you think it is only in society that he is likely to lose them ? ”
31642	31699	31635	31635	Selden	108	“ Why do we call all our generous ideas illusions , and the mean ones truths ? Is n’t it a sufficient condemnation of society to find one ’s self accepting such phraseology ? I very nearly acquired the jargon at Silverton ’s age , and I know how names can alter the colour of beliefs . ”
31745	31757	31758	31758	she	1049	“ Ah , you are as bad as the other sectarians , ”
31761	31789	31758	31758	she	1049	“ why do you call your republic a republic ? It is a closed corporation , and you create arbitrary objections in order to keep people out . ”
31790	31814	31718	31726	the eclectic , who lightly turns over and compares	1050	“ It is not MY republic ; if it were , I should have a COUP D’ETAT and seat you on the throne . ”
31815	31854	31758	31758	she	1049	“ Whereas , in reality , you think I can never even get my foot across the threshold ? Oh , I understand what you mean . You despise my ambitions — you think them unworthy of me ! ”
31862	31886	31855	31855	Selden	108	“ Well , is n’t that a tribute ? I think them quite worthy of most of the people who live by them . ”
31896	31943	31887	31887	She	1052	“ But is n’t it possible that , if I had the opportunities of these people , I might make a better use of them ? Money stands for all kinds of things — its purchasing quality is n’t limited to diamonds and motor - cars . ”
31944	31962	31718	31726	the eclectic , who lightly turns over and compares	1050	“ Not in the least : you might expiate your enjoyment of them by founding a hospital . ”
31963	31987	31887	31887	She	1052	“ But if you think they are what I should really enjoy , you must think my ambitions are good enough for me . ”
31996	32022	31988	31988	Selden	108	“ Ah , my dear Miss Bart , I am not divine Providence , to guarantee your enjoying the things you are trying to get ! ”
32023	32047	32048	32048	She	1053	“ Then the best you can say for me is , that after struggling to get them I probably sha n’t like them ? ”
32054	32064	32048	32048	She	1053	“ What a miserable future you foresee for me ! ”
32065	32076	31887	31887	She	1052	“ Well — have you never foreseen it for yourself ? ”
32112	32117	32118	32118	she	1053	“ Often and often , ”
32121	32135	32118	32118	she	1053	“ But it looks so much darker when you show it to me ! ”
32177	32186	32187	32187	she	1053	“ Why do you do this to me ? ”
32190	32214	32187	32187	she	1053	“ Why do you make the things I have chosen seem hateful to me , if you have nothing to give me instead ? ”
32294	32305	32306	32306	he	108	“ No , I have nothing to give you instead , ”
32319	32332	32306	32306	he	108	“ If I had , it should be yours , you know . ”
32438	32458	32430	32430	he	108	“ Is n’t it natural that I should try to belittle all the things I ca n’t offer you ? ”
32491	32501	32502	32502	she	1053	“ But you belittle ME , do n’t you , ”
32506	32520	32502	32502	she	1053	“ in being so sure they are the only things I care for ? ”
32546	32567	32541	32541	he	108	“ But you do care for them , do n’t you ? And no wishing of mine can alter that . ”
32601	32604	32605	32605	she	1053	“ Ah , ”
32608	32645	32605	32605	she	1053	“ for all your fine phrases you ’re really as great a coward as I am , for you would n’t have made one of them if you had n’t been so sure of my answer . ”
32661	32671	32672	32672	he	108	“ I am not so sure of your answer , ”
32676	32691	32672	32672	he	108	“ And I do you the justice to believe that you are not either . ”
32706	32713	32714	32714	she	1053	moment—“Do you want to marry me ? ”
32723	32740	32717	32717	He	108	“ No , I do n’t want to — but perhaps I should if you did ! ”
32741	32762	32763	32763	She	1053	“ That ’s what I told you — you’re so sure of me that you can amuse yourself with experiments . ”
32780	32787	32788	32788	he	108	“ I am not making experiments , ”
32791	32835	32788	32788	he	108	“ Or if I am , it is not on you but on myself . I do n’t know what effect they are going to have on me — but if marrying you is one of them , I will take the risk . ”
32840	32859	32836	32836	She	1053	“ It would be a great risk , certainly — I have never concealed from you how great . ”
32860	32871	32872	32872	he	108	“ Ah , it ’s you who are the coward ! ”
32936	32945	32946	32946	he	108	“ It ’s you who are the coward , ”
33004	33020	33021	33021	she	1053	warning—“I shall look hideous in dowdy clothes ; but I can trim my own hats , ”
33138	33157	33158	33158	she	1053	“ I had no idea it was so late ! We shall not be back till after dark , ”
33196	33213	33186	33186	he	108	“ That was not one of our party ; the motor was going the other way . ”
33214	33222	33223	33223	She	1053	“ I know — I know — — ”
33235	33257	33258	33258	she	1053	“ But I told them I was not well — that I should not go out . Let us go down ! ”
33406	33411	33412	33412	she	1053	“ Were you serious ? ”
33455	33459	33460	33460	he	108	“ Why not ? ”
33463	33474	33460	33460	he	108	“ You see I took no risks in being so . ”
33495	33501	33491	33491	he	108	“ Let us go down . ”
33545	33562	33563	33563	She	1053	“ All I can say is , Lily , that I ca n’t make you out ! ”
33618	33878	33593	33593	she	1053	“ If you had n’t told me you were going in for him seriously — but I ’m sure you made that plain enough from the beginning ! Why else did you ask me to let you off bridge , and to keep away Carry and Kate Corby ? I do n’t suppose you did it because he amused you ; we could none of us imagine your putting up with him for a moment unless you meant to marry him . And I ’m sure everybody played fair ! They all wanted to help it along . Even Bertha kept her hands off — I will say that — till Lawrence came down and you dragged him away from her . After that she had a right to retaliate — why on earth did you interfere with her ? You ’ve known Lawrence Selden for years — why did you behave as if you had just discovered him ? If you had a grudge against Bertha it was a stupid time to show it — you could have paid her back just as well after you were married ! I told you Bertha was dangerous . She was in an odious mood when she came here , but Lawrence ’s turning up put her in a good humour , and if you ’d only let her think he came for HER it would have never occurred to her to play you this trick . Oh , Lily , you ’ll never do anything if you ’re not serious ! ”
33933	33962	33963	33964	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ I only took a day off — I thought he meant to stay on all this week , and I knew Mr. Selden was leaving this morning . ”
33978	34013	33963	33964	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ He did mean to stay — that ’s the worst of it . It shows that he ’s run away from you ; that Bertha ’s done her work and poisoned him thoroughly . ”
34020	34032	34014	34014	Lily	109	“ Oh , if he ’s running I ’ll overtake him ! ”
34041	34051	34033	34034	Her friend	754	“ Whatever you do , Lily , do nothing ! ”
34061	34080	34082	34082	she	109	“ I do n’t mean , literally , to take the next train . There are ways — — ”
34098	34145	34091	34092	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ There WERE ways — plenty of them ! I did n’t suppose you needed to have them pointed out . But do n’t deceive yourself — he ’s thoroughly frightened . He has run straight home to his mother , and she ’ll protect him ! ”
34146	34153	34154	34154	Lily	109	“ Oh , to the death , ”
34162	34169	34173	34173	her	109	“ How you can LAUGH — — ”
34189	34198	34176	34176	she	109	“ What was it Bertha really told him ? ”
34199	34265	34091	34092	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ Do n’t ask me — horrors ! She seemed to have raked up everything . Oh , you know what I mean — of course there is n’t anything , REALLY ; but I suppose she brought in Prince Varigliano — and Lord Hubert — and there was some story of your having borrowed money of old Ned Van Alstyne : did you ever ? ”
34266	34274	34275	34276	Miss Bart	109	“ He is my father ’s cousin , ”
34279	34334	34275	34276	Miss Bart	109	“ Well , of course she left THAT out . It seems Ned told Carry Fisher ; and she told Bertha , naturally . They ’re all alike , you know : they hold their tongues for years , and you think you ’re safe , but when their opportunity comes they remember everything . ”
34349	34371	34340	34340	her	109	“ It was some money I lost at bridge at the Van Osburghs ’ . I repaid it , of course . ”
34372	34412	34340	34340	her	109	“ Ah , well , they would n’t remember that ; besides , it was the idea of the gambling debt that frightened Percy . Oh , Bertha knew her man — she knew just what to tell him ! ”
34603	34605	34566	34567	her hearer	1077	“ horrid ”
34832	34872	34873	34873	She	123	“ Dear Judy ! I ’m sorry to have been such a bore , and you are very good to me . But you must have some letters for me to answer — let me at least be useful . ”
35036	35108	35109	35109	she	131	“ How few of us are left ! I do so enjoy the quiet — don’t you , Lily ? I wish the men would always stop away — it ’s really much nicer without them . Oh , you do n’t count , George : one does n’t have to talk to one ’s husband . But I thought Mr. Gryce was to stay for the rest of the week ? ”
35113	35213	35109	35109	she	131	“ Did n’t he intend to , Judy ? He ’s such a nice boy — I wonder what drove him away ? He is rather shy , and I ’m afraid we may have shocked him : he has been brought up in such an old - fashioned way . Do you know , Lily , he told me he had never seen a girl play cards for money till he saw you doing it the other night ? And he lives on the interest of his income , and always has a lot left over to invest ! ”
35220	35267	35214	35215	Mrs. Fisher	135	“ I do believe it is some one ’s duty to educate that young man . It is shocking that he has never been made to realize his duties as a citizen . Every wealthy man should be compelled to study the laws of his country . ”

35322	35344	35312	35312	Stepney	125	“ I suppose he is thinking of marriage , and wants to tinker up the old ship before he goes aboard . ”
35362	35382	35354	35355	George Dorset	131	“ Poor devil ! It is n’t the ship that will do for him , it ’s the crew . ”

35429	35450	35451	35451	she	159	“ I ’m sure I do n’t see why you laugh at him ; I think he ’s very nice , ”
35454	35474	35451	35451	she	159	“ and , at any rate , a girl who married him would always have enough to be comfortable . ”
35644	35752	35753	35754	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ Lily , dear , if you ’ve nothing special to do , may I tell Carry Fisher that you intend to drive to the station and fetch Gus ? He will be back at four , and I know she has it in her mind to meet him . Of course I ’m very glad to have him amused , but I happen to know that she has bled him rather severely since she ’s been here , and she is so keen about going to fetch him that I fancy she must have got a lot more bills this morning . It seems to me , ”
35758	35772	35753	35754	Mrs. Trenor	123	“ that most of her alimony is paid by other women ’s husbands ! ”
36161	36184	36158	36158	he	161	“ Halloo ! It is n’t often you honour me . You must have been uncommonly hard up for something to do . ”
36281	36303	36276	36276	her	109	“ It ’s not often I have the chance . There are too many ladies to dispute the privilege with me . ”
36304	36341	36342	36342	He	161	“ The privilege of driving me home ? Well , I ’m glad you won the race , anyhow . But I know what really happened — my wife sent you . Now did n’t she ? ”
36371	36394	36395	36395	she	109	“ You see , Judy thinks I ’m the safest person for you to be with ; and she ’s quite right , ”
36398	36472	36473	36473	He	1120	“ Oh , is she , though ? If she is , it ’s because you would n’t waste your time on an old hulk like me . We married men have to put up with what we can get : all the prizes are for the clever chaps who ’ve kept a free foot . Let me light a cigar , will you ? I ’ve had a beastly day of it . ”
36545	36558	36541	36541	she	109	“ Did you have such a lot of tiresome things to do ? ”
36559	36567	36541	36541	she	109	“ I should say so — rather ! ”
36595	36614	36615	36615	He	1120	“ You do n’t know how a fellow has to hustle to keep this kind of thing going . ”
36636	36658	36659	36659	he	1120	“ Judy has no idea of what she spends — not that there is n’t plenty to keep the thing going , ”
36663	36794	36795	36795	he	1120	“ but a man has got to keep his eyes open and pick up all the tips he can . My father and mother used to live like fighting - cocks on their income , and put by a good bit of it too — luckily for me — but at the pace we go now , I do n’t know where I should be if it were n’t for taking a flyer now and then . The women all think — I mean Judy thinks — I’ve nothing to do but to go downtown once a month and cut off coupons , but the truth is it takes a devilish lot of hard work to keep the machinery running . Not that I ought to complain today , though , ”
36802	36921	36795	36795	he	1120	“ for I did a very neat stroke of business , thanks to Stepney ’s friend Rosedale : by the way , Miss Lily , I wish you ’d try to persuade Judy to be decently civil to that chap . He ’s going to be rich enough to buy us all out one of these days , and if she ’d only ask him to dine now and then I could get almost anything out of him . The man is mad to know the people who do n’t want to know him , and when a fellow ’s in that state there is nothing he wo n’t do for the first woman who takes him up . ”
36962	36979	36956	36956	She	109	“ But you know Jack did try to take him about , and he was impossible . ”
36980	37064	37065	37065	Lily	109	“ Oh , hang it — because he ’s fat and shiny , and has a sloppy manner ! Well , all I can say is that the people who are clever enough to be civil to him now will make a mighty good thing of it . A few years from now he ’ll be in it whether we want him or not , and then he wo n’t be giving away a half - a - million tip for a dinner . ”

37314	37366	37306	37306	she	109	“ The afternoon is so perfect — don’t you want to drive me a little farther ? I ’ve been rather out of spirits all day , and it ’s so restful to be away from people , with some one who wo n’t mind if I ’m a little dull . ”
37430	37469	37470	37470	Lily	109	“ Out of spirits ? Why on earth should you ever be out of spirits ? Is your last box of Doucet dresses a failure , or did Judy rook you out of everything at bridge last night ? ”
37478	37581	37472	37472	her	109	“ I have had to give up Doucet ; and bridge too — I ca n’t afford it . In fact I ca n’t afford any of the things my friends do , and I am afraid Judy often thinks me a bore because I do n’t play cards any longer , and because I am not as smartly dressed as the other women . But you will think me a bore too if I talk to you about my worries , and I only mention them because I want you to do me a favour — the very greatest of favours . ”
37604	37619	37620	37620	He	1139	“ Why , of course — if it ’s anything I can manage — — ”
37641	37647	37648	37648	she	1138	“ The greatest of favours , ”
37652	37672	37648	37648	she	1138	“ The fact is , Judy is angry with me , and I want you to make my peace . ”

37706	37759	37760	37760	She	1140	“ She is the best friend I have , and that is why I mind having to vex her . But I daresay you know what she has wanted me to do . She has set her heart — poor dear — on my marrying — marrying a great deal of money . ”
37784	37883	37884	37884	He	1141	“ A great deal of money ? Oh , by Jove — you do n’t mean Gryce ? What — you do ? Oh , no , of course I wo n’t mention it — you can trust me to keep my mouth shut — but Gryce — good Lord , GRYCE ! Did Judy really think you could bring yourself to marry that portentous little ass ? But you could n’t , eh ? And so you gave him the sack , and that ’s the reason why he lit out by the first train this morning ? ”
37907	37937	37889	37889	himself	1141	“ How on earth could Judy think you would do such a thing ? I could have told her you ’d never put up with such a little milksop ! ”
37943	37948	37949	37949	she	109	“ I sometimes think , ”
37952	37966	37949	37949	she	109	“ that men understand a woman ’s motives better than other women do . ”
37967	37982	37983	37983	he	1141	“ Some men — I’m certain of it ! I could have TOLD Judy , ”
37995	38012	37983	37983	he	1141	“ I thought you would understand ; that ’s why I wanted to speak to you , ”
38017	38184	38013	38014	Miss Bart	109	“ I ca n’t make that kind of marriage ; it ’s impossible . But neither can I go on living as all the women in my set do . I am almost entirely dependent on my aunt , and though she is very kind to me she makes me no regular allowance , and lately I ’ve lost money at cards , and I do n’t dare tell her about it . I have paid my card debts , of course , but there is hardly anything left for my other expenses , and if I go on with my present life I shall be in horrible difficulties . I have a tiny income of my own , but I ’m afraid it ’s badly invested , for it seems to bring in less every year , and I am so ignorant of money matters that I do n’t know if my aunt ’s agent , who looks after it , is a good adviser . ”
38197	38274	38185	38185	She	1143	“ I did n’t mean to bore you with all this , but I want your help in making Judy understand that I ca n’t , at present , go on living as one must live among you all . I am going away tomorrow to join my aunt at Richfield , and I shall stay there for the rest of the autumn , and dismiss my maid and learn how to mend my own clothes . ”

39152	39263	39148	39148	she	109	“ It ’s too delightful of you to be so nice to him , and put up with all his tiresome stories . I know what they are , because I had to listen to them when we were engaged — I’m sure he is telling the same ones still . And now I sha n’t always have to be asking Carry Fisher here to keep him in a good humour . She ’s a perfect vulture , you know ; and she has n’t the least moral sense . She is always getting Gus to speculate for her , and I ’m sure she never pays when she loses . ”

I made up my mind weeks ago that I would n’t miss this wedding , and just fancy how delightfully it all came about . When Lawrence Selden heard I was coming , he insisted on fetching me himself and driving me to the station , and when we go back this evening I am to dine with him at Sherry ’s . I really feel as excited as if I were getting married myself ! ”
40831	40838	40839	40839	she	109	“ Do you see him often ? ”
40842	40963	40839	40839	she	109	“ Yes ; he is very good about dropping in on Sundays . And now and then we do a play together ; but lately I have n’t seen much of him . He does n’t look well , and he seems nervous and unsettled . The dear fellow ! I do wish he would marry some nice girl . I told him so today , but he said he did n’t care for the really nice ones , and the other kind did n’t care for him — but that was just his joke , of course . He could never marry a girl who WASN’T nice . Oh , my dear , did you ever see such pearls ? ”
41106	41134	41135	41136	Miss Farish	113	“ Oh , Lily , do look at this diamond pendant — it ’s as big as a dinner - plate ! Who can have given it ? ”

41238	41260	41261	41261	she	113	“ Well , if Gwen does n’t care to be seen wearing it she can always exchange it for something else , ”

41328	41438	41323	41323	she	113	“ Of course you ’ve heard that he ’s perfectly devoted to Evie Van Osburgh ? Cousin Grace is so pleased about it — it ’s quite a romance ! He met her first at the George Dorsets ’ , only about six weeks ago , and it ’s just the nicest possible marriage for dear Evie . Oh , I do n’t mean the money — of course she has plenty of her own — but she ’s such a quiet stay - at - home kind of girl , and it seems he has just the same tastes ; so they are exactly suited to each other . ”

41927	41991	41911	41911	she	109	“ Well , not exactly : I sold out on the rise and I ’ve pulled off four thou ’ for you . Not so bad for a beginner , eh ? I suppose you ’ll begin to think you ’re a pretty knowing speculator . And perhaps you wo n’t think poor old Gus such an awful ass as some people do . ”

Why ca n’t you come back to Bellomont this evening ? We ’re all alone , and Judy is as cross as two sticks . Do come and cheer a fellow up . If you say yes I ’ll run you over in the motor , and you can telephone your maid to bring your traps from town by the next train . ”
42397	42429	42388	42388	her	109	“ I wish I could — but it ’s quite impossible . My aunt has come back to town , and I must be with her for the next few days . ”
42430	42461	42462	42462	he	1235	“ Well , I ’ve seen a good deal less of you since we ’ve got to be such pals than I used to when you were Judy ’s friend , ”
42468	42547	42462	42462	he	1235	“ When I was Judy ’s friend ? Am I not her friend still ? Really , you say the most absurd things ! If I were always at Bellomont you would tire of me much sooner than Judy — but come and see me at my aunt ’s the next afternoon you are in town ; then we can have a nice quiet talk , and you can tell me how I had better invest my fortune . ”
42631	42746	42628	42628	he	1237	“ Oh , I do n’t know that I can promise you a fresh tip every day . But there ’s one thing you might do for me ; and that is , just to be a little civil to Rosedale . Judy has promised to ask him to dine when we get to town , but I ca n’t induce her to have him at Bellomont , and if you would let me bring him up now it would make a lot of difference . I do n’t believe two women have spoken to him this afternoon , and I can tell you he ’s a chap it pays to be decent to . ”
42796	42805	42806	42806	she	109	“ Oh , bring him by all means , ”
42810	42825	42806	42806	she	109	“ perhaps I can get a tip out of him on my own account . ”

43108	43180	43104	43104	he	108	“ I was wondering if I should be able to have a word with you before the special snatches us away . I came with Gerty Farish , and promised not to let her miss the train , but I am sure she is still extracting sentimental solace from the wedding presents . She appears to regard their number and value as evidence of the disinterested affection of the contracting parties . ”

I brought ’em to you to sell , because I ai n’t got no other way of raising money , and if we do n’t pay our rent by tomorrow night we ’ll be put out . I never done anythin ’ of the kind before , and if you ’d speak to Mr. Selden or to Mr. Rosedale about getting Haffen taken on again at the Benedick — I seen you talking to Mr. Rosedale on the steps that day you come out of Mr. Selden ’s rooms — — ”

48542	48566	48538	48538	she	189	“ I have offered all I am willing to give for the letters ; but there may be other ways of getting them . ”
49088	49121	49127	49127	she	114	“ I saw a streak of light under one of the blinds as I drove up : it ’s extraordinary that I can never teach that woman to draw them down evenly . ”
49161	49287	49153	49153	she	114	“ My dear , you look tired ; I suppose it ’s the excitement of the wedding . Cornelia Van Alstyne was full of it : Molly was there , and Gerty Farish ran in for a minute to tell us about it . I think it was odd , their serving melons before the CONSOMME : a wedding breakfast should always begin with CONSOMME . Molly did n’t care for the bridesmaids ’ dresses . She had it straight from Julia Melson that they cost three hundred dollars apiece at Celeste ’s , but she says they did n’t look it . I ’m glad you decided not to be a bridesmaid ; that shade of salmon - pink would n’t have suited you . ”
49424	49597	49411	49411	she	114	“ Really , Lily , I do n’t see why you took the trouble to go to the wedding , if you do n’t remember what happened or whom you saw there . When I was a girl I used to keep the MENU of every dinner I went to , and write the names of the people on the back ; and I never threw away my cotillion favours till after your uncle ’s death , when it seemed unsuitable to have so many coloured things about the house . I had a whole closet - full , I remember ; and I can tell to this day what balls I got them at . Molly Van Alstyne reminds me of what I was at that age ; it ’s wonderful how she notices . She was able to tell her mother exactly how the wedding - dress was cut , and we knew at once , from the fold in the back , that it must have come from Paquin . ”
49639	49652	49653	49653	she	114	“ I knew it — the parlour - maid never dusts there ! ”
49674	49919	49670	49670	she	114	“ Molly thought Mrs. Dorset the best - dressed woman at the wedding . I ’ve no doubt her dress DID cost more than any one else ’s , but I ca n’t quite like the idea — a combination of sable and POINT DE MILAN . It seems she goes to a new man in Paris , who wo n’t take an order till his client has spent a day with him at his villa at Neuilly . He says he must study his subject ’s home life — a most peculiar arrangement , I should say ! But Mrs. Dorset told Molly about it herself : she said the villa was full of the most exquisite things and she was really sorry to leave . Molly said she never saw her looking better ; she was in tremendous spirits , and said she had made a match between Evie Van Osburgh and Percy Gryce . She really seems to have a very good influence on young men . I hear she is interesting herself now in that silly Silverton boy , who has had his head turned by Carry Fisher , and has been gambling so dreadfully . Well , as I was saying , Evie is really engaged : Mrs. Dorset had her to stay with Percy Gryce , and managed it all , and Grace Van Osburgh is in the seventh heaven — she had almost despaired of marrying Evie . ”
49943	50010	49928	49928	her	114	“ Cornelia Van Alstyne was so surprised : she had heard that you were to marry young Gryce . She saw the Wetheralls just after they had stopped with you at Bellomont , and Alice Wetherall was quite sure there was an engagement . She said that when Mr. Gryce left unexpectedly one morning , they all thought he had rushed to town for the ring . ”

52265	52294	52253	52253	he	124	“ How ’s your luck been going in Wall Street , by the way ? I hear Gus pulled off a nice little pile for you last month . ”
52362	52437	52348	52348	she	109	“ Ah , yes — I had a little bit of money to invest , and Mr. Trenor , who helps me about such matters , advised my putting it in stocks instead of a mortgage , as my aunt ’s agent wanted me to do ; and as it happened , I made a lucky ‘ turn’—is that what you call it ? For you make a great many yourself , I believe . ”

53492	53555	53478	53478	Trenor	123	“ Look here , Lily , how is a fellow ever to see anything of you ? I ’m in town three or four days in the week , and you know a line to the club will always find me , but you do n’t seem to remember my existence nowadays unless you want to get a tip out of me . ”
53610	53623	53624	53624	she	109	“ I ’m very much flattered by your wanting to see me , ”
53631	53668	53624	53624	she	109	“ but , unless you have mislaid my address , it would have been easy to find me any afternoon at my aunt’s — in fact , I rather expected you to look me up there . ”
53708	53794	53686	53686	he	1463	“ Hang going to your aunt ’s , and wasting the afternoon listening to a lot of other chaps talking to you ! You know I ’m not the kind to sit in a crowd and jaw — I’d always rather clear out when that sort of circus is going on . But why ca n’t we go off somewhere on a little lark together — a nice quiet little expedition like that drive at Bellomont , the day you met me at the station ? ”
53854	53907	53848	53848	she	1464	“ I do n’t see how one can very well take country drives in town , but I am not always surrounded by an admiring throng , and if you will let me know what afternoon you are coming I will arrange things so that we can have a nice quiet talk . ”
53908	53919	53921	53921	Trenor	123	“ Hang talking ! That ’s what you always say , ”
53928	53970	53971	53971	His	1465	“ You put me off with that at the Van Osburgh wedding — but the plain English of it is that , now you ’ve got what you wanted out of me , you ’d rather have any other fellow about . ”
54003	54093	53988	53988	she	109	“ Do n’t be foolish , Gus ; I ca n’t let you talk to me in that ridiculous way . If you really want to see me , why should n’t we take a walk in the Park some afternoon ? I agree with you that it ’s amusing to be rustic in town , and if you like I ’ll meet you there , and we ’ll go and feed the squirrels , and you shall take me out on the lake in the steam - gondola . ”
54125	54171	54101	54101	her	1466	“ All right , then : that ’s a go . Will you come tomorrow ? Tomorrow at three o’clock , at the end of the Mall . I ’ll be there sharp , remember ; you wo n’t go back on me , Lily ? ”
54355	54370	54371	54371	he	1467	“ Well , here we are , in for another six months of caterwauling , ”
54375	54693	54371	54371	he	1467	“ Not a shade of difference between this year and last , except that the women have got new clothes and the singers have n’t got new voices . My wife ’s musical , you know — puts me through a course of this every winter . It is n’t so bad on Italian nights — then she comes late , and there ’s time to digest . But when they give Wagner we have to rush dinner , and I pay up for it . And the draughts are damnable — asphyxia in front and pleurisy in the back . There ’s Trenor leaving the box without drawing the curtain ! With a hide like that draughts do n’t make any difference . Did you ever watch Trenor eat ? If you did , you ’d wonder why he ’s alive ; I suppose he ’s leather inside too.—But I came to say that my wife wants you to come down to our place next Sunday . Do for heaven ’s sake say yes . She ’s got a lot of bores coming — intellectual ones , I mean ; that ’s her new line , you know , and I ’m not sure it ai n’t worse than the music . Some of ’em have long hair , and they start an argument with the soup , and do n’t notice when things are handed to them . The consequence is the dinner gets cold , and I have dyspepsia . That silly ass Silverton brings them to the house — he writes poetry , you know , and Bertha and he are getting tremendously thick . She could write better than any of ’em if she chose , and I do n’t blame her for wanting clever fellows about ; all I say is : ‘ Do n’t let me see ’em eat ! ’ ”

57063	57109	57053	57054	Miss Stepney	203	“ That ’s the worst of it — people say she is n’t wasting her time ! Every one knows , as you say , that Lily is too handsome and — and charming — to devote herself to a man like Gus Trenor unless — ”
57110	57113	57115	57116	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ Unless ? ”
57222	57225	57227	57227	Grace	187	“ Unless , ”

57391	57422	57423	57423	she	203	“ I do n’t know why I should be accused of taking pleasure in telling you about Lily . I was sure I should n’t get any thanks for it , ”
57431	57467	57423	57423	she	203	“ But I have some family feeling left , and as you are the only person who has any authority over Lily , I thought you ought to know what is being said of her . ”

57476	57494	57473	57474	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ what I complain of is that you have n’t told me yet what IS being said . ”
57495	57518	57423	57423	she	203	“ I did n’t suppose I should have to put it so plainly . People say that Gus Trenor pays her bills . ”
57519	57527	57528	57529	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ Pays her bills — her bills ? ”
57535	57563	57528	57529	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ I ca n’t imagine where you can have picked up such rubbish . Lily has her own income — and I provide for her very handsomely — ”
57564	57572	57574	57575	Miss Stepney	203	“ Oh , we all know that , ”
57578	57588	57574	57575	Miss Stepney	203	“ But Lily wears a great many smart gowns — ”
57589	57604	57528	57529	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ I like her to be well - dressed — it ’s only suitable ! ”
57605	57617	57574	57575	Miss Stepney	203	“ Certainly ; but then there are her gambling debts besides . ”

57704	57735	57671	57672	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ Simply that if one plays bridge for money in Lily ’s set one is liable to lose a great deal — and I do n’t suppose Lily always wins . ”
57736	57748	57671	57672	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ Who told you that my niece played cards for money ? ”
57749	57840	57684	57685	Grace Stepney	187	“ Mercy , cousin Julia , do n’t look at me as if I were trying to turn you against Lily ! Everybody knows she is crazy about bridge . Mrs. Gryce told me herself that it was her gambling that frightened Percy Gryce — it seems he was really taken with her at first . But , of course , among Lily ’s friends it ’s quite the custom for girls to play for money . In fact , people are inclined to excuse her on that account — — ”
57841	57848	57671	57672	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ To excuse her for what ? ”
57849	57869	57870	57871	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ For being hard up — and accepting attentions from men like Gus Trenor — and George Dorset — — ”
57876	57898	57870	57871	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ George Dorset ? Is there any one else ? I should like to know the worst , if you please . ”
57899	58042	58043	58044	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ Do n’t put it in that way , cousin Julia . Lately Lily has been a good deal with the Dorsets , and he seems to admire her — but of course that ’s only natural . And I ’m sure there is no truth in the horrid things people say ; but she HAS been spending a great deal of money this winter . Evie Van Osburgh was at Celeste ’s ordering her trousseau the other day — yes , the marriage takes place next month — and she told me that Celeste showed her the most exquisite things she was just sending home to Lily . And people say that Judy Trenor has quarrelled with her on account of Gus ; but I ’m sure I ’m sorry I spoke , though I only meant it as a kindness . ”

Of course it would never have occurred to Carry Fisher to put me on the list , and I should have been so sorry to miss seeing it all — and especially Lily herself . Some one told me the ceiling was by Veronese — you would know , of course , Lawrence . I suppose it ’s very beautiful , but his women are so dreadfully fat . Goddesses ? Well , I can only say that if they ’d been mortals and had to wear corsets , it would have been better for them . I think our women are much handsomer . And this room is wonderfully becoming — every one looks so well ! Did you ever see such jewels ? Do look at Mrs. George Dorset ’s pearls — I suppose the smallest of them would pay the rent of our Girls ’ Club for a year . Not that I ought to complain about the club ; every one has been so wonderfully kind . Did I tell you that Lily had given us three hundred dollars ? Was n’t it splendid of her ? And then she collected a lot of money from her friends — Mrs. Bry gave us five hundred , and Mr. Rosedale a thousand . I wish Lily were not so nice to Mr. Rosedale , but she says it ’s no use being rude to him , because he does n’t see the difference . She really ca n’t bear to hurt people ’s feelings — it makes me so angry when I hear her called cold and conceited ! The girls at the club do n’t call her that . Do you know she has been there with me twice?—yes , Lily ! And you should have seen their eyes ! One of them said it was as good as a day in the country just to look at her . And she sat there , and laughed and talked with them — not a bit as if she were being CHARITABLE , you know , but as if she liked it as much as they did .

Come along , and I ’ll give you a nip of brandy , and you can toast yourself over the fire and try some of my new Egyptians — that little Turkish chap at the Embassy put me on to a brand that I want you to try , and if you like ’em I ’ll get out a lot for you : they do n’t have ’em here yet , but I ’ll cable . ”
65020	65025	65008	65008	she	109	“ Where ’s Judy ? ”
65058	65173	65174	65174	He	1706	“ Here , now , Lily , just a drop of cognac in a little fizzy water — you do look pinched , you know : I swear the end of your nose is red . I ’ll take another glass to keep you company — Judy?—Why , you see , Judy ’s got a devil of a head ache — quite knocked out with it , poor thing — she asked me to explain — make it all right , you know — Do come up to the fire , though ; you look dead - beat , really . Now do let me make you comfortable , there ’s a good girl . ”
65204	65229	65197	65197	she	1712	“ Do you mean to say that Judy ’s not well enough to see me ? Does n’t she want me to go upstairs ? ”
65250	65303	65247	65247	he	1706	“ Why , no — the fact is , she ’s not up to seeing anybody . It came on suddenly , you know , and she asked me to tell you how awfully sorry she was — if she ’d known where you were dining she ’d have sent you word . ”
65304	65356	65197	65197	she	1712	“ She did know where I was dining ; I mentioned it in my telegram . But it does n’t matter , of course . I suppose if she ’s so poorly she wo n’t go back to Bellomont in the morning , and I can come and see her then . ”
65357	65436	65247	65247	he	1706	“ Yes : exactly — that ’s capital . I ’ll tell her you ’ll pop in tomorrow morning . And now do sit down a minute , there ’s a dear , and let ’s have a nice quiet jaw together . You wo n’t take a drop , just for sociability ? Tell me what you think of that cigarette . Why , do n’t you like it ? What are you chucking it away for ? ”
65437	65461	65462	65462	Lily	109	“ I am chucking it away because I must go , if you ’ll have the goodness to call a cab for me , ”
65545	65677	65678	65678	He	1719	“ Why must you go , I should like to know ? If Judy’d been here you ’d have sat gossiping till all hours — and you ca n’t even give me five minutes ! It ’s always the same story . Last night I could n’t get near you — I went to that damned vulgar party just to see you , and there was everybody talking about you , and asking me if I ’d ever seen anything so stunning , and when I tried to come up and say a word , you never took any notice , but just went on laughing and joking with a lot of asses who only wanted to be able to swagger about afterward , and look knowing when you were mentioned . ”
65742	65767	65739	65739	she	1720	“ Do n’t be absurd , Gus . It ’s past eleven , and I must really ask you to ring for a cab . ”
65782	65797	65739	65739	she	1720	“ And supposing I wo n’t ring for one — what’ll you do then ? ”
65798	65813	65821	65821	his	1719	“ I shall go upstairs to Judy if you force me to disturb her . ”
65827	65845	65821	65821	his	1719	“ Look here , Lily : wo n’t you give me five minutes of your own accord ? ”
65846	65855	65821	65821	his	1719	“ Not tonight , Gus : you — — ”
65856	65875	65876	65876	He	1719	“ Very good , then : I ’ll take ’em . And as many more as I want . ”
65901	65920	65892	65892	He	1719	“ Go and sit down there , please : I ’ve got a word to say to you . ”
65943	65976	65933	65933	She	109	“ If you have anything to say to me , you must say it another time . I shall go up to Judy unless you call a cab for me at once . ”
65983	66004	65977	65977	He	1719	“ Go upstairs and welcome , my dear ; but you wo n’t find Judy . She ai n’t there . ”
66013	66029	66030	66030	she	109	“ Do you mean that Judy is not in the house — not in town ? ”
66033	66042	66046	66046	his	1719	“ That ’s just what I do mean , ”
66055	66069	66070	66070	she	109	“ Nonsense — I do n’t believe you . I am going upstairs , ”
66086	66099	66074	66074	He	1719	“ Go up and welcome ; but my wife is at Bellomont . ”
66108	66122	66101	66101	Lily	109	“ If she had n’t come she would have sent me word — — ”
66123	66137	66074	66074	He	1719	“ She did ; she telephoned me this afternoon to let you know . ”
66138	66144	66101	66101	Lily	109	“ I received no message . ”
66145	66152	66153	66154	The two	781	“ I did n’t send any . ”
66180	66218	66166	66167	her opponent	1724	“ I ca n’t imagine your object in playing such a stupid trick on me ; but if you have fully gratified your peculiar sense of humour I must again ask you to send for a cab . ”
66263	66280	66281	66281	He	1724	“ Look here , Lily , do n’t take that high and mighty tone with me . ”
66305	66426	66296	66296	she	109	“ I DID play a trick on you ; I own up to it ; but if you think I ’m ashamed you ’re mistaken . Lord knows I ’ve been patient enough — I’ve hung round and looked like an ass . And all the while you were letting a lot of other fellows make up to you . . . letting ’em make fun of me , I daresay . . . I ’m not sharp , and ca n’t dress my friends up to look funny , as you do . . . but I can tell when it ’s being done to me .... I can tell fast enough when I ’m made a fool of .... ”
66427	66437	66440	66440	Lily	109	“ Ah , I should n’t have thought that ! ”
66452	66506	66443	66443	her	109	“ No ; you would n’t have thought it ; but you ’ll know better now . That ’s what you ’re here for tonight . I ’ve been waiting for a quiet time to talk things over , and now I ’ve got it I mean to make you hear me out . ”
66589	66598	66586	66586	she	109	“ I do n’t understand what you want . ”
66625	66665	66610	66610	He	1725	“ I ’ll tell you what I want : I want to know just where you and I stand . Hang it , the man who pays for the dinner is generally allowed to have a seat at table . ”
66687	66717	66682	66682	she	109	“ I do n’t know what you mean — but you must see , Gus , that I ca n’t stay here talking to you at this hour — — ”
66718	66746	66765	66765	Rosedale	124	“ Gad , you go to men ’s houses fast enough in broad day light — strikes me you ’re not always so deuced careful of appearances . ”
66823	66836	66837	66837	she	109	“ If you have brought me here to say insulting things — — ”
66843	67022	66840	66840	Trenor	126	“ Do n’t talk stage - rot . I do n’t want to insult you . But a man ’s got his feelings — and you ’ve played with mine too long . I did n’t begin this business — kept out of the way , and left the track clear for the other chaps , till you rummaged me out and set to work to make an ass of me — and an easy job you had of it , too . That ’s the trouble — it was too easy for you — you got reckless — thought you could turn me inside out , and chuck me in the gutter like an empty purse . But , by gad , that ai n’t playing fair : that ’s dodging the rules of the game . Of course I know now what you wanted — it was n’t my beautiful eyes you were after — but I tell you what , Miss Lily , you ’ve got to pay up for making me think so — — ”
67058	67062	67063	67063	she	1729	“ Pay up ? ”
67066	67076	67077	67077	He	1728	“ Do you mean that I owe you money ? ”
67081	67126	67077	67077	He	1728	“ Oh , I ’m not asking for payment in kind . But there ’s such a thing as fair play — and interest on one ’s money — and hang me if I ’ve had as much as a look from you — — ”
67127	67171	67209	67209	He	1728	“ Your money ? What have I to do with your money ? You advised me how to invest mine . . . you must have seen I knew nothing of business . . . you told me it was all right — — ”
67172	67208	67209	67209	He	1728	“ It WAS all right — it is , Lily : you ’re welcome to all of it , and ten times more . I ’m only asking for a word of thanks from you . ”
67233	67265	67266	67266	Trenor	126	“ I HAVE thanked you ; I ’ve shown I was grateful . What more have you done than any friend might do , or any one accept from a friend ? ”
67274	67404	67266	67266	Trenor	126	“ I do n’t doubt you ’ve accepted as much before — and chucked the other chaps as you ’d like to chuck me . I do n’t care how you settled your score with them — if you fooled ’em I ’m that much to the good . Do n’t stare at me like that — I know I ’m not talking the way a man is supposed to talk to a girl — but , hang it , if you do n’t like it you can stop me quick enough — you know I ’m mad about you — damn the money , there ’s plenty more of it — if THAT bothers you .... I was a brute , Lily — Lily!—just look at me — — ”
67482	67504	67470	67470	She	1731	“ I ’ve told you I do n’t understand — but if I owe you money you shall be paid — — ”
67523	67569	67512	67512	her	1731	“ Ah — you’ll borrow from Selden or Rosedale — and take your chances of fooling them as you ’ve fooled me ! Unless — unless you ’ve settled your other scores already — and I ’m the only one left out in the cold ! ”
67701	67709	67710	67710	she	1731	“ I am here alone with you , ”
67713	67721	67710	67710	she	1731	“ What more have you to say ? ”
67827	67834	67839	67839	his	1737	“ Go home ! Go away from here”——he
68088	68099	68100	68100	she	1731	“ I ca n’t think — I ca n’t think , ”
69666	69670	69653	69653	she	112	“ change of heart ”
69719	69724	69713	69713	she	112	“ the real Lily , ”
69970	69972	69957	69957	his	108	“ nice ”
70306	70309	70313	70313	her	230	“ values . ”
70874	70895	70896	70896	He	108	“ Hallo , Lawrence ! Dining here ? Take a bite with me — I’ve ordered a canvas - back . ”
70932	71055	70923	70923	Selden	108	“ Hang it , I believe every man in town has an engagement tonight . I shall have the club to myself . You know how I ’m living this winter , rattling round in that empty house . My wife meant to come to town today , but she ’s put it off again , and how is a fellow to dine alone in a room with the looking - glasses covered , and nothing but a bottle of Harvey sauce on the sideboard ? I say , Lawrence , chuck your engagement and take pity on me — it gives me the blue devils to dine alone , and there ’s nobody but that canting ass Wetherall in the club . ”
71056	71067	71069	71069	Selden	108	“ Sorry , Gus — I ca n’t do it . ”
71247	71250	71245	71245	Its	1825	“ effects , ”
71316	71317	71319	71321	some good fellow	1826	“ points”—really
72053	72063	72045	72045	She	109	“ No , she has never been understood — — ”
72145	72162	72165	72165	Selden	108	“ She is herself with a few people only ; and you are one of them , ”
72171	72183	72165	72165	Selden	108	“ Be good to her , Gerty , wo n’t you ? ”
72186	72211	72165	72165	Selden	108	“ She has it in her to become whatever she is believed to be — you’ll help her by believing the best of her ? ”
72360	72386	72387	72387	He	1850	“ Mrs. Fisher ’s ? You say she was dining there ? There ’s music afterward ; I believe I had a card from her . ”
72404	72445	72455	72455	he	1850	“ A quarter past ten ? I might look in there now ; the Fisher evenings are amusing . I have n’t kept you up too late , Gerty ? You look tired — I’ve rambled on and bored you . ”
72596	72621	72588	72589	Miss Bart	109	“ Lily ? She ’s just gone . She had to run off , I forget where . Was n’t she wonderful last night ? ”
72622	72629	72631	72632	Jack Stepney	125	“ Who ’s that ? Lily ? ”
72644	72681	72631	72632	Jack Stepney	125	“ Really , you know , I ’m no prude , but when it comes to a girl standing there as if she was up at auction — I thought seriously of speaking to cousin Julia . ”
72682	72694	72695	72696	Mrs. Fisher	135	“ You did n’t know Jack had become our social censor ? ”
72713	72739	72705	72705	Stepney	125	“ But she ’s a cousin , hang it , and when a man ’s married — TOWN TALK was full of her this morning . ”
72740	72748	72750	72753	Mr. Ned Van Alstyne	177	“ Yes : lively reading that was , ”
72765	72839	72750	72753	Mr. Ned Van Alstyne	177	“ Buy the dirty sheet ? No , of course not ; some fellow showed it to me — but I ’d heard the stories before . When a girl ’s as good - looking as that she ’d better marry ; then no questions are asked . In our imperfectly organized society there is no provision as yet for the young woman who claims the privileges of marriage without assuming its obligations . ”
72840	72858	72859	72860	Mrs. Fisher	135	“ Well , I understand Lily is about to assume them in the shape of Mr. Rosedale , ”
72866	72872	72874	72875	Van Alstyne	177	“ Rosedale — good heavens ! ”
72883	72897	72874	72875	Van Alstyne	177	“ Stepney , that ’s your fault for foisting the brute on us . ”
72898	72916	72917	72917	Stepney	125	“ Oh , confound it , you know , we do n’t MARRY Rosedale in our family , ”
72946	72962	72922	72937	his wife , who sat in oppressive bridal finery at the other side of the room	1856	“ In Lily ’s circumstances it ’s a mistake to have too high a standard . ”
72963	72976	72977	72978	Mrs. Fisher	135	“ I hear even Rosedale has been scared by the talk lately , ”
72981	73038	72977	72978	Mrs. Fisher	135	“ but the sight of her last night sent him off his head . What do you think he said to me after her TABLEAU ? ‘ My God , Mrs. Fisher , if I could get Paul Morpeth to paint her like that , the picture’d appreciate a hundred per cent in ten years . ’ ”
73039	73048	73050	73051	Van Alstyne	177	“ By Jove,—but is n’t she about somewhere ? ”
73061	73098	73050	73051	Van Alstyne	177	“ No ; she ran off while you were all mixing the punch down stairs . Where was she going , by the way ? What ’s on tonight ? I had n’t heard of anything . ”
73099	73109	73111	73118	an inexperienced young Farish who had arrived late	1858	“ Oh , not a party , I think , ”
73120	73143	73111	73118	an inexperienced young Farish who had arrived late	1858	“ I put her in her cab as I was coming in , and she gave the driver the Trenors ’ address . ”
73144	73149	73151	73153	Mrs. Jack Stepney	125	“ The Trenors ’ ? ”
73155	73171	73151	73153	Mrs. Jack Stepney	125	“ Why , the house is closed — Judy telephoned me from Bellomont this evening . ”
73172	73216	73217	73217	he	1859	“ Did she ? That ’s queer . I ’m sure I ’m not mistaken . Well , come now , Trenor ’s there , anyhow — I — oh , well — the fact is , I ’ve no head for numbers , ”
73287	73306	73284	73284	Lily	109	“ It seems to me you spend a good deal of time in the element you disapprove of . ”
73620	73688	73610	73611	Van Alstyne	177	“ Walking ? A good thing to blow the smoke out of one ’s head . Now that women have taken to tobacco we live in a bath of nicotine . It would be a curious thing to study the effect of cigarettes on the relation of the sexes . Smoke is almost as great a solvent as divorce : both tend to obscure the moral issue . ”
73790	73905	73906	73906	Selden	108	“ That Greiner house , now — a typical rung in the social ladder ! The man who built it came from a MILIEU where all the dishes are put on the table at once . His facade is a complete architectural meal ; if he had omitted a style his friends might have thought the money had given out . Not a bad purchase for Rosedale , though : attracts attention , and awes the Western sight - seer . By and bye he ’ll get out of that phase , and want something that the crowd will pass and the few pause before . Especially if he marries my clever cousin — — ”
73913	73931	73906	73906	Selden	108	“ And the Wellington Brys ’ ? Rather clever of its kind , do n’t you think ? ”
73958	74195	74196	74196	He	1875	“ That ’s the next stage : the desire to imply that one has been to Europe , and has a standard . I ’m sure Mrs. Bry thinks her house a copy of the TRIANON ; in America every marble house with gilt furniture is thought to be a copy of the TRIANON . What a clever chap that architect is , though — how he takes his client ’s measure ! He has put the whole of Mrs. Bry in his use of the composite order . Now for the Trenors , you remember , he chose the Corinthian : exuberant , but based on the best precedent . The Trenor house is one of his best things — doesn’t look like a banqueting - hall turned inside out . I hear Mrs. Trenor wants to build out a new ball - room , and that divergence from Gus on that point keeps her at Bellomont . The dimensions of the Brys ’ ball - room must rankle : you may be sure she knows ’em as well as if she ’d been there last night with a yard - measure . Who said she was in town , by the way ? That Farish boy ? She is n’t , I know ; Mrs. Stepney was right ; the house is dark , you see : I suppose Gus lives in the back . ”
74232	74310	74316	74317	Van Alstyne	236	“ They ’ve bought the house at the back : it gives them a hundred and fifty feet in the side street . There ’s where the ball - room ’s to be , with a gallery connecting it : billiard - room and so on above . I suggested changing the entrance , and carrying the drawing - room across the whole Fifth Avenue front ; you see the front door corresponds with the windows — — ”
74325	74328	74316	74317	Van Alstyne	236	“ Hallo ! ”
74441	74481	74429	74430	Van Alstyne	236	“ A — hem — nothing of this , eh , Selden ? As one of the family , I know I may count on you — appearances are deceptive — and Fifth Avenue is so imperfectly lighted — — ”
74482	74485	74487	74487	Selden	108	“ Goodnight , ”
75500	75507	75508	75508	she	112	“ Lily — what is it ? ”
75532	75549	75511	75512	Miss Bart	109	“ I was so cold — I could n’t go home . Have you a fire ? ”
75621	75636	75637	75637	She	112	“ There is kindling wood here : the fire will burn in a minute . ”
75686	75693	75683	75683	Lily	109	“ I could n’t go home . ”
75694	75722	75723	75723	Gerty	112	“ No — no — you came here , dear ! You ’re cold and tired — sit quiet , and I ’ll make you some tea . ”
75816	75829	75830	75830	she	112	“ I came here because I could n’t bear to be alone , ”
75843	75855	75833	75833	Gerty	112	“ Lily ! Something has happened — can’t you tell me ? ”
75856	75884	75885	75885	She	109	“ I could n’t bear to lie awake in my room till morning . I hate my room at Aunt Julia’s — so I came here — — ”
75905	75950	75885	75885	She	109	“ Oh , Gerty , the furies . . . you know the noise of their wings — alone , at night , in the dark ? But you do n’t know — there is nothing to make the dark dreadful to you — — ”
75988	76030	76031	76032	Miss Farish	113	“ You ’ll let me stay ? I sha n’t mind when daylight comes — Is it late ? Is the night nearly over ? It must be awful to be sleepless — everything stands by the bed and stares — — ”
76038	76080	76031	76032	Miss Farish	113	“ Lily , look at me ! Something has happened — an accident ? You have been frightened — what has frightened you ? Tell me if you can — a word or two — so that I can help you . ”
76086	76171	76083	76083	her	109	“ I am not frightened : that ’s not the word . Can you imagine looking into your glass some morning and seeing a disfigurement — some hideous change that has come to you while you slept ? Well , I seem to myself like that — I ca n’t bear to see myself in my own thoughts — I hate ugliness , you know — I’ve always turned from it — but I ca n’t explain to you — you would n’t understand . ”
76184	76293	76172	76172	She	109	“ How long the night is ! And I know I sha n’t sleep tomorrow . Some one told me my father used to lie sleepless and think of horrors . And he was not wicked , only unfortunate — and I see now how he must have suffered , lying alone with his thoughts ! But I am bad — a bad girl — all my thoughts are bad — I have always had bad people about me . Is that any excuse ? I thought I could manage my own life — I was proud — proud ! but now I ’m on their level — — ”
76394	76423	76389	76389	she	1916	“ There are bad girls in your slums . Tell me — do they ever pick themselves up ? Ever forget , and feel as they did before ? ”
76424	76436	76389	76389	she	1916	“ Lily ! you must n’t speak so — you’re dreaming . ”
76437	76465	76466	76466	She	1916	“ Do n’t they always go from bad to worse ? There ’s no turning back — your old self rejects you , and shuts you out . ”
76479	76526	76527	76527	She	1916	“ Go to bed , dear ! You work hard and get up early . I ’ll watch here by the fire , and you ’ll leave the light , and your door open . All I want is to feel that you are near me . ”
76550	76579	76580	76580	Gerty	112	“ I ca n’t leave you , Lily . Come and lie on my bed . Your hands are frozen — you must undress and be made warm . ”
76586	76601	76580	76580	Gerty	112	“ But Mrs. Peniston — it ’s past midnight ! What will she think ? ”
76602	76625	76527	76527	She	1916	“ She goes to bed . I have a latchkey . It does n’t matter — I ca n’t go back there . ”
76626	76659	76660	76660	She	1922	“ There ’s no need to : you shall stay here . But you must tell me where you have been . Listen , Lily — it will help you to speak ! ”
76673	76696	76697	76697	Gerty	112	“ Try to tell me — it will clear your poor head . Listen — you were dining at Carry Fisher ’s . ”
76707	76717	76697	76697	Gerty	112	“ Lawrence Selden went from here to find you . ”
76747	76789	76737	76737	Her	1922	“ He went to find me ? And I missed him ! Oh , Gerty , he tried to help me . He told me — he warned me long ago — he foresaw that I should grow hateful to myself ! ”
77048	77209	77038	77038	Lily	109	“ Gerty , you know him — you understand him — tell me ; if I went to him , if I told him everything — if I said : ‘ I am bad through and through — I want admiration , I want excitement , I want money — ’ yes , MONEY ! That ’s my shame , Gerty — and it ’s known , it ’s said of me — it ’s what men think of me — If I said it all to him — told him the whole story — said plainly : ‘ I ’ve sunk lower than the lowest , for I ’ve taken what they take , and not paid as they pay’—oh , Gerty , you know him , you can speak for him : if I told him everything would he loathe me ? Or would he pity me , and understand me , and save me from loathing myself ? ”
77267	77274	77263	77263	her	112	“ He is like other men ? ”
77324	77336	77337	77337	she	112	“ Yes : I know him ; he will help you , ”
77577	77593	77594	77594	she	109	“ Hold me , Gerty , hold me , or I shall think of things , ”
78092	78114	78115	78115	she	109	“ I must have been over - tired last night ; I think I had a nervous attack in the carriage , ”
78128	78142	78143	78143	Gerty	112	“ You were not well ; I am so glad you came here , ”
78146	78160	78143	78143	Gerty	112	“ But how am I to get home ? And Aunt Julia — ? ”
78161	78190	78191	78191	Lily	109	“ She knows ; I telephoned early , and your maid has brought your things . But wo n’t you eat something ? I scrambled the eggs myself . ”
78818	78838	78839	78839	she	114	“ You ’re a bad colour , Lily : this incessant rushing about is beginning to tell on you , ”
78848	78865	78866	78866	she	114	“ I do n’t think it ’s that , Aunt Julia ; I ’ve had worries , ”
78869	78872	78874	78875	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ Ah , ”
78891	78901	78902	78902	Lily	109	“ I ’m sorry to bother you with them , ”
78905	78922	78902	78902	Lily	109	“ but I really believe my faintness last night was brought on partly by anxious thoughts — ”
78923	78982	78878	78878	her	114	“ I should have said Carry Fisher ’s cook was enough to account for it . She has a woman who was with Maria Melson in 1891 — the spring of the year we went to Aix — and I remember dining there two days before we sailed , and feeling SURE the coppers had n’t been scoured . ”
78983	78999	79000	79000	Lily	109	“ I do n’t think I ate much ; I ca n’t eat or sleep . ”
79008	79021	79000	79000	Lily	109	“ The fact is , Aunt Julia , I owe some money . ”
79051	79058	79040	79040	She	114	“ I have been foolish — — ”
79059	79068	79069	79070	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ No doubt you have : extremely foolish , ”
79073	79102	79069	79070	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ I fail to see how any one with your income , and no expenses — not to mention the handsome presents I ’ve always given you — — ”
79103	79139	79040	79040	She	114	“ Oh , you ’ve been most generous , Aunt Julia ; I shall never forget your kindness . But perhaps you do n’t quite realize the expense a girl is put to nowadays — — ”
79140	79180	79181	79181	Lily	109	“ I do n’t realize that YOU are put to any expense except for your clothes and your railway fares . I expect you to be handsomely dressed ; but I paid Celeste ’s bill for you last October . ”
79195	79215	79181	79181	Lily	109	“ You were as kind as possible ; but I have had to get a few things since — — ”
79216	79244	79293	79294	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ What kind of things ? Clothes ? How much have you spent ? Let me see the bill — I daresay the woman is swindling you . ”
79245	79284	79293	79294	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ Oh , no , I think not : clothes have grown so frightfully expensive ; and one needs so many different kinds , with country visits , and golf and skating , and Aiken and Tuxedo — — ”
79285	79292	79293	79294	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ Let me see the bill , ”
79335	79381	79382	79382	She	109	“ She has n’t sent in the bill for my winter things , but I KNOW it ’s large ; and there are one or two other things ; I ’ve been careless and imprudent — I’m frightened to think of what I owe — — ”
79428	79470	79422	79423	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ Really , Lily , you are old enough to manage your own affairs , and after frightening me to death by your performance of last night you might at least choose a better time to worry me with such matters . ”
79485	79500	79501	79501	she	114	“ If you owe Celeste another thousand , she may send me her account , ”
79514	79558	79501	79501	she	114	“ I am very sorry , Aunt Julia ; I hate to trouble you at such a time ; but I have really no choice — I ought to have spoken sooner — I owe a great deal more than a thousand dollars . ”
79559	79576	79422	79423	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ A great deal more ? Do you owe two ? She must have robbed you ! ”
79577	79602	79501	79501	she	114	“ I told you it was not only Celeste . I — there are other bills — more pressing — that must be settled . ”
79603	79622	79624	79625	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ What on earth have you been buying ? Jewelry ? You must have gone off your head , ”
79629	79706	79624	79625	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ But if you have run into debt , you must suffer the consequences , and put aside your monthly income till your bills are paid . If you stay quietly here until next spring , instead of racing about all over the country , you will have no expenses at all , and surely in four or five months you can settle the rest of your bills if I pay the dress - maker now . ”
79777	79793	79794	79794	she	109	“ The debts I speak of are — different — not like tradesmen ’s bills , ”
79826	79884	79885	79885	She	109	“ The fact is , I ’ve played cards a good deal — bridge ; the women all do it ; girls too — it ’s expected . Sometimes I ’ve won — won a good deal — but lately I ’ve been unlucky — and of course such debts ca n’t be paid off gradually — — ”
79900	79998	79897	79897	she	114	“ Cards — you’ve played cards for money ? It ’s true , then : when I was told so I would n’t believe it . I wo n’t ask if the other horrors I was told were true too ; I ’ve heard enough for the state of my nerves . When I think of the example you ’ve had in this house ! But I suppose it ’s your foreign bringing - up — no one knew where your mother picked up her friends . And her Sundays were a scandal — that I know . ”
80005	80012	79999	80000	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ You play cards on Sunday ? ”
80029	80088	80089	80090	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ You ’re hard on me , Aunt Julia : I have never really cared for cards , but a girl hates to be thought priggish and superior , and one drifts into doing what the others do . I ’ve had a dreadful lesson , and if you ’ll help me out this time I promise you — ”
80096	80124	80092	80092	her	114	“ You need n’t make any promises : it ’s unnecessary . When I offered you a home I did n’t undertake to pay your gambling debts . ”
80125	80140	80089	80090	Mrs. Peniston	114	“ Aunt Julia ! You do n’t mean that you wo n’t help me ? ”
80141	80184	80185	80185	Lily	109	“ I shall certainly not do anything to give the impression that I countenance your behaviour . If you really owe your dress - maker , I will settle with her — beyond that I recognize no obligation to assume your debts . ”
80212	80223	80185	80185	Lily	109	“ Aunt Julia , I shall be disgraced — I — ”
80260	80380	80381	80381	Lily	109	“ I consider that you ARE disgraced , Lily : disgraced by your conduct far more than by its results . You say your friends have persuaded you to play cards with them ; well , they may as well learn a lesson too . They can probably afford to lose a little money — and at any rate , I am not going to waste any of mine in paying them . And now I must ask you to leave me — this scene has been extremely painful , and I have my own health to consider . Draw down the blinds , please ; and tell Jennings I will see no one this afternoon but Grace Stepney . ”
80679	80688	80675	80675	Gerty	112	“ I know him — he will help you ”
81283	81463	81464	81464	He	124	“ Pretty well done — well , yes , I suppose it was : Welly Bry ’s got his back up and do n’t mean to let go till he ’s got the hang of the thing . Of course , there were things here and there — things Mrs. Fisher could n’t be expected to see to — the champagne was n’t cold , and the coats got mixed in the coat - room . I would have spent more money on the music . But that ’s my character : if I want a thing I ’m willing to pay : I do n’t go up to the counter , and then wonder if the article ’s worth the price . I would n’t be satisfied to entertain like the Welly Brys ; I ’d want something that would look more easy and natural , more as if I took it in my stride . And it takes just two things to do that , Miss Bart : money , and the right woman to spend it . ”
81481	81488	81489	81489	he	124	“ I ’ve got the money , ”
81496	81513	81489	81489	he	124	“ and what I want is the woman — and I mean to have her too . ”
81646	81654	81655	81655	he	124	“ I mean to have her too , ”
81669	81899	81655	81655	he	124	“ I generally HAVE got what I wanted in life , Miss Bart . I wanted money , and I ’ve got more than I know how to invest ; and now the money does n’t seem to be of any account unless I can spend it on the right woman . That ’s what I want to do with it : I want my wife to make all the other women feel small . I ’d never grudge a dollar that was spent on that . But it is n’t every woman can do it , no matter how much you spend on her . There was a girl in some history book who wanted gold shields , or something , and the fellows threw ’em at her , and she was crushed under ’em : they killed her . Well , that ’s true enough : some women looked buried under their jewelry . What I want is a woman who ’ll hold her head higher the more diamonds I put on it . And when I looked at you the other night at the Brys ’ , in that plain white dress , looking as if you had a crown on , I said to myself : ‘ By gad , if she had one she ’d wear it as if it grew on her . ’ ”
81915	82036	81907	81907	he	1993	“ Tell you what it is , though , that kind of woman costs more than all the rest of ’em put together . If a woman ’s going to ignore her pearls , they want to be better than anybody else’s — and so it is with everything else . You know what I mean — you know it ’s only the showy things that are cheap . Well , I should want my wife to be able to take the earth for granted if she wanted to . I know there ’s one thing vulgar about money , and that ’s the thinking about it ; and my wife would never have to demean herself in that way . ”
82053	82069	82037	82037	He	1993	“ I guess you know the lady I ’ve got in view , Miss Bart . ”
82157	82190	82149	82149	She	109	“ If you mean me , Mr. Rosedale , I am very grateful — very much flattered ; but I do n’t know what I have ever done to make you think — ”
82191	82338	82339	82339	He	1996	“ Oh , if you mean you ’re not dead in love with me , I ’ve got sense enough left to see that . And I ai n’t talking to you as if you were — I presume I know the kind of talk that ’s expected under those circumstances . I ’m confoundedly gone on you — that ’s about the size of it — and I ’m just giving you a plain business statement of the consequences . You ’re not very fond of me — YET — but you ’re fond of luxury , and style , and amusement , and of not having to worry about cash . You like to have a good time , and not have to settle for it ; and what I propose to do is to provide for the good time and do the settling . ”
82350	82371	82343	82343	she	1997	“ You are mistaken in one point , Mr. Rosedale : whatever I enjoy I am prepared to settle for . ”
82425	82563	82417	82417	he	1996	“ I did n’t mean to give offence ; excuse me if I ’ve spoken too plainly . But why ai n’t you straight with me — why do you put up that kind of bluff ? You know there ’ve been times when you were bothered — damned bothered — and as a girl gets older , and things keep moving along , why , before she knows it , the things she wants are liable to move past her and not come back . I do n’t say it ’s anywhere near that with you yet ; but you ’ve had a taste of bothers that a girl like yourself ought never to have known about , and what I ’m offering you is the chance to turn your back on them once for all . ”
82750	82876	82877	82877	She	2001	“ You are quite right , Mr. Rosedale . I HAVE had bothers ; and I am grateful to you for wanting to relieve me of them . It is not always easy to be quite independent and self - respecting when one is poor and lives among rich people ; I have been careless about money , and have worried about my bills . But I should be selfish and ungrateful if I made that a reason for accepting all you offer , with no better return to make than the desire to be free from my anxieties . You must give me time — time to think of your kindness — and of what I could give you in return for it — — ”
83248	83271	83272	83272	She	109	“ Mr. Lawrence Selden was among the passengers sailing this afternoon for Havana and the West Indies on the Windward Liner Antilles . ”
83458	83461	83431	83431	she	109	“ Dear Mr. Rosedale”—but
83491	83498	83488	83488	she	109	“ I have been thinking — — ”
83657	83672	83649	83650	Bertha Dorset	133	“ Sailing unexpectedly tomorrow . Will you join us on a cruise in Mediterranean ? ”
84290	84294	84341	84341	Selden	108	“ costume - plays ”
84358	84364	84365	84366	Mrs. Fisher	135	“ Why , Mr. Selden ! ”
84388	84403	84384	84384	she	135	“ We ’re starving to death because we ca n’t decide where to lunch . ”
84458	84512	84513	84514	Mrs. Bry	198	“ Of course one gets the best things at the TERRASSE — but that looks as if one had n’t any other reason for being there : the Americans who do n’t know any one always rush for the best food . And the Duchess of Beltshire has taken up Becassin ’s lately , ”
84588	84625	84567	84568	Mr. Bry	245	“ I guess the Duchess goes where it ’s cheapest , unless she can get her meal paid for . If you offered to blow her off at the TERRASSE she ’d turn up fast enough . ”
84632	84661	84627	84629	Mrs. Jack Stepney	125	“ The Grand Dukes go to that little place at the Condamine . Lord Hubert says it ’s the only restaurant in Europe where they can cook peas . ”
84702	84708	84685	84685	his	176	“ It ’s quite that . ”
84709	84712	84714	84715	Mr. Bry	245	“ PEAS ? ”
84718	84728	84729	84729	he	245	“ Can they cook terrapin ? It just shows , ”
84732	84749	84729	84729	he	245	“ what these European markets are , when a fellow can make a reputation cooking peas ! ”
84756	84800	84801	84801	Stepney	125	“ I do n’t know that I quite agree with Dacey : there ’s a little hole in Paris , off the Quai Voltaire — but in any case , I ca n’t advise the Condamine GARGOTE ; at least not with ladies . ”
84851	84860	84861	84861	she	592	“ That ’s where we ’ll go then ! ”
84872	84926	84861	84861	she	592	“ I ’m so tired of the TERRASSE : it ’s as dull as one of mother ’s dinners . And Lord Hubert has promised to tell us who all the awful people are at the other place — hasn’t he , Carry ? Now , Jack , do n’t look so solemn ! ”
84927	84930	84932	84933	Mrs. Bry	198	“ Well , ”
84935	84949	84932	84933	Mrs. Bry	198	“ all I want to know is who their dress - makers are . ”
84950	84960	84962	84962	Stepney	125	“ No doubt Dacey can tell you that too , ”
84977	84988	84969	84970	the other	367	“ I can at least FIND OUT , my dear fellow ”
85172	85184	85185	85185	Stepney	125	“ By Jove , I believe that ’s the Dorsets back ! ”
85201	85209	85193	85193	his	176	“ It ’s the Sabrina — yes . ”
85210	85223	85224	85225	Mrs. Fisher	135	“ So soon ? They were to spend a month in Sicily , ”
85228	85253	85255	85256	Mr. Bry	245	“ I guess they feel as if they had : there ’s only one up - to - date hotel in the whole place , ”
85259	85279	85280	85281	Mrs. Fisher	135	“ It was Ned Silverton ’s idea — but poor Dorset and Lily Bart must have been horribly bored . ”
85289	85300	85280	85281	Mrs. Fisher	135	“ I do hope there has n’t been a row . ”
85301	85312	85314	85315	Lord Hubert	176	“ It ’s most awfully jolly having Miss Bart back , ”
85329	85345	85324	85325	Mrs. Bry	198	“ I daresay the Duchess will dine with us , now that Lily ’s here . ”
85346	85365	85366	85367	Lord Hubert	176	“ The Duchess admires her immensely : I ’m sure she ’d be charmed to have it arranged , ”
85398	85407	85408	85409	Mrs. Fisher	135	“ Lily has been a tremendous success here , ”
85419	85496	85414	85414	herself	135	“ She looks ten years younger — I never saw her so handsome . Lady Skiddaw took her everywhere in Cannes , and the Crown Princess of Macedonia had her to stop for a week at Cimiez . People say that was one reason why Bertha whisked the yacht off to Sicily : the Crown Princess did n’t take much notice of her , and she could n’t bear to look on at Lily ’s triumph . ”
86122	86134	86135	86136	Mrs. Fisher	135	“ But things are not going as well as I expected , ”
86140	86348	86135	86136	Mrs. Fisher	135	“ It ’s all very well to say that every body with money can get into society ; but it would be truer to say that NEARLY everybody can . And the London market is so glutted with new Americans that , to succeed there now , they must be either very clever or awfully queer . The Brys are neither . HE would get on well enough if she ’d let him alone ; they like his slang and his brag and his blunders . But Louisa spoils it all by trying to repress him and put herself forward . If she ’d be natural herself — fat and vulgar and bouncing — it would be all right ; but as soon as she meets anybody smart she tries to be slender and queenly . She tried it with the Duchess of Beltshire and Lady Skiddaw , and they fled . I ’ve done my best to make her see her mistake — I’ve said to her again and again : ‘ Just let yourself go , Louisa ’ ; but she keeps up the humbug even with me — I believe she keeps on being queenly in her own room , with the door shut . “
86355	86361	86363	86363	she	2085	” Mrs. Fisher went on , “
86646	86665	86634	86634	she	109	” Mrs. Fisher paused and looked reflectively at the deep shimmer of sea between the cactus - flowers . “
86668	86672	86634	86634	she	109	” she added , “
86715	86732	86691	86691	she	114	” She glanced tentatively at Selden ’s motionless profile , and resumed with a slight sigh : “
86801	86815	86798	86799	Neddy Silverton	252	” She met Selden ’s sound of protest with a sharp derisive glance . “
87037	87044	87024	87024	she	109	” Selden tossed away his cigarette . “
87055	87075	87046	87046	Jove	169	” he exclaimed , with a glance at his watch ; adding , in reply to Mrs. Fisher ’s surprised comment—“Why
87084	87100	87046	87046	Jove	169	Monte!”—a murmured word to the effect that he was making Nice his head - quarters . “
87113	87218	87107	87107	she	109	” he heard irrelevantly flung after him . Ten minutes later , in the high - perched bedroom of an hotel overlooking the Casino , he was tossing his effects into a couple of gaping portmanteaux , while the porter waited outside to transport them to the cab at the door . It took but a brief plunge down the steep white road to the station to land him safely in the afternoon express for Nice ; and not till he was installed in the corner of an empty carriage , did he exclaim to himself , with a reaction of self - contempt : “
87228	87673	87107	87107	she	109	” The pertinence of the question checked Selden ’s fugitive impulse before the train had started . It was ridiculous to be flying like an emotional coward from an infatuation his reason had conquered . He had instructed his bankers to forward some important business letters to Nice , and at Nice he would quietly await them . He was already annoyed with himself for having left Monte Carlo , where he had intended to pass the week which remained to him before sailing ; but it would now be difficult to return on his steps without an appearance of inconsistency from which his pride recoiled . In his inmost heart he was not sorry to put himself beyond the probability of meeting Miss Bart . Completely as he had detached himself from her , he could not yet regard her merely as a social instance ; and viewed in a more personal ways she was not likely to be a reassuring object of study . Chance encounters , or even the repeated mention of her name , would send his thoughts back into grooves from which he had resolutely detached them ; whereas , if she could be entirely excluded from his life , the pressure of new and varied impressions , with which no thought of her was connected , would soon complete the work of separation . Mrs. Fisher ’s conversation had , indeed , operated to that end ; but the treatment was too painful to be voluntarily chosen while milder remedies were untried ; and Selden thought he could trust himself to return gradually to a reasonable view of Miss Bart , if only he did not see her . Having reached the station early , he had arrived at this point in his reflections before the increasing throng on the platform warned him that he could not hope to preserve his privacy ; the next moment there was a hand on the door , and he turned to confront the very face he was fleeing . Miss Bart , glowing with the haste of a precipitate descent upon the train , headed a group composed of the Dorsets , young Silverton and Lord Hubert Dacey , who had barely time to spring into the carriage , and envelop Selden in ejaculations of surprise and welcome , before the whistle of departure sounded . The party , it appeared , were hastening to Nice in response to a sudden summons to dine with the Duchess of Beltshire and to see the water - fete in the bay ; a plan evidently improvised — in spite of Lord Hubert ’s protesting “
87680	88113	87676	87676	I	0	know,”—for the express purpose of defeating Mrs. Bry ’s endeavour to capture the Duchess . During the laughing relation of this manoeuvre , Selden had time for a rapid impression of Miss Bart , who had seated herself opposite to him in the golden afternoon light . Scarcely three months had elapsed since he had parted from her on the threshold of the Brys ’ conservatory ; but a subtle change had passed over the quality of her beauty . Then it had had a transparency through which the fluctuations of the spirit were sometimes tragically visible ; now its impenetrable surface suggested a process of crystallization which had fused her whole being into one hard brilliant substance . The change had struck Mrs. Fisher as a rejuvenation : to Selden it seemed like that moment of pause and arrest when the warm fluidity of youth is chilled into its final shape . He felt it in the way she smiled on him , and in the readiness and competence with which , flung unexpectedly into his presence , she took up the thread of their intercourse as though that thread had not been snapped with a violence from which he still reeled . Such facility sickened him — but he told himself that it was with the pang which precedes recovery . Now he would really get well — would eject the last drop of poison from his blood . Already he felt himself calmer in her presence than he had learned to be in the thought of her . Her assumptions and elisions , her short - cuts and long DETOURS , the skill with which she contrived to meet him at a point from which no inconvenient glimpses of the past were visible , suggested what opportunities she had had for practising such arts since their last meeting . He felt that she had at last arrived at an understanding with herself : had made a pact with her rebellious impulses , and achieved a uniform system of self - government , under which all vagrant tendencies were either held captive or forced into the service of the state . And he saw other things too in her manner : saw how it had adjusted itself to the hidden intricacies of a situation in which , even after Mrs. Fisher ’s elucidating flashes , he still felt himself agrope . Surely Mrs. Fisher could no longer charge Miss Bart with neglecting her opportunities ! To Selden ’s exasperated observation she was only too completely alive to them . She was “
88115	88394	89183	89183	Jove	169	” to every one : subservient to Bertha ’s anxious predominance , good - naturedly watchful of Dorset ’s moods , brightly companionable to Silverton and Dacey , the latter of whom met her on an evident footing of old admiration , while young Silverton , portentously self - absorbed , seemed conscious of her only as of something vaguely obstructive . And suddenly , as Selden noted the fine shades of manner by which she harmonized herself with her surroundings , it flashed on him that , to need such adroit handling , the situation must indeed be desperate . She was on the edge of something — that was the impression left with him . He seemed to see her poised on the brink of a chasm , with one graceful foot advanced to assert her unconsciousness that the ground was failing her . On the Promenade des Anglais , where Ned Silverton hung on him for the half hour before dinner , he received a deeper impression of the general insecurity . Silverton was in a mood of Titanic pessimism . How any one could come to such a damned hole as the Riviera — any one with a grain of imagination — with the whole Mediterranean to choose from : but then , if one ’s estimate of a place depended on the way they broiled a spring chicken ! Gad ! what a study might be made of the tyranny of the stomach — the way a sluggish liver or insufficient gastric juices might affect the whole course of the universe , overshadow everything in reach — chronic dyspepsia ought to be among the “
88397	89181	89183	89183	Jove	169	” ; a woman ’s life might be ruined by a man ’s inability to digest fresh bread . Grotesque ? Yes — and tragic — like most absurdities . There ’s nothing grimmer than the tragedy that wears a comic mask .... Where was he ? Oh — the reason they chucked Sicily and rushed back ? Well — partly , no doubt , Miss Bart ’s desire to get back to bridge and smartness . Dead as a stone to art and poetry — the light never WAS on sea or land for her ! And of course she persuaded Dorset that the Italian food was bad for him . Oh , she could make him believe anything — ANYTHING ! Mrs. Dorset was aware of it — oh , perfectly : nothing SHE did n’t see ! But she could hold her tongue — she’d had to , often enough . Miss Bart was an intimate friend — she would n’t hear a word against her . Only it hurts a woman ’s pride — there are some things one does n’t get used to .... All this in confidence , of course ? Ah — and there were the ladies signalling from the balcony of the hotel .... He plunged across the Promenade , leaving Selden to a meditative cigar . The conclusions it led him to were fortified , later in the evening , by some of those faint corroborative hints that generate a light of their own in the dusk of a doubting mind . Selden , stumbling on a chance acquaintance , had dined with him , and adjourned , still in his company , to the brightly lit Promenade , where a line of crowded stands commanded the glittering darkness of the waters . The night was soft and persuasive . Overhead hung a summer sky furrowed with the rush of rockets ; and from the east a late moon , pushing up beyond the lofty bend of the coast , sent across the bay a shaft of brightness which paled to ashes in the red glitter of the illuminated boats . Down the lantern - hung Promenade , snatches of band - music floated above the hum of the crowd and the soft tossing of boughs in dusky gardens ; and between these gardens and the backs of the stands there flowed a stream of people in whom the vociferous carnival mood seemed tempered by the growing languor of the season . Selden and his companion , unable to get seats on one of the stands facing the bay , had wandered for a while with the throng , and then found a point of vantage on a high garden - parapet above the Promenade . Thence they caught but a triangular glimpse of the water , and of the flashing play of boats across its surface ; but the crowd in the street was under their immediate view , and seemed to Selden , on the whole , of more interest than the show itself . After a while , however , he wearied of his perch and , dropping alone to the pavement , pushed his way to the first corner and turned into the moonlit silence of a side street . Long garden - walls overhung by trees made a dark boundary to the pavement ; an empty cab trailed along the deserted thoroughfare , and presently Selden saw two persons emerge from the opposite shadows , signal to the cab , and drive off in it toward the centre of the town . The moonlight touched them as they paused to enter the carriage , and he recognized Mrs. Dorset and young Silverton . Beneath the nearest lamp - post he glanced at his watch and saw that the time was close on eleven . He took another cross street , and without breasting the throng on the Promenade , made his way to the fashionable club which overlooks that thoroughfare . Here , amid the blaze of crowded baccarat tables , he caught sight of Lord Hubert Dacey , seated with his habitual worn smile behind a rapidly dwindling heap of gold . The heap being in due course wiped out , Lord Hubert rose with a shrug , and joining Selden , adjourned with him to the deserted terrace of the club . It was now past midnight , and the throng on the stands was dispersing , while the long trails of red - lit boats scattered and faded beneath a sky repossessed by the tranquil splendour of the moon . Lord Hubert looked at his watch . “
89288	89301	89284	89286	some queer ones	2111	” He added tentatively , after pausing to grope for a cigarette : “
89330	89349	89315	89315	she	3567	” He lit Selden ’s proffered cigarette , and continued , in his high - pitched drawling tone : “
89391	89409	89371	89372	the Duchess	3567	” Selden received this in silence , and after a few puffs Lord Hubert broke out again : “
89519	90040	90042	90043	Miss Bart	109	” Chapter 2 Miss Bart , emerging late the next morning from her cabin , found herself alone on the deck of the Sabrina . The cushioned chairs , disposed expectantly under the wide awning , showed no signs of recent occupancy , and she presently learned from a steward that Mrs. Dorset had not yet appeared , and that the gentlemen — separately — had gone ashore as soon as they had breakfasted . Supplied with these facts , Lily leaned awhile over the side , giving herself up to a leisurely enjoyment of the spectacle before her . Unclouded sunlight enveloped sea and shore in a bath of purest radiancy . The purpling waters drew a sharp white line of foam at the base of the shore ; against its irregular eminences , hotels and villas flashed from the greyish verdure of olive and eucalyptus ; and the background of bare and finely - pencilled mountains quivered in a pale intensity of light . How beautiful it was — and how she loved beauty ! She had always felt that her sensibility in this direction made up for certain obtusenesses of feeling of which she was less proud ; and during the last three months she had indulged it passionately . The Dorsets ’ invitation to go abroad with them had come as an almost miraculous release from crushing difficulties ; and her faculty for renewing herself in new scenes , and casting off problems of conduct as easily as the surroundings in which they had arisen , made the mere change from one place to another seem , not merely a postponement , but a solution of her troubles . Moral complications existed for her only in the environment that had produced them ; she did not mean to slight or ignore them , but they lost their reality when they changed their background . She could not have remained in New York without repaying the money she owed to Trenor ; to acquit herself of that odious debt she might even have faced a marriage with Rosedale ; but the accident of placing the Atlantic between herself and her obligations made them dwindle out of sight as if they had been milestones and she had travelled past them . Her two months on the Sabrina had been especially calculated to aid this illusion of distance . She had been plunged into new scenes , and had found in them a renewal of old hopes and ambitions . The cruise itself charmed her as a romantic adventure . She was vaguely touched by the names and scenes amid which she moved , and had listened to Ned Silverton reading Theocritus by moonlight , as the yacht rounded the Sicilian promontories , with a thrill of the nerves that confirmed her belief in her intellectual superiority . But the weeks at Cannes and Nice had really given her more pleasure . The gratification of being welcomed in high company , and of making her own ascendency felt there , so that she found herself figuring once more as the “
90044	90430	90431	90431	She	2124	” in the interesting journal devoted to recording the least movements of her cosmopolitan companions — all these experiences tended to throw into the extreme background of memory the prosaic and sordid difficulties from which she had escaped . If she was faintly aware of fresh difficulties ahead , she was sure of her ability to meet them : it was characteristic of her to feel that the only problems she could not solve were those with which she was familiar . Meanwhile she could honestly be proud of the skill with which she had adapted herself to somewhat delicate conditions . She had reason to think that she had made herself equally necessary to her host and hostess ; and if only she had seen any perfectly irreproachable means of drawing a financial profit from the situation , there would have been no cloud on her horizon . The truth was that her funds , as usual , were inconveniently low ; and to neither Dorset nor his wife could this vulgar embarrassment be safely hinted . Still , the need was not a pressing one ; she could worry along , as she had so often done before , with the hope of some happy change of fortune to sustain her ; and meanwhile life was gay and beautiful and easy , and she was conscious of figuring not unworthily in such a setting . She was engaged to breakfast that morning with the Duchess of Beltshire , and at twelve o’clock she asked to be set ashore in the gig . Before this she had sent her maid to enquire if she might see Mrs. Dorset ; but the reply came back that the latter was tired , and trying to sleep . Lily thought she understood the reason of the rebuff . Her hostess had not been included in the Duchess ’s invitation , though she herself had made the most loyal efforts in that direction . But her grace was impervious to hints , and invited or omitted as she chose . It was not Lily ’s fault if Mrs. Dorset ’s complicated attitudes did not fall in with the Duchess ’s easy gait . The Duchess , who seldom explained herself , had not formulated her objection beyond saying : “
90458	90800	90454	90454	HE	245	” but Lily knew enough not to press the point , and was not altogether sorry to be thus distinguished at her friend ’s expense . Bertha certainly HAD grown tiresome since she had taken to poetry and Ned Silverton . On the whole , it was a relief to break away now and then from the Sabrina ; and the Duchess ’s little breakfast , organized by Lord Hubert with all his usual virtuosity , was the pleasanter to Lily for not including her travelling - companions . Dorset , of late , had grown more than usually morose and incalculable , and Ned Silverton went about with an air that seemed to challenge the universe . The freedom and lightness of the ducal intercourse made an agreeable change from these complications , and Lily was tempted , after luncheon , to adjourn in the wake of her companions to the hectic atmosphere of the Casino . She did not mean to play ; her diminished pocket - money offered small scope for the adventure ; but it amused her to sit on a divan , under the doubtful protection of the Duchess ’s back , while the latter hung above her stakes at a neighbouring table . The rooms were packed with the gazing throng which , in the afternoon hours , trickles heavily between the tables , like the Sunday crowd in a lion - house . In the stagnant flow of the mass , identities were hardly distinguishable ; but Lily presently saw Mrs. Bry cleaving her determined way through the doors , and , in the broad wake she left , the light figure of Mrs. Fisher bobbing after her like a row - boat at the stern of a tug . Mrs. Bry pressed on , evidently animated by the resolve to reach a certain point in the rooms ; but Mrs. Fisher , as she passed Lily , broke from her towing - line , and let herself float to the girl ’s side . “
90804	90823	90824	90824	I	0	” she echoed the latter ’s query , with an indifferent glance at Mrs. Bry ’s retreating back . “
90838	90848	90835	90835	her	2128	” And , as Lily exclaimed , she added : “
90934	90946	90929	90930	the Duchess	3567	” Mrs. Fisher indulged in a faint laugh at the remembrance . “
91002	91028	90993	90993	she	3567	” Lily murmured her commiseration . Impulses of sympathy came naturally to her , and it was instinctive to proffer her help to Mrs. Fisher . “
91059	91069	91050	91050	her	3567	” But Mrs. Fisher interposed with a decisive gesture . “
91167	91175	91190	91190	I	0	” She laughed again at the picture . “
91198	91199	91200	91200	Me	0	” “
91202	91210	91200	91200	Me	0	” Miss Bart joined in her amusement . “
91226	91227	91228	91228	You	2871	” “
91236	91246	91228	91228	You	2871	” Mrs. Fisher flashed a sharp glance at her . “
91262	91268	91252	91252	Lily	109	” Miss Bart coloured slowly . “
91290	91303	91270	91270	I	0	” Mrs. Fisher continued to probe her embarrassment with an unflinching eye . “
91325	91326	91321	91321	they	199	” “
91329	91330	91321	91321	they	199	” “
91368	91373	91357	91357	royalties	2142	” she ended earnestly , “
91384	91388	91357	91357	royalties	2142	” Lily smiled . “
91403	91404	91393	91393	I	0	” “
91421	91428	91411	91412	the Gormers	2144	” said Mrs. Fisher with simplicity . “
91441	91464	91465	91465	I	0	” Lily ’s smile again flowed into a slight laugh : her friend ’s importunity was beginning to strike her as irrelevant . “
91477	91481	91473	91474	the Brys	199	” she began . “
91497	91517	91491	91491	you	2147	” said Mrs. Fisher abruptly . She paused , and then , bending forward , with a lowered voice : “
91549	91554	91540	91540	I	0	” Miss Bart assented . “
91571	91572	91561	91561	you	2147	” “
91622	91623	91608	91608	he	2151	” “
91633	91653	91628	91628	he	2151	” Lily laughed , but her laugh faded into gravity under the prolonged implication of Mrs. Fisher ’s look . “
91724	91780	91716	91716	she	133	” Miss Bart made this announcement in the tone of one who presents , with careless assurance , a complete vindication ; but Mrs. Fisher received it in a manner almost inconsequent . She seemed to have lost sight of her friend ’s part in the incident : her inward vision had taken another slant . “
91797	91798	91793	91793	she	133	” “
91848	91853	91840	91840	you	2160	” Lily summed up . “
91879	91895	91870	91870	you	2160	” Mrs. Fisher rose — she had seen Mrs. Bry surging back in her direction . “
91933	91952	91927	91927	ME	0	” she explained ; and with a last hand - clasp and a last look , she added : “
91972	92446	91961	91961	she	133	” * * * * * Lily carried the impression of Mrs. Fisher ’s leave - taking away with her from the Casino doors . She had accomplished , before leaving , the first step toward her reinstatement in Mrs. Bry ’s good graces . An affable advance — a vague murmur that they must see more of each other — an allusive glance to a near future that was felt to include the Duchess as well as the Sabrina — how easily it was all done , if one possessed the knack of doing it ! She wondered at herself , as she had so often wondered , that , possessing the knack , she did not more consistently exercise it . But sometimes she was forgetful — and sometimes , could it be that she was proud ? Today , at any rate , she had been vaguely conscious of a reason for sinking her pride , had in fact even sunk it to the point of suggesting to Lord Hubert Dacey , whom she ran across on the Casino steps , that he might really get the Duchess to dine with the Brys , if SHE undertook to have them asked on the Sabrina . Lord Hubert had promised his help , with the readiness on which she could always count : it was his only way of ever reminding her that he had once been ready to do so much more for her . Her path , in short , seemed to smooth itself before her as she advanced ; yet the faint stir of uneasiness persisted . Had it been produced , she wondered , by her chance meeting with Selden ? She thought not — time and change seemed so completely to have relegated him to his proper distance . The sudden and exquisite reaction from her anxieties had had the effect of throwing the recent past so far back that even Selden , as part of it , retained a certain air of unreality . And he had made it so clear that they were not to meet again ; that he had merely dropped down to Nice for a day or two , and had almost his foot on the next steamer . No — that part of the past had merely surged up for a moment on the fleeing surface of events ; and now that it was submerged again , the uncertainty , the apprehension persisted . They grew to sudden acuteness as she caught sight of George Dorset descending the steps of the Hotel de Paris and making for her across the square . She had meant to drive down to the quay and regain the yacht ; but she now had the immediate impression that something more was to happen first . “
92459	92595	91961	91961	she	133	” he began , putting the second question before the first was answered , and not waiting for a reply to either before he directed her silently toward the comparative seclusion of the lower gardens . She detected in him at once all the signs of extreme nervous tension . The skin was puffed out under his sunken eyes , and its sallowness had paled to a leaden white against which his irregular eyebrows and long reddish moustache were relieved with a saturnine effect . His appearance , in short , presented an odd mixture of the bedraggled and the ferocious . He walked beside her in silence , with quick precipitate steps , till they reached the embowered slopes to the east of the Casino ; then , pulling up abruptly , he said : “
92601	92602	92597	92597	you	2163	” “
92616	92632	92610	92610	she	133	” He received this with a laugh like the whirring sound in a disabled clock . “
92659	92663	92649	92649	she	133	” he exclaimed . “
92667	92671	92649	92649	she	133	” Lily started . “
92681	92686	92687	92687	They	2167	” He laughed again . “
92702	92703	92696	92696	they	2167	” “
92708	92728	92696	92696	they	2167	” She hesitated , feeling at once how little even this necessity accounted for the fatal lapse of hours . “
92749	92766	92768	92768	they	2167	” the explanatory note made it almost seem as though he were putting the case for his wife—“and
92787	92788	92696	92696	they	2167	” “
92795	92821	92792	92792	I	0	” she affirmed , with the more earnestness because she was so nervously conscious that she did not ; and after a pause she added : “
92834	92835	92855	92855	you	2163	” “
92858	92886	92855	92855	you	2163	” She took this in what seemed the only possible way , with a laugh intended to sink the question itself in his humorous treatment of it . “
92915	92916	92969	92969	you	2163	” “
92924	92928	92969	92969	you	2163	” he agreed . “
92938	92939	92932	92932	You	2163	” “
92956	92957	92950	92950	I	0	” “
92978	92993	92969	92969	you	2163	” He stood still , dragging at his moustache with a lean weak hand . “
93006	93052	92998	92998	you	2163	” he said with sudden grimness . Again she was disconcerted by the abrupt change in his tone , and as in one flash she saw the peril of the moment , and the need of keeping her sense of it out of her eyes . “
93088	93112	93079	93079	Bertha	133	” She clung to the note bravely , though its futility was now plain to her in the glare of his miserable eyes . “
93119	93643	93079	93079	Bertha	133	” he broke out , with the hurt cry of a child ; and while she tried to merge her sympathy , and her resolve to ignore any cause for it , in one ambiguous murmur of deprecation , he dropped down on the bench near which they had paused , and poured out the wretchedness of his soul . It was a dreadful hour — an hour from which she emerged shrinking and seared , as though her lids had been scorched by its actual glare . It was not that she had never had premonitory glimpses of such an outbreak ; but rather because , here and there throughout the three months , the surface of life had shown such ominous cracks and vapours that her fears had always been on the alert for an upheaval . There had been moments when the situation had presented itself under a homelier yet more vivid image — that of a shaky vehicle , dashed by unbroken steeds over a bumping road , while she cowered within , aware that the harness wanted mending , and wondering what would give way first . Well — everything had given way now ; and the wonder was that the crazy outfit had held together so long . Her sense of being involved in the crash , instead of merely witnessing it from the road , was intensified by the way in which Dorset , through his furies of denunciation and wild reactions of self - contempt , made her feel the need he had of her , the place she had taken in his life . But for her , what ear would have been open to his cries ? And what hand but hers could drag him up again to a footing of sanity and self - respect ? All through the stress of the struggle with him , she had been conscious of something faintly maternal in her efforts to guide and uplift him . But for the present , if he clung to her , it was not in order to be dragged up , but to feel some one floundering in the depths with him : he wanted her to suffer with him , not to help him to suffer less . Happily for both , there was little physical strength to sustain his frenzy . It left him , collapsed and breathing heavily , to an apathy so deep and prolonged that Lily almost feared the passers - by would think it the result of a seizure , and stop to offer their aid . But Monte Carlo is , of all places , the one where the human bond is least close , and odd sights are the least arresting . If a glance or two lingered on the couple , no intrusive sympathy disturbed them ; and it was Lily herself who broke the silence by rising from her seat . With the clearing of her vision the sweep of peril had extended , and she saw that the post of danger was no longer at Dorset ’s side . “
93660	93674	93651	93651	I	0	” she urged . But he remained mutely resistant , and she added : “
93691	93692	93682	93682	You	2176	” “
93706	93717	93700	93700	I	0	” He sat up , roused by a new thought . “
93731	93745	93726	93726	I’ll	0	” Lily , at this , reseated herself with a cry of alarm . “
93752	93763	93726	93726	I’ll	0	” she protested . He swung round on her distrustfully . “
93789	93790	93774	93774	he	108	” “
93809	93810	93811	93811	You	0	” “
93847	93858	93859	93859	You	0	” He rose suddenly , straightening himself with an effort . “
93868	93875	93859	93859	You	0	” She looked at him kindly . “
93881	93904	93859	93859	You	0	” Then , after a moment ’s pondering , almost to her own surprise she broke out with a flash of inspiration : “
93924	93925	93914	93914	You	0	” “
93931	93945	93914	93914	You	0	” he mocked her ; but she left him with the smiling rejoinder : “
93963	94761	93914	93914	You	0	” It was past four already ; and when a cab had dropped her at the quay , and she stood waiting for the gig to put off for her , she began to wonder what had been happening on the yacht . Of Silverton ’s whereabouts there had been no mention . Had he returned to the Sabrina ? Or could Bertha — the dread alternative sprang on her suddenly — could Bertha , left to herself , have gone ashore to rejoin him ? Lily ’s heart stood still at the thought . All her concern had hitherto been for young Silverton , not only because , in such affairs , the woman ’s instinct is to side with the man , but because his case made a peculiar appeal to her sympathies . He was so desperately in earnest , poor youth , and his earnestness was of so different a quality from Bertha ’s , though hers too was desperate enough . The difference was that Bertha was in earnest only about herself , while he was in earnest about her . But now , at the actual crisis , this difference seemed to throw the weight of destitution on Bertha ’s side , since at least he had her to suffer for , and she had only herself . At any rate , viewed less ideally , all the disadvantages of such a situation were for the woman ; and it was to Bertha that Lily ’s sympathies now went out . She was not fond of Bertha Dorset , but neither was she without a sense of obligation , the heavier for having so little personal liking to sustain it . Bertha had been kind to her , they had lived together , during the last months , on terms of easy friendship , and the sense of friction of which Lily had recently become aware seemed to make it the more urgent that she should work undividedly in her friend ’s interest . It was in Bertha ’s interest , certainly , that she had despatched Dorset to consult with Lawrence Selden . Once the grotesqueness of the situation accepted , she had seen at a glance that it was the safest in which Dorset could find himself . Who but Selden could thus miraculously combine the skill to save Bertha with the obligation of doing so ? The consciousness that much skill would be required made Lily rest thankfully in the greatness of the obligation . Since he would HAVE to pull Bertha through she could trust him to find a way ; and she put the fulness of her trust in the telegram she managed to send him on her way to the quay . Thus far , then , Lily felt that she had done well ; and the conviction strengthened her for the task that remained . She and Bertha had never been on confidential terms , but at such a crisis the barriers of reserve must surely fall : Dorset ’s wild allusions to the scene of the morning made Lily feel that they were down already , and that any attempt to rebuild them would be beyond Bertha ’s strength . She pictured the poor creature shivering behind her fallen defences and awaiting with suspense the moment when she could take refuge in the first shelter that offered . If only that shelter had not already offered itself elsewhere ! As the gig traversed the short distance between the quay and the yacht , Lily grew more than ever alarmed at the possible consequences of her long absence . What if the wretched Bertha , finding in all the long hours no soul to turn to — but by this time Lily ’s eager foot was on the side - ladder , and her first step on the Sabrina showed the worst of her apprehensions to be unfounded ; for there , in the luxurious shade of the after - deck , the wretched Bertha , in full command of her usual attenuated elegance , sat dispensing tea to the Duchess of Beltshire and Lord Hubert . The sight filled Lily with such surprise that she felt that Bertha , at least , must read its meaning in her look , and she was proportionately disconcerted by the blankness of the look returned . But in an instant she saw that Mrs. Dorset had , of necessity , to look blank before the others , and that , to mitigate the effect of her own surprise , she must at once produce some simple reason for it . The long habit of rapid transitions made it easy for her to exclaim to the Duchess : “
94774	94857	94766	94766	you	0	” and this sufficed for the lady she addressed , if it was hardly enough for Lord Hubert . At least it opened the way to a lively explanation of how the Duchess was , in fact , going back the next moment , but had first rushed out to the yacht for a word with Mrs. Dorset on the subject of tomorrow ’s dinner — the dinner with the Brys , to which Lord Hubert had finally insisted on dragging them . “
94866	94894	94895	94896	Mr. Bry	245	” he explained , with a glance that appealed to Lily for some recognition of his promptness ; and the Duchess added , with her noble candour : “
94916	94970	94904	94904	he	245	” This led to some final pleasantries , in which , as it seemed to Lily , Mrs. Dorset bore her part with astounding bravery , and at the close of which Lord Hubert , from half way down the side - ladder , called back , with an air of numbering heads : “
94981	94982	94987	94987	him	245	” “
94989	95085	94987	94987	him	245	” his wife assented gaily . She was keeping up well to the last — but as she turned back from waving her adieux over the side , Lily said to herself that the mask must drop and the soul of fear look out . Mrs. Dorset turned back slowly ; perhaps she wanted time to steady her muscles ; at any rate , they were still under perfect control when , dropping once more into her seat behind the tea - table , she remarked to Miss Bart with a faint touch of irony : “
95095	95150	95088	95088	I	0	” If it was a cue , Lily was ready to take it , though with only the vaguest sense of what was expected of her in return . There was something unnerving in the contemplation of Mrs. Dorset ’s composure , and she had to force the light tone in which she answered : “
95166	95167	95151	95151	I	0	” “
95196	95211	95212	95212	You	2186	” She spoke very gently , but with just the least tinge of reproach . “
95224	95247	95216	95216	You	2186	” Now indeed Lily was too far adrift in bewilderment to measure the other ’s words or keep watch on her own . “
95266	95283	95249	95249	I	0	” Mrs. Dorset , examining her between lowered lids , met this with the immediate query : “
95289	95290	95291	95291	George	131	” “
95302	95303	95295	95295	him	2193	” “
95355	95377	95348	95348	you	2186	” Lily , still lost in conjecture , made no reply , and Mrs. Dorset settled herself indolently in her seat . “
95415	95462	95484	95484	You	2186	” This time Lily felt sure that a cue was being pressed on her ; but it was put forth with such startling suddenness , and with so incredible an air of ignoring what it led up to , that she could only falter out doubtfully : “
95466	95467	95484	95484	You	2186	” “
95504	95530	95484	95484	You	2186	” At that — at the complete unexpectedness and the inconceivable audacity of it — Lily could not restrain the tribute of an astonished laugh . “
95546	95556	95538	95538	you	2186	” Mrs. Dorset took this with an exquisite mildness . “
95608	95678	95682	95682	our	2198	” Lily ’s colour rose : it was growing clear to her that Bertha was pursuing an object , following a line she had marked out for herself . Only , with such a doom impending , why waste time in these childish efforts to avert it ? The puerility of the attempt disarmed Lily ’s indignation : did it not prove how horribly the poor creature was frightened ? “
95690	95694	95682	95682	our	2198	” she returned . “
95733	95734	95717	95717	My	0	” “
95757	95765	95750	95750	you	133	” Mrs. Dorset smiled on her reproachfully . “
95821	95822	95810	95810	I	0	” “
95830	95834	95810	95810	I	0	” Lily repeated . “
95898	95972	95973	95973	You	109	” A chill of fear passed over Miss Bart : a sense of remembered treachery that was like the gleam of a knife in the dusk . But compassion , in a moment , got the better of her instinctive recoil . What was this outpouring of senseless bitterness but the tracked creature ’s attempt to cloud the medium through which it was fleeing ? It was on Lily ’s lips to exclaim : “
95997	96609	95973	95973	You	109	” But the words died under the impenetrable insolence of Bertha ’s smile . Lily sat silent , taking the brunt of it quietly , letting it spend itself on her to the last drop of its accumulated falseness ; then , without a word , she rose and went down to her cabin . Chapter 3 Miss Bart ’s telegram caught Lawrence Selden at the door of his hotel ; and having read it , he turned back to wait for Dorset . The message necessarily left large gaps for conjecture ; but all that he had recently heard and seen made these but too easy to fill in . On the whole he was surprised ; for though he had perceived that the situation contained all the elements of an explosion , he had often enough , in the range of his personal experience , seen just such combinations subside into harmlessness . Still , Dorset ’s spasmodic temper , and his wife ’s reckless disregard of appearances , gave the situation a peculiar insecurity ; and it was less from the sense of any special relation to the case than from a purely professional zeal , that Selden resolved to guide the pair to safety . Whether , in the present instance , safety for either lay in repairing so damaged a tie , it was no business of his to consider : he had only , on general principles , to think of averting a scandal , and his desire to avert it was increased by his fear of its involving Miss Bart . There was nothing specific in this apprehension ; he merely wished to spare her the embarrassment of being ever so remotely connected with the public washing of the Dorset linen . How exhaustive and unpleasant such a process would be , he saw even more vividly after his two hours ’ talk with poor Dorset . If anything came out at all , it would be such a vast unpacking of accumulated moral rags as left him , after his visitor had gone , with the feeling that he must fling open the windows and have his room swept out . But nothing should come out ; and happily for his side of the case , the dirty rags , however pieced together , could not , without considerable difficulty , be turned into a homogeneous grievance . The torn edges did not always fit — there were missing bits , there were disparities of size and colour , all of which it was naturally Selden ’s business to make the most of in putting them under his client ’s eye . But to a man in Dorset ’s mood the completest demonstration could not carry conviction , and Selden saw that for the moment all he could do was to soothe and temporize , to offer sympathy and to counsel prudence . He let Dorset depart charged to the brim with the sense that , till their next meeting , he must maintain a strictly noncommittal attitude ; that , in short , his share in the game consisted for the present in looking on . Selden knew , however , that he could not long keep such violences in equilibrium ; and he promised to meet Dorset , the next morning , at an hotel in Monte Carlo . Meanwhile he counted not a little on the reaction of weakness and self - distrust that , in such natures , follows on every unwonted expenditure of moral force ; and his telegraphic reply to Miss Bart consisted simply in the injunction : “
96617	96692	95973	95973	You	109	” On this assumption , in fact , the early part of the following day was lived through . Dorset , as if in obedience to Lily ’s imperative bidding , had actually returned in time for a late dinner on the yacht . The repast had been the most difficult moment of the day . Dorset was sunk in one of the abysmal silences which so commonly followed on what his wife called his “
96694	96809	96828	96828	she	2208	” that it was easy , before the servants , to refer it to this cause ; but Bertha herself seemed , perversely enough , little disposed to make use of this obvious means of protection . She simply left the brunt of the situation on her husband ’s hands , as if too absorbed in a grievance of her own to suspect that she might be the object of one herself . To Lily this attitude was the most ominous , because the most perplexing , element in the situation . As she tried to fan the weak flicker of talk , to build up , again and again , the crumbling structure of “
96812	96823	96828	96828	she	2208	” her own attention was perpetually distracted by the question : “
96833	97180	96828	96828	she	2208	” There was something positively exasperating in Bertha ’s attitude of isolated defiance . If only she would have given her friend a hint they might still have worked together successfully ; but how could Lily be of use , while she was thus obstinately shut out from participation ? To be of use was what she honestly wanted ; and not for her own sake but for the Dorsets ’ . She had not thought of her own situation at all : she was simply engrossed in trying to put a little order in theirs . But the close of the short dreary evening left her with a sense of effort hopelessly wasted . She had not tried to see Dorset alone : she had positively shrunk from a renewal of his confidences . It was Bertha whose confidence she sought , and who should as eagerly have invited her own ; and Bertha , as if in the infatuation of self - destruction , was actually pushing away her rescuing hand . Lily , going to bed early , had left the couple to themselves ; and it seemed part of the general mystery in which she moved that more than an hour should elapse before she heard Bertha walk down the silent passage and regain her room . The morrow , rising on an apparent continuance of the same conditions , revealed nothing of what had occurred between the confronted pair . One fact alone outwardly proclaimed the change they were all conspiring to ignore ; and that was the non - appearance of Ned Silverton . No one referred to it , and this tacit avoidance of the subject kept it in the immediate foreground of consciousness . But there was another change , perceptible only to Lily ; and that was that Dorset now avoided her almost as pointedly as his wife . Perhaps he was repenting his rash outpourings of the previous day ; perhaps only trying , in his clumsy way , to conform to Selden ’s counsel to behave “
97184	97200	96828	96828	she	2208	” Such instructions no more make for easiness of attitude than the photographer ’s behest to “
97203	97378	97382	97382	him	2209	” ; and in a creature as unconscious as poor Dorset of the appearance he habitually presented , the struggle to maintain a pose was sure to result in queer contortions . It resulted , at any rate , in throwing Lily strangely on her own resources . She had learned , on leaving her room , that Mrs. Dorset was still invisible , and that Dorset had left the yacht early ; and feeling too restless to remain alone , she too had herself ferried ashore . Straying toward the Casino , she attached herself to a group of acquaintances from Nice , with whom she lunched , and in whose company she was returning to the rooms when she encountered Selden crossing the square . She could not , at the moment , separate herself definitely from her party , who had hospitably assumed that she would remain with them till they took their departure ; but she found time for a momentary pause of enquiry , to which he promptly returned : “
97391	97398	97385	97385	he	2209	” She waited before him anxiously . “
97409	97410	97436	97436	You	0	” “
97424	97425	97421	97421	I	0	” “
97440	97444	97436	97436	You	0	” He smiled . “
97462	98125	97436	97436	You	0	” And with that she had to content herself , and hasten on to the expectant group on the steps . Selden had in fact given her the utmost measure of his sureness , had even stretched it a shade to meet the anxiety in her eyes . And now , as he turned away , strolling down the hill toward the station , that anxiety remained with him as the visible justification of his own . It was not , indeed , anything specific that he feared : there had been a literal truth in his declaration that he did not think anything would happen . What troubled him was that , though Dorset ’s attitude had perceptibly changed , the change was not clearly to be accounted for . It had certainly not been produced by Selden ’s arguments , or by the action of his own soberer reason . Five minutes ’ talk sufficed to show that some alien influence had been at work , and that it had not so much subdued his resentment as weakened his will , so that he moved under it in a state of apathy , like a dangerous lunatic who has been drugged . Temporarily , no doubt , however exerted , it worked for the general safety : the question was how long it would last , and by what kind of reaction it was likely to be followed . On these points Selden could gain no light ; for he saw that one effect of the transformation had been to shut him off from free communion with Dorset . The latter , indeed , was still moved by the irresistible desire to discuss his wrong ; but , though he revolved about it with the same forlorn tenacity , Selden was aware that something always restrained him from full expression . His state was one to produce first weariness and then impatience in his hearer ; and when their talk was over , Selden began to feel that he had done his utmost , and might justifiably wash his hands of the sequel . It was in this mind that he had been making his way back to the station when Miss Bart crossed his path ; but though , after his brief word with her , he kept mechanically on his course , he was conscious of a gradual change in his purpose . The change had been produced by the look in her eyes ; and in his eagerness to define the nature of that look , he dropped into a seat in the gardens , and sat brooding upon the question . It was natural enough , in all conscience , that she should appear anxious : a young woman placed , in the close intimacy of a yachting - cruise , between a couple on the verge of disaster , could hardly , aside from her concern for her friends , be insensible to the awkwardness of her own position . The worst of it was that , in interpreting Miss Bart ’s state of mind , so many alternative readings were possible ; and one of these , in Selden ’s troubled mind , took the ugly form suggested by Mrs. Fisher . If the girl was afraid , was she afraid for herself or for her friends ? And to what degree was her dread of a catastrophe intensified by the sense of being fatally involved in it ? The burden of offence lying manifestly with Mrs. Dorset , this conjecture seemed on the face of it gratuitously unkind ; but Selden knew that in the most one - sided matrimonial quarrel there are generally counter - charges to be brought , and that they are brought with the greater audacity where the original grievance is so emphatic . Mrs. Fisher had not hesitated to suggest the likelihood of Dorset ’s marrying Miss Bart if “
98128	98663	97436	97436	You	0	” ; and though Mrs. Fisher ’s conclusions were notoriously rash , she was shrewd enough in reading the signs from which they were drawn . Dorset had apparently shown marked interest in the girl , and this interest might be used to cruel advantage in his wife ’s struggle for rehabilitation . Selden knew that Bertha would fight to the last round of powder : the rashness of her conduct was illogically combined with a cold determination to escape its consequences . She could be as unscrupulous in fighting for herself as she was reckless in courting danger , and whatever came to her hand at such moments was likely to be used as a defensive missile . He did not , as yet , see clearly just what course she was likely to take , but his perplexity increased his apprehension , and with it the sense that , before leaving , he must speak again with Miss Bart . Whatever her share in the situation — and he had always honestly tried to resist judging her by her surroundings — however free she might be from any personal connection with it , she would be better out of the way of a possible crash ; and since she had appealed to him for help , it was clearly his business to tell her so . This decision at last brought him to his feet , and carried him back to the gambling rooms , within whose doors he had seen her disappearing ; but a prolonged exploration of the crowd failed to put him on her traces . He saw instead , to his surprise , Ned Silverton loitering somewhat ostentatiously about the tables ; and the discovery that this actor in the drama was not only hovering in the wings , but actually inviting the exposure of the footlights , though it might have seemed to imply that all peril was over , served rather to deepen Selden ’s sense of foreboding . Charged with this impression he returned to the square , hoping to see Miss Bart move across it , as every one in Monte Carlo seemed inevitably to do at least a dozen times a day ; but here again he waited vainly for a glimpse of her , and the conclusion was slowly forced on him that she had gone back to the Sabrina . It would be difficult to follow her there , and still more difficult , should he do so , to contrive the opportunity for a private word ; and he had almost decided on the unsatisfactory alternative of writing , when the ceaseless diorama of the square suddenly unrolled before him the figures of Lord Hubert and Mrs. Bry . Hailing them at once with his question , he learned from Lord Hubert that Miss Bart had just returned to the Sabrina in Dorset ’s company ; an announcement so evidently disconcerting to him that Mrs. Bry , after a glance from her companion , which seemed to act like the pressure on a spring , brought forth the prompt proposal that he should come and meet his friends at dinner that evening—“At
98673	98825	97436	97436	You	0	” she flashed out before Lord Hubert had time to remove the pressure . Selden ’s sense of the privilege of being included in such company brought him early in the evening to the door of the restaurant , where he paused to scan the ranks of diners approaching down the brightly lit terrace . There , while the Brys hovered within over the last agitating alternatives of the MENU , he kept watch for the guests from the Sabrina , who at length rose on the horizon in company with the Duchess , Lord and Lady Skiddaw and the Stepneys . From this group it was easy for him to detach Miss Bart on the pretext of a moment ’s glance into one of the brilliant shops along the terrace , and to say to her , while they lingered together in the white dazzle of a jeweller ’s window : “
98842	98858	98826	98826	I	0	” The eyes she turned on him showed a quick gleam of her former fear . “
98872	98873	98865	98865	you	0	” “
98889	98917	98865	98865	you	0	” The glare from the jeweller ’s window , deepening the pallor of her face , gave to its delicate lines the sharpness of a tragic mask . “
98943	98985	98986	98986	You	0	” The words rang out on a note of contempt — was it possibly of contempt for himself ? Well , he was willing to risk its renewal to the extent of insisting , with an undeniable throb of added interest : “
98996	99017	98988	98988	yourself	0	” to which , with a strange fall of sadness in her voice , she answered , meeting his eyes : “
99027	99028	98988	98988	yourself	0	” “
99037	99051	98988	98988	yourself	0	” he said , more for his own reassurance than for hers ; and “
99059	99600	98988	98988	yourself	0	” she valiantly assented , as they turned to overtake their companions . In the thronged restaurant , taking their places about Mrs. Bry ’s illuminated board , their confidence seemed to gain support from the familiarity of their surroundings . Here were Dorset and his wife once more presenting their customary faces to the world , she engrossed in establishing her relation with an intensely new gown , he shrinking with dyspeptic dread from the multiplied solicitations of the MENU . The mere fact that they thus showed themselves together , with the utmost openness the place afforded , seemed to declare beyond a doubt that their differences were composed . How this end had been attained was still matter for wonder , but it was clear that for the moment Miss Bart rested confidently in the result ; and Selden tried to achieve the same view by telling himself that her opportunities for observation had been ampler than his own . Meanwhile , as the dinner advanced through a labyrinth of courses , in which it became clear that Mrs. Bry had occasionally broken away from Lord Hubert ’s restraining hand , Selden ’s general watchfulness began to lose itself in a particular study of Miss Bart . It was one of the days when she was so handsome that to be handsome was enough , and all the rest — her grace , her quickness , her social felicities — seemed the overflow of a bounteous nature . But what especially struck him was the way in which she detached herself , by a hundred undefinable shades , from the persons who most abounded in her own style . It was in just such company , the fine flower and complete expression of the state she aspired to , that the differences came out with special poignancy , her grace cheapening the other women ’s smartness as her finely - discriminated silences made their chatter dull . The strain of the last hours had restored to her face the deeper eloquence which Selden had lately missed in it , and the bravery of her words to him still fluttered in her voice and eyes . Yes , she was matchless — it was the one word for her ; and he could give his admiration the freer play because so little personal feeling remained in it . His real detachment from her had taken place , not at the lurid moment of disenchantment , but now , in the sober after - light of discrimination , where he saw her definitely divided from him by the crudeness of a choice which seemed to deny the very differences he felt in her . It was before him again in its completeness — the choice in which she was content to rest : in the stupid costliness of the food and the showy dulness of the talk , in the freedom of speech which never arrived at wit and the freedom of act which never made for romance . The strident setting of the restaurant , in which their table seemed set apart in a special glare of publicity , and the presence at it of little Dabham of the “
99604	99769	98988	98988	yourself	0	” emphasized the ideals of a world where conspicuousness passed for distinction , and the society column had become the roll of fame . It was as the immortalizer of such occasions that little Dabham , wedged in modest watchfulness between two brilliant neighbours , suddenly became the centre of Selden ’s scrutiny . How much did he know of what was going on , and how much , for his purpose , was still worth finding out ? His little eyes were like tentacles thrown out to catch the floating intimations with which , to Selden , the air at moments seemed thick ; then again it cleared to its normal emptiness , and he could see nothing in it for the journalist but leisure to note the elegance of the ladies ’ gowns . Mrs. Dorset ’s , in particular , challenged all the wealth of Mr. Dabham ’s vocabulary : it had surprises and subtleties worthy of what he would have called “
99774	100397	98988	98988	yourself	0	” At first , as Selden had noticed , it had been almost too preoccupying to its wearer ; but now she was in full command of it , and was even producing her effects with unwonted freedom . Was she not , indeed , too free , too fluent , for perfect naturalness ? And was not Dorset , to whom his glance had passed by a natural transition , too jerkily wavering between the same extremes ? Dorset indeed was always jerky ; but it seemed to Selden that tonight each vibration swung him farther from his centre . The dinner , meanwhile , was moving to its triumphant close , to the evident satisfaction of Mrs. Bry , who , throned in apoplectic majesty between Lord Skiddaw and Lord Hubert , seemed in spirit to be calling on Mrs. Fisher to witness her achievement . Short of Mrs. Fisher her audience might have been called complete ; for the restaurant was crowded with persons mainly gathered there for the purpose of spectatorship , and accurately posted as to the names and faces of the celebrities they had come to see . Mrs. Bry , conscious that all her feminine guests came under that heading , and that each one looked her part to admiration , shone on Lily with all the pent - up gratitude that Mrs. Fisher had failed to deserve . Selden , catching the glance , wondered what part Miss Bart had played in organizing the entertainment . She did , at least , a great deal to adorn it ; and as he watched the bright security with which she bore herself , he smiled to think that he should have fancied her in need of help . Never had she appeared more serenely mistress of the situation than when , at the moment of dispersal , detaching herself a little from the group about the table , she turned with a smile and a graceful slant of the shoulders to receive her cloak from Dorset . The dinner had been protracted over Mr. Bry ’s exceptional cigars and a bewildering array of liqueurs , and many of the other tables were empty ; but a sufficient number of diners still lingered to give relief to the leave - taking of Mrs. Bry ’s distinguished guests . This ceremony was drawn out and complicated by the fact that it involved , on the part of the Duchess and Lady Skiddaw , definite farewells , and pledges of speedy reunion in Paris , where they were to pause and replenish their wardrobes on the way to England . The quality of Mrs. Bry ’s hospitality , and of the tips her husband had presumably imparted , lent to the manner of the English ladies a general effusiveness which shed the rosiest light over their hostess ’s future . In its glow Mrs. Dorset and the Stepneys were also visibly included , and the whole scene had touches of intimacy worth their weight in gold to the watchful pen of Mr. Dabham . A glance at her watch caused the Duchess to exclaim to her sister that they had just time to dash for their train , and the flurry of this departure over , the Stepneys , who had their motor at the door , offered to convey the Dorsets and Miss Bart to the quay . The offer was accepted , and Mrs. Dorset moved away with her husband in attendance . Miss Bart had lingered for a last word with Lord Hubert , and Stepney , on whom Mr. Bry was pressing a final , and still more expensive , cigar , called out : “
100412	100444	100401	100401	Lily	109	” Lily turned to obey ; but as she did so , Mrs. Dorset , who had paused on her way out , moved a few steps back toward the table . “
100455	100550	100401	100401	Lily	109	” she said in a voice of singular distinctness . A startled look ran from eye to eye ; Mrs. Bry crimsoned to the verge of congestion , Mrs. Stepney slipped nervously behind her husband , and Selden , in the general turmoil of his sensations , was mainly conscious of a longing to grip Dabham by the collar and fling him out into the street . Dorset , meanwhile , had stepped back to his wife ’s side . His face was white , and he looked about him with cowed angry eyes . “
100566	100567	100401	100401	Lily	109	” “
100573	100579	100568	100569	Miss Bart	109	” his wife rejoined incisively . “
100597	100694	100585	100585	George	131	” Miss Bart , during this brief exchange of words , remained in admirable erectness , slightly isolated from the embarrassed group about her . She had paled a little under the shock of the insult , but the discomposure of the surrounding faces was not reflected in her own . The faint disdain of her smile seemed to lift her high above her antagonist ’s reach , and it was not till she had given Mrs. Dorset the full measure of the distance between them that she turned and extended her hand to her hostess . “
100702	100706	100695	100695	I	0	” she explained , “
100721	100813	100814	100815	Mr. Selden	108	” She held firmly to Mrs. Bry ’s wavering eye while she gave this explanation , but when it was over Selden saw her send a tentative glance from one to another of the women ’s faces . She read their incredulity in their averted looks , and in the mute wretchedness of the men behind them , and for a miserable half - second he thought she quivered on the brink of failure . Then , turning to him with an easy gesture , and the pale bravery of her recovered smile—“Dear
100817	100821	100822	100822	you	108	” she said , “
100831	100911	100822	100822	you	108	” * * * * * Outside , the sky was gusty and overcast , and as Lily and Selden moved toward the deserted gardens below the restaurant , spurts of warm rain blew fitfully against their faces . The fiction of the cab had been tacitly abandoned ; they walked on in silence , her hand on his arm , till the deeper shade of the gardens received them , and pausing beside a bench , he said : “
100917	101164	100822	100822	you	108	” She dropped to the seat without answering , but the electric lamp at the bend of the path shed a gleam on the struggling misery of her face . Selden sat down beside her , waiting for her to speak , fearful lest any word he chose should touch too roughly on her wound , and kept also from free utterance by the wretched doubt which had slowly renewed itself within him . What had brought her to this pass ? What weakness had placed her so abominably at her enemy ’s mercy ? And why should Bertha Dorset have turned into an enemy at the very moment when she so obviously needed the support of her sex ? Even while his nerves raged at the subjection of husbands to their wives , and at the cruelty of women to their kind , reason obstinately harped on the proverbial relation between smoke and fire . The memory of Mrs. Fisher ’s hints , and the corroboration of his own impressions , while they deepened his pity also increased his constraint , since , whichever way he sought a free outlet for sympathy , it was blocked by the fear of committing a blunder . Suddenly it struck him that his silence must seem almost as accusatory as that of the men he had despised for turning from her ; but before he could find the fitting word she had cut him short with a question . “
101183	101184	101173	101173	I	0	” “
101202	101215	101173	101173	I	0	” She met this with a pale gleam of her old playfulness . “
101231	101232	101237	101238	some one	2889	” “
101241	101242	101237	101238	some one	2889	” “
101273	101274	101262	101262	You	2220	” “
101285	101311	101279	101279	you	2227	” he cried , venting his helplessness in a burst of anger . She still held him off with the gentle mockery of her smile . “
101317	101321	101322	101322	You	2220	” she rejoined . “
101336	101406	101407	101407	Lily	109	” He saw then , with a pang of self - reproach , that she meant neither to explain nor to defend herself ; that by his miserable silence he had forfeited all chance of helping her , and that the decisive hour was past . She had risen , and stood before him in a kind of clouded majesty , like some deposed princess moving tranquilly to exile . “
101409	101420	101407	101407	Lily	109	” he exclaimed , with a note of despairing appeal ; but—“Oh
101425	101443	101407	101407	Lily	109	” she gently admonished him ; and then , in all the sweetness of her recovered composure : “
101463	101472	101453	101453	you	2220	” He gathered himself up at the challenge . “
101500	101501	101497	101498	the Stepneys	204	” “
101504	101519	101497	101498	the Stepneys	204	” broke from her with a movement of instinctive resistance ; but he insisted : “
101536	101558	101559	101559	I	0	” He had drawn her hand into his arm , but she held him back with a last gesture of protest . “
101580	101581	101574	101574	you	109	” “
101592	101612	101582	101582	I	0	” he persisted , though infected at heart by her own fear . Her voice sank to a whisper : “
101616	101618	101615	101615	she	109	refuses?”—but , “
101627	101750	101625	101625	me	0	” he could only insist in return ; and yielding to his touch , she let him lead her back in silence to the edge of the square . In the cab they continued to remain silent through the brief drive which carried them to the illuminated portals of the Stepneys ’ hotel . Here he left her outside , in the darkness of the raised hood , while his name was sent up to Stepney , and he paced the showy hall , awaiting the latter ’s descent . Ten minutes later the two men passed out together between the gold - laced custodians of the threshold ; but in the vestibule Stepney drew up with a last flare of reluctance . “
101757	101770	101771	101771	She	2231	” he stipulated nervously , with his hand on Selden ’s arm . “
101791	101891	101615	101615	she	109	” Chapter 4 The blinds of Mrs. Peniston ’s drawing - room were drawn down against the oppressive June sun , and in the sultry twilight the faces of her assembled relatives took on a fitting shadow of bereavement . They were all there : Van Alstynes , Stepneys and Melsons — even a stray Peniston or two , indicating , by a greater latitude in dress and manner , the fact of remoter relationship and more settled hopes . The Peniston side was , in fact , secure in the knowledge that the bulk of Mr. Peniston ’s property “
101894	102024	102025	102025	I	0	” ; while the direct connection hung suspended on the disposal of his widow ’s private fortune and on the uncertainty of its extent . Jack Stepney , in his new character as the richest nephew , tacitly took the lead , emphasizing his importance by the deeper gloss of his mourning and the subdued authority of his manner ; while his wife ’s bored attitude and frivolous gown proclaimed the heiress ’s disregard of the insignificant interests at stake . Old Ned Van Alstyne , seated next to her in a coat that made affliction dapper , twirled his white moustache to conceal the eager twitch of his lips ; and Grace Stepney , red - nosed and smelling of crape , whispered emotionally to Mrs. Herbert Melson : “
102036	102406	102025	102025	I	0	” A rustle of weeds and quick turning of heads hailed the opening of the door , and Lily Bart appeared , tall and noble in her black dress , with Gerty Farish at her side . The women ’s faces , as she paused interrogatively on the threshold , were a study in hesitation . One or two made faint motions of recognition , which might have been subdued either by the solemnity of the scene , or by the doubt as to how far the others meant to go ; Mrs. Jack Stepney gave a careless nod , and Grace Stepney , with a sepulchral gesture , indicated a seat at her side . But Lily , ignoring the invitation , as well as Jack Stepney ’s official attempt to direct her , moved across the room with her smooth free gait , and seated herself in a chair which seemed to have been purposely placed apart from the others . It was the first time that she had faced her family since her return from Europe , two weeks earlier ; but if she perceived any uncertainty in their welcome , it served only to add a tinge of irony to the usual composure of her bearing . The shock of dismay with which , on the dock , she had heard from Gerty Farish of Mrs. Peniston ’s sudden death , had been mitigated , almost at once , by the irrepressible thought that now , at last , she would be able to pay her debts . She had looked forward with considerable uneasiness to her first encounter with her aunt . Mrs. Peniston had vehemently opposed her niece ’s departure with the Dorsets , and had marked her continued disapproval by not writing during Lily ’s absence . The certainty that she had heard of the rupture with the Dorsets made the prospect of the meeting more formidable ; and how should Lily have repressed a quick sense of relief at the thought that , instead of undergoing the anticipated ordeal , she had only to enter gracefully on a long - assured inheritance ? It had been , in the consecrated phrase , “
102409	102436	102437	102437	She	2235	” that Mrs. Peniston was to provide handsomely for her niece ; and in the latter ’s mind the understanding had long since crystallized into fact . “
102454	102472	102475	102477	a just woman”—might	3933	” Mrs. Jack Stepney remarked with careless loudness to Ned Van Alstyne ; and the latter ’s deprecating murmur—“Julia
102477	102488	102475	102477	a just woman”—might	3933	woman”—might have been interpreted as signifying either acquiescence or doubt . “
102499	102528	102529	102529	They	2238	” Mrs. Stepney rejoined with a yawn ; and Grace Stepney , in the silence produced by the lawyer ’s preliminary cough , was heard to sob out : “
102548	102598	102537	102537	I	0	” Lily , oppressed by the close atmosphere , and the stifling odour of fresh mourning , felt her attention straying as Mrs. Peniston ’s lawyer , solemnly erect behind the Buhl table at the end of the room , began to rattle through the preamble of the will . “
102606	102663	102664	102664	I	0	” she reflected , wondering vaguely where Gwen Stepney had got such an awful hat . Then she noticed how stout Jack had grown — he would soon be almost as plethoric as Herbert Melson , who sat a few feet off , breathing puffily as he leaned his black - gloved hands on his stick . “
102699	102795	102796	102797	my niece	3298	” she mused , while the lawyer droned on through a labyrinth of legacies . The servants came first , then a few charitable institutions , then several remoter Melsons and Stepneys , who stirred consciously as their names rang out , and then subsided into a state of impassiveness befitting the solemnity of the occasion . Ned Van Alstyne , Jack Stepney , and a cousin or two followed , each coupled with the mention of a few thousands : Lily wondered that Grace Stepney was not among them . Then she heard her own name—“to
102804	102831	102798	102798	Lily	109	” and after that the lawyer again lost himself in a coil of unintelligible periods , from which the concluding phrase flashed out with startling distinctness : “
102851	103034	102847	102849	Grace Julia Stepney	187	” There was a subdued gasp of surprise , a rapid turning of heads , and a surging of sable figures toward the corner in which Miss Stepney wailed out her sense of unworthiness through the crumpled ball of a black - edged handkerchief . Lily stood apart from the general movement , feeling herself for the first time utterly alone . No one looked at her , no one seemed aware of her presence ; she was probing the very depths of insignificance . And under her sense of the collective indifference came the acuter pang of hopes deceived . Disinherited — she had been disinherited — and for Grace Stepney ! She met Gerty ’s lamentable eyes , fixed on her in a despairing effort at consolation , and the look brought her to herself . There was something to be done before she left the house : to be done with all the nobility she knew how to put into such gestures . She advanced to the group about Miss Stepney , and holding out her hand said simply : “
103043	103128	103035	103036	Dear Grace	265	” The other ladies had fallen back at her approach , and a space created itself about her . It widened as she turned to go , and no one advanced to fill it up . She paused a moment , glancing about her , calmly taking the measure of her situation . She heard some one ask a question about the date of the will ; she caught a fragment of the lawyer ’s answer — something about a sudden summons , and an “
103132	103323	103324	103324	I	0	” Then the tide of dispersal began to drift past her ; Mrs. Jack Stepney and Mrs. Herbert Melson stood on the doorstep awaiting their motor ; a sympathizing group escorted Grace Stepney to the cab it was felt to be fitting she should take , though she lived but a street or two away ; and Miss Bart and Gerty found themselves almost alone in the purple drawing - room , which more than ever , in its stuffy dimness , resembled a well - kept family vault , in which the last corpse had just been decently deposited . * * * * * In Gerty Farish ’s sitting - room , whither a hansom had carried the two friends , Lily dropped into a chair with a faint sound of laughter : it struck her as a humorous coincidence that her aunt ’s legacy should so nearly represent the amount of her debt to Trenor . The need of discharging that debt had reasserted itself with increased urgency since her return to America , and she spoke her first thought in saying to the anxiously hovering Gerty : “
103333	103351	103324	103324	I	0	” But Miss Farish could not pause over the legacies ; she broke into a larger indignation . “
103377	103378	103368	103368	she	187	” “
103395	103401	103403	103403	she	238	” Miss Bart rejoined philosophically . “
103416	103435	103409	103409	she	238	” Gerty checked herself in evident embarrassment , and Miss Bart turned to her with a direct look . “
103460	103461	103450	103450	She	238	” “
103480	103481	103483	103483	she	238	” “
103493	103494	103495	103495	Lily	109	” “
103497	103498	103495	103495	Lily	109	” “
103537	103538	103532	103532	she	238	” “
103552	103553	103544	103544	I	0	” “
103567	103580	103560	103560	I	0	” She paused , and again sounded a faint note of derision . “
103615	103624	103605	103605	they	2741	” Gerty remained silent , and she continued : “
103667	103668	103669	103669	I	0	” “
103678	103679	103672	103672	I	0	” “
103687	103701	103680	103680	One	2737	” She rose and laid her resolute hands on Miss Farish ’s shoulders . “
103711	103712	103705	103705	people	2804	” “
103724	103725	103720	103720	you	112	” “
103755	103764	103750	103750	YOU	112	” She kissed Gerty with a whimsical murmur . “
103801	103833	103834	103834	Lily	109	” She drew herself up to the full height of her slender majesty , towering like some dark angel of defiance above the troubled Gerty , who could only falter out : “
103846	103847	103840	103840	you	109	” “
103887	103916	103917	103917	I	0	” She took a restless turn about the room , and then , reseating herself , lifted the bright mockery of her eyes to Gerty ’s anxious countenance . “
103933	103940	103927	103927	I	0	” and at Miss Farish ’s protesting “
103943	103948	103927	103927	I	0	” she repeated calmly : “
103997	104015	104018	104018	you	112	” The irony faded from her eyes , and she bent a clouded face upon her friend . “
104047	104056	104018	104018	you	112	” Gerty paused , and then continued firmly : “
104075	104076	104018	104018	you	112	” “
104081	104086	104018	104018	you	112	” Miss Bart laughed . “
104148	104159	104126	104126	she	133	” Miss Farish still fixed her with an anxious gaze . “
104178	104179	104168	104168	I	0	” “
104224	104233	104210	104210	I	0	” But Gerty continued with her quiet reasonableness : “
104258	104259	104247	104247	you	2265	” “
104264	104271	104247	104247	you	2265	” Miss Bart gently mimicked her . “
104368	104386	104387	104387	You	2265	” And as Miss Farish continued to press her with troubled eyes , she went on impatiently : “
104440	104955	104427	104427	Gerty	112	” * * * * * In her stuffy room at the hotel to which she had gone on landing , Lily Bart that evening reviewed her situation . It was the last week in June , and none of her friends were in town . The few relatives who had stayed on , or returned , for the reading of Mrs. Peniston ’s will , had taken flight again that afternoon to Newport or Long Island ; and not one of them had made any proffer of hospitality to Lily . For the first time in her life she found herself utterly alone except for Gerty Farish . Even at the actual moment of her break with the Dorsets she had not had so keen a sense of its consequences , for the Duchess of Beltshire , hearing of the catastrophe from Lord Hubert , had instantly offered her protection , and under her sheltering wing Lily had made an almost triumphant progress to London . There she had been sorely tempted to linger on in a society which asked of her only to amuse and charm it , without enquiring too curiously how she had acquired her gift for doing so ; but Selden , before they parted , had pressed on her the urgent need of returning at once to her aunt , and Lord Hubert , when he presently reappeared in London , abounded in the same counsel . Lily did not need to be told that the Duchess ’s championship was not the best road to social rehabilitation , and as she was besides aware that her noble defender might at any moment drop her in favour of a new PROTEGEE , she reluctantly decided to return to America . But she had not been ten minutes on her native shore before she realized that she had delayed too long to regain it . The Dorsets , the Stepneys , the Brys — all the actors and witnesses in the miserable drama — had preceded her with their version of the case ; and , even had she seen the least chance of gaining a hearing for her own , some obscure disdain and reluctance would have restrained her . She knew it was not by explanations and counter - charges that she could ever hope to recover her lost standing ; but even had she felt the least trust in their efficacy , she would still have been held back by the feeling which had kept her from defending herself to Gerty Farish — a feeling that was half pride and half humiliation . For though she knew she had been ruthlessly sacrificed to Bertha Dorset ’s determination to win back her husband , and though her own relation to Dorset had been that of the merest good - fellowship , yet she had been perfectly aware from the outset that her part in the affair was , as Carry Fisher brutally put it , to distract Dorset ’s attention from his wife . That was what she was “
104958	105338	105343	105343	you	112	” : it was the price she had chosen to pay for three months of luxury and freedom from care . Her habit of resolutely facing the facts , in her rare moments of introspection , did not now allow her to put any false gloss on the situation . She had suffered for the very faithfulness with which she had carried out her part of the tacit compact , but the part was not a handsome one at best , and she saw it now in all the ugliness of failure . She saw , too , in the same uncompromising light , the train of consequences resulting from that failure ; and these became clearer to her with every day of her weary lingering in town . She stayed on partly for the comfort of Gerty Farish ’s nearness , and partly for lack of knowing where to go . She understood well enough the nature of the task before her . She must set out to regain , little by little , the position she had lost ; and the first step in the tedious task was to find out , as soon as possible , on how many of her friends she could count . Her hopes were mainly centred on Mrs. Trenor , who had treasures of easy - going tolerance for those who were amusing or useful to her , and in the noisy rush of whose existence the still small voice of detraction was slow to make itself heard . But Judy , though she must have been apprised of Miss Bart ’s return , had not even recognized it by the formal note of condolence which her friend ’s bereavement demanded . Any advance on Lily ’s side might have been perilous : there was nothing to do but to trust to the happy chance of an accidental meeting , and Lily knew that , even so late in the season , there was always a hope of running across her friends in their frequent passages through town . To this end she assiduously showed herself at the restaurants they frequented , where , attended by the troubled Gerty , she lunched luxuriously , as she said , on her expectations . “
105404	106208	105374	105374	she	187	” She dropped the MENU abruptly , with a quick heightening of colour , and Gerty , following her glance , was aware of the advance , from an inner room , of a party headed by Mrs. Trenor and Carry Fisher . It was impossible for these ladies and their companions — among whom Lily had at once distinguished both Trenor and Rosedale — not to pass , in going out , the table at which the two girls were seated ; and Gerty ’s sense of the fact betrayed itself in the helpless trepidation of her manner . Miss Bart , on the contrary , borne forward on the wave of her buoyant grace , and neither shrinking from her friends nor appearing to lie in wait for them , gave to the encounter the touch of naturalness which she could impart to the most strained situations . Such embarrassment as was shown was on Mrs. Trenor ’s side , and manifested itself in the mingling of exaggerated warmth with imperceptible reservations . Her loudly affirmed pleasure at seeing Miss Bart took the form of a nebulous generalization , which included neither enquiries as to her future nor the expression of a definite wish to see her again . Lily , well - versed in the language of these omissions , knew that they were equally intelligible to the other members of the party : even Rosedale , flushed as he was with the importance of keeping such company , at once took the temperature of Mrs. Trenor ’s cordiality , and reflected it in his off - hand greeting of Miss Bart . Trenor , red and uncomfortable , had cut short his salutations on the pretext of a word to say to the head - waiter ; and the rest of the group soon melted away in Mrs. Trenor ’s wake . It was over in a moment — the waiter , MENU in hand , still hung on the result of the choice between COUPE JACQUES and PECHES A LA MELBA — but Miss Bart , in the interval , had taken the measure of her fate . Where Judy Trenor led , all the world would follow ; and Lily had the doomed sense of the castaway who has signalled in vain to fleeing sails . In a flash she remembered Mrs. Trenor ’s complaints of Carry Fisher ’s rapacity , and saw that they denoted an unexpected acquaintance with her husband ’s private affairs . In the large tumultuous disorder of the life at Bellomont , where no one seemed to have time to observe any one else , and private aims and personal interests were swept along unheeded in the rush of collective activities , Lily had fancied herself sheltered from inconvenient scrutiny ; but if Judy knew when Mrs. Fisher borrowed money of her husband , was she likely to ignore the same transaction on Lily ’s part ? If she was careless of his affections she was plainly jealous of his pocket ; and in that fact Lily read the explanation of her rebuff . The immediate result of these conclusions was the passionate resolve to pay back her debt to Trenor . That obligation discharged , she would have but a thousand dollars of Mrs. Peniston ’s legacy left , and nothing to live on but her own small income , which was considerably less than Gerty Farish ’s wretched pittance ; but this consideration gave way to the imperative claim of her wounded pride . She must be quits with the Trenors first ; after that she would take thought for the future . In her ignorance of legal procrastinations she had supposed that her legacy would be paid over within a few days of the reading of her aunt ’s will ; and after an interval of anxious suspense , she wrote to enquire the cause of the delay . There was another interval before Mrs. Peniston ’s lawyer , who was also one of the executors , replied to the effect that , some questions having arisen relative to the interpretation of the will , he and his associates might not be in a position to pay the legacies till the close of the twelvemonth legally allotted for their settlement . Bewildered and indignant , Lily resolved to try the effect of a personal appeal ; but she returned from her expedition with a sense of the powerlessness of beauty and charm against the unfeeling processes of the law . It seemed intolerable to live on for another year under the weight of her debt ; and in her extremity she decided to turn to Miss Stepney , who still lingered in town , immersed in the delectable duty of “
106211	106493	105374	105374	she	187	” her benefactress ’s effects . It was bitter enough for Lily to ask a favour of Grace Stepney , but the alternative was bitterer still ; and one morning she presented herself at Mrs. Peniston ’s , where Grace , for the facilitation of her pious task , had taken up a provisional abode . The strangeness of entering as a suppliant the house where she had so long commanded , increased Lily ’s desire to shorten the ordeal ; and when Miss Stepney entered the darkened drawing - room , rustling with the best quality of crape , her visitor went straight to the point : would she be willing to advance the amount of the expected legacy ? Grace , in reply , wept and wondered at the request , bemoaned the inexorableness of the law , and was astonished that Lily had not realized the exact similarity of their positions . Did she think that only the payment of the legacies had been delayed ? Why , Miss Stepney herself had not received a penny of her inheritance , and was paying rent — yes , actually!—for the privilege of living in a house that belonged to her . She was sure it was not what poor dear cousin Julia would have wished — she had told the executors so to their faces ; but they were inaccessible to reason , and there was nothing to do but to wait . Let Lily take example by her , and be patient — let them both remember how beautifully patient cousin Julia had always been . Lily made a movement which showed her imperfect assimilation of this example . “
106519	106520	106525	106525	me	0	” “
106529	106540	106525	106525	me	0	” Grace Stepney rose up before her in sable wrath . “
106710	106841	106842	106842	My	0	” Chapter 5 It seemed to Lily , as Mrs. Peniston ’s door closed on her , that she was taking a final leave of her old life . The future stretched before her dull and bare as the deserted length of Fifth Avenue , and opportunities showed as meagrely as the few cabs trailing in quest of fares that did not come . The completeness of the analogy was , however , disturbed as she reached the sidewalk by the rapid approach of a hansom which pulled up at sight of her . From beneath its luggage - laden top , she caught the wave of a signalling hand ; and the next moment Mrs. Fisher , springing to the street , had folded her in a demonstrative embrace . “
106876	106889	106867	106867	I	0	” She broke off , and added with a burst of frankness : “
106910	106911	106900	106900	I	0	” “
106915	106937	106900	106900	I	0	” Miss Bart protested , drawing back from her penitent clasp ; but Mrs. Fisher went on with her usual directness : “
107040	107064	107065	107065	I	0	” In Lily ’s present mood there was no resisting the honest friendliness of this appeal , and she said with a smile : “
107100	107108	107083	107083	she	112	” Mrs. Fisher made a slight grimace . “
107226	107246	107204	107204	you	2871	” And as Lily stared at the breathless suddenness of the suggestion , she continued with her easy laugh : “
107317	107333	107297	107297	They	2288	” she broke off , checked by an undefinable change in Miss Bart ’s expression . “
107695	107707	107679	107679	Morpeth	208	” Mrs. Fisher drew Lily toward the hansom with friendly authority . “
107749	108052	107739	107741	the two maids	2306	” * * * * * It was a good deal better than a broiling Sunday in town — of that no doubt remained to Lily as , reclining in the shade of a leafy verandah , she looked seaward across a stretch of greensward picturesquely dotted with groups of ladies in lace raiment and men in tennis flannels . The huge Van Alstyne house and its rambling dependencies were packed to their fullest capacity with the Gormers ’ week - end guests , who now , in the radiance of the Sunday forenoon , were dispersing themselves over the grounds in quest of the various distractions the place afforded : distractions ranging from tennis - courts to shooting - galleries , from bridge and whiskey within doors to motors and steam - launches without . Lily had the odd sense of having been caught up into the crowd as carelessly as a passenger is gathered in by an express train . The blonde and genial Mrs. Gormer might , indeed , have figured the conductor , calmly assigning seats to the rush of travellers , while Carry Fisher represented the porter pushing their bags into place , giving them their numbers for the dining - car , and warning them when their station was at hand . The train , meanwhile , had scarcely slackened speed — life whizzed on with a deafening ’ rattle and roar , in which one traveller at least found a welcome refuge from the sound of her own thoughts . The Gormer MILIEU represented a social out - skirt which Lily had always fastidiously avoided ; but it struck her , now that she was in it , as only a flamboyant copy of her own world , a caricature approximating the real thing as the “
108055	108237	107739	107741	the two maids	2306	” approaches the manners of the drawing - room . The people about her were doing the same things as the Trenors , the Van Osburghs and the Dorsets : the difference lay in a hundred shades of aspect and manner , from the pattern of the men ’s waistcoats to the inflexion of the women ’s voices . Everything was pitched in a higher key , and there was more of each thing : more noise , more colour , more champagne , more familiarity — but also greater good - nature , less rivalry , and a fresher capacity for enjoyment . Miss Bart ’s arrival had been welcomed with an uncritical friendliness that first irritated her pride and then brought her to a sharp sense of her own situation — of the place in life which , for the moment , she must accept and make the best of . These people knew her story — of that her first long talk with Carry Fisher had left no doubt : she was publicly branded as the heroine of a “
108239	108353	107739	107741	the two maids	2306	” episode — but instead of shrinking from her as her own friends had done , they received her without question into the easy promiscuity of their lives . They swallowed her past as easily as they did Miss Anstell ’s , and with no apparent sense of any difference in the size of the mouthful : all they asked was that she should — in her own way , for they recognized a diversity of gifts — contribute as much to the general amusement as that graceful actress , whose talents , when off the stage , were of the most varied order . Lily felt at once that any tendency to be “
108358	108759	107739	107741	the two maids	2306	” to mark a sense of differences and distinctions , would be fatal to her continuance in the Gormer set . To be taken in on such terms — and into such a world!—was hard enough to the lingering pride in her ; but she realized , with a pang of self - contempt , that to be excluded from it would , after all , be harder still . For , almost at once , she had felt the insidious charm of slipping back into a life where every material difficulty was smoothed away . The sudden escape from a stifling hotel in a dusty deserted city to the space and luxury of a great country - house fanned by sea breezes , had produced a state of moral lassitude agreeable enough after the nervous tension and physical discomfort of the past weeks . For the moment she must yield to the refreshment her senses craved — after that she would reconsider her situation , and take counsel with her dignity . Her enjoyment of her surroundings was , indeed , tinged by the unpleasant consideration that she was accepting the hospitality and courting the approval of people she had disdained under other conditions . But she was growing less sensitive on such points : a hard glaze of indifference was fast forming over her delicacies and susceptibilities , and each concession to expediency hardened the surface a little more . On the Monday , when the party disbanded with uproarious adieux , the return to town threw into stronger relief the charms of the life she was leaving . The other guests were dispersing to take up the same existence in a different setting : some at Newport , some at Bar Harbour , some in the elaborate rusticity of an Adirondack camp . Even Gerty Farish , who welcomed Lily ’s return with tender solicitude , would soon be preparing to join the aunt with whom she spent her summers on Lake George : only Lily herself remained without plan or purpose , stranded in a backwater of the great current of pleasure . But Carry Fisher , who had insisted on transporting her to her own house , where she herself was to perch for a day or two on the way to the Brys ’ camp , came to the rescue with a new suggestion . “
108907	108915	108898	108898	they	199	” Mrs. Fisher clasped her hands enthusiastically . “
108976	108987	108998	108998	you	2313	” Miss Bart lifted her eyes with a keen glance . “
109001	109015	108998	108998	you	2313	” she said quietly ; and Mrs. Fisher responded with a deprecating kiss : “
109032	109142	109143	109143	You	2315	” * * * * * Miss Bart went with the Gormers to Alaska ; and the expedition , if it did not produce the effect anticipated by her friend , had at least the negative advantage of removing her from the fiery centre of criticism and discussion . Gerty Farish had opposed the plan with all the energy of her somewhat inarticulate nature . She had even offered to give up her visit to Lake George , and remain in town with Miss Bart , if the latter would renounce her journey ; but Lily could disguise her real distaste for this plan under a sufficiently valid reason . “
109152	109156	109143	109143	You	2315	” she protested , “
109272	109936	109951	109951	her	2322	” Gerty shook her head , mutely unconvinced . She felt not only that Lily was cheapening herself by making use of an intimacy she would never have cultivated from choice , but that , in drifting back now to her former manner of life , she was forfeiting her last chance of ever escaping from it . Gerty had but an obscure conception of what Lily ’s actual experience had been : but its consequences had established a lasting hold on her pity since the memorable night when she had offered up her own secret hope to her friend ’s extremity . To characters like Gerty ’s such a sacrifice constitutes a moral claim on the part of the person in whose behalf it has been made . Having once helped Lily , she must continue to help her ; and helping her , must believe in her , because faith is the main - spring of such natures . But even if Miss Bart , after her renewed taste of the amenities of life , could have returned to the barrenness of a New York August , mitigated only by poor Gerty ’s presence , her worldly wisdom would have counselled her against such an act of abnegation . She knew that Carry Fisher was right : that an opportune absence might be the first step toward rehabilitation , and that , at any rate , to linger on in town out of season was a fatal admission of defeat . From the Gormers ’ tumultuous progress across their native continent , she returned with an altered view of her situation . The renewed habit of luxury — the daily waking to an assured absence of care and presence of material ease — gradually blunted her appreciation of these values , and left her more conscious of the void they could not fill . Mattie Gormer ’s undiscriminating good - nature , and the slap - dash sociability of her friends , who treated Lily precisely as they treated each other — all these characteristic notes of difference began to wear upon her endurance ; and the more she saw to criticize in her companions , the less justification she found for making use of them . The longing to get back to her former surroundings hardened to a fixed idea ; but with the strengthening of her purpose came the inevitable perception that , to attain it , she must exact fresh concessions from her pride . These , for the moment , took the unpleasant form of continuing to cling to her hosts after their return from Alaska . Little as she was in the key of their MILIEU , her immense social facility , her long habit of adapting herself to others without suffering her own outline to be blurred , the skilled manipulation of all the polished implements of her craft , had won for her an important place in the Gormer group . If their resonant hilarity could never be hers , she contributed a note of easy elegance more valuable to Mattie Gormer than the louder passages of the band . Sam Gormer and his special cronies stood indeed a little in awe of her ; but Mattie ’s following , headed by Paul Morpeth , made her feel that they prized her for the very qualities they most conspicuously lacked . If Morpeth , whose social indolence was as great as his artistic activity , had abandoned himself to the easy current of the Gormer existence , where the minor exactions of politeness were unknown or ignored , and a man could either break his engagements , or keep them in a painting - jacket and slippers , he still preserved his sense of differences , and his appreciation of graces he had no time to cultivate . During the preparations for the Brys ’ TABLEAUX he had been immensely struck by Lily ’s plastic possibilities—“not
109960	110263	109958	109958	she	2322	make!”—and though his abhorrence of the world in which he had seen her was too great for him to think of seeking her there , he was fully alive to the privilege of having her to look at and listen to while he lounged in Mattie Gormer ’s dishevelled drawing - room . Lily had thus formed , in the tumult of her surroundings , a little nucleus of friendly relations which mitigated the crudeness of her course in lingering with the Gormers after their return . Nor was she without pale glimpses of her own world , especially since the breaking up of the Newport season had set the social current once more toward Long Island . Kate Corby , whose tastes made her as promiscuous as Carry Fisher was rendered by her necessities , occasionally descended on the Gormers , where , after a first stare of surprise , she took Lily ’s presence almost too much as a matter of course . Mrs. Fisher , too , appearing frequently in the neighbourhood , drove over to impart her experiences and give Lily what she called the latest report from the weather - bureau ; and the latter , who had never directly invited her confidence , could yet talk with her more freely than with Gerty Farish , in whose presence it was impossible even to admit the existence of much that Mrs. Fisher conveniently took for granted . Mrs. Fisher , moreover , had no embarrassing curiosity . She did not wish to probe the inwardness of Lily ’s situation , but simply to view it from the outside , and draw her conclusions accordingly ; and these conclusions , at the end of a confidential talk , she summed up to her friend in the succinct remark : “
110273	110287	110289	110289	you	2324	” Lily uttered a faint laugh — for once Mrs. Fisher lacked originality . “
110310	110311	110289	110289	you	2324	” “
110328	110338	110320	110321	my candidates	2326	” said Mrs. Fisher after a pause of reflection . “
110346	110347	110351	110351	I	0	” “
110364	110373	110351	110351	I	0	” Miss Bart received this with increasing amusement . “
110393	110394	110391	110391	he	2327	” “
110410	110411	110407	110408	George Dorset	131	” “
110415	110427	110407	110408	George Dorset	131	” Lily murmured reproachfully ; but Mrs. Fisher pressed on unrebuffed . “
110553	110561	110533	110533	George	131	” Miss Bart made an incredulous gesture . “
110588	110597	110584	110584	she	133	” Mrs. Fisher continued to observe her tentatively . “
110642	110657	110630	110630	him	2334	” She paused , and went on , dropping her glance from Lily ’s : “
110671	110672	110667	110667	he	2334	” “
110677	110682	110667	110667	he	2334	” Miss Bart repeated . “
110707	110718	110703	110703	I	0	” Lily interrupted her with a deep blush of displeasure . “
110735	110752	110726	110726	Carry	146	” And to divert her companion ’s attention she added , with an attempt at lightness : “
110764	110771	110772	110772	I	0	” Mrs. Fisher echoed her laugh . “
110789	110841	110786	110787	Sim Rosedale	124	” Miss Bart did not cry out : she sat silent , gazing thoughtfully at her friend . The suggestion , in truth , gave expression to a possibility which , in the last weeks , had more than once recurred to her ; but after a moment she said carelessly : “
110861	110869	110845	110859	a wife who can establish him in the bosom of the Van Osburghs and Trenors	2340	” Mrs. Fisher caught her up eagerly . “
110893	110894	110881	110881	you	2337	” “
110907	111077	110895	110895	I	0	” Lily returned , with a laugh intended to dismiss the subject . But in reality it lingered with her long after Mrs. Fisher had taken leave . She had seen very little of Rosedale since her annexation by the Gormers , for he was still steadily bent on penetrating to the inner Paradise from which she was now excluded ; but once or twice , when nothing better offered , he had turned up for a Sunday , and on these occasions he had left her in no doubt as to his view of her situation . That he still admired her was , more than ever , offensively evident ; for in the Gormer circle , where he expanded as in his native element , there were no puzzling conventions to check the full expression of his approval . But it was in the quality of his admiration that she read his shrewd estimate of her case . He enjoyed letting the Gormers see that he had known “
111079	111081	111082	111083	Miss Lily	109	Lily”—she was “
111084	112006	112007	112008	Miss Bart!—You’ll	280	” to him now — before they had had the faintest social existence : enjoyed more especially impressing Paul Morpeth with the distance to which their intimacy dated back . But he let it be felt that that intimacy was a mere ripple on the surface of a rushing social current , the kind of relaxation which a man of large interests and manifold preoccupations permits himself in his hours of ease . The necessity of accepting this view of their past relation , and of meeting it in the key of pleasantry prevalent among her new friends , was deeply humiliating to Lily . But she dared less than ever to quarrel with Rosedale . She suspected that her rejection rankled among the most unforgettable of his rebuffs , and the fact that he knew something of her wretched transaction with Trenor , and was sure to put the basest construction on it , seemed to place her hopelessly in his power . Yet at Carry Fisher ’s suggestion a new hope had stirred in her . Much as she disliked Rosedale , she no longer absolutely despised him . For he was gradually attaining his object in life , and that , to Lily , was always less despicable than to miss it . With the slow unalterable persistency which she had always felt in him , he was making his way through the dense mass of social antagonisms . Already his wealth , and the masterly use he had made of it , were giving him an enviable prominence in the world of affairs , and placing Wall Street under obligations which only Fifth Avenue could repay . In response to these claims , his name began to figure on municipal committees and charitable boards ; he appeared at banquets to distinguished strangers , and his candidacy at one of the fashionable clubs was discussed with diminishing opposition . He had figured once or twice at the Trenor dinners , and had learned to speak with just the right note of disdain of the big Van Osburgh crushes ; and all he now needed was a wife whose affiliations would shorten the last tedious steps of his ascent . It was with that object that , a year earlier , he had fixed his affections on Miss Bart ; but in the interval he had mounted nearer to the goal , while she had lost the power to abbreviate the remaining steps of the way . All this she saw with the clearness of vision that came to her in moments of despondency . It was success that dazzled her — she could distinguish facts plainly enough in the twilight of failure . And the twilight , as she now sought to pierce it , was gradually lighted by a faint spark of reassurance . Under the utilitarian motive of Rosedale ’s wooing she had felt , clearly enough , the heat of personal inclination . She would not have detested him so heartily had she not known that he dared to admire her . What , then , if the passion persisted , though the other motive had ceased to sustain it ? She had never even tried to please him — he had been drawn to her in spite of her manifest disdain . What if she now chose to exert the power which , even in its passive state , he had felt so strongly ? What if she made him marry her for love , now that he had no other reason for marrying her ? Chapter 6 As became persons of their rising consequence , the Gormers were engaged in building a country - house on Long Island ; and it was a part of Miss Bart ’s duty to attend her hostess on frequent visits of inspection to the new estate . There , while Mrs. Gormer plunged into problems of lighting and sanitation , Lily had leisure to wander , in the bright autumn air , along the tree - fringed bay to which the land declined . Little as she was addicted to solitude , there had come to be moments when it seemed a welcome escape from the empty noises of her life . She was weary of being swept passively along a current of pleasure and business in which she had no share ; weary of seeing other people pursue amusement and squander money , while she felt herself of no more account among them than an expensive toy in the hands of a spoiled child . It was in this frame of mind that , striking back from the shore one morning into the windings of an unfamiliar lane , she came suddenly upon the figure of George Dorset . The Dorset place was in the immediate neighbourhood of the Gormers ’ newly - acquired estate , and in her motor - flights thither with Mrs. Gormer , Lily had caught one or two passing glimpses of the couple ; but they moved in so different an orbit that she had not considered the possibility of a direct encounter . Dorset , swinging along with bent head , in moody abstraction , did not see Miss Bart till he was close upon her ; but the sight , instead of bringing him to a halt , as she had half - expected , sent him toward her with an eagerness which found expression in his opening words . “
112035	112094	112095	112095	I	0	” His face , with its tossed red hair and straggling moustache , had a driven uneasy look , as though life had become an unceasing race between himself and the thoughts at his heels . The look drew a word of compassionate greeting from Lily , and he pressed on , as if encouraged by her tone : “
112114	112123	112095	112095	I	0	” She checked him with a quick gesture . “
112139	112177	112178	112178	You	0	” she said , with a tinge of disdain which , as she instantly perceived , was not lost on him . He flushed to his haggard eyes , flushed so cruelly that she repented the thrust . “
112202	112203	112194	112194	I	0	” “
112214	112221	112204	112204	I	0	” she interposed , without irony ; “
112241	112252	112227	112227	I	0	” He met this with a look of genuine wonder . “
112273	112274	112223	112223	you	0	” “
112288	112289	112223	112223	you	0	” “
112293	112331	112223	112223	you	0	” he murmured , his head drooping again , and his irresolute hand switching at the underbrush along the lane . But as Lily made a movement to pass on , he broke out with fresh vehemence : “
112371	112427	112428	112428	I	0	” The lamentable weakness of the words roused a motion of pity in Lily ’s breast . She too needed friends — she had tasted the pang of loneliness ; and her resentment of Bertha Dorset ’s cruelty softened her heart to the poor wretch who was after all the chief of Bertha ’s victims . “
112444	112448	112435	112435	I	0	” she said . “
112472	112473	112465	112465	we	2347	” “
112487	112496	112483	112483	you	0	” He fixed his miserable gaze on her . “
112554	112555	112556	112556	I	0	” “
112575	112589	112556	112556	I	0	” Lily began , with renewed impatience ; but he broke in imploringly : “
112642	112643	112630	112630	I	0	” “
112692	112705	112688	112688	I	0	” He continued to stand before her , in his dogged weakness . “
112721	112741	112742	112743	Miss Bart	109	” he checked himself , slashing at the wayside weeds in a wider radius . Then he began again : “
112819	112846	112847	112847	I	0	” Lily ’s inward start betrayed itself in a quick blush : was it possible that this was really the sense of Carry Fisher ’s adumbrations ? “
112862	112915	112852	112852	I	0	” she murmured , drawing back a little from the mounting excitement of his look . Her tone seemed to sober him , as it had so often done in his stormiest moments . The stubborn lines of his face relaxed , and he said , with an abrupt drop to docility : “
112942	112987	112988	112988	I	0	” She paused a moment , moved in spite of herself by this reminder of her influence over him . Her fibres had been softened by suffering , and the sudden glimpse into his mocked and broken life disarmed her contempt for his weakness . “
113011	113012	113013	113013	I	0	” “
113021	113026	113013	113013	I	0	” he answered simply . “
113035	113040	113031	113031	you	0	person”—his voice dropped to a whisper—“the
113046	113077	113078	113078	You	0	” Again she felt her colour change ; again her heart rose in precipitate throbs to meet what she felt was coming . He lifted his eyes to her entreatingly . “
113268	113493	113496	113496	I’m	2361	” He spoke pantingly , like a tired runner , with breaks of exhaustion between his words ; and through the breaks she caught , as through the shifting rents of a fog , great golden vistas of peace and safety . For there was no mistaking the definite intention behind his vague appeal ; she could have filled up the blanks without the help of Mrs. Fisher ’s insinuations . Here was a man who turned to her in the extremity of his loneliness and his humiliation : if she came to him at such a moment he would be hers with all the force of his deluded faith . And the power to make him so lay in her hand — lay there in a completeness he could not even remotely conjecture . Revenge and rehabilitation might be hers at a stroke — there was something dazzling in the completeness of the opportunity . She stood silent , gazing away from him down the autumnal stretch of the deserted lane . And suddenly fear possessed her — fear of herself , and of the terrible force of the temptation . All her past weaknesses were like so many eager accomplices drawing her toward the path their feet had already smoothed . She turned quickly , and held out her hand to Dorset . “
113510	113511	113506	113506	I	0	” “
113521	113525	113496	113496	I’m	2361	” he cried ; “
113550	113551	113496	113496	I’m	2361	” “
113556	113578	113496	113496	I’m	2361	” she repeated hurriedly ; and as she moved away she heard him cry out on a last note of entreaty : “
113590	113720	113581	113581	you	0	” * * * * * Lily , on regaining the Gormer grounds , struck rapidly across the lawn toward the unfinished house , where she fancied that her hostess might be speculating , not too resignedly , on the cause of her delay ; for , like many unpunctual persons , Mrs. Gormer disliked to be kept waiting . As Miss Bart reached the avenue , however , she saw a smart phaeton with a high - stepping pair disappear behind the shrubbery in the direction of the gate ; and on the doorstep stood Mrs. Gormer , with a glow of retrospective pleasure on her open countenance . At sight of Lily the glow deepened to an embarrassed red , and she said with a slight laugh : “
113756	113808	113744	113744	she	131	” Lily met the announcement with her usual composure , though her experience of Bertha ’s idiosyncrasies would not have led her to include the neighbourly instinct among them ; and Mrs. Gormer , relieved to see that she gave no sign of surprise , went on with a deprecating laugh : “
113859	114810	113853	113853	people	2804	” This surprising event , coinciding too completely with her meeting with Dorset to be regarded as contingent upon it , had yet immediately struck Lily with a vague sense of foreboding . It was not in Bertha ’s habits to be neighbourly , much less to make advances to any one outside the immediate circle of her affinities . She had always consistently ignored the world of outer aspirants , or had recognized its individual members only when prompted by motives of self - interest ; and the very capriciousness of her condescensions had , as Lily was aware , given them special value in the eyes of the persons she distinguished . Lily saw this now in Mrs. Gormer ’s unconcealable complacency , and in the happy irrelevance with which , for the next day or two , she quoted Bertha ’s opinions and speculated on the origin of her gown . All the secret ambitions which Mrs. Gormer ’s native indolence , and the attitude of her companions , kept in habitual abeyance , were now germinating afresh in the glow of Bertha ’s advances ; and whatever the cause of the latter , Lily saw that , if they were followed up , they were likely to have a disturbing effect upon her own future . She had arranged to break the length of her stay with her new friends by one or two visits to other acquaintances as recent ; and on her return from this somewhat depressing excursion she was immediately conscious that Mrs. Dorset ’s influence was still in the air . There had been another exchange of visits , a tea at a country - club , an encounter at a hunt ball ; there was even a rumour of an approaching dinner , which Mattie Gormer , with an unnatural effort at discretion , tried to smuggle out of the conversation whenever Miss Bart took part in it . The latter had already planned to return to town after a farewell Sunday with her friends ; and , with Gerty Farish ’s aid , had discovered a small private hotel where she might establish herself for the winter . The hotel being on the edge of a fashionable neighbourhood , the price of the few square feet she was to occupy was considerably in excess of her means ; but she found a justification for her dislike of poorer quarters in the argument that , at this particular juncture , it was of the utmost importance to keep up a show of prosperity . In reality , it was impossible for her , while she had the means to pay her way for a week ahead , to lapse into a form of existence like Gerty Farish ’s . She had never been so near the brink of insolvency ; but she could at least manage to meet her weekly hotel bill , and having settled the heaviest of her previous debts out of the money she had received from Trenor , she had a still fair margin of credit to go upon . The situation , however , was not agreeable enough to lull her to complete unconsciousness of its insecurity . Her rooms , with their cramped outlook down a sallow vista of brick walls and fire - escapes , her lonely meals in the dark restaurant with its surcharged ceiling and haunting smell of coffee — all these material discomforts , which were yet to be accounted as so many privileges soon to be withdrawn , kept constantly before her the disadvantages of her state ; and her mind reverted the more insistently to Mrs. Fisher ’s counsels . Beat about the question as she would , she knew the outcome of it was that she must try to marry Rosedale ; and in this conviction she was fortified by an unexpected visit from George Dorset . She found him , on the first Sunday after her return to town , pacing her narrow sitting - room to the imminent peril of the few knick - knacks with which she had tried to disguise its plush exuberances ; but the sight of her seemed to quiet him , and he said meekly that he had n’t come to bother her — that he asked only to be allowed to sit for half an hour and talk of anything she liked . In reality , as she knew , he had but one subject : himself and his wretchedness ; and it was the need of her sympathy that had drawn him back . But he began with a pretence of questioning her about herself , and as she replied , she saw that , for the first time , a faint realization of her plight penetrated the dense surface of his self - absorption . Was it possible that her old beast of an aunt had actually cut her off ? That she was living alone like this because there was no one else for her to go to , and that she really had n’t more than enough to keep alive on till the wretched little legacy was paid ? The fibres of sympathy were nearly atrophied in him , but he was suffering so intensely that he had a faint glimpse of what other sufferings might mean — and , as she perceived , an almost simultaneous perception of the way in which her particular misfortunes might serve him . When at length she dismissed him , on the pretext that she must dress for dinner , he lingered entreatingly on the threshold to blurt out : “
114828	114849	114820	114820	you	2371	” But to this direct appeal it was impossible to give an assent ; and she said with friendly decisiveness : “
114862	114882	114858	114858	I	0	” He coloured to the eyes , pushed the door shut , and stood before her embarrassed but insistent . “
114925	114944	114917	114917	you	0	” Their eyes met , and for a second she trembled again with the nearness of the temptation . “
114957	114987	114988	114988	You	0	” she exclaimed , striving , by sheer force of reiteration , to build a barrier between herself and her peril ; and as he turned away , groaning out “
114993	115006	114988	114988	You	0	” she continued to repeat , as if it were a charm : “
115014	115977	114988	114988	You	0	” * * * * * Lily had seen little of Rosedale since her illuminating talk with Mrs. Fisher , but on the two or three occasions when they had met she was conscious of having distinctly advanced in his favour . There could be no doubt that he admired her as much as ever , and she believed it rested with herself to raise his admiration to the point where it should bear down the lingering counsels of expediency . The task was not an easy one ; but neither was it easy , in her long sleepless nights , to face the thought of what George Dorset was so clearly ready to offer . Baseness for baseness , she hated the other least : there were even moments when a marriage with Rosedale seemed the only honourable solution of her difficulties . She did not indeed let her imagination range beyond the day of plighting : after that everything faded into a haze of material well - being , in which the personality of her benefactor remained mercifully vague . She had learned , in her long vigils , that there were certain things not good to think of , certain midnight images that must at any cost be exorcised — and one of these was the image of herself as Rosedale ’s wife . Carry Fisher , on the strength , as she frankly owned , of the Brys ’ Newport success , had taken for the autumn months a small house at Tuxedo ; and thither Lily was bound on the Sunday after Dorset ’s visit . Though it was nearly dinner - time when she arrived , her hostess was still out , and the firelit quiet of the small silent house descended on her spirit with a sense of peace and familiarity . It may be doubted if such an emotion had ever before been evoked by Carry Fisher ’s surroundings ; but , contrasted to the world in which Lily had lately lived , there was an air of repose and stability in the very placing of the furniture , and in the quiet competence of the parlour - maid who led her up to her room . Mrs. Fisher ’s unconventionality was , after all , a merely superficial divergence from an inherited social creed , while the manners of the Gormer circle represented their first attempt to formulate such a creed for themselves . It was the first time since her return from Europe that Lily had found herself in a congenial atmosphere , and the stirring of familiar associations had almost prepared her , as she descended the stairs before dinner , to enter upon a group of her old acquaintances . But this expectation was instantly checked by the reflection that the friends who remained loyal were precisely those who would be least willing to expose her to such encounters ; and it was hardly with surprise that she found , instead , Mr. Rosedale kneeling domestically on the drawing - room hearth before his hostess ’s little girl . Rosedale in the paternal role was hardly a figure to soften Lily ; yet she could not but notice a quality of homely goodness in his advances to the child . They were not , at any rate , the premeditated and perfunctory endearments of the guest under his hostess ’s eye , for he and the little girl had the room to themselves ; and something in his attitude made him seem a simple and kindly being compared to the small critical creature who endured his homage . Yes , he would be kind — Lily , from the threshold , had time to feel — kind in his gross , unscrupulous , rapacious way , the way of the predatory creature with his mate . She had but a moment in which to consider whether this glimpse of the fireside man mitigated her repugnance , or gave it , rather , a more concrete and intimate form ; for at sight of her he was immediately on his feet again , the florid and dominant Rosedale of Mattie Gormer ’s drawing - room . It was no surprise to Lily to find that he had been selected as her only fellow - guest . Though she and her hostess had not met since the latter ’s tentative discussion of her future , Lily knew that the acuteness which enabled Mrs. Fisher to lay a safe and pleasant course through a world of antagonistic forces was not infrequently exercised for the benefit of her friends . It was , in fact , characteristic of Carry that , while she actively gleaned her own stores from the fields of affluence , her real sympathies were on the other side — with the unlucky , the unpopular , the unsuccessful , with all her hungry fellow - toilers in the shorn stubble of success . Mrs. Fisher ’s experience guarded her against the mistake of exposing Lily , for the first evening , to the unmitigated impression of Rosedale ’s personality . Kate Corby and two or three men dropped in to dinner , and Lily , alive to every detail of her friend ’s method , saw that such opportunities as had been contrived for her were to be deferred till she had , as it were , gained courage to make effectual use of them . She had a sense of acquiescing in this plan with the passiveness of a sufferer resigned to the surgeon ’s touch ; and this feeling of almost lethargic helplessness continued when , after the departure of the guests , Mrs. Fisher followed her upstairs . “
116002	116016	115996	115996	we	2373	” Mrs. Fisher looked about her with the eye of the solicitous hostess . “
116052	116095	116134	116138	a stern task - master	2379	” Carry , in her rare moments of prosperity , became so expansively maternal that Miss Bart sometimes wondered whether , if she could ever get time and money enough , she would not end by devoting them both to her daughter . “
116111	116130	116104	116104	I	0	” she continued , sinking down with a sigh of content on the pillowed lounge near the fire . “
116269	116366	116367	116367	Your	2384	” Mrs. Fisher was not a woman who talked of herself without cause , and the practice of direct speech , far from precluding in her an occasional resort to circuitous methods , served rather , at crucial moments , the purpose of the juggler ’s chatter while he shifts the contents of his sleeves . Through the haze of her cigarette - smoke she continued to gaze meditatively at Miss Bart , who , having dismissed her maid , sat before the toilet table shaking out over her shoulders the loosened undulations of her hair . “
116448	116480	116481	116481	I	0	” Miss Bart ’s immediate answer was to address a critical glance to the reflection of the countenance under discussion . Then she said , with a slight touch of irritation : “
116493	116498	116490	116491	Paul Morpeth	208	” Mrs. Fisher mused . “
116520	116531	116511	116511	he	208	” She waited a moment , and then went on : “
116565	116598	116546	116546	She	0	” She paused again to measure the effect of this announcement on her hearer , but the brush in Miss Bart ’s lifted hand maintained its unwavering stroke from brow to nape . “
116605	116610	116546	116546	She	0	” Mrs. Fisher pursued . “
116703	116718	116691	116691	she	271	” Lily laid aside her brush and turned a penetrating glance upon her friend . “
116722	116726	116720	116720	ME	0	” she suggested . “
116732	116747	116720	116720	ME	0	” murmured Mrs. Fisher , rising to push back a log from the hearth . “
116758	116765	116751	116751	Bertha	133	” Miss Bart went on steadily . “
116793	116799	116783	116783	she	133	” Mrs. Fisher sighed evasively . “
116855	116866	116841	116841	she	133	” Lily flushed under the shadow of her drooping hair . “
116873	116886	116841	116841	she	133	” she murmured , averting herself from Mrs. Fisher ’s anxious scrutiny . “
116923	116936	116937	116937	You	2161	” Mrs. Fisher gathered up her floating implications in a resolute grasp . “
117073	117635	117636	117636	I	0	” Chapter 7 The light projected on the situation by Mrs. Fisher had the cheerless distinctness of a winter dawn . It outlined the facts with a cold precision unmodified by shade or colour , and refracted , as it were , from the blank walls of the surrounding limitations : she had opened windows from which no sky was ever visible . But the idealist subdued to vulgar necessities must employ vulgar minds to draw the inferences to which he can not stoop ; and it was easier for Lily to let Mrs. Fisher formulate her case than to put it plainly to herself . Once confronted with it , however , she went the full length of its consequences ; and these had never been more clearly present to her than when , the next afternoon , she set out for a walk with Rosedale . It was one of those still November days when the air is haunted with the light of summer , and something in the lines of the landscape , and in the golden haze which bathed them , recalled to Miss Bart the September afternoon when she had climbed the slopes of Bellomont with Selden . The importunate memory was kept before her by its ironic contrast to her present situation , since her walk with Selden had represented an irresistible flight from just such a climax as the present excursion was designed to bring about . But other memories importuned her also ; the recollection of similar situations , as skillfully led up to , but through some malice of fortune , or her own unsteadiness of purpose , always failing of the intended result . Well , her purpose was steady enough now . She saw that the whole weary work of rehabilitation must begin again , and against far greater odds , if Bertha Dorset should succeed in breaking up her friendship with the Gormers ; and her longing for shelter and security was intensified by the passionate desire to triumph over Bertha , as only wealth and predominance could triumph over her . As the wife of Rosedale — the Rosedale she felt it in her power to create — she would at least present an invulnerable front to her enemy . She had to draw upon this thought , as upon some fiery stimulant , to keep up her part in the scene toward which Rosedale was too frankly tending . As she walked beside him , shrinking in every nerve from the way in which his look and tone made free of her , yet telling herself that this momentary endurance of his mood was the price she must pay for her ultimate power over him , she tried to calculate the exact point at which concession must turn to resistance , and the price HE would have to pay be made equally clear to him . But his dapper self - confidence seemed impenetrable to such hints , and she had a sense of something hard and self - contained behind the superficial warmth of his manner . They had been seated for some time in the seclusion of a rocky glen above the lake , when she suddenly cut short the culmination of an impassioned period by turning upon him the grave loveliness of her gaze . “
117646	117651	117640	117640	you	2401	” she said quietly ; “
117663	117701	117653	117653	I	0	” Rosedale , reddening to the roots of his glossy hair , received this announcement with a recoil which carried him to his feet , where he halted before her in an attitude of almost comic discomfiture . “
117712	117722	117708	117708	you	2401	” she continued , in the same quiet tone . “
117762	117863	117864	117864	My	0	” She spoke with the noble directness which she could command on such occasions , and which was like a large steady light thrown across the tortuous darkness of the situation . In its inconvenient brightness Rosedale seemed to waver a moment , as though conscious that every avenue of escape was unpleasantly illuminated . Then he gave a short laugh , and drew out a gold cigarette - case , in which , with plump jewelled fingers , he groped for a gold - tipped cigarette . Selecting one , he paused to contemplate it a moment before saying : “
117902	117933	117883	117883	you	109	” Lily ’s blood tingled with the grossness of the rebuff ; but she checked the first leap of her anger , and said in a tone of gentle dignity : “
117954	117992	117943	117943	I	0	” Her word - play was always too quick for him , and this reply held him in puzzled silence while she extended her hand and added , with the faintest inflection of sadness in her voice : “
118017	118069	118072	118072	you	0	” The touch of her hand , the moving softness of her look , thrilled a vulnerable fibre in Rosedale . It was her exquisite inaccessibleness , the sense of distance she could convey without a hint of disdain , that made it most difficult for him to give her up . “
118090	118105	118072	118072	you	0	” he urged , without releasing her hand . She drew it away quietly . “
118115	118123	118108	118108	your	0	” she returned with a slight smile . “
118135	118145	118108	118108	your	0	” Rosedale laughed with a recovered sense of ease . “
118198	118204	118205	118205	I	0	” She continued to smile . “
118223	118267	118211	118211	I	0	” She turned away , as though to mark that its final term had in fact been reached , and he followed her for a few steps with a baffled sense of her having after all kept the game in her own hands . “
118272	118305	118268	118269	Miss Lily	109	” he began impulsively ; but she walked on without seeming to hear him . He overtook her in a few quick strides , and laid an entreating hand on her arm . “
118347	118374	118337	118337	you	109	” She had paused a moment with raised brows , drawing away instinctively from his touch , though she made no effort to evade his words . “
118381	118385	118337	118337	you	109	” she rejoined , “
118397	118398	118387	118387	you	109	” “
118477	118491	118492	118492	You	109	” She continued to confront him with the same air of ironic composure . “
118509	118510	118492	118492	You	109	” “
118520	118525	118516	118516	I	0	” he answered resolutely . “
118570	118597	118553	118553	they	2411	” She flushed to her temples , but the extremity of her need checked the retort on her lip and she continued to face him composedly . “
118604	118608	118553	118553	they	2411	” she said , “
118616	118645	118553	118553	they	2411	” He met this with a steady gaze of his small stock - taking eyes , which made her feel herself no more than some superfine human merchandise . “
118742	118743	118744	118744	You	0	” “
118749	118755	118746	118746	you	0	” broke from her ironically . “
118770	118791	118760	118760	I	0	” He stood before her , his hands in his pockets , his chest sturdily expanded under its vivid waistcoat . “
118957	118994	118951	118951	I	0	” Miss Bart continued to stand before him in a silence that might have expressed either mockery or a half - reluctant respect for his candour , and after a moment ’s pause he went on : “
119040	119083	119084	119084	I	0	” She received this with a look from which all tinge of resentment had faded . After the tissue of social falsehoods in which she had so long moved it was refreshing to step into the open daylight of an avowed expediency . “
119088	119092	119086	119086	you	0	” she said . “
119124	119148	119116	119116	you	0	” She extended her hand with a smile . Again the gesture had a disturbing effect upon Mr. Rosedale ’s self - command . “
119162	119179	119180	119180	Lily	109	” he exclaimed ; and as she began once more to move away , he broke out suddenly—“Miss
119216	119238	119201	119213	a woman who did n’t hesitate to sacrifice you to her own convenience	2423	” Lily drew away with a movement of quick disdain : it was easier to endure his insolence than his commiseration . “
119256	119275	119245	119245	I	0	” But Rosedale ’s natural imperviousness to hints made it easy for him to brush such resistance aside . “
119295	119332	119284	119284	I	0	” he persisted . She paused in spite of herself , held by the note of a new purpose in his look and tone ; and he went on , keeping his eyes firmly upon her : “
119361	119389	119393	119393	you	109	” She continued silent under the rush of astonishment that his words produced , and he moved a step closer to ask with low - toned directness : “
119404	119538	119539	119539	You	109	” Lily stood speechless under the shock of the interrogation . In the words preceding it she had conjectured , at most , an allusion to her supposed influence over George Dorset ; nor did the astonishing indelicacy of the reference diminish the likelihood of Rosedale ’s resorting to it . But now she saw how far short of the mark she had fallen ; and the surprise of learning that he had discovered the secret of the letters left her , for the moment , unconscious of the special use to which he was in the act of putting his knowledge . Her temporary loss of self - possession gave him time to press his point ; and he went on quickly , as though to secure completer control of the situation : “
119596	119622	119623	119623	You	109	” She continued to look at him with a deepening bewilderment : her only clear impression resolved itself into a scared sense of his power . “
119633	119648	119627	119627	I	0	” he went on , answering her look with a note of conscious pride . “
119938	120343	120344	120344	You	2436	” He paused long enough to draw breath , but not to give her time for the expression of her gathering resistance ; and as he pressed on , expounding and elucidating his idea with the directness of the man who has no doubts of his cause , she found the indignation gradually freezing on her lip , found herself held fast in the grasp of his argument by the mere cold strength of its presentation . There was no time now to wonder how he had heard of her obtaining the letters : all her world was dark outside the monstrous glare of his scheme for using them . And it was not , after the first moment , the horror of the idea that held her spell - bound , subdued to his will ; it was rather its subtle affinity to her own inmost cravings . He would marry her tomorrow if she could regain Bertha Dorset ’s friendship ; and to induce the open resumption of that friendship , and the tacit retractation of all that had caused its withdrawal , she had only to put to the lady the latent menace contained in the packet so miraculously delivered into her hands . Lily saw in a flash the advantage of this course over that which poor Dorset had pressed upon her . The other plan depended for its success on the infliction of an open injury , while this reduced the transaction to a private understanding , of which no third person need have the remotest hint . Put by Rosedale in terms of businesslike give - and - take , this understanding took on the harmless air of a mutual accommodation , like a transfer of property or a revision of boundary lines . It certainly simplified life to view it as a perpetual adjustment , a play of party politics , in which every concession had its recognized equivalent : Lily ’s tired mind was fascinated by this escape from fluctuating ethical estimates into a region of concrete weights and measures . Rosedale , as she listened , seemed to read in her silence not only a gradual acquiescence in his plan , but a dangerously far - reaching perception of the chances it offered ; for as she continued to stand before him without speaking , he broke out , with a quick return upon himself : “
120656	120803	120649	120649	you	2436	” he added , moving suddenly nearer . The words , and the movement which accompanied them , combined to startle Lily out of the state of tranced subservience into which she had insensibly slipped . Light comes in devious ways to the groping consciousness , and it came to her now through the disgusted perception that her would - be accomplice assumed , as a matter of course , the likelihood of her distrusting him and perhaps trying to cheat him of his share of the spoils . This glimpse of his inner mind seemed to present the whole transaction in a new aspect , and she saw that the essential baseness of the act lay in its freedom from risk . She drew back with a quick gesture of rejection , saying , in a voice that was a surprise to her own ears : “
120823	120853	120818	120818	you	2436	” Rosedale stared a moment , puzzled by her sudden dash in a direction so different from that toward which she had appeared to be letting him guide her . “
120869	120878	120862	120862	I	0	” he exclaimed ; and to her murmur of “
120885	120895	120862	120862	I	0	” he retorted with a sudden burst of violence : “
120926	121899	120862	120862	I	0	” Chapter 8 The autumn days declined to winter . Once more the leisure world was in transition between country and town , and Fifth Avenue , still deserted at the week - end , showed from Monday to Friday a broadening stream of carriages between house - fronts gradually restored to consciousness . The Horse Show , some two weeks earlier , had produced a passing semblance of reanimation , filling the theatres and restaurants with a human display of the same costly and high - stepping kind as circled daily about its ring . In Miss Bart ’s world the Horse Show , and the public it attracted , had ostensibly come to be classed among the spectacles disdained of the elect ; but , as the feudal lord might sally forth to join in the dance on his village green , so society , unofficially and incidentally , still condescended to look in upon the scene . Mrs. Gormer , among the rest , was not above seizing such an occasion for the display of herself and her horses ; and Lily was given one or two opportunities of appearing at her friend ’s side in the most conspicuous box the house afforded . But this lingering semblance of intimacy made her only the more conscious of a change in the relation between Mattie and herself , of a dawning discrimination , a gradually formed social standard , emerging from Mrs. Gormer ’s chaotic view of life . It was inevitable that Lily herself should constitute the first sacrifice to this new ideal , and she knew that , once the Gormers were established in town , the whole drift of fashionable life would facilitate Mattie ’s detachment from her . She had , in short , failed to make herself indispensable ; or rather , her attempt to do so had been thwarted by an influence stronger than any she could exert . That influence , in its last analysis , was simply the power of money : Bertha Dorset ’s social credit was based on an impregnable bank - account . Lily knew that Rosedale had overstated neither the difficulty of her own position nor the completeness of the vindication he offered : once Bertha ’s match in material resources , her superior gifts would make it easy for her to dominate her adversary . An understanding of what such domination would mean , and of the disadvantages accruing from her rejection of it , was brought home to Lily with increasing clearness during the early weeks of the winter . Hitherto , she had kept up a semblance of movement outside the main flow of the social current ; but with the return to town , and the concentrating of scattered activities , the mere fact of not slipping back naturally into her old habits of life marked her as being unmistakably excluded from them . If one were not a part of the season ’s fixed routine , one swung unsphered in a void of social non - existence . Lily , for all her dissatisfied dreaming , had never really conceived the possibility of revolving about a different centre : it was easy enough to despise the world , but decidedly difficult to find any other habitable region . Her sense of irony never quite deserted her , and she could still note , with self - directed derision , the abnormal value suddenly acquired by the most tiresome and insignificant details of her former life . Its very drudgeries had a charm now that she was involuntarily released from them : card - leaving , note - writing , enforced civilities to the dull and elderly , and the smiling endurance of tedious dinners — how pleasantly such obligations would have filled the emptiness of her days ! She did indeed leave cards in plenty ; she kept herself , with a smiling and valiant persistence , well in the eye of her world ; nor did she suffer any of those gross rebuffs which sometimes produce a wholesome reaction of contempt in their victim . Society did not turn away from her , it simply drifted by , preoccupied and inattentive , letting her feel , to the full measure of her humbled pride , how completely she had been the creature of its favour . She had rejected Rosedale ’s suggestion with a promptness of scorn almost surprising to herself : she had not lost her capacity for high flashes of indignation . But she could not breathe long on the heights ; there had been nothing in her training to develop any continuity of moral strength : what she craved , and really felt herself entitled to , was a situation in which the noblest attitude should also be the easiest . Hitherto her intermittent impulses of resistance had sufficed to maintain her self - respect . If she slipped she recovered her footing , and it was only afterward that she was aware of having recovered it each time on a slightly lower level . She had rejected Rosedale ’s offer without conscious effort ; her whole being had risen against it ; and she did not yet perceive that , by the mere act of listening to him , she had learned to live with ideas which would once have been intolerable to her . * * * * * To Gerty Farish , keeping watch over her with a tenderer if less discerning eye than Mrs. Fisher ’s , the results of the struggle were already distinctly visible . She did not , indeed , know what hostages Lily had already given to expediency ; but she saw her passionately and irretrievably pledged to the ruinous policy of “
121903	122261	120862	120862	I	0	” Gerty could smile now at her own early dream of her friend ’s renovation through adversity : she understood clearly enough that Lily was not of those to whom privation teaches the unimportance of what they have lost . But this very fact , to Gerty , made her friend the more piteously in want of aid , the more exposed to the claims of a tenderness she was so little conscious of needing . Lily , since her return to town , had not often climbed Miss Farish ’s stairs . There was something irritating to her in the mute interrogation of Gerty ’s sympathy : she felt the real difficulties of her situation to be incommunicable to any one whose theory of values was so different from her own , and the restrictions of Gerty ’s life , which had once had the charm of contrast , now reminded her too painfully of the limits to which her own existence was shrinking . When at length , one afternoon , she put into execution the belated resolve to visit her friend , this sense of shrunken opportunities possessed her with unusual intensity . The walk up Fifth Avenue , unfolding before her , in the brilliance of the hard winter sunlight , an interminable procession of fastidiously - equipped carriages — giving her , through the little squares of brougham - windows , peeps of familiar profiles bent above visiting - lists , of hurried hands dispensing notes and cards to attendant footmen — this glimpse of the ever - revolving wheels of the great social machine made Lily more than ever conscious of the steepness and narrowness of Gerty ’s stairs , and of the cramped blind alley of life to which they led . Dull stairs destined to be mounted by dull people : how many thousands of insignificant figures were going up and down such stairs all over the world at that very moment — figures as shabby and uninteresting as that of the middle - aged lady in limp black who descended Gerty ’s flight as Lily climbed to it ! “
122290	122304	122269	122269	she	281	” Gerty explained , as Lily followed her into the sitting - room . “
122315	122338	122339	122339	I	0	” Miss Bart asked with a touch of irritation : she had not come to listen to the woes of other people . “
122443	122459	122486	122486	Bertha	133	” Miss Farish paused with a sigh which reflected the perplexity of her departing visitor . “
122720	122730	122731	122731	My	0	” Lily met this query with an impatient gesture . “
122754	122780	122784	122784	they	2458	” She loosened her furs and settled herself in Gerty ’s easy - chair , while her friend busied herself with the tea - cups . “
122799	122876	122877	122877	I	0	” she asked , conscious that the note of irritation still persisted in her voice . It was the very last topic she had meant to discuss — it really did not interest her in the least — but she was seized by a sudden perverse curiosity to know how the two colourless shrinking victims of young Silverton ’s sentimental experiments meant to cope with the grim necessity which lurked so close to her own threshold . “
122923	122924	122916	122917	Miss Annie	283	” “
122951	122990	122991	122991	I	0	” exclaimed Lily , starting up with a vehemence of movement that threatened destruction to Miss Farish ’s fragile tea - table . Lily bent over to steady the cups ; then she sank back into her seat . “
123027	123054	123019	123019	I	0	” she sighed out incoherently . Gerty lifted an apprehensive look to her pale face , in which the eyes shone with a peculiar sleepless lustre . “
123077	123096	123068	123068	me	0	” Miss Bart accepted the cup of tea , but put back the cushion with an impatient hand . “
123120	123121	123103	123103	I	0	” “
123138	123143	123129	123129	I	0	” Gerty urged affectionately . “
123179	123180	123181	123181	You	0	” “
123191	123192	123193	123193	I	0	” “
123203	123217	123193	123193	I	0	” She rose and put the empty cup on the tea - tray . “
123241	123242	123193	123193	I	0	” “
123255	123256	123193	123193	I	0	” “
123273	123303	123193	123193	I	0	” Lily returned imperiously . Her voice had a dangerous edge , and Gerty noticed that her hand shook as she held it out to receive the second cup . “
123319	123330	123310	123310	I	0	” Miss Bart set down her cup with a start . “
123342	123358	123337	123337	my	0	” She rose and walked quickly toward the little mirror above the writing - table . “
123381	123393	123394	123394	You	2964	” She turned back , fixing her plaintive eyes on Gerty . “
123429	123444	123400	123400	you	2964	” She caught Gerty ’s wrists , and drew her close to the window . “
123473	123474	123475	123475	You	112	” “
123501	123502	123489	123489	your	112	” “
123596	123597	123587	123587	I	0	” “
123604	123619	123587	123587	I	0	” asked Gerty , gently detaching her wrists from her friend ’s feverish fingers . “
123641	123661	123662	123662	You	2964	” Lily turned away and sank with sudden weariness into the easy - chair near the tea - table . “
123858	123929	123944	123944	I’m	0	” She leaned back for a moment , closing her eyes , and as she sat there , her pale lips slightly parted , and the lids dropped above her fagged brilliant gaze , Gerty had a startled perception of the change in her face — of the way in which an ashen daylight seemed suddenly to extinguish its artificial brightness . She looked up , and the vision vanished . “
124091	124103	124059	124063	thousands and thousands of women	2481	” She rose again with a hurried glance at the clock . “
124144	124174	124139	124139	I	0	” She was before the mirror again , adjusting her hair with a light hand , drawing down her veil , and giving a dexterous touch to her furs . “
124271	124685	124262	124262	she	2484	” * * * * * Miss Bart had not revealed to Gerty the full extent of her anxiety . She was in fact in urgent and immediate need of money : money to meet the vulgar weekly claims which could neither be deferred nor evaded . To give up her apartment , and shrink to the obscurity of a boarding - house , or the provisional hospitality of a bed in Gerty Farish ’s sitting - room , was an expedient which could only postpone the problem confronting her ; and it seemed wiser as well as more agreeable to remain where she was and find some means of earning her living . The possibility of having to do this was one which she had never before seriously considered , and the discovery that , as a bread - winner , she was likely to prove as helpless and ineffectual as poor Miss Silverton , was a severe shock to her self - confidence . Having been accustomed to take herself at the popular valuation , as a person of energy and resource , naturally fitted to dominate any situation in which she found herself , she vaguely imagined that such gifts would be of value to seekers after social guidance ; but there was unfortunately no specific head under which the art of saying and doing the right thing could be offered in the market , and even Mrs. Fisher ’s resourcefulness failed before the difficulty of discovering a workable vein in the vague wealth of Lily ’s graces . Mrs. Fisher was full of indirect expedients for enabling her friends to earn a living , and could conscientiously assert that she had put several opportunities of this kind before Lily ; but more legitimate methods of bread - winning were as much out of her line as they were beyond the capacity of the sufferers she was generally called upon to assist . Lily ’s failure to profit by the chances already afforded her might , moreover , have justified the abandonment of farther effort on her behalf ; but Mrs. Fisher ’s inexhaustible good - nature made her an adept at creating artificial demands in response to an actual supply . In the pursuance of this end she at once started on a voyage of discovery in Miss Bart ’s behalf ; and as the result of her explorations she now summoned the latter with the announcement that she had “
124689	125169	124262	124262	she	2484	” * * * * * Left to herself , Gerty mused distressfully upon her friend ’s plight , and her own inability to relieve it . It was clear to her that Lily , for the present , had no wish for the kind of help she could give . Miss Farish could see no hope for her friend but in a life completely reorganized and detached from its old associations ; whereas all Lily ’s energies were centred in the determined effort to hold fast to those associations , to keep herself visibly identified with them , as long as the illusion could be maintained . Pitiable as such an attitude seemed to Gerty , she could not judge it as harshly as Selden , for instance , might have done . She had not forgotten the night of emotion when she and Lily had lain in each other ’s arms , and she had seemed to feel her very heart ’s blood passing into her friend . The sacrifice she had made had seemed unavailing enough ; no trace remained in Lily of the subduing influences of that hour ; but Gerty ’s tenderness , disciplined by long years of contact with obscure and inarticulate suffering , could wait on its object with a silent forbearance which took no account of time . She could not , however , deny herself the solace of taking anxious counsel with Lawrence Selden , with whom , since his return from Europe , she had renewed her old relation of cousinly confidence . Selden himself had never been aware of any change in their relation . He found Gerty as he had left her , simple , undemanding and devoted , but with a quickened intelligence of the heart which he recognized without seeking to explain it . To Gerty herself it would once have seemed impossible that she should ever again talk freely with him of Lily Bart ; but what had passed in the secrecy of her own breast seemed to resolve itself , when the mist of the struggle cleared , into a breaking down of the bounds of self , a deflecting of the wasted personal emotion into the general current of human understanding . It was not till some two weeks after her visit from Lily that Gerty had the opportunity of communicating her fears to Selden . The latter , having presented himself on a Sunday afternoon , had lingered on through the dowdy animation of his cousin ’s tea - hour , conscious of something in her voice and eye which solicited a word apart ; and as soon as the last visitor was gone Gerty opened her case by asking how lately he had seen Miss Bart . Selden ’s perceptible pause gave her time for a slight stir of surprise . “
125188	125215	125182	125182	her	2486	” This unexpected admission made Gerty pause too ; and she was still hesitating on the brink of her subject when he relieved her by adding : “
125240	125241	125224	125224	she	2486	” “
125255	125256	125249	125249	she	2486	” “
125264	125265	125261	125262	the Gormers	257	” “
125304	125305	125298	125299	Bertha Dorset	133	” “
125309	125338	125298	125299	Bertha Dorset	133	” Selden exclaimed , rising abruptly to walk to the window , where he remained with his eyes on the darkening street while his cousin continued to explain : “
125391	125392	125369	125370	Mrs. Peniston	114	” “
125398	125426	125369	125370	Mrs. Peniston	114	” Selden assented curtly , turning back into the room , but only to stir about with restless steps in the circumscribed space between door and window . “
125457	125468	125449	125449	his	2491	” His words caused Gerty a slight chill of disappointment . “
125479	125504	125476	125476	your	2488	” she suggested . Selden , with a slight laugh , sat down beside her on the little sofa which projected from the hearth . “
125515	125544	125507	125507	you	2488	” he asked . Gerty ’s colour rose , and her blush was for a moment her only answer . Then she made it more explicit by saying : “
125604	125605	125606	125606	My	0	” “
125638	125670	125635	125635	your	2493	” Selden , for his life , could not keep a note of dryness out of his voice ; but he met Gerty ’s look of perplexity by saying more mildly : “
125704	125785	125688	125688	you	2493	” He laid his hand for a moment on hers , and there passed between them , on the current of the rare contact , one of those exchanges of meaning which fill the hidden reservoirs of affection . Gerty had the feeling that he measured the cost of her request as plainly as she read the significance of his reply ; and the sense of all that was suddenly clear between them made her next words easier to find . “
125939	125972	125973	125973	I	0	” Gerty broke off , abashed at the sound of her own eloquence , and impeded by the difficulty of giving precise expression to her vague yearning for her friend ’s retrieval . “
125988	125992	125980	125980	she	109	” she continued . “
126175	126218	126155	126155	she	109	” Selden had listened in silence , with the concentrated look which his thin dark face could assume when he wished to guard it against any involuntary change of expression . When his cousin ended , he said with a slight smile : “
126240	126259	126233	126233	you	109	” but the troubled appeal of her eyes made him add , as he rose to take leave : “
126278	126753	126262	126262	I	0	” Selden ’s avoidance of Miss Bart had not been as unintentional as he had allowed his cousin to think . At first , indeed , while the memory of their last hour at Monte Carlo still held the full heat of his indignation , he had anxiously watched for her return ; but she had disappointed him by lingering in England , and when she finally reappeared it happened that business had called him to the West , whence he came back only to learn that she was starting for Alaska with the Gormers . The revelation of this suddenly - established intimacy effectually chilled his desire to see her . If , at a moment when her whole life seemed to be breaking up , she could cheerfully commit its reconstruction to the Gormers , there was no reason why such accidents should ever strike her as irreparable . Every step she took seemed in fact to carry her farther from the region where , once or twice , he and she had met for an illumined moment ; and the recognition of this fact , when its first pang had been surmounted , produced in him a sense of negative relief . It was much simpler for him to judge Miss Bart by her habitual conduct than by the rare deviations from it which had thrown her so disturbingly in his way ; and every act of hers which made the recurrence of such deviations more unlikely , confirmed the sense of relief with which he returned to the conventional view of her . But Gerty Farish ’s words had sufficed to make him see how little this view was really his , and how impossible it was for him to live quietly with the thought of Lily Bart . To hear that she was in need of help — even such vague help as he could offer — was to be at once repossessed by that thought ; and by the time he reached the street he had sufficiently convinced himself of the urgency of his cousin ’s appeal to turn his steps directly toward Lily ’s hotel . There his zeal met a check in the unforeseen news that Miss Bart had moved away ; but , on his pressing his enquiries , the clerk remembered that she had left an address , for which he presently began to search through his books . It was certainly strange that she should have taken this step without letting Gerty Farish know of her decision ; and Selden waited with a vague sense of uneasiness while the address was sought for . The process lasted long enough for uneasiness to turn to apprehension ; but when at length a slip of paper was handed him , and he read on it : “
126763	126985	126756	126758	Mrs. Norma Hatch	285	” his apprehension passed into an incredulous stare , and this into the gesture of disgust with which he tore the paper in two , and turned to walk quickly homeward . Chapter 9 When Lily woke on the morning after her translation to the Emporium Hotel , her first feeling was one of purely physical satisfaction . The force of contrast gave an added keenness to the luxury of lying once more in a soft - pillowed bed , and looking across a spacious sunlit room at a breakfast - table set invitingly near the fire . Analysis and introspection might come later ; but for the moment she was not even troubled by the excesses of the upholstery or the restless convolutions of the furniture . The sense of being once more lapped and folded in ease , as in some dense mild medium impenetrable to discomfort , effectually stilled the faintest note of criticism . When , the afternoon before , she had presented herself to the lady to whom Carry Fisher had directed her , she had been conscious of entering a new world . Carry ’s vague presentment of Mrs. Norma Hatch ( whose reversion to her Christian name was explained as the result of her latest divorce ) , left her under the implication of coming “
126990	127050	126756	126758	Mrs. Norma Hatch	285	” with the not unusual extenuation of having brought a great deal of money with her . She was , in short , rich , helpless , unplaced : the very subject for Lily ’s hand . Mrs. Fisher had not specified the line her friend was to take ; she owned herself unacquainted with Mrs. Hatch , whom she “
127053	127372	126262	126262	I	0	” through Melville Stancy , a lawyer in his leisure moments , and the Falstaff of a certain section of festive club life . Socially , Mr. Stancy might have been said to form a connecting link between the Gormer world and the more dimly - lit region on which Miss Bart now found herself entering . It was , however , only figuratively that the illumination of Mrs. Hatch ’s world could be described as dim : in actual fact , Lily found her seated in a blaze of electric light , impartially projected from various ornamental excrescences on a vast concavity of pink damask and gilding , from which she rose like Venus from her shell . The analogy was justified by the appearance of the lady , whose large - eyed prettiness had the fixity of something impaled and shown under glass . This did not preclude the immediate discovery that she was some years younger than her visitor , and that under her showiness , her ease , the aggression of her dress and voice , there persisted that ineradicable innocence which , in ladies of her nationality , so curiously coexists with startling extremes of experience . The environment in which Lily found herself was as strange to her as its inhabitants . She was unacquainted with the world of the fashionable New York hotel — a world over - heated , over - upholstered , and over - fitted with mechanical appliances for the gratification of fantastic requirements , while the comforts of a civilized life were as unattainable as in a desert . Through this atmosphere of torrid splendour moved wan beings as richly upholstered as the furniture , beings without definite pursuits or permanent relations , who drifted on a languid tide of curiosity from restaurant to concert - hall , from palm - garden to music - room , from “
127375	127563	126262	126262	I	0	” to dress - maker ’s opening . High - stepping horses or elaborately equipped motors waited to carry these ladies into vague metropolitan distances , whence they returned , still more wan from the weight of their sables , to be sucked back into the stifling inertia of the hotel routine . Somewhere behind them , in the background of their lives , there was doubtless a real past , peopled by real human activities : they themselves were probably the product of strong ambitions , persistent energies , diversified contacts with the wholesome roughness of life ; yet they had no more real existence than the poet ’s shades in limbo . Lily had not been long in this pallid world without discovering that Mrs. Hatch was its most substantial figure . That lady , though still floating in the void , showed faint symptoms of developing an outline ; and in this endeavour she was actively seconded by Mr. Melville Stancy . It was Mr. Stancy , a man of large resounding presence , suggestive of convivial occasions and of a chivalry finding expression in “
127567	127632	127633	127634	Sunday Supplements	288	” boxes and thousand dollar bonbonnieres , who had transplanted Mrs. Hatch from the scene of her first development to the higher stage of hotel life in the metropolis . It was he who had selected the horses with which she had taken the blue ribbon at the Show , had introduced her to the photographer whose portraits of her formed the recurring ornament of “
127636	127749	127633	127634	Sunday Supplements	288	” and had got together the group which constituted her social world . It was a small group still , with heterogeneous figures suspended in large unpeopled spaces ; but Lily did not take long to learn that its regulation was no longer in Mr. Stancy ’s hands . As often happens , the pupil had outstripped the teacher , and Mrs. Hatch was already aware of heights of elegance as well as depths of luxury beyond the world of the Emporium . This discovery at once produced in her a craving for higher guidance , for the adroit feminine hand which should give the right turn to her correspondence , the right “
127751	127963	127633	127634	Sunday Supplements	288	” to her hats , the right succession to the items of her MENUS . It was , in short , as the regulator of a germinating social life that Miss Bart ’s guidance was required ; her ostensible duties as secretary being restricted by the fact that Mrs. Hatch , as yet , knew hardly any one to write to . The daily details of Mrs. Hatch ’s existence were as strange to Lily as its general tenor . The lady ’s habits were marked by an Oriental indolence and disorder peculiarly trying to her companion . Mrs. Hatch and her friends seemed to float together outside the bounds of time and space . No definite hours were kept ; no fixed obligations existed : night and day flowed into one another in a blur of confused and retarded engagements , so that one had the impression of lunching at the tea - hour , while dinner was often merged in the noisy after - theatre supper which prolonged Mrs. Hatch ’s vigil till daylight . Through this jumble of futile activities came and went a strange throng of hangers - on — manicures , beauty - doctors , hair - dressers , teachers of bridge , of French , of “
127966	128192	127633	127634	Sunday Supplements	288	” : figures sometimes indistinguishable , by their appearance , or by Mrs. Hatch ’s relation to them , from the visitors constituting her recognized society . But strangest of all to Lily was the encounter , in this latter group , of several of her acquaintances . She had supposed , and not without relief , that she was passing , for the moment , completely out of her own circle ; but she found that Mr. Stancy , one side of whose sprawling existence overlapped the edge of Mrs. Fisher ’s world , had drawn several of its brightest ornaments into the circle of the Emporium . To find Ned Silverton among the habitual frequenters of Mrs. Hatch ’s drawing - room was one of Lily ’s first astonishments ; but she soon discovered that he was not Mr. Stancy ’s most important recruit . It was on little Freddy Van Osburgh , the small slim heir of the Van Osburgh millions , that the attention of Mrs. Hatch ’s group was centred . Freddy , barely out of college , had risen above the horizon since Lily ’s eclipse , and she now saw with surprise what an effulgence he shed on the outer twilight of Mrs. Hatch ’s existence . This , then , was one of the things that young men “
128195	128210	127633	127634	Sunday Supplements	288	” for when released from the official social routine ; this was the kind of “
128213	128450	127633	127634	Sunday Supplements	288	” that so frequently caused them to disappoint the hopes of anxious hostesses . Lily had an odd sense of being behind the social tapestry , on the side where the threads were knotted and the loose ends hung . For a moment she found a certain amusement in the show , and in her own share of it : the situation had an ease and unconventionality distinctly refreshing after her experience of the irony of conventions . But these flashes of amusement were but brief reactions from the long disgust of her days . Compared with the vast gilded void of Mrs. Hatch ’s existence , the life of Lily ’s former friends seemed packed with ordered activities . Even the most irresponsible pretty woman of her acquaintance had her inherited obligations , her conventional benevolences , her share in the working of the great civic machine ; and all hung together in the solidarity of these traditional functions . The performance of specific duties would have simplified Miss Bart ’s position ; but the vague attendance on Mrs. Hatch was not without its perplexities . It was not her employer who created these perplexities . Mrs. Hatch showed from the first an almost touching desire for Lily ’s approval . Far from asserting the superiority of wealth , her beautiful eyes seemed to urge the plea of inexperience : she wanted to do what was “
128453	128460	127633	127634	Sunday Supplements	288	” to be taught how to be “
128463	128647	127633	127634	Sunday Supplements	288	” The difficulty was to find any point of contact between her ideals and Lily ’s . Mrs. Hatch swam in a haze of indeterminate enthusiasms , of aspirations culled from the stage , the newspapers , the fashion journals , and a gaudy world of sport still more completely beyond her companion ’s ken . To separate from these confused conceptions those most likely to advance the lady on her way , was Lily ’s obvious duty ; but its performance was hampered by rapidly - growing doubts . Lily was in fact becoming more and more aware of a certain ambiguity in her situation . It was not that she had , in the conventional sense , any doubt of Mrs. Hatch ’s irreproachableness . The lady ’s offences were always against taste rather than conduct ; her divorce record seemed due to geographical rather than ethical conditions ; and her worst laxities were likely to proceed from a wandering and extravagant good - nature . But if Lily did not mind her detaining her manicure for luncheon , or offering the “
128651	129068	129069	129069	I	0	” a seat in Freddy Van Osburgh ’s box at the play , she was not equally at ease in regard to some less apparent lapses from convention . Ned Silverton ’s relation to Stancy seemed , for instance , closer and less clear than any natural affinities would warrant ; and both appeared united in the effort to cultivate Freddy Van Osburgh ’s growing taste for Mrs. Hatch . There was as yet nothing definable in the situation , which might well resolve itself into a huge joke on the part of the other two ; but Lily had a vague sense that the subject of their experiment was too young , too rich and too credulous . Her embarrassment was increased by the fact that Freddy seemed to regard her as cooperating with himself in the social development of Mrs. Hatch : a view that suggested , on his part , a permanent interest in the lady ’s future . There were moments when Lily found an ironic amusement in this aspect of the case . The thought of launching such a missile as Mrs. Hatch at the perfidious bosom of society was not without its charm : Miss Bart had even beguiled her leisure with visions of the fair Norma introduced for the first time to a family banquet at the Van Osburghs ’ . But the thought of being personally connected with the transaction was less agreeable ; and her momentary flashes of amusement were followed by increasing periods of doubt . The sense of these doubts was uppermost when , late one afternoon , she was surprised by a visit from Lawrence Selden . He found her alone in the wilderness of pink damask , for in Mrs. Hatch ’s world the tea - hour was not dedicated to social rites , and the lady was in the hands of her masseuse . Selden ’s entrance had caused Lily an inward start of embarrassment ; but his air of constraint had the effect of restoring her self - possession , and she took at once the tone of surprise and pleasure , wondering frankly that he should have traced her to so unlikely a place , and asking what had inspired him to make the search . Selden met this with an unusual seriousness : she had never seen him so little master of the situation , so plainly at the mercy of any obstructions she might put in his way . “
129075	129136	129069	129069	I	0	” he said ; and she could not resist observing in reply that he had kept his wishes under remarkable control . She had in truth felt his long absence as one of the chief bitternesses of the last months : his desertion had wounded sensibilities far below the surface of her pride . Selden met the challenge with directness . “
129166	129187	129156	129156	my	0	” This struck her as a clumsy evasion , and the thought gave a flash of keenness to her answer . “
129204	129209	129194	129194	you	0	” He hesitated again . “
129225	129383	129194	129194	you	0	” For a clever man it was certainly a stupid beginning ; and the idea that his awkwardness was due to the fear of her attaching a personal significance to his visit , chilled her pleasure in seeing him . Even under the most adverse conditions , that pleasure always made itself felt : she might hate him , but she had never been able to wish him out of the room . She was very near hating him now ; yet the sound of his voice , the way the light fell on his thin dark hair , the way he sat and moved and wore his clothes — she was conscious that even these trivial things were inwoven with her deepest life . In his presence a sudden stillness came upon her , and the turmoil of her spirit ceased ; but an impulse of resistance to this stealing influence now prompted her to say : “
129410	129550	129551	129551	Gerty	112	” Though she kept the even tone of light intercourse , the question was framed in a way to remind him that his good offices were unsought ; and for a moment Selden was checked by it . The situation between them was one which could have been cleared up only by a sudden explosion of feeling ; and their whole training and habit of mind were against the chances of such an explosion . Selden ’s calmness seemed rather to harden into resistance , and Miss Bart ’s into a surface of glittering irony , as they faced each other from the opposite corners of one of Mrs. Hatch ’s elephantine sofas . The sofa in question , and the apartment peopled by its monstrous mates , served at length to suggest the turn of Selden ’s reply . “
129578	129588	129567	129567	she	285	” Miss Bart received this explanation without perceptible softening . “
129600	129604	129592	129592	she	285	” she asked . “
129623	129630	129616	129616	she	285	” Selden continued with a smile : “
129654	129660	129661	129661	You	2503	” Lily answered his smile . “
129680	129681	129691	129691	You	2503	” “
129705	129706	129691	129691	You	2503	” “
129720	129758	129759	129759	You	2503	” she asked in the same light tone . Selden again glanced about Mrs. Hatch ’s drawing - room ; then he said , with a decision which he seemed to have gathered from this final inspection : “
129770	129789	129763	129763	me	0	” Lily flushed at the suddenness of the attack ; then she stiffened under it and said coldly : “
129801	129802	129763	129763	me	0	” “
129827	129918	129919	129919	I	0	” The unusual harshness of his tone might have shown her how much the words cost him ; but she was in no state to measure his feelings while her own were in a flame of revolt . To neglect her , perhaps even to avoid her , at a time when she had most need of her friends , and then suddenly and unwarrantably to break into her life with this strange assumption of authority , was to rouse in her every instinct of pride and self - defence . “
129927	129931	129919	129919	I	0	” she said , “
129957	129974	129942	129942	I	0	” Selden had risen , and was standing before her in an attitude of uncontrollable expectancy . “
129987	130002	129942	129942	I	0	” he exclaimed . Lily rose also , with a quick flash of anger . “
130017	130018	130004	130004	you	2503	” “
130033	130034	130035	130035	My	0	” “
130071	130072	130051	130051	She	285	” “
130098	130099	130100	130100	You	2503	” “
130123	130124	130112	130112	you	2503	” “
130136	130159	130130	130130	Gerty	112	” Selden acknowledged without embarrassment . He was too much in earnest now to feel any false constraint in speaking his mind . “
130168	130173	130161	130161	Gerty	112	” Miss Bart rejoined , “
130183	130184	130185	130186	Good God	165	” “
130188	130204	130185	130186	Good God	165	” Selden exclaimed , startled out of his composure by the abruptness of the statement . “
130214	130218	130185	130186	Good God	165	” Lily repeated ; “
130263	130277	130283	130283	Gerty’s	290	” Selden hesitated a moment ; then he rejoined in a quieter tone : “
130344	130345	130322	130322	Gerty	112	” “
130351	130356	130347	130347	I	0	” Miss Bart interposed . “
130374	130399	130400	130400	You	0	” She paused a moment , and as he seemed to await a farther explanation , added with a quick lift of her head : “
130411	130412	130400	130400	You	0	” “
130421	130429	130400	130400	You	0	” Selden answered , ignoring her tone ; “
130475	130479	130465	130465	he	2811	” Lily smiled . “
130483	130487	130493	130493	you	0	” she rejoined , “
130561	130628	130545	130545	your	0	” She had not been without intention in making this allusion to their memorable talk at Bellomont , and she waited with an odd tremor of the nerves to see what response it would bring ; but the result of the experiment was disappointing . Selden did not allow the allusion to deflect him from his point ; he merely said with completer fulness of emphasis : “
130680	130833	130834	130834	I	0	” In spite of the moderation of his tone , each word he spoke had the effect of confirming Lily ’s resistance . The very apprehensions he aroused hardened her against him : she had been on the alert for the note of personal sympathy , for any sign of recovered power over him ; and his attitude of sober impartiality , the absence of all response to her appeal , turned her hurt pride to blind resentment of his interference . The conviction that he had been sent by Gerty , and that , whatever straits he conceived her to be in , he would never voluntarily have come to her aid , strengthened her resolve not to admit him a hair ’s breadth farther into her confidence . However doubtful she might feel her situation to be , she would rather persist in darkness than owe her enlightenment to Selden . “
130839	130850	130852	130852	you	2515	” she said , when he had ceased to speak , “
130903	130946	130947	130947	I	0	” The smile with which she summed up her case was like a clear barrier raised against farther confidences : its brightness held him at such a distance that he had a sense of being almost out of hearing as he rejoined : “
130968	130987	131002	131002	you	2515	” Her colour rose a little at the implication , but she steeled herself with a light laugh . “
131005	131025	131002	131002	you	2515	” And as he wavered before her , still watching for a break in the impenetrable front she presented : “
131041	131047	131053	131054	Miss Bart	109	” she affirmed . Chapter 10 “
131064	131307	131053	131054	Miss Bart	109	” The tall forewoman , a pinched perpendicular figure , dropped the condemned structure of wire and net on the table at Lily ’s side , and passed on to the next figure in the line . There were twenty of them in the work - room , their fagged profiles , under exaggerated hair , bowed in the harsh north light above the utensils of their art ; for it was something more than an industry , surely , this creation of ever - varied settings for the face of fortunate womanhood . Their own faces were sallow with the unwholesomeness of hot air and sedentary toil , rather than with any actual signs of want : they were employed in a fashionable millinery establishment , and were fairly well clothed and well paid ; but the youngest among them was as dull and colourless as the middle - aged . In the whole work - room there was only one skin beneath which the blood still visibly played ; and that now burned with vexation as Miss Bart , under the lash of the forewoman ’s comment , began to strip the hat - frame of its over - lapping spangles . To Gerty Farish ’s hopeful spirit a solution appeared to have been reached when she remembered how beautifully Lily could trim hats . Instances of young lady - milliners establishing themselves under fashionable patronage , and imparting to their “
131309	131424	131426	131426	them	2518	” that indefinable touch which the professional hand can never give , had flattered Gerty ’s visions of the future , and convinced even Lily that her separation from Mrs. Norma Hatch need not reduce her to dependence on her friends . The parting had occurred a few weeks after Selden ’s visit , and would have taken place sooner had it not been for the resistance set up in Lily by his ill - starred offer of advice . The sense of being involved in a transaction she would not have cared to examine too closely had soon afterward defined itself in the light of a hint from Mr. Stancy that , if she “
131429	131649	131426	131426	them	2518	” she would have no reason to be sorry . The implication that such loyalty would meet with a direct reward had hastened her flight , and flung her back , ashamed and penitent , on the broad bosom of Gerty ’s sympathy . She did not , however , propose to lie there prone , and Gerty ’s inspiration about the hats at once revived her hopes of profitable activity . Here was , after all , something that her charming listless hands could really do ; she had no doubt of their capacity for knotting a ribbon or placing a flower to advantage . And of course only these finishing touches would be expected of her : subordinate fingers , blunt , grey , needle - pricked fingers , would prepare the shapes and stitch the linings , while she presided over the charming little front shop — a shop all white panels , mirrors , and moss - green hangings — where her finished creations , hats , wreaths , aigrettes and the rest , perched on their stands like birds just poising for flight . But at the very outset of Gerty ’s campaign this vision of the green - and - white shop had been dispelled . Other young ladies of fashion had been thus “
131653	131989	131426	131426	them	2518	” selling their hats by the mere attraction of a name and the reputed knack of tying a bow ; but these privileged beings could command a faith in their powers materially expressed by the readiness to pay their shop - rent and advance a handsome sum for current expenses . Where was Lily to find such support ? And even could it have been found , how were the ladies on whose approval she depended to be induced to give her their patronage ? Gerty learned that whatever sympathy her friend ’s case might have excited a few months since had been imperilled , if not lost , by her association with Mrs. Hatch . Once again , Lily had withdrawn from an ambiguous situation in time to save her self - respect , but too late for public vindication . Freddy Van Osburgh was not to marry Mrs. Hatch ; he had been rescued at the eleventh hour — some said by the efforts of Gus Trenor and Rosedale — and despatched to Europe with old Ned Van Alstyne ; but the risk he had run would always be ascribed to Miss Bart ’s connivance , and would somehow serve as a summing - up and corroboration of the vague general distrust of her . It was a relief to those who had hung back from her to find themselves thus justified , and they were inclined to insist a little on her connection with the Hatch case in order to show that they had been right . Gerty ’s quest , at any rate , brought up against a solid wall of resistance ; and even when Carry Fisher , momentarily penitent for her share in the Hatch affair , joined her efforts to Miss Farish ’s , they met with no better success . Gerty had tried to veil her failure in tender ambiguities ; but Carry , always the soul of candour , put the case squarely to her friend . “
132126	132675	132676	132676	I	0	” The end of it was that , after anxious enquiry and much deliberation , Mrs. Fisher and Gerty , for once oddly united in their effort to help their friend , decided on placing her in the work - room of Mme . Regina ’s renowned millinery establishment . Even this arrangement was not effected without considerable negotiation , for Mme . Regina had a strong prejudice against untrained assistance , and was induced to yield only by the fact that she owed the patronage of Mrs. Bry and Mrs. Gormer to Carry Fisher ’s influence . She had been willing from the first to employ Lily in the show - room : as a displayer of hats , a fashionable beauty might be a valuable asset . But to this suggestion Miss Bart opposed a negative which Gerty emphatically supported , while Mrs. Fisher , inwardly unconvinced , but resigned to this latest proof of Lily ’s unreason , agreed that perhaps in the end it would be more useful that she should learn the trade . To Regina ’s work - room Lily was therefore committed by her friends , and there Mrs. Fisher left her with a sigh of relief , while Gerty ’s watchfulness continued to hover over her at a distance . Lily had taken up her work early in January : it was now two months later , and she was still being rebuked for her inability to sew spangles on a hat - frame . As she returned to her work she heard a titter pass down the tables . She knew she was an object of criticism and amusement to the other work - women . They were , of course , aware of her history — the exact situation of every girl in the room was known and freely discussed by all the others — but the knowledge did not produce in them any awkward sense of class distinction : it merely explained why her untutored fingers were still blundering over the rudiments of the trade . Lily had no desire that they should recognize any social difference in her ; but she had hoped to be received as their equal , and perhaps before long to show herself their superior by a special deftness of touch , and it was humiliating to find that , after two months of drudgery , she still betrayed her lack of early training . Remote was the day when she might aspire to exercise the talents she felt confident of possessing ; only experienced workers were entrusted with the delicate art of shaping and trimming the hat , and the forewoman still held her inexorably to the routine of preparatory work . She began to rip the spangles from the frame , listening absently to the buzz of talk which rose and fell with the coming and going of Miss Haines ’s active figure . The air was closer than usual , because Miss Haines , who had a cold , had not allowed a window to be opened even during the noon recess ; and Lily ’s head was so heavy with the weight of a sleepless night that the chatter of her companions had the incoherence of a dream . “
132849	133037	132827	132827	she	2520	” On and on it flowed , a current of meaningless sound , on which , startlingly enough , a familiar name now and then floated to the surface . It was the strangest part of Lily ’s strange experience , the hearing of these names , the seeing the fragmentary and distorted image of the world she had lived in reflected in the mirror of the working - girls ’ minds . She had never before suspected the mixture of insatiable curiosity and contemptuous freedom with which she and her kind were discussed in this underworld of toilers who lived on their vanity and self - indulgence . Every girl in Mme . Regina ’s work - room knew to whom the headgear in her hands was destined , and had her opinion of its future wearer , and a definite knowledge of the latter ’s place in the social system . That Lily was a star fallen from that sky did not , after the first stir of curiosity had subsided , materially add to their interest in her . She had fallen , she had “
133041	133100	132827	132827	she	2520	” and true to the ideal of their race , they were awed only by success — by the gross tangible image of material achievement . The consciousness of her different point of view merely kept them at a little distance from her , as though she were a foreigner with whom it was an effort to talk . “
133126	133208	133123	133124	Miss Kilroy	294	” Lily looked down ruefully at her handiwork . The forewoman was right : the sewing on of the spangles was inexcusably bad . What made her so much more clumsy than usual ? Was it a growing distaste for her task , or actual physical disability ? She felt tired and confused : it was an effort to put her thoughts together . She rose and handed the hat to Miss Kilroy , who took it with a suppressed smile . “
133221	133289	133290	133290	You	2524	” she said to the forewoman . Miss Haines offered no comment . From the first she had augured ill of Mme . Regina ’s consenting to include a fashionable apprentice among her workers . In that temple of art no raw beginners were wanted , and Miss Haines would have been more than human had she not taken a certain pleasure in seeing her forebodings confirmed . “
133299	133446	133447	133448	Miss Bart	109	” she said drily . Lily slipped out last among the band of liberated work - women . She did not care to be mingled in their noisy dispersal : once in the street , she always felt an irresistible return to her old standpoint , an instinctive shrinking from all that was unpolished and promiscuous . In the days — how distant they now seemed!—when she had visited the Girls ’ Club with Gerty Farish , she had felt an enlightened interest in the working - classes ; but that was because she looked down on them from above , from the happy altitude of her grace and her beneficence . Now that she was on a level with them , the point of view was less interesting . She felt a touch on her arm , and met the penitent eye of Miss Kilroy . “
133478	133507	133469	133470	Miss Haines	291	” Lily ’s colour rose at the unexpected advance : it was a long time since real kindness had looked at her from any eyes but Gerty ’s . “
133529	133530	133525	133525	I	0	” “
133543	133549	133550	133550	You	109	” Miss Kilroy paused irresolutely . “
133564	133565	133567	133567	you	109	” “
133569	133576	133567	133567	you	109	” Lily held out her hand . “
133590	133654	133584	133584	I	0	” She looked gratefully at Miss Kilroy , but neither knew what more to say . Lily was aware that the other was on the point of offering to go home with her , but she wanted to be alone and silent — even kindness , the sort of kindness that Miss Kilroy could give , would have jarred on her just then . “
133658	134064	133656	133656	you	109	” she repeated as she turned away . She struck westward through the dreary March twilight , toward the street where her boarding - house stood . She had resolutely refused Gerty ’s offer of hospitality . Something of her mother ’s fierce shrinking from observation and sympathy was beginning to develop in her , and the promiscuity of small quarters and close intimacy seemed , on the whole , less endurable than the solitude of a hall bedroom in a house where she could come and go unremarked among other workers . For a while she had been sustained by this desire for privacy and independence ; but now , perhaps from increasing physical weariness , the lassitude brought about by hours of unwonted confinement , she was beginning to feel acutely the ugliness and discomfort of her surroundings . The day ’s task done , she dreaded to return to her narrow room , with its blotched wall - paper and shabby paint ; and she hated every step of the walk thither , through the degradation of a New York street in the last stages of decline from fashion to commerce . But what she dreaded most of all was having to pass the chemist ’s at the corner of Sixth Avenue . She had meant to take another street : she had usually done so of late . But today her steps were irresistibly drawn toward the flaring plate - glass corner ; she tried to take the lower crossing , but a laden dray crowded her back , and she struck across the street obliquely , reaching the sidewalk just opposite the chemist ’s door . Over the counter she caught the eye of the clerk who had waited on her before , and slipped the prescription into his hand . There could be no question about the prescription : it was a copy of one of Mrs. Hatch ’s , obligingly furnished by that lady ’s chemist . Lily was confident that the clerk would fill it without hesitation ; yet the nervous dread of a refusal , or even of an expression of doubt , communicated itself to her restless hands as she affected to examine the bottles of perfume stacked on the glass case before her . The clerk had read the prescription without comment ; but in the act of handing out the bottle he paused . “
134077	134098	134065	134065	You	2528	” he remarked . Lily ’s heart contracted . What did he mean by looking at her in that way ? “
134103	134112	134065	134065	You	2528	” she murmured , holding out her hand . “
134144	134360	134137	134138	the doctors	2962	” The dread lest he should question her , or keep the bottle back , choked the murmur of acquiescence in her throat ; and when at length she emerged safely from the shop she was almost dizzy with the intensity of her relief . The mere touch of the packet thrilled her tired nerves with the delicious promise of a night of sleep , and in the reaction from her momentary fear she felt as if the first fumes of drowsiness were already stealing over her . In her confusion she stumbled against a man who was hurrying down the last steps of the elevated station . He drew back , and she heard her name uttered with surprise . It was Rosedale , fur - coated , glossy and prosperous — but why did she seem to see him so far off , and as if through a mist of splintered crystals ? Before she could account for the phenomenon she found herself shaking hands with him . They had parted with scorn on her side and anger upon his ; but all trace of these emotions seemed to vanish as their hands met , and she was only aware of a confused wish that she might continue to hold fast to him . “
134376	134392	134393	134393	I	0	” he exclaimed ; and she forced her lips into a pallid smile of reassurance . “
134411	134443	134137	134138	the doctors	2962	” she faltered . That she should be asking this service of Rosedale ! He glanced at the dirty and unpropitious corner on which they stood , with the shriek of the “
134445	134459	134460	134460	We	2530	” and the tumult of trams and waggons contending hideously in their ears . “
134498	134565	134491	134493	no one there	2532	” A cup of tea in quiet , somewhere out of the noise and ugliness , seemed for the moment the one solace she could bear . A few steps brought them to the ladies ’ door of the hotel he had named , and a moment later he was seated opposite to her , and the waiter had placed the tea - tray between them . “
134606	134844	134847	134848	Miss Lily	109	” Lily smiled faintly at the injunction to take her tea strong . It was the temptation she was always struggling to resist . Her craving for the keen stimulant was forever conflicting with that other craving for sleep — the midnight craving which only the little phial in her hand could still . But today , at any rate , the tea could hardly be too strong : she counted on it to pour warmth and resolution into her empty veins . As she leaned back before him , her lids drooping in utter lassitude , though the first warm draught already tinged her face with returning life , Rosedale was seized afresh by the poignant surprise of her beauty . The dark pencilling of fatigue under her eyes , the morbid blue - veined pallor of the temples , brought out the brightness of her hair and lips , as though all her ebbing vitality were centred there . Against the dull chocolate - coloured background of the restaurant , the purity of her head stood out as it had never done in the most brightly lit ball - room . He looked at her with a startled uncomfortable feeling , as though her beauty were a forgotten enemy that had lain in ambush and now sprang out on him unawares . To clear the air he tried to take an easy tone with her . “
134869	134965	134859	134859	I	0	” As he spoke , he was checked by an embarrassing sense of the complications to which this might lead . Though he had not seen her he had heard of her ; he knew of her connection with Mrs. Hatch , and of the talk resulting from it . Mrs. Hatch ’s MILIEU was one which he had once assiduously frequented , and now as devoutly shunned . Lily , to whom the tea had restored her usual clearness of mind , saw what was in his thoughts and said with a slight smile : “
134984	134991	134992	134992	You	0	” He stared in genuine wonder . “
135007	135008	135004	135004	you	0	” “
135021	135036	135012	135013	a milliner	2536	” she hastily qualified the statement . Rosedale suppressed a low whistle of surprise . “
135048	135049	135046	135046	you	0	” “
135062	135063	135053	135053	I	0	” “
135076	135077	135073	135074	Norma Hatch	285	” “
135089	135090	135080	135080	I	0	” “
135099	135132	135080	135080	I	0	” He leaned forward to refill her cup . Lily guessed the possibilities of embarrassment which the topic held for him , and raising her eyes to his , she said suddenly : “
135140	135177	135133	135133	I	0	” Rosedale continued to fumble awkwardly with the tea - pot , and she felt sure that he had heard what had been said of her . But what was there that Rosedale did not hear ? “
135185	135195	135133	135133	I	0	” he enquired , with an attempt at lightness . “
135207	135258	135133	135133	I	0	” Lily rested one arm on the edge of the table , and sat looking at him more intently than she had ever looked before . An uncontrollable impulse was urging her to put her case to this man , from whose curiosity she had always so fiercely defended herself . “
135283	135299	135274	135274	she	285	” Rosedale looked faintly puzzled , and she remembered that allusiveness was lost on him . “
135309	135373	135374	135374	I	0	” he agreed , so suffused and immersed in the light of her full gaze that he found himself being drawn into strange depths of intimacy . He who had had to subsist on mere fugitive glances , looks winged in flight and swiftly lost under covert , now found her eyes settling on him with a brooding intensity that fairly dazzled him . “
135377	135381	135374	135374	I	0	” Lily continued , “
135430	135431	135417	135417	I	0	” “
135437	135461	135462	135462	Freddy	273	” Rosedale brushed aside the topic with an air of its unimportance which gave a sense of the immense perspective he had acquired . “
135484	135565	135481	135481	your	0	” Lily coloured slightly : she could not conceal from herself that the words gave her pleasure . She would have liked to sit there , drinking more tea , and continuing to talk of herself to Rosedale . But the old habit of observing the conventions reminded her that it was time to bring their colloquy to an end , and she made a faint motion to push back her chair . Rosedale stopped her with a protesting gesture . “
135596	135643	135589	135589	you	0	” He broke off , conscious of going farther than he had meant . She saw the struggle and understood it ; understood also the nature of the spell to which he yielded as , with his eyes on her face , he began again abruptly : “
135663	135664	135648	135648	you	0	” “
135678	135679	135683	135683	YOU	0	” “
135716	135717	135708	135708	you	0	” “
135736	135737	135713	135713	her	3262	” “
135755	135762	135708	135708	you	0	” She shook her head gravely . “
135771	135772	135766	135766	I	0	” “
135781	135782	135766	135766	I	0	” “
135786	135802	135803	135803	I	0	” She paused , and then continued abruptly , with her eyes on his face : “
135821	135841	135842	135842	He	161	” She waited , and Rosedale , congested with embarrassment , muttered that he remembered something of the kind . “
135849	135861	135842	135842	He	161	” Lily pursued , in the same tone of eager communicativeness . “
135978	136137	135970	135970	I	0	” She made the statement clearly , deliberately , with pauses between the sentences , so that each should have time to sink deeply into her hearer ’s mind . She had a passionate desire that some one should know the truth about this transaction , and also that the rumour of her intention to repay the money should reach Judy Trenor ’s ears . And it had suddenly occurred to her that Rosedale , who had surprised Trenor ’s confidence , was the fitting person to receive and transmit her version of the facts . She had even felt a momentary exhilaration at the thought of thus relieving herself of her detested secret ; but the sensation gradually faded in the telling , and as she ended her pallor was suffused with a deep blush of misery . Rosedale continued to stare at her in wonder ; but the wonder took the turn she had least expected . “
136154	136191	135970	135970	I	0	” He put it to her as if she had not grasped the consequences of her act ; as if her incorrigible ignorance of business were about to precipitate her into a fresh act of folly . “
136196	136225	135970	135970	I	0	” she calmly agreed . He sat silent , his thick hands clasped on the table , his little puzzled eyes exploring the recesses of the deserted restaurant . “
136233	136248	135970	135970	I	0	” he exclaimed abruptly . Lily rose from her seat with a deprecating laugh . “
136259	136286	136287	136288	Miss Lily	109	” she asserted , gathering together the ends of her feather scarf . Rosedale remained seated , too intent on his thoughts to notice her movement . “
136301	136307	136309	136309	you	109	” broke from him disconnectedly . “
136311	136318	136309	136309	you	109	” She held out her hand . “
136335	136369	136328	136328	I	0	” Her gesture seemed to show a definite intention of dismissal , but her companion had tossed a bill to the waiter , and was slipping his short arms into his expensive overcoat . “
136384	136479	136374	136374	you’ve	109	” he said . Lily uttered no protest , and when he had paused to make sure of his change they emerged from the hotel and crossed Sixth Avenue again . As she led the way westward past a long line of areas which , through the distortion of their paintless rails , revealed with increasing candour the DISJECTA MEMBRA of bygone dinners , Lily felt that Rosedale was taking contemptuous note of the neighbourhood ; and before the doorstep at which she finally paused he looked up with an air of incredulous disgust . “
136497	136498	136486	136487	Some one	2889	” “
136515	136556	136557	136557	You	0	” He continued to scan the blistered brown stone front , the windows draped with discoloured lace , and the Pompeian decoration of the muddy vestibule ; then he looked back at her face and said with a visible effort : “
136568	136588	136557	136557	You	0	” She smiled , recognizing the heroism of the offer to the point of being frankly touched by it . “
136598	136918	136592	136592	I	0	” she made answer , in the first sincere words she had ever spoken to him . * * * * * That evening in her own room Miss Bart — who had fled early from the heavy fumes of the basement dinner - table — sat musing upon the impulse which had led her to unbosom herself to Rosedale . Beneath it she discovered an increasing sense of loneliness — a dread of returning to the solitude of her room , while she could be anywhere else , or in any company but her own . Circumstances , of late , had combined to cut her off more and more from her few remaining friends . On Carry Fisher ’s part the withdrawal was perhaps not quite involuntary . Having made her final effort on Lily ’s behalf , and landed her safely in Mme . Regina ’s work - room , Mrs. Fisher seemed disposed to rest from her labours ; and Lily , understanding the reason , could not condemn her . Carry had in fact come dangerously near to being involved in the episode of Mrs. Norma Hatch , and it had taken some verbal ingenuity to extricate herself . She frankly owned to having brought Lily and Mrs. Hatch together , but then she did not know Mrs. Hatch — she had expressly warned Lily that she did not know Mrs. Hatch — and besides , she was not Lily ’s keeper , and really the girl was old enough to take care of herself . Carry did not put her own case so brutally , but she allowed it to be thus put for her by her latest bosom friend , Mrs. Jack Stepney : Mrs. Stepney , trembling over the narrowness of her only brother ’s escape , but eager to vindicate Mrs. Fisher , at whose house she could count on the “
136921	138097	136592	136592	I	0	” which had become a necessity to her since marriage had emancipated her from the Van Osburgh point of view . Lily understood the situation and could make allowances for it . Carry had been a good friend to her in difficult days , and perhaps only a friendship like Gerty ’s could be proof against such an increasing strain . Gerty ’s friendship did indeed hold fast ; yet Lily was beginning to avoid her also . For she could not go to Gerty ’s without risk of meeting Selden ; and to meet him now would be pure pain . It was pain enough even to think of him , whether she considered him in the distinctness of her waking thoughts , or felt the obsession of his presence through the blur of her tormented nights . That was one of the reasons why she had turned again to Mrs. Hatch ’s prescription . In the uneasy snatches of her natural dreams he came to her sometimes in the old guise of fellowship and tenderness ; and she would rise from the sweet delusion mocked and emptied of her courage . But in the sleep which the phial procured she sank far below such half - waking visitations , sank into depths of dreamless annihilation from which she woke each morning with an obliterated past . Gradually , to be sure , the stress of the old thoughts would return ; but at least they did not importune her waking hour . The drug gave her a momentary illusion of complete renewal , from which she drew strength to take up her daily work . The strength was more and more needed as the perplexities of her future increased . She knew that to Gerty and Mrs. Fisher she was only passing through a temporary period of probation , since they believed that the apprenticeship she was serving at Mme . Regina ’s would enable her , when Mrs. Peniston ’s legacy was paid , to realize the vision of the green - and - white shop with the fuller competence acquired by her preliminary training . But to Lily herself , aware that the legacy could not be put to such a use , the preliminary training seemed a wasted effort . She understood clearly enough that , even if she could ever learn to compete with hands formed from childhood for their special work , the small pay she received would not be a sufficient addition to her income to compensate her for such drudgery . And the realization of this fact brought her recurringly face to face with the temptation to use the legacy in establishing her business . Once installed , and in command of her own work - women , she believed she had sufficient tact and ability to attract a fashionable CLIENTELE ; and if the business succeeded she could gradually lay aside money enough to discharge her debt to Trenor . But the task might take years to accomplish , even if she continued to stint herself to the utmost ; and meanwhile her pride would be crushed under the weight of an intolerable obligation . These were her superficial considerations ; but under them lurked the secret dread that the obligation might not always remain intolerable . She knew she could not count on her continuity of purpose , and what really frightened her was the thought that she might gradually accommodate herself to remaining indefinitely in Trenor ’s debt , as she had accommodated herself to the part allotted her on the Sabrina , and as she had so nearly drifted into acquiescing with Stancy ’s scheme for the advancement of Mrs. Hatch . Her danger lay , as she knew , in her old incurable dread of discomfort and poverty ; in the fear of that mounting tide of dinginess against which her mother had so passionately warned her . And now a new vista of peril opened before her . She understood that Rosedale was ready to lend her money ; and the longing to take advantage of his offer began to haunt her insidiously . It was of course impossible to accept a loan from Rosedale ; but proximate possibilities hovered temptingly before her . She was quite sure that he would come and see her again , and almost sure that , if he did , she could bring him to the point of offering to marry her on the terms she had previously rejected . Would she still reject them if they were offered ? More and more , with every fresh mischance befalling her , did the pursuing furies seem to take the shape of Bertha Dorset ; and close at hand , safely locked among her papers , lay the means of ending their pursuit . The temptation , which her scorn of Rosedale had once enabled her to reject , now insistently returned upon her ; and how much strength was left her to oppose it ? What little there was must at any rate be husbanded to the utmost ; she could not trust herself again to the perils of a sleepless night . Through the long hours of silence the dark spirit of fatigue and loneliness crouched upon her breast , leaving her so drained of bodily strength that her morning thoughts swam in a haze of weakness . The only hope of renewal lay in the little bottle at her bed - side ; and how much longer that hope would last she dared not conjecture . Chapter 11 Lily , lingering for a moment on the corner , looked out on the afternoon spectacle of Fifth Avenue . It was a day in late April , and the sweetness of spring was in the air . It mitigated the ugliness of the long crowded thoroughfare , blurred the gaunt roof - lines , threw a mauve veil over the discouraging perspective of the side streets , and gave a touch of poetry to the delicate haze of green that marked the entrance to the Park . As Lily stood there , she recognized several familiar faces in the passing carriages . The season was over , and its ruling forces had disbanded ; but a few still lingered , delaying their departure for Europe , or passing through town on their return from the South . Among them was Mrs. Van Osburgh , swaying majestically in her C - spring barouche , with Mrs. Percy Gryce at her side , and the new heir to the Gryce millions enthroned before them on his nurse ’s knees . They were succeeded by Mrs. Hatch ’s electric victoria , in which that lady reclined in the lonely splendour of a spring toilet obviously designed for company ; and a moment or two later came Judy Trenor , accompanied by Lady Skiddaw , who had come over for her annual tarpon fishing and a dip into “
138101	138680	136592	136592	I	0	” This fleeting glimpse of her past served to emphasize the sense of aimlessness with which Lily at length turned toward home . She had nothing to do for the rest of the day , nor for the days to come ; for the season was over in millinery as well as in society , and a week earlier Mme . Regina had notified her that her services were no longer required . Mme . Regina always reduced her staff on the first of May , and Miss Bart ’s attendance had of late been so irregular — she had so often been unwell , and had done so little work when she came — that it was only as a favour that her dismissal had hitherto been deferred . Lily did not question the justice of the decision . She was conscious of having been forgetful , awkward and slow to learn . It was bitter to acknowledge her inferiority even to herself , but the fact had been brought home to her that as a bread - winner she could never compete with professional ability . Since she had been brought up to be ornamental , she could hardly blame herself for failing to serve any practical purpose ; but the discovery put an end to her consoling sense of universal efficiency . As she turned homeward her thoughts shrank in anticipation from the fact that there would be nothing to get up for the next morning . The luxury of lying late in bed was a pleasure belonging to the life of ease ; it had no part in the utilitarian existence of the boarding - house . She liked to leave her room early , and to return to it as late as possible ; and she was walking slowly now in order to postpone the detested approach to her doorstep . But the doorstep , as she drew near it , acquired a sudden interest from the fact that it was occupied — and indeed filled — by the conspicuous figure of Mr. Rosedale , whose presence seemed to take on an added amplitude from the meanness of his surroundings . The sight stirred Lily with an irresistible sense of triumph . Rosedale , a day or two after their chance meeting , had called to enquire if she had recovered from her indisposition ; but since then she had not seen or heard from him , and his absence seemed to betoken a struggle to keep away , to let her pass once more out of his life . If this were the case , his return showed that the struggle had been unsuccessful , for Lily knew he was not the man to waste his time in an ineffectual sentimental dalliance . He was too busy , too practical , and above all too much preoccupied with his own advancement , to indulge in such unprofitable asides . In the peacock - blue parlour , with its bunches of dried pampas grass , and discoloured steel engravings of sentimental episodes , he looked about him with unconcealed disgust , laying his hat distrustfully on the dusty console adorned with a Rogers statuette . Lily sat down on one of the plush and rosewood sofas , and he deposited himself in a rocking - chair draped with a starched antimacassar which scraped unpleasantly against the pink fold of skin above his collar . “
138692	138702	138684	138684	you	0	” he exclaimed . Lily smiled at his tone . “
138733	138734	138745	138745	I	0	” “
138755	138756	138745	138745	I	0	” “
138775	138776	138760	138760	I	0	” “
138805	138830	138760	138760	I	0	” He brought out his sentences in short violent jerks , as though they were forced up from a deep inner crater of indignation . “
138840	138873	138760	138760	I	0	” he repeated , his eyes fixed on the long vista of the room reflected in the blotched glass between the windows . Lily continued to meet his expostulations with a smile . “
138888	138892	138882	138882	myself	0	” she began . “
138922	138978	138914	138914	I	0	” She had in truth never seen him so shaken out of his usual glibness ; and there was something almost moving to her in his inarticulate struggle with his emotions . He rose with a start which left the rocking - chair quivering on its beam ends , and placed himself squarely before her . “
139095	139118	139080	139080	you	0	” A blush of surprise rose to Lily ’s pale face , but before she could interrupt him he had continued eagerly : “
139183	139212	139176	139176	you	0	” Lily ’s blush deepened to a glow in which humiliation and gratitude were mingled ; and both sentiments revealed themselves in the unexpected gentleness of her reply . “
139240	139260	139267	139267	your	0	” Then , realizing that this answer contained a germ of injustice , she added , even more kindly : “
139309	139599	139601	139601	you	2557	” Rosedale received this statement in silence : he seemed to feel the note of finality in her voice , yet to be unable to accept it as closing the question between them . In the silence Lily had a clear perception of what was passing through his mind . Whatever perplexity he felt as to the inexorableness of her course — however little he penetrated its motive — she saw that it unmistakably tended to strengthen her hold over him . It was as though the sense in her of unexplained scruples and resistances had the same attraction as the delicacy of feature , the fastidiousness of manner , which gave her an external rarity , an air of being impossible to match . As he advanced in social experience this uniqueness had acquired a greater value for him , as though he were a collector who had learned to distinguish minor differences of design and quality in some long - coveted object . Lily , perceiving all this , understood that he would marry her at once , on the sole condition of a reconciliation with Mrs. Dorset ; and the temptation was the less easy to put aside because , little by little , circumstances were breaking down her dislike for Rosedale . The dislike , indeed , still subsisted ; but it was penetrated here and there by the perception of mitigating qualities in him : of a certain gross kindliness , a rather helpless fidelity of sentiment , which seemed to be struggling through the hard surface of his material ambitions . Reading his dismissal in her eyes , he held out his hand with a gesture which conveyed something of this inarticulate conflict . “
139628	141801	139616	139616	I’d	0	” he declared ; and it touched her oddly to see that his new passion had not altered his old standard of values . * * * * * Lily took no sleeping - drops that night . She lay awake viewing her situation in the crude light which Rosedale ’s visit had shed on it . In fending off the offer he was so plainly ready to renew , had she not sacrificed to one of those abstract notions of honour that might be called the conventionalities of the moral life ? What debt did she owe to a social order which had condemned and banished her without trial ? She had never been heard in her own defence ; she was innocent of the charge on which she had been found guilty ; and the irregularity of her conviction might seem to justify the use of methods as irregular in recovering her lost rights . Bertha Dorset , to save herself , had not scrupled to ruin her by an open falsehood ; why should she hesitate to make private use of the facts that chance had put in her way ? After all , half the opprobrium of such an act lies in the name attached to it . Call it blackmail and it becomes unthinkable ; but explain that it injures no one , and that the rights regained by it were unjustly forfeited , and he must be a formalist indeed who can find no plea in its defence . The arguments pleading for it with Lily were the old unanswerable ones of the personal situation : the sense of injury , the sense of failure , the passionate craving for a fair chance against the selfish despotism of society . She had learned by experience that she had neither the aptitude nor the moral constancy to remake her life on new lines ; to become a worker among workers , and let the world of luxury and pleasure sweep by her unregarded . She could not hold herself much to blame for this ineffectiveness , and she was perhaps less to blame than she believed . Inherited tendencies had combined with early training to make her the highly specialized product she was : an organism as helpless out of its narrow range as the sea - anemone torn from the rock . She had been fashioned to adorn and delight ; to what other end does nature round the rose - leaf and paint the humming - bird ’s breast ? And was it her fault that the purely decorative mission is less easily and harmoniously fulfilled among social beings than in the world of nature ? That it is apt to be hampered by material necessities or complicated by moral scruples ? These last were the two antagonistic forces which fought out their battle in her breast during the long watches of the night ; and when she rose the next morning she hardly knew where the victory lay . She was exhausted by the reaction of a night without sleep , coming after many nights of rest artificially obtained ; and in the distorting light of fatigue the future stretched out before her grey , interminable and desolate . She lay late in bed , refusing the coffee and fried eggs which the friendly Irish servant thrust through her door , and hating the intimate domestic noises of the house and the cries and rumblings of the street . Her week of idleness had brought home to her with exaggerated force these small aggravations of the boarding - house world , and she yearned for that other luxurious world , whose machinery is so carefully concealed that one scene flows into another without perceptible agency . At length she rose and dressed . Since she had left Mme . Regina ’s she had spent her days in the streets , partly to escape from the uncongenial promiscuities of the boarding - house , and partly in the hope that physical fatigue would help her to sleep . But once out of the house , she could not decide where to go ; for she had avoided Gerty since her dismissal from the milliner ’s , and she was not sure of a welcome anywhere else . The morning was in harsh contrast to the previous day . A cold grey sky threatened rain , and a high wind drove the dust in wild spirals up and down the streets . Lily walked up Fifth Avenue toward the Park , hoping to find a sheltered nook where she might sit ; but the wind chilled her , and after an hour ’s wandering under the tossing boughs she yielded to her increasing weariness , and took refuge in a little restaurant in Fifty - ninth Street . She was not hungry , and had meant to go without luncheon ; but she was too tired to return home , and the long perspective of white tables showed alluringly through the windows . The room was full of women and girls , all too much engaged in the rapid absorption of tea and pie to remark her entrance . A hum of shrill voices reverberated against the low ceiling , leaving Lily shut out in a little circle of silence . She felt a sudden pang of profound loneliness . She had lost the sense of time , and it seemed to her as though she had not spoken to any one for days . Her eyes sought the faces about her , craving a responsive glance , some sign of an intuition of her trouble . But the sallow preoccupied women , with their bags and note - books and rolls of music , were all engrossed in their own affairs , and even those who sat by themselves were busy running over proof - sheets or devouring magazines between their hurried gulps of tea . Lily alone was stranded in a great waste of disoccupation . She drank several cups of the tea which was served with her portion of stewed oysters , and her brain felt clearer and livelier when she emerged once more into the street . She realized now that , as she sat in the restaurant , she had unconsciously arrived at a final decision . The discovery gave her an immediate illusion of activity : it was exhilarating to think that she had actually a reason for hurrying home . To prolong her enjoyment of the sensation she decided to walk ; but the distance was so great that she found herself glancing nervously at the clocks on the way . One of the surprises of her unoccupied state was the discovery that time , when it is left to itself and no definite demands are made on it , can not be trusted to move at any recognized pace . Usually it loiters ; but just when one has come to count upon its slowness , it may suddenly break into a wild irrational gallop . She found , however , on reaching home , that the hour was still early enough for her to sit down and rest a few minutes before putting her plan into execution . The delay did not perceptibly weaken her resolve . She was frightened and yet stimulated by the reserved force of resolution which she felt within herself : she saw it was going to be easier , a great deal easier , than she had imagined . At five o’clock she rose , unlocked her trunk , and took out a sealed packet which she slipped into the bosom of her dress . Even the contact with the packet did not shake her nerves as she had half - expected it would . She seemed encased in a strong armour of indifference , as though the vigorous exertion of her will had finally benumbed her finer sensibilities . She dressed herself once more for the street , locked her door and went out . When she emerged on the pavement , the day was still high , but a threat of rain darkened the sky and cold gusts shook the signs projecting from the basement shops along the street . She reached Fifth Avenue and began to walk slowly northward . She was sufficiently familiar with Mrs. Dorset ’s habits to know that she could always be found at home after five . She might not , indeed , be accessible to visitors , especially to a visitor so unwelcome , and against whom it was quite possible that she had guarded herself by special orders ; but Lily had written a note which she meant to send up with her name , and which she thought would secure her admission . She had allowed herself time to walk to Mrs. Dorset ’s , thinking that the quick movement through the cold evening air would help to steady her nerves ; but she really felt no need of being tranquillized . Her survey of the situation remained calm and unwavering . As she reached Fiftieth Street the clouds broke abruptly , and a rush of cold rain slanted into her face . She had no umbrella and the moisture quickly penetrated her thin spring dress . She was still half a mile from her destination , and she decided to walk across to Madison Avenue and take the electric car . As she turned into the side street , a vague memory stirred in her . The row of budding trees , the new brick and limestone house - fronts , the Georgian flat - house with flower - boxes on its balconies , were merged together into the setting of a familiar scene . It was down this street that she had walked with Selden , that September day two years ago ; a few yards ahead was the doorway they had entered together . The recollection loosened a throng of benumbed sensations — longings , regrets , imaginings , the throbbing brood of the only spring her heart had ever known . It was strange to find herself passing his house on such an errand . She seemed suddenly to see her action as he would see it — and the fact of his own connection with it , the fact that , to attain her end , she must trade on his name , and profit by a secret of his past , chilled her blood with shame . What a long way she had travelled since the day of their first talk together ! Even then her feet had been set in the path she was now following — even then she had resisted the hand he had held out . All her resentment of his fancied coldness was swept away in this overwhelming rush of recollection . Twice he had been ready to help her — to help her by loving her , as he had said — and if , the third time , he had seemed to fail her , whom but herself could she accuse ? ... Well , that part of her life was over ; she did not know why her thoughts still clung to it . But the sudden longing to see him remained ; it grew to hunger as she paused on the pavement opposite his door . The street was dark and empty , swept by the rain . She had a vision of his quiet room , of the bookshelves , and the fire on the hearth . She looked up and saw a light in his window ; then she crossed the street and entered the house . Chapter 12 The library looked as she had pictured it . The green - shaded lamps made tranquil circles of light in the gathering dusk , a little fire flickered on the hearth , and Selden ’s easy - chair , which stood near it , had been pushed aside when he rose to admit her . He had checked his first movement of surprise , and stood silent , waiting for her to speak , while she paused a moment on the threshold , assailed by a rush of memories . The scene was unchanged . She recognized the row of shelves from which he had taken down his La Bruyere , and the worn arm of the chair he had leaned against while she examined the precious volume . But then the wide September light had filled the room , making it seem a part of the outer world : now the shaded lamps and the warm hearth , detaching it from the gathering darkness of the street , gave it a sweeter touch of intimacy . Becoming gradually aware of the surprise under Selden ’s silence , Lily turned to him and said simply : “
141830	141885	141819	141819	I	0	” The words rose to her lips spontaneously . Even on her way up the stairs , she had not thought of preparing a pretext for her visit , but she now felt an intense longing to dispel the cloud of misunderstanding that hung between them . Selden returned her look with a smile . “
141923	141924	141918	141918	I	0	” “
141935	141947	141927	141927	you	2559	” broke from her with a flash of her old irony . “
141957	141964	141927	141927	you	2559	” he corrected good - humouredly . “
142001	142044	142045	142045	You	2559	” While he spoke she had moved slowly to the middle of the room , and paused near his writing - table , where the lamp , striking upward , cast exaggerated shadows on the pallor of her delicately - hollowed face . “
142053	142067	142045	142045	You	2559	” he repeated gently . She did not seem to hear the request . “
142084	142094	142074	142074	I	0	” she said , as though continuing her confession . “
142102	142113	142099	142099	I	0	” he assented , with a rising tinge of embarrassment . “
142171	142172	142168	142168	you	2559	” “
142197	142281	142168	142168	you	2559	” His light tone , in which , had her nerves been steadier , she would have recognized the mere effort to bridge over an awkward moment , jarred on her passionate desire to be understood . In her strange state of extra - lucidity , which gave her the sense of being already at the heart of the situation , it seemed incredible that any one should think it necessary to linger in the conventional outskirts of word - play and evasion . “
142292	142332	142287	142287	I	0	” she insisted . But the power of expression failed her suddenly ; she felt a tremor in her throat , and two tears gathered and fell slowly from her eyes . Selden moved forward and took her hand . “
142351	142372	142346	142346	me	0	” He drew her to the arm - chair near the fire , and placed a cushion behind her shoulders . “
142397	142437	142438	142438	You	2559	” She shook her head , and two more tears ran over . But she did not weep easily , and the long habit of self - control reasserted itself , though she was still too tremulous to speak . “
142451	142526	142440	142440	I	0	” Selden continued , speaking as though she were a troubled child . His words recalled the vision of that other afternoon when they had sat together over his tea - table and talked jestingly of her future . There were moments when that day seemed more remote than any other event in her life ; and yet she could always relive it in its minutest detail . She made a gesture of refusal . “
142548	142759	142541	142541	I	0	” she added confusedly . Selden continued to stand near her , leaning against the mantelpiece . The tinge of constraint was beginning to be more distinctly perceptible under the friendly ease of his manner . Her self - absorption had not allowed her to perceive it at first ; but now that her consciousness was once more putting forth its eager feelers , she saw that her presence was becoming an embarrassment to him . Such a situation can be saved only by an immediate outrush of feeling ; and on Selden ’s side the determining impulse was still lacking . The discovery did not disturb Lily as it might once have done . She had passed beyond the phase of well - bred reciprocity , in which every demonstration must be scrupulously proportioned to the emotion it elicits , and generosity of feeling is the only ostentation condemned . But the sense of loneliness returned with redoubled force as she saw herself forever shut out from Selden ’s inmost self . She had come to him with no definite purpose ; the mere longing to see him had directed her ; but the secret hope she had carried with her suddenly revealed itself in its death - pang . “
142764	142777	142760	142760	I	0	” she repeated , making a motion to rise from her chair . “
142846	142929	142823	142823	they	2562	” Strive as she would to put some order in her thoughts , the words would not come more clearly ; yet she felt that she could not leave him without trying to make him understand that she had saved herself whole from the seeming ruin of her life . A change had come over Selden ’s face as she spoke . Its guarded look had yielded to an expression still untinged by personal emotion , but full of a gentle understanding . “
142992	142993	142980	142980	you	2564	” “
143031	143099	143104	143104	you	2564	” She had risen and stood before him , once more completely mastered by the inner urgency of the moment . The consciousness of his half - divined reluctance had vanished . Whether he wished it or not , he must see her wholly for once before they parted . Her voice had gathered strength , and she looked him gravely in the eyes as she continued . “
143325	143385	143386	143386	I	0	” She broke off suddenly . Her tears had risen again , and in drawing out her handkerchief her fingers touched the packet in the folds of her dress . A wave of colour suffused her , and the words died on her lips . Then she lifted her eyes to his and went on in an altered voice . “
143492	143568	143569	143569	You	2576	” Her lips wavered into a smile — she had been distracted by the whimsical remembrance of the confidences she had made to him , two years earlier , in that very room . Then she had been planning to marry Percy Gryce — what was it she was planning now ? The blood had risen strongly under Selden ’s dark skin , but his emotion showed itself only in an added seriousness of manner . “
143582	143639	143640	143640	You	0	” he said abruptly . Lily ’s eyes did not falter , but a look of wonder , of puzzled self - interrogation , formed itself slowly in their depths . In the light of his question , she had paused to ask herself if her decision had really been taken when she entered the room . “
143655	143663	143640	143640	You	0	” she said with a faint smile . “
143672	143673	143665	143665	you	0	” “
143695	143713	143689	143689	I	0	” She paused again , trying to transmit to her voice the steadiness of her recovered smile . “
143818	143833	143792	143792	I	0	” She went toward him , and put out her hand , still smiling . “
143842	143869	143870	143870	Lily	109	” she asked . He caught her hand , and she felt in his the vibration of feeling that had not yet risen to his lips . “
143877	143887	143873	143873	I	0	” he exclaimed . She looked at him gently . “
143952	144143	144144	144144	Lily	109	” She laid her other hand on his , and they looked at each other with a kind of solemnity , as though they stood in the presence of death . Something in truth lay dead between them — the love she had killed in him and could no longer call to life . But something lived between them also , and leaped up in her like an imperishable flame : it was the love his love had kindled , the passion of her soul for his . In its light everything else dwindled and fell away from her . She understood now that she could not go forth and leave her old self with him : that self must indeed live on in his presence , but it must still continue to be hers . Selden had retained her hand , and continued to scrutinize her with a strange sense of foreboding . The external aspect of the situation had vanished for him as completely as for her : he felt it only as one of those rare moments which lift the veil from their faces as they pass . “
144146	144154	144144	144144	Lily	109	” he said in a low voice , “
144196	144206	144187	144187	You	109	” She met his eyes with an illumined look . “
144209	144213	144187	144187	You	109	” she said . “
144234	144235	144241	144241	you	0	” “
144250	144261	144241	144241	you	0	” She turned away quietly and walked toward the hearth . “
144287	144487	144278	144278	you	0	” She knelt on the hearth - rug , stretching her hands to the embers . Puzzled by the sudden change in her tone , he mechanically gathered a handful of wood from the basket and tossed it on the fire . As he did so , he noticed how thin her hands looked against the rising light of the flames . He saw too , under the loose lines of her dress , how the curves of her figure had shrunk to angularity ; he remembered long afterward how the red play of the flame sharpened the depression of her nostrils , and intensified the blackness of the shadows which struck up from her cheekbones to her eyes . She knelt there for a few moments in silence ; a silence which he dared not break . When she rose he fancied that he saw her draw something from her dress and drop it into the fire ; but he hardly noticed the gesture at the time . His faculties seemed tranced , and he was still groping for the word to break the spell . She went up to him and laid her hands on his shoulders . “
144490	145067	144278	144278	you	0	” she said , and as he bent over her she touched his forehead with her lips . Chapter 13 The street - lamps were lit , but the rain had ceased , and there was a momentary revival of light in the upper sky . Lily walked on unconscious of her surroundings . She was still treading the buoyant ether which emanates from the high moments of life . But gradually it shrank away from her and she felt the dull pavement beneath her feet . The sense of weariness returned with accumulated force , and for a moment she felt that she could walk no farther . She had reached the corner of Forty - first Street and Fifth Avenue , and she remembered that in Bryant Park there were seats where she might rest . That melancholy pleasure - ground was almost deserted when she entered it , and she sank down on an empty bench in the glare of an electric street - lamp . The warmth of the fire had passed out of her veins , and she told herself that she must not sit long in the penetrating dampness which struck up from the wet asphalt . But her will - power seemed to have spent itself in a last great effort , and she was lost in the blank reaction which follows on an unwonted expenditure of energy . And besides , what was there to go home to ? Nothing but the silence of her cheerless room — that silence of the night which may be more racking to tired nerves than the most discordant noises : that , and the bottle of chloral by her bed . The thought of the chloral was the only spot of light in the dark prospect : she could feel its lulling influence stealing over her already . But she was troubled by the thought that it was losing its power — she dared not go back to it too soon . Of late the sleep it had brought her had been more broken and less profound ; there had been nights when she was perpetually floating up through it to consciousness . What if the effect of the drug should gradually fail , as all narcotics were said to fail ? She remembered the chemist ’s warning against increasing the dose ; and she had heard before of the capricious and incalculable action of the drug . Her dread of returning to a sleepless night was so great that she lingered on , hoping that excessive weariness would reinforce the waning power of the chloral . Night had now closed in , and the roar of traffic in Forty - second Street was dying out . As complete darkness fell on the square the lingering occupants of the benches rose and dispersed ; but now and then a stray figure , hurrying homeward , struck across the path where Lily sat , looming black for a moment in the white circle of electric light . One or two of these passers - by slackened their pace to glance curiously at her lonely figure ; but she was hardly conscious of their scrutiny . Suddenly , however , she became aware that one of the passing shadows remained stationary between her line of vision and the gleaming asphalt ; and raising her eyes she saw a young woman bending over her . “
145080	145143	145077	145078	Miss Bart	109	” a half - familiar voice exclaimed . Lily looked up . The speaker was a poorly - dressed young woman with a bundle under her arm . Her face had the air of unwholesome refinement which ill - health and over - work may produce , but its common prettiness was redeemed by the strong and generous curve of the lips . “
145150	145161	145144	145144	You	0	” she continued , brightening with the pleasure of recognition , “
145239	145369	145232	145232	you	0	” Yes : Lily was beginning to remember . The episode of Nettie Crane ’s timely rescue from disease had been one of the most satisfying incidents of her connection with Gerty ’s charitable work . She had furnished the girl with the means to go to a sanatorium in the mountains : it struck her now with a peculiar irony that the money she had used had been Gus Trenor ’s . She tried to reply , to assure the speaker that she had not forgotten ; but her voice failed in the effort , and she felt herself sinking under a great wave of physical weakness . Nettie Struther , with a startled exclamation , sat down and slipped a shabbily - clad arm behind her back . “
145390	145410	145411	145411	I	0	” A faint glow of returning strength seemed to pass into Lily from the pressure of the supporting arm . “
145420	145449	145450	145450	I	0	” she found voice to say in a moment ; and then , as she met the timid appeal of her companion ’s eyes , she added involuntarily : “
145459	145460	145461	145461	YOU	109	” “
145560	145565	145548	145548	you	109	” she broke off . “
145575	145677	145570	145570	I	0	” Lily murmured , rising . Her eyes rested wonderingly on the thin shabby figure at her side . She had known Nettie Crane as one of the discouraged victims of over - work and anaemic parentage : one of the superfluous fragments of life destined to be swept prematurely into that social refuse - heap of which Lily had so lately expressed her dread . But Nettie Struther ’s frail envelope was now alive with hope and energy : whatever fate the future reserved for her , she would not be cast into the refuse - heap without a struggle . “
145687	145699	145678	145678	I	0	” Lily continued , summoning a smile to her unsteady lips . “
145725	145726	145730	145730	I	0	” “
145755	145765	145747	145747	I	0	” Nettie Struther wailed with a start of recollection . “
145875	145895	145856	145857	Miss Bart	109	” She lifted her eyes tentatively to Lily ’s face , and then added with a burst of courage : “
145947	146071	145932	145932	I	0	” It WAS warm in the kitchen , which , when Nettie Struther ’s match had made a flame leap from the gas - jet above the table , revealed itself to Lily as extraordinarily small and almost miraculously clean . A fire shone through the polished flanks of the iron stove , and near it stood a crib in which a baby was sitting upright , with incipient anxiety struggling for expression on a countenance still placid with sleep . Having passionately celebrated her reunion with her offspring , and excused herself in cryptic language for the lateness of her return , Nettie restored the baby to the crib and shyly invited Miss Bart to the rocking - chair near the stove . “
146079	146086	145932	145932	I	0	” she explained with pardonable pride ; “
146113	146172	146097	146097	I	0	” On receiving Lily ’s assurance that she much preferred the friendly proximity of the kitchen fire , Mrs. Struther proceeded to prepare a bottle of infantile food , which she tenderly applied to the baby ’s impatient lips ; and while the ensuing degustation went on , she seated herself with a beaming countenance beside her visitor . “
146339	146348	146327	146327	George	131	” Her lips broke into a reminiscent smile . “
146411	146425	146400	146400	I	0	” She paused to readjust the bottle to the child ’s bubbling mouth . “
146517	146544	146545	146545	You	109	” She broke off again , and meeting the encouragement in Lily ’s eyes , went on , with a flush rising under her anaemic skin : “
146692	146846	146857	146857	she	2628	“ It was then I came down sick — I thought it was the end of everything . I guess it would have been if you had n’t sent me off . But when I found I was getting well I began to take heart in spite of myself . And then , when I got back home , George came round and asked me to marry him . At first I thought I could n’t , because we ’d been brought up together , and I knew he knew about me . But after a while I began to see that that made it easier . I never could have told another man , and I ’d never have married without telling ; but if George cared for me enough to have me as I was , I did n’t see why I should n’t begin over again — and I did . ”
146869	146915	146857	146857	she	2628	“ But , mercy , I did n’t mean to go on like this about myself , with you sitting there looking so fagged out . Only it ’s so lovely having you here , and letting you see just how you ’ve helped me . ”
146942	146963	146964	146964	she	2628	“ I only wish I could help YOU — but I suppose there ’s nothing on earth I could do , ”
147162	147202	147151	147151	Nettie	297	“ Would n’t it be too lovely for anything if she could grow up to be just like you ? Of course I know she never COULD — but mothers are always dreaming the craziest things for their children . ”
147221	147242	147243	147243	she	109	“ Oh , she must not do that — I should be afraid to come and see her too often ! ”
149667	149669	149617	149617	her	109	“ elevated ”
151301	151304	151305	151305	Gerty	112	“ Lawrence ! ”
151312	151319	151305	151305	Gerty	112	“ how could you get here so quickly?”—and
151427	151434	151422	151424	Some one else	2936	“ It was the greatest mercy — ”
151631	151719	151726	151726	she	109	“ The doctor found a bottle of chloral — she had been sleeping badly for a long time , and she must have taken an overdose by mistake .... There is no doubt of that — no doubt — there will be no question — he has been very kind . I told him that you and I would like to be left alone with her — to go over her things before any one else comes . I know it is what she would have wished . ”
151884	151930	151931	151931	He	108	“ You understand what the doctor has gone for ? He has promised that there shall be no trouble — but of course the formalities must be gone through . And I asked him to give us time to look through her things first — — ”
151943	151950	151951	151951	she	340	“ It wo n’t take long , ”
151954	151963	151964	151964	he	108	“ No — it wo n’t take long , ”
152002	152013	151997	151997	she	340	“ You will find me downstairs if you want me . ”
152021	152034	151997	151997	she	340	“ But why are you going ? She would have wished — — ”
152043	152055	152037	152037	her	112	“ No : this is what she would have wished — — ”
152802	152808	152790	152790	he	108	“ When may I come to you?”—his
153617	153620	153608	153608	I	0	“ Gertie , ”
153625	153627	153622	153622	I	0	“ Gerty ”
