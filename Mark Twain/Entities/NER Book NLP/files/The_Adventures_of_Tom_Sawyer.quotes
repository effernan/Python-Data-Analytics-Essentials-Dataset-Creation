But old fools is the biggest fools there is . Ca n’t learn an old dog new tricks , as the saying is . But my goodness , he never plays them alike , two days , and how is a body to know what ’s coming ? He ’ pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up , and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh , it ’s all down again and I ca n’t hit him a lick . I ai n’t doing my duty by that boy , and that ’s the Lord ’s truth , goodness knows . Spare the rod and spile the child , as the Good Book says . I ’m a laying up sin and suffering for us both , I know . He ’s full of the Old Scratch , but laws - a - me ! he ’s my own dead sister ’s boy , poor thing , and I ai n’t got the heart to lash him , somehow . Every time I let him off , my conscience does hurt me so , and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks . Well - a - well , man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble , as the Scripture says , and I reckon it ’s so . He ’ll play hookey this evening , [ * ] and I ’ll just be obleeged to make him work , tomorrow , to punish him . It ’s mighty hard to make him work Saturdays , when all the boys is having holiday , but he hates work more than he hates anything else , and I ’ve _ got _ to do some of my duty by him , or I ’ll be the ruination of the child . ”

That is the way good little boys and girls should do . I see one little girl who is looking out of the window — I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere — perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds . [ Applausive titter . ] I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright , clean little faces assembled in a place like this , learning to do right and be good . ”

And you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them ; for knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world ; it ’s what makes great men and good men ; you ’ll be a great man and a good man yourself , some day , Thomas , and then you ’ll look back and say , It ’s all owing to the precious Sunday - school privileges of my boyhood — it ’s all owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn — it ’s all owing to the good superintendent , who encouraged me , and watched over me , and gave me a beautiful Bible — a splendid elegant Bible — to keep and have it all for my own , always — it ’s all owing to right bringing up ! That is what you will say , Thomas — and you would n’t take any money for those two thousand verses — no indeed you would n’t . And now you would n’t mind telling me and this lady some of the things you ’ve learned — no , I know you wouldn’t — for we are proud of little boys that learn . Now , no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples . Wo n’t you tell us the names of the first two that were appointed ? ”

16065	16111	15951	15951	he	2044	“ Oh , please , auntie , do n’t pull it out . It do n’t hurt any more . I wish I may never stir if it does . Please do n’t , auntie . I do n’t want to stay home from school . ”
16112	16172	15905	15905	she	189	“ Oh , you do n’t , do n’t you ? So all this row was because you thought you ’d get to stay home from school and go a - fishing ? Tom , Tom , I love you so , and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness . ”
16359	16363	16365	16365	he	46	“ Sour grapes ! ”

16755	16762	18298	18298	he	45	“ What ’s that you got ? ”
16763	16767	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Dead cat . ”
16768	16788	18298	18298	he	45	“ Lemme see him , Huck . My , he ’s pretty stiff . Where ’d you get him ? ”
16789	16796	18298	18298	he	45	“ Bought him off’n a boy . ”
16797	16803	18298	18298	he	45	“ What did you give ? ”
16804	16822	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter - house . ”
16823	16832	18298	18298	he	45	“ Where ’d you get the blue ticket ? ”
16833	16848	18298	18298	he	45	“ Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop - stick . ”
16849	16861	18298	18298	he	45	“ Say — what is dead cats good for , Huck ? ”
16862	16870	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Good for ? Cure warts with . ”
16871	16885	18298	18298	he	45	“ No ! Is that so ? I know something that ’s better . ”
16886	16897	18298	18298	he	45	“ I bet you do n’t . What is it ? ”
16898	16905	18298	18298	he	45	“ Why , spunk - water . ”
16906	16922	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Spunk - water ! I would n’t give a dern for spunk - water . ”
16923	16937	18298	18298	he	45	“ You would n’t , would n’t you ? D’you ever try it ? ”
16938	16949	18298	18298	he	45	“ No , I hain’t . But Bob Tanner did . ”
16950	16956	18298	18298	he	45	“ Who told you so ! ”
16957	16998	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Why , he told Jeff Thatcher , and Jeff told Johnny Baker , and Johnny told Jim Hollis , and Jim told Ben Rogers , and Ben told a nigger , and the nigger told me . There now ! ”
16999	17052	18298	18298	he	45	“ Well , what of it ? They ’ll all lie . Leastways all but the nigger . I do n’t know _ him _ . But I never see a nigger that _ would n’t _ lie . Shucks ! Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it , Huck . ”
17053	17073	18298	18298	he	45	“ Why , he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain - water was . ”
17074	17079	18298	18298	he	45	“ In the daytime ? ”
17080	17083	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Certainly . ”
17084	17092	18298	18298	he	45	“ With his face to the stump ? ”
17093	17101	18298	18298	he	45	“ Yes . Least I reckon so . ”
17102	17108	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Did he say anything ? ”
17109	17122	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ I do n’t reckon he did . I do n’t know . ”
17123	17267	18298	18298	he	45	“ Aha ! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk - water such a blame fool way as that ! Why , that ai n’t a - going to do any good . You got to go all by yourself , to the middle of the woods , where you know there ’s a spunk - water stump , and just as it ’s midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say : ‘ Barley - corn , barley - corn , injun - meal shorts , Spunk - water , spunk - water , swaller these warts , ’ and then walk away quick , eleven steps , with your eyes shut , and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody . Because if you speak the charm ’s busted . ”
17268	17288	18298	18298	he	45	“ Well , that sounds like a good way ; but that ai n’t the way Bob Tanner done . ”
17289	17371	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ No , sir , you can bet he did n’t , becuz he ’s the wartiest boy in this town ; and he would n’t have a wart on him if he ’d knowed how to work spunk - water . I ’ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way , Huck . I play with frogs so much that I ’ve always got considerable many warts . Sometimes I take ’em off with a bean . ”
17372	17384	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Yes , bean ’s good . I ’ve done that . ”
17385	17394	18298	18298	he	45	“ Have you ? What ’s your way ? ”
17395	17502	18298	18298	he	45	“ You take and split the bean , and cut the wart so as to get some blood , and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it ’bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon , and then you burn up the rest of the bean . You see that piece that ’s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing , trying to fetch the other piece to it , and so that helps the blood to draw the wart , and pretty soon off she comes . ”
17503	17575	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Yes , that ’s it , Huck — that ’s it ; though when you ’re burying it if you say ‘ Down bean ; off wart ; come no more to bother me ! ’ it ’s better . That ’s the way Joe Harper does , and he ’s been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres . But say — how do you cure ’em with dead cats ? ”
17576	17689	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Why , you take your cat and go and get in the grave - yard ’ long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried ; and when it ’s midnight a devil will come , or maybe two or three , but you ca n’t see ’em , you can only hear something like the wind , or maybe hear ’em talk ; and when they ’re taking that feller away , you heave your cat after ’em and say , ‘ Devil follow corpse , cat follow devil , warts follow cat , I ’m done with ye ! ’ That ’ll fetch _ any _ wart . ”
17690	17701	18298	18298	he	45	“ Sounds right . D’you ever try it , Huck ? ”
17702	17712	18298	18298	he	45	“ No , but old Mother Hopkins told me . ”
17713	17732	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Well , I reckon it ’s so , then . Becuz they say she ’s a witch . ”
17733	17817	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Say ! Why , Tom , I _ know _ she is . She witched pap . Pap says so his own self . He come along one day , and he see she was a - witching him , so he took up a rock , and if she had n’t dodged , he ’d a got her . Well , that very night he rolled off’n a shed wher ’ he was a layin drunk , and broke his arm . ”
17818	17836	18298	18298	he	45	“ Why , that ’s awful . How did he know she was a - witching him ? ”
17837	17882	18298	18298	he	45	“ Lord , pap can tell , easy . Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy , they ’re a - witching you . Specially if they mumble . Becuz when they mumble they ’re saying the Lord ’s Prayer backards . ”
17883	17896	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Say , Hucky , when you going to try the cat ? ”
17897	17915	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ To - night . I reckon they ’ll come after old Hoss Williams to - night . ”
17916	17931	18298	18298	he	45	“ But they buried him Saturday . Did n’t they get him Saturday night ? ”
17932	17968	18298	18298	he	45	“ Why , how you talk ! How could their charms work till midnight?—and _ then _ it ’s Sunday . Devils do n’t slosh around much of a Sunday , I do n’t reckon . ”
17969	17985	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ I never thought of that . That ’s so . Lemme go with you ? ”
17986	17996	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Of course — if you ai n’t afeard . ”
17997	18008	18298	18298	he	45	“ Afeard ! ’ Tain’t likely . Will you meow ? ”
18009	18067	18298	18298	he	45	“ Yes — and you meow back , if you get a chance . Last time , you kep ’ me a - meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says ‘ Dern that cat ! ’ and so I hove a brick through his window — but do n’t you tell . ”
18068	18099	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ I wo n’t . I could n’t meow that night , becuz auntie was watching me , but I ’ll meow this time . Say — what ’s that ? ”
18100	18106	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Nothing but a tick . ”
18107	18114	18298	18298	he	45	“ Where ’d you get him ? ”
18115	18121	18298	18298	he	45	“ Out in the woods . ”
18122	18130	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ What ’ll you take for him ? ”
18131	18145	18298	18298	he	45	“ I do n’t know . I do n’t want to sell him . ”
18146	18159	18298	18298	he	45	“ All right . It ’s a mighty small tick , anyway . ”
18160	18191	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Oh , anybody can run a tick down that do n’t belong to them . I ’m satisfied with it . It ’s a good enough tick for me . ”
18192	18213	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Sho , there ’s ticks a plenty . I could have a thousand of ’em if I wanted to . ”
18214	18252	18298	18298	he	45	“ Well , why do n’t you ? Becuz you know mighty well you ca n’t . This is a pretty early tick , I reckon . It ’s the first one I ’ve seen this year . ”
18253	18266	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Say , Huck — I’ll give you my tooth for him . ”
18267	18272	16731	16731	Tom	46	“ Less see it . ”
18301	18306	18298	18298	he	45	“ Is it genuwyne ? ”
18316	18322	18324	18324	Huckleberry	45	“ Well , all right , ”
18326	18332	18324	18324	Huckleberry	45	“ it ’s a trade . ”
18443	18447	18448	18448	Tom	46	“ Thomas Sawyer ! ”
18463	18466	18448	18448	Tom	46	“ Sir ! ”
18467	18485	18486	18486	Tom	46	“ Come up here . Now , sir , why are you late again , as usual ? ”
18545	18556	18541	18541	He	656	“ _ I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn ! _ ”
18591	18598	18587	18588	The master	656	“ You — you did what ? ”
18599	18607	18587	18588	The master	656	“ Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn . ”
18615	18645	18587	18588	The master	656	“ Thomas Sawyer , this is the most astounding confession I have ever listened to . No mere ferule will answer for this offence . Take off your jacket . ”
18668	18689	18587	18588	The master	656	“ Now , sir , go and sit with the girls ! And let this be a warning to you . ”
18827	18831	18823	18823	She	334	“ made a mouth ”
18904	18913	18898	18898	Tom	46	“ Please take it — I got more . ”

20158	20169	20174	20174	Tom	46	“ All right , go ahead ; start him up . ”
20359	20367	20357	20357	he	62	“ Tom , you let him alone . ”

20400	20413	20357	20357	he	62	“ Blame it , I ai n’t going to stir him much . ”
20414	20423	20357	20357	he	62	“ Let him alone , I tell you . ”

20457	20482	20357	20357	he	62	“ I do n’t care whose tick he is — he ’s on my side of the line , and you sha’n’t touch him . ”
20483	20513	20357	20357	he	62	“ Well , I ’ll just bet I will , though . He ’s my tick and I ’ll do what I blame please with him , or die ! ”

20822	20843	20778	20778	He	46	“ No , I do n’t care for rats much , anyway . What I like is chewing - gum . ”
20844	20859	20778	20778	He	46	“ Oh , I should say so ! I wish I had some now . ”
20860	20886	20778	20778	He	46	“ Do you ? I ’ve got some . I ’ll let you chew it awhile , but you must give it back to me . ”

21015	21048	20778	20778	He	46	“ Yes , that ’s so . And they get slathers of money — most a dollar a day , Ben Rogers says . Say , Becky , was you ever engaged ? ”
21049	21054	20778	20778	He	46	“ What ’s that ? ”

21075	21090	20778	20778	He	46	“ I reckon so . I do n’t know . What is it like ? ”
21091	21134	20778	20778	He	46	“ Like ? Why it ai n’t like anything . You only just tell a boy you wo n’t ever have anybody but him , ever ever ever , and then you kiss and that ’s all . Anybody can do it . ”
21135	21144	20778	20778	He	46	“ Kiss ? What do you kiss for ? ”
21145	21163	20778	20778	He	46	“ Why , that , you know , is to — well , they always do that . ”
21164	21167	20778	20778	He	46	“ Everybody ? ”
21168	21192	20778	20778	He	46	“ Why , yes , everybody that ’s in love with each other . Do you remember what I wrote on the slate ? ”
21193	21198	20778	20778	He	46	“ Ye — yes . ”
21199	21204	20778	20778	He	46	“ What was it ? ”
21205	21211	20778	20778	He	46	“ I sha’n’t tell you . ”
21212	21220	20778	20778	He	46	“ Shall I tell _ you _ ? ”
21221	21231	20778	20778	He	46	“ Ye — yes — but some other time . ”
21232	21237	20778	20778	He	46	“ No , now . ”
21238	21248	20778	20778	He	46	“ No , not now — to - morrow . ”
21249	21274	21275	21275	Becky	86	“ Oh , no , _ now _ . Please , Becky — I’ll whisper it , I ’ll whisper it ever so easy . ”
21312	21324	21309	21309	he	46	“ Now you whisper it to me — just the same . ”
21336	21375	21325	21325	She	86	“ You turn your face away so you ca n’t see , and then I will . But you must n’t ever tell anybody—_will _ you , Tom ? Now you wo n’t , _ will _ you ? ”
21376	21390	21391	21391	He	46	“ No , indeed , indeed I wo n’t . Now , Becky . ”

21464	21499	21455	21455	Tom	46	“ Now , Becky , it ’s all done — all over but the kiss . Do n’t you be afraid of that — it ai n’t anything at all . Please , Becky . ”
21545	21591	21537	21537	Tom	46	“ Now it ’s all done , Becky . And always after this , you know , you ai n’t ever to love anybody but me , and you ai n’t ever to marry anybody but me , ever never and forever . Will you ? ”
21592	21627	21455	21455	Tom	46	“ No , I ’ll never love anybody but you , Tom , and I ’ll never marry anybody but you — and you ai n’t to ever marry anybody but me , either . ”
21628	21691	21761	21761	Tom	46	“ Certainly . Of course . That ’s _ part _ of it . And always coming to school or when we ’re going home , you ’re to walk with me , when there ai n’t anybody looking — and you choose me and I choose you at parties , because that ’s the way you do when you ’re engaged . ”
21692	21705	21761	21761	Tom	46	“ It ’s so nice . I never heard of it before . ”
21706	21722	21455	21455	Tom	46	“ Oh , it ’s ever so gay ! Why , me and Amy Lawrence — ”
21736	21754	21731	21731	he	46	“ Oh , Tom ! Then I ai n’t the first you ’ve ever been engaged to ! ”
21764	21782	21761	21761	Tom	46	“ Oh , do n’t cry , Becky , I do n’t care for her any more . ”
21783	21796	21797	21797	Tom	46	“ Yes , you do , Tom — you know you do . ”
21976	21990	21972	21972	he	46	“ Becky , I — I do n’t care for anybody but you . ”
21997	21998	21972	21972	he	46	“ Becky”—pleadingly
22000	22009	21972	21972	he	46	“ Becky , wo n’t you say something ? ”
22045	22056	22057	22057	She	2048	“ Please , Becky , wo n’t you take it ? ”

Did you think I ’d forget ? The Injun blood ai n’t in me for nothing . And now I ’ve _ got _ you , and you got to _ settle _ , you know ! ”

26590	26597	26599	26599	Joe	100	“ It ’s a dirty business , ”
26604	26612	26599	26599	Joe	100	“ What did you do it for ? ”
26613	26621	26571	26571	His	96	“ I ! I never done it ! ”
26622	26634	26635	26635	Potter	96	“ Look here ! That kind of talk wo n’t wash . ”
26641	26744	26635	26635	Potter	96	“ I thought I ’d got sober . I ’d no business to drink to - night . But it ’s in my head yet — worse’n when we started here . I ’m all in a muddle ; ca n’t recollect anything of it , hardly . Tell me , Joe—_honest _ , now , old feller — did I do it ? Joe , I never meant to—’pon my soul and honor , I never meant to , Joe . Tell me how it was , Joe . Oh , it ’s awful — and him so young and promising . ”
26745	26811	26571	26571	His	96	“ Why , you two was scuffling , and he fetched you one with the headboard and you fell flat ; and then up you come , all reeling and staggering like , and snatched the knife and jammed it into him , just as he fetched you another awful clip — and here you ’ve laid , as dead as a wedge til now . ”
26812	26933	26635	26635	Potter	96	“ Oh , I did n’t know what I was a - doing . I wish I may die this minute if I did . It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement , I reckon . I never used a weepon in my life before , Joe . I ’ve fought , but never with weepons . They ’ll all say that . Joe , do n’t tell ! Say you wo n’t tell , Joe — that ’s a good feller . I always liked you , Joe , and stood up for you , too . Do n’t you remember ? You _ wo n’t _ tell , _ will _ you , Joe ? ”
26953	26992	26949	26949	his	828	“ No , you ’ve always been fair and square with me , Muff Potter , and I wo n’t go back on you . There , now , that ’s as fair as a man can say . ”
26993	27015	26635	26635	Potter	96	“ Oh , Joe , you ’re an angel . I ’ll bless you for this the longest day I live . ”
27022	27065	27017	27017	Potter	96	“ Come , now , that ’s enough of that . This ai n’t any time for blubbering . You be off yonder way and I ’ll go this . Move , now , and do n’t leave any tracks behind you . ”
27090	27146	27087	27087	He	823	“ If he ’s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of being , he wo n’t think of the knife till he ’s gone so far he ’ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself — chicken - heart ! ”

27385	27396	27382	27382	Tom	46	“ Huckleberry , what do you reckon’ll come of this ? ”
27397	27410	27435	27435	he	46	“ If Doctor Robinson dies , I reckon hanging’ll come of it . ”
27411	27416	27435	27435	he	46	“ Do you though ? ”
27417	27428	27429	27429	Tom	46	“ Why , I _ know _ it , Tom . ”
27438	27445	27435	27435	he	46	“ Who ’ll tell ? We ? ”
27446	27487	27435	27435	he	46	“ What are you talking about ? S’pose something happened and Injun Joe _ did n’t _ hang ? Why , he ’d kill us some time or other , just as dead sure as we ’re a laying here . ”
27488	27501	27435	27435	he	46	“ That ’s just what I was thinking to myself , Huck . ”
27502	27525	27526	27526	Tom	46	“ If anybody tells , let Muff Potter do it , if he ’s fool enough . He ’s generally drunk enough . ”
27538	27553	27535	27535	he	46	“ Huck , Muff Potter do n’t know it . How can he tell ? ”
27554	27565	27435	27435	he	46	“ What ’s the reason he do n’t know it ? ”
27566	27593	27435	27435	he	46	“ Because he ’d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it . D’you reckon he could see anything ? D’you reckon he knowed anything ? ”
27594	27604	27535	27535	he	46	“ By hokey , that ’s so , Tom ! ”
27605	27624	27435	27435	he	46	“ And besides , look - a - here — maybe that whack done for _ him _ ! ”
27625	27718	27435	27435	he	46	“ No , ’ taint likely , Tom . He had liquor in him ; I could see that ; and besides , he always has . Well , when pap ’s full , you might take and belt him over the head with a church and you could n’t phase him . He says so , his own self . So it ’s the same with Muff Potter , of course . But if a man was dead sober , I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him ; I dono . ”
27727	27737	27724	27724	Tom	46	“ Hucky , you sure you can keep mum ? ”
27738	27815	27435	27435	he	46	“ Tom , we _ got _ to keep mum . You know that . That Injun devil would n’t make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats , if we was to squeak ’bout this and they did n’t hang him . Now , look - a - here , Tom , less take and swear to one another — that ’s what we got to do — swear to keep mum . ”
27816	27837	27435	27435	he	46	“ I ’m agreed . It ’s the best thing . Would you just hold hands and swear that we — ”
27838	27897	27724	27724	Tom	46	“ Oh no , that would n’t do for this . That ’s good enough for little rubbishy common things — specially with gals , cuz _ they _ go back on you anyway , and blab if they get in a huff — but there orter be writing ’bout a big thing like this . And blood . ”

28092	28097	28049	28049	He	45	“ What ’s verdigrease ? ”
28098	28120	28067	28067	Tom	46	“ It ’s p’ison . That ’s what it is . You just swaller some of it once — you’ll see . ”

28360	28368	28370	28370	Huckleberry	45	“ Which of us does he mean ? ”
28372	28383	28370	28370	Huckleberry	45	“ I dono — peep through the crack . Quick ! ”
28384	28393	28370	28370	Huckleberry	45	“ No , _ you _ , Tom ! ”
28394	28408	28370	28370	Huckleberry	45	“ I can’t — I ca n’t _ do _ it , Huck ! ”

28486	28519	28547	28547	Huckleberry	45	“ Oh , that ’s good — I tell you , Tom , I was most scared to death ; I ’d a bet anything it was a _ stray _ dog . ”

28623	28655	28579	28579	he	46	“ Oh , Tom , I reckon we ’re goners . I reckon there ai n’t no mistake ’bout where _ I ’ll _ go to . I been so wicked . ”

43350	43361	43363	43363	Joe	62	“ I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day , ”
43365	43372	43363	43363	Joe	62	“ I do n’t feel sick . ”
43373	43378	43380	43380	Tom	46	“ Neither do I , ”
43382	43399	43380	43380	Tom	46	“ I could smoke it all day . But I bet you Jeff Thatcher could n’t . ”
43400	43428	43342	43342	Tom	46	“ Jeff Thatcher ! Why , he ’d keel over just with two draws . Just let him try it once . _ He ’d _ see ! ”
43429	43449	43342	43342	Tom	46	“ I bet he would . And Johnny Miller — I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle it once . ”
43450	43457	43459	43459	Joe	62	“ Oh , do n’t I ! ”
43461	43488	43459	43459	Joe	62	“ Why , I bet you Johnny Miller could n’t any more do this than nothing . Just one little snifter would fetch _ him _ . ”
43489	43508	43342	43342	Tom	46	“ ’ Deed it would , Joe . Say — I wish the boys could see us now . ”
43509	43513	43342	43342	Tom	46	“ So do I. ”
43514	43647	43459	43459	Joe	62	“ Say — boys , do n’t say anything about it , and some time when they ’re around , I ’ll come up to you and say , ‘ Joe , got a pipe ? I want a smoke . ’ And you ’ll say , kind of careless like , as if it warn’t anything , you ’ll say , ‘ Yes , I got my _ old _ pipe , and another one , but my tobacker ai n’t very good . ’ And I ’ll say , ‘ Oh , that ’s all right , if it ’s _ strong _ enough . ’ And then you ’ll out with the pipes , and we ’ll light up just as ca’m , and then just see ’em look ! ”
43648	43667	43342	43342	Tom	46	“ By jings , that ’ll be gay , Tom ! I wish it was _ now _ ! ”
43668	43695	43342	43342	Tom	46	“ So do I ! And when we tell ’em we learned when we was off pirating , wo n’t they wish they ’d been along ? ”
43696	43712	43459	43459	Joe	62	“ Oh , I reckon not ! I ’ll just _ bet _ they will ! ”
43833	43849	43829	43829	Joe	62	“ I ’ve lost my knife . I reckon I better go and find it . ”
43860	43894	43850	43850	Tom	46	“ I ’ll help you . You go over that way and I ’ll hunt around by the spring . No , you need n’t come , Huck — we can find it . ”
44285	44295	44297	44297	Tom	46	“ Quick ! boys , go for the tent ! ”
45551	45577	45548	45548	She	86	“ Oh , if I only had a brass andiron - knob again ! But I have n’t got anything now to remember him by . ”
45595	45645	45587	45587	she	86	“ It was right here . Oh , if it was to do over again , I would n’t say that — I would n’t say it for the whole world . But he ’s gone now ; I ’ll never , never , never see him any more . ”
45753	45825	45732	45733	each speaker	1268	“ and I was a - standing just so — just as I am now , and as if you was him — I was as close as that — and he smiled , just this way — and then something seemed to go all over me , like — awful , you know — and I never thought what it meant , of course , but I can see now ! ”
45928	45938	45907	45917	One poor chap , who had no other grandeur to offer	1275	“ Well , Tom Sawyer he licked me once . ”
46188	46197	46171	46171	his	544	“ I am the Resurrection and the Life . ”
46549	46568	46543	46543	Tom	46	“ Aunt Polly , it ai n’t fair . Somebody ’s got to be glad to see Huck . ”
46569	46586	46543	46543	Tom	46	“ And so they shall . I ’m glad to see him , poor motherless thing ! ”
46622	46636	46612	46613	the minister	544	“ Praise God from whom all blessings flow—_sing_!—and put your hearts in it ! ”
46685	46687	46684	46688	the “ sold ” congregation	1316	“ sold ”
46887	46974	46883	46884	Aunt Polly	47	“ Well , I do n’t say it was n’t a fine joke , Tom , to keep everybody suffering ’ most a week so you boys had a good time , but it is a pity you could be so hard - hearted as to let me suffer so . If you could come over on a log to go to your funeral , you could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warn’t dead , but only run off . ”
46975	46986	46988	46988	Mary	47	“ Yes , you could have done that , Tom , ”
46990	47003	46988	46988	Mary	47	“ and I believe you would if you had thought of it . ”
47004	47010	47012	47013	Aunt Polly	47	“ Would you , Tom ? ”
47020	47035	47015	47015	her	47	“ Say , now , would you , if you ’d thought of it ? ”
47036	47054	46988	46988	Mary	47	“ I — well , I do n’t know . ’ Twould ’ a ’ spoiled everything . ”
47055	47066	47068	47069	Aunt Polly	47	“ Tom , I hoped you loved me that much , ”
47080	47108	47068	47069	Aunt Polly	47	“ It would have been something if you ’d cared enough to _ think _ of it , even if you did n’t _ do _ it . ”
47109	47120	47122	47122	Mary	47	“ Now , auntie , that ai n’t any harm , ”
47124	47147	47122	47122	Mary	47	“ it ’s only Tom ’s giddy way — he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything . ”
47148	47207	47068	47069	Aunt Polly	47	“ More ’s the pity . Sid would have thought . And Sid would have come and _ done _ it , too . Tom , you ’ll look back , some day , when it ’s too late , and wish you ’d cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so little . ”
47208	47221	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Now , auntie , you know I do care for you , ”
47225	47238	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ I ’d know it better if you acted more like it . ”
47239	47247	47249	47249	Tom	46	“ I wish now I ’d thought , ”
47256	47273	47249	47249	Tom	46	“ but I dreamt about you , anyway . That ’s something , ai n’t it ? ”
47274	47298	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ It ai n’t much — a cat does that much — but it ’s better than nothing . What did you dream ? ”
47299	47330	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Why , Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed , and Sid was sitting by the woodbox , and Mary next to him . ”
47331	47357	47249	47249	Tom	46	“ Well , so we did . So we always do . I ’m glad your dreams could take even that much trouble about us . ”
47358	47370	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ And I dreamt that Joe Harper ’s mother was here . ”
47371	47384	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Why , she was here ! Did you dream any more ? ”
47385	47398	47249	47249	Tom	46	“ Oh , lots . But it ’s so dim , now . ”
47399	47409	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Well , try to recollect — can’t you ? ”
47410	47427	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Somehow it seems to me that the wind — the wind blowed the — the — ”
47428	47442	47249	47249	Tom	46	“ Try harder , Tom ! The wind did blow something . Come ! ”
47458	47476	47443	47443	Tom	46	“ I ’ve got it now ! I ’ve got it now ! It blowed the candle ! ”
47477	47490	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Mercy on us ! Go on , Tom — go on ! ”
47491	47511	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ And it seems to me that you said , ‘ Why , I believe that that door — ’ ”
47512	47520	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Go _ on _ , Tom ! ”
47521	47546	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Just let me study a moment — just a moment . Oh , yes — you said you believed the door was open . ”
47547	47566	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ As I ’m sitting here , I did ! Did n’t I , Mary ! Go on ! ”
47567	47595	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ And then — and then — well I wo n’t be certain , but it seems like as if you made Sid go and — and — ”
47596	47617	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Well ? Well ? What did I make him do , Tom ? What did I make him do ? ”
47618	47633	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ You made him — you — Oh , you made him shut it . ”
47634	47706	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Well , for the land ’s sake ! I never heard the beat of that in all my days ! Do n’t tell _ me _ there ai n’t anything in dreams , any more . Sereny Harper shall know of this before I ’m an hour older . I ’d like to see her get around _ this _ with her rubbage ’bout superstition . Go on , Tom ! ”
47707	47757	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Oh , it ’s all getting just as bright as day , now . Next you said I warn’t _ bad _ , only mischeevous and harum - scarum , and not any more responsible than — than — I think it was a colt , or something . ”
47758	47774	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ And so it was ! Well , goodness gracious ! Go on , Tom ! ”
47775	47783	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ And then you began to cry . ”
47784	47803	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ So I did . So I did . Not the first time , neither . And then — ”
47804	47842	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry , and said Joe was just the same , and she wished she had n’t whipped him for taking cream when she ’d throwed it out her own self — ”
47843	47872	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Tom ! The sperrit was upon you ! You was a prophesying — that ’s what you was doing ! Land alive , go on , Tom ! ”
47873	47882	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Then Sid he said — he said — ”
47883	47892	47894	47894	Sid	51	“ I do n’t think I said anything , ”
47896	47903	47905	47905	Mary	47	“ Yes you did , Sid , ”
47907	47924	47905	47905	Mary	47	“ Shut your heads and let Tom go on ! What did he say , Tom ? ”
47925	47955	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ He said — I _ think _ he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone to , but if I ’d been better sometimes — ”
47956	47971	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ _ There _ , d’you hear that ! It was his very words ! ”
47972	47980	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ And you shut him up sharp . ”
47981	48007	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ I lay I did ! There must ’ a ’ been an angel there . There _ was _ an angel there , somewheres ! ”
48008	48032	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker , and you told about Peter and the Pain - killer — ”
48033	48041	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Just as true as I live ! ”
48042	48081	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ And then there was a whole lot of talk ’bout dragging the river for us , and ’bout having the funeral Sunday , and then you and old Miss Harper hugged and cried , and she went . ”
48082	48133	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ It happened just so ! It happened just so , as sure as I ’m a - sitting in these very tracks . Tom , you could n’t told it more like if you ’d ’ a ’ seen it ! And then what ? Go on , Tom ! ”
48134	48228	47223	47223	Tom	46	“ Then I thought you prayed for me — and I could see you and hear every word you said . And you went to bed , and I was so sorry that I took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark , ‘ We ai n’t dead — we are only off being pirates , ’ and put it on the table by the candle ; and then you looked so good , laying there asleep , that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips . ”
48229	48248	48250	48250	she	1328	“ Did you , Tom , _ did _ you ! I just forgive you everything for that ! ”
48268	48283	48284	48284	Sid	51	“ It was very kind , even though it was only a — dream , ”
48289	48446	48284	48284	Sid	51	“ Shut up , Sid ! A body does just the same in a dream as he ’d do if he was awake . Here ’s a big Milum apple I ’ve been saving for you , Tom , if you was ever found again — now go ’ long to school . I ’m thankful to the good God and Father of us all I ’ve got you back , that ’s long - suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word , though goodness knows I ’m unworthy of it , but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places , there ’s few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes . Go ’ long Sid , Mary , Tom — take yourselves off — you’ve hendered me long enough . ”
48496	48513	48515	48516	a hero	1335	“ Pretty thin — as long a dream as that , without any mistakes in it ! ”
48717	48722	48723	48723	They	383	“ stuck - up . ”
48814	48818	48822	48822	her	86	“ make up . ”
48952	48956	48976	48976	she	86	“ set him up ”
49065	49085	49050	49050	She	86	“ Why , Mary Austin ! you bad girl , why did n’t you come to Sunday - school ? ”
49086	49096	49050	49050	She	86	“ I did come — didn’t you see me ? ”
49097	49110	49050	49050	She	86	“ Why , no ! Did you ? Where did you sit ? ”
49111	49131	49050	49050	She	86	“ I was in Miss Peters ’ class , where I always go . I saw _ you _ . ”
49132	49156	49050	49050	She	86	“ Did you ? Why , it ’s funny I did n’t see you . I wanted to tell you about the picnic . ”
49157	49171	49050	49050	She	86	“ Oh , that ’s jolly . Who ’s going to give it ? ”
49172	49183	49050	49050	She	86	“ My ma ’s going to let me have one . ”
49184	49199	49050	49050	She	86	“ Oh , goody ; I hope she ’ll let _ me _ come . ”
49200	49226	49050	49050	She	86	“ Well , she will . The picnic ’s for me . She ’ll let anybody come that I want , and I want you . ”
49227	49241	49050	49050	She	86	“ That ’s ever so nice . When is it going to be ? ”
49242	49251	49050	49050	She	86	“ By and by . Maybe about vacation . ”
49252	49271	49050	49050	She	86	“ Oh , wo n’t it be fun ! You going to have all the girls and boys ? ”
49272	49287	49290	49290	she	1354	“ Yes , every one that ’s friends to me — or wants to be ”
49323	49327	49329	49329	he	46	“ all to flinders ”
49331	49339	49290	49290	she	1354	“ standing within three feet of it . ”
49340	49347	49349	49350	Grace Miller	127	“ Oh , may I come ? ”
49352	49355	49349	49350	Grace Miller	127	“ Yes . ”
49356	49360	49362	49363	Sally Rogers	61	“ And me ? ”
49365	49368	49362	49363	Sally Rogers	61	“ Yes . ”
49369	49375	49377	49378	Susy Harper	128	“ And me , too ? ”
49380	49384	49377	49378	Susy Harper	128	“ And Joe ? ”
49385	49388	49362	49363	Sally Rogers	61	“ Yes . ”
49486	49491	49469	49469	she	86	“ a good cry . ”
49869	49886	49866	49866	Tom	46	“ Oh , hang her , ai n’t I ever going to get rid of her ? ”
49905	49907	49898	49898	she	334	“ around ”
49923	49928	49929	49929	Tom	46	“ Any other boy ! ”
49936	49999	49929	49929	Tom	46	“ Any boy in the whole town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is aristocracy ! Oh , all right , I licked you the first day you ever saw this town , mister , and I ’ll lick you again ! You just wait till I catch you out ! I ’ll just take and — ”
50021	50047	50001	50001	he	46	“ Oh , you do , do you ? You holler ’ nough , do you ? Now , then , let that learn you ! ”
50190	50203	50204	50204	she	86	“ Oh , here ’s a jolly one ! look at this ! ”
50213	50228	50204	50204	she	86	“ Oh , do n’t bother me ! I do n’t care for them ! ”
50257	50273	50254	50254	she	86	“ Go away and leave me alone , ca n’t you ! I hate you ! ”
50560	50572	50542	50543	his aunt	196	“ Tom , I ’ve a notion to skin you alive ! ”
50573	50581	50542	50543	his aunt	196	“ Auntie , what have I done ? ”
50582	50692	50542	50543	his aunt	196	“ Well , you ’ve done enough . Here I go over to Sereny Harper , like an old softy , expecting I ’m going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream , when lo and behold you she ’d found out from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night . Tom , I do n’t know what is to become of a boy that will act like that . It makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word . ”
50748	50765	50745	50745	he	1375	“ Auntie , I wish I had n’t done it — but I did n’t think . ”
50766	50837	50745	50745	he	1375	“ Oh , child , you never think . You never think of anything but your own selfishness . You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson ’s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles , and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream ; but you could n’t ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow . ”
50838	50879	50745	50745	he	1375	“ Auntie , I know now it was mean , but I did n’t mean to be mean . I did n’t , honest . And besides , I did n’t come over here to laugh at you that night . ”
50880	50889	50745	50745	he	1375	“ What did you come for , then ? ”
50890	50910	50745	50745	he	1375	“ It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us , because we had n’t got drownded . ”
50911	50953	50745	50745	he	1375	“ Tom , Tom , I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could believe you ever had as good a thought as that , but you know you never did — and I know it , Tom . ”
50954	50975	50745	50745	he	1375	“ Indeed and ’ deed I did , auntie — I wish I may never stir if I did n’t . ”
50976	50998	50745	50745	he	1375	“ Oh , Tom , do n’t lie — don’t do it . It only makes things a hundred times worse . ”
50999	51029	50745	50745	he	1375	“ It ai n’t a lie , auntie ; it ’s the truth . I wanted to keep you from grieving — that was all that made me come . ”
51030	51084	50745	50745	he	1375	“ I ’d give the whole world to believe that — it would cover up a power of sins , Tom . I ’d ’ most be glad you ’d run off and acted so bad . But it ai n’t reasonable ; because , why did n’t you tell me , child ? ”
51085	51141	50745	50745	he	1375	“ Why , you see , when you got to talking about the funeral , I just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church , and I could n’t somehow bear to spoil it . So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum . ”
51142	51146	50745	50745	he	1375	“ What bark ? ”
51147	51181	50745	50745	he	1375	“ The bark I had wrote on to tell you we ’d gone pirating . I wish , now , you ’d waked up when I kissed you — I do , honest . ”
51200	51210	51197	51197	her	196	“ _ Did _ you kiss me , Tom ? ”
51211	51219	50745	50745	he	1375	“ Why , yes , I did . ”

51230	51243	51197	51197	her	196	“ Why , yes , I did , auntie — certain sure . ”
51244	51254	50745	50745	he	1375	“ What did you kiss me for , Tom ? ”
51255	51273	50745	50745	he	1375	“ Because I loved you so , and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry . ”
51295	51318	51292	51292	she	189	“ Kiss me again , Tom!—and be off with you to school , now , and do n’t bother me any more . ”
51360	51443	51346	51346	she	189	“ No , I do n’t dare . Poor boy , I reckon he ’s lied about it — but it ’s a blessed , blessed lie , there ’s such a comfort come from it . I hope the Lord — I _ know _ the Lord will forgive him , because it was such good - heartedness in him to tell it . But I do n’t want to find out it ’s a lie . I wo n’t look . ”
51489	51510	51476	51476	she	189	“ It ’s a good lie — it ’s a good lie — I wo n’t let it grieve me . ”
51535	51552	51521	51521	she	189	“ I could forgive the boy , now , if he ’d committed a million sins ! ”
51622	51663	51615	51615	he	46	“ I acted mighty mean today , Becky , and I ’m so sorry . I wo n’t ever , ever do that way again , as long as ever I live — please make up , wo n’t you ? ”
51675	51700	51701	51701	She	334	“ I ’ll thank you to keep yourself _ to _ yourself , Mr. Thomas Sawyer . I ’ll never speak to you again . ”

52177	52206	52156	52156	She	86	“ Tom Sawyer , you are just as mean as you can be , to sneak up on a person and look at what they ’re looking at . ”
52207	52218	52271	52271	her	86	“ How could I know you was looking at anything ? ”
52219	52267	52269	52269	she	86	“ You ought to be ashamed of yourself , Tom Sawyer ; you know you ’re going to tell on me , and oh , what shall I do , what shall I do ! I ’ll be whipped , and I never was whipped in school . ”
52277	52309	52310	52310	she	86	“ _ Be _ so mean if you want to ! I know something that ’s going to happen . You just wait and you ’ll see ! Hateful , hateful , hateful!”—and
52339	52513	52334	52334	he	46	“ What a curious kind of a fool a girl is ! Never been licked in school ! Shucks ! What ’s a licking ! That ’s just like a girl — they’re so thin - skinned and chicken - hearted . Well , of course I ai n’t going to tell old Dobbins on this little fool , because there ’s other ways of getting even on her , that ai n’t so mean ; but what of it ? Old Dobbins will ask who it was tore his book . Nobody’ll answer . Then he ’ll do just the way he always does — ask first one and then t’other , and when he comes to the right girl he ’ll know it , without any telling . Girls ’ faces always tell on them . They ai n’t got any backbone . She ’ll get licked . Well , it ’s a kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher , because there ai n’t any way out of it . ”
52526	52550	52514	52514	Tom	46	“ All right , though ; she ’d like to see me in just such a fix — let her sweat it out ! ”

Imagination is busy sketching rose - tinted pictures of joy . In fancy , the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng , ‘ the observed of all observers . ’ Her graceful form , arrayed in snowy robes , is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance ; her eye is brightest , her step is lightest in the gay assembly . “
55050	55077	55032	55032	she	1474	” And so forth and so on . There was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading , accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “
55081	55082	55032	55032	she	1474	” “
55086	55087	55032	55032	she	1474	” “
55091	55123	55032	55032	she	1474	” etc . , and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic . Then arose a slim , melancholy girl , whose face had the “
55125	55137	55032	55032	she	1474	” paleness that comes of pills and indigestion , and read a “
55140	55148	55149	55151	A MISSOURI MAIDEN	136	” Two stanzas of it will do : “
55156	55233	55032	55032	she	1474	“ Alabama , goodbye ! I love thee well ! But yet for a while do I leave thee now ! Sad , yes , sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell , And burning recollections throng my brow ! For I have wandered through thy flowery woods ; Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa ’s stream ; Have listened to Tallassee ’s warring floods , And wooed on Coosa ’s side Aurora ’s beam . “
55319	55328	55313	55313	they	1481	” There were very few there who knew what “
55332	55711	55313	55313	they	1481	” meant , but the poem was very satisfactory , nevertheless . Next appeared a dark - complexioned , black - eyed , black - haired young lady , who paused an impressive moment , assumed a tragic expression , and began to read in a measured , solemn tone : A VISION Dark and tempestuous was night . Around the throne on high not a single star quivered ; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear ; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven , seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin ! Even the boisterous winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes , and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene . At such a time , so dark , so dreary , for human sympathy my very spirit sighed ; but instead thereof , ‘ My dearest friend , my counsellor , my comforter and guide — My joy in grief , my second bliss in joy , ’ came to my side . She moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy ’s Eden by the romantic and young , a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness . So soft was her step , it failed to make even a sound , and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch , as other unobtrusive beauties , she would have glided away unperceived — unsought . A strange sadness rested upon her features , like icy tears upon the robe of December , as she pointed to the contending elements without , and bade me contemplate the two beings presented . This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non - Presbyterians that it took the first prize . This composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening . The mayor of the village , in delivering the prize to the author of it , made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most “
55713	55750	55313	55313	they	1481	” thing he had ever listened to , and that Daniel Webster himself might well be proud of it . It may be remarked , in passing , that the number of compositions in which the word “
55752	55764	55313	55313	they	1481	” was over - fondled , and human experience referred to as “
55769	56110	55313	55313	they	1481	” was up to the usual average . Now the master , mellow almost to the verge of geniality , put his chair aside , turned his back to the audience , and began to draw a map of America on the blackboard , to exercise the geography class upon . But he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand , and a smothered titter rippled over the house . He knew what the matter was , and set himself to right it . He sponged out lines and remade them ; but he only distorted them more than ever , and the tittering was more pronounced . He threw his entire attention upon his work , now , as if determined not to be put down by the mirth . He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him ; he imagined he was succeeding , and yet the tittering continued ; it even manifestly increased . And well it might . There was a garret above , pierced with a scuttle over his head ; and down through this scuttle came a cat , suspended around the haunches by a string ; she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing ; as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string , she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air . The tittering rose higher and higher — the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher ’s head — down , down , a little lower , and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws , clung to it , and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession ! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master ’s bald pate — for the signpainter ’s boy had _ gilded _ it ! That broke up the meeting . The boys were avenged . Vacation had come . [ * ] NOTE:—The pretended “
56112	56125	55313	55313	they	1481	” quoted in this chapter are taken without alteration from a volume entitled “
56133	56176	55313	55313	they	1481	Lady”—but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl pattern , and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be . CHAPTER XXII Tom joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance , being attracted by the showy character of their “
56179	56868	55313	55313	they	1481	” He promised to abstain from smoking , chewing , and profanity as long as he remained a member . Now he found out a new thing — namely , that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing . Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear ; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order . Fourth of July was coming ; but he soon gave that up — gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty - eight hours — and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer , justice of the peace , who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral , since he was so high an official . During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge ’s condition and hungry for news of it . Sometimes his hopes ran high — so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking - glass . But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating . At last he was pronounced upon the mend — and then convalescent . Tom was disgusted ; and felt a sense of injury , too . He handed in his resignation at once — and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died . Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again . The funeral was a fine thing . The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late member with envy . Tom was a free boy again , however — there was something in that . He could drink and swear , now — but found to his surprise that he did not want to . The simple fact that he could , took the desire away , and the charm of it . Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning to hang a little heavily on his hands . He attempted a diary — but nothing happened during three days , and so he abandoned it . The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town , and made a sensation . Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy for two days . Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure , for it rained hard , there was no procession in consequence , and the greatest man in the world ( as Tom supposed ) , Mr. Benton , an actual United States Senator , proved an overwhelming disappointment — for he was not twenty - five feet high , nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it . A circus came . The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents made of rag carpeting — admission , three pins for boys , two for girls — and then circusing was abandoned . A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came — and went again and left the village duller and drearier than ever . There were some boys - and - girls ’ parties , but they were so few and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder . Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her parents during vacation — so there was no bright side to life anywhere . The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery . It was a very cancer for permanency and pain . Then came the measles . During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner , dead to the world and its happenings . He was very ill , he was interested in nothing . When he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown , a melancholy change had come over everything and every creature . There had been a “
56871	56875	55313	55313	they	1481	” and everybody had “
56879	57395	55313	55313	they	1481	” not only the adults , but even the boys and girls . Tom went about , hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face , but disappointment crossed him everywhere . He found Joe Harper studying a Testament , and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle . He sought Ben Rogers , and found him visiting the poor with a basket of tracts . He hunted up Jim Hollis , who called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning . Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression ; and when , in desperation , he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation , his heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost , forever and forever . And that night there came on a terrific storm , with driving rain , awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning . He covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom ; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him . He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and that this was the result . It might have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery , but there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an insect like himself . By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object . The boy ’s first impulse was to be grateful , and reform . His second was to wait — for there might not be any more storms . The next day the doctors were back ; Tom had relapsed . The three weeks he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age . When he got abroad at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared , remembering how lonely was his estate , how companionless and forlorn he was . He drifted listlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder , in the presence of her victim , a bird . He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a stolen melon . Poor lads ! they — like Tom — had suffered a relapse . CHAPTER XXIII At last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred — and vigorously : the murder trial came on in the court . It became the absorbing topic of village talk immediately . Tom could not get away from it . Every reference to the murder sent a shudder to his heart , for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his hearing as “
57397	57491	57492	57492	Huck	45	” ; he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the murder , but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip . It kept him in a cold shiver all the time . He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him . It would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while ; to divide his burden of distress with another sufferer . Moreover , he wanted to assure himself that Huck had remained discreet . “
57503	57504	57495	57495	you	45	” “
57509	57510	57511	57511	You	45	” “
57515	57516	57511	57511	You	45	” “
57522	57523	57518	57518	I	0	” “
57528	57529	57518	57518	I	0	” “
57544	57545	57541	57541	you	45	” “
57552	57553	57548	57548	I	0	” “
57578	57588	57573	57573	You	46	” Tom felt more comfortable . After a pause : “
57603	57604	57601	57601	they	1484	” “
57635	57636	57628	57628	They	1484	” “
57671	57672	57666	57666	It	1488	” “
57677	57686	57666	57666	It	1488	” So they swore again with dread solemnities . “
57703	57704	57693	57693	Huck	45	” “
57741	57742	57749	57749	they	1484	” “
57772	57773	57764	57764	you	0	” “
57874	57875	57878	57878	he	45	” “
57905	57906	57907	57907	My	0	” “
57933	57934	57927	57927	they	1495	” “
57960	57961	57962	57962	I	0	” “
57994	57995	57972	57972	’em	1496	” “
58024	58025	58019	58019	they	1495	” “
58034	58171	58027	58027	they	1495	” The boys had a long talk , but it brought them little comfort . As the twilight drew on , they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of the little isolated jail , perhaps with an undefined hope that something would happen that might clear away their difficulties . But nothing happened ; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in this luckless captive . The boys did as they had often done before — went to the cell grating and gave Potter some tobacco and matches . He was on the ground floor and there were no guards . His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before — it cut deeper than ever , this time . They felt cowardly and treacherous to the last degree when Potter said : “
58500	58877	58879	58880	the witness	1272	” Tom went home miserable , and his dreams that night were full of horrors . The next day and the day after , he hung about the courtroom , drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in , but forcing himself to stay out . Huck was having the same experience . They studiously avoided each other . Each wandered away , from time to time , but the same dismal fascination always brought them back presently . Tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the courtroom , but invariably heard distressing news — the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor Potter . At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect that Injun Joe ’s evidence stood firm and unshaken , and that there was not the slightest question as to what the jury ’s verdict would be . Tom was out late , that night , and came to bed through the window . He was in a tremendous state of excitement . It was hours before he got to sleep . All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning , for this was to be the great day . Both sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience . After a long wait the jury filed in and took their places ; shortly afterward , Potter , pale and haggard , timid and hopeless , was brought in , with chains upon him , and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him ; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe , stolid as ever . There was another pause , and then the judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court . The usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed . These details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation that was as impressive as it was fascinating . Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing in the brook , at an early hour of the morning that the murder was discovered , and that he immediately sneaked away . After some further questioning , counsel for the prosecution said : “
58882	58902	58909	58909	him	1272	” The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment , but dropped them again when his own counsel said : “
58911	58931	58933	58934	the witness	1272	” The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse . Counsel for the prosecution said : “
58936	58937	58944	58944	him	1272	” “
58946	58967	58938	58938	I	0	” Potter ’s lawyer replied . A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter ’s possession . “
58972	59102	58969	58970	the witness	1272	” Counsel for Potter declined to question him . The faces of the audience began to betray annoyance . Did this attorney mean to throw away his client ’s life without an effort ? Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter ’s guilty behavior when brought to the scene of the murder . They were allowed to leave the stand without being cross - questioned . Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was brought out by credible witnesses , but none of them were cross - examined by Potter ’s lawyer . The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench . Counsel for the prosecution now said : “
59142	59199	59200	59200	Your	1523	” A groan escaped from poor Potter , and he put his face in his hands and rocked his body softly to and fro , while a painful silence reigned in the courtroom . Many men were moved , and many women ’s compassion testified itself in tears . Counsel for the defence rose and said : “
59253	59260	59246	59246	We	1521	” [ Then to the clerk :] “
59265	59320	59321	59322	Thomas Sawyer	46	” A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house , not even excepting Potter ’s . Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand . The boy looked wild enough , for he was badly scared . The oath was administered . “
59339	59401	59246	59246	We	1521	” Tom glanced at Injun Joe ’s iron face and his tongue failed him . The audience listened breathless , but the words refused to come . After a few moments , however , the boy got a little of his strength back , and managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear : “
59406	59407	59246	59246	We	1521	” “
59423	59424	59420	59420	You	46	” “
59429	59440	59420	59420	You	46	” A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe ’s face . “
59450	59451	59454	59454	sir	2078	” “
59456	59457	59454	59454	sir	2078	” “
59471	59472	59469	59469	you	46	” “

59499	59500	59475	59475	I	0	” “
59513	59522	59475	59475	I	0	” Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start . “
59528	59529	59532	59532	sir	2078	” “
59539	59540	59534	59534	I	0	” “
59572	59579	59565	59565	you	46	” Tom hesitated and looked confused . “
59602	59603	59598	59598	you	46	” “
59612	59625	59626	59626	We	1533	” There was a ripple of mirth , which the court checked . “
59663	59746	59750	59751	the doctor	614	” Tom began — hesitatingly at first , but as he warmed to his subject his words flowed more and more easily ; in a little while every sound ceased but his own voice ; every eye fixed itself upon him ; with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his words , taking no note of time , rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale . The strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said : “
59769	60209	59761	59762	Injun Joe	100	” Crash ! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window , tore his way through all opposers , and was gone ! CHAPTER XXIV Tom was a glittering hero once more — the pet of the old , the envy of the young . His name even went into immortal print , for the village paper magnified him . There were some that believed he would be President , yet , if he escaped hanging . As usual , the fickle , unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before . But that sort of conduct is to the world ’s credit ; therefore it is not well to find fault with it . Tom ’s days were days of splendor and exultation to him , but his nights were seasons of horror . Injun Joe infested all his dreams , and always with doom in his eye . Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall . Poor Huck was in the same state of wretchedness and terror , for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day of the trial , and Huck was sore afraid that his share in the business might leak out , yet , notwithstanding Injun Joe ’s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court . The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy , but what of that ? Since Tom ’s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer ’s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths , Huck ’s confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated . Daily Muff Potter ’s gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken ; but nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue . Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured ; the other half he was afraid he would be . He felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse . Rewards had been offered , the country had been scoured , but no Injun Joe was found . One of those omniscient and awe - inspiring marvels , a detective , came up from St. Louis , moused around , shook his head , looked wise , and made that sort of astounding success which members of that craft usually achieve . That is to say , he “
60214	60221	59761	59762	Injun Joe	100	” But you ca n’t hang a “
60223	60398	59750	59751	the doctor	614	” for murder , and so after that detective had got through and gone home , Tom felt just as insecure as he was before . The slow days drifted on , and each left behind it a slightly lightened weight of apprehension . CHAPTER XXV There comes a time in every rightly - constructed boy ’s life when he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure . This desire suddenly came upon Tom one day . He sallied out to find Joe Harper , but failed of success . Next he sought Ben Rogers ; he had gone fishing . Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red - Handed . Huck would answer . Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially . Huck was willing . Huck was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital , for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is not money . “
60404	60408	59750	59751	the doctor	614	” said Huck . “
60414	60415	59750	59751	the doctor	614	” “

61219	61264	61215	61215	I	0	” So they got a crippled pick and a shovel , and set out on their three - mile tramp . They arrived hot and panting , and threw themselves down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke . “
61269	61273	61265	61265	I	0	” said Tom . “

61603	61604	61600	61601	a girl	438	” “

61698	61723	61725	61725	they	1576	” They worked and sweated for half an hour . No result . They toiled another halfhour . Still no result . Huck said : “
61734	61735	61725	61725	they	1576	” “
61754	61807	61744	61744	I	0	” So they chose a new spot and began again . The labor dragged a little , but still they made progress . They pegged away in silence for some time . Finally Huck leaned on his shovel , swabbed the beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve , and said : “
61821	61822	61809	61809	you	46	” “
61845	61846	61823	61823	I	0	” “

61918	61934	61906	61906	It	1582	” That was satisfactory . The work went on . By and by Huck said : “

62158	62323	62136	62136	I	0	” The boys were there that night , about the appointed time . They sat in the shadow waiting . It was a lonely place , and an hour made solemn by old traditions . Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves , ghosts lurked in the murky nooks , the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance , an owl answered with his sepulchral note . The boys were subdued by these solemnities , and talked little . By and by they judged that twelve had come ; they marked where the shadow fell , and began to dig . Their hopes commenced to rise . Their interest grew stronger , and their industry kept pace with it . The hole deepened and still deepened , but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something , they only suffered a new disappointment . It was only a stone or a chunk . At last Tom said : “
62337	62338	62332	62332	we	1588	” “
62358	62359	62350	62350	We	1588	” “

62398	62404	62330	62330	Huck	45	” Huck dropped his shovel . “
62409	62413	62330	62330	Huck	45	” said he . “

62684	62693	62653	62653	Tom	46	” Tom considered awhile ; and then said : “
62702	62703	62707	62707	I	0	” “
62786	62787	62771	62771	I	0	” “

62995	63018	62988	62988	I	0	” They had started down the hill by this time . There in the middle of the moonlit valley below them stood the “
63020	63168	62988	62988	I	0	” house , utterly isolated , its fences gone long ago , rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps , the chimney crumbled to ruin , the window - sashes vacant , a corner of the roof caved in . The boys gazed awhile , half expecting to see a blue light flit past a window ; then talking in a low tone , as befitted the time and the circumstances , they struck far off to the right , to give the haunted house a wide berth , and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill . CHAPTER XXVI About noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree ; they had come for their tools . Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house ; Huck was measurably so , also — but suddenly said : “
63181	63205	63206	63206	My	0	” Tom mentally ran over the days of the week , and then quickly lifted his eyes with a startled look in them — “
63217	63218	63215	63215	Huck	45	” “
63239	63240	63252	63252	Huck	45	” “
63273	63274	63254	63254	We	1613	” “
63299	63300	63301	63302	Any fool	1614	” “
63323	63324	63321	63321	Huck	45	” “
63357	63358	63344	63344	I	0	” “
63370	63371	63367	63367	they	1616	” “
63374	63375	63367	63367	they	1616	” “
63438	63439	63433	63434	Robin Hood	91	” “
63447	63448	63444	63445	Robin Hood	91	” “

63673	63674	63668	63668	I	0	” “
63679	64136	63668	63668	I	0	” So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon , now and then casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrow ’s prospects and possibilities there . As the sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill . On Saturday , shortly after noon , the boys were at the dead tree again . They had a smoke and a chat in the shade , and then dug a little in their last hole , not with great hope , but merely because Tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it , and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel . The thing failed this time , however , so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune , but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure - hunting . When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun , and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place , that they were afraid , for a moment , to venture in . Then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep . They saw a weedgrown , floorless room , unplastered , an ancient fireplace , vacant windows , a ruinous staircase ; and here , there , and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs . They presently entered , softly , with quickened pulses , talking in whispers , ears alert to catch the slightest sound , and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat . In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical and interested examination , rather admiring their own boldness , and wondering at it , too . Next they wanted to look upstairs . This was something like cutting off retreat , but they got to daring each other , and of course there could be but one result — they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent . Up there were the same signs of decay . In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery , but the promise was a fraud — there was nothing in it . Their courage was up now and well in hand . They were about to go down and begin work when — “
64139	64143	63668	63668	I	0	” said Tom . “
64148	64156	63668	63668	I	0	” whispered Huck , blanching with fright . “
64166	64167	64243	64243	Huck	45	” “
64179	64180	64173	64173	my	0	” “
64197	64224	64189	64189	They	1634	” The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to knotholes in the planking , and lay waiting , in a misery of fear . “
64256	64267	64243	64243	Huck	45	” Two men entered . Each boy said to himself : “
64292	64293	64270	64275	the old deaf and dumb Spaniard	1635	” “
64295	64345	64243	64243	Huck	45	” was a ragged , unkempt creature , with nothing very pleasant in his face . The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape ; he had bushy white whiskers ; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero , and he wore green goggles . When they came in , “
64347	64394	64243	64243	Huck	45	” was talking in a low voice ; they sat down on the ground , facing the door , with their backs to the wall , and the speaker continued his remarks . His manner became less guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded : “
64397	64401	64243	64243	Huck	45	” said he , “
64420	64421	64243	64243	Huck	45	” “
64424	64427	64243	64243	Huck	45	” grunted the “
64431	64442	64443	64443	Milksop	153	” Spaniard — to the vast surprise of the boys . “
64445	64472	64443	64443	Milksop	153	” This voice made the boys gasp and quake . It was Injun Joe ’s ! There was silence for some time . Then Joe said : “
64491	64492	64443	64443	Milksop	153	” “
64527	64528	64576	64576	I	0	” “
64548	64549	64550	64550	I	0	” “
64608	64609	64610	64612	Those infernal boys	1641	” “
64613	64677	64610	64612	Those infernal boys	1641	” quaked again under the inspiration of this remark , and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and concluded to wait a day . They wished in their hearts they had waited a year . The two men got out some food and made a luncheon . After a long and thoughtful silence , Injun Joe said : “
64752	64769	64770	64770	I	0	” This was satisfactory . Both men presently fell to yawning , and Injun Joe said : “
64783	64841	64778	64778	your	1644	” He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore . His comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet . Presently the watcher began to nod ; his head drooped lower and lower , both men began to snore now . The boys drew a long , grateful breath . Tom whispered : “
64849	64853	64854	64854	I	0	” Huck said : “
64865	64990	64857	64857	I’d	0	” Tom urged — Huck held back . At last Tom rose slowly and softly , and started alone . But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright . He never made a second attempt . The boys lay there counting the dragging moments till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray ; and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting . Now one snore ceased . Injun Joe sat up , stared around — smiled grimly upon his comrade , whose head was drooping upon his knees — stirred him up with his foot and said : “
65013	65014	65015	65015	My	0	” “
65022	65023	65015	65015	My	0	” “
65053	65054	65055	65055	I	0	” “
65094	65095	65116	65116	I	0	” “
65111	65112	65116	65116	I	0	” “
65133	65134	65116	65116	I	0	” “
65182	65183	65350	65350	you	1654	” “
65187	65345	65350	65350	you	1654	” said the comrade , who walked across the room , knelt down , raised one of the rearward hearth - stones and took out a bag that jingled pleasantly . He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as much for Injun Joe , and passed the bag to the latter , who was on his knees in the corner , now , digging with his bowie - knife . The boys forgot all their fears , all their miseries in an instant . With gloating eyes they watched every movement . Luck!—the splendor of it was beyond all imagination ! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make half a dozen boys rich ! Here was treasure - hunting under the happiest auspices — there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig . They nudged each other every moment — eloquent nudges and easily understood , for they simply meant—“Oh
65359	65367	65350	65350	you	1654	” Joe ’s knife struck upon something . “
65370	65374	65350	65350	you	1654	” said he . “
65379	65384	65350	65350	you	1654	” said his comrade . “
65424	65435	65418	65418	I	0	” He reached his hand in and drew it out — “
65442	65474	65475	65475	We	1651	” The two men examined the handful of coins . They were gold . The boys above were as excited as themselves , and as delighted . Joe ’s comrade said : “
65510	65588	65503	65503	I	0	” He ran and brought the boys ’ pick and shovel . Injun Joe took the pick , looked it over critically , shook his head , muttered something to himself , and then began to use it . The box was soon unearthed . It was not very large ; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured it . The men contemplated the treasure awhile in blissful silence . “
65598	65603	65503	65503	I	0	” said Injun Joe . “
65620	65625	65609	65609	Murrel	154	” the stranger observed . “
65630	65635	65626	65626	I	0	” said Injun Joe ; “
65646	65647	65642	65642	I	0	” “
65658	65666	65667	65667	You	0	” The halfbreed frowned . Said he : “
65694	65704	65705	65705	I	0	” and a wicked light flamed in his eyes . “
65739	65740	65734	65734	you	0	” “
65759	65760	65774	65776	the great Sachem	155	” “
65876	65877	65868	65868	We	1659	” “
65895	65896	65890	65890	You	0	” “
65915	65916	65890	65890	You	0	” “
65928	65948	65890	65890	You	0	” Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping out . Presently he said : “
65965	66073	65958	65958	you	2054	” The boys ’ breath forsook them . Injun Joe put his hand on his knife , halted a moment , undecided , and then turned toward the stairway . The boys thought of the closet , but their strength was gone . The steps came creaking up the stairs — the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads — they were about to spring for the closet , when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway . He gathered himself up cursing , and his comrade said : “
66177	66332	66172	66172	they	203	” Joe grumbled awhile ; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving . Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight , and moved toward the river with their precious box . Tom and Huck rose up , weak but vastly relieved , and stared after them through the chinks between the logs of the house . Follow ? Not they . They were content to reach ground again without broken necks , and take the townward track over the hill . They did not talk much . They were too much absorbed in hating themselves — hating the ill luck that made them take the spade and the pick there . But for that , Injun Joe never would have suspected . He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till his “
66334	66395	66418	66418	he	1670	” was satisfied , and then he would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing . Bitter , bitter luck that the tools were ever brought there ! They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job , and follow him to “
66399	66413	66418	66418	he	1670	” wherever that might be . Then a ghastly thought occurred to Tom . “
66426	66427	66424	66424	Huck	45	” “
66433	66680	66424	66424	Huck	45	” said Huck , nearly fainting . They talked it all over , and as they entered town they agreed to believe that he might possibly mean somebody else — at least that he might at least mean nobody but Tom , since only Tom had testified . Very , very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger ! Company would be a palpable improvement , he thought . CHAPTER XXVII The adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom ’s dreams that night . Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune . As he lay in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure , he noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away — somewhat as if they had happened in another world , or in a time long gone by . Then it occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream ! There was one very strong argument in favor of this idea — namely , that the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real . He had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before , and he was like all boys of his age and station in life , in that he imagined that all references to “
66682	66684	66418	66418	he	1670	” and “
66686	66882	66424	66424	Huck	45	” were mere fanciful forms of speech , and that no such sums really existed in the world . He never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one ’s possession . If his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed , they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague , splendid , ungraspable dollars . But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the attrition of thinking them over , and so he presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream , after all . This uncertainty must be swept away . He would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find Huck . Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat , listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy . Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject . If he did not do it , then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream . “
66887	66888	66885	66885	Huck	45	” “
66893	66900	66891	66891	yourself	45	” Silence , for a minute . “
66934	66935	66961	66961	Huck	45	” “
66963	66964	66961	66961	Huck	45	” “
66971	66972	66961	66961	Huck	45	” “
66986	66987	66979	66979	I	0	” “
67034	67035	67040	67040	him	45	” “
67051	67052	67053	67053	Tom	46	” “
67094	67095	67090	67090	him	45	” “
67121	67122	67117	67117	his	45	” “
67155	67156	67157	67157	I	0	” “
67178	67179	67167	67167	Huck	45	” “
67213	67214	67206	67206	They	1677	” “
67243	67244	67240	67240	you	46	” “
67265	67266	67267	67267	You	46	” “
67277	67418	67274	67274	I	0	” Tom was off at once . He did not care to have Huck ’s company in public places . He was gone half an hour . He found that in the best tavern , No . 2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer , and was still so occupied . In the less ostentatious house , No . 2 was a mystery . The tavern - keeper ’s young son said it was kept locked all the time , and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night ; he did not know any particular reason for this state of things ; had had some little curiosity , but it was rather feeble ; had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was “
67420	67435	67274	67274	I	0	” ; had noticed that there was a light in there the night before . “
67459	67460	67461	67461	I	0	” “
67475	67476	67470	67470	you	46	” “
67480	67491	67470	67470	you	46	” Tom thought a long time . Then he said : “
67625	67626	67627	67627	Lordy	95	” “
67639	67640	67627	67627	Lordy	95	” “
67669	67670	67663	67663	he	100	” “
67695	67696	67691	67691	I	0	” “
67735	67736	67713	67713	he	100	” “
67758	67759	67756	67756	jingoes	2289	” “
67780	67870	67776	67776	I	0	” CHAPTER XXVIII That night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure . They hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine , one watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door . Nobody entered the alley or left it ; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern door . The night promised to be a fair one ; so Tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on , Huck was to come and “
67873	68223	67776	67776	I	0	” whereupon he would slip out and try the keys . But the night remained clear , and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve . Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck . Also Wednesday . But Thursday night promised better . Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt ’s old tin lantern , and a large towel to blindfold it with . He hid the lantern in Huck ’s sugar hogshead and the watch began . An hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights ( the only ones thereabouts ) were put out . No Spaniard had been seen . Nobody had entered or left the alley . Everything was auspicious . The blackness of darkness reigned , the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder . Tom got his lantern , lit it in the hogshead , wrapped it closely in the towel , and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern . Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley . Then there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck ’s spirits like a mountain . He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern — it would frighten him , but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive yet . It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared . Surely he must have fainted ; maybe he was dead ; maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement . In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley ; fearing all sorts of dreadful things , and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath . There was not much to take away , for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls , and his heart would soon wear itself out , the way it was beating . Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came tearing by him : “
68226	68230	68234	68234	your	1696	” said he ; “
68237	68313	68314	68314	Huck	45	” He need n’t have repeated it ; once was enough ; Huck was making thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered . The boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter - house at the lower end of the village . Just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down . As soon as Tom got his breath he said : “
68412	68413	68393	68393	I	0	” “
68420	68421	68422	68422	Huck	45	” “
68433	68434	68424	68424	I	0	” “
68437	68438	68424	68424	I	0	” “
68465	68466	68460	68460	his	100	” “
68479	68480	68460	68460	his	100	” “
68499	68500	68491	68491	I	0	” “
68515	68516	68512	68512	I	0	” “
68534	68535	68541	68541	you	46	” “
68546	68547	68548	68548	Huck	45	” “
68621	68622	68607	68607	you	45	” “
68625	68626	68607	68607	you	45	” “
68652	68653	68650	68650	Huck	45	” “
68695	68696	68690	68691	Injun Joe	100	” “
68706	68710	68702	68702	You	46	” Huck shuddered . “
68719	68720	68715	68715	I	0	” “
68756	68770	68751	68751	I	0	” There was a long pause for reflection , and then Tom said : “
68831	68832	68823	68823	we	1703	” “
68868	68869	68858	68858	you	46	” “
68911	68912	68898	68898	you	46	” “
68920	68921	68898	68898	you	46	” “
68960	68961	68962	68962	I	0	” “
68997	68998	68990	68990	I	0	” “
69012	69013	69015	69016	Ben Rogers	57	” “
69137	69138	69126	69126	he	2452	” “
69183	69251	69126	69126	he	2452	” CHAPTER XXIX The first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of news — Judge Thatcher ’s family had come back to town the night before . Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment , and Becky took the chief place in the boy ’s interest . He saw her and they had an exhausting good time playing “
69253	69255	69126	69126	he	2452	” and “
69259	69367	69126	69126	he	2452	” with a crowd of their schoolmates . The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way : Becky teased her mother to appoint the next day for the long - promised and long - delayed picnic , and she consented . The child ’s delight was boundless ; and Tom ’s not more moderate . The invitations were sent out before sunset , and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation . Tom ’s excitement enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late hour , and he had good hopes of hearing Huck ’s “
69370	69529	69126	69126	he	2452	” and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers with , next day ; but he was disappointed . No signal came that night . Morning came , eventually , and by ten or eleven o’clock a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher ’s , and everything was ready for a start . It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence . The children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty - three or thereabouts . The old steam ferry - boat was chartered for the occasion ; presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision - baskets . Sid was sick and had to miss the fun ; Mary remained at home to entertain him . The last thing Mrs. Thatcher said to Becky , was : “
69560	69561	69546	69556	some of the girls that live near the ferry - landing	1712	” “
69572	69573	69567	69568	Susy Harper	128	” “
69589	69602	69605	69605	I’ll	1717	” Presently , as they tripped along , Tom said to Becky : “
69665	69666	69656	69656	she	1720	” “
69674	69683	69656	69656	she	1720	” Then Becky reflected a moment and said : “
69690	69691	69687	69687	mamma	1716	” “
69698	69713	69694	69694	she	1720	” The girl turned the idea over in her mind , and said reluctantly : “
69722	69723	69714	69714	I	0	” “
69777	70040	69774	69774	she	2405	” The Widow Douglas ’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait . It and Tom ’s persuasions presently carried the day . So it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the night ’s programme . Presently it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal . The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations . Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas ’ . And why should he give it up , he reasoned — the signal did not come the night before , so why should it be any more likely to come tonight ? The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure ; and , boy - like , he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day . Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow and tied up . The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter . All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with , and by - and - by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites , and then the destruction of the good things began . After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks . By - and - by somebody shouted : “
70048	70377	69774	69774	she	2405	” Everybody was . Bundles of candles were procured , and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill . The mouth of the cave was up the hillside — an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred . Within was a small chamber , chilly as an icehouse , and walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat . It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun . But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off , and the romping began again . The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it ; a struggle and a gallant defence followed , but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out , and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase . But all things have an end . By - and - by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue , the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead . This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide . Every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand — for McDougal ’s cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere . It was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms , and never find the end of the cave ; and that he might go down , and down , and still down , into the earth , and it was just the same — labyrinth under labyrinth , and no end to any of them . No man “
70379	70491	69741	69741	she	2405	” the cave . That was an impossible thing . Most of the young men knew a portion of it , and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion . Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one . The procession moved along the main avenue some three - quarters of a mile , and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues , fly along the dismal corridors , and take each other by surprise at points where the corridors joined again . Parties were able to elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the “
70493	71283	71285	71285	her	1724	” ground . By - and - by , one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the cave , panting , hilarious , smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings , daubed with clay , and entirely delighted with the success of the day . Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at hand . The clanging bell had been calling for half an hour . However , this sort of close to the day ’s adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory . When the ferryboat with her wild freight pushed into the stream , nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the craft . Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat ’s lights went glinting past the wharf . He heard no noise on board , for the young people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death . He wondered what boat it was , and why she did not stop at the wharf — and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his attention upon his business . The night was growing cloudy and dark . Ten o’clock came , and the noise of vehicles ceased , scattered lights began to wink out , all straggling foot - passengers disappeared , the village betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts . Eleven o’clock came , and the tavern lights were put out ; darkness everywhere , now . Huck waited what seemed a weary long time , but nothing happened . His faith was weakening . Was there any use ? Was there really any use ? Why not give it up and turn in ? A noise fell upon his ear . He was all attention in an instant . The alley door closed softly . He sprang to the corner of the brick store . The next moment two men brushed by him , and one seemed to have something under his arm . It must be that box ! So they were going to remove the treasure . Why call Tom now ? It would be absurd — the men would get away with the box and never be found again . No , he would stick to their wake and follow them ; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery . So communing with himself , Huck stepped out and glided along behind the men , cat - like , with bare feet , allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible . They moved up the river street three blocks , then turned to the left up a crossstreet . They went straight ahead , then , until they came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill ; this they took . They passed by the old Welshman ’s house , halfway up the hill , without hesitating , and still climbed upward . Good , thought Huck , they will bury it in the old quarry . But they never stopped at the quarry . They passed on , up the summit . They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes , and were at once hidden in the gloom . Huck closed up and shortened his distance , now , for they would never be able to see him . He trotted along awhile ; then slackened his pace , fearing he was gaining too fast ; moved on a piece , then stopped altogether ; listened ; no sound ; none , save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart . The hooting of an owl came over the hill — ominous sound ! But no footsteps . Heavens , was everything lost ! He was about to spring with winged feet , when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him ! Huck ’s heart shot into his throat , but he swallowed it again ; and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once , and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground . He knew where he was . He knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas ’ grounds . Very well , he thought , let them bury it there ; it wo n’t be hard to find . Now there was a voice — a very low voice — Injun Joe ’s : “
71302	71303	71304	71304	I	0	” “
71310	71340	71304	71304	I	0	” This was that stranger ’s voice — the stranger of the haunted house . A deadly chill went to Huck ’s heart — this , then , was the “
71342	71427	71462	71462	I	0	” job ! His thought was , to fly . Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than once , and maybe these men were going to murder her . He wished he dared venture to warn her ; but he knew he did n’t dare — they might come and catch him . He thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed between the stranger ’s remark and Injun Joe ’s next — which was — “
71449	71450	71447	71447	you	1726	” “
71470	71471	71462	71462	I	0	” “
71610	71611	71600	71600	I	0	” “
71624	71625	71600	71600	I	0	” “
71685	71686	71677	71677	you	1726	” “
71693	71694	71677	71677	you	1726	” “
71808	71809	71796	71796	I	0	” “
71837	71838	71831	71831	I’m	0	” “
71878	72086	72125	72126	Huckleberry Finn	45	” Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue — a thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk ; so he held his breath and stepped gingerly back ; planted his foot carefully and firmly , after balancing , one - legged , in a precarious way and almost toppling over , first on one side and then on the other . He took another step back , with the same elaboration and the same risks ; then another and another , and — a twig snapped under his foot ! His breath stopped and he listened . There was no sound — the stillness was perfect . His gratitude was measureless . Now he turned in his tracks , between the walls of sumach bushes — turned himself as carefully as if he were a ship — and then stepped quickly but cautiously along . When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure , and so he picked up his nimble heels and flew . Down , down he sped , till he reached the Welshman ’s . He banged at the door , and presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows . “
72102	72103	72099	72099	you	1742	” “
72115	72116	72110	72110	I	0	” “
72123	72124	72125	72126	Huckleberry Finn	45	” “
72134	72135	72136	72137	Huckleberry Finn	45	” “
72170	72171	72203	72204	the widow	1578	” “
72181	72192	72177	72177	I	0	” were Huck ’s first words when he got in . “
72237	72238	72219	72219	I	0	” “
72258	72264	72252	72252	he	45	” exclaimed the old man ; “
72276	72439	72269	72269	nobody	647	” Three minutes later the old man and his sons , well armed , were up the hill , and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe , their weapons in their hands . Huck accompanied them no further . He hid behind a great bowlder and fell to listening . There was a lagging , anxious silence , and then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry . Huck waited for no particulars . He sprang away and sped down the hill as fast as his legs could carry him . CHAPTER XXX As the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning , Huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman ’s door . The inmates were asleep , but it was a sleep that was set on a hair - trigger , on account of the exciting episode of the night . A call came from a window : “
72444	72455	72269	72269	nobody	647	” Huck ’s scared voice answered in a low tone : “
72467	72468	72464	72465	Huck Finn	45	” “
72485	72551	72464	72465	Huck Finn	45	” These were strange words to the vagabond boy ’s ears , and the pleasantest he had ever heard . He could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before . The door was quickly unlocked , and he entered . Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves . “
72610	72611	72597	72598	the boys	2054	” “
72617	72621	72612	72612	I	0	” said Huck , “
72681	72682	72665	72665	I	0	” “
73015	73016	73010	73010	lad	1644	” “
73028	73029	73020	73020	I	0	” “
73041	73042	73043	73043	One	934	” “
73070	73071	73063	73068	a mean - looking , ragged	1772	” “
73119	73140	73110	73111	the sheriff	880	” The Welshman ’s sons departed at once . As they were leaving the room Huck sprang up and exclaimed : “
73161	73162	73151	73151	me	0	” “
73184	73185	73181	73181	you	0	” “
73196	73209	73210	73210	They	810	” When the young men were gone , the old Welshman said : “
73229	73289	73224	73224	you	0	” Huck would not explain , further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole world — he would be killed for knowing it , sure . The old man promised secrecy once more , and said : “
73306	73322	73302	73302	they	1779	” Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply . Then he said : “
73524	73525	73516	73522	a rusty , ragged - looking devil	1790	” “
73538	73550	73527	73527	you	0	” This staggered Huck for a moment . Then he said : “
73567	73568	73564	73564	I	0	” “
73577	73578	73575	73575	you	0	” “
73643	73644	73629	73629	he	1794	” “
73658	73739	73647	73653	The _ deaf and dumb _ man	1796	” Huck had made another terrible mistake ! He was trying his best to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be , and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do . He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape , but the old man ’s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder . Presently the Welshman said : “
73832	73854	73857	73858	a Spaniard	1801	” Huck looked into the old man ’s honest eyes a moment , then bent over and whispered in his ear : “
73865	73881	73863	73863	Joe	100	” The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair . In a moment he said : “
73930	73993	74105	74105	burglar	1803	” During breakfast the talk went on , and in the course of it the old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done , before going to bed , was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood . They found none , but captured a bulky bundle of — “
73999	74059	74105	74105	burglar	1803	” If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more stunning suddenness from Huck ’s blanched lips . His eyes were staring wide , now , and his breath suspended — waiting for the answer . The Welshman started — stared in return — three seconds — five seconds — ten — then replied : “
74076	74102	74105	74105	burglar	1803	” Huck sank back , panting gently , but deeply , unutterably grateful . The Welshman eyed him gravely , curiously — and presently said : “
74136	74199	74129	74129	you	1534	” Huck was in a close place — the inquiring eye was upon him — he would have given anything for material for a plausible answer — nothing suggested itself — the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper — a senseless reply offered — there was no time to weigh it , so at a venture he uttered it — feebly : “
74207	74268	74129	74129	you	1534	” Poor Huck was too distressed to smile , but the old man laughed loud and joyously , shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot , and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a man ’s pocket , because it cut down the doctor ’s bill like everything . Then he added : “
74319	74600	74316	74316	I	0	” Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a suspicious excitement , for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure , as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow ’s stile . He had only thought it was not the treasure , however — he had not known that it wasn’t — and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self - possession . But on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened , for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not _ the _ bundle , and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable . In fact , everything seemed to be drifting just in the right direction , now ; the treasure must be still in No . 2 , the men would be captured and jailed that day , and he and Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption . Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door . Huck jumped for a hiding - place , for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the late event . The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen , among them the Widow Douglas , and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill — to stare at the stile . So the news had spread . The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors . The widow ’s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken . “
74652	74713	74714	74714	I	0	” Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matter — but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors , and through them be transmitted to the whole town , for he refused to part with his secret . When all else had been learned , the widow said : “
74738	74739	74732	74732	you	0	” “
74802	74891	74796	74796	They	1814	” More visitors came , and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of hours more . There was no Sabbath - school during day - school vacation , but everybody was early at church . The stirring event was well canvassed . News came that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered . When the sermon was finished , Judge Thatcher ’s wife dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said : “
74911	74912	74904	74904	she	86	” “
74916	74917	74904	74904	she	86	” “
74920	74924	74925	74925	she	86	” with a startled look—“didn’t
74932	74933	74925	74925	she	86	” “
74938	74968	74925	74925	she	86	” Mrs. Thatcher turned pale , and sank into a pew , just as Aunt Polly , talking briskly with a friend , passed by . Aunt Polly said : “
75023	75036	75037	75037	He	46	” Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever . “
75044	75064	75037	75037	He	46	” said Mrs. Harper , beginning to look uneasy . A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly ’s face . “
75076	75077	75069	75069	you	62	” “
75080	75081	75069	75069	you	62	” “
75089	75351	75084	75084	you	62	” Joe tried to remember , but was not sure he could say . The people had stopped moving out of church . Whispers passed along , and a boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance . Children were anxiously questioned , and young teachers . They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip ; it was dark ; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing . One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave ! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away . Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her hands . The alarm swept from lip to lip , from group to group , from street to street , and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the whole town was up ! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant insignificance , the burglars were forgotten , horses were saddled , skiffs were manned , the ferryboat ordered out , and before the horror was half an hour old , two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward the cave . All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead . Many women visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them . They cried with them , too , and that was still better than words . All the tedious night the town waited for news ; but when the morning dawned at last , all the word that came was , “
75360	75511	75084	75084	you	62	” Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed ; and Aunt Polly , also . Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave , but they conveyed no real cheer . The old Welshman came home toward daylight , spattered with candle - grease , smeared with clay , and almost worn out . He found Huck still in the bed that had been provided for him , and delirious with fever . The physicians were all at the cave , so the Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient . She said she would do her best by him , because , whether he was good , bad , or indifferent , he was the Lord ’s , and nothing that was the Lord ’s was a thing to be neglected . The Welshman said Huck had good spots in him , and the widow said : “
75548	75664	75665	75665	BECKY	86	” Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village , but the strongest of the citizens continued searching . All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited before ; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched ; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages , lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance , and shoutings and pistol - shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles . In one place , far from the section usually traversed by tourists , the names “
75670	75910	75665	75665	BECKY	86	” had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle - smoke , and near at hand a grease - soiled bit of ribbon . Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it . She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child ; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious , because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came . Some said that now and then , in the cave , a far - away speck of light would glimmer , and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle — and then a sickening disappointment always followed ; the children were not there ; it was only a searcher ’s light . Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along , and the village sank into a hopeless stupor . No one had heart for anything . The accidental discovery , just made , that the proprietor of the Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises , scarcely fluttered the public pulse , tremendous as the fact was . In a lucid interval , Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns , and finally asked — dimly dreading the worst — if anything had been discovered at the Temperance Tavern since he had been ill . “
75913	75928	75665	75665	BECKY	86	” said the widow . Huck started up in bed , wild - eyed : “
75935	75936	75993	75993	child	2139	” “
75958	75959	75953	75953	you	1827	” “
75981	75988	75975	75976	Tom Sawyer	46	” The widow burst into tears . “
76017	76092	76095	76095	he	46	” Then nothing but liquor had been found ; there would have been a great powwow if it had been the gold . So the treasure was gone forever — gone forever ! But what could she be crying about ? Curious that she should cry . These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck ’s mind , and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep . The widow said to herself : “
76142	76190	76808	76808	Becky	86	” CHAPTER XXXI Now to return to Tom and Becky ’s share in the picnic . They tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company , visiting the familiar wonders of the cave — wonders dubbed with rather over - descriptive names , such as “
76196	76197	76808	76808	Becky	86	” “
76201	76202	76808	76808	Becky	86	” “
76207	76780	76808	76808	Becky	86	” and so on . Presently the hide - and - seek frolicking began , and Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome ; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names , dates , postoffice addresses , and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed ( in candle - smoke ) . Still drifting along and talking , they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed . They smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on . Presently they came to a place where a little stream of water , trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it , had , in the slow - dragging ages , formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone . Tom squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky ’s gratification . He found that it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls , and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him . Becky responded to his call , and they made a smoke - mark for future guidance , and started upon their quest . They wound this way and that , far down into the secret depths of the cave , made another mark , and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about . In one place they found a spacious cavern , from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man ’s leg ; they walked all about it , wondering and admiring , and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it . This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring , whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals ; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together , the result of the ceaseless water - drip of centuries . Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together , thousands in a bunch ; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds , squeaking and darting furiously at the candles . Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct . He seized Becky ’s hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered ; and none too soon , for a bat struck Becky ’s light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern . The bats chased the children a good distance ; but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered , and at last got rid of the perilous things . Tom found a subterranean lake , shortly , which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows . He wanted to explore its borders , but concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile , first . Now , for the first time , the deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children . Becky said : “
76802	76803	76795	76795	I	0	” “
76845	76850	76842	76842	them	1832	” Becky grew apprehensive . “
76868	76869	76863	76863	We	1831	” “
76881	76882	76872	76872	I	0	” “
76902	76903	76904	76904	I	0	” “
76944	76945	77173	77173	Tom	46	” “
76963	77039	77173	77173	Tom	46	” and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities . They started through a corridor , and traversed it in silence a long way , glancing at each new opening , to see if there was anything familiar about the look of it ; but they were all strange . Every time Tom made an examination , Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign , and he would say cheerily : “
77062	77103	77261	77261	Tom	46	” But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure , and presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random , in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted . He still said it was “
77107	77134	77261	77261	Tom	46	” but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said , “
77139	77170	77261	77261	Tom	46	” Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear , and tried hard to keep back the tears , but they would come . At last she said : “
77199	77200	77187	77187	We	1831	” “
77203	77252	77187	77187	We	1831	” said he . Profound silence ; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush . Tom shouted . The call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter . “
77268	77272	77261	77261	Tom	46	” said Becky . “
77291	77298	77283	77283	they	1833	” and he shouted again . The “
77300	77373	77283	77283	they	1833	” was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter , it so confessed a perishing hope . The children stood still and listened ; but there was no result . Tom turned upon the back track at once , and hurried his steps . It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky — he could not find his way back ! “
77385	77386	77387	77387	Becky	86	” “
77424	77425	77426	77426	Tom	46	” “
77460	77998	78021	78021	I	0	” She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die , or lose her reason . He sat down by her and put his arms around her ; she buried her face in his bosom , she clung to him , she poured out her terrors , her unavailing regrets , and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter . Tom begged her to pluck up hope again , and she said she could not . He fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation ; this had a better effect . She said she would try to hope again , she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more . For he was no more to blame than she , she said . So they moved on again — aimlessly — simply at random — all they could do was to move , keep moving . For a little while , hope made a show of reviving — not with any reason to back it , but only because it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure . By - and - by Tom took Becky ’s candle and blew it out . This economy meant so much ! Words were not needed . Becky understood , and her hope died again . She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets — yet he must economize . By - and - by , fatigue began to assert its claims ; the children tried to pay attention , for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious , moving , in some direction , in any direction , was at least progress and might bear fruit ; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit . At last Becky ’s frail limbs refused to carry her farther . She sat down . Tom rested with her , and they talked of home , and the friends there , and the comfortable beds and , above all , the light ! Becky cried , and Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her , but all his encouragements were grown thread - bare with use , and sounded like sarcasms . Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep . Tom was grateful . He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams ; and by - and - by a smile dawned and rested there . The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit , and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories . While he was deep in his musings , Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh — but it was stricken dead upon her lips , and a groan followed it . “
78039	78040	78032	78032	I	0	” “
78065	78066	78067	78067	We	1838	” “
78092	78093	78085	78085	I	0	” “
78112	78285	78286	78286	Tom	46	” They rose up and wandered along , hand in hand and hopeless . They tried to estimate how long they had been in the cave , but all they knew was that it seemed days and weeks , and yet it was plain that this could not be , for their candles were not gone yet . A long time after this — they could not tell how long — Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water — they must find a spring . They found one presently , and Tom said it was time to rest again . Both were cruelly tired , yet Becky said she thought she could go a little farther . She was surprised to hear Tom dissent . She could not understand it . They sat down , and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay . Thought was soon busy ; nothing was said for some time . Then Becky broke the silence : “
78293	78302	78286	78286	Tom	46	” Tom took something out of his pocket . “
78308	78316	78304	78304	you	0	” said he . Becky almost smiled . “
78326	78327	78324	78324	Tom	46	” “
78348	78349	78350	78350	I	0	” “
78380	78442	78443	78443	Becky	86	” She dropped the sentence where it was . Tom divided the cake and Becky ate with good appetite , while Tom nibbled at his moiety . There was abundance of cold water to finish the feast with . By - and - by Becky suggested that they move on again . Tom was silent a moment . Then he said : “
78455	78467	78450	78450	I	0	” Becky ’s face paled , but she thought she could . “
78494	78522	78523	78523	Tom	46	” Becky gave loose to tears and wailings . Tom did what he could to comfort her , but with little effect . At length Becky said : “

78643	78986	78631	78632	your mother	2405	” A frightened look in Becky ’s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw that he had made a blunder . Becky was not to have gone home that night ! The children became silent and thoughtful . In a moment a new burst of grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers also — that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher discovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper ’s . The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away ; saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last ; saw the feeble flame rise and fall , climb the thin column of smoke , linger at its top a moment , and then — the horror of utter darkness reigned ! How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that she was crying in Tom ’s arms , neither could tell . All that they knew was , that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time , both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more . Tom said it might be Sunday , now — maybe Monday . He tried to get Becky to talk , but her sorrows were too oppressive , all her hopes were gone . Tom said that they must have been missed long ago , and no doubt the search was going on . He would shout and maybe some one would come . He tried it ; but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no more . The hours wasted away , and hunger came to torment the captives again . A portion of Tom ’s half of the cake was left ; they divided and ate it . But they seemed hungrier than before . The poor morsel of food only whetted desire . By - and - by Tom said : “
78994	79053	78990	78990	you	1846	” Both held their breath and listened . There was a sound like the faintest , far - off shout . Instantly Tom answered it , and leading Becky by the hand , started groping down the corridor in its direction . Presently he listened again ; again the sound was heard , and apparently a little nearer . “
79058	79062	79056	79056	them	1847	” said Tom ; “
79077	79351	79070	79070	Becky	86	” The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming . Their speed was slow , however , because pitfalls were somewhat common , and had to be guarded against . They shortly came to one and had to stop . It might be three feet deep , it might be a hundred — there was no passing it at any rate . Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could . No bottom . They must stay there and wait until the searchers came . They listened ; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant ! a moment or two more and they had gone altogether . The heart - sinking misery of it ! Tom whooped until he was hoarse , but it was of no use . He talked hopefully to Becky ; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again . The children groped their way back to the spring . The weary time dragged on ; they slept again , and awoke famished and woe - stricken . Tom believed it must be Tuesday by this time . Now an idea struck him . There were some side passages near at hand . It would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in idleness . He took a kite - line from his pocket , tied it to a projection , and he and Becky started , Tom in the lead , unwinding the line as he groped along . At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a “
79357	79466	79070	79070	Becky	86	” Tom got down on his knees and felt below , and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently ; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right , and at that moment , not twenty yards away , a human hand , holding a candle , appeared from behind a rock ! Tom lifted up a glorious shout , and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to — Injun Joe ’s ! Tom was paralyzed ; he could not move . He was vastly gratified the next moment , to see the “
79468	79586	79070	79070	Becky	86	” take to his heels and get himself out of sight . Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court . But the echoes must have disguised the voice . Without doubt , that was it , he reasoned . Tom ’s fright weakened every muscle in his body . He said to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there , and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again . He was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen . He told her he had only shouted “
79590	80043	79070	79070	Becky	86	” But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run . Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes . The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger . Tom believed that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday , now , and that the search had been given over . He proposed to explore another passage . He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors . But Becky was very weak . She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be roused . She said she would wait , now , where she was , and die — it would not be long . She told Tom to go with the kite - line and explore if he chose ; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak to her ; and she made him promise that when the awful time came , he would stay by her and hold her hand until all was over . Tom kissed her , with a choking sensation in his throat , and made a show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave ; then he took the kite - line in his hand and went groping down one of the passages on his hands and knees , distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom . CHAPTER XXXII Tuesday afternoon came , and waned to the twilight . The village of St. Petersburg still mourned . The lost children had not been found . Public prayers had been offered up for them , and many and many a private prayer that had the petitioner ’s whole heart in it ; but still no good news came from the cave . The majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily avocations , saying that it was plain the children could never be found . Mrs. Thatcher was very ill , and a great part of the time delirious . People said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her child , and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time , then lay it wearily down again with a moan . Aunt Polly had drooped into a settled melancholy , and her gray hair had grown almost white . The village went to its rest on Tuesday night , sad and forlorn . Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells , and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half - clad people , who shouted , “
80058	80508	80054	80054	they	1849	” Tin pans and horns were added to the din , the population massed itself and moved toward the river , met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens , thronged around it , joined its homeward march , and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah ! The village was illuminated ; nobody went to bed again ; it was the greatest night the little town had ever seen . During the first half - hour a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher ’s house , seized the saved ones and kissed them , squeezed Mrs. Thatcher ’s hand , tried to speak but couldn’t — and drifted out raining tears all over the place . Aunt Polly ’s happiness was complete , and Mrs. Thatcher ’s nearly so . It would be complete , however , as soon as the messenger dispatched with the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband . Tom lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure , putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal ; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on an exploring expedition ; how he followed two avenues as far as his kite - line would reach ; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kite - line , and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far - off speck that looked like daylight ; dropped the line and groped toward it , pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole , and saw the broad Mississippi rolling by ! And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more ! He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff , for she was tired , and knew she was going to die , and wanted to . He described how he labored with her and convinced her ; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight ; how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out ; how they sat there and cried for gladness ; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition ; how the men did n’t believe the wild tale at first , “
80511	80515	80516	80516	you	1850	” said they , “
80529	80772	80516	80516	you	1850	in”—then took them aboard , rowed to a house , gave them supper , made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home . Before day - dawn , Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were tracked out , in the cave , by the twine clews they had strung behind them , and informed of the great news . Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken off at once , as Tom and Becky soon discovered . They were bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday , and seemed to grow more and more tired and worn , all the time . Tom got about , a little , on Thursday , was downtown Friday , and nearly as whole as ever Saturday ; but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday , and then she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness . Tom learned of Huck ’s sickness and went to see him on Friday , but could not be admitted to the bedroom ; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday . He was admitted daily after that , but was warned to keep still about his adventure and introduce no exciting topic . The Widow Douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed . At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event ; also that the “
80776	80905	80516	80516	you	1850	” body had eventually been found in the river near the ferry - landing ; he had been drowned while trying to escape , perhaps . About a fortnight after Tom ’s rescue from the cave , he started off to visit Huck , who had grown plenty strong enough , now , to hear exciting talk , and Tom had some that would interest him , he thought . Judge Thatcher ’s house was on Tom ’s way , and he stopped to see Becky . The Judge and some friends set Tom to talking , and some one asked him ironically if he would n’t like to go to the cave again . Tom said he thought he would n’t mind it . The Judge said : “
80942	80943	80932	80932	Nobody	647	” “
80946	80947	80932	80932	Nobody	647	” “
80974	80983	80968	80968	I	0	” Tom turned as white as a sheet . “
81003	81015	80995	80995	somebody	262	” The water was brought and thrown into Tom ’s face . “
81033	81034	81031	81031	Tom	46	” “
81046	81592	81037	81037	Judge	158	” CHAPTER XXXIII Within a few minutes the news had spread , and a dozen skiff - loads of men were on their way to McDougal ’s cave , and the ferryboat , well filled with passengers , soon followed . Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher . When the cave door was unlocked , a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim twilight of the place . Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground , dead , with his face close to the crack of the door , as if his longing eyes had been fixed , to the latest moment , upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside . Tom was touched , for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered . His pity was moved , but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security , now , which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody - minded outcast . Injun Joe ’s bowie - knife lay close by , its blade broken in two . The great foundation - beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through , with tedious labor ; useless labor , too , it was , for the native rock formed a sill outside it , and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect ; the only damage done was to the knife itself . But if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still , for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body under the door , and he knew it . So he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something — in order to pass the weary time — in order to employ his tortured faculties . Ordinarily one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule , left there by tourists ; but there were none now . The prisoner had searched them out and eaten them . He had also contrived to catch a few bats , and these , also , he had eaten , leaving only their claws . The poor unfortunate had starved to death . In one place , near at hand , a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages , builded by the water - drip from a stalactite overhead . The captive had broken off the stalagmite , and upon the stump had placed a stone , wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock - tick — a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours . That drop was falling when the Pyramids were new ; when Troy fell ; when the foundations of Rome were laid ; when Christ was crucified ; when the Conqueror created the British empire ; when Columbus sailed ; when the massacre at Lexington was “
81595	81750	81037	81037	Judge	158	” It is falling now ; it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history , and the twilight of tradition , and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion . Has everything a purpose and a mission ? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect ’s need ? and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come ? No matter . It is many and many a year since the hapless half - breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops , but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow - dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of McDougal ’s cave . Injun Joe ’s cup stands first in the list of the cavern ’s marvels ; even “
81754	82029	82030	82030	I	0	” can not rival it . Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave ; and people flocked there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and hamlets for seven miles around ; they brought their children , and all sorts of provisions , and confessed that they had had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the hanging . This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing — the petition to the governor for Injun Joe ’s pardon . The petition had been largely signed ; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held , and a committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the governor , and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty under foot . Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the village , but what of that ? If he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon - petition , and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky water - works . The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have an important talk . Huck had learned all about Tom ’s adventure from the Welshman and the Widow Douglas , by this time , but Tom said he reckoned there was one thing they had not told him ; that thing was what he wanted to talk about now . Huck ’s face saddened . He said : “
82127	82128	82111	82111	Tom	46	” “
82171	82172	82163	82163	you	1861	” “
82200	82201	82203	82203	You	1861	” “
82208	82209	82203	82203	You	1861	” “
82260	82285	82249	82249	he	100	” Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom , who had only heard of the Welshman ’s part of it before . “
82288	82301	82249	82249	he	100	” said Huck , presently , coming back to the main question , “
82330	82331	82332	82332	Huck	45	” “
82344	82345	82332	82332	Huck	45	” “
82348	82357	82358	82358	Tom	46	” Huck searched his comrade ’s face keenly . “
82371	82372	82373	82373	Huck	45	” “
82381	82387	82423	82423	Huck	45	” Huck ’s eyes blazed . “
82394	82395	82392	82392	Tom	46	” “
82403	82404	82405	82405	Tom	46	” “
82419	82420	82421	82421	Earnest	170	” “
82449	82450	82437	82437	you	46	” “
82474	82475	82476	82476	Huck	45	” “
82493	82494	82476	82476	Huck	45	” “
82507	82508	82509	82509	Huck	45	” “
82550	82551	82544	82544	I	0	” “
82565	82566	82562	82562	you	46	” “
82580	82581	82576	82576	you	46	” “
82623	82624	82616	82616	I	0	” “
82700	82701	82691	82691	You	45	” “
82709	82710	82707	82707	Tom	46	” “
82773	82804	82761	82761	I	0	” A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who was absent , and got under way at once . When they were several miles below “
82808	82812	82761	82761	I	0	” Tom said : “
82875	82879	82868	82868	We	1885	” They landed . “
82912	82937	82907	82907	you	45	” Huck searched all the place about , and found nothing . Tom proudly marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said : “
83059	83060	83057	83057	Huck	45	” “
83075	83076	83079	83080	most anybody	1897	” “
83091	83092	83082	83083	Waylay people	1898	” “
83097	83098	83082	83083	Waylay people	1898	” “
83115	83116	83082	83083	Waylay people	1898	” “
83122	83123	83082	83083	Waylay people	1898	” “
83287	83288	83296	83296	Tom	46	” “
83308	83309	83298	83298	I	0	” “
83331	83466	83298	83298	I	0	” By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole , Tom in the lead . They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel , then made their spliced kite - strings fast and moved on . A few steps brought them to the spring , and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him . He showed Huck the fragment of candle - wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall , and described how he and Becky had watched the flame struggle and expire . The boys began to quiet down to whispers , now , for the stillness and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits . They went on , and presently entered and followed Tom ’s other corridor until they reached the “
83472	83501	83298	83298	I	0	” The candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice , but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high . Tom whispered : “
83511	83520	83509	83509	Huck	45	” He held his candle aloft and said : “
83551	83552	83553	83553	Tom	46	” “
83562	83563	83553	83553	Tom	46	” “
83598	83615	83616	83616	Tom	46	” Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile , and then said with a shaky voice : “
83624	83625	83616	83616	Tom	46	” “
83633	83634	83658	83658	Huck	45	” “
83651	83652	83640	83643	Injun Joe ’s ghost	1912	” “
83688	83689	83658	83658	Huck	45	” “
83717	83741	83715	83715	you	46	” Tom began to fear that Huck was right . Misgivings gathered in his mind . But presently an idea occurred to him — “
83771	83783	83784	83784	Tom	46	” The point was well taken . It had its effect . “
83823	83934	83935	83935	He	1917	” Tom went first , cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended . Huck followed . Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in . The boys examined three of them with no result . They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock , with a pallet of blankets spread down in it ; also an old suspender , some bacon rind , and the well - gnawed bones of two or three fowls . But there was no moneybox . The lads searched and researched this place , but in vain . Tom said : “
83971	83997	84000	84000	Huck	45	” They searched everywhere once more , and then sat down discouraged . Huck could suggest nothing . By - and - by Tom said : “
84055	84056	84046	84046	I	0	” “
84066	84074	84064	84064	Tom	46	” said Huck with animation . Tom ’s “
84077	84095	84064	84064	Tom	46	” was out at once , and he had not dug four inches before he struck wood . “
84102	84214	84098	84098	Huck!—you	172	” Huck began to dig and scratch now . Some boards were soon uncovered and removed . They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock . Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could , but said he could not see to the end of the rift . He proposed to explore . He stooped and passed under ; the narrow way descended gradually . He followed its winding course , first to the right , then to the left , Huck at his heels . Tom turned a short curve , by - and - by , and exclaimed : “
84222	84279	84218	84218	Huck	45	” It was the treasure - box , sure enough , occupying a snug little cavern , along with an empty powder - keg , a couple of guns in leather cases , two or three pairs of old moccasins , a leather belt , and some other rubbish well soaked with the water - drip . “
84285	84298	84299	84299	My	0	” said Huck , ploughing among the tarnished coins with his hand . “
84308	84309	84310	84310	Huck	45	” “
84362	84386	84387	84387	I	0	” It weighed about fifty pounds . Tom could lift it , after an awkward fashion , but could not carry it conveniently . “
84391	84395	84387	84387	I	0	” he said ; “
84431	84450	84419	84419	I	0	” The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock . “
84459	84463	84419	84419	I	0	” said Huck . “
84513	84514	84544	84544	Huck	45	” “
84518	84519	84520	84520	I	0	” “
84581	84647	84569	84569	We	1919	” They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes , looked warily out , found the coast clear , and were soon lunching and smoking in the skiff . As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way . Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight , chatting cheerily with Huck , and landed shortly after dark . “
84652	84656	84650	84650	Huck	45	” said Tom , “
84735	84803	84804	84804	Hallo	107	” He disappeared , and presently returned with the wagon , put the two small sacks into it , threw some old rags on top of them , and started off , dragging his cargo behind him . When the boys reached the Welshman ’s house , they stopped to rest . Just as they were about to move on , the Welshman stepped out and said : “
84810	84811	84812	84812	Huck	45	” “
84817	84818	84814	84815	Tom Sawyer	46	” “
84868	84869	84814	84815	Tom Sawyer	46	” “
84873	84877	84814	84815	Tom Sawyer	46	” said Tom . “
84934	84946	84950	84950	you	1937	” The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about . “
84963	84980	84981	84982	Mr. Jones	174	” Huck said with some apprehension — for he was long used to being falsely accused : “
84991	84996	84981	84982	Mr. Jones	174	” The Welshman laughed . “
85025	85026	85031	85031	she	1941	” “
85041	85042	85031	85031	she	1941	” “
85057	85215	85050	85050	you	45	” This question was not entirely answered in Huck ’s slow mind before he found himself pushed , along with Tom , into Mrs. Douglas ’ drawing - room . Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed . The place was grandly lighted , and everybody that was of any consequence in the village was there . The Thatchers were there , the Harpers , the Rogerses , Aunt Polly , Sid , Mary , the minister , the editor , and a great many more , and all dressed in their best . The widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings . They were covered with clay and candle - grease . Aunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation , and frowned and shook her head at Tom . Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did , however . Mr. Jones said : “
85253	85254	85244	85244	I	0	” “
85261	85266	85256	85256	you	1945	” said the widow . “
85273	85283	85256	85256	you	1945	” She took them to a bedchamber and said : “
85350	85360	85361	85361	Tom	46	” Then she left . CHAPTER XXXIV Huck said : “
85383	85384	85361	85361	Tom	46	” “
85395	85396	85361	85361	Tom	46	” “
85425	85426	85423	85423	Tom	46	” “
85451	85455	85456	85456	Tom	46	” Sid appeared . “
85458	85462	85463	85463	auntie	2133	” said he , “
85500	85501	85504	85505	Mr. Siddy	52	” “
85525	85526	85536	85536	she	1578	” “
85581	85582	85569	85569	I	0	” “
85587	85588	85569	85569	I	0	” “
85674	85675	85669	85669	Huck	45	” “
85682	85683	85685	85685	Huck	45	” “
85719	85730	85731	85731	Sid	51	” Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way . “
85739	85740	85735	85735	you	51	” “
85758	85759	85750	85750	Somebody	262	” “
85837	85853	85835	85836	the widow	1578	says”—and Tom cuffed Sid ’s ears and helped him to the door with several kicks . “
85870	86103	86104	86104	Huck	45	” Some minutes later the widow ’s guests were at the supper - table , and a dozen children were propped up at little side - tables in the same room , after the fashion of that country and that day . At the proper time Mr. Jones made his little speech , in which he thanked the widow for the honor she was doing himself and his sons , but said that there was another person whose modesty — And so forth and so on . He sprung his secret about Huck ’s share in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of , but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances . However , the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment , and heaped so many compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody ’s gaze and everybody ’s laudations . The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him educated ; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in business in a modest way . Tom ’s chance was come . He said : “
86114	86152	86110	86110	Huck	45	” Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke . But the silence was a little awkward . Tom broke it : “
86193	86222	86223	86223	Sid	51	” Tom ran out of doors . The company looked at each other with a perplexed interest — and inquiringly at Huck , who was tongue - tied . “
86229	86234	86235	86235	He	45	” said Aunt Polly . “
86253	86287	86250	86250	I	0	” Tom entered , struggling with the weight of his sacks , and Aunt Polly did not finish her sentence . Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table and said : “
86309	86383	86384	86384	I	0	” The spectacle took the general breath away . All gazed , nobody spoke for a moment . Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation . Tom said he could furnish it , and he did . The tale was long , but brimful of interest . There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the charm of its flow . When he had finished , Mr. Jones said : “
86420	86537	86414	86414	I	0	” The money was counted . The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand dollars . It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time before , though several persons were there who were worth considerably more than that in property . CHAPTER XXXV The reader may rest satisfied that Tom ’s and Huck ’s windfall made a mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg . So vast a sum , all in actual cash , seemed next to incredible . It was talked about , gloated over , glorified , until the reason of many of the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement . Every “
86539	87352	87377	87377	Tom	46	” house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected , plank by plank , and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden treasure — and not by boys , but men — pretty grave , unromantic men , too , some of them . Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted , admired , stared at . The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had possessed weight before ; but now their sayings were treasured and repeated ; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable ; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace things ; moreover , their past history was raked up and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality . The village paper published biographical sketches of the boys . The Widow Douglas put Huck ’s money out at six per cent . , and Judge Thatcher did the same with Tom ’s at Aunt Polly ’s request . Each lad had an income , now , that was simply prodigious — a dollar for every weekday in the year and half of the Sundays . It was just what the minister got — no , it was what he was promised — he generally could n’t collect it . A dollar and a quarter a week would board , lodge , and school a boy in those old simple days — and clothe him and wash him , too , for that matter . Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom . He said that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave . When Becky told her father , in strict confidence , how Tom had taken her whipping at school , the Judge was visibly moved ; and when she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own , the Judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble , a generous , a magnanimous lie — a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to breast with George Washington ’s lauded Truth about the hatchet ! Becky thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that . She went straight off and told Tom about it . Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some day . He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school in the country , in order that he might be ready for either career or both . Huck Finn ’s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas ’ protection introduced him into society — no , dragged him into it , hurled him into it — and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear . The widow ’s servants kept him clean and neat , combed and brushed , and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend . He had to eat with a knife and fork ; he had to use napkin , cup , and plate ; he had to learn his book , he had to go to church ; he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth ; whithersoever he turned , the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot . He bravely bore his miseries three weeks , and then one day turned up missing . For forty - eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in great distress . The public were profoundly concerned ; they searched high and low , they dragged the river for his body . Early the third morning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned slaughter - house , and in one of them he found the refugee . Huck had slept there ; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and ends of food , and was lying off , now , in comfort , with his pipe . He was unkempt , uncombed , and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy . Tom routed him out , told him the trouble he had been causing , and urged him to go home . Huck ’s face lost its tranquil content , and took a melancholy cast . He said : “
87587	87588	87596	87596	Huck	45	” “
87598	87599	87600	87600	Tom	46	” “
87760	87770	87744	87744	she	1791	” [ Then with a spasm of special irritation and injury]—“And
87977	87978	87966	87966	you	46	” “
88014	88015	88007	88007	you	45	” “
88117	88123	88126	88126	Huck	45	” Tom saw his opportunity — “
88141	88142	88126	88126	Huck	45	” “
88162	88163	88160	88160	Tom	46	” “
88194	88201	88177	88177	we	1995	” Huck ’s joy was quenched . “
88220	88221	88212	88212	you	46	” “
88263	88264	88267	88267	Tom	46	” “
88304	88305	88306	88306	Huck	45	” “
88368	88386	88364	88364	I	0	” Huck was silent for some time , engaged in a mental struggle . Finally he said : “
88424	88425	88422	88422	Tom	46	” “
88458	88459	88456	88456	Huck	45	” “
88510	88511	88500	88500	you	46	” “
88531	88532	88517	88517	We	2015	” “
88537	88538	88517	88517	We	2015	” “
88543	88544	88517	88517	We	2015	” “
88549	88550	88551	88551	It	2017	” “
88592	88593	88605	88605	I	0	” “
88609	88610	88603	88603	Tom	46	” “
88655	88656	88648	88648	they	1545	” “
88667	88668	88665	88665	Tom	46	” “
88691	88692	88676	88676	you	46	” “
