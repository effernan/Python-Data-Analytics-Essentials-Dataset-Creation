8141	9047	8138	8138	He	612	“ Right so the king and Merlin departed , and went until an hermit that was a good man and a great leech . So the hermit searched all his wounds and gave him good salves ; so the king was there three days , and then were his wounds well amended that he might ride and go , and so departed . And as they rode , Arthur said , I have no sword . No force , * [ * Footnote from M.T. : No matter . ] said Merlin , hereby is a sword that shall be yours and I may . So they rode till they came to a lake , the which was a fair water and broad , and in the midst of the lake Arthur was ware of an arm clothed in white samite , that held a fair sword in that hand . Lo , said Merlin , yonder is that sword that I spake of . With that they saw a damsel going upon the lake . What damsel is that ? said Arthur . That is the Lady of the lake , said Merlin ; and within that lake is a rock , and therein is as fair a place as any on earth , and richly beseen , and this damsel will come to you anon , and then speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword . Anon withal came the damsel unto Arthur and saluted him , and he her again . Damsel , said Arthur , what sword is that , that yonder the arm holdeth above the water ? I would it were mine , for I have no sword . Sir Arthur King , said the damsel , that sword is mine , and if ye will give me a gift when I ask it you , ye shall have it . By my faith , said Arthur , I will give you what gift ye will ask . Well , said the damsel , go ye into yonder barge and row yourself to the sword , and take it and the scabbard with you , and I will ask my gift when I see my time . So Sir Arthur and Merlin alight , and tied their horses to two trees , and so they went into the ship , and when they came to the sword that the hand held , Sir Arthur took it up by the handles , and took it with him . And the arm and the hand went under the water ; and so they came unto the land and rode forth . And then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion . What signifieth yonder pavilion ? It is the knight 's pavilion , said Merlin , that ye fought with last , Sir Pellinore , but he is out , he is not there ; he hath ado with a knight of yours , that hight Egglame , and they have fought together , but at the last Egglame fled , and else he had been dead , and he hath chased him even to Carlion , and we shall meet with him anon in the highway . That is well said , said Arthur , now have I a sword , now will I wage battle with him , and be avenged on him . Sir , ye shall not so , said Merlin , for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing , so that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him ; also , he will not lightly be matched of one knight living ; and therefore it is my counsel , let him pass , for he shall do you good service in short time , and his sons , after his days . Also ye shall see that day in short space ye shall be right glad to give him your sister to we d. When I see him , I will do as ye advise me , said Arthur . Then Sir Arthur looked on the sword , and liked it passing well . Whether liketh you better , said Merlin , the sword or the scabbard ? Me liketh better the sword , said Arthur . Ye are more unwise , said Merlin , for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword , for while ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood , be ye never so sore wounded ; therefore , keep well the scabbard always with you . So they rode into Carlion , and by the way they met with Sir Pellinore ; but Merlin had done such a craft that Pellinore saw not Arthur , and he passed by without any words . I marvel , said Arthur , that the knight would not speak . Sir , said Merlin , he saw you not ; for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed . So they came unto Carlion , whereof his knights were passing glad . And when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would jeopard his person so alone . But all men of worship said it was merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in adventure as other poor knights did . ”

So on the morn they heard their masses in the abbey , and so they rode forth till they came to a great forest ; then was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a turret , of twelve fair damsels , and two knights armed on great horses , and the damsels went to and fro by a tree . And then was Sir Gawaine ware how there hung a white shield on that tree , and ever as the damsels came by it they spit upon it , and some threw mire upon the shield-- ”

Yes , and I mean your best , too , society 's very choicest brands .

37308	37459	36922	36922	She	1596	“ Even so be it , sith ye are so minded . Then Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine went and saluted them , and asked them why they did that despite to the shield . Sirs , said the damsels , we shall tell you . There is a knight in this country that owneth this white shield , and he is a passing good man of his hands , but he hateth all ladies and gentlewomen , and therefore we do all this despite to the shield . I will say you , said Sir Gawaine , it beseemeth evil a good knight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen , and peradventure though he hate you he hath some cause , and peradventure he loveth in some other places ladies and gentlewomen , and to be loved again , and he such a man of prowess as ye speak of-- ”
37460	37606	36922	36922	She	1596	“ Man of prowess -- yes , that is the man to please them , Sandy . Man of brains -- that is a thing they never think of . Tom Sayers --John Heenan -- John L. Sullivan -- pity but you could be here . You would have your legs under the Round Table and a ' Sir ' in front of your names within the twenty - four hours ; and you could bring about a new distribution of the married princesses and duchesses of the Court in another twenty - four . The fact is , it is just a sort of polished - up court of Comanches , and there is n't a squaw in it who does n't stand ready at the dropping of a hat to desert to the buck with the biggest string of scalps at his belt . ”
37607	37648	36922	36922	She	1596	“ --and he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of , said Sir Gawaine . Now , what is his name ? Sir , said they , his name is Marhaus the king 's son of Ireland . ”
37649	37706	36922	36922	She	1596	“ Son of the king of Ireland , you mean ; the other form does n't mean anything . And look out and hold on tight , now , we must jump this gully .... There , we are all right now . This horse belongs in the circus ; he is born before his time . ”
37707	37729	36922	36922	She	1596	“ I know him well , said Sir Uwaine , he is a passing good knight as any is on live . ”
37730	37765	36922	36922	She	1596	“ _ On live _ . If you 've got a fault in the world , Sandy , it is that you are a shade too archaic . But it is n't any matter . ”
37766	37969	36922	36922	She	1596	“ --for I saw him once proved at a justs where many knights were gathered , and that time there might no man withstand him . Ah , said Sir Gawaine , damsels , methinketh ye are to blame , for it is to suppose he that hung that shield there will not be long therefrom , and then may those knights match him on horseback , and that is more your worship than thus ; for I will abide no longer to see a knight 's shield dishonored . And therewith Sir Uwaine and Sir Gawaine departed a little from them , and then were they ware where Sir Marhaus came riding on a great horse straight toward them . And when the twelve damsels saw Sir Marhaus they fled into the turret as they were wild , so that some of them fell by the way . Then the one of the knights of the tower dressed his shield , and said on high , Sir Marhaus defend thee . And so they ran together that the knight brake his spear on Marhaus , and Sir Marhaus smote him so hard that he brake his neck and the horse 's back-- ”
37970	37990	36922	36922	She	1596	“ Well , that is just the trouble about this state of things , it ruins so many horses . ”
37991	38031	36922	36922	She	1596	“ That saw the other knight of the turret , and dressed him toward Marhaus , and they went so eagerly together , that the knight of the turret was soon smitten down , horse and man , stark dead-- ”

But Sir Gawaine , fro it passed nine of the clock , waxed by the space of three hours ever stronger and stronger and thrice his might was increased . All this espied Sir Marhaus , and had great wonder how his might increased , and so they wounded other passing sore ; and then when it was come noon-- ”

Ah , said Sir Gawaine , gentle knight , ye say the word that I should say .

And on the morn the duke sent unto Sir Marhaus , and bad him make him ready . And so Sir Marhaus arose and armed him , and there was a mass sung afore him , and he brake his fast , and so mounted on horseback in the court of the castle , there they should do the battle . So there was the duke already on horseback , clean armed , and his six sons by him , and every each had a spear in his hand , and so they encountered , whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears upon him , but Sir Marhaus held up his spear and touched none of them . Then came the four sons by couples , and two of them brake their spears , and so did the other two . And all this while Sir Marhaus touched them not . Then Sir Marhaus ran to the duke , and smote him with his spear that horse and man fell to the earth . And so he served his sons . And then Sir Marhaus alight down , and bad the duke yield him or else he would slay him . And then some of his sons recovered , and would have set upon Sir Marhaus . Then Sir Marhaus said to the duke , Cease thy sons , or else I will do the uttermost to you all . When the duke saw he might not escape the death , he cried to his sons , and charged them to yield them to Sir Marhaus . And they kneeled all down and put the pommels of their swords to the knight , and so he received them . And then they holp up their father , and so by their common assent promised unto Sir Marhaus never to be foes unto King Arthur , and thereupon at Whitsuntide after , to come he and his sons , and put them in the king 's grace . * [ * Footnote : The story is borrowed , language and all , from the Morte d'Arthur.--M.T. ] “

52724	52860	52722	52722	Sandy	199	” It was the first time I ever struck a still place in her . The mill had shut down for repairs , or something . CHAPTER XX THE OGRE 'S CASTLE Between six and nine we made ten miles , which was plenty for a horse carrying triple -- man , woman , and armor ; then we stopped for a long nooning under some trees by a limpid brook . Right so came by and by a knight riding ; and as he drew near he made dolorous moan , and by the words of it I perceived that he was cursing and swearing ; yet nevertheless was I glad of his coming , for that I saw he bore a bulletin - board whereon in letters all of shining gold was writ : “
52873	53081	52722	52722	Sandy	199	” I was glad of his coming , for even by this token I knew him for knight of mine . It was Sir Madok de la Montaine , a burly great fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace of sending Sir Launcelot down over his horse - tail once . He was never long in a stranger 's presence without finding some pretext or other to let out that great fact . But there was another fact of nearly the same size , which he never pushed upon anybody unasked , and yet never withheld when asked : that was , that the reason he did n't quite succeed was , that he was interrupted and sent down over horse - tail himself . This innocent vast lubber did not see any particular difference between the two facts . I liked him , for he was earnest in his work , and very valuable . And he was so fine to look at , with his broad mailed shoulders , and the grand leonine set of his plumed head , and his big shield with its quaint device of a gauntleted hand clutching a prophylactic tooth - brush , with motto : “
53085	53491	53497	53497	him	2176	” This was a tooth - wash that I was introducing . He was aweary , he said , and indeed he looked it ; but he would not alight . He said he was after the stove - polish man ; and with this he broke out cursing and swearing anew . The bulletin - boarder referred to was Sir Ossaise of Surluse , a brave knight , and of considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions in a tournament once , with no less a Mogul than Sir Gaheris himself -- although not successfully . He was of a light and laughing disposition , and to him nothing in this world was serious . It was for this reason that I had chosen him to work up a stove - polish sentiment . There were no stoves yet , and so there could be nothing serious about stove - polish . All that the agent needed to do was to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change , and have them established in predilections toward neatness against the time when the stove should appear upon the stage . Sir Madok was very bitter , and brake out anew with cursings . He said he had cursed his soul to rags ; and yet he would not get down from his horse , neither would he take any rest , or listen to any comfort , until he should have found Sir Ossaise and settled this account . It appeared , by what I could piece together of the unprofane fragments of his statement , that he had chanced upon Sir Ossaise at dawn of the morning , and been told that if he would make a short cut across the fields and swamps and broken hills and glades , he could head off a company of travelers who would be rare customers for prophylactics and tooth - wash . With characteristic zeal Sir Madok had plunged away at once upon this quest , and after three hours of awful crosslot riding had overhauled his game . And behold , it was the five patriarchs that had been released from the dungeons the evening before ! Poor old creatures , it was all of twenty years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth . “

53562	54347	53514	53514	I	0	” And with these words and others , he lightly took his spear and gat him thence . In the middle of the afternoon we came upon one of those very patriarchs ourselves , in the edge of a poor village . He was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not seen for fifty years ; and about him and caressing him were also descendants of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now ; but to him these were all strangers , his memory was gone , his mind was stagnant . It seemed incredible that a man could outlast half a century shut up in a dark hole like a rat , but here were his old wife and some old comrades to testify to it . They could remember him as he was in the freshness and strength of his young manhood , when he kissed his child and delivered it to its mother 's hands and went away into that long oblivion . The people at the castle could not tell within half a generation the length of time the man had been shut up there for his unrecorded and forgotten offense ; but this old wife knew ; and so did her old child , who stood there among her married sons and daughters trying to realize a father who had been to her a name , a thought , a formless image , a tradition , all her life , and now was suddenly concreted into actual flesh and blood and set before her face . It was a curious situation ; yet it is not on that account that I have made room for it here , but on account of a thing which seemed to me still more curious . To wit , that this dreadful matter brought from these downtrodden people no outburst of rage against these oppressors . They had been heritors and subjects of cruelty and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but a kindness . Yes , here was a curious revelation , indeed , of the depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery . Their entire being was reduced to a monotonous dead level of patience , resignation , dumb uncomplaining acceptance of whatever might befall them in this life . Their very imagination was dead . When you can say that of a man , he has struck bottom , I reckon ; there is no lower deep for him . I rather wished I had gone some other road . This was not the sort of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out a peaceful revolution in his mind . For it could not help bringing up the unget - aroundable fact that , all gentle ca nt and philosophizing to the contrary notwithstanding , no people in the world ever did achieve their freedom by goody - goody talk and moral suasion : it being immutable law that all revolutions that will succeed must _ begin _ in blood , whatever may answer afterward . If history teaches anything , it teaches that . What this folk needed , then , was a Reign of Terror and a guillotine , and I was the wrong man for them . Two days later , toward noon , Sandy began to show signs of excitement and feverish expectancy . She said we were approaching the ogre 's castle . I was surprised into an uncomfortable shock . The object of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind ; this sudden resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing for a moment , and roused up in me a smart interest . Sandy 's excitement increased every moment ; and so did mine , for that sort of thing is catching . My heart got to thumping . You ca n't reason with your heart ; it has its own laws , and thumps about things which the intellect scorns . Presently , when Sandy slid from the horse , motioned me to stop , and went creeping stealthily , with her head bent nearly to her knees , toward a row of bushes that bordered a declivity , the thumpings grew stronger and quicker . And they kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse over the declivity ; and also while I was creeping to her side on my knees . Her eyes were burning now , as she pointed with her finger , and said in a panting whisper : “
54360	54371	53514	53514	I	0	” What a welcome disappointment I experienced ! I said : “
54390	54419	54479	54479	hath	2180	” She looked surprised and distressed . The animation faded out of her face ; and during many moments she was lost in thought and silent . Then : “
54426	54439	54479	54479	hath	2180	” she said in a musing fashion , as if to herself . “
54543	54593	54533	54533	We	2182	” I saw my cue . The castle was enchanted to _ me _ , not to her . It would be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion , it could n't be done ; I must just humor it . So I said : “
54851	54852	54844	54844	I	0	” “
54909	54910	54911	54911	I	0	” “
54937	54938	54939	54940	The ogres	2200	” “
54997	54998	54999	54999	You	199	” “
55053	55230	55050	55050	you	199	” I left Sandy kneeling there , corpse - faced but plucky and hopeful , and rode down to the pigsty , and struck up a trade with the swine - herds . I won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs at the lump sum of sixteen pennies , which was rather above latest quotations . I was just in time ; for the Church , the lord of the manor , and the rest of the tax - gatherers would have been along next day and swept off pretty much all the stock , leaving the swine - herds very short of hogs and Sandy out of princesses . But now the tax people could be paid in cash , and there would be a stake left besides . One of the men had ten children ; and he said that last year when a priest came and of his ten pigs took the fattest one for tithes , the wife burst out upon him , and offered him a child and said : “
55254	56410	55231	55231	Thou	2204	” How curious . The same thing had happened in the Wales of my day , under this same old Established Church , which was supposed by many to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise . I sent the three men away , and then opened the sty gate and beckoned Sandy to come -- which she did ; and not leisurely , but with the rush of a prairie fire . And when I saw her fling herself upon those hogs , with tears of joy running down her cheeks , and strain them to her heart , and kiss them , and caress them , and call them reverently by grand princely names , I was ashamed of her , ashamed of the human race . We had to drive those hogs home -- ten miles ; and no ladies were ever more fickle - minded or contrary . They would stay in no road , no path ; they broke out through the brush on all sides , and flowed away in all directions , over rocks , and hills , and the roughest places they could find . And they must not be struck , or roughly accosted ; Sandy could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming their rank . The troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called my Lady , and your Highness , like the rest . It is annoying and difficult to scour around after hogs , in armor . There was one small countess , with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair on her back , that was the devil for perversity . She gave me a race of an hour , over all sorts of country , and then we were right where we had started from , having made not a rod of real progress . I seized her at last by the tail , and brought her along squealing . When I overtook Sandy she was horrified , and said it was in the last degree indelicate to drag a countess by her train . We got the hogs home just at dark -- most of them . The princess Nerovens de Morganore was missing , and two of her ladies in waiting : namely , Miss Angela Bohun , and the Demoiselle Elaine Courtemains , the former of these two being a young black sow with a white star in her forehead , and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a slight limp in the forward shank on the starboard side -- a couple of the tryingest blisters to drive that I ever saw . Also among the missing were several mere baronesses -- and I wanted them to stay missing ; but no , all that sausage - meat had to be found ; so servants were sent out with torches to scour the woods and hills to that end . Of course , the whole drove was housed in the house , and , great guns!--well , I never saw anything like it . Nor ever heard anything like it . And never smelt anything like it . It was like an insurrection in a gasometer . CHAPTER XXI THE PILGRIMS When I did get to bed at last I was unspeakably tired ; the stretching out , and the relaxing of the long - tense muscles , how luxurious , how delicious ! but that was as far as I could get -- sleep was out of the question for the present . The ripping and tearing and squealing of the nobility up and down the halls and corridors was pandemonium come again , and kept me broad awake . Being awake , my thoughts were busy , of course ; and mainly they busied themselves with Sandy 's curious delusion . Here she was , as sane a person as the kingdom could produce ; and yet , from my point of view she was acting like a crazy woman . My land , the power of training ! of influence ! of education ! It can bring a body up to believe anything . I had to put myself in Sandy 's place to realize that she was not a lunatic . Yes , and put her in mine , to demonstrate how easy it is to seem a lunatic to a person who has not been taught as you have been taught . If I had told Sandy I had seen a wagon , uninfluenced by enchantment , spin along fifty miles an hour ; had seen a man , unequipped with magic powers , get into a basket and soar out of sight among the clouds ; and had listened , without any necromancer 's help , to the conversation of a person who was several hundred miles away , Sandy would not merely have supposed me to be crazy , she would have thought she knew it . Everybody around her believed in enchantments ; nobody had any doubts ; to doubt that a castle could be turned into a sty , and its occupants into hogs , would have been the same as my doubting among Connecticut people the actuality of the telephone and its wonders,--and in both cases would be absolute proof of a diseased mind , an unsettled reason . Yes , Sandy was sane ; that must be admitted . If I also would be sane -- to Sandy --I must keep my superstitions about unenchanted and unmiraculous locomotives , balloons , and telephones , to myself . Also , I believed that the world was not flat , and had n't pillars under it to support it , nor a canopy over it to turn off a universe of water that occupied all space above ; but as I was the only person in the kingdom afflicted with such impious and criminal opinions , I recognized that it would be good wisdom to keep quiet about this matter , too , if I did not wish to be suddenly shunned and forsaken by everybody as a madman . The next morning Sandy assembled the swine in the dining - room and gave them their breakfast , waiting upon them personally and manifesting in every way the deep reverence which the natives of her island , ancient and modern , have always felt for rank , let its outward casket and the mental and moral contents be what they may . I could have eaten with the hogs if I had had birth approaching my lofty official rank ; but I had n't , and so accepted the unavoidable slight and made no complaint . Sandy and I had our breakfast at the second table . The family were not at home . I said : “
56427	56428	56429	56429	Family	1765	” “
56431	56432	56429	56429	Family	1765	” “
56435	56436	56429	56429	Family	1765	” “
56444	56445	56429	56429	Family	1765	” “
56455	56456	56457	56457	Sooth	2211	” “
56471	56472	56473	56474	No family	2212	” “
56486	56487	56478	56478	Sandy	199	” “
56500	56501	56495	56495	I	0	” “
56511	56512	56495	56495	I	0	” “
56527	56528	56525	56525	myself	0	” “
56545	56546	56547	56547	None	557	” “
56559	56560	56551	56551	We	2218	” “
56652	56653	56648	56649	the man	536	” “
56668	56669	56662	56662	he	536	” “
56674	56684	56662	56662	he	536	” Her face was filled with a puzzled surprise : “
56727	56728	56696	56696	ye	199	” “
56760	56761	56764	56764	him	536	” “
56794	56828	56834	56834	Sandy	199	” To my mind , the situation was uncomfortable . It might become more so . It might be a good idea to muster the hogs and move on . So I said : “
56848	56849	56852	56853	fair sir	4423	” “
56857	56858	56855	56855	Boss	231	” “
56872	56873	56870	56870	we	2218	” “
57023	57024	57025	57026	Great Scott	196	” “
57028	57029	57025	57026	Great Scott	196	” “
57033	57034	57025	57026	Great Scott	196	” “
57134	57135	57137	57138	their friends	560	” “
57153	57188	57193	57193	Sandy	199	” This was lightning from a clear sky , for unexpectedness ; and the relief of it was like pardon to a prisoner . She would remain to deliver the goods , of course . “
57216	57217	57218	57218	I	0	” “
57229	57236	57223	57223	I	0	” This was recalling the pardon . “
57249	57250	57247	57247	you	199	” “
57303	57304	57295	57295	I	0	” “
57311	57317	57295	57295	I	0	” I sighed to myself . “
57328	57337	57318	57318	I	0	” So then I spoke up and said : “
57347	57874	57875	57875	They	2261	” While she was gone to cry her farewells over the pork , I gave that whole peerage away to the servants . And I asked them to take a duster and dust around a little where the nobilities had mainly lodged and promenaded ; but they considered that that would be hardly worth while , and would moreover be a rather grave departure from custom , and therefore likely to make talk . A departure from custom -- that settled it ; it was a nation capable of committing any crime but that . The servants said they would follow the fashion , a fashion grown sacred through immemorial observance ; they would scatter fresh rushes in all the rooms and halls , and then the evidence of the aristocratic visitation would be no longer visible . It was a kind of satire on Nature : it was the scientific method , the geologic method ; it deposited the history of the family in a stratified record ; and the antiquary could dig through it and tell by the remains of each period what changes of diet the family had introduced successively for a hundred years . The first thing we struck that day was a procession of pilgrims . It was not going our way , but we joined it , nevertheless ; for it was hourly being borne in upon me now , that if I would govern this country wisely , I must be posted in the details of its life , and not at second hand , but by personal observation and scrutiny . This company of pilgrims resembled Chaucer 's in this : that it had in it a sample of about all the upper occupations and professions the country could show , and a corresponding variety of costume . There were young men and old men , young women and old women , lively folk and grave folk . They rode upon mules and horses , and there was not a side - saddle in the party ; for this specialty was to remain unknown in England for nine hundred years yet . It was a pleasant , friendly , sociable herd ; pious , happy , merry and full of unconscious coarsenesses and innocent indecencies . What they regarded as the merry tale went the continual round and caused no more embarrassment than it would have caused in the best English society twelve centuries later . Practical jokes worthy of the English wits of the first quarter of the far - off nineteenth century were sprung here and there and yonder along the line , and compelled the delightedest applause ; and sometimes when a bright remark was made at one end of the procession and started on its travels toward the other , you could note its progress all the way by the sparkling spray of laughter it threw off from its bows as it plowed along ; and also by the blushes of the mules in its wake . Sandy knew the goal and purpose of this pilgrimage , and she posted me . She said : “
57903	57904	57875	57875	They	2261	” “
57911	57912	57875	57875	They	2261	” “
57934	57935	57875	57875	They	2261	” “
57947	57948	57875	57875	They	2261	” “
58075	58076	58126	58127	the Fiend	2276	” “
58079	58080	58126	58127	the Fiend	2276	” “
58245	58246	58247	58247	They	2280	” “
58265	58266	58247	58247	They	2280	” “
58344	58345	58381	58381	Sandy	199	” “
58383	58384	58381	58381	Sandy	199	” “
58442	58443	58445	58445	I	0	” “
58453	58454	58455	58455	He	2277	” “
58477	58478	58479	58480	The community	2288	” “
58485	58486	58479	58480	The community	2288	” “
58618	58619	58620	58620	You	2301	” “
58628	58629	58620	58620	You	2301	” “
58724	60321	58715	58715	he	2310	” I closed up alongside of a burly fellow with a fat good - humored face , purposing to make myself agreeable and pick up some further crumbs of fact ; but I had hardly more than scraped acquaintance with him when he began eagerly and awkwardly to lead up , in the immemorial way , to that same old anecdote -- the one Sir Dinadan told me , what time I got into trouble with Sir Sagramor and was challenged of him on account of it . I excused myself and dropped to the rear of the procession , sad at heart , willing to go hence from this troubled life , this vale of tears , this brief day of broken rest , of cloud and storm , of weary struggle and monotonous defeat ; and yet shrinking from the change , as remembering how long eternity is , and how many have wended thither who know that anecdote . Early in the afternoon we overtook another procession of pilgrims ; but in this one was no merriment , no jokes , no laughter , no playful ways , nor any happy giddiness , whether of youth or age . Yet both were here , both age and youth ; gray old men and women , strong men and women of middle age , young husbands , young wives , little boys and girls , and three babies at the breast . Even the children were smileless ; there was not a face among all these half a hundred people but was cast down , and bore that set expression of hopelessness which is bred of long and hard trials and old acquaintance with despair . They were slaves . Chains led from their fettered feet and their manacled hands to a sole - leather belt about their waists ; and all except the children were also linked together in a file six feet apart , by a single chain which led from collar to collar all down the line . They were on foot , and had tramped three hundred miles in eighteen days , upon the cheapest odds and ends of food , and stingy rations of that . They had slept in these chains every night , bundled together like swine . They had upon their bodies some poor rags , but they could not be said to be clothed . Their irons had chafed the skin from their ankles and made sores which were ulcerated and wormy . Their naked feet were torn , and none walked without a limp . Originally there had been a hundred of these unfortunates , but about half had been sold on the trip . The trader in charge of them rode a horse and carried a whip with a short handle and a long heavy lash divided into several knotted tails at the end . With this whip he cut the shoulders of any that tottered from weariness and pain , and straightened them up . He did not speak ; the whip conveyed his desire without that . None of these poor creatures looked up as we rode along by ; they showed no consciousness of our presence . And they made no sound but one ; that was the dull and awful clank of their chains from end to end of the long file , as forty - three burdened feet rose and fell in unison . The file moved in a cloud of its own making . All these faces were gray with a coating of dust . One has seen the like of this coating upon furniture in unoccupied houses , and has written his idle thought in it with his finger . I was reminded of this when I noticed the faces of some of those women , young mothers carrying babes that were near to death and freedom , how a something in their hearts was written in the dust upon their faces , plain to see , and lord , how plain to read ! for it was the track of tears . One of these young mothers was but a girl , and it hurt me to the heart to read that writing , and reflect that it was come up out of the breast of such a child , a breast that ought not to know trouble yet , but only the gladness of the morning of life ; and no doubt-- She reeled just then , giddy with fatigue , and down came the lash and flicked a flake of skin from her naked shoulder . It stung me as if I had been hit instead . The master halted the file and jumped from his horse . He stormed and swore at this girl , and said she had made annoyance enough with her laziness , and as this was the last chance he should have , he would settle the account now . She dropped on her knees and put up her hands and began to beg , and cry , and implore , in a passion of terror , but the master gave no attention . He snatched the child from her , and then made the men - slaves who were chained before and behind her throw her on the ground and hold her there and expose her body ; and then he laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed , she shrieking and struggling the while piteously . One of the men who was holding her turned away his face , and for this humanity he was reviled and flogged . All our pilgrims looked on and commented -- on the expert way in which the whip was handled . They were too much hardened by lifelong everyday familiarity with slavery to notice that there was anything else in the exhibition that invited comment . This was what slavery could do , in the way of ossifying what one may call the superior lobe of human feeling ; for these pilgrims were kind - hearted people , and they would not have allowed that man to treat a horse like that . I wanted to stop the whole thing and set the slaves free , but that would not do . I must not interfere too much and get myself a name for riding over the country 's laws and the citizen 's rights roughshod . If I lived and prospered I would be the death of slavery , that I was resolved upon ; but I would try to fix it so that when I became its executioner it should be by command of the nation . Just here was the wayside shop of a smith ; and now arrived a landed proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back , deliverable here where her irons could be taken off . They were removed ; then there was a squabble between the gentleman and the dealer as to which should pay the blacksmith . The moment the girl was delivered from her irons , she flung herself , all tears and frantic sobbings , into the arms of the slave who had turned away his face when she was whipped . He strained her to his breast , and smothered her face and the child 's with kisses , and washed them with the rain of his tears . I suspected . I inquired . Yes , I was right ; it was husband and wife . They had to be torn apart by force ; the girl had to be dragged away , and she struggled and fought and shrieked like one gone mad till a turn of the road hid her from sight ; and even after that , we could still make out the fading plaint of those receding shrieks . And the husband and father , with his wife and child gone , never to be seen by him again in life?--well , the look of him one might not bear at all , and so I turned away ; but I knew I should never get his picture out of my mind again , and there it is to this day , to wring my heartstrings whenever I think of it . We put up at the inn in a village just at nightfall , and when I rose next morning and looked abroad , I was ware where a knight came riding in the golden glory of the new day , and recognized him for knight of mine -- Sir Ozana le Cure Hardy . He was in the gentlemen 's furnishing line , and his missionarying specialty was plug hats . He was clothed all in steel , in the beautifulest armor of the time -- up to where his helmet ought to have been ; but he had n't any helmet , he wore a shiny stove - pipe hat , and was ridiculous a spectacle as one might want to see . It was another of my surreptitious schemes for extinguishing knighthood by making it grotesque and absurd . Sir Ozana 's saddle was hung about with leather hat boxes , and every time he overcame a wandering knight he swore him into my service and fitted him with a plug and made him wear it . I dressed and ran down to welcome Sir Ozana and get his news . “
60326	60330	60331	60331	Ye	2314	” I asked . “
60353	60354	60347	60347	I	0	” “
60374	60375	60368	60368	you	0	” “
60391	60392	60388	60388	you	0	” “
60413	60414	60388	60388	you	0	” “
60594	60595	60620	60621	good people	2327	” “
60604	60615	60616	60616	Ye	2314	” This shout burst from twenty pilgrim mouths at once . “
60634	60635	60623	60623	I	0	” “
60642	60643	60637	60637	somebody	1383	” “
60669	60670	60673	60673	they	5157	” “
60679	60680	60673	60673	they	5157	” “
60891	60920	60867	60867	ye	2314	” Breakfast was ready . As soon as it was over I showed to Sir Ozana these words which I had written on the inside of his hat : “
60964	60969	60960	60962	my trained assistants	2337	” And I said : “
61010	61011	61012	61012	I	0	” “
61019	61424	61016	61017	Sir Boss	231	” and he was off . CHAPTER XXII THE HOLY FOUNTAIN The pilgrims were human beings . Otherwise they would have acted differently . They had come a long and difficult journey , and now when the journey was nearly finished , and they learned that the main thing they had come for had ceased to exist , they did n't do as horses or cats or angle - worms would probably have done -- turn back and get at something profitable -- no , anxious as they had before been to see the miraculous fountain , they were as much as forty times as anxious now to see the place where it had used to be . There is no accounting for human beings . We made good time ; and a couple of hours before sunset we stood upon the high confines of the Valley of Holiness , and our eyes swept it from end to end and noted its features . That is , its large features . These were the three masses of buildings . They were distant and isolated temporalities shrunken to toy constructions in the lonely waste of what seemed a desert -- and was . Such a scene is always mournful , it is so impressively still , and looks so steeped in death . But there was a sound here which interrupted the stillness only to add to its mournfulness ; this was the faint far sound of tolling bells which floated fitfully to us on the passing breeze , and so faintly , so softly , that we hardly knew whether we heard it with our ears or with our spirits . We reached the monastery before dark , and there the males were given lodging , but the women were sent over to the nunnery . The bells were close at hand now , and their solemn booming smote upon the ear like a message of doom . A superstitious despair possessed the heart of every monk and published itself in his ghastly face . Everywhere , these black - robed , soft - sandaled , tallow - visaged specters appeared , flitted about and disappeared , noiseless as the creatures of a troubled dream , and as uncanny . The old abbot 's joy to see me was pathetic . Even to tears ; but he did the shedding himself . He said : “
61493	61494	61538	61538	Merlin	134	” “
61545	61546	61551	61551	he	134	” “
61571	61572	61557	61557	he	134	” “
61583	61584	61557	61557	he	134	” “
61597	61598	61599	61599	It	2349	” “
61664	61665	61647	61647	Merlin	134	” “
61739	61740	61732	61732	you	243	” “
61828	61835	61824	61824	himself	134	” The abbot 's face lighted . “
61852	61853	61858	61858	Father	5183	” “
61958	61959	61945	61945	you	5183	” “
62036	62599	63280	63280	I	0	” Of course , it would have been best , all round , for Merlin to waive etiquette and quit and call it half a day , since he would never be able to start that water , for he was a true magician of the time ; which is to say , the big miracles , the ones that gave him his reputation , always had the luck to be performed when nobody but Merlin was present ; he could n't start this well with all this crowd around to see ; a crowd was as bad for a magician 's miracle in that day as it was for a spiritualist 's miracle in mine ; there was sure to be some skeptic on hand to turn up the gas at the crucial moment and spoil everything . But I did not want Merlin to retire from the job until I was ready to take hold of it effectively myself ; and I could not do that until I got my things from Camelot , and that would take two or three days . My presence gave the monks hope , and cheered them up a good deal ; insomuch that they ate a square meal that night for the first time in ten days . As soon as their stomachs had been properly reinforced with food , their spirits began to rise fast ; when the mead began to go round they rose faster . By the time everybody was half - seas over , the holy community was in good shape to make a night of it ; so we stayed by the board and put it through on that line . Matters got to be very jolly . Good old questionable stories were told that made the tears run down and cavernous mouths stand wide and the round bellies shake with laughter ; and questionable songs were bellowed out in a mighty chorus that drowned the boom of the tolling bells . At last I ventured a story myself ; and vast was the success of it . Not right off , of course , for the native of those islands does not , as a rule , dissolve upon the early applications of a humorous thing ; but the fifth time I told it , they began to crack in places ; the eight time I told it , they began to crumble ; at the twelfth repetition they fell apart in chunks ; and at the fifteenth they disintegrated , and I got a broom and swept them up . This language is figurative . Those islanders -- well , they are slow pay at first , in the matter of return for your investment of effort , but in the end they make the pay of all other nations poor and small by contrast . I was at the well next day betimes . Merlin was there , enchanting away like a beaver , but not raising the moisture . He was not in a pleasant humor ; and every time I hinted that perhaps this contract was a shade too hefty for a novice he unlimbered his tongue and cursed like a bishop -- French bishop of the Regency days , I mean . Matters were about as I expected to find them . The “
62601	63267	63280	63280	I	0	” was an ordinary well , it had been dug in the ordinary way , and stoned up in the ordinary way . There was no miracle about it . Even the lie that had created its reputation was not miraculous ; I could have told it myself , with one hand tied behind me . The well was in a dark chamber which stood in the center of a cut - stone chapel , whose walls were hung with pious pictures of a workmanship that would have made a chromo feel good ; pictures historically commemorative of curative miracles which had been achieved by the waters when nobody was looking . That is , nobody but angels ; they are always on deck when there is a miracle to the fore -- so as to get put in the picture , perhaps . Angels are as fond of that as a fire company ; look at the old masters . The well - chamber was dimly lighted by lamps ; the water was drawn with a windlass and chain by monks , and poured into troughs which delivered it into stone reservoirs outside in the chapel -- when there was water to draw , I mean -- and none but monks could enter the well - chamber . I entered it , for I had temporary authority to do so , by courtesy of my professional brother and subordinate . But he had n't entered it himself . He did everything by incantations ; he never worked his intellect . If he had stepped in there and used his eyes , instead of his disordered mind , he could have cured the well by natural means , and then turned it into a miracle in the customary way ; but no , he was an old numskull , a magician who believed in his own magic ; and no magician can thrive who is handicapped with a superstition like that . I had an idea that the well had sprung a leak ; that some of the wall stones near the bottom had fallen and exposed fissures that allowed the water to escape . I measured the chain--98 feet . Then I called in a couple of monks , locked the door , took a candle , and made them lower me in the bucket . When the chain was all paid out , the candle confirmed my suspicion ; a considerable section of the wall was gone , exposing a good big fissure . I almost regretted that my theory about the well 's trouble was correct , because I had another one that had a showy point or two about it for a miracle . I remembered that in America , many centuries later , when an oil well ceased to flow , they used to blast it out with a dynamite torpedo . If I should find this well dry and no explanation of it , I could astonish these people most nobly by having a person of no especial value drop a dynamite bomb into it . It was my idea to appoint Merlin . However , it was plain that there was no occasion for the bomb . One can not have everything the way he would like it . A man has no business to be depressed by a disappointment , anyway ; he ought to make up his mind to get even . That is what I did . I said to myself , I am in no hurry , I can wait ; that bomb will come good yet . And it did , too . When I was above ground again , I turned out the monks , and let down a fish - line ; the well was a hundred and fifty feet deep , and there was forty - one feet of water in it . I called in a monk and asked : “
63274	63275	63280	63280	I	0	” “
63289	63290	63280	63280	I	0	” “
63300	63301	63280	63280	I	0	” “
63324	63555	63280	63280	I	0	” It was true -- as to recent times at least -- for there was witness to it , and better witness than a monk ; only about twenty or thirty feet of the chain showed wear and use , the rest of it was unworn and rusty . What had happened when the well gave out that other time ? Without doubt some practical person had come along and mended the leak , and then had come up and told the abbot he had discovered by divination that if the sinful bath were destroyed the well would flow again . The leak had befallen again now , and these children would have prayed , and processioned , and tolled their bells for heavenly succor till they all dried up and blew away , and no innocent of them all would ever have thought to drop a fish - line into the well or go down in it and find out what was really the matter . Old habit of mind is one of the toughest things to get away from in the world . It transmits itself like physical form and feature ; and for a man , in those days , to have had an idea that his ancestors had n't had , would have brought him under suspicion of being illegitimate . I said to the monk : “
63638	63639	63621	63631	the man that can do _ this _ kind of miracle	2370	” “
63648	63649	63621	63631	the man that can do _ this _ kind of miracle	2370	” “
63707	63708	63709	63709	None	557	” “
63752	63838	63839	63839	I	0	” As a matter of business it was a good idea to get the notion around that the thing was difficult . Many a small thing has been made large by the right kind of advertising . That monk was filled up with the difficulty of this enterprise ; he would fill up the others . In two days the solicitude would be booming . On my way home at noon , I met Sandy . She had been sampling the hermits . I said : “
63856	63857	63862	63862	you	0	” “
63866	63867	63862	63862	you	0	” “
63876	63877	63871	63871	they	2380	” “
63880	63881	63882	63883	The hermits	5274	” “
63888	63889	63882	63883	The hermits	5274	” “
63893	63894	63882	63883	The hermits	5274	” “
63913	63914	63907	63907	they	2380	” “
63918	63919	63907	63907	they	2380	” “
63966	63967	63954	63954	they	2380	” “
63973	63974	63954	63954	they	2380	” “
63999	64000	63989	63989	You	0	” “
64348	65288	64321	64321	you	2390	” I could n't make it all out -- that is , the details -- but I got the general idea ; and enough of it , too , to be ashamed . It was not fair to spring those nineteenth century technicalities upon the untutored infant of the sixth and then rail at her because she could n't get their drift ; and when she was making the honest best drive at it she could , too , and no fault of hers that she could n't fetch the home plate ; and so I apologized . Then we meandered pleasantly away toward the hermit holes in sociable converse together , and better friends than ever . I was gradually coming to have a mysterious and shuddery reverence for this girl ; nowadays whenever she pulled out from the station and got her train fairly started on one of those horizonless transcontinental sentences of hers , it was borne in upon me that I was standing in the awful presence of the Mother of the German Language . I was so impressed with this , that sometimes when she began to empty one of these sentences on me I unconsciously took the very attitude of reverence , and stood uncovered ; and if words had been water , I had been drowned , sure . She had exactly the German way ; whatever was in her mind to be delivered , whether a mere remark , or a sermon , or a cyclopedia , or the history of a war , she would get it into a single sentence or die . Whenever the literary German dives into a sentence , that is the last you are going to see of him till he emerges on the other side of his Atlantic with his verb in his mouth . We drifted from hermit to hermit all the afternoon . It was a most strange menagerie . The chief emulation among them seemed to be , to see which could manage to be the uncleanest and most prosperous with vermin . Their manner and attitudes were the last expression of complacent self - righteousness . It was one anchorite 's pride to lie naked in the mud and let the insects bite him and blister him unmolested ; it was another 's to lean against a rock , all day long , conspicuous to the admiration of the throng of pilgrims and pray ; it was another 's to go naked and crawl around on all fours ; it was another 's to drag about with him , year in and year out , eighty pounds of iron ; it was another 's to never lie down when he slept , but to stand among the thorn - bushes and snore when there were pilgrims around to look ; a woman , who had the white hair of age , and no other apparel , was black from crown to heel with forty - seven years of holy abstinence from water . Groups of gazing pilgrims stood around all and every of these strange objects , lost in reverent wonder , and envious of the fleckless sanctity which these pious austerities had won for them from an exacting heaven . By and by we went to see one of the supremely great ones . He was a mighty celebrity ; his fame had penetrated all Christendom ; the noble and the renowned journeyed from the remotest lands on the globe to pay him reverence . His stand was in the center of the widest part of the valley ; and it took all that space to hold his crowds . His stand was a pillar sixty feet high , with a broad platform on the top of it . He was now doing what he had been doing every day for twenty years up there -- bowing his body ceaselessly and rapidly almost to his feet . It was his way of praying . I timed him with a stop watch , and he made 1,244 revolutions in 24 minutes and 46 seconds . It seemed a pity to have all this power going to waste . It was one of the most useful motions in mechanics , the pedal movement ; so I made a note in my memorandum book , purposing some day to apply a system of elastic cords to him and run a sewing machine with it . I afterward carried out that scheme , and got five years ' good service out of him ; in which time he turned out upward of eighteen thousand first - rate tow - linen shirts , which was ten a day . I worked him Sundays and all ; he was going , Sundays , the same as week days , and it was no use to waste the power . These shirts cost me nothing but just the mere trifle for the materials -- I furnished those myself , it would not have been right to make him do that -- and they sold like smoke to pilgrims at a dollar and a half apiece , which was the price of fifty cows or a blooded race horse in Arthurdom . They were regarded as a perfect protection against sin , and advertised as such by my knights everywhere , with the paint - pot and stencil - plate ; insomuch that there was not a cliff or a boulder or a dead wall in England but you could read on it at a mile distance : “
65305	65631	65641	65641	partner	2395	” There was more money in the business than one knew what to do with . As it extended , I brought out a line of goods suitable for kings , and a nobby thing for duchesses and that sort , with ruffles down the forehatch and the running - gear clewed up with a featherstitch to leeward and then hauled aft with a back - stay and triced up with a half - turn in the standing rigging forward of the weather - gaskets . Yes , it was a daisy . But about that time I noticed that the motive power had taken to standing on one leg , and I found that there was something the matter with the other one ; so I stocked the business and unloaded , taking Sir Bors de Ganis into camp financially along with certain of his friends ; for the works stopped within a year , and the good saint got him to his rest . But he had earned it . I can say that for him . When I saw him that first time -- however , his personal condition will not quite bear description here . You can read it in the Lives of the Saints . * [ * All the details concerning the hermits , in this chapter , are from Lecky -- but greatly modified . This book not being a history but only a tale , the majority of the historian 's frank details were too strong for reproduction in it.--_Editor _ ] CHAPTER XXIII RESTORATION OF THE FOUNTAIN Saturday noon I went to the well and looked on a while . Merlin was still burning smoke - powders , and pawing the air , and muttering gibberish as hard as ever , but looking pretty down - hearted , for of course he had not started even a perspiration in that well yet . Finally I said : “
65643	65644	65641	65641	partner	2395	” “
65688	65825	65685	65685	I	0	” He raised a smoke this time that darkened all the region , and must have made matters uncomfortable for the hermits , for the wind was their way , and it rolled down over their dens in a dense and billowy fog . He poured out volumes of speech to match , and contorted his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most extraordinary way . At the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting , and about exhausted . Now arrived the abbot and several hundred monks and nuns , and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple of acres of foundlings , all drawn by the prodigious smoke , and all in a grand state of excitement . The abbot inquired anxiously for results . Merlin said : “
65959	65990	65994	65994	him	0	” Of course this threw the abbot into a good deal of a consternation . He turned to me with the signs of it in his face , and said : “
66000	66001	65994	65994	him	0	” “
66007	66008	65994	65994	him	0	” “

66434	67789	66430	66432	John W. Merlin	248	” It was a home shot , and it made him wince ; for he was the worst weather - failure in the kingdom . Whenever he ordered up the danger - signals along the coast there was a week 's dead calm , sure , and every time he prophesied fair weather it rained brickbats . But I kept him in the weather bureau right along , to undermine his reputation . However , that shot raised his bile , and instead of starting home to report my death , he said he would remain and enjoy it . My two experts arrived in the evening , and pretty well fagged , for they had traveled double tides . They had pack - mules along , and had brought everything I needed -- tools , pump , lead pipe , Greek fire , sheaves of big rockets , roman candles , colored fire sprays , electric apparatus , and a lot of sundries -- everything necessary for the stateliest kind of a miracle . They got their supper and a nap , and about midnight we sallied out through a solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite overpassed the required conditions . We took possession of the well and its surroundings . My boys were experts in all sorts of things , from the stoning up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical instrument . An hour before sunrise we had that leak mended in ship - shape fashion , and the water began to rise . Then we stowed our fireworks in the chapel , locked up the place , and went home to bed . Before the noon mass was over , we were at the well again ; for there was a deal to do yet , and I was determined to spring the miracle before midnight , for business reasons : for whereas a miracle worked for the Church on a week - day is worth a good deal , it is worth six times as much if you get it in on a Sunday . In nine hours the water had risen to its customary level -- that is to say , it was within twenty - three feet of the top . We put in a little iron pump , one of the first turned out by my works near the capital ; we bored into a stone reservoir which stood against the outer wall of the well - chamber and inserted a section of lead pipe that was long enough to reach to the door of the chapel and project beyond the threshold , where the gushing water would be visible to the two hundred and fifty acres of people I was intending should be present on the flat plain in front of this little holy hillock at the proper time . We knocked the head out of an empty hogshead and hoisted this hogshead to the flat roof of the chapel , where we clamped it down fast , poured in gunpowder till it lay loosely an inch deep on the bottom , then we stood up rockets in the hogshead as thick as they could loosely stand , all the different breeds of rockets there are ; and they made a portly and imposing sheaf , I can tell you . We grounded the wire of a pocket electrical battery in that powder , we placed a whole magazine of Greek fire on each corner of the roof -- blue on one corner , green on another , red on another , and purple on the last -- and grounded a wire in each . About two hundred yards off , in the flat , we built a pen of scantlings , about four feet high , and laid planks on it , and so made a platform . We covered it with swell tapestries borrowed for the occasion , and topped it off with the abbot 's own throne . When you are going to do a miracle for an ignorant race , you want to get in every detail that will count ; you want to make all the properties impressive to the public eye ; you want to make matters comfortable for your head guest ; then you can turn yourself loose and play your effects for all they are worth . I know the value of these things , for I know human nature . You ca n't throw too much style into a miracle . It costs trouble , and work , and sometimes money ; but it pays in the end . Well , we brought the wires to the ground at the chapel , and then brought them under the ground to the platform , and hid the batteries there . We put a rope fence a hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the common multitude , and that finished the work . My idea was , doors open at 10:30 , performance to begin at 11:25 sharp . I wished I could charge admission , but of course that would n't answer . I instructed my boys to be in the chapel as early as 10 , before anybody was around , and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time , and make the fur fly . Then we went home to supper . The news of the disaster to the well had traveled far by this time ; and now for two or three days a steady avalanche of people had been pouring into the valley . The lower end of the valley was become one huge camp ; we should have a good house , no question about that . Criers went the rounds early in the evening and announced the coming attempt , which put every pulse up to fever heat . They gave notice that the abbot and his official suite would move in state and occupy the platform at 10:30 , up to which time all the region which was under my ban must be clear ; the bells would then cease from tolling , and this sign should be permission to the multitudes to close in and take their places . I was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the abbot 's solemn procession hove in sight -- which it did not do till it was nearly to the rope fence , because it was a starless black night and no torches permitted . With it came Merlin , and took a front seat on the platform ; he was as good as his word for once . One could not see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban , but they were there , just the same . The moment the bells stopped , those banked masses broke and poured over the line like a vast black wave , and for as much as a half hour it continued to flow , and then it solidified itself , and you could have walked upon a pavement of human heads to -- well , miles . We had a solemn stage - wait , now , for about twenty minutes -- a thing I had counted on for effect ; it is always good to let your audience have a chance to work up its expectancy . At length , out of the silence a noble Latin chant -- men 's voices -- broke and swelled up and rolled away into the night , a majestic tide of melody . I had put that up , too , and it was one of the best effects I ever invented . When it was finished I stood up on the platform and extended my hands abroad , for two minutes , with my face uplifted -- that always produces a dead hush -- and then slowly pronounced this ghastly word with a kind of awfulness which caused hundreds to tremble , and many women to faint : “
67792	67923	66430	66432	John W. Merlin	248	” Just as I was moaning out the closing hunks of that word , I touched off one of my electric connections and all that murky world of people stood revealed in a hideous blue glare ! It was immense --that effect ! Lots of people shrieked , women curled up and quit in every direction , foundlings collapsed by platoons . The abbot and the monks crossed themselves nimbly and their lips fluttered with agitated prayers . Merlin held his grip , but he was astonished clear down to his corns ; he had never seen anything to begin with that , before . Now was the time to pile in the effects . I lifted my hands and groaned out this word -- as it were in agony : “
67926	67959	66430	66432	John W. Merlin	248	” --and turned on the red fire ! You should have heard that Atlantic of people moan and howl when that crimson hell joined the blue ! After sixty seconds I shouted : “
67963	67996	66430	66432	John W. Merlin	248	” --and lit up the green fire ! After waiting only forty seconds this time , I spread my arms abroad and thundered out the devastating syllables of this word of words : “
67999	68096	66430	66432	John W. Merlin	248	” --and whirled on the purple glare ! There they were , all going at once , red , blue , green , purple!--four furious volcanoes pouring vast clouds of radiant smoke aloft , and spreading a blinding rainbowed noonday to the furthest confines of that valley . In the distance one could see that fellow on the pillar standing rigid against the background of sky , his seesaw stopped for the first time in twenty years . I knew the boys were at the pump now and ready . So I said to the abbot : “
68131	68139	68230	68230	Lo	135	” Then I shouted to the people : “
68180	68229	68230	68230	Lo	135	” I stood a few moments , to let the hearers have a chance to spread my announcement to those who could n't hear , and so convey it to the furthest ranks , then I made a grand exhibition of extra posturing and gesturing , and shouted : “
68289	68945	68283	68283	I	0	” Then I touched off the hogshead of rockets , and a vast fountain of dazzling lances of fire vomited itself toward the zenith with a hissing rush , and burst in mid - sky into a storm of flashing jewels ! One mighty groan of terror started up from the massed people --then suddenly broke into a wild hosannah of joy -- for there , fair and plain in the uncanny glare , they saw the freed water leaping forth ! The old abbot could not speak a word , for tears and the chokings in his throat ; without utterance of any sort , he folded me in his arms and mashed me . It was more eloquent than speech . And harder to get over , too , in a country where there were really no doctors that were worth a damaged nickel . You should have seen those acres of people throw themselves down in that water and kiss it ; kiss it , and pet it , and fondle it , and talk to it as if it were alive , and welcome it back with the dear names they gave their darlings , just as if it had been a friend who was long gone away and lost , and was come home again . Yes , it was pretty to see , and made me think more of them than I had done before . I sent Merlin home on a shutter . He had caved in and gone down like a landslide when I pronounced that fearful name , and had never come to since . He never had heard that name before,--neither had I -- but to him it was the right one . Any jumble would have been the right one . He admitted , afterward , that that spirit 's own mother could not have pronounced that name better than I did . He never could understand how I survived it , and I did n't tell him . It is only young magicians that give away a secret like that . Merlin spent three months working enchantments to try to find out the deep trick of how to pronounce that name and outlive it . But he did n't arrive . When I started to the chapel , the populace uncovered and fell back reverently to make a wide way for me , as if I had been some kind of a superior being -- and I was . I was aware of that . I took along a night shift of monks , and taught them the mystery of the pump , and set them to work , for it was plain that a good part of the people out there were going to sit up with the water all night , consequently it was but right that they should have all they wanted of it . To those monks that pump was a good deal of a miracle itself , and they were full of wonder over it ; and of admiration , too , of the exceeding effectiveness of its performance . It was a great night , an immense night . There was reputation in it . I could hardly get to sleep for glorying over it . CHAPTER XXIV A RIVAL MAGICIAN My influence in the Valley of Holiness was something prodigious now . It seemed worth while to try to turn it to some valuable account . The thought came to me the next morning , and was suggested by my seeing one of my knights who was in the soap line come riding in . According to history , the monks of this place two centuries before had been worldly minded enough to want to wash . It might be that there was a leaven of this unrighteousness still remaining . So I sounded a Brother : “
68953	68977	68978	68978	One	434	” He shuddered at the thought -- the thought of the peril of it to the well -- but he said with feeling : “
69026	69156	69003	69003	God	121	” And then he sighed in such a sorrowful way that I was resolved he should have at least one layer of his real estate removed , if it sized up my whole influence and bankrupted the pile . So I went to the abbot and asked for a permit for this Brother . He blenched at the idea -- I do n't mean that you could see him blench , for of course you could n't see it without you scraped him , and I did n't care enough about it to scrape him , but I knew the blench was there , just the same , and within a book - cover 's thickness of the surface , too -- blenched , and trembled . He said : “
69197	69198	69189	69189	you	2341	” “
69238	69253	69254	69254	My	0	” A large interest began to show up in the old man 's face . “
69277	69278	69329	69329	this?--you	2426	” “
69295	69296	69338	69338	you	2341	” “
69325	69326	69327	69327	You	2341	” “
69342	69343	69344	69344	I	0	” “
69349	69350	69344	69344	I	0	” “
69377	69996	69368	69368	Tarry	251	” I and my boys were at work , straight off . The ruins of the old bath were there yet in the basement of the monastery , not a stone missing . They had been left just so , all these lifetimes , and avoided with a pious fear , as things accursed . In two days we had it all done and the water in -- a spacious pool of clear pure water that a body could swim in . It was running water , too . It came in , and went out , through the ancient pipes . The old abbot kept his word , and was the first to try it . He went down black and shaky , leaving the whole black community above troubled and worried and full of bodings ; but he came back white and joyful , and the game was made ! another triumph scored . It was a good campaign that we made in that Valley of Holiness , and I was very well satisfied , and ready to move on now , but I struck a disappointment . I caught a heavy cold , and it started up an old lurking rheumatism of mine . Of course the rheumatism hunted up my weakest place and located itself there . This was the place where the abbot put his arms about me and mashed me , what time he was moved to testify his gratitude to me with an embrace . When at last I got out , I was a shadow . But everybody was full of attentions and kindnesses , and these brought cheer back into my life , and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly up toward health and strength again ; so I gained fast . Sandy was worn out with nursing ; so I made up my mind to turn out and go a cruise alone , leaving her at the nunnery to rest up . My idea was to disguise myself as a freeman of peasant degree and wander through the country a week or two on foot . This would give me a chance to eat and lodge with the lowliest and poorest class of free citizens on equal terms . There was no other way to inform myself perfectly of their everyday life and the operation of the laws upon it . If I went among them as a gentleman , there would be restraints and conventionalities which would shut me out from their private joys and troubles , and I should get no further than the outside shell . One morning I was out on a long walk to get up muscle for my trip , and had climbed the ridge which bordered the northern extremity of the valley , when I came upon an artificial opening in the face of a low precipice , and recognized it by its location as a hermitage which had often been pointed out to me from a distance as the den of a hermit of high renown for dirt and austerity . I knew he had lately been offered a situation in the Great Sahara , where lions and sandflies made the hermit - life peculiarly attractive and difficult , and had gone to Africa to take possession , so I thought I would look in and see how the atmosphere of this den agreed with its reputation . My surprise was great : the place was newly swept and scoured . Then there was another surprise . Back in the gloom of the cavern I heard the clink of a little bell , and then this exclamation : “
70055	70129	70052	70052	him	2429	” Now what a radical reversal of things this was ; what a jumbling together of extravagant incongruities ; what a fantastic conjunction of opposites and irreconcilables -- the home of the bogus miracle become the home of a real one , the den of a mediaeval hermit turned into a telephone office ! The telephone clerk stepped into the light , and I recognized one of my young fellows . I said : “
70141	70142	70139	70139	Ulfius	253	” “
70191	70192	70183	70183	they	2435	” “
70222	70223	70216	70216	you	253	” “
70275	70276	70250	70250	I	0	” “
70286	70314	70315	70315	I	0	” It did n't take ; I mean , he did n't start at the name , as I had supposed he would . He merely said : “
70321	70322	70315	70315	I	0	” “
70348	70349	70341	70341	You	253	” “
70379	70380	70383	70383	they	2445	” “
70409	70410	70393	70393	they	2445	” “
70447	70448	70501	70501	you	253	” “
70456	70457	70501	70501	you	253	” “
70463	70464	70501	70501	you	253	” “
70514	70558	70501	70501	you	253	” He did it , and had Clarence sent for . It was good to hear my boy 's voice again . It was like being home . After some affectionate interchanges , and some account of my late illness , I said : “
70563	70564	70501	70501	you	253	” “
70657	70658	70639	70639	I	0	” “
70669	70670	70660	70661	the king	4445	” “
70715	70716	70671	70672	The king?--no	254	” “
70725	70726	70671	70672	The king?--no	254	” “
70738	70739	70671	70672	The king?--no	254	” “
70748	70749	70750	70751	The king	4445	” “
70772	70773	70750	70751	The king	4445	” “
70805	70806	70763	70763	him	4445	” “
70829	70830	70822	70827	one West Pointer in that regiment	2465	” “
70842	70843	70838	70838	you	253	” “
70852	70853	70848	70848	I	0	” “
70874	70875	70861	70863	Who were chosen	2467	” “

70918	70919	70916	70916	Clarence	131	” “
70956	70957	70950	70950	you	253	” “
71008	71009	70997	70997	he	518	” “
71033	71439	71027	71027	me	0	” It sounded good ! In this atmosphere of telephones and lightning communication with distant regions , I was breathing the breath of life again after long suffocation . I realized , then , what a creepy , dull , inanimate horror this land had been to me all these years , and how I had been in such a stifled condition of mind as to have grown used to it almost beyond the power to notice it . I gave my order to the superintendent of the Academy personally . I also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and a box or so of safety matches . I was getting tired of doing without these conveniences . I could have them now , as I was n't going to wear armor any more at present , and therefore could get at my pockets . When I got back to the monastery , I found a thing of interest going on . The abbot and his monks were assembled in the great hall , observing with childish wonder and faith the performances of a new magician , a fresh arrival . His dress was the extreme of the fantastic ; as showy and foolish as the sort of thing an Indian medicine - man wears . He was mowing , and mumbling , and gesticulating , and drawing mystical figures in the air and on the floor,--the regular thing , you know . He was a celebrity from Asia -- so he said , and that was enough . That sort of evidence was as good as gold , and passed current everywhere . How easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this fellow 's terms . His specialty was to tell you what any individual on the face of the globe was doing at the moment ; and what he had done at any time in the past , and what he would do at any time in the future . He asked if any would like to know what the Emperor of the East was doing now ? The sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing of hands made eloquent answer -- this reverend crowd _ would _ like to know what that monarch was at , just as this moment . The fraud went through some more mummery , and then made grave announcement : “
71477	71489	71025	71025	Prithee	129	” A buzz of admiring exclamations broke out , all around : “
71494	71495	71025	71025	Prithee	129	” “
71498	71499	71025	71025	Prithee	129	” “
71516	71671	71025	71025	Prithee	129	” Would they like to know what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing ? Yes . He told them what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing . Then he told them what the Sultan of Egypt was at ; also what the King of the Remote Seas was about . And so on and so on ; and with each new marvel the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher . They thought he must surely strike an uncertain place some time ; but no , he never had to hesitate , he always knew , and always with unerring precision . I saw that if this thing went on I should lose my supremacy , this fellow would capture my following , I should be left out in the cold . I must put a cog in his wheel , and do it right away , too . I said : “
71691	71692	71025	71025	Prithee	129	” “
71703	71704	71698	71698	I	0	” “
71713	71714	71715	71715	My	0	” “
71738	71781	71732	71732	I	0	” You see , I was working up the interest . It was getting pretty high , too ; you could see that by the craning necks all around , and the half - suspended breathing . So now I climaxed it : “
71808	71809	71799	71799	I	0	” “
71824	71825	71815	71815	I	0	” “
71838	71839	71830	71830	I	0	” “
71844	71924	71830	71830	I	0	” There was a general gasp of surprise . It had not occurred to anybody in the crowd -- that simple trick of inquiring about somebody who was n't ten thousand miles away . The magician was hit hard ; it was an emergency that had never happened in his experience before , and it corked him ; he did n't know how to meet it . He looked stunned , confused ; he could n't say a word . “
71927	71931	71934	71934	you	2480	” I said , “
72003	72009	71994	71994	they	2484	” He was still dumb . “
72052	72138	72046	72050	a mere fraud and liar	2488	” This distressed the monks and terrified them . They were not used to hearing these awful beings called names , and they did not know what might be the consequence . There was a dead silence now ; superstitious bodings were in every mind . The magician began to pull his wits together , and when he presently smiled an easy , nonchalant smile , it spread a mighty relief around ; for it indicated that his mood was not destructive . He said : “
72233	72234	72254	72254	anybody	553	” “
72267	72268	72260	72260	anybody	553	” “
72287	72288	72292	72292	meseemeth	256	” “
72298	72314	72292	72292	meseemeth	256	” said the abbot , who saw his opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster , “
72355	72356	72351	72352	Our Arthur	2505	” “
72363	72369	72358	72358	you	2496	” broke in the enchanter . “
72378	72406	72358	72358	you	2496	” Everybody was full of awe and interest again right away , the incorrigible idiots . They watched the incantations absorbingly , and looked at me with a “
72418	72426	72413	72413	you	2496	” air , when the announcement came : “
72448	72449	72450	72450	God	121	” “
72456	72465	72450	72450	God	121	” said the abbot , and crossed himself ; “
72480	72481	72450	72450	God	121	” “
72493	72497	72450	72450	God	121	” I said , “
72509	72546	72505	72506	the king	4445	” Here was trouble again -- a conflict of authority . Nobody knew which of us to believe ; I still had some reputation left . The magician 's scorn was stirred , and he said : “
72585	72586	72587	72587	You	135	” “
72619	72659	72660	72660	They	2515	” When it comes to sarcasming , I reckon I know how to keep my end up . That jab made this fellow squirm . The abbot inquired after the queen and the court , and got this information : “
72677	72681	72660	72660	They	2515	” I said : “
72738	72739	72740	72740	They	2515	” “
72765	72766	72757	72757	they	2515	” “
72781	72782	72757	72757	they	2515	” “
72798	72799	72757	72757	they	2515	” “
72842	72880	72882	72883	the king	4445	” _ That _ was a noble shot ! It set the abbot and the monks in a whirl of excitement , and it rocked the enchanter to his base . I followed the thing right up : “
72909	74293	72900	72900	I	0	” Next day I went up to the telephone office and found that the king had passed through two towns that were on the line . I spotted his progress on the succeeding day in the same way . I kept these matters to myself . The third day 's reports showed that if he kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon . There was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming ; there seemed to be no preparations making to receive him in state ; a strange thing , truly . Only one thing could explain this : that other magician had been cutting under me , sure . This was true . I asked a friend of mine , a monk , about it , and he said , yes , the magician had tried some further enchantments and found out that the court had concluded to make no journey at all , but stay at home . Think of that ! Observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country . These people had seen me do the very showiest bit of magic in history , and the only one within their memory that had a positive value , and yet here they were , ready to take up with an adventurer who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere unproven word . However , it was not good politics to let the king come without any fuss and feathers at all , so I went down and drummed up a procession of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and started them out at two o'clock to meet him . And that was the sort of state he arrived in . The abbot was helpless with rage and humiliation when I brought him out on a balcony and showed him the head of the state marching in and never a monk on hand to offer him welcome , and no stir of life or clang of joy - bell to glad his spirit . He took one look and then flew to rouse out his forces . The next minute the bells were dinning furiously , and the various buildings were vomiting monks and nuns , who went swarming in a rush toward the coming procession ; and with them went that magician --and he was on a rail , too , by the abbot 's order ; and his reputation was in the mud , and mine was in the sky again . Yes , a man can keep his trademark current in such a country , but he ca n't sit around and do it ; he has got to be on deck and attending to business right along . CHAPTER XXV A COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION When the king traveled for change of air , or made a progress , or visited a distant noble whom he wished to bankrupt with the cost of his keep , part of the administration moved with him . It was a fashion of the time . The Commission charged with the examination of candidates for posts in the army came with the king to the Valley , whereas they could have transacted their business just as well at home . And although this expedition was strictly a holiday excursion for the king , he kept some of his business functions going just the same . He touched for the evil , as usual ; he held court in the gate at sunrise and tried cases , for he was himself Chief Justice of the King 's Bench . He shone very well in this latter office . He was a wise and humane judge , and he clearly did his honest best and fairest,--according to his lights . That is a large reservation . His lights -- I mean his rearing -- often colored his decisions . Whenever there was a dispute between a noble or gentleman and a person of lower degree , the king 's leanings and sympathies were for the former class always , whether he suspected it or not . It was impossible that this should be otherwise . The blunting effects of slavery upon the slaveholder 's moral perceptions are known and conceded , the world over ; and a privileged class , an aristocracy , is but a band of slaveholders under another name . This has a harsh sound , and yet should not be offensive to any -- even to the noble himself -- unless the fact itself be an offense : for the statement simply formulates a fact . The repulsive feature of slavery is the _ thing _ , not its name . One needs but to hear an aristocrat speak of the classes that are below him to recognize -- and in but indifferently modified measure --the very air and tone of the actual slaveholder ; and behind these are the slaveholder 's spirit , the slaveholder 's blunted feeling . They are the result of the same cause in both cases : the possessor 's old and inbred custom of regarding himself as a superior being . The king 's judgments wrought frequent injustices , but it was merely the fault of his training , his natural and unalterable sympathies . He was as unfitted for a judgeship as would be the average mother for the position of milk - distributor to starving children in famine - time ; her own children would fare a shade better than the rest . One very curious case came before the king . A young girl , an orphan , who had a considerable estate , married a fine young fellow who had nothing . The girl 's property was within a seigniory held by the Church . The bishop of the diocese , an arrogant scion of the great nobility , claimed the girl 's estate on the ground that she had married privately , and thus had cheated the Church out of one of its rights as lord of the seigniory -- the one heretofore referred to as le droit du seigneur . The penalty of refusal or avoidance was confiscation . The girl 's defense was , that the lordship of the seigniory was vested in the bishop , and the particular right here involved was not transferable , but must be exercised by the lord himself or stand vacated ; and that an older law , of the Church itself , strictly barred the bishop from exercising it . It was a very odd case , indeed . It reminded me of something I had read in my youth about the ingenious way in which the aldermen of London raised the money that built the Mansion House . A person who had not taken the Sacrament according to the Anglican rite could not stand as a candidate for sheriff of London . Thus Dissenters were ineligible ; they could not run if asked , they could not serve if elected . The aldermen , who without any question were Yankees in disguise , hit upon this neat device : they passed a by - law imposing a fine of L400 upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for sheriff , and a fine of L600 upon any person who , after being elected sheriff , refused to serve . Then they went to work and elected a lot of Dissenters , one after another , and kept it up until they had collected L15,000 in fines ; and there stands the stately Mansion House to this day , to keep the blushing citizen in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of Yankees slipped into London and played games of the sort that has given their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good and holy peoples that be in the earth . The girl 's case seemed strong to me ; the bishop 's case was just as strong . I did not see how the king was going to get out of this hole . But he got out . I append his decision : “
74490	74779	75334	75334	Webster	260	” Here was a tragic end to a beautiful honeymoon not yet three months old . Poor young creatures ! They had lived these three months lapped to the lips in worldly comforts . These clothes and trinkets they were wearing were as fine and dainty as the shrewdest stretch of the sumptuary laws allowed to people of their degree ; and in these pretty clothes , she crying on his shoulder , and he trying to comfort her with hopeful words set to the music of despair , they went from the judgment seat out into the world homeless , bedless , breadless ; why , the very beggars by the roadsides were not so poor as they . Well , the king was out of the hole ; and on terms satisfactory to the Church and the rest of the aristocracy , no doubt . Men write many fine and plausible arguments in support of monarchy , but the fact remains that where every man in a State has a vote , brutal laws are impossible . Arthur 's people were of course poor material for a republic , because they had been debased so long by monarchy ; and yet even they would have been intelligent enough to make short work of that law which the king had just been administering if it had been submitted to their full and free vote . There is a phrase which has grown so common in the world 's mouth that it has come to seem to have sense and meaning -- the sense and meaning implied when it is used ; that is the phrase which refers to this or that or the other nation as possibly being “
74785	75312	75356	75356	Weaver!--God	262	” ; and the implied sense of it is , that there has been a nation somewhere , some time or other which _ was n't _ capable of it -- wasn't as able to govern itself as some self - appointed specialists were or would be to govern it . The master minds of all nations , in all ages , have sprung in affluent multitude from the mass of the nation , and from the mass of the nation only -- not from its privileged classes ; and so , no matter what the nation 's intellectual grade was ; whether high or low , the bulk of its ability was in the long ranks of its nameless and its poor , and so it never saw the day that it had not the material in abundance whereby to govern itself . Which is to assert an always self - proven fact : that even the best governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still behind the best condition attainable by its people ; and that the same is true of kindred governments of lower grades , all the way down to the lowest . King Arthur had hurried up the army business altogether beyond my calculations . I had not supposed he would move in the matter while I was away ; and so I had not mapped out a scheme for determining the merits of officers ; I had only remarked that it would be wise to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination ; and privately I meant to put together a list of military qualifications that nobody could answer to but my West Pointers . That ought to have been attended to before I left ; for the king was so taken with the idea of a standing army that he could n't wait but must get about it at once , and get up as good a scheme of examination as he could invent out of his own head . I was impatient to see what this was ; and to show , too , how much more admirable was the one which I should display to the Examining Board . I intimated this , gently , to the king , and it fired his curiosity . When the Board was assembled , I followed him in ; and behind us came the candidates . One of these candidates was a bright young West Pointer of mine , and with him were a couple of my West Point professors . When I saw the Board , I did not know whether to cry or to laugh . The head of it was the officer known to later centuries as Norroy King - at - Arms ! The two other members were chiefs of bureaus in his department ; and all three were priests , of course ; all officials who had to know how to read and write were priests . My candidate was called first , out of courtesy to me , and the head of the Board opened on him with official solemnity : “
75315	75316	75317	75317	Mal	259	” “
75321	75322	75317	75317	Mal	259	” “
75326	75327	75328	75328	Webster	260	” “
75330	75331	75332	75332	Webster	260	” “
75350	75351	75352	75352	Weaver	261	” “
75354	75355	75352	75352	Weaver	261	” “
75360	75394	75356	75356	Weaver!--God	262	” The king was staggered , from his summit to his foundations ; one clerk fainted , and the others came near it . The chairman pulled himself together , and said indignantly : “
75403	75766	75352	75352	Weaver	261	” But I appealed to the king . I begged that my candidate might be examined . The king was willing , but the Board , who were all well - born folk , implored the king to spare them the indignity of examining the weaver 's son . I knew they did n't know enough to examine him anyway , so I joined my prayers to theirs and the king turned the duty over to my professors . I had had a blackboard prepared , and it was put up now , and the circus began . It was beautiful to hear the lad lay out the science of war , and wallow in details of battle and siege , of supply , transportation , mining and countermining , grand tactics , big strategy and little strategy , signal service , infantry , cavalry , artillery , and all about siege guns , field guns , gatling guns , rifled guns , smooth bores , musket practice , revolver practice -- and not a solitary word of it all could these catfish make head or tail of , you understand -- and it was handsome to see him chalk off mathematical nightmares on the blackboard that would stump the angels themselves , and do it like nothing , too -- all about eclipses , and comets , and solstices , and constellations , and mean time , and sidereal time , and dinner time , and bedtime , and every other imaginable thing above the clouds or under them that you could harry or bullyrag an enemy with and make him wish he had n't come -- and when the boy made his military salute and stood aside at last , I was proud enough to hug him , and all those other people were so dazed they looked partly petrified , partly drunk , and wholly caught out and snowed under . I judged that the cake was ours , and by a large majority . Education is a great thing . This was the same youth who had come to West Point so ignorant that when I asked him , “
75790	75797	75802	75802	himself	2539	” answered up naively and said : “
75804	75828	75802	75802	himself	2539	” One of the young nobles was called up now . I thought I would question him a little myself . I said : “
75834	75847	75830	75831	your lordship	2540	” His face flushed indignantly , and he fired this at me : “
75863	75864	75802	75802	himself	2539	” “
75869	75880	75802	75802	himself	2539	” He crowded his wrath down and made out to answer “
75883	75884	75802	75802	himself	2539	” “
75889	75902	75886	75886	you	2539	” He wanted to resent this , too , but I said : “
75941	75942	75938	75938	you	2539	” “
75945	75946	75938	75938	you	2539	” “

Why , he had all the earmarks of a typewriter copyist , if you leave out the disposition to contribute uninvited emendations of your grammar and punctuation . It was unaccountable that he did n't attempt a little help of that sort out of his majestic supply of incapacity for the job . But that did n't prove that he had n't material in him for the disposition , it only proved that he was n't a typewriter copyist yet . After nagging him a little more , I let the professors loose on him and they turned him inside out , on the line of scientific war , and found him empty , of course . He knew somewhat about the warfare of the time -- bushwhacking around for ogres , and bull - fights in the tournament ring , and such things -- but otherwise he was empty and useless . Then we took the other young noble in hand , and he was the first one 's twin , for ignorance and incapacity . I delivered them into the hands of the chairman of the Board with the comfortable consciousness that their cake was dough . They were examined in the previous order of precedence . “

77212	77250	77209	77209	his	2590	” The competitor came forward and proved exactly four generations of nobility himself . So there was a tie in military qualifications that far . He stood aside a moment , and Sir Pertipole was questioned further : “

77437	78609	78610	78610	Thou	2605	” I was down in the bottomless pit of humiliation . I had promised myself an easy and zenith - scouring triumph , and this was the outcome ! I was almost ashamed to look my poor disappointed cadet in the face . I told him to go home and be patient , this was n't the end . I had a private audience with the king , and made a proposition . I said it was quite right to officer that regiment with nobilities , and he could n't have done a wiser thing . It would also be a good idea to add five hundred officers to it ; in fact , add as many officers as there were nobles and relatives of nobles in the country , even if there should finally be five times as many officers as privates in it ; and thus make it the crack regiment , the envied regiment , the King 's Own regiment , and entitled to fight on its own hook and in its own way , and go whither it would and come when it pleased , in time of war , and be utterly swell and independent . This would make that regiment the heart 's desire of all the nobility , and they would all be satisfied and happy . Then we would make up the rest of the standing army out of commonplace materials , and officer it with nobodies , as was proper -- nobodies selected on a basis of mere efficiency -- and we would make this regiment toe the line , allow it no aristocratic freedom from restraint , and force it to do all the work and persistent hammering , to the end that whenever the King 's Own was tired and wanted to go off for a change and rummage around amongst ogres and have a good time , it could go without uneasiness , knowing that matters were in safe hands behind it , and business going to be continued at the old stand , same as usual . The king was charmed with the idea . When I noticed that , it gave me a valuable notion . I thought I saw my way out of an old and stubborn difficulty at last . You see , the royalties of the Pendragon stock were a long - lived race and very fruitful . Whenever a child was born to any of these --and it was pretty often -- there was wild joy in the nation 's mouth , and piteous sorrow in the nation 's heart . The joy was questionable , but the grief was honest . Because the event meant another call for a Royal Grant . Long was the list of these royalties , and they were a heavy and steadily increasing burden upon the treasury and a menace to the crown . Yet Arthur could not believe this latter fact , and he would not listen to any of my various projects for substituting something in the place of the royal grants . If I could have persuaded him to now and then provide a support for one of these outlying scions from his own pocket , I could have made a grand to - do over it , and it would have had a good effect with the nation ; but no , he would n't hear of such a thing . He had something like a religious passion for royal grant ; he seemed to look upon it as a sort of sacred swag , and one could not irritate him in any way so quickly and so surely as by an attack upon that venerable institution . If I ventured to cautiously hint that there was not another respectable family in England that would humble itself to hold out the hat -- however , that is as far as I ever got ; he always cut me short there , and peremptorily , too . But I believed I saw my chance at last . I would form this crack regiment out of officers alone -- not a single private . Half of it should consist of nobles , who should fill all the places up to Major - General , and serve gratis and pay their own expenses ; and they would be glad to do this when they should learn that the rest of the regiment would consist exclusively of princes of the blood . These princes of the blood should range in rank from Lieutenant - General up to Field Marshal , and be gorgeously salaried and equipped and fed by the state . Moreover -- and this was the master stroke --it should be decreed that these princely grandees should be always addressed by a stunningly gaudy and awe - compelling title ( which I would presently invent ) , and they and they only in all England should be so addressed . Finally , all princes of the blood should have free choice ; join that regiment , get that great title , and renounce the royal grant , or stay out and receive a grant . Neatest touch of all : unborn but imminent princes of the blood could be _ born _ into the regiment , and start fair , with good wages and a permanent situation , upon due notice from the parents . All the boys would join , I was sure of that ; so , all existing grants would be relinquished ; that the newly born would always join was equally certain . Within sixty days that quaint and bizarre anomaly , the Royal Grant , would cease to be a living fact , and take its place among the curiosities of the past . CHAPTER XXVI THE FIRST NEWSPAPER When I told the king I was going out disguised as a petty freeman to scour the country and familiarize myself with the humbler life of the people , he was all afire with the novelty of the thing in a minute , and was bound to take a chance in the adventure himself -- nothing should stop him -- he would drop everything and go along -- it was the prettiest idea he had run across for many a day . He wanted to glide out the back way and start at once ; but I showed him that that would n't answer . You see , he was billed for the king's - evil -- to touch for it , I mean -- and it would n't be right to disappoint the house and it would n't make a delay worth considering , anyway , it was only a one - night stand . And I thought he ought to tell the queen he was going away . He clouded up at that and looked sad . I was sorry I had spoken , especially when he said mournfully : “
78638	78711	78712	78713	Sir Boss	2609	” Of course , I changed the Subject . Yes , Guenever was beautiful , it is true , but take her all around she was pretty slack . I never meddled in these matters , they were n't my affair , but I did hate to see the way things were going on , and I do n't mind saying that much . Many 's the time she had asked me , “
78721	79885	78712	78713	Sir Boss	2609	” but if ever she went fretting around for the king I did n't happen to be around at the time . There was a very good lay - out for the king's - evil business -- very tidy and creditable . The king sat under a canopy of state ; about him were clustered a large body of the clergy in full canonicals . Conspicuous , both for location and personal outfit , stood Marinel , a hermit of the quack - doctor species , to introduce the sick . All abroad over the spacious floor , and clear down to the doors , in a thick jumble , lay or sat the scrofulous , under a strong light . It was as good as a tableau ; in fact , it had all the look of being gotten up for that , though it was n't . There were eight hundred sick people present . The work was slow ; it lacked the interest of novelty for me , because I had seen the ceremonies before ; the thing soon became tedious , but the proprieties required me to stick it out . The doctor was there for the reason that in all such crowds there were many people who only imagined something was the matter with them , and many who were consciously sound but wanted the immortal honor of fleshly contact with a king , and yet others who pretended to illness in order to get the piece of coin that went with the touch . Up to this time this coin had been a wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar . When you consider how much that amount of money would buy , in that age and country , and how usual it was to be scrofulous , when not dead , you would understand that the annual king's - evil appropriation was just the River and Harbor bill of that government for the grip it took on the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning the surplus . So I had privately concluded to touch the treasury itself for the king's - evil . I covered six - sevenths of the appropriation into the treasury a week before starting from Camelot on my adventures , and ordered that the other seventh be inflated into five - cent nickels and delivered into the hands of the head clerk of the King 's Evil Department ; a nickel to take the place of each gold coin , you see , and do its work for it . It might strain the nickel some , but I judged it could stand it . As a rule , I do not approve of watering stock , but I considered it square enough in this case , for it was just a gift , anyway . Of course , you can water a gift as much as you want to ; and I generally do . The old gold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown origin , as a rule , but some of them were Roman ; they were ill - shapen , and seldom rounder than a moon that is a week past the full ; they were hammered , not minted , and they were so worn with use that the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters , and looked like them . I judged that a sharp , bright new nickel , with a first - rate likeness of the king on one side of it and Guenever on the other , and a blooming pious motto , would take the tuck out of scrofula as handy as a nobler coin and please the scrofulous fancy more ; and I was right . This batch was the first it was tried on , and it worked to a charm . The saving in expense was a notable economy . You will see that by these figures : We touched a trifle over 700 of the 800 patients ; at former rates , this would have cost the government about $ 240 ; at the new rate we pulled through for about $ 35 , thus saving upward of $ 200 at one swoop . To appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke , consider these other figures : the annual expenses of a national government amount to the equivalent of a contribution of three days ' average wages of every individual of the population , counting every individual as if he were a man . If you take a nation of 60,000,000 , where average wages are $ 2 per day , three days ' wages taken from each individual will provide $ 360,000,000 and pay the government 's expenses . In my day , in my own country , this money was collected from imposts , and the citizen imagined that the foreign importer paid it , and it made him comfortable to think so ; whereas , in fact , it was paid by the American people , and was so equally and exactly distributed among them that the annual cost to the 100 - millionaire and the annual cost to the sucking child of the day - laborer was precisely the same -- each paid $ 6 . Nothing could be equaler than that , I reckon . Well , Scotland and Ireland were tributary to Arthur , and the united populations of the British Islands amounted to something less than 1,000,000 . A mechanic 's average wage was 3 cents a day , when he paid his own keep . By this rule the national government 's expenses were $ 90,000 a year , or about $ 250 a day . Thus , by the substitution of nickels for gold on a king's - evil day , I not only injured no one , dissatisfied no one , but pleased all concerned and saved four - fifths of that day 's national expense into the bargain -- a saving which would have been the equivalent of $ 800,000 in my day in America . In making this substitution I had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote source -- the wisdom of my boyhood -- for the true statesman does not despise any wisdom , howsoever lowly may be its origin : in my boyhood I had always saved my pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionary cause . The buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well as the coin , the coin would answer me better than the buttons ; all hands were happy and nobody hurt . Marinel took the patients as they came . He examined the candidate ; if he could n't qualify he was warned off ; if he could he was passed along to the king . A priest pronounced the words , “
79900	80362	80363	80363	they	2612	” Then the king stroked the ulcers , while the reading continued ; finally , the patient graduated and got his nickel -- the king hanging it around his neck himself -- and was dismissed . Would you think that that would cure ? It certainly did . Any mummery will cure if the patient 's faith is strong in it . Up by Astolat there was a chapel where the Virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herd geese around there -- the girl said so herself -- and they built the chapel upon that spot and hung a picture in it representing the occurrence -- a picture which you would think it dangerous for a sick person to approach ; whereas , on the contrary , thousands of the lame and the sick came and prayed before it every year and went away whole and sound ; and even the well could look upon it and live . Of course , when I was told these things I did not believe them ; but when I went there and saw them I had to succumb . I saw the cures effected myself ; and they were real cures and not questionable . I saw cripples whom I had seen around Camelot for years on crutches , arrive and pray before that picture , and put down their crutches and walk off without a limp . There were piles of crutches there which had been left by such people as a testimony . In other places people operated on a patient 's mind , without saying a word to him , and cured him . In others , experts assembled patients in a room and prayed over them , and appealed to their faith , and those patients went away cured . Wherever you find a king who ca n't cure the king's - evil you can be sure that the most valuable superstition that supports his throne -- the subject 's belief in the divine appointment of his sovereign -- has passed away . In my youth the monarchs of England had ceased to touch for the evil , but there was no occasion for this diffidence : they could have cured it forty - nine times in fifty . Well , when the priest had been droning for three hours , and the good king polishing the evidences , and the sick were still pressing forward as plenty as ever , I got to feeling intolerably bored . I was sitting by an open window not far from the canopy of state . For the five hundredth time a patient stood forward to have his repulsivenesses stroked ; again those words were being droned out : “
80370	80393	78712	78713	Sir Boss	2609	sick”--when outside there rang clear as a clarion a note that enchanted my soul and tumbled thirteen worthless centuries about my ears : “
80417	81204	78712	78713	Sir Boss	2609	” One greater than kings had arrived -- the newsboy . But I was the only person in all that throng who knew the meaning of this mighty birth , and what this imperial magician was come into the world to do . I dropped a nickel out of the window and got my paper ; the Adam - newsboy of the world went around the corner to get my change ; is around the corner yet . It was delicious to see a newspaper again , yet I was conscious of a secret shock when my eye fell upon the first batch of display head - lines . I had lived in a clammy atmosphere of reverence , respect , deference , so long that they sent a quivery little cold wave through me : HIGH TIMES IN THE VALLEY OF HOLINESS ! ---- THE WATER - WORKS CORKED ! ---- BRER MERLIN WORKS HIS ARTS , BUT GETS LEFT ? ---- But the Boss scores on his first Innings ! ---- The Miraculous Well Uncorked amid awful outbursts of INFERNAL FIRE AND SMOKE ATHUNDER ! ---- THE BUZZARD - ROOST ASTONISHED ! ---- UNPARALLELED REJOIBINGS ! --and so on , and so on . Yes , it was too loud . Once I could have enjoyed it and seen nothing out of the way about it , but now its note was discordant . It was good Arkansas journalism , but this was not Arkansas . Moreover , the next to the last line was calculated to give offense to the hermits , and perhaps lose us their advertising . Indeed , there was too lightsome a tone of flippancy all through the paper . It was plain I had undergone a considerable change without noticing it . I found myself unpleasantly affected by pert little irreverencies which would have seemed but proper and airy graces of speech at an earlier period of my life . There was an abundance of the following breed of items , and they discomforted me : LOCAL SMOKE AND CINDERS . Sir Launcelot met up with old King Agrivance of Ireland unexpectedly last weok over on the moor south of Sir Balmoral le Merveilleuse 's hog dasture . The widow has been notified . Expedition No . 3 will start adout the first of mext month on a search f8r Sir Sagramour le Desirous . It is in com- and of the renowned Knight of the Red Lawns , assissted by Sir Persant of Inde , who is compete9 t. intelligent , courte- ous , and in every way a brick , and fur- tHer assisted by Sir Palamides the Sara- cen , who is no huckleberry hinself . This is no pic - nic , these boys mean busine&amp;s . The readers of the Hosannah will re- gret to learn that the hadndsome and popular Sir Charolais of Gaul , who dur- ing his four weeks ' stay at the Bull and Halibut , this city , has won every heart by his polished manners and elegant cPnversation , will pUll out to - day for home . Give us another call , Charley ! The bdsiness end of the funeral of the late Sir Dalliance the duke 's son of Cornwall , killed in an encounter with the Giant of the Knotted Bludgeon last Tuesday on the borders of the Plain of Enchantment was in the hands of the ever affable and efficient Mumble , prince of un3ertakers , then whom there exists none by whom it were a more satisfying pleasure to have the last sad offices performed . Give him a trial . The cordial thanks of the Hosannah office are due , from editor down to devil , to the ever courteous and thought- ful Lord High Stew d of the Palace 's Third Assistant V t for several sau- ceTs of ice crEam a quality calculated to make the ey of the recipients hu- mid with grt ude ; and it done it . When this administration wants to chalk up a desirable name for early promotion , the Hosannah would like a chance to sudgest . The Demoiselle Irene Dewlap , of South Astolat , is visiting her uncle , the popular host of the Cattlemen 's Board- ing Ho&amp;se , Liver Lane , this city . Young Barker the bellows - mender is hoMe again , and looks much improved by his vacation round - up among the out- lying smithies . See his ad . Of course it was good enough journalism for a beginning ; I knew that quite well , and yet it was somehow disappointing . The “
81207	81431	78712	78713	Sir Boss	2609	” pleased me better ; indeed , its simple and dignified respectfulness was a distinct refreshment to me after all those disgraceful familiarities . But even it could have been improved . Do what one may , there is no getting an air of variety into a court circular , I acknowledge that . There is a profound monotonousness about its facts that baffles and defeats one 's sincerest efforts to make them sparkle and enthuse . The best way to manage -- in fact , the only sensible way -- is to disguise repetitiousness of fact under variety of form : skin your fact each time and lay on a new cuticle of words . It deceives the eye ; you think it is a new fact ; it gives you the idea that the court is carrying on like everything ; this excites you , and you drain the whole column , with a good appetite , and perhaps never notice that it 's a barrel of soup made out of a single bean . Clarence 's way was good , it was simple , it was dignified , it was direct and business - like ; all I say is , it was not the best way : COURT CIRCULAR . On Monday , the king rode in the park . “

Little crudities of a mechanical sort were observable here and there , but there were not enough of them to amount to anything , and it was good enough Arkansas proof - reading , anyhow , and better than was needed in Arthur 's day and realm . As a rule , the grammar was leaky and the construction more or less lame ; but I did not much mind these things . They are common defects of my own , and one must n't criticise other people on grounds where he ca n't stand perpendicular himself . I was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole paper at this one meal , but I got only a few bites , and then had to postpone , because the monks around me besieged me so with eager questions : What is this curious thing ? What is it for ? Is it a handkerchief?--saddle blanket?--part of a shirt ? What is it made of ? How thin it is , and how dainty and frail ; and how it rattles . Will it wear , do you think , and wo n't the rain injure it ? Is it writing that appears on it , or is it only ornamentation ? They suspected it was writing , because those among them who knew how to read Latin and had a smattering of Greek , recognized some of the letters , but they could make nothing out of the result as a whole . I put my information in the simplest form I could : “
81838	81851	81805	81805	I	0	” Then they all broke out with exclamations of surprise and admiration : “

81884	81898	81805	81805	I	0	” They crossed themselves , and whiffed out a protective prayer or two . “
81914	81968	81805	81805	I	0	” I let it go at that . Then I read in a low voice , to as many as could crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance , part of the account of the miracle of the restoration of the well , and was accompanied by astonished and reverent ejaculations all through : “
81975	81976	81805	81805	I	0	” “
81980	81981	81805	81805	I	0	” “
81986	81987	81805	81805	I	0	” “
82001	82971	81988	81988	These	2617	” And might they take this strange thing in their hands , and feel of it and examine it?--they would be very careful . Yes . So they took it , handling it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had been some holy thing come from some supernatural region ; and gently felt of its texture , caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering touch , and scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes . These grouped bent heads , these charmed faces , these speaking eyes --how beautiful to me ! For was not this my darling , and was not all this mute wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent tribute and unforced compliment to it ? I knew , then , how a mother feels when women , whether strangers or friends , take her new baby , and close themselves about it with one eager impulse , and bend their heads over it in a tranced adoration that makes all the rest of the universe vanish out of their consciousness and be as if it were not , for that time . I knew how she feels , and that there is no other satisfied ambition , whether of king , conqueror , or poet , that ever reaches half - way to that serene far summit or yields half so divine a contentment . During all the rest of the seance my paper traveled from group to group all up and down and about that huge hall , and my happy eye was upon it always , and I sat motionless , steeped in satisfaction , drunk with enjoyment . Yes , this was heaven ; I was tasting it once , if I might never taste it more . CHAPTER XXVII THE YANKEE AND THE KING TRAVEL INCOGNITO About bedtime I took the king to my private quarters to cut his hair and help him get the hang of the lowly raiment he was to wear . The high classes wore their hair banged across the forehead but hanging to the shoulders the rest of the way around , whereas the lowest ranks of commoners were banged fore and aft both ; the slaves were bangless , and allowed their hair free growth . So I inverted a bowl over his head and cut away all the locks that hung below it . I also trimmed his whiskers and mustache until they were only about a half - inch long ; and tried to do it inartistically , and succeeded . It was a villainous disfigurement . When he got his lubberly sandals on , and his long robe of coarse brown linen cloth , which hung straight from his neck to his ankle - bones , he was no longer the comeliest man in his kingdom , but one of the unhandsomest and most commonplace and unattractive . We were dressed and barbered alike , and could pass for small farmers , or farm bailiffs , or shepherds , or carters ; yes , or for village artisans , if we chose , our costume being in effect universal among the poor , because of its strength and cheapness . I do n't mean that it was really cheap to a very poor person , but I do mean that it was the cheapest material there was for male attire -- manufactured material , you understand . We slipped away an hour before dawn , and by broad sun - up had made eight or ten miles , and were in the midst of a sparsely settled country . I had a pretty heavy knapsack ; it was laden with provisions -- provisions for the king to taper down on , till he could take to the coarse fare of the country without damage . I found a comfortable seat for the king by the roadside , and then gave him a morsel or two to stay his stomach with . Then I said I would find some water for him , and strolled away . Part of my project was to get out of sight and sit down and rest a little myself . It had always been my custom to stand when in his presence ; even at the council board , except upon those rare occasions when the sitting was a very long one , extending over hours ; then I had a trifling little backless thing which was like a reversed culvert and was as comfortable as the toothache . I did n't want to break him in suddenly , but do it by degrees . We should have to sit together now when in company , or people would notice ; but it would not be good politics for me to be playing equality with him when there was no necessity for it . I found the water some three hundred yards away , and had been resting about twenty minutes , when I heard voices . That is all right , I thought -- peasants going to work ; nobody else likely to be stirring this early . But the next moment these comers jingled into sight around a turn of the road -- smartly clad people of quality , with luggage - mules and servants in their train ! I was off like a shot , through the bushes , by the shortest cut . For a while it did seem that these people would pass the king before I could get to him ; but desperation gives you wings , you know , and I canted my body forward , inflated my breast , and held my breath and flew . I arrived . And in plenty good enough time , too . “

83008	83009	83005	83005	them	2620	” “
83038	83039	83032	83033	a peasant	2623	” “
83058	83084	83106	83107	the king	4445	Gaul”--he was up by this time , but a farm could have got up quicker , if there was any kind of a boom in real estate--“and
83098	83099	83106	83107	the king	4445	” “
83120	83253	83106	83107	the king	4445	” He did his honest best , but lord , it was no great things . He looked as humble as the leaning tower at Pisa . It is the most you could say of it . Indeed , it was such a thundering poor success that it raised wondering scowls all along the line , and a gorgeous flunkey at the tail end of it raised his whip ; but I jumped in time and was under it when it fell ; and under cover of the volley of coarse laughter which followed , I spoke up sharply and warned the king to take no notice . He mastered himself for the moment , but it was a sore tax ; he wanted to eat up the procession . I said : “
83301	83302	83298	83299	the peasant	2628	” “
83334	83585	83320	83320	I	0	” He kept his word . He did the best he could , but I 've seen better . If you have ever seen an active , heedless , enterprising child going diligently out of one mischief and into another all day long , and an anxious mother at its heels all the while , and just saving it by a hair from drowning itself or breaking its neck with each new experiment , you 've seen the king and me . If I could have foreseen what the thing was going to be like , I should have said , No , if anybody wants to make his living exhibiting a king as a peasant , let him take the layout ; I can do better with a menagerie , and last longer . And yet , during the first three days I never allowed him to enter a hut or other dwelling . If he could pass muster anywhere during his early novitiate it would be in small inns and on the road ; so to these places we confined ourselves . Yes , he certainly did the best he could , but what of that ? He did n't improve a bit that I could see . He was always frightening me , always breaking out with fresh astonishers , in new and unexpected places . Toward evening on the second day , what does he do but blandly fetch out a dirk from inside his robe ! “
83598	83599	83594	83594	you	2621	” “
83610	83611	83594	83594	you	2621	” “
83622	83623	83624	83624	We	2636	” “
83661	83662	83653	83653	Thine	2638	” “
83703	83761	83691	83691	he	2041	” It was a lucky thing for us that nobody came along just then . I persuaded him to throw the dirk away ; and it was as easy as persuading a child to give up some bright fresh new way of killing itself . We walked along , silent and thinking . Finally the king said : “
83792	83834	83782	83782	you	2637	” It was a startling question , and a puzzler . I did n't quite know how to take hold of it , or what to say , and so , of course , I ended by saying the natural thing : “
83848	83862	83841	83841	I	0	” The king stopped dead in his tracks , and stared at me . “
83890	83918	83919	83919	Sire	2588	” I saw I had made a blunder . I must get back my lost ground . After a deep reflection and careful planning , I said : “
83978	83979	83975	83975	you	2588	” “
83988	83989	83975	83975	you	2588	” “

84184	84252	84152	84152	My	0	” My land , you should have seen the king 's eyes spread slowly open , and lift the earth 's entire atmosphere as much as an inch ! That settled Brer Merlin . One never had any occasion to prove his facts , with these people ; all he had to do was to state them . It never occurred to anybody to doubt the statement . “
84257	84261	84152	84152	My	0	” I continued , “
84390	84391	84371	84371	my	0	” “
84401	84402	84371	84371	my	0	” “
84444	84445	84474	84474	he	2657	” “
84454	84455	84474	84474	he	2657	” “
84486	84487	84474	84474	he	2657	” “
84557	85885	85886	85886	Sire	2588	” It was a wise head . A peasant 's cap was no safe disguise for it ; you could know it for a king 's under a diving - bell , if you could hear it work its intellect . I had a new trade now , and plenty of business in it . The king was as hungry to find out everything that was going to happen during the next thirteen centuries as if he were expecting to live in them . From that time out , I prophesied myself bald - headed trying to supply the demand . I have done some indiscreet things in my day , but this thing of playing myself for a prophet was the worst . Still , it had its ameliorations . A prophet does n't have to have any brains . They are good to have , of course , for the ordinary exigencies of life , but they are no use in professional work . It is the restfulest vocation there is . When the spirit of prophecy comes upon you , you merely take your intellect and lay it off in a cool place for a rest , and unship your jaw and leave it alone ; it will work itself : the result is prophecy . Every day a knight - errant or so came along , and the sight of them fired the king 's martial spirit every time . He would have forgotten himself , sure , and said something to them in a style a suspicious shade or so above his ostensible degree , and so I always got him well out of the road in time . Then he would stand and look with all his eyes ; and a proud light would flash from them , and his nostrils would inflate like a war - horse 's , and I knew he was longing for a brush with them . But about noon of the third day I had stopped in the road to take a precaution which had been suggested by the whip - stroke that had fallen to my share two days before ; a precaution which I had afterward decided to leave untaken , I was so loath to institute it ; but now I had just had a fresh reminder : while striding heedlessly along , with jaw spread and intellect at rest , for I was prophesying , I stubbed my toe and fell sprawling . I was so pale I could n't think for a moment ; then I got softly and carefully up and unstrapped my knapsack . I had that dynamite bomb in it , done up in wool in a box . It was a good thing to have along ; the time would come when I could do a valuable miracle with it , maybe , but it was a nervous thing to have about me , and I did n't like to ask the king to carry it . Yet I must either throw it away or think up some safe way to get along with its society . I got it out and slipped it into my scrip , and just then here came a couple of knights . The king stood , stately as a statue , gazing toward them -- had forgotten himself again , of course -- and before I could get a word of warning out , it was time for him to skip , and well that he did it , too . He supposed they would turn aside . Turn aside to avoid trampling peasant dirt under foot ? When had he ever turned aside himself -- or ever had the chance to do it , if a peasant saw him or any other noble knight in time to judiciously save him the trouble ? The knights paid no attention to the king at all ; it was his place to look out himself , and if he had n't skipped he would have been placidly ridden down , and laughed at besides . The king was in a flaming fury , and launched out his challenge and epithets with a most royal vigor . The knights were some little distance by now . They halted , greatly surprised , and turned in their saddles and looked back , as if wondering if it might be worth while to bother with such scum as we . Then they wheeled and started for us . Not a moment must be lost . I started for _ them _ . I passed them at a rattling gait , and as I went by I flung out a hair - lifting soul - scorching thirteen - jointed insult which made the king 's effort poor and cheap by comparison . I got it out of the nineteenth century where they know how . They had such headway that they were nearly to the king before they could check up ; then , frantic with rage , they stood up their horses on their hind hoofs and whirled them around , and the next moment here they came , breast to breast . I was seventy yards off , then , and scrambling up a great bowlder at the roadside . When they were within thirty yards of me they let their long lances droop to a level , depressed their mailed heads , and so , with their horse - hair plumes streaming straight out behind , most gallant to see , this lightning express came tearing for me ! When they were within fifteen yards , I sent that bomb with a sure aim , and it struck the ground just under the horses ' noses . Yes , it was a neat thing , very neat and pretty to see . It resembled a steamboat explosion on the Mississippi ; and during the next fifteen minutes we stood under a steady drizzle of microscopic fragments of knights and hardware and horse - flesh . I say we , for the king joined the audience , of course , as soon as he had got his breath again . There was a hole there which would afford steady work for all the people in that region for some years to come --in trying to explain it , I mean ; as for filling it up , that service would be comparatively prompt , and would fall to the lot of a select few -- peasants of that seignory ; and they would n't get anything for it , either . But I explained it to the king myself . I said it was done with a dynamite bomb . This information did him no damage , because it left him as intelligent as he was before . However , it was a noble miracle , in his eyes , and was another settler for Merlin . I thought it well enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sort that it could n't be done except when the atmospheric conditions were just right . Otherwise he would be encoring it every time we had a good subject , and that would be inconvenient , because I had n't any more bombs along . CHAPTER XXVIII DRILLING THE KING On the morning of the fourth day , when it was just sunrise , and we had been tramping an hour in the chill dawn , I came to a resolution : the king _ must _ be drilled ; things could not go on so , he must be taken in hand and deliberately and conscientiously drilled , or we could n't ever venture to enter a dwelling ; the very cats would know this masquerader for a humbug and no peasant . So I called a halt and said : “
86107	86120	86074	86076	the very infants	2665	” The king took careful note , and then tried an imitation . “
86391	86392	86398	86398	one	434	” “
86404	86405	86398	86398	one	434	” “
86505	86519	86522	86522	sire	2588	” After the drill had gone on a little while , I said : “
86554	86571	86572	86572	Varlet	278	” The king unconsciously straightened up like a monument , and said , with frozen austerity : “
86587	86588	86572	86572	Varlet	278	” “
86600	86601	86572	86572	Varlet	278	” “
86607	86608	86572	86572	Varlet	278	” “
86620	86621	86609	86610	These people	551	” “
86628	86629	86609	86610	These people	551	” “
86640	86641	86609	86610	These people	551	” “
86654	86655	86648	86648	I	0	” “
86667	86668	86648	86648	I	0	” “
86681	86682	86679	86679	goodman	2684	” “
86704	86705	86697	86697	you	0	” “
86711	86712	86706	86707	Brother!--to dirt	2688	” “
86729	86730	86706	86707	Brother!--to dirt	2688	” “
86761	86762	86770	86770	You	245	” “
86795	86844	86847	86847	you	245	” The king looked puzzled -- he was n't a very heavy weight , intellectually . His head was an hour - glass ; it could stow an idea , but it had to do it a grain at a time , not the whole idea at once . “
86857	86858	86847	86847	you	245	” “
86887	86888	86865	86866	the man	536	” “
86944	86945	86912	86912	he	536	” “
87067	87068	87062	87062	they	2699	” “
87152	87213	87140	87140	I	0	” He was complete now with that knapsack on , and looked as little like a king as any man I had ever seen . But it was an obstinate pair of shoulders ; they could not seem to learn the trick of stooping with any sort of deceptive naturalness . The drill went on , I prompting and correcting : “
87265	87361	87362	87364	the working classes	2705	” And so on , and so on . I drilled him as representing in turn all sorts of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and misfortunes . But lord , it was only just words , words -- they meant nothing in the world to him , I might just as well have whistled . Words realize nothing , vivify nothing to you , unless you have suffered in your own person the thing which the words try to describe . There are wise people who talk ever so knowingly and complacently about “
87366	87487	87362	87364	the working classes	2705	” and satisfy themselves that a day 's hard intellectual work is very much harder than a day 's hard manual toil , and is righteously entitled to much bigger pay . Why , they really think that , you know , because they know all about the one , but have n't tried the other . But I know all about both ; and so far as I am concerned , there is n't money enough in the universe to hire me to swing a pickaxe thirty days , but I will do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as near nothing as you can cipher it down -- and I will be satisfied , too . Intellectual “
87489	87884	87362	87364	the working classes	2705	” is misnamed ; it is a pleasure , a dissipation , and is its own highest reward . The poorest paid architect , engineer , general , author , sculptor , painter , lecturer , advocate , legislator , actor , preacher , singer is constructively in heaven when he is at work ; and as for the musician with the fiddle - bow in his hand who sits in the midst of a great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing tides of divine sound washing over him -- why , certainly , he is at work , if you wish to call it that , but lord , it 's a sarcasm just the same . The law of work does seem utterly unfair -- but there it is , and nothing can change it : the higher the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it , the higher shall be his pay in cash , also . And it 's also the very law of those transparent swindles , transmissible nobility and kingship . CHAPTER XXIX THE SMALLPOX HUT When we arrived at that hut at mid - afternoon , we saw no signs of life about it . The field near by had been denuded of its crop some time before , and had a skinned look , so exhaustively had it been harvested and gleaned . Fences , sheds , everything had a ruined look , and were eloquent of poverty . No animal was around anywhere , no living thing in sight . The stillness was awful , it was like the stillness of death . The cabin was a one - story one , whose thatch was black with age , and ragged from lack of repair . The door stood a trifle ajar . We approached it stealthily -- on tiptoe and at half - breath -- for that is the way one 's feeling makes him do , at such a time . The king knocked . We waited . No answer . Knocked again . No answer . I pushed the door softly open and looked in . I made out some dim forms , and a woman started up from the ground and stared at me , as one does who is wakened from sleep . Presently she found her voice : “
87888	87892	87362	87364	the working classes	2705	” she pleaded . “
87901	87902	87362	87364	the working classes	2705	” “
87914	87915	87903	87903	I	0	” “
87922	87923	87916	87916	You	0	” “
87926	87927	87916	87916	You	0	” “
87938	87939	87932	87936	the lord of the manor	5013	” “
87947	87948	87944	87945	a stranger	798	” “
87989	87990	87992	87992	me	0	” “
88006	88035	88036	88036	I	0	” I was better used to the dim light now . I could see her hollow eyes fixed upon me . I could see how emaciated she was . “
88064	88065	88067	88067	yourself	2706	” “
88089	88090	88085	88085	me	0	” “
88176	88291	88300	88300	sire	2588	” But before this I had picked up a wooden bowl and was rushing past the king on my way to the brook . It was ten yards away . When I got back and entered , the king was within , and was opening the shutter that closed the window - hole , to let in air and light . The place was full of a foul stench . I put the bowl to the woman 's lips , and as she gripped it with her eager talons the shutter came open and a strong light flooded her face . Smallpox ! I sprang to the king , and said in his ear : “
88319	88325	88302	88303	the woman	1872	” He did not budge . “
88337	88342	88343	88343	King	1026	” I whispered again : “
88354	88355	88356	88356	Ye	1026	” “
88443	88516	88425	88425	she	1872	” It was a desperate place for him to be in , and might cost him his life , but it was no use to argue with him . If he considered his knightly honor at stake here , that was the end of argument ; he would stay , and nothing could prevent it ; I was aware of that . And so I dropped the subject . The woman spoke : “
88562	88563	88425	88425	she	1872	” “
88566	88571	88425	88425	she	1872	” said the king , “
88583	88630	88579	88579	I	0	” And he put down the knapsack . I turned to start , but the king had already started . He halted , and looked down upon a man who lay in a dim light , and had not noticed us thus far , or spoken . “
88636	88641	88633	88634	your husband	2728	” the king asked . “
88644	88645	88633	88634	your husband	2728	” “
88650	88651	88647	88647	he	2728	” “
88691	88695	88687	88687	he	2728	” I said : “
88707	88708	88701	88701	We	2729	” “
88723	88724	88719	88719	he	2728	” “
88727	88728	88719	88719	he	2728	” “
88960	89281	88951	88951	his	2728	” There was a slight noise from the direction of the dim corner where the ladder was . It was the king descending . I could see that he was bearing something in one arm , and assisting himself with the other . He came forward into the light ; upon his breast lay a slender girl of fifteen . She was but half conscious ; she was dying of smallpox . Here was heroism at its last and loftiest possibility , its utmost summit ; this was challenging death in the open field unarmed , with all the odds against the challenger , no reward set upon the contest , and no admiring world in silks and cloth of gold to gaze and applaud ; and yet the king 's bearing was as serenely brave as it had always been in those cheaper contests where knight meets knight in equal fight and clothed in protecting steel . He was great now ; sublimely great . The rude statues of his ancestors in his palace should have an addition -- I would see to that ; and it would not be a mailed king killing a giant or a dragon , like the rest , it would be a king in commoner 's garb bearing death in his arms that a peasant mother might look her last upon her child and be comforted . He laid the girl down by her mother , who poured out endearments and caresses from an overflowing heart , and one could detect a flickering faint light of response in the child 's eyes , but that was all . The mother hung over her , kissing her , petting her , and imploring her to speak , but the lips only moved and no sound came . I snatched my liquor flask from my knapsack , but the woman forbade me , and said : “
89411	89412	89413	89413	She	2744	” “
89418	89428	89413	89413	She	2744	” interrupted the king , in a subdued voice . “
89470	89541	89445	89446	my Annis	2753	” And so she fell to murmuring and cooing over the girl again , and softly stroking her face and hair , and kissing her and calling her by endearing names ; but there was scarcely sign of response now in the glazing eyes . I saw tears well from the king 's eyes , and trickle down his face . The woman noticed them , too , and said : “
89607	89727	89728	89728	Ye	2763	” The king winced under this accidental home - shot , but kept still ; he was learning his part ; and he was playing it well , too , for a pretty dull beginner . I struck up a diversion . I offered the woman food and liquor , but she refused both . She would allow nothing to come between her and the release of death . Then I slipped away and brought the dead child from aloft , and laid it by her . This broke her down again , and there was another scene that was full of heartbreak . By and by I made another diversion , and beguiled her to sketch her story . “

Then I roused me and got up , as wife and mother will . It was little they could have eaten in any case ; it was less than little they had to eat . But there was water , and I gave them that . How they craved it ! and how they blessed it ! But the end came yesterday ; my strength broke down . Yesterday was the last time I ever saw my husband and this youngest child alive . I have lain here all these hours -- these ages , ye may say -- listening , listening for any sound up there that-- ”
90470	90476	90455	90455	She	2795	“ Oh , my darling ! ”

91144	91172	91080	91080	He	4445	“ That is my trouble ; I have a fear that this is so , and your suspicion doth confirm it , you having the same fear . ”
91173	91203	91095	91095	his	4445	“ I should not call it by that name though . I do suspect that they escaped , but if they did , I am not sorry , certainly . ”

91230	91284	91080	91080	He	4445	“ _ If _ they did escape , then are we bound in duty to lay hands upon them and deliver them again to their lord ; for it is not seemly that one of his quality should suffer a so insolent and high - handed outrage from persons of their base degree . ”

And I will say my say now , and ye may report it if ye be so minded . I helped to hang my neighbors for that it were peril to my own life to show lack of zeal in the master 's cause ; the others helped for none other reason . All rejoice to - day that he is dead , but all do go about seemingly sorrowing , and shedding the hypocrite 's tear , for in that lies safety .

You 've opened your house to Jones and me in the most generous way ; Jones was remarking upon it to - day , just before you came back from the village ; for although he would n't be likely to say such a thing to you -- because Jones is n't a talker , and is diffident in society -- he has a good heart and a grateful , and knows how to appreciate it when he is well treated ; yes , you and your wife have been very hospitable toward us-- ”

And so we 'll shop around and get up this layout now , and do n't you worry about the expense . I 'm one of the worst spendthrifts that ever was born . Why , do you know , sometimes in a single week I spend --but never mind about that -- you'd never believe it anyway . ”

He was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way , but he is so diffident he could n't venture it himself , and so he begged me to buy some little things and give them to you and Dame Phyllis and let him pay for them without your ever knowing they came from him -- you know how a delicate person feels about that sort of thing --and so I said I would , and we would keep mum . Well , his idea was , a new outfit of clothes for you both-- ”

You ought to cure that , Marco ; it is n't good form , you know , and it will grow on you if you do n't check it . Yes , we 'll step in here now and price this man 's stuff -- and do n't forget to remember to not let on to Jones that you know he had anything to do with it . You ca n't think how curiously sensitive and proud he is . He 's a farmer -- pretty fairly well - to - do farmer --and I 'm his bailiff ; _ but_--the imagination of that man ! Why , sometimes when he forgets himself and gets to blowing off , you 'd think he was one of the swells of the earth ; and you might listen to him a hundred years and never take him for a farmer -- especially if he talked agriculture . He _ thinks _ he 's a Sheol of a farmer ; thinks he 's old Grayback from Wayback ; but between you and me privately he do n't know as much about farming as he does about running a kingdom -- still , whatever he talks about , you want to drop your underjaw and listen , the same as if you had never heard such incredible wisdom in all your life before , and were afraid you might die before you got enough of it . That will please Jones . ”

102043	102101	102038	102038	he	3193	“ Marry , I seem not to understand . It is _ proved _ that our wages be double thine ; how then may it be that thou'st knocked therefrom the stuffing?--an miscall not the wonderly word , this being the first time under grace and providence of God it hath been granted me to hear it . ”
102165	102197	102161	102161	I	0	“ Why , look here , brother Dowley , do n't you see ? Your wages are merely higher than ours in _ name _ , not in _ fact _ . ”

102213	102318	102161	102161	I	0	“ Yes - yes , I do n't deny that at all . But that 's got nothing to do with it ; the _ amount _ of the wages in mere coins , with meaningless names attached to them to know them by , has got nothing to do with it . The thing is , how much can you _ buy _ with your wages ? --that 's the idea . While it is true that with you a good mechanic is allowed about three dollars and a half a year , and with us only about a dollar and seventy - five-- ”
102319	102332	102161	102161	I	0	“ There -- ye're confessing it again , ye're confessing it again ! ”
102333	102396	102397	102397	He	3197	“ Confound it , I 've never denied it , I tell you ! What I say is this . With us _ half _ a dollar buys more than a _ dollar _ buys with you -- and THEREFORE it stands to reason and the commonest kind of common - sense , that our wages are _ higher _ than yours . ”
102406	102434	102397	102397	He	3197	“ Verily , I can not make it out . Ye've just said ours are the higher , and with the same breath ye take it back . ”
102435	102501	102161	102161	I	0	“ Oh , great Scott , is n't it possible to get such a simple thing through your head ? Now look here -- let me illustrate . We pay four cents for a woman 's stuff gown , you pay 8.4.0 , which is four mills more than _ double _ . What do you allow a laboring woman who works on a farm ? ”
102502	102508	102397	102397	He	3197	“ Two mills a day . ”
102509	102533	102397	102397	He	3197	“ Very good ; we allow but half as much ; we pay her only a tenth of a cent a day ; and-- ”

102539	102639	102640	102640	He	3198	“ Wait ! Now , you see , the thing is very simple ; this time you 'll understand it . For instance , it takes your woman 42 days to earn her gown , at 2 mills a day--7 weeks ' work ; but ours earns hers in forty days -- two days _ short _ of 7 weeks . Your woman has a gown , and her whole seven weeks wages are gone ; ours has a gown , and two days ' wages left , to buy something else with . There--_now _ you understand it ! ”
102705	102726	102696	102696	He	283	“ But -- but -- ye can not fail to grant that two mills a day is better than one . ”
102747	102767	102742	102742	I	0	“ Let us suppose a case . Suppose one of your journeymen goes out and buys the following articles : “
102804	102965	102968	102969	a crusher	3200	“ The lot will cost him 32 cents . It takes him 32 working days to earn the money--5 weeks and 2 days . Let him come to us and work 32 days at _ half _ the wages ; he can buy all those things for a shade under 14 1/2 cents ; they will cost him a shade under 29 days ' work , and he will have about half a week 's wages over . Carry it through the year ; he would save nearly a week 's wages every two months , _ your _ man nothing ; thus saving five or six weeks ' wages in a year , your man not a cent . _ Now _ I reckon you understand that ' high wages ' and ' low wages ' are phrases that do n't mean anything in the world until you find out which of them will _ buy _ the most ! ”

There are written laws -- they perish ; but there are also unwritten laws--_they _ are eternal . Take the unwritten law of wages : it says they 've got to advance , little by little , straight through the centuries . And notice how it works . We know what wages are now , here and there and yonder ; we strike an average , and say that 's the wages of to - day . We know what the wages were a hundred years ago , and what they were two hundred years ago ; that 's as far back as we can get , but it suffices to give us the law of progress , the measure and rate of the periodical augmentation ; and so , without a document to help us , we can come pretty close to determining what the wages were three and four and five hundred years ago . Good , so far . Do we stop there ? No . We stop looking backward ; we face around and apply the law to the future . My friends , I can tell you what people 's wages are going to be at any date in the future you want to know , for hundreds and hundreds of years . ”

Two hundred and fifty years later -- pay attention now -- a mechanic 's wages will be -- mind you , this is law , not guesswork ; a mechanic 's wages will then be _ twenty _ cents a day ! ”

104150	104246	104064	104067	the coal - burner	2971	“ Now , then , that is what is going to happen as regards wages . In that remote day , that man will earn , with _ one _ week 's work , that bill of goods which it takes you upwards of _ fifty _ weeks to earn now . Some other pretty surprising things are going to happen , too . Brother Dowley , who is it that determines , every spring , what the particular wage of each kind of mechanic , laborer , and servant shall be for that year ? ”
104247	104282	104064	104067	the coal - burner	2971	“ Sometimes the courts , sometimes the town council ; but most of all , the magistrate . Ye may say , in general terms , it is the magistrate that fixes the wages . ”
104283	104306	104103	104103	Dowley	283	“ Does n't ask any of those poor devils to _ help _ him fix their wages for them , does he ? ”
104307	104341	104064	104067	the coal - burner	2971	“ Hm ! That _ were _ an idea ! The master that 's to pay him the money is the one that 's rightly concerned in that matter , ye will notice . ”
104342	104572	104064	104067	the coal - burner	2971	“ Yes -- but I thought the other man might have some little trifle at stake in it , too ; and even his wife and children , poor creatures . The masters are these : nobles , rich men , the prosperous generally . These few , who do no work , determine what pay the vast hive shall have who _ do _ work . You see ? They 're a ' combine'--a trade union , to coin a new phrase -- who band themselves together to force their lowly brother to take what they choose to give . Thirteen hundred years hence -- so says the unwritten law -- the ' combine ' will be the other way , and then how these fine people 's posterity will fume and fret and grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade unions ! Yes , indeed ! the magistrate will tranquilly arrange the wages from now clear away down into the nineteenth century ; and then all of a sudden the wage - earner will consider that a couple of thousand years or so is enough of this one - sided sort of thing ; and he will rise up and take a hand in fixing his wages himself . Ah , he will have a long and bitter account of wrong and humiliation to settle . ”
104573	104577	104103	104103	Dowley	283	“ Do ye believe-- ”
104578	104604	104064	104067	the coal - burner	2971	“ That he actually will help to fix his own wages ? Yes , indeed . And he will be strong and able , then . ”

104662	104665	104064	104067	the coal - burner	2971	“ What ? ”
104666	104702	104064	104067	the coal - burner	2971	“ It 's true . Moreover , a magistrate wo n't be able to force a man to work for a master a whole year on a stretch whether the man wants to or not . ”
104703	104717	104064	104067	the coal - burner	2971	“ Will there be _ no _ law or sense in that day ? ”
104718	104772	104064	104067	the coal - burner	2971	“ Both of them , Dowley . In that day a man will be his own property , not the property of magistrate and master . And he can leave town whenever he wants to , if the wages do n't suit him!--and they ca n't put him in the pillory for it . ”
104773	104780	104782	104782	Dowley	283	“ Perdition catch such an age ! ”

104834	104842	104064	104067	the coal - burner	2971	“ A most strange idea . Why ? ”
104843	104865	104782	104782	Dowley	283	“ Well , I 'll tell you why . Is a man ever put in the pillory for a capital crime ? ”
104866	104869	104064	104067	the coal - burner	2971	“ No . ”
104870	104891	104064	104067	the coal - burner	2971	“ Is it right to condemn a man to a slight punishment for a small offense and then kill him ? ”

I think the pillory ought to be abolished . What usually happens when a poor fellow is put in the pillory for some little offense that did n't amount to anything in the world ? The mob try to have some fun with him , do n't they ? ”
105010	105013	104782	104782	Dowley	283	“ Yes . ”
105014	105041	104782	104782	Dowley	283	“ They begin by clodding him ; and they laugh themselves to pieces to see him try to dodge one clod and get hit with another ? ”

105046	105059	104782	104782	Dowley	283	“ Then they throw dead cats at him , do n't they ? ”
105060	105063	104782	104782	Dowley	283	“ Yes . ”
105064	105136	104782	104782	Dowley	283	“ Well , then , suppose he has a few personal enemies in that mob and here and there a man or a woman with a secret grudge against him -- and suppose especially that he is unpopular in the community , for his pride , or his prosperity , or one thing or another -- stones and bricks take the place of clods and cats presently , do n't they ? ”
105137	105145	104917	104918	The company	607	“ There is no doubt of it . ”
105146	105183	104782	104782	Dowley	283	“ As a rule he is crippled for life , is n't he?--jaws broken , teeth smashed out?--or legs mutilated , gangrened , presently cut off ? --or an eye knocked out , maybe both eyes ? ”
105184	105193	104782	104782	Dowley	283	“ It is true , God knoweth it . ”
105194	105218	104917	104918	The company	607	“ And if he is unpopular he can depend on _ dying _ , right there in the stocks , ca n't he ? ”
105219	105230	104782	104782	Dowley	283	“ He surely can ! One may not deny it . ”
105231	105291	104782	104782	Dowley	283	“ I take it none of _ you _ are unpopular -- by reason of pride or insolence , or conspicuous prosperity , or any of those things that excite envy and malice among the base scum of a village ? _ You _ would n't think it much of a risk to take a chance in the stocks ? ”
105368	105448	105319	105319	they	1524	“ Well , to change the subject -- for I think I 've established my point that the stocks ought to be abolished . I think some of our laws are pretty unfair . For instance , if I do a thing which ought to deliver me to the stocks , and you know I did it and yet keep still and do n't report me , _ you _ will get the stocks if anybody informs on you . ”
105449	105460	105462	105462	Dowley	283	“ Ah , but that would serve you but right , ”
105464	105477	105478	105479	The others	1524	“ for you _ must _ inform . So saith the law . ”
105482	105628	105478	105479	The others	1524	“ Well , all right , let it go , since you vote me down . But there 's one thing which certainly is n't fair . The magistrate fixes a mechanic 's wage at one cent a day , for instance . The law says that if any master shall venture , even under utmost press of business , to pay anything _ over _ that cent a day , even for a single day , he shall be both fined and pilloried for it ; and whoever knows he did it and does n't inform , they also shall be fined and pilloried . Now it seems to me unfair , Dowley , and a deadly peril to all of us , that because you thoughtlessly confessed , a while ago , that within a week you have paid a cent and fifteen mil-- ”

127911	127956	127890	127890	she	199	“ The name of one who was dear to thee is here preserved , here made holy , and the music of it will abide alway in our ears . Now thou'lt kiss me , as knowing the name I have given the child . ”
128001	128046	127993	127993	I	0	“ Yes , I know , sweetheart -- how dear and good it is of you , too ! But I want to hear these lips of yours , which are also mine , utter it first -- then its music will be perfect . ”
128055	128060	128052	128052	she	199	“ HELLO - CENTRAL ! ”
128503	128505	128497	128498	the king	4445	“ ship ”
129277	129294	129266	129266	He	131	“ Oh , it 's worth a billion milrays to look upon a live person again ! ”
129320	129334	129335	129335	I	0	“ Quick , now , tell me the meaning of this fearful disaster , ”
129338	129345	129335	129335	I	0	“ How did it come about ? ”
129346	129398	129266	129266	He	131	“ Well , if there had n't been any Queen Guenever , it would n't have come so early ; but it would have come , anyway . It would have come on your own account by and by ; by luck , it happened to come on the queen 's . ”
129399	129407	129295	129295	He	131	“ _ And _ Sir Launcelot 's ? ”
129408	129412	129335	129335	I	0	“ Just so . ”
129413	129419	129335	129335	I	0	“ Give me the details . ”
129420	129454	129295	129295	He	131	“ I reckon you will grant that during some years there has been only one pair of eyes in these kingdoms that has not been looking steadily askance at the queen and Sir Launcelot-- ”
129455	129462	129335	129335	I	0	“ Yes , King Arthur 's . ”
129463	129472	129335	129335	I	0	“ --and only one heart that was without suspicion-- ”
129473	129493	129295	129295	He	131	“ Yes -- the king 's ; a heart that is n't capable of thinking evil of a friend . ”
129494	129587	129295	129295	He	131	“ Well , the king might have gone on , still happy and unsuspecting , to the end of his days , but for one of your modern improvements --the stock - board . When you left , three miles of the London , Canterbury and Dover were ready for the rails , and also ready and ripe for manipulation in the stock - market . It was wildcat , and everybody knew it . The stock was for sale at a give - away . What does Sir Launcelot do , but-- ”
129588	129629	129335	129335	I	0	“ Yes , I know ; he quietly picked up nearly all of it for a song ; then he bought about twice as much more , deliverable upon call ; and he was about to call when I left . ”
129630	129728	129335	129335	I	0	“ Very well , he did call . The boys could n't deliver . Oh , he had them -- and he just settled his grip and squeezed them . They were laughing in their sleeves over their smartness in selling stock to him at 15 and 16 and along there that was n't worth 10 . Well , when they had laughed long enough on that side of their mouths , they rested - up that side by shifting the laugh to the other side . That was when they compromised with the Invincible at 283 ! ”
129729	129733	129295	129295	He	131	“ Good land ! ”
129734	129948	129295	129295	He	131	“ He skinned them alive , and they deserved it -- anyway , the whole kingdom rejoiced . Well , among the flayed were Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred , nephews to the king . End of the first act . Act second , scene first , an apartment in Carlisle castle , where the court had gone for a few days ' hunting . Persons present , the whole tribe of the king 's nephews . Mordred and Agravaine propose to call the guileless Arthur 's attention to Guenever and Sir Launcelot . Sir Gawaine , Sir Gareth , and Sir Gaheris will have nothing to do with it . A dispute ensues , with loud talk ; in the midst of it enter the king . Mordred and Agravaine spring their devastating tale upon him . _ Tableau _ . A trap is laid for Launcelot , by the king 's command , and Sir Launcelot walks into it . He made it sufficiently uncomfortable for the ambushed witnesses -- to wit , Mordred , Agravaine , and twelve knights of lesser rank , for he killed every one of them but Mordred ; but of course that could n't straighten matters between Launcelot and the king , and did n't . ”
129949	129985	129335	129335	I	0	“ Oh , dear , only one thing could result -- I see that . War , and the knights of the realm divided into a king 's party and a Sir Launcelot 's party . ”
129986	130067	129335	129335	I	0	“ Yes -- that was the way of it . The king sent the queen to the stake , proposing to purify her with fire . Launcelot and his knights rescued her , and in doing it slew certain good old friends of yours and mine -- in fact , some of the best we ever had ; to wit , Sir Belias le Orgulous , Sir Segwarides , Sir Griflet le Fils de Dieu , Sir Brandiles , Sir Aglovale-- ”
130068	130077	129295	129295	He	131	“ Oh , you tear out my heartstrings . ”
130078	130095	129295	129295	He	131	“ --wait , I 'm not done yet -- Sir Tor , Sir Gauter , Sir Gillimer-- ”
130096	130115	129335	129335	I	0	“ The very best man in my subordinate nine . What a handy right - fielder he was ! ”
130116	130133	129335	129335	I	0	“ --Sir Reynold 's three brothers , Sir Damus , Sir Priamus , Sir Kay the Stranger-- ”
130134	130162	129295	129295	He	131	“ My peerless short - stop ! I 've seen him catch a daisy - cutter in his teeth . Come , I ca n't stand this ! ”
130163	130186	129295	129295	He	131	“ --Sir Driant , Sir Lambegus , Sir Herminde , Sir Pertilope , Sir Perimones , and -- whom do you think ? ”
130187	130193	129335	129335	I	0	“ Rush ! Go on . ”
130194	130204	129295	129295	He	131	“ Sir Gaheris , and Sir Gareth -- both ! ”
130205	130217	129295	129295	He	131	“ Oh , incredible ! Their love for Launcelot was indestructible . ”
130218	130340	129295	129295	He	131	“ Well , it was an accident . They were simply onlookers ; they were unarmed , and were merely there to witness the queen 's punishment . Sir Launcelot smote down whoever came in the way of his blind fury , and he killed these without noticing who they were . Here is an instantaneous photograph one of our boys got of the battle ; it 's for sale on every news - stand . There -- the figures nearest the queen are Sir Launcelot with his sword up , and Sir Gareth gasping his latest breath . You can catch the agony in the queen 's face through the curling smoke . It 's a rattling battle - picture . ”
130341	130364	129335	129335	I	0	“ Indeed , it is . We must take good care of it ; its historical value is incalculable . Go on . ”
130365	130544	129295	129295	He	131	“ Well , the rest of the tale is just war , pure and simple . Launcelot retreated to his town and castle of Joyous Gard , and gathered there a great following of knights . The king , with a great host , went there , and there was desperate fighting during several days , and , as a result , all the plain around was paved with corpses and cast - iron . Then the Church patched up a peace between Arthur and Launcelot and the queen and everybody -- everybody but Sir Gawaine . He was bitter about the slaying of his brothers , Gareth and Gaheris , and would not be appeased . He notified Launcelot to get him thence , and make swift preparation , and look to be soon attacked . So Launcelot sailed to his Duchy of Guienne with his following , and Gawaine soon followed with an army , and he beguiled Arthur to go with him . Arthur left the kingdom in Sir Mordred 's hands until you should return-- ”
130545	130554	129295	129295	He	131	“ Ah -- a king 's customary wisdom ! ”
130555	130660	129295	129295	He	131	“ Yes . Sir Mordred set himself at once to work to make his kingship permanent . He was going to marry Guenever , as a first move ; but she fled and shut herself up in the Tower of London . Mordred attacked ; the Bishop of Canterbury dropped down on him with the Interdict . The king returned ; Mordred fought him at Dover , at Canterbury , and again at Barham Down . Then there was talk of peace and a composition . Terms , Mordred to have Cornwall and Kent during Arthur 's life , and the whole kingdom afterward . ”
130661	130684	129335	129335	I	0	“ Well , upon my word ! My dream of a republic to _ be _ a dream , and so remain . ”
130685	130872	129295	129295	He	131	“ Yes . The two armies lay near Salisbury . Gawaine -- Gawaine 's head is at Dover Castle , he fell in the fight there -- Gawaine appeared to Arthur in a dream , at least his ghost did , and warned him to refrain from conflict for a month , let the delay cost what it might . But battle was precipitated by an accident . Arthur had given order that if a sword was raised during the consultation over the proposed treaty with Mordred , sound the trumpet and fall on ! for he had no confidence in Mordred . Mordred had given a similar order to _ his _ people . Well , by and by an adder bit a knight 's heel ; the knight forgot all about the order , and made a slash at the adder with his sword . Inside of half a minute those two prodigious hosts came together with a crash ! They butchered away all day . Then the king -- however , we have started something fresh since you left -- our paper has . ”
130873	130880	129295	129295	He	131	“ No ? What is that ? ”
130881	130885	129295	129295	He	131	“ War correspondence ! ”
130886	130893	129335	129335	I	0	“ Why , that 's good . ”
130894	131442	129295	129295	He	131	“ Yes , the paper was booming right along , for the Interdict made no impression , got no grip , while the war lasted . I had war correspondents with both armies . I will finish that battle by reading you what one of the boys says : Then the king looked about him , and then was he ware of all his host and of all his good knights were left no more on live but two knights , that was Sir Lucan de Butlere , and his brother Sir Bedivere : and they were full sore wounded . Jesu mercy , said the king , where are all my noble knights becomen ? Alas that ever I should see this doleful day . For now , said Arthur , I am come to mine end . But would to God that I wist where were that traitor Sir Mordred , that hath caused all this mischief . Then was King Arthur ware where Sir Mordred leaned upon his sword among a great heap of dead men . Now give me my spear , said Arthur unto Sir Lucan , for yonder I have espied the traitor that all this woe hath wrought . Sir , let him be , said Sir Lucan , for he is unhappy ; and if ye pass this unhappy day , ye shall be right well revenged upon him . Good lord , remember ye of your night ’s dream , and what the spirit of Sir Gawaine told you this night , yet God of his great goodness hath preserved you hitherto . Therefore , for God ’s sake , my lord , leave off by this . For blessed be God ye have won the field : for here we be three on live , and with Sir Mordred is none on live . And if ye leave off now , this wicked day of destiny is past . Tide me death , betide me life , saith the king , now I see him yonder alone , he shall never escape mine hands , for at a better avail shall I never have him . God speed you well , said Sir Bedivere . Then the king gat his spear in both his hands , and ran toward Sir Mordred crying , Traitor , now is thy death day come . And when Sir Mordred heard Sir Arthur , he ran until him with his sword drawn in his hand . And then King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the shield , with a foin of his spear throughout the body more than a fathom . And when Sir Mordred felt that he had his death ’s wound , he thrust himself , with the might that he had , up to the butt of King Arthur ’s spear . And right so he smote his father Arthur with his sword holden in both his hands , on the side of the head , that the sword pierced the helmet and the brain - pan , and therewithal Sir Mordred fell stark dead to the earth . And the noble Arthur fell in a swoon to the earth , and there he swooned oft - times — ”
131443	131477	129295	129295	He	131	“ That is a good piece of war correspondence , Clarence ; you are a first - rate newspaper man . Well -- is the king all right ? Did he get well ? ”
131478	131488	129335	129335	I	0	“ Poor soul , no . He is dead . ”
131509	131516	129295	129295	He	131	“ And the queen , Clarence ? ”
131517	131526	129295	129295	He	131	“ She is a nun , in Almesbury . ”
131527	131548	129295	129295	He	131	“ What changes ! and in such a short while . It is inconceivable . What next , I wonder ? ”
131549	131557	129295	129295	He	131	“ I can tell you what next . ”
131558	131561	129295	129295	He	131	“ Well ? ”
131562	131571	129295	129295	He	131	“ Stake our lives and stand by them ! ”
131572	131580	129295	129295	He	131	“ What do you mean by that ? ”
131581	131638	129295	129295	He	131	“ The Church is master now . The Interdict included you with Mordred ; it is not to be removed while you remain alive . The clans are gathering . The Church has gathered all the knights that are left alive , and as soon as you are discovered we shall have business on our hands . ”
131639	131655	129295	129295	He	131	“ Stuff ! With our deadly scientific war - material ; with our hosts of trained-- ”
131656	131668	129295	129295	He	131	“ Save your breath -- we have n't sixty faithful left ! ”
131669	131686	129295	129295	He	131	“ What are you saying ? Our schools , our colleges , our vast workshops , our-- ”
131687	131718	129295	129295	He	131	“ When those knights come , those establishments will empty themselves and go over to the enemy . Did you think you had educated the superstition out of those people ? ”
131719	131726	129295	129295	He	131	“ I certainly did think it . ”
131727	131779	129295	129295	He	131	“ Well , then , you may unthink it . They stood every strain easily --until the Interdict . Since then , they merely put on a bold outside -- at heart they are quaking . Make up your mind to it --when the armies come , the mask will fall . ”
131780	131799	129295	129295	He	131	“ It 's hard news . We are lost . They will turn our own science against us . ”
131800	131806	129295	129295	He	131	“ No they wo n't . ”
131807	131810	129295	129295	He	131	“ Why ? ”
131811	131867	129295	129295	He	131	“ Because I and a handful of the faithful have blocked that game . I 'll tell you what I 've done , and what moved me to it . Smart as you are , the Church was smarter . It was the Church that sent you cruising -- through her servants , the doctors . ”
131868	131871	129295	129295	He	131	“ Clarence ! ”
131872	131903	129295	129295	He	131	“ It is the truth . I know it . Every officer of your ship was the Church 's picked servant , and so was every man of the crew . ”
131904	131909	129295	129295	He	131	“ Oh , come ! ”
131910	131969	129295	129295	He	131	“ It is just as I tell you . I did not find out these things at once , but I found them out finally . Did you send me verbal information , by the commander of the ship , to the effect that upon his return to you , with supplies , you were going to leave Cadiz-- ”
131970	131982	129295	129295	He	131	“ Cadiz ! I have n't been at Cadiz at all ! ”
131983	132009	129295	129295	He	131	“ --going to leave Cadiz and cruise in distant seas indefinitely , for the health of your family ? Did you send me that word ? ”
132010	132024	129295	129295	He	131	“ Of course not . I would have written , would n't I ? ”
132025	132088	129295	129295	He	131	“ Naturally . I was troubled and suspicious . When the commander sailed again I managed to ship a spy with him . I have never heard of vessel or spy since . I gave myself two weeks to hear from you in . Then I resolved to send a ship to Cadiz . There was a reason why I did n't . ”
132089	132094	129295	129295	He	131	“ What was that ? ”
132095	132279	129295	129295	He	131	“ Our navy had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared ! Also , as suddenly and as mysteriously , the railway and telegraph and telephone service ceased , the men all deserted , poles were cut down , the Church laid a ban upon the electric light ! I had to be up and doing -- and straight off . Your life was safe -- nobody in these kingdoms but Merlin would venture to touch such a magician as you without ten thousand men at his back -- I had nothing to think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your coming . I felt safe myself -- nobody would be anxious to touch a pet of yours . So this is what I did . From our various works I selected all the men -- boys I mean -- whose faithfulness under whatsoever pressure I could swear to , and I called them together secretly and gave them their instructions . There are fifty - two of them ; none younger than fourteen , and none above seventeen years old . ”
132280	132287	129295	129295	He	131	“ Why did you select boys ? ”
132288	132419	129295	129295	He	131	“ Because all the others were born in an atmosphere of superstition and reared in it . It is in their blood and bones . We imagined we had educated it out of them ; they thought so , too ; the Interdict woke them up like a thunderclap ! It revealed them to themselves , and it revealed them to me , too . With boys it was different . Such as have been under our training from seven to ten years have had no acquaintance with the Church 's terrors , and it was among these that I found my fifty - two . As a next move , I paid a private visit to that old cave of Merlin's -- not the small one -- the big one-- ”
132420	132441	129295	129295	He	131	“ Yes , the one where we secretly established our first great electric plant when I was projecting a miracle . ”
132442	132478	129295	129295	He	131	“ Just so . And as that miracle had n't become necessary then , I thought it might be a good idea to utilize the plant now . I 've provisioned the cave for a siege-- ”
132479	132490	129295	129295	He	131	“ A good idea , a first - rate idea . ”
132491	132653	129295	129295	He	131	“ I think so . I placed four of my boys there as a guard -- inside , and out of sight . Nobody was to be hurt -- while outside ; but any attempt to enter -- well , we said just let anybody try it ! Then I went out into the hills and uncovered and cut the secret wires which connected your bedroom with the wires that go to the dynamite deposits under all our vast factories , mills , workshops , magazines , etc . , and about midnight I and my boys turned out and connected that wire with the cave , and nobody but you and I suspects where the other end of it goes to . We laid it under ground , of course , and it was all finished in a couple of hours or so . We sha'n't have to leave our fortress now when we want to blow up our civilization . ”
132654	132704	129295	129295	He	131	“ It was the right move -- and the natural one ; military necessity , in the changed condition of things . Well , what changes _ have _ come ! We expected to be besieged in the palace some time or other , but --however , go on . ”
132705	132714	129295	129295	He	131	“ Next , we built a wire fence . ”
132715	132719	129295	129295	He	131	“ Wire fence ? ”
132720	132737	129295	129295	He	131	“ Yes . You dropped the hint of it yourself , two or three years ago . ”
132738	132778	129295	129295	He	131	“ Oh , I remember -- the time the Church tried her strength against us the first time , and presently thought it wise to wait for a hopefuler season . Well , how have you arranged the fence ? ”
132779	132810	129295	129295	He	131	“ I start twelve immensely strong wires -- naked , not insulated --from a big dynamo in the cave -- dynamo with no brushes except a positive and a negative one-- ”
132811	132818	129295	129295	He	131	“ Yes , that 's right . ”
132819	132870	129295	129295	He	131	“ The wires go out from the cave and fence in a circle of level ground a hundred yards in diameter ; they make twelve independent fences , ten feet apart -- that is to say , twelve circles within circles -- and their ends come into the cave again . ”
132871	132877	129295	129295	He	131	“ Right ; go on . ”
132878	132903	129295	129295	He	131	“ The fences are fastened to heavy oaken posts only three feet apart , and these posts are sunk five feet in the ground . ”
132904	132911	129295	129295	He	131	“ That is good and strong . ”
132912	132966	129295	129295	He	131	“ Yes . The wires have no ground - connection outside of the cave . They go out from the positive brush of the dynamo ; there is a ground - connection through the negative brush ; the other ends of the wire return to the cave , and each is grounded independently . ”
132967	132977	129295	129295	He	131	“ No , no , that wo n't do ! ”
132978	132981	129295	129295	He	131	“ Why ? ”
132982	133157	129295	129295	He	131	“ It 's too expensive -- uses up force for nothing . You do n't want any ground - connection except the one through the negative brush . The other end of every wire must be brought back into the cave and fastened independently , and _ without _ any ground - connection . Now , then , observe the economy of it . A cavalry charge hurls itself against the fence ; you are using no power , you are spending no money , for there is only one ground - connection till those horses come against the wire ; the moment they touch it they form a connection with the negative brush _ through the ground _ , and drop dead . Do n't you see?--you are using no energy until it is needed ; your lightning is there , and ready , like the load in a gun ; but it is n't costing you a cent till you touch it off . Oh , yes , the single ground - connection-- ”
133158	133200	129295	129295	He	131	“ Of course ! I do n't know how I overlooked that . It 's not only cheaper , but it 's more effectual than the other way , for if wires break or get tangled , no harm is done . ”
133201	133229	129295	129295	He	131	“ No , especially if we have a tell - tale in the cave and disconnect the broken wire . Well , go on . The gatlings ? ”
133230	133269	129295	129295	He	131	“ Yes -- that 's arranged . In the center of the inner circle , on a spacious platform six feet high , I 've grouped a battery of thirteen gatling guns , and provided plenty of ammunition . ”
133270	133303	129295	129295	He	131	“ That 's it . They command every approach , and when the Church 's knights arrive , there 's going to be music . The brow of the precipice over the cave-- ”
133304	133327	129295	129295	He	131	“ I 've got a wire fence there , and a gatling . They wo n't drop any rocks down on us . ”
133328	133339	129295	129295	He	131	“ Well , and the glass - cylinder dynamite torpedoes ? ”
133340	133450	129295	129295	He	131	“ That 's attended to . It 's the prettiest garden that was ever planted . It 's a belt forty feet wide , and goes around the outer fence -- distance between it and the fence one hundred yards -- kind of neutral ground that space is . There is n't a single square yard of that whole belt but is equipped with a torpedo . We laid them on the surface of the ground , and sprinkled a layer of sand over them . It 's an innocent looking garden , but you let a man start in to hoe it once , and you 'll see . ”
133451	133457	129295	129295	He	131	“ You tested the torpedoes ? ”
133458	133467	129295	129295	He	131	“ Well , I was going to , but-- ”
133468	133483	129295	129295	He	131	“ But what ? Why , it 's an immense oversight not to apply a-- ”
133484	133515	129295	129295	He	131	“ Test ? Yes , I know ; but they 're all right ; I laid a few in the public road beyond our lines and they 've been tested . ”
133516	133528	129295	129295	He	131	“ Oh , that alters the case . Who did it ? ”
133529	133534	129295	129295	He	131	“ A Church committee . ”
133535	133539	129295	129295	He	131	“ How kind ! ”
133540	133570	129295	129295	He	131	“ Yes . They came to command us to make submission . You see they did n't really come to test the torpedoes ; that was merely an incident . ”
133571	133579	129295	129295	He	131	“ Did the committee make a report ? ”
133580	133595	129295	129295	He	131	“ Yes , they made one . You could have heard it a mile . ”
133596	133599	129295	129295	He	131	“ Unanimous ? ”
133600	133631	129295	129295	He	131	“ That was the nature of it . After that I put up some signs , for the protection of future committees , and we have had no intruders since . ”
133632	133648	129295	129295	He	131	“ Clarence , you 've done a world of work , and done it perfectly . ”
133649	133666	129295	129295	He	131	“ We had plenty of time for it ; there was n't any occasion for hurry . ”
133685	133708	133682	133682	I	0	“ Yes , everything is ready ; everything is shipshape , no detail is wanting . I know what to do now . ”
133709	133719	129295	129295	He	131	“ So do I ; sit down and wait . ”
133720	133734	129295	129295	He	131	“ No , _ sir _ ! rise up and _ strike _ ! ”
133735	133741	129295	129295	He	131	“ Do you mean it ? ”
133742	133799	129295	129295	He	131	“ Yes , indeed ! The _ de_fensive is n't in my line , and the _ of_fensive is . That is , when I hold a fair hand -- two - thirds as good a hand as the enemy . Oh , yes , we 'll rise up and strike ; that 's our game . ”
133800	133815	129295	129295	He	131	“ A hundred to one you are right . When does the performance begin ? ”
133816	133827	129295	129295	He	131	“ _ Now ! _ We 'll proclaim the Republic . ”
133828	133841	129295	129295	He	131	“ Well , that _ will _ precipitate things , sure enough ! ”
133842	133893	129295	129295	He	131	“ It will make them buzz , I tell you ! England will be a hornets ' nest before noon to - morrow , if the Church 's hand has n't lost its cunning -- and we know it has n't . Now you write and I 'll dictate thus : “
133895	134064	134065	134065	I	0	“ BE IT KNOWN UNTO ALL . Whereas the king having died and left no heir , it becomes my duty to continue the executive authority vested in me , until a government shall have been created and set in motion . The monarchy has lapsed , it no longer exists . By consequence , all political power has reverted to its original source , the people of the nation . With the monarchy , its several adjuncts died also ; wherefore there is no longer a nobility , no longer a privileged class , no longer an Established Church ; all men are become exactly equal ; they are upon one common level , and religion is free . _ A Republic is hereby proclaimed _ , as being the natural estate of a nation when other authority has ceased . It is the duty of the British people to meet together immediately , and by their votes elect representatives and deliver into their hands the government . ”
134068	134072	134065	134065	I	0	“ The Boss , ”
134083	134100	134081	134081	Clarence	131	“ Why , that tells where we are , and invites them to call right away . ”
134101	134164	134081	134081	Clarence	131	“ That is the idea . We _ strike_--by the Proclamation -- then it 's their innings . Now have the thing set up and printed and posted , right off ; that is , give the order ; then , if you 've got a couple of bicycles handy at the foot of the hill , ho for Merlin 's Cave ! ”
134165	134218	134081	134081	Clarence	131	“ I shall be ready in ten minutes . What a cyclone there is going to be to - morrow when this piece of paper gets to work ! ... It 's a pleasant old palace , this is ; I wonder if we shall ever again --but never mind about that . ”
134293	134309	134310	134311	These people	551	“ _ and no telling at what moment -- therefore , vacate at once _ . ”
134511	134539	134507	134507	I	0	“ Sandy , if you and Hello - Central were here in the cave , instead of only your photographs , what good times we could have ! ”

135234	135390	135216	135216	he	4220	“ We have tried to forget what we are -- English boys ! We have tried to put reason before sentiment , duty before love ; our minds approve , but our hearts reproach us . While apparently it was only the nobility , only the gentry , only the twenty - five or thirty thousand knights left alive out of the late wars , we were of one mind , and undisturbed by any troubling doubt ; each and every one of these fifty - two lads who stand here before you , said , ' They have chosen -- it is their affair . ' But think!--the matter is altered--_All England is marching against us _ ! Oh , sir , consider ! --reflect!--these people are our people , they are bone of our bone , flesh of our flesh , we love them -- do not ask us to destroy our nation ! ”
135443	135536	135440	135440	I	0	“ My boys , your hearts are in the right place , you have thought the worthy thought , you have done the worthy thing . You are English boys , you will remain English boys , and you will keep that name unsmirched . Give yourselves no further concern , let your minds be at peace . Consider this : while all England is marching against us , who is in the van ? Who , by the commonest rules of war , will march in the front ? Answer me . ”
135537	135545	135422	135423	that boy	4222	“ The mounted host of mailed knights . ”
135546	135667	135440	135440	I	0	“ True . They are thirty thousand strong . Acres deep they will march . Now , observe : none but _ they _ will ever strike the sand - belt ! Then there will be an episode ! Immediately after , the civilian multitude in the rear will retire , to meet business engagements elsewhere . None but nobles and gentry are knights , and _ none but these _ will remain to dance to our music after that episode . It is absolutely true that we shall have to fight nobody but these thirty thousand knights . Now speak , and it shall be as you decide . Shall we avoid the battle , retire from the field ? ”
135668	135673	135440	135440	I	0	“ NO ! ! ! ”
135681	135697	135440	135440	I	0	“ Are you -- are you -- well , afraid of these thirty thousand knights ? ”
136630	136773	136622	136622	I	0	“ The war with the English nation , as a nation , is at an end . The nation has retired from the field and the war . Before it can be persuaded to return , war will have ceased . This campaign is the only one that is going to be fought . It will be brief --the briefest in history . Also the most destructive to life , considered from the standpoint of proportion of casualties to numbers engaged . We are done with the nation ; henceforth we deal only with the knights . English knights can be killed , but they can not be conquered . We know what is before us . While one of these men remains alive , our task is not finished , the war is not ended . We will kill them all . ”

137496	137524	137476	137476	Clarence	131	“ Dismember me this animal , and return him in a basket to the base - born knave who sent him ; other answer have I none ! ”
138240	138275	138237	138237	Clarence	131	“ They will be wanting to send a scout or two in the dark to make preliminary observations . Why not take the lightning off the outer fences , and give them a chance ? ”
138276	138294	138237	138237	Clarence	131	“ I 've already done it , Clarence . Did you ever know me to be inhospitable ? ”
138295	138309	138237	138237	Clarence	131	“ No , you are a good heart . I want to go and-- ”

138470	138498	138536	138537	a man	518	“ No , I think not . If you notice , it looks a lit -- why , it _ is _ a man!--leaning on the fence . ”

Where is your hand?--give it me , dear , let me hold it -- there --now all is well , all is peace , and I am happy again--_we _ are happy again , is n't it so , Sandy ? You are so dim , so vague , you are but a mist , a cloud , but you are _ here _ , and that is blessedness sufficient ; and I have your hand ; do n't take it away -- it is for only a little while , I shall not require it long .... Was that the child ? ... Hello - Central ! ... she does n't answer . Asleep , perhaps ? Bring her when she wakes , and let me touch her hands , her face , her hair , and tell her good - bye .... Sandy ! Yes , you are there . I lost myself a moment , and I thought you were gone .... Have I been sick long ? It must be so ; it seems months to me . And such dreams ! such strange and awful dreams , Sandy ! Dreams that were as real as reality -- delirium , of course , but _ so _ real ! Why , I thought the king was dead , I thought you were in Gaul and could n't get home , I thought there was a revolution ; in the fantastic frenzy of these dreams , I thought that Clarence and I and a handful of my cadets fought and exterminated the whole chivalry of England ! But even that was not the strangest . I seemed to be a creature out of a remote unborn age , centuries hence , and even _ that _ was as real as the rest ! Yes , I seemed to have flown back out of that age into this of ours , and then forward to it again , and was set down , a stranger and forlorn in that strange England , with an abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you ! between me and my home and my friends ! between me and all that is dear to me , all that could make life worth the living ! It was awful --awfuler than you can ever imagine , Sandy . Ah , watch by me , Sandy --stay by me every moment--_don't _ let me go out of my mind again ; death is nothing , let it come , but not with those dreams , not with the torture of those hideous dreams -- I can not endure _ that _ again .... Sandy ? ... ”
