4806	4820	4798	4799	every one	529	“ Ah , he is in sin , and has got his warning . ”

6062	6094	6050	6050	We	570	“ Joan , wake ! Wake , there is no moment to lose ! Come and plead for the fairies — come and save them ; only you can do it ! ”
6485	6504	6448	6448	She	588	“ The fairies were to go if they showed themselves to people again , is it not so ? ”
6505	6514	6571	6571	he	591	“ Yes , that was it , dear . ”
6515	6554	6571	6571	he	591	“ If a man comes prying into a person ’s room at midnight when that person is half - naked , will you be so unjust as to say that that person is showing himself to that man ? ”
6555	6560	6561	6563	The good priest	591	“ Well — no . ”
6575	6594	6571	6571	he	591	“ Is a sin a sin , anyway , even if one did not intend to commit it ? ”
6605	6619	6599	6599	his	129	“ Oh , my poor little child , I see all my fault , ”
6673	6762	6661	6661	her	592	“ Then the fairies committed no sin , for there was no intention to commit one , they not knowing that any one was by ; and because they were little creatures and could not speak for themselves and say the law was against the intention , not against the innocent act , because they had no friend to think that simple thing for them and say it , they have been sent away from their home forever , and it was wrong , wrong to do it ! ”
6776	6845	6763	6765	The good father	593	“ Oh , out of the mouths of babes and sucklings the heedless and unthinking are condemned ; would God I could bring the little creatures back , for your sake . And mine , yes , and mine ; for I have been unjust . There , there , do n’t cry — nobody could be sorrier than your poor old friend — don’t cry , dear . ”
6846	6884	6885	6886	Pere Fronte	129	“ But I ca n’t stop right away , I ’ve got to . And it is no little matter , this thing that you have done . Is being sorry penance enough for such an act ? ”
6906	6936	6945	6945	she	592	“ Oh , thou remorseless but most just accuser , no , it is not . I will put on sackcloth and ashes ; there — are you satisfied ? ”
6965	6978	6945	6945	she	592	“ Yes , that will do — if it will clear you . ”
7065	7074	7062	7062	he	594	“ Would you mind helping me , dear ? ”
7075	7080	7062	7062	he	594	“ How , father ? ”
7096	7109	7089	7089	his	594	“ Take the ashes and put them on my head for me . ”
7159	7188	7151	7151	her	110	“ Oh , it is dreadful . I did n’t know that that was what one meant by sackcloth and ashes — do please get up , father . ”
7189	7204	7151	7151	her	110	“ But I ca n’t until I am forgiven . Do you forgive me ? ”
7205	7242	7146	7146	She	110	“ I ? Oh , you have done nothing to me , father ; it is yourself that must forgive yourself for wronging those poor things . Please get up , father , wo n’t you ? ”
7243	7301	7151	7151	her	110	“ But I am worse off now than I was before . I thought I was earning your forgiveness , but if it is my own , I ca n’t be lenient ; it would not become me . Now what can I do ? Find me some way out of this with your wise little head . ”
7348	7364	7322	7322	she	110	“ There — now it is done . Oh , please get up , father . ”
7382	7419	7365	7367	The old man	594	“ Oh , you incomparable child ! It ’s a humble martyrdom , and not of a sort presentable in a picture , but the right and true spirit is in it ; that I testify . ”
7473	7497	7458	7458	he	594	“ Joan , you were used to make wreaths there at the Fairy Tree with the other children ; is it not so ? ”
7580	7585	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ Yes , father . ”
7586	7595	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ Did you hang them on the tree ? ”
7596	7601	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ No , father . ”
7602	7609	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ Did n’t hang them there ? ”
7610	7613	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ No . ”
7614	7620	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ Why did n’t you ? ”
7621	7632	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ I — well , I did n’t wish to . ”
7633	7639	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ Did n’t wish to ? ”
7640	7645	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ No , father . ”
7646	7654	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ What did you do with them ? ”
7655	7663	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ I hung them in the church . ”
7664	7677	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ Why did n’t you want to hang them in the tree ? ”
7678	7703	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ Because it was said that the fairies were of kin to the Fiend , and that it was sinful to show them honor . ”
7704	7716	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ Did you believe it was wrong to honor them so ? ”
7717	7727	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ Yes . I thought it must be wrong . ”
7728	7767	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ Then if it was wrong to honor them in that way , and if they were of kin to the Fiend , they could be dangerous company for you and the other children , could n’t they ? ”
7768	7779	7577	7577	Joan	110	“ I suppose so — yes , I think so . ”
7803	7879	7800	7800	He	602	“ Then the matter stands like this . They were banned creatures , of fearful origin ; they could be dangerous company for the children . Now give me a rational reason , dear , if you can think of any , why you call it a wrong to drive them into banishment , and why you would have saved them from it . In a word , what loss have you suffered by it ? ”
8099	8115	8480	8480	she	607	“ Oh , father , how can you talk like that ? Who owns France ? ”
8116	8122	8057	8057	her	604	“ God and the King . ”
8123	8127	8061	8061	she	604	“ Not Satan ? ”
8128	8151	8480	8480	she	607	“ Satan , my child ? This is the footstool of the Most High — Satan owns no handful of its soil . ”
8152	8478	8480	8480	she	607	“ Then who gave those poor creatures their home ? God . Who protected them in it all those centuries ? God . Who allowed them to dance and play there all those centuries and found no fault with it ? God . Who disapproved of God ’s approval and put a threat upon them ? A man . Who caught them again in harmless sports that God allowed and a man forbade , and carried out that threat , and drove the poor things away from the home the good God gave them in His mercy and His pity , and sent down His rain and dew and sunshine upon it five hundred years in token of His peace ? It was their home — theirs , by the grace of God and His good heart , and no man had a right to rob them of it . And they were the gentlest , truest friends that children ever had , and did them sweet and loving service all these five long centuries , and never any hurt or harm ; and the children loved them , and now they mourn for them , and there is no healing for their grief . And what had the children done that they should suffer this cruel stroke ? The poor fairies could have been dangerous company for the children ? Yes , but never had been ; and could is no argument . Kinsmen of the Fiend ? What of it ? Kinsmen of the Fiend have rights , and these had ; and children have rights , and these had ; and if I had been there I would have spoken — I would have begged for the children and the fiends , and stayed your hand and saved them all . But now — oh , now , all is lost ; everything is lost , and there is no help more ! ”
8557	8562	8563	8563	she	607	“ Poor little creatures ! ”
8566	8601	8563	8563	she	607	“ What can a person ’s heart be made of that can pity a Christian ’s child and yet ca n’t pity a devil ’s child , that a thousand times more needs it ! ”
8720	8755	8716	8716	him	129	“ Ah , me , poor children , poor fiends , they have rights , and she said true — I never thought of that . God forgive me , I am to blame . ”
9870	9874	9857	9857	he	645	“ Sit down ! ”
9922	9931	9918	9919	The man	648	“ God Almighty bless you , my darling ! ”
9953	9965	9945	9945	he	647	“ Do you hear me ? Sit down , I say ! ”
10002	10014	9999	9999	Joan	110	“ Father , he is hungry ; I can see it . ”
10015	10074	10141	10141	She	651	“ Let him work for food , then . We are being eaten out of house and home by his like , and I have said I would endure it no more , and will keep my word . He has the face of a rascal anyhow , and a villain . Sit down , I tell you ! ”
10075	10106	10141	10141	She	651	“ I know not if he is a rascal or no , but he is hungry , father , and shall have my porridge — I do not need it . ”
10107	10140	10141	10141	She	651	“ If you do n’t obey me I’ll — Rascals are not entitled to help from honest people , and no bite nor sup shall they have in this house . Joan ! ”
10162	10277	10143	10143	her	651	“ Father , if you will not let me , then it must be as you say ; but I would that you would think — then you would see that it is not right to punish one part of him for what the other part has done ; for it is that poor stranger ’s head that does the evil things , but it is not his head that is hungry , it is his stomach , and it has done no harm to anybody , but is without blame , and innocent , not having any way to do a wrong , even if it was minded to it . Please let — ”
10278	10293	10143	10143	her	651	“ What an idea ! It is the most idiotic speech I ever heard . ”
10358	10374	10375	10375	he	652	“ I will differ with you there , gossip , and will undertake to show the company”—here
10387	10441	10382	10382	his	652	way—“that there is a grain of sense in what the child has said ; for look you , it is of a certainty most true and demonstrable that it is a man ’s head that is master and supreme ruler over his whole body . Is that granted ? Will any deny it ? ”
10451	10517	10518	10518	Everybody	464	“ Very well , then ; that being the case , no part of the body is responsible for the result when it carries out an order delivered to it by the head ; ergo , the head is alone responsible for crimes done by a man ’s hands or feet or stomach — do you get the idea ? am I right thus far ? ”
10583	10620	10621	10621	he	652	“ Now , then , we will consider what the term responsibility means , and how it affects the case in point . Responsibility makes a man responsible for only those things for which he is properly responsible”—and
10651	10669	10646	10646	several	662	“ He is right!—he has put that whole tangled thing into a nutshell — it is wonderful ! ”
10688	10812	10684	10684	he	652	“ Very good . Let us suppose the case of a pair of tongs that falls upon a man ’s foot , causing a cruel hurt . Will you claim that the tongs are punishable for that ? The question is answered ; I see by your faces that you would call such a claim absurd . Now , why is it absurd ? It is absurd because , there being no reasoning faculty — that is to say , no faculty of personal command — in a pair of tongs , personal responsibility for the acts of the tongs is wholly absent from the tongs ; and , therefore , responsibility being absent , punishment can not ensue . Am I right ? ”
10822	10904	10684	10684	he	652	“ Now , then , we arrive at a man ’s stomach . Consider how exactly , how marvelously , indeed , its situation corresponds to that of a pair of tongs . Listen — and take careful note , I beg you . Can a man ’s stomach plan a murder ? No . Can it plan a theft ? No . Can it plan an incendiary fire ? No . Now answer me — can a pair of tongs ? ”
10911	10914	10684	10684	he	652	“ No ! ”
10916	10923	10684	10684	he	652	“ The cases are just exact ! ”
10925	10933	10684	10684	he	652	“ Do n’t he do it splendid ! ”
10935	11056	11057	11057	He	652	“ Now , then , friends and neighbors , a stomach which can not plan a crime can not be a principal in the commission of it — that is plain , as you see . The matter is narrowed down by that much ; we will narrow it further . Can a stomach , of its own motion , assist at a crime ? The answer is no , because command is absent , the reasoning faculty is absent , volition is absent — as in the case of the tongs . We perceive now , do we not , that the stomach is totally irresponsible for crimes committed , either in whole or in part , by it ? ”
11065	11221	11057	11057	He	652	“ Then what do we arrive at as our verdict ? Clearly this : that there is no such thing in this world as a guilty stomach ; that in the body of the veriest rascal resides a pure and innocent stomach ; that , whatever it ’s owner may do , it at least should be sacred in our eyes ; and that while God gives us minds to think just and charitable and honorable thoughts , it should be , and is , our privilege , as well as our duty , not only to feed the hungry stomach that resides in a rascal , having pity for its sorrow and its need , but to do it gladly , gratefully , in recognition of its sturdy and loyal maintenance of its purity and innocence in the midst of temptation and in company so repugnant to its better feelings . I am done . ”
11370	11383	11363	11363	his	130	“ It ’s all right , Joan — give him the porridge ! ”
11894	11919	11880	11881	the stranger	647	“ Little maid — whom God keep!—you have brought me from death to life this night ; now listen : here is your reward , ”
12561	12568	12556	12557	Little Mengette	138	“ Look ! What is that ? ”
12616	12623	12556	12557	Little Mengette	138	“ It ’s a black flag . ”
12624	12634	12556	12557	Little Mengette	138	“ A black flag ! No — is it ? ”
12635	12647	12556	12557	Little Mengette	138	“ You can see for yourself that it is nothing else . ”
12648	12669	12556	12557	Little Mengette	138	“ It is a black flag , sure ! Now , has any ever seen the like of that before ? ”
12670	12676	12556	12557	Little Mengette	138	“ What can it mean ? ”
12677	12688	12556	12557	Little Mengette	138	“ Mean ? It means something dreadful — what else ? ”
12689	12710	12556	12557	Little Mengette	138	“ That is nothing to the point ; anybody knows that without the telling . But what?—that is the question . ”
12711	12739	12556	12557	Little Mengette	138	“ It is a chance that he that bears it can answer as well as any that are here , if you contain yourself till he comes . ”
12740	12749	12750	12752	Some named one	725	“ He runs well . Who is it ? ”
12866	12887	12849	12849	he	134	“ There ! Stand there and represent France while I get my breath . She needs no other flag now . ”
12934	13003	12931	12931	he	134	“ Black news is come . A treaty has been made at Troyes between France and the English and Burgundians . By it France is betrayed and delivered over , tied hand and foot , to the enemy . It is the work of the Duke of Burgundy and that she - devil , the Queen of France . It marries Henry of England to Catharine of France — ”
13004	13035	12931	12931	he	134	“ Is not this a lie ? Marries the daughter of France to the Butcher of Agincourt ? It is not to be believed . You have not heard aright . ”
13036	13100	12931	12931	he	134	“ If you can not believe that , Jacques d’Arc , then you have a difficult task indeed before you , for worse is to come . Any child that is born of that marriage — if even a girl — is to inherit the thrones of both England and France , and this double ownership is to remain with its posterity forever ! ”
13101	13129	13131	13132	Edmond Aubrey	136	“ Now that is certainly a lie , for it runs counter to our Salic law , and so is not legal and can not have effect , ”
13203	13256	13193	13194	presently Haumette	149	“ It is not fair to break him up so in his tale ; pray let him go on . You find fault with his history because it seems to be lies . That were reason for satisfaction — that kind of lies — not discontent . Tell the rest , Etienne . ”
13257	13301	13193	13194	presently Haumette	149	“ There is but this to tell : Our King , Charles VI . , is to reign until he dies , then Henry V. of England is to be Regent of France until a child of his shall be old enough to — ”
13302	13321	13323	13324	the Paladin	732	“ That man is to reign over us — the Butcher ? It is lies ! all lies ! ”
13326	13345	13323	13324	the Paladin	732	“ Besides , look you — what becomes of our Dauphin ? What says the treaty about him ? ”
13346	13360	13193	13194	presently Haumette	149	“ Nothing . It takes away his throne and makes him an outcast . ”
13384	13413	13375	13375	all	738	“ Our King would have to sign the treaty to make it good ; and that he would not do , seeing how it serves his own son . ”
13419	13436	13415	13416	the Sunflower	151	“ I will ask you this : Would the Queen sign a treaty disinheriting her son ? ”
13437	13489	13323	13324	the Paladin	732	“ That viper ? Certainly . Nobody is talking of her . Nobody expects better of her . There is no villainy she will stick at , if it feed her spite ; and she hates her son . Her signing it is of no consequence . The King must sign . ”
13490	13511	13640	13640	Jacques	130	“ I will ask you another thing . What is the King ’s condition ? Mad , is n’t he ? ”
13512	13544	13415	13416	the Sunflower	151	“ Yes , and his people love him all the more for it . It brings him near to them by his sufferings ; and pitying him makes them love him . ”
13545	13597	13323	13324	the Paladin	732	“ You say right , Jacques d’Arc . Well , what would you of one that is mad ? Does he know what he does ? No . Does he do what others make him do ? Yes . Now , then , I tell you he has signed the treaty . ”
13598	13605	13640	13640	Jacques	130	“ Who made him do it ? ”
13606	13617	13415	13416	the Sunflower	151	“ You know , without my telling . The Queen . ”
13644	13697	13640	13640	Jacques	130	“ But many reports come that are not true . Nothing so shameful as this has ever come before , nothing that cuts so deep , nothing that has dragged France so low ; therefore there is hope that this tale is but another idle rumor . Where did you get it ? ”
13720	13728	13715	13715	her	110	“ The cure of Maxey brought it . ”
13747	13753	13735	13735	We	742	“ Did he believe it ? ”
13765	13784	13785	13788	Some of the girls	745	“ He did . And that is not all . He said he knew it to be true . ”
13895	13931	13891	13892	Noel Rainguesson	135	“ Oh , are we never going to be men ! We do grow along so slowly , and France never needed soldiers as she needs them now , to wipe out this black insult . ”
13932	13937	13939	13940	Pierre Morel	132	“ I hate youth ! ”
13954	13997	13939	13940	Pierre Morel	132	“ You ’ve always got to wait , and wait , and wait — and here are the great wars wasting away for a hundred years , and you never get a chance . If I could only be a soldier now ! ”
13998	14012	14014	14015	the Paladin	732	“ As for me , I ’m not going to wait much longer , ”
14017	14075	14014	14015	the Paladin	732	“ and when I do start you ’ll hear from me , I promise you that . There are some who , in storming a castle , prefer to be in the rear ; but as for me , give me the front or none ; I will have none in front of me but the officers . ”
14089	14103	14109	14109	herself	155	“ I would I were a man ; I would start this minute ! ”
14117	14122	14124	14125	Cecile Letellier	156	“ So would I , ”
14140	14161	14124	14125	Cecile Letellier	156	“ I warrant you I would not turn back from the field though all England were in front of me . ”
14162	14165	14167	14168	the Paladin	732	“ Pooh ! ”
14170	14226	14167	14168	the Paladin	732	“ girls can brag , but that ’s all they are good for . Let a thousand of them come face to face with a handful of soldiers once , if you want to see what running is like . Here ’s little Joan — next she ’ll be threatening to go for a soldier ! ”
14251	14390	14241	14242	the Paladin	157	“ Why you can just see her!—see her plunge into battle like any old veteran . Yes , indeed ; and not a poor shabby common soldier like us , but an officer — an officer , mind you , with armor on , and the bars of a steel helmet to blush behind and hide her embarrassment when she finds an army in front of her that she has n’t been introduced to . An officer ? Why , she ’ll be a captain ! A captain , I tell you , with a hundred men at her back — or maybe girls . Oh , no common - soldier business for her ! And , dear me , when she starts for that other army , you ’ll think there ’s a hurricane blowing it away ! ”
15242	15344	15232	15232	She	110	“ You make a great thing of it , but you mistake ; it was not a great matter . It was not as if I had been a stranger to the man . I know him , and have known him long ; and he knows me , and likes me . I have fed him through the bars of his cage many times ; and last December , when they chopped off two of his fingers to remind him to stop seizing and wounding people passing by , I dressed his hand every day till it was well again . ”
15345	15352	15354	15355	Little Mengette	138	“ That is all well enough , ”
15357	15390	15354	15355	Little Mengette	138	“ but he is a madman , dear , and so his likings and his gratitude and friendliness go for nothing when his rage is up . You did a perilous thing . ”
15391	15397	15399	15400	the Sunflower	151	“ Of course you did , ”

15415	15418	15354	15355	Little Mengette	138	“ Yes . ”
15419	15429	15354	15355	Little Mengette	138	“ Did n’t he threaten you more than once ? ”
15430	15433	15399	15400	the Sunflower	151	“ Yes . ”
15434	15441	15354	15355	Little Mengette	138	“ Did n’t you feel afraid ? ”
15442	15453	15354	15355	Little Mengette	138	“ No — at least not much — very little . ”
15454	15460	15461	15461	She	796	“ Why did n’t you ? ”
15472	15478	15461	15461	She	796	“ I do n’t know . ”
15517	15527	15513	15514	Cecile Letellier	156	“ Why did n’t you run when we did ? ”
15528	15557	15513	15514	Cecile Letellier	156	“ Because it was necessary to get him to his cage ; else he would kill some one . Then he would come to the like harm himself . ”
15756	15844	15749	15749	his	135	“ The fact is , I was taken by surprise . That is the reason . If I had had a moment to think , I would no more have thought of running that I would think of running from a baby . For , after all , what is Theophile Benoist , that I should seem to be afraid of him ? Pooh ! the idea of being afraid of that poor thing ! I only wish he would come along now — I’d show you ! ”
15845	15850	15852	15853	Pierre Morel	132	“ So do I ! ”
15855	15986	15852	15853	Pierre Morel	132	“ If I would n’t make him climb this tree quicker than — well , you ’d see what I would do ! Taking a person by surprise , that way — why , I never meant to run ; not in earnest , I mean . I never thought of running in earnest ; I only wanted to have some fun , and when I saw Joan standing there , and him threatening her , it was all I could do to restrain myself from going there and just tearing the livers and lights out of him . I wanted to do it bad enough , and if it was to do over again , I would ! If ever he comes fooling around me again , I ’ll — ”
15987	15992	15994	15995	the Paladin	157	“ Oh , hush ! ”
16005	16108	15994	15995	the Paladin	157	“ the way you people talk , a person would think there ’s something heroic about standing up and facing down that poor remnant of a man . Why , it ’s nothing ! There ’s small glory to be got in facing him down , I should say . Why , I would n’t want any better fun than to face down a hundred like him . If he was to come along here now , I would walk up to him just as I am now — I would n’t care if he had a thousand axes — and say — ”
16778	16786	16748	16748	he	819	“ Charles VI . and his dynasty , ”
16798	16816	16819	16819	he	819	“ God grant long life to Henry , King of France and England , our sovereign lord ! ”
16878	16889	16862	16862	she	110	“ I would I might see thy head struck from thy body!”—then
16897	16905	16862	16862	she	110	herself—“if it were the will of God . ”
17443	17481	17440	17440	Joan	110	“ Paying taxes with naught to pay them with is what the rest of France has been doing these many years , but we never knew the bitterness of that before . We shall know it now . ”
17869	17874	17876	17877	old Jacques	130	“ Ah , yes , ”
17880	17917	17876	17877	old Jacques	130	“ things are come to a pretty pass , indeed ! The King must be informed of this . It is time that he cease from idleness and dreaming , and get at his proper business . ”
17932	17937	17939	17940	the maire	653	“ You say well , ”
17942	17998	17939	17940	the maire	653	“ He should be informed , and that at once . It is an outrage that such things would be permitted . Why , we are not safe in our beds , and he taking his ease yonder . It shall be made known , indeed it shall — all France shall hear of it ! ”
18148	18237	18135	18136	the Paladin	157	“ Look at Dunois , Bastard of Orleans — call him a general ! Just put me in his place once — never mind what I would do , it is not for me to say , I have no stomach for talk , my way is to act and let others do the talking — but just put me in his place once , that ’s all ! And look at Saintrailles — pooh ! and that blustering La Hire , now what a general that is ! ”
18318	18411	18315	18315	she	110	“ I know not how any can be so hardy as to use such words regarding these sublime men , who are the very pillars of the French state , supporting it with their strength and preserving it at daily cost of their blood . As for me , I could count myself honored past all deserving if I might be allowed but the privilege of looking upon them once — at a distance , I mean , for it would not become one of my degree to approach them too near . ”
18457	18499	18454	18454	Jean	115	“ If you do n’t like what our generals do , why do n’t you go to the great wars yourself and better their work ? You are always talking about going to the wars , but you do n’t go . ”
18500	18504	18506	18507	the Paladin	157	“ Look you , ”
18509	18674	18506	18507	the Paladin	157	“ it is easy to say that . Now I will tell you why I remain chafing here in a bloodless tranquillity which my reputation teaches you is repulsive to my nature . I do not go because I am not a gentleman . That is the whole reason . What can one private soldier do in a contest like this ? Nothing . He is not permitted to rise from the ranks . If I were a gentleman would I remain here ? Not one moment . I can save France — ah , you may laugh , but I know what is in me , I know what is hid under this peasant cap . I can save France , and I stand ready to do it , but not under these present conditions . If they want me , let them send for me ; otherwise , let them take the consequences ; I shall not budge but as an officer . ”

18690	18711	18687	18687	Pierre	132	“ Since you sniff so at others , why do n’t you go to the wars yourself , Pierre d’Arc ? ”
18712	18760	18761	18761	They	896	“ Oh , I have n’t been sent for , either . I am no more a gentleman than you . Yet I will go ; I promise to go . I promise to go as a private under your orders — when you are sent for . ”
18772	18812	18766	18769	the Dragon - fly	897	“ So soon ? Then you need to begin to get ready ; you might be called for in five years — who knows ? Yes , in my opinion you ’ll march for the wars in five years . ”
18813	18819	18821	18821	Joan	110	“ He will go sooner , ”
18838	18847	18849	18852	the Dragon - fly	897	“ How do you know that , Joan ? ”
18867	18896	18860	18861	Jean d’Arc	115	“ I want to go myself , but as I am rather young yet , I also will wait , and march when the Paladin is sent for . ”
18897	18900	18902	18902	Joan	110	“ No , ”
18904	18911	18912	18912	She	110	“ he will go with Pierre . ”
19039	19109	19035	19036	Noel Rainguesson	135	“ There is one way to let France have a chance for her salvation . We ’ve got one gentleman in the commune , at any rate . Why ca n’t the Scholar change name and condition with the Paladin ? Then he can be an officer . France will send for him then , and he will sweep these English and Burgundian armies into the sea like flies . ”
19139	19183	19135	19136	the Sunflower	151	“ That is the very thing — it settles every difficulty . The Sieur de Conte will easily agree to that . Yes , he will march at the back of Captain Paladin and die early , covered with common - soldier glory . ”
19184	19201	19202	19202	Joan	110	“ He will march with Jean and Pierre , and live till these wars are forgotten , ”
19205	19226	19202	19202	Joan	110	“ and at the eleventh hour Noel and the Paladin will join these , but not of their own desire . ”
19260	19265	19266	19266	Noel	135	“ Come , now , ”
19269	19299	19266	19266	Noel	135	“ it ’s all arranged ; there ’s nothing to do but organize under the Paladin ’s banner and go forth and rescue France . You ’ll all join ? ”
19311	19470	19305	19305	Jacques	130	“ I ’ll ask you to excuse me . It is pleasant to talk war , and I am with you there , and I ’ve always thought I should go soldiering about this time , but the look of our wrecked village and that carved - up and bloody madman have taught me that I am not made for such work and such sights . I could never be at home in that trade . Face swords and the big guns and death ? It is n’t in me . No , no ; count me out . And besides , I ’m the eldest son , and deputy prop and protector of the family . Since you are going to carry Jean and Pierre to the wars , somebody must be left behind to take care of our Joan and her sister . I shall stay at home , and grow old in peace and tranquillity . ”
19471	19483	19485	19485	Joan	110	“ He will stay at home , but not grow old , ”
19575	19598	19559	19560	The Paladin	157	“ He shall give me a dukedom , name me premier peer , and make me Hereditary Lord High Constable of France . ”
19599	19618	19619	19620	The Paladin	157	“ And marry you to a princess — you’re not going to leave that out , are you ? ”
19630	19645	19619	19620	The Paladin	157	“ He may keep his princesses — I can marry more to my taste . ”
19832	19885	19829	19829	she	110	“ If the Dauphin , out of his grace and nobleness , should say to me , ‘ Now that I am rich and am come to my own again , choose and have , ’ I should kneel and ask him to give command that our village should nevermore be taxed . ”
20453	20513	20514	20514	I	0	“ Joan , I have been thinking the thing all over last night , and have concluded that we have been in the wrong all this time ; that the case of France is desperate ; that it has been desperate ever since Agincourt ; and that to - day it is more than desperate , it is hopeless . ”
20644	20660	20634	20634	she	110	“ The case of France hopeless ? Why should you think that ? Tell me . ”
20710	20922	20707	20707	I	0	“ Let us put sentiment and patriotic illusions aside , and look at the facts in the face . What do they say ? They speak as plainly as the figures in a merchant ’s account - book . One has only to add the two columns up to see that the French house is bankrupt , that one - half of its property is already in the English sheriff ’s hands and the other half in nobody’s — except those of irresponsible raiders and robbers confessing allegiance to nobody . Our King is shut up with his favorites and fools in inglorious idleness and poverty in a narrow little patch of the kingdom — a sort of back lot , as one may say — and has no authority there or anywhere else , has n’t a farthing to his name , nor a regiment of soldiers ; he is not fighting , he is not intending to fight , he means to make no further resistance ; in truth , there is but one thing that he is intending to do — give the whole thing up , pitch his crown into the sewer , and run away to Scotland . There are the facts . Are they correct ? ”
20923	20930	21098	21098	she	935	“ Yes , they are correct . ”
20931	20955	20956	20956	She	935	“ Then it is as I have said : one needs but to add them together in order to realize what they mean . ”
20966	20977	20956	20956	She	935	“ What — that the case of France is hopeless ? ”
20978	20993	21098	21098	she	935	“ Necessarily . In face of these facts , doubt of it is impossible . ”
20994	21008	21098	21098	she	935	“ How can you say that ? How can you feel like that ? ”
21009	21051	20956	20956	She	935	“ How can I ? How could I think or feel in any other way , in the circumstances ? Joan , with these fatal figures before , you , have you really any hope for France — really and actually ? ”
21052	21075	21098	21098	she	935	“ Hope — oh , more than that ! France will win her freedom and keep it . Do not doubt it . ”
21124	21189	21121	21121	I	0	“ Joan , your heart , which worships France , is beguiling your head . You are not perceiving the importance of these figures . Here — I want to make a picture of them , here on the ground with a stick . Now , this rough outline is France . Through its middle , east and west , I draw a river . ”
21190	21196	21098	21098	she	935	“ Yes , the Loire . ”
21197	21218	21306	21306	Her	937	“ Now , then , this whole northern half of the country is in the tight grip of the English . ”
21219	21222	21121	21121	I	0	“ Yes . ”
21223	21305	21306	21306	Her	937	“ And this whole southern half is really in nobody ’s hands at all — as our King confesses by meditating desertion and flight to a foreign land . England has armies here ; opposition is dead ; she can assume full possession whenever she may choose . In very truth , all France is gone , France is already lost , France has ceased to exist . What was France is now but a British province . Is this true ? ”
21320	21327	21306	21306	Her	937	“ Yes , it is true . ”
21328	21430	21306	21306	Her	937	“ Very well . Now add this clinching fact , and surely the sum is complete : When have French soldiers won a victory ? Scotch soldiers , under the French flag , have won a barren fight or two a few years back , but I am speaking of French ones . Since eight thousand Englishmen nearly annihilated sixty thousand Frenchmen a dozen years ago at Agincourt , French courage has been paralyzed . And so it is a common saying to - day that if you confront fifty French soldiers with five English ones , the French will run . ”
21431	21444	21306	21306	Her	937	“ It is a pity , but even these things are true . ”
21445	21455	21306	21306	Her	937	“ Then certainly the day for hoping is past . ”
21516	21526	21506	21506	She	937	“ France will rise again . You shall see . ”
21527	21538	21513	21513	her	937	“ Rise?—with this burden of English armies on her back ! ”
21539	21553	21513	21513	her	937	“ She will cast it off ; she will trample it under foot ! ”
21558	21565	21506	21506	She	937	“ Without soldiers to fight with ? ”
21566	21582	21513	21513	her	937	“ The drums will summon them . They will answer , and they will march . ”
21583	21592	21513	21513	her	937	“ March to the rear , as usual ? ”
21593	21614	21513	21513	her	937	“ No ; to the front — ever to the front — always to the front ! You shall see . ”
21615	21621	21513	21513	her	937	“ And the pauper King ? ”
21622	21635	21513	21513	her	937	“ He will mount his throne — he will wear his crown . ”
21636	21683	21513	21513	her	937	“ Well , of a truth this makes one ’s head dizzy . Why , if I could believe that in thirty years from now the English domination would be broken and the French monarch ’s head find itself hooped with a real crown of sovereignty — ”
21684	21695	21513	21513	her	937	“ Both will have happened before two years are sped . ”
21696	21710	21513	21513	her	937	“ Indeed ? and who is going to perform all these sublime impossibilities ? ”
21711	21714	21513	21513	her	937	“ God . ”
22685	22790	22682	22682	her	110	“ But I am so young ! oh , so young to leave my mother and my home and go out into the strange world to undertake a thing so great ! Ah , how can I talk with men , be comrade with men?—soldiers ! It would give me over to insult , and rude usage , and contempt . How can I go to the great wars , and lead armies?—I a girl , and ignorant of such things , knowing nothing of arms , nor how to mount a horse , nor ride it .... Yet — if it is commanded — ”
23174	23220	23166	23166	I	0	“ Ah , Joan , I ’ve got such a wonderful thing to tell you about ! You would never imagine it . I ’ve had a dream , and in the dream I saw you right here where you are standing now , and — ”
23230	23237	23222	23222	she	110	“ It was not a dream . ”
23252	23257	23258	23258	I	0	“ Not a dream ? ”
23261	23271	23258	23258	I	0	“ how can you know about it , Joan ? ”
23272	23278	23222	23222	she	110	“ Are you dreaming now ? ”
23279	23292	23258	23258	I	0	“ I — I suppose not . I think I am not . ”
23293	23319	23320	23320	I	0	“ Indeed you are not . I know you are not . And you were not dreaming when you cut the mark in the tree . ”
23397	23428	23391	23391	Joan	110	“ Do not be afraid ; indeed there is no need . Come with me . We will sit by the spring and I will tell you all my secret . ”
23442	23469	23436	23436	I	0	“ First tell me this . You could not see me in the wood ; how did you know I cut a mark in the tree ? ”
23470	23487	23436	23436	I	0	“ Wait a little ; I will soon come to that ; then you will see . ”
23488	23505	23436	23436	I	0	“ But tell me one thing now ; what was that awful shadow that I saw ? ”
23506	23544	23436	23436	I	0	“ I will tell you , but do not be disturbed ; you are not in danger . It was the shadow of an archangel — Michael , the chief and lord of the armies of heaven . ”
23561	23581	23436	23436	I	0	“ You were not afraid , Joan ? Did you see his face — did you see his form ? ”
23582	23605	23436	23436	I	0	“ Yes ; I was not afraid , because this was not the first time . I was afraid the first time . ”
23606	23613	23436	23436	I	0	“ When was that , Joan ? ”
23614	23623	23436	23436	I	0	“ It is nearly three years ago now . ”
23624	23635	23436	23436	I	0	“ So long ? Have you seen him many times ? ”
23636	23642	23436	23436	I	0	“ Yes , many times . ”
23643	23683	23436	23436	I	0	“ It is this , then , that has changed you ; it was this that made you thoughtful and not as you were before . I see it now . Why did you not tell us about it ? ”
23684	23719	23436	23436	I	0	“ It was not permitted . It is permitted now , and soon I shall tell all . But only you , now . It must remain a secret for a few days still . ”
23720	23731	23436	23436	I	0	“ Has none seen that white shadow before but me ? ”
23732	23779	23436	23436	I	0	“ No one . It has fallen upon me before when you and others were present , but none could see it . To - day it has been otherwise , and I was told why ; but it will not be visible again to any . ”
23780	23800	23436	23436	I	0	“ It was a sign to me , then — and a sign with a meaning of some kind ? ”
23801	23812	23436	23436	I	0	“ Yes , but I may not speak of that . ”
23813	23834	23436	23436	I	0	“ Strange — that that dazzling light could rest upon an object before one ’s eyes and not be visible . ”
23835	23888	23436	23436	I	0	“ With it comes speech , also . Several saints come , attended by myriads of angels , and they speak to me ; I hear their voices , but others do not . They are very dear to me — my Voices ; that is what I call them to myself . ”
23889	23898	23436	23436	I	0	“ Joan , what do they tell you ? ”
23899	23911	23436	23436	I	0	“ All manner of things — about France , I mean . ”
23912	23923	23924	23924	She	963	“ What things have they been used to tell you ? ”
23930	23949	23924	23924	She	963	“ Disasters — only disasters , and misfortunes , and humiliation . There was naught else to foretell . ”
23950	23959	23436	23436	I	0	“ They spoke of them to you beforehand ? ”
23960	24036	24038	24038	she	963	“ Yes . So that I knew what was going to happen before it happened . It made me grave — as you saw . It could not be otherwise . But always there was a word of hope , too . More than that : France was to be rescued , and made great and free again . But how and by whom — that was not told . Not until to - day . ”
24092	24160	24161	24161	I	0	“ But to - day I know . God has chosen the meanest of His creatures for this work ; and by His command , and in His protection , and by His strength , not mine , I am to lead His armies , and win back France , and set the crown upon the head of His servant that is Dauphin and shall be King . ”
24168	24181	24161	24161	I	0	“ You , Joan ? You , a child , lead armies ? ”
24182	24350	24161	24161	I	0	“ Yes . For one little moment or two the thought crushed me ; for it is as you say — I am only a child ; a child and ignorant — ignorant of everything that pertains to war , and not fitted for the rough life of camps and the companionship of soldiers . But those weak moments passed ; they will not come again . I am enlisted , I will not turn back , God helping me , till the English grip is loosed from the throat of France . My Voices have never told me lies , they have not lied to - day . They say I am to go to Robert de Baudricourt , governor of Vaucouleurs , and he will give me men - at - arms for escort and send me to the King . A year from now a blow will be struck which will be the beginning of the end , and the end will follow swiftly . ”
24351	24358	24509	24509	I	0	“ Where will it be struck ? ”
24359	24463	24161	24161	I	0	“ My Voices have not said ; nor what will happen this present year , before it is struck . It is appointed me to strike it , that is all I know ; and follow it with others , sharp and swift , undoing in ten weeks England ’s long years of costly labor , and setting the crown upon the Dauphin ’s head — for such is God ’s will ; my Voices have said it , and shall I doubt it ? No ; it will be as they have said , for they say only that which is true . ”
24512	24557	24509	24509	I	0	“ Joan , I believe the things which you have said , and now I am glad that I am to march with you to the great wars — that is , if it is with you I am to march when I go . ”
24565	24588	24558	24558	She	964	“ It is true that you will be with me when I go to the wars , but how did you know ? ”
24589	24608	24558	24558	She	964	“ I shall march with you , and so also will Jean and Pierre , but not Jacques . ”
24609	24657	24658	24658	I	0	“ All true — it is so ordered , as was revealed to me lately , but I did not know until to - day that the marching would be with me , or that I should march at all . How did you know these things ? ”
24924	25058	24919	24919	she	110	“ I leave before dawn . No one will know it but you . I go to speak with the governor of Vaucouleurs as commanded , who will despise me and treat me rudely , and perhaps refuse my prayer at this time . I go first to Burey , to persuade my uncle Laxart to go with me , it not being meet that I go alone . I may need you in Vaucouleurs ; for if the governor will not receive me I will dictate a letter to him , and so must have some one by me who knows the art of how to write and spell the words . You will go from here to - morrow in the afternoon , and remain in Vaucouleurs until I need you . ”
25658	25664	25646	25647	a servant	994	“ Would talk with me ? ”
25665	25671	25646	25647	a servant	994	“ Yes , your Excellency . ”
25672	25685	25646	25647	a servant	994	“ H’m ! A strange idea , certainly . Bring them in . ”
25796	25808	25793	25793	him	2647	“ By God ’s grace , it is a beautiful creature ! ”
25821	25832	25809	25809	He	2647	“ Well , what is your errand , my child ? ”
25833	25879	25809	25809	He	2647	“ My message is to you , Robert de Baudricourt , governor of Vaucouleurs , and it is this : that you will send and tell the Dauphin to wait and not give battle to his enemies , for God will presently send him help . ”
25891	25899	25888	25888	many	1002	“ The poor young thing is demented . ”
25907	25954	25900	25901	The governor	2647	“ What nonsense is this ? The King — or the Dauphin , as you call him — needs no message of that sort . He will wait , give yourself no uneasiness as to that . What further do you desire to say to me ? ”
25955	25980	25809	25809	He	2647	“ This . To beg that you will give me an escort of men - at - arms and send me to the Dauphin . ”
25981	25985	25809	25809	He	2647	“ What for ? ”
25986	26017	25900	25901	The governor	2647	“ That he may make me his general , for it is appointed that I shall drive the English out of France , and set the crown upon his head . ”
26018	26031	25809	25809	He	2647	“ What — you ? Why , you are but a child ! ”
26032	26043	25809	25809	He	2647	“ Yet am I appointed to do it , nevertheless . ”
26044	26054	25900	25901	The governor	2647	“ Indeed ! And when will all this happen ? ”
26055	26072	25809	25809	He	2647	“ Next year he will be crowned , and after that will remain master of France . ”
26092	26102	26088	26089	the governor	2647	“ Who has sent you with these extravagant messages ? ”
26103	26107	25900	25901	The governor	2647	“ My Lord . ”
26108	26112	25900	25901	The governor	2647	“ What Lord ? ”
26113	26119	26120	26120	Many	166	“ The King of Heaven . ”
26123	26132	26120	26120	Many	166	“ Ah , poor thing , poor thing ! ”
26136	26146	26147	26148	The governor	2647	“ Ah , her mind is but a wreck ! ”
26155	26175	26147	26148	The governor	2647	“ Harkye!—take this mad child home and whip her soundly . That is the best cure for her ailment . ”
26189	26243	26181	26181	she	110	“ You refuse me the soldiers , I know not why , for it is my Lord that has commanded you . Yes , it is He that has made the command ; therefore I must come again , and yet again ; then I shall have the men - at - arms . ”
27011	27016	27009	27009	her	110	“ this marvelous child . ”
27162	27197	27150	27150	Joan	110	“ The time is come . My Voices are not vague now , but clear , and they have told me what to do . In two months I shall be with the Dauphin . ”
27241	27246	27247	27247	I	0	“ I believe it , ”
27250	27256	27258	27258	Laxart	164	“ I also believe it , ”
27260	27369	27258	27258	Laxart	164	“ If she had told me before , that she was commanded of God to rescue France , I should not have believed ; I should have let her seek the governor by her own ways and held myself clear of meddling in the matter , not doubting she was mad . But I have seen her stand before those nobles and mighty men unafraid , and say her say ; and she had not been able to do that but by the help of God . That I know . Therefore with all humbleness I am at her command , to do with me as she will . ”
27370	27379	27380	27380	Joan	110	“ My uncle is very good to me , ”
27383	27464	27380	27380	Joan	110	“ I sent and asked him to come and persuade my mother to let him take me home with him to tend his wife , who is not well . It is arranged , and we go at dawn to - morrow . From his house I shall go soon to Vaucouleurs , and wait and strive until my prayer is granted . Who were the two cavaliers who sat to your left at the governor ’s table that day ? ”
27465	27484	27258	27258	Laxart	164	“ One was the Sieur Jean de Novelonpont de Metz , the other the Sieur Bertrand de Poulengy . ”
27485	27513	27514	27514	I	0	“ Good metal — good metal , both . I marked them for men of mine .... What is it I see in your face ? Doubt ? ”
27536	27570	27533	27533	I	0	“ They considered you out of your head , and said so . It is true they pitied you for being in such misfortune , but still they held you to be mad . ”
27589	27630	27585	27585	She	1043	“ The wise change their minds when they perceive that they have been in error . These will . They will march with me . I shall see them presently .... You seem to doubt again ? Do you doubt ? ”
27631	27668	27780	27780	She	1044	“ N - no . Not now . I was remembering that it was a year ago , and that they did not belong here , but only chanced to stop a day on their journey . ”
27669	27712	27795	27795	she	1044	“ They will come again . But as to matters now in hand ; I came to leave with you some instructions . You will follow me in a few days . Order your affairs , for you will be absent long . ”
27713	27722	27795	27795	she	1044	“ Will Jean and Pierre go with me ? ”
27723	27779	27780	27780	She	1044	“ No ; they would refuse now , but presently they will come , and with them they will bring my parents ’ blessing , and likewise their consent that I take up my mission . I shall be stronger , then — stronger for that ; for lack of it I am weak now . ”
27799	27829	27795	27795	she	1044	“ I would say good - by to Little Mengette . Bring her outside the village at dawn ; she must go with me a little of the way — ”
27830	27834	27835	27835	She	1044	“ And Haumette ? ”
27845	27875	27835	27835	She	1044	“ No , oh , no — she is too dear to me , I could not bear it , knowing I should never look upon her face again . ”
28465	28486	28463	28463	itself	1	“ Was this world - wonder in our familiar midst all these years and we too dull to see it ? ”
28641	28684	28638	28638	She	110	“ I must still come to you until I get the men - at - arms ; for so it is commanded , and I may not disobey . I must go to the Dauphin , though I go on my knees . ”
28741	28768	28721	28721	He	2647	“ What are you doing here , my little maid ? Will they drive the King out of France , and shall we all turn English ? ”
28779	28804	28773	28773	her	110	“ I am come to bid Robert de Baudricourt take or send me to the King , but he does not heed my words . ”
28805	28835	28836	28836	Joan	110	“ Ah , you have an admirable persistence , truly ; a whole year has not turned you from your wish . I saw you when you came before . ”
28844	28865	28836	28836	Joan	110	“ It is not a wish , it is a purpose . He will grant it . I can wait . ”
28866	28903	28836	28836	Joan	110	“ Ah , perhaps it will not be wise to make too sure of that , my child . These governors are stubborn people to deal with . In case he shall not grant your prayer — ”
28904	28921	28922	28923	The gentleman	1093	“ He will grant it . He must . It is not a matter of choice . ”
29028	29044	29022	29022	he	1093	“ Is it necessary that you go to the King soon?—that is , I mean — ”
29045	29062	29063	29063	She	110	“ Before Mid - Lent , even though I wear away my legs to the knees ! ”
29116	29154	29110	29110	He	1093	“ God knows I think you should have the men - at - arms , and that somewhat would come of it . What is it that you would do ? What is your hope and purpose ? ”
29155	29204	29110	29110	He	1093	“ To rescue France . And it is appointed that I shall do it . For no one else in the world , neither kings , nor dukes , no any other , can recover the kingdom of France , and there is no help but in me . ”
29236	29271	29228	29228	her	110	“ But indeed I would rather spin with my poor mother , for this is not my calling ; but I must go and do it , for it is my Lord ’s will . ”
29272	29278	29228	29228	her	110	“ Who is your Lord ? ”
29279	29284	29228	29228	her	110	“ He is God . ”
29636	29690	29628	29628	Joan	110	“ In God ’s name , Robert de Baudricourt , you are too slow about sending me , and have caused damage thereby , for this day the Dauphin ’s cause has lost a battle near Orleans , and will suffer yet greater injury if you do not send me to him soon . ”
29702	29740	29691	29692	The governor	2647	“ To - day , child , to - day ? How can you know what has happened in that region to - day ? It would take eight or ten days for the word to come . ”
29741	29774	29775	29776	The governor	2647	“ My Voices have brought the word to me , and it is true . A battle was lost to - day , and you are in fault to delay me so . ”
29802	29838	29799	29799	he	2647	“ Harkye ! go in peace , and wait . If it shall turn out as you say , I will give you the letter and send you to the King , and not otherwise . ”
29844	29867	29839	29839	Joan	110	“ Now God be thanked , these waiting days are almost done . In nine days you will fetch me the letter . ”
30327	30383	30324	30324	she	110	“ Nothing remains , now , but that I confide to you the date of our departure , so that you may make all needful preparation in time , leaving nothing to be done in haste and badly at the last moment . We march the 23d , at eleven of the clock at night . ”
30406	30469	30401	30403	the Sieur Bertrand	168	“ Even if the governor shall really furnish the letter and the escort , he still may not do it in time to meet the date she has chosen . Then how can she venture to name that date ? It is a great risk — a great risk to select and decide upon the date , in this state of uncertainty . ”
30473	30502	30470	30470	I	0	“ Since she has named the 23d , we may trust her . The Voices have told her , I think . We shall do best to obey . ”
30593	30618	30585	30585	she	110	“ It was to be so , no doubt ; no doubt it was so ordered ; I must bear it , and will . ”
30628	30648	30619	30620	De Metz	175	“ The governor sends no word ; it may be that they will come to - morrow , and — ”
30661	30675	30655	30655	she	110	“ To what good end ? We start at eleven to - night . ”
30734	30768	30714	30714	he	2647	“ You said true , child . The battle was lost , on the day you said . So I have kept my word . Now go — come of it what may . ”
31452	31488	31489	31489	He	157	“ Now , where have you dropped down from ? And how did you happen to light in this place ? And what do the soldier - clothes mean ? Tell me all about it . ”
31492	31500	31489	31489	He	157	“ I marched with you last night . ”
31501	31504	31507	31507	myself	0	“ No ! ”
31511	31526	31507	31507	myself	0	“ The prophecy has not all failed — half of it has come true . ”
31528	31600	31601	31601	I	0	“ Yes , I did . I hurried up from Domremy to join , and was within a half a minute of being too late . In fact , I was too late , but I begged so hard that the governor was touched by my brave devotion to my country ’s cause — those are the words he used — and so he yielded , and allowed me to come . ”
31656	31681	31652	31652	I	0	“ I am glad you came ; it is a noble cause , and one should not sit at home in times like these . ”
31682	31708	31652	31652	I	0	“ Sit at home ! I could no more do it than the thunderstone could stay hid in the clouds when the storm calls it . ”
31709	31721	31652	31652	I	0	“ That is the right talk . It sounds like you . ”
31726	31758	31652	31652	I	0	“ I ’m glad you know me . Some do n’t . But they will , presently . They will know me well enough before I get done with this war . ”
31759	31779	31780	31780	He	157	“ That is what I think . I believe that wherever danger confronts you you will make yourself conspicuous . ”
31799	31828	31796	31796	He	157	“ If I know myself — and I think I do — my performances in this campaign will give you occasion more than once to remember those words . ”
31829	31842	31652	31652	I	0	“ I were a fool to doubt it . That I know . ”
31843	31960	31652	31652	I	0	“ I shall not be at my best , being but a common soldier ; still , the country will hear of me . If I were where I belong ; if I were in the place of La Hire , or Saintrailles , or the Bastard of Orleans — well , I say nothing . I am not of the talking kind , like Noel Rainguesson and his sort , I thank God . But it will be something , I take it — a novelty in this world , I should say — to raise the fame of a private soldier above theirs , and extinguish the glory of their names with its shadow . ”
31961	31970	31971	31971	I	0	“ Why , look here , my friend , ”
31974	32086	31971	31971	I	0	“ do you know that you have hit out a most remarkable idea there ? Do you realize the gigantic proportions of it ? For look you ; to be a general of vast renown , what is that ? Nothing — history is clogged and confused with them ; one can not keep their names in his memory , there are so many . But a common soldier of supreme renown — why , he would stand alone ! He would the be one moon in a firmament of mustard - seed stars ; his name would outlast the human race ! My friend , who gave you that idea ? ”
32122	32149	32107	32107	He	1180	“ It is nothing . I have them often — ideas like that — and even greater ones . I do not consider this one much . ”
32150	32167	32183	32183	his	1180	“ You astonish me ; you do , indeed . So it is really your own ? ”
32168	32179	32107	32107	He	1180	“ Quite . And there is plenty more where it came from”—tapping
32211	32224	32183	32183	his	1180	air—“I do not need to borrow my ideas , like Noel Rainguesson . ”
32225	32237	32183	32183	his	1180	“ Speaking of Noel , when did you see him last ? ”
32238	32258	32259	32259	I	0	“ Half an hour ago . He is sleeping yonder like a corpse . Rode with us last night . ”
32294	32327	32290	32290	I	0	“ It gives me joy . It makes me proud of our village . There is not keeping our lion - hearts at home in these great times , I see that . ”
32328	32371	32183	32183	his	1180	“ Lion - heart ! Who — that baby ? Why , he begged like a dog to be let off . Cried , and said he wanted to go to his mother . Him a lion - heart!—that tumble - bug ! ”
32372	32389	32290	32290	I	0	“ Dear me , why I supposed he volunteered , of course . Did n’t he ? ”
32390	32551	32290	32290	I	0	“ Oh , yes , he volunteered the way people do to the headsman . Why , when he found I was coming up from Domremy to volunteer , he asked me to let him come along in my protection , and see the crowds and the excitement . Well , we arrived and saw the torches filing out at the Castle , and ran there , and the governor had him seized , along with four more , and he begged to be let off , and I begged for his place , and at last the governor allowed me to join , but would n’t let Noel off , because he was disgusted with him , he was such a cry - baby . Yes , and much good he ’ll do the King ’s service ; he ’ll eat for six and run for sixteen . I hate a pygmy with half a heart and nine stomachs ! ”
32552	32582	32183	32183	his	1180	“ Why , this is very surprising news to me , and I am sorry and disappointed to hear it . I thought he was a very manly fellow . ”
32594	32820	32583	32584	The Paladin	157	“ I do n’t see how you can talk like that , I ’m sure I do n’t . I do n’t see how you could have got such a notion . I do n’t dislike him , and I ’m not saying these things out of prejudice , for I do n’t allow myself to have prejudices against people . I like him , and have always comraded with him from the cradle , but he must allow me to speak my mind about his faults , and I am willing he shall speak his about mine , if I have any . And , true enough , maybe I have ; but I reckon they ’ll bear inspection — I have that idea , anyway . A manly fellow ! You should have heard him whine and wail and swear , last night , because the saddle hurt him . Why did n’t the saddle hurt me ? Pooh — I was as much at home in it as if I had been born there . And yet it was the first time I was ever on a horse . All those old soldiers admired my riding ; they said they had never seen anything like it . But him — why , they had to hold him on , all the time . ”
33134	33147	33124	33124	I	0	“ It was fine and brave of you to volunteer , Noel . ”
33156	33182	33153	33153	he	135	“ Yes , it was rather fine , I think . Still , the credit does n’t all belong to me ; I had help . ”
33183	33188	33124	33124	I	0	“ Who helped you ? ”
33189	33193	33124	33124	I	0	“ The governor . ”
33194	33197	33153	33153	he	135	“ How ? ”
33198	33345	33124	33124	I	0	“ Well , I ’ll tell you the whole thing . I came up from Domremy to see the crowds and the general show , for I had n’t ever had any experience of such things , of course , and this was a great opportunity ; but I had n’t any mind to volunteer . I overtook the Paladin on the road and let him have my company the rest of the way , although he did not want it and said so ; and while we were gawking and blinking in the glare of the governor ’s torches they seized us and four more and added us to the escort , and that is really how I came to volunteer . But , after all , I was n’t sorry , remembering how dull life would have been in the village without the Paladin . ”
33346	33358	33124	33124	I	0	“ How did he feel about it ? Was he satisfied ? ”
33359	33366	33124	33124	I	0	“ I think he was glad . ”
33367	33370	33124	33124	I	0	“ Why ? ”
33371	33492	33124	33124	I	0	“ Because he said he was n’t . He was taken by surprise , you see , and it is not likely that he could tell the truth without preparation . Not that he would have prepared , if he had had the chance , for I do not think he would . I am not charging him with that . In the same space of time that he could prepare to speak the truth , he could also prepare to lie ; besides , his judgment would be cool then , and would warn him against fooling with new methods in an emergency . No , I am sure he was glad , because he said he was n’t . ”
33493	33502	33124	33124	I	0	“ Do you think he was very glad ? ”
33503	33648	33124	33124	I	0	“ Yes , I know he was . He begged like a slave , and bawled for his mother . He said his health was delicate , and he did n’t know how to ride a horse , and he knew he could n’t outlive the first march . But really he was n’t looking as delicate as he was feeling . There was a cask of wine there , a proper lift for four men . The governor ’s temper got afire , and he delivered an oath at him that knocked up the dust where it struck the ground , and told him to shoulder that cask or he would carve him to cutlets and send him home in a basket . The Paladin did it , and that secured his promotion to a privacy in the escort without any further debate . ”
33649	33688	33124	33124	I	0	“ Yes , you seem to make it quite plain that he was glad to join — that is , if your premises are right that you start from . How did he stand the march last night ? ”
33689	33744	33124	33124	I	0	“ About as I did . If he made the more noise , it was the privilege of his bulk . We stayed in our saddles because we had help . We are equally lame to - day , and if he likes to sit down , let him ; I prefer to stand . ”
34521	34566	34518	34518	She	110	“ Neither these men nor any others can take my life before my mission is accomplished , therefore why should I have their blood upon my hands ? I will inform them of this , and also admonish them . Call them before me . ”
34675	34696	34670	34670	Joan	110	“ It is a pity that you should plot another ’s death when your own is so close at hand . ”
35044	35047	35048	35048	We	1234	“ Halt ! ”
35090	35118	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ Well , you have taken your time , truly . And what have you found out ? Is she still behind us , or in front ? ”
35126	35132	35119	35119	Joan	110	“ She is still behind . ”
35144	35172	35141	35141	He	2329	“ If you know that to be true , you have not lost your time , Captain . But are you sure ? How do you know ? ”
35173	35180	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ Because I have seen her . ”
35181	35190	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ Seen her ! Seen the Virgin herself ? ”
35191	35201	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ Yes , I have been in her camp . ”
35202	35238	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ Is it possible ! Captain Raymond , I ask you to pardon me for speaking in that tone just now . You have performed a daring and admirable service . Where was she camped ? ”
35239	35252	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ In the forest , not more than a league from here . ”
35253	35312	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ Good ! I was afraid we might be still behind her , but now that we know she is behind us , everything is safe . She is our game . We will hang her . You shall hang her yourself . No one has so well earned the privilege of abolishing this pestilent limb of Satan . ”
35313	35331	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ I do not know how to thank you sufficiently . If we catch her , I — ”
35332	35389	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ If ! I will take care of that ; give yourself no uneasiness . All I want is just a look at her , to see what the imp is like that has been able to make all this noise , then you and the halter may have her . How many men has she ? ”
35390	35407	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ I counted but eighteen , but she may have had two or three pickets out . ”
35408	35433	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ Is that all ? It wo n’t be a mouthful for my force . Is it true that she is only a girl ? ”
35434	35444	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ Yes ; she is not more than seventeen . ”
35445	35457	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ It passes belief ! Is she robust , or slender ? ”
35458	35461	35462	35463	The officer	1251	“ Slender . ”
35474	35482	35471	35471	he	1251	“ Was she preparing to break camp ? ”
35483	35494	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ Not when I had my last glimpse of her . ”
35495	35501	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ What was she doing ? ”
35502	35511	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ She was talking quietly with an officer . ”
35512	35519	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ Quietly ? Not giving orders ? ”
35520	35531	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ No , talking as quietly as we are now . ”
35532	35575	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ That is good . She is feeling a false security . She would have been restless and fussy else — it is the way of her sex when danger is about . As she was making no preparation to break camp — ”
35576	35587	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ She certainly was not when I saw her last . ”
35588	35659	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ — and was chatting quietly and at her ease , it means that this weather is not to her taste . Night - marching in sleet and wind is not for chits of seventeen . No ; she will stay where she is . She has my thanks . We will camp , ourselves ; here is as good a place as any . Let us get about it . ”
35660	35690	35076	35077	A man	2329	“ If you command it — certainly . But she has two knights with her . They might force her to march , particularly if the weather should improve . ”
35745	35759	35741	35742	The officer	1251	“ Well , in that case we are here to block the way . ”
35760	35804	35741	35742	The officer	1251	“ Yes , if they come this way . But if they should send out spies , and find out enough to make them want to try for the bridge through the woods ? Is it best to allow the bridge to stand ? ”
35821	35854	35813	35814	The officer	1251	“ It might be well enough to send a force to destroy the bridge . I was intending to occupy it with the whole command , but that is not necessary now . ”
35860	35873	35855	35855	Joan	110	“ With your permission , I will go and destroy it myself . ”
35914	35950	35910	35911	The officer	1251	“ You have it , Captain , and my thanks . With you to do it , it will be well done ; I could send another in your place , but not a better . ”
36021	36024	36013	36013	Joan	110	“ Forward ! ”
36070	36073	36064	36065	the enemy	2442	“ Dismount ! ”
36400	36465	36397	36397	Joan	110	“ It will be as you say , no doubt ; for the commander took a troop for granted , in the night and unchallenged , and would have camped without sending a force to destroy the bridge if he had been left unadvised , and none are so ready to find fault with others as those who do things worthy of blame themselves . ”
36541	36593	36538	36538	she	110	“ I thought he was deceiving himself . I forbore to tell him lies , for that would have been wrong ; but if my truths deceived him , perhaps that made them lies , and I am to blame . I would God I knew if I have done wrong . ”
36663	36703	36660	36660	Jean	167	“ Joan , you told us yourself that you were going to Uncle Laxart ’s to nurse his wife , but you did n’t say you were going further , yet you did go on to Vaucouleurs . There ! ”
36704	36709	36711	36711	Joan	110	“ I see now , ”
36715	36764	36765	36765	She	110	“ I told no lie , yet I deceived . I had tried all other ways first , but I could not get away , and I had to get away . My mission required it . I did wrong , I think , and am to blame . ”
36787	36802	36780	36780	she	110	“ But the thing itself was right , and I would do it again . ”
37480	37495	37476	37477	Noel Rainguesson	135	“ I think it is wonderful , the way he has brought us through . ”
37496	37499	37501	37501	Jean	167	“ Who ? ”
37503	37509	37510	37511	The Paladin	157	“ Why , the Paladin . ”
37517	37526	37528	37528	Pierre	132	“ What had he to do with it ? ”
37531	37613	37528	37528	Pierre	132	“ Everything . It was nothing but Joan ’s confidence in his discretion that enabled her to keep up her heart . She could depend on us and on herself for valor , but discretion is the winning thing in war , after all ; discretion is the rarest and loftiest of qualities , and he has got more of it than any other man in France — more of it , perhaps , than any other sixty men in France . ”
37614	37630	37632	37633	the Paladin	157	“ Now you are getting ready to make a fool of yourself , Noel Rainguesson , ”
37635	37673	37632	37633	the Paladin	157	“ and you want to coil some of that long tongue of yours around your neck and stick the end of it in your ear , then you ’ll be the less likely to get into trouble . ”
37674	37687	37689	37689	Pierre	132	“ I did n’t know he had more discretion than other people , ”
37691	37714	37689	37689	Pierre	132	“ for discretion argues brains , and he has n’t any more brains than the rest of us , in my opinion . ”
37715	37804	37632	37633	the Paladin	157	“ No , you are wrong there . Discretion has n’t anything to do with brains ; brains are an obstruction to it , for it does not reason , it feels . Perfect discretion means absence of brains . Discretion is a quality of the heart — solely a quality of the heart ; it acts upon us through feeling . We know this because if it were an intellectual quality it would only perceive a danger , for instance , where a danger exists ; whereas — ”
37805	37814	37816	37817	the Paladin	157	“ Hear him twaddle — the damned idiot ! ”
37819	37893	37816	37817	the Paladin	157	“ — whereas , it being purely a quality of the heart , and proceeding by feeling , not reason , its reach is correspondingly wider and sublimer , enabling it to perceive and avoid dangers that have n’t any existence at all ; as , for instance , that night in the fog , when the Paladin took his horse ’s ears for hostile lances and got off and climbed a tree — ”
37894	37993	37632	37633	the Paladin	157	“ It ’s a lie ! a lie without shadow of foundation , and I call upon you all to beware you give credence to the malicious inventions of this ramshackle slander - mill that has been doing its best to destroy my character for years , and will grind up your own reputations for you next . I got off to tighten my saddle - girth — I wish I may die in my tracks if it is n’t so — and whoever wants to believe it can , and whoever do n’t can let it alone . ”
37994	38089	37632	37633	the Paladin	157	“ There , that is the way with him , you see ; he never can discuss a theme temperately , but always flies off the handle and becomes disagreeable . And you notice his defect of memory . He remembers getting off his horse , but forgets all the rest , even the tree . But that is natural ; he would remember getting off the horse because he was so used to doing it . He always did it when there was an alarm and the clash of arms at the front . ”
38090	38100	38102	38102	Jean	167	“ Why did he choose that time for it ? ”
38104	38138	38102	38102	Jean	167	“ I do n’t know . To tighten up his girth , he thinks , to climb a tree , I think ; I saw him climb nine trees in a single night . ”
38139	38177	38320	38320	he	132	“ You saw nothing of the kind ! A person that can lie like that deserves no one ’s respect . I ask you all to answer me . Do you believe what this reptile has said ? ”
38192	38269	38187	38187	He	132	“ I — well , I hardly know what to say . It is a delicate situation . It seems offensive to me to refuse to believe a person when he makes so direct a statement , and yet I am obliged to say , rude as it may appear , that I am not able to believe the whole of it — no , I am not able to believe that you climbed nine trees . ”
38270	38273	38275	38276	the Paladin	157	“ There ! ”
38278	38300	38275	38276	the Paladin	157	“ now what do you think of yourself , Noel Rainguesson ? How many do you believe I climbed , Pierre ? ”
38301	38305	38320	38320	he	132	“ Only eight . ”
38323	38346	38320	38320	he	132	“ I bide my time — I bide my time . I will reckon with you all , I promise you that ! ”
38347	38354	38355	38355	Noel	135	“ Do n’t get him started , ”
38358	38403	38355	38355	Noel	135	“ he is a perfect lion when he gets started . I saw enough to teach me that , after the third skirmish . After it was over I saw him come out of the bushes and attack a dead man single - handed . ”
38404	38437	38320	38320	he	132	“ It is another lie ; and I give you fair warning that you are going too far . You will see me attack a live one if you are not careful . ”
38438	38467	38320	38320	he	132	“ Meaning me , of course . This wounds me more than any number of injurious and unkind speeches could do . In gratitude to one ’s benefactor — ”
38468	38483	38320	38320	he	132	“ Benefactor ? What do I owe you , I should like to know ? ”
38484	38543	38320	38320	he	132	“ You owe me your life . I stood between the trees and the foe , and kept hundreds and thousands of the enemy at bay when they were thirsting for your blood . And I did not do it to display my daring . I did it because I loved you and could not live without you . ”
38544	38763	38320	38320	he	132	“ There — you have said enough ! I will not stay here to listen to these infamies . I can endure your lies , but not your love . Keep that corruption for somebody with a stronger stomach than mine . And I want to say this , before I go . That you people ’s small performances might appear the better and win you the more glory , I hid my own deeds through all the march . I went always to the front , where the fighting was thickest , to be remote from you in order that you might not see and be discouraged by the things I did to the enemy . It was my purpose to keep this a secret in my own breast , but you force me to reveal it . If you ask for my witnesses , yonder they lie , on the road we have come . I found that road mud , I paved it with corpses . I found that country sterile , I fertilized it with blood . Time and again I was urged to go to the rear because the command could not proceed on account of my dead . And yet you , you miscreant , accuse me of climbing trees ! Pah ! ”
39051	39054	39045	39045	Joan	110	“ Forward ! ”
39264	39283	39256	39259	the Sieur de Metz	167	“ The King has got the letter , but they will not let us have speech with him . ”
39284	39291	39256	39259	the Sieur de Metz	167	“ Who is it that forbids ? ”
39292	39419	39256	39259	the Sieur de Metz	167	“ None forbids , but there be three or four that are nearest his person — schemers and traitors every one — that put obstructions in the way , and seek all ways , by lies and pretexts , to make delay . Chiefest of these are Georges de la Tremouille and that plotting fox , the Archbishop of Rheims . While they keep the King idle and in bondage to his sports and follies , they are great and their importance grows ; whereas if ever he assert himself and rise and strike for crown and country like a man , their reign is done . So they but thrive , they care not if the crown go to destruction and the King with it . ”
39420	39429	39256	39259	the Sieur de Metz	167	“ You have spoken with others besides these ? ”
39430	39792	39793	39793	Joan	110	“ Not of the Court , no — the Court are the meek slaves of those reptiles , and watch their mouths and their actions , acting as they act , thinking as they think , saying as they say ; wherefore they are cold to us , and turn aside and go another way when we appear . But we have spoken with the commissioners from Orleans . They said with heat : ‘ It is a marvel that any man in such desperate case as is the King can moon around in this torpid way , and see his all go to ruin without lifting a finger to stay the disaster . What a most strange spectacle it is ! Here he is , shut up in this wee corner of the realm like a rat in a trap ; his royal shelter this huge gloomy tomb of a castle , with wormy rags for upholstery and crippled furniture for use , a very house of desolation ; in his treasure forty francs , and not a farthing more , God be witness ! no army , nor any shadow of one ; and by contrast with his hungry poverty you behold this crownless pauper and his shoals of fools and favorites tricked out in the gaudiest silks and velvets you shall find in any Court in Christendom . And look you , he knows that when our city falls — as fall it surely will except succor come swiftly — France falls ; he knows that when that day comes he will be an outlaw and a fugitive , and that behind him the English flag will float unchallenged over every acre of his great heritage ; he knows these things , he knows that our faithful city is fighting all solitary and alone against disease , starvation , and the sword to stay this awful calamity , yet he will not strike one blow to save her , he will not hear our prayers , he will not even look upon our faces . ’ That is what the commissioners said , and they are in despair . ”
39798	39820	39793	39793	Joan	110	“ It is pity , but they must not despair . The Dauphin will hear them presently . Tell them so . ”
39843	39961	39833	39833	he	270	“ We will tell them so , and it will content them , for they believe you come from God . The Archbishop and his confederate have for backer that veteran soldier Raoul de Gaucourt , Grand Master of the Palace , a worthy man , but simply a soldier , with no head for any greater matter . He can not make out to see how a country - girl , ignorant of war , can take a sword in her small hand and win victories where the trained generals of France have looked for defeats only , for fifty years — and always found them . And so he lifts his frosty mustache and scoffs . ”
39962	40002	39821	39821	She	110	“ When God fights it is but small matter whether the hand that bears His sword is big or little . He will perceive this in time . Is there none in that Castle of Chinon who favors us ? ”
40003	40034	39833	39833	he	270	“ Yes , the King ’s mother - in - law , Yolande , Queen of Sicily , who is wise and good . She spoke with the Sieur Bertrand . ”
40035	40051	40053	40053	Bertrand	168	“ She favors us , and she hates those others , the King ’s beguilers , ”
40055	40455	40053	40053	Bertrand	168	“ She was full of interest , and asked a thousand questions , all of which I answered according to my ability . Then she sat thinking over these replies until I thought she was lost in a dream and would wake no more . But it was not so . At last she said , slowly , and as if she were talking to herself : ‘ A child of seventeen — a girl — country - bred — untaught — ignorant of war , the use of arms , and the conduct of battles — modest , gentle , shrinking — yet throws away her shepherd ’s crook and clothes herself in steel , and fights her way through a hundred and fifty leagues of fear , and comes — she to whom a king must be a dread and awful presence — and will stand up before such an one and say , Be not afraid , God has sent me to save you ! Ah , whence could come a courage and conviction so sublime as this but from very God Himself ! ’ She was silent again awhile , thinking and making up her mind ; then she said , ‘ And whether she comes of God or no , there is that in her heart that raises her above men — high above all men that breathe in France to - day — for in her is that mysterious something that puts heart into soldiers , and turns mobs of cowards into armies of fighters that forget what fear is when they are in that presence — fighters who go into battle with joy in their eyes and songs on their lips , and sweep over the field like a storm — that is the spirit that can save France , and that alone , come it whence it may ! It is in her , I do truly believe , for what else could have borne up that child on that great march , and made her despise its dangers and fatigues ? The King must see her face to face — and shall ! ’ She dismissed me with those good words , and I know her promise will be kept . They will delay her all they can — those animals — but she will not fail in the end . ”
40456	40462	40464	40466	the other knight	1337	“ Would she were King ! ”
40470	40540	40464	40466	the other knight	1337	“ For there is little hope that the King himself can be stirred out of his lethargy . He is wholly without hope , and is only thinking of throwing away everything and flying to some foreign land . The commissioners say there is a spell upon him that makes him hopeless — yes , and that it is shut up in a mystery which they can not fathom . ”
40541	40547	40549	40549	Joan	110	“ I know the mystery , ”
40555	40597	40549	40549	Joan	110	“ I know it , and he knows it , but no other but God . When I see him I will tell him a secret that will drive away his trouble , then he will hold up his head again . ”
41299	41321	41255	41255	she	110	“ Ye will forgive me , reverend sirs , but I have no message save for the King ’s ear alone . ”
41342	41372	41338	41339	the spokesman	1373	“ Hark ye , to you fling the King ’s command in his face and refuse to deliver this message of yours to his servants appointed to receive it ? ”
41373	41406	41338	41339	the spokesman	1373	“ God has appointed me to receive it , and another ’s commandment may not take precedence of that . I pray you let me have speech for his grace the Dauphin . ”
41407	41429	41503	41503	her	110	“ Forbear this folly , and come at your message ! Deliver it , and waste no more time about it . ”
41430	41479	41338	41339	the spokesman	1373	“ You err indeed , most reverend fathers in God , and it is not well . I am not come hither to talk , but to deliver Orleans , and lead the Dauphin to his good city of Rheims , and set the crown upon his head . ”
41480	41491	41503	41503	her	110	“ Is that the message you send to the King ? ”
41507	41528	41493	41493	Joan	110	“ Ye will pardon me for reminding you again — but I have no message to send to any one . ”
41622	41628	41629	41629	she	110	“ Who sent them here ? ”
41632	41636	41629	41629	she	110	“ The King . ”
41637	41646	41647	41647	She	110	“ Who moved the King to send them ? ”
41672	41699	41668	41668	she	110	“ The Dauphin ’s council moved him to it . Are they enemies to me and to the Dauphin ’s weal , or are they friends ? ”
41700	41703	41705	41707	the Sieur Bertrand	168	“ Enemies , ”
41709	41732	41705	41707	the Sieur Bertrand	168	“ If one would have a message go sound and ungarbled , does one choose traitors and tricksters to send it by ? ”
41762	41897	41758	41758	she	110	“ They had but small wit that contrived this trap . They thought to get my message and seem to deliver it straight , yet deftly twist it from its purpose . You know that one part of my message is but this — to move the Dauphin by argument and reasonings to give me men - at - arms and send me to the siege . If an enemy carried these in the right words , the exact words , and no word missing , yet left out the persuasions of gesture and supplicating tone and beseeching looks that inform the words and make them live , where were the value of that argument — whom could it convince ? Be patient , the Dauphin will hear me presently ; have no fear . ”
41914	41933	41912	41912	himself	1386	“ She was right and wise , and we are but dull fools , when all is said . ”
43546	43556	43529	43529	Joan	110	“ How sweet — how lovely — how divine ! ”
43750	43761	43745	43745	I	0	“ What is it , man , what is it ? ”
43774	43812	43745	43745	I	0	“ They have taken advantage of the hint in her letter to play a trick upon her ! She will err , and they will laugh at her . That is not the King that sits there . ”
43918	43934	43884	43884	she	110	“ God of his grace give you long life , O dear and gentle Dauphin ! ”
43945	43958	43940	43941	De Metz	175	“ By the shadow of God , it is an amazing thing ! ”
43984	43995	43960	43960	he	1482	“ Now , what have these painted infidels to say ! ”
44009	44028	44030	44030	he	1483	“ Ah , you mistake , my child , I am not the King . There he is , ”
44050	44083	44043	44043	he	1483	“ Ah , it is a shame to use her so . But for this lie she had gone through safe . I will go and proclaim to all the house what — ”
44084	44090	44092	44092	I	0	“ Stay where you are ! ”
44130	44144	44120	44120	her	110	“ No , gracious liege , you are he , and none other . ”
44156	44219	44153	44153	he	1483	“ Verily , she was not guessing , she knew . Now , how could she know ? It is a miracle . I am content , and will meddle no more , for I perceive that she is equal to her occasions , having that in her head that can not profitably be helped by the vacancy that is in mine . ”
44245	44258	44239	44240	the King	270	“ But tell me who you are , and what would you ? ”
44259	44328	44333	44333	she	1488	“ I am called Joan the Maid , and am sent to say that the King of Heaven wills that you be crowned and consecrated in your good city of Rheims , and be thereafter Lieutenant of the Lord of Heaven , who is King of France . And He willeth also that you set me at my appointed work and give me men - at - arms . ”
44346	44362	44333	44333	she	1488	“ For then will I raise the siege of Orleans and break the English power ! ”
44883	44977	44880	44880	Joan	110	“ I will give you a sign , and you shall no more doubt . There is a secret trouble in your heart which you speak of to none — a doubt which wastes away your courage , and makes you dream of throwing all away and fleeing from your realm . Within this little while you have been praying , in your own breast , that God of his grace would resolve that doubt , even if the doing of it must show you that no kingly right is lodged in you . ”
45017	45055	45014	45014	he	270	“ The sign is sufficient . I know now that these Voices are of God . They have said true in this matter ; if they have said more , tell it me — I will believe . ”
45056	45122	45014	45014	he	270	“ They have resolved that doubt , and I bring their very words , which are these : Thou art lawful heir to the King thy father , and true heir of France . God has spoken it . Now lift up thy head , and doubt no more , but give me men - at - arms and let me get about my work . ”
46189	46203	46204	46204	they	1431	“ Give us something fresh , we are fatigued with that old thing , ”
46217	46233	46204	46204	they	1431	“ Tell about the surprise at Beaulieu again — tell it three or four times ! ”
47062	47074	47045	47046	The people	313	“ the King ’s Audience!—the King ’s Audience!—the King ’s Audience ! ”
47536	47541	47522	47523	the governor	2647	“ destined to achieve both ”
47807	47936	47804	47804	he	2647	“ But mark you what she did . She gazed steadfastly upon that sham ’s villain face as I now gaze upon yours — this being her noble and simple attitude , just as I stand now — then turned she — thus — to me , and stretching her arm out — so — and pointing with her finger , she said , in that firm , calm tone which she was used to use in directing the conduct of a battle , ‘ Pluck me this false knave from the throne ! ’ I , striding forward as I do now , took him by the collar and lifted him out and held him aloft — thus — as if he had been but a child . ”
48010	48055	48057	48057	she	1667	“ Then I set him down upon his feet — thus — being minded to get him by a better hold and heave him out of the window , but she bid me forbear , so by that error he escaped with his life . “
48173	48240	48242	48243	the King	270	” He made a fine and picturesque thing of the march - out from the Audience , augmenting the glories of it to the last limit of the impossibilities ; then he took from his finger and held up a brass nut from a bolt - head which the head ostler at the castle had given him that morning , and made his conclusion — thus : “
48411	48456	48457	48457	They	1678	“ So ended the most fortunate and memorable episode , so big with future weal for the crown and the nation , and unto God be the thanks ! Rise ! Fill your flagons ! Now — to France and the King — drink ! ”
48582	48666	48578	48578	they	1680	“ Your Highness says her Voices have revealed to you , by her mouth , a secret known only to yourself and God . How can you know that her Voices are not of Satan , and she his mouthpiece?—for does not Satan know the secrets of men and use his knowledge for the destruction of their souls ? It is a dangerous business , and your Highness will do well not to proceed in it without probing the matter to the bottom . ”
48816	48843	48808	48808	She	110	“ You are welcome ; the more of the blood of France that is joined to this cause , the better for the cause and it . ”
49372	49388	49367	49367	they	1360	“ gentle and simple little shepherdess , very candid , but not given to talking . ”
49868	49876	49864	49864	she	110	“ with a noble dignity and simplicity , ”
50024	50078	50014	50014	I	0	“ One day they harried and pestered her with arguments , reasonings , objections , and other windy and wordy trivialities , gathered out of the works of this and that and the other great theological authority , until at last her patience vanished , and she turned upon them sharply and said : “
50129	50323	50324	50324	You	1756	” Necessarily those were trying days for her , and wearing for everybody that took part ; but her share was the hardest , for she had no holidays , but must be always on hand and stay the long hours through , whereas this , that , and the other inquisitor could absent himself and rest up from his fatigues when he got worn out . And yet she showed no wear , no weariness , and but seldom let fly her temper . As a rule she put her day through calm , alert , patient , fencing with those veteran masters of scholarly sword - play and coming out always without a scratch . One day a Dominican sprung upon her a question which made everybody cock up his ears with interest ; as for me , I trembled , and said to myself she is done this time , poor Joan , for there is no way of answering this . The sly Dominican began in this way — in a sort of indolent fashion , as if the thing he was about was a matter of no moment : “
50338	50339	50342	50342	He	140	” “
50347	50348	50342	50342	He	140	” “
50372	50373	50369	50369	I	0	” “
50382	50383	50369	50369	I	0	” “
50406	50407	50455	50455	He	140	” “
50415	50435	50455	50455	He	140	” The Dominican lifted his head suddenly , and sprung that question I have spoken of , with exultation : “
50469	50544	50545	50545	He	140	” There was a fine stir and commotion when he said that , and a sudden thrusting forward of heads and putting up of hands to ears to catch the answer ; and the Dominican wagged his head with satisfaction , and looked about him collecting his applause , for it shone in every face . But Joan was not disturbed . There was no note of disquiet in her voice when she answered : “
50567	50627	50631	50632	the child	634	” You could see a light of admiration sweep the house from face to face like a ray from the sun . Even the Dominican himself looked pleased , to see his master - stroke so neatly parried , and I heard a venerable bishop mutter , in the phrasing common to priest and people in that robust time , “
50656	50721	50646	50646	He	140	” Another day , when the inquisition had dragged along until everybody looked drowsy and tired but Joan , Brother Seguin , professor of theology at the University of Poitiers , who was a sour and sarcastic man , fell to plying Joan with all sorts of nagging questions in his bastard Limousin French — for he was from Limoges . Finally he said : “
50737	50738	50734	50734	they	1764	” “
50741	50742	50734	50734	they	1764	” “
50761	50762	50728	50729	those angels	1764	” “
50767	50768	50728	50729	those angels	1764	” “
50791	50792	50786	50786	your	1763	” “
50806	50832	50799	50799	I	0	” said she , and was going on , but stopped . Then she added , almost as if she were saying it to herself , “
50842	50871	50840	50840	yours	1763	” I knew there was a chuckle back of her eyes , for all their innocence . Everybody shouted . Brother Seguin was nettled , and asked brusquely : “
50878	50886	50873	50873	you	1763	” Joan answered with an irritating nonchalance : “
50901	50926	50873	50873	you	1763	” Brother Seguin lost his patience , and heaped sarcasm after sarcasm upon her , and finally burst out in angry earnest , exclaiming : “
50965	50988	50989	50989	I	0	” This roused Joan , and she was on her feet in a moment , and flung out her retort with spirit : “
51030	51228	51234	51234	God	140	” The fire was leaping from her eyes — ah , the heroic little figure ! ca n’t you see her ? There was a great burst of acclamations , and she sat down blushing , for it was not in her delicate nature to like being conspicuous . This speech and that episode about the French language scored two points against Brother Seguin , while he scored nothing against Joan ; yet , sour man as he was , he was a manly man , and honest , as you can see by the histories ; for at the Rehabilitation he could have hidden those unlucky incidents if he had chosen , but he did n’t do it , but spoke them right out in his evidence . On one of the latter days of that three - weeks session the gowned scholars and professors made one grand assault all along the line , fairly overwhelming Joan with objections and arguments culled from the writings of every ancient and illustrious authority of the Roman Church . She was well - nigh smothered ; but at last she shook herself free and struck back , crying out : “
51273	51452	51251	51251	I	0	” From the first she was the guest , by invitation , of the dame De Rabateau , wife of a councilor of the Parliament of Poitiers ; and to that house the great ladies of the city came nightly to see Joan and talk with her ; and not these only , but the old lawyers , councilors and scholars of the Parliament and the University . And these grave men , accustomed to weigh every strange and questionable thing , and cautiously consider it , and turn it about this way and that and still doubt it , came night after night , and night after night , falling ever deeper and deeper under the influence of that mysterious something , that spell , that elusive and unwordable fascination , which was the supremest endowment of Joan of Arc , that winning and persuasive and convincing something which high and low alike recognized and felt , but which neither high nor low could explain or describe , and one by one they all surrendered , saying , “
51460	51657	51453	51454	This child	1770	” All day long Joan , in the great court and subject to its rigid rules of procedure , was at a disadvantage ; her judges had things their own way ; but at night she held court herself , and matters were reversed , she presiding , with her tongue free and her same judges there before her . There could not be but one result : all the objections and hindrances they could build around her with their hard labors of the day she would charm away at night . In the end , she carried her judges with her in a mass , and got her great verdict without a dissenting voice . The court was a sight to see when the president of it read it from his throne , for all the great people of the town were there who could get admission and find room . First there were some solemn ceremonies , proper and usual at such times ; then , when there was silence again , the reading followed , penetrating the deep hush so that every word was heard in even the remotest parts of the house : “
51736	52021	52022	52022	They	1776	” The court rose , and then the storm of plaudits burst forth unrebuked , dying down and bursting forth again and again , and I lost sight of Joan , for she was swallowed up in a great tide of people who rushed to congratulate her and pour out benedictions upon her and upon the cause of France , now solemnly and irrevocably delivered into her little hands . Chapter 9 She Is Made General - in - Chief IT WAS indeed a great day , and a stirring thing to see . She had won ! It was a mistake of Tremouille and her other ill - wishers to let her hold court those nights . The commission of priests sent to Lorraine ostensibly to inquire into Joan ’s character — in fact to weary her with delays and wear out her purpose and make her give it up — arrived back and reported her character perfect . Our affairs were in full career now , you see . The verdict made a prodigious stir . Dead France woke suddenly to life , wherever the great news traveled . Whereas before , the spiritless and cowed people hung their heads and slunk away if one mentioned war to them , now they came clamoring to be enlisted under the banner of the Maid of Vaucouleurs , and the roaring of war - songs and the thundering of the drums filled all the air . I remembered now what she had said , that time there in our village when I proved by facts and statistics that France ’s case was hopeless , and nothing could ever rouse the people from their lethargy : “
52037	52156	52165	52166	a soldier	2476	” It has been said that misfortunes never come one at a time , but in a body . In our case it was the same with good luck . Having got a start , it came flooding in , tide after tide . Our next wave of it was of this sort . There had been grave doubts among the priests as to whether the Church ought to permit a female soldier to dress like a man . But now came a verdict on that head . Two of the greatest scholars and theologians of the time — one of whom had been Chancellor of the University of Paris — rendered it . They decided that since Joan “
52182	52477	52501	52504	God King of France	1782	” It was a great point gained , the Church ’s authority to dress as a man . Oh , yes , wave on wave the good luck came sweeping in . Never mind about the smaller waves , let us come to the largest one of all , the wave that swept us small fry quite off our feet and almost drowned us with joy . The day of the great verdict , couriers had been despatched to the King with it , and the next morning bright and early the clear notes of a bugle came floating to us on the crisp air , and we pricked up our ears and began to count them . One — two — three ; pause ; one — two ; pause ; one — two — three , again — and out we skipped and went flying ; for that formula was used only when the King ’s herald - at - arms would deliver a proclamation to the people . As we hurried along , people came racing out of every street and house and alley , men , women , and children , all flushed , excited , and throwing lacking articles of clothing on as they ran ; still those clear notes pealed out , and still the rush of people increased till the whole town was abroad and streaming along the principal street . At last we reached the square , which was now packed with citizens , and there , high on the pedestal of the great cross , we saw the herald in his brilliant costume , with his servitors about him . The next moment he began his delivery in the powerful voice proper to his office : “
52546	52594	52522	52523	the Maid	1326	” Here a thousand caps flew in the air , and the multitude burst into a hurricane of cheers that raged and raged till it seemed as if it would never come to an end ; but at last it did ; then the herald went on and finished:—“and
52619	54036	52612	52612	his	1781	” That was the end , and the hurricane began again , and was split up into innumerable strips by the blowers of it and wafted through all the lanes and streets of the town . General of the Armies of France , with a prince of the blood for subordinate ! Yesterday she was nothing — to - day she was this . Yesterday she was not even a sergeant , not even a corporal , not even a private — to - day , with one step , she was at the top . Yesterday she was less than nobody to the newest recruit — to - day her command was law to La Hire , Saintrailles , the Bastard of Orleans , and all those others , veterans of old renown , illustrious masters of the trade of war . These were the thoughts I was thinking ; I was trying to realize this strange and wonderful thing that had happened , you see . My mind went travelling back , and presently lighted upon a picture — a picture which was still so new and fresh in my memory that it seemed a matter of only yesterday — and indeed its date was no further back than the first days of January . This is what it was . A peasant - girl in a far - off village , her seventeenth year not yet quite completed , and herself and her village as unknown as if they had been on the other side of the globe . She had picked up a friendless wanderer somewhere and brought it home — a small gray kitten in a forlorn and starving condition — and had fed it and comforted it and got its confidence and made it believe in her , and now it was curled up in her lap asleep , and she was knitting a coarse stocking and thinking — dreaming — about what , one may never know . And now — the kitten had hardly had time to become a cat , and yet already the girl is General of the Armies of France , with a prince of the blood to give orders to , and out of her village obscurity her name has climbed up like the sun and is visible from all corners of the land ! It made me dizzy to think of these things , they were so out of the common order , and seemed so impossible . Chapter 10 The Maid ’s Sword and Banner JOAN ’S first official act was to dictate a letter to the English commanders at Orleans , summoning them to deliver up all strongholds in their possession and depart out of France . She must have been thinking it all out before and arranging it in her mind , it flowed from her lips so smoothly , and framed itself into such vivacious and forcible language . Still , it might not have been so ; she always had a quick mind and a capable tongue , and her faculties were constantly developing in these latter weeks . This letter was to be forwarded presently from Blois . Men , provisions , and money were offering in plenty now , and Joan appointed Blois as a recruiting - station and depot of supplies , and ordered up La Hire from the front to take charge . The Great Bastard — him of the ducal house , and governor of Orleans — had been clamoring for weeks for Joan to be sent to him , and now came another messenger , old D’Aulon , a veteran officer , a trusty man and fine and honest . The King kept him , and gave him to Joan to be chief of her household , and commanded her to appoint the rest of her people herself , making their number and dignity accord with the greatness of her office ; and at the same time he gave order that they should be properly equipped with arms , clothing , and horses . Meantime the King was having a complete suit of armor made for her at Tours . It was of the finest steel , heavily plated with silver , richly ornamented with engraved designs , and polished like a mirror . Joan ’s Voices had told her that there was an ancient sword hidden somewhere behind the altar of St. Catherine ’s at Fierbois , and she sent De Metz to get it . The priests knew of no such sword , but a search was made , and sure enough it was found in that place , buried a little way under the ground . It had no sheath and was very rusty , but the priests polished it up and sent it to Tours , whither we were now to come . They also had a sheath of crimson velvet made for it , and the people of Tours equipped it with another , made of cloth - of - gold . But Joan meant to carry this sword always in battle ; so she laid the showy sheaths away and got one made of leather . It was generally believed that this sword had belonged to Charlemagne , but that was only a matter of opinion . I wanted to sharpen that old blade , but she said it was not necessary , as she should never kill anybody , and should carry it only as a symbol of authority . At Tours she designed her Standard , and a Scotch painter named James Power made it . It was of the most delicate white boucassin , with fringes of silk . For device it bore the image of God the Father throned in the clouds and holding the world in His hand ; two angels knelt at His feet , presenting lilies ; inscription , JESUS , MARIA ; on the reverse the crown of France supported by two angels . She also caused a smaller standard or pennon to be made , whereon was represented an angel offering a lily to the Holy Virgin . Everything was humming there at Tours . Every now and then one heard the bray and crash of military music , every little while one heard the measured tramp of marching men — squads of recruits leaving for Blois ; songs and shoutings and huzzas filled the air night and day , the town was full of strangers , the streets and inns were thronged , the bustle of preparation was everywhere , and everybody carried a glad and cheerful face . Around Joan ’s headquarters a crowd of people was always massed , hoping for a glimpse of the new General , and when they got it , they went wild ; but they seldom got it , for she was busy planning her campaign , receiving reports , giving orders , despatching couriers , and giving what odd moments she could spare to the companies of great folk waiting in the drawing - rooms . As for us boys , we hardly saw her at all , she was so occupied . We were in a mixed state of mind — sometimes hopeful , sometimes not ; mostly not . She had not appointed her household yet — that was our trouble . We knew she was being overrun with applications for places in it , and that these applications were backed by great names and weighty influence , whereas we had nothing of the sort to recommend us . She could fill her humblest places with titled folk — folk whose relationships would be a bulwark for her and a valuable support at all times . In these circumstances would policy allow her to consider us ? We were not as cheerful as the rest of the town , but were inclined to be depressed and worried . Sometimes we discussed our slim chances and gave them as good an appearance as we could . But the very mention of the subject was anguish to the Paladin ; for whereas we had some little hope , he had none at all . As a rule Noel Rainguesson was quite willing to let the dismal matter alone ; but not when the Paladin was present . Once we were talking the thing over , when Noel said : “
54093	54132	54133	54133	I	0	” The Paladin roused up and looked almost cheerful ; for he was a believer in dreams , and in anything and everything of a superstitious sort , in fact . He said , with a rising hopefulness : “
54148	54149	54141	54141	you	157	” “
54168	54169	54170	54170	Noel	135	” “
54252	54253	54254	54254	I	0	” “
54264	54265	54259	54259	my	0	” “
54344	54394	54342	54342	he	1800	” He began to walk the floor and pile castles in the air so fast and so high that we could hardly keep up with him . Then all of a sudden all the joy went out of his face and misery took its place , and he said : “
54495	54513	54492	54492	they	1805	” The vast creature was almost crying . Then he pulled himself together and said , remorsefully , “
54526	54569	54574	54574	I	0	” He was drowned out with a chorus of groans and outraged exclamations ; and before he could begin again , one of D’Aulon ’s liveried servants appeared and said we were required at headquarters . We rose , and Noel said : “
54612	54821	54591	54591	She	1807	” But the Paladin was afraid to go , so we left him . When we presently stood in the presence , in front of a crowd of glittering officers of the army , Joan greeted us with a winning smile , and said she appointed all of us to places in her household , for she wanted her old friends by her . It was a beautiful surprise to have ourselves honored like this when she could have had people of birth and consequence instead , but we could n’t find our tongues to say so , she was become so great and so high above us now . One at a time we stepped forward and each received his warrant from the hand of our chief , D’Aulon . All of us had honorable places ; the two knights stood highest ; then Joan ’s two brothers ; I was first page and secretary , a young gentleman named Raimond was second page ; Noel was her messenger ; she had two heralds , and also a chaplain and almoner , whose name was Jean Pasquerel . She had previously appointed a maitre d’hotel and a number of domestics . Now she looked around and said : “
54828	54834	54835	54835	He	157	” The Sieur Bertrand said : “
54846	54847	54835	54835	He	157	” “
54859	54893	54894	54894	I	0	” The Paladin entered humbly enough . He ventured no farther than just within the door . He stopped there , looking embarrassed and afraid . Then Joan spoke pleasantly , and said : “
54931	54948	54925	54925	I	0	” It was fine to see the Paladin ’s face light up when she said that . “
54956	54957	54950	54950	you	157	” “
54962	54972	54950	54950	you	157	” he said ; and I said to myself , “
55004	55005	55006	55006	I	0	” “
55010	55014	55008	55008	you	157	” said Joan . “
55043	55076	55036	55036	you	157	” He took the banner , which is now the most precious of the memorials that remain of Joan of Arc , and his voice was unsteady with emotion when he said : “
55116	55149	55150	55151	The first	1821	” Chapter 11 The War March Is Begun NOEL and I went back together — silent at first , and impressed . Finally Noel came up out of his thinkings and said : “
55183	55184	55203	55203	her	1823	” “
55206	55207	55203	55203	her	1823	” “
55233	55234	55228	55231	one Standard - Bearer	1825	” “
55251	55252	55248	55248	her	1823	” “
55305	55306	55298	55298	you	1832	” “
55327	55328	55321	55321	Joan	110	” “
55342	55343	55340	55340	you	0	” “
55360	55385	55357	55357	I	0	” Noel was surprised at that , and glanced up quickly , as if to see if I was in earnest . He said : “
55420	55421	55422	55422	I	0	” “
56008	56009	56010	56011	La Hire	195	” “
56013	56017	56010	56011	La Hire	195	” cried Noel , “
56033	56034	56035	56035	I	0	” “
56053	56054	56038	56038	His	2334	” “
56062	56063	56059	56059	him	2334	” “
56151	56152	56139	56139	Joan	110	” “
56253	56254	56236	56236	I	0	” “
56327	56328	56330	56330	you	1891	” “
56335	56339	56340	56340	She	110	” cried Noel . “
56385	57003	56381	56381	her	110	” I was summoned now to write a letter from Joan ’s dictation . During the next day and night our several uniforms were made by the tailors , and our new armor provided . We were beautiful to look upon now , whether clothed for peace or war . Clothed for peace , in costly stuffs and rich colors , the Paladin was a tower dyed with the glories of the sunset ; plumed and sashed and iron - clad for war , he was a still statelier thing to look at . Orders had been issued for the march toward Blois . It was a clear , sharp , beautiful morning . As our showy great company trotted out in column , riding two and two , Joan and the Duke of Alencon in the lead , D’Aulon and the big standard - bearer next , and so on , we made a handsome spectacle , as you may well imagine ; and as we plowed through the cheering crowds , with Joan bowing her plumed head to left and right and the sun glinting from her silver mail , the spectators realized that the curtain was rolling up before their eyes upon the first act of a prodigious drama , and their rising hopes were expressed in an enthusiasm that increased with each moment , until at last one seemed to even physically feel the concussion of the huzzas as well as hear them . Far down the street we heard the softened strains of wind - blown music , and saw a cloud of lancers moving , the sun glowing with a subdued light upon the massed armor , but striking bright upon the soaring lance - heads — a vaguely luminous nebula , so to speak , with a constellation twinkling above it — and that was our guard of honor . It joined us , the procession was complete , the first war - march of Joan of Arc was begun , the curtain was up . Chapter 12 Joan Puts Heart in Her Army WE WERE at Blois three days . Oh , that camp , it is one of the treasures of my memory ! Order ? There was no more order among those brigands than there is among the wolves and the hyenas . They went roaring and drinking about , whooping , shouting , swearing , and entertaining themselves with all manner of rude and riotous horse - play ; and the place was full of loud and lewd women , and they were no whit behind the men for romps and noise and fantastics . It was in the midst of this wild mob that Noel and I had our first glimpse of La Hire . He answered to our dearest dreams . He was of great size and of martial bearing , he was cased in mail from head to heel , with a bushel of swishing plumes on his helmet , and at his side the vast sword of the time . He was on his way to pay his respects in state to Joan , and as he passed through the camp he was restoring order , and proclaiming that the Maid had come , and he would have no such spectacle as this exposed to the head of the army . His way of creating order was his own , not borrowed . He did it with his great fists . As he moved along swearing and admonishing , he let drive this way , that way , and the other , and wherever his blow landed , a man went down . “
57007	57011	57005	57005	you	1895	” he said , “
57033	57546	57020	57028	the Commander - in - Chief in the camp	1896	” and he laid the man flat . What his idea of straightening up was , was his own secret . We followed the veteran to headquarters , listening , observing , admiring — yes , devouring , you may say , the pet hero of the boys of France from our cradles up to that happy day , and their idol and ours . I called to mind how Joan had once rebuked the Paladin , there in the pastures of Domremy , for uttering lightly those mighty names , La Hire and the Bastard of Orleans , and how she said that if she could but be permitted to stand afar off and let her eyes rest once upon those great men , she would hold it a privilege . They were to her and the other girls just what they were to the boys . Well , here was one of them at last — and what was his errand ? It was hard to realize it , and yet it was true ; he was coming to uncover his head before her and take her orders . While he was quieting a considerable group of his brigands in his soothing way , near headquarters , we stepped on ahead and got a glimpse of Joan ’s military family , the great chiefs of the army , for they had all arrived now . There they were , six officers of wide renown , handsome men in beautiful armor , but the Lord High Admiral of France was the handsomest of them all and had the most gallant bearing . When La Hire entered , one could see the surprise in his face at Joan ’s beauty and extreme youth , and one could see , too , by Joan ’s glad smile , that it made her happy to get sight of this hero of her childhood at last . La Hire bowed low , with his helmet in his gauntleted hand , and made a bluff but handsome little speech with hardly an oath in it , and one could see that those two took to each other on the spot . The visit of ceremony was soon over , and the others went away ; but La Hire stayed , and he and Joan sat there , and he sipped her wine , and they talked and laughed together like old friends . And presently she gave him some instructions , in his quality as master of the camp , which made his breath stand still . For , to begin with , she said that all those loose women must pack out of the place at once , she would n’t allow one of them to remain . Next , the rough carousing must stop , drinking must be brought within proper and strictly defined limits , and discipline must take the place of disorder . And finally she climaxed the list of surprises with this — which nearly lifted him out of his armor : “
57578	57602	57605	57606	sweet child	1901	” La Hire could not say a word for a good part of a minute , then he said , in deep dejection : “
57636	57916	57628	57628	they	1902	” And he went on , pouring out a most pathetic stream of arguments and blasphemy , which broke Joan all up , and made her laugh as she had not laughed since she played in the Domremy pastures . It was good to hear . But she stuck to her point ; so the soldier yielded , and said all right , if such were the orders he must obey , and would do the best that was in him ; then he refreshed himself with a lurid explosion of oaths , and said that if any man in the camp refused to renounce sin and lead a pious life , he would knock his head off . That started Joan off again ; she was really having a good time , you see . But she would not consent to that form of conversions . She said they must be voluntary . La Hire said that that was all right , he was n’t going to kill the voluntary ones , but only the others . No matter , none of them must be killed — Joan could n’t have it . She said that to give a man a chance to volunteer , on pain of death if he did n’t , left him more or less trammeled , and she wanted him to be entirely free . So the soldier sighed and said he would advertise the mass , but said he doubted if there was a man in camp that was any more likely to go to it than he was himself . Then there was another surprise for him , for Joan said : “
57926	57927	57928	57928	I	0	” “
57938	57939	57928	57928	I	0	” “
57959	57960	57948	57948	You	1906	” “
57987	57988	57981	57981	I	0	” “
58025	58052	58019	58019	you	1906	” La Hire tried to cheer up , but he was not able to do it . He sighed like a zephyr , and presently said : “
58075	58076	58073	58073	I	0	” “
58086	58087	58073	58073	I	0	” “
58116	58546	58107	58108	my General	1907	” He begged so hard for grace for his impediment , that Joan left him one fragment of it ; she said he might swear by his baton , the symbol of his generalship . He promised that he would swear only by his baton when in her presence , and would try to modify himself elsewhere , but doubted he could manage it , now that it was so old and stubborn a habit , and such a solace and support to his declining years . That tough old lion went away from there a good deal tamed and civilized — not to say softened and sweetened , for perhaps those expressions would hardly fit him . Noel and I believed that when he was away from Joan ’s influence his old aversions would come up so strong in him that he could not master them , and so would n’t go to mass . But we got up early in the morning to see . Satan was converted , you see . Well , the rest followed . Joan rode up and down that camp , and wherever that fair young form appeared in its shining armor , with that sweet face to grace the vision and perfect it , the rude host seemed to think they saw the god of war in person , descended out of the clouds ; and first they wondered , then they worshiped . After that , she could do with them what she would . In three days it was a clean camp and orderly , and those barbarians were herding to divine service twice a day like good children . The women were gone . La Hire was stunned by these marvels ; he could not understand them . He went outside the camp when he wanted to swear . He was that sort of a man — sinful by nature and habit , but full of superstitious respect for holy places . The enthusiasm of the reformed army for Joan , its devotion to her , and the hot desire she had aroused in it to be led against the enemy , exceeded any manifestations of this sort which La Hire had ever seen before in his long career . His admiration of it all , and his wonder over the mystery and miracle of it , were beyond his power to put into words . He had held this army cheap before , but his pride and confidence in it knew no limits now . He said : “
58572	58795	58797	58797	they	1910	” Joan and he were inseparable , and a quaint and pleasant contrast they made . He was so big , she so little ; he was so gray and so far along in his pilgrimage of life , she so youthful ; his face was so bronzed and scarred , hers so fair and pink , so fresh and smooth ; she was so gracious , and he so stern ; she was so pure , so innocent , he such a cyclopedia of sin . In her eye was stored all charity and compassion , in his lightnings ; when her glance fell upon you it seemed to bring benediction and the peace of God , but with his it was different , generally . They rode through the camp a dozen times a day , visiting every corner of it , observing , inspecting , perfecting ; and wherever they appeared the enthusiasm broke forth . They rode side by side , he a great figure of brawn and muscle , she a little masterwork of roundness and grace ; he a fortress of rusty iron , she a shining statuette of silver ; and when the reformed raiders and bandits caught sight of them they spoke out , with affection and welcome in their voices , and said : “
58807	59051	58800	58800	Satan	144	” All the three days that we were in Blois , Joan worked earnestly and tirelessly to bring La Hire to God — to rescue him from the bondage of sin — to breathe into his stormy heart the serenity and peace of religion . She urged , she begged , she implored him to pray . He stood out , three days of our stay , begging about piteously to be let off — to be let off from just that one thing , that impossible thing ; he would do anything else — anything — command , and he would obey — he would go through the fire for her if she said the word — but spare him this , only this , for he could n’t pray , had never prayed , he was ignorant of how to frame a prayer , he had no words to put it in . And yet — can any believe it?—she carried even that point , she won that incredible victory . She made La Hire pray . It shows , I think , that nothing was impossible to Joan of Arc . Yes , he stood there before her and put up his mailed hands and made a prayer . And it was not borrowed , but was his very own ; he had none to help him frame it , he made it out of his own head — saying : “
59080	60071	59078	59078	God	140	” Then he put on his helmet and marched out of Joan ’s tent as satisfied with himself as any one might be who had arranged a perplexed and difficult business to the content and admiration of all the parties concerned in the matter . If I had know that he had been praying , I could have understood why he was feeling so superior , but of course I could not know that . I was coming to the tent at that moment , and saw him come out , and saw him march away in that large fashion , and indeed it was fine and beautiful to see . But when I got to the tent door I stopped and stepped back , grieved and shocked , for I heard Joan crying , as I mistakenly thought — crying as if she could not contain nor endure the anguish of her soul , crying as if she would die . But it was not so , she was laughing — laughing at La Hire ’s prayer . It was not until six - and - thirty years afterward that I found that out , and then — oh , then I only cried when that picture of young care - free mirth rose before me out of the blur and mists of that long - vanished time ; for there had come a day between , when God ’s good gift of laughter had gone out from me to come again no more in this life . ( 1 ) This prayer has been stolen many times and by many nations in the past four hundred and sixty years , but it originated with La Hire , and the fact is of official record in the National Archives of France . We have the authority of Michelet for this.—TRANSLATOR Chapter 13 Checked by the Folly of the Wise WE MARCHED out in great strength and splendor , and took the road toward Orleans . The initial part of Joan ’s great dream was realizing itself at last . It was the first time that any of us youngsters had ever seen an army , and it was a most stately and imposing spectacle to us . It was indeed an inspiring sight , that interminable column , stretching away into the fading distances , and curving itself in and out of the crookedness of the road like a mighty serpent . Joan rode at the head of it with her personal staff ; then came a body of priests singing the Veni Creator , the banner of the Cross rising out of their midst ; after these the glinting forest of spears . The several divisions were commanded by the great Armagnac generals , La Hire , and Marshal de Boussac , the Sire de Retz , Florent d’Illiers , and Poton de Saintrailles . Each in his degree was tough , and there were three degrees — tough , tougher , toughest — and La Hire was the last by a shade , but only a shade . They were just illustrious official brigands , the whole party ; and by long habits of lawlessness they had lost all acquaintanceship with obedience , if they had ever had any . But what was the good of saying that ? These independent birds knew no law . They seldom obeyed the King ; they never obeyed him when it did n’t suit them to do it . Would they obey the Maid ? In the first place they would n’t know how to obey her or anybody else , and in the second place it was of course not possible for them to take her military character seriously — that country - girl of seventeen who had been trained for the complex and terrible business of war — how ? By tending sheep . They had no idea of obeying her except in cases where their veteran military knowledge and experience showed them that the thing she required was sound and right when gauged by the regular military standards . Were they to blame for this attitude ? I should think not . Old war - worn captains are hard - headed , practical men . They do not easily believe in the ability of ignorant children to plan campaigns and command armies . No general that ever lived could have taken Joan seriously ( militarily ) before she raised the siege of Orleans and followed it with the great campaign of the Loire . Did they consider Joan valueless ? Far from it . They valued her as the fruitful earth values the sun — they fully believed she could produce the crop , but that it was in their line of business , not hers , to take it off . They had a deep and superstitious reverence for her as being endowed with a mysterious supernatural something that was able to do a mighty thing which they were powerless to do — blow the breath of life and valor into the dead corpses of cowed armies and turn them into heroes . To their minds they were everything with her , but nothing without her . She could inspire the soldiers and fit them for battle — but fight the battle herself ? Oh , nonsense — that was their function . They , the generals , would fight the battles , Joan would give the victory . That was their idea — an unconscious paraphrase of Joan ’s reply to the Dominican . So they began by playing a deception upon her . She had a clear idea of how she meant to proceed . It was her purpose to march boldly upon Orleans by the north bank of the Loire . She gave that order to her generals . They said to themselves , “
60100	60725	60092	60098	this child who is ignorant of war	1911	” They privately sent the word to the Bastard of Orleans . He also recognized the insanity of it — at least he thought he did — and privately advised the generals to get around the order in some way . They did it by deceiving Joan . She trusted those people , she was not expecting this sort of treatment , and was not on the lookout for it . It was a lesson to her ; she saw to it that the game was not played a second time . Why was Joan ’s idea insane , from the generals ’ point of view , but not from hers ? Because her plan was to raise the siege immediately , by fighting , while theirs was to besiege the besiegers and starve them out by closing their communications — a plan which would require months in the consummation . The English had built a fence of strong fortresses called bastilles around Orleans — fortresses which closed all the gates of the city but one . To the French generals the idea of trying to fight their way past those fortresses and lead the army into Orleans was preposterous ; they believed that the result would be the army ’s destruction . One may not doubt that their opinion was militarily sound — no , would have been , but for one circumstance which they overlooked . That was this : the English soldiers were in a demoralized condition of superstitious terror ; they had become satisfied that the Maid was in league with Satan . By reason of this a good deal of their courage had oozed out and vanished . On the other hand , the Maid ’s soldiers were full of courage , enthusiasm , and zeal . Joan could have marched by the English forts . However , it was not to be . She had been cheated out of her first chance to strike a heavy blow for her country . In camp that night she slept in her armor on the ground . It was a cold night , and she was nearly as stiff as her armor itself when we resumed the march in the morning , for iron is not good material for a blanket . However , her joy in being now so far on her way to the theater of her mission was fire enough to warm her , and it soon did it . Her enthusiasm and impatience rose higher and higher with every mile of progress ; but at last we reached Olivet , and down it went , and indignation took its place . For she saw the trick that had been played upon her — the river lay between us and Orleans . She was for attacking one of the three bastilles that were on our side of the river and forcing access to the bridge which it guarded ( a project which , if successful , would raise the siege instantly ) , but the long - ingrained fear of the English came upon her generals and they implored her not to make the attempt . The soldiers wanted to attack , but had to suffer disappointment . So we moved on and came to a halt at a point opposite Checy , six miles above Orleans . Dunois , Bastard of Orleans , with a body of knights and citizens , came up from the city to welcome Joan . Joan was still burning with resentment over the trick that had been put upon her , and was not in the mood for soft speeches , even to revered military idols of her childhood . She said : “
60731	60732	60727	60727	you	1912	” “
60747	60748	60751	60751	you	1912	” “
60772	60824	60751	60751	you	1912	” Her high manner abashed him , and he was not able to answer with anything like a confident promptness , but with many hesitations and partial excuses he managed to get out the confession that for what he and the council had regarded as imperative military reasons they so advised . “
60830	60834	60751	60751	you	1912	” said Joan , “
60986	61010	60972	60975	that council of yours	1928	” Dunois and the rest fumbled around the matter a moment , then gave in and conceded that a blunder had been made . “
61019	61023	60972	60975	that council of yours	1928	” said Joan , “
61054	61167	61168	61168	You	1929	” Some of these people began to perceive that with all her technical ignorance she had practical good sense , and that with all her native sweetness and charm she was not the right kind of a person to play with . Presently God did take the blunder in hand , and by His grace the wind did change . So the fleet of boats came up and went away loaded with provisions and cattle , and conveyed that welcome succor to the hungry city , managing the matter successfully under protection of a sortie from the walls against the bastille of St. Loup . Then Joan began on the Bastard again : “
61174	61175	61171	61172	the army	3157	” “
61178	61179	61171	61172	the army	3157	” “
61192	61193	61189	61190	your council	1932	” “
61196	61197	61189	61190	your council	1932	” “
61232	61255	61206	61208	that wise council	1933	” Dunois made some wandering attempts to explain the inexplicable and excuse the inexcusable , but Joan cut him short and said : “
61275	61300	61206	61208	that wise council	1933	” The Bastard confessed that it hadn’t — that is , in view of the plan of campaign which she had devised and decreed . “
61339	61799	61802	61802	she	1944	” The whole size of the needless muddle was apparent . Evasions were of no use ; therefore Dunois admitted that there was no way to correct the blunder but to send the army all the way back to Blois , and let it begin over again and come up on the other side this time , according to Joan ’s original plan . Any other girl , after winning such a triumph as this over a veteran soldier of old renown , might have exulted a little and been excusable for it , but Joan showed no disposition of this sort . She dropped a word or two of grief over the precious time that must be lost , then began at once to issue commands for the march back . She sorrowed to see her army go ; for she said its heart was great and its enthusiasm high , and that with it at her back she did not fear to face all the might of England . All arrangements having been completed for the return of the main body of the army , she took the Bastard and La Hire and a thousand men and went down to Orleans , where all the town was in a fever of impatience to have sight of her face . It was eight in the evening when she and the troops rode in at the Burgundy gate , with the Paladin preceding her with her standard . She was riding a white horse , and she carried in her hand the sacred sword of Fierbois . You should have seen Orleans then . What a picture it was ! Such black seas of people , such a starry firmament of torches , such roaring whirlwinds of welcome , such booming of bells and thundering of cannon ! It was as if the world was come to an end . Everywhere in the glare of the torches one saw rank upon rank of upturned white faces , the mouths wide open , shouting , and the unchecked tears running down ; Joan forged her slow way through the solid masses , her mailed form projecting above the pavement of heads like a silver statue . The people about her struggled along , gazing up at her through their tears with the rapt look of men and women who believe they are seeing one who is divine ; and always her feet were being kissed by grateful folk , and such as failed of that privilege touched her horse and then kissed their fingers . Nothing that Joan did escaped notice ; everything she did was commented upon and applauded . You could hear the remarks going all the time . “
61808	61809	61802	61802	she	1944	” “
61830	61831	61832	61832	She	1944	” “
61844	61845	61841	61841	her	1944	” “
61881	61882	61856	61856	her	1944	” “
61905	61906	61901	61901	she	1948	” “
61927	61958	61959	61959	She	1944	” Joan ’s slender long banner streaming backward had an accident — the fringe caught fire from a torch . She leaned forward and crushed the flame in her hand . “
61968	62885	61901	61901	she	1948	” they shouted , and delivered a storm of admiring applause that made everything quake . She rode to the cathedral and gave thanks to God , and the people crammed the place and added their devotions to hers ; then she took up her march again and picked her slow way through the crowds and the wilderness of torches to the house of Jacques Boucher , treasurer of the Duke of Orleans , where she was to be the guest of his wife as long as she stayed in the city , and have his young daughter for comrade and room - mate . The delirium of the people went on the rest of the night , and with it the clamor of the joy - bells and the welcoming cannon . Joan of Arc had stepped upon her stage at last , and was ready to begin . Chapter 14 What the English Answered SHE WAS ready , but must sit down and wait until there was an army to work with . Next morning , Saturday , April 30 , 1429 , she set about inquiring after the messenger who carried her proclamation to the English from Blois — the one which she had dictated at Poitiers . Here is a copy of it . It is a remarkable document , for several reasons : for its matter - of - fact directness , for its high spirit and forcible diction , and for its naive confidence in her ability to achieve the prodigious task which she had laid upon herself , or which had been laid upon her — which you please . All through it you seem to see the pomps of war and hear the rumbling of the drums . In it Joan ’s warrior soul is revealed , and for the moment the soft little shepherdess has disappeared from your view . This untaught country - damsel , unused to dictating anything at all to anybody , much less documents of state to kings and generals , poured out this procession of vigorous sentences as fluently as if this sort of work had been her trade from childhood : JESUS MARIA King of England and you Duke of Bedford who call yourself Regent of France ; William de la Pole , Earl of Suffolk ; and you Thomas Lord Scales , who style yourselves lieutenants of the said Bedford — do right to the King of Heaven . Render to the Maid who is sent by God the keys of all the good towns you have taken and violated in France . She is sent hither by God , to restore the blood royal . She is very ready to make peace if you will do her right by giving up France and paying for what you have held . And you archers , companions of war , noble and otherwise , who are before the good city of Orleans , begone into your own land in God ’s name , or expect news from the Maid who will shortly go to see you to your very great hurt . King of England , if you do not so , I am chief of war , and whenever I shall find your people in France , I will drive them out , willing or not willing ; and if they do not obey I will slay them all , but if they obey , I will have them to mercy . I am come hither by God , the King of Heaven , body for body , to put you out of France , in spite of those who would work treason and mischief against the kingdom . Think not you shall ever hold the kingdom from the King of Heaven , the Son of the Blessed Mary ; King Charles shall hold it , for God wills it so , and has revealed it to him by the Maid . If you believe not the news sent by God through the Maid , wherever we shall meet you we will strike boldly and make such a noise as has not been in France these thousand years . Be sure that God can send more strength to the Maid than you can bring to any assault against her and her good men - at - arms ; and then we shall see who has the better right , the King of Heaven , or you . Duke of Bedford , the Maid prays you not to bring about your own destruction . If you do her right , you may yet go in her company where the French shall do the finest deed that has been done in Christendom , and if you do not , you shall be reminded shortly of your great wrongs . In that closing sentence she invites them to go on crusade with her to rescue the Holy Sepulcher . No answer had been returned to this proclamation , and the messenger himself had not come back . So now she sent her two heralds with a new letter warning the English to raise the siege and requiring them to restore that missing messenger . The heralds came back without him . All they brought was notice from the English to Joan that they would presently catch her and burn her if she did not clear out now while she had a chance , and “
62896	62923	62926	62926	she	1951	” She held her peace , only saying it was a pity that the English would persist in inviting present disaster and eventual destruction when she was “
62943	62961	62926	62926	she	1951	” Presently she thought of an arrangement that might be acceptable , and said to the heralds , “
63017	64613	63004	63004	you	215	” I did not hear this , but Dunois did , and spoke of it . The challenge was refused . Sunday morning her Voices or some instinct gave her a warning , and she sent Dunois to Blois to take command of the army and hurry it to Orleans . It was a wise move , for he found Regnault de Chartres and some more of the King ’s pet rascals there trying their best to disperse the army , and crippling all the efforts of Joan ’s generals to head it for Orleans . They were a fine lot , those miscreants . They turned their attention to Dunois now , but he had balked Joan once , with unpleasant results to himself , and was not minded to meddle in that way again . He soon had the army moving . Chapter 15 My Exquisite Poem Goes to Smash WE OF the personal staff were in fairyland now , during the few days that we waited for the return of the army . We went into society . To our two knights this was not a novelty , but to us young villagers it was a new and wonderful life . Any position of any sort near the person of the Maid of Vaucouleurs conferred high distinction upon the holder and caused his society to be courted ; and so the D’Arc brothers , and Noel , and the Paladin , humble peasants at home , were gentlemen here , personages of weight and influence . It was fine to see how soon their country diffidences and awkwardnesses melted away under this pleasant sun of deference and disappeared , and how lightly and easily they took to their new atmosphere . The Paladin was as happy as it was possible for any one in this earth to be . His tongue went all the time , and daily he got new delight out of hearing himself talk . He began to enlarge his ancestry and spread it out all around , and ennoble it right and left , and it was not long until it consisted almost entirely of dukes . He worked up his old battles and tricked them out with fresh splendors ; also with new terrors , for he added artillery now . We had seen cannon for the first time at Blois — a few pieces — here there was plenty of it , and now and then we had the impressive spectacle of a huge English bastille hidden from sight in a mountain of smoke from its own guns , with lances of red flame darting through it ; and this grand picture , along with the quaking thunders pounding away in the heart of it , inflamed the Paladin ’s imagination and enabled him to dress out those ambuscade - skirmishes of ours with a sublimity which made it impossible for any to recognize them at all except people who had not been there . You may suspect that there was a special inspiration for these great efforts of the Paladin ’s , and there was . It was the daughter of the house , Catherine Boucher , who was eighteen , and gentle and lovely in her ways , and very beautiful . I think she might have been as beautiful as Joan herself , if she had had Joan ’s eyes . But that could never be . There was never but that one pair , there will never be another . Joan ’s eyes were deep and rich and wonderful beyond anything merely earthly . They spoke all the languages — they had no need of words . They produced all effects — and just by a glance , just a single glance ; a glance that could convict a liar of his lie and make him confess it ; that could bring down a proud man ’s pride and make him humble ; that could put courage into a coward and strike dead the courage of the bravest ; that could appease resentments and real hatreds ; that could make the doubter believe and the hopeless hope again ; that could purify the impure mind ; that could persuade — ah , there it is — persuasion ! that is the word ; what or who is it that it could n’t persuade ? The maniac of Domremy — the fairy - banishing priest — the reverend tribunal of Toul — the doubting and superstitious Laxart — the obstinate veteran of Vaucouleurs — the characterless heir of France — the sages and scholars of the Parliament and University of Poitiers — the darling of Satan , La Hire — the masterless Bastard of Orleans , accustomed to acknowledge no way as right and rational but his own — these were the trophies of that great gift that made her the wonder and mystery that she was . We mingled companionably with the great folk who flocked to the big house to make Joan ’s acquaintance , and they made much of us and we lived in the clouds , so to speak . But what we preferred even to this happiness was the quieter occasions , when the formal guests were gone and the family and a few dozen of its familiar friends were gathered together for a social good time . It was then that we did our best , we five youngsters , with such fascinations as we had , and the chief object of them was Catherine . None of us had ever been in love before , and now we had the misfortune to all fall in love with the same person at the same time — which was the first moment we saw her . She was a merry heart , and full of life , and I still remember tenderly those few evenings that I was permitted to have my share of her dear society and of comradeship with that little company of charming people . The Paladin made us all jealous the first night , for when he got fairly started on those battles of his he had everything to himself , and there was no use in anybody else ’s trying to get any attention . Those people had been living in the midst of real war for seven months ; and to hear this windy giant lay out his imaginary campaigns and fairly swim in blood and spatter it all around , entertained them to the verge of the grave . Catherine was like to die , for pure enjoyment . She did n’t laugh loud — we , of course , wished she would — but kept in the shelter of a fan , and shook until there was danger that she would unhitch her ribs from her spine . Then when the Paladin had got done with a battle and we began to feel thankful and hope for a change , she would speak up in a way that was so sweet and persuasive that it rankled in me , and ask him about some detail or other in the early part of his battle which she said had greatly interested her , and would he be so good as to describe that part again and with a little more particularity?—which of course precipitated the whole battle on us , again , with a hundred lies added that had been overlooked before . I do not know how to make you realize the pain I suffered . I had never been jealous before , and it seemed intolerable that this creature should have this good fortune which he was so ill entitled to , and I have to sit and see myself neglected when I was so longing for the least little attention out of the thousand that this beloved girl was lavishing on him . I was near her , and tried two or three times to get started on some of the things that I had done in those battles — and I felt ashamed of myself , too , for stooping to such a business — but she cared for nothing but his battles , and could not be got to listen ; and presently when one of my attempts caused her to lose some precious rag or other of his mendacities and she asked him to repeat , thus bringing on a new engagement , of course , and increasing the havoc and carnage tenfold , I felt so humiliated by this pitiful miscarriage of mine that I gave up and tried no more . The others were as outraged by the Paladin ’s selfish conduct as I was — and by his grand luck , too , of course — perhaps , indeed , that was the main hurt . We talked our trouble over together , which was natural , for rivals become brothers when a common affliction assails them and a common enemy bears off the victory . Each of us could do things that would please and get notice if it were not for this person , who occupied all the time and gave others no chance . I had made a poem , taking a whole night to it — a poem in which I most happily and delicately celebrated that sweet girl ’s charms , without mentioning her name , but any one could see who was meant ; for the bare title—“The
64616	66330	63004	63004	you	215	Orleans”—would reveal that , as it seemed to me . It pictured this pure and dainty white rose as growing up out of the rude soil of war and looking abroad out of its tender eyes upon the horrid machinery of death , and then — note this conceit — it blushes for the sinful nature of man , and turns red in a single night . Becomes a red rose , you see — a rose that was white before . The idea was my own , and quite new . Then it sent its sweet perfume out over the embattled city , and when the beleaguering forces smelt it they laid down their arms and wept . This was also my own idea , and new . That closed that part of the poem ; then I put her into the similitude of the firmament — not the whole of it , but only part . That is to say , she was the moon , and all the constellations were following her about , their hearts in flames for love of her , but she would not halt , she would not listen , for ’ twas thought she loved another . ’ Twas thought she loved a poor unworthy suppliant who was upon the earth , facing danger , death , and possible mutilation in the bloody field , waging relentless war against a heartless foe to save her from an all too early grave , and her city from destruction . And when the sad pursuing constellations came to know and realize the bitter sorrow that was come upon them — note this idea — their hearts broke and their tears gushed forth , filling the vault of heaven with a fiery splendor , for those tears were falling stars . It was a rash idea , but beautiful ; beautiful and pathetic ; wonderfully pathetic , the way I had it , with the rhyme and all to help . At the end of each verse there was a two - line refrain pitying the poor earthly lover separated so far , and perhaps forever , from her he loved so well , and growing always paler and weaker and thinner in his agony as he neared the cruel grave — the most touching thing — even the boys themselves could hardly keep back their tears , the way Noel said those lines . There were eight four - line stanzas in the first end of the poem — the end about the rose , the horticultural end , as you may say , if that is not too large a name for such a little poem — and eight in the astronomical end — sixteen stanzas altogether , and I could have made it a hundred and fifty if I had wanted to , I was so inspired and so all swelled up with beautiful thoughts and fancies ; but that would have been too many to sing or recite before a company that way , whereas sixteen was just right , and could be done over again if desired . The boys were amazed that I could make such a poem as that out of my own head , and so was I , of course , it being as much a surprise to me as it could be to anybody , for I did not know that it was in me . If any had asked me a single day before if it was in me , I should have told them frankly no , it was not . That is the way with us ; we may go on half of our life not knowing such a thing is in us , when in reality it was there all the time , and all we needed was something to turn up that would call for it . Indeed , it was always so without family . My grandfather had a cancer , and they never knew what was the matter with him till he died , and he did n’t know himself . It is wonderful how gifts and diseases can be concealed in that way . All that was necessary in my case was for this lovely and inspiring girl to cross my path , and out came the poem , and no more trouble to me to word it and rhyme it and perfect it than it is to stone a dog . No , I should have said it was not in me ; but it was . The boys could n’t say enough about it , they were so charmed and astonished . The thing that pleased them the most was the way it would do the Paladin ’s business for him . They forgot everything in their anxiety to get him shelved and silenced . Noel Rainguesson was clear beside himself with admiration of the poem , and wished he could do such a thing , but it was out of his line , and he could n’t , of course . He had it by heart in half an hour , and there was never anything so pathetic and beautiful as the way he recited it . For that was just his gift — that and mimicry . He could recite anything better than anybody in the world , and he could take of La Hire to the very life — or anybody else , for that matter . Now I never could recite worth a farthing ; and when I tried with this poem the boys would n’t let me finish ; they would have nobody but Noel . So then , as I wanted the poem to make the best possible impression on Catherine and the company , I told Noel he might do the reciting . Never was anybody so delighted . He could hardly believe that I was in earnest , but I was . I said that to have them know that I was the author of it would be enough for me . The boys were full of exultation , and Noel said if he could just get one chance at those people it would be all he would ask ; he would make them realize that there was something higher and finer than war - lies to be had here . But how to get the opportunity — that was the difficulty . We invented several schemes that promised fairly , and at last we hit upon one that was sure . That was , to let the Paladin get a good start in a manufactured battle , and then send in a false call for him , and as soon as he was out of the room , have Noel take his place and finish the battle himself in the Paladin ’s own style , imitated to a shade . That would get great applause , and win the house ’s favor and put it in the right mood to hear the poem . The two triumphs together with finish the Standard - Bearer — modify him , anyway , to a certainty , and give the rest of us a chance for the future . So the next night I kept out of the way until the Paladin had got his start and was sweeping down upon the enemy like a whirlwind at the head of his corps , then I stepped within the door in my official uniform and announced that a messenger from General La Hire ’s quarters desired speech with the Standard - Bearer . He left the room , and Noel took his place and said that the interruption was to be deplored , but that fortunately he was personally acquainted with the details of the battle himself , and if permitted would be glad to state them to the company . Then without waiting for the permission he turned himself to the Paladin — a dwarfed Paladin , of course — with manner , tones , gestures , attitudes , everything exact , and went right on with the battle , and it would be impossible to imagine a more perfectly and minutely ridiculous imitation than he furnished to those shrieking people . They went into spasms , convulsions , frenzies of laughter , and the tears flowed down their cheeks in rivulets . The more they laughed , the more inspired Noel grew with his theme and the greater marvels he worked , till really the laughter was not properly laughing any more , but screaming . Blessedest feature of all , Catherine Boucher was dying with ecstasies , and presently there was little left of her but gasps and suffocations . Victory ? It was a perfect Agincourt . The Paladin was gone only a couple of minutes ; he found out at once that a trick had been played on him , so he came back . When he approached the door he heard Noel ranting in there and recognized the state of the case ; so he remained near the door but out of sight , and heard the performance through to the end . The applause Noel got when he finished was wonderful ; and they kept it up and kept it up , clapping their hands like mad , and shouting to him to do it over again . But Noel was clever . He knew the very best background for a poem of deep and refined sentiment and pathetic melancholy was one where great and satisfying merriment had prepared the spirit for the powerful contrast . So he paused until all was quiet , then his face grew grave and assumed an impressive aspect , and at once all faces sobered in sympathy and took on a look of wondering and expectant interest . Now he began in a low but distinct voice the opening verses of The Rose . As he breathed the rhythmic measures forth , and one gracious line after another fell upon those enchanted ears in that deep hush , one could catch , on every hand , half - audible ejaculations of “
66340	67026	63004	63004	you	215	” By this time the Paladin , who had gone away for a moment with the opening of the poem , was back again , and had stepped within the door . He stood there now , resting his great frame against the wall and gazing toward the reciter like one entranced . When Noel got to the second part , and that heart - breaking refrain began to melt and move all listeners , the Paladin began to wipe away tears with the back of first one hand and then the other . The next time the refrain was repeated he got to snuffling , and sort of half sobbing , and went to wiping his eyes with the sleeves of his doublet . He was so conspicuous that he embarrassed Noel a little , and also had an ill effect upon the audience . With the next repetition he broke quite down and began to cry like a calf , which ruined all the effect and started many to the audience to laughing . Then he went on from bad to worse , until I never saw such a spectacle ; for he fetched out a towel from under his doublet and began to swab his eyes with it and let go the most infernal bellowings mixed up with sobbings and groanings and retchings and barkings and coughings and snortings and screamings and howlings — and he twisted himself about on his heels and squirmed this way and that , still pouring out that brutal clamor and flourishing his towel in the air and swabbing again and wringing it out . Hear ? You could n’t hear yourself think . Noel was wholly drowned out and silenced , and those people were laughing the very lungs out of themselves . It was the most degrading sight that ever was . Now I heard the clankety - clank that plate - armor makes when the man that is in it is running , and then alongside my head there burst out the most inhuman explosion of laughter that ever rent the drum of a person ’s ear , and I looked , and it was La Hire ; and the stood there with his gauntlets on his hips and his head tilted back and his jaws spread to that degree to let out his hurricanes and his thunders that it amounted to indecent exposure , for you could see everything that was in him . Only one thing more and worse could happen , and it happened : at the other door I saw the flurry and bustle and bowings and scrapings of officials and flunkeys which means that some great personage is coming — then Joan of Arc stepped in , and the house rose ! Yes , and tried to shut its indecorous mouth and make itself grave and proper ; but when it saw the Maid herself go to laughing , it thanked God for this mercy and the earthquake that followed . Such things make a life of bitterness , and I do not wish to dwell upon them . The effect of the poem was spoiled . Chapter 16 The Finding of the Dwarf THIS EPISODE disagreed with me and I was not able to leave my bed the next day . The others were in the same condition . But for this , one or another of us might have had the good luck that fell to the Paladin ’s share that day ; but it is observable that God in His compassion sends the good luck to such as are ill equipped with gifts , as compensation for their defect , but requires such as are more fortunately endowed to get by labor and talent what those others get by chance . It was Noel who said this , and it seemed to me to be well and justly thought . The Paladin , going about the town all the day in order to be followed and admired and overhear the people say in an awed voice , “
67041	67096	63004	63004	you	215	” had speech with all sorts and conditions of folk , and he learned from some boatmen that there was a stir of some kind going on in the bastilles on the other side of the river ; and in the evening , seeking further , he found a deserter from the fortress called the “
67099	67159	63004	63004	you	215	” who said that the English were going to send me over to strengthen the garrisons on our side during the darkness of the night , and were exulting greatly , for they meant to spring upon Dunois and the army when it was passing the bastilles and destroy it ; a thing quite easy to do , since the “
67161	67262	63004	63004	you	215	” would not be there , and without her presence the army would do like the French armies of these many years past — drop their weapons and run when they saw an English face . It was ten at night when the Paladin brought this news and asked leave to speak to Joan , and I was up and on duty then . It was a bitter stroke to me to see what a chance I had lost . Joan made searching inquiries , and satisfied herself that the word was true , then she made this annoying remark : “
67293	67335	63004	63004	you	215	” Then he bowed low , and when he rose he was eleven feet high . As he swelled out past me he covertly pulled down the corner of his eye with his finger and muttered part of that defiled refrain , “
67362	67810	67356	67357	the King	270	” I wished Joan could have seen his conduct , but she was busy thinking what she would do . Then she had me fetch the knight Jean de Metz , and in a minute he was off for La Hire ’s quarters with orders for him and the Lord de Villars and Florent d’Illiers to report to her at five o’clock next morning with five hundred picked men well mounted . The histories say half past four , but it is not true , I heard the order given . We were on our way at five to the minute , and encountered the head of the arriving column between six and seven , a couple of leagues from the city . Dunois was pleased , for the army had begun to get restive and show uneasiness now that it was getting so near to the dreaded bastilles . But that all disappeared now , as the word ran down the line , with a huzza that swept along the length of it like a wave , that the Maid was come . Dunois asked her to halt and let the column pass in review , so that the men could be sure that the reports of her presence was not a ruse to revive their courage . So she took position at the side of the road with her staff , and the battalions swung by with a martial stride , huzzaing . Joan was armed , except her head . She was wearing the cunning little velvet cap with the mass of curved white ostrich plumes tumbling over its edges which the city of Orleans had given her the night she arrived — the one that is in the picture that hangs in the Hotel de Ville at Rouen . She was looking about fifteen . The sight of soldiers always set her blood to leaping , and lit the fires in her eyes and brought the warm rich color to her cheeks ; it was then that you saw that she was too beautiful to be of the earth , or at any rate that there was a subtle something somewhere about her beauty that differed it from the human types of your experience and exalted it above them . In the train of wains laden with supplies a man lay on top of the goods . He was stretched out on his back , and his hands were tied together with ropes , and also his ankles . Joan signed to the officer in charge of that division of the train to come to her , and he rode up and saluted . “
67819	67823	67824	67825	A prisoner	1961	” she asked . “
67829	67830	67827	67827	General	1962	” “
67836	67837	67838	67838	He	1959	” “
67843	67844	67840	67841	a deserter	1963	” “
67853	67854	67855	67855	He	1959	” “
67875	67876	67855	67855	He	1959	” “
67882	67883	67855	67855	He	1959	” “
67933	67934	67926	67926	he	1959	” “
67946	67947	67942	67942	his	1959	” “
67957	67958	67953	67953	his	1959	” “
67972	68099	67965	67965	God	140	” The officer rode forward and loosed the man ’s feet and brought him back with his hands still tied . What a figure he was — a good seven feet high , and built for business ! He had a strong face ; he had an unkempt shock of black hair which showed up a striking way when the officer removed his morion for him ; for weapon he had a big ax in his broad leathern belt . Standing by Joan ’s horse , he made Joan look littler than ever , for his head was about on a level with her own . His face was profoundly melancholy ; all interest in life seemed to be dead in the man . Joan said : “
68105	68176	68102	68102	your	1968	” The man ’s head was down . He lifted it when he heard that soft friendly voice , and there was a wistful something in his face which made one think that there had been music in it for him and that he would like to hear it again . When he raised his hands Joan laid her sword to his bonds , but the officer said with apprehension : “
68184	68185	68179	68179	madam	1969	” “
68190	68194	68179	68179	madam	1969	” she said . “
68200	68201	68204	68204	I	0	” “
68212	68231	68207	68207	I	0	” ; and she cut the bonds . They had lacerated his wrists , and they were bleeding . “
68236	68240	68207	68207	I	0	” she said ; “
68248	68263	68268	68268	somebody	636	” ; and she shrank from the sight . But only for a moment . “
68276	68281	68268	68268	somebody	636	” The officer said : “
68300	68301	68293	68293	me	0	” “
68360	68602	68629	68629	I	0	” The man looked on silent , while he was being bandaged , stealing a furtive glance at Joan ’s face occasionally , such as an animal might that is receiving a kindness form an unexpected quarter and is gropingly trying to reconcile the act with its source . All the staff had forgotten the huzzaing army drifting by in its rolling clouds of dust , to crane their necks and watch the bandaging as if it was the most interesting and absorbing novelty that ever was . I have often seen people do like that — get entirely lost in the simplest trifle , when it is something that is out of their line . Now there in Poitiers , once , I saw two bishops and a dozen of those grave and famous scholars grouped together watching a man paint a sign on a shop ; they did n’t breathe , they were as good as dead ; and when it began to sprinkle they did n’t know it at first ; then they noticed it , and each man hove a deep sigh , and glanced up with a surprised look as wondering to see the others there , and how he came to be there himself — but that is the way with people , as I have said . There is no way of accounting for people . You have to take them as they are . “
68605	68616	68629	68629	I	0	” said Joan at last , pleased with her success ; “
68645	68650	68638	68638	you	1978	” The giant said : “
68872	68885	68866	68866	I	0	” Joan said , musingly , as if she were thinking aloud : “
68923	68933	68934	68934	I	0	” She turned suddenly to the man and said , “
68943	68958	68959	68960	This man	692	” The eyes of the two met , and Joan said to the officer , “
68973	68981	68983	68983	you	0	” Then she said to the man , “
68995	68996	68983	68983	you	0	” “
68999	69003	68983	68983	you	0	” he said , “
69008	69009	69004	69004	I	0	” “
69017	69025	69013	69013	you	0	” The man said , quite simply : “
69044	69045	69013	69013	you	0	” “
69084	69085	69086	69086	I	0	” “
69089	69095	69086	69086	I	0	you!”—“you shall fight for France — ”
69096	69103	69086	69086	I	0	“ I will fight for you ! ”
69104	69112	69086	69086	I	0	“ You shall be France ’s soldier — ”
69113	69118	69086	69086	I	0	“ I will be your soldier!”—“you
69127	69128	69122	69122	your	0	” “
69196	69235	69184	69184	You	4	” Joan smiled , and was touched and pleased at the man ’s grave enthusiasm — solemn enthusiasm , one may call it , for the manner of it was deeper than mere gravity — and she said : “
69250	69258	69247	69247	you	0	” The man answered with unsmiling simplicity : “
69276	69286	69287	69287	It	1994	” It made Joan laugh , and she said : “
69304	69328	69259	69259	They	1992	” The soldier replied with the same gravity — which must have been born to him , it sat upon him so naturally : “
69338	69346	69259	69259	They	1992	” Joan laughed again , and said : “
69353	69354	69348	69348	you	0	” “
69363	69364	69348	69348	you	0	” “
69374	69375	69365	69366	The pupils	1996	” “
69388	69389	69365	69366	The pupils	1996	” “
69417	69418	69410	69410	sentinel	1998	” “
69423	69424	69410	69410	sentinel	1998	” “
69459	70551	70552	70552	Bastard	2001	” That is how we came by the Dwarf ; and a good fellow he was . Joan picked him out on sight , but it was n’t a mistake ; no one could be faithfuler than he was , and he was a devil and the son of a devil when he turned himself loose with his ax . He was so big that he made the Paladin look like an ordinary man . He liked to like people , therefore people liked him . He liked us boys from the start ; and he liked the knights , and liked pretty much everybody he came across ; but he thought more of a paring of Joan ’s finger - nail than he did of all the rest of the world put together . Yes , that is where we got him — stretched on the wain , going to his death , poor chap , and nobody to say a good word for him . He was a good find . Why , the knights treated him almost like an equal — it is the honest truth ; that is the sort of a man he was . They called him the Bastille sometimes , and sometimes they called him Hellfire , which was on account of his warm and sumptuous style in battle , and you know they would n’t have given him pet names if they had n’t had a good deal of affection for him . To the Dwarf , Joan was France , the spirit of France made flesh — he never got away from that idea that he had started with ; and God knows it was the true one . That was a humble eye to see so great a truth where some others failed . To me that seems quite remarkable . And yet , after all , it was , in a way , just what nations do . When they love a great and noble thing , they embody it — they want it so that they can see it with their eyes ; like liberty , for instance . They are not content with the cloudy abstract idea , they make a beautiful statue of it , and then their beloved idea is substantial and they can look at it and worship it . And so it is as I say ; to the Dwarf , Joan was our country embodied , our country made visible flesh cast in a gracious form . When she stood before others , they saw Joan of Arc , but he saw France . Sometimes he would speak of her by that name . It shows you how the idea was embedded in his mind , and how real it was to him . The world has called our kings by it , but I know of none of them who has had so good a right as she to that sublime title . When the march past was finished , Joan returned to the front and rode at the head of the column . When we began to file past those grim bastilles and could glimpse the men within , standing to their guns and ready to empty death into our ranks , such a faintness came over me and such a sickness that all things seemed to turn dim and swim before my eyes ; and the other boys looked droopy , too , I thought — including the Paladin , although I do not know this for certain , because he was ahead of me and I had to keep my eyes out toward the bastille side , because I could wince better when I saw what to wince at . But Joan was at home — in Paradise , I might say . She sat up straight , and I could see that she was feeling different from me . The awfulest thing was the silence ; there was n’t a sound but the screaking of the saddles , the measured tramplings , and the sneezing of the horses , afflicted by the smothering dust - clouds which they kicked up . I wanted to sneeze myself , but it seemed to me that I would rather go unsneezed , or suffer even a bitterer torture , if there is one , than attract attention to myself . I was not of a rank to make suggestions , or I would have suggested that if we went faster we should get by sooner . It seemed to me that it was an ill - judged time to be taking a walk . Just as we were drifting in that suffocating stillness past a great cannon that stood just within a raised portcullis , with nothing between me and it but the moat , a most uncommon jackass in there split the world with his bray , and I fell out of the saddle . Sir Bertrand grabbed me as I went , which was well , for if I had gone to the ground in my armor I could not have gotten up again by myself . The English warders on the battlements laughed a coarse laugh , forgetting that every one must begin , and that there had been a time when they themselves would have fared no better when shot by a jackass . The English never uttered a challenge nor fired a shot . It was said afterward that when their men saw the Maid riding at the front and saw how lovely she was , their eager courage cooled down in many cases and vanished in the rest , they feeling certain that the creature was not mortal , but the very child of Satan , and so the officers were prudent and did not try to make them fight . It was said also that some of the officers were affected by the same superstitious fears . Well , in any case , they never offered to molest us , and we poked by all the grisly fortresses in peace . During the march I caught up on my devotions , which were in arrears ; so it was not all loss and no profit for me after all . It was on this march that the histories say Dunois told Joan that the English were expecting reinforcements under the command of Sir John Fastolfe , and that she turned upon him and said : “
70591	71027	71028	71028	God	140	” It may be so ; I do n’t deny it ; but I did n’t her it . If she really said it I think she only meant she would take off his official head — degrade him from his command . It was not like her to threaten a comrade ’s life . She did have her doubts of her generals , and was entitled to them , for she was all for storm and assault , and they were for holding still and tiring the English out . Since they did not believe in her way and were experienced old soldiers , it would be natural for them to prefer their own and try to get around carrying hers out . But I did hear something that the histories did n’t mention and do n’t know about . I heard Joan say that now that the garrisons on the other wide had been weakened to strengthen those on our side , the most effective point of operations had shifted to the south shore ; so she meant to go over there and storm the forts which held the bridge end , and that would open up communication with our own dominions and raise the siege . The generals began to balk , privately , right away , but they only baffled and delayed her , and that for only four days . All Orleans met the army at the gate and huzzaed it through the bannered streets to its various quarters , but nobody had to rock it to sleep ; it slumped down dog - tired , for Dunois had rushed it without mercy , and for the next twenty - four hours it would be quiet , all but the snoring . Chapter 17 Sweet Fruit of Bitter Truth WHEN WE got home , breakfast for us minor fry was waiting in our mess - room and the family honored us by coming in to eat it with us . The nice old treasurer , and in fact all three were flatteringly eager to hear about our adventures . Nobody asked the Paladin to begin , but he did begin , because now that his specially ordained and peculiar military rank set him above everybody on the personal staff but old D’Aulon , who did n’t eat with us , he did n’t care a farthing for the knights ’ nobility no mine , but took precedence in the talk whenever it suited him , which was all the time , because he was born that way . He said : “
71051	71052	71053	71053	Animals	225	” “
71055	71060	71061	71061	I	0	” said Miss Catherine . “
71070	71074	71075	71075	He	2006	” said Noel . “
71077	71078	71075	71075	He	2006	” “
71093	71100	71079	71079	I	0	” said the Paladin , loftily . “
71107	71108	71101	71101	I	0	” “
71114	71118	71111	71111	his	2006	” said Noel ; “
71167	71168	71159	71159	He	2006	” “
71175	71179	71159	71159	He	2006	” Catherine asked . “
71182	71205	71159	71159	He	2006	” I said , seeing my chance to help . But it was not a fortunate remark , for the Paladin said : “
71230	71249	71298	71298	you	2010	” They all laughed , and I was ashamed of myself for my hasty smartness . I said : “
71278	71279	71298	71298	you	2010	” “
71305	71306	71298	71298	you	2010	” “
71411	71443	71500	71500	I	0	” It was as straight and sensible a speech as ever I heard , and I was grateful for the opening it gave me ; so I came out and said : “
71458	71459	71450	71450	you	2010	” “
71469	71475	71500	71500	I	0	” said the old treasurer ; “
71484	71496	71476	71476	you	0	” That made me comfortable , and when Miss Catherine said , “
71505	71523	71500	71500	I	0	” I was grateful to myself for getting into that scrape . Sir Jean de Metz said : “
71562	71666	71500	71500	I	0	” He looked about him with a pleasant expression of inquiry on his good face , and as each pair of eyes in turn met his head they were in nodded a confession . Even the Paladin delivered his nod . That surprised everybody , and saved the Standard - Bearer ’s credit . It was clever of him ; nobody believed he could tell the truth that way without practice , or would tell that particular sort of a truth either with or without practice . I suppose he judged it would favorably impress the family . Then the old treasurer said : “
71706	71707	71700	71703	the Standard - Bearer	3534	” “
71734	71735	71737	71737	you	2019	” “
71739	71745	71737	71737	you	2019	” exclaimed the young lady . “
71760	71935	71758	71758	you	2019	” She was so eager and pretty that the Paladin said straight out that he would ; and then as none of the rest had bravery enough to expose the fear that was in him , one volunteered after the other with a prompt mouth and a sick heart till all were shipped for the voyage ; then the girl clapped her hands in glee , and the parents were gratified , too , saying that the ghosts of their house had been a dread and a misery to them and their forebears for generations , and nobody had ever been found yet who was willing to confront them and find out what their trouble was , so that the family could heal it and content the poor specters and beguile them to tranquillity and peace . Chapter 18 Joan ’s First Battle - Field ABOUT NOON I was chatting with Madame Boucher ; nothing was going on , all was quiet , when Catherine Boucher suddenly entered in great excitement , and said : “
72065	72098	72178	72178	your	0	” I started on a run , saying , sarcastically — for I was always fond of sarcasm , and it was said that I had a most neat gift that way : “
72113	72137	72178	72179	your Excellency	2648	” At the furthest end of the house I met Joan , fully armed , hurrying toward the door , and she said : “
72153	72154	72147	72147	you	0	” “
72162	72166	72156	72156	I	0	” I said ; “
72181	72182	72183	72183	You	0	” “
72194	72336	72183	72183	You	0	” she said , and was gone . It was true . Before one could count five there broke upon the stillness the swelling rush and tramp of an approaching multitude of men and horses , with hoarse cries of command ; and then out of the distance came the muffled deep boom!—boom - boom!—boom ! of cannon , and straightway that rushing multitude was roaring by the house like a hurricane . Our knights and all our staff came flying , armed , but with no horses ready , and we burst out after Joan in a body , the Paladin in the lead with the banner . The surging crowd was made up half of citizens and half of soldiers , and had no recognized leader . When Joan was seen a huzza went up , and she shouted : “
72343	72363	72183	72183	You	0	” A dozen saddles were at her disposal in a moment . She mounted , a hundred people shouting : “
72375	72424	72178	72179	your Excellency	2648	” The first time that that immortal name was ever uttered — and I , praise God , was there to hear it ! The mass divided itself like the waters of the Red Sea , and down this lane Joan went skimming like a bird , crying , “
72433	72632	72431	72431	me	0	” and we came winging in her wake on the rest of the borrowed horses , the holy standard streaming above us , and the lane closing together in our rear . This was a different thing from the ghastly march past the dismal bastilles . No , we felt fine , now , and all awhirl with enthusiasm . The explanation of this sudden uprising was this . The city and the little garrison , so long hopeless and afraid , had gone wild over Joan ’s coming , and could no longer restrain their desire to get at the enemy ; so , without orders from anybody , a few hundred soldiers and citizens had plunged out at the Burgundy gate on a sudden impulse and made a charge on one of Lord Talbot ’s most formidable fortresses — St. Loup — and were getting the worst of it . The news of this had swept through the city and started this new crowd that we were with . As we poured out at the gate we met a force bringing in the wounded from the front . The sight moved Joan , and she said : “
72647	72705	72706	72710	witches ” were not around	3763	” We were soon on the field , soon in the midst of the turmoil . Joan was seeing her first real battle , and so were we . It was a battle in the open field ; for the garrison of St. Loup had sallied confidently out to meet the attack , being used to victories when “
72707	72721	72757	72757	men	282	” were not around . The sally had been reinforced by troops from the “
72723	72754	72757	72757	men	282	” bastille , and when we approached the French were getting whipped and were falling back . But when Joan came charging through the disorder with her banner displayed , crying “
72762	73279	72757	72757	men	282	” there was a change ; the French turned about and surged forward like a solid wave of the sea , and swept the English before them , hacking and slashing , and being hacked and slashed , in a way that was terrible to see . In the field the Dwarf had no assignment ; that is to say , he was not under orders to occupy any particular place , therefore he chose his place for himself , and went ahead of Joan and made a road for her . It was horrible to see the iron helmets fly into fragments under his dreadful ax . He called it cracking nuts , and it looked like that . He made a good road , and paved it well with flesh and iron . Joan and the rest of us followed it so briskly that we outspeeded our forces and had the English behind us as well as before . The knights commanded us to face outward around Joan , which we did , and then there was work done that was fine to see . One was obliged to respect the Paladin , now . Being right under Joan ’s exalting and transforming eye , he forgot his native prudence , he forgot his diffidence in the presence of danger , he forgot what fear was , and he never laid about him in his imaginary battles in a more tremendous way that he did in this real one ; and wherever he struck there was an enemy the less . We were in that close place only a few minutes ; then our forces to the rear broke through with a great shout and joined us , and then the English fought a retreating fight , but in a fine and gallant way , and we drove them to their fortress foot by foot , they facing us all the time , and their reserves on the walls raining showers of arrows , cross - bow bolts , and stone cannon - balls upon us . The bulk of the enemy got safely within the works and left us outside with piles of French and English dead and wounded for company — a sickening sight , an awful sight to us youngsters , for our little ambush fights in February had been in the night , and the blood and the mutilations and the dead faces were mercifully dim , whereas we saw these things now for the first time in all their naked ghastliness . Now arrived Dunois from the city , and plunged through the battle on his foam - flecked horse and galloped up to Joan , saluting , and uttering handsome compliments as he came . He waved his hand toward the distant walls of the city , where a multitude of flags were flaunting gaily in the wind , and said the populace were up there observing her fortunate performance and rejoicing over it , and added that she and the forces would have a great reception now . “
73290	73291	73285	73285	Bastard	186	” “
73303	73304	73307	73307	Bastard	2001	” “
73320	73321	73314	73314	We	2033	” “
73359	73387	73388	73388	Bastard	186	” Joan ’s heart was overflowing with the joys and enthusiasms of war , and it made her impatient to hear such talk . She cried out : “
73426	73427	73430	73431	my General	1907	” “
73433	73434	73430	73431	my General	1907	” “
73449	73759	73440	73440	man	577	” and we saw that strange deep light in her eye which we named the battle - light , and learned to know so well in later fields . The martial notes pealed out , the troops answered with a yell , and down they came against that formidable work , whose outlines were lost in its own cannon - smoke , and whose sides were spouting flame and thunder . We suffered repulse after repulse , but Joan was here and there and everywhere encouraging the men , and she kept them to their work . During three hours the tide ebbed and flowed , flowed and ebbed ; but at last La Hire , who was now come , made a final and resistless charge , and the bastille St. Loup was ours . We gutted it , taking all its stores and artillery , and then destroyed it . When all our host was shouting itself hoarse with rejoicings , and there went up a cry for the General , for they wanted to praise her and glorify her and do her homage for her victory , we had trouble to find her ; and when we did find her , she was off by herself , sitting among a ruck of corpses , with her face in her hands , crying — for she was a young girl , you know , and her hero heart was a young girl ’s heart too , with the pity and the tenderness that are natural to it . She was thinking of the mothers of those dead friends and enemies . Among the prisoners were a number of priests , and Joan took these under her protection and saved their lives . It was urged that they were most probably combatants in disguise , but she said : “
73829	74518	73810	73810	I	0	” We marched back to the city with our crop of cannon and prisoners on view and our banners displayed . Here was the first substantial bit of war - work the imprisoned people had seen in the seven months that the siege had endured , the first chance they had had to rejoice over a French exploit . You may guess that they made good use of it . They and the bells went mad . Joan was their darling now , and the press of people struggling and shouldering each other to get a glimpse of her was so great that we could hardly push our way through the streets at all . Her new name had gone all about , and was on everybody ’s lips . The Holy Maid of Vaucouleurs was a forgotten title ; the city had claimed her for its own , and she was the MAID OF ORLEANS now . It is a happiness to me to remember that I heard that name the first time it was ever uttered . Between that first utterance and the last time it will be uttered on this earth — ah , think how many moldering ages will lie in that gap ! The Boucher family welcomed her back as if she had been a child of the house , and saved from death against all hope or probability . They chided her for going into the battle and exposing herself to danger during all those hours . They could not realize that she had meant to carry her warriorship so far , and asked her if it had really been her purpose to go right into the turmoil of the fight , or had n’t she got swept into it by accident and the rush of the troops ? They begged her to be more careful another time . It was good advice , maybe , but it fell upon pretty unfruitful soil . Chapter 19 We Burst In Upon Ghosts BEING WORN out with the long fight , we all slept the rest of the afternoon away and two or three hours into the night . Then we got up refreshed , and had supper . As for me , I could have been willing to let the matter of the ghost drop ; and the others were of a like mind , no doubt , for they talked diligently of the battle and said nothing of that other thing . And indeed it was fine and stirring to hear the Paladin rehearse his deeds and see him pile his dead , fifteen here , eighteen there , and thirty - five yonder ; but this only postponed the trouble ; it could not do more . He could not go on forever ; when he had carried the bastille by assault and eaten up the garrison there was nothing for it but to stop , unless Catherine Boucher would give him a new start and have it all done over again — as we hoped she would , this time — but she was otherwise minded . As soon as there was a good opening and a fair chance , she brought up her unwelcome subject , and we faced it the best we could . We followed her and her parents to the haunted room at eleven o’clock , with candles , and also with torches to place in the sockets on the walls . It was a big house , with very thick walls , and this room was in a remote part of it which had been left unoccupied for nobody knew how many years , because of its evil repute . This was a large room , like a salon , and had a big table in it of enduring oak and well preserved ; but the chair were worm - eaten and the tapestry on the walls was rotten and discolored by age . The dusty cobwebs under the ceiling had the look of not having had any business for a century . Catherine said : “
74622	74895	75109	75109	your	2054	” That was all . Then she and her parents left us . When their footfalls had died out in the distance down the empty stone corridors an uncanny silence and solemnity ensued which was dismaler to me than the mute march past the bastilles . We sat looking vacantly at each other , and it was easy to see that no one there was comfortable . The longer we sat so , the more deadly still that stillness got to be ; and when the wind began to moan around the house presently , it made me sick and miserable , and I wished I had been brave enough to be a coward this time , for indeed it is no proper shame to be afraid of ghosts , seeing how helpless the living are in their hands . And then these ghosts were invisible , which made the matter the worse , as it seemed to me . They might be in the room with us at that moment — we could not know . I felt airy touches on my shoulders and my hair , and I shrank from them and cringed , and was not ashamed to show this fear , for I saw the others doing the like , and knew that they were feeling those faint contacts too . As this went on — oh , eternities it seemed , the time dragged so drearily — all those faces became as wax , and I seemed sitting with a congress of the dead . At last , faint and far and weird and slow , came a “
74896	75091	75109	75109	your	2054	boom!—boom!—boom!”—a distant bell tolling midnight . When the last stroke died , that depressing stillness followed again , and as before I was staring at those waxen faces and feeling those airy touches on my hair and my shoulders once more . One minute — two minutes — three minutes of this , then we heard a long deep groan , and everybody sprang up and stood , with his legs quaking . It came from that little dungeon . There was a pause , then we herd muffled sobbings , mixed with pitiful ejaculations . Then there was a second voice , low and not distinct , and the one seemed trying to comfort the other ; and so the two voices went on , with moanings , and soft sobbings , and , ah , the tones were so full of compassion and sorry and despair ! Indeed , it made one ’s heart sore to hear it . But those sounds were so real and so human and so moving that the idea of ghosts passed straight out of our minds , and Sir Jean de Metz spoke out and said : “
75112	75423	75109	75109	your	2054	” The Dwarf jumped forward , swinging his great ax with both hands , and others sprang for torches and brought them . Bang!—whang!—slam!—smash went the ancient bricks , and there was a hole an ox could pass through . We plunged within and held up the torches . Nothing there but vacancy ! On the floor lay a rusty sword and a rotten fan . Now you know all that I know . Take the pathetic relics , and weave about them the romance of the dungeon ’s long - vanished inmates as best you can . Chapter 20 Joan Makes Cowards Brave Victors THE NEXT day Joan wanted to go against the enemy again , but it was the feast of the Ascension , and the holy council of bandit generals were too pious to be willing to profane it with bloodshed . But privately they profaned it with plottings , a sort of industry just in their line . They decided to do the only thing proper to do now in the new circumstances of the case — feign an attack on the most important bastille on the Orleans side , and then , if the English weakened the far more important fortresses on the other side of the river to come to its help , cross in force and capture those works . This would give them the bridge and free communication with the Sologne , which was French territory . They decided to keep this latter part of the program secret from Joan . Joan intruded and took them by surprise . She asked them what they were about and what they had resolved upon . They said they had resolved to attack the most important of the English bastilles on the Orleans side next morning — and there the spokesman stopped . Joan said : “
75429	75430	75109	75109	your	2054	” “
75440	75441	75109	75109	your	2054	” “
75464	75473	75474	75474	Bastard	186	” She turned to Dunois , and said , “
75506	75530	75539	75539	you	186	” The Bastard hesitated , and then began some rambling talk not quite germane to the question . Joan interrupted him and said : “
75627	75628	75599	75599	you	186	” “
75660	75661	75666	75666	God	140	” “
75702	75706	75709	75709	General	1962	” Several exclaimed : “
75716	75717	75709	75709	General	1962	” “
75882	75955	75956	75956	You	186	” Dunois conceded that the council did know it to be the most desirable , but considered it impracticable ; and he excused the council as well as he could by saying that inasmuch as nothing was really and rationally to be hoped for but a long continuance of the siege and wearying out of the English , they were naturally a little afraid of Joan ’s impetuous notions . He said : “
75978	75979	75971	75971	you	186	” “
76013	76014	75997	75997	We	2067	” “
76021	76022	75997	75997	We	2067	” “
76030	76047	75997	75997	We	2067	” La Hire came clanking in , and heard the last remark . He cried out : “
76083	76110	76073	76074	my General	1907	” He saluted in his large way and came up and shook Joan by the hand . Some member of the council was heard to say : “
76135	76141	76143	76143	yourselves	2078	” Joan turned and said : “
76174	76184	76169	76169	they	2659	” She added , with a touch of sarcasm , “
76198	76215	76216	76216	She	2082	” Then she took her leave . La Hire made this general remark to the council : “
76297	76817	76285	76285	she	2082	” Joan had spoken truly ; the sagacious English saw that the policy of the French had undergone a revolution ; that the policy of paltering and dawdling was ended ; that in place of taking blows , blows were ready to be struck now ; therefore they made ready for the new state of things by transferring heavy reinforcements to the bastilles of the south bank from those of the north . The city learned the great news that once more in French history , after all these humiliating years , France was going to take the offensive ; that France , so used to retreating , was going to advance ; that France , so long accustomed to skulking , was going to face about and strike . The joy of the people passed all bounds . The city walls were black with them to see the army march out in the morning in that strange new position — its front , not its tail , toward an English camp . You shall imagine for yourselves what the excitement was like and how it expressed itself , when Joan rode out at the head of the host with her banner floating above her . We crossed the five in strong force , and a tedious long job it was , for the boats were small and not numerous . Our landing on the island of St. Aignan was not disputed . We threw a bridge of a few boats across the narrow channel thence to the south shore and took up our march in good order and unmolested ; for although there was a fortress there — St. John — the English vacated and destroyed it and fell back on the bridge forts below as soon as our first boats were seen to leave the Orleans shore ; which was what Joan had said would happen , when she was disputing with the council . We moved down the shore and Joan planted her standard before the bastille of the Augustins , the first of the formidable works that protected the end of the bridge . The trumpets sounded the assault , and two charges followed in handsome style ; but we were too weak , as yet , for our main body was still lagging behind . Before we could gather for a third assault the garrison of St. Prive were seen coming up to reinforce the big bastille . They came on a run , and the Augustins sallied out , and both forces came against us with a rush , and sent our small army flying in a panic , and followed us , slashing and slaying , and shouting jeers and insults at us . Joan was doing her best to rally the men , but their wits were gone , their hearts were dominated for the moment by the old - time dread of the English . Joan ’s temper flamed up , and she halted and commanded the trumpets to sound the advance . Then she wheeled about and cried out : “
76838	77539	76836	76836	me	0	” Away she went , and after her a few dozen who had heard her words and been inspired by them . The pursuing force was astonished to see her sweeping down upon them with this handful of men , and it was their turn now to experience a grisly fright — surely this is a witch , this is a child of Satan ! That was their thought — and without stopping to analyze the matter they turned and fled in a panic . Our flying squadrons heard the bugle and turned to look ; and when they saw the Maid ’s banner speeding in the other direction and the enemy scrambling ahead of it in disorder , their courage returned and they came scouring after us . La Hire heard it and hurried his force forward and caught up with us just as we were planting our banner again before the ramparts of the Augustins . We were strong enough now . We had a long and tough piece of work before us , but we carried it through before night , Joan keeping us hard at it , and she and La Hire saying we were able to take that big bastille , and must . The English fought like — well , they fought like the English ; when that is said , there is no more to say . We made assault after assault , through the smoke and flame and the deafening cannon - blasts , and at last as the sun was sinking we carried the place with a rush , and planted our standard on its walls . The Augustins was ours . The Tourelles must be ours , too , if we would free the bridge and raise the siege . We had achieved one great undertaking , Joan was determined to accomplish the other . We must lie on our arms where we were , hold fast to what we had got , and be ready for business in the morning . So Joan was not minded to let the men be demoralized by pillage and riot and carousings ; she had the Augustins burned , with all its stores in it , excepting the artillery and ammunition . Everybody was tired out with this long day ’s hard work , and of course this was the case with Joan ; still , she wanted to stay with the army before the Tourelles , to be ready for the assault in the morning . The chiefs argued with her , and at last persuaded her to go home and prepare for the great work by taking proper rest , and also by having a leech look to a wound which she had received in her foot . So we crossed with them and went home . Just as usual , we found the town in a fury of joy , all the bells clanging , everybody shouting , and several people drunk . We never went out or came in without furnishing good and sufficient reasons for one of these pleasant tempests , and so the tempest was always on hand . There had been a blank absence of reasons for this sort of upheavals for the past seven months , therefore the people too to the upheavals with all the more relish on that account . Chapter 21 She Gently Reproves Her Dear Friend TO GET away from the usual crowd of visitors and have a rest , Joan went with Catherine straight to the apartment which the two occupied together , and there they took their supper and there the wound was dressed . But then , instead of going to bed , Joan , weary as she was , sent the Dwarf for me , in spite of Catherine ’s protests and persuasions . She said she had something on her mind , and must send a courier to Domremy with a letter for our old Pere Fronte to read to her mother . I came , and she began to dictate . After some loving words and greetings to her mother and family , came this : “
77588	77601	77608	77608	her	2088	” She was going on , when Catherine spoke up and said : “
77673	77710	77670	77670	I	0	” A laugh like the laugh of the old days , the impulsive free laugh of an untroubled spirit , a laugh like a chime of bells , was Joan ’s answer ; then she said : “
77735	77736	77725	77725	I	0	” “
77764	77801	77762	77762	you	110	” She had jumped up , full of vague fears , to have the leech called back at once , but Joan laid her hand upon her arm and made her sit down again , saying : “
77836	77866	77818	77818	I	0	” Catherine had the look of one who is trying to understand a puzzling proposition but can not quite do it . She said , in a distraught fashion : “
77892	77893	77881	77882	your mother	2092	” “
77902	77920	77818	77818	I	0	” The puzzle was a puzzle still . Catherine said in that same abstracted way as before : “
77993	77994	77971	77971	you!—drive	2094	” “
78029	78030	78031	78031	Joan	110	” “
78042	78043	78034	78034	you	110	” “
78055	78056	78050	78051	My Voices	2636	” “
78059	78065	78050	78051	My Voices	2636	” said Catherine , resignedly , “
78080	78081	78073	78073	you	110	” “
78095	78096	78067	78067	they	2636	” “
78108	78109	78104	78104	you	110	” “
78119	78125	78112	78112	I	0	” Joan turned to me . “
78137	78138	78139	78139	Your	110	” “
78152	78156	78139	78139	Your	110	” I answered ; “
78193	78224	78166	78166	You	110	” These marvels disturbed Catherine profoundly , but I had long ceased to be surprised at them . One can get used to anything in this world . Catherine said : “
78254	78255	78304	78304	Joan	110	” “
78258	78262	78304	78304	Joan	110	” Joan said , “
78276	78277	78304	78304	Joan	110	” “
78315	78325	78309	78309	you	110	” But Joan was not persuaded . She said : “
78408	78409	78411	78411	you	110	” “
78417	78418	78411	78411	you	110	” “
78445	78454	78457	78457	one	461	” She thought a moment , then added , “
78484	78505	78480	78480	you	2100	” I wondered what she might be contriving now , but I saw no clue . Catherine said , reproachfully : “
78517	78518	78480	78480	you	2100	” “
78549	78550	78543	78543	you	2100	” “
78568	78569	78554	78554	I	0	” “
78602	78603	78593	78593	I	0	” “
78639	78699	78701	78701	you	2100	” In her delight she flung her arms about Joan ’s neck and squandered endearments upon her the least of which would have made me rich , but , as it was , they only made me realize how poor I was — how miserably poor in what I would most have prized in this world . Joan said : “
78714	78715	78701	78701	you	2100	” “
78725	78726	78731	78731	you	2100	” “
78753	78754	78747	78747	I	0	” “
78777	78778	78736	78736	you	2100	” “
78854	78920	78828	78828	she	2110	” There was a pause — a silence of the sort that tortures one into stealing a glance to see how the situation looks , and I did that . There was a loving smile on Joan ’s face , but the color was mounting in crimson waves into Catherine ’s , and her lips were quivering and the tears gathering ; then she said : “
78951	79389	78948	78949	a fool	2732	” and she broke down and began to cry , and I did so want to take her in my arms and comfort her , but Joan did it , and of course I said nothing . Joan did it well , and most sweetly and tenderly , but I could have done it as well , though I knew it would be foolish and out of place to suggest such a thing , and might make an awkwardness , too , and be embarrassing to us all , so I did not offer , and I hope I did right and for the best , though I could not know , and was many times tortured with doubts afterward as having perhaps let a chance pass which might have changed all my life and made it happier and more beautiful than , alas , it turned out to be . For this reason I grieve yet , when I think of that scene , and do not like to call it up out of the deeps of my memory because of the pangs it brings . Well , well , a good and wholesome thing is a little harmless fun in this world ; it tones a body up and keeps him human and prevents him from souring . To set that little trap for Catherine was as good and effective a way as any to show her what a grotesque thing she was asking of Joan . It was a funny idea now , was n’t it , when you look at it all around ? Even Catherine dried up her tears and laughed when she thought of the English getting hold of the French Commander - in - Chief ’s reason for staying out of a battle . She granted that they could have a good time over a thing like that . We got to work on the letter again , and of course did not have to strike out the passage about the wound . Joan was in fine spirits ; but when she got to sending messages to this , that , and the other playmate and friend , it brought our village and the Fairy Tree and the flowery plain and the browsing sheep and all the peaceful beauty of our old humble home - place back , and the familiar names began to tremble on her lips ; and when she got to Haumette and Little Mengette it was no use , her voice broke and she could n’t go on . She waited a moment , then said : “
79421	79531	79412	79412	I	0	” Now came Pasquerel , Joan ’s confessor , and introduced a gallant knight , the Sire de Rais , who had been sent with a message . He said he was instructed to say that the council had decided that enough had been done for the present ; that it would be safest and best to be content with what God had already done ; that the city was now well victualed and able to stand a long siege ; that the wise course must necessarily be to withdraw the troops from the other side of the river and resume the defensive — therefore they had decided accordingly . “
79536	79540	79412	79412	I	0	” exclaimed Joan . “
79633	79641	79630	79631	good sir	1937	” Then she said to her priest : “
79674	79793	79663	79663	I	0	” Chapter 22 The Fate of France Decided WE WERE up at dawn , and after mass we started . In the hall we met the master of the house , who was grieved , good man , to see Joan going breakfastless to such a day ’s work , and begged her to wait and eat , but she could n’t afford the time — that is to say , she could n’t afford the patience , she being in such a blaze of anxiety to get at that last remaining bastille which stood between her and the completion of the first great step in the rescue and redemption of France . Boucher put in another plea : “
79841	79845	79883	79884	your Excellency	2648	” Joan said : “
79879	79880	79883	79884	your Excellency	2648	” “
79962	79963	79932	79932	he	2133	” “
79983	79984	79932	79932	he	2133	” “
80000	80001	79994	79994	you	0	” “
80010	80011	79994	79994	you	0	” “
80016	80017	79994	79994	you	0	” “
80022	80023	79994	79994	you	0	” “
80055	80056	79994	79994	you	0	” “
80085	80086	80079	80079	he	2142	” “
80116	80117	80112	80112	you	0	” “
80129	80215	80099	80099	he	2142	” We were off . The streets were full of citizens and of groups and squads of soldiers , but the spectacle was melancholy . There was not a smile anywhere , but only universal gloom . It was as if some vast calamity had smitten all hope and cheer dead . We were not used to this , and were astonished . But when they saw the Maid , there was an immediate stir , and the eager question flew from mouth to mouth . “
80226	80235	80236	80236	Whither	232	” Joan heard it , and called out : “
80249	80509	80241	80241	I	0	” It would not be possible for any to describe how those few words turned that mourning into joy — into exaltation — into frenzy ; and how a storm of huzzas burst out and swept down the streets in every direction and woke those corpse - like multitudes to vivid life and action and turmoil in a moment . The soldiers broke from the crowd and came flocking to our standard , and many of the citizens ran and got pikes and halberds and joined us . As we moved on , our numbers increased steadily , and the hurrahing continued — yes , we moved through a solid cloud of noise , as you may say , and all the windows on both sides contributed to it , for they were filled with excited people . You see , the council had closed the Burgundy gate and placed a strong force there , under that stout soldier Raoul de Gaucourt , Bailly of Orleans , with orders to prevent Joan from getting out and resuming the attack on the Tourelles , and this shameful thing had plunged the city into sorrow and despair . But that feeling was gone now . They believed the Maid was a match for the council , and they were right . When we reached the gate , Joan told Gaucourt to open it and let her pass . He said it would be impossible to do this , for his orders were from the council and were strict . Joan said : “
80533	80534	80535	80535	I	0	” “
80548	80549	80546	80546	General	1962	” “
80559	80601	80546	80546	General	1962	” He began to argue the case , for he was like the rest of the tribe , always ready to fight with words , not acts ; but in the midst of his gabble Joan interrupted with the terse order : “
80604	80686	80691	80691	she	0	” We came with a rush , and brief work we made of that small job . It was good to see the Bailly ’s surprise . He was not used to this unsentimental promptness . He said afterward that he was cut off in the midst of what he was saying — in the midst of an argument by which he could have proved that he could not let Joan pass — an argument which Joan could not have answered . “
80696	81257	80691	80691	she	0	” said the person he was talking to . We swung through the gate in great style , with a vast accession of noise , the most of which was laughter , and soon our van was over the river and moving down against the Tourelles . First we must take a supporting work called a boulevard , and which was otherwise nameless , before we could assault the great bastille . Its rear communicated with the bastille by a drawbridge , under which ran a swift and deep strip of the Loire . The boulevard was strong , and Dunois doubted our ability to take it , but Joan had no such doubt . She pounded it with artillery all the forenoon , then about noon she ordered an assault and led it herself . We poured into the fosse through the smoke and a tempest of missiles , and Joan , shouting encouragements to her men , started to climb a scaling - ladder , when that misfortune happened which we knew was to happen — the iron bolt from an arbaquest struck between her neck and her shoulder , and tore its way down through her armor . When she felt the sharp pain and saw her blood gushing over her breast , she was frightened , poor girl , and as she sank to the ground she began to cry bitterly . The English sent up a glad shout and came surging down in strong force to take her , and then for a few minutes the might of both adversaries was concentrated upon that spot . Over her and above her , English and French fought with desperation — for she stood for France , indeed she was France to both sides — whichever won her won France , and could keep it forever . Right there in that small spot , and in ten minutes by the clock , the fate of France , for all time , was to be decided , and was decided . If the English had captured Joan then , Charles VII . would have flown the country , the Treaty of Troyes would have held good , and France , already English property , would have become , without further dispute , an English province , to so remain until Judgment Day . A nationality and a kingdom were at stake there , and no more time to decide it in than it takes to hard - boil an egg . It was the most momentous ten minutes that the clock has ever ticked in France , or ever will . Whenever you read in histories about hours or days or weeks in which the fate of one or another nation hung in the balance , do not you fail to remember , nor your French hearts to beat the quicker for the remembrance , the ten minutes that France , called otherwise Joan of Arc , lay bleeding in the fosse that day , with two nations struggling over her for her possession . And you will not forget the Dwarf . For he stood over her , and did the work of any six of the others . He swung his ax with both hands ; whenever it came down , he said those two words , “
81261	81635	80691	80691	she	0	” and a splintered helmet flew like eggshells , and the skull that carried it had learned its manners and would offend the French no more . He piled a bulwark of iron - clad dead in front of him and fought from behind it ; and at last when the victory was ours we closed about him , shielding him , and he ran up a ladder with Joan as easily as another man would carry a child , and bore her out of the battle , a great crowd following and anxious , for she was drenched with blood to her feet , half of it her own and the other half English , for bodies had fallen across her as she lay and had poured their red life - streams over her . One could n’t see the white armor now , with that awful dressing over it . The iron bolt was still in the wound — some say it projected out behind the shoulder . It may be — I did not wish to see , and did not try to . It was pulled out , and the pain made Joan cry again , poor thing . Some say she pulled it out herself because others refused , saying they could not bear to hurt her . As to this I do not know ; I only know it was pulled out , and that the wound was treated with oil and properly dressed . Joan lay on the grass , weak and suffering , hour after hour , but still insisting that the fight go on . Which it did , but not to much purpose , for it was only under her eye that men were heroes and not afraid . They were like the Paladin ; I think he was afraid of his shadow — I mean in the afternoon , when it was very big and long ; but when he was under Joan ’s eye and the inspiration of her great spirit , what was he afraid of ? Nothing in this world — and that is just the truth . Toward night Dunois gave it up . Joan heard the bugles . “
81638	81642	81870	81870	Bugles	234	” she cried . “
81647	81843	81870	81870	Bugles	234	” Her wound was forgotten in a moment . She countermanded the order , and sent another , to the officer in command of a battery , to stand ready to fire five shots in quick succession . This was a signal to the force on the Orleans side of the river under La Hire , who was not , as some of the histories say , with us . It was to be given whenever Joan should feel sure the boulevard was about to fall into her hands — then that force must make a counter - attack on the Tourelles by way of the bridge . Joan mounted her horse now , with her staff about her , and when our people saw us coming they raised a great shout , and were at once eager for another assault on the boulevard . Joan rode straight to the fosse where she had received her wound , and standing there in the rain of bolts and arrows , she ordered the Paladin to let her long standard blow free , and to note when its fringes should touch the fortress . Presently he said : “
81847	81848	81870	81870	Bugles	234	” “
81853	81861	81865	81865	yours	2151	” said Joan to the waiting battalions , “
81885	82141	82144	82144	God	140	” And go it was . You never saw anything like it . We swarmed up the ladders and over the battlements like a wave — and the place was our property . Why , one might live a thousand years and never see so gorgeous a thing as that again . There , hand to hand , we fought like wild beasts , for there was no give - up to those English — there was no way to convince one of those people but to kill him , and even then he doubted . At least so it was thought , in those days , and maintained by many . We were busy and never heard the five cannon - shots fired , but they were fired a moment after Joan had ordered the assault ; and so , while we were hammering and being hammered in the smaller fortress , the reserve on the Orleans side poured across the bridge and attacked the Tourelles from that side . A fire - boat was brought down and moored under the drawbridge which connected the Tourelles with our boulevard ; wherefore , when at last we drove our English ahead of us and they tried to cross that drawbridge and join their friends in the Tourelles , the burning timbers gave way under them and emptied them in a mass into the river in their heavy armor — and a pitiful sight it was to see brave men die such a death as that . “
82148	82512	82144	82144	God	140	” said Joan , and wept to see that sorrowful spectacle . She said those gentle words and wept those compassionate tears although one of those perishing men had grossly insulted her with a coarse name three days before , when she had sent him a message asking him to surrender . That was their leader , Sir Williams Glasdale , a most valorous knight . He was clothed all in steel ; so he plunged under water like a lance , and of course came up no more . We soon patched a sort of bridge together and threw ourselves against the last stronghold of the English power that barred Orleans from friends and supplies . Before the sun was quite down , Joan ’s forever memorable day ’s work was finished , her banner floated from the fortress of the Tourelles , her promise was fulfilled , she had raised the siege of Orleans ! The seven months ’ beleaguerment was ended , the thing which the first generals of France had called impossible was accomplished ; in spite of all that the King ’s ministers and war - councils could do to prevent it , this little country - maid at seventeen had carried her immortal task through , and had done it in four days ! Good news travels fast , sometimes , as well as bad . By the time we were ready to start homeward by the bridge the whole city of Orleans was one red flame of bonfires , and the heavens blushed with satisfaction to see it ; and the booming and bellowing of cannon and the banging of bells surpassed by great odds anything that even Orleans had attempted before in the way of noise . When we arrived — well , there is no describing that . Why , those acres of people that we plowed through shed tears enough to raise the river ; there was not a face in the glare of those fires that had n’t tears streaming down it ; and if Joan ’s feet had not been protected by iron they would have kissed them off of her . “
82522	82536	82517	82520	the Maid of Orleans	2030	” That was the cry ; I heard it a hundred thousand times . “
82542	82678	82679	82679	She	2155	” some of them worded it . No other girl in all history has ever reached such a summit of glory as Joan of Arc reached that day . And do you think it turned her head , and that she sat up to enjoy that delicious music of homage and applause ? No ; another girl would have done that , but not this one . That was the greatest heart and the simplest that ever beat . She went straight to bed and to sleep , like any tired child ; and when the people found she was wounded and would rest , they shut off all passage and traffic in that region and stood guard themselves the whole night through , to see that he slumbers were not disturbed . They said , “
82691	83311	82689	82689	herself	2155	” All knew that that region would be empty of English next day , and all said that neither the present citizens nor their posterity would ever cease to hold that day sacred to the memory of Joan of Arc . That word has been true for more than sixty years ; it will continue so always . Orleans will never forget the 8th of May , nor ever fail to celebrate it . It is Joan of Arc ’s day — and holy . ( 1 ) ( 1)It is still celebrated every year with civic and military pomps and solemnities.—TRANSLATOR . Chapter 23 Joan Inspires the Tawdry King IN THE earliest dawn of morning , Talbot and his English forces evacuated their bastilles and marched away , not stopping to burn , destroy , or carry off anything , but leaving their fortresses just as they were , provisioned , armed , and equipped for a long siege . It was difficult for the people to believe that this great thing had really happened ; that they were actually free once more , and might go and come through any gate they pleased , with none to molest or forbid ; that the terrible Talbot , that scourge of the French , that man whose mere name had been able to annul the effectiveness of French armies , was gone , vanished , retreating — driven away by a girl . The city emptied itself . Out of every gate the crowds poured . They swarmed about the English bastilles like an invasion of ants , but noisier than those creatures , and carried off the artillery and stores , then turned all those dozen fortresses into monster bonfires , imitation volcanoes whose lofty columns of thick smoke seemed supporting the arch of the sky . The delight of the children took another form . To some of the younger ones seven months was a sort of lifetime . They had forgotten what grass was like , and the velvety green meadows seemed paradise to their surprised and happy eyes after the long habit of seeing nothing but dirty lanes and streets . It was a wonder to them — those spacious reaches of open country to run and dance and tumble and frolic in , after their dull and joyless captivity ; so they scampered far and wide over the fair regions on both sides of the river , and came back at eventide weary , but laden with flowers and flushed with new health drawn from the fresh country air and the vigorous exercise . After the burnings , the grown folk followed Joan from church to church and put in the day in thanksgivings for the city ’s deliverance , and at night they feted her and her generals and illuminated the town , and high and low gave themselves up to festivities and rejoicings . By the time the populace were fairly in bed , toward dawn , we were in the saddle and away toward Tours to report to the King . That was a march which would have turned any one ’s head but Joan ’s . We moved between emotional ranks of grateful country - people all the way . They crowded about Joan to touch her feet , her horse , her armor , and they even knelt in the road and kissed her horse ’s hoof - prints . The land was full of her praises . The most illustrious chiefs of the church wrote to the King extolling the Maid , comparing her to the saints and heroes of the Bible , and warning him not to let “
83319	83656	83657	83660	disguised ladies ’ maids	2156	” hinder or impair the divine help sent through her . One might think there was a touch of prophecy in that , and we will let it go at that ; but to my mind it had its inspiration in those great men ’s accurate knowledge of the King ’s trivial and treacherous character . The King had come to Tours to meet Joan . At the present day this poor thing is called Charles the Victorious , on account of victories which other people won for him , but in our time we had a private name for him which described him better , and was sanctified to him by personal deserving — Charles the Base . When we entered the presence he sat throned , with his tinseled snobs and dandies around him . He looked like a forked carrot , so tightly did his clothing fit him from his waist down ; he wore shoes with a rope - like pliant toe a foot long that had to be hitched up to the knee to keep it out of the way ; he had on a crimson velvet cape that came no lower than his elbows ; on his head he had a tall felt thing like a thimble , with a feather it its jeweled band that stuck up like a pen from an inkhorn , and from under that thimble his bush of stiff hair stuck down to his shoulders , curving outward at the bottom , so that the cap and the hair together made the head like a shuttlecock . All the materials of his dress were rich , and all the colors brilliant . In his lap he cuddled a miniature greyhound that snarled , lifting its lip and showing its white teeth whenever any slight movement disturbed it . The King ’s dandies were dressed in about the same fashion as himself , and when I remembered that Joan had called the war - council of Orleans “
83662	83923	83657	83660	disguised ladies ’ maids	2156	” it reminded me of people who squander all their money on a trifle and then have n’t anything to invest when they come across a better chance ; that name ought to have been saved for these creatures . Joan fell on her knees before the majesty of France , and the other frivolous animal in his lap — a sight which it pained me to see . What had that man done for his country or for anybody in it , that she or any other person should kneel to him ? But she — she had just done the only great deed that had been done for France in fifty years , and had consecrated it with the libation of her blood . The positions should have been reversed . However , to be fair , one must grant that Charles acquitted himself very well for the most part , on that occasion — very much better than he was in the habit of doing . He passed his pup to a courtier , and took off his cap to Joan as if she had been a queen . Then he stepped from his throne and raised her , and showed quite a spirited and manly joy and gratitude in welcoming her and thanking her for her extraordinary achievement in his service . My prejudices are of a later date than that . If he had continued as he was at that moment , I should not have acquired them . He acted handsomely . He said : “
83947	83957	83944	83944	your	2157	” Noticing that she was pale , he said , “
83980	83993	83944	83944	your	2157	” He led her to a seat and sat down by her . “
84028	84546	84552	84552	Dauphin	162	” I was ashamed of him . And yet that was not fair , for how could he be expected to know this marvelous child in these few weeks , when we who thought we had known her all her life were daily seeing the clouds uncover some new altitudes of her character whose existence was not suspected by us before ? But we are all that way : when we know a thing we have only scorn for other people who do n’t happen to know it . And I was ashamed of these courtiers , too , for the way they licked their chops , so to speak , as envying Joan her great chance , they not knowing her any better than the King did . A blush began to rise in Joan ’s cheeks at the thought that she was working for her country for pay , and she dropped her head and tried to hide her face , as girls always do when they find themselves blushing ; no one knows why they do , but they do , and the more they blush the more they fail to get reconciled to it , and the more they ca n’t bear to have people look at them when they are doing it . The King made it a great deal worse by calling attention to it , which is the unkindest thing a person can do when a girl is blushing ; sometimes , when there is a big crowd of strangers , it is even likely to make her cry if she is as young as Joan was . God knows the reason for this , it is hidden from men . As for me , I would as soon blush as sneeze ; in fact , I would rather . However , these meditations are not of consequence : I will go on with what I was saying . The King rallied her for blushing , and this brought up the rest of the blood and turned her face to fire . Then he was sorry , seeing what he had done , and tried to make her comfortable by saying the blush was exceeding becoming to her and not to mind it — which caused even the dog to notice it now , so of course the red in Joan ’s face turned to purple , and the tears overflowed and ran down — I could have told anybody that that would happen . The King was distressed , and saw that the best thing to do would be to get away from this subject , so he began to say the finest kind of things about Joan ’s capture of the Tourelles , and presently when she was more composed he mentioned the reward again and pressed her to name it . Everybody listened with anxious interest to hear what her claim was going to be , but when her answer came their faces showed that the thing she asked for was not what they had been expecting . “
84565	84566	84572	84573	my child	2372	” “
84578	84579	84581	84581	you	162	” “
84612	84626	84634	84635	my General	1907	” You could see the indolent King shrink , in his butterfly clothes . “
84647	84728	84634	84635	my General	1907	” Could those be French faces there ? Not one of them lighted in response to the girl ’s brave proposition , but all promptly showed satisfaction in the King ’s objection . Leave this silken idleness for the rude contact of war ? None of these butterflies desired that . They passed their jeweled comfit - boxes one to another and whispered their content in the head butterfly ’s practical prudence . Joan pleaded with the King , saying : “
84827	84848	84849	84849	Sire	2169	” The King shook his head , and La Tremouille , being asked for an opinion , eagerly furnished it : “
84876	84895	84900	84900	they	2170	” He was going on , but Joan cut him short , and said , turning to him : “
84913	84914	84900	84900	they	2170	” “
84919	84920	84900	84900	they	2170	” “
84935	84936	84929	84929	you	2169	” “
84943	84944	84929	84929	you	2169	” “
84949	85000	84929	84929	you	2169	” The minister was obliged to hesitate , for he knew of no explanation that would sound well . Moreover , he was not used to being catechized in this fashion , with the eyes of a crowd of people on him , so he was irritated , and said : “
85012	85017	85018	85018	I	0	” Joan said placidly : “
85049	85068	85031	85031	I	0	” The minister lifted his brows in amused surprise , and said , with a touch of sarcasm : “
85101	85107	85079	85079	you	2169	” Joan replied , indifferently : “
85114	85115	85079	85079	you	2169	” “
85119	85120	85079	85079	you	2169	” “
85172	85227	85230	85230	I	0	” The King did not blush , but burst into a hearty , careless laugh , and the court laughed too , but prudently turned its head and did it silently . La Tremouille was angry , and opened his mouth to speak , but the King put up his hand , and said : “
85290	85299	85287	85288	a constable	2186	” and he laughed his cordial laugh again . “
85346	85368	85309	85309	you	110	” It made an eager buzz of surprise and envy in the assemblage , but Joan shook her head and said : “
85449	85481	85441	85441	I	0	” But the King put his hand on her arm , and there was a really brave awakening in his voice and a manly fire in his eye when he said : “
85497	85519	85495	85495	you	110	” But a warning sign from his minister halted him , and he added , to the relief of the court : “
85547	85602	85543	85545	impulsive little soldier	2192	” The first part of the speech sent a glow of delight to Joan ’s face , but the end of it quenched it and she looked sad , and the tears gathered in her eyes . After a moment she spoke out with what seemed a sort of terrified impulse , and said : “
85621	85622	85608	85608	I	0	” “
85627	85628	85608	85608	I	0	” “
85640	85641	85633	85633	I	0	” “
85658	85659	85666	85666	you	110	” “
85717	85774	85777	85777	thou	2194	” Even those insects were sobered by her impassioned words . The King looked very grave — grave , and strongly impressed . His eyes lit suddenly with an eloquent fire , and he rose and drew his sword and raised it aloft ; then he brought it slowly down upon Joan ’s shoulder and said : “
85897	85933	85936	85938	Joan of Arc	110	” [ Astonishment and envy flared up in every countenance when the words were uttered which conferred this extraordinary grace . The King paused and looked around upon these signs with quite evident satisfaction . ] “
86004	86455	86456	86456	They	2209	” As my Lady Du Lis rose , the gilded children of privilege pressed forward to welcome her to their sacred ranks and call her by her new name ; but she was troubled , and said these honors were not meet for one of her lowly birth and station , and by their kind grace she would remain simple Joan of Arc , nothing more — and so be called . Nothing more ! As if there could be anything more , anything higher , anything greater . My Lady Du Lis — why , it was tinsel , petty , perishable . But , JOAN OF ARC ! The mere sound of it sets one ’s pulses leaping . Chapter 24 Tinsel Trappings of Nobility IT WAS vexatious to see what a to - do the whole town , and next the whole country , made over the news . Joan of Arc ennobled by the King ! People went dizzy with wonder and delight over it . You can not imagine how she was gaped at , stared at , envied . Why , one would have supposed that some great and fortunate thing had happened to her . But we did not think any great things of it . To our minds no mere human hand could add a glory to Joan of Arc . To us she was the sun soaring in the heavens , and her new nobility a candle atop of it ; to us it was swallowed up and lost in her own light . And she was as indifferent to it and as unconscious of it as the other sun would have been . But it was different with her brothers . They were proud and happy in their new dignity , which was quite natural . And Joan was glad it had been conferred , when she saw how pleased they were . It was a clever thought in the King to outflank her scruples by marching on them under shelter of her love for her family and her kin . Jean and Pierre sported their coats - of - arms right away ; and their society was courted by everybody , the nobles and commons alike . The Standard - Bearer said , with some touch of bitterness , that he could see that they just felt good to be alive , they were so soaked with the comfort of their glory ; and did n’t like to sleep at all , because when they were asleep they did n’t know they were noble , and so sleep was a clean loss of time . And then he said : “
86506	86507	86494	86494	Noel	135	” “
86510	86514	86494	86494	Noel	135	” I said , “
86521	86522	86517	86517	you	0	” “
86535	86546	86523	86523	I	0	” said the Standard - Bearer , with a sigh . “
86573	86580	86570	86571	a fool	2732	” Noel Rainguesson said , musingly : “
86593	86598	86605	86605	you	0	” We others laughed . “
86635	86642	86632	86633	Noel Rainguesson	135	” The Sieur de Metz said : “
86692	86693	86725	86725	man	577	” “
86698	86699	86725	86725	man	577	” “
86839	86873	86830	86837	the Duke d’Alencon , prince of the blood	2225	” You could have knocked the Paladin down with a feather . He seemed to actually turn pale . He worked his lips a moment without getting anything out ; then it came : “
86971	86983	86968	86969	an ass	1183	” Noel Rainguesson said , in a kind of weary way : “
87004	87005	86992	86992	I	0	” “
87021	87022	87019	87019	you	2229	” “
87154	87155	87130	87131	an ass	1183	” “
87202	87203	87199	87199	your	2229	” “
87246	87247	87237	87237	you	2229	” “
87258	87259	87262	87262	you	2229	” “
87330	87331	87326	87326	he	2237	” “
87374	87375	87366	87366	you	2229	” “
87379	87380	87366	87366	you	2229	” “
87403	87404	87405	87405	I	0	” “
87415	87453	87405	87405	I	0	” The Standard - Bearer was deep in thoughts and dreams a few moments , then the silk - and - velvet expanse of his vast breast rose and fell with a sigh , and he said : “
87568	87764	87765	87766	Noble Dauphin	162	” Just then the bugles blew the assembly , and that cut our talk short . Chapter 25 At Last — Forward ! THE DAYS began to waste away — and nothing decided , nothing done . The army was full of zeal , but it was also hungry . It got no pay , the treasury was getting empty , it was becoming impossible to feed it ; under pressure of privation it began to fall apart and disperse — which pleased the trifling court exceedingly . Joan ’s distress was pitiful to see . She was obliged to stand helpless while her victorious army dissolved away until hardly the skeleton of it was left . At last one day she went to the Castle of Loches , where the King was idling . She found him consulting with three of his councilors , Robert le Maton , a former Chancellor of France , Christophe d’Harcourt , and Gerard Machet . The Bastard of Orleans was present also , and it is through him that we know what happened . Joan threw herself at the King ’s feet and embraced his knees , saying : “
87793	87798	87801	87801	your	162	” Christophe d’Harcourt asked : “
87813	87814	87801	87801	your	162	” “
87820	87821	87801	87801	your	162	” “
87842	87930	87836	87837	the Voices	174	” It was another sly attempt to trap Joan into indiscreet admissions and dangerous pretensions . But nothing came of it . Joan ’s answer was simple and straightforward , and the smooth Bishop was not able to find any fault with it . She said that when she met with people who doubted the truth of her mission she went aside and prayed , complaining of the distrust of these , and then the comforting Voices were heard at her ear saying , soft and low , “
87944	87949	87939	87939	I	0	” Then she added , “
87967	88066	87939	87939	I	0	” The Bastard said that when she said these words her face lit up as with a flame , and she was like one in an ecstasy . Joan pleaded , persuaded , reasoned ; gaining ground little by little , but opposed step by step by the council . She begged , she implored , leave to march . When they could answer nothing further , they granted that perhaps it had been a mistake to let the army waste away , but how could we help it now ? how could we march without an army ? “
88070	88074	87939	87939	I	0	” said Joan . “
88082	88083	87939	87939	I	0	” “
88093	88094	88090	88090	us	2249	” “
88122	88123	88109	88109	troops	2251	” “
88152	88178	88179	88179	We	2249	” The King objected that he could not venture toward Rheims with those strong places on the Loire in his path . But Joan said : “
88190	88859	88186	88186	you	2254	” With that plan the King was willing to venture assent . He could sit around out of danger while the road was being cleared . Joan came back in great spirits . Straightway everything was stirring . Proclamations were issued calling for men , a recruiting - camp was established at Selles in Berry , and the commons and the nobles began to flock to it with enthusiasm . A deal of the month of May had been wasted ; and yet by the 6th of June Joan had swept together a new army and was ready to march . She had eight thousand men . Think of that . Think of gathering together such a body as that in that little region . And these were veteran soldiers , too . In fact , most of the men in France were soldiers , when you came to that ; for the wars had lasted generations now . Yes , most Frenchmen were soldiers ; and admirable runners , too , both by practice and inheritance ; they had done next to nothing but run for near a century . But that was not their fault . They had had no fair and proper leadership — at least leaders with a fair and proper chance . Away back , King and Court got the habit of being treacherous to the leaders ; then the leaders easily got the habit of disobeying the King and going their own way , each for himself and nobody for the lot . Nobody could win victories that way . Hence , running became the habit of the French troops , and no wonder . Yet all that those troops needed in order to be good fighters was a leader who would attend strictly to business — a leader with all authority in his hands in place of a tenth of it along with nine other generals equipped with an equal tenth apiece . They had a leader rightly clothed with authority now , and with a head and heart bent on war of the most intensely businesslike and earnest sort — and there would be results . No doubt of that . They had Joan of Arc ; and under that leadership their legs would lose the art and mystery of running . Yes , Joan was in great spirits . She was here and there and everywhere , all over the camp , by day and by night , pushing things . And wherever she came charging down the lines , reviewing the troops , it was good to hear them break out and cheer . And nobody could help cheering , she was such a vision of young bloom and beauty and grace , and such an incarnation of pluck and life and go ! she was growing more and more ideally beautiful every day , as was plain to be seen — and these were days of development ; for she was well past seventeen now — in fact , she was getting close upon seventeen and a half — indeed , just a little woman , as you may say . The two young Counts de Laval arrived one day — fine young fellows allied to the greatest and most illustrious houses of France ; and they could not rest till they had seen Joan of Arc . So the King sent for them and presented them to her , and you may believe she filled the bill of their expectations . When they heard that rich voice of hers they must have thought it was a flute ; and when they saw her deep eyes and her face , and the soul that looked out of that face , you could see that the sight of her stirred them like a poem , like lofty eloquence , like martial music . One of them wrote home to his people , and in his letter he said , “
88871	88914	88186	88186	you	2254	” Ah , yes , and it was a true word . Truer word was never spoken . He saw her when she was ready to begin her march and open the campaign , and this is what he said about it : “
89093	89205	89206	89206	She	2255	” I was there , and I saw it , too ; saw it all , just as he pictures it . And I see it yet — the little battle - ax , the dainty plumed cap , the white armor — all in the soft June afternoon ; I see it just as if it were yesterday . And I rode with the staff — the personal staff — the staff of Joan of Arc . That young count was dying to go , too , but the King held him back for the present . But Joan had made him a promise . In his letter he said : “
89243	89312	89313	89313	You	0	” She made him that promise when she was taking leave of my lady the Duchess d’Alencon . The duchess was exacting a promise , so it seemed a proper time for others to do the like . The duchess was troubled for her husband , for she foresaw desperate fighting ; and she held Joan to her breast , and stroked her hair lovingly , and said : “
89351	89355	89348	89348	you	0	” Joan said : “
89399	89782	89393	89393	you	0	” The duchess could not speak , but she kissed Joan on the forehead ; and so they parted . We left on the 6th and stopped over at Romorantin ; then on the 9th Joan entered Orleans in state , under triumphal arches , with the welcoming cannon thundering and seas of welcoming flags fluttering in the breeze . The Grand Staff rode with her , clothed in shining splendors of costume and decorations : the Duke d’Alencon ; the Bastard of Orleans ; the Sire de Boussac , Marshal of France ; the Lord de Granville , Master of the Crossbowmen ; the Sire de Culan , Admiral of France ; Ambroise de Lor ; Etienne de Vignoles , called La Hire ; Gautier de Brusac , and other illustrious captains . It was grand times ; the usual shoutings and packed multitudes , the usual crush to get sight of Joan ; but at last we crowded through to our old lodgings , and I saw old Boucher and the wife and that dear Catherine gather Joan to their hearts and smother her with kisses — and my heart ached for her so ! for I could have kissed Catherine better than anybody , and more and longer ; yet was not thought of for that office , and I so famished for it . Ah , she was so beautiful , and oh , so sweet ! I had loved her the first day I ever saw her , and from that day forth she was sacred to me . I have carried her image in my heart for sixty - three years — all lonely thee , yes , solitary , for it never has had company — and I am grown so old , so old ; but it , oh , it is as fresh and young and merry and mischievous and lovely and sweet and pure and witching and divine as it was when it crept in there , bringing benediction and peace to its habitation so long ago , so long ago — for it has not aged a day ! Chapter 26 The Last Doubts Scattered THIS TIME , as before , the King ’s last command to the generals was this : “
89797	89935	89794	89795	the Maid	1326	” And this time the command was obeyed ; and would continue to be obeyed all through the coming great days of the Loire campaign . That was a change ! That was new ! It broke the traditions . It shows you what sort of a reputation as a commander - in - chief the child had made for herself in ten days in the field . It was a conquering of men ’s doubts and suspicions and a capturing and solidifying of men ’s belief and confidence such as the grayest veteran on the Grand Staff had not been able to achieve in thirty years . Do n’t you remember that when at sixteen Joan conducted her own case in a grim court of law and won it , the old judge spoke of her as “
89939	90332	90334	90334	God	140	” ? It was the right name , you see . These veterans were not going to branch out and do things without the sanction of the Maid — that is true ; and it was a great gain . But at the same time there were some among them who still trembled at her new and dashing war tactics and earnestly desired to modify them . And so , during the 10th , while Joan was slaving away at her plans and issuing order after order with tireless industry , the old - time consultations and arguings and speechifyings were going on among certain of the generals . In the afternoon of that day they came in a body to hold one of these councils of war ; and while they waited for Joan to join them they discussed the situation . Now this discussion is not set down in the histories ; but I was there , and I will speak of it , as knowing you will trust me , I not being given to beguiling you with lies . Gautier de Brusac was spokesman for the timid ones ; Joan ’s side was resolutely upheld by d’Alencon , the Bastard , La Hire , the Admiral of France , the Marshal de Boussac , and all the other really important chiefs . De Brusac argued that the situation was very grave ; that Jargeau , the first point of attack , was formidably strong ; its imposing walls bristling with artillery ; with seven thousand picked English veterans behind them , and at their head the great Earl of Suffolk and his two redoubtable brothers , the De la Poles . It seemed to him that the proposal of Joan of Arc to try to take such a place by storm was a most rash and over - daring idea , and she ought to be persuaded to relinquish it in favor of the soberer and safer procedure of investment by regular siege . It seemed to him that this fiery and furious new fashion of hurling masses of men against impregnable walls of stone , in defiance of the established laws and usages of war , was — But he got no further . La Hire gave his plumed helm an impatient toss and burst out with : “
90348	90430	90336	90336	she	2271	” And before he could get out anything more , D’Alencon was on his feet , and the Bastard of Orleans , and a half a dozen others , all thundering at once , and pouring out their indignant displeasure upon any and all that might hold , secretly or publicly , distrust of the wisdom of the Commander - in - Chief . And when they had said their say , La Hire took a chance again , and said : “
90931	90988	90993	90994	my General	1907	” Oh , he carried them . There was not another word said about persuading Joan to change her tactics . They sat talking comfortably enough after that . By and by Joan entered , and they rose and saluted with their swords , and she asked what their pleasure might be . La Hire said : “
91013	91053	91068	91068	them	2296	” Joan laughed her pleasant laugh , her merry , carefree laugh ; the laugh that rippled so buoyantly from her lips and made old people feel young again to hear it ; and she said to the company : “
91084	91123	91080	91080	you	2298	” Then a faraway look came into her eyes , and I think that a picture of her home drifted across the vision of her mind ; for she said very gently , and as one who muses , “
91147	92214	91137	91137	I	0	” We had a homelike farewell supper that evening — just the personal staff and the family . Joan had to miss it ; for the city had given a banquet in her honor , and she had gone there in state with the Grand Staff , through a riot of joy - bells and a sparkling Milky Way of illuminations . After supper some lively young folk whom we knew came in , and we presently forgot that we were soldiers , and only remembered that we were boys and girls and full of animal spirits and long - pent fun ; and so there was dancing , and games , and romps , and screams of laughter — just as extravagant and innocent and noisy a good time as ever I had in my life . Dear , dear , how long ago it was!—and I was young then . And outside , all the while , was the measured tramp of marching battalions , belated odds and ends of the French power gathering for the morrow ’s tragedy on the grim stage of war . Yes , in those days we had those contrasts side by side . And as I passed along to bed there was another one : the big Dwarf , in brave new armor , sat sentry at Joan ’s door — the stern Spirit of War made flesh , as it were — and on his ample shoulder was curled a kitten asleep . Chapter 27 How Joan Took Jargeau WE MADE a gallant show next day when we filed out through the frowning gates of Orleans , with banners flying and Joan and the Grand Staff in the van of the long column . Those two young De Lavals were come now , and were joined to the Grand Staff . Which was well ; war being their proper trade , for they were grandsons of that illustrious fighter Bertrand du Guesclin , Constable of France in earlier days . Louis de Bourbon , the Marshal de Rais , and the Vidame de Chartres were added also . We had a right to feel a little uneasy , for we knew that a force of five thousand men was on its way under Sir John Fastolfe to reinforce Jargeau , but I think we were not uneasy , nevertheless . In truth , that force was not yet in our neighborhood . Sir John was loitering ; for some reason or other he was not hurrying . He was losing precious time — four days at Etampes , and four more at Janville . We reached Jargeau and began business at once . Joan sent forward a heavy force which hurled itself against the outworks in handsome style , and gained a footing and fought hard to keep it ; but it presently began to fall back before a sortie from the city . Seeing this , Joan raised her battle - cry and led a new assault herself under a furious artillery fire . The Paladin was struck down at her side wounded , but she snatched her standard from his failing hand and plunged on through the ruck of flying missiles , cheering her men with encouraging cries ; and then for a good time one had turmoil , and clash of steel , and collision and confusion of struggling multitudes , and the hoarse bellowing of the guns ; and then the hiding of it all under a rolling firmament of smoke — a firmament through which veiled vacancies appeared for a moment now and then , giving fitful dim glimpses of the wild tragedy enacting beyond ; and always at these times one caught sight of that slight figure in white mail which was the center and soul of our hope and trust , and whenever we saw that , with its back to us and its face to the fight , we knew that all was well . At last a great shout went up — a joyous roar of shoutings , in fact — and that was sign sufficient that the faubourgs were ours . Yes , they were ours ; the enemy had been driven back within the walls . On the ground which Joan had won we camped ; for night was coming on . Joan sent a summons to the English , promising that if they surrendered she would allow them to go in peace and take their horses with them . Nobody knew that she could take that strong place , but she knew it — knew it well ; yet she offered that grace — offered it in a time when such a thing was unknown in war ; in a time when it was custom and usage to massacre the garrison and the inhabitants of captured cities without pity or compunction — yes , even to the harmless women and children sometimes . There are neighbors all about you who well remember the unspeakable atrocities which Charles the Bold inflicted upon the men and women and children of Dinant when he took that place some years ago . It was a unique and kindly grace which Joan offered that garrison ; but that was her way , that was her loving and merciful nature — she always did her best to save her enemy ’s life and his soldierly pride when she had the mastery of him . The English asked fifteen days ’ armistice to consider the proposal in . And Fastolfe coming with five thousand men ! Joan said no . But she offered another grace : they might take both their horses and their side - arms — but they must go within the hour . Well , those bronzed English veterans were pretty hard - headed folk . They declined again . Then Joan gave command that her army be made ready to move to the assault at nine in the morning . Considering the deal of marching and fighting which the men had done that day , D’Alencon thought the hour rather early ; but Joan said it was best so , and so must be obeyed . Then she burst out with one of those enthusiasms which were always burning in her when battle was imminent , and said : “
92226	92236	92220	92220	God	140	” Yes , one might say that her motto was “
92247	92500	92220	92220	God	140	” for in war she never knew what indolence was . And whoever will take that motto and live by it will likely to succeed . There ’s many a way to win in this world , but none of them is worth much without good hard work back out of it . I think we should have lost our big Standard - Bearer that day , if our bigger Dwarf had not been at hand to bring him out of the melee when he was wounded . He was unconscious , and would have been trampled to death by our own horse , if the Dwarf had not promptly rescued him and haled him to the rear and safety . He recovered , and was himself again after two or three hours ; and then he was happy and proud , and made the most of his wound , and went swaggering around in his bandages showing off like an innocent big - child — which was just what he was . He was prouder of being wounded than a really modest person would be of being killed . But there was no harm in his vanity , and nobody minded it . He said he was hit by a stone from a catapult — a stone the size of a man ’s head . But the stone grew , of course . Before he got through with it he was claiming that the enemy had flung a building at him . “
92505	92510	92220	92220	God	140	” said Noel Rainguesson . “
92526	92656	92220	92220	God	140	” He said that privately . And , sure enough , to - morrow it was a cathedral . I never saw anybody with such an abandoned imagination . Joan was abroad at the crack of dawn , galloping here and there and yonder , examining the situation minutely , and choosing what she considered the most effective positions for her artillery ; and with such accurate judgment did she place her guns that her Lieutenant - General ’s admiration of it still survived in his memory when his testimony was taken at the Rehabilitation , a quarter of a century later . In this testimony the Duke d’Alencon said that at Jargeau that morning of the 12th of June she made her dispositions not like a novice , but “
92675	93489	92220	92220	God	140	” The veteran captains of the armies of France said she was great in war in all ways , but greatest of all in her genius for posting and handling artillery . Who taught the shepherd - girl to do these marvels — she who could not read , and had had no opportunity to study the complex arts of war ? I do not know any way to solve such a baffling riddle as that , there being no precedent for it , nothing in history to compare it with and examine it by . For in history there is no great general , however gifted , who arrived at success otherwise than through able teaching and hard study and some experience . It is a riddle which will never be guessed . I think these vast powers and capacities were born in her , and that she applied them by an intuition which could not err . At eight o’clock all movement ceased , and with it all sounds , all noise . A mute expectancy reigned . The stillness was something awful — because it meant so much . There was no air stirring . The flags on the towers and ramparts hung straight down like tassels . Wherever one saw a person , that person had stopped what he was doing , and was in a waiting attitude , a listening attitude . We were on a commanding spot , clustered around Joan . Not far from us , on every hand , were the lanes and humble dwellings of these outlying suburbs . Many people were visible — all were listening , not one was moving . A man had placed a nail ; he was about to fasten something with it to the door - post of his shop — but he had stopped . There was his hand reaching up holding the nail ; and there was his other hand in the act of striking with the hammer ; but he had forgotten everything — his head was turned aside listening . Even children unconsciously stopped in their play ; I saw a little boy with his hoop - stick pointed slanting toward the ground in the act of steering the hoop around the corner ; and so he had stopped and was listening — the hoop was rolling away , doing its own steering . I saw a young girl prettily framed in an open window , a watering - pot in her hand and window - boxes of red flowers under its spout — but the water had ceased to flow ; the girl was listening . Everywhere were these impressive petrified forms ; and everywhere was suspended movement and that awful stillness . Joan of Arc raised her sword in the air . At the signal , the silence was torn to rags ; cannon after cannon vomited flames and smoke and delivered its quaking thunders ; and we saw answering tongues of fire dart from the towers and walls of the city , accompanied by answering deep thunders , and in a minute the walls and the towers disappeared , and in their place stood vast banks and pyramids of snowy smoke , motionless in the dead air . The startled girl dropped her watering - pot and clasped her hands together , and at that moment a stone cannon - ball crashed through her fair body . The great artillery duel went on , each side hammering away with all its might ; and it was splendid for smoke and noise , and most exalting to one ’s spirits . The poor little town around about us suffered cruelly . The cannon - balls tore through its slight buildings , wrecking them as if they had been built of cards ; and every moment or two one would see a huge rock come curving through the upper air above the smoke - clouds and go plunging down through the roofs . Fire broke out , and columns of flame and smoke rose toward the sky . Presently the artillery concussions changed the weather . The sky became overcast , and a strong wind rose and blew away the smoke that hid the English fortresses . Then the spectacle was fine ; turreted gray walls and towers , and streaming bright flags , and jets of red fire and gushes of white smoke in long rows , all standing out with sharp vividness against the deep leaden background of the sky ; and then the whizzing missiles began to knock up the dirt all around us , and I felt no more interest in the scenery . There was one English gun that was getting our position down finer and finer all the time . Presently Joan pointed to it and said : “
93506	93561	92220	92220	God	140	” The Duke d’Alencon did as he was bid ; but Monsieur du Lude rashly took his place , and that cannon tore his head off in a moment . Joan was watching all along for the right time to order the assault . At last , about nine o’clock , she cried out : “
93568	93652	92220	92220	God	140	” and the buglers blew the charge . Instantly we saw the body of men that had been appointed to this service move forward toward a point where the concentrated fire of our guns had crumbled the upper half of a broad stretch of wall to ruins ; we saw this force descend into the ditch and begin to plant the scaling - ladders . We were soon with them . The Lieutenant - General thought the assault premature . But Joan said : “
93676	93779	93781	93781	your	2306	” It was warm work in the ditches . The walls were crowded with men , and they poured avalanches of stones down upon us . There was one gigantic Englishman who did us more hurt than any dozen of his brethren . He always dominated the places easiest of assault , and flung down exceedingly troublesome big stones which smashed men and ladders both — then he would near burst himself with laughing over what he had done . But the duke settled accounts with him . He went and found the famous cannoneer , Jean le Lorrain , and said : “
93789	93927	93781	93781	your	2306	” He did it with the first shot . He hit the Englishman fair in the breast and knocked him backward into the city . The enemy ’s resistance was so effective and so stubborn that our people began to show signs of doubt and dismay . Seeing this , Joan raised her inspiring battle - cry and descended into the fosse herself , the Dwarf helping her and the Paladin sticking bravely at her side with the standard . She started up a scaling - ladder , but a great stone flung from above came crashing down upon her helmet and stretched her , wounded and stunned , upon the ground . But only for a moment . The Dwarf stood her upon her feet , and straightway she started up the ladder again , crying : “
93949	94034	94035	94035	I	0	” There was a grand rush , and a fierce roar of war - cries , and we swarmed over the ramparts like ants . The garrison fled , we pursued ; Jargeau was ours ! The Earl of Suffolk was hemmed in and surrounded , and the Duke d’Alencon and the Bastard of Orleans demanded that he surrender himself . But he was a proud nobleman and came of a proud race . He refused to yield his sword to subordinates , saying : “
94055	94181	94044	94047	the Maid of Orleans	2030	” And so he did ; and was courteously and honorably used by her . His two brothers retreated , fighting step by step , toward the bridge , we pressing their despairing forces and cutting them down by scores . Arrived on the bridge , the slaughter still continued . Alexander de la Pole was pushed overboard or fell over , and was drowned . Eleven hundred men had fallen ; John de la Pole decided to give up the struggle . But he was nearly as proud and particular as his brother of Suffolk as to whom he would surrender to . The French officer nearest at hand was Guillaume Renault , who was pressing him closely . Sir John said to him : “
94187	94188	94183	94183	you	2311	” “
94191	94192	94183	94183	you	2311	” “
94197	94198	94194	94195	a knight	2313	” “
