It is possible , though it may not be a usual thing , for a man to feel so strongly attracted by the charms and qualities of a woman , even at first sight , as to feel sure that she , and she alone , can make his happiness . My folly consisted -- there you are right -- in even dreaming that you could return my feelings in the slightest degree , when you had only seen me once : and I am most truly ashamed of myself . I can not tell you how sorry I am , when I see how you have compelled yourself to come and speak to me when you are so ill . "

And you were in the drawing - room with -- who did you say he was?--that Mr. Livingstone , who might have come at a better time to bid good - bye ; and he had never dined here , had he ? so I do n't see any reason he had to come calling , and P. P. C.-ing , and your papa _ not _ up . So I said to Mrs. Jackson , ' I 'll send and ask Mr. Wilkins , if you like , but I do n't see any use in it , for I can tell you just as well as anybody , that Mr. Dunster is not in this house , wherever he may be .

As I said to Mrs. Jackson , ' Mr. Wilkins is not likely to know where Mr. Dunster spends his time when he is not in the office , for they do not move in the same rank of life , my good woman ; and Mrs. Jackson apologised , but said that yesterday they had both been dining at Mr. Hodgson 's together , she believed ; and somehow she had got it into her head that Mr. Dunster might have missed his way in coming along Moor Lane , and might have slipped into the canal ; so she just thought she would step up and ask Mr. Wilkins if they had left Mr. Hodgson 's together , or if your papa had driven home . I asked her why she had not told me all these particulars before , for I could have asked your papa myself all about when he last saw Mr. Dunster ; and I went up to ask him a second time , but he did not like it at all , for he was busy dressing , and I had to shout my questions through the door , and he could not always hear me at first .

He seemed very much annoyed to hear that Mr. Dunster had not been at home all night ; but he said I was to tell Mrs. Jackson that he would go to the office as soon as he had had his breakfast , which he ordered to be sent up directly into his own room , and he had no doubt it would all turn out right , but that she had better go home at once . And , as I told her , she might find Mr. Dunster there by the time she got there . There , there is your papa going out ! He has not lost any time over his breakfast ! "

36090	36153	35879	35879	she	77	" Revenged ! What nonsense ! It is simple justice -- justice to himself and to others -- to see that villainy is so sufficiently punished as to deter others from entering upon such courses . But I have little doubt Mr. Wilkins has taken the right steps ; he is not the man to sit down quietly under such a loss . "

44845	44891	44837	44837	he	398	" for somehow of late he has not seemed to me good enough for thee . He has got an inkling that something has gone wrong , and he was very inquisitive -- I may say he questioned me in a relentless kind of way . "
44892	44915	44916	44916	He	398	" Oh , papa , it was my doing , I 'm afraid . I said something long ago about possible disgrace . "

45408	45455	45341	45341	He	398	" I will , as well as I can ; but it was last August . I only said , ' Was it right for a woman to marry , knowing that disgrace hung over her , and keeping her lover in ignorance of it ? ' "
45456	45465	45341	45341	He	398	" That was all , you are sure ? "

45481	45497	45341	45341	He	398	" And he never wanted to know what was the nature of the threatened disgrace ? "

45505	45511	45341	45341	He	398	" And you told him ? "
45512	45552	45553	45553	He	1656	" No , not a word more . He referred to the subject again to - day , in the shrubbery ; but I told him nothing more . You quite believe me , do n't you , papa ? "

45602	45637	45638	45638	He	1656	" he says true ; he is not good enough for thee . He shrinks from the thought of the disgrace . Thou must stand alone , and bear the sins of thy father . "
45950	46374	45944	45944	His	81	" DEAREST ELLINOR , for dearest you are , and I think will ever be , my judgment has consented to a step which is giving me great pain , greater than you will readily believe . I am convinced that it is better that we should part ; for circumstances have occurred since we formed our engagement which , although I am unaware of their exact nature , I can see weigh heavily upon you , and have materially affected your father 's behaviour . Nay , I think , after to - night , I may almost say have entirely altered his feelings towards me . What these circumstances are I am ignorant , any further than that I know from your own admission , that they may lead to some future disgrace . Now , it may be my fault , it may be in my temperament , to be anxious , above all things earthly , to obtain and possess a high reputation . I can only say that it is so , and leave you to blame me for my weakness as much as you like . But anything that might come in between me and this object would , I own , be ill tolerated by me ; the very dread of such an obstacle intervening would paralyse me . I should become irritable , and , deep as my affection is , and always must be , towards you , I could not promise you a happy , peaceful life . I should be perpetually haunted by the idea of what might happen in the way of discovery and shame . I am the more convinced of this from my observation of your father 's altered character -- an alteration which I trace back to the time when I conjecture that the secret affairs took place to which you have alluded . In short , it is for your sake , my dear Ellinor , even more than for my own , that I feel compelled to affix a final meaning to the words which your father addressed to me last night , when he desired me to leave his house for ever . God bless you , my Ellinor , for the last time my Ellinor . Try to forget as soon as you can the unfortunate tie which has bound you for a time to one so unsuitable -- I believe I ought to say so unworthy of you -- as -- RALPH CORBET . "
46461	46559	46450	46450	She	73	" It is all right -- quite right . I ought to have thought of it all last August . I do not think you will forget me easily , but I entreat you never at any future time to blame yourself . I hope you will be happy and successful . I suppose I must never write to you again : but I shall always pray for you . Papa was very sorry last night for having spoken angrily to you . You must forgive him -- there is great need for forgiveness in this world.--ELLINOR . "

I am afraid my anger made mischief between you and Ellinor , but I think you will forgive a dying man . If you will come back and let all be as it used to be , I will make any apology you may require . If I go , she will be so very friendless ; and I have looked to you to care for her ever since you first-- "

48200	48229	48230	48230	Ellinor	73	" My dear Ellinor , there can be no doubt about it . Your father himself always referred to the losses he had sustained by Dunster 's disappearance . "

48379	48416	48367	48367	she	73	" Not let Ford Bank ! Why ? I do n't understand it -- I ca n't have been clear -- Ellinor , the rent of this house is all you will have to live on ! "
48417	48443	48311	48311	she	73	" I ca n't help it , I ca n't leave this house . Oh , Mr. Ness , I ca n't leave this house . "
48444	48481	48485	48485	himself	1725	" My dear child , you shall not be hurried -- I know how hardly all these things are coming upon you ( and I wish I had never seen Corbet , with all my heart I do!)"--this
48498	48576	48311	48311	she	73	over--"but leave this house you must . You must eat , and the rent of this house must pay for your food ; you must dress , and there is nothing but the rent to clothe you . I will gladly have you to stay at the Parsonage as long as ever you like ; but , in fact , the negotiations with Mr. Osbaldistone , the gentleman who offers to take the house , are nearly completed-- "

Who is that going past the window ? Ellinor riding ? "

I think , wi ' a word from you , they 'd maybe keep me on i ' the stables , and I could look after things a bit ; and the Day o ' Judgment will come at last , when all our secrets will be made known wi'out our having the trouble and the shame o ' telling 'em .

76025	76062	76010	76010	her	73	" Thank you , you must excuse me . I am come strictly on business , otherwise I should never have thought of calling on you at such an hour . It is about poor Dixon . "
76063	76071	76073	76074	the judge	3240	" Ah ! I thought as much ! "
76158	76234	76239	76239	he	2536	" I knew how much you would feel it . Some one at Hellingford told me you were abroad , in Rome , I think . But you must not distress yourself unnecessarily ; the sentence is sure to be commuted to transportation , or something equivalent . I was talking to the Home Secretary about it only last night . Lapse of time and subsequent good character quite preclude any idea of capital punishment . "
76316	76350	76313	76313	Ellinor	73	" I came to tell you , what I suppose may be told to any judge , in confidence and full reliance on his secrecy , that Abraham Dixon was not the murderer . "
76367	76374	76376	76376	he	3240	" Then you know who was ? "
76378	76381	76382	76382	she	73	" Yes , "
76439	76454	76428	76428	he	3240	" This , then , was the shame you told me of long ago ? "
76455	76458	76460	76460	she	73	" Yes , "
76490	76532	76533	76533	He	3240	" Take the kedgeree down , and tell the cook to keep it hot for the judge . It is so tiresome people coming on business here , as if the judge had not his proper hours for being at chambers . "
76567	76580	76564	76564	Ellinor	73	" I am afraid I ought not to have come here now . "
76581	76589	76591	76591	he	3240	" Oh ! it 's all nonsense ! "
76599	76606	76607	76607	He	3240	" You 've done quite right . "
76626	76656	76607	76607	He	3240	" And Dixon knew of this . I believe I must put the fact plainly -- to you -- your father was the guilty person ? he murdered Dunster ? "
76657	76690	76692	76692	Ellinor	73	" Yes . If you call it murder . It was done by a blow , in the heat of passion . No one can ever tell how Dunster always irritated papa , "
76706	76713	76703	76703	she	73	" How do you know this ? "
76764	76797	76756	76756	she	73	" I came into papa 's room just after he had struck Mr. Dunster the blow . He was lying insensible , as we thought -- dead , as he really was . "
76798	76831	76756	76756	she	73	" What was Dixon 's part in it ? He must have known a good deal about it . And the horse - lancet that was found with his name upon it ? "
76832	76882	76883	76884	The judge	3240	" Papa went to wake Dixon , and he brought his fleam -- I suppose to try and bleed him . I have said enough , have I not ? I seem so confused . But I will answer any question to make it appear that Dixon is innocent . "
76984	76992	76994	76994	she	2552	" This will never be made public ? "
76996	77013	76994	76994	she	2552	" No ; I shall take care that no one but the Home Secretary sees it . "
77014	77031	77051	77051	he	3240	" Thank you . I could not help it , now it has come to this . "
77032	77041	77043	77044	the judge	3240	" There are not many men like Dixon , "
77059	77062	77064	77064	Ellinor	73	" No , "
77066	77075	77064	77064	Ellinor	73	" I never knew any one so faithful . "
77109	77112	77114	77115	the judge	3240	" Ellinor ! "
77123	77131	77114	77115	the judge	3240	" we are friends , I hope ? "
77132	77137	77139	77139	she	73	" Yes ; friends , "
77173	77180	77168	77168	he	3240	" Where are you living now ? "
77181	77186	77114	77115	the judge	3240	" At East Chester . "
77187	77233	77168	77168	he	3240	" But you come sometimes to town , do n't you ? Let us know always -- whenever you come ; and Lady Corbet shall call on you . Indeed , I wish you 'd let me bring her to see you to - day . "
77234	77261	77262	77262	He	2559	" Thank you . I am going straight back to Hellingford ; at least , as soon as you can get me the pardon for Dixon . "
77269	77319	77262	77262	He	2559	" The pardon must be sent to the sheriff , who holds the warrant for his execution . But , of course , you may have every assurance that it shall be sent as soon as possible . It is just the same as if he had it now . "
77320	77326	77328	77328	Ellinor	73	" Thank you very much , "
77331	77367	77328	77328	Ellinor	73	" Pray do n't go without breakfast . If you would rather not see Lady Corbet just now , it shall be sent in to you in this room , unless you have already breakfasted . "
77368	77403	77405	77405	she	2560	" No , thank you ; I would rather not . You are very kind , and I am very glad to have seen you once again . There is just one thing more , "
77413	77462	77405	77405	she	2560	" This note to you was found under papa 's pillow after his death ; some of it refers to past things ; but I should be glad if you could think as kindly as you can of poor papa -- and so -- if you will read it-- "
77485	77513	77475	77475	he	2561	" Poor man ! he must have suffered a great deal for that night 's work . And you , Ellinor , you have suffered , too . "
77568	77606	77608	77608	she	2560	" I think I shall be happier now . I always knew it must be found out . Once more , good - by , and thank you . I may take this letter , I suppose ? "
77626	77633	77635	77635	he	2561	" Oh ! certainly , certainly , "
78054	78062	78064	78065	Miss Monro	77	" How white you are , Nelly ! "
78067	78081	78064	78065	Miss Monro	77	" You have been travelling too much and too fast , my child . "
78082	78087	78089	78089	Ellinor	73	" My head aches ! "
78093	78137	78089	78089	Ellinor	73	" But I must go to the castle , and tell my poor Dixon that he is reprieved -- I am so tired ! Will you ask Mr. Johnson to get me leave to see him ? He will know all about it . "
78198	78201	78203	78203	he	143	" Besides , "
78207	78283	78203	78203	he	143	" one scarcely knows whether Miss Wilkins may not give the old man false hopes -- whether she has not been excited to have false hopes herself ; it might be a cruel kindness to let her see him , without more legal certainty as to what his sentence , or reprieve , is to be . By to - morrow morning , if I have properly understood her story , which was a little confused-- "
78284	78294	78297	78298	Miss Monro	77	" She is so dreadfully tired , poor creature , "
78335	78383	78325	78326	Mr. Johnson	143	" Well , then -- it really is the only course open to her besides -- persuade her to rest for this evening . By to - morrow morning I will have obtained the sheriff 's leave , and he will most likely have heard from London . "
78384	78395	78325	78326	Mr. Johnson	143	" Thank you ! I believe that will be best . "
78396	78403	78405	78405	he	143	" It is the only course , "
78600	78605	78607	78607	she	73	" Where is Dixon ? "
78609	78618	78607	78607	she	73	" At the canon 's house at Bromham . "
78630	78633	78624	78625	Dr. Livingstone	184	" Why ? "
78634	78651	78607	78607	she	73	" We thought it better to get him into country air and fresh scenes at once . "
78652	78657	78624	78625	Dr. Livingstone	184	" How is he ? "
78658	78673	78624	78625	Dr. Livingstone	184	" Much better . Get strong , and he shall come to see you . "
78674	78682	78684	78684	Ellinor	73	" You are sure all is right ? "
78686	78697	78684	78684	Ellinor	73	" Sure , my dear . All is quite right . "
78813	78823	78809	78810	Miss Monro	77	" Do you feel strong enough to see Dixon ? "
78824	78829	78784	78784	he	163	" Is he here ? "
78830	78862	78809	78810	Miss Monro	77	" He is at the canon 's house . He sent for him from Bromham , in order that he might be ready for you to see him when you wished . "
78863	78870	78872	78872	Ellinor	73	" Please let him come directly , "
78929	78966	78907	78907	she	73	" Forgive me all the shame and misery , Dixon . Say you forgive me ; and give me your blessing . And then let never a word of the terrible past be spoken between us . "
78967	78984	79025	79025	he	2584	" It 's not for me to forgive you , as never did harm to no one-- "
78985	78997	78907	78907	she	73	" But say you do -- it will ease my heart . "
78998	79003	79005	79005	he	2584	" I forgive thee ! "
79044	79053	79054	79054	he	2584	" Yon 's a good man , missy , "
79069	79076	79054	79054	he	2584	" Better nor t'other ever was . "
79077	79084	79086	79086	Ellinor	73	" He is a good man , "
79157	79161	79163	79163	he	2584	" Miss Wilkins ! "
79180	79215	79216	79216	Ellinor	73	it)--"Miss Wilkins ! is there any chance of your giving me a favourable answer now -- you know what I mean -- what we spoke about at the Great Western Hotel , that day ? "
79221	79231	79218	79218	her	73	" You know that I was once engaged before ? "
79232	79293	79322	79322	she	73	" Yes ! I know ; to Mr. Corbet -- he that is now the judge ; you can not suppose that would make any difference , if that is all . I have loved you , and you only , ever since we met , eighteen years ago . Miss Wilkins -- Ellinor -- put me out of suspense . "
79294	79298	79300	79300	she	73	" I will ! "
79335	79431	79322	79322	she	73	" Wait -- you have not heard all -- my poor , poor father , in a fit of anger , irritated beyond his bearing , struck the blow that killed Mr. Dunster -- Dixon and I knew of it , just after the blow was struck -- we helped to hide it -- we kept the secret -- my poor father died of sorrow and remorse -- you now know all -- can you still love me ? It seems to me as if I had been an accomplice in such a terrible thing ! "
79432	79438	79440	79440	he	2588	" Poor , poor Ellinor ! "
79452	79477	79440	79440	he	2588	" How I wish I had known of all this years and years ago : I could have stood between you and so much ! "
79631	79638	79601	79601	she	77	" A DARK NIGHT 'S WORK . "
