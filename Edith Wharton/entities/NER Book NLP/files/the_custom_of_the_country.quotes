And I gravitated here just as Uncle Harmon B. was looking round for somebody who could give him an inside tip on the Eubaw mine deal -- you know the Driscolls are pretty deep in Eubaw . I happened to go out there after our little unpleasantness at Apex , and it was just the time the deal went through . So in one way your folks did me a good turn when they made Apex too hot for me : funny to think of , ai n't it ? "

She told me straight out what was bothering her . She wants the Marvells to think she 's right out of Kindergarten . ' No goods sent out on approval from this counter .

But you did n't hesitate to kick me when I was down and it 's taken me a day or two to get on my legs again after that kicking . I see my way now to get there and keep there ; and there 's a kinder poetic justice in your being the man to help me up . If I can get hold of fifty thousand dollars within a day or so I do n't care who 's got the start of me . I 've got a dead sure thing in sight , and you 're the only man that can get it for me . Now do you see where we 're coming out ? "

39543	39561	39486	39486	She	192	" We could go and sit in the cathedral -- it 's always cool there at sunset . "
39562	39577	39486	39486	She	192	" We 've sat in the cathedral at sunset every day for a week . "
39578	39611	39524	39524	She	192	" Well , what do you say to stopping at Lecceto on the way ? I have n't shown you Lecceto yet ; and the drive back by moonlight would be glorious . "

39642	39655	39638	39638	Ralph	199	" I do n't believe we could . You 're too practical . "
39656	39681	39486	39486	She	192	" Well , somebody 's got to be . And the food in the hotel is too disgusting if we 're not on time . "
39682	39711	39712	39712	Undine	192	" I admit that the best of it has usually been appropriated by the extremely good - looking cavalry - officer who 's so keen to know you . "
39717	39762	39763	39763	she	192	" You know he 's not a Count ; he 's a Marquis . His name 's Roviano ; his palace in Rome is in the guide - books , and he speaks English beautifully . Celeste found out about him from the headwaiter , "
39791	39807	39808	39808	He	1354	" Then there 's all the more reason for rushing back to defend our share . "

40140	40161	40162	40162	She	192	" Yes . That 's why I chose the summer : so that we could have it all to ourselves . "

40242	40282	40283	40283	Ralph	199	" I know you do n't care how I look . But you did n't give me time to order anything before we were married , and I 've got nothing but my last winter 's things to wear . "

It came to me suddenly , magnificently , swooped down on me as that big white moon swooped down on the black landscape , tore at me like a great white eagle - like the bird of Jove ! After all , imagination WAS the eagle that devoured Prometheus ! "

42404	42475	42398	42398	he	1399	" Of course not here . Wherever you want . The main point is that it 's come to me -- no , that it 's come BACK to me ! For it 's all these months together , it 's all our happiness -- it 's the meaning of life that I 've found , and it 's you , dearest , you who 've given it to me ! "

42539	42568	42488	42488	he	1399	" I do n't know ... I do n't like Europe ... it 's not what I expected , and I think it 's all too dreadfully dreary ! "
42605	42622	42494	42494	her	192	" It 's less interesting than you expected -- or less amusing ? Is that it ? "
42623	42680	42494	42494	her	192	" It 's dirty and ugly -- all the towns we 've been to are disgustingly dirty . I loathe the smells and the beggars . I 'm sick and tired of the stuffy rooms in the hotels . I thought it would all be so splendid -- but New York 's ever so much nicer ! "
42681	42688	42494	42494	her	192	" Not New York in July ? "
42689	42729	42494	42494	her	192	" I do n't care -- there are the roof - gardens , anyway ; and there are always people round . All these places seem as if they were dead . It 's all like some awful cemetery . "

44591	44620	44621	44621	She	192	" I do n't see that you 've got to know people particularly well to go for a walk with them . The Baroness is awfully bright too . "
44645	44671	44672	44672	Ralph	199	" I do n't dispute the interest of what she says ; but I 've told you what decent people think of what she does , "
44704	44746	44685	44685	She	192	" You mean they do n't want to go round with her ? You 're mistaken : it 's not true . She goes round with everybody . She dined last night with the Grand Duchess ; Roviano told me so . "
44763	44775	44753	44753	Ralph	199	" Does he also tell you what 's said of her ? "

44791	44833	44784	44784	Undine	192	" Do you mean that disgusting scandal you told me about ? Do you suppose I 'd let him talk to me about such things ? I meant you 're mistaken about her social position . He says she goes everywhere . "
44838	44862	44863	44863	Undine	192	" No doubt Roviano 's an authority ; but it does n't happen to be his business to choose your friends for you . "
44868	44888	44889	44889	she	192	" Well , I guess I do n't need anybody to do that : I can do it myself , "
44923	44975	44909	44909	Ralph	199	" No , you ca n't , you foolish child . You know nothing of this society you 're in ; of its antecedents , its rules , its conventions ; and it 's my affair to look after you , and warn you when you 're on the wrong track . "
44976	44984	44985	44985	She	192	" Mercy , what a solemn speech ! "
44995	45038	44985	44985	She	192	" I do n't believe an American woman needs to know such a lot about their old rules . They can see I mean to follow my own , and if they do n't like it they need n't go with me . "
45039	45083	45084	45084	She	192	" Oh , they 'll go with you fast enough , as you call it . They 'll be too charmed to . The question is how far they 'll make you go with THEM , and where they 'll finally land you . "

45134	45238	45125	45125	she	192	" I 'm not sure Roviano has n't , in vouching for Madame Adelschein . But he probably thinks you know about her . To him this is n't ' society ' any more than the people in an omnibus are . Society , to everybody here , means the sanction of their own special group and of the corresponding groups elsewhere . The Adelschein goes about in a place like this because it 's nobody 's business to stop her ; but the women who tolerate her here would drop her like a shot if she set foot on their own ground . "
45267	45286	45260	45260	she	192	" Well , that 's easy enough : I can drop her if she comes to New York . "
45537	45573	45574	45574	Ralph	199	" Oh , they 're all well enough -- but father 's lost a lot of money . He 's been speculating , and he ca n't send us anything for at least three months . "

45723	45759	45670	45670	she	192	" But we need n't have left here in August ! It 's the first place in Europe that I 've liked , and it 's just my luck to be dragged away from it ! "
45760	45781	45673	45673	her	192	" I 'm so awfully sorry , dearest . It 's my fault for persuading you to marry a pauper . "
45782	45809	45810	45810	She	192	" It 's father 's fault . Why on earth did he go and speculate ? There 's no use his saying he 's sorry now ! "

45860	45894	45895	45895	Undine	192	" I could n't ask them -- it 's not possible . My grandfather does as much as he can for me , and my mother has nothing but what he gives her . "

I wish now I had n't listened to you -- father'd have had to pay for THAT before he lost his money . As it is , it will be cheaper in the end for me to pick up a few things here . The advantage of going to the French dress - makers is that they 'll wait twice as long for their money as the people at home . And they 're all crazy to dress me -- Bertha Shallum will tell you so : she says no one ever had such a chance ! That 's why I was willing to come to this stuffy little hotel -- I wanted to save every scrap I could to get a few decent things . And over here they 're accustomed to being bargained with -- you ought to see how I 've beaten them down ! Have you any idea what a dinner - dress costs in New York-- ? "

He told us the other day they had n't dined at home for a month . Undine does n't seem to notice how hard he works . "
57612	57619	57604	57604	Bowen	314	" No -- why should she ? "
57620	57629	57431	57431	she	192	" Why SHOULD she ? Really , Charles-- ! "
57630	57642	57431	57431	she	192	" Why should she , when she knows nothing about it ? "
57643	57667	57431	57431	she	192	" She may know nothing about his business ; but she must know it 's her extravagance that 's forced him into it . "
57675	57686	57668	57669	Mrs. Fairford	204	" You talk as if you were on her side ! "
57687	57726	57431	57431	she	192	" Are there sides already ? If so , I want to look down on them impartially from the heights of pure speculation . I want to get a general view of the whole problem of American marriages . "
57739	57763	57727	57728	Mrs. Fairford	204	" If that 's what you want you must make haste ! Most of them do n't last long enough to be classified . "
57764	57795	57431	57431	she	192	" I grant you it takes an active mind . But the weak point is so frequently the same that after a time one knows where to look for it . "
57796	57805	57806	57806	He	314	" What do you call the weak point ? "
57809	57822	57806	57806	He	314	" The fact that the average American looks down on his wife . "
57831	57840	57841	57841	Bowen	314	" If that 's where paradox lands you ! "
57847	57939	57844	57844	his	314	" Well -- doesn't he prove it ? How much does he let her share in the real business of life ? How much does he rely on her judgment and help in the conduct of serious affairs ? Take Ralph for instance -- you say his wife 's extravagance forces him to work too hard ; but that 's not what 's wrong . It 's normal for a man to work hard for a woman -- what 's abnormal is his not caring to tell her anything about it . "
57940	57955	57806	57806	He	314	" To tell Undine ? She 'd be bored to death if he did ! "
57956	58034	58035	58036	Mrs. Fairford	204	" Just so ; she 'd even feel aggrieved . But why ? Because it 's against the custom of the country . And whose fault is that ? The man 's again -- I do n't mean Ralph I mean the genus he belongs to : homo sapiens , Americanus . Why have n't we taught our women to take an interest in our work ? Simply because we do n't take enough interest in THEM . "
58059	58081	58052	58052	his	1689	" YOU do n't ? The American man doesn't -- the most slaving , self - effacing , self - sacrificing-- ? "
58082	58174	57806	57806	He	314	" Yes ; and the most indifferent : there 's the point . The ' slaving 's ' no argument against the indifference To slave for women is part of the old American tradition ; lots of people give their lives for dogmas they 've ceased to believe in . Then again , in this country the passion for making money has preceded the knowing how to spend it , and the American man lavishes his fortune on his wife because he does n't know what else to do with it . "
58175	58196	57806	57806	He	314	" Then you call it a mere want of imagination for a man to spend his money on his wife ? "
58197	58402	58403	58403	Bowen	314	" Not necessarily -- but it 's a want of imagination to fancy it 's all he owes her . Look about you and you 'll see what I mean . Why does the European woman interest herself so much more in what the men are doing ? Because she 's so important to them that they make it worth her while ! She 's not a parenthesis , as she is here -- she 's in the very middle of the picture . I 'm not implying that Ralph is n't interested in his wife -- he 's a passionate , a pathetic exception . But even he has to conform to an environment where all the romantic values are reversed . Where does the real life of most American men lie ? In some woman 's drawing - room or in their offices ? The answer 's obvious , is n't it ? The emotional centre of gravity 's not the same in the two hemispheres . In the effete societies it 's love , in our new one it 's business . In America the real crime passionnel is a ' big steal'--there 's more excitement in wrecking railways than homes . "
58417	58630	58414	58414	his	314	" Is n't that the key to our easy divorces ? If we cared for women in the old barbarous possessive way do you suppose we 'd give them up as readily as we do ? The real paradox is the fact that the men who make , materially , the biggest sacrifices for their women , should do least for them ideally and romantically . And what 's the result -- how do the women avenge themselves ? All my sympathy 's with them , poor deluded dears , when I see their fallacious little attempt to trick out the leavings tossed them by the preoccupied male -- the money and the motors and the clothes -- and pretend to themselves and each other that THAT 'S what really constitutes life ! Oh , I know what you 're going to say -- it 's less and less of a pretense with them , I grant you ; they 're more and more succumbing to the force of the suggestion ; but here and there I fancy there 's one who still sees through the humbug , and knows that money and motors and clothes are simply the big bribe she 's paid for keeping out of some man 's way ! "
58653	58662	58646	58646	she	204	" And is Undine one of the exceptions ? "
58672	58703	58663	58664	Her companion	887	" No -- she 's a monstrously perfect result of the system : the completest proof of its triumph . It 's Ralph who 's the victim and the exception . "
58704	58710	58711	58712	Mrs. Fairford	204	" Ah , poor Ralph ! "
58718	58727	58728	58728	she	204	" I hear him now . I suppose , "
58734	58751	58728	58728	she	204	" we ca n't give him your explanation for his wife 's having forgotten to come ? "
58785	58800	58781	58782	Ralph Marvell	199	" Well , Laura ! Hallo , Charles -- have you been celebrating too ? "
58807	58842	58843	58843	He	314	" It 's outrageous of me to be so late , and I dare n't look my son in the face ! But I stayed down town to make provision for his future birthdays . "
58850	58869	58871	58871	he	314	" Do n't tell me the party 's over , and the guest of honour gone to bed ? "
58915	58932	58933	58933	He	314	" Sit down , Ralph -- you look tired . I 'll give you some tea . "
58941	58965	58966	58966	He	314	" I did have rather a rush to get here -- but had n't I better join the revellers ? Where are they ? "
58983	58998	58999	58999	He	314	" Hallo -- where have they all gone to ? What a jolly cake ! "
59005	59015	58999	58999	He	314	" Why , it 's never even been cut ! "
59022	59030	59016	59017	Mrs. Fairford	204	" Come and have your tea first . "
59031	59056	59060	59060	her	3743	" No , no -- tea afterward , thanks . Are they all upstairs with my grandfather ? I must make my peace with Undine-- "
59073	59079	59060	59060	her	3743	" Undine did n't come . "
59080	59092	59060	59060	her	3743	" Did n't come ? Who brought the boy , then ? "
59093	59109	59110	59110	Ralph	199	" He did n't come either . That 's why the cake 's not cut . "
59113	59128	59110	59110	Ralph	199	" What 's the mystery ? Is he ill , or what 's happened ? "
59129	59162	59163	59163	She	3743	" Nothing 's happened -- Paul 's all right . Apparently Undine forgot . She never went home for him , and the nurse waited till it was too late to come . "
59183	59191	59192	59192	He	314	" Poor little Paul -- poor chap ! "
59198	59206	59192	59192	He	314	" Yes , please -- some tea . "
59255	59298	59246	59246	his	314	" But this wo n't do . I must rush home and see the poor chap before dinner . And my mother -- and my grandfather ? I want to say a word to them -- I must make Paul 's excuses ! "
59299	59330	59379	59379	Bowen	314	" Grandfather 's taking his nap . And mother had to rush out for a postponed committee meeting -- she left as soon as we heard Paul was n't coming . "
59331	59337	59338	59338	He	314	" Ah , I see . "
59343	59362	59363	59363	He	314	" Yes , make the strong , please . I 've had a beastly fagging sort of day . "
59466	59479	59480	59480	He	314	" There 's Undine ! I wonder what could have kept her . "
59511	59554	59503	59503	she	228	" What luck to find you ! No , not luck -- I came because I knew you 'd be here . He never comes near me , Laura : I have to hunt him down to get a glimpse of him ! "
59576	59667	59668	59668	She	228	" Yes , I knew I 'd catch you here . I knew it was the boy 's birthday , and I 've brought him a present : a vulgar expensive Van Degen offering . I 've not enough imagination left to find the right thing , the thing it takes feeling and not money to buy . When I look for a present nowadays I never say to the shopman : ' I want this or that'--I simply say : ' Give me something that costs so much . ' "
59676	59696	59668	59668	She	228	" Where 's the victim of my vulgarity ? Let me crush him under the weight of my gold . "

But my marriage was a mistake from the beginning ; and Ralph feels just as I do about it . His people hate me , they 've always hated me ; and he looks at everything as they do . They 've never forgiven me for his having had to go into business -- with their aristocratic ideas they look down on a man who works for his living . Of course it 's all right for YOU to do it , because you 're not a Marvell or a Dagonet ; but they think Ralph ought to just lie back and let you support the baby and me . "

68175	68217	68035	68035	he	614	" Of course not ; he was n't brought up to it , and in his heart of hearts he 's ashamed of having to do it . He told me it was killing a little more of him every day . "

68310	68469	68470	68471	Mr. Spragg	191	" That 's just what I mean ! I do n't believe they 've even called on mother this year , have they ? Last year they just left their cards without asking . And why do you suppose they never invite you to dine ? In their set lots of people older than you and mother dine every night of the winter -- society 's full of them . The Marvells are ashamed to have you meet their friends : that 's the reason . They 're ashamed to have it known that Ralph married an Apex girl , and that you and mother have n't always had your own servants and carriages ; and Ralph 's ashamed of it too , now he 's got over being crazy about me . If he was free I believe he 'd turn round to - morrow and marry that Ray girl his mother 's saving up for him . "

68735	68776	68728	68729	Her father	614	" I guess most of us feel that once in a way when we 're youngy , Undine . Later on you 'll see going away ai n't much use when you 've got to turn round and come back . "
68797	68827	68777	68777	She	192	" That 's just it -- that 's the reason I 'm so wild to go ; because it MIGHT mean I would n't ever have to come back . "

101897	102215	102216	102218	the wrong people	2612	" XXV Undine Marvell , for the next few months , tasted all the accumulated bitterness of failure . After January the drifting hordes of her compatriots had scattered to the four quarters of the globe , leaving Paris to resume , under its low grey sky , its compacter winter personality . Noting , from her more and more deserted corner , each least sign of the social revival , Undine felt herself as stranded and baffled as after the ineffectual summers of her girlhood . She was not without possible alternatives ; but the sense of what she had lost took the savour from all that was left . She might have attached herself to some migratory group winged for Italy or Egypt ; but the prospect of travel did not in itself appeal to her , and she was doubtful of its social benefit . She lacked the adventurous curiosity which seeks its occasion in the unknown ; and though she could work doggedly for a given object the obstacles to be overcome had to be as distinct as the prize . Her one desire was to get back an equivalent of the precise value she had lost in ceasing to be Ralph Marvell 's wife . Her new visiting - card , bearing her Christian name in place of her husband 's , was like the coin of a debased currency testifying to her diminished trading capacity . Her restricted means , her vacant days , all the minor irritations of her life , were as nothing compared to this sense of a lost advantage . Even in the narrowed field of a Parisian winter she might have made herself a place in some more or less extra - social world ; but her experiments in this line gave her no pleasure proportioned to the possible derogation . She feared to be associated with "
102220	102299	101894	101894	his	198	" and scented a shade of disrespect in every amicable advance . The more pressing attentions of one or two men she had formerly known filled her with a glow of outraged pride , and for the first time in her life she felt that even solitude might be preferable to certain kinds of society . Since ill health was the most plausible pretext for seclusion , it was almost a relief to find that she was really growing "
102301	103043	101894	101894	his	198	" and sleeping badly . The doctor she summoned advised her trying a small quiet place on the Riviera , not too near the sea ; and thither in the early days of December , she transported herself with her maid and an omnibus - load of luggage . The place disconcerted her by being really small and quiet , and for a few days she struggled against the desire for flight . She had never before known a world as colourless and negative as that of the large white hotel where everybody went to bed at nine , and donkey - rides over stony hills were the only alternative to slow drives along dusty roads . Many of the dwellers in this temple of repose found even these exercises too stimulating , and preferred to sit for hours under the palms in the garden , playing Patience , embroidering , or reading odd volumes of Tauchnitz . Undine , driven by despair to an inspection of the hotel book - shelves , discovered that scarcely any work they contained was complete ; but this did not seem to trouble the readers , who continued to feed their leisure with mutilated fiction , from which they occasionally raised their eyes to glance mistrustfully at the new arrival sweeping the garden gravel with her frivolous draperies . The inmates of the hotel were of different nationalities , but their racial differences were levelled by the stamp of a common mediocrity . All differences of tongue , of custom , of physiognomy , disappeared in this deep community of insignificance , which was like some secret bond , with the manifold signs and pass - words of its ignorances and its imperceptions . It was not the heterogeneous mediocrity of the American summer hotel where the lack of any standard is the nearest approach to a tie , but an organized codified dulness , in conscious possession of its rights , and strong in the voluntary ignorance of any others . It took Undine a long time to accustom herself to such an atmosphere , and meanwhile she fretted , fumed and flaunted , or abandoned herself to long periods of fruitless brooding . Sometimes a flame of anger shot up in her , dismally illuminating the path she had travelled and the blank wall to which it led . At other moments past and present were enveloped in a dull fog of rancour which distorted and faded even the image she presented to her morning mirror . There were days when every young face she saw left in her a taste of poison . But when she compared herself with the specimens of her sex who plied their languid industries under the palms , or looked away as she passed them in hall or staircase , her spirits rose , and she rang for her maid and dressed herself in her newest and vividest . These were unprofitable triumphs , however . She never made one of her attacks on the organized disapproval of the community without feeling she had lost ground by it ; and the next day she would lie in bed and send down capricious orders for food , which her maid would presently remove untouched , with instructions to transmit her complaints to the landlord . Sometimes the events of the past year , ceaselessly revolving through her brain , became no longer a subject for criticism or justification but simply a series of pictures monotonously unrolled . Hour by hour , in such moods , she re - lived the incidents of her flight with Peter Van Degen : the part of her career that , since it had proved a failure , seemed least like herself and most difficult to justify . She had gone away with him , and had lived with him for two months : she , Undine Marvell , to whom respectability was the breath of life , to whom such follies had always been unintelligible and therefore inexcusable.--She had done this incredible thing , and she had done it from a motive that seemed , at the time , as clear , as logical , as free from the distorting mists of sentimentality , as any of her father 's financial enterprises . It had been a bold move , but it had been as carefully calculated as the happiest Wall Street "
103046	103329	104307	104307	mother	3774	" She had gone away with Peter because , after the decisive scene in which she had put her power to the test , to yield to him seemed the surest means of victory . Even to her practical intelligence it was clear that an immediate dash to Dakota might look too calculated ; and she had preserved her self - respect by telling herself that she was really his wife , and in no way to blame if the law delayed to ratify the bond . She was still persuaded of the justness of her reasoning ; but she now saw that it had left certain risks out of account . Her life with Van Degen had taught her many things . The two had wandered from place to place , spending a great deal of money , always more and more money ; for the first time in her life she had been able to buy everything she wanted . For a while this had kept her amused and busy ; but presently she began to perceive that her companion 's view of their relation was not the same as hers . She saw that he had always meant it to be an unavowed tie , screened by Mrs. Shallum 's companionship and Clare 's careless tolerance ; and that on those terms he would have been ready to shed on their adventure the brightest blaze of notoriety . But since Undine had insisted on being carried off like a sentimental school - girl he meant to shroud the affair in mystery , and was as zealous in concealing their relation as she was bent on proclaiming it . In the "
103331	104154	104307	104307	mother	3774	" novels which Popple was fond of lending her she had met with increasing frequency the type of heroine who scorns to love clandestinely , and proclaims the sanctity of passion and the moral duty of obeying its call . Undine had been struck by these arguments as justifying and even ennobling her course , and had let Peter understand that she had been actuated by the highest motives in openly associating her life with his ; but he had opposed a placid insensibility to these allusions , and had persisted in treating her as though their journey were the kind of escapade that a man of the world is bound to hide . She had expected him to take her to all the showy places where couples like themselves are relieved from a too sustained contemplation of nature by the distractions of the restaurant and the gaming - table ; but he had carried her from one obscure corner of Europe to another , shunning fashionable hotels and crowded watering - places , and displaying an ingenuity in the discovery of the unvisited and the out - of - season that gave their journey an odd resemblance to her melancholy wedding - tour . She had never for a moment ceased to remember that the Dakota divorce - court was the objective point of this later honeymoon , and her allusions to the fact were as frequent as prudence permitted . Peter seemed in no way disturbed by them . He responded with expressions of increasing tenderness , or the purchase of another piece of jewelry ; and though Undine could not remember his ever voluntarily bringing the subject of their marriage he did not shrink from her recurring mention of it . He seemed merely too steeped in present well - being to think of the future , and she ascribed this to the fact that his faculty of enjoyment could not project itself beyond the moment . Her business was to make each of their days so agreeable that when the last came he should be conscious of a void to be bridged over as rapidly as possible and when she thought this point had been reached she packed her trunks and started for Dakota . The next picture to follow was that of the dull months in the western divorce - town , where , to escape loneliness and avoid comment , she had cast in her lot with Mabel Lipscomb , who had lately arrived there on the same errand . Undine , at the outset , had been sorry for the friend whose new venture seemed likely to result so much less brilliantly than her own ; but compassion had been replaced by irritation as Mabel 's unpruned vulgarities , her enormous encroaching satisfaction with herself and her surroundings , began to pervade every corner of their provisional household . Undine , during the first months of her exile , had been sustained by the fullest confidence in her future . When she had parted from Van Degen she had felt sure he meant to marry her , and the fact that Mrs. Lipscomb was fortified by no similar hope made her easier to bear with . Undine was almost ashamed that the unwooed Mabel should be the witness of her own felicity , and planned to send her off on a trip to Denver when Peter should announce his arrival ; but the weeks passed , and Peter did not come . Mabel , on the whole , behaved well in this contingency . Undine , in her first exultation , had confided all her hopes and plans to her friend , but Mabel took no undue advantage of the confidence . She was even tactful in her loud fond clumsy way , with a tact that insistently boomed and buzzed about its victim 's head . But one day she mentioned that she had asked to dinner a gentleman from Little Rock who had come to Dakota with the same object as themselves , and whose acquaintance she had made through her lawyer . The gentleman from Little Rock came to dine , and within a week Undine understood that Mabel 's future was assured . If Van Degen had been at hand Undine would have smiled with him at poor Mabel 's infatuation and her suitor 's crudeness . But Van Degen was not there . He made no sign , he sent no excuse ; he simply continued to absent himself ; and it was Undine who , in due course , had to make way for Mrs. Lipscomb 's caller , and sit upstairs with a novel while the drawing - room below was given up to the enacting of an actual love - story . Even then , even to the end , Undine had to admit that Mabel had behaved "
104157	104299	104307	104307	mother	3774	" But it is comparatively easy to behave beautifully when one is getting what one wants , and when some one else , who has not always been altogether kind , is not . The net result of Mrs. Lipscomb 's magnanimity was that when , on the day of parting , she drew Undine to her bosom with the hand on which her new engagement - ring blazed , Undine hated her as she hated everything else connected with her vain exile in the wilderness . XXVI The next phase in the unrolling vision was the episode of her return to New York . She had gone to the Malibran , to her parents -- for it was a moment in her career when she clung passionately to the conformities , and when the fact of being able to say : "
104308	104408	104529	104529	her	2615	" was worth paying for even in the discomfort of that grim abode . Nevertheless , it was another thorn in her pride that her parents could not -- for the meanest of material reasons -- transfer themselves at her coming to one of the big Fifth Avenue hotels . When she had suggested it Mr. Spragg had briefly replied that , owing to the heavy expenses of her divorce suit , he could n't for the moment afford anything better ; and this announcement cast a deeper gloom over the future . It was not an occasion for being "
104411	104527	104529	104529	her	2615	" however ; she had learned too many hard facts in the last few months to think of having recourse to her youthful methods . And something told her that if she made the attempt it would be useless . Her father and mother seemed much older , seemed tired and defeated , like herself . Parents and daughter bore their common failure in a common silence , broken only by Mrs. Spragg 's occasional tentative allusions to her grandson . But her anecdotes of Paul left a deeper silence behind them . Undine did not want to talk of her boy . She could forget him when , as she put it , things were "
104532	104631	104529	104529	her	2615	" but in moments of discouragement the thought of him was an added bitterness , subtly different from her other bitter thoughts , and harder to quiet . It had not occurred to her to try to gain possession of the child . She was vaguely aware that the courts had given her his custody ; but she had never seriously thought of asserting this claim . Her parents ' diminished means and her own uncertain future made her regard the care of Paul as an additional burden , and she quieted her scruples by thinking of him as "
104634	104676	104529	104529	her	2615	" with Ralph 's family , and of herself as rather touchingly disinterested in putting his welfare before her own . Poor Mrs. Spragg was pining for him , but Undine rejected her artless suggestion that Mrs. Heeny should be sent to "

104706	104913	104922	104922	people	560	" she scornfully declared ; but it pained her that her boy , should be so near , yet inaccessible , and for the first time she was visited by unwonted questionings as to her share in the misfortunes that had befallen her . She had voluntarily stepped out of her social frame , and the only person on whom she could with any satisfaction have laid the blame was the person to whom her mind now turned with a belated tenderness . It was thus , in fact , that she thought of Ralph . His pride , his reserve , all the secret expressions of his devotion , the tones of his voice , his quiet manner , even his disconcerting irony : these seemed , in contrast to what she had since known , the qualities essential to her happiness . She could console herself only by regarding it as part of her sad lot that poverty and the relentless animosity of his family , should have put an end to so perfect a union : she gradually began to look on herself and Ralph as the victims of dark machinations , and when she mentioned him she spoke forgivingly , and implied that "

She had arrived in New York in midseason , and the dread of seeing familiar faces kept her shut up in her room at the Malibran , reading novels and brooding over possibilities of escape . She tried to avoid the daily papers , but they formed the staple diet of her parents , and now and then she could not help taking one up and turning to the "
105005	105237	105313	105313	You	2620	" Its perusal produced the impression that the season must be the gayest New York had ever known . The Harmon B. Driscolls , young Jim and his wife , the Thurber Van Degens , the Chauncey Ellings , and all the other Fifth Avenue potentates , seemed to have their doors perpetually open to a stream of feasters among whom the familiar presences of Grace Beringer , Bertha Shallum , Dicky Bowles and Claud Walsingham Popple came and went with the irritating sameness of the figures in a stage - procession . Among them also Peter Van Degen presently appeared . He had been on a tour around the world , and Undine could not look at a newspaper without seeing some allusion to his progress . After his return she noticed that his name was usually coupled with his wife 's : he and Clare seemed to be celebrating his home - coming in a series of festivities , and Undine guessed that he had reasons for wishing to keep before the world the evidences of his conjugal accord . Mrs. Heeny 's clippings supplied her with such items as her own reading missed ; and one day the masseuse appeared with a long article from the leading journal of Little Rock , describing the brilliant nuptials of Mabel Lipscomb -- now Mrs. Homer Branney -- and her departure for "
105240	105312	105315	105315	you	2620	" in the bridegroom 's private car . This put the last touch to Undine 's irritation , and the next morning she got up earlier than usual , put on her most effective dress , went for a quick walk around the Park , and told her father when she came in that she wanted him to take her to the opera that evening . Mr. Spragg stared and frowned . "
105328	105329	105315	105315	you	2620	" "
105334	105353	105361	105361	I	0	" Undine coloured at the infelicitous allusion : besides , she knew now that the smart people who were "

105387	105636	105648	105648	we	2622	" she added . Her father received the latter part of the request without comment : he seemed to have gone beyond surprise . But he appeared that evening at dinner in a creased and loosely fitting dress - suit which he had probably not put on since the last time he had dined with his son - in - law , and he and Undine drove off together , leaving Mrs. Spragg to gaze after them with the pale stare of Hecuba . Their stalls were in the middle of the house , and around them swept the great curve of boxes at which Undine had so often looked up in the remote Stentorian days . Then all had been one indistinguishable glitter , now the scene was full of familiar details : the house was thronged with people she knew , and every box seemed to contain a parcel of her past . At first she had shrunk from recognition ; but gradually , as she perceived that no one noticed her , that she was merely part of the invisible crowd out of range of the exploring opera glasses , she felt a defiant desire to make herself seen . When the performance was over her father wanted to leave the house by the door at which they had entered , but she guided him toward the stockholders ' entrance , and pressed her way among the furred and jewelled ladies waiting for their motors . "
105659	105786	105788	105788	I	0	" she exclaimed , speaking loudly enough to be overheard . Two or three heads turned , and she met Dicky Bowles 's glance , and returned his laughing bow . The woman talking to him looked around , coloured slightly , and made a barely perceptible motion of her head . Just beyond her , Mrs. Chauncey Elling , plumed and purple , stared , parted her lips , and turned to say something important to young Jim Driscoll , who looked up involuntarily and then squared his shoulders and gazed fixedly at a distant point , as people do at a funeral . Behind them Undine caught sight of Clare Van Degen ; she stood alone , and her face was pale and listless . "
105796	105972	105788	105788	I	0	" Undine wondered . Some intuition told her that , alone of all the women present , Clare might have greeted her kindly ; but she hung back , and Mrs. Harmon Driscoll surged by on Popple 's arm . Popple crimsoned , coughed , and signalled despotically to Mrs. Driscoll 's footman . Over his shoulder Undine received a bow from Charles Bowen , and behind Bowen she saw two or three other men she knew , and read in their faces surprise , curiosity , and the wish to show their pleasure at seeing her . But she grasped her father 's arm and drew him out among the entangled motors and vociferating policemen . Neither she nor Mr. Spragg spoke a word on the way home ; but when they reached the Malibran her father followed her up to her room . She had dropped her cloak and stood before the wardrobe mirror studying her reflection when he came up behind her and she saw that he was looking at it too . "
105980	106031	106042	106042	RALPH	199	" Undine 's neck grew pink under the shining circlet . It was the first time since her return to New York that she had put on a low dress and thus uncovered the string of pearls she always wore . She made no answer , and Mr. Spragg continued : "
106040	106041	106042	106042	RALPH	199	" "
106044	106052	106042	106042	RALPH	199	" She could not restrain a laugh . "
106058	106109	106124	106124	I	0	" Undine remained silent . She really had not thought about the pearls , except in so far as she consciously enjoyed the pleasure of possessing them ; and her father , habitually so unobservant , had seemed the last person likely to raise the awkward question of their origin . "
106111	106123	106126	106126	you	2625	" she began , without knowing what she meant to say . "
106138	106151	106177	106177	You	2625	" Mr. Spragg continued , in a voice she did not know . "
106157	106176	106177	106177	You	2625	" she flamed up . He looked at her as if she had grown suddenly small and insignificant . "
106194	106793	106177	106177	You	2625	" he said as he went out of the room . As far as Undine could remember , it was the first time in her life that he had ever ordered her to do anything ; and when the door closed on him she had the distinct sense that the question had closed with it , and that she would have to obey . She took the pearls off and threw them from her angrily . The humiliation her father had inflicted on her was merged with the humiliation to which she had subjected herself in going to the opera , and she had never before hated her life as she hated it then . All night she lay sleepless , wondering miserably what to do ; and out of her hatred of her life , and her hatred of Peter Van Degen , there gradually grew a loathing of Van Degen 's pearls . How could she have kept them ; how have continued to wear them about her neck ! Only her absorption in other cares could have kept her from feeling the humiliation of carrying about with her the price of her shame . Her novel - reading had filled her mind with the vocabulary of outraged virtue , and with pathetic allusions to woman 's frailty , and while she pitied herself she thought her father heroic . She was proud to think that she had such a man to defend her , and rejoiced that it was in her power to express her scorn of Van Degen by sending back his jewels . But her righteous ardour gradually cooled , and she was left once more to face the dreary problem of the future . Her evening at the opera had shown her the impossibility of remaining in New York . She had neither the skill nor the power to fight the forces of indifference leagued against her : she must get away at once , and try to make a fresh start . But , as usual , the lack of money hampered her . Mr. Spragg could no longer afford to make her the allowance she had intermittently received from him during the first years of her marriage , and since she was now without child or household she could hardly make it a grievance that he had reduced her income . But what he allowed her , even with the addition of her alimony , was absurdly insufficient . Not that she looked far ahead ; she had always felt herself predestined to ease and luxury , and the possibility of a future adapted to her present budget did not occur to her . But she desperately wanted enough money to carry her without anxiety through the coming year . When her breakfast tray was brought in she sent it away untouched and continued to lie in her darkened room . She knew that when she got up she must send back the pearls ; but there was no longer any satisfaction in the thought , and she lay listlessly wondering how she could best transmit them to Van Degen . As she lay there she heard Mrs. Heeny 's voice in the passage . Hitherto she had avoided the masseuse , as she did every one else associated with her past . Mrs. Heeny had behaved with extreme discretion , refraining from all direct allusions to Undine 's misadventure ; but her silence was obviously the criticism of a superior mind . Once again Undine had disregarded her injunction to "
106797	106830	106840	106840	you	192	" with results that justified the warning . Mrs. Heeny 's very reserve , however , now marked her as a safe adviser ; and Undine sprang up and called her in . "
106851	106879	106840	106840	you	192	" the masseuse exclaimed in her round rich tones . Undine , without answering , caught up the pearls and thrust them into Mrs. Heeny 's hands . "
106884	106902	106918	106919	Undine Spragg	192	" The masseuse dropped into a chair and let the twist slip through her fat flexible fingers . "
106921	106927	106940	106940	'em	2630	" Undine murmured something indistinguishable . "
106934	106938	106940	106940	'em	2630	" she began . "
106945	106946	106928	106928	I	0	" "
106950	107041	106940	106940	'em	2630	" She was checked by the wondering simplicity of Mrs. Heeny 's stare . The masseuse must know where the pearls had come from , yet it had evidently not occurred to her that Mrs. Marvell was about to ask her to return them to their donor . In the light of Mrs. Heeny 's unclouded gaze the whole episode took on a different aspect , and Undine began to be vaguely astonished at her immediate submission to her father 's will . The pearls were hers , after all ! "
107048	107054	107057	107057	you	192	" Mrs. Heeny placidly suggested . "
107079	107133	107137	107137	I	0	" As Undine listened , a new thought shaped itself . She could not continue to wear the pearls : the idea had become intolerable . But for the first time she saw what they might be converted into , and what they might rescue her from ; and suddenly she brought out : "
107144	107145	107057	107057	you	192	" "
107152	107153	107197	107197	I	0	" "
107180	107196	107231	107231	you	192	" Under Mrs. Heeny 's simplifying eye it was comparatively easy to make these explanations . "
107238	107244	107247	107247	you	192	" she pressed on breathlessly . "
107258	107271	107284	107284	you	192	" said Mrs. Heeny , coiling the pearls in her big palm . "
107289	107407	107284	107284	you	192	" she added , as the necklace vanished into her bag . A few days later there appeared from the same receptacle a bundle of banknotes considerable enough to quiet Undine 's last scruples . She no longer understood why she had hesitated . Why should she have thought it necessary to give back the pearls to Van Degen ? His obligation to her represented far more than the relatively small sum she had been able to realize on the necklace . She hid the money in her dress , and when Mrs. Heeny had gone on to Mrs. Spragg 's room she drew the packet out , and counting the bills over , murmured to herself : "
107414	107573	107284	107284	you	192	" Her one thought was to return to Europe ; but she did not want to go alone . The vision of her solitary figure adrift in the spring mob of trans - Atlantic pleasure - seekers depressed and mortified her . She would be sure to run across acquaintances , and they would infer that she was in quest of a new opportunity , a fresh start , and would suspect her of trying to use them for the purpose . The thought was repugnant to her newly awakened pride , and she decided that if she went to Europe her father and mother must go with her . The project was a bold one , and when she broached it she had to run the whole gamut of Mr. Spragg 's irony . He wanted to know what she expected to do with him when she got him there ; whether she meant to introduce him to "
107579	107622	107649	107649	You	2636	" how she thought he and her mother would look in court dress , and how she supposed he was going to get on without his New York paper . But Undine had been aware of having what he himself would have called "
107625	107648	107649	107649	You	2636	" over her father since , the day after their visit to the opera , he had taken her aside to ask : "
107655	107662	107663	107664	Mrs. Heeny	193	" and she had answered coldly : "
107669	107837	107649	107649	You	2636	" After a moment of half - bewildered resistance her parents , perhaps secretly flattered by this first expression of her need for them , had yielded to her entreaty , packed their trunks , and stoically set out for the unknown . Neither Mr. Spragg nor his wife had ever before been out of their country ; and Undine had not understood , till they stood beside her tongue - tied and helpless on the dock at Cherbourg , the task she had undertaken in uprooting them . Mr. Spragg had never been physically active , but on foreign shores he was seized by a strange restlessness , and a helpless dependence on his daughter . Mrs. Spragg 's long habit of apathy was overcome by her dread of being left alone when her husband and Undine went out , and she delayed and impeded their expeditions by insisting on accompanying them ; so that , much as Undine disliked sightseeing , there seemed no alternative between "
107840	108085	107649	107649	You	2636	" with her parents and shutting herself up with them in the crowded hotels to which she successively transported them . The hotels were the only European institutions that really interested Mr. Spragg . He considered them manifestly inferior to those at home ; but he was haunted by a statistical curiosity as to their size , their number , their cost and their capacity for housing and feeding the incalculable hordes of his countrymen . He went through galleries , churches and museums in a stolid silence like his daughter 's ; but in the hotels he never ceased to enquire and investigate , questioning every one who could speak English , comparing bills , collecting prospectuses and computing the cost of construction and the probable return on the investment . He regarded the non - existence of the cold - storage system as one more proof of European inferiority , and no longer wondered , in the absence of the room - to - room telephone , that foreigners had n't yet mastered the first principles of time - saving . After a few weeks it became evident to both parents and daughter that their unnatural association could not continue much longer . Mrs. Spragg 's shrinking from everything new and unfamiliar had developed into a kind of settled terror , and Mr. Spragg had begun to be depressed by the incredible number of the hotels and their simply incalculable housing capacity . "
108125	108169	108335	108335	Undie	240	" And he began to reckon up , on slips of paper , on the backs of bills and the margins of old newspapers , the number of travellers who could be simultaneously lodged , bathed and boarded on the continent of Europe . "
108301	108331	108620	108620	I	0	" He had gone on in this fashion for what seemed to his daughter an endless length of days ; and then suddenly he had roused himself to say : "
108352	108619	108732	108732	Sacha	362	" There had been no question on the part of any of the three of Undine 's returning with them ; and after she had conveyed them to their steamer , and seen their vaguely relieved faces merged in the handkerchief - waving throng along the taffrail , she had returned alone to Paris and made her unsuccessful attempt to enlist the aid of Indiana Rolliver . XXVII She was still brooding over this last failure when one afternoon , as she loitered on the hotel terrace , she was approached by a young woman whom she had seen sitting near the wheeled chair of an old lady wearing a crumpled black bonnet under a funny fringed parasol with a jointed handle . The young woman , who was small , slight and brown , was dressed with a disregard of the fashion which contrasted oddly with the mauve powder on her face and the traces of artificial colour in her dark untidy hair . She looked as if she might have several different personalities , and as if the one of the moment had been hanging up a long time in her wardrobe and been hurriedly taken down as probably good enough for the present occasion . With her hands in her jacket pockets , and an agreeable smile on her boyish face , she strolled up to Undine and asked , in a pretty variety of Parisian English , if she had the pleasure of speaking to Mrs. Marvell . On Undine 's assenting , the smile grew more alert and the lady continued : "
108629	108731	108745	108745	you	2650	" No question could have been less welcome to Undine . If there was one point on which she was doggedly and puritanically resolved , it was that no extremes of social adversity should ever again draw her into the group of people among whom Madame Adelschein too conspicuously figured . Since her unsuccessful attempt to win over Indiana by introducing her to that group , Undine had been righteously resolved to remain aloof from it ; and she was drawing herself up to her loftiest height of disapproval when the stranger , as if unconscious of it , went on : "
108752	108762	108774	108775	my mother	4182	" she added , looking into Undine 's eyes . "
108780	108978	109092	109092	You	0	" The murmur of negation died on Undine 's lips . She found herself grappling with a new social riddle , and such surprises were always stimulating . The name of the untidy - looking young woman she had been about to repel was one of the most eminent in the impregnable quarter beyond the Seine . No one figured more largely in the Parisian chronicle than the Princess Estradina , and no name more impressively headed the list at every marriage , funeral and philanthropic entertainment of the Faubourg Saint Germain than that of her mother , the Duchesse de Dordogne , who must be no other than the old woman sitting in the Bath - chair with the crumpled bonnet and the ridiculous sunshade . But it was not the appearance of the two ladies that surprised Undine . She knew that social gold does not always glitter , and that the lady she had heard spoken of as Lili Estradina was notoriously careless of the conventions ; but that she should boast of her intimacy with Madame Adelschein , and use it as a pretext for naming herself , overthrew all Undine 's hierarchies . "
109036	109091	109098	109098	he	382	" the Princess rambled on , with her half - mocking half - intimate smile ; and in another moment Undine , thrilled at having Mrs. Spragg thus coupled with a Duchess , found herself seated between mother and daughter , and responding by a radiant blush to the elder lady 's amiable opening : "
109104	109343	109415	109415	My	0	" How had it happened , whither would it lead , how long could it last ? The questions raced through Undine 's brain as she sat listening to her new friends -- they seemed already too friendly to be called acquaintances!--replying to their enquiries , and trying to think far enough ahead to guess what they would expect her to say , and what tone it would be well to take . She was used to such feats of mental agility , and it was instinctive with her to become , for the moment , the person she thought her interlocutors expected her to be ; but she had never had quite so new a part to play at such short notice . She took her cue , however , from the fact that the Princess Estradina , in her mother 's presence , made no farther allusion to her dear friend Sacha , and seemed somehow , though she continued to chat on in the same easy strain , to look differently and throw out different implications . All these shades of demeanour were immediately perceptible to Undine , who tried to adapt herself to them by combining in her manner a mixture of Apex dash and New York dignity ; and the result was so successful that when she rose to go the Princess , with a hand on her arm , said almost wistfully : "
109375	109414	109426	109426	I	0	" A new life began for Undine . The Princess , chained her mother 's side , and frankly restive under her filial duty , clung to her new acquaintance with a persistence too flattering to be analyzed . "
109436	109740	109749	109749	you	2664	" she explained ; and Undine felt like answering that she had nearly reached the same pass when the Princess 's thin little hand had been held out to her . For the moment she was dizzy with the effect of that random gesture . Here she was , at the lowest ebb of her fortunes , miraculously rehabilitated , reinstated , and restored to the old victorious sense of her youth and her power ! Her sole graces , her unaided personality , had worked the miracle ; how should she not trust in them hereafter ? Aside from her feeling of concrete attainment . Undine was deeply interested in her new friends . The Princess and her mother , in their different ways , were different from any one else she had known . The Princess , who might have been of any age between twenty and forty , had a small triangular face with caressing impudent eyes , a smile like a silent whistle and the gait of a baker 's boy balancing his basket . She wore either baggy shabby clothes like a man 's , or rich draperies that looked as if they had been rained on ; and she seemed equally at ease in either style of dress , and carelessly unconscious of both . She was extremely familiar and unblushingly inquisitive , but she never gave Undine the time to ask her any questions or the opportunity to venture on any freedom with her . Nevertheless she did not scruple to talk of her sentimental experiences , and seemed surprised , and rather disappointed , that Undine had so few to relate in return . She playfully accused her beautiful new friend of being cachottiere , and at the sight of Undine 's blush cried out : "
109760	110035	110160	110160	one	629	" The old Duchess was even more impressive , because she fitted better into Undine 's preconceived picture of the Faubourg Saint Germain , and was more like the people with whom she pictured the former Nettie Wincher as living in privileged intimacy . The Duchess was , indeed , more amiable and accessible than Undine 's conception of a Duchess , and displayed a curiosity as great as her daughter 's , and much more puerile , concerning her new friend 's history and habits . But through her mild prattle , and in spite of her limited perceptions . Undine felt in her the same clear impenetrable barrier that she ran against occasionally in the Princess ; and she was beginning to understand that this barrier represented a number of things about which she herself had yet to learn . She would not have known this a few years earlier , nor would she have seen in the Duchess anything but the ruin of an ugly woman , dressed in clothes that Mrs. Spragg would n't have touched . The Duchess certainly looked like a ruin ; but Undine now saw that she looked like the ruin of a castle . The Princess , who was unofficially separated from her husband , had with her her two little girls . She seemed extremely attached to both -- though avowing for the younger a preference she frankly ascribed to the interesting accident of its parentage -- and she could not understand that Undine , as to whose domestic difficulties she minutely informed herself , should have consented to leave her child to strangers . "
110056	110086	110160	110160	one	629	" she began , breaking off with a stare when Undine interrupted her to explain that the courts had ascribed all the wrongs in the case to her husband . "
110092	110158	110169	110169	one	629	" murmured the Princess , turning away from the subject as if checked by too deep an abyss of difference . The incident had embarrassed Undine , and though she tried to justify herself by allusions to her boy 's dependence on his father 's family , and to the duty of not standing in his way , she saw that she made no impression . "
110171	110283	110169	110169	one	629	" her hearer continued to repeat ; and Undine , who was frequently scandalized by the Princess 's conversation , now found herself in the odd position of having to set a watch upon her own in order not to scandalize the Princess . Each day , nevertheless , strengthened her hold on her new friends . After her first flush of triumph she began indeed to suspect that she had been a slight disappointment to the Princess , had not completely justified the hopes raised by the doubtful honour of being one of Sacha Adelschein 's intimates . Undine guessed that the Princess had expected to find her more amusing , "
110286	110462	110469	110470	Her husband	488	" more startling in speech and conduct . Though by instinct she was none of these things , she was eager to go as far as was expected ; but she felt that her audacities were on lines too normal to be interesting , and that the Princess thought her rather school - girlish and old - fashioned . Still , they had in common their youth , their boredom , their high spirits and their hunger for amusement ; and Undine was making the most of these ties when one day , coming back from a trip to Monte - Carlo with the Princess , she was brought up short by the sight of a lady -- evidently a new arrival -- who was seated in an attitude of respectful intimacy beside the old Duchess 's chair . Undine , advancing unheard over the fine gravel of the garden path , recognized at a glance the Marquise de Trezac 's drooping nose and disdainful back , and at the same moment heard her say : "
110467	110468	110478	110478	she	2673	" "
110482	110518	110529	110534	that old bore of a Trezac	2678	" the Duchess replied , as if she were merely stating the same fact in two different ways ; and Undine stopped short with a pang of apprehension . The Princess came up behind her . "
110536	110548	110600	110600	You	2680	" She dropped her long eye - glass with a laugh . "
110581	110599	110636	110636	I	0	" She approached Madame de Trezac effusively , and after an interchange of exclamations Undine heard her say "
110634	110635	110868	110870	The old hypocrite	2686	" "
110654	110867	110868	110870	The old hypocrite	2686	" the Marquise de Trezac murmured , rising to give her hand to Undine , and speaking in a voice so different from that of the supercilious Miss Wincher that only her facial angle and the droop of her nose linked her to the hated vision of Potash Springs . Undine felt herself dancing on a flood - tide of security . For the first time the memory of Potash Springs became a thing to smile at , and with the Princess 's arm through hers she shone back triumphantly on Madame de Trezac , who seemed to have grown suddenly obsequious and insignificant , as though the waving of the Princess 's wand had stripped her of all her false advantages . But upstairs , in her own room . Undine 's courage fell . Madame de Trezac had been civil , effusive even , because for the moment she had been taken off her guard by finding Mrs. Marvell on terms of intimacy with the Princess Estradina and her mother . But the force of facts would reassert itself . Far from continuing to see Undine through her French friends ' eyes she would probably invite them to view her compatriot through the searching lens of her own ampler information . "
110877	110968	110971	110971	you	2688	" Undine murmured , wincing at the recollection of the dentist 's assistant from Deposit , and staring miserably at her reflection in the dressing - table mirror . Of what use were youth and grace and good looks , if one drop of poison distilled from the envy of a narrow - minded woman was enough to paralyze them ? Of course Madame de Trezac knew and remembered , and , secure in her own impregnable position , would never rest till she had driven out the intruder . XXVIII "
110981	111118	110971	110971	you	2688	" the Princess suggested a few evenings later as she followed Undine upstairs after a languid evening at bridge with the Duchess and Madame de Trezac . Half - way down the passage she stopped to open a door and , putting her finger to her lip , signed to Undine to enter . In the taper - lit dimness stood two small white beds , each surmounted by a crucifix and a palm branch , and each containing a small brown sleeping child with a mop of hair and a curiously finished little face . As the Princess stood gazing on their innocent slumbers she seemed for a moment like a third little girl scarcely bigger and browner than the others ; and the smile with which she watched them was as clear as theirs . "
111129	111137	110971	110971	you	2688	" she sighed as she turned away . "
111143	111160	111780	111780	she	2698	" she repeated , as she and Undine walked on to their rooms with linked arms . "
111227	111437	111780	111780	she	2698	" Undine was sure the trip to Nice would be delightful . Their previous expeditions had shown her the Princess 's faculty for organizing such adventures . At Monte - Carlo , a few days before , they had run across two or three amusing but unassorted people , and the Princess , having fused them in a jolly lunch , had followed it up by a bout at baccarat , and , finally hunting down an eminent composer who had just arrived to rehearse a new production , had insisted on his asking the party to tea , and treating them to fragments of his opera . A few days earlier , Undine 's hope of renewing such pleasures would have been clouded by the dread of leaving Madame de Trezac alone with the Duchess . But she had no longer any fear of Madame de Trezac . She had discovered that her old rival of Potash Springs was in actual dread of her disfavour , and nervously anxious to conciliate her , and the discovery gave her such a sense of the heights she had scaled , and the security of her footing , that all her troubled past began to seem like the result of some providential "
111440	111519	111552	111552	I	0	" and vague impulses of piety stirred in her as she and the Princess whirled toward Nice through the blue and gold glitter of the morning . They wandered about the lively streets , they gazed into the beguiling shops , the Princess tried on hats and Undine bought them , and they lunched at the Royal on all sorts of succulent dishes prepared under the head - waiter 's special supervision . But as they were savouring their "
111521	111549	111559	111559	you	2697	" coffee and liqueurs , and Undine was wondering what her companion would devise for the afternoon , the Princess clapped her hands together and cried out : "
111561	111776	111825	111825	she	2698	" She explained that she 'd promised the Duchess to look up a friend who was ill -- a poor wretch who 'd been sent to Cimiez for her lungs -- and that she must rush off at once , and would be back as soon as possible -- well , if not in an hour , then in two at latest . She was full of compunction , but she knew Undine would forgive her , and find something amusing to fill up the time : she advised her to go back and buy the black hat with the osprey , and try on the crepe de Chine they 'd thought so smart : for any one as good - looking as herself the woman would probably alter it for nothing ; and they could meet again at the Palace Tea - Rooms at four . She whirled away in a cloud of explanations , and Undine , left alone , sat down on the Promenade des Anglais . She did not believe a word the Princess had said . She had seen in a flash why she was being left , and why the plan had not been divulged to her before - hand ; and she quivered with resentment and humiliation . "
111828	111859	111866	111866	I	0	" A sincere disgust was Undine 's uppermost sensation . She was as much ashamed as Mrs. Spragg might have been at finding herself used to screen a clandestine adventure . "
111872	112438	112448	112448	you	2700	" she repeated angrily ; and for a moment she was half - disposed to drive to the station and take the first train back . But the sense of her precarious situation withheld her ; and presently , with bitterness in her heart , she got up and began to stroll toward the shops . To show that she was not a dupe , she arrived at the designated meeting - place nearly an hour later than the time appointed ; but when she entered the Tea - Rooms the Princess was nowhere to be seen . The rooms were crowded , and Undine was guided toward a small inner apartment where isolated couples were absorbing refreshments in an atmosphere of intimacy that made it seem incongruous to be alone . She glanced about for a face she knew , but none was visible , and she was just giving up the search when she beheld Elmer Moffatt shouldering his way through the crowd . The sight was so surprising that she sat gazing with unconscious fixity at the round black head and glossy reddish face which kept appearing and disappearing through the intervening jungle of aigrettes . It was long since she had either heard of Moffatt or thought about him , and now , in her loneliness and exasperation , she took comfort in the sight of his confident capable face , and felt a longing to hear his voice and unbosom her woes to him . She had half risen to attract his attention when she saw him turn back and make way for a companion , who was cautiously steering her huge feathered hat between the tea - tables . The woman was of the vulgarest type ; everything about her was cheap and gaudy . But Moffatt was obviously elated : he stood aside with a flourish to usher her in , and as he followed he shot out a pink shirt - cuff with jewelled links , and gave his moustache a gallant twist . Undine felt an unreasoning irritation : she was vexed with him both for not being alone and for being so vulgarly accompanied . As the couple seated themselves she caught Moffatt 's glance and saw him redden to the edge of his white forehead ; but he elaborately avoided her eye -- he evidently wanted her to see him do it -- and proceeded to minister to his companion 's wants with an air of experienced gallantry . The incident , trifling as it was , filled up the measure of Undine 's bitterness . She thought Moffatt pitiably ridiculous , and she hated him for showing himself in such a light at that particular moment . Her mind turned back to her own grievance , and she was just saying to herself that nothing on earth should prevent her letting the Princess know what she thought of her , when the lady in question at last appeared . She came hurriedly forward and behind her Undine perceived the figure of a slight quietly dressed man , as to whom her immediate impression was that he made every one else in the room look as common as Moffatt . An instant later the colour had flown to her face and her hand was in Raymond de Chelles , while the Princess , murmuring : "
112453	112464	112448	112448	you	2700	" looked into her eyes with a smile that added : "
112474	112557	112570	112570	you	2700	" Her first glance showed Undine how glad Raymond de Chelles was to see her . Since their last meeting his admiration for her seemed not only to have increased but to have acquired a different character . Undine , at an earlier stage in her career , might not have known exactly what the difference signified ; but it was as clear to her now as if the Princess had said -- what her beaming eyes seemed , in fact , to convey--"I'm
112575	112761	112570	112570	you	2700	" But Undine 's increased experience , if it had made her more vigilant , had also given her a clearer measure of her power . She saw at once that Chelles , in seeking to meet her again , was not in quest of a mere passing adventure . He was evidently deeply drawn to her , and her present situation , if it made it natural to regard her as more accessible , had not altered the nature of his feeling . She saw and weighed all this in the first five minutes during which , over tea and muffins , the Princess descanted on her luck in happening to run across her cousin , and Chelles , his enchanted eyes on Undine , expressed his sense of his good fortune . He was staying , it appeared , with friends at Beaulieu , and had run over to Nice that afternoon by the merest chance : he added that , having just learned of his aunt 's presence in the neighbourhood , he had already planned to present his homage to her . "
112774	112779	112868	112868	he	2703	" the Princess exclaimed . "
112801	112866	112872	112872	they	2704	" she added , smiling at Undine . The latter smiled back vaguely , and looked across the room . Moffatt , looking flushed and foolish , was just pushing back his chair . To carry off his embarrassment he put an additional touch of importance ; and as he swaggered out behind his companion , Undine said to herself , with a shiver : "
112882	113056	113063	113063	I	0	" Undine , during the ensuing weeks , returned several times to Nice with the Princess ; but , to the latter 's surprise , she absolutely refused to have Raymond de Chelles included in their luncheon - parties , or even apprised in advance of their expeditions . The Princess , always impatient of unnecessary dissimulation , had not attempted to keep up the feint of the interesting invalid at Cimiez . She confessed to Undine that she was drawn to Nice by the presence there of the person without whom , for the moment , she found life intolerable , and whom she could not well receive under the same roof with her little girls and her mother . She appealed to Undine 's sisterly heart to feel for her in her difficulty , and implied that -- as her conduct had already proved -- she would always be ready to render her friend a like service . It was at this point that Undine checked her by a decided word . "
113073	113082	113088	113088	Your	2705	" she began ( the Princess stared at the "
113084	113087	113121	113122	your cousin	3969	" ) . "
113127	113138	113153	113153	He	3969	" The Princess 's face expressed the most genuine astonishment . "

113176	113204	113211	113211	you	2705	" Undine went on , ignoring the interruption and looking straight at her under level brows ; and the Princess , with a shrug , merely murmured : "
113215	113342	113392	113392	I	0	" XXIX The early spring found Undine once more in Paris . She had every reason to be satisfied with the result of the course she had pursued since she had pronounced her ultimatum on the subject of Raymond de Chelles . She had continued to remain on the best of terms with the Princess , to rise in the estimation of the old Duchess , and to measure the rapidity of her ascent in the upward gaze of Madame de Trezac ; and she had given Chelles to understand that , if he wished to renew their acquaintance , he must do so in the shelter of his venerable aunt 's protection . To the Princess she was careful to make her attitude equally clear . "
113400	113678	113392	113392	I	0	" Nevertheless , whenever Chelles came over from Beaulieu to spend a day with his aunt and cousin -- an excursion he not infrequently repeated -- Undine was at no pains to conceal her pleasure . Nor was there anything calculated in her attitude . Chelles seemed to her more charming than ever , and the warmth of his wooing was in flattering contrast to the cool reserve of his manners . At last she felt herself alive and young again , and it became a joy to look in her glass and to try on her new hats and dresses ... The only menace ahead was the usual one of the want of money . While she had travelled with her parents she had been at relatively small expense , and since their return to America Mr. Spragg had sent her allowance regularly ; yet almost all the money she had received for the pearls was already gone , and she knew her Paris season would be far more expensive than the quiet weeks on the Riviera . Meanwhile the sense of reviving popularity , and the charm of Chelles ' devotion , had almost effaced the ugly memories of failure , and refurbished that image of herself in other minds which was her only notion of self - seeing . Under the guidance of Madame de Trezac she had found a prettily furnished apartment in a not too inaccessible quarter , and in its light bright drawing - room she sat one June afternoon listening , with all the forbearance of which she was capable , to the counsels of her newly - acquired guide . "
113682	113836	113392	113392	I	0	" Madame de Trezac was repeating , her long head slightly tilted , her features wearing the rapt look of an adept reciting a hallowed formula . Raymond de Chelles had not been mentioned by either of the ladies , and the former Miss Wincher was merely imparting to her young friend one of the fundamental dogmas of her social creed ; but Undine was conscious that the air between them vibrated with an unspoken name . She made no immediate answer , but her glance , passing by Madame de Trezac 's dull countenance , sought her own reflection in the mirror behind her visitor 's chair . A beam of spring sunlight touched the living masses of her hair and made the face beneath as radiant as a girl 's . Undine smiled faintly at the promise her own eyes gave her , and then turned them back to her friend . "
113845	113850	113392	113392	I	0	" she thought compassionately . "
113857	113882	114020	114020	they	2722	" Madame de Trezac continued in a tone of patient exposition . She seemed to be doing her best to make the matter clear . "

114078	114099	114113	114113	ourselves	2723	" Madame de Trezac decisively rejoined . She returned Undine 's look with something of Miss Wincher 's contemptuous authority . "
114102	114111	114172	114172	We	2723	" she added , softening to a smile , "
114158	114171	114172	114172	We	2723	" Undine turned to her with the frown of a startled Diana . "
114184	114201	114235	114235	I	0	" she said coldly ; and the blood rose in Madame de Trezac 's sallow cheek . "
114233	114234	114827	114827	Granny	370	" "
114243	114826	114827	114827	Granny	370	" said Undine . She had been in Paris for about two months when this conversation took place , and in spite of her reviving self - confidence she was beginning to recognize the strength of the forces opposed to her . It had taken a long time to convince her that even money could not prevail against them ; and , in the intervals of expressing her admiration for the Catholic creed , she now had violent reactions of militant Protestantism , during which she talked of the tyranny of Rome and recalled school stories of immoral Popes and persecuting Jesuits . Meanwhile her demeanour to Chelles was that of the incorruptible but fearless American woman , who can not even conceive of love outside of marriage , but is ready to give her devoted friendship to the man on whom , in happier circumstances , she might have bestowed her hand . This attitude was provocative of many scenes , during which her suitor 's unfailing powers of expression -- his gift of looking and saying all the desperate and devoted things a pretty woman likes to think she inspires -- gave Undine the thrilling sense of breathing the very air of French fiction . But she was aware that too prolonged tension of these cords usually ends in their snapping , and that Chelles ' patience was probably in inverse ratio to his ardour . When Madame de Trezac had left her these thoughts remained in her mind . She understood exactly what each of her new friends wanted of her . The Princess , who was fond of her cousin , and had the French sense of family solidarity , would have liked to see Chelles happy in what seemed to her the only imaginable way . Madame de Trezac would have liked to do what she could to second the Princess 's efforts in this or any other line ; and even the old Duchess -- though piously desirous of seeing her favourite nephew married -- would have thought it not only natural but inevitable that , while awaiting that happy event , he should try to induce an amiable young woman to mitigate the drawbacks of celibacy . Meanwhile , they might one and all weary of her if Chelles did ; and a persistent rejection of his suit would probably imperil her scarcely - gained footing among his friends . All this was clear to her , yet it did not shake her resolve . She was determined to give up Chelles unless he was willing to marry her ; and the thought of her renunciation moved her to a kind of wistful melancholy . In this mood her mind reverted to a letter she had just received from her mother . Mrs. Spragg wrote more fully than usual , and the unwonted flow of her pen had been occasioned by an event for which she had long yearned . For months she had pined for a sight of her grandson , had tried to screw up her courage to write and ask permission to visit him , and , finally breaking through her sedentary habits , had begun to haunt the neighbourhood of Washington Square , with the result that one afternoon she had had the luck to meet the little boy coming out of the house with his nurse . She had spoken to him , and he had remembered her and called her "
114828	115020	114827	114827	Granny	370	" ; and the next day she had received a note from Mrs. Fairford saying that Ralph would be glad to send Paul to see her . Mrs. Spragg enlarged on the delights of the visit and the growing beauty and cleverness of her grandson . She described to Undine exactly how Paul was dressed , how he looked and what he said , and told her how he had examined everything in the room , and , finally coming upon his mother 's photograph , had asked who the lady was ; and , on being told , had wanted to know if she was a very long way off , and when Granny thought she would come back . As Undine re - read her mother 's pages , she felt an unusual tightness in her throat and two tears rose to her eyes . It was dreadful that her little boy should be growing up far away from her , perhaps dressed in clothes she would have hated ; and wicked and unnatural that when he saw her picture he should have to be told who she was . "
115042	115133	114827	114827	Granny	370	" she thought -- and the tears overflowed and ran down . Even as they fell , the door was thrown open to admit Raymond de Chelles , and the consciousness of the moisture still glistening on her cheeks perhaps strengthened her resolve to resist him , and thus made her more imperiously to be desired . Certain it is that on that day her suitor first alluded to a possibility which Madame de Trezac had prudently refrained from suggesting , there fell upon Undine 's attentive ears the magic phrase "
115138	115377	115562	115562	You	2730	" Her alert intelligence immediately set to work in this new direction ; but almost at the same moment she became aware of a subtle change of tone in the Princess and her mother , a change reflected in the corresponding decline of Madame de Trezac 's cordiality . Undine , since her arrival in Paris , had necessarily been less in the Princess 's company , but when they met she had found her as friendly as ever . It was manifestly not a failing of the Princess 's to forget past favours , and though increasingly absorbed by the demands of town life she treated her new friend with the same affectionate frankness , and Undine was given frequent opportunities to enlarge her Parisian acquaintance , not only in the Princess 's intimate circle but in the majestic drawing - rooms of the Hotel de Dordogne . Now , however , there was a perceptible decline in these signs of hospitality , and Undine , on calling one day on the Duchess , noticed that her appearance sent a visible flutter of discomfort through the circle about her hostess 's chair . Two or three of the ladies present looked away from the new - comer and at each other , and several of them seemed spontaneously to encircle without approaching her , while another -- grey - haired , elderly and slightly frightened -- with an "
115383	115561	115608	115608	she	4948	" to the Duchess , was hastily aided in her retreat down the long line of old gilded rooms . The incident was too mute and rapid to have been noticeable had it not been followed by the Duchess 's resuming her conversation with the ladies nearest her as though Undine had just gone out of the room instead of entering it . The sense of having been thus rendered invisible filled Undine with a vehement desire to make herself seen , and an equally strong sense that all attempts to do so would be vain ; and when , a few minutes later , she issued from the portals of the Hotel de Dordogne it was with the fixed resolve not to enter them again till she had had an explanation with the Princess . She was spared the trouble of seeking one by the arrival , early the next morning , of Madame de Trezac , who , entering almost with the breakfast tray , mysteriously asked to be allowed to communicate something of importance . "
115575	115603	115608	115608	she	4948	" Madame de Trezac began , sitting up very straight on the edge of the arm - chair over which Undine 's lace dressing - gown hung . "

She knew the tone she had taken was virtually a declaration of war ; but she was in a mood when the act of defiance , apart from its strategic value , was a satisfaction in itself . Moreover , if she could not gain her end without a fight it was better that the battle should be engaged while Raymond 's ardour was at its height . To provoke immediate hostilities she sent for him the same afternoon , and related , quietly and without comment , the incident of her visit to the Duchess , and the mission with which Madame de Trezac had been charged . In the circumstances , she went on to explain , it was manifestly impossible that she should continue to receive his visits ; and she met his wrathful comments on his relatives by the gently but firmly expressed resolve not to be the cause of any disagreement between himself and his family . XXX A few days after her decisive conversation with Raymond de Chelles , Undine , emerging from the doors of the Nouveau Luxe , where she had been to call on the newly - arrived Mrs. Homer Branney , once more found herself face to face with Elmer Moffatt . This time there was no mistaking his eagerness to be recognized . He stopped short as they met , and she read such pleasure in his eyes that she too stopped , holding out her hand . "
116461	116472	116487	116487	You	2750	" she said , and Moffatt reddened at the allusion . "
116504	116523	116487	116487	You	2750	" He turned back and began to walk at her side in the direction of the Champs Elysees . "
116531	116565	116567	116567	you	2750	" he exclaimed ; and she saw that his glance had left her and was ranging across the wide silvery square ahead of them to the congregated domes and spires beyond the river . "
116571	116583	116567	116567	you	2750	" she asked , wondering what theatres he had been to . "
116588	116618	116621	116621	you	0	" He seemed to be breathing in deeply the impression of fountains , sculpture , leafy ' avenues and long - drawn architectural distances fading into the afternoon haze . "
116631	116649	116662	116662	you	2750	" he went on , his gold - topped stick pointing toward the towers of Notre Dame . "

116692	116734	116681	116681	I	0	" she echoed inattentively . It never occurred to her that other people 's lives went on when they were out of her range of vision , and she tried in vain to remember what she had last heard of Moffatt . "
116746	116747	116787	116787	I	0	" "
116766	116786	116789	116789	you	0	" Nothing in his robust mien confirmed the statement , and he did not seem inclined to develop it . "
116795	116800	116801	116801	I	0	" he went on . "
116806	116807	116801	116801	I	0	" "
116810	116820	116837	116837	he	2753	" she interrupted ; adding , after a moment : "
116830	116831	116834	116834	I	0	" "
116842	116894	116834	116834	I	0	" said Moffatt . His eyes had come back to her , and the look in them struck her as something she might use to her advantage ; but the next moment he had glanced away with a furrowed brow , and she felt she had not wholly fixed his attention . "
116914	116991	117063	117063	I	0	" she suggested , half moved by a desire to know more of his affairs , and half by the thought that a talk with him might help to shed some light on hers . In the open taxi - cab he seemed to recover his sense of well - being , and leaned back , his hands on the knob of his stick , with the air of a man pleasantly aware of his privileges . "
117000	117062	117063	117063	I	0	" he repeated once or twice as they rolled on through the crush and glitter of the afternoon ; and when they had descended at Undine 's door , and he stood in her drawing - room , and looked out on the horse - chestnut trees rounding their green domes under the balcony , his satisfaction culminated in the comment : "
117072	117091	117098	117098	I	0	" His eyes met Undine 's with their old twinkle , and their expression encouraged her to murmur : "
117103	117137	117140	117140	I	0	" She sat down behind the tea - table , and he stood at a little distance , watching her pull off her gloves with a queer comic twitch of his elastic mouth . "
117151	117285	117290	117290	YOU'VE	2757	" he said , grasping a lyre - backed chair by its gilt cords , and sitting down astride of it , his light grey trousers stretching too tightly over his plump thighs . Undine was perfectly aware that he was a vulgar over - dressed man , with a red crease of fat above his collar and an impudent swaggering eye ; yet she liked to see him there , and was conscious that he stirred the fibres of a self she had forgotten but had not ceased to understand . She had fancied her avowal of loneliness might call forth some sentimental phrase ; but though Moffatt was clearly pleased to be with her she saw that she was not the centre of his thoughts , and the discovery irritated her . "
117305	117317	117290	117290	YOU'VE	2757	" she continued as she held out his tea - cup . "
117320	117325	117333	117334	a guide	2758	" he said jocosely , "
117335	117345	117348	117348	I	0	" ; and she rejoined on the same note : "
117355	117356	117384	117384	you	2757	" "
117379	117380	117386	117386	I	0	" "
117390	117399	117418	117418	you	2757	" There was nothing feigned in her regret . "
117410	117414	117418	117418	you	2757	" She hesitated . "
117426	117456	117458	117458	you	2757	" He looked at her more attentively , as if his practised eve had passed through the surface of her beauty to what might be going on behind it . "
117464	117480	117483	117483	I	0	" he asked with sudden irony . Undine opened her eyes with a trustful look . "
117486	117487	117490	117490	I'll	0	" "
117494	117499	117500	117500	You	2757	" said Moffatt gaily . "
117508	117587	117590	117598	the fellow who was over at Nice with you	2760	" she began ; and he leaned back , grasping both sides of the chair - back , and shaking it a little with his laugh . He kept the same attitude while she proceeded to unfold her case , listening to her with the air of sober concentration that his frivolous face took on at any serious demand on his attention . When she had ended he kept the same look during an interval of silent pondering . "
117602	117610	117613	117613	you	2757	" She looked at him with surprise . "
117616	117617	117620	117620	I	0	" "
117625	117699	117620	117620	I	0	" said Moffatt simply . He got up and strolled toward the window . On the way he stopped before a table covered with showy trifles , and after looking at them for a moment singled out a dim old brown and golden book which Chelles had given her . He examined it lingeringly , as though it touched the spring of some choked - up sensibility for which he had no language . "
117701	117724	117726	117726	you	0	" he began : it was the usual prelude to his enthusiasms ; but he laid the book down and turned back . "
117744	117780	117726	117726	you	0	" Her heart began to beat . She remembered that he had once put a job in Ralph 's way , and had let her understand that he had done it partly for her sake . "
117783	117791	117811	117811	I	0	" he continued , relapsing into hyperbole , "
117817	117828	117833	117833	I	0	" He looked at her with a sudden odd intensity . "
117837	117847	117833	117833	I	0	" The phrase was lost in his familiar whistle . "
117859	117885	117943	117943	your	0	" he said . It was a disappointment to Undine to hear that his affairs were not prospering , for she knew that in his world "
117887	117938	117943	117943	your	0	" and solvency were closely related , and that such support as she had hoped he might give her would be contingent on his own situation . But she had again a fleeting sense of his mysterious power of accomplishing things in the teeth of adversity ; and she answered : "
117946	117997	118001	118002	a fellow	2763	" He turned away and wandered across the room , his hands in his pockets . On her ornate writing desk he saw a photograph of Paul , bright - curled and sturdy - legged , in a manly reefer , and bent over it with a murmur of approval . "
118009	118013	118034	118034	I	0	" Undine coloured . "
118015	118033	118034	118034	I	0	" she began ; and seeing his look of surprise , she embarked on her usual explanation . "
118044	118066	118070	118070	you	0	" she ended , with a ring of truth that carried conviction to her own ears if not to Moffatt 's . "

118082	118098	118106	118106	I	0	" Moffatt had picked up the frame and was looking at the photograph more closely . "
118101	118105	118106	118106	I	0	" he chuckled . "
118109	118116	118119	118119	he	2763	" He turned back to Undine . "
118125	118126	118119	118119	he	2763	" "

118327	118332	118350	118350	You	0	" Undine looked up . "

118412	118429	118441	118441	His	2763	" She coloured , a denial on her lips ; but she could not shape it . "
118448	118449	118441	118441	His	2763	" "
118453	118464	118565	118565	You	0	" Moffatt 's face had grown as sharp as glass . "
118488	118564	118580	118580	I	0	" He dropped back to his equestrian seat on the lyre - backed chair . Undine stood up and moved uneasily toward the window . She seemed to see her little boy as though he were in the room with her ; she did not understand how she could have lived so long without him ... She stood for a long time without speaking , feeling behind her the concentrated irony of Moffatt 's gaze . "
118583	118594	118652	118652	my	0	" she finally turned back to ask . He laughed . "
118655	118656	118673	118673	I	0	" "
118668	118672	118716	118716	I	0	" He grinned . "
118720	118791	118794	118794	you	0	" Leaden disappointment descended on Undine . She had felt almost sure of Moffatt 's helping her , and for an instant she wondered if some long - smouldering jealousy had flamed up under its cold cinders . But another look at his face denied her this solace ; and his evident indifference was the last blow to her pride . The twinge it gave her prompted her to ask : "
118801	118809	118828	118828	I	0	" Moffatt gave her a quick look . "
118837	118877	118902	118902	I	0	" He spoke coolly and half - humorously , and before he had ended she had lost all interest in his reply . He seemed aware of the fact , for he stood up and held out his hand . "
118906	118915	118916	118916	You	192	" She laid her hand sadly in his . "
118923	119321	119322	119322	Hallo	252	" she replied . XXXI Nearly two years had passed since Ralph Marvell , waking from his long sleep in the hot summer light of Washington Square , had found that the face of life was changed for him . In the interval he had gradually adapted himself to the new order of things ; but the months of adaptation had been a time of such darkness and confusion that , from the vantage - ground of his recovered lucidity , he could not yet distinguish the stages by which he had worked his way out ; and even now his footing was not secure . His first effort had been to readjust his values -- to take an inventory of them , and reclassify them , so that one at least might be made to appear as important as those he had lost ; otherwise there could be no reason why he should go on living . He applied himself doggedly to this attempt ; but whenever he thought he had found a reason that his mind could rest in , it gave way under him , and the old struggle for a foothold began again . His two objects in life were his boy and his book . The boy was incomparably the stronger argument , yet the less serviceable in filling the void . Ralph felt his son all the while , and all through his other feelings ; but he could not think about him actively and continuously , could not forever exercise his eager empty dissatisfied mind on the relatively simple problem of clothing , educating and amusing a little boy of six . Yet Paul 's existence was the all - sufficient reason for his own ; and he turned again , with a kind of cold fervour , to his abandoned literary dream . Material needs obliged him to go on with his regular business ; but , the day 's work over , he was possessed of a leisure as bare and as blank as an unfurnished house , yet that was at least his own to furnish as he pleased . Meanwhile he was beginning to show a presentable face to the world , and to be once more treated like a man in whose case no one is particularly interested . His men friends ceased to say : "
119334	119532	119576	119576	You	2775	" and elderly ladies no longer told him they were sure he kept too much to himself , and urged him to drop in any afternoon for a quiet talk . People left him to his sorrow as a man is left to an incurable habit , an unfortunate tie : they ignored it , or looked over its head if they happened to catch a glimpse of it at his elbow . These glimpses were given to them more and more rarely . The smothered springs of life were bubbling up in Ralph , and there were days when he was glad to wake and see the sun in his window , and when he began to plan his book , and to fancy that the planning really interested him . He could even maintain the delusion for several days -- for intervals each time appreciably longer -- before it shrivelled up again in a scorching blast of disenchantment . The worst of it was that he could never tell when these hot gusts of anguish would overtake him . They came sometimes just when he felt most secure , when he was saying to himself : "
119541	119575	119576	119576	You	2775	" sometimes even when he was sitting with Clare Van Degen , listening to her voice , watching her hands , and turning over in his mind the opening chapters of his book . "
119580	119728	119737	119737	I	0	" ; they had one and all said it to him from the first ; and he fancied he might have begun sooner if he had not been urged on by their watchful fondness . Everybody wanted him to write -- everybody had decided that he ought to , that he would , that he must be persuaded to ; and the incessant imperceptible pressure of encouragement -- the assumption of those about him that because it would be good for him to write he must naturally be able to -- acted on his restive nerves as a stronger deterrent than disapproval . Even Clare had fallen into the same mistake ; and one day , as he sat talking with her on the verandah of Laura Fairford 's house on the Sound -- where they now most frequently met -- Ralph had half - impatiently rejoined : "
119740	119953	119960	119960	I	0	" Instantly he had seen her face change , and the speaking hands tremble on her knee . But she achieved the feat of not answering him , or turning her steady eyes from the dancing mid - summer water at the foot of Laura 's lawn . Ralph leaned a little nearer , and for an instant his hand imagined the flutter of hers . But instead of clasping it he drew back , and rising from his chair wandered away to the other end of the verandah ... No , he did n't feel as Clare felt . If he loved her -- as he sometimes thought he did -- it was not in the same way . He had a great tenderness for her , he was more nearly happy with her than with any one else ; he liked to sit and talk with her , and watch her face and her hands , and he wished there were some way -- some different way -- of letting her know it ; but he could not conceive that tenderness and desire could ever again be one for him : such a notion as that seemed part of the monstrous sentimental muddle on which his life had gone aground . "
119966	119976	120691	120691	you	2777	" he said , turning back to his seat . "
120001	120688	120712	120712	Charles	314	" He hardly knew what he was saying ; but before the end of the sentence he saw that Clare had understood what he meant to convey , and henceforth he felt committed to letting her talk to him as much as she pleased about his book . He himself , in consequence , took to thinking about it more consecutively ; and just as his friends ceased to urge him to write , he sat down in earnest to begin . The vision that had come to him had no likeness to any of his earlier imaginings . Two or three subjects had haunted him , pleading for expression , during the first years of his marriage ; but these now seemed either too lyrical or too tragic . He no longer saw life on the heroic scale : he wanted to do something in which men should look no bigger than the insects they were . He contrived in the course of time to reduce one of his old subjects to these dimensions , and after nights of brooding he made a dash at it , and wrote an opening chapter that struck him as not too bad . In the exhilaration of this first attempt he spent some pleasant evenings revising and polishing his work ; and gradually a feeling of authority and importance developed in him . In the morning , when he woke , instead of his habitual sense of lassitude , he felt an eagerness to be up and doing , and a conviction that his individual task was a necessary part of the world 's machinery . He kept his secret with the beginner 's deadly fear of losing his hold on his half - real creations if he let in any outer light on them ; but he went about with a more assured step , shrank less from meeting his friends , and even began to dine out again , and to laugh at some of the jokes he heard . Laura Fairford , to get Paul away from town , had gone early to the country ; and Ralph , who went down to her every Saturday , usually found Clare Van Degen there . Since his divorce he had never entered his cousin 's pinnacled palace ; and Clare had never asked him why he stayed away . This mutual silence had been their sole allusion to Van Degen 's share in the catastrophe , though Ralph had spoken frankly of its other aspects . They talked , however , most often of impersonal subjects -- books , pictures , plays , or whatever the world that interested them was doing -- and she showed no desire to draw him back to his own affairs . She was again staying late in town -- to have a pretext , as he guessed , for coming down on Sundays to the Fairfords'--and they often made the trip together in her motor ; but he had not yet spoken to her of having begun his book . One May evening , however , as they sat alone in the verandah , he suddenly told her that he was writing . As he spoke his heart beat like a boy 's ; but once the words were out they gave him a feeling of self - confidence , and he began to sketch his plan , and then to go into its details . Clare listened devoutly , her eyes burning on him through the dusk like the stars deepening above the garden ; and when she got up to go in he followed her with a new sense of reassurance . The dinner that evening was unusually pleasant . Charles Bowen , just back from his usual spring travels , had come straight down to his friends from the steamer ; and the fund of impressions he brought with him gave Ralph a desire to be up and wandering . And why not -- when the book was done ? He smiled across the table at Clare . "
120731	120774	120712	120712	Charles	314	" Was it really he who was speaking , and his cousin who was sending him back her dusky smile ? Well -- why not , again ? The seasons renewed themselves , and he too was putting out a new growth . "
120784	120844	120845	120845	You	0	" kept repeating itself under all his thoughts , as Undine 's name had once perpetually murmured there . That night as he went up to bed he said to himself that he was actually ceasing to think about his wife ... As he passed Laura 's door she called him in , and put her arms about him . "

120860	121099	121165	121167	the Count "	5258	" he answered gaily , as if ridiculing the fancy that he had ever looked otherwise . Paul was sleeping behind the next door , and the sense of the boy 's nearness gave him a warmer glow . His little world was rounding itself out again , and once more he felt safe and at peace in its circle . His sister looked as if she had something more to say ; but she merely kissed him good night , and he went up whistling to his room . The next morning he was to take a walk with Clare , and while he lounged about the drawing - room , waiting for her to come down , a servant came in with the Sunday papers . Ralph picked one up , and was absently unfolding it when his eye fell on his own name : a sight he had been spared since the last echoes of his divorce had subsided . His impulse was to fling the paper down , to hurl it as far from him as he could ; but a grim fascination tightened his hold and drew his eyes back to the hated head - line .

121705	121912	121924	121924	I	0	" came from him involuntarily ; and she startled him by bursting into tears . He bent over and kissed her on the cheek . XXXII Ralph , as the days passed , felt that Clare was right : if Undine married again he would possess himself more completely , be more definitely rid of his past . And he did not doubt that she would gain her end : he knew her violent desires and her cold tenacity . If she had failed to capture Van Degen it was probably because she lacked experience of that particular type of man , of his huge immediate wants and feeble vacillating purposes ; most of all , because she had not yet measured the strength of the social considerations that restrained him . It was a mistake she was not likely to repeat , and her failure had probably been a useful preliminary to success . It was a long time since Ralph had allowed himself to think of her , and as he did so the overwhelming fact of her beauty became present to him again , no longer as an element of his being but as a power dispassionately estimated . He said to himself : "
121926	122212	122214	122214	Laura	203	" ; and the conviction grew in him that Raymond de Chelles , of whom he had formed an idea through Bowen 's talk , was not the man to give her up , even if she failed to obtain the release his religion exacted . Meanwhile Ralph was gradually beginning to feel himself freer and lighter . Undine 's act , by cutting the last link between them , seemed to have given him back to himself ; and the mere fact that he could consider his case in all its bearings , impartially and ironically , showed him the distance he had travelled , the extent to which he had renewed himself . He had been moved , too , by Clare 's cry of joy at his release . Though the nature of his feeling for her had not changed he was aware of a new quality in their friendship . When he went back to his book again his sense of power had lost its asperity , and the spectacle of life seemed less like a witless dangling of limp dolls . He was well on in his second chapter now . This lightness of mood was still on him when , returning one afternoon to Washington Square , full of projects for a long evening 's work , he found his mother awaiting him with a strange face . He followed her into the drawing - room , and she explained that there had been a telephone message she did n't understand -- something perfectly crazy about Paul -- of course it was all a mistake ... Ralph 's first thought was of an accident , and his heart contracted . "

122280	122305	122521	122521	Ralph	199	" She gave an uncertain laugh , and looked up at Ralph as though entreating him to return the reassurance she had given him . "
122312	122520	122528	122528	she	2794	" he echoed . He made his mother repeat her statement ; but the unforeseen always flurried her , and she was confused and inaccurate . She did n't actually know who had telephoned : the voice had n't sounded like Mrs. Spragg 's ... A woman 's voice ; yes -- oh , not a lady 's ! And there was certainly something about a steamer ... but he knew how the telephone bewildered her ... and she was sure she was getting a little deaf . Had n't he better call up the Malibran ? Of course it was all a mistake -- but ... well , perhaps he HAD better go there himself ... As he reached the front door a letter clinked in the box , and he saw his name on an ordinary looking business envelope . He turned the door - handle , paused again , and stooped to take out the letter . It bore the address of the firm of lawyers who had represented Undine in the divorce proceedings and as he tore open the envelope Paul 's name started out at him . Mrs. Marvell had followed him into the hall , and her cry broke the silence . "

122691	122872	122876	122877	Mr. Spragg	191	" The sole custody ! But that meant that Paul was hers , hers only , hers for always : that his father had no more claim on him than any casual stranger in the street ! And he , Ralph Marvell , a sane man , young , able - bodied , in full possession of his wits , had assisted at the perpetration of this abominable wrong , had passively forfeited his right to the flesh of his body , the blood of his being ! But it could n't be -- of course it could n't be . The preposterousness of it proved that it was n't true . There was a mistake somewhere ; a mistake his own lawyer would instantly rectify . If a hammer had n't been drumming in his head he could have recalled the terms of the decree -- but for the moment all the details of the agonizing episode were lost in a blur of uncertainty . To escape his mother 's silent anguish of interrogation he stood up and said : "
122886	122946	122876	122877	Mr. Spragg	191	" But as he spoke he retravelled the hateful months during the divorce proceedings , remembering his incomprehensible lassitude , his acquiescence in his family 's determination to ignore the whole episode , and his gradual lapse into the same state of apathy . He recalled all the old family catchwords , the full and elaborate vocabulary of evasion : "

123026	123352	123407	123407	You	2805	" For Paul 's sake ! And it was because , for Paul 's sake , there must be no scandal , that he , Paul 's father , had tamely abstained from defending his rights and contesting his wife 's charges , and had thus handed the child over to her keeping ! As his cab whirled him up Fifth Avenue , Ralph 's whole body throbbed with rage against the influences that had reduced him to such weakness . Then , gradually , he saw that the weakness was innate in him . He had been eloquent enough , in his free youth , against the conventions of his class ; yet when the moment came to show his contempt for them they had mysteriously mastered him , deflecting his course like some hidden hereditary failing . As he looked back it seemed as though even his great disaster had been conventionalized and sentimentalized by this inherited attitude : that the thoughts he had thought about it were only those of generations of Dagonets , and that there had been nothing real and his own in his life but the foolish passion he had been trying so hard to think out of existence . Halfway to the Malibran he changed his direction , and drove to the house of the lawyer he had consulted at the time of his divorce . The lawyer had not yet come up town , and Ralph had a half hour of bitter meditation before the sound of a latch - key brought him to his feet . The visit did not last long . His host , after an affable greeting , listened without surprise to what he had to say , and when he had ended reminded him with somewhat ironic precision that , at the time of the divorce , he had asked for neither advice nor information -- had simply declared that he wanted to "
123360	123406	123407	123407	You	2805	" ( Ralph recognized the phrase as one of his grandfather 's ) , and , on hearing that in that case he had only to abstain from action , and was in no need of legal services , had gone away without farther enquiries . "

123731	123778	123830	123831	My mother	4182	" Ralph thanked him and left . He sped northward to the Malibran , where he learned that Mr. and Mrs. Spragg were at dinner . He sent his name down to the subterranean restaurant , and Mr. Spragg presently appeared between the limp portieres of the "
123780	123818	123823	123823	Paul	218	" writing - room . He had grown older and heavier , as if illness instead of health had put more flesh on his bones , and there were greyish tints in the hollows of his face . "

124237	124282	124292	124292	you	2820	" Mr. Spragg received this passionate appeal in a silence that implied not so much disdain or indifference , as the total inability to deal verbally with emotional crises . At length , he said , a slight unsteadiness in his usually calm tones : "
124299	124300	124292	124292	you	2820	" "
124309	124320	124321	124321	I	0	" Ralph sneered . Mr. Spragg looked at him compassionately . "
124330	124476	124479	124480	Mrs. Spragg	194	" he said . XXXIII The upshot of Ralph 's visit was that Mr. Spragg , after considerable deliberation , agreed , pending farther negotiations between the opposing lawyers , to undertake that no attempt should be made to remove Paul from his father 's custody . Nevertheless , he seemed to think it quite natural that Undine , on the point of making a marriage which would put it in her power to give her child a suitable home , should assert her claim on him . It was more disconcerting to Ralph to learn that Mrs. Spragg , for once departing from her attitude of passive impartiality , had eagerly abetted her daughter 's move ; he had somehow felt that Undine 's desertion of the child had established a kind of mute understanding between himself and his mother - in - law . "
124495	124513	124516	124517	his grandma	2823	" he said with a desperate awkwardness of entreaty , and Mr. Spragg startled him by replying : "
124533	124788	124791	124791	she	2826	" Ralph , abruptly awakened from his dream of recovered peace , found himself confronted on every side by . indifference or hostility : it was as though the June fields in which his boy was playing had suddenly opened to engulph him . Mrs. Marvell 's fears and tremors were almost harder to bear than the Spraggs ' antagonism ; and for the next few days Ralph wandered about miserably , dreading some fresh communication from Undine 's lawyers , yet racked by the strain of hearing nothing more from them . Mr. Spragg had agreed to cable his daughter asking her to await a letter before enforcing her demands ; but on the fourth day after Ralph 's visit to the Malibran a telephone message summoned him to his father - in - law 's office . Half an hour later their talk was over and he stood once more on the landing outside Mr. Spragg 's door . Undine 's answer had come and Paul 's fate was sealed . His mother refused to give him up , refused to await the arrival of her lawyer 's letter , and reiterated , in more peremptory language , her demand that the child should be sent immediately to Paris in Mrs. Heeny 's care . Mr. Spragg , in face of Ralph 's entreaties , remained pacific but remote . It was evident that , though he had no wish to quarrel with Ralph , he saw no reason for resisting Undine . "
124800	124816	125031	125031	I	0	" he said ; and in response to Ralph 's passionate remonstrances he added fatalistically : "
124830	125030	125041	125042	my daughter	3805	" Ralph had gone to the office resolved to control his temper and keep on the watch for any shred of information he might glean ; but it soon became clear that Mr. Spragg knew as little as himself of Undine 's projects , or of the stage her plans had reached . All she had apparently vouchsafed her parent was the statement that she intended to re - marry , and the command to send Paul over ; and Ralph reflected that his own betrothal to her had probably been announced to Mr. Spragg in the same curt fashion . The thought brought back an overwhelming sense of the past . One by one the details of that incredible moment revived , and he felt in his veins the glow of rapture with which he had first approached the dingy threshold he was now leaving . There came back to him with peculiar vividness the memory of his rushing up to Mr. Spragg 's office to consult him about a necklace for Undine . Ralph recalled the incident because his eager appeal for advice had been received by Mr. Spragg with the very phrase he had just used : "
125044	125116	125125	125125	I	0	" Ralph saw him slouching in his chair , swung sideways from the untidy desk , his legs stretched out , his hands in his pockets , his jaws engaged on the phantom tooth - pick ; and , in a corner of the office , the figure of a middle - sized red - faced young man who seemed to have been interrupted in the act of saying something disagreeable . "
125130	125167	125519	125519	You	2829	" Ralph reflected ; and the thought suggested the memory of other , subsequent meetings in the same building , and of frequent ascents to Moffatt 's office during the ardent weeks of their mysterious and remunerative "
125170	125518	125567	125567	you	2829	" Ralph wondered if Moffatt 's office were still in the Ararat ; and on the way out he paused before the black tablet affixed to the wall of the vestibule and sought and found the name in its familiar place . The next moment he was again absorbed in his own cares . Now that he had learned the imminence of Paul 's danger , and the futility of pleading for delay , a thousand fantastic projects were contending in his head . To get the boy away -- that seemed the first thing to do : to put him out of reach , and then invoke the law , get the case re - opened , and carry the fight from court to court till his rights should be recognized . It would cost a lot of money -- well , the money would have to be found . The first step was to secure the boy 's temporary safety ; after that , the question of ways and means would have to be considered ... Had there ever been a time , Ralph wondered , when that question had n't been at the root of all the others ? He had promised to let Clare Van Degen know the result of his visit , and half an hour later he was in her drawing - room . It was the first time he had entered it since his divorce ; but Van Degen was tarpon - fishing in California -- and besides , he had to see Clare . His one relief was in talking to her , in feverishly turning over with her every possibility of delay and obstruction ; and he marvelled at the intelligence and energy she brought to the discussion of these questions . It was as if she had never before felt strongly enough about anything to put her heart or her brains into it ; but now everything in her was at work for him . She listened intently to what he told her ; then she said : "
125552	125564	125574	125574	her	192	" Ralph looked at her in surprise , and she continued : "
125581	125582	125655	125655	I	0	" "
125636	125640	125690	125690	she	192	" Clare considered . "
125699	125706	125710	125710	you	2829	" Ralph uttered an incredulous exclamation . "
125713	125718	125746	125746	she	192	" she hurried on . "
125758	125770	125784	125784	You	0	" She stood up and came to him with outstretched hands . "

125837	125908	125833	125834	any others	2836	" Her eyes followed him intently as he turned away to the window and stood staring down at the sultry prospect of Fifth Avenue . As he turned over her conjecture its probability became more and more apparent . It put into logical relation all the incoherencies of Undine 's recent conduct , completed and defined her anew as if a sharp line had been drawn about her fading image . "
125919	125998	126004	126004	you	0	" he said , turning back into the room . His course had instantly become plain . He had only to resist and Undine would have to show her hand . Simultaneously with this thought there sprang up in his mind the remembrance of the autumn afternoon in Paris when he had come home and found her , among her half - packed finery , desperately bewailing her coming motherhood . Clare 's touch was on his arm . "
126010	126025	126082	126082	Your	0	" He laid his hand on hers without speaking , and she went on : "

126210	126216	126217	126217	I	0	" but he simply repeated : "
126220	126221	126223	126223	you	0	" "

126269	126479	126254	126254	you	0	" XXXIV The means of raising the requisite amount of money became , during the next few weeks , the anxious theme of all Ralph 's thoughts . His lawyers ' enquiries soon brought the confirmation of Clare 's surmise , and it became clear that -- for reasons swathed in all the ingenuities of legal verbiage -- Undine might , in return for a substantial consideration , be prevailed on to admit that it was for her son 's advantage to remain with his father . The day this admission was communicated to Ralph his first impulse was to carry the news to his cousin . His mood was one of pure exaltation ; he seemed to be hugging his boy to him as he walked . Paul and he were to belong to each other forever : no mysterious threat of separation could ever menace them again ! He had the blissful sense of relief that the child himself might have had on waking out of a frightened dream and finding the jolly daylight in his room . Clare at once renewed her entreaty to be allowed to aid in ransoming her little cousin , but Ralph tried to put her off by explaining that he meant to "
126483	126484	126507	126507	you	199	" "
126514	126752	126507	126507	you	199	" It was amazing how his cousin suddenly dominated him . But as yet he could n't go into the details of the bargain . That the reckoning between himself and Undine should be settled in dollars and cents seemed the last bitterest satire on his dreams : he felt himself miserably diminished by the smallness of what had filled his world . Nevertheless , the looking about had to be done ; and a day came when he found himself once more at the door of Elmer Moffatt 's office . His thoughts had been drawn back to Moffatt by the insistence with which the latter 's name had lately been put forward by the press in connection with a revival of the Ararat investigation . Moffatt , it appeared , had been regarded as one of the most valuable witnesses for the State ; his return from Europe had been anxiously awaited , his unreadiness to testify caustically criticized ; then at last he had arrived , had gone on to Washington -- and had apparently had nothing to tell . Ralph was too deep in his own troubles to waste any wonder over this anticlimax ; but the frequent appearance of Moffatt 's name in the morning papers acted as an unconscious suggestion . Besides , to whom else could he look for help ? The sum his wife demanded could be acquired only by "
126757	126805	126507	126507	you	199	" and the fact that Ralph had once rendered the same kind of service to Moffatt made it natural to appeal to him now . The market , moreover , happened to be booming , and it seemed not unlikely that so experienced a speculator might have a "
126808	126854	126507	126507	you	199	" up his sleeve . Moffatt 's office had been transformed since Ralph 's last visit . Paint , varnish and brass railings gave an air of opulence to the outer precincts , and the inner room , with its mahogany bookcases containing morocco - bound "
126856	126948	126962	126962	You	2846	" and its wide blue leather arm - chairs , lacked only a palm or two to resemble the lounge of a fashionable hotel . Moffatt himself , as he came forward , gave Ralph the impression of having been done over by the same hand : he was smoother , broader , more supremely tailored , and his whole person exhaled the faintest whiff of an expensive scent . He installed his visitor in one of the blue arm - chairs , and sitting opposite , an elbow on his impressive "
126950	126961	126962	126962	You	2846	" desk , listened attentively while Ralph made his request . "

He knew he could count on half the amount from his grandfather ; could possibly ask Fairford for a small additional loan -- but what of the rest ? Well , there was Clare . He had always known there would be no other way . And after all , the money was Clare's -- it was Dagonet money . At least she said it was . All the misery of his predicament was distilled into the short silence that preceded his answer : "

127693	127773	127841	127841	I	0	" Clare 's inner sitting - room was empty ; but the servant , presently returning , led Ralph into the gilded and tapestried wilderness where she occasionally chose to receive her visitors . There , under Popple 's effigy of herself , she sat , small and alone , on a monumental sofa behind a tea - table laden with gold plate ; while from his lofty frame , on the opposite wall Van Degen , portrayed by a "
127775	127840	127897	127897	he	2857	" artist , cast on her the satisfied eye of proprietorship . Ralph , swept forward on the blast of his excitement , felt as in a dream the frivolous perversity of her receiving him in such a setting instead of in their usual quiet corner ; but there was no room in his mind for anything but the cry that broke from him : "
127848	127894	127968	127968	I	0	" He sat down and explained to her by what means , trying , as best he could , to restate the particulars of Moffatt 's deal ; and her manifest ignorance of business methods had the effect of making his vagueness appear less vague . "

His mother had something put by that she insisted on contributing ; and Henley Fairford , of his own accord , had come forward with ten thousand : it was awfully decent of Henley ... "

128337	128372	128557	128557	He	2862	" he said ; and they stood and looked at each other like radiant children . She followed him to the door , and as he turned to leave he broke into a laugh . "
128385	128556	128566	128566	Ralph--	374	" She was close beside him , her hand on the heavy tapestry curtaining the door ; and her glance shot past him to her husband 's portrait . Ralph caught the look , and a flood of old tendernesses and hates welled up in him . He drew her under the portrait and kissed her vehemently . XXXV Within forty - eight hours Ralph 's money was in Moffatt 's hands , and the interval of suspense had begun . The transaction over , he felt the deceptive buoyancy that follows on periods of painful indecision . It seemed to him that now at last life had freed him from all trammelling delusions , leaving him only the best thing in its gift -- his boy . The things he meant Paul to do and to be filled his fancy with happy pictures . The child was growing more and more interesting -- throwing out countless tendrils of feeling and perception that delighted Ralph but preoccupied the watchful Laura . "
128567	128575	128581	128581	I	0	" she paused and then risked it : "
128595	128602	129024	129024	him	2867	" Ralph laughed , understanding her . "
128641	129021	129024	129024	him	2867	" His book too was spreading and throwing out tendrils , and he worked at it in the white heat of energy which his factitious exhilaration produced . For a few weeks everything he did and said seemed as easy and unconditioned as the actions in a dream . Clare Van Degen , in the light of this mood , became again the comrade of his boyhood . He did not see her often , for she had gone down to the country with her children , but they communicated daily by letter or telephone , and now and then she came over to the Fairfords ' for a night . There they renewed the long rambles of their youth , and once more the summer fields and woods seemed full of magic presences . Clare was no more intelligent , she followed him no farther in his flights ; but some of the qualities that had become most precious to him were as native to her as its perfume to a flower . So , through the long June afternoons , they ranged together over many themes ; and if her answers sometimes missed the mark it did not matter , because her silences never did . Meanwhile Ralph , from various sources , continued to pick up a good deal of more or less contradictory information about Elmer Moffatt . It seemed to be generally understood that Moffatt had come back from Europe with the intention of testifying in the Ararat investigation , and that his former patron , the great Harmon B. Driscoll , had managed to silence him ; and it was implied that the price of this silence , which was set at a considerable figure , had been turned to account in a series of speculations likely to lift Moffatt to permanent eminence among the rulers of Wall Street . The stories as to his latest achievement , and the theories as to the man himself , varied with the visual angle of each reporter : and whenever any attempt was made to focus his hard sharp personality some guardian divinity seemed to throw a veil of mystery over him . His detractors , however , were the first to own that there was "
129025	129050	129024	129024	him	2867	" ; it was felt that he had passed beyond the meteoric stage , and the business world was unanimous in recognizing that he had "
129055	129104	129208	129209	the man	1579	" A dawning sense of his stability was even beginning to make itself felt in Fifth Avenue . It was said that he had bought a house in Seventy - second Street , then that he meant to build near the Park ; one or two people ( always "
129109	129207	129208	129209	the man	1579	" ) had been to his flat in the Pactolus , to see his Chinese porcelains and Persian rugs ; now and then he had a few important men to dine at a Fifth Avenue restaurant ; his name began to appear in philanthropic reports and on municipal committees ( there were even rumours of its having been put up at a well - known club ) ; and the rector of a wealthy parish , who was raising funds for a chantry , was known to have met him at dinner and to have stated afterward that "
129216	129317	129208	129209	the man	1579	" All these converging proofs of Moffatt 's solidity strengthened Ralph 's faith in his venture . He remembered with what astuteness and authority Moffatt had conducted their real estate transaction -- how far off and unreal it all seemed!--and awaited events with the passive faith of a sufferer in the hands of a skilful surgeon . The days moved on toward the end of June , and each morning Ralph opened his newspaper with a keener thrill of expectation . Any day now he might read of the granting of the Apex charter : Moffatt had assured him it would "
129320	129509	129683	129683	their	2870	" before the close of the month . But the announcement did not appear , and after what seemed to Ralph a decent lapse of time he telephoned to ask for news . Moffatt was away , and when he came back a few days later he answered Ralph 's enquiries evasively , with an edge of irritation in his voice . The same day Ralph received a letter from his lawyer , who had been reminded by Mrs. Marvell 's representatives that the latest date agreed on for the execution of the financial agreement was the end of the following week . Ralph , alarmed , betook himself at once to the Ararat , and his first glimpse of Moffatt 's round common face and fastidiously dressed person gave him an immediate sense of reassurance . He felt that under the circle of baldness on top of that carefully brushed head lay the solution of every monetary problem that could beset the soul of man . Moffatt 's voice had recovered its usual cordial note , and the warmth of his welcome dispelled Ralph 's last apprehension . "
129561	129590	129683	129683	their	2870	" An office - boy came in with a name on a slip of paper , and Moffatt looked at his watch and held out a hearty hand . "
129612	129681	129683	129683	their	2870	" and he steered Ralph out by another door . July came , and passed into its second week . Ralph 's lawyer had obtained a postponement from the other side , but Undine 's representatives had given him to understand that the transaction must be closed before the first of August . Ralph telephoned once or twice to Moffatt , receiving genially - worded assurances that everything was "
129685	129970	129683	129683	their	2870	" ; but he felt a certain embarrassment in returning again to the office , and let himself drift through the days in a state of hungry apprehension . Finally one afternoon Henley Fairford , coming back from town ( which Ralph had left in the morning to join his boy over Sunday ) , brought word that the Apex consolidation scheme had failed to get its charter . It was useless to attempt to reach Moffatt on Sunday , and Ralph wore on as he could through the succeeding twenty - four hours . Clare Van Degen had come down to stay with her youngest boy , and in the afternoon she and Ralph took the two children for a sail . A light breeze brightened the waters of the Sound , and they ran down the shore before it and then tacked out toward the sunset , coming back at last , under a failing breeze , as the summer sky passed from blue to a translucid green and then into the accumulating greys of twilight . As they left the landing and walked up behind the children across the darkening lawn , a sense of security descended again on Ralph . He could not believe that such a scene and such a mood could be the disguise of any impending evil , and all his doubts and anxieties fell away from him . The next morning , he and Clare travelled up to town together , and at the station he put her in the motor which was to take her to Long Island , and hastened down to Moffatt 's office . When he arrived he was told that Moffatt was "
129973	130088	130091	130091	she	2873	" and he had to wait for nearly half an hour in the outer office , where , to the steady click of the type - writer and the spasmodic buzzing of the telephone , his thoughts again began their restless circlings . Finally the inner door opened , and he found himself in the sanctuary . Moffatt was seated behind his desk , examining another little crystal vase somewhat like the one he had shown Ralph a few weeks earlier . As his visitor entered , he held it up against the light , revealing on its dewy sides an incised design as frail as the shadow of grass - blades on water . "
130095	130110	130091	130091	she	2873	" He put the toy down and reached across the desk to shake hands . "

131256	131277	131250	131250	you	0	" he finally raised his head to ask . The word came out of the depths of Ralph 's anguish : "

131352	131368	131343	131343	she	4218	" Moffatt , abandoning the boots , was scrutinizing him through half - shut lids . "

131389	131452	131454	131454	your	2891	" Ralph felt himself whiten . Was it insolence or ignorance that had prompted Moffatt 's speech ? Nothing in his voice or face showed the sense of any shades of expression or of feeling : he seemed to apply to everything the measure of the same crude flippancy . But such considerations could not curb Ralph now . He said to himself "
131460	131468	131454	131454	your	2891	" and his anger suddenly boiled over . "
131474	131483	131497	131498	any one	659	" he said , getting to his feet , "

131559	131624	131628	131629	THIS man	2893	" For an instant the words conveyed no meaning to Ralph ; then they surged up into his brain and flung him forward with half - raised arm . But he felt the grotesqueness of the gesture and his arm dropped back to his side . A series of unimportant and irrelevant things raced through his mind ; then obscurity settled down on it . "
131631	131642	131647	131647	you	0	" was the one fiery point in his darkened consciousness .... "

131777	131823	131773	131773	I	0	" Ralph had stood listening without a sign , but as Moffatt ended he made a slight motion of acquiescence . He did not otherwise change his attitude , except to grasp with one hand the back of the chair that Moffatt pushed toward him . "
131828	131844	132270	132271	THIS man	2893	" Moffatt himself dropped back into his seat and took the pose of easy narrative . "
132110	132269	132273	132274	THIS man	2893	" He still kept to his half - humorous minor key , as though he were in the first stages of an after - dinner speech ; but as he went on his bodily presence , which hitherto had seemed to Ralph the mere average garment of vulgarity , began to loom , huge and portentous as some monster released from a magician 's bottle . His redness , his glossiness , his baldness , and the carefully brushed ring of hair encircling it ; the square line of his shoulders , the too careful fit of his clothes , the prominent lustre of his scarf - pin , the growth of short black hair on his manicured hands , even the tiny cracks and crows'-feet beginning to show in the hard close surface of his complexion : all these solid witnesses to his reality and his proximity pressed on Ralph with the mounting pang of physical nausea . "
132276	132336	132344	132344	they	2909	" he could n't get beyond the thought : whichever way he turned his haggard thought , there was Moffatt bodily blocking the perspective ... Ralph 's eyes roamed toward the crystal toy that stood on the desk beside Moffatt 's hand . Faugh ! That such a hand should have touched it ! Suddenly he heard himself speaking . "
132350	132351	132365	132365	You	2893	" "
132359	132364	132374	132375	Mr. Spragg	191	" Ralph pushed on : "
132379	132393	132516	132516	He	2913	" Moffatt considered a moment , as if the incident had escaped him . "
132399	132515	132516	132516	He	2913	" He seemed benevolently ready for enlightenment . But Ralph had been assailed by another memory ; he recalled that Moffatt had dined one night in his house , that he and the man who now faced him had sat at the same table , their wife between them ... He was seized with another dumb gust of fury ; but it died out and left him face to face with the uselessness , the irrelevance of all the old attitudes of appropriation and defiance . He seemed to be stumbling about in his inherited prejudices like a modern man in mediaeval armour ... Moffatt still sat at his desk , unmoved and apparently uncomprehending . "
132526	132565	132808	132808	I	0	" flashed through Ralph ; and the whole archaic structure of his rites and sanctions tumbled down about him . Through the noise of the crash he heard Moffatt 's voice going on without perceptible change of tone : "
132602	132804	132960	132960	I	0	" Ralph turned from the voice , and found himself outside on the landing , and then in the street below . XXXVI He stood at the corner of Wall Street , looking up and down its hot summer perspective . He noticed the swirls of dust in the cracks of the pavement , the rubbish in the gutters , the ceaseless stream of perspiring faces that poured by under tilted hats . He found himself , next , slipping northward between the glazed walls of the Subway , another languid crowd in the seats about him and the nasal yelp of the stations ringing through the car like some repeated ritual wail . The blindness within him seemed to have intensified his physical perceptions , his sensitiveness to the heat , the noise , the smells of the dishevelled midsummer city ; but combined with the acuter perception of these offenses was a complete indifference to them , as though he were some vivisected animal deprived of the power of discrimination . Now he had turned into Waverly Place , and was walking westward toward Washington Square . At the corner he pulled himself up , saying half - aloud : "
132816	132959	132960	132960	I	0	" He drew out his watch and stared at it blankly . What the devil had he taken it out for ? He had to go through a laborious process of readjustment to find out what it had to say .... Twelve o'clock .... Should he turn back to the office ? It seemed easier to cross the square , go up the steps of the old house and slip his key into the door .... The house was empty . His mother , a few days previously , had departed with Mr. Dagonet for their usual two months on the Maine coast , where Ralph was to join them with his boy .... The blinds were all drawn down , and the freshness and silence of the marble - paved hall laid soothing hands on him .... He said to himself : "
132975	133054	132960	132960	I	0	" He laid down his hat and stick and climbed the carpetless stairs to his room . When he entered it he had the shock of feeling himself in a strange place : it did not seem like anything he had ever seen before . Then , one by one , all the old stale usual things in it confronted him , and he longed with a sick intensity to be in a place that was really strange . "
133065	133166	133216	133216	Father	239	" he wondered . A careless servant had left the outer shutters open , and the sun was beating on the window - panes . Ralph pushed open the windows , shut the shutters , and wandered toward his arm - chair . Beads of perspiration stood on his forehead : the temperature of the room reminded him of the heat under the ilexes of the Sienese villa where he and Undine had sat through a long July afternoon . He saw her before him , leaning against the tree - trunk in her white dress , limpid and inscrutable .... "
133176	133215	133613	133613	I	0	" Had she been thinking of it that afternoon at Siena , he wondered ? Did she ever think of it at all ? ... It was she who had asked Moffatt to dine . She had said : "
133233	133612	133662	133662	she	199	since"--and the man she spoke of had had her in his arms ... and perhaps it was really all she remembered ! She had lied to him -- lied to him from the first ... there had n't been a moment when she had n't lied to him , deliberately , ingeniously and inventively . As he thought of it , there came to him , for the first time in months , that overwhelming sense of her physical nearness which had once so haunted and tortured him . Her freshness , her fragrance , the luminous haze of her youth , filled the room with a mocking glory ; and he dropped his head on his hands to shut it out .... The vision was swept away by another wave of hurrying thoughts . He felt it was intensely important that he should keep the thread of every one of them , that they all represented things to be said or done , or guarded against ; and his mind , with the unwondering versatility and tireless haste of the dreamer 's brain , seemed to be pursuing them all simultaneously . Then they became as unreal and meaningless as the red specks dancing behind the lids against which he had pressed his fists clenched , and he had the feeling that if he opened his eyes they would vanish , and the familiar daylight look in on him .... A knock disturbed him . The old parlour - maid who was always left in charge of the house had come up to ask if he was n't well , and if there was anything she could do for him . He told her no ... he was perfectly well ... or , rather , no , he was n't ... he supposed it must be the heat ; and he began to scold her for having forgotten to close the shutters . It was n't her fault , it appeared , but Eliza 's : her tone implied that he knew what one had to expect of Eliza ... and would n't he go down to the nice cool shady dining - room , and let her make him an iced drink and a few sandwiches ?

He said to himself that perhaps she was right ... that perhaps there was something he ought to do ... that his mother was old , and did n't always see things ; and for a while his mind revolved this problem with feverish intensity ....

133857	133943	133992	133992	they	2926	" He dropped back in his chair and took his head between his hands . He had forgotten what he wanted the money for . He made a great effort to regain hold of the idea , but all the whirring , shuttling , flying had abruptly ceased in his brain , and he sat with his eyes shut , staring straight into darkness .... The clock struck , and he remembered that he had said he would go down to the dining - room . "
133952	133988	134030	134030	She	2925	" He raised his head and sat listening for the sound of the old woman 's step : it seemed to him perfectly intolerable that any one should cross the threshold of the room again . "
133997	134029	134030	134030	She	2925	" he groaned .... At length through the silence of the empty house , he fancied he heard a door opening and closing far below ; and he said to himself : "
134034	134183	134365	134365	Paul	218	" He got to his feet and went to the door . He did n't feel anything now except the insane dread of hearing the woman 's steps come nearer . He bolted the door and stood looking about the room . For a moment he was conscious of seeing it in every detail with a distinctness he had never before known ; then everything in it vanished but the single narrow panel of a drawer under one of the bookcases . He went up to the drawer , knelt down and slipped his hand into it . As he raised himself he listened again , and this time he distinctly heard the old servant 's steps on the stairs . He passed his left hand over the side of his head , and down the curve of the skull behind the ear . He said to himself : "
134196	134364	134401	134401	she	2928	" and a last flash of irony twitched through him . Then he felt again , more deliberately , for the spot he wanted , and put the muzzle of his revolver against it . XXXVII In a drawing - room hung with portraits of high - nosed personages in perukes and orders , a circle of ladies and gentlemen , looking not unlike every - day versions of the official figures above their heads , sat examining with friendly interest a little boy in mourning . The boy was slim , fair and shy , and his small black figure , islanded in the middle of the wide lustrous floor , looked curiously lonely and remote . This effect of remoteness seemed to strike his mother as something intentional , and almost naughty , for after having launched him from the door , and waited to judge of the impression he produced , she came forward and , giving him a slight push , said impatiently : "
134378	134399	134401	134401	she	2928	" The boy , without turning to her , or moving , sent his blue glance gravely about the circle . "

134594	134626	134531	134532	old chap	2774	" Undine urged . An odd mingling of emotions stirred in her while she stood watching Paul make the round of the family group under her husband 's guidance . It was "
134628	135522	134531	134532	old chap	2774	" to have the child back , and to find him , after their three years ' separation , grown into so endearing a figure : her first glimpse of him when , in Mrs. Heeny 's arms , he had emerged that morning from the steamer train , had shown what an acquisition he would be . If she had had any lingering doubts on the point , the impression produced on her husband would have dispelled them . Chelles had been instantly charmed , and Paul , in a shy confused way , was already responding to his advances . The Count and Countess Raymond had returned but a few weeks before from their protracted wedding journey , and were staying -- as they were apparently to do whenever they came to Paris -- with the old Marquis , Raymond 's father , who had amicably proposed that little Paul Marvell should also share the hospitality of the Hotel de Chelles . Undine , at first , was somewhat dismayed to find that she was expected to fit the boy and his nurse into a corner of her contracted entresol . But the possibility of a mother 's not finding room for her son , however cramped her own quarters , seemed not to have occurred to her new relations , and the preparing of her dressing - room and boudoir for Paul 's occupancy was carried on by the household with a zeal which obliged her to dissemble her lukewarmness . Undine had supposed that on her marriage one of the great suites of the Hotel de Chelles would be emptied of its tenants and put at her husband 's disposal ; but she had since learned that , even had such a plan occurred to her parents - in - law , considerations of economy would have hindered it . The old Marquis and his wife , who were content , when they came up from Burgundy in the spring , with a modest set of rooms looking out on the court of their ancestral residence , expected their son and his wife to fit themselves into the still smaller apartment which had served as Raymond 's bachelor lodging . The rest of the fine old mouldering house -- the tall - windowed premier on the garden , and the whole of the floor above -- had been let for years to old fashioned tenants who would have been more surprised than their landlord had he suddenly proposed to dispossess them . Undine , at first , had regarded these arrangements as merely provisional . She was persuaded that , under her influence , Raymond would soon convert his parents to more modern ideas , and meanwhile she was still in the flush of a completer well - being than she had ever known , and disposed , for the moment , to make light of any inconveniences connected with it . The three months since her marriage had been more nearly like what she had dreamed of than any of her previous experiments in happiness . At last she had what she wanted , and for the first time the glow of triumph was warmed by a deeper feeling . Her husband was really charming ( it was odd how he reminded her of Ralph ! ) , and after her bitter two years of loneliness and humiliation it was delicious to find herself once more adored and protected . The very fact that Raymond was more jealous of her than Ralph had ever been -- or at any rate less reluctant to show it -- gave her a keener sense of recovered power . None of the men who had been in love with her before had been so frankly possessive , or so eager for reciprocal assurances of constancy . She knew that Ralph had suffered deeply from her intimacy with Van Degen , but he had betrayed his feeling only by a more studied detachment ; and Van Degen , from the first , had been contemptuously indifferent to what she did or felt when she was out of his sight . As to her earlier experiences , she had frankly forgotten them : her sentimental memories went back no farther than the beginning of her New York career . Raymond seemed to attach more importance to love , in all its manifestations , than was usual or convenient in a husband ; and she gradually began to be aware that her domination over him involved a corresponding loss of independence . Since their return to Paris she had found that she was expected to give a circumstantial report of every hour she spent away from him . She had nothing to hide , and no designs against his peace of mind except those connected with her frequent and costly sessions at the dress - makers ' ; but she had never before been called upon to account to any one for the use of her time , and after the first amused surprise at Raymond 's always wanting to know where she had been and whom she had seen she began to be oppressed by so exacting a devotion . Her parents , from her tenderest youth , had tacitly recognized her inalienable right to "
135526	135609	136095	136095	she	2955	" and Ralph -- though from motives which she divined to be different -- had shown the same respect for her freedom . It was therefore disconcerting to find that Raymond expected her to choose her friends , and even her acquaintances , in conformity not only with his personal tastes but with a definite and complicated code of family prejudices and traditions ; and she was especially surprised to discover that he viewed with disapproval her intimacy with the Princess Estradina . "
135773	136089	136105	136106	the Chelles	382	" Agreeable as it was to Undine that an appeal to her discretion should be based on the ground of her youth and good - looks , she was dismayed to find herself cut off from the very circle she had meant them to establish her in . Before she had become Raymond 's wife there had been a moment of sharp tension in her relations with the Princess Estradina and the old Duchess . They had done their best to prevent her marrying their cousin , and had gone so far as openly to accuse her of being the cause of a breach between themselves and his parents . But Ralph Marvell 's death had brought about a sudden change in her situation . She was now no longer a divorced woman struggling to obtain ecclesiastical sanction for her remarriage , but a widow whose conspicuous beauty and independent situation made her the object of lawful aspirations . The first person to seize on this distinction and make the most of it was her old enemy the Marquise de Trezac . The latter , who had been loudly charged by the house of Chelles with furthering her beautiful compatriot 's designs , had instantly seen a chance of vindicating herself by taking the widowed Mrs. Marvell under her wing and favouring the attentions of other suitors . These were not lacking , and the expected result had followed . Raymond de Chelles , more than ever infatuated as attainment became less certain , had claimed a definite promise from Undine , and his family , discouraged by his persistent bachelorhood , and their failure to fix his attention on any of the amiable maidens obviously designed to continue the race , had ended by withdrawing their opposition and discovering in Mrs. Marvell the moral and financial merits necessary to justify their change of front . "
136110	136119	136368	136368	You	2965	" Madame de Trezac went about indefatigably proclaiming . "
136198	136367	136381	136381	you	2965	" Madame de Trezac had lately discovered that the proper attitude for the American married abroad was that of a militant patriotism ; and she flaunted Undine Marvell in the face of the Faubourg like a particularly showy specimen of her national banner . The success of the experiment emboldened her to throw off the most sacred observances of her past . She took up Madame Adelschein , she entertained the James J. Rollivers , she resuscitated Creole dishes , she patronized negro melodists , she abandoned her weekly teas for impromptu afternoon dances , and the prim drawing - room in which dowagers had droned echoed with a cosmopolitan hubbub . Even when the period of tension was over , and Undine had been officially received into the family of her betrothed , Madame de Trezac did not at once surrender . She laughingly professed to have had enough of the proprieties , and declared herself bored by the social rites she had hitherto so piously performed . "
136390	136463	136573	136574	his people--	2976	" she said as she embraced the bride after the wedding breakfast ; and Undine hoped that the devoted Nettie would in fact provide a refuge from the extreme domesticity of her new state . But since her return to Paris , and her taking up her domicile in the Hotel de Chelles , she had found Madame de Trezac less and less disposed to abet her in any assertion of independence . "
136575	136583	136585	136585	Madame	353	" and Madame de Trezac , with a "
136587	136689	136766	136766	They	2977	" swept forward from her tea - table to receive the first of the returning dowagers . It was about this time that Mrs. Heeny arrived with Paul ; and for a while Undine was pleasantly absorbed in her boy . She kept Mrs. Heeny in Paris for a fortnight , and between her more pressing occupations it amused her to listen to the masseuse 's New York gossip and her comments on the social organization of the old world . It was Mrs. Heeny 's first visit to Europe , and she confessed to Undine that she had always wanted to "
136694	136765	136808	136808	They	2977	aristocracy"--using the phrase as a naturalist might , with no hint of personal pretensions . Mrs. Heeny 's democratic ease was combined with the strictest professional discretion , and it would never have occurred to her to regard herself , or to wish others to regard her , as anything but a manipulator of muscles ; but in that character she felt herself entitled to admission to the highest circles . "
136819	136847	137015	137015	he	2984	" And she poured into Undine 's half - envious ear a list of the entertainments which had illuminated the last weeks of the New York winter . "
137031	137158	137015	137015	he	2984	" but she broke off suddenly , as if something in Undine 's look had silenced her . Even to herself . Undine did not like to call up the image of Ralph Marvell ; and any mention of his name gave her a vague sense of distress . His death had released her , had given her what she wanted ; yet she could honestly say to herself that she had not wanted him to die -- at least not to die like that .... People said at the time that it was the hot weather -- his own family had said so : he had never quite got over his attack of pneumonia , and the sudden rise of temperature -- one of the fierce "
137162	137581	137015	137015	he	2984	" that devastate New York in summer -- had probably affected his brain : the doctors said such cases were not uncommon .... She had worn black for a few weeks -- not quite mourning , but something decently regretful ( the dress - makers were beginning to provide a special garb for such cases ) ; and even since her remarriage , and the lapse of a year , she continued to wish that she could have got what she wanted without having had to pay that particular price for it . This feeling was intensified by an incident -- in itself far from unwelcome -- which had occurred about three months after Ralph 's death . Her lawyers had written to say that the sum of a hundred thousand dollars had been paid over to Marvell 's estate by the Apex Consolidation Company ; and as Marvell had left a will bequeathing everything he possessed to his son , this unexpected windfall handsomely increased Paul 's patrimony . Undine had never relinquished her claim on her child ; she had merely , by the advice of her lawyers , waived the assertion of her right for a few months after Marvell 's death , with the express stipulation that her doing so was only a temporary concession to the feelings of her husband 's family ; and she had held out against all attempts to induce her to surrender Paul permanently . Before her marriage she had somewhat conspicuously adopted her husband 's creed , and the Dagonets , picturing Paul as the prey of the Jesuits , had made the mistake of appealing to the courts for his custody . This had confirmed Undine 's resistance , and her determination to keep the child . The case had been decided in her favour , and she had thereupon demanded , and obtained , an allowance of five thousand dollars , to be devoted to the bringing up and education of her son . This sum , added to what Mr. Spragg had agreed to give her , made up an income which had appreciably bettered her position , and justified Madame de Trezac 's discreet allusions to her wealth . Nevertheless , it was one of the facts about which she least liked to think when any chance allusion evoked Ralph 's image . The money was hers , of course ; she had a right to it , and she was an ardent believer in "
137584	137802	137824	137824	you	4259	" But she wished she could have got it in some other way -- she hated the thought of it as one more instance of the perverseness with which things she was entitled to always came to her as if they had been stolen . The approach of summer , and the culmination of the Paris season , swept aside such thoughts . The Countess Raymond de Chelles , contrasting her situation with that of Mrs. Undine Marvell , and the fulness and animation of her new life with the vacant dissatisfied days which had followed on her return from Dakota , forgot the smallness of her apartment , the inconvenient proximity of Paul and his nurse , the interminable round of visits with her mother - in - law , and the long dinners in the solemn hotels of all the family connection . The world was radiant , the lights were lit , the music playing ; she was still young , and better - looking than ever , with a Countess 's coronet , a famous chateau and a handsome and popular husband who adored her . And then suddenly the lights went out and the music stopped when one day Raymond , putting his arm about her , said in his tenderest tones : "
137833	138562	137824	137824	you	4259	" XXXVIII In a window of the long gallery of the chateau de Saint Desert the new Marquise de Chelles stood looking down the poplar avenue into the November rain . It had been raining heavily and persistently for a longer time than she could remember . Day after day the hills beyond the park had been curtained by motionless clouds , the gutters of the long steep roofs had gurgled with a perpetual overflow , the opaque surface of the moat been peppered by a continuous pelting of big drops . The water lay in glassy stretches under the trees and along the sodden edges of the garden - paths , it rose in a white mist from the fields beyond , it exuded in a chill moisture from the brick flooring of the passages and from the walls of the rooms on the lower floor . Everything in the great empty house smelt of dampness : the stuffing of the chairs , the threadbare folds of the faded curtains , the splendid tapestries , that were fading too , on the walls of the room in which Undine stood , and the wide bands of crape which her husband had insisted on her keeping on her black dresses till the last hour of her mourning for the old Marquis . The summer had been more than usually inclement , and since her first coming to the country Undine had lived through many periods of rainy weather ; but none which had gone before had so completely epitomized , so summed up in one vast monotonous blur , the image of her long months at Saint Desert . When , the year before , she had reluctantly suffered herself to be torn from the joys of Paris , she had been sustained by the belief that her exile would not be of long duration . Once Paris was out of sight , she had even found a certain lazy charm in the long warm days at Saint Desert . Her parents - in - law had remained in town , and she enjoyed being alone with her husband , exploring and appraising the treasures of the great half abandoned house , and watching her boy scamper over the June meadows or trot about the gardens on the poney his stepfather had given him . Paul , after Mrs. Heeny 's departure , had grown fretful and restive , and Undine had found it more and more difficult to fit his small exacting personality into her cramped rooms and crowded life . He irritated her by pining for his Aunt Laura , his Marvell granny , and old Mr. Dagonet 's funny stories about gods and fairies ; and his wistful allusions to his games with Clare 's children sounded like a lesson he might have been drilled in to make her feel how little he belonged to her . But once released from Paris , and blessed with rabbits , a poney and the freedom of the fields , he became again all that a charming child should be , and for a time it amused her to share in his romps and rambles . Raymond seemed enchanted at the picture they made , and the quiet weeks of fresh air and outdoor activity gave her back a bloom that reflected itself in her tranquillized mood . She was the more resigned to this interlude because she was so sure of its not lasting . Before they left Paris a doctor had been found to say that Paul -- who was certainly looking pale and pulled - down -- was in urgent need of sea air , and Undine had nearly convinced her husband of the expediency of hiring a chalet at Deauville for July and August , when this plan , and with it every other prospect of escape , was dashed by the sudden death of the old Marquis . Undine , at first , had supposed that the resulting change could not be other than favourable . She had been on too formal terms with her father - in - law -- a remote and ceremonious old gentleman to whom her own personality was evidently an insoluble enigma -- to feel more than the merest conventional pang at his death ; and it was certainly "
138565	139667	137824	137824	you	4259	" to be a marchioness than a countess , and to know that one 's husband was the head of the house . Besides , now they would have the chateau to themselves -- or at least the old Marquise , when she came , would be there as a guest and not a ruler -- and visions of smart house - parties and big shoots lit up the first weeks of Undine 's enforced seclusion . Then , by degrees , the inexorable conditions of French mourning closed in on her . Immediately after the long - drawn funeral observances the bereaved family -- mother , daughters , sons and sons - in - law -- came down to seclude themselves at Saint Desert ; and Undine , through the slow hot crape - smelling months , lived encircled by shrouded images of woe in which the only live points were the eyes constantly fixed on her least movements . The hope of escaping to the seaside with Paul vanished in the pained stare with which her mother - in - law received the suggestion . Undine learned the next day that it had cost the old Marquise a sleepless night , and might have had more distressing results had it not been explained as a harmless instance of transatlantic oddness . Raymond entreated his wife to atone for her involuntary legereté by submitting with a good grace to the usages of her adopted country ; and he seemed to regard the remaining months of the summer as hardly long enough for this act of expiation . As Undine looked back on them , they appeared to have been composed of an interminable succession of identical days , in which attendance at early mass ( in the coroneted gallery she had once so glowingly depicted to Van Degen ) was followed by a great deal of conversational sitting about , a great deal of excellent eating , an occasional drive to the nearest town behind a pair of heavy draft horses , and long evenings in a lamp - heated drawing - room with all the windows shut , and the stout cure making an asthmatic fourth at the Marquise 's card - table . Still , even these conditions were not permanent , and the discipline of the last years had trained Undine to wait and dissemble . The summer over , it was decided -- after a protracted family conclave -- that the state of the old Marquise 's health made it advisable for her to spend the winter with the married daughter who lived near Pau . The other members of the family returned to their respective estates , and Undine once more found herself alone with her husband . But she knew by this time that there was to be no thought of Paris that winter , or even the next spring . Worse still , she was presently to discover that Raymond 's accession of rank brought with it no financial advantages . Having but the vaguest notion of French testamentary law , she was dismayed to learn that the compulsory division of property made it impossible for a father to benefit his eldest son at the expense of the others . Raymond was therefore little richer than before , and with the debts of honour of a troublesome younger brother to settle , and Saint Desert to keep up , his available income was actually reduced . He held out , indeed , the hope of eventual improvement , since the old Marquis had managed his estates with a lofty contempt for modern methods , and the application of new principles of agriculture and forestry were certain to yield profitable results . But for a year or two , at any rate , this very change of treatment would necessitate the owner 's continual supervision , and would not in the meanwhile produce any increase of income . To faire valoir the family acres had always , it appeared , been Raymond 's deepest - seated purpose , and all his frivolities dropped from him with the prospect of putting his hand to the plough . He was not , indeed , inhuman enough to condemn his wife to perpetual exile . He meant , he assured her , that she should have her annual spring visit to Paris -- but he stared in dismay at her suggestion that they should take possession of the coveted premier of the Hotel de Chelles . He was gallant enough to express the wish that it were in his power to house her on such a scale ; but he could not conceal his surprise that she had ever seriously expected it . She was beginning to see that he felt her constitutional inability to understand anything about money as the deepest difference between them . It was a proficiency no one had ever expected her to acquire , and the lack of which she had even been encouraged to regard as a grace and to use as a pretext . During the interval between her divorce and her remarriage she had learned what things cost , but not how to do without them ; and money still seemed to her like some mysterious and uncertain stream which occasionally vanished underground but was sure to bubble up again at one 's feet . Now , however , she found herself in a world where it represented not the means of individual gratification but the substance binding together whole groups of interests , and where the uses to which it might be put in twenty years were considered before the reasons for spending it on the spot . At first she was sure she could laugh Raymond out of his prudence or coax him round to her point of view . She did not understand how a man so romantically in love could be so unpersuadable on certain points . Hitherto she had had to contend with personal moods , now she was arguing against a policy ; and she was gradually to learn that it was as natural to Raymond de Chelles to adore her and resist her as it had been to Ralph Marvell to adore her and let her have her way . At first , indeed , he appealed to her good sense , using arguments evidently drawn from accumulations of hereditary experience . But his economic plea was as unintelligible to her as the silly problems about pen - knives and apples in the "
139670	139705	137824	137824	you	4259	" of her infancy ; and when he struck a tenderer note and spoke of the duty of providing for the son he hoped for , she put her arms about him to whisper : "
139715	140142	140224	140224	you	2993	" After that , she noticed , though he was as charming as ever , he behaved as if the case were closed . He had apparently decided that his arguments were unintelligible to her , and under all his ardour she felt the difference made by the discovery . It did not make him less kind , but it evidently made her less important ; and she had the half - frightened sense that the day she ceased to please him she would cease to exist for him . That day was a long way off , of course , but the chill of it had brushed her face ; and she was no longer heedless of such signs . She resolved to cultivate all the arts of patience and compliance , and habit might have helped them to take root if they had not been nipped by a new cataclysm . It was barely a week ago that her husband had been called to Paris to straighten out a fresh tangle in the affairs of the troublesome brother whose difficulties were apparently a part of the family tradition . Raymond 's letters had been hurried , his telegrams brief and contradictory , and now , as Undine stood watching for the brougham that was to bring him from the station , she had the sense that with his arrival all her vague fears would be confirmed . There would be more money to pay out , of course -- since the funds that could not be found for her just needs were apparently always forthcoming to settle Hubert 's scandalous prodigalities -- and that meant a longer perspective of solitude at Saint Desert , and a fresh pretext for postponing the hospitalities that were to follow on their period of mourning . The brougham -- a vehicle as massive and lumbering as the pair that drew it -- presently rolled into the court , and Raymond 's sable figure ( she had never before seen a man travel in such black clothes ) sprang up the steps to the door . Whenever Undine saw him after an absence she had a curious sense of his coming back from unknown distances and not belonging to her or to any state of things she understood . Then habit reasserted itself , and she began to think of him again with a querulous familiarity . But she had learned to hide her feelings , and as he came in she put up her face for a kiss . "

When Abner Spragg came out to Opake after us and pulled you back I was pretty sore at your deserting ; but I came to see it was natural enough . You were only a spoilt girl , used to having everything you wanted ; and I could n't give you a thing then , and the folks you 'd been taught to believe in all told you I never would . Well , I did look like a back number , and no blame to you for thinking so .

It was just six months ago yesterday that the present Mrs. Moffatt came to Reno to look for her divorce . Owing to a delayed train , her counsel was late yesterday in receiving some necessary papers , and it was feared the decision would have to be held over ; but Judge Toomey , who is a personal friend of Mr. Moffatt 's , held a night session and rushed it through so that the happy couple could have the knot tied and board their special in time for Mrs. Moffatt to spend Thanksgiving in New York with her aged parents . The hearing began at seven ten p. m. and at eight o'clock the bridal couple were steaming out of the station . "

In the dazzling description of his mother 's latest nuptials one fact alone stood out for him -- that she had said things that were n't true of his French father . Something he had half - guessed in her , and averted his frightened thoughts from , took his little heart in an iron grasp . She said things that were n't true .... That was what he had always feared to find out .... She had got up and said before a lot of people things that were awfully false about his dear French father .... The sound of a motor turning in at the gates made Mrs. Heeny exclaim "

165922	166001	166048	166048	Mercy	205	" and roused himself to run downstairs . As he reached the landing he saw that the ballroom doors were open and all the lustres lit . His mother and Mr. Moffatt stood in the middle of the shining floor , looking up at the walls ; and Paul 's heart gave a wondering bound , for there , set in great gilt panels , were the tapestries that had always hung in the gallery at Saint Desert .

166159	166196	166197	166197	I	0	" she said with a tinge of disappointment . Mr. Moffatt gave a slight laugh and walked slowly down the room , as if to study its effect . As he turned back his wife said : "

166306	166324	166327	166327	you	292	" She freed her hand , and as she turned to go Paul heard Mr. Moffatt say : "
166338	166399	166411	166411	you	292	" She made no answer , but sailed through the door with her head high , as she did when anything annoyed her ; and Paul and his step - father stood alone in the illuminated ball - room . Mr. Moffatt smiled good - naturedly at the little boy and then turned back to the contemplation of the hangings . "
166413	166422	166411	166411	you	292	" he asked in a tone of satisfaction . "
166427	166455	166469	166469	you	292	" Paul answered eagerly , with a hope he dared not utter that , since the tapestries were there , his French father might be coming too . "

He had n't , hitherto , actually disliked Mr. Moffatt , who was always in a good humour , and seemed less busy and absent - minded than his mother ; but at that instant he felt a rage of hate for him . He turned away and burst into tears . "
166605	166655	166678	166678	you	2774	" Mr. Moffatt was on his knees beside the boy , and the arms embracing him were firm and friendly . But Paul , for the life of him , could n't answer : he could only sob and sob as the great surges of loneliness broke over him . "
166687	166709	167644	167644	I	0	" Mr. Moffatt continued , getting to his feet . He stood looking down at the boy with a queer smile . "
166776	167641	167644	167644	I	0	" The lamps were lit , the vases full of flowers , the foot - men assembled on the landing and in the vestibule below , when Undine descended to the drawing - room . As she passed the ballroom door she glanced in approvingly at the tapestries . They really looked better than she had been willing to admit : they made her ballroom the handsomest in Paris . But something had put her out on the way up from Deauville , and the simplest way of easing her nerves had been to affect indifference to the tapestries . Now she had quite recovered her good humour , and as she glanced down the list of guests she was awaiting she said to herself , with a sigh of satisfaction , that she was glad she had put on her rubies . For the first time since her marriage to Moffatt she was about to receive in her house the people she most wished to see there . The beginnings had been a little difficult ; their first attempt in New York was so unpromising that she feared they might not be able to live down the sensational details of their reunion , and had insisted on her husband 's taking her back to Paris . But her apprehensions were unfounded . It was only necessary to give people the time to pretend they had forgotten ; and already they were all pretending beautifully . The French world had of course held out longest ; it had strongholds she might never capture . But already seceders were beginning to show themselves , and her dinner - list that evening was graced with the names of an authentic Duke and a not too - damaged Countess . In addition , of course , she had the Shallums , the Chauncey Ellings , May Beringer , Dicky Bowles , Walsingham Popple , and the rest of the New York frequenters of the Nouveau Luxe ; she had even , at the last minute , had the amusement of adding Peter Van Degen to their number . In the evening there were to be Spanish dancing and Russian singing ; and Dicky Bowles had promised her a Grand Duke for her next dinner , if she could secure the new tenor who always refused to sing in private houses . Even now , however , she was not always happy . She had everything she wanted , but she still felt , at times , that there were other things she might want if she knew about them . And there had been moments lately when she had had to confess to herself that Moffatt did not fit into the picture . At first she had been dazzled by his success and subdued by his authority . He had given her all she had ever wished for , and more than she had ever dreamed of having : he had made up to her for all her failures and blunders , and there were hours when she still felt his dominion and exulted in it . But there were others when she saw his defects and was irritated by them : when his loudness and redness , his misplaced joviality , his familiarity with the servants , his alternating swagger and ceremony with her friends , jarred on perceptions that had developed in her unawares . Now and then she caught herself thinking that his two predecessors -- who were gradually becoming merged in her memory -- would have said this or that differently , behaved otherwise in such and such a case . And the comparison was almost always to Moffatt 's disadvantage . This evening , however , she thought of him indulgently . She was pleased with his clever stroke in capturing the Saint Desert tapestries , which General Arlington 's sudden bankruptcy , and a fresh gambling scandal of Hubert 's , had compelled their owner to part with . She knew that Raymond de Chelles had told the dealers he would sell his tapestries to anyone but Mr. Elmer Moffatt , or a buyer acting for him ; and it amused her to think that , thanks to Elmer 's astuteness , they were under her roof after all , and that Raymond and all his clan were by this time aware of it . These facts disposed her favourably toward her husband , and deepened the sense of well - being with which -- according to her invariable habit -- she walked up to the mirror above the mantelpiece and studied the image it reflected . She was still lost in this pleasing contemplation when her husband entered , looking stouter and redder than ever , in evening clothes that were a little too tight . His shirt front was as glossy as his baldness , and in his buttonhole he wore the red ribbon bestowed on him for waiving his claim to a Velasquez that was wanted for the Louvre . He carried a newspaper in his hand , and stood looking about the room with a complacent eye . "
