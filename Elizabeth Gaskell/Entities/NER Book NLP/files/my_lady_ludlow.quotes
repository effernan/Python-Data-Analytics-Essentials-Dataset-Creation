My coming puts him out ; he stiffens himself into an uncomfortable posture , out of respect to the cloth , and dare not take the comfort of kicking , and swearing , and scolding his wife , while I am there . I hear him , with my figurative ears , my lady , heave a sigh of relief when my back is turned , and the sermon that he thinks I ought to have kept for the pulpit , and have delivered to his neighbours ( whose case , as he fancies , it would just have fitted , as it seemed to him to be addressed to the sinful ) , is all ended , and done , for the day . I judge others as myself ; I do to them as I would be done to . That ’s Christianity , at any rate . I should hate — saving your ladyship ’s presence — to have my Lord Ludlow coming and seeing me , if I were ill . ’ Twould be a great honour , no doubt ; but I should have to put on a clean nightcap for the occasion ; and sham patience , in order to be polite , and not weary his lordship with my complaints . I should be twice as thankful to him if he would send me game , or a good fat haunch , to bring me up to that pitch of health and strength one ought to be in , to appreciate the honour of a visit from a nobleman .

For God ’s sake , my lady , speak to the gentlemen ; they will attend to you , while they only tell me to mind my own business . ”
10080	10119	10072	10072	herself	336	“ Mr. Gray ! I do not see what reason either you or I have to interfere . Mr. Harry Lathom is a sensible kind of young man , well capable of ascertaining the truth without our help — ”

10150	10280	10135	10136	My lady	336	“ I suppose this additional evidence is before the justices : men of good family , and of honour and credit , well known in the county . They naturally feel that the opinion of one of themselves must have more weight than the words of a man like Job Gregson , who bears a very indifferent character,—has been strongly suspected of poaching , coming from no one knows where , squatting on Hareman ’s Common — which , by the way , is extra - parochial , I believe ; consequently you , as a clergyman , are not responsible for what goes on there ; and , although impolitic , there might be some truth in what the magistrates said , in advising you to mind your own business,”—said
10284	10306	10307	10307	He	765	smiling,—“and they might be tempted to bid me mind mine , if I interfered , Mr. Gray : might they not ? ”
10342	10372	10341	10341	he	765	said—“It may seem presumptuous in me,—a stranger of only a few weeks ’ standing — to set up my judgment as to men ’s character against that of residents — ”
10400	10436	10390	10390	her	92	perceived,—“but I am convinced that the man is innocent of this offence,—and besides , the justices themselves allege this ridiculous custom of paying a compliment to a newly - appointed magistrate as their only reason . ”
10440	10443	10399	10399	he	765	“ ridiculous ! ”

12332	12338	12340	12341	Lady Ludlow	92	“ That is quite true , ”
12354	12373	12340	12341	Lady Ludlow	92	“ but I imagine you do not send a man to gaol on account of his bad character . ”

12427	12479	12424	12424	she	92	“ But in this case , the charge on which you committed him is for theft ; now his wife tells me he can prove he was some miles distant from Holmwood , where the robbery took place , all that afternoon ; she says you had the evidence before you . ”
12494	12542	12480	12481	Mr. Lathom	128	manner—“No such evidence was brought before me when I gave the warrant . I am not answerable for the other magistrates ’ decision , when they had more evidence before them . It was they who committed him to gaol . I am not responsible for that . ”
12678	12751	12752	12752	She	336	“ And do you mean to say , Mr. Lathom , that you do n’t consider yourself responsible for all injustice or wrong - doing that you might have prevented , and have not ? Nay , in this case the first germ of injustice was your own mistake . I wish you had been with me a little while ago , and seen the misery in that poor fellow ’s cottage . ”
12870	12914	12861	12861	her	92	“ I am sure you will not refuse , sir , to accept my bail . I offer to bail the fellow out , and to be responsible for his appearance at the sessions . What say you to that , Mr. Lathom ? ”
12915	12927	12836	12836	he	113	“ The offence of theft is not bailable , my lady . ”
12928	13013	12836	12836	he	113	“ Not in ordinary cases , I dare say . But I imagine this is an extraordinary case . The man is sent to prison out of compliment to you , and against all evidence , as far as I can learn . He will have to rot in gaol for two months , and his wife and children to starve . I , Lady Ludlow , offer to bail him out , and pledge myself for his appearance at next quarter - sessions . ”
13014	13024	12861	12861	her	92	“ It is against the law , my lady . ”
13025	13094	12836	12836	he	113	“ Bah ! Bah ! Bah ! Who makes laws ? Such as I , in the House of Lords — such as you , in the House of Commons . We , who make the laws in St. Stephen ’s , may break the mere forms of them , when we have right on our sides , on our own land , and amongst our own people . ”
13095	13112	12836	12836	he	113	“ The lord - lieutenant may take away my commission , if he heard of it . ”
13113	13196	12836	12836	he	113	“ And a very good thing for the county , Harry Lathom ; and for you too , if he did,—if you do n’t go on more wisely than you have begun . A pretty set you and your brother magistrates are to administer justice through the land ! I always said a good despotism was the best form of government ; and I am twice as much in favour of it now I see what a quorum is ! My dears ! ”
13203	13244	12836	12836	he	113	“ if it would not tire you to walk home , I would beg Mr. Lathom to take a seat in my coach , and we would drive to Henley Gaol , and have the poor man out at once . ”

13479	13607	13608	13608	she	852	answered—“I thank you , Mr. Gray . I was not aware that you were here , but I think I can understand on what errand you came . And seeing you here , recalls me to a duty I owe Mr. Lathom . Mr. Lathom , I have spoken to you pretty plainly,—forgetting , until I saw Mr. Gray , that only this very afternoon I differed from him on this very question ; taking completely , at that time , the same view of the whole subject which you have done ; thinking that the county would be well rid of such a man as Job Gregson , whether he had committed this theft or not . Mr. Gray and I did not part quite friends , ”
13615	13659	13608	13608	she	852	“ but it so happened that I saw Job Gregson ’s wife and home,—I felt that Mr. Gray had been right and I had been wrong , so , with the famous inconsistency of my sex , I came hither to scold you , ”

But to return to my Lord Bacon : ‘ Then the strawberry leaves , dying with a most excellent cordial smell . ’ Now the Hanburys can always smell this excellent cordial odour , and very delicious and refreshing it is . You see , in Lord Bacon ’s time , there had not been so many intermarriages between the court and the city as there have been since the needy days of his Majesty Charles the Second ; and altogether in the time of Queen Elizabeth , the great , old families of England were a distinct race , just as a cart - horse is one creature , and very useful in its place , and Childers or Eclipse is another creature , though both are of the same species . So the old families have gifts and powers of a different and higher class to what the other orders have . My dear , remember that you try if you can smell the scent of dying strawberry - leaves in this next autumn . You have some of Ursula Hanbury ’s blood in you , and that gives you a chance . ”

21189	21253	21186	21186	you	0	” I was really afraid now . My lady ’s blue eyes absolutely gave out light , she was so much displeased , and , moreover , perplexed . The more reason he had for affright , the more his courage rose . He must have seen,—so sharp a lad must have perceived her displeasure ; but he went on quickly and steadily . “
21323	21423	21315	21315	I	0	” and he went on with a high pitched voice , saying out very loud what , I have no doubt , were the identical words of the letter , date , signature and all : it was merely something about a deed , which required my lady ’s signature . When he had done , he stood almost as if he expected commendation for his accurate memory . My lady ’s eyes contracted till the pupils were as needle - points ; it was a way she had when much disturbed . She looked at me and said — “
21434	21544	21424	21425	Margaret Dawson	94	” And then she was silent . The lad , beginning to perceive he had given deep offence , stood stock still — as if his brave will had brought him into this presence , and impelled him to confession , and the best amends he could make , but had now deserted him , or was extinct , and left his body motionless , until some one else with word or deed made him quit the room . My lady looked again at him , and saw the frowning , dumb - foundering terror at his misdeed , and the manner in which his confession had been received . “
21549	21560	21424	21425	Margaret Dawson	94	” said she , the angry look leaving her face , “
21568	21577	21424	21425	Margaret Dawson	94	” The boy ’s lips began to quiver . “
21603	21607	21590	21590	I	0	” A pause . “
21617	21618	21590	21590	I	0	” “
21632	21668	21624	21624	I	0	” He was fairly blubbering , overcome by her evident feeling of dismay and regret , the soft repression of which was more frightening to him than any strong or violent words would have been . “
21676	21677	21624	21624	I	0	” “
21691	21692	21680	21683	Mr. Horner ’s clerk	1191	” “

21862	21885	21886	21886	You	1194	” My lady looked bewildered as to what way she could farther explain to him the laws of honour as regarded letters . “
21895	21899	21891	21891	I	0	” said she , “
21909	21957	21891	21891	I	0	” He hesitated for a moment , partly because he did not fully comprehend the question . My lady repeated it . The light of intelligence came into his eager eyes , and I could see that he was not certain if he could tell the truth . “
21979	22066	21974	21974	I	0	” My poor lady sighed : she was not prepared to begin a long way off in morals . Honour was , to her , second nature , and she had never tried to find out on what principle its laws were based . So , telling the lad that she wished to see Mr. Horner when he returned from Warwick , she dismissed him with a despondent look ; he , meanwhile , right glad to be out of the awful gentleness of her presence . “
22073	22096	21974	21974	I	0	” said she , half to herself and half to me . I could not answer , for I was puzzled myself . “
22103	22107	22109	22109	I	0	” she continued , “
22250	22251	22255	22255	he	113	” “
22261	22290	22255	22255	he	113	” I asked ; for the struggle that seemed now to have come to a crisis , had been going on for some time in a quiet way . “
22334	22335	22337	22337	your	336	” “
22340	22345	22337	22338	your ladyship	3058	” I half inquired . “
22418	22551	22553	22554	Mr. Gray	113	” I was sorry for Mr. Gray . He had been to see me several times , and had helped me to bear my illness in a better spirit than I should have done without his good advice and prayers . And I had gathered from little things he said , how much his heart was set upon this new scheme . I liked him so much , and I loved and respected my lady so well , that I could not bear them to be on the cool terms to which they were constantly getting . Yet I could do nothing but keep silence . I suppose my lady understood something of what was passing in my mind ; for , after a minute or two , she went on : — “
22586	22598	22564	22564	he	113	” she continued , lashing herself up with her own recollections , “
23027	23028	23004	23005	my grandfather	1217	” “
23035	23039	23031	23031	he	1217	” I asked . “
23104	23105	23100	23101	Mr. Gray	113	” “
23124	23137	23107	23108	your ladyship	3058	” I asked , feeling very timid as I put time question . “
23275	23286	23271	23271	I	0	” continued she , with a break in her ideas , “
23322	23323	23315	23315	I	0	” “
23329	23333	23335	23335	Clement	195	” I replied . “
23520	23573	23576	23576	her	1272	” I knew that Master Urian had been drowned at sea ; and often had I looked at the presentment of his bonny hopeful face , in his sailor ’s dress , with right hand outstretched to a ship on the sea in the distance , as if he had just said , “
23590	23623	23624	23624	I	0	” Poor Master Urian ! he went down in this very ship not a year after the picture was taken ! But now I will go back to my lady ’s story . “
23633	23653	23655	23655	they	1273	” continued she , softly , shutting her eyes , as if the better to call up the vision , “
24197	24207	24219	24220	the boy	3214	“ ‘ But you would tear your legs . ’ “
24376	24437	24356	24356	they	1293	“ All at once , from the little chapel at the corner of the large garden belonging to the Missions Etrangeres , I heard the tinkle of the little bell , announcing the elevation of the host . Down on his knees went Clement , hands crossed , eyes bent down : while Urian stood looking on in respectful thought . “
24479	24480	24464	24464	Clement	195	” “
24517	24518	24503	24509	a footman of Madame de Crequy ’s	1302	” “
24549	24550	24544	24544	Urian	160	” “
24940	24999	25025	25025	he	3081	“ The times were thick with gloom and terror . ‘ What next ? ’ was the question we asked of every one who brought us news from Paris . Where were these demons hidden when , so few years ago , we danced and feasted , and enjoyed the brilliant salons and the charming friendships of Paris ? “
25441	25444	25434	25434	he	1343	” CHAPTER V. “
25744	25826	25725	25725	she	1364	“ I sent her forwards to request permission for my entrance . In a moment I saw Clement — a tall , elegant young man , in a curious dress of coarse cloth , standing at the open door of a room , and evidently — even before he accosted me — striving to soothe the terrors of his mother inside . I went towards him , and would have taken his hand , but he bent down and kissed mine . “
25876	25932	25933	25933	He	1372	“ ‘ Clement ! Clement ! come to me ! ’ she cried ; and when he went to the bedside she turned on one side , and took his hand in both of hers , and began stroking it , and looking up in his face . I could scarce keep back my tears . “
26201	26235	26236	26236	I	0	“ The doctor was , I should think , a clever man ; but he had that kind of abrupt manner which people get who have much to do with the lower orders . “
26265	26285	26294	26294	I	0	“ ‘ It ca n’t be done , ’ said he . ‘ Any change will kill her . ’ “
26306	26339	26294	26294	I	0	“ ‘ Then I have nothing more to say , ’ said he , turning away from the carriage door , and making as though he would go back into the house . “
26386	26466	26472	26472	he	1391	“ He looked at me , then ( furtively ) at the carriage , hesitated , and then said : ‘ You do not mind expense , apparently . I suppose you are a rich lady of quality . Such folks will not stick at such trifles as the life or death of a sick woman to get their own way . I suppose I must e’en help you , for if I do n’t , another will . ’ “
26864	27007	27008	27009	My lord	3081	“ Of course , it was all right ; and neither my lord nor I could sleep for wondering how Madame de Crequy would bear her awakening . I had engaged the doctor , to whose face and voice she was accustomed , to remain with her all night : the nurse was experienced , and Clement was within call . But it was with the greatest relief that I heard from my own woman , when she brought me my chocolate , that Madame de Crequy ( Monsieur had said ) had awakened more tranquil than she had been for many days . To be sure , the whole aspect of the bed - chamber must have been more familiar to her than the miserable place where I had found her , and she must have intuitively felt herself among friends . “
27777	27789	27790	27790	He	195	“ ‘ What is it , Clement ? ’ I asked . “
27812	27951	27799	27799	he	195	“ ‘ They have guillotined my uncle ! ’ said he at last . Now , I knew that there was a Count de Crequy ; but I had always understood that the elder branch held very little communication with him ; in fact , that he was a vaurien of some kind , and rather a disgrace than otherwise to the family . So , perhaps , I was hard - hearted but I was a little surprised at this excess of emotion , till I saw that peculiar look in his eyes that many people have when there is more terror in their hearts than they dare put into words . He wanted me to understand something without his saying it ; but how could I ? I had never heard of a Mademoiselle de Crequy . “
27986	27997	28003	28003	he	1456	“ ‘ Your uncle ’s daughter ? ’ I inquired . “
28006	28031	28003	28003	he	1456	“ I did not say , ‘ your betrothed , ’ but I had no doubt of it . I was mistaken , however . “
28061	28072	28037	28037	he	1456	“ ‘ Is she in the Abbaye ? ’ asked I. “
28178	28324	28171	28171	She	1457	“ I saw what was in his mind . He was fretting and chafing to go to his cousin ’s assistance ; but the thought of his mother restrained him . I would not have kept back Urian from such on errand at such a time . How should I restrain him ? And yet , perhaps , I did wrong in not urging the chances of danger more . Still , if it was danger to him , was it not the same or even greater danger to her?—for the French spared neither age nor sex in those wicked days of terror . So I rather fell in with his wish , and encouraged him to think how best and most prudently it might be fulfilled ; never doubting , as I have said , that he and his cousin were troth - plighted . “
28460	28584	28441	28441	she	169	“ I was so astonished — I hardly knew what to say . I had spoken to Clement as if his mother ’s consent were secure ( as I had felt my own would have been if Urian had been alive to ask it ) . Of coarse , both he and I knew that his mother ’s consent must be asked and obtained , before he could leave her to go on such an undertaking ; but , somehow , my blood always rose at the sight or sound of danger ; perhaps , because my life had been so peaceful . Poor Madame de Crequy ! it was otherwise with her ; she despaired while I hoped , and Clement trusted . “
28647	28716	28717	28717	Clement	195	“ ‘ His betrothed ! ’ cried she , now at the utmost pitch of her excitement . ‘ Virginie betrothed to Clement?—no ! thank heaven , not so bad as that ! Yet it might have been . But mademoiselle scorned my son ! She would have nothing to do with him . Now is the time for him to have nothing to do with her ! ’ “
28835	28853	28804	28804	he	195	“ ‘ Mother , ’ he pleaded , ‘ withdraw your prohibition . Let me go ! ’ “
28989	29003	29012	29012	You	1494	“ ‘ It was my father ’s written wish , ’ said Clement . “
29068	29083	29054	29054	you	1494	“ ‘ Desolate ! my mother ! and the Countess Ludlow stands there ! ’ “
29213	29229	29239	29240	your mother	1508	“ ‘ Mother , I can not think of myself ; only of her . ’ “
29248	29859	29860	29860	Clement	195	“ Clement bowed low , and went out of the room instantly , as one blinded . She saw his groping movement , and , for an instant , I think her heart was touched . But she turned to me , and tried to exculpate her past violence by dilating upon her wrongs , and they certainly were many . The Count , her husband ’s younger brother , had invariably tried to make mischief between husband and wife . He had been the cleverer man of the two , and had possessed extraordinary influence over her husband . She suspected him of having instigated that clause in her husband ’s will , by which the Marquis expressed his wish for the marriage of the cousins . The Count had had some interest in the management of the De Crequy property during her son ’s minority . Indeed , I remembered then , that it was through Count de Crequy that Lord Ludlow had first heard of the apartment which we afterwards took in the Hotel de Crequy ; and then the recollection of a past feeling came distinctly out of the mist , as it were ; and I called to mind how , when we first took up our abode in the Hotel de Crequy , both Lord Ludlow and I imagined that the arrangement was displeasing to our hostess ; and how it had taken us a considerable time before we had been able to establish relations of friendship with her . Years after our visit , she began to suspect that Clement ( whom she could not forbid to visit at his uncle ’s house , considering the terms on which his father had been with his brother ; though she herself never set foot over the Count de Crequy ’s threshold ) was attaching himself to mademoiselle , his cousin ; and she made cautious inquiries as to the appearance , character , and disposition of the young lady . Mademoiselle was not handsome , they said ; but of a fine figure , and generally considered as having a very noble and attractive presence . In character she was daring and wilful ( said one set ) ; original and independent ( said another ) . She was much indulged by her father , who had given her something of a man ’s education , and selected for her intimate friend a young lady below her in rank , one of the Bureaucracie , a Mademoiselle Necker , daughter of the Minister of Finance . Mademoiselle de Crequy was thus introduced into all the free - thinking salons of Paris ; among people who were always full of plans for subverting society . ‘ And did Clement affect such people ? ’ Madame de Crequy had asked with some anxiety . No ! Monsieur de Crequy had neither eyes nor ears , nor thought for anything but his cousin , while she was by . And she ? She hardly took notice of his devotion , so evident to every one else . The proud creature ! But perhaps that was her haughty way of concealing what she felt . And so Madame de Crequy listened , and questioned , and learnt nothing decided , until one day she surprised Clement with the note in his hand , of which she remembered the stinging words so well , in which Virginie had said , in reply to a proposal Clement had sent her through her father , that ‘ When she married she married a man , not a petit - maitre . ’ “
29936	30136	29930	29930	he	195	“ Madame de Crequy and her son were among the earliest proscrits , as they were of the strongest possible royalists , and aristocrats , as it was the custom of the horrid Sansculottes to term those who adhered to the habits of expression and action in which it was their pride to have been educated . They had left Paris some weeks before they had arrived in England , and Clement ’s belief at the time of quitting the Hotel de Crequy had certainly been , that his uncle was not merely safe , but rather a popular man with the party in power . And , as all communication having relation to private individuals of a reliable kind was intercepted , Monsieur de Crequy had felt but little anxiety for his uncle and cousin , in comparison with what he did for many other friends of very different opinions in politics , until the day when he was stunned by the fatal information that even his progressive uncle was guillotined , and learnt that his cousin was imprisoned by the licence of the mob , whose rights ( as she called them ) she was always advocating . “
30505	30734	30487	30487	he	195	“ ‘ For , by George ! ’ said he , ‘ she shall hear my opinion , and not let that lad of hers kill himself by fretting . He ’s too good for that , if he had been an English lad , he would have been off to his sweetheart long before this , without saying with your leave or by your leave ; but being a Frenchman , he is all for AEneas and filial piety,—filial fiddle - sticks ! ’ ( My lord had run away to sea , when a boy , against his father ’s consent , I am sorry to say ; and , as all had ended well , and he had come back to find both his parents alive , I do not think he was ever as much aware of his fault as he might have been under other circumstances . ) ‘ No , my lady , ’ he went on , ‘ do n’t come with me . A woman can manage a man best when he has a fit of obstinacy , and a man can persuade a woman out of her tantrums , when all her own sex , the whole army of them , would fail . Allow me to go alone to my tete - a - tete with madame . ’ “
30781	30860	30763	30765	Madame de Crequy	169	“ ‘ But she is an old Cassandra , ’ said he . ‘ Do n’t let the lad be much with her ; her talk would destroy the courage of the bravest man ; she is so given over to superstition . ’ Something that she had said had touched a chord in my lord ’s nature which he inherited from his Scotch ancestors . Long afterwards , I heard what this was . Medlicott told me . “
30920	31164	31171	31171	she	1535	“ Madame had declined seeing any of us since my lord ’s stormy interview with her . She sent word that she was fatigued , and desired repose . But , of course , before Clement set off , he was bound to wish her farewell , and to ask for her blessing . In order to avoid an agitating conversation between mother and son , my lord and I resolved to be present at the interview . Clement was already in his travelling - dress , that of a Norman fisherman , which Monkshaven had , with infinite trouble , discovered in the possession of one of the emigres who thronged London , and who had made his escape from the shores of France in this disguise . Clement ’s plan was , to go down to the coast of Sussex , and get some of the fishing or smuggling boats to take him across to the French coast near Dieppe . There again he would have to change his dress . Oh , it was so well planned ! His mother was startled by his disguise ( of which we had not thought to forewarn her ) as he entered her apartment . And either that , or the being suddenly roused from the heavy slumber into which she was apt to fall when she was left alone , gave her manner an air of wildness that was almost like insanity . “
31209	31406	31171	31171	she	1535	“ ‘ Clement , make haste ! ’ said my lord , in a hurried manner , as if to interrupt madame . ‘ The time is later than I thought , and you must not miss the morning ’s tide . Bid your mother good - bye at once , and let us be off . ’ For my lord and Monkshaven were to ride with him to an inn near the shore , from whence he was to walk to his destination . My lord almost took him by the arm to pull him away ; and they were gone , and I was left alone with Madame de Crequy . When she heard the horses ’ feet , she seemed to find out the truth , as if for the first time . She set her teeth together . ‘ He has left me for her ! ’ she almost screamed . ‘ Left me for her ! ’ she kept muttering ; and then , as the wild look came back into her eyes , she said , almost with exultation , ‘ But I did not give him my blessing ! ’ ”
31410	31700	31701	31701	I	0	“ All night Madame de Crequy raved in delirium . If I could I would have sent for Clement back again . I did send off one man , but I suppose my directions were confused , or they were wrong , for he came back after my lord ’s return , on the following afternoon . By this time Madame de Crequy was quieter : she was , indeed , asleep from exhaustion when Lord Ludlow and Monkshaven came in . They were in high spirits , and their hopefulness brought me round to a less dispirited state . All had gone well : they had accompanied Clement on foot along the shore , until they had met with a lugger , which my lord had hailed in good nautical language . The captain had responded to these freemason terms by sending a boat to pick up his passenger , and by an invitation to breakfast sent through a speaking - trumpet . Monkshaven did not approve of either the meal or the company , and had returned to the inn , but my lord had gone with Clement and breakfasted on board , upon grog , biscuit , fresh - caught fish—‘the best breakfast he ever ate , ’ he said , but that was probably owing to the appetite his night ’s ride had given him . However , his good fellowship had evidently won the captain ’s heart , and Clement had set sail under the best auspices . It was agreed that I should tell all this to Madame de Crequy , if she inquired ; otherwise , it would be wiser not to renew her agitation by alluding to her son ’s journey . “
31812	31964	31802	31802	she	1537	“ In a week we heard of Clement ’s safe arrival on the French coast . He sent a letter to this effect by the captain of the smuggler , when the latter returned . We hoped to hear again ; but week after week elapsed , and there was no news of Clement . I had told Lord Ludlow , in Madame de Crequy ’s presence , as he and I had arranged , of the note I had received from her son , informing us of his landing in France . She heard , but she took no notice , and evidently began to wonder that we did not mention any further intelligence of him in the same manner before her ; and daily I began to fear that her pride would give way , and that she would supplicate for news before I had any to give her . “
32032	32141	31989	31989	Medlicott	103	“ I knew what was coming , and I trembled all the time they were doing my hair , and otherwise arranging me . I was not encouraged by my lord ’s speeches . He had heard the message , and kept declaring that he would rather be shot than have to tell her that there was no news of her son ; and yet he said , every now and then , when I was at the lowest pitch of uneasiness , that he never expected to hear again : that some day soon we should see him walking in and introducing Mademoiselle de Crequy to us . “
32154	32205	31989	31989	Medlicott	103	“ Her eyes were fixed on the door by which I entered . I went up to the bedside . She was not rouged,—she had left it off now for several days,—she no longer attempted to keep up the vain show of not feeling , and loving , and fearing . “
32224	32254	32211	32211	she	1541	“ ‘ Clement ? ’ she said at length , covering her mouth with a handkerchief the minute she had spoken , that I might not see it quiver . “
32318	32397	32398	32398	I	0	“ There was no answer . As I looked , uncertain whether to do or say more , she slowly turned herself in bed , and lay with her face to the wall ; and , as if that did not shut out the light of day and the busy , happy world enough , she put out her trembling hands , and covered her face with her handkerchief . There was no violence : hardly any sound . “
32495	32517	32470	32470	She	1541	“ I was very thankful when Medlicott came in with Madame ’s breakfast , and gave me an excuse for leaving . “
32622	32752	32610	32610	Medlicott	103	“ And so it went on,—for weeks , months — I could hardly count the time , it seemed so long . Medlicott told me she noticed a preternatural sensitiveness of ear in Madame de Crequy , induced by the habit of listening silently for the slightest unusual sound in the house . Medlicott was always a minute watcher of any one whom she cared about ; and , one day , she made me notice by a sign madame ’s acuteness of hearing , although the quick expectation was but evinced for a moment in the turn of the eye , the hushed breath — and then , when the unusual footstep turned into my lord ’s apartments , the soft quivering sigh , and the closed eyelids . “
32831	32881	32799	32799	I	0	“ The old man stood — I see him now — with his hat held before him in both his hands ; he slowly bowed till his face touched it when I came in . Such long excess of courtesy augured ill . He waited for me to speak . “
32932	32956	32964	32964	I	0	“ ‘ Yes , madame , ’ he replied , still standing with his head bent down , like a child in disgrace . “
32967	33025	32964	32964	I	0	“ ‘ It is bad . ’ For a moment I was angry at the cold tone in which my words were echoed ; but directly afterwards I saw the large , slow , heavy tears of age falling down the old man ’s cheeks , and on to the sleeves of his poor , threadbare coat . “
33204	33219	33198	33198	Flechier	177	“ ‘ Clement was dead — guillotined . Virginie was dead — guillotined . ’ “
33360	33439	33350	33350	I	0	” My lady was trying to shake off the emotion which she evidently felt in recurring to this sad history of Monsieur de Crequy ’s death . She came behind me , and arranged my pillows , and then , seeing I had been crying — for , indeed , I was weak - spirited at the time , and a little served to unloose my tears — she stooped down , and kissed my forehead , and said “
33443	33458	33440	33441	Poor child	1573	” almost as if she thanked me for feeling that old grief of hers . “
33735	33820	33821	33821	He	195	“ The old gardener was , I believe , both faithful and tried , and sheltered Clement in his garret as well as might be . Before he could stir out , it was necessary to procure a fresh disguise , and one more in character with an inhabitant of Paris than that of a Norman carter was procured ; and after waiting indoors for one or two days , to see if any suspicion was excited , Clement set off to discover Virginie . “
33874	34188	33869	33869	Jaques	180	“ I have seen a miniature of Virginie , which a French lady of quality happened to have in her possession at the time of her flight from Paris , and which she brought with her to England unwittingly ; for it belonged to the Count de Crequy , with whom she was slightly acquainted . I should fancy from it , that Virginie was taller and of a more powerful figure for a woman than her cousin Clement was for a man . Her dark - brown hair was arranged in short curls — the way of dressing the hair announced the politics of the individual , in those days , just as patches did in my grandmother ’s time ; and Virginie ’s hair was not to my taste , or according to my principles : it was too classical . Her large , black eyes looked out at you steadily . One can not judge of the shape of a nose from a full - face miniature , but the nostrils were clearly cut and largely opened . I do not fancy her nose could have been pretty ; but her mouth had a character all its own , and which would , I think , have redeemed a plainer face . It was wide , and deep set into the cheeks at the corners ; the upper lip was very much arched , and hardly closed over the teeth ; so that the whole face looked ( from the serious , intent look in the eyes , and the sweet intelligence of the mouth ) as if she were listening eagerly to something to which her answer was quite ready , and would come out of those red , opening lips as soon as ever you had done speaking , and you longed to know what she would say . “
35175	35254	35173	35173	himself	182	“ It must have required some patience and much diplomacy , before Clement de Crequy found out the exact place where his cousin was hidden . The old gardener took the cause very much to heart ; as , judging from my recollections , I imagine he would have forwarded any fancy , however wild , of Monsieur Clement ’s . ( I will tell you afterwards how I came to know all these particulars so well . ) “
35425	35626	35402	35402	he	195	“ At night he came home,—having seen mademoiselle . He told Clement much of the story relating to Madame Babette that I have told to you . Of course , he had heard nothing of the ambitious hopes of Morin Fils,—hardly of his existence , I should think . Madame Babette had received him kindly ; although , for some time , she had kept him standing in the carriage gateway outside her door . But , on his complaining of the draught and his rheumatism , she had asked him in : first looking round with some anxiety , to see who was in the room behind her . No one was there when he entered and sat down . But , in a minute or two , a tall , thin young lady , with great , sad eyes , and pale cheeks , came from the inner room , and , seeing him , retired . ‘ It is Mademoiselle Cannes , ’ said Madame Babette , rather unnecessarily ; for , if he had not been on the watch for some sign of Mademoiselle de Crequy , he would hardly have noticed the entrance and withdrawal . “
36257	36541	36239	36240	Mademoiselle Cannes	188	“ Pierre was afraid that the Norman had some view upon the money which his mother , as concierge , collected for her brother . But the money was all safe next evening , when his cousin , Monsieur Morin Fils , came to collect it . Madame Babette asked her nephew to sit down , and skilfully barred the passage to the inner door , so that Virginie , had she been ever so much disposed , could not have retreated . She sat silently sewing . All at once the little party were startled by a very sweet tenor voice , just close to the street window , singing one of the airs out of Beaumarchais ’ operas , which , a few years before , had been popular all over Paris . But after a few moments of silence , and one or two remarks , the talking went on again . Pierre , however , noticed an increased air of abstraction in Virginie , who , I suppose , was recurring to the last time that she had heard the song , and did not consider , as her cousin had hoped she would have done , what were the words set to the air , which he imagined she would remember , and which would have told her so much . For , only a few years before , Adam ’s opera of Richard le Roi had made the story of the minstrel Blondel and our English Coeur de Lion familiar to all the opera - going part of the Parisian public , and Clement had bethought him of establishing a communication with Virginie by some such means . “
36782	36965	36756	36757	The Norman	1726	“ ‘ Take care , ’ said he , clearly and distinctly ; ‘ take care , my little friend , lest you become a fop ; and , in that case , some day , years hence , when your heart is devoted to some young lady , she may be inclined to say to you’—here he raised his voice—‘No , thank you ; when I marry , I marry a man , not a petit - maitre ; I marry a man , who , whatever his position may be , will add dignity to the human race by his virtues . ’ Farther than that in his quotation Clement dared not go . His sentiments ( so much above the apparent occasion ) met with applause from Pierre , who liked to contemplate himself in the light of a lover , even though it should be a rejected one , and who hailed the mention of the words ‘ virtues ’ and ‘ dignity of the human race ’ as belonging to the ca nt of a good citizen . “
37052	37086	37040	37040	he	195	“ ‘ Here is our opera - singer ! ’ exclaimed Madame Babette . ‘ Why , the Norman grazier sings like Boupre , ’ naming a favourite singer at the neighbouring theatre . “
37127	37234	37254	37254	her	179	“ However , the next morning , to the wonder of both mother and son , Mademoiselle Cannes proposed , with much hesitation , to go out and make some little purchase for herself . A month or two ago , this was what Madame Babette had been never weary of urging . But now she was as much surprised as if she had expected Virginie to remain a prisoner in her rooms all the rest of her life . I suppose she had hoped that her first time of quitting it would be when she left it for Monsieur Morin ’s house as his wife . “
37460	37464	37445	37445	her	168	” CHAPTER VII . “
37622	37985	37987	37987	he	1770	“ For when the younger Morin called at the porter ’s lodge , on the evening of the day when Virginie had gone out for the first time after so many months ’ confinement to the conciergerie , he was struck with the improvement in her appearance . It seems to have hardly been that he thought her beauty greater : for , in addition to the fact that she was not beautiful , Morin had arrived at that point of being enamoured when it does not signify whether the beloved one is plain or handsome — she has enchanted one pair of eyes , which henceforward see her through their own medium . But Morin noticed the faint increase of colour and light in her countenance . It was as though she had broken through her thick cloud of hopeless sorrow , and was dawning forth into a happier life . And so , whereas during her grief , he had revered and respected it even to a point of silent sympathy , now that she was gladdened , his heart rose on the wings of strengthened hopes . Even in the dreary monotony of this existence in his Aunt Babette ’s conciergerie , Time had not failed in his work , and now , perhaps , soon he might humbly strive to help Time . The very next day he returned — on some pretence of business — to the Hotel Duguesclin , and made his aunt ’s room , rather than his aunt herself , a present of roses and geraniums tied up in a bouquet with a tricolor ribbon . Virginie was in the room , sitting at the coarse sewing she liked to do for Madame Babette . He saw her eyes brighten at the sight of the flowers : she asked his aunt to let her arrange them ; he saw her untie the ribbon , and with a gesture of dislike , throw it on the ground , and give it a kick with her little foot , and even in this girlish manner of insulting his dearest prejudices , he found something to admire . “
38093	38111	38117	38118	Monsieur Morin	181	“ ‘ Chut ! ’ said Pierre , at last . ‘ She goes out walking . ’ “
38142	38156	38117	38118	Monsieur Morin	181	“ ‘ Well ! It is not well . It is bad . ’ “
38190	38252	38255	38255	my	0	“ ‘ No , no ! ’ said Pierre . ‘ But she goes out walking . She has gone these two mornings . I have watched her . She meets a man — she is friends with him , for she talks to him as eagerly as he does to her — mamma can not tell who he is . ’ “
38261	38360	38255	38255	my	0	“ ‘ No , not so much as a fly ’s wing of him . I myself have only seen his back . It strikes me like a familiar back , and yet I can not think who it is . But they separate with sudden darts , like two birds who have been together to feed their young ones . One moment they are in close talk , their heads together chuchotting ; the next he has turned up some bye - street , and Mademoiselle Cannes is close upon me — has almost caught me . ’ “
38496	38686	38695	38695	she	1782	“ Pierre returned home with a light heart , tossing up his five - franc piece as he ran . Just as he was at the conciergerie door , a great tall man bustled past him , and snatched his money away from him , looking back with a laugh , which added insult to injury . Pierre had no redress ; no one had witnessed the impudent theft , and if they had , no one to be seen in the street was strong enough to give him redress . Besides , Pierre had seen enough of the state of the streets of Paris at that time to know that friends , not enemies , were required , and the man had a bad air about him . But all these considerations did not keep Pierre from bursting out into a fit of crying when he was once more under his mother ’s roof ; and Virginie , who was alone there ( Madame Babette having gone out to make her daily purchases ) , might have imagined him pommeled to death by the loudness of his sobs . “
38709	38729	38695	38695	she	1782	“ ‘ He has robbed me ! he has robbed me ! ’ was all Pierre could gulp out . “
38751	38833	38744	38744	Virginie	195	“ ‘ Of my five - franc piece — of a five - franc piece , ’ said Pierre , correcting himself , and leaving out the word my , half fearful lest Virginie should inquire how he became possessed of such a sum , and for what services it had been given him . But , of course , no such idea came into her head , for it would have been impertinent , and she was gentle - born . “
38940	38965	38973	38973	she	0	“ ‘ But I can not , ’ said the boy , hesitating ; some dim sense of honour flitting through his misty morals . “
39006	39327	38973	38973	she	0	“ Thus tempted by her urgency , and , I suppose , reasoning with himself to the effect that he might as well have the money , and then see whether he thought it right to act as a spy upon her or not — the one action did not pledge him to the other , nor yet did she make any conditions with her gift — Pierre went off with her ring ; and , after repaying himself his five francs , he was enabled to bring Virginie back two more , so well had he managed his affairs . But , although the whole transaction did not leave him bound , in any way , to discover or forward Virginie ’s wishes , it did leave him pledged , according to his code , to act according to her advantage , and he considered himself the judge of the best course to be pursued to this end . And , moreover , this little kindness attached him to her personally . He began to think how pleasant it would be to have so kind and generous a person for a relation ; how easily his troubles might be borne if he had always such a ready helper at hand ; how much he should like to make her like him , and come to him for the protection of his masculine power ! First of all his duties , as her self - appointed squire , came the necessity of finding out who her strange new acquaintance was . Thus , you see , he arrived at the same end , via supposed duty , that he was previously pledged to via interest . I fancy a good number of us , when any line of action will promote our own interest , can make ourselves believe that reasons exist which compel us to it as a duty . “
39681	39971	39974	39974	he	1801	“ When Pierre had told Morin of his discovery , Morin sat down , as I said , quite suddenly , as if he had been shot . He found out that the first meeting between the Norman and Virginie was no accidental , isolated circumstance . Pierre was torturing him with his accounts of daily rendezvous : if but for a moment , they were seeing each other every day , sometimes twice a day . And Virginie could speak to this man , though to himself she was coy and reserved as hardly to utter a sentence . Pierre caught these broken words while his cousin ’s complexion grew more and more livid , and then purple , as if some great effect were produced on his circulation by the news he had just heard . Pierre was so startled by his cousin ’s wandering , senseless eyes , and otherwise disordered looks , that he rushed into a neighbouring cabaret for a glass of absinthe , which he paid for , as he recollected afterwards , with a portion of Virginie ’s five francs . By - and - by Morin recovered his natural appearance ; but he was gloomy and silent ; and all that Pierre could get out of him was , that the Norman farmer should not sleep another night at the Hotel Duguesclin , giving him such opportunities of passing and repassing by the conciergerie door . He was too much absorbed in his own thoughts to repay Pierre the half franc he had spent on the absinthe , which Pierre perceived , and seems to have noted down in the ledger of his mind as on Virginie ’s balance of favour . “
40126	40574	40575	40575	He	1810	“ In a few days , however , Pierre felt almost sure that they had established some new means of communication . Virginie went out for a short time every day ; but though Pierre followed her as closely as he could without exciting her observation , he was unable to discover what kind of intercourse she held with the Norman . She went , in general , the same short round among the little shops in the neighbourhood ; not entering any , but stopping at two or three . Pierre afterwards remembered that she had invariably paused at the nosegays displayed in a certain window , and studied them long : but , then , she stopped and looked at caps , hats , fashions , confectionery ( all of the humble kind common in that quarter ) , so how should he have known that any particular attraction existed among the flowers ? Morin came more regularly than ever to his aunt ’s ; but Virginie was apparently unconscious that she was the attraction . She looked healthier and more hopeful than she had done for months , and her manners to all were gentler and not so reserved . Almost as if she wished to manifest her gratitude to Madame Babette for her long continuance of kindness , the necessity for which was nearly ended , Virginie showed an unusual alacrity in rendering the old woman any little service in her power , and evidently tried to respond to Monsieur Morin ’s civilities , he being Madame Babette ’s nephew , with a soft graciousness which must have made one of her principal charms ; for all who knew her speak of the fascination of her manners , so winning and attentive to others , while yet her opinions , and often her actions , were of so decided a character . For , as I have said , her beauty was by no means great ; yet every man who came near her seems to have fallen into the sphere of her influence . Monsieur Morin was deeper than ever in love with her during these last few days : he was worked up into a state capable of any sacrifice , either of himself or others , so that he might obtain her at last . He sat ‘ devouring her with his eyes ’ ( to use Pierre ’s expression ) whenever she could not see him ; but , if she looked towards him , he looked to the ground — anywhere — away from her and almost stammered in his replies if she addressed any question to him . “
40666	40919	40920	40920	Pierre	195	“ But he appears to have felt that he had made but little way , and he awkwardly turned to Pierre for help — not yet confessing his love , though ; he only tried to make friends again with the lad after their silent estrangement . And Pierre for some time did not choose to perceive his cousin ’s advances . He would reply to all the roundabout questions Morin put to him respecting household conversations when he was not present , or household occupations and tone of thought , without mentioning Virginie ’s name any more than his questioner did . The lad would seem to suppose , that his cousin ’s strong interest in their domestic ways of going on was all on account of Madame Babette . At last he worked his cousin up to the point of making him a confidant : and then the boy was half frightened at the torrent of vehement words he had unloosed . The lava came down with a greater rush for having been pent up so long . Morin cried out his words in a hoarse , passionate voice , clenched his teeth , his fingers , and seemed almost convulsed , as he spoke out his terrible love for Virginie , which would lead him to kill her sooner than see her another ’s ; and if another stepped in between him and her!—and then he smiled a fierce , triumphant smile , but did not say any more . “
41127	41310	41319	41319	Virginie	195	“ A day or two afterwards , Virginie was taken ill . Madame Babette said it was because she had persevered in going out in all weathers , after confining herself to two warm rooms for so long ; and very probably this was really the cause , for , from Pierre ’s account , she must have been suffering from a feverish cold , aggravated , no doubt , by her impatience at Madame Babette ’s familiar prohibitions of any more walks until she was better . Every day , in spite of her trembling , aching limbs , she would fain have arranged her dress for her walk at the usual time ; but Madame Babette was fully prepared to put physical obstacles in her way , if she was not obedient in remaining tranquil on the little sofa by the side of the fire . The third day , she called Pierre to her , when his mother was not attending ( having , in fact , locked up Mademoiselle Cannes ’ out - of - door things ) . “
41455	42010	42011	42011	Pierre	195	“ Sure enough , there was a drooping nosegay of pinks in the window . Pierre went in , and , with all his impatience , he made as good a bargain as he could , urging that the flowers were faded , and good for nothing . At last he purchased them at a very moderate price . And now you will learn the bad consequences of teaching the lower orders anything beyond what is immediately necessary to enable them to earn their daily bread ! The silly Count de Crequy,—he who had been sent to his bloody rest , by the very canaille of whom he thought so much,—he who had made Virginie ( indirectly , it is true ) reject such a man as her cousin Clement , by inflating her mind with his bubbles of theories,—this Count de Crequy had long ago taken a fancy to Pierre , as he saw the bright sharp child playing about his court — Monsieur de Crequy had even begun to educate the boy himself to try work out certain opinions of his into practice,—but the drudgery of the affair wearied him , and , beside , Babette had left his employment . Still the Count took a kind of interest in his former pupil ; and made some sort of arrangement by which Pierre was to be taught reading and writing , and accounts , and Heaven knows what besides,—Latin , I dare say . So Pierre , instead of being an innocent messenger , as he ought to have been—(as Mr. Horner ’s little lad Gregson ought to have been this morning)—could read writing as well as either you or I. So what does he do , on obtaining the nosegay , but examine it well . The stalks of the flowers were tied up with slips of matting in wet moss . Pierre undid the strings , unwrapped the moss , and out fell a piece of wet paper , with the writing all blurred with moisture . It was but a torn piece of writing - paper , apparently , but Pierre ’s wicked mischievous eyes read what was written on it,—written so as to look like a fragment,—‘Ready , every and any night at nine . All is prepared . Have no fright . Trust one who , whatever hopes he might once have had , is content now to serve you as a faithful cousin ; ’ and a place was named , which I forget , but which Pierre did not , as it was evidently the rendezvous . After the lad had studied every word , till he could say it off by heart , he placed the paper where he had found it , enveloped it in moss , and tied the whole up again carefully . Virginie ’s face coloured scarlet as she received it . She kept smelling at it , and trembling : but she did not untie it , although Pierre suggested how much fresher it would be if the stalks were immediately put into water . But once , after his back had been turned for a minute , he saw it untied when he looked round again , and Virginie was blushing , and hiding something in her bosom . “
42290	42301	42256	42256	he	195	“ ‘ My Aunt Babette is out of coffee . ’ “
42315	42397	42313	42313	Pierre	195	“ ‘ Yes , she is . I heard her say so . Tell her that a friend of mine has just opened a shop in the Rue Saint Antoine , and that if she will join me there in an hour , I will supply her with a good stock of coffee , just to give my friend encouragement . His name is Antoine Meyer , Number One hundred and Fifty at the sign of the Cap of Liberty . ’ “
42483	42521	42476	42476	Morin	199	“ ‘ How could he know I was out of coffee ? ’ said she . ‘ I am ; but I only used the last up this morning . How could Victor know about it ? ’ “
42590	42622	42623	42623	Pierre	195	“ ‘ Well , it is very kind of him to offer to give me some coffee , to be sure ! But how could he know I was out ? ’ “
43752	43756	43757	43757	Pierre	195	” CHAPTER VIII . “
43878	44094	43871	43871	Morin	199	“ At length , he felt as if he could no longer sit still , awaiting the issue , but must run out and see what course events had taken . In vain his mother , half - rousing herself , called after him to ask whither he was going : he was already out of hearing before she had ended her sentence , and he ran on until , stopped by the sight of Mademoiselle Cannes walking along at so swift a pace that it was almost a run ; while at her side , resolutely keeping by her , Morin was striding abreast . Pierre had just turned the corner of the street , when he came upon them . Virginie would have passed him without recognizing him , she was in such passionate agitation , but for Morin ’s gesture , by which he would fain have kept Pierre from interrupting them . Then , when Virginie saw the lad , she caught at his arm , and thanked God , as if in that boy of twelve or fourteen she held a protector . Pierre felt her tremble from head to foot , and was afraid lest she would fall , there where she stood , in the hard rough street . “
44104	44158	44102	44102	Morin	199	“ ‘ I can not , ’ replied Pierre , who indeed was held firmly by Virginie . ‘ Besides , I wo n’t , ’ he added . ‘ Who has been frightening mademoiselle in this way ? ’ asked he , very much inclined to brave his cousin at all hazards . “
44231	44259	44271	44271	Morin	199	“ Virginie did not speak . Pierre doubted if she heard a word of what they were saying . She leant upon him more and more heavily . “
44580	44781	44555	44555	her	188	“ At any rate , Pierre saw that his cousin was deeply mortified by the whole tenor of his behaviour during their walk home . When they arrived at Madame Babette ’s , Virginie fell fainting on the floor ; her strength had but just sufficed for this exertion of reaching the shelter of the house . Her first sign of restoring consciousness consisted in avoidance of Morin . He had been most assiduous in his efforts to bring her round ; quite tender in his way , Pierre said ; and this marked , instinctive repugnance to him evidently gave him extreme pain . I suppose Frenchmen are more demonstrative than we are ; for Pierre declared that he saw his cousin ’s eyes fill with tears , as she shrank away from his touch , if he tried to arrange the shawl they had laid under her head like a pillow , or as she shut her eyes when he passed before her . Madame Babette was urgent with her to go and lie down on the bed in the inner room ; but it was some time before she was strong enough to rise and do this . “
44891	44901	44913	44913	she	179	“ ‘ It is hard ! ’ he said . “
44938	45102	44913	44913	she	179	“ ‘ It is hard for a man to love a woman as I do , ’ he went on—‘I did not seek to love her , it came upon me before I was aware — before I had ever thought about it at all , I loved her better than all the world beside . All my life , before I knew her , seems a dull blank . I neither know nor care for what I did before then . And now there are just two lives before me . Either I have her , or I have not . That is all : but that is everything . And what can I do to make her have me ? Tell me , aunt , ’ and he caught at Madame Babette ’s arm , and gave it so sharp a shake , that she half screamed out , Pierre said , and evidently grew alarmed at her nephew ’s excitement . “
45130	45271	45278	45278	she	0	“ ‘ None other for me , ’ he said , sinking back as if hopeless . ‘ I am plain and coarse , not one of the scented darlings of the aristocrats . Say that I am ugly , brutish ; I did not make myself so , any more than I made myself love her . It is my fate . But am I to submit to the consequences of my fate without a struggle ? Not I. As strong as my love is , so strong is my will . It can be no stronger , ’ continued he , gloomily . ‘ Aunt Babette , you must help me — you must make her love me . ’ He was so fierce here , that Pierre said he did not wonder that his mother was frightened . “
45433	45439	45424	45424	your	201	“ ‘ I would change my “
45442	45449	45424	45424	your	201	” as you call them . ’ “
45457	45547	45454	45454	Victor	201	“ ‘ No , I will not be reasonable , if by that you mean giving her up . I tell you two lives are before me ; one with her , one without her . But the latter will be but a short career for both of us . You said , aunt , that the talk went in the conciergerie of her father ’s hotel , that she would have nothing to do with this cousin whom I put out of the way to - day ? ’ “
45589	45679	45706	45706	he	195	“ ‘ So much the better for him . He suffers now for having come between me and my object — in trying to snatch her away out of my sight . Take you warning , Pierre ! I did not like your meddling to - night . ’ And so he went off , leaving Madam Babette rocking herself backwards and forwards , in all the depression of spirits consequent upon the reaction after the brandy , and upon her knowledge of her nephew ’s threatened purpose combined . “
45756	47348	45738	45738	she	179	“ And now I must take up the story as it was told to the Intendant Flechier by the old gardener Jacques , with whom Clement had been lodging on his first arrival in Paris . The old man could not , I dare say , remember half as much of what had happened as Pierre did ; the former had the dulled memory of age , while Pierre had evidently thought over the whole series of events as a story — as a play , if one may call it so — during the solitary hours in his after - life , wherever they were passed , whether in lonely camp watches , or in the foreign prison , where he had to drag out many years . Clement had , as I said , returned to the gardener ’s garret after he had been dismissed from the Hotel Duguesclin . There were several reasons for his thus doubling back . One was , that he put nearly the whole breadth of Paris between him and an enemy ; though why Morin was an enemy , and to what extent he carried his dislike or hatred , Clement could not tell , of course . The next reason for returning to Jacques was , no doubt , the conviction that , in multiplying his residences , he multiplied the chances against his being suspected and recognized . And then , again , the old man was in his secret , and his ally , although perhaps but a feeble kind of one . It was through Jacques that the plan of communication , by means of a nosegay of pinks , had been devised ; and it was Jacques who procured him the last disguise that Clement was to use in Paris — as he hoped and trusted . It was that of a respectable shopkeeper of no particular class ; a dress that would have seemed perfectly suitable to the young man who would naturally have worn it ; and yet , as Clement put it on , and adjusted it — giving it a sort of finish and elegance which I always noticed about his appearance and which I believed was innate in the wearer — I have no doubt it seemed like the usual apparel of a gentleman . No coarseness of texture , nor clumsiness of cut could disguise the nobleman of thirty descents , it appeared ; for immediately on arriving at the place of rendezvous , he was recognized by the men placed there on Morin ’s information to seize him . Jacques , following at a little distance , with a bundle under his arm containing articles of feminine disguise for Virginie , saw four men attempt Clement ’s arrest — saw him , quick as lightning , draw a sword hitherto concealed in a clumsy stick — saw his agile figure spring to his guard,—and saw him defend himself with the rapidity and art of a man skilled in arms . But what good did it do ? as Jacques piteously used to ask , Monsieur Flechier told me . A great blow from a heavy club on the sword - arm of Monsieur de Crequy laid it helpless and immovable by his side . Jacques always thought that that blow came from one of the spectators , who by this time had collected round the scene of the affray . The next instant , his master — his little marquis — was down among the feet of the crowd , and though he was up again before he had received much damage — so active and light was my poor Clement — it was not before the old gardener had hobbled forwards , and , with many an old - fashioned oath and curse , proclaimed himself a partisan of the losing side — a follower of a ci - devant aristocrat . It was quite enough . He received one or two good blows , which were , in fact , aimed at his master ; and then , almost before he was aware , he found his arms pinioned behind him with a woman ’s garter , which one of the viragos in the crowd had made no scruple of pulling off in public , as soon as she heard for what purpose it was wanted . Poor Jacques was stunned and unhappy,—his master was out of sight , on before ; and the old gardener scarce knew whither they were taking him . His head ached from the blows which had fallen upon it ; it was growing dark — June day though it was,—and when first he seems to have become exactly aware of what had happened to him , it was when he was turned into one of the larger rooms of the Abbaye , in which all were put who had no other allotted place wherein to sleep . One or two iron lamps hung from the ceiling by chains , giving a dim light for a little circle . Jacques stumbled forwards over a sleeping body lying on the ground . The sleeper wakened up enough to complain ; and the apology of the old man in reply caught the ear of his master , who , until this time , could hardly have been aware of the straits and difficulties of his faithful Jacques . And there they sat,—against a pillar , the live - long night , holding one another ’s hands , and each restraining expressions of pain , for fear of adding to the other ’s distress . That night made them intimate friends , in spite of the difference of age and rank . The disappointed hopes , the acute suffering of the present , the apprehensions of the future , made them seek solace in talking of the past . Monsieur de Crequy and the gardener found themselves disputing with interest in which chimney of the stack the starling used to build,—the starling whose nest Clement sent to Urian , you remember , and discussing the merits of different espalier - pears which grew , and may grow still , in the old garden of the Hotel de Crequy . Towards morning both fell asleep . The old man wakened first . His frame was deadened to suffering , I suppose , for he felt relieved of his pain ; but Clement moaned and cried in feverish slumber . His broken arm was beginning to inflame his blood . He was , besides , much injured by some kicks from the crowd as he fell . As the old man looked sadly on the white , baked lips , and the flushed cheeks , contorted with suffering even in his sleep , Clement gave a sharp cry which disturbed his miserable neighbours , all slumbering around in uneasy attitudes . They bade him with curses be silent ; and then turning round , tried again to forget their own misery in sleep . For you see , the bloodthirsty canaille had not been sated with guillotining and hanging all the nobility they could find , but were now informing , right and left , even against each other ; and when Clement and Jacques were in the prison , there were few of gentle blood in the place , and fewer still of gentle manners . At the sound of the angry words and threats , Jacques thought it best to awaken his master from his feverish uncomfortable sleep , lest he should provoke more enmity ; and , tenderly lifting him up , he tried to adjust his own body , so that it should serve as a rest and a pillow for the younger man . The motion aroused Clement , and he began to talk in a strange , feverish way , of Virginie , too,—whose name he would not have breathed in such a place had he been quite himself . But Jacques had as much delicacy of feeling as any lady in the land , although , mind you , he knew neither how to read nor write,—and bent his head low down , so that his master might tell him in a whisper what messages he was to take to Mademoiselle de Crequy , in case — Poor Clement , he knew it must come to that ! No escape for him now , in Norman disguise or otherwise ! Either by gathering fever or guillotine , death was sure of his prey . Well ! when that happened , Jacques was to go and find Mademoiselle de Crequy , and tell her that her cousin loved her at the last as he had loved her at the first ; but that she should never have heard another word of his attachment from his living lips ; that he knew he was not good enough for her , his queen ; and that no thought of earning her love by his devotion had prompted his return to France , only that , if possible , he might have the great privilege of serving her whom he loved . And then he went off into rambling talk about petit - maitres , and such kind of expressions , said Jacques to Flechier , the intendant , little knowing what a clue that one word gave to much of the poor lad ’s suffering . “
47476	47567	47578	47579	some one	500	“ Poor old Jacques kept falling asleep , and plucking himself up again for fear lest , if he did not attend to his master , some harm might come to the swollen , helpless arm . Yet his weariness grew upon him in spite of all his efforts , and at last he felt as if he must give way to the irresistible desire , if only for five minutes . But just then there was a bustle at the door . Jacques opened his eyes wide to look . “
47583	47604	47578	47579	some one	500	“ ‘ It is the darkness of this accursed place that makes us think it early , ’ said another . “
47738	47770	47782	47782	she	0	“ ‘ Here he is , ’ he whispered as her gown would have touched him in passing , without her perceiving him , in the heavy obscurity of the place . “
48045	48163	48023	48023	she	168	“ When Jacques awoke it was full daylight — at least as full as it would ever be in that place . His breakfast — the gaol - allowance of bread and vin ordinaire — was by his side . He must have slept soundly . He looked for his master . He and Virginie had recognized each other now,—hearts , as well as appearance . They were smiling into each other ’s faces , as if that dull , vaulted room in the grim Abbaye were the sunny gardens of Versailles , with music and festivity all abroad . Apparently they had much to say to each other ; for whispered questions and answers never ceased . “
48312	48648	48305	48305	they	1976	“ When Virginie saw that Jacques was awake , and languidly munching his breakfast , she rose from the wooden stool on which she was sitting , and went to him , holding out both hands , and refusing to allow him to rise , while she thanked him with pretty eagerness for all his kindness to Monsieur . Monsieur himself came towards him , following Virginie , but with tottering steps , as if his head was weak and dizzy , to thank the poor old man , who now on his feet , stood between them , ready to cry while they gave him credit for faithful actions which he felt to have been almost involuntary on his part,—for loyalty was like an instinct in the good old days , before your educational ca nt had come up . And so two days went on . The only event was the morning call for the victims , a certain number of whom were summoned to trial every day . And to be tried was to be condemned . Every one of the prisoners became grave , as the hour for their summons approached . Most of the victims went to their doom with uncomplaining resignation , and for a while after their departure there was comparative silence in the prison . But , by - and - by — so said Jacques — the conversation or amusements began again . Human nature can not stand the perpetual pressure of such keen anxiety , without an effort to relieve itself by thinking of something else . Jacques said that Monsieur and Mademoiselle were for ever talking together of the past days,—it was ‘ Do you remember this ? ’ or , ‘ Do you remember that ? ’ perpetually . He sometimes thought they forgot where they were , and what was before them . But Jacques did not , and every day he trembled more and more as the list was called over . “
48993	49050	48985	48985	He	208	“ ‘ Mademoiselle , ’ he said . Not the quivering of an eyelash showed that she heard him . ‘ Mademoiselle ! ’ he said again , with an intensity of beseeching that made Jacques — not knowing who he was — almost pity him , when he saw his young lady ’s obdurate face . “
49108	49123	49090	49090	he	208	“ ‘ Monsieur , do ask mademoiselle to listen to me,—just two words . ’ “
49148	49236	49139	49139	Clement	208	“ ‘ But , mademoiselle,’—lowering his voice , and coming a step or two nearer . Virginie must have felt his approach , though she did not see it ; for she drew herself a little on one side , so as to put as much space as possible between him and her.—‘Mademoiselle , it is not too late . I can save you : but to - morrow your name is down on the list . I can save you , if you will listen . ’ “
49274	49314	49315	49315	Jacques	208	“ The man withdrew a little , but did not offer to leave the prison . He never took his eyes off Virginie ; he seemed to be suffering from some acute and terrible pain as he watched her . “
49340	49529	49328	49328	Purposely	212	“ ‘ Hist ! ’ said the stranger . ‘ You are Jacques , the gardener , arrested for assisting an aristocrat . I know the gaoler . You shall escape , if you will . Only take this message from me to mademoiselle . You heard . She will not listen to me : I did not want her to come here . I never knew she was here , and she will die to - morrow . They will put her beautiful round throat under the guillotine . Tell her , good old man , tell her how sweet life is ; and how I can save her ; and how I will not ask for more than just to see her from time to time . She is so young ; and death is annihilation , you know . Why does she hate me so ? I want to save her ; I have done her no harm . Good old man , tell her how terrible death is ; and that she will die to - morrow , unless she listens to me . ’ “
49553	49619	49539	49539	Clement	208	“ ‘ Will you not try him , my cherished one ? ’ he said . ‘ Towards you he may mean well ’ ( which makes me think that Virginie had never repeated to Clement the conversation which she had overheard that last night at Madame Babette ’s ) ; ‘ you would be in no worse a situation than you were before ! ’ “
49649	49699	49645	49645	she	0	“ ‘ Ask him , ’ said she , turning to Jacques , suddenly , ‘ if he can save Monsieur de Crequy as well,—if he can?—O Clement , we might escape to England ; we are but young . ’ And she hid her face on his shoulder . “
49747	49779	49721	49721	he	208	“ He made a long pause . ‘ I will save mademoiselle and monsieur , if she will go straight from prison to the mairie , and be my wife . ’ “
49801	49812	49785	49785	Jacques	208	“ ‘ Ask her ! ’ said Morin , hoarsely . “
49831	49885	49826	49826	Clement	208	“ ‘ Begone ! ’ said he ; ‘ not one word more . ’ Virginie touched the old man as he was moving away . ‘ Tell him he does not know how he makes me welcome death . ’ And smiling , as if triumphant , she turned again to Clement . “
49958	50101	49950	49950	he	1753	“ ‘ Listen ! I have influence with the gaoler . He shall let thee pass out with the victims to - morrow . No one will notice it , or miss thee—. They will be led to trial,—even at the last moment , I will save her , if she sends me word she relents . Speak to her , as the time draws on . Life is very sweet,—tell her how sweet . Speak to him ; he will do more with her than thou canst . Let him urge her to live . Even at the last , I will be at the Palais de Justice,—at the Greve . I have followers,—I have interest . Come among the crowd that follow the victims,—I shall see thee . It will be no worse for him , if she escapes ’ — “
50117	50440	50115	50115	Jacques	208	“ ‘ Only on my one condition , ’ said Morin , doggedly ; and Jacques was hopeless of that condition ever being fulfilled . But he did not see why his own life might not be saved . By remaining in prison until the next day , he should have rendered every service in his power to his master and the young lady . He , poor fellow , shrank from death ; and he agreed with Morin to escape , if he could , by the means Morin had suggested , and to bring him word if Mademoiselle de Crequy relented . ( Jacques had no expectation that she would ; but I fancy he did not think it necessary to tell Morin of this conviction of his . ) This bargaining with so base a man for so slight a thing as life , was the only flaw that I heard of in the old gardener ’s behaviour . Of course , the mere reopening of the subject was enough to stir Virginie to displeasure . Clement urged her , it is true ; but the light he had gained upon Morin ’s motions , made him rather try to set the case before her in as fair a manner as possible than use any persuasive arguments . And , even as it was , what he said on the subject made Virginie shed tears — the first that had fallen from her since she entered the prison . So , they were summoned and went together , at the fatal call of the muster - roll of victims the next morning . He , feeble from his wounds and his injured health ; she , calm and serene , only petitioning to be allowed to walk next to him , in order that she might hold him up when he turned faint and giddy from his extreme suffering . “
50491	50646	50481	50481	they	2013	“ Jacques was free now . He had told Morin how fruitless his efforts at persuasion had been ; and scarcely caring to note the effect of his information upon the man , he had devoted himself to watching Monsieur and Mademoiselle de Crequy . And now he followed them to the Place de la Greve . He saw them mount the platform ; saw them kneel down together till plucked up by the impatient officials ; could see that she was urging some request to the executioner ; the end of which seemed to be , that Clement advanced first to the guillotine , was executed ( and just at this moment there was a stir among the crowd , as of a man pressing forward towards the scaffold ) . Then she , standing with her face to the guillotine , slowly made the sign of the cross , and knelt down . “
50718	50741	50710	50710	Pierre	195	” CHAPTER IX . After a pause , I ventured to ask what became of Madame de Crequy , Clement ’s mother . “
50750	50755	50742	50742	She	2014	” said my lady . “
51067	51068	51050	51050	she	169	” “
51078	51083	51050	51050	she	169	” I again asked . “
51090	51095	51096	51096	She	169	” replied Lady Ludlow . “
51447	51448	51443	51443	she	103	” “
51458	51466	51455	51456	your ladyship	3058	” said I , after a while . “
51662	51663	51652	51652	he	113	” “
51683	51684	51672	51673	your ladyship	3058	” “
51776	51777	51780	51781	my lady	336	” “
51788	51797	51780	51781	my lady	336	” I said , with perhaps injudicious perseverance . “
51805	51816	51817	51817	He	113	” she asked , with gentle inquiry in her tone . “
51914	52025	52027	52027	I	0	” The next day Mr. Horner came to apologize and explain . He was evidently — as I could tell from his voice , as he spoke to my lady in the next room — extremely annoyed at her ladyship ’s discovery of the education he had been giving to this boy . My lady spoke with great authority , and with reasonable grounds of complaint . Mr. Horner was well acquainted with her thoughts on the subject , and had acted in defiance of her wishes . He acknowledged as much , and should on no account have done it , in any other instance , without her leave . “
52034	52165	52027	52027	I	0	” said my lady . But this boy had extraordinary capabilities ; would , in fact , have taught himself much that was bad , if he had not been rescued , and another direction given to his powers . And in all Mr. Horner had done , he had had her ladyship ’s service in view . The business was getting almost beyond his power , so many letters and so much account - keeping was required by the complicated state in which things were . Lady Ludlow felt what was coming — a reference to the mortgage for the benefit of my lord ’s Scottish estates , which , she was perfectly aware , Mr. Horner considered as having been a most unwise proceeding — and she hastened to observe—“All
52244	52245	52246	52246	I	0	” “
52272	52283	52267	52270	a kind of clerk	2062	” said Mr. Horner , jerking out his project abruptly . “
52287	52296	52297	52302	A kind of — of assistant	2063	” asked my lady , in infinite surprise . “
52327	52328	52315	52315	He	150	” “
52332	52340	52329	52330	Mr. Horner	238	” said my lady , with dignity , “
52458	52459	52454	52456	the first comer	2072	” “
52479	52480	52460	52460	I	0	” “
52555	52612	52546	52546	you	2068	” Mr. Horner was silent . My lady was softened by his not replying , and began as she always did in such cases , to fear lest she had been too harsh . I could tell that by her voice and by her next speech , as well as if I had seen her face . “
52668	52775	52665	52665	you	2068	” Mr. Horner had certainly had a distant idea of turning the little boy , in process of time , into a clerk ; but he had rather urged this possibility of future usefulness beyond what he had at first intended , in speaking of it to my lady as a palliation of his offence , and he certainly was very much inclined to retract his statement that the letter - writing , or any other business , had increased , or that he was in the slightest want of help of any kind , when my lady after a pause of consideration , suddenly said — “
52817	52833	52834	52835	Miss Galindo	215	” I could hardly help echoing Mr. Horner ’s tone of surprise as he said — “
52837	53674	52834	52835	Miss Galindo	215	” For , you must be told who Miss Galindo was ; at least , told as much as I know . Miss Galindo had lived in the village for many years , keeping house on the smallest possible means , yet always managing to maintain a servant . And this servant was invariably chosen because she had some infirmity that made her undesirable to every one else . I believe Miss Galindo had had lame and blind and hump - backed maids . She had even at one time taken in a girl hopelessly gone in consumption , because if not she would have had to go to the workhouse , and not have had enough to eat . Of course the poor creature could not perform a single duty usually required of a servant , and Miss Galindo herself was both servant and nurse . Her present maid was scarcely four feet high , and bore a terrible character for ill - temper . Nobody but Miss Galindo would have kept her ; but , as it was , mistress and servant squabbled perpetually , and were , at heart , the best of friends . For it was one of Miss Galindo ’s peculiarities to do all manner of kind and self - denying actions , and to say all manner of provoking things . Lame , blind , deformed , and dwarf , all came in for scoldings without number : it was only the consumptive girl that never had heard a sharp word . I do n’t think any of her servants liked her the worse for her peppery temper , and passionate odd ways , for they knew her real and beautiful kindness of heart : and , besides , she had so great a turn for humour that very often her speeches amused as much or more than they irritated ; and on the other side , a piece of witty impudence from her servant would occasionally tickle her so much and so suddenly , that she would burst out laughing in the middle of her passion . But the talk about Miss Galindo ’s choice and management of her servants was confined to village gossip , and had never reached my Lady Ludlow ’s ears , though doubtless Mr. Horner was well acquainted with it . What my lady knew of her amounted to this . It was the custom in those days for the wealthy ladies of the county to set on foot a repository , as it was called , in the assize - town . The ostensible manager of this repository was generally a decayed gentlewoman , a clergyman ’s widow , or so forth . She was , however , controlled by a committee of ladies ; and paid by them in proportion to the amount of goods she sold ; and these goods were the small manufactures of ladies of little or no fortune , whose names , if they chose it , were only signified by initials . Poor water - colour drawings , indigo and Indian ink ; screens , ornamented with moss and dried leaves ; paintings on velvet , and such faintly ornamental works were displayed on one side of the shop . It was always reckoned a mark of characteristic gentility in the repository , to have only common heavy - framed sash - windows , which admitted very little light , so I never was quite certain of the merit of these Works of Art as they were entitled . But , on the other side , where the Useful Work placard was put up , there was a great variety of articles , of whose unusual excellence every one might judge . Such fine sewing , and stitching , and button - holing ! Such bundles of soft delicate knitted stockings and socks ; and , above all , in Lady Ludlow ’s eyes , such hanks of the finest spun flaxen thread ! And the most delicate dainty work of all was done by Miss Galindo , as Lady Ludlow very well knew . Yet , for all their fine sewing , it sometimes happened that Miss Galindo ’s patterns were of an old - fashioned kind ; and the dozen nightcaps , maybe , on the materials for which she had expended bona - fide money , and on the making - up , no little time and eyesight , would lie for months in a yellow neglected heap ; and at such times , it was said , Miss Galindo was more amusing than usual , more full of dry drollery and humour ; just as at the times when an order came in to X. ( the initial she had chosen ) for a stock of well - paying things , she sat and stormed at her servant as she stitched away . She herself explained her practice in this way : — “
53736	53886	53734	53734	Sally	217	” Such were Miss Galindo ’s means and manner of living in her own house . Out of doors , and in the village , she was not popular , although she would have been sorely missed had she left the place . But she asked too many home questions ( not to say impertinent ) respecting the domestic economies ( for even the very poor liked to spend their bit of money their own way ) , and would open cupboards to find out hidden extravagances , and question closely respecting the weekly amount of butter , till one day she met with what would have been a rebuff to any other person , but which she rather enjoyed than otherwise . She was going into a cottage , and in the doorway met the good woman chasing out a duck , and apparently unconscious of her visitor . “
53893	53901	53890	53891	Miss Galindo	215	” she cried , addressing the duck . “
53912	53926	53907	53907	I	0	” she continued , as if seeing the lady for the first time . “
53943	53950	53939	53940	Miss Gal	218	” ( to the duck ) . “
53962	53967	53960	53960	you	215	” inquired her visitor . “
54000	54001	53982	53982	he	2012	” “
54050	54313	54045	54045	him	2081	” And the master went up , and was so won over by Miss Galindo ’s merry ways , and sharp insight into the mysteries of his various kinds of business ( he was a mason , chimney - sweeper , and ratcatcher ) , that he came home and abused his wife the next time she called the duck the name by which he himself had christened her . But odd as Miss Galindo was in general , she could be as well - bred a lady as any one when she chose . And choose she always did when my Lady Ludlow was by . Indeed , I do n’t know the man , woman , or child , that did not instinctively turn out its best side to her ladyship . So she had no notion of the qualities which , I am sure , made Mr. Horner think that Miss Galindo would be most unmanageable as a clerk , and heartily wish that the idea had never come into my lady ’s head . But there it was ; and he had annoyed her ladyship already more than he liked to - day , so he could not directly contradict her , but only urge difficulties which he hoped might prove insuperable . But every one of them Lady Ludlow knocked down . Letters to copy ? Doubtless . Miss Galindo could come up to the Hall ; she should have a room to herself ; she wrote a beautiful hand ; and writing would save her eyesight . “
54320	54391	54045	54045	him	2081	” My lady would answer for that too ; and for more than Mr. Horner seemed to think it necessary to inquire about . Miss Galindo was by birth and breeding a lady of the strictest honour , and would , if possible , forget the substance of any letters that passed through her hands ; at any rate , no one would ever hear of them again from her . “
54394	54465	54045	54045	him	2081	” Oh ! as for that , Lady Ludlow would herself take care that it was managed in the most delicate manner possible . She would send to invite Miss Galindo to tea at the Hall that very afternoon , if Mr. Horner would only give her ladyship the slightest idea of the average length of time that my lady was to request Miss Galindo to sacrifice to her daily . “
54472	54987	54989	54989	my	0	” Mr. Horner looked very grave as he passed the windows of the room where I lay . I do n’t think he liked the idea of Miss Galindo as a clerk . Lady Ludlow ’s invitations were like royal commands . Indeed , the village was too quiet to allow the inhabitants to have many evening engagements of any kind . Now and then , Mr. and Mrs. Horner gave a tea and supper to the principal tenants and their wives , to which the clergyman was invited , and Miss Galindo , Mrs. Medlicott , and one or two other spinsters and widows . The glory of the supper - table on these occasions was invariably furnished by her ladyship : it was a cold roasted peacock , with his tail stuck out as if in life . Mrs. Medlicott would take up the whole morning arranging the feathers in the proper semicircle , and was always pleased with the wonder and admiration it excited . It was considered a due reward and fitting compliment to her exertions that Mr. Horner always took her in to supper , and placed her opposite to the magnificent dish , at which she sweetly smiled all the time they were at table . But since Mrs. Horner had had the paralytic stroke these parties had been given up ; and Miss Galindo wrote a note to Lady Ludlow in reply to her invitation , saying that she was entirely disengaged , and would have great pleasure in doing herself the honour of waiting upon her ladyship . Whoever visited my lady took their meals with her , sitting on the dais , in the presence of all my former companions . So I did not see Miss Galindo until some time after tea ; as the young gentlewomen had had to bring her their sewing and spinning , to hear the remarks of so competent a judge . At length her ladyship brought her visitor into the room where I lay,—it was one of my bad days , I remember,—in order to have her little bit of private conversation . Miss Galindo was dressed in her best gown , I am sure , but I had never seen anything like it except in a picture , it was so old - fashioned . She wore a white muslin apron , delicately embroidered , and put on a little crookedly , in order , as she told us , even Lady Ludlow , before the evening was over , to conceal a spot whence the colour had been discharged by a lemon - stain . This crookedness had an odd effect , especially when I saw that it was intentional ; indeed , she was so anxious about her apron ’s right adjustment in the wrong place , that she told us straight out why she wore it so , and asked her ladyship if the spot was properly hidden , at the same time lifting up her apron and showing her how large it was . “
55105	55106	55090	55090	I	0	” “
55118	55162	55108	55108	you	0	” asked my lady , who had now arranged Miss Galindo in the pleasantest chair , and taken her own little wicker - work one , and , having her work in her hands , was ready to try and open the subject . “
55217	55218	55168	55168	your	0	” “
55235	55260	55221	55221	I	0	” said my lady , drawing a little nearer to her proposal , which I fancy she found it a little awkward to make . “
55347	55348	55349	55349	I	0	” “
55362	55369	55359	55360	Miss Galindo	215	” said her ladyship , smiling . “
55549	55550	55540	55540	I	0	” “
55560	55565	55553	55553	you	0	” said Lady Ludlow . “
55587	55588	55591	55591	your	0	” “
55663	55733	55660	55661	my lady	336	” There was no leading into the subject by delicate degrees , for Miss Galindo was evidently so fond of talking , that , if asked a question , she made her answer so long , that before she came to an end of it , she had wandered far away from the original starting point . So Lady Ludlow plunged at once into what she had to say . “
55747	55748	55749	55750	My lady	336	” “
55769	55806	55765	55765	you	336	” replied Miss Galindo , almost with tears in her eyes ; so glad were we all to do anything for her ladyship , which could be called a free service and not merely a duty . “
55935	55963	55925	55926	Mr. Horner	238	” Lady Ludlow stopped . Miss Galindo ’s countenance had fallen . There was some great obstacle in her mind to her wish for obliging Lady Ludlow . “
55969	56196	55925	55926	Mr. Horner	238	” she asked at length . Lady Ludlow had not a notion who Sally was . Nor if she had had a notion , would she have had a conception of the perplexities that poured into Miss Galindo ’s mind , at the idea of leaving her rough forgetful dwarf without the perpetual monitorship of her mistress . Lady Ludlow , accustomed to a household where everything went on noiselessly , perfectly , and by clockwork , conducted by a number of highly - paid , well - chosen , and accomplished servants , had not a conception of the nature of the rough material from which her servants came . Besides , in her establishment , so that the result was good , no one inquired if the small economies had been observed in the production . Whereas every penny — every halfpenny , was of consequence to Miss Galindo ; and visions of squandered drops of milk and wasted crusts of bread filled her mind with dismay . But she swallowed all her apprehensions down , out of her regard for Lady Ludlow , and desire to be of service to her . No one knows how great a trial it was to her when she thought of Sally , unchecked and unscolded for three hours every morning . But all she said was — “
56313	56314	56334	56335	An authoress	2131	” “
56344	56345	56340	56340	You	2128	” “
56419	56420	56392	56392	they	2137	” “
56423	56424	56392	56392	they	2137	” “
56447	56448	56427	56427	I	0	” “
56452	56453	56427	56427	I	0	” “
56500	56501	56503	56503	I	0	” “
56515	56520	56512	56513	Miss Galindo	215	” said her ladyship . “
56566	56567	56568	56568	I	0	” “
56575	56684	56690	56690	him	2144	” said Miss Galindo , with a good deal of gratified pride at my lady ’s praise . Presently , my lady took her to look at a curious old cabinet , which Lord Ludlow had picked up at the Hague ; and while they were out of the room on this errand , I suppose the question of remuneration was settled , for I heard no more of it . When they came back , they were talking of Mr. Gray . Miss Galindo was unsparing in her expressions of opinion about him : going much farther than my lady — in her language , at least . “
56858	56859	56849	56850	Mr. Gray	113	” “
56872	56877	56863	56863	you	336	” said my lady . “
56912	56913	56914	56914	I	0	” “
56928	56937	56914	56914	I	0	” replied Miss Galindo , shaking her head . “
56970	56971	56973	56973	he	1343	” “
56977	57007	56973	56973	he	1343	” said my lady , her face lighting up , as it always did when she heard of any kind or generous action , no matter who performed it . “
57032	57061	57062	57062	I	0	” When Miss Galindo went , she left so favourable an impression of her visit on my lady , that she said to me with a pleased smile — “
57113	57253	57088	57088	I	0	” But something happened to the lad before this purpose could be accomplished . CHAPTER X. The next morning , Miss Galindo made her appearance , and , by some mistake , unusual to my lady ’s well - trained servants , was shown into the room where I was trying to walk ; for a certain amount of exercise was prescribed for me , painful although the exertion had become . She brought a little basket along with her and while the footman was gone to inquire my lady ’s wishes ( for I do n’t think that Lady Ludlow expected Miss Galindo so soon to assume her clerkship ; nor , indeed , had Mr. Horner any work of any kind ready for his new assistant to do ) , she launched out into conversation with me . “
57348	57373	57374	57374	I	0	made”—and she took out of her basket a pail of brown - holland over - sleeves , very much such as a grocer ’s apprentice wears—“and
57526	57527	57530	57531	Miss Galindo	215	” “
57533	57537	57530	57531	Miss Galindo	215	” said I , “
57553	57554	57557	57557	she	336	” “
57639	57726	57728	57729	Mr. Horner	238	” I do not know how long she would have gone on ; but my lady came in , and I , released from my duty of entertaining Miss Galindo , made my limping way into the next room . To tell the truth , I was rather afraid of Miss Galindo ’s tongue , for I never knew what she would say next . After a while my lady came , and began to look in the bureau for something : and as she looked she said—“I
57823	57841	57845	57845	she	215	” When my lady returned again , she sat down and began to talk of Mr. Gray . “
58054	58055	58056	58058	A Baptist baker	2192	” “
58060	58136	58056	58058	A Baptist baker	2192	” I exclaimed . I had never seen a Dissenter , to my knowledge ; but , having always heard them spoken of with horror , I looked upon them almost as if they were rhinoceroses . I wanted to see a live Dissenter , I believe , and yet I wished it were over . I was almost surprised when I heard that any of them were engaged in such peaceful occupations as baking . “
58192	58627	58629	58629	he	2196	” From what I could hear , Mr. Gray seemed to be taking his own way ; at any rate , more than he had done when he first came to the village , when his natural timidity had made him defer to my lady , and seek her consent and sanction before embarking in any new plan . But newness was a quality Lady Ludlow especially disliked . Even in the fashions of dress and furniture , she clung to the old , to the modes which had prevailed when she was young ; and though she had a deep personal regard for Queen Charlotte ( to whom , as I have already said , she had been maid - of - honour ) , yet there was a tinge of Jacobitism about her , such as made her extremely dislike to hear Prince Charles Edward called the young Pretender , as many loyal people did in those days , and made her fond of telling of the thorn - tree in my lord ’s park in Scotland , which had been planted by bonny Queen Mary herself , and before which every guest in the Castle of Monkshaven was expected to stand bare - headed , out of respect to the memory and misfortunes of the royal planter . We might play at cards , if we so chose , on a Sunday ; at least , I suppose we might , for my lady and Mr. Mountford used to do so often when I first went . But we must neither play cards , nor read , nor sew on the fifth of November and on the thirtieth of January , but must go to church , and meditate all the rest of the day — and very hard work meditating was . I would far rather have scoured a room . That was the reason , I suppose , why a passive life was seen to be better discipline for me than an active one . But I am wandering away from my lady , and her dislike to all innovation . Now , it seemed to me , as far as I heard , that Mr. Gray was full of nothing but new things , and that what he first did was to attack all our established institutions , both in the village and the parish , and also in the nation . To be sure , I heard of his ways of going on principally from Miss Galindo , who was apt to speak more strongly than accurately . “
58632	58636	58629	58629	he	2196	” she said , “
58980	58991	58975	58975	I	0	” The next day it was a still worse story . “
59076	59087	59071	59072	Mrs. Horner	219	” This was one of Miss Galindo ’s grim jokes . “
59352	59353	59341	59342	Mr. Gray	113	” “
59361	59362	59358	59359	Mr. Gray	113	” “
59742	59765	59710	59710	I	0	“ Now , our Sally likes tea and bread and butter above everything , and dry bread was not to her taste . “
59803	59901	59773	59775	the impudent hussy	2237	“ I was determined not to give her an opening towards the carnal subject of butter , so she lingered still , longing to ask leave to run for it . But I gave her none , and munched my dry bread myself , thinking what a famous cake I could make for little Ben Pole with the bit of butter we were saving ; and when Sally had had her butterless tea , and was in none of the best of tempers because Martha had not bethought herself of the butter , I just quietly said — “
59991	60276	59979	59980	Mr. Gray	113	” I had heard so many little speeches about Mr. Gray from one person or another , all speaking against him , as a mischief - maker , a setter - up of new doctrines , and of a fanciful standard of life ( and you may be sure that , where Lady Ludlow led , Mrs. Medlicott and Adams were certain to follow , each in their different ways showing the influence my lady had over them ) , that I believe I had grown to consider him as a very instrument of evil , and to expect to perceive in his face marks of his presumption , and arrogance , and impertinent interference . It was now many weeks since I had seen him , and when he was one morning shown into the blue drawing - room ( into which I had been removed for a change ) , I was quite surprised to see how innocent and awkward a young man he appeared , confused even more than I was at our unexpected tete - a - tete . He looked thinner , his eyes more eager , his expression more anxious , and his colour came and went more than it had done when I had seen him last . I tried to make a little conversation , as I was , to my own surprise , more at my ease than he was ; but his thoughts were evidently too much preoccupied for him to do more than answer me with monosyllables . Presently my lady came in . Mr. Gray twitched and coloured more than ever ; but plunged into the middle of his subject at once . “
60368	60462	60463	60463	You	336	” His eyes were dilated , and I could almost have said they were full of tears with his eagerness . But I am sure it is a bad plan to remind people of decided opinions which they have once expressed , if you wish them to modify those opinions . Now , Mr. Gray had done this with my lady ; and though I do not mean to say she was obstinate , yet she was not one to retract . She was silent for a moment or two before she replied . “
60483	60495	60463	60463	You	336	” was her answer — very coldly , very gently given . “
60538	60539	60555	60555	They	2245	” “
60549	60554	60555	60555	They	2245	” he broke in . “
60584	60585	60576	60576	they	2245	” “
60591	60598	60588	60589	Mr. Gray	113	” said my lady , smiling , “
60658	60659	60638	60638	they	2245	” “
60674	60714	60664	60664	I	0	” My lady coloured at the mistake she had made ; for she herself was truly pious . Yet when she resumed the subject , it seemed to me as if her tone was a little sharper than before . “
60743	60744	60745	60746	My Lady	336	” “
61024	61084	61085	61086	Mr. Gray	113	” Mr. Gray had stood up and sat down once or twice while he had been speaking , in an agitated , nervous kind of way , and now he was interrupted by a violent fit of coughing , after which he trembled all over . My lady rang for a glass of water , and looked much distressed . “
61088	61092	61085	61086	Mr. Gray	113	” said she , “
61157	61249	61147	61147	you	113	” And my lady smiled very kindly and pleasantly at him , as he sat , a little panting , a little flushed , trying to recover his breath . I am sure that now they were brought face to face , she had quite forgotten all the offence she had taken at his doings when she heard of them from others ; and , indeed , it was enough to soften any one ’s heart to see that young , almost boyish face , looking in such anxiety and distress . “
61260	61298	61147	61147	you	113	” he asked , as soon as he could recover breath , and with such an air of humility , that I am sure no one who had seen it could have ever thought him conceited again . “
61329	61338	61339	61340	My dear	3052	” and again the cough and agitation returned . “
61344	61366	61339	61340	My dear	3052	” said my lady ( the day before I could never have believed she could have called him My dear ) , “
61434	61435	61426	61426	you	113	” “
61765	61766	61767	61768	Mr. Gray	113	” “
61770	61775	61767	61768	Mr. Gray	113	” said my lady , “
62123	62124	62125	62125	I	0	” “
62202	62203	62214	62214	they	2299	” “
62220	62221	62214	62214	they	2299	” “
62269	62270	62271	62272	Mr. Gray”—surprise	235	” “
62272	62280	62271	62272	Mr. Gray”—surprise	235	Gray”—surprise in her air , and some little indignation—“they
62293	62294	62295	62295	I	0	” “
62317	62341	62303	62303	I	0	” There was a pause ; my lady looked perplexed , and somewhat ruffled ; Mr. Gray as though hopeless and wearied out . “
62347	62359	62360	62360	you	3119	” said he , at last , rising as he spoke , “
62422	62423	62405	62405	He	233	” “
62435	62451	62405	62405	He	233	” ( and indeed he had been coughing very much all through the conversation ) . “
62506	62542	62496	62496	you	3119	” My lady spoke very kindly ; but he was in too excited a state to recognize the kindness , while the idea of delay was evidently a sore irritation . I heard him say : “
62566	62599	62600	62601	Mr. Gray	113	” But my lady was speaking to the old butler , for whom , at her sign , I had rung the bell some little time before . Now she turned round . “
62739	62740	62717	62717	I	0	” “
62762	62782	62756	62756	I	0	” He spoke with some impatience ; Poor fellow ! he was too weak , exhausted , and nervous . “
62872	63072	62862	62862	I	0	” He stood up , and then turned dizzy . My lady looked on , deeply hurt , and not a little offended , he held out his hand to her , and I could see that she had a little hesitation before she took it . He then saw me , I almost think , for the first time ; and put out his hand once more , drew it back , as if undecided , put it out again , and finally took hold of mine for an instant in his damp , listless hand , and was gone . Lady Ludlow was dissatisfied with both him and herself , I was sure . Indeed , I was dissatisfied with the result of the interview myself . But my lady was not one to speak out her feelings on the subject ; nor was I one to forget myself , and begin on a topic which she did not begin . She came to me , and was very tender with me ; so tender , that that , and the thoughts of Mr. Gray ’s sick , hopeless , disappointed look , nearly made me cry . “
63080	63085	63073	63073	You	2315	” said my lady . “
63126	63127	63130	63130	my	0	” “
63133	63142	63130	63130	my	0	” said I , and then I stopped . “
63147	63151	63130	63130	my	0	” asked she . “
63175	63176	63153	63153	you	2315	” “
63183	63193	63181	63181	child	3053	” though I do n’t think she was displeased , “
63213	63247	63210	63211	Dr. Trevor	237	” And for the next half - hour , we did nothing but arrange physical comforts and cures for poor Mr. Gray . At the end of the time , Mrs. Medlicott said — “
63278	63279	63280	63281	Harry Gregson	150	” “
63301	64374	64375	64375	You	2324	” CHAPTER XI . But I do n’t see how my lady could think it was over - education that made Harry Gregson break his thigh , for the manner in which he met with the accident was this : — Mr. Horner , who had fallen sadly out of health since his wife ’s death , had attached himself greatly to Harry Gregson . Now , Mr. Horner had a cold manner to every one , and never spoke more than was necessary , at the best of times . And , latterly , it had not been the best of times with him . I dare say , he had had some causes for anxiety ( of which I knew nothing ) about my lady ’s affairs ; and he was evidently annoyed by my lady ’s whim ( as he once inadvertently called it ) of placing Miss Galindo under him in the position of a clerk . Yet he had always been friends , in his quiet way , with Miss Galindo , and she devoted herself to her new occupation with diligence and punctuality , although more than once she had moaned to me over the orders for needlework which had been sent to her , and which , owing to her occupation in the service of Lady Ludlow , she had been unable to fulfil . The only living creature to whom the staid Mr. Horner could be said to be attached , was Harry Gregson . To my lady he was a faithful and devoted servant , looking keenly after her interests , and anxious to forward them at any cost of trouble to himself . But the more shrewd Mr. Horner was , the more probability was there of his being annoyed at certain peculiarities of opinion which my lady held with a quiet , gentle pertinacity ; against which no arguments , based on mere worldly and business calculations , made any way . This frequent opposition to views which Mr. Horner entertained , although it did not interfere with the sincere respect which the lady and the steward felt for each other , yet prevented any warmer feeling of affection from coming in . It seems strange to say it , but I must repeat it — the only person for whom , since his wife ’s death , Mr. Horner seemed to feel any love , was the little imp Harry Gregson , with his bright , watchful eyes , his tangled hair hanging right down to his eyebrows , for all the world like a Skye terrier . This lad , half gipsy and whole poacher , as many people esteemed him , hung about the silent , respectable , staid Mr. Horner , and followed his steps with something of the affectionate fidelity of the dog which he resembled . I suspect , this demonstration of attachment to his person on Harry Gregson ’s part was what won Mr. Horner ’s regard . In the first instance , the steward had only chosen the lad out as the cleverest instrument he could find for his purpose ; and I do n’t mean to say that , if Harry had not been almost as shrewd as Mr. Horner himself was , both by original disposition and subsequent experience , the steward would have taken to him as he did , let the lad have shown ever so much affection for him . But even to Harry Mr. Horner was silent . Still , it was pleasant to find himself in many ways so readily understood ; to perceive that the crumbs of knowledge he let fall were picked up by his little follower , and hoarded like gold that here was one to hate the persons and things whom Mr. Horner coldly disliked , and to reverence and admire all those for whom he had any regard . Mr. Horner had never had a child , and unconsciously , I suppose , something of the paternal feeling had begun to develop itself in him towards Harry Gregson . I heard one or two things from different people , which have always made me fancy that Mr. Horner secretly and almost unconsciously hoped that Harry Gregson might be trained so as to be first his clerk , and next his assistant , and finally his successor in his stewardship to the Hanbury estates . Harry ’s disgrace with my lady , in consequence of his reading the letter , was a deeper blow to Mr. Horner than his quiet manner would ever have led any one to suppose , or than Lady Ludlow ever dreamed of inflicting , I am sure . Probably Harry had a short , stern rebuke from Mr. Horner at the time , for his manner was always hard even to those he cared for the most . But Harry ’s love was not to be daunted or quelled by a few sharp words . I dare say , from what I heard of them afterwards , that Harry accompanied Mr. Horner in his walk over the farm the very day of the rebuke ; his presence apparently unnoticed by the agent , by whom his absence would have been painfully felt nevertheless . That was the way of it , as I have been told . Mr. Horner never bade Harry go with him ; never thanked him for going , or being at his heels ready to run on any errands , straight as the crow flies to his point , and back to heel in as short a time as possible . Yet , if Harry were away , Mr. Horner never inquired the reason from any of the men who might be supposed to know whether he was detained by his father , or otherwise engaged ; he never asked Harry himself where he had been . But Miss Galindo said that those labourers who knew Mr. Horner well , told her that he was always more quick - eyed to shortcomings , more savage - like in fault - finding , on those days when the lad was absent . Miss Galindo , indeed , was my great authority for most of the village news which I heard . She it was who gave me the particulars of poor Harry ’s accident . “
64381	64385	64375	64375	You	2324	” she said , “
64398	64432	64386	64388	the little poacher	2326	” ( This was the name by which Miss Galindo always spoke of Mr. Horner to me , ever since she had been , as she called it , appointed his clerk . ) “
64880	64881	64872	64872	he	1622	” “
64896	64897	64893	64893	he	2356	” “
65129	65145	65113	65113	he	113	” ( Miss Galindo tried hard not to whimper , as she said it ) , “
65167	65168	65154	65154	I	0	” “
65174	65177	65154	65154	I	0	” asked I. “
65186	65187	65180	65181	Mr. Gray	113	” “
65476	65477	65459	65460	my lady	336	” “
65482	65530	65478	65480	Poor Mr. Gray	113	” said I , thinking of his flushed face , and his feverish , restless ways , when he had been calling on my lady not an hour before his exertions on Harry ’s behalf . And I told Miss Galindo how ill I had thought him . “
65533	65537	65478	65480	Poor Mr. Gray	113	” said she . “
65579	65581	65574	65574	he	240	” Now “
65588	65733	65736	65738	the old donkey	2389	” meant the village surgeon , Mr. Prince , between whom and Miss Galindo there was war to the knife , as they often met in the cottages , when there was illness , and she had her queer , odd recipes , which he , with his grand pharmacopoeia , held in infinite contempt , and the consequence of their squabbling had been , not long before this very time , that he had established a kind of rule , that into whatever sick - room Miss Galindo was admitted , there he refused to visit . But Miss Galindo ’s prescriptions and visits cost nothing and were often backed by kitchen - physic ; so , though it was true that she never came but she scolded about something or other , she was generally preferred as medical attendant to Mr. Prince . “
65808	65824	65800	65801	Doctor Trevor	240	” ( she sighed a little , some time I may tell you why ) , “
65913	65914	65903	65906	a pretty conceited one	2400	” “
65931	65932	65903	65906	a pretty conceited one	2400	” “
66132	66227	66122	66122	she	143	” So Miss Galindo went her ways ; but not the less was she at her post in the morning ; a little crosser and more silent than usual ; but the first was not to be wondered at , and the last was rather a blessing . Lady Ludlow had been extremely anxious both about Mr. Gray and Harry Gregson . Kind and thoughtful in any case of illness and accident , she always was ; but somehow , in this , the feeling that she was not quite — what shall I call it?—“friends
66228	66865	66866	66866	You	2409	” seems hardly the right word to use , as to the possible feeling between the Countess Ludlow and the little vagabond messenger , who had only once been in her presence,—that she had hardly parted from either as she could have wished to do , had death been near , made her more than usually anxious . Doctor Trevor was not to spare obtaining the best medical advice the county could afford : whatever he ordered in the way of diet , was to be prepared under Mrs. Medlicott ’s own eye , and sent down from the Hall to the Parsonage . As Mr. Horner had given somewhat similar directions , in the case of Harry Gregson at least , there was rather a multiplicity of counsellors and dainties , than any lack of them . And , the second night , Mr. Horner insisted on taking the superintendence of the nursing himself , and sat and snored by Harry ’s bedside , while the poor , exhausted mother lay by her child,—thinking that she watched him , but in reality fast asleep , as Miss Galindo told us ; for , distrusting any one ’s powers of watching and nursing but her own , she had stolen across the quiet village street in cloak and dressing - gown , and found Mr. Gray in vain trying to reach the cup of barley - water which Mr. Horner had placed just beyond his reach . In consequence of Mr. Gray ’s illness , we had to have a strange curate to do duty ; a man who dropped his h ’s , and hurried through the service , and yet had time enough to stand in my Lady ’s way , bowing to her as she came out of church , and so subservient in manner , that I believe that sooner than remain unnoticed by a countess , he would have preferred being scolded , or even cuffed . Now I found out , that great as was my lady ’s liking and approval of respect , nay , even reverence , being paid to her as a person of quality,—a sort of tribute to her Order , which she had no individual right to remit , or , indeed , not to exact,—yet she , being personally simple , sincere , and holding herself in low esteem , could not endure anything like the servility of Mr. Crosse , the temporary curate . She grew absolutely to loathe his perpetual smiling and bowing ; his instant agreement with the slightest opinion she uttered ; his veering round as she blew the wind . I have often said that my lady did not talk much , as she might have done had she lived among her equals . But we all loved her so much , that we had learnt to interpret all her little ways pretty truly ; and I knew what particular turns of her head , and contractions of her delicate fingers meant , as well as if she had expressed herself in words . I began to suspect that my lady would be very thankful to have Mr. Gray about again , and doing his duty even with a conscientiousness that might amount to worrying himself , and fidgeting others ; and although Mr. Gray might hold her opinions in as little esteem as those of any simple gentlewoman , she was too sensible not to feel how much flavour there was in his conversation , compared to that of Mr. Crosse , who was only her tasteless echo . As for Miss Galindo , she was utterly and entirely a partisan of Mr. Gray ’s , almost ever since she had begun to nurse him during his illness . “
67006	67047	66991	66991	him	2413	” ( Miss Galindo was making horrible faces , to keep back tears , squeezing up her eyes in a way which would have amused me at any other time , but when she was speaking of Mr. Gray ) ; “
67324	67352	67321	67321	Nelly	243	” I think Miss Galindo ’s desertion to Mr. Gray ’s opinions in this matter hurt my lady just a little bit ; but she only said — “
67397	67428	67429	67429	Your	2428	” My lady made herself smile as she said this . Miss Galindo saw it was an effort to do so . She thought a minute before she spoke again . “
67479	67480	67481	67481	I	0	” “
67501	67508	67498	67499	Miss Galindo	215	” said my lady , gravely . “
67514	67530	67511	67511	you	2428	” replied Miss Galindo , bluntly . And then , correcting herself , she said , “
67681	67682	67674	67674	you	2428	” “
67685	67690	67693	67693	him	113	” said my lady , “
67738	67783	67784	67784	You	2445	” My lady said this in her usual soft tones ; but the words had a tinge of impatience about them ; indeed , she was more ruffled than I had often seen her ; but , checking herself in an instant she said — “
67827	67828	67819	67819	he	238	” “
67836	67841	67829	67829	I	0	” said Miss Galindo . “
67891	67902	67904	67904	he	238	” Was it not a pretty companionship for my lady ? “
67969	68005	67961	67962	Mr. Gray	113	” Miss Galindo looked wistfully at my lady , as she said this . But my lady only said , drily , and rising at the same time , as if to end the conversation — “
68028	68029	68010	68011	Mr. Gray	113	” “
68032	68051	68010	68011	Mr. Gray	113	” exclaimed Miss Galindo , as my lady left the room , with an apology for going away ; “
68099	68100	68101	68101	My	0	” “
68110	68136	68101	68102	My lady	336	” said I , as it were apologetically . I only stopped Miss Galindo ’s self - reproaches to draw down her wrath upon myself . “
68294	69589	68286	68286	she	336	” And off Miss Galindo went . I could not exactly tell what I had done wrong ; but I took care never again to come in between my lady and her by any remark about the one to the other ; for I saw that some most powerful bond of grateful affection made Miss Galindo almost worship my lady . Meanwhile , Harry Gregson was limping a little about in the village , still finding his home in Mr. Gray ’s house ; for there he could most conveniently be kept under the doctor ’s eye , and receive the requisite care , and enjoy the requisite nourishment . As soon as he was a little better , he was to go to Mr. Horner ’s house ; but , as the steward lived some distance out of the way , and was much from home , he had agreed to leave Harry at the house ; to which he had first been taken , until he was quite strong again ; and the more willingly , I suspect , from what I heard afterwards , because Mr. Gray gave up all the little strength of speaking which he had , to teaching Harry in the very manner which Mr. Horner most desired . As for Gregson the father — he — wild man of the woods , poacher , tinker , jack - of - all trades — was getting tamed by this kindness to his child . Hitherto his hand had been against every man , as every man ’s had been against him . That affair before the justice , which I told you about , when Mr. Gray and even my lady had interested themselves to get him released from unjust imprisonment , was the first bit of justice he had ever met with ; it attracted him to the people , and attached him to the spot on which he had but squatted for a time . I am not sure if any of the villagers were grateful to him for remaining in their neighbourhood , instead of decamping as he had often done before , for good reasons , doubtless , of personal safety . Harry was only one out of a brood of ten or twelve children , some of whom had earned for themselves no good character in service : one , indeed , had been actually transported , for a robbery committed in a distant part of the county ; and the tale was yet told in the village of how Gregson the father came back from the trial in a state of wild rage , striding through the place , and uttering oaths of vengeance to himself , his great black eyes gleaming out of his matted hair , and his arms working by his side , and now and then tossed up in his impotent despair . As I heard the account , his wife followed him , child - laden and weeping . After this , they had vanished from the country for a time , leaving their mud hovel locked up , and the door - key , as the neighbours said , buried in a hedge bank . The Gregsons had reappeared much about the same time that Mr. Gray came to Hanbury . He had either never heard of their evil character , or considered that it gave them all the more claims upon his Christian care ; and the end of it was , that this rough , untamed , strong giant of a heathen was loyal slave to the weak , hectic , nervous , self - distrustful parson . Gregson had also a kind of grumbling respect for Mr. Horner : he did not quite like the steward ’s monopoly of his Harry : the mother submitted to that with a better grace , swallowing down her maternal jealousy in the prospect of her child ’s advancement to a better and more respectable position than that in which his parents had struggled through life . But Mr. Horner , the steward , and Gregson , the poacher and squatter , had come into disagreeable contact too often in former days for them to be perfectly cordial at any future time . Even now , when there was no immediate cause for anything but gratitude for his child ’s sake on Gregson ’s part , he would skulk out of Mr. Horner ’s way , if he saw him coming ; and it took all Mr. Horner ’s natural reserve and acquired self - restraint to keep him from occasionally holding up his father ’s life as a warning to Harry . Now Gregson had nothing of this desire for avoidance with regard to Mr. Gray . The poacher had a feeling of physical protection towards the parson ; while the latter had shown the moral courage , without which Gregson would never have respected him , in coming right down upon him more than once in the exercise of unlawful pursuits , and simply and boldly telling him he was doing wrong , with such a quiet reliance upon Gregson ’s better feeling , at the same time , that the strong poacher could not have lifted a finger against Mr. Gray , though it had been to save himself from being apprehended and taken to the lock - ups the very next hour . He had rather listened to the parson ’s bold words with an approving smile , much as Mr. Gulliver might have hearkened to a lecture from a Lilliputian . But when brave words passed into kind deeds , Gregson ’s heart mutely acknowledged its master and keeper . And the beauty of it all was , that Mr. Gray knew nothing of the good work he had done , or recognized himself as the instrument which God had employed . He thanked God , it is true , fervently and often , that the work was done ; and loved the wild man for his rough gratitude ; but it never occurred to the poor young clergyman , lying on his sick - bed , and praying , as Miss Galindo had told us he did , to be forgiven for his unprofitable life , to think of Gregson ’s reclaimed soul as anything with which he had had to do . It was now more than three months since Mr. Gray had been at Hanbury Court . During all that time he had been confined to his house , if not to his sick - bed , and he and my lady had never met since their last discussion and difference about Farmer Hale ’s barn . This was not my dear lady ’s fault ; no one could have been more attentive in every way to the slightest possible want of either of the invalids , especially of Mr. Gray . And she would have gone to see him at his own house , as she sent him word , but that her foot had slipped upon the polished oak staircase , and her ankle had been sprained . So we had never seen Mr. Gray since his illness , when one November day he was announced as wishing to speak to my lady . She was sitting in her room — the room in which I lay now pretty constantly — and I remember she looked startled , when word was brought to her of Mr. Gray ’s being at the Hall . She could not go to him , she was too lame for that , so she bade him be shown into where she sat . “
69599	69683	68286	68286	she	336	” she exclaimed , looking at the fog which had crept up to the windows , and was sapping the little remaining life in the brilliant Virginian creeper leaves that draperied the house on the terrace side . He came in white , trembling , his large eyes wild and dilated . He hastened up to Lady Ludlow ’s chair , and , to my surprise , took one of her hands and kissed it , without speaking , yet shaking all over . “
69687	69703	69684	69685	Mr. Gray	113	” said she , quickly , with sharp , tremulous apprehension of some unknown evil . “
69715	69716	69713	69713	you	113	” “
69722	69739	69740	69741	A gentleman	1283	” replied he , forcing his words to be calm , as with a great effort . “
69763	69764	69757	69757	He	1283	” “
69768	69783	69757	69757	He	1283	” said my dear lady , stretching out her arms in dumb questioning attitude . “
69801	70861	69798	69799	the Lord	542	” But my poor lady could not echo the words . He was the last remaining child . And once she had been the joyful mother of nine . CHAPTER XII . I am ashamed to say what feeling became strongest in my mind about this time ; next to the sympathy we all of us felt for my dear lady in her deep sorrow , I mean ; for that was greater and stronger than anything else , however contradictory you may think it , when you hear all . It might arise from my being so far from well at the time , which produced a diseased mind in a diseased body ; but I was absolutely jealous for my father ’s memory , when I saw how many signs of grief there were for my lord ’s death , he having done next to nothing for the village and parish , which now changed , as it were , its daily course of life , because his lordship died in a far - off city . My father had spent the best years of his manhood in labouring hard , body and soul , for the people amongst whom he lived . His family , of course , claimed the first place in his heart ; he would have been good for little , even in the way of benevolence , if they had not . But close after them he cared for his parishioners , and neighbours . And yet , when he died , though the church bells tolled , and smote upon our hearts with hard , fresh pain at every beat , the sounds of every - day life still went on , close pressing around us,—carts and carriages , street - cries , distant barrel - organs ( the kindly neighbours kept them out of our street ): life , active , noisy life , pressed on our acute consciousness of Death , and jarred upon it as on a quick nerve . And when we went to church,—my father ’s own church,—though the pulpit cushions were black , and many of the congregation had put on some humble sign of mourning , yet it did not alter the whole material aspect of the place . And yet what was Lord Ludlow ’s relation to Hanbury , compared to my father ’s work and place in — ? O ! it was very wicked in me ! I think if I had seen my lady,—if I had dared to ask to go to her , I should not have felt so miserable , so discontented . But she sat in her own room , hung with black , all , even over the shutters . She saw no light but that which was artificial — candles , lamps , and the like — for more than a month . Only Adams went near her . Mr. Gray was not admitted , though he called daily . Even Mrs. Medlicott did not see her for near a fortnight . The sight of my lady ’s griefs , or rather the recollection of it , made Mrs. Medlicott talk far more than was her wo nt . She told us , with many tears , and much gesticulation , even speaking German at times , when her English would not flow , that my lady sat there , a white figure in the middle of the darkened room ; a shaded lamp near her , the light of which fell on an open Bible,—the great family Bible . It was not open at any chapter or consoling verse ; but at the page whereon were registered the births of her nine children . Five had died in infancy,—sacrificed to the cruel system which forbade the mother to suckle her babies . Four had lived longer ; Urian had been the first to die , Ughtred - Mortimar , Earl Ludlow , the last . My lady did not cry , Mrs. Medlicott said . She was quite composed ; very still , very silent . She put aside everything that savoured of mere business : sent people to Mr. Horner for that . But she was proudly alive to every possible form which might do honour to the last of her race . In those days , expresses were slow things , and forms still slower . Before my lady ’s directions could reach Vienna , my lord was buried . There was some talk ( so Mrs. Medlicott said ) about taking the body up , and bringing him to Hanbury . But his executors,—connections on the Ludlow side,—demurred to this . If he were removed to England , he must be carried on to Scotland , and interred with his Monkshaven forefathers . My lady , deeply hurt , withdrew from the discussion , before it degenerated to an unseemly contest . But all the more , for this understood mortification of my lady ’s , did the whole village and estate of Hanbury assume every outward sign of mourning . The church bells tolled morning and evening . The church itself was draped in black inside . Hatchments were placed everywhere , where hatchments could be put . All the tenantry spoke in hushed voices for more than a week , scarcely daring to observe that all flesh , even that of an Earl Ludlow , and the last of the Hanburys , was but grass after all . The very Fighting Lion closed its front door , front shutters it had none , and those who needed drink stole in at the back , and were silent and maudlin over their cups , instead of riotous and noisy . Miss Galindo ’s eyes were swollen up with crying , and she told me , with a fresh burst of tears , that even hump - backed Sally had been found sobbing over her Bible , and using a pocket - handkerchief for the first time in her life ; her aprons having hitherto stood her in the necessary stead , but not being sufficiently in accordance with etiquette to be used when mourning over an earl ’s premature decease . If it was this way out of the Hall , “
70872	71156	70862	70862	you	2474	” as Miss Galindo used to say , and judge what it was in the Hall . We none of us spoke but in a whisper : we tried not to eat ; and indeed the shock had been so really great , and we did really care so much for my lady , that for some days we had but little appetite . But after that , I fear our sympathy grew weaker , while our flesh grew stronger . But we still spoke low , and our hearts ached whenever we thought of my lady sitting there alone in the darkened room , with the light ever falling on that one solemn page . We wished , O how I wished that she would see Mr. Gray ! But Adams said , she thought my lady ought to have a bishop come to see her . Still no one had authority enough to send for one . Mr. Horner all this time was suffering as much as any one . He was too faithful a servant of the great Hanbury family , though now the family had dwindled down to a fragile old lady , not to mourn acutely over its probable extinction . He had , besides , a deeper sympathy and reverence with , and for , my lady , in all things , than probably he ever cared to show , for his manners were always measured and cold . He suffered from sorrow . He also suffered from wrong . My lord ’s executors kept writing to him continually . My lady refused to listen to mere business , saying she intrusted all to him . But the “
71158	71511	71512	71512	I	0	” was more complicated than I ever thoroughly understood . As far as I comprehended the case , it was something of this kind:—There had been a mortgage raised on my lady ’s property of Hanbury , to enable my lord , her husband , to spend money in cultivating his Scotch estates , after some new fashion that required capital . As long as my lord , her son , lived , who was to succeed to both the estates after her death , this did not signify ; so she had said and felt ; and she had refused to take any steps to secure the repayment of capital , or even the payment of the interest of the mortgage from the possible representatives and possessors of the Scotch estates , to the possible owner of the Hanbury property ; saying it ill became her to calculate on the contingency of her son ’s death . But he had died childless , unmarried . The heir of the Monkshaven property was an Edinburgh advocate , a far - away kinsman of my lord ’s : the Hanbury property , at my lady ’s death , would go to the descendants of a third son of the Squire Hanbury in the days of Queen Anne . This complication of affairs was most grievous to Mr. Horner . He had always been opposed to the mortgage ; had hated the payment of the interest , as obliging my lady to practise certain economies which , though she took care to make them as personal as possible , he disliked as derogatory to the family . Poor Mr. Horner ! He was so cold and hard in his manner , so curt and decisive in his speech , that I do n’t think we any of us did him justice . Miss Galindo was almost the first , at this time , to speak a kind word of him , or to take thought of him at all , any farther than to get out of his way when we saw him approaching . “
71521	71540	71541	71541	He	238	” she said one day ; about three weeks after we had heard of my lord ’s death . “
71560	71981	71541	71541	He	238	” But I thought no more of it , as Miss Galindo did not name it again . My lady came amongst us once more . From elderly she had become old ; a little , frail , old lady , in heavy black drapery , never speaking about nor alluding to her great sorrow ; quieter , gentler , paler than ever before ; and her eyes dim with much weeping , never witnessed by mortal . She had seen Mr. Gray at the expiration of the month of deep retirement . But I do not think that even to him she had said one word of her own particular individual sorrow . All mention of it seemed buried deep for evermore . One day , Mr. Horner sent word that he was too much indisposed to attend to his usual business at the Hall ; but he wrote down some directions and requests to Miss Galindo , saying that he would be at his office early the next morning . The next morning he was dead . Miss Galindo told my lady . Miss Galindo herself cried plentifully , but my lady , although very much distressed , could not cry . It seemed a physical impossibility , as if she had shed all the tears in her power . Moreover , I almost think her wonder was far greater that she herself lived than that Mr. Horner died . It was almost natural that so faithful a servant should break his heart , when the family he belonged to lost their stay , their heir , and their last hope . Yes ! Mr. Horner was a faithful servant . I do not think there are many so faithful now ; but perhaps that is an old woman ’s fancy of mine . When his will came to be examined , it was discovered that , soon after Harry Gregson ’s accident , Mr. Horner had left the few thousands ( three , I think , ) of which he was possessed , in trust for Harry ’s benefit , desiring his executors to see that the lad was well educated in certain things , for which Mr. Horner had thought that he had shown especial aptitude ; and there was a kind of implied apology to my lady in one sentence where he stated that Harry ’s lameness would prevent his being ever able to gain his living by the exercise of any mere bodily faculties , “
71991	71997	71987	71995	a lady whose wishes ” he , the testator	4204	” he , the testator , “
72003	72397	71987	71995	a lady whose wishes ” he , the testator	4204	” But there was a codicil in the will , dated since Lord Ludlow ’s death — feebly written by Mr. Horner himself , as if in preparation only for some more formal manner of bequest : or , perhaps , only as a mere temporary arrangement till he could see a lawyer , and have a fresh will made . In this he revoked his previous bequest to Harry Gregson . He only left two hundred pounds to Mr. Gray to be used , as that gentleman thought best , for Henry Gregson ’s benefit . With this one exception , he bequeathed all the rest of his savings to my lady , with a hope that they might form a nest - egg , as it were , towards the paying off of the mortgage which had been such a grief to him during his life . I may not repeat all this in lawyer ’s phrase ; I heard it through Miss Galindo , and she might make mistakes . Though , indeed , she was very clear - headed , and soon earned the respect of Mr. Smithson , my lady ’s lawyer from Warwick . Mr. Smithson knew Miss Galindo a little before , both personally and by reputation ; but I do n’t think he was prepared to find her installed as steward ’s clerk , and , at first , he was inclined to treat her , in this capacity , with polite contempt . But Miss Galindo was both a lady and a spirited , sensible woman , and she could put aside her self - indulgence in eccentricity of speech and manner whenever she chose . Nay more ; she was usually so talkative , that if she had not been amusing and warm - hearted , one might have thought her wearisome occasionally . But to meet Mr. Smithson she came out daily in her Sunday gown ; she said no more than was required in answer to his questions ; her books and papers were in thorough order , and methodically kept ; her statements of matters - of - fact accurate , and to be relied on . She was amusingly conscious of her victory over his contempt of a woman - clerk and his preconceived opinion of her unpractical eccentricity . “
72402	72418	71987	71995	a lady whose wishes ” he , the testator	4204	” said she , one day when she came in to sit awhile with me . “
72787	73028	72785	72785	you	3052	” But though Mr. Smithson might be satisfied with Miss Galindo , I am afraid she was the only part of the affair with which he was content . Everything else went wrong . I could not say who told me so — but the conviction of this seemed to pervade the house . I never knew how much we had all looked up to the silent , gruff Mr. Horner for decisions , until he was gone . My lady herself was a pretty good woman of business , as women of business go . Her father , seeing that she would be the heiress of the Hanbury property , had given her a training which was thought unusual in those days , and she liked to feel herself queen regnant , and to have to decide in all cases between herself and her tenantry . But , perhaps , Mr. Horner would have done it more wisely ; not but what she always attended to him at last . She would begin by saying , pretty clearly and promptly , what she would have done , and what she would not have done . If Mr. Horner approved of it , he bowed , and set about obeying her directly ; if he disapproved of it , he bowed , and lingered so long before he obeyed her , that she forced his opinion out of him with her “
73043	73671	73037	73037	you	238	” For she always understood his silence as well as if he had spoken . But the estate was pressed for ready money , and Mr. Horner had grown gloomy and languid since the death of his wife , and even his own personal affairs were not in the order in which they had been a year or two before , for his old clerk had gradually become superannuated , or , at any rate , unable by the superfluity of his own energy and wit to supply the spirit that was wanting in Mr. Horner . Day after day Mr. Smithson seemed to grow more fidgety , more annoyed at the state of affairs . Like every one else employed by Lady Ludlow , as far as I could learn , he had an hereditary tie to the Hanbury family . As long as the Smithsons had been lawyers , they had been lawyers to the Hanburys ; always coming in on all great family occasions , and better able to understand the characters , and connect the links of what had once been a large and scattered family , than any individual thereof had ever been . As long as a man was at the head of the Hanburys , the lawyers had simply acted as servants , and had only given their advice when it was required . But they had assumed a different position on the memorable occasion of the mortgage : they had remonstrated against it . My lady had resented this remonstrance , and a slight , unspoken coolness had existed between her and the father of this Mr. Smithson ever since . I was very sorry for my lady . Mr. Smithson was inclined to blame Mr. Horner for the disorderly state in which he found some of the outlying farms , and for the deficiencies in the annual payment of rents . Mr. Smithson had too much good feeling to put this blame into words ; but my lady ’s quick instinct led her to reply to a thought , the existence of which she perceived ; and she quietly told the truth , and explained how she had interfered repeatedly to prevent Mr. Horner from taking certain desirable steps , which were discordant to her hereditary sense of right and wrong between landlord and tenant . She also spoke of the want of ready money as a misfortune that could be remedied , by more economical personal expenditure on her own part ; by which individual saving , it was possible that a reduction of fifty pounds a year might have been accomplished . But as soon as Mr. Smithson touched on larger economies , such as either affected the welfare of others , or the honour and standing of the great House of Hanbury , she was inflexible . Her establishment consisted of somewhere about forty servants , of whom nearly as many as twenty were unable to perform their work properly , and yet would have been hurt if they had been dismissed ; so they had the credit of fulfilling duties , while my lady paid and kept their substitutes . Mr. Smithson made a calculation , and would have saved some hundreds a year by pensioning off these old servants . But my lady would not hear of it . Then , again , I know privately that he urged her to allow some of us to return to our homes . Bitterly we should have regretted the separation from Lady Ludlow ; but we would have gone back gladly , had we known at the time that her circumstances required it : but she would not listen to the proposal for a moment . “
73756	73871	73747	73747	We	2496	” As she spoke , she entered the room where I lay . She and Mr. Smithson were coming for some papers contained in the bureau . They did not know I was there , and Mr. Smithson started a little when he saw me , as he must have been aware that I had overheard something . But my lady did not change a muscle of her face . All the world might overhear her kind , just , pure sayings , and she had no fear of their misconstruction . She came up to me , and kissed me on the forehead , and then went to search for the required papers . “
73973	73974	73926	73926	I	0	” “
73980	73985	73926	73926	I	0	” asked my lady . “
74157	74158	74162	74162	Brooke	252	” “
74170	74180	74162	74162	Brooke	252	” said my lady in her most icy tone . “
74207	74239	74196	74196	I	0	” If her ladyship thought by this speech to quench Mr. Smithson she was mistaken . Mr. Smithson just looked at the letters , and went on with the old subject . “
74319	74353	74354	74354	You	0	” Lady Ludlow fixed her eyes on Mr. Smithson as he spoke , and never took them off his face until he had ended . She was silent a minute before she answered . “
74417	74418	74419	74421	A Captain James	2520	” “
74437	74438	74440	74440	he	253	” “

74535	74575	74525	74525	You	0	” continued my lady . ( I never could tell how far it was simplicity , or how far a kind of innocent malice , that made her misinterpret Mr. Smithson ’s words and looks as she did . ) “

74728	74876	74715	74715	I	0	” There was no more to be said , after my lady spoke in this manner . I had heard her mention Captain James before , as a middy who had been very kind to her son Urian . I thought I remembered then , that she had mentioned that his family circumstances were not very prosperous . But , I confess , that little as I knew of the management of land , I quite sided with Mr. Smithson . He , silently prohibited from again speaking to my lady on the subject , opened his mind to Miss Galindo , from whom I was pretty sure to hear all the opinions and news of the household and village . She had taken a great fancy to me , because she said I talked so agreeably . I believe it was because I listened so well . “
74885	74889	74880	74880	you	2535	” she began , “
75062	75069	75070	75070	I	0	” said she , correcting herself ; “
75079	75080	75070	75070	I	0	” “
75091	75094	75083	75083	you	0	” asked I. “

75187	75671	75672	75672	My	0	” However , come he did . In a month from that time , the carriage was sent to meet Captain James ; just as three years before it had been sent to meet me . His coming had been so much talked about that we were all as curious as possible to see him , and to know how so unusual an experiment , as it seemed to us , would answer . But , before I tell you anything about our new agent , I must speak of something quite as interesting , and I really think quite as important . And this was my lady ’s making friends with Harry Gregson . I do believe she did it for Mr. Horner ’s sake ; but , of course , I can only conjecture why my lady did anything . But I heard one day , from Mary Legard , that my lady had sent for Harry to come and see her , if he was well enough to walk so far ; and the next day he was shown into the room he had been in once before under such unlucky circumstances . The lad looked pale enough , as he stood propping himself up on his crutch , and the instant my lady saw him , she bade John Footman place a stool for him to sit down upon while she spoke to him . It might be his paleness that gave his whole face a more refined and gentle look ; but I suspect it was that the boy was apt to take impressions , and that Mr. Horner ’s grave , dignified ways , and Mr. Gray ’s tender and quiet manners , had altered him ; and then the thoughts of illness and death seem to turn many of us into gentlemen , and gentlewomen , as long as such thoughts are in our minds . We can not speak loudly or angrily at such times ; we are not apt to be eager about mere worldly things , for our very awe at our quickened sense of the nearness of the invisible world , makes us calm and serene about the petty trifles of to - day . At least , I know that was the explanation Mr. Gray once gave me of what we all thought the great improvement in Harry Gregson ’s way of behaving . My lady hesitated so long about what she had best say , that Harry grew a little frightened at her silence . A few months ago it would have surprised me more than it did now ; but since my lord her son ’s death , she had seemed altered in many ways,—more uncertain and distrustful of herself , as it were . At last she said , and I think the tears were in her eyes : “
75692	75702	75689	75689	you	2551	” To this there was nothing to be said but “
75705	75712	75689	75689	you	2551	” and again there was silence . “
75727	75740	75724	75725	Mr. Horner	238	” The boy ’s lips worked , and I think he said , “
75746	75763	75724	75725	Mr. Horner	238	” But I ca n’t be sure ; at any rate , my lady went on : “
75815	75849	75850	75851	Mr. Gray	113	” There was no sign of eager joy on the lad ’s face , as if he realised the power and pleasure of having what to him must have seemed like a fortune . “
75864	75865	75855	75855	he	113	” “
75876	75877	75868	75868	he	113	” “
75890	75903	75879	75879	I	0	” he burst out , sobbing as if his heart would break . “
75984	76014	76016	76017	Mr. Horner	238	” ( and now I understood what my lady had been making up her mind to say to Harry , all the time she was hesitating how to begin ) “
76128	76181	76119	76119	me	0	” said she , questioning Harry ’s face . He had left off crying , and was trying to understand , with all his might and main ; and I think he had got a pretty good general idea of the state of affairs ; though probably he was puzzled by the term “
76188	76216	76119	76119	me	0	” But he was sufficiently interested to want my lady to go on ; and he nodded his head at her , to signify this to her . “
76290	76294	76278	76278	I	0	” She paused . “
76514	76598	76621	76621	father	2579	” Harry could make no answer , though I am sure he understood it all . My lady wanted to get him to talk to her a little , by way of becoming acquainted with what was passing in his mind ; and she asked him what he would like to have done with his money , if he could have part of it now ? To such a simple question , involving no talk about feelings , his answer came readily enough . “
76707	76730	76746	76747	Mr. Brooks	258	” Harry knew nothing of my lady ’s part in the affair ; that was very clear . My lady kept silence . “
76795	76796	76792	76793	the schoolmaster	2588	” “
76803	76808	76792	76793	the schoolmaster	2588	” said my lady . “

76847	76862	76844	76845	my lady	336	” I exclaimed , almost thinking she did not know what she was saying . “
76950	76951	76944	76944	Tommy	257	” “
76958	76964	76944	76944	Tommy	257	” asked Harry , eagerly . “
76971	76978	76944	76944	Tommy	257	” said my lady , amused . “
76995	77014	77015	77015	He	113	” And now to return to Captain James . My first account of him was from Miss Galindo . “
77179	77180	77171	77171	I	0	” “
77190	77191	77188	77188	he	113	” “
77243	77445	77454	77454	my	0	” But when it came to Miss Galindo ’s leaving , there was a great misunderstanding between her and my lady . Miss Galindo had imagined that my lady had asked her as a favour to copy the letters , and enter the accounts , and had agreed to do the work without the notion of being paid for so doing . She had , now and then , grieved over a very profitable order for needlework passing out of her hands on account of her not having time to do it , because of her occupation at the Hall ; but she had never hinted this to my lady , but gone on cheerfully at her writing as long as her clerkship was required . My lady was annoyed that she had not made her intention of paying Miss Galindo more clear , in the first conversation she had had with her ; but I suppose that she had been too delicate to be very explicit with regard to money matters ; and now Miss Galindo was quite hurt at my lady ’s wanting to pay her for what she had done in such right - down good - will . “
77448	77453	77454	77454	my	0	” Miss Galindo said ; “
77680	77681	77671	77671	she	260	” “
77686	77691	77671	77671	she	260	” replied my lady , “
77729	77730	77715	77715	you	215	” “
77756	77757	77743	77743	I	0	” “
77763	77768	77761	77761	Bessy	260	” asked my lady . “
77805	78653	78655	78656	the king	633	” CHAPTER XIII . I had always understood that Miss Galindo had once been in much better circumstances , but I had never liked to ask any questions respecting her . But about this time many things came out respecting her former life , which I will try and arrange : not however , in the order in which I heard them , but rather as they occurred . Miss Galindo was the daughter of a clergyman in Westmoreland . Her father was the younger brother of a baronet , his ancestor having been one of those of James the First ’s creation . This baronet - uncle of Miss Galindo was one of the queer , out - of - the - way people who were bred at that time , and in that northern district of England . I never heard much of him from any one , besides this one great fact : that he had early disappeared from his family , which indeed only consisted of a brother and sister who died unmarried , and lived no one knew where,—somewhere on the Continent , it was supposed , for he had never returned from the grand tour which he had been sent to make , according to the general fashion of the day , as soon as he had left Oxford . He corresponded occasionally with his brother the clergyman ; but the letters passed through a banker ’s hands ; the banker being pledged to secrecy , and , as he told Mr. Galindo , having the penalty , if he broke his pledge , of losing the whole profitable business , and of having the management of the baronet ’s affairs taken out of his hands , without any advantage accruing to the inquirer , for Sir Lawrence had told Messrs. Graham that , in case his place of residence was revealed by them , not only would he cease to bank with them , but instantly take measures to baffle any future inquiries as to his whereabouts , by removing to some distant country . Sir Lawrence paid a certain sum of money to his brother ’s account every year ; but the time of this payment varied , and it was sometimes eighteen or nineteen months between the deposits ; then , again , it would not be above a quarter of the time , showing that he intended it to be annual , but , as this intention was never expressed in words , it was impossible to rely upon it , and a great deal of this money was swallowed up by the necessity Mr. Galindo felt himself under of living in the large , old , rambling family mansion , which had been one of Sir Lawrence ’s rarely expressed desires . Mr. and Mrs. Galindo often planned to live upon their own small fortune and the income derived from the living ( a vicarage , of which the great tithes went to Sir Lawrence as lay impropriator ) , so as to put - by the payments made by the baronet , for the benefit of Laurentia — our Miss Galindo . But I suppose they found it difficult to live economically in a large house , even though they had it rent free . They had to keep up with hereditary neighbours and friends , and could hardly help doing it in the hereditary manner . One of these neighbours , a Mr. Gibson , had a son a few years older than Laurentia . The families were sufficiently intimate for the young people to see a good deal of each other : and I was told that this young Mr. Mark Gibson was an unusually prepossessing man ( he seemed to have impressed every one who spoke of him to me as being a handsome , manly , kind - hearted fellow ) , just what a girl would be sure to find most agreeable . The parents either forgot that their children were growing up to man ’s and woman ’s estate , or thought that the intimacy and probable attachment would be no bad thing , even if it did lead to a marriage . Still , nothing was ever said by young Gibson till later on , when it was too late , as it turned out . He went to and from Oxford ; he shot and fished with Mr. Galindo , or came to the Mere to skate in winter - time ; was asked to accompany Mr. Galindo to the Hall , as the latter returned to the quiet dinner with his wife and daughter ; and so , and so , it went on , nobody much knew how , until one day , when Mr. Galindo received a formal letter from his brother ’s bankers , announcing Sir Lawrence ’s death , of malaria fever , at Albano , and congratulating Sir Hubert on his accession to the estates and the baronetcy . The king is dead—“Long
78658	79534	78655	78656	the king	633	” as I have since heard that the French express it . Sir Hubert and his wife were greatly surprised . Sir Lawrence was but two years older than his brother ; and they had never heard of any illness till they heard of his death . They were sorry ; very much shocked ; but still a little elated at the succession to the baronetcy and estates . The London bankers had managed everything well . There was a large sum of ready money in their hands , at Sir Hubert ’s service , until he should touch his rents , the rent - roll being eight thousand a - year . And only Laurentia to inherit it all ! Her mother , a poor clergyman ’s daughter , began to plan all sorts of fine marriages for her ; nor was her father much behind his wife in his ambition . They took her up to London , when they went to buy new carriages , and dresses , and furniture . And it was then and there she made my lady ’s acquaintance . How it was that they came to take a fancy to each other , I can not say . My lady was of the old nobility,—grand , compose , gentle , and stately in her ways . Miss Galindo must always have been hurried in her manner , and her energy must have shown itself in inquisitiveness and oddness even in her youth . But I do n’t pretend to account for things : I only narrate them . And the fact was this:—that the elegant , fastidious countess was attracted to the country girl , who on her part almost worshipped my lady . My lady ’s notice of their daughter made her parents think , I suppose , that there was no match that she might not command ; she , the heiress of eight thousand a - year , and visiting about among earls and dukes . So when they came back to their old Westmoreland Hall , and Mark Gibson rode over to offer his hand and his heart , and prospective estate of nine hundred a - year , to his old companion and playfellow , Laurentia , Sir Hubert and Lady Galindo made very short work of it . They refused him plumply themselves ; and when he begged to be allowed to speak to Laurentia , they found some excuse for refusing him the opportunity of so doing , until they had talked to her themselves , and brought up every argument and fact in their power to convince her — a plain girl , and conscious of her plainness — that Mr. Mark Gibson had never thought of her in the way of marriage till after her father ’s accession to his fortune ; and that it was the estate — not the young lady — that he was in love with . I suppose it will never be known in this world how far this supposition of theirs was true . My Lady Ludlow had always spoken as if it was ; but perhaps events , which came to her knowledge about this time , altered her opinion . At any rate , the end of it was , Laurentia refused Mark , and almost broke her heart in doing so . He discovered the suspicions of Sir Hubert and Lady Galindo , and that they had persuaded their daughter to share in them . So he flung off with high words , saying that they did not know a true heart when they met with one ; and that although he had never offered till after Sir Lawrence ’s death , yet that his father knew all along that he had been attached to Laurentia , only that he , being the eldest of five children , and having as yet no profession , had had to conceal , rather than to express , an attachment , which , in those days , he had believed was reciprocated . He had always meant to study for the bar , and the end of all he had hoped for had been to earn a moderate income , which he might ask Laurentia to share . This , or something like it , was what he said . But his reference to his father cut two ways . Old Mr. Gibson was known to be very keen about money . It was just as likely that he would urge Mark to make love to the heiress , now she was an heiress , as that he would have restrained him previously , as Mark said he had done . When this was repeated to Mark , he became proudly reserved , or sullen , and said that Laurentia , at any rate , might have known him better . He left the country , and went up to London to study law soon afterwards ; and Sir Hubert and Lady Galindo thought they were well rid of him . But Laurentia never ceased reproaching herself , and never did to her dying day , as I believe . The words , “
79542	81380	79535	79535	She	2618	” told to her by some kind friend or other , rankled in her mind , and were never forgotten . Her father and mother took her up to London the next year ; but she did not care to visit — dreaded going out even for a drive , lest she should see Mark Gibson ’s reproachful eyes — pined and lost her health . Lady Ludlow saw this change with regret , and was told the cause by Lady Galindo , who of course , gave her own version of Mark ’s conduct and motives . My lady never spoke to Miss Galindo about it , but tried constantly to interest and please her . It was at this time that my lady told Miss Galindo so much about her own early life , and about Hanbury , that Miss Galindo resolved , if ever she could , she would go and see the old place which her friend loved so well . The end of it all was , that she came to live there , as we know . But a great change was to come first . Before Sir Hubert and Lady Galindo had left London on this , their second visit , they had a letter from the lawyer , whom they employed , saying that Sir Lawrence had left an heir , his legitimate child by an Italian woman of low rank ; at least , legal claims to the title and property had been sent into him on the boy ’s behalf . Sir Lawrence had always been a man of adventurous and artistic , rather than of luxurious tastes ; and it was supposed , when all came to be proved at the trial , that he was captivated by the free , beautiful life they lead in Italy , and had married this Neapolitan fisherman ’s daughter , who had people about her shrewd enough to see that the ceremony was legally performed . She and her husband had wandered about the shores of the Mediterranean for years , leading a happy , careless , irresponsible life , unencumbered by any duties except those connected with a rather numerous family . It was enough for her that they never wanted money , and that her husband ’s love was always continued to her . She hated the name of England — wicked , cold , heretic England — and avoided the mention of any subjects connected with her husband ’s early life . So that , when he died at Albano , she was almost roused out of her vehement grief to anger with the Italian doctor , who declared that he must write to a certain address to announce the death of Lawrence Galindo . For some time , she feared lest English barbarians might come down upon her , making a claim to the children . She hid herself and them in the Abruzzi , living upon the sale of what furniture and jewels Sir Lawrence had died possessed of . When these failed , she returned to Naples , which she had not visited since her marriage . Her father was dead ; but her brother inherited some of his keenness . He interested the priests , who made inquiries and found that the Galindo succession was worth securing to an heir of the true faith . They stirred about it , obtained advice at the English Embassy ; and hence that letter to the lawyers , calling upon Sir Hubert to relinquish title and property , and to refund what money he had expended . He was vehement in his opposition to this claim . He could not bear to think of his brother having married a foreigner — a papist , a fisherman ’s daughter ; nay , of his having become a papist himself . He was in despair at the thought of his ancestral property going to the issue of such a marriage . He fought tooth and nail , making enemies of his relations , and losing almost all his own private property ; for he would go on against the lawyer ’s advice , long after every one was convinced except himself and his wife . At last he was conquered . He gave up his living in gloomy despair . He would have changed his name if he could , so desirous was he to obliterate all tie between himself and the mongrel papist baronet and his Italian mother , and all the succession of children and nurses who came to take possession of the Hall soon after Mr. Hubert Galindo ’s departure , stayed there one winter , and then flitted back to Naples with gladness and delight . Mr. and Mrs. Hubert Galindo lived in London . He had obtained a curacy somewhere in the city . They would have been thankful now if Mr. Mark Gibson had renewed his offer . No one could accuse him of mercenary motives if he had done so . Because he did not come forward , as they wished , they brought his silence up as a justification of what they had previously attributed to him . I do n’t know what Miss Galindo thought herself ; but Lady Ludlow has told me how she shrank from hearing her parents abuse him . Lady Ludlow supposed that he was aware that they were living in London . His father must have known the fact , and it was curious if he had never named it to his son . Besides , the name was very uncommon ; and it was unlikely that it should never come across him , in the advertisements of charity sermons which the new and rather eloquent curate of Saint Mark ’s East was asked to preach . All this time Lady Ludlow never lost sight of them , for Miss Galindo ’s sake . And when the father and mother died , it was my lady who upheld Miss Galindo in her determination not to apply for any provision to her cousin , the Italian baronet , but rather to live upon the hundred a - year which had been settled on her mother and the children of his son Hubert ’s marriage by the old grandfather , Sir Lawrence . Mr. Mark Gibson had risen to some eminence as a barrister on the Northern Circuit , but had died unmarried in the lifetime of his father , a victim ( so people said ) to intemperance . Doctor Trevor , the physician who had been called in to Mr. Gray and Harry Gregson , had married a sister of his . And that was all my lady knew about the Gibson family . But who was Bessy ? That mystery and secret came out , too , in process of time . Miss Galindo had been to Warwick , some years before I arrived at Hanbury , on some kind of business or shopping , which can only be transacted in a county town . There was an old Westmoreland connection between her and Mrs. Trevor , though I believe the latter was too young to have been made aware of her brother ’s offer to Miss Galindo at the time when it took place ; and such affairs , if they are unsuccessful , are seldom spoken about in the gentleman ’s family afterwards . But the Gibsons and Galindos had been county neighbours too long for the connection not to be kept up between two members settled far away from their early homes . Miss Galindo always desired her parcels to be sent to Dr. Trevor ’s , when she went to Warwick for shopping purchases . If she were going any journey , and the coach did not come through Warwick as soon as she arrived ( in my lady ’s coach or otherwise ) from Hanbury , she went to Doctor Trevor ’s to wait . She was as much expected to sit down to the household meals as if she had been one of the family : and in after - years it was Mrs. Trevor who managed her repository business for her . So , on the day I spoke of , she had gone to Doctor Trevor ’s to rest , and possibly to dine . The post in those times , came in at all hours of the morning : and Doctor Trevor ’s letters had not arrived until after his departure on his morning round . Miss Galindo was sitting down to dinner with Mrs. Trevor and her seven children , when the Doctor came in . He was flurried and uncomfortable , and hurried the children away as soon as he decently could . Then ( rather feeling Miss Galindo ’s presence an advantage , both as a present restraint on the violence of his wife ’s grief , and as a consoler when he was absent on his afternoon round ) , he told Mrs. Trevor of her brother ’s death . He had been taken ill on circuit , and had hurried back to his chambers in London only to die . She cried terribly ; but Doctor Trevor said afterwards , he never noticed that Miss Galindo cared much about it one way or another . She helped him to soothe his wife , promised to stay with her all the afternoon instead of returning to Hanbury , and afterwards offered to remain with her while the Doctor went to attend the funeral . When they heard of the old love - story between the dead man and Miss Galindo,—brought up by mutual friends in Westmoreland , in the review which we are all inclined to take of the events of a man ’s life when he comes to die,—they tried to remember Miss Galindo ’s speeches and ways of going on during this visit . She was a little pale , a little silent ; her eyes were sometimes swollen , and her nose red ; but she was at an age when such appearances are generally attributed to a bad cold in the head , rather than to any more sentimental reason . They felt towards her as towards an old friend , a kindly , useful , eccentric old maid . She did not expect more , or wish them to remember that she might once have had other hopes , and more youthful feelings . Doctor Trevor thanked her very warmly for staying with his wife , when he returned home from London ( where the funeral had taken place ) . He begged Miss Galindo to stay with them , when the children were gone to bed , and she was preparing to leave the husband and wife by themselves . He told her and his wife many particulars — then paused — then went on—“And
81391	81398	81400	81401	Mrs. Trevor	272	“ But he never was married ! ”
81403	81408	81410	81411	her husband	729	“ A little girl , ”
81413	81465	81410	81411	her husband	729	“ whose mother , I conclude , is dead . At any rate , the child was in possession of his chambers ; she and an old nurse , who seemed to have the charge of everything , and has cheated poor Mark , I should fancy , not a little . ”
81466	81471	81473	81474	Mrs. Trevor	272	“ But the child ! ”
81482	81491	81473	81474	Mrs. Trevor	272	“ How do you know it is his ? ”
81492	81601	81410	81411	her husband	729	“ The nurse told me it was , with great appearance of indignation at my doubting it . I asked the little thing her name , and all I could get was ‘ Bessy ! ’ and a cry of ‘ Me wants papa ! ’ The nurse said the mother was dead , and she knew no more about it than that Mr. Gibson had engaged her to take care of the little girl , calling it his child . One or two of his lawyer friends , whom I met with at the funeral , told me they were aware of the existence of the child . ”
81602	81611	81613	81614	Mrs. Gibson	275	“ What is to be done with her ? ”
81616	81624	81626	81626	he	2622	“ Nay , I do n’t know , ”
81628	81650	81626	81626	he	2622	“ Mark has hardly left assets enough to pay his debts , and your father is not inclined to come forward . ”
82455	82464	82453	82454	Miss Galindo	215	“ had a cold and could not come . ”
82473	82478	82453	82454	Miss Galindo	215	“ had an engagement at home”—a

84043	84086	84037	84037	she	336	“ This is well , Mr. Gray . I am much pleased . You are fortunate in your schoolmistress . She has had both proper knowledge of womanly things and much patience . Who is she ? One out of our village ? ”
84087	84091	84093	84094	Mr. Gray	113	“ My lady , ”
84104	84129	84093	84094	Mr. Gray	113	“ Miss Bessy is so very kind as to teach all those sorts of things — Miss Bessy , and Miss Galindo , sometimes . ”
84145	84149	84140	84140	she	336	“ Miss Bessy , ”
84272	84281	84283	84284	my lady	336	“ I think there must be some mistake , ”
84286	84328	84283	84284	my lady	336	“ or I have misunderstood you . Captain James would never be sufficiently with a schismatic to be employed by that man Brooke in distributing his charities . I should have doubted , until now , if Captain James knew him . ”
84329	84375	84376	84377	My lady	336	“ Indeed , my lady , he not only knows him , but is intimate with him , I regret to say . I have repeatedly seen the captain and Mr. Brooke walking together ; going through the fields together ; and people do say — ”
84388	84414	84376	84377	My lady	336	“ I disapprove of gossip , and it may be untrue ; but people do say that Captain James is very attentive to Miss Brooke . ”
84415	84418	84420	84421	my lady	336	“ Impossible ! ”
84425	84447	84420	84421	my lady	336	“ Captain James is a loyal and religious man . I beg your pardon Mr. Gray , but it is impossible . ”
84671	84676	84649	84649	she	336	“ that man Brooke . ”
84710	84900	84901	84901	My	0	“ He said once that he was anxious to bring in the Norfolk system of cropping , and spoke a good deal about Mr. Coke of Holkham ( who , by the way , was no more a Coke than I am — collateral in the female line — which counts for little or nothing among the great old commoners ’ families of pure blood ) , and his new ways of cultivation ; of course new men bring in new ways , but it does not follow that either are better than the old ways . However , Captain James has been very anxious to try turnips and bone manure , and he really is a man of such good sense and energy , and was so sorry last year about the failure , that I consented ; and now I begin to see my error . I have always heard that town bakers adulterate their flour with bone - dust ; and , of course , Captain James would be aware of this , and go to Brooke to inquire where the article was to be purchased . ”

85431	85445	85447	85448	Captain James	253	“ shut his eyes and ran and butted at it like a ram , ”

85487	85496	85482	85482	they	2794	“ where his reverence would next turn up . ”
86946	86952	86954	86954	she	260	“ You will play well , ”
86956	86985	86954	86954	she	260	“ You have only learnt about six months , have you ? And yet you can nearly beat me , who have been at it as many years . ”
86986	87014	86954	86954	she	260	“ I began to learn last November . I remember Mr. Gray ’s bringing me ‘ Philidor on Chess , ’ one very foggy , dismal day . ”
87104	87169	87091	87091	her	336	“ I could not — I can not believe it . He must be aware she is a schismatic ; a baker ’s daughter ; and he is a gentleman by virtue and feeling , as well as by his profession , though his manners may be at times a little rough . My dear Miss Galindo , what will this world come to ? ”
87273	87573	87270	87270	she	215	“ Indeed , my lady , I have long left off trying to conjecture what makes Jack fancy Gill , or Gill Jack . It ’s best to sit down quiet under the belief that marriages are made for us , somewhere out of this world , and out of the range of this world ’s reason and laws . I ’m not so sure that I should settle it down that they were made in heaven ; t’other place seems to me as likely a workshop ; but at any rate , I ’ve given up troubling my head as to why they take place . Captain James is a gentleman ; I make no doubt of that ever since I saw him stop to pick up old Goody Blake ( when she tumbled down on the slide last winter ) and then swear at a little lad who was laughing at her , and cuff him till he tumbled down crying ; but we must have bread somehow , and though I like it better baked at home in a good sweet brick oven , yet , as some folks never can get it to rise , I do n’t see why a man may not be a baker . You see , my lady , I look upon baking as a simple trade , and as such lawful . There is no machine comes in to take away a man ’s or woman ’s power of earning their living , like the spinning - jenny ( the old busybody that she is ) , to knock up all our good old women ’s livelihood , and send them to their graves before their time . There ’s an invention of the enemy , if you will ! ”
87574	87580	87586	87586	her	336	“ That ’s very true ! ”
87589	87823	87586	87586	her	336	“ But baking bread is wholesome , straightforward elbow - work . They have not got to inventing any contrivance for that yet , thank Heaven ! It does not seem to me natural , nor according to Scripture , that iron and steel ( whose brows ca n’t sweat ) should be made to do man ’s work . And so I say , all those trades where iron and steel do the work ordained to man at the Fall , are unlawful , and I never stand up for them . But say this baker Brooke did knead his bread , and make it rise , and then that people , who had , perhaps , no good ovens , came to him , and bought his good light bread , and in this manner he turned an honest penny and got rich ; why , all I say , my lady , is this,—I dare say he would have been born a Hanbury , or a lord if he could ; and if he was not , it is no fault of his , that I can see , that he made good bread ( being a baker by trade ) , and got money , and bought his land . It was his misfortune , not his fault , that he was not a person of quality by birth . ”
87824	87830	87832	87833	my lady	336	“ That ’s very true , ”
87843	87878	87832	87833	my lady	336	“ But , although he was a baker , he might have been a Churchman . Even your eloquence , Miss Galindo , sha n’t convince me that that is not his own fault . ”
87879	87894	87896	87897	Miss Galindo	215	“ I do n’t see even that , begging your pardon , my lady , ”
87908	87956	87896	87897	Miss Galindo	215	“ When a Baptist is a baby , if I understand their creed aright , he is not baptized ; and , consequently , he can have no godfathers and godmothers to do anything for him in his baptism ; you agree to that , my lady ? ”
87993	88165	87983	87983	she	336	“ And , you know , our godfathers and godmothers are expected to promise and vow three things in our name , when we are little babies , and can do nothing but squall for ourselves . It is a great privilege , but do n’t let us be hard upon those who have not had the chance of godfathers and godmothers . Some people , we know , are born with silver spoons,—that ’s to say , a godfather to give one things , and teach one ’s catechism , and see that we ’re confirmed into good church - going Christians,—and others with wooden ladles in their mouths . These poor last folks must just be content to be godfatherless orphans , and Dissenters , all their lives ; and if they are tradespeople into the bargain , so much the worse for them ; but let us be humble Christians , my dear lady , and not hold our heads too high because we were born orthodox quality . ”
88166	88233	88234	88235	My lady	336	“ You go on too fast , Miss Galindo ! I ca n’t follow you . Besides , I do believe dissent to be an invention of the Devil ’s . Why ca n’t they believe as we do ? It ’s very wrong . Besides , its schism and heresy , and , you know , the Bible says that ’s as bad as witchcraft . ”
88280	88362	88251	88251	she	336	“ If Captain James comes to - morrow , I will speak to him about these Brookes . I have not hitherto liked to speak to him , because I did not wish to hurt him , by supposing there could be any truth in the reports about his intimacy with them . But now I will try and do my duty by him and them . Surely this great body of divinity will bring them back to the true church . ”
