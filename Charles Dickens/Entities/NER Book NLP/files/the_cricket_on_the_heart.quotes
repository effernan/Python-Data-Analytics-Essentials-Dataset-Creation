2177	2190	2146	2160	a certain person who , on the instant , approached towards it through the gloom	115	‘ Welcome home , old fellow ! Welcome home , my boy ! ’
2388	2394	2396	2397	Mrs. P.	18	‘ Oh goodness , John ! ’
2398	2409	2410	2410	He	123	‘ What a state you are in with the weather ! ’
2449	2457	2458	2458	John	17	‘ Why , you see , Dot , ’
2479	2493	2465	2465	he	17	‘ it — it an’t exactly summer weather . So , no wonder . ’
2494	2512	2514	2515	Mrs. Peerybingle	12	‘ I wish you would n’t call me Dot , John . I do n’t like it , ’
2534	2541	2543	2543	John	17	‘ Why what else are you ? ’
2570	2614	2615	2615	He	17	‘ A dot and’—here he glanced at the baby—‘a dot and carry — I wo n’t say it , for fear I should spoil it ; but I was very near a joke . I do n’t know as ever I was nearer . ’
2995	3011	2946	2946	he	21	‘ An’t he beautiful , John ? Do n’t he look precious in his sleep ? ’
3012	3016	3018	3018	John	21	‘ Very precious , ’
3020	3035	2946	2946	he	21	‘ Very much so . He generally _ is _ asleep , an’t he ? ’
3036	3045	2946	2946	he	21	‘ Lor , John ! Good gracious no ! ’
3046	3049	3051	3051	John	21	‘ Oh , ’
3055	3066	3051	3051	John	21	‘ I thought his eyes was generally shut . Halloa ! ’
3067	3077	2946	2946	he	21	‘ Goodness , John , how you startle one ! ’
3078	3086	3051	3051	John	21	‘ It an’t right for him to turn ’em
3092	3098	2946	2946	he	21	’ said the astonished Carrier , ‘
3110	3131	3051	3051	John	21	’em at once ! And look at his mouth ! Why he ’s gasping like a gold and silver fish ! ’
3132	3146	3148	3148	Dot	19	‘ You do n’t deserve to be a father , you do n’t , ’
3159	3189	3148	3148	Dot	19	‘ But how should you know what little complaints children are troubled with , John ! You would n’t so much as know their names , you stupid fellow . ’
3221	3224	3226	3226	John	21	‘ No , ’
3234	3285	3226	3226	John	21	‘ It ’s very true , Dot . I do n’t know much about it . I only know that I ’ve been fighting pretty stiffly with the wind to - night . It ’s been blowing north - east , straight into the cart , the whole way home . ’
3286	3295	3297	3298	Mrs. Peerybingle	12	‘ Poor old man , so it has ! ’
3305	3409	3297	3298	Mrs. Peerybingle	12	‘ Here ! Take the precious darling , Tilly , while I make myself of some use . Bless it , I could smother it with kissing it , I could ! Hie then , good dog ! Hie , Boxer , boy ! Only let me make the tea first , John ; and then I ’ll help you with the parcels , like a busy bee . “ How doth the little”—and all the rest of it , you know , John . Did you ever learn “ how doth the little , ” when you went to school , John ? ’
3410	3417	3418	3418	John	21	‘ Not to quite know it , ’
3421	3441	3418	3418	John	21	‘ I was very near it once . But I should only have spoilt it , I dare say . ’
3442	3446	3448	3448	Dot	19	‘ Ha ha , ’
3460	3478	3450	3450	She	19	‘ What a dear old darling of a dunce you are , John , to be sure ! ’
3737	3750	3752	3752	Dot	19	‘ There ! There ’s the teapot , ready on the hob ! ’
3766	3818	3752	3752	Dot	19	‘ And there ’s the old knuckle of ham ; and there ’s the butter ; and there ’s the crusty loaf , and all ! Here ’s the clothes - basket for the small parcels , John , if you ’ve got any there — where are you , John ? ’
3819	3837	3752	3752	Dot	19	‘ Do n’t let the dear child fall under the grate , Tilly , whatever you do ! ’
4229	4232	4234	4234	John	21	‘ Heyday ! ’
4241	4255	4237	4237	his	21	‘ It ’s merrier than ever , to - night , I think . ’
4256	4292	4293	4293	John	21	‘ And it ’s sure to bring us good fortune , John ! It always has done so . To have a Cricket on the Hearth , is the luckiest thing in all the world ! ’
4341	4388	4337	4337	he	21	‘ The first time I heard its cheerful little note , John , was on that night when you brought me home — when you brought me to my new home here ; its little mistress . Nearly a year ago . You recollect , John ? ’
4400	4463	4464	4464	John	21	‘ Its chirp was such a welcome to me ! It seemed so full of promise and encouragement . It seemed to say , you would be kind and gentle with me , and would not expect ( I had a fear of that , John , then ) to find an old head on the shoulders of your foolish little wife . ’
4517	4575	4585	4586	the Carrier	132	‘ It spoke the truth , John , when it seemed to say so ; for you have ever been , I am sure , the best , the most considerate , the most affectionate of husbands to me . This has been a happy home , John ; and I love the Cricket for its sake ! ’
4576	4583	4585	4586	the Carrier	132	‘ Why so do I then , ’
4588	4595	4585	4586	the Carrier	132	‘ So do I , Dot . ’
4596	4849	4585	4586	the Carrier	132	‘ I love it for the many times I have heard it , and the many thoughts its harmless music has given me . Sometimes , in the twilight , when I have felt a little solitary and down - hearted , John — before baby was here to keep me company and make the house gay — when I have thought how lonely you would be if I should die ; how lonely I should be if I could know that you had lost me , dear ; its Chirp , Chirp , Chirp upon the hearth , has seemed to tell me of another little voice , so sweet , so very dear to me , before whose coming sound my trouble vanished like a dream . And when I used to fear — I did fear once , John , I was very young you know — that ours might prove to be an ill - assorted marriage , I being such a child , and you more like my guardian than my husband ; and that you might not , however hard you tried , be able to learn to love me , as you hoped and prayed you might ; its Chirp , Chirp , Chirp has cheered me up again , and filled me with new trust and confidence . I was thinking of these things to - night , dear , when I sat expecting you ; and I love the Cricket for their sake ! ’
4850	4856	4858	4858	John	21	‘ And so do I , ’
4860	4905	4906	4906	She	162	‘ But , Dot ? _ I _ hope and pray that I might learn to love you ? How you talk ! I had learnt that , long before I brought you here , to be the Cricket ’s little mistress , Dot ! ’
4961	5028	4939	4939	she	162	‘ There are not many of them to - night , John , but I saw some goods behind the cart , just now ; and though they give more trouble , perhaps , still they pay as well ; so we have no reason to grumble , have we ? Besides , you have been delivering , I dare say , as you came along ? ’
5029	5033	5034	5034	John	21	‘ Oh yes , ’
5037	5042	5034	5034	John	21	‘ A good many . ’
5043	5063	4939	4939	she	162	‘ Why what ’s this round box ? Heart alive , John , it ’s a wedding - cake ! ’
5064	5074	5076	5076	John	21	‘ Leave a woman alone to find out that , ’
5080	5156	5076	5076	John	21	‘ Now a man would never have thought of it . Whereas , it ’s my belief that if you was to pack a wedding - cake up in a tea - chest , or a turn - up bedstead , or a pickled salmon keg , or any unlikely thing , a woman would be sure to find it out directly . Yes ; I called for it at the pastry - cook ’s . ’
5157	5170	5172	5172	Dot	19	‘ And it weighs I do n’t know what — whole hundredweights ! ’
5184	5196	5076	5076	John	21	‘ Whose is it , John ? Where is it going ? ’
5197	5206	5208	5208	John	21	‘ Read the writing on the other side , ’
5210	5220	5208	5208	John	21	‘ Why , John ! My Goodness , John ! ’
5221	5230	5231	5231	John	21	‘ Ah ! who ’d have thought it ! ’
5234	5241	5243	5243	Dot	19	‘ You never mean to say , ’
5256	5266	5267	5267	John	21	‘ that it ’s Gruff and Tackleton the toymaker ! ’
5422	5431	5433	5433	Dot	19	‘ And that is really to come about ! ’
5435	5449	5433	5433	Dot	19	‘ Why , she and I were girls at school together , John . ’
5490	5515	5485	5485	he	172	‘ And he ’s as old ! As unlike her!—Why , how many years older than you , is Gruff and Tackleton , John ? ’
5516	5545	5547	5547	John	21	‘ How many more cups of tea shall I drink to - night at one sitting , than Gruff and Tackleton ever took in four , I wonder ! ’
5570	5588	5554	5554	he	21	‘ As to eating , I eat but little ; but that little I enjoy , Dot . ’
5780	5794	5795	5795	she	173	‘ So , these are all the parcels , are they , John ? ’
5839	5853	5795	5795	she	173	‘ So , these are all the parcels ; are they , John ? ’
5854	5859	5861	5861	John	21	‘ That ’s all , ’
5863	5870	5861	5861	John	21	‘ Why — no — I — ’
5884	5895	5861	5861	John	21	‘ I declare — I’ve clean forgotten the old gentleman ! ’
5896	5901	5795	5795	she	173	‘ The old gentleman ? ’
5902	5907	5909	5909	John	21	‘ In the cart , ’
5911	5963	5964	5964	John	21	‘ He was asleep , among the straw , the last time I saw him . I ’ve very nearly remembered him , twice , since I came in ; but he went out of my head again . Halloa ! Yahip there ! Rouse up ! That ’s my hearty ! ’
6161	6163	6139	6139	he	771	‘ You ’re
6172	6202	6139	6139	he	771	’ said John , when tranquillity was restored ; in the mean time the old gentleman had stood , bareheaded and motionless , in the centre of the room ; ‘
6237	6246	6381	6381	I	0	’ murmured the Carrier , with a chuckle ; ‘
6250	6363	6381	6381	I	0	’ The Stranger , who had long white hair , good features , singularly bold and well defined for an old man , and dark , bright , penetrating eyes , looked round with a smile , and saluted the Carrier ’s wife by gravely inclining his head . His garb was very quaint and odd — a long , long way behind the time . Its hue was brown , all over . In his hand he held a great brown club or walking - stick ; and striking this upon the floor , it fell asunder , and became a chair . On which he sat down , quite composedly . ‘
6366	6376	6381	6381	I	0	’ said the Carrier , turning to his wife . ‘
6400	6401	6392	6398	a milestone . And almost as deaf	185	’ ‘
6410	6411	6408	6408	John	21	’ ‘
6417	6422	6408	6408	John	21	’ replied the Carrier , ‘
6450	6451	6447	6447	he	183	’ ‘
6461	6473	6456	6456	John	21	’ Not at all . He was only going to speak . ‘
6487	6494	6478	6478	I	0	’ said the Stranger , mildly . ‘
6500	6571	6498	6498	me	0	’ With that , he took a pair of spectacles from one of his large pockets , and a book from another , and leisurely began to read . Making no more of Boxer than if he had been a house lamb ! The Carrier and his wife exchanged a look of perplexity . The Stranger raised his head ; and glancing from the latter to the former , said , ‘
6579	6580	6581	6581	Wife	188	’ ‘
6583	6587	6588	6588	Niece	189	’ returned John . ‘
6590	6595	6596	6596	Wife	188	’ said the Stranger . ‘
6598	6602	6596	6596	Wife	188	’ roared John . ‘
6605	6610	6596	6596	Wife	188	’ observed the Stranger . ‘
6616	6644	6645	6645	Baby	30	’ He quietly turned over , and resumed his reading . But , before he could have read two lines , he again interrupted himself to say : ‘
6649	6671	6672	6672	Girl	191	’ John gave him a gigantic nod ; equivalent to an answer in the affirmative , delivered through a speaking trumpet . ‘
6674	6675	6672	6672	Girl	191	’ ‘
6682	6686	6687	6689	Also very young	192	’ roared John . ‘
6693	6700	6687	6689	Also very young	192	’ Mrs. Peerybingle instantly struck in . ‘
6777	6827	6828	6828	Ketcher	31	’ Here the breathless little mother , who had been shrieking these short sentences into the old man ’s ear , until her pretty face was crimsoned , held up the Baby before him as a stubborn and triumphant fact ; while Tilly Slowboy , with a melodious cry of ‘
6855	6866	6868	6868	John	21	‘ Hark ! He ’s called for , sure enough , ’
6870	6883	6868	6868	John	21	‘ There ’s somebody at the door . Open it , Tilly . ’
7036	7042	7044	7046	the little man	204	‘ Good evening , John ! ’
7048	7077	7044	7046	the little man	204	‘ Good evening , Mum . Good evening , Tilly . Good evening , Unbeknown ! How ’s Baby , Mum ? Boxer ’s pretty well I hope ? ’
7078	7084	7086	7086	Dot	19	‘ All thriving , Caleb , ’
7088	7108	7086	7086	Dot	19	‘ I am sure you need only look at the dear child , for one , to know that . ’
7109	7112	7044	7046	the little man	204	‘ And I ’m
7123	7172	7114	7114	I	0	’ said Caleb . He did n’t look at her though ; he had a wandering and thoughtful eye which seemed to be always projecting itself into some other time and place , no matter what he said ; a description which will equally apply to his voice . ‘
7179	7183	7175	7175	John	21	’ said Caleb . ‘
7199	7200	7205	7205	Caleb	34	’ ‘
7207	7212	7205	7205	Caleb	34	’ asked the Carrier . ‘
7220	7244	7218	7218	John	21	’ he returned , with the distraught air of a man who was casting about for the Philosopher ’s stone , at least . ‘
7342	7376	7330	7330	you	21	’ The Carrier put his hand into a pocket of the coat he had taken off ; and brought out , carefully preserved in moss and paper , a tiny flower - pot . ‘
7381	7391	7330	7330	you	21	’ he said , adjusting it with great care . ‘
7404	7420	7330	7330	you	21	’ Caleb ’s dull eye brightened , as he took it , and thanked him . ‘
7425	7430	7423	7423	Caleb	34	’ said the Carrier . ‘
7437	7438	7423	7423	Caleb	34	’ ‘
7454	7460	7464	7464	John	21	’ returned the little man . ‘
7466	7467	7464	7464	John	21	’ ‘
7472	7477	7464	7464	John	21	’ replied the Carrier . ‘
7482	7483	7479	7479	you	21	’ ‘
7490	7501	7479	7479	you	21	’ said the little man , spelling out the direction . ‘
7521	7522	7512	7512	I	0	’ ‘
7526	7536	7512	7512	I	0	’ returned the Carrier , looking over his shoulder . ‘
7544	7545	7539	7539	you	21	’ ‘
7552	7556	7539	7539	you	21	’ said Caleb . ‘
7645	7666	7679	7680	the Carrier	132	’ eyes for my daughter ’s work . I wish it was her own sight in a box , John . ’
7667	7677	7679	7680	the Carrier	132	‘ I wish it was , or could be ! ’
7682	7685	7687	7689	the little man	204	‘ Thank’ee , ’
7691	7735	7687	7689	the little man	204	‘ You speak very hearty . To think that she should never see the Dolls — and them a - staring at her , so bold , all day long ! That ’s where it cuts . What ’s the damage , John ? ’
7736	7742	7744	7744	John	21	‘ I ’ll damage you , ’
7746	7756	7744	7744	John	21	‘ if you inquire . Dot ! Very near ? ’
7757	7768	7770	7772	the little man	204	‘ Well ! it ’s like you to say so , ’
7774	7791	7770	7772	the little man	204	‘ It ’s your kind way . Let me see . I think that ’s all . ’
7792	7797	7799	7800	the Carrier	132	‘ I think not , ’
7802	7806	7799	7800	the Carrier	132	‘ Try again . ’
7807	7815	7817	7817	Caleb	34	‘ Something for our Governor , eh ? ’
7825	7858	7817	7817	Caleb	34	‘ To be sure . That ’s what I came for ; but my head ’s so running on them Arks and things ! He has n’t been here , has he ? ’
7859	7863	7865	7866	the Carrier	132	‘ Not he , ’
7868	7876	7865	7866	the Carrier	132	‘ He ’s too busy , courting . ’
7877	7884	7886	7886	Caleb	34	‘ He ’s coming round though , ’
7888	7948	7886	7886	Caleb	34	‘ for he told me to keep on the near side of the road going home , and it was ten to one he ’d take me up . I had better go , by the bye.—You could n’t have the goodness to let me pinch Boxer ’s tail , Mum , for half a moment , could you ? ’
7949	7958	7865	7866	the Carrier	132	‘ Why , Caleb ! what a question ! ’
7959	7966	7968	7970	the little man	204	‘ Oh never mind , Mum , ’
7972	8003	7968	7970	the little man	204	‘ He might n’t like it perhaps . There ’s a small order just come in , for barking dogs ; and I should wish to go as close to Natur ’
8020	8095	8018	8018	Mum	33	’ It happened opportunely , that Boxer , without receiving the proposed stimulus , began to bark with great zeal . But , as this implied the approach of some new visitor , Caleb , postponing his study from the life to a more convenient season , shouldered the round box , and took a hurried leave . He might have spared himself the trouble , for he met the visitor upon the threshold . ‘
8145	8155	8115	8116	John Peerybingle	17	’ mused the speaker , in a low voice ; ‘
8163	8164	8165	8165	I	0	’ ‘
8177	8190	8174	8175	Mr. Tackleton	41	’ said Dot , not with the best grace in the world ; ‘
8196	8197	8198	8198	You	0	’ ‘
8205	8206	8198	8198	You	0	’ ‘
8217	8221	8210	8210	myself	0	’ said Dot . ‘
8230	8231	8210	8210	myself	0	’ ‘
8234	8456	8210	8210	myself	0	’ Tackleton the Toy - merchant , pretty generally known as Gruff and Tackleton — for that was the firm , though Gruff had been bought out long ago ; only leaving his name , and as some said his nature , according to its Dictionary meaning , in the business — Tackleton the Toy - merchant , was a man whose vocation had been quite misunderstood by his Parents and Guardians . If they had made him a Money Lender , or a sharp Attorney , or a Sheriff ’s Officer , or a Broker , he might have sown his discontented oats in his youth , and , after having had the full run of himself in ill - natured transactions , might have turned out amiable , at last , for the sake of a little freshness and novelty . But , cramped and chafing in the peaceable pursuit of toy - making , he was a domestic Ogre , who had been living on children all his life , and was their implacable enemy . He despised all toys ; would n’t have bought one for the world ; delighted , in his malice , to insinuate grim expressions into the faces of brown - paper farmers who drove pigs to market , bellmen who advertised lost lawyers ’
8900	8904	8895	8895	he	220	‘ In three days ’
8928	8971	8974	8974	my	0	’ said Tackleton . Did I mention that he had always one eye wide open , and one eye nearly shut ; and that the one eye nearly shut , was always the expressive eye ? I do n’t think I did . ‘
8979	8987	8974	8974	my	0	’ said Tackleton , rattling his money . ‘
8998	9003	8974	8974	my	0	’ exclaimed the Carrier . ‘
9007	9011	8974	8974	my	0	’ laughed Tackleton . ‘
9015	9023	9014	9014	You	238	’re just such another couple . Just ! ’
9060	9069	9071	9071	Tackleton	41	‘ I say ! A word with you , ’
9087	9096	9071	9071	Tackleton	41	‘ You ’ll come to the wedding ? We ’re

9113	9118	9071	9071	Tackleton	41	’ inquired the Carrier . ‘
9126	9134	9071	9071	Tackleton	41	’ said Tackleton , with another nudge . ‘
9145	9146	9071	9071	Tackleton	41	’ ‘
9149	9159	9071	9071	Tackleton	41	’ demanded John , astonished at this pressing hospitality . ‘

9554	9583	9547	9547	his	835	‘ You ’ll say you ’ll come ? It ’s as much your interest as mine , you know , that the women should persuade each other that they ’re

9700	9711	9681	9681	you	263	’ cried Tackleton , with a short , sharp laugh . ‘
9716	9726	9681	9681	you	263	’ The Carrier had some faint idea of adding , ‘
9731	9788	9681	9681	you	263	’ But , happening to meet the half - closed eye , as it twinkled upon him over the turned - up collar of the cape , which was within an ace of poking it out , he felt it such an unlikely part and parcel of anything to be doted on , that he substituted , ‘
9796	9797	9790	9790	she	842	’ ‘
9803	9806	9808	9808	Tackleton	41	’re joking , ’
9844	9850	9852	9852	Tackleton	41	‘ I have the humour , ’
9870	9879	9859	9859	his	41	‘ there I am , Tackleton to wit : ’
9880	9899	9901	9901	he	41	‘ I have the humour , sir , to marry a young wife , and a pretty wife : ’
9924	9926	9901	9901	he	41	‘ I ’m
9947	9998	9999	9999	She	266	’ He pointed to where Dot was sitting , thoughtfully , before the fire ; leaning her dimpled chin upon her hand , and watching the bright blaze . The Carrier looked at her , and then at him , and then at her , and then at him again . ‘
10010	10014	9999	9999	She	266	’ said Tackleton ; ‘
10046	10047	10048	10048	I	0	’ ‘
10051	10056	10048	10048	I	0	’ observed the Carrier , ‘

10078	10089	10048	10048	I	0	’ returned the other with an unusual alacrity of assent . ‘
10102	10113	10101	10101	I	0	’m certain of it . Good night . Pleasant dreams ! ’
10141	10149	10151	10151	Tackleton	41	‘ Good night , my dear friend ! ’
10155	10157	10151	10151	Tackleton	41	‘ I ’m

10224	10297	10298	10298	Dot	19	’ It was a loud cry from the Carrier ’s wife : a loud , sharp , sudden cry , that made the room ring , like a glass vessel . She had risen from her seat , and stood like one transfixed by terror and surprise . The Stranger had advanced towards the fire to warm himself , and stood within a short stride of her chair . But quite still . ‘
10300	10305	10306	10306	Mary	46	’ cried the Carrier . ‘
10315	10363	10364	10364	Mary	46	’ They were all about her in a moment . Caleb , who had been dozing on the cake - box , in the first imperfect recovery of his suspended presence of mind , seized Miss Slowboy by the hair of her head , but immediately apologised . ‘
10366	10377	10364	10364	Mary	46	’ exclaimed the Carrier , supporting her in his arms . ‘
10391	10481	10482	10482	I	0	’ She only answered by beating her hands together , and falling into a wild fit of laughter . Then , sinking from his grasp upon the ground , she covered her face with her apron , and wept bitterly . And then she laughed again , and then she cried again , and then she said how cold it was , and suffered him to lead her to the fire , where she sat down as before . The old man standing , as before , quite still . ‘
10483	10488	10489	10489	she	0	’m better , John , ’
10492	10494	10489	10489	she	0	‘ I ’m

10505	10536	10503	10503	John	21	’ But John was on the other side of her . Why turn her face towards the strange old gentleman , as if addressing him ! Was her brain wandering ? ‘
10573	10574	10575	10575	I	0	’ ‘
10576	10582	10584	10584	Tackleton	41	’m glad it ’s gone , ’
10595	10623	10584	10584	Tackleton	41	‘ I wonder where it ’s gone , and what it was . Humph ! Caleb , come here ! Who ’s that with the grey hair ? ’
10624	10632	10634	10634	Caleb	34	‘ I do n’t know , sir , ’
10639	10680	10634	10634	Caleb	34	‘ Never see him before , in all my life . A beautiful figure for a nut - cracker ; quite a new model . With a screw - jaw opening down into his waistcoat , he ’d be lovely . ’
10681	10686	10688	10688	Tackleton	41	‘ Not ugly enough , ’
10690	10698	10700	10700	Caleb	34	‘ Or for a firebox , either , ’
10706	10745	10700	10700	Caleb	34	‘ what a model ! Unscrew his head to put the matches in ; turn him heels up’ards for the light ; and what a firebox for a gentleman ’s mantel - shelf , just as he stands ! ’
10746	10752	10754	10754	Tackleton	41	‘ Not half ugly enough , ’
10756	10776	10754	10754	Tackleton	41	‘ Nothing in him at all ! Come ! Bring that box ! All right now , I hope ? ’
10777	10785	10787	10789	the little woman	275	‘ Oh quite gone ! Quite gone ! ’
10796	10800	10787	10789	the little woman	275	‘ Good night ! ’
10801	10805	10807	10807	Tackleton	41	‘ Good night , ’
10809	10851	10807	10807	Tackleton	41	‘ Good night , John Peerybingle ! Take care how you carry that box , Caleb . Let it fall , and I ’ll murder you ! Dark as pitch , and weather worse than ever , eh ? Good night ! ’
10928	10939	10941	10941	John	17	‘ He do n’t belong to them , you see , ’
10943	10953	10941	10941	John	17	‘ I must give him a hint to go . ’
10954	10962	10964	10966	the old gentleman	771	‘ I beg your pardon , friend , ’
10972	10994	10995	10995	he	771	‘ the more so , as I fear your wife has not been well ; but the Attendant whom my infirmity , ’
11004	11066	10995	10995	he	771	‘ renders almost indispensable , not having arrived , I fear there must be some mistake . The bad night which made the shelter of your comfortable cart ( may I never have a worse ! ) so acceptable , is still as bad as ever . Would you , in your kindness , suffer me to rent a bed here ? ’
11067	11072	11074	11074	Dot	19	‘ Yes , yes , ’
11076	11081	11074	11074	Dot	19	‘ Yes ! Certainly ! ’
11082	11085	11087	11088	the Carrier	132	‘ Oh ! ’
11098	11110	11074	11074	Dot	19	‘ Well ! I do n’t object ; but , still I ’m
11116	11117	11087	11088	the Carrier	132	’ ‘
11120	11124	11125	11126	Dear John	17	’ she interrupted . ‘
11128	11129	11125	11126	Dear John	17	’ ‘
11137	11141	11132	11132	he	17	’ urged John . ‘
11171	11207	11169	11169	John	17	’ As she hurried off to do it , the flutter of her spirits , and the agitation of her manner , were so strange that the Carrier stood looking after her , quite confounded . ‘
11218	11226	11209	11210	its mothers	169	’ cried Miss Slowboy to the Baby ; ‘
11258	11365	11370	11372	a precious Pets	286	’ With that unaccountable attraction of the mind to trifles , which is often incidental to a state of doubt and confusion , the Carrier as he walked slowly to and fro , found himself mentally repeating even these absurd words , many times . So many times that he got them by heart , and was still conning them over and over , like a lesson , when Tilly , after administering as much friction to the little bald head with her hand as she thought wholesome ( according to the practice of nurses ) , had once more tied the Baby ’s cap on . ‘
11388	12045	12046	12047	Peerybingle Brothers	49	’ mused the Carrier , pacing to and fro . He scouted , from his heart , the insinuations of the Toy - merchant , and yet they filled him with a vague , indefinite uneasiness . For , Tackleton was quick and sly ; and he had that painful sense , himself , of being a man of slow perception , that a broken hint was always worrying to him . He certainly had no intention in his mind of linking anything that Tackleton had said , with the unusual conduct of his wife , but the two subjects of reflection came into his mind together , and he could not keep them asunder . The bed was soon made ready ; and the visitor , declining all refreshment but a cup of tea , retired . Then , Dot — quite well again , she said , quite well again — arranged the great chair in the chimney - corner for her husband ; filled his pipe and gave it him ; and took her usual little stool beside him on the hearth . She always _ would _ sit on that little stool . I think she must have had a kind of notion that it was a coaxing , wheedling little stool . She was , out and out , the very best filler of a pipe , I should say , in the four quarters of the globe . To see her put that chubby little finger in the bowl , and then blow down the pipe to clear the tube , and , when she had done so , affect to think that there was really something in the tube , and blow a dozen times , and hold it to her eye like a telescope , with a most provoking twist in her capital little face , as she looked down it , was quite a brilliant thing . As to the tobacco , she was perfect mistress of the subject ; and her lighting of the pipe , with a wisp of paper , when the Carrier had it in his mouth — going so very near his nose , and yet not scorching it — was Art , high Art . And the Cricket and the kettle , turning up again , acknowledged it ! The bright fire , blazing up again , acknowledged it ! The little Mower on the clock , in his unheeded work , acknowledged it ! The Carrier , in his smoothing forehead and expanding face , acknowledged it , the readiest of all . And as he soberly and thoughtfully puffed at his old pipe , and as the Dutch clock ticked , and as the red fire gleamed , and as the Cricket chirped ; that Genius of his Hearth and Home ( for such the Cricket was ) came out , in fairy shape , into the room , and summoned many forms of Home about him . Dots of all ages , and all sizes , filled the chamber . Dots who were merry children , running on before him gathering flowers , in the fields ; coy Dots , half shrinking from , half yielding to , the pleading of his own rough image ; newly - married Dots , alighting at the door , and taking wondering possession of the household keys ; motherly little Dots , attended by fictitious Slowboys , bearing babies to be christened ; matronly Dots , still young and blooming , watching Dots of daughters , as they danced at rustic balls ; fat Dots , encircled and beset by troops of rosy grandchildren ; withered Dots , who leaned on sticks , and tottered as they crept along . Old Carriers too , appeared , with blind old Boxers lying at their feet ; and newer carts with younger drivers ( ‘
12048	12192	11370	11372	a precious Pets	286	’ on the tilt ) ; and sick old Carriers , tended by the gentlest hands ; and graves of dead and gone old Carriers , green in the churchyard . And as the Cricket showed him all these things — he saw them plainly , though his eyes were fixed upon the fire — the Carrier ’s heart grew light and happy , and he thanked his Household Gods with all his might , and cared no more for Gruff and Tackleton than you do . * * * * * But , what was that young figure of a man , which the same Fairy Cricket set so near Her stool , and which remained there , singly and alone ? Why did it linger still , so near her , with its arm upon the chimney - piece , ever repeating ‘
12200	13802	11370	11372	a precious Pets	286	’ O Dot ! O failing Dot ! There is no place for it in all your husband ’s visions ; why has its shadow fallen on his hearth ! CHAPTER II — Chirp the Second Caleb Plummer and his Blind Daughter lived all alone by themselves , as the Story - books say — and my blessing , with yours to back it I hope , on the Story - books , for saying anything in this workaday world!—Caleb Plummer and his Blind Daughter lived all alone by themselves , in a little cracked nutshell of a wooden house , which was , in truth , no better than a pimple on the prominent red - brick nose of Gruff and Tackleton . The premises of Gruff and Tackleton were the great feature of the street ; but you might have knocked down Caleb Plummer ’s dwelling with a hammer or two , and carried off the pieces in a cart . If any one had done the dwelling - house of Caleb Plummer the honour to miss it after such an inroad , it would have been , no doubt , to commend its demolition as a vast improvement . It stuck to the premises of Gruff and Tackleton , like a barnacle to a ship ’s keel , or a snail to a door , or a little bunch of toadstools to the stem of a tree . But , it was the germ from which the full - grown trunk of Gruff and Tackleton had sprung ; and , under its crazy roof , the Gruff before last , had , in a small way , made toys for a generation of old boys and girls , who had played with them , and found them out , and broken them , and gone to sleep . I have said that Caleb and his poor Blind Daughter lived here . I should have said that Caleb lived here , and his poor Blind Daughter somewhere else — in an enchanted home of Caleb ’s furnishing , where scarcity and shabbiness were not , and trouble never entered . Caleb was no sorcerer , but in the only magic art that still remains to us , the magic of devoted , deathless love , Nature had been the mistress of his study ; and from her teaching , all the wonder came . The Blind Girl never knew that ceilings were discoloured , walls blotched and bare of plaster here and there , high crevices unstopped and widening every day , beams mouldering and tending downward . The Blind Girl never knew that iron was rusting , wood rotting , paper peeling off ; the size , and shape , and true proportion of the dwelling , withering away . The Blind Girl never knew that ugly shapes of delf and earthenware were on the board ; that sorrow and faintheartedness were in the house ; that Caleb ’s scanty hairs were turning greyer and more grey , before her sightless face . The Blind Girl never knew they had a master , cold , exacting , and uninterested — never knew that Tackleton was Tackleton in short ; but lived in the belief of an eccentric humourist who loved to have his jest with them , and who , while he was the Guardian Angel of their lives , disdained to hear one word of thankfulness . And all was Caleb ’s doing ; all the doing of her simple father ! But he too had a Cricket on his Hearth ; and listening sadly to its music when the motherless Blind Child was very young , that Spirit had inspired him with the thought that even her great deprivation might be almost changed into a blessing , and the girl made happy by these little means . For all the Cricket tribe are potent Spirits , even though the people who hold converse with them do not know it ( which is frequently the case ) ; and there are not in the unseen world , voices more gentle and more true , that may be so implicitly relied on , or that are so certain to give none but tenderest counsel , as the Voices in which the Spirits of the Fireside and the Hearth address themselves to human kind . Caleb and his daughter were at work together in their usual working - room , which served them for their ordinary living - room as well ; and a strange place it was . There were houses in it , finished and unfinished , for Dolls of all stations in life . Suburban tenements for Dolls of moderate means ; kitchens and single apartments for Dolls of the lower classes ; capital town residences for Dolls of high estate . Some of these establishments were already furnished according to estimate , with a view to the convenience of Dolls of limited income ; others could be fitted on the most expensive scale , at a moment ’s notice , from whole shelves of chairs and tables , sofas , bedsteads , and upholstery . The nobility and gentry , and public in general , for whose accommodation these tenements were designed , lay , here and there , in baskets , staring straight up at the ceiling ; but , in denoting their degrees in society , and confining them to their respective stations ( which experience shows to be lamentably difficult in real life ) , the makers of these Dolls had far improved on Nature , who is often froward and perverse ; for , they , not resting on such arbitrary marks as satin , cotton - print , and bits of rag , had superadded striking personal differences which allowed of no mistake . Thus , the Doll - lady of distinction had wax limbs of perfect symmetry ; but only she and her compeers . The next grade in the social scale being made of leather , and the next of coarse linen stuff . As to the common - people , they had just so many matches out of tinder - boxes , for their arms and legs , and there they were — established in their sphere at once , beyond the possibility of getting out of it . There were various other samples of his handicraft , besides Dolls , in Caleb Plummer ’s room . There were Noah ’s Arks , in which the Birds and Beasts were an uncommonly tight fit , I assure you ; though they could be crammed in , anyhow , at the roof , and rattled and shaken into the smallest compass . By a bold poetical licence , most of these Noah ’s Arks had knockers on the doors ; inconsistent appendages , perhaps , as suggestive of morning callers and a Postman , yet a pleasant finish to the outside of the building . There were scores of melancholy little carts , which , when the wheels went round , performed most doleful music . Many small fiddles , drums , and other instruments of torture ; no end of cannon , shields , swords , spears , and guns . There were little tumblers in red breeches , incessantly swarming up high obstacles of red - tape , and coming down , head first , on the other side ; and there were innumerable old gentlemen of respectable , not to say venerable , appearance , insanely flying over horizontal pegs , inserted , for the purpose , in their own street doors . There were beasts of all sorts ; horses , in particular , of every breed , from the spotted barrel on four pegs , with a small tippet for a mane , to the thoroughbred rocker on his highest mettle . As it would have been hard to count the dozens upon dozens of grotesque figures that were ever ready to commit all sorts of absurdities on the turning of a handle , so it would have been no easy task to mention any human folly , vice , or weakness , that had not its type , immediate or remote , in Caleb Plummer ’s room . And not in an exaggerated form , for very little handles will move men and women to as strange performances , as any Toy was ever made to undertake . In the midst of all these objects , Caleb and his daughter sat at work . The Blind Girl busy as a Doll ’s dressmaker ; Caleb painting and glazing the four - pair front of a desirable family mansion . The care imprinted in the lines of Caleb ’s face , and his absorbed and dreamy manner , which would have sat well on some alchemist or abstruse student , were at first sight an odd contrast to his occupation , and the trivialities about him . But , trivial things , invented and pursued for bread , become very serious matters of fact ; and , apart from this consideration , I am not at all prepared to say , myself , that if Caleb had been a Lord Chamberlain , or a Member of Parliament , or a lawyer , or even a great speculator , he would have dealt in toys one whit less whimsical , while I have a very great doubt whether they would have been as harmless . ‘
13823	13829	13816	13816	your	288	’ said Caleb ’s daughter . ‘
13838	13869	13816	13816	your	288	’ answered Caleb , glancing towards a clothes - line in the room , on which the sack - cloth garment previously described , was carefully hung up to dry . ‘
13880	13881	13874	13874	you	288	’ ‘
13890	13894	13874	13874	you	288	’ said Caleb . ‘

13964	14058	13956	13956	he	34	‘ upon my word ! When I hear the boys and people say behind me , “ Hal - loa ! Here ’s a swell ! ” I do n’t know which way to look . And when the beggar would n’t go away last night ; and when I said I was a very common man , said “ No , your Honour ! Bless your Honour , do n’t say that ! ” I was quite ashamed . I really felt as if I had n’t a right to wear it . ’
14072	14079	14080	14080	she	0	‘ I see you , father , ’
14087	14110	14080	14080	she	0	‘ as plainly , as if I had the eyes I never want when you are with me . A blue coat — ’

14119	14127	14129	14130	the girl	949	‘ Yes , yes ! Bright blue ! ’
14138	14163	14129	14130	the girl	949	‘ the colour I can just remember in the blessed sky ! You told me it was blue before ! A bright blue coat — ’
14164	14171	14173	14173	Caleb	34	‘ Made loose to the figure , ’
14175	14182	14184	14186	the Blind Girl	936	‘ Made loose to the figure ! ’
14191	14225	14184	14186	the Blind Girl	936	‘ and in it , you , dear father , with your merry eye , your smiling face , your free step , and your dark hair — looking so young and handsome ! ’
14226	14231	14233	14233	Caleb	34	‘ Halloa ! Halloa ! ’
14235	14243	14233	14233	Caleb	34	‘ I shall be vain , presently ! ’
14244	14252	14254	14256	the Blind Girl	936	‘ I think you are , already , ’
14266	14288	14263	14263	her	936	‘ I know you , father ! Ha , ha , ha ! I ’ve found you out , you see ! ’
14443	14448	14450	14450	Caleb	34	‘ There we are , ’
14467	14527	14450	14450	Caleb	34	‘ as near the real thing as sixpenn’orth of halfpence is to sixpence . What a pity that the whole front of the house opens at once ! If there was only a staircase in it , now , and regular doors to the rooms to go in at ! But that ’s the worst of my calling , I ’m

14555	14566	14544	14544	You	34	’ echoed Caleb , with a great burst of animation , ‘
14586	14683	14686	14686	You	34	’ To give the greater force to his words , he checked himself in an involuntary imitation of two half - length stretching and yawning figures on the mantel - shelf , who were represented as in one eternal state of weariness from the waist upwards ; and hummed a fragment of a song . It was a Bacchanalian song , something about a Sparkling Bowl . He sang it with an assumption of a Devil - may - care voice , that made his face a thousand times more meagre and more thoughtful than ever . ‘

14856	14860	14853	14853	they	303	’ grumbled Tackleton . ‘

14906	14913	14899	14899	he	34	’ whispered Caleb to his daughter . ‘

14930	14936	14899	14899	he	34	’ cried the smiling Bertha . ‘
14940	14946	14948	14948	Tackleton	27	’re there , are you ? ’
14950	14954	14955	14955	He	34	‘ Poor Idiot ! ’
14986	14995	14997	14997	Tackleton	27	‘ Well ! and being there,—how are you ? ’
15004	15038	15000	15000	his	27	‘ Oh ! well ; quite well . And as happy as even you can wish me to be . As happy as you would make the whole world , if you could ! ’
15039	15043	15045	15045	Tackleton	27	‘ Poor Idiot ! ’
15047	15057	15045	15045	Tackleton	27	‘ No gleam of reason . Not a gleam ! ’
15119	15126	15106	15106	himself	27	‘ What ’s the matter now ? ’
15127	15170	15256	15256	his	27	‘ I stood it close beside my pillow when I went to sleep last night , and remembered it in my dreams . And when the day broke , and the glorious red sun — the _ red _ sun , father ? ’
15171	15182	15184	15185	poor Caleb	34	‘ Red in the mornings and the evenings , Bertha , ’
15195	15246	15256	15256	his	27	‘ When it rose , and the bright light I almost fear to strike myself against in walking , came into the room , I turned the little tree towards it , and blessed Heaven for making things so precious , and blessed you for sending them to cheer me ! ’
15247	15252	15256	15256	his	27	‘ Bedlam broke loose ! ’
15259	15273	15256	15256	his	27	‘ We shall arrive at the strait - waistcoat and mufflers soon . We ’re
15277	15443	15444	15444	Bertha	62	’ Caleb , with his hands hooked loosely in each other , stared vacantly before him while his daughter spoke , as if he really were uncertain ( I believe he was ) whether Tackleton had done anything to deserve her thanks , or not . If he could have been a perfectly free agent , at that moment , required , on pain of death , to kick the Toy - merchant , or fall at his feet , according to his merits , I believe it would have been an even chance which course he would have taken . Yet , Caleb knew that with his own hands he had brought the little rose - tree home for her , so carefully , and that with his own lips he had forged the innocent deception which should help to keep her from suspecting how much , how very much , he every day , denied himself , that she might be the happier . ‘
15446	15460	15444	15444	Bertha	62	’ said Tackleton , assuming , for the nonce , a little cordiality . ‘
15464	15465	15444	15444	Bertha	62	’ ‘
15481	15485	15475	15475	You	310	’ she rejoined . ‘

15501	15522	15498	15498	you	310	’ she answered , eagerly . How bright the darkened face ! How adorned with light , the listening head ! ‘
15562	15577	15552	15552	her	313	’ said Tackleton , with a strong expression of distaste for the whole concern . ‘
15580	15584	15552	15552	her	313	’ replied Bertha . ‘

15636	15650	15632	15632	I	0	’ murmured Caleb , with the fixed look of a sleep - walker ; ‘

15729	15733	15723	15727	a con - founded Idiot	315	’ muttered Tackleton , ‘

15811	15822	15808	15808	I	0	’ replied the Blind Girl , in a gentle tone . ‘

15900	15925	15891	15891	You	0	’ she answered . She had drooped her head , and turned away ; and so stood , with her hands crossed , musing . ‘
15933	15941	15926	15926	I	0	’ muttered Tackleton , looking at her ; ‘
15956	15957	15954	15954	Caleb	34	’ ‘
15964	15970	15972	15972	Caleb	34	’m here , I suppose , ’
15974	15977	15972	15972	Caleb	34	‘ Sir ! ’
15978	15993	15954	15954	Caleb	34	‘ Take care she do n’t forget what I ’ve been saying to her . ’
15994	16001	16003	16003	Caleb	34	‘ _ She _ never forgets , ’
16005	16018	16003	16003	Caleb	34	‘ It ’s one of the few things she an’t clever in . ’
16019	16028	16030	16033	the Toy - merchant	816	‘ Every man thinks his own geese swans , ’
16039	16043	16046	16046	himself	816	‘ Poor devil ! ’
16171	16192	16154	16154	she	62	‘ Father , I am lonely in the dark . I want my eyes , my patient , willing eyes . ’
16193	16198	16200	16200	Caleb	34	‘ Here they are , ’
16202	16235	16154	16154	she	62	‘ Always ready . They are more yours than mine , Bertha , any hour in the four - and - twenty . What shall your eyes do for you , dear ? ’
16236	16244	16154	16154	she	62	‘ Look round the room , father . ’
16245	16249	16251	16251	Caleb	34	‘ All right , ’
16253	16262	16251	16251	Caleb	34	‘ No sooner said than done , Bertha . ’
16263	16269	16154	16154	she	62	‘ Tell me about it . ’
16270	16279	16281	16281	Caleb	34	‘ It ’s much the same as usual , ’
16283	16331	16281	16281	Caleb	34	‘ Homely , but very snug . The gay colours on the walls ; the bright flowers on the plates and dishes ; the shining wood , where there are beams or panels ; the general cheerfulness and neatness of the building ; make it very pretty . ’
16367	16388	16390	16390	Bertha	62	‘ You have your working dress on , and are not so gallant as when you wear the handsome coat ? ’
16395	16401	16403	16403	Caleb	34	‘ Not quite so gallant , ’
16405	16410	16403	16403	Caleb	34	‘ Pretty brisk though . ’
16411	16414	16416	16418	the Blind Girl	936	‘ Father , ’
16434	16446	16416	16418	the Blind Girl	936	‘ tell me something about May . She is very fair ? ’
16447	16452	16454	16454	Caleb	34	‘ She is indeed , ’
16479	16485	16487	16487	Bertha	62	‘ Her hair is dark , ’
16491	16517	16487	16487	Bertha	62	‘ darker than mine . Her voice is sweet and musical , I know . I have often loved to hear it . Her shape — ’
16518	16533	16535	16535	Caleb	34	‘ There ’s not a Doll ’s in all the room to equal it , ’
16537	16543	16544	16544	He	34	‘ And her eyes ! — ’
16605	16631	16632	16632	she	62	‘ Our friend , father , our benefactor . I am never tired , you know , of hearing about him.—Now , was I ever ? ’
16637	16642	16644	16644	Caleb	34	‘ Of course not , ’
16646	16651	16644	16644	Caleb	34	‘ and with reason . ’
16652	16660	16662	16664	the Blind Girl	936	‘ Ah ! With how much reason ! ’
16705	16717	16719	16719	Bertha	62	‘ Then , tell me again about him , dear father , ’
16721	16771	16719	16719	Bertha	62	‘ Many times again ! His face is benevolent , kind , and tender . Honest and true , I am sure it is . The manly heart that tries to cloak all favours with a show of roughness and unwillingness , beats in its every look and glance . ’
16772	16778	16780	16780	Caleb	34	‘ And makes it noble ! ’
16787	16793	16795	16797	the Blind Girl	936	‘ And makes it noble ! ’
16799	16808	16795	16797	the Blind Girl	936	‘ He is older than May , father . ’
16809	16814	16816	16816	Caleb	34	‘ Ye - es , ’
16820	16835	16816	16816	Caleb	34	‘ He ’s a little older than May . But that do n’t signify . ’
16836	16929	16795	16797	the Blind Girl	936	‘ Oh father , yes ! To be his patient companion in infirmity and age ; to be his gentle nurse in sickness , and his constant friend in suffering and sorrow ; to know no weariness in working for his sake ; to watch him , tend him , sit beside his bed and talk to him awake , and pray for him asleep ; what privileges these would be ! What opportunities for proving all her truth and devotion to him ! Would she do all this , dear father ? ‘
16935	16939	16795	16797	the Blind Girl	936	’ said Caleb . ‘
16954	17485	17486	17486	John	17	’ exclaimed the Blind Girl . And saying so , she laid her poor blind face on Caleb ’s shoulder , and so wept and wept , that he was almost sorry to have brought that tearful happiness upon her . In the mean time , there had been a pretty sharp commotion at John Peerybingle ’s , for little Mrs. Peerybingle naturally could n’t think of going anywhere without the Baby ; and to get the Baby under weigh took time . Not that there was much of the Baby , speaking of it as a thing of weight and measure , but there was a vast deal to do about and about it , and it all had to be done by easy stages . For instance , when the Baby was got , by hook and by crook , to a certain point of dressing , and you might have rationally supposed that another touch or two would finish him off , and turn him out a tip - top Baby challenging the world , he was unexpectedly extinguished in a flannel cap , and hustled off to bed ; where he simmered ( so to speak ) between two blankets for the best part of an hour . From this state of inaction he was then recalled , shining very much and roaring violently , to partake of — well ? I would rather say , if you ’ll permit me to speak generally — of a slight repast . After which , he went to sleep again . Mrs. Peerybingle took advantage of this interval , to make herself as smart in a small way as ever you saw anybody in all your life ; and , during the same short truce , Miss Slowboy insinuated herself into a spencer of a fashion so surprising and ingenious , that it had no connection with herself , or anything else in the universe , but was a shrunken , dog’s - eared , independent fact , pursuing its lonely course without the least regard to anybody . By this time , the Baby , being all alive again , was invested , by the united efforts of Mrs. Peerybingle and Miss Slowboy , with a cream - coloured mantle for its body , and a sort of nankeen raised - pie for its head ; and so in course of time they all three got down to the door , where the old horse had already taken more than the full value of his day ’s toll out of the Turnpike Trust , by tearing up the road with his impatient autographs ; and whence Boxer might be dimly seen in the remote perspective , standing looking back , and tempting him to come on without orders . As to a chair , or anything of that kind for helping Mrs. Peerybingle into the cart , you know very little of John , if you think _ that _ was necessary . Before you could have seen him lift her from the ground , there she was in her place , fresh and rosy , saying , ‘
17498	17585	17586	17586	John	17	’ If I might be allowed to mention a young lady ’s legs , on any terms , I would observe of Miss Slowboy ’s that there was a fatality about them which rendered them singularly liable to be grazed ; and that she never effected the smallest ascent or descent , without recording the circumstance upon them with a notch , as Robinson Crusoe marked the days upon his wooden calendar . But as this might be considered ungenteel , I ’ll think of it . ‘
17609	17613	17588	17588	You	17	’ said Dot . ‘
17629	17630	17631	17631	You	17	’ ‘
17632	17638	17640	17641	the Carrier	132	’re a nice little article , ’
17643	17664	17640	17641	the Carrier	132	‘ to be talking about turning round , after keeping me a full quarter of an hour behind my time . ’
17665	17674	17676	17676	Dot	19	‘ I am sorry for it , John , ’
17682	17724	17676	17676	Dot	19	‘ but I really could not think of going to Bertha’s — I would not do it , John , on any account — without the Veal and Ham - Pie and things , and the bottles of Beer . Way ! ’
17741	17750	17752	17753	Mrs. Peerybingle	12	‘ Oh _ do _ way , John ! ’
17755	17758	17752	17753	Mrs. Peerybingle	12	‘ Please ! ’
17759	17769	17771	17771	John	17	‘ It ’ll be time enough to do that , ’
17773	17791	17771	17771	John	17	‘ when I begin to leave things behind me . The basket ’s here , safe enough . ’
17792	17894	17752	17753	Mrs. Peerybingle	12	‘ What a hard - hearted monster you must be , John , not to have said so , at once , and save me such a turn ! I declared I would n’t go to Bertha ’s without the Veal and Ham - Pie and things , and the bottles of Beer , for any money . Regularly once a fortnight ever since we have been married , John , have we made our little Pic - Nic there . If anything was to go wrong with it , I should almost think we were never to be lucky again . ’
17895	17906	17908	17909	the Carrier	132	‘ It was a kind thought in the first instance , ’
17911	17922	17908	17909	the Carrier	132	‘ and I honour you for it , little woman . ’
17923	17928	17930	17930	Dot	19	‘ My dear John , ’
17936	17949	17930	17930	Dot	19	‘ do n’t talk about honouring _ me _ . Good Gracious ! ’
17950	17955	17957	17958	the Carrier	132	‘ By the bye — ’
17960	17965	17957	17958	the Carrier	132	‘ That old gentleman — ’
17974	17981	17983	17984	the Carrier	132	‘ He ’s an odd fish , ’
17994	18013	17983	17984	the Carrier	132	‘ I ca n’t make him out . I do n’t believe there ’s any harm in him . ’
18014	18029	18035	18036	the Carrier	132	‘ None at all . I’m — I’m sure there ’s none at all . ’
18030	18033	18035	18036	the Carrier	132	‘ Yes , ’
18053	18103	18039	18039	his	132	‘ I am glad you feel so certain of it , because it ’s a confirmation to me . It ’s curious that he should have taken it into his head to ask leave to go on lodging with us ; an’t it ? Things come about so strangely . ’
18104	18109	18110	18110	she	338	‘ So very strangely , ’
18120	18132	18134	18134	John	17	‘ However , he ’s a good - natured old gentleman , ’
18136	18358	18134	18134	John	17	‘ and pays as a gentleman , and I think his word is to be relied upon , like a gentleman ’s . I had quite a long talk with him this morning : he can hear me better already , he says , as he gets more used to my voice . He told me a great deal about himself , and I told him a great deal about myself , and a rare lot of questions he asked me . I gave him information about my having two beats , you know , in my business ; one day to the right from our house and back again ; another day to the left from our house and back again ( for he ’s a stranger and do n’t know the names of places about here ) ; and he seemed quite pleased . “ Why , then I shall be returning home to - night your way , ” he says , “ when I thought you ’d be coming in an exactly opposite direction . That ’s capital ! I may trouble you for another lift perhaps , but I ’ll engage not to fall so sound asleep again . ” He _ was _ sound asleep , sure - ly!—Dot ! what are you thinking of ? ’
18359	18373	18110	18110	she	338	‘ Thinking of , John ? I — I was listening to you . ’
18374	18382	18384	18386	the honest Carrier	21	‘ O ! That ’s all right ! ’
18388	18429	18384	18386	the honest Carrier	21	‘ I was afraid , from the look of your face , that I had gone rambling on so long , as to set you thinking about something else . I was very near it , I ’ll be bound . ’
18479	18484	18465	18468	everybody on the road	341	‘ How are you ! ’
18753	18760	18765	18765	somebody	101	‘ Halloa ! Here ’s Boxer ! ’
19476	19482	19470	19470	she	19	‘ getting up her nose , ’
19902	19910	19912	19912	Dot	19	‘ May ! My dear old friend ! ’
19920	19928	19912	19912	Dot	19	‘ What a happiness to see you . ’
20164	20167	20169	20170	Mrs. Peerybingle	12	‘ things , ’
20549	20554	20556	20556	Dot	19	‘ Ah , May ! ’
20558	20578	20556	20556	Dot	19	‘ Dear dear , what changes ! To talk of those merry school - days makes one young again . ’
20579	20594	20596	20596	Tackleton	27	‘ Why , you an’t particularly old , at any time ; are you ? ’
20598	20607	20596	20596	Tackleton	27	‘ Look at my sober plodding husband there , ’
20611	20628	20596	20596	Tackleton	27	‘ He adds twenty years to my age at least . Do n’t you , John ? ’
20629	20632	20633	20633	John	17	‘ Forty , ’
20636	20654	20656	20656	Dot	19	‘ How many _ you_’ll add to May ’s , I am sure I do n’t know , ’
20660	20679	20656	20656	Dot	19	‘ But she ca n’t be much less than a hundred years of age on her next birthday . ’
20680	20684	20686	20686	Tackleton	27	‘ Ha ha ! ’
20712	20716	20718	20718	Dot	19	‘ Dear dear ! ’
20720	20790	20718	20718	Dot	19	‘ Only to remember how we used to talk , at school , about the husbands we would choose . I do n’t know how young , and how handsome , and how gay , and how lively , mine was not to be ! And as to May’s!—Ah dear ! I do n’t know whether to laugh or cry , when I think what silly girls we were . ’
20814	20831	20833	20833	Dot	19	‘ Even the very persons themselves — real live young men — were fixed on sometimes , ’
20835	20851	20833	20833	Dot	19	‘ We little thought how things would come about . I never fixed on John I ’m
20893	20956	20957	20957	You	56	’ Though May did n’t say yes , she certainly did n’t say no , or express no , by any means . Tackleton laughed — quite shouted , he laughed so loud . John Peerybingle laughed too , in his ordinary good - natured and contented manner ; but his was a mere whisper of a laugh , to Tackleton ’s . ‘
20976	20980	20967	20967	You	56	’ said Tackleton . ‘
20989	20990	20986	20986	we	424	’ ‘
20999	21000	21001	21003	Some of them	426	’ ‘
21007	21011	21001	21003	Some of them	426	’ said Dot ; ‘
21073	21074	21077	21077	Dot	19	’ ‘
21079	21084	21085	21086	Little woman	1078	’ exclaimed the Carrier . ‘
21088	21873	21085	21086	Little woman	1078	’ She had spoken with such earnestness and fire , that she stood in need of some recalling to herself , without doubt . Her husband ’s check was very gentle , for he merely interfered , as he supposed , to shield old Tackleton ; but it proved effectual , for she stopped , and said no more . There was an uncommon agitation , even in her silence , which the wary Tackleton , who had brought his half - shut eye to bear upon her , noted closely , and remembered to some purpose too . May uttered no word , good or bad , but sat quite still , with her eyes cast down , and made no sign of interest in what had passed . The good lady her mother now interposed , observing , in the first instance , that girls were girls , and byegones byegones , and that so long as young people were young and thoughtless , they would probably conduct themselves like young and thoughtless persons : with two or three other positions of a no less sound and incontrovertible character . She then remarked , in a devout spirit , that she thanked Heaven she had always found in her daughter May , a dutiful and obedient child ; for which she took no credit to herself , though she had every reason to believe it was entirely owing to herself . With regard to Mr. Tackleton she said , That he was in a moral point of view an undeniable individual , and That he was in an eligible point of view a son - in - law to be desired , no one in their senses could doubt . ( She was very emphatic here . ) With regard to the family into which he was so soon about , after some solicitation , to be admitted , she believed Mr. Tackleton knew that , although reduced in purse , it had some pretensions to gentility ; and if certain circumstances , not wholly unconnected , she would go so far as to say , with the Indigo Trade , but to which she would not more particularly refer , had happened differently , it might perhaps have been in possession of wealth . She then remarked that she would not allude to the past , and would not mention that her daughter had for some time rejected the suit of Mr. Tackleton ; and that she would not say a great many other things which she did say , at great length . Finally , she delivered it as the general result of her observation and experience , that those marriages in which there was least of what was romantically and sillily called love , were always the happiest ; and that she anticipated the greatest possible amount of bliss — not rapturous bliss ; but the solid , steady - going article — from the approaching nuptials . She concluded by informing the company that to - morrow was the day she had lived for , expressly ; and that when it was over , she would desire nothing better than to be packed up and disposed of , in any genteel place of burial . As these remarks were quite unanswerable — which is the happy property of all remarks that are sufficiently wide of the purpose — they changed the current of the conversation , and diverted the general attention to the Veal and Ham - Pie , the cold mutton , the potatoes , and the tart . In order that the bottled beer might not be slighted , John Peerybingle proposed To - morrow : the Wedding - Day ; and called upon them to drink a bumper to it , before he proceeded on his journey . For you ought to know that he only rested there , and gave the old horse a bait . He had to go some four or five miles farther on ; and when he returned in the evening , he called for Dot , and took another rest on his way home . This was the order of the day on all the Pic - Nic occasions , had been , ever since their institution . There were two persons present , besides the bride and bridegroom elect , who did but indifferent honour to the toast . One of these was Dot , too flushed and discomposed to adapt herself to any small occurrence of the moment ; the other , Bertha , who rose up hurriedly , before the rest , and left the table . ‘
21877	21889	21085	21086	Little woman	1078	’ said stout John Peerybingle , pulling on his dreadnought coat . ‘

21910	21950	21908	21908	John	17	’ returned Caleb . He seemed to say it by rote , and to wave his hand in the same unconscious manner ; for he stood observing Bertha with an anxious wondering face , that never altered its expression . ‘
21957	22003	21954	21955	young shaver	430	’ said the jolly Carrier , bending down to kiss the child ; which Tilly Slowboy , now intent upon her knife and fork , had deposited asleep ( and strange to say , without damage ) in a little cot of Bertha ’s furnishing ; ‘

22082	22088	22074	22075	the Carrier	132	‘ Where ’s the pipe ? ’
22089	22098	22074	22075	the Carrier	132	‘ I quite forgot the pipe , John . ’
22117	22130	22111	22111	She	0	‘ I’ll — I’ll fill it directly . It ’s soon done . ’
22295	22308	22310	22310	John	17	‘ Why , what a clumsy Dot you are , this afternoon ! ’
22312	22325	22310	22310	John	17	‘ I could have done it better myself , I verily believe ! ’
22384	22387	22389	22389	Caleb	34	‘ Bertha ! ’
22393	22431	22389	22389	Caleb	34	‘ What has happened ? How changed you are , my darling , in a few hours — since this morning . _ You _ silent and dull all day ! What is it ? Tell me ! ’
22432	22438	22440	22442	the Blind Girl	936	‘ Oh father , father ! ’
22448	22456	22457	22457	Caleb	34	‘ Oh my hard , hard fate ! ’
22469	22495	22457	22457	Caleb	34	‘ But think how cheerful and how happy you have been , Bertha ! How good , and how much loved , by many people . ’
22496	22519	22520	22520	Caleb	34	‘ That strikes me to the heart , dear father ! Always so mindful of me ! Always so kind to me ! ’
22529	22543	22544	22544	he	34	‘ To be — to be blind , Bertha , my poor dear , ’
22547	22555	22544	22544	he	34	‘ is a great affliction ; but — ’
22556	22563	22565	22567	the Blind Girl	936	‘ I have never felt it ! ’
22569	22620	22621	22621	she	914	‘ I have never felt it , in its fulness . Never ! I have sometimes wished that I could see you , or could see him — only once , dear father , only for one little minute — that I might know what it is I treasure up , ’
22629	22706	22621	22621	she	914	‘ and hold here ! That I might be sure and have it right ! And sometimes ( but then I was a child ) I have wept in my prayers at night , to think that when your images ascended from my heart to Heaven , they might not be the true resemblance of yourselves . But I have never had these feelings long . They have passed away and left me tranquil and contented . ’
22707	22713	22715	22715	Caleb	34	‘ And they will again , ’
22717	22738	22740	22742	the Blind Girl	936	‘ But , father ! Oh my good , gentle father , bear with me , if I am wicked ! ’
22744	22756	22740	22742	the Blind Girl	936	‘ This is not the sorrow that so weighs me down ! ’
22785	22791	22793	22793	Bertha	62	‘ Bring her to me , ’
22795	22814	22793	22793	Bertha	62	‘ I can not hold it closed and shut within myself . Bring her to me , father ! ’
22823	22829	22817	22817	he	443	‘ May . Bring May ! ’
22863	22875	22877	22877	Bertha	62	‘ Look into my face , Dear heart , Sweet heart ! ’
22879	22898	22877	22877	Bertha	62	‘ Read it with your beautiful eyes , and tell me if the truth is written on it . ’
22899	22905	22906	22908	The Blind Girl	53	‘ Dear Bertha , Yes ! ’
22931	23040	23042	23042	she	53	‘ There is not , in my soul , a wish or thought that is not for your good , bright May ! There is not , in my soul , a grateful recollection stronger than the deep remembrance which is stored there , of the many many times when , in the full pride of sight and beauty , you have had consideration for Blind Bertha , even when we two were children , or when Bertha was as much a child as ever blindness can be ! Every blessing on your head ! Light upon your happy course ! Not the less , my dear May ; ’
23052	23148	23042	23042	she	53	‘ not the less , my bird , because , to - day , the knowledge that you are to be His wife has wrung my heart almost to breaking ! Father , May , Mary ! oh forgive me that it is so , for the sake of all he has done to relieve the weariness of my dark life : and for the sake of the belief you have in me , when I call Heaven to witness that I could not wish him married to a wife more worthy of his goodness ! ’
23210	23214	23216	23217	her father	443	‘ Great Power ! ’
23227	23244	23216	23217	her father	443	‘ have I deceived her from her cradle , but to break her heart at last ! ’
23338	23381	23383	23386	the cheery little woman	451	‘ Come , come , dear Bertha ! come away with me ! Give her your arm , May . So ! How composed she is , you see , already ; and how good it is of her to mind us , ’
23394	23426	23383	23386	the cheery little woman	451	‘ Come away , dear Bertha . Come ! and here ’s her good father will come with her ; wo n’t you , Caleb ? To — be — sure ! ’
23527	23537	23539	23539	she	451	‘ So bring me the precious Baby , Tilly , ’
23548	23584	23539	23539	she	451	‘ and while I have it in my lap , here ’s Mrs. Fielding , Tilly , will tell me all about the management of Babies , and put me right in twenty points where I ’m
23598	23615	23595	23596	Mrs. Fielding	63	’ Not even the Welsh Giant , who , according to the popular expression , was so ‘
23617	24119	24121	24121	I	0	’ as to perform a fatal surgical operation upon himself , in emulation of a juggling - trick achieved by his arch - enemy at breakfast - time ; not even he fell half so readily into the snare prepared for him , as the old lady did into this artful pitfall . The fact of Tackleton having walked out ; and furthermore , of two or three people having been talking together at a distance , for two minutes , leaving her to her own resources ; was quite enough to have put her on her dignity , and the bewailment of that mysterious convulsion in the Indigo trade , for four - and - twenty hours . But this becoming deference to her experience , on the part of the young mother , was so irresistible , that after a short affectation of humility , she began to enlighten her with the best grace in the world ; and sitting bolt upright before the wicked Dot , she did , in half an hour , deliver more infallible domestic recipes and precepts , than would ( if acted on ) have utterly destroyed and done up that Young Peerybingle , though he had been an Infant Samson . To change the theme , Dot did a little needlework — she carried the contents of a whole workbox in her pocket ; however she contrived it , I do n’t know — then did a little nursing ; then a little more needlework ; then had a little whispering chat with May , while the old lady dozed ; and so in little bits of bustle , which was quite her manner always , found it a very short afternoon . Then , as it grew dark , and as it was a solemn part of this Institution of the Pic - Nic that she should perform all Bertha ’s household tasks , she trimmed the fire , and swept the hearth , and set the tea - board out , and drew the curtain , and lighted a candle . Then she played an air or two on a rude kind of harp , which Caleb had contrived for Bertha , and played them very well ; for Nature had made her delicate little ear as choice a one for music as it would have been for jewels , if she had had any to wear . By this time it was the established hour for having tea ; and Tackleton came back again , to share the meal , and spend the evening . Caleb and Bertha had returned some time before , and Caleb had sat down to his afternoon ’s work . But he could n’t settle to it , poor fellow , being anxious and remorseful for his daughter . It was touching to see him sitting idle on his working - stool , regarding her so wistfully , and always saying in his face , ‘
24134	24274	24121	24121	I	0	’ When it was night , and tea was done , and Dot had nothing more to do in washing up the cups and saucers ; in a word — for I must come to it , and there is no use in putting it off — when the time drew nigh for expecting the Carrier ’s return in every sound of distant wheels , her manner changed again , her colour came and went , and she was very restless . Not as good wives are , when listening for their husbands . No , no , no . It was another sort of restlessness from that . Wheels heard . A horse ’s feet . The barking of a dog . The gradual approach of all the sounds . The scratching paw of Boxer at the door ! ‘
24280	24287	24121	24121	I	0	’ cried Bertha , starting up . ‘
24291	24316	24319	24319	mine	0	’ returned the Carrier , standing in the portal , with his brown face ruddy as a winter berry from the keen night air . ‘
24321	24322	24319	24319	mine	0	’ ‘
24327	24331	24319	24319	mine	0	’ said Bertha . ‘

24348	24355	24341	24341	She	458	’ observed the Carrier , laughing . ‘
24369	24388	24389	24389	He	240	’ He spoke in a loud tone ; and as he spoke , the deaf old gentleman entered . ‘
24407	24412	24405	24405	Caleb	34	’ said the Carrier . ‘
24424	24425	24413	24413	You	182	’ ‘
24438	24439	24413	24413	You	182	’ ‘
24453	24457	24440	24440	He	240	’ said John . ‘
24467	24489	24465	24465	he	240	’em , I can tell you . Sit down , sir . All friends here , and glad to see you ! ’
24518	24550	24511	24511	he	21	‘ A chair in the chimney - corner , and leave to sit quite silent and look pleasantly about him , is all he cares for . He ’s easily pleased . ’
24647	24657	24658	24658	he	21	‘ A clumsy Dot she was , this afternoon ! ’
24677	24690	24691	24691	He	21	‘ and yet I like her somehow . See yonder , Dot ! ’
24707	24720	24722	24723	the Carrier	132	‘ He’s — ha ha ha!—he ’s full of admiration for you ! ’
24725	24751	24722	24723	the Carrier	132	‘ Talked of nothing else , the whole way here . Why , he ’s a brave old boy . I like him for it ! ’
24752	24764	24765	24765	she	62	‘ I wish he had had a better subject , John , ’
24780	24785	24787	24789	the jovial John	21	‘ A better subject ! ’
24791	24871	24787	24789	the jovial John	21	‘ There ’s no such thing . Come , off with the great - coat , off with the thick shawl , off with the heavy wrappers ! and a cosy half - hour by the fire ! My humble service , Mistress . A game at cribbage , you and I ? That ’s hearty . The cards and board , Dot . And a glass of beer here , if there ’s any left , small wife ! ’
25008	25022	25006	25006	Tackleton	41	‘ I am sorry to disturb you — but a word , directly . ’
25023	25025	25087	25088	John Peerybingle	17	‘ I ’m
25030	25035	25006	25006	Tackleton	41	’ returned the Carrier . ‘
25041	25042	25006	25006	Tackleton	41	’ ‘
25046	25050	25006	25006	Tackleton	41	’ said Tackleton . ‘
25056	25084	25054	25054	man	477	’ There was that in his pale face which made the other rise immediately , and ask him , in a hurry , what the matter was . ‘
25090	25094	25087	25088	John Peerybingle	17	’ said Tackleton . ‘
25120	25121	25112	25112	I	0	’ ‘
25126	25136	25112	25112	I	0	’ asked the Carrier , with a frightened aspect . ‘
25151	25239	25139	25139	I	0	’ The Carrier accompanied him , without another word . They went across a yard , where the stars were shining , and by a little side - door , into Tackleton ’s own counting - house , where there was a glass window , commanding the ware - room , which was closed for the night . There was no light in the counting - house itself , but there were lamps in the long narrow ware - room ; and consequently the window was bright . ‘
25243	25247	25139	25139	I	0	’ said Tackleton . ‘
25261	25262	25258	25258	you	477	’ ‘
25266	25271	25317	25318	The Carrier	132	’ returned the Carrier . ‘
25276	25280	25317	25318	The Carrier	132	’ said Tackleton . ‘
25299	25316	25317	25318	The Carrier	132	’re a strong - made man ; and you might do murder before you know it . ’
25597	25614	25616	25616	she	483	‘ Now , John , dear ! Good night , May ! Good night , Bertha ! ’
25678	25716	25663	25663	she	20	‘ Did the knowledge that it was to be its wifes , then , wring its hearts almost to breaking ; and did its fathers deceive it from its cradles but to break its hearts at last ! ’
25717	25739	25663	25663	she	20	‘ Now , Tilly , give me the Baby ! Good night , Mr. Tackleton . Where ’s John , for goodness ’
25742	25743	25663	25663	she	20	’ ‘
25755	25766	25769	25769	John	17	’ said Tackleton ; who helped her to her seat . ‘
25777	25882	25663	25663	she	20	’ The muffled figure of her husband made a hasty sign in the affirmative ; and the false stranger and the little nurse being in their places , the old horse moved off . Boxer , the unconscious Boxer , running on before , running back , running round and round the cart , and barking as triumphantly and merrily as ever . When Tackleton had gone off likewise , escorting May and her mother home , poor Caleb sat down by the fire beside his daughter ; anxious and remorseful at the core ; and still saying in his wistful contemplation of her , ‘
25899	26303	25663	25663	she	20	’ The toys that had been set in motion for the Baby , had all stopped , and run down , long ago . In the faint light and silence , the imperturbably calm dolls , the agitated rocking - horses with distended eyes and nostrils , the old gentlemen at the street - doors , standing half doubled up upon their failing knees and ankles , the wry - faced nut - crackers , the very Beasts upon their way into the Ark , in twos , like a Boarding School out walking , might have been imagined to be stricken motionless with fantastic wonder , at Dot being false , or Tackleton beloved , under any combination of circumstances . CHAPTER III — Chirp the Third The Dutch clock in the corner struck Ten , when the Carrier sat down by his fireside . So troubled and grief - worn , that he seemed to scare the Cuckoo , who , having cut his ten melodious announcements as short as possible , plunged back into the Moorish Palace again , and clapped his little door behind him , as if the unwonted spectacle were too much for his feelings . If the little Haymaker had been armed with the sharpest of scythes , and had cut at every stroke into the Carrier ’s heart , he never could have gashed and wounded it , as Dot had done . It was a heart so full of love for her ; so bound up and held together by innumerable threads of winning remembrance , spun from the daily working of her many qualities of endearment ; it was a heart in which she had enshrined herself so gently and so closely ; a heart so single and so earnest in its Truth , so strong in right , so weak in wrong ; that it could cherish neither passion nor revenge at first , and had only room to hold the broken image of its Idol . But , slowly , slowly , as the Carrier sat brooding on his hearth , now cold and dark , other and fiercer thoughts began to rise within him , as an angry wind comes rising in the night . The Stranger was beneath his outraged roof . Three steps would take him to his chamber - door . One blow would beat it in . ‘
26313	27030	26304	26304	You	495	’ Tackleton had said . How could it be murder , if he gave the villain time to grapple with him hand to hand ! He was the younger man . It was an ill - timed thought , bad for the dark mood of his mind . It was an angry thought , goading him to some avenging act , that should change the cheerful house into a haunted place which lonely travellers would dread to pass by night ; and where the timid would see shadows struggling in the ruined windows when the moon was dim , and hear wild noises in the stormy weather . He was the younger man ! Yes , yes ; some lover who had won the heart that _ he _ had never touched . Some lover of her early choice , of whom she had thought and dreamed , for whom she had pined and pined , when he had fancied her so happy by his side . O agony to think of it ! She had been above - stairs with the Baby , getting it to bed . As he sat brooding on the hearth , she came close beside him , without his knowledge — in the turning of the rack of his great misery , he lost all other sounds — and put her little stool at his feet . He only knew it , when he felt her hand upon his own , and saw her looking up into his face . With wonder ? No . It was his first impression , and he was fain to look at her again , to set it right . No , not with wonder . With an eager and inquiring look ; but not with wonder . At first it was alarmed and serious ; then , it changed into a strange , wild , dreadful smile of recognition of his thoughts ; then , there was nothing but her clasped hands on her brow , and her bent head , and falling hair . Though the power of Omnipotence had been his to wield at that moment , he had too much of its diviner property of Mercy in his breast , to have turned one feather ’s weight of it against her . But he could not bear to see her crouching down upon the little seat where he had often looked on her , with love and pride , so innocent and gay ; and , when she rose and left him , sobbing as she went , he felt it a relief to have the vacant place beside him rather than her so long - cherished presence . This in itself was anguish keener than all , reminding him how desolate he was become , and how the great bond of his life was rent asunder . The more he felt this , and the more he knew he could have better borne to see her lying prematurely dead before him with their little child upon her breast , the higher and the stronger rose his wrath against his enemy . He looked about him for a weapon . There was a gun , hanging on the wall . He took it down , and moved a pace or two towards the door of the perfidious Stranger ’s room . He knew the gun was loaded . Some shadowy idea that it was just to shoot this man like a wild beast , seized him , and dilated in his mind until it grew into a monstrous demon in complete possession of him , casting out all milder thoughts and setting up its undivided empire . That phrase is wrong . Not casting out his milder thoughts , but artfully transforming them . Changing them into scourges to drive him on . Turning water into blood , love into hate , gentleness into blind ferocity . Her image , sorrowing , humbled , but still pleading to his tenderness and mercy with resistless power , never left his mind ; but , staying there , it urged him to the door ; raised the weapon to his shoulder ; fitted and nerved his finger to the trigger ; and cried ‘
27038	27275	27346	27347	the Cricket	13	’ He reversed the gun to beat the stock upon the door ; he already held it lifted in the air ; some indistinct design was in his thoughts of calling out to him to fly , for God ’s sake , by the window — When , suddenly , the struggling fire illumined the whole chimney with a glow of light ; and the Cricket on the Hearth began to Chirp ! No sound he could have heard , no human voice , not even hers , could so have moved and softened him . The artless words in which she had told him of her love for this same Cricket , were once more freshly spoken ; her trembling , earnest manner at the moment , was again before him ; her pleasant voice — O what a voice it was , for making household music at the fireside of an honest man!—thrilled through and through his better nature , and awoke it into life and action . He recoiled from the door , like a man walking in his sleep , awakened from a frightful dream ; and put the gun aside . Clasping his hands before his face , he then sat down again beside the fire , and found relief in tears . The Cricket on the Hearth came out into the room , and stood in Fairy shape before him . ‘
27282	27294	27346	27347	the Cricket	13	’ said the Fairy Voice , repeating what he well remembered , ‘
27317	27318	27319	27319	She	497	’ ‘
27323	27328	27319	27319	She	497	’ cried the Carrier . ‘
27331	27332	27319	27319	She	497	’ ‘
27353	27354	27359	27359	Heaven	15	’ ‘
27362	27367	27359	27359	Heaven	15	’ returned the Carrier . ‘
27376	27377	27368	27368	She	497	’ ‘
27396	27401	27368	27368	She	497	’ said the Voice . ‘
27413	27425	27410	27410	I	0	’ returned the Carrier . The Voice , correcting him , said ‘
27428	27432	27434	27434	I	0	’ The Carrier repeated ‘
27437	27477	27434	27434	I	0	’ But not firmly . His faltering tongue resisted his control , and would speak in its own way , for itself and him . The Figure , in an attitude of invocation , raised its hand and said : ‘
27483	27484	27479	27479	your	0	’ ‘
27491	27496	27499	27499	she	497	’ interposed the Carrier . ‘
27507	27512	27479	27479	your	0	’ said the Cricket ; ‘
27649	27650	27632	27632	her	497	’ ‘
27656	27661	27632	27632	her	497	’ inquired the Carrier . ‘
27679	27684	27632	27632	her	497	’ returned the Cricket . ‘
27691	28004	27686	27686	they	506	’ And while the Carrier , with his head upon his hands , continued to sit meditating in his chair , the Presence stood beside him , suggesting his reflections by its power , and presenting them before him , as in a glass or picture . It was not a solitary Presence . From the hearthstone , from the chimney , from the clock , the pipe , the kettle , and the cradle ; from the floor , the walls , the ceiling , and the stairs ; from the cart without , and the cupboard within , and the household implements ; from every thing and every place with which she had ever been familiar , and with which she had ever entwined one recollection of herself in her unhappy husband ’s mind ; Fairies came trooping forth . Not to stand beside him as the Cricket did , but to busy and bestir themselves . To do all honour to her image . To pull him by the skirts , and point to it when it appeared . To cluster round it , and embrace it , and strew flowers for it to tread on . To try to crown its fair head with their tiny hands . To show that they were fond of it and loved it ; and that there was not one ugly , wicked or accusatory creature to claim knowledge of it — none but their playful and approving selves . His thoughts were constant to her image . It was always there . She sat plying her needle , before the fire , and singing to herself . Such a blithe , thriving , steady little Dot ! The fairy figures turned upon him all at once , by one consent , with one prodigious concentrated stare , and seemed to say , ‘
28015	28250	27686	27686	they	506	’ There were sounds of gaiety outside , musical instruments , and noisy tongues , and laughter . A crowd of young merry - makers came pouring in , among whom were May Fielding and a score of pretty girls . Dot was the fairest of them all ; as young as any of them too . They came to summon her to join their party . It was a dance . If ever little foot were made for dancing , hers was , surely . But she laughed , and shook her head , and pointed to her cookery on the fire , and her table ready spread : with an exulting defiance that rendered her more charming than she was before . And so she merrily dismissed them , nodding to her would - be partners , one by one , as they passed , but with a comical indifference , enough to make them go and drown themselves immediately if they were her admirers — and they must have been so , more or less ; they could n’t help it . And yet indifference was not her character . O no ! For presently , there came a certain Carrier to the door ; and bless her what a welcome she bestowed upon him ! Again the staring figures turned upon him all at once , and seemed to say , ‘
28260	28935	27686	27686	they	506	’ A shadow fell upon the mirror or the picture : call it what you will . A great shadow of the Stranger , as he first stood underneath their roof ; covering its surface , and blotting out all other objects . But the nimble Fairies worked like bees to clear it off again . And Dot again was there . Still bright and beautiful . Rocking her little Baby in its cradle , singing to it softly , and resting her head upon a shoulder which had its counterpart in the musing figure by which the Fairy Cricket stood . The night — I mean the real night : not going by Fairy clocks — was wearing now ; and in this stage of the Carrier ’s thoughts , the moon burst out , and shone brightly in the sky . Perhaps some calm and quiet light had risen also , in his mind ; and he could think more soberly of what had happened . Although the shadow of the Stranger fell at intervals upon the glass — always distinct , and big , and thoroughly defined — it never fell so darkly as at first . Whenever it appeared , the Fairies uttered a general cry of consternation , and plied their little arms and legs , with inconceivable activity , to rub it out . And whenever they got at Dot again , and showed her to him once more , bright and beautiful , they cheered in the most inspiring manner . They never showed her , otherwise than beautiful and bright , for they were Household Spirits to whom falsehood is annihilation ; and being so , what Dot was there for them , but the one active , beaming , pleasant little creature who had been the light and sun of the Carrier ’s Home ! The Fairies were prodigiously excited when they showed her , with the Baby , gossiping among a knot of sage old matrons , and affecting to be wondrous old and matronly herself , and leaning in a staid , demure old way upon her husband ’s arm , attempting — she ! such a bud of a little woman — to convey the idea of having abjured the vanities of the world in general , and of being the sort of person to whom it was no novelty at all to be a mother ; yet in the same breath , they showed her , laughing at the Carrier for being awkward , and pulling up his shirt - collar to make him smart , and mincing merrily about that very room to teach him how to dance ! They turned , and stared immensely at him when they showed her with the Blind Girl ; for , though she carried cheerfulness and animation with her wheresoever she went , she bore those influences into Caleb Plummer ’s home , heaped up and running over . The Blind Girl ’s love for her , and trust in her , and gratitude to her ; her own good busy way of setting Bertha ’s thanks aside ; her dexterous little arts for filling up each moment of the visit in doing something useful to the house , and really working hard while feigning to make holiday ; her bountiful provision of those standing delicacies , the Veal and Ham - Pie and the bottles of Beer ; her radiant little face arriving at the door , and taking leave ; the wonderful expression in her whole self , from her neat foot to the crown of her head , of being a part of the establishment — a something necessary to it , which it could n’t be without ; all this the Fairies revelled in , and loved her for . And once again they looked upon him all at once , appealingly , and seemed to say , while some among them nestled in her dress and fondled her , ‘
28946	29369	29370	29371	John Peerybingle	17	’ More than once , or twice , or thrice , in the long thoughtful night , they showed her to him sitting on her favourite seat , with her bent head , her hands clasped on her brow , her falling hair . As he had seen her last . And when they found her thus , they neither turned nor looked upon him , but gathered close round her , and comforted and kissed her , and pressed on one another to show sympathy and kindness to her , and forgot him altogether . Thus the night passed . The moon went down ; the stars grew pale ; the cold day broke ; the sun rose . The Carrier still sat , musing , in the chimney corner . He had sat there , with his head upon his hands , all night . All night the faithful Cricket had been Chirp , Chirp , Chirping on the Hearth . All night he had listened to its voice . All night the household Fairies had been busy with him . All night she had been amiable and blameless in the glass , except when that one shadow fell upon it . He rose up when it was broad day , and washed and dressed himself . He could n’t go about his customary cheerful avocations — he wanted spirit for them — but it mattered the less , that it was Tackleton ’s wedding - day , and he had arranged to make his rounds by proxy . He thought to have gone merrily to church with Dot . But such plans were at an end . It was their own wedding - day too . Ah ! how little he had looked for such a close to such a year ! The Carrier had expected that Tackleton would pay him an early visit ; and he was right . He had not walked to and fro before his own door , many minutes , when he saw the Toy - merchant coming in his chaise along the road . As the chaise drew nearer , he perceived that Tackleton was dressed out sprucely for his marriage , and that he had decorated his horse ’s head with flowers and favours . The horse looked much more like a bridegroom than Tackleton , whose half - closed eye was more disagreeably expressive than ever . But the Carrier took little heed of this . His thoughts had other occupation . ‘
29373	29383	29370	29371	John Peerybingle	17	’ said Tackleton , with an air of condolence . ‘
29396	29397	29390	29390	you	513	’ ‘
29409	29418	29398	29398	I	0	’ returned the Carrier , shaking his head : ‘
29452	29453	29438	29438	you	513	’ ‘
29459	29465	29454	29454	I	0	’ returned Tackleton , alighting . ‘
29494	29516	29485	29485	you	513	’ The Carrier having brought it from his stable , and set it before him , they turned into the house . ‘
29524	29528	29529	29529	I	0	’ he said , ‘
29532	29533	29529	29529	I	0	’ ‘
29536	29540	29529	29529	I	0	’ answered Tackleton . ‘
29549	29614	29616	29616	you	513	’ When they entered the kitchen , Tilly Slowboy was rapping at the Stranger ’s door ; which was only removed from it by a few steps . One of her very red eyes ( for Tilly had been crying all night long , because her mistress cried ) was at the keyhole ; and she was knocking very loud ; and seemed frightened . ‘
29625	29632	29618	29618	I	0	’ said Tilly , looking round . ‘
29646	29671	29643	29643	you	513	’ This philanthropic wish , Miss Slowboy emphasised with various new raps and kicks at the door ; which led to no result whatever . ‘
29676	29680	29643	29643	you	513	’ said Tackleton . ‘
29685	29767	29643	29643	you	513	’ The Carrier , who had turned his face from the door , signed to him to go if he would . So Tackleton went to Tilly Slowboy ’s relief ; and he too kicked and knocked ; and he too failed to get the least reply . But he thought of trying the handle of the door ; and as it opened easily , he peeped in , looked in , went in , and soon came running out again . ‘
29771	29779	29768	29769	John Peerybingle	17	’ said Tackleton , in his ear . ‘
29793	29801	29780	29780	I	0	’ The Carrier turned upon him quickly . ‘
29807	29811	29780	29780	I	0	’ said Tackleton ; ‘
29853	29901	29903	29903	yourself	517	’ He nearly shut up the expressive eye altogether ; he looked at him so hard . And he gave his eye , and his face , and his whole person , a sharp twist . As if he would have screwed the truth out of him . ‘
29906	29911	29903	29903	yourself	517	’ said the Carrier . ‘
29994	29995	29988	29988	I	0	’ ‘
30007	30044	30000	30000	he	17	’ said Tackleton , taking a chair . The sneer was lost upon the Carrier , who sat down too , and shaded his face with his hand , for some little time , before proceeding . ‘
30051	30057	30045	30045	You	0	’ he said at length , ‘
30069	30070	30045	30045	You	0	’ ‘
30074	30078	30045	30045	You	0	’ insinuated Tackleton . ‘
30130	30131	30132	30132	I	0	’ ‘
30141	30145	30132	30132	I	0	’ said Tackleton . ‘
30157	30158	30154	30154	I	0	’ ‘
30167	30176	30161	30161	you	0	’ pursued the Carrier , not minding him ; ‘
30259	30268	30343	30347	a plain , rough man	531	’ said the Carrier , regarding him attentively . ‘
30276	30340	30341	30341	I	0	’ Tackleton muttered a few general words of assent , about its being necessary to vindicate something or other ; but he was overawed by the manner of his companion . Plain and unpolished as it was , it had a something dignified and noble in it , which nothing but the soul of generous honour dwelling in the man could have imparted . ‘
30349	30354	30343	30347	a plain , rough man	531	’ pursued the Carrier , ‘
30450	30469	30447	30447	I	0	’ He paused , and softly beat the ground a short time with his foot , before resuming . ‘
30537	30538	30566	30566	I	0	’ ‘
30541	30553	30566	30566	I	0	’ said Tackleton , with a significant shake of the head . ‘
30581	30586	30577	30577	I	0	’ pursued the Carrier . ‘
30601	30602	30599	30599	her	534	’ ‘
30607	30611	30599	30599	her	534	’ said Tackleton . ‘
30633	30634	30635	30635	You	543	’ ‘
30642	30651	30635	30635	You	543	’ said the Carrier , with some sternness , ‘
30659	30707	30658	30658	you	543	’re wide of doing so . If , yesterday , I ’d have struck that man down at a blow , who dared to breathe a word against her , to - day I ’d set my foot upon his face , if he was my brother ! ’
30726	30731	30733	30734	the Carrier	132	‘ Did I consider , ’
30736	30891	30733	30734	the Carrier	132	‘ that I took her — at her age , and with her beauty — from her young companions , and the many scenes of which she was the ornament ; in which she was the brightest little star that ever shone , to shut her up from day to day in my dull house , and keep my tedious company ? Did I consider how little suited I was to her sprightly humour , and how wearisome a plodding man like me must be , to one of her quick spirit ? Did I consider that it was no merit in me , or claim in me , that I loved her , when everybody must , who knew her ? Never . I took advantage of her hopeful nature and her cheerful disposition ; and I married her . I wish I never had ! For her sake ; not for mine ! ’
30913	30918	30920	30921	the Carrier	132	‘ Heaven bless her ! ’
30923	31042	30920	30921	the Carrier	132	‘ for the cheerful constancy with which she tried to keep the knowledge of this from me ! And Heaven help me , that , in my slow mind , I have not found it out before ! Poor child ! Poor Dot ! _ I _ not to find it out , who have seen her eyes fill with tears , when such a marriage as our own was spoken of ! I , who have seen the secret trembling on her lips a hundred times , and never suspected it till last night ! Poor girl ! That I could ever hope she would be fond of me ! That I could ever believe she was ! ’
31043	31051	31053	31053	Tackleton	41	‘ She made a show of it , ’
31055	31078	31053	31053	Tackleton	41	‘ She made such a show of it , that to tell you the truth it was the origin of my misgivings . ’
31104	31109	31111	31113	the poor Carrier	21	‘ She has tried , ’
31124	31194	31111	31113	the poor Carrier	21	‘ I only now begin to know how hard she has tried , to be my dutiful and zealous wife . How good she has been ; how much she has done ; how brave and strong a heart she has ; let the happiness I have known under this roof bear witness ! It will be some help and comfort to me , when I am here alone . ’
31195	31199	31201	31201	Tackleton	41	‘ Here alone ? ’
31203	31217	31201	31201	Tackleton	41	‘ Oh ! Then you do mean to take some notice of this ? ’
31218	31222	31224	31225	the Carrier	132	‘ I mean , ’
31227	31277	31224	31225	the Carrier	132	‘ to do her the greatest kindness , and make her the best reparation , in my power . I can release her from the daily pain of an unequal marriage , and the struggle to conceal it . She shall be as free as I can render her . ’
31278	31285	31287	31287	Tackleton	41	‘ Make _ her _ reparation ! ’
31299	31316	31287	31287	Tackleton	41	‘ There must be something wrong here . You did n’t say that , of course . ’
31338	31343	31344	31344	he	21	‘ Listen to me ! ’
31347	31366	31344	31344	he	21	‘ And take care that you hear me right . Listen to me . Do I speak plainly ? ’
31367	31372	31374	31374	Tackleton	41	‘ Very plainly indeed , ’
31376	31383	31374	31374	Tackleton	41	‘ As if I meant it ? ’
31384	31393	31344	31344	he	21	‘ Very much as if you meant it . ’
31394	31407	31409	31410	the Carrier	132	‘ I sat upon that hearth , last night , all night , ’
31412	31478	31409	31410	the Carrier	132	‘ On the spot where she has often sat beside me , with her sweet face looking into mine . I called up her whole life , day by day . I had her dear self , in its every passage , in review before me . And upon my soul she is innocent , if there is One to judge the innocent and guilty ! ’
31489	31497	31499	31500	the Carrier	132	‘ Passion and distrust have left me ! ’
31502	31603	31499	31500	the Carrier	132	‘ and nothing but my grief remains . In an unhappy moment some old lover , better suited to her tastes and years than I ; forsaken , perhaps , for me , against her will ; returned . In an unhappy moment , taken by surprise , and wanting time to think of what she did , she made herself a party to his treachery , by concealing it . Last night she saw him , in the interview we witnessed . It was wrong . But otherwise than this she is innocent if there is truth on earth ! ’
31604	31612	31628	31628	my	0	‘ If that is your opinion’—Tackleton began . ‘
31619	31624	31628	31628	my	0	’ pursued the Carrier . ‘
31681	31847	31671	31671	She	554	’m not a drag upon her , and she wears the chain I have riveted , more lightly . This is the day on which I took her , with so little thought for her enjoyment , from her home . To - day she shall return to it , and I will trouble her no more . Her father and mother will be here to - day — we had made a little plan for keeping it together — and they shall take her home . I can trust her , there , or anywhere . She leaves me without blame , and she will live so I am sure . If I should die — I may perhaps while she is still young ; I have lost some courage in a few hours — she’ll find that I remembered her , and loved her to the last ! This is the end of what you showed me . Now , it ’s over ! ’
31848	31903	31671	31671	She	554	‘ O no , John , not over . Do not say it ’s over yet ! Not quite yet . I have heard your noble words . I could not steal away , pretending to be ignorant of what has affected me with such deep gratitude . Do not say it ’s over , ‘
31911	31982	31671	31671	She	554	’ She had entered shortly after Tackleton , and had remained there . She never looked at Tackleton , but fixed her eyes upon her husband . But she kept away from him , setting as wide a space as possible between them ; and though she spoke with most impassioned earnestness , she went no nearer to him even then . How different in this from her old self ! ‘
32001	32011	31671	31671	She	554	’ replied the Carrier , with a faint smile . ‘
32052	32053	32039	32039	I	0	’ ‘
32056	32060	32039	32039	I	0	’ muttered Tackleton . ‘
32094	32118	32093	32093	I	0	’m sorry to be deprived of the pleasure of your company . Sorry for the loss , and the occasion of it too ! ’
32119	32125	32127	32128	the Carrier	132	‘ I have spoken plainly ? ’
32136	32140	32127	32128	the Carrier	132	‘ Oh quite ! ’
32141	32151	32093	32093	I	0	‘ And you ’ll remember what I have said ? ’
32152	32164	32166	32166	Tackleton	41	‘ Why , if you compel me to make the observation , ’
32178	32191	32166	32166	Tackleton	41	‘ I must say that it was so very unexpected , that I ’m

32298	32418	32296	32296	yourself	17	’ The Carrier stood looking after him until he was smaller in the distance than his horse ’s flowers and favours near at hand ; and then , with a deep sigh , went strolling like a restless , broken man , among some neighbouring elms ; unwilling to return until the clock was on the eve of striking . His little wife , being left alone , sobbed piteously ; but often dried her eyes and checked herself , to say how good he was , how excellent he was ! and once or twice she laughed ; so heartily , triumphantly , and incoherently ( still crying all the time ) , that Tilly was quite horrified . ‘
32426	32430	32421	32421	you	17	’ said Tilly . ‘

32497	32522	32474	32474	I	0	’ cried Tilly , throwing back her head , and bursting out into a howl — she looked at the moment uncommonly like Boxer . ‘
32557	32693	32694	32694	Mary	46	’ The soft - hearted Slowboy trailed off at this juncture , into such a deplorable howl , the more tremendous from its long suppression , that she must infallibly have awakened the Baby , and frightened him into something serious ( probably convulsions ) , if her eyes had not encountered Caleb Plummer , leading in his daughter . This spectacle restoring her to a sense of the proprieties , she stood for some few moments silent , with her mouth wide open ; and then , posting off to the bed on which the Baby lay asleep , danced in a weird , Saint Vitus manner on the floor , and at the same time rummaged with her face and head among the bedclothes , apparently deriving much relief from those extraordinary operations . ‘
32696	32700	32694	32694	Mary	46	’ said Bertha . ‘

33409	33410	33411	33411	He	584	’ ‘
33416	33426	33411	33411	He	584	’ cried Bertha , with a smile of incredulity . ‘
33434	33438	33411	33411	He	584	’ said Caleb . ‘
33496	33519	33520	33520	Your	586	’ She turned her wonder - stricken face towards him still ; but drew back , and clung closer to her friend . ‘
33531	33535	33527	33529	my poor one	588	’ said Caleb , ‘
33591	33592	33598	33598	fancies	591	’ ‘
33600	33616	33617	33617	You	0	’ she said hurriedly , and turning very pale , and still retiring from him . ‘
33623	33624	33617	33617	You	0	’ ‘
33632	33636	33630	33630	Bertha	62	’ pleaded Caleb . ‘
33648	33649	33645	33646	my dove	593	’ ‘
33661	33672	33655	33655	you	289	’ she answered , in a term of keen reproach . ‘
33693	33731	33688	33688	I	0	’ In the anguish of her heart , she stretched out her hands , as if she were groping her way ; then spread them , in a manner most forlorn and sad , upon her face . ‘
33741	33745	33688	33688	I	0	’ said Caleb , ‘
33803	33804	33788	33788	I	0	’ ‘
33808	33824	33827	33827	you	0	’ cried the Blind Girl , tortured , as it seemed , almost beyond endurance , ‘
33871	33998	33999	33999	Mary	46	’ Her afflicted father hung his head , and offered no reply but in his penitence and sorrow . She had been but a short time in this passion of regret , when the Cricket on the Hearth , unheard by all but her , began to chirp . Not merrily , but in a low , faint , sorrowing way . It was so mournful that her tears began to flow ; and when the Presence which had been beside the Carrier all night , appeared behind her , pointing to her father , they fell down like rain . She heard the Cricket - voice more plainly soon , and was conscious , through her blindness , of the Presence hovering about her father . ‘
34001	34007	33999	33999	Mary	46	’ said the Blind Girl , ‘
34020	34021	33999	33999	Mary	46	’ ‘
34059	34069	34057	34057	Bertha	62	’ Dot continued in a low , clear voice , ‘
34081	34100	34075	34075	his	602	’ The Blind Girl , greatly agitated , rose , and led the Carrier ’s little wife aside . ‘
34125	34131	34139	34139	you	604	’ she said , trembling ; ‘
34143	34144	34139	34139	you	604	’ ‘
34147	34148	34139	34139	you	604	’ ‘
34152	34182	34139	34139	you	604	’ Dot saw she knew , already , and was silent . The Blind Girl spread her hands before her face again . But in quite another manner now . ‘
34218	34219	34216	34216	you	62	’ ‘
34226	34227	34216	34216	you	62	’ ‘

34286	34295	34283	34283	I	0	’ said Dot , who understood her well , ‘
34329	34330	34327	34327	Bertha	62	’ ‘
34341	34342	34343	34343	He	609	’ ‘
34419	34445	34409	34409	I	0	’ The Blind Girl broke away from her ; and throwing herself upon her knees before him , took the grey head to her breast . ‘
34457	34461	34454	34454	my	0	’ she cried . ‘
34500	34510	34490	34498	the father who has been so loving to me	613	’ There were no words for Caleb ’s emotion . ‘
34521	34533	34490	34498	the father who has been so loving to me	613	’ exclaimed the Blind Girl , holding him in her embrace , ‘
34601	34606	34608	34608	Bertha	62	’ Caleb managed to articulate ‘
34610	34611	34608	34608	Bertha	62	’ ‘
34621	34634	34617	34617	I	0	’ said the girl , caressing him with tears of exquisite affection , ‘
34662	34663	34664	34671	The fresh smart father in the blue coat	619	’ ‘
34675	34680	34673	34673	Bertha	62	’ said poor Caleb . ‘

34691	34695	34673	34673	Bertha	62	’ she answered . ‘
34795	34853	34854	34854	Father	57	’ Dot ’s whole attention had been concentrated , during this discourse , upon the father and daughter ; but looking , now , towards the little Haymaker in the Moorish meadow , she saw that the clock was within a few minutes of striking , and fell , immediately , into a nervous and excited state . ‘
34856	34862	34863	34863	Mary	46	’ said Bertha , hesitating . ‘
34865	34866	34863	34863	Mary	46	’ ‘
34872	34876	34863	34863	Mary	46	’ returned Caleb . ‘
34881	34882	34878	34878	she	46	’ ‘
34906	34907	34892	34892	You	57	’ ‘
34921	34925	34917	34917	I	0	’ returned Caleb , ‘
34962	34995	34938	34938	I	0	’ Confident as the Blind Girl had been when she asked the question , her delight and pride in the reply and her renewed embrace of Dot , were charming to behold . ‘
35010	35014	35020	35020	I	0	’ said Dot . ‘
35072	35073	35060	35060	You	62	’ ‘

35094	35121	35088	35088	you	62	’ said Dot , placing her hand upon her heart , and evidently talking on , as fast as she could to hide its palpitating state , ‘
35225	35275	35320	35320	Bertha	62	’ Caleb wondered what this meant ; perceiving that she spoke to him , no less than to his daughter . He saw her , with astonishment , so fluttered and distressed that she could scarcely breathe ; and holding to a chair , to save herself from falling . ‘
35281	35285	35320	35320	Bertha	62	’ she panted . ‘
35327	35374	35320	35320	Bertha	62	’ — She uttered a wild cry of uncontrollable delight ; and running up to Caleb put her hands upon his eyes , as a young man rushed into the room , and flinging away his hat into the air , came sweeping down upon them . ‘
35379	35383	35320	35320	Bertha	62	’ cried Dot . ‘
35386	35387	35320	35320	Bertha	62	’ ‘
35391	35392	35320	35320	Bertha	62	’ ‘

35435	35440	35442	35442	Dot	19	‘ He is alive ! ’
35457	35488	35442	35442	Dot	19	‘ look at him ! See where he stands before you , healthy and strong ! Your own dear son ! Your own dear living , loving brother , Bertha ! ’
35635	35640	35642	35642	Caleb	34	‘ Look , John ! ’
35646	35684	35642	35642	Caleb	34	‘ look here ! My own boy from the Golden South Americas ! My own son ! Him that you fitted out , and sent away yourself ! Him that you were always such a friend to ! ’
35718	35725	35709	35714	the Deaf Man in the Cart	647	‘ Edward ! Was it you ? ’
35726	35732	35734	35734	Dot	19	‘ Now tell him all ! ’
35736	35763	35734	35734	Dot	19	‘ Tell him all , Edward ; and do n’t spare me , for nothing shall make me spare myself in his eyes , ever again . ’
35764	35770	35772	35772	Edward	72	‘ I was the man , ’
35774	35790	35792	35793	the Carrier	132	‘ And could you steal , disguised , into the house of your old friend ? ’
35795	35832	35792	35793	the Carrier	132	‘ There was a frank boy once — how many years is it , Caleb , since we heard that he was dead , and had it proved , we thought?—who never would have done that . ’
35833	35853	35855	35855	Edward	72	‘ There was a generous friend of mine , once ; more a father to me than a friend ; ’
35857	35886	35855	35855	Edward	72	‘ who never would have judged me , or any other man , unheard . You were he . So I am certain you will hear me now . ’
35907	35918	35895	35895	Dot	19	‘ Well ! that ’s but fair . I will . ’
35919	35932	35934	35934	Edward	72	‘ You must know that when I left here , a boy , ’
35936	35983	35895	35895	Dot	19	‘ I was in love , and my love was returned . She was a very young girl , who perhaps ( you may tell me ) did n’t know her own mind . But I knew mine , and I had a passion for her . ’
35984	35988	35990	35991	the Carrier	132	‘ You had ! ’
35993	35996	35990	35991	the Carrier	132	‘ You ! ’
35997	36002	36004	36005	the other	835	‘ Indeed I had , ’
36007	36029	36004	36005	the other	835	‘ And she returned it . I have ever since believed she did , and now I am sure she did . ’
36030	36035	36037	36038	the Carrier	132	‘ Heaven help me ! ’
36040	36047	36037	36038	the Carrier	132	‘ This is worse than all . ’
36048	36053	36055	36055	Edward	72	‘ Constant to her , ’
36057	36252	36055	36055	Edward	72	‘ and returning , full of hope , after many hardships and perils , to redeem my part of our old contract , I heard , twenty miles away , that she was false to me ; that she had forgotten me ; and had bestowed herself upon another and a richer man . I had no mind to reproach her ; but I wished to see her , and to prove beyond dispute that this was true . I hoped she might have been forced into it , against her own desire and recollection . It would be small comfort , but it would be some , I thought , and on I came . That I might have the truth , the real truth ; observing freely for myself , and judging for myself , without obstruction on the one hand , or presenting my own influence ( if I had any ) before her , on the other ; I dressed myself unlike myself — you know how ; and waited on the road — you know where . You had no suspicion of me ; neither had — had she , ’
36257	36275	36055	36055	Edward	72	‘ until I whispered in her ear at that fireside , and she so nearly betrayed me . ’
36276	36291	36293	36293	Dot	19	‘ But when she knew that Edward was alive , and had come back , ’
36312	36360	36362	36362	Dot	19	‘ and when she knew his purpose , she advised him by all means to keep his secret close ; for his old friend John Peerybingle was much too open in his nature , and too clumsy in all artifice — being a clumsy man in general , ’
36384	36582	36376	36376	she	653	’ sobbed the little woman—‘told him all , and how his sweetheart had believed him to be dead ; and how she had at last been over - persuaded by her mother into a marriage which the silly , dear old thing called advantageous ; and when she — that ’s me again , John — told him they were not yet married ( though close upon it ) , and that it would be nothing but a sacrifice if it went on , for there was no love on her side ; and when he went nearly mad with joy to hear it ; then she — that ’s me again — said she would go between them , as she had often done before in old times , John , and would sound his sweetheart and be sure that what she — me again , John — said and thought was right . And it was right , John ! And they were brought together , John ! And they were married , John , an hour ago ! And here ’s the Bride ! And Gruff and Tackleton may die a bachelor ! And I ’m
36594	36679	36682	36682	John	17	’ She was an irresistible little woman , if that be anything to the purpose ; and never so completely irresistible as in her present transports . There never were congratulations so endearing and delicious , as those she lavished on herself and on the Bride . Amid the tumult of emotions in his breast , the honest Carrier had stood , confounded . Flying , now , towards her , Dot stretched out her hand to stop him , and retreated as before . ‘
36722	36807	36721	36721	I	0	’m very sorry . I did n’t think it any harm , till I came and sat down by you on the little stool last night . But when I knew by what was written in your face , that you had seen me walking in the gallery with Edward , and when I knew what you thought , I felt how giddy and how wrong it was . But oh , dear John , how could you , could you , think so ! ’
36835	36899	36829	36829	she	1078	‘ Do n’t love me yet , please , John ! Not for a long time yet ! When I was sad about this intended marriage , dear , it was because I remembered May and Edward such young lovers ; and knew that her heart was far away from Tackleton . You believe that , now . Do n’t you , John ? ’
36917	36996	36912	36912	she	1078	‘ No ; keep there , please , John ! When I laugh at you , as I sometimes do , John , and call you clumsy and a dear old goose , and names of that sort , it ’s because I love you , John , so well , and take such pleasure in your ways , and would n’t see you altered in the least respect to have you made a King to - morrow . ’
36997	37000	37002	37002	Caleb	34	‘ Hooroar ! ’
37007	37011	37002	37002	Caleb	34	‘ My opinion ! ’
37012	37054	36912	36912	she	1078	‘ And when I speak of people being middle - aged , and steady , John , and pretend that we are a humdrum couple , going on in a jog - trot sort of way , it ’s only because I ’m
37086	37107	37121	37121	you	17	’ She saw that he was coming ; and stopped him again . But she was very nearly too late . ‘
37341	37515	37519	37520	the Devil	663	’ You never will derive so much delight from seeing a glorious little woman in the arms of a third party , as you would have felt if you had seen Dot run into the Carrier ’s embrace . It was the most complete , unmitigated , soul - fraught little piece of earnestness that ever you beheld in all your days . You may be sure the Carrier was in a state of perfect rapture ; and you may be sure Dot was likewise ; and you may be sure they all were , inclusive of Miss Slowboy , who wept copiously for joy , and wishing to include her young charge in the general interchange of congratulations , handed round the Baby to everybody in succession , as if it were something to drink . But , now , the sound of wheels was heard again outside the door ; and somebody exclaimed that Gruff and Tackleton was coming back . Speedily that worthy gentleman appeared , looking warm and flustered . ‘
37527	37531	37524	37525	John Peerybingle	17	’ said Tackleton . ‘
37609	37610	37600	37600	she	45	’ ‘
37618	37622	37612	37612	I	0	’ returned Edward . ‘
37630	37631	37623	37623	I	0	’ ‘
37640	37644	37634	37634	you	0	’ said Tackleton . ‘
37659	37668	37650	37650	I	0	’ returned the other , with a smile , ‘
37688	37703	37704	37704	I	0	’ The look that Tackleton bestowed upon him , and the start he gave ! ‘
37710	37727	37704	37704	I	0	’ said Edward , holding out May ’s left hand , and especially the third finger ; ‘
37756	37786	37787	37788	Miss Slowboy	24	’ Tackleton looked hard at the third finger , and took a little piece of silver - paper , apparently containing a ring , from his waistcoat - pocket . ‘
37790	37794	37787	37788	Miss Slowboy	24	’ said Tackleton . ‘
37809	37810	37807	37807	Thank’ee	38	’ ‘
37837	37841	37833	37833	I	0	’ said Edward . ‘
37874	37880	37861	37861	I	0	’ said May , blushing . ‘
37884	37888	37861	37861	I	0	’ said Tackleton . ‘
37912	37913	37909	37909	I	0	’ ‘
37919	37924	37909	37909	I	0	’ returned the bridegroom . ‘
37936	37951	37934	37934	sir	182	’ said Tackleton , scrutinising his face narrowly , and making a low bow . ‘
37959	37960	37952	37952	I	0	’ ‘
37963	37964	37961	37961	Thank’ee	38	’ ‘
37968	37982	37965	37966	Mrs. Peerybingle	12	’ said Tackleton , turning suddenly to where she stood with her husband ; ‘
38046	38509	38014	38015	John Peerybingle	17	’ With these words he carried it off , and carried himself off too : merely stopping at the door , to take the flowers and favours from his horse ’s head , and to kick that animal once , in the ribs , as a means of informing him that there was a screw loose in his arrangements . Of course it became a serious duty now , to make such a day of it , as should mark these events for a high Feast and Festival in the Peerybingle Calendar for evermore . Accordingly , Dot went to work to produce such an entertainment , as should reflect undying honour on the house and on every one concerned ; and in a very short space of time , she was up to her dimpled elbows in flour , and whitening the Carrier ’s coat , every time he came near her , by stopping him to give him a kiss . That good fellow washed the greens , and peeled the turnips , and broke the plates , and upset iron pots full of cold water on the fire , and made himself useful in all sorts of ways : while a couple of professional assistants , hastily called in from somewhere in the neighbourhood , as on a point of life or death , ran against each other in all the doorways and round all the corners , and everybody tumbled over Tilly Slowboy and the Baby , everywhere . Tilly never came out in such force before . Her ubiquity was the theme of general admiration . She was a stumbling - block in the passage at five - and - twenty minutes past two ; a man - trap in the kitchen at half - past two precisely ; and a pitfall in the garret at five - and - twenty minutes to three . The Baby ’s head was , as it were , a test and touchstone for every description of matter,—animal , vegetable , and mineral . Nothing was in use that day that did n’t come , at some time or other , into close acquaintance with it . Then , there was a great Expedition set on foot to go and find out Mrs. Fielding ; and to be dismally penitent to that excellent gentlewoman ; and to bring her back , by force , if needful , to be happy and forgiving . And when the Expedition first discovered her , she would listen to no terms at all , but said , an unspeakable number of times , that ever she should have lived to see the day ! and could n’t be got to say anything else , except , ‘
38517	39152	39153	39155	a living man	679	’ which seemed absurd , on account of her not being dead , or anything at all like it . After a time , she lapsed into a state of dreadful calmness , and observed , that when that unfortunate train of circumstances had occurred in the Indigo Trade , she had foreseen that she would be exposed , during her whole life , to every species of insult and contumely ; and that she was glad to find it was the case ; and begged they would n’t trouble themselves about her,—for what was she ? oh , dear ! a nobody!—but would forget that such a being lived , and would take their course in life without her . From this bitterly sarcastic mood , she passed into an angry one , in which she gave vent to the remarkable expression that the worm would turn if trodden on ; and , after that , she yielded to a soft regret , and said , if they had only given her their confidence , what might she not have had it in her power to suggest ! Taking advantage of this crisis in her feelings , the Expedition embraced her ; and she very soon had her gloves on , and was on her way to John Peerybingle ’s in a state of unimpeachable gentility ; with a paper parcel at her side containing a cap of state , almost as tall , and quite as stiff , as a mitre . Then , there were Dot ’s father and mother to come , in another little chaise ; and they were behind their time ; and fears were entertained ; and there was much looking out for them down the road ; and Mrs. Fielding always would look in the wrong and morally impossible direction ; and being apprised thereof , hoped she might take the liberty of looking where she pleased . At last they came : a chubby little couple , jogging along in a snug and comfortable little way that quite belonged to the Dot family ; and Dot and her mother , side by side , were wonderful to see . They were so like each other . Then , Dot ’s mother had to renew her acquaintance with May ’s mother ; and May ’s mother always stood on her gentility ; and Dot ’s mother never stood on anything but her active little feet . And old Dot — so to call Dot ’s father , I forgot it was n’t his right name , but never mind — took liberties , and shook hands at first sight , and seemed to think a cap but so much starch and muslin , and did n’t defer himself at all to the Indigo Trade , but said there was no help for it now ; and , in Mrs. Fielding ’s summing up , was a good - natured kind of man — but coarse , my dear . I would n’t have missed Dot , doing the honours in her wedding - gown , my benison on her bright face ! for any money . No ! nor the good Carrier , so jovial and so ruddy , at the bottom of the table . Nor the brown , fresh sailor - fellow , and his handsome wife . Nor any one among them . To have missed the dinner would have been to miss as jolly and as stout a meal as man need eat ; and to have missed the overflowing cups in which they drank The Wedding - Day , would have been the greatest miss of all . After dinner , Caleb sang the song about the Sparkling Bowl . As I ’m
39253	39278	39250	39250	he	117	‘ Mr. Tackleton ’s compliments , and as he has n’t got no use for the cake himself , p’raps you ’ll eat it . ’
39400	39422	39430	39430	he	117	‘ Mr. Tackleton ’s compliments , and he ’s sent a few toys for the Babby . They ai n’t ugly . ’
39490	39494	39496	39499	the Toy - merchant	816	‘ Mrs. Peerybingle ! ’
39505	39507	39496	39499	the Toy - merchant	816	‘ I ’m
39511	39533	39496	39499	the Toy - merchant	816	’m more sorry than I was this morning . I have had time to think of it . John Peerybingle ! I ’m
39662	39722	39723	39723	John	17	’ He was at home in five minutes . You never saw such a fellow . What _ had _ he been doing with himself all his life , never to have known , before , his great capacity of being jovial ! Or what had the Fairies been doing with him , to have effected such a change ! ‘
