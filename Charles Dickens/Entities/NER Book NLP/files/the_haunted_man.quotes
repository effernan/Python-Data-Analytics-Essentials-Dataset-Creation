94	103	88	88	Everybody	82	“ but _ that ’s _ no rule , ”
1874	1877	1851	1854	one querulous old rook	181	“ Caw ! ”
1944	1949	1951	1951	he	174	“ Who ’s that ? ”
1953	1957	1951	1951	he	174	“ Come in ! ”
2036	2044	2046	2051	a fresh - coloured busy man	184	“ I ’m humbly fearful , sir , ”
2099	2124	2085	2085	he	184	“ that it ’s a good bit past the time to - night . But Mrs. William has been taken off her legs so often ”
2126	2139	2085	2085	he	184	“ By the wind ? Ay ! I have heard it rising . ”
2140	2179	2180	2180	He	174	“ — By the wind , sir — that it ’s a mercy she got home at all . Oh dear , yes . Yes . It was by the wind , Mr. Redlaw . By the wind . ”
2278	2311	2558	2559	Mr. Swidger	26	“ Mrs. William is of course subject at any time , sir , to be taken off her balance by the elements . She is not formed superior to _ that _ . ”
2312	2315	2317	2318	Mr. Redlaw	24	“ No , ”
2326	2524	2317	2318	Mr. Redlaw	24	“ No , sir . Mrs. William may be taken off her balance by Earth ; as for example , last Sunday week , when sloppy and greasy , and she going out to tea with her newest sister - in - law , and having a pride in herself , and wishing to appear perfectly spotless though pedestrian . Mrs. William may be taken off her balance by Air ; as being once over - persuaded by a friend to try a swing at Peckham Fair , which acted on her constitution instantly like a steam - boat . Mrs. William may be taken off her balance by Fire ; as on a false alarm of engines at her mother ’s , when she went two miles in her nightcap . Mrs. William may be taken off her balance by Water ; as at Battersea , when rowed into the piers by her young nephew , Charley Swidger junior , aged twelve , which had no idea of boats whatever . But these are elements . Mrs. William must be taken out of elements for the strength of _ her _ character to come into play . ”
2535	2538	2655	2656	Mr. Swidger	26	“ Yes , ”
2546	2556	2558	2559	Mr. Swidger	26	“ Yes , sir . Oh dear , yes ! ”
2576	2629	2558	2559	Mr. Swidger	26	“ That ’s where it is , sir . That ’s what I always say myself , sir . Such a many of us Swidgers!—Pepper . Why there ’s my father , sir , superannuated keeper and custodian of this Institution , eighty - seven year old . He ’s a Swidger!—Spoon . ”
2630	2635	2644	2644	he	186	“ True , William , ”
2648	2653	2655	2656	Mr. Swidger	26	“ Yes , sir , ”
2658	2772	2655	2656	Mr. Swidger	26	“ That ’s what I always say , sir . You may call him the trunk of the tree!—Bread . Then you come to his successor , my unworthy self — Salt — and Mrs. William , Swidgers both.—Knife and fork . Then you come to all my brothers and their families , Swidgers , man and woman , boy and girl . Why , what with cousins , uncles , aunts , and relationships of this , that , and t’other degree , and whatnot degree , and marriages , and lyings - in , the Swidgers — Tumbler — might take hold of hands , and make a ring round England ! ”
2829	2946	2817	2817	he	26	“ Yes , sir ! That ’s just what I say myself , sir . Mrs. William and me have often said so . ‘ There ’s Swidgers enough , ’ we say , ‘ without _ our _ voluntary contributions,’—Butter . In fact , sir , my father is a family in himself — Castors — to take care of ; and it happens all for the best that we have no child of our own , though it ’s made Mrs. William rather quiet - like , too . Quite ready for the fowl and mashed potatoes , sir ? Mrs. William said she ’d dish in ten minutes when I left the Lodge . ”
2947	2953	2955	2956	the other	188	“ I am quite ready , ”
2971	2982	2984	2985	the keeper	189	“ Mrs. William has been at it again , sir ! ”
3021	3054	3005	3006	Mr. Redlaw	24	“ What I always say myself , sir . She _ will _ do it ! There ’s a motherly feeling in Mrs. William ’s breast that must and will have went . ”
3055	3061	3005	3006	Mr. Redlaw	24	“ What has she done ? ”
3062	3118	3120	3120	he	24	“ Why , sir , not satisfied with being a sort of mother to all the young gentlemen that come up from a variety of parts , to attend your courses of lectures at this ancient foundation — it ’s surprising how stone - chaney catches the heat this frosty weather , to be sure ! ”
3130	3133	3135	3136	Mr. Redlaw	24	“ Well ? ”
3138	3149	3151	3152	Mr. William	26	“ That ’s just what I say myself , sir , ”
3167	3374	3151	3152	Mr. William	26	“ That ’s exactly where it is , sir ! There ai n’t one of our students but appears to regard Mrs. William in that light . Every day , right through the course , they puts their heads into the Lodge , one after another , and have all got something to tell her , or something to ask her . ‘ Swidge ’ is the appellation by which they speak of Mrs. William in general , among themselves , I ’m told ; but that ’s what I say , sir . Better be called ever so far out of your name , if it ’s done in real liking , than have it made ever so much of , and not cared about ! What ’s a name for ? To know a person by . If Mrs. William is known by something better than her name — I allude to Mrs. William ’s qualities and disposition — never mind her name , though it _ is _ Swidger , by rights . Let ’em call her Swidge , Widge , Bridge — Lord ! London Bridge , Blackfriars , Chelsea , Putney , Waterloo , or Hammersmith Suspension — if they like . ”
3714	3722	3724	3725	her husband	194	“ Punctual , of course , Milly , ”
3733	3755	3724	3725	her husband	194	“ or it would n’t be you . Here ’s Mrs. William , sir!—He looks lonelier than ever to - night , ”
3768	3773	3724	3725	her husband	194	“ and ghostlier altogether . ”
3835	3847	3849	3850	Mr. Redlaw	24	“ What is that the old man has in his arms ? ”
3861	3866	3872	3872	Milly	31	“ Holly , sir , ”
3874	3884	3872	3872	Milly	31	“ That ’s what I say myself , sir , ”
3897	3909	3872	3872	Milly	31	“ Berries is so seasonable to the time of year!—Brown gravy ! ”
3910	3919	3921	3922	the Chemist	202	“ Another Christmas come , another year gone ! ”
3929	3964	3970	3970	his	26	“ More figures in the lengthening sum of recollection that we work and work at to our torment , till Death idly jumbles all together , and rubs all out . So , Philip ! ”
4030	4038	4040	4042	the old man	1040	“ My duty to you , sir , ”
4044	4111	4040	4042	the old man	1040	“ Should have spoke before , sir , but know your ways , Mr. Redlaw — proud to say — and wait till spoke to ! Merry Christmas , sir , and Happy New Year , and many of ’em . Have had a pretty many of ’em myself — ha , ha!—and may take the liberty of wishing ’em . I ’m eighty - seven ! ”
4112	4124	4126	4127	the other	188	“ Have you had so many that were merry and happy ? ”
4129	4138	4140	4142	the old man	1040	“ Ay , sir , ever so many , ”
4144	4159	4161	4162	Mr. Redlaw	24	“ Is his memory impaired with age ? It is to be expected now , ”
4173	4182	4184	4185	Mr. William	26	“ Not a morsel of it , sir , ”
4187	4248	4184	4185	Mr. William	26	“ That ’s exactly what I say myself , sir . There never was such a memory as my father ’s . He ’s the most wonderful man in the world . He do n’t know what forgetting means . It ’s the very observation I ’m always making to Mrs. William , sir , if you ’ll believe me ! ”
4323	4340	4341	4341	he	202	“ It recalls the time when many of those years were old and new , then ? ”
4355	4359	4341	4341	he	202	“ Does it ? ”
4360	4366	4368	4368	Philip	34	“ Oh many , many ! ”
4376	4383	4368	4368	Philip	34	“ I ’m eighty - seven ! ”
4384	4392	4394	4395	the Chemist	202	“ Merry and happy , was it ? ”
4401	4409	4394	4395	the Chemist	202	“ Merry and happy , old man ? ”
4410	4420	4422	4424	the old man	1040	“ Maybe as high as that , no higher , ”
4447	4560	4422	4424	the old man	1040	“ when I first remember ’em ! Cold , sunshiny day it was , out a - walking , when some one — it was my mother as sure as you stand there , though I do n’t know what her blessed face was like , for she took ill and died that Christmas - time — told me they were food for birds . The pretty little fellow thought — that ’s me , you understand — that birds ’ eyes were so bright , perhaps , because the berries that they lived on in the winter were so bright . I recollect that . And I ’m eighty - seven ! ”
4561	4566	4568	4569	the other	188	“ Merry and happy ! ”
4586	4595	4572	4572	his	188	“ Merry and happy — and remember well ? ”
4596	4603	4605	4607	the old man	1040	“ Ay , ay , ay ! ”
4614	4689	4605	4607	the old man	1040	“ I remember ’em well in my school time , year after year , and all the merry - making that used to come along with them . I was a strong chap then , Mr. Redlaw ; and , if you ’ll believe me , had n’t my match at football within ten mile . Where ’s my son William ? Had n’t my match at football , William , within ten mile ! ”
4690	4700	4702	4703	the son	209	“ That ’s what I always say , father ! ”
4711	4726	4702	4703	the son	209	“ You ARE a Swidger , if ever there was one of the family ! ”
4727	4730	4732	4734	the old man	1040	“ Dear ! ”
4747	4885	4740	4740	he	1040	“ His mother — my son William ’s my youngest son — and I , have sat among ’em all , boys and girls , little children and babies , many a year , when the berries like these were not shining half so bright all round us , as their bright faces . Many of ’em are gone ; she ’s gone ; and my son George ( our eldest , who was her pride more than all the rest ! ) is fallen very low : but I can see them , when I look here , alive and healthy , as they used to be in those days ; and I can see him , thank God , in his innocence . It ’s a blessed thing to me , at eighty - seven . ”
4906	4935	4937	4939	the old man	1040	“ When my circumstances got to be not so good as formerly , through not being honestly dealt by , and I first come here to be custodian , ”
4941	4966	4937	4939	the old man	1040	“ — which was upwards of fifty years ago — where ’s my son William ? More than half a century ago , William ! ”
4967	4976	4978	4979	the son	209	“ That ’s what I say , father , ”
4988	5016	4978	4979	the son	209	“ that ’s exactly where it is . Two times ought ’s an ought , and twice five ten , and there ’s a hundred of ’em . ”
5017	5036	5038	5040	the old man	1040	“ It was quite a pleasure to know that one of our founders — or more correctly speaking , ”
5055	5208	5038	5040	the old man	1040	“ one of the learned gentlemen that helped endow us in Queen Elizabeth ’s time , for we were founded afore her day — left in his will , among the other bequests he made us , so much to buy holly , for garnishing the walls and windows , come Christmas . There was something homely and friendly in it . Being but strange here , then , and coming at Christmas time , we took a liking for his very picter that hangs in what used to be , anciently , afore our ten poor gentlemen commuted for an annual stipend in money , our great Dinner Hall.—A sedate gentleman in a peaked beard , with a ruff round his neck , and a scroll below him , in old English letters , ‘ Lord ! keep my memory green ! ’ You know all about him , Mr. Redlaw ? ”
5209	5219	4978	4979	the son	209	“ I know the portrait hangs there , Philip . ”
5220	5358	5038	5040	the old man	1040	“ Yes , sure , it ’s the second on the right , above the panelling . I was going to say — he has helped to keep _ my _ memory green , I thank him ; for going round the building every year , as I ’m a doing now , and freshening up the bare rooms with these branches and berries , freshens up my bare old brain . One year brings back another , and that year another , and those others numbers ! At last , it seems to me as if the birth - time of our Lord was the birth - time of all I have ever had affection for , or mourned for , or delighted in,—and they ’re a pretty many , for I ’m eighty - seven ! ”
5359	5364	5366	5366	Redlaw	24	“ Merry and happy , ”
5377	5384	5386	5387	old Philip	34	“ So you see , sir , ”
5410	5479	5407	5407	he	34	“ I have plenty to keep , when I keep this present season . Now , where ’s my quiet Mouse ? Chattering ’s the sin of my time of life , and there ’s half the building to do yet , if the cold do n’t freeze us first , or the wind do n’t blow us away , or the darkness do n’t swallow us up . ”
5503	5510	5512	5514	the old man	1040	“ Come away , my dear , ”
5516	5562	5512	5514	the old man	1040	“ Mr. Redlaw wo n’t settle to his dinner , otherwise , till it ’s cold as the winter . I hope you ’ll excuse me rambling on , sir , and I wish you good night , and , once again , a merry — ”
5563	5566	5568	5569	Mr. Redlaw	24	“ Stay ! ”
5603	5644	5512	5514	the old man	1040	“ Spare me another moment , Philip . William , you were going to tell me something to your excellent wife ’s honour . It will not be disagreeable to her to hear you praise her . What was it ? ”
5645	5659	5661	5663	Mr. William Swidger	26	“ Why , that ’s where it is , you see , sir , ”
5673	5683	5661	5663	Mr. William Swidger	26	“ Mrs. William ’s got her eye upon me . ”
5684	5696	5512	5514	the old man	1040	“ But you ’re not afraid of Mrs. William ’s eye ? ”
5697	5704	5706	5707	Mr. Swidger	26	“ Why , no , sir , ”
5709	5758	5706	5707	Mr. Swidger	26	“ that ’s what I say myself . It was n’t made to be afraid of . It would n’t have been made so mild , if that was the intention . But I would n’t like to — Milly!—him , you know . Down in the Buildings . ”
5801	5810	5812	5813	Mr. William	26	“ Him , you know , my love , ”
5815	5848	5812	5813	Mr. William	26	“ Down in the Buildings . Tell , my dear ! You ’re the works of Shakespeare in comparison with myself . Down in the Buildings , you know , my love.—Student . ”
5849	5852	5854	5855	Mr. Redlaw	24	“ Student ? ”
5861	5870	5872	5873	Mr. William	26	“ That ’s what I say , sir ! ”
5882	5916	5872	5873	Mr. William	26	“ If it was n’t the poor student down in the Buildings , why should you wish to hear it from Mrs. William ’s lips ? Mrs. William , my dear — Buildings . ”
5917	5923	5925	5925	Milly	31	“ I did n’t know , ”
5939	6020	5925	5925	Milly	31	“ that William had said anything about it , or I would n’t have come . I asked him not to . It ’s a sick young gentleman , sir — and very poor , I am afraid — who is too ill to go home this holiday - time , and lives , unknown to any one , in but a common kind of lodging for a gentleman , down in Jerusalem Buildings . That ’s all , sir . ”
6021	6030	6032	6033	the Chemist	202	“ Why have I never heard of him ? ”
6038	6061	6032	6033	the Chemist	202	“ Why has he not made his situation known to me ? Sick!—give me my hat and cloak . Poor!—what house?—what number ? ”
6062	6073	6075	6075	Milly	31	“ Oh , you must n’t go there , sir , ”
6098	6103	6032	6033	the Chemist	202	“ Not go there ? ”
6104	6110	6112	6112	Milly	31	“ Oh dear , no ! ”
6128	6136	6115	6115	her	31	“ It could n’t be thought of ! ”
6137	6146	6032	6033	the Chemist	202	“ What do you mean ? Why not ? ”
6147	6155	6157	6159	Mr. William Swidger	26	“ Why , you see , sir , ”
6165	6247	6157	6159	Mr. William Swidger	26	“ that ’s what I say . Depend upon it , the young gentleman would never have made his situation known to one of his own sex . Mrs. Williams has got into his confidence , but that ’s quite different . They all confide in Mrs. William ; they all trust _ her _ . A man , sir , could n’t have got a whisper out of him ; but woman , sir , and Mrs. William combined — ! ”
6248	6262	6264	6265	Mr. Redlaw	24	“ There is good sense and delicacy in what you say , William , ”
6295	6302	6304	6304	Milly	31	“ Oh dear no , sir ! ”
6311	6322	6304	6304	Milly	31	“ Worse and worse ! Could n’t be dreamed of ! ”
6421	6476	6400	6400	she	31	“ Oh dear no , sir ! He said that of all the world he would not be known to you , or receive help from you — though he is a student in your class . I have made no terms of secrecy with you , but I trust to your honour completely . ”
6477	6484	6400	6400	she	31	“ Why did he say so ? ”
6485	6494	6496	6496	Milly	31	“ Indeed I ca n’t tell , sir , ”
6503	6560	6496	6496	Milly	31	“ because I am not at all clever , you know ; and I wanted to be useful to him in making things neat and comfortable about him , and employed myself that way . But I know he is poor , and lonely , and I think he is somehow neglected too.—How dark it is ! ”
6584	6590	6591	6591	he	237	“ What more about him ? ”
6594	6607	6609	6609	Milly	31	“ He is engaged to be married when he can afford it , ”
6611	6649	6609	6609	Milly	31	“ and is studying , I think , to qualify himself to earn a living . I have seen , a long time , that he has studied hard and denied himself much.—How very dark it is ! ”
6650	6658	6660	6662	the old man	1040	“ It ’s turned colder , too , ”
6668	6700	6660	6662	the old man	1040	“ There ’s a chill and dismal feeling in the room . Where ’s my son William ? William , my boy , turn the lamp , and rouse the fire ! ”
6713	6727	6732	6732	herself	31	“ He muttered in his broken sleep yesterday afternoon , after talking to me ”
6734	6775	6732	6732	herself	31	“ about some one dead , and some great wrong done that could never be forgotten ; but whether to him or to another person , I do n’t know . Not _ by _ him , I am sure . ”
6776	6813	6815	6816	Mr. William	26	“ And , in short , Mrs. William , you see — which she would n’t say herself , Mr. Redlaw , if she was to stop here till the new year after this next one — ”
6828	6917	6815	6816	Mr. William	26	“ has done him worlds of good ! Bless you , worlds of good ! All at home just the same as ever — my father made as snug and comfortable — not a crumb of litter to be found in the house , if you were to offer fifty pound ready money for it — Mrs. William apparently never out of the way — yet Mrs. William backwards and forwards , backwards and forwards , up and down , up and down , a mother to him ! ”
6937	7078	7080	7081	Mr. William	26	“ Not content with this , sir , Mrs. William goes and finds , this very night , when she was coming home ( why it ’s not above a couple of hours ago ) , a creature more like a young wild beast than a young child , shivering upon a door - step . What does Mrs. William do , but brings it home to dry it , and feed it , and keep it till our old Bounty of food and flannel is given away , on Christmas morning ! If it ever felt a fire before , it ’s as much as ever it did ; for it ’s sitting in the old Lodge chimney , staring at ours as if its ravenous eyes would never shut again . It ’s sitting there , at least , ”
7089	7095	7080	7081	Mr. William	26	“ unless it ’s bolted ! ”
7096	7102	7104	7105	the Chemist	202	“ Heaven keep her happy ! ”
7108	7150	7104	7105	the Chemist	202	“ and you too , Philip ! and you , William ! I must consider what to do in this . I may desire to see this student , I ’ll not detain you any longer now . Good - night ! ”
7151	7160	7162	7164	the old man	1040	“ I thank’ee , sir , I thank’ee ! ”
7166	7315	7162	7164	the old man	1040	“ for Mouse , and for my son William , and for myself . Where ’s my son William ? William , you take the lantern and go on first , through them long dark passages , as you did last year and the year afore . Ha ha ! _ I _ remember — though I ’m eighty - seven ! ‘ Lord , keep my memory green ! ’ It ’s a very good prayer , Mr. Redlaw , that of the learned gentleman in the peaked beard , with a ruff round his neck — hangs up , second on the right above the panelling , in what used to be , afore our ten poor gentlemen commuted , our great Dinner Hall . ‘ Lord , keep my memory green ! ’ It ’s very good and pious , sir . Amen ! Amen ! ”
7618	7622	7623	7623	he	244	“ Here again ! ”
7626	7630	7632	7633	the Phantom	44	“ Here again , ”
7635	7643	7645	7647	the haunted man	245	“ I see you in the fire , ”
7649	7668	7645	7647	the haunted man	245	“ I hear you in music , in the wind , in the dead stillness of the night . ”
7677	7688	7669	7670	The Phantom	44	“ Why do you come , to haunt me thus ? ”
7689	7697	7699	7700	the Ghost	248	“ I come as I am called , ”
7702	7707	7709	7710	the Chemist	202	“ No . Unbidden , ”
7712	7717	7719	7720	the Spectre	250	“ Unbidden be it , ”
7722	7731	7719	7720	the Spectre	250	“ It is enough . I am here . ”
7914	7919	7921	7922	the Spectre	250	“ Look upon me ! ”

My parents , at the best , were of that sort whose care soon ends , and whose duty is soon done ; who cast their offspring loose , early , as birds do theirs ; and , if they do well , claim the merit ; and , if ill , the pity . ”

8137	8194	8134	8135	the Phantom	263	“ who , in this struggle upward , found a friend . I made him — won him — bound him to me ! We worked together , side by side . All the love and confidence that in my earlier youth had had no outlet , and found no expression , I bestowed on him . ”

8205	8211	8213	8214	the Phantom	44	“ No , not all , ”
8216	8222	8223	8225	The haunted man	245	“ I had a sister . ”

8411	8448	8403	8404	the Phantom	263	“ I think he did , once . I am sure he did . Better had she loved him less — less secretly , less dearly , from the shallower depths of a more divided heart ! ”
8449	8455	8457	8458	the Chemist	202	“ Let me forget it ! ”

8535	8657	8532	8533	the Phantom	44	“ as my inferior nature might cherish , arose in my own heart . I was too poor to bind its object to my fortune then , by any thread of promise or entreaty . I loved her far too well , to seek to do it . But , more than ever I had striven in my life , I strove to climb ! Only an inch gained , brought me something nearer to the height . I toiled up ! In the late pauses of my labour at that time,—my sister ( sweet companion ! ) still sharing with me the expiring embers and the cooling hearth,—when day was breaking , what pictures of the future did I see ! ”
8658	8670	8671	8671	he	24	“ I saw them , in the fire , but now , ”

8701	8783	8785	8786	the Phantom	44	“ — Pictures of my own domestic life , in aftertime , with her who was the inspiration of my toil . Pictures of my sister , made the wife of my dear friend , on equal terms — for he had some inheritance , we none — pictures of our sobered age and mellowed happiness , and of the golden links , extending back so far , that should bind us , and our children , in a radiant garland , ”
8788	8791	8793	8795	the haunted man	245	“ Pictures , ”
8797	8813	8793	8795	the haunted man	245	“ that were delusions . Why is it my doom to remember them too well ! ”

My sister , doubly dear , doubly devoted , doubly cheerful in my home , lived on to see me famous , and my old ambition so rewarded when its spring was broken , and then — ”
8917	8921	8922	8922	he	245	“ Then died , ”
8925	8945	8922	8922	he	245	“ Died , gentle as ever ; happy ; and with no concern but for her brother . Peace ! ”
8952	8955	8957	8959	the haunted man	245	“ Remembered ! ”
8965	9074	8957	8959	the haunted man	245	“ Yes . So well remembered , that even now , when years have passed , and nothing is more idle or more visionary to me than the boyish love so long outlived , I think of it with sympathy , as if it were a younger brother ’s or a son ’s . Sometimes I even wonder when her heart first inclined to him , and how it had been affected towards me.—Not lightly , once , I think.—But that is nothing . Early unhappiness , a wound from a hand I loved and trusted , and a loss that nothing can replace , outlive such fancies . ”
9075	9078	9080	9081	the Phantom	44	“ Thus , ”
9083	9122	9080	9081	the Phantom	44	“ I bear within me a Sorrow and a Wrong . Thus I prey upon myself . Thus , memory is my curse ; and , if I could forget my sorrow and my wrong , I would ! ”

9150	9161	9128	9129	the Chemist	202	“ Why have I always that taunt in my ears ? ”

9288	9298	9277	9279	the haunted man	245	“ my life is darkened by that incessant whisper . ”
9299	9305	9307	9308	the Phantom	44	“ It is an echo , ”
9310	9330	9332	9334	the haunted man	245	“ If it be an echo of my thoughts — as now , indeed , I know it is , ”
9336	9398	9332	9334	the haunted man	245	“ why should I , therefore , be tormented ? It is not a selfish thought . I suffer it to range beyond myself . All men and women have their sorrows,—most of them their wrongs ; ingratitude , and sordid jealousy , and interest , besetting all degrees of life . Who would not forget their sorrows and their wrongs ? ”
9399	9414	9416	9417	the Phantom	263	“ Who would not , truly , and be happier and better for it ? ”

9433	9482	9431	9431	Redlaw	24	“ what do _ they _ recall ! Are there any minds in which they do not re - awaken some sorrow , or some trouble ? What is the remembrance of the old man who was here to - night ? A tissue of sorrow and trouble . ”
9483	9488	9490	9491	the Phantom	44	“ But common natures , ”
9502	9526	9490	9491	the Phantom	44	“ unenlightened minds and ordinary spirits , do not feel or reason on these things like men of higher cultivation and profounder thought . ”
9527	9530	9532	9532	Redlaw	24	“ Tempter , ”
9534	9575	9532	9532	Redlaw	24	“ whose hollow look and voice I dread more than words can express , and from whom some dim foreshadowing of greater fear is stealing over me while I speak , I hear again an echo of my own mind . ”
9576	9587	9589	9590	the Ghost	248	“ Receive it as a proof that I am powerful , ”
9592	9610	9589	9590	the Ghost	248	“ Hear what I offer ! Forget the sorrow , wrong , and trouble you have known ! ”
9611	9615	9616	9616	he	24	“ Forget them ! ”
9619	9646	9648	9649	the Spectre	48	“ I have the power to cancel their remembrance — to leave but very faint , confused traces of them , that will die out soon , ”
9651	9658	9664	9666	the haunted man	245	“ Say ! Is it done ? ”
9659	9662	9664	9666	the haunted man	245	“ Stay ! ”
9677	9744	9664	9666	the haunted man	245	“ I tremble with distrust and doubt of you ; and the dim fear you cast upon me deepens into a nameless horror I can hardly bear.—I would not deprive myself of any kindly recollection , or any sympathy that is good for me , or others . What shall I lose , if I assent to this ? What else will pass from my remembrance ? ”
9745	9783	9664	9666	the haunted man	245	“ No knowledge ; no result of study ; nothing but the intertwisted chain of feelings and associations , each in its turn dependent on , and nourished by , the banished recollections . Those will go . ”
9784	9790	9792	9794	the haunted man	245	“ Are they so many ? ”
9800	9833	9835	9836	the Phantom	263	“ They have been wo nt to show themselves in the fire , in music , in the wind , in the dead stillness of the night , in the revolving years , ”
9839	9844	9835	9836	the Phantom	263	“ In nothing else ? ”
9873	9876	9664	9666	the haunted man	245	“ Decide ! ”

9904	10023	9900	9902	the agitated man	286	“ that I have never been a hater of any kind,—never morose , indifferent , or hard , to anything around me . If , living here alone , I have made too much of all that was and might have been , and too little of what is , the evil , I believe , has fallen on me , and not on others . But , if there were poison in my body , should I not , possessed of antidotes and knowledge how to use them , use them ? If there be poison in my mind , and through this fearful shadow I can cast it out , shall I not cast it out ? ”
10024	10027	10029	10030	the Spectre	250	“ Say , ”
10032	10037	10029	10030	the Spectre	250	“ is it done ? ”
10038	10043	10044	10044	he	245	“ A moment longer ! ”
10048	10131	10044	10044	he	245	“ _ I would forget it if I could _ ! Have _ I _ thought that , alone , or has it been the thought of thousands upon thousands , generation after generation ? All human memory is fraught with sorrow and trouble . My memory is as the memory of other men , but other men have not this choice . Yes , I close the bargain . Yes ! I WILL forget my sorrow , wrong , and trouble ! ”
10132	10135	10137	10138	the Spectre	250	“ Say , ”
10140	10145	10137	10138	the Spectre	250	“ is it done ? ”
10146	10150	10044	10044	he	245	“ It is ! ”
10151	10296	10137	10138	the Spectre	250	“ IT IS . And take this with you , man whom I here renounce ! The gift that I have given , you shall give again , go where you will . Without recovering yourself the power that you have yielded up , you shall henceforth destroy its like in all whom you approach . Your wisdom has discovered that the memory of sorrow , wrong , and trouble is the lot of all mankind , and that mankind would be the happier , in its other memories , without it . Go ! Be its benefactor ! Freed from such remembrance , from this hour , carry involuntarily the blessing of such freedom with you . Its diffusion is inseparable and inalienable from you . Go ! Be happy in the good you have won , and in the good you do ! ”
10400	10410	10455	10455	He	289	“ Destroy its like in all whom you approach ! ”
10590	10593	10594	10594	he	289	“ Halloa ! ”
10597	10608	10594	10594	he	289	“ Halloa ! This way ! Come to the light ! ”
10658	10663	10664	10664	he	289	“ What is it ? ”
10673	10678	10681	10681	he	289	“ What is it ? ”
10867	10872	10873	10873	he	307	“ I ’ll bite , ”
10876	10882	10873	10873	he	307	“ if you hit me ! ”
10945	10951	10952	10952	he	289	“ Where ’s the woman ? ”
10955	10963	10931	10931	he	289	“ I want to find the woman . ”
10964	10967	10931	10931	he	289	“ Who ? ”
10968	11015	11016	11016	He	307	“ The woman . Her that brought me here , and set me by the large fire . She was so long gone , that I went to look for her , and lost myself . I do n’t want you . I want the woman . ”
11052	11060	11062	11063	the boy	307	“ Come ! you let me go ! ”
11072	11091	11045	11045	Redlaw	24	“ I ’ve done nothing to you . Let me go , will you , to the woman ! ”
11092	11105	11107	11107	Redlaw	24	“ That is not the way . There is a nearer one , ”
11134	11140	11107	11107	Redlaw	24	“ What is your name ? ”
11141	11145	11045	11045	Redlaw	24	“ Got none . ”
11146	11152	11107	11107	Redlaw	24	“ Where do you live ? “
11159	11194	11195	11195	You	24	” The boy shook his hair from his eyes to look at him for a moment , and then , twisting round his legs and wrestling with him , broke again into his repetition of “
11210	11219	11203	11203	I	0	” The Chemist led him to the door . “
11223	11245	11203	11203	I	0	” he said , looking at him still confusedly , but with repugnance and avoidance , growing out of his coldness . “
11253	11280	11246	11246	I	0	” The sharp eyes in the child ’s head , wandering round the room , lighted on the table where the remnants of the dinner were . “
11287	11293	11246	11246	I	0	” he said , covetously . “
11300	11301	11295	11295	she	1206	” “
11321	11357	11295	11295	she	1206	” Finding himself released , he bounded at the table like some small animal of prey , and hugging to his breast bread and meat , and his own rags , all together , said : “
11367	11401	11364	11365	the woman	1206	” As the Chemist , with a new - born dislike to touch him , sternly motioned him to follow , and was going out of the door , he trembled and stopped . “
11419	11438	11439	11439	I	0	” The Phantom ’s words were blowing in the wind , and the wind blew chill upon him . “
11449	11454	11439	11439	I	0	” he murmured faintly . “
11491	11492	11493	11494	The woman	1206	” “
11498	12014	11493	11494	The woman	1206	” inquired the boy . He nodded , and the naked feet had sprung away . He came back with his lamp , locked his door hastily , and sat down in his chair , covering his face like one who was frightened at himself . For now he was , indeed , alone . Alone , alone . CHAPTER II The Gift Diffused A small man sat in a small parlour , partitioned off from a small shop by a small screen , pasted all over with small scraps of newspapers . In company with the small man , was almost any amount of small children you may please to name — at least it seemed so ; they made , in that very limited sphere of action , such an imposing effect , in point of numbers . Of these small fry , two had , by some strong machinery , been got into bed in a corner , where they might have reposed snugly enough in the sleep of innocence , but for a constitutional propensity to keep awake , and also to scuffle in and out of bed . The immediate occasion of these predatory dashes at the waking world , was the construction of an oyster - shell wall in a corner , by two other youths of tender age ; on which fortification the two in bed made harassing descents ( like those accursed Picts and Scots who beleaguer the early historical studies of most young Britons ) , and then withdrew to their own territory . In addition to the stir attendant on these inroads , and the retorts of the invaded , who pursued hotly , and made lunges at the bed - clothes under which the marauders took refuge , another little boy , in another little bed , contributed his mite of confusion to the family stock , by casting his boots upon the waters ; in other words , by launching these and several small objects , inoffensive in themselves , though of a hard substance considered as missiles , at the disturbers of his repose,—who were not slow to return these compliments . Besides which , another little boy — the biggest there , but still little — was tottering to and fro , bent on one side , and considerably affected in his knees by the weight of a large baby , which he was supposed by a fiction that obtains sometimes in sanguine families , to be hushing to sleep . But oh ! the inexhaustible regions of contemplation and watchfulness into which this baby ’s eyes were then only beginning to compose themselves to stare , over his unconscious shoulder ! It was a very Moloch of a baby , on whose insatiate altar the whole existence of this particular young brother was offered up a daily sacrifice . Its personality may be said to have consisted in its never being quiet , in any one place , for five consecutive minutes , and never going to sleep when required . “
12018	12921	12922	12922	You	320	” was as well known in the neighbourhood as the postman or the pot - boy . It roved from door - step to door - step , in the arms of little Johnny Tetterby , and lagged heavily at the rear of troops of juveniles who followed the Tumblers or the Monkey , and came up , all on one side , a little too late for everything that was attractive , from Monday morning until Saturday night . Wherever childhood congregated to play , there was little Moloch making Johnny fag and toil . Wherever Johnny desired to stay , little Moloch became fractious , and would not remain . Whenever Johnny wanted to go out , Moloch was asleep , and must be watched . Whenever Johnny wanted to stay at home , Moloch was awake , and must be taken out . Yet Johnny was verily persuaded that it was a faultless baby , without its peer in the realm of England , and was quite content to catch meek glimpses of things in general from behind its skirts , or over its limp flapping bonnet , and to go staggering about with it like a very little porter with a very large parcel , which was not directed to anybody , and could never be delivered anywhere . The small man who sat in the small parlour , making fruitless attempts to read his newspaper peaceably in the midst of this disturbance , was the father of the family , and the chief of the firm described in the inscription over the little shop front , by the name and title of A. TETTERBY AND CO . , NEWSMEN . Indeed , strictly speaking , he was the only personage answering to that designation , as Co. was a mere poetical abstraction , altogether baseless and impersonal . Tetterby ’s was the corner shop in Jerusalem Buildings . There was a good show of literature in the window , chiefly consisting of picture - newspapers out of date , and serial pirates , and footpads . Walking - sticks , likewise , and marbles , were included in the stock in trade . It had once extended into the light confectionery line ; but it would seem that those elegancies of life were not in demand about Jerusalem Buildings , for nothing connected with that branch of commerce remained in the window , except a sort of small glass lantern containing a languishing mass of bull’s - eyes , which had melted in the summer and congealed in the winter until all hope of ever getting them out , or of eating them without eating the lantern too , was gone for ever . Tetterby ’s had tried its hand at several things . It had once made a feeble little dart at the toy business ; for , in another lantern , there was a heap of minute wax dolls , all sticking together upside down , in the direst confusion , with their feet on one another ’s heads , and a precipitate of broken arms and legs at the bottom . It had made a move in the millinery direction , which a few dry , wiry bonnet - shapes remained in a corner of the window to attest . It had fancied that a living might lie hidden in the tobacco trade , and had stuck up a representation of a native of each of the three integral portions of the British Empire , in the act of consuming that fragrant weed ; with a poetic legend attached , importing that united in one cause they sat and joked , one chewed tobacco , one took snuff , one smoked : but nothing seemed to have come of it — except flies . Time had been when it had put a forlorn trust in imitative jewellery , for in one pane of glass there was a card of cheap seals , and another of pencil - cases , and a mysterious black amulet of inscrutable intention , labelled ninepence . But , to that hour , Jerusalem Buildings had bought none of them . In short , Tetterby ’s had tried so hard to get a livelihood out of Jerusalem Buildings in one way or other , and appeared to have done so indifferently in all , that the best position in the firm was too evidently Co. ’s ; Co. , as a bodiless creation , being untroubled with the vulgar inconveniences of hunger and thirst , being chargeable neither to the poor’s - rates nor the assessed taxes , and having no young family to provide for . Tetterby himself , however , in his little parlour , as already mentioned , having the presence of a young family impressed upon his mind in a manner too clamorous to be disregarded , or to comport with the quiet perusal of a newspaper , laid down his paper , wheeled , in his distraction , a few times round the parlour , like an undecided carrier - pigeon , made an ineffectual rush at one or two flying little figures in bed - gowns that skimmed past him , and then , bearing suddenly down upon the only unoffending member of the family , boxed the ears of little Moloch ’s nurse . “
12926	12931	12922	12922	You	320	” said Mr. Tetterby , “
13024	13039	13056	13056	you	320	” said Mr. Tetterby , heaping this up as a great climax of blessings , “
13062	13089	13056	13056	you	320	” At each interrogation , Mr. Tetterby made a feint of boxing his ears again , but thought better of it , and held his hand . “
13094	13098	13056	13056	you	320	” whimpered Johnny , “
13127	13128	13125	13125	father	1063	” “
13138	13147	13148	13148	I	0	” said Mr. Tetterby , relenting and repenting , “
13201	13205	13183	13183	Johnny	51	” indicating Moloch ; “
13263	13463	13467	13467	herself	341	” Softening more and more , as his own tender feelings and those of his injured son were worked on , Mr. Tetterby concluded by embracing him , and immediately breaking away to catch one of the real delinquents . A reasonably good start occurring , he succeeded , after a short but smart run , and some rather severe cross - country work under and over the bedsteads , and in and out among the intricacies of the chairs , in capturing this infant , whom he condignly punished , and bore to bed . This example had a powerful , and apparently , mesmeric influence on him of the boots , who instantly fell into a deep sleep , though he had been , but a moment before , broad awake , and in the highest possible feather . Nor was it lost upon the two young architects , who retired to bed , in an adjoining closet , with great privacy and speed . The comrade of the Intercepted One also shrinking into his nest with similar discretion , Mr. Tetterby , when he paused for breath , found himself unexpectedly in a scene of peace . “
13469	13479	13467	13467	herself	341	” said Mr. Tetterby , wiping his flushed face , “
13503	13531	13490	13492	my little woman	331	” Mr. Tetterby sought upon his screen for a passage appropriate to be impressed upon his children ’s minds on the occasion , and read the following . “
13570	13575	13562	13565	your own remarkable mother	347	” said Mr. Tetterby , “
13587	13611	13613	13613	anybody	1252	” He sat down again in his chair by the fire , and composed himself , cross - legged , over his newspaper . “
13629	13647	13613	13613	anybody	1252	” said Tetterby , as a general proclamation , delivered in a very soft - hearted manner , “
13657	13666	13667	13667	Johnny	51	contemporary!”—which expression Mr. Tetterby selected from his screen . “
13695	13714	13682	13682	she	58	” Johnny sat down on a little stool , and devotedly crushed himself beneath the weight of Moloch . “
13728	13733	13726	13726	Johnny	51	” said his father , “
13752	13762	13749	13749	Johnny	51	” he was now referring to the screen again , “
13795	13796	13749	13749	Johnny	51	” “
13806	13810	13811	13811	I	0	” cried Johnny . “
13823	13847	13821	13821	Sally	58	” Mr. Tetterby desisting , Johnny , with a profound sense of his trust , wiped his eyes , and hushed his sister . “
13853	13862	13851	13851	Dolphus	57	” said his father , poking the fire , “
13888	13889	13892	13892	mother	359	” “
13901	13905	13906	13906	I	0	” exclaimed Johnny , “
13909	13910	13906	13906	I	0	” “
13915	13922	13911	13911	You	51	” returned his father , listening . “
13934	14221	13911	13911	You	51	” The process of induction , by which Mr. Tetterby had come to the conclusion that his wife was a little woman , was his own secret . She would have made two editions of himself , very easily . Considered as an individual , she was rather remarkable for being robust and portly ; but considered with reference to her husband , her dimensions became magnificent . Nor did they assume a less imposing proportion , when studied with reference to the size of her seven sons , who were but diminutive . In the case of Sally , however , Mrs. Tetterby had asserted herself , at last ; as nobody knew better than the victim Johnny , who weighed and measured that exacting idol every hour in the day . Mrs. Tetterby , who had been marketing , and carried a basket , threw back her bonnet and shawl , and sitting down , fatigued , commanded Johnny to bring his sweet charge to her straightway , for a kiss . Johnny having complied , and gone back to his stool , and again crushed himself , Master Adolphus Tetterby , who had by this time unwound his torso out of a prismatic comforter , apparently interminable , requested the same favour . Johnny having again complied , and again gone back to his stool , and again crushed himself , Mr. Tetterby , struck by a sudden thought , preferred the same claim on his own parental part . The satisfaction of this third desire completely exhausted the sacrifice , who had hardly breath enough left to get back to his stool , crush himself again , and pant at his relations . “
14228	14237	14223	14223	you	362	” said Mrs. Tetterby , shaking her head , “
14253	14254	14256	14257	your brother	324	” “
14259	14263	14256	14257	your brother	324	” said Adolphus . “
14270	14321	14268	14268	Johnny	51	” added Mr. Tetterby . Johnny , much affected by this conditional renunciation of him , looked down at Moloch ’s eyes to see that they were all right , so far , and skilfully patted her back ( which was uppermost ) , and rocked her with his foot . “
14332	14337	14327	14327	Dolphus	57	” said his father . “
14348	14349	14327	14327	Dolphus	57	” “
14356	14367	14352	14352	father	1063	” said Adolphus , smoothing himself down with his hands . “
14386	14387	14384	14384	father	1063	” “
14400	14405	14384	14384	father	1063	” returned Mr. Tetterby . “
14413	14428	14411	14411	father	1063	” said Adolphus , polishing his cheeks on the worn sleeve of his jacket . “
14470	14624	14739	14744	Morn - ing Pop - per	373	” Master Adolphus was also in the newspaper line of life , being employed , by a more thriving firm than his father and Co. , to vend newspapers at a railway station , where his chubby little person , like a shabbily - disguised Cupid , and his shrill little voice ( he was not much more than ten years old ) , were as well known as the hoarse panting of the locomotives , running in and out . His juvenility might have been at some loss for a harmless outlet , in this early application to traffic , but for a fortunate discovery he made of a means of entertaining himself , and of dividing the long day into stages of interest , without neglecting business . This ingenious invention , remarkable , like many great discoveries , for its simplicity , consisted in varying the first vowel in the word “
14627	14687	14739	14744	Morn - ing Pop - per	373	” and substituting , in its stead , at different periods of the day , all the other vowels in grammatical succession . Thus , before daylight in the winter - time , he went to and fro , in his little oilskin cap and cape , and his big comforter , piercing the heavy air with his cry of “
14695	14706	14739	14744	Morn - ing Pop - per	373	” which , about an hour before noon , changed to “
14712	14721	14710	14710	Pepper	59	” which , at about two , changed to “
14729	14738	14722	14727	Morn - ing Pip - per	372	” which in a couple of hours changed to “
14746	14754	14739	14744	Morn - ing Pop - per	373	” and so declined with the sun into “
14762	14835	14758	14760	Pup - per	60	” to the great relief and comfort of this young gentleman ’s spirits . Mrs. Tetterby , his lady - mother , who had been sitting with her bonnet and shawl thrown back , as aforesaid , thoughtfully turning her wedding - ring round and round upon her finger , now rose , and divesting herself of her out - of - door attire , began to lay the cloth for supper . “
14847	14852	14758	14760	Pup - per	60	” said Mrs. Tetterby . “
14861	14862	14758	14760	Pup - per	60	” “
14874	14882	14758	14760	Pup - per	60	” asked Mr. Tetterby , looking round . “
14887	14991	14758	14760	Pup - per	60	” said Mrs. Tetterby . Mr. Tetterby elevated his eyebrows , folded his newspaper afresh , and carried his eyes up it , and down it , and across it , but was wandering in his attention , and not reading it . Mrs. Tetterby , at the same time , laid the cloth , but rather as if she were punishing the table than preparing the family supper ; hitting it unnecessarily hard with the knives and forks , slapping it with the plates , dinting it with the salt - cellar , and coming heavily down upon it with the loaf . “
15003	15008	14758	14760	Pup - per	60	” said Mrs. Tetterby . “
15017	15018	14758	14760	Pup - per	60	” “
15022	15031	15032	15032	you	0	” returned her husband , looking round again , “
15045	15046	15032	15032	you	0	” “
15051	15056	15057	15057	Sophia	61	” said Mrs. Tetterby . “
15059	15064	15065	15065	you	0	” remonstrated her husband , “
15074	15075	15065	15065	you	0	” “
15087	15092	15078	15078	I	0	” returned Mrs. Tetterby . “
15121	15143	15144	15144	My	0	” Mr. Tetterby brought his eye to bear upon the partner of his bosom , and said , in mild astonishment : “
15154	15155	15156	15156	I	0	” “
15166	15170	15160	15160	I	0	” she retorted . “
15191	15246	15186	15186	I	0	” Mr. Tetterby gave up the perusal of his newspaper as a bad job , and , taking a slow walk across the room , with his hands behind him , and his shoulders raised — his gait according perfectly with the resignation of his manner — addressed himself to his two eldest offspring . “
15259	15264	15257	15257	Dolphus	57	” said Mr. Tetterby . “
15328	15427	15442	15442	Dolphus	57	” Mrs. Tetterby , without any remark , but with a decided subsidence of her animosity towards the table , finished her preparations , and took , from her ample basket , a substantial slab of hot pease pudding wrapped in paper , and a basin covered with a saucer , which , on being uncovered , sent forth an odour so agreeable , that the three pair of eyes in the two beds opened wide and fixed themselves upon the banquet . Mr. Tetterby , without regarding this tacit invitation to be seated , stood repeating slowly , “
15471	15495	15442	15442	Dolphus	57	do”—until Mrs. Tetterby , who had been exhibiting sundry tokens of contrition behind him , caught him round the neck , and wept . “
15500	15505	15442	15442	Dolphus	57	” said Mrs. Tetterby , “
15514	15584	15590	15590	Dolphus	57	” This reconciliation affected Adolphus the younger and Johnny to that degree , that they both , as with one accord , raised a dismal cry , which had the effect of immediately shutting up the round eyes in the beds , and utterly routing the two remaining little Tetterbys , just then stealing in from the adjoining closet to see what was going on in the eating way . “
15592	15597	15590	15590	Dolphus	57	” sobbed Mrs. Tetterby , “
15611	15625	15601	15601	I	0	” Mr. Tetterby seemed to dislike this figure of speech , and observed , “
15634	15635	15628	15629	the baby	396	” “
15645	15648	15642	15643	the baby	396	” said Mrs. Tetterby.—“Johnny
15712	15731	15710	15710	Dolphus	57	” Mrs. Tetterby paused , and again turned her wedding - ring round and round upon her finger . “
15735	15740	15710	15710	Dolphus	57	” said Mr. Tetterby . “
15784	15796	15779	15779	Dolf	63	” continued Mr. Tetterby , exploring the basin with a fork , “
15858	16204	16205	16205	My	0	” Master Adolphus , needing no second summons , received his portion with eyes rendered moist by appetite , and withdrawing to his particular stool , fell upon his supper tooth and nail . Johnny was not forgotten , but received his rations on bread , lest he should , in a flush of gravy , trickle any on the baby . He was required , for similar reasons , to keep his pudding , when not on active service , in his pocket . There might have been more pork on the knucklebone,—which knucklebone the carver at the cook ’s shop had assuredly not forgotten in carving for previous customers — but there was no stint of seasoning , and that is an accessory dreamily suggesting pork , and pleasantly cheating the sense of taste . The pease pudding , too , the gravy and mustard , like the Eastern rose in respect of the nightingale , if they were not absolutely pork , had lived near it ; so , upon the whole , there was the flavour of a middle - sized pig . It was irresistible to the Tetterbys in bed , who , though professing to slumber peacefully , crawled out when unseen by their parents , and silently appealed to their brothers for any gastronomic token of fraternal affection . They , not hard of heart , presenting scraps in return , it resulted that a party of light skirmishers in nightgowns were careering about the parlour all through supper , which harassed Mr. Tetterby exceedingly , and once or twice imposed upon him the necessity of a charge , before which these guerilla troops retired in all directions and in great confusion . Mrs. Tetterby did not enjoy her supper . There seemed to be something on Mrs. Tetterby ’s mind . At one time she laughed without reason , and at another time she cried without reason , and at last she laughed and cried together in a manner so very unreasonable that her husband was confounded . “
16209	16214	16205	16205	My	0	” said Mr. Tetterby , “
16235	16236	16205	16205	My	0	” “
16244	16253	16205	16205	My	0	” said Mrs. Tetterby , struggling with herself , “
16276	16414	16415	16415	My	0	” Mr. Tetterby having administered the water , turned suddenly on the unlucky Johnny ( who was full of sympathy ) , and demanded why he was wallowing there , in gluttony and idleness , instead of coming forward with the baby , that the sight of her might revive his mother . Johnny immediately approached , borne down by its weight ; but Mrs. Tetterby holding out her hand to signify that she was not in a condition to bear that trying appeal to her feelings , he was interdicted from advancing another inch , on pain of perpetual hatred from all his dearest connections ; and accordingly retired to his stool again , and crushed himself as before . After a pause , Mrs. Tetterby said she was better now , and began to laugh . “
16419	16426	16415	16415	My	0	” said her husband , dubiously , “
16450	16451	16455	16455	Dolphus	57	” “
16459	16464	16455	16455	Dolphus	57	” replied his wife . “
16470	16493	16468	16468	myself	0	” With that , settling her hair , and pressing the palms of her hands upon her eyes , she laughed again . “
16508	16513	16518	16518	Dolphus	57	” said Mrs. Tetterby . “
16542	16565	16535	16535	me	0	” Mr. Tetterby bringing his chair closer , Mrs. Tetterby laughed again , gave him a hug , and wiped her eyes . “
16574	16579	16569	16569	Dolphus	57	” said Mrs. Tetterby , “
16614	16615	16612	16612	Mars	65	” “
16627	16632	16618	16622	all sons of Ma ’s	416	” said Mr. Tetterby , “
16638	16639	16640	16640	I	0	” “
16646	16651	16640	16640	I	0	” replied his wife , “
16658	16659	16640	16640	I	0	” “
16662	16667	16640	16640	I	0	” said Mr. Tetterby . “
16716	16717	16708	16708	I	0	” “
16726	16731	16794	16794	Dolphus	57	” said Mr. Tetterby . “
16740	16788	16794	16794	Dolphus	57	” If Mr. Tetterby had been ten feet high , he could not have expressed a gentler consideration for Mrs. Tetterby ’s fairy - like stature ; and if Mrs. Tetterby had been two feet high , she could not have felt it more appropriately her due . “
16796	16801	16794	16794	Dolphus	57	” said Mrs. Tetterby , “
16941	16942	16939	16939	Dolphus	57	” “
16946	16951	16939	16939	Dolphus	57	” said Mr. Tetterby , “
16955	16956	16939	16939	Dolphus	57	” “
16967	16974	16959	16959	I	0	” pursued his wife , penitently , “
17039	17060	17035	17035	I	0	” the wedding - ring went round again , and Mrs. Tetterby shook her downcast head as she turned it . “
17064	17070	17035	17035	I	0	” said her husband quietly ; “
17087	17088	17111	17111	Dolphus	57	” “
17091	17096	17111	17111	Dolphus	57	” sobbed Mrs. Tetterby . “
17113	17114	17111	17111	Dolphus	57	” “
17118	17123	17111	17111	Dolphus	57	” said Mr. Tetterby . “
17135	17148	17129	17129	I	0	” Mrs. Tetterby gave him a thankful kiss , and went on . “
17274	17275	17326	17326	Dolf	63	” “
17283	17293	17326	17326	Dolf	63	” said Mr. Tetterby , shaking her hand encouragingly , “
17320	17321	17328	17328	Dolf	63	” “
17330	17342	17328	17328	Dolf	63	” cried his wife , laying her hands upon his neck , “
17568	17653	17555	17555	Dolphus	57	” The good woman , quite carried away by her honest tenderness and remorse , was weeping with all her heart , when she started up with a scream , and ran behind her husband . Her cry was so terrified , that the children started from their sleep and from their beds , and clung about her . Nor did her gaze belie her voice , as she pointed to a pale man in a black cloak who had come into the room . “
17667	17668	17669	17669	My	0	” “
17672	17677	17669	17669	My	0	” returned her husband , “
17698	17699	17702	17702	him	1162	” “
17730	17731	17714	17714	He	1162	” “
17738	17739	17740	17740	I	0	” “
17752	17802	17750	17750	husband	444	” for he was going towards the stranger . She had one hand pressed upon her forehead , and one upon her breast ; and there was a peculiar fluttering all over her , and a hurried unsteady motion of her eyes , as if she had lost something . “
17810	17811	17804	17804	you	444	” “
17822	17831	17804	17804	you	444	” she muttered , in a low voice . “
17842	17848	17804	17804	you	444	” Then she abruptly answered : “
17858	17923	17853	17853	I	0	” and stood looking vacantly at the floor . Her husband , who had not been altogether free from the infection of her fear at first , and whom the present strangeness of her manner did not tend to reassure , addressed himself to the pale visitor in the black cloak , who stood still , and whose eyes were bent upon the ground . “
17932	17936	17927	17927	your	444	” he asked , “
17940	17941	17942	17942	I	0	” “
17950	17955	17945	17945	my	0	” returned the visitor , “
17970	17971	17961	17961	you	976	” “
17984	17989	17980	17980	her	331	” returned Mr. Tetterby , “
18005	18006	18007	18007	I	0	” “
18038	18078	18030	18030	I	0	” As he raised his eyes in speaking , she raised hers . It was extraordinary to see what dread she had of him , and with what dread he observed it — and yet how narrowly and closely . “
18082	18086	18088	18088	Redlaw	24	” he said , “
18117	18118	18114	18114	he	451	” “
18122	18126	18119	18120	Mr. Denham	67	” said Tetterby . “
18129	18207	18119	18120	Mr. Denham	67	” It was a natural action , and so slight as to be hardly noticeable ; but the little man , before speaking again , passed his hand across his forehead , and looked quickly round the room , as though he were sensible of some change in its atmosphere . The Chemist , instantly transferring to him the look of dread he had directed towards the wife , stepped back , and his face turned paler . “
18213	18217	18208	18209	The gentleman	454	” said Tetterby , “
18257	18266	18250	18250	you	976	” showing one communicating directly with the parlour , “
18282	18283	18286	18286	I	0	” “
18292	18297	18286	18286	I	0	” said the Chemist . “
18304	18357	18358	18358	I	0	” The watchfulness of his haggard look , and the inexplicable distrust that darkened it , seemed to trouble Mr. Tetterby . He paused ; and looking fixedly at him in return , stood for a minute or so , like a man stupefied , or fascinated . At length he said , “
18371	18372	18358	18358	I	0	” “
18375	18380	18358	18358	I	0	” replied the Chemist , “
18426	18584	18394	18394	He	454	” In the quickness of his expression of this desire , and in taking the candle from the newsman , he touched him on the breast . Withdrawing his hand hastily , almost as though he had wounded him by accident ( for he did not know in what part of himself his new power resided , or how it was communicated , or how the manner of its reception varied in different persons ) , he turned and ascended the stair . But when he reached the top , he stopped and looked down . The wife was standing in the same place , twisting her ring round and round upon her finger . The husband , with his head bent forward on his breast , was musing heavily and sullenly . The children , still clustering about the mother , gazed timidly after the visitor , and nestled together when they saw him looking down . “
18587	18594	18394	18394	He	454	” said the father , roughly . “
18606	18607	18394	18394	He	454	” “
18616	18621	18623	18623	you	461	” the mother added , “
18629	18755	18758	18758	I	0	” The whole brood , scared and sad , crept away ; little Johnny and the baby lagging last . The mother , glancing contemptuously round the sordid room , and tossing from her the fragments of their meal , stopped on the threshold of her task of clearing the table , and sat down , pondering idly and dejectedly . The father betook himself to the chimney - corner , and impatiently raking the small fire together , bent over it as if he would monopolise it all . They did not interchange a word . The Chemist , paler than before , stole upward like a thief ; looking back upon the change below , and dreading equally to go on or return . “
18761	18767	18758	18758	I	0	” he said , confusedly . “
18775	18776	18758	18758	I	0	” “
18784	18831	18758	18758	I	0	” he thought he heard a voice reply . He looked round , but there was nothing there ; and a passage now shutting out the little parlour from his view , he went on , directing his eyes before him at the way he went . “
18839	18844	18758	18758	I	0	” he muttered gloomily , “
18902	18930	18896	18896	My	0	” There was a door before him , and he knocked at it . Being invited , by a voice within , to enter , he complied . “
18937	18942	18896	18896	My	0	” said the voice . “
18959	19064	19065	19065	They	468	” It spoke cheerfully , though in a languid tone , and attracted his attention to a young man lying on a couch , drawn before the chimney - piece , with the back towards the door . A meagre scanty stove , pinched and hollowed like a sick man ’s cheeks , and bricked into the centre of a hearth that it could scarcely warm , contained the fire , to which his face was turned . Being so near the windy house - top , it wasted quickly , and with a busy sound , and the burning ashes dropped down fast . “
19073	19080	19065	19065	They	468	” said the student , smiling , “
19136	19399	19400	19401	Mr. Redlaw	24	” He put up his hand as if expecting her to take it , but , being weakened , he lay still , with his face resting on his other hand , and did not turn round . The Chemist glanced about the room;—at the student ’s books and papers , piled upon a table in a corner , where they , and his extinguished reading - lamp , now prohibited and put away , told of the attentive hours that had gone before this illness , and perhaps caused it;—at such signs of his old health and freedom , as the out - of - door attire that hung idle on the wall;—at those remembrances of other and less solitary scenes , the little miniatures upon the chimney - piece , and the drawing of home;—at that token of his emulation , perhaps , in some sort , of his personal attachment too , the framed engraving of himself , the looker - on . The time had been , only yesterday , when not one of these objects , in its remotest association of interest with the living figure before him , would have been lost on Redlaw . Now , they were but objects ; or , if any gleam of such connexion shot upon him , it perplexed , and not enlightened him , as he stood looking round with a dull wonder . The student , recalling the thin hand which had remained so long untouched , raised himself on the couch , and turned his head . “
19403	19417	19400	19401	Mr. Redlaw	24	” he exclaimed , and started up . Redlaw put out his arm . “
19437	19473	19474	19474	I	0	” He sat down on a chair near the door , and having glanced at the young man standing leaning with his hand upon the couch , spoke with his eyes averted towards the ground . “
19529	19530	19527	19527	him	473	” “
19538	19559	19527	19527	him	473	” returned the student , not merely with a modest hesitation , but with a kind of awe of him , “
19613	19614	19615	19615	You	0	” “
19624	19628	19615	19615	You	0	” said Redlaw . “
19631	19730	19615	19615	You	0	” The student bent his head , as if he rendered her some silent homage . The Chemist , in whom there was a cold , monotonous apathy , which rendered him more like a marble image on the tomb of the man who had started from his dinner yesterday at the first mention of this student ’s case , than the breathing man himself , glanced again at the student leaning with his hand upon the couch , and looked upon the ground , and in the air , as if for light for his blinded mind . “
19736	19740	19731	19731	I	0	” he said , “
19769	19770	19759	19759	We	481	” “
19774	19775	19776	19776	You	0	” “
19794	19800	19776	19776	You	0	” The student signified assent . “
19804	19827	19776	19776	You	0	” said the Chemist ; not with the least expression of interest , but with a moody , wayward kind of curiosity . “
19875	19911	19867	19867	I	0	” The young man , who had heard him with increasing agitation , raised his downcast eyes to his face , and clasping his hands together , cried with sudden earnestness and with trembling lips : “
19925	19926	19920	19920	You	0	” “
19929	19936	19937	19937	I	0	” said the Chemist , harshly . “
19940	19941	19937	19937	I	0	” “
19980	19985	19977	19977	your	0	” replied the student , “
20029	20041	20044	20045	Mr. Redlaw	24	” A vacant and contemptuous laugh , was all his answer . “
20047	20052	20044	20045	Mr. Redlaw	24	” said the student , “
20091	20092	20044	20045	Mr. Redlaw	24	” “
20095	20101	20044	20045	Mr. Redlaw	24	” said Redlaw , laughing . “
20110	20111	20044	20045	Mr. Redlaw	24	” “
20117	20123	20044	20045	Mr. Redlaw	24	” entreated the shrinking student , “
20185	20186	20187	20187	Longford	69	” “
20189	20241	20187	20187	Longford	69	” exclaimed the other . He clasped his head with both his hands , and for a moment turned upon the young man his own intelligent and thoughtful face . But the light passed from it , like the sun - beam of an instant , and it clouded as before . “
20250	20256	20244	20245	my mother	1057	” faltered the young man , “
20277	20280	20274	20275	Mr. Redlaw	24	” hesitating , “
20413	20436	20437	20437	I	0	” Redlaw , unmoved , unchanged , and looking at him with a staring frown , answered by no word or sign . “
20442	20447	20437	20437	I	0	” pursued the other , “
20646	20653	20643	20644	Mr. Redlaw	24	” said the student , faintly , “
20696	20740	20643	20644	Mr. Redlaw	24	” The staring frown remained on Redlaw ’s face , and yielded to no other expression until the student , with these words , advanced towards him , as if to touch his hand , when he drew back and cried to him : “
20748	20782	20643	20644	Mr. Redlaw	24	” The young man stopped , shocked by the eagerness of his recoil , and by the sternness of his repulsion ; and he passed his hand , thoughtfully , across his forehead . “
20788	20793	20794	20794	It	497	” said the Chemist . “
20859	20873	20811	20811	He	499	” he muttered , holding his head again , with both his hands . “
20885	20918	20811	20811	He	499	” He had tossed his purse upon the table . As he fell into this dim cogitation with himself , the student took it up , and held it out to him . “
20925	20934	20937	20937	you	976	” he said proudly , though not angrily . “
20954	20955	20956	20956	You	976	” “
20959	20971	20972	20972	You	976	” he retorted , with a wild light in his eyes . “
20975	20976	20977	20977	I	0	” “
20980	21012	20977	20977	I	0	” The Chemist went close to him , for the first time , and took the purse , and turned him by the arm , and looked him in the face . “
21025	21038	20977	20977	I	0	” he demanded , with a laugh . The wondering student answered , “
21041	21042	20977	20977	I	0	” “
21065	21076	21082	21082	they	503	” said the Chemist , with a wild unearthly exultation . “
21085	21120	21121	21121	I	0	” The student did not answer , but again passed his hand , confusedly , across his forehead . Redlaw still held him by the sleeve , when Milly ’s voice was heard outside . “
21128	21132	21121	21121	I	0	” she said , “
21171	21181	21163	21166	A gentleman with him	507	” Redlaw released his hold , as he listened . “
21191	21197	21210	21210	her	508	” he murmured to himself , “
21233	21241	21218	21218	I	0	” She was knocking at the door . “
21256	21272	21243	21243	I	0	” he muttered , looking uneasily around . She was knocking at the door again . “
21282	21297	21243	21243	I	0	” he said , in a hoarse alarmed voice , turning to his companion , “
21312	21370	21310	21310	me	0	” The student opened a frail door in the wall , communicating where the garret - roof began to slope towards the floor , with a small inner room . Redlaw passed in hastily , and shut it after him . The student then resumed his place upon the couch , and called to her to enter . “
21375	21382	21383	21383	they	512	” said Milly , looking round , “
21392	21393	21383	21383	they	512	” “
21401	21402	21400	21400	I.	0	” “
21409	21410	21406	21407	some one	1056	” “
21421	21481	21406	21407	some one	1056	” She put her little basket on the table , and went up to the back of the couch , as if to take the extended hand — but it was not there . A little surprised , in her quiet way , she leaned over to look at his face , and gently touched him on the brow . “
21502	21503	21491	21491	Your	71	” “
21506	21513	21491	21491	Your	71	” said the student , petulantly , “
21519	21656	21491	21491	Your	71	” A little more surprise , but no reproach , was expressed in her face , as she withdrew to the other side of the table , and took a small packet of needlework from her basket . But she laid it down again , on second thoughts , and going noiselessly about the room , set everything exactly in its place , and in the neatest order ; even to the cushions on the couch , which she touched with so light a hand , that he hardly seemed to know it , as he lay looking at the fire . When all this was done , and she had swept the hearth , she sat down , in her modest little bonnet , to her work , and was quietly busy on it directly . “
21670	21680	21667	21668	Mr. Edmund	71	” said Milly , stitching away as she talked . “
21735	21767	21707	21708	My William	517	” He said nothing ; but there was something so fretful and impatient in his change of position , that her quick fingers stopped , and she looked at him anxiously . “
21774	21785	21707	21708	My William	517	” she said , laying down her work and rising . “
21793	21794	21786	21786	I	0	” “
21800	21804	21786	21786	I	0	” he answered . “
21818	21878	21811	21811	You	71	” He raised his head to say this , and looked at her so thanklessly , that , after he had thrown himself down again , she stood timidly pausing . However , she resumed her seat , and her needle , without having directed even a murmuring look towards him , and was soon as busy as before . “
21998	22054	22097	22098	Mr. Edmund	71	” She was too intent upon her work , and too earnest in what she said , and too composed and quiet altogether , to be on the watch for any look he might direct towards her in reply ; so the shaft of his ungrateful glance fell harmless , and did not wound her . “
22057	22084	22097	22098	Mr. Edmund	71	” said Milly , with her pretty head inclining thoughtfully on one side , as she looked down , following her busy fingers with her eyes . “
22205	22225	22226	22226	We	523	” His getting up from the couch , interrupted her , or she was going on to say more . “
22236	22241	22233	22234	Mrs. William	23	” he rejoined slightingly . “
22283	22294	22295	22295	I	0	” Her fingers stopped , and she looked at him . “
22311	22315	22306	22306	your	23	” he said . “
22343	22372	22373	22373	I	0	” Her work fell on her lap , as she still looked at him walking to and fro with an intolerant air , and stopping now and then . “
22424	22425	22427	22427	you	23	” “
22433	22444	22427	22427	you	23	” she asked , rising and going nearer to him , “
22465	22481	22446	22446	I	0	” laying her hand upon her bosom with a simple and innocent smile of astonishment . “
22494	22498	22484	22484	I	0	” he returned . “
22538	22580	22532	22532	we	529	” He coldly took a book , and sat down at the table . She watched him for a little while , until her smile was quite gone , and then , returning to where her basket was , said gently : “
22590	22591	22581	22582	Mr. Edmund	71	” “
22603	22607	22597	22597	I	0	” he replied . “
22610	22621	22597	22597	I	0	” said Milly , hesitating , and showing her work . “
22627	22636	22597	22597	I	0	” he answered , with a supercilious laugh . “
22644	22685	22597	22597	I	0	” She made up the little packet again , and put it in her basket . Then , standing before him with such an air of patient entreaty that he could not choose but look at her , she said : “
22844	22937	22839	22839	I	0	” If she had been as passionate as she was quiet , as indignant as she was calm , as angry in her look as she was gentle , as loud of tone as she was low and clear , she might have left no sense of her departure in the room , compared with that which fell upon the lonely student when she went away . He was gazing drearily upon the place where she had been , when Redlaw came out of his concealment , and came to the door . “
22947	22957	22839	22839	I	0	” he said , looking fiercely back at him , “
22968	22969	22972	22972	you	23	” “
22975	22985	22972	22972	you	23	” returned the other , catching at his cloak . “
23008	23009	23013	23013	myself	0	” “
23015	23022	23013	23013	myself	0	” exclaimed Redlaw like a madman . “
23100	23190	23098	23098	them	533	” As he spoke — the young man still holding to his cloak — he cast him off , and struck him : then , wildly hurried out into the night air where the wind was blowing , the snow falling , the cloud - drift sweeping on , the moon dimly shining ; and where , blowing in the wind , falling with the snow , drifting with the clouds , shining in the moonlight , and heavily looming in the darkness , were the Phantom ’s words , “
23208	23290	23098	23098	them	533	” Whither he went , he neither knew nor cared , so that he avoided company . The change he felt within him made the busy streets a desert , and himself a desert , and the multitude around him , in their manifold endurances and ways of life , a mighty waste of sand , which the winds tossed into unintelligible heaps and made a ruinous confusion of . Those traces in his breast which the Phantom had told him would “
23295	23778	23098	23098	them	533	” were not , as yet , so far upon their way to death , but that he understood enough of what he was , and what he made of others , to desire to be alone . This put it in his mind — he suddenly bethought himself , as he was going along , of the boy who had rushed into his room . And then he recollected , that of those with whom he had communicated since the Phantom ’s disappearance , that boy alone had shown no sign of being changed . Monstrous and odious as the wild thing was to him , he determined to seek it out , and prove if this were really so ; and also to seek it with another intention , which came into his thoughts at the same time . So , resolving with some difficulty where he was , he directed his steps back to the old college , and to that part of it where the general porch was , and where , alone , the pavement was worn by the tread of the students ’ feet . The keeper ’s house stood just within the iron gates , forming a part of the chief quadrangle . There was a little cloister outside , and from that sheltered place he knew he could look in at the window of their ordinary room , and see who was within . The iron gates were shut , but his hand was familiar with the fastening , and drawing it back by thrusting in his wrist between the bars , he passed through softly , shut it again , and crept up to the window , crumbling the thin crust of snow with his feet . The fire , to which he had directed the boy last night , shining brightly through the glass , made an illuminated place upon the ground . Instinctively avoiding this , and going round it , he looked in at the window . At first , he thought that there was no one there , and that the blaze was reddening only the old beams in the ceiling and the dark walls ; but peering in more narrowly , he saw the object of his search coiled asleep before it on the floor . He passed quickly to the door , opened it , and went in . The creature lay in such a fiery heat , that , as the Chemist stooped to rouse him , it scorched his head . So soon as he was touched , the boy , not half awake , clutching his rags together with the instinct of flight upon him , half rolled and half ran into a distant corner of the room , where , heaped upon the ground , he struck his foot out to defend himself . “
23782	23787	23788	23788	You	535	” said the Chemist . “
23794	23795	23796	23796	You	0	” “
23801	23806	23796	23796	You	0	” returned the boy . “
23817	23844	23809	23810	the woman	1206	” The Chemist ’s steady eye controlled him somewhat , or inspired him with enough submission to be raised upon his feet , and looked at . “
23860	23871	23872	23873	The woman	1206	” asked the Chemist , pointing to their altered state . “
23876	23877	23872	23873	The woman	1206	” “
23893	23894	23897	23898	the woman	1206	” “
23900	23976	23897	23898	the woman	1206	” Redlaw asked these questions to attract his eyes towards himself , and with the same intent now held him by the chin , and threw his wild hair back , though he loathed to touch him . The boy watched his eyes keenly , as if he thought it needful to his own defence , not knowing what he might do next ; and Redlaw could see well that no change came over him . “
23981	23985	23986	23987	The woman	1206	” he inquired . “
23991	23992	23995	23995	she	1206	” “
24012	24013	24014	24015	The woman	1206	” “
24022	24027	24019	24019	d’ye	547	” inquired the boy . “
24035	24036	24032	24033	those two	548	” “
24061	24062	24046	24046	They	548	” “
24067	24072	24065	24065	me	0	” said the Chemist , “
24080	24081	24074	24074	I	0	” “
24092	24093	24089	24089	you	0	” “
24122	24123	24112	24112	you	544	” “
24129	24141	24124	24124	You	0	” returned the boy , suddenly twisting out of his grasp . “
24165	24274	24157	24157	I	0	” He was down before it , and ready , with his savage little hand , to pluck the burning coals out . What the Chemist had felt , in observing the effect of his charmed influence stealing over those with whom he came in contact , was not nearly equal to the cold vague terror with which he saw this baby - monster put it at defiance . It chilled his blood to look on the immovable impenetrable thing , in the likeness of a child , with its sharp malignant face turned up to his , and its almost infant hand , ready at the bars . “
24279	24283	24277	24277	boy	1010	” he said . “
24344	24359	24361	24361	you	1010	” He made a hasty step towards the door , afraid of her returning . “
24378	24398	24361	24361	you	1010	” said the boy , slowly withdrawing the hand with which he threatened , and beginning to get up . “
24402	24403	24399	24399	I	0	” “
24418	24419	24420	24420	I	0	” “
24423	24424	24420	24420	I	0	” “
24436	24466	24420	24420	I	0	” The Chemist laid a few shillings , one by one , in his extended hand . To count them was beyond the boy ’s knowledge , but he said “
24469	25114	24420	24420	I	0	” every time , and avariciously looked at each as it was given , and at the donor . He had nowhere to put them , out of his hand , but in his mouth ; and he put them there . Redlaw then wrote with his pencil on a leaf of his pocket - book , that the boy was with him ; and laying it on the table , signed to him to follow . Keeping his rags together , as usual , the boy complied , and went out with his bare head and naked feet into the winter night . Preferring not to depart by the iron gate by which he had entered , where they were in danger of meeting her whom he so anxiously avoided , the Chemist led the way , through some of those passages among which the boy had lost himself , and by that portion of the building where he lived , to a small door of which he had the key . When they got into the street , he stopped to ask his guide — who instantly retreated from him — if he knew where they were . The savage thing looked here and there , and at length , nodding his head , pointed in the direction he designed to take . Redlaw going on at once , he followed , something less suspiciously ; shifting his money from his mouth into his hand , and back again into his mouth , and stealthily rubbing it bright upon his shreds of dress , as he went along . Three times , in their progress , they were side by side . Three times they stopped , being side by side . Three times the Chemist glanced down at his face , and shuddered as it forced upon him one reflection . The first occasion was when they were crossing an old churchyard , and Redlaw stopped among the graves , utterly at a loss how to connect them with any tender , softening , or consolatory thought . The second was , when the breaking forth of the moon induced him to look up at the Heavens , where he saw her in her glory , surrounded by a host of stars he still knew by the names and histories which human science has appended to them ; but where he saw nothing else he had been wo nt to see , felt nothing he had been wo nt to feel , in looking up there , on a bright night . The third was when he stopped to listen to a plaintive strain of music , but could only hear a tune , made manifest to him by the dry mechanism of the instruments and his own ears , with no address to any mystery within him , without a whisper in it of the past , or of the future , powerless upon him as the sound of last year ’s running water , or the rushing of last year ’s wind . At each of these three times , he saw with horror that , in spite of the vast intellectual distance between them , and their being unlike each other in all physical respects , the expression on the boy ’s face was the expression on his own . They journeyed on for some time — now through such crowded places , that he often looked over his shoulder thinking he had lost his guide , but generally finding him within his shadow on his other side ; now by ways so quiet , that he could have counted his short , quick , naked footsteps coming on behind — until they arrived at a ruinous collection of houses , and the boy touched him and stopped . “
25118	25144	24420	24420	I	0	” he said , pointing out one house where there were scattered lights in the windows , and a dim lantern in the doorway , with “
25148	25307	24420	24420	I	0	” painted on it . Redlaw looked about him ; from the houses to the waste piece of ground on which the houses stood , or rather did not altogether tumble down , unfenced , undrained , unlighted , and bordered by a sluggish ditch ; from that , to the sloping line of arches , part of some neighbouring viaduct or bridge with which it was surrounded , and which lessened gradually towards them , until the last but one was a mere kennel for a dog , the last a plundered little heap of bricks ; from that , to the child , close to him , cowering and trembling with the cold , and limping on one little foot , while he coiled the other round his leg to warm it , yet staring at all these things with that frightful likeness of expression so apparent in his face , that Redlaw started from him . “
25311	25322	24420	24420	I	0	” said the boy , pointing out the house again . “
25327	25328	24420	24420	I	0	” “
25335	25339	25330	25330	they	556	” asked Redlaw . “
25346	25353	25341	25341	you	0	” he answered with a nod . “
25360	25432	25343	25344	a doctor	557	” Looking back on his way to the house - door , Redlaw saw him trail himself upon the dust and crawl within the shelter of the smallest arch , as if he were a rat . He had no pity for the thing , but he was afraid of it ; and when it looked out of its den at him , he hurried to the house as a retreat . “
25440	25455	25330	25330	they	556	” said the Chemist , with a painful effort at some more distinct remembrance , “
25477	25607	25610	25610	you	560	” With these words , he pushed the yielding door , and went in . There was a woman sitting on the stairs , either asleep or forlorn , whose head was bent down on her hands and knees . As it was not easy to pass without treading on her , and as she was perfectly regardless of his near approach , he stopped , and touched her on the shoulder . Looking up , she showed him quite a young face , but one whose bloom and promise were all swept away , as if the haggard winter should unnaturally kill the spring . With little or no show of concern on his account , she moved nearer to the wall to leave him a wider passage . “
25612	25628	25610	25610	you	560	” said Redlaw , pausing , with his hand upon the broken stair - rail . “
25636	25736	25631	25631	you	559	” she answered , showing him her face again . He looked upon the ruined Temple of God , so lately made , so soon disfigured ; and something , which was not compassion — for the springs in which a true compassion for such miseries has its rise , were dried up in his breast — but which was nearer to it , for the moment , than any feeling that had lately struggled into the darkening , but not yet wholly darkened , night of his mind — mingled a touch of softness with his next words . “
25749	25753	25631	25631	you	559	” he said . “
25761	25797	25799	25799	you	560	” She frowned at him , and then laughed ; and then her laugh prolonged itself into a shivering sigh , as she dropped her head again , and hid her fingers in her hair . “
25805	25811	25799	25799	you	560	” he asked once more . “
25819	25860	25812	25812	I	0	” she said , with a momentary look at him . He had a perception that she was one of many , and that he saw the type of thousands , when he saw her , drooping at his feet . “
25866	25870	25863	25864	your parents	328	” he demanded . “
25891	25892	25881	25882	a gardener	564	” “
25897	25898	25894	25894	he	993	” “
25922	25934	25913	25913	You	0	” She raised her eyes again , and laughed at him . “
25937	25943	25935	25935	Girl	1011	” said Redlaw , sternly , “
25996	26085	26119	26119	I	0	” So little of what was womanly was left in her appearance , that now , when she burst into tears , he stood amazed . But he was more amazed , and much disquieted , to note that in her awakened recollection of this wrong , the first trace of her old humanity and frozen tenderness appeared to show itself . He drew a little off , and in doing so , observed that her arms were black , her face cut , and her bosom bruised . “
26094	26098	26099	26099	My	0	” he asked . “
26107	26112	26105	26105	myself	0	” she answered quickly . “
26117	26118	26119	26119	I	0	” “
26160	26205	26152	26152	He	568	” In the white determination of her face , confronting him with this untruth , he saw enough of the last perversion and distortion of good surviving in that miserable breast , to be stricken with remorse that he had ever come near her . “
26213	26223	26152	26152	He	568	” he muttered , turning his fearful gaze away . “
26252	26422	26423	26424	Mr. Redlaw	24	” Afraid to look at her again , afraid to touch her , afraid to think of having sundered the last thread by which she held upon the mercy of Heaven , he gathered his cloak about him , and glided swiftly up the stairs . Opposite to him , on the landing , was a door , which stood partly open , and which , as he ascended , a man with a candle in his hand , came forward from within to shut . But this man , on seeing him , drew back , with much emotion in his manner , and , as if by a sudden impulse , mentioned his name aloud . In the surprise of such a recognition there , he stopped , endeavouring to recollect the wan and startled face . He had no time to consider it , for , to his yet greater amazement , old Philip came out of the room , and took him by the hand . “
26426	26432	26423	26424	Mr. Redlaw	24	” said the old man , “
26471	26506	26536	26536	I	0	” Redlaw , with a bewildered look , submitted to be led into the room . A man lay there , on a truckle - bed , and William Swidger stood at the bedside . “
26510	26532	26536	26536	I	0	” murmured the old man , looking wistfully into the Chemist ’s face ; and the tears stole down his cheeks . “
26541	26550	26536	26536	I	0	” interposed his son in a low voice . “
26586	26684	26584	26584	father	1063	” Redlaw paused at the bedside , and looked down on the figure that was stretched upon the mattress . It was that of a man , who should have been in the vigour of his life , but on whom it was not likely the sun would ever shine again . The vices of his forty or fifty years ’ career had so branded him , that , in comparison with their effects upon his face , the heavy hand of Time upon the old man ’s face who watched him had been merciful and beautifying . “
26689	26697	26698	26699	My son	1062	” asked the Chemist , looking round . “
26705	26715	26702	26703	Mr. Redlaw	24	” said the old man , wringing his hands . “
26734	26842	26843	26843	William	26	” Redlaw ’s eyes wandered from the old man ’s grey head , as he laid it down upon the bed , to the person who had recognised him , and who had kept aloof , in the remotest corner of the room . He seemed to be about his own age ; and although he knew no such hopeless decay and broken man as he appeared to be , there was something in the turn of his figure , as he stood with his back towards him , and now went out at the door , that made him pass his hand uneasily across his brow . “
26845	26853	26843	26843	William	26	” he said in a gloomy whisper , “
26859	26860	26856	26857	that man	1162	” “
26867	26872	26862	26862	you	26	” returned Mr. William , “
26913	26914	26904	26904	he	1126	” “
26922	26937	26904	26904	he	1126	” asked Redlaw , glancing after him with the same uneasy action as before . “
26944	26949	26951	26951	I	0	” returned William Swidger , “
26982	26994	26974	26976	my unhappy brother	583	” Mr. William passed his coat - sleeve across his eyes , “
27058	27137	27055	27056	my father	993	” Redlaw looked up , at these words , and , recalling where he was and with whom , and the spell he carried with him — which his surprise had obscured — retired a little , hurriedly , debating with himself whether to shun the house that moment , or remain . Yielding to a certain sullen doggedness , which it seemed to be a part of his condition to struggle with , he argued for remaining . “
27143	27147	27055	27056	my father	993	” he said , “
27211	27263	27264	27264	Father	1063	” But he stayed in fear and trembling none the less for these words ; and , shrouded in his black cloak with his face turned from them , stood away from the bedside , listening to what they said , as if he felt himself a demon in the place . “
27266	27278	27264	27264	Father	1063	” murmured the sick man , rallying a little from stupor . “
27286	27291	27292	27292	You	0	” said old Philip . “
27321	27322	27292	27292	You	0	” “
27329	27335	27292	27292	You	0	” returned the old man . “
27357	27358	27301	27301	mother	359	” “
27368	27380	27366	27366	father	1063	” For the old man ’s tears were falling on him . “
27385	27389	27366	27366	father	1063	” said Philip , “
27504	27505	27506	27506	Father	1063	” “
27508	27516	27506	27506	Father	1063	” said the man upon the bed , “
27555	27556	27569	27574	all who are softened and penitent	604	” “
27561	27567	27569	27574	all who are softened and penitent	604	” returned the old man , “
27585	27596	27597	27597	I	0	” he exclaimed , clasping his hands and looking up , “
27639	27655	27632	27632	himself	37	” Redlaw spread his hands upon his face , and shrank , like a murderer . “
27658	27667	27632	27632	himself	37	” feebly moaned the man upon the bed . “
27680	27681	27632	27632	himself	37	” “
27689	27695	27696	27696	He	605	” said the old man . “
27863	27938	27853	27853	he	615	” As the old man lifted up his trembling hands , the son , for whom he made the supplication , laid his sinking head against him for support and comfort , as if he were indeed the child of whom he spoke . When did man ever tremble , as Redlaw trembled , in the silence that ensued ! He knew it must come upon them , knew that it was coming fast . “
27950	27971	27945	27945	my	0	” said the sick man , supporting himself on one arm , and with the other groping in the air , “
28004	28005	28031	28031	myself	0	” “
28014	28020	28031	28031	myself	0	” said his aged father . “
28026	28027	28023	28024	a man	1126	” “
28035	28045	28033	28033	George	36	” interposed his brother , bending kindly over him . “
28051	28052	28048	28049	Mr. Redlaw	24	” “
28067	28095	28055	28055	I	0	” The Chemist , whiter than the dying man , appeared before him . Obedient to the motion of his hand , he sat upon the bed . “
28109	28138	28055	28055	I	0	” said the sick man , laying his hand upon his heart , with a look in which the mute , imploring agony of his condition was concentrated , “
28175	28200	28055	28055	I	0	” Was it the extremity to which he had come , or was it the dawning of another change , that made him stop ? “
28239	28284	28235	28235	you	976	” Redlaw could not reply by any word ; for when he saw that fatal sign he knew so well now , of the wandering hand upon the forehead , his voice died at his lips . But he made some indication of assent . “
28327	28357	28317	28317	he	620	” It was working . It was on his face . His face was changing , hardening , deepening in all its shades , and losing all its sorrow . “
28369	28406	28365	28365	you	976	” he pursued . He shut his face out for a moment , with the hand that again wandered over his forehead , and then it lowered on Redlaw , reckless , ruffianly , and callous . “
28414	28421	28412	28412	you	976	” he said , scowling round , “
28449	28541	28424	28424	you	976	” And so lay down upon his bed , and put his arms up , over his head and ears , as resolute from that time to keep out all access , and to die in his indifference . If Redlaw had been struck by lightning , it could not have struck him from the bedside with a more tremendous shock . But the old man , who had left the bed while his son was speaking to him , now returning , avoided it quickly likewise , and with abhorrence . “
28548	28555	28546	28546	William	26	” said the old man hurriedly . “
28568	28569	28572	28572	father	1063	” “
28574	28578	28572	28572	father	1063	” returned William . “
28588	28589	28580	28580	you	1063	” “
28596	28602	28580	28580	you	1063	” replied the old man . “
28609	28610	28580	28580	you	1063	” “
28618	28626	28613	28616	no son of mine	629	” said Philip , trembling with resentment . “
28680	28681	28674	28674	I	0	” “
28691	28707	28682	28682	You	1063	” muttered William , looking at him grudgingly , with his hands in his pockets . “
28729	28730	28732	28734	My _ son	633	” “
28739	28745	28736	28737	Mr. Redlaw	24	” said the old man . “
28783	28784	28785	28785	I	0	” “
28802	28808	28790	28790	you	1063	” said William , sulkily . “
28813	28819	28810	28810	me	0	” said the old man . “
28873	28874	28871	28871	William	26	” “
28881	28885	28871	28871	William	26	” he muttered . “
28904	28918	28889	28889	I	0	” addressing Redlaw , with an impatience and irritation that were quite new , “
28952	28953	28954	28954	I	0	” “
28961	28974	28954	28954	I	0	” said the old man , rambling on , childishly and weakly , “
29103	29154	29096	29096	I	0	” In his drowsy chuckling , and the shaking of his head , he put his hands into his waistcoat pockets . In one of them he found a bit of holly ( left there , probably last night ) , which he now took out , and looked at . “
29159	29165	29096	29096	I	0	” said the old man . “
29308	29419	29294	29294	I	0	” The drivelling , pitiable manner in which , as he repeated this , he nibbled at the leaves , and spat the morsels out ; the cold , uninterested eye with which his youngest son ( so changed ) regarded him ; the determined apathy with which his eldest son lay hardened in his sin ; impressed themselves no more on Redlaw ’s observation,—for he broke his way from the spot to which his feet seemed to have been fixed , and ran out of the house . His guide came crawling forth from his place of refuge , and was ready for him before he reached the arches . “
29426	29430	29294	29294	I	0	” he inquired . “
29435	29439	29294	29294	I	0	” answered Redlaw . “
29446	29588	29294	29294	I	0	” For a short distance the boy went on before ; but their return was more like a flight than a walk , and it was as much as his bare feet could do , to keep pace with the Chemist ’s rapid strides . Shrinking from all who passed , shrouded in his cloak , and keeping it drawn closely about him , as though there were mortal contagion in any fluttering touch of his garments , he made no pause until they reached the door by which they had come out . He unlocked it with his key , went in , accompanied by the boy , and hastened through the dark passages to his own chamber . The boy watched him as he made the door fast , and withdrew behind the table , when he looked round . “
29591	29595	29294	29294	I	0	” he said . “
29614	29745	29602	29602	You	647	” Redlaw threw some more upon the ground . He flung his body on it immediately , as if to hide it from him , lest the sight of it should tempt him to reclaim it ; and not until he saw him seated by his lamp , with his face hidden in his hands , began furtively to pick it up . When he had done so , he crept near the fire , and , sitting down in a great chair before it , took from his breast some broken scraps of food , and fell to munching , and to staring at the blaze , and now and then to glancing at his shillings , which he kept clenched up in a bunch , in one hand . “
29749	29762	29602	29602	You	647	” said Redlaw , gazing on him with increased repugnance and fear , “
29774	29838	29841	29842	the woman	1206	” How long it was before he was aroused from his contemplation of this creature , whom he dreaded so — whether half - an - hour , or half the night — he knew not . But the stillness of the room was broken by the boy ( whom he had seen listening ) starting up , and running towards the door . “
29845	29864	29841	29842	the woman	1206	” he exclaimed . The Chemist stopped him on his way , at the moment when she knocked . “
29874	29879	29872	29872	you	0	” said the boy . “
29883	29888	29922	29922	sir	976	” returned the Chemist . “
29907	29908	29911	29911	I	0	” “
29915	29919	29911	29911	I	0	” cried Milly . “
29928	29929	29922	29922	sir	976	” “
29937	29941	29942	29943	Mr. Redlaw	24	” he said . “
29956	29957	29950	29950	sir	976	” “
29963	29971	29972	29974	The miserable man	656	” he said , holding the boy . “
30042	30043	30032	30033	Mr. Redlaw	24	” “
30050	30054	30055	30056	Mr. Redlaw	24	” he answered . “
30086	30087	30067	30067	his	36	” “
30099	30100	30101	30101	He	36	” “
30183	30206	30207	30207	Phantoms	73	” All this time he held the boy , who was half - mad to pass him , and let her in . “
30214	30223	30207	30207	Phantoms	73	” cried Redlaw , gazing round in anguish , “
30321	30329	30331	30331	me	0	” There was no response , but her “
30340	30351	30352	30354	Shadow of myself	667	” and the boy ’s struggling to get to her . “
30362	30369	30352	30354	Shadow of myself	667	” cried Redlaw , in distraction , “
30471	30501	30508	30508	He	1555	” The only reply still was , the boy struggling to get to her , while he held him back ; and the cry , increasing in its energy , “
30548	31296	31297	31297	Spectre	48	” CHAPTER III The Gift Reversed Night was still heavy in the sky . On open plains , from hill - tops , and from the decks of solitary ships at sea , a distant low - lying line , that promised by - and - by to change to light , was visible in the dim horizon ; but its promise was remote and doubtful , and the moon was striving with the night - clouds busily . The shadows upon Redlaw ’s mind succeeded thick and fast to one another , and obscured its light as the night - clouds hovered between the moon and earth , and kept the latter veiled in darkness . Fitful and uncertain as the shadows which the night - clouds cast , were their concealments from him , and imperfect revelations to him ; and , like the night - clouds still , if the clear light broke forth for a moment , it was only that they might sweep over it , and make the darkness deeper than before . Without , there was a profound and solemn hush upon the ancient pile of building , and its buttresses and angles made dark shapes of mystery upon the ground , which now seemed to retire into the smooth white snow and now seemed to come out of it , as the moon ’s path was more or less beset . Within , the Chemist ’s room was indistinct and murky , by the light of the expiring lamp ; a ghostly silence had succeeded to the knocking and the voice outside ; nothing was audible but , now and then , a low sound among the whitened ashes of the fire , as of its yielding up its last breath . Before it on the ground the boy lay fast asleep . In his chair , the Chemist sat , as he had sat there since the calling at his door had ceased — like a man turned to stone . At such a time , the Christmas music he had heard before , began to play . He listened to it at first , as he had listened in the church - yard ; but presently — it playing still , and being borne towards him on the night air , in a low , sweet , melancholy strain — he rose , and stood stretching his hands about him , as if there were some friend approaching within his reach , on whom his desolate touch might rest , yet do no harm . As he did this , his face became less fixed and wondering ; a gentle trembling came upon him ; and at last his eyes filled with tears , and he put his hands before them , and bowed down his head . His memory of sorrow , wrong , and trouble , had not come back to him ; he knew that it was not restored ; he had no passing belief or hope that it was . But some dumb stir within him made him capable , again , of being moved by what was hidden , afar off , in the music . If it were only that it told him sorrowfully the value of what he had lost , he thanked Heaven for it with a fervent gratitude . As the last chord died upon his ear , he raised his head to listen to its lingering vibration . Beyond the boy , so that his sleeping figure lay at its feet , the Phantom stood , immovable and silent , with its eyes upon him . Ghastly it was , as it had ever been , but not so cruel and relentless in its aspect — or he thought or hoped so , as he looked upon it trembling . It was not alone , but in its shadowy hand it held another hand . And whose was that ? Was the form that stood beside it indeed Milly ’s , or but her shade and picture ? The quiet head was bent a little , as her manner was , and her eyes were looking down , as if in pity , on the sleeping child . A radiant light fell on her face , but did not touch the Phantom ; for , though close beside her , it was dark and colourless as ever . “
31299	31310	31297	31297	Spectre	48	” said the Chemist , newly troubled as he looked , “
31335	31336	31297	31297	Spectre	48	” “
31343	31348	31297	31297	Spectre	48	” said the Phantom ; “
31364	31365	31359	31359	I	0	” “
31375	31380	31359	31359	I	0	” cried the Chemist . “
31384	31389	31359	31359	I	0	” replied the Phantom . “
31414	31415	31416	31416	I	0	” “
31423	31428	31429	31429	I	0	” returned the Phantom . “
31435	31436	31429	31429	I	0	” “
31442	31460	31429	31429	I	0	” exclaimed Redlaw , catching at the hope which he fancied might lie hidden in the words . “
31469	31470	31429	31429	I	0	” “
31473	31478	31429	31429	I	0	” returned the Phantom . “
31488	31492	31479	31479	I	0	” said Redlaw . “
31553	31554	31549	31549	I	0	” “
31557	31562	31549	31549	I	0	” said the Phantom . “
31572	31605	31609	31609	she	681	” The Phantom , standing like a statue , kept its gaze upon him for a while ; then turned its head suddenly , and looked upon the shadow at its side . “
31611	31662	31609	31609	she	681	” cried Redlaw , still looking upon the shade . The Phantom released the hand it had retained till now , and softly raised its own with a gesture of dismissal . Upon that , her shadow , still preserving the same attitude , began to move or melt away . “
31665	31680	31609	31609	she	681	” cried Redlaw with an earnestness to which he could not give enough expression . “
31741	31761	31769	31769	she	681	” The Phantom looked upon the shade as he did — not at him — and gave no answer . “
31786	31787	31788	31788	She	681	” “
31792	31797	31788	31788	She	681	” the Phantom answered . “
31809	31814	31799	31799	she	681	” The phantom answered : “
31819	31872	31873	31874	Terrible instructor	682	” And her shadow slowly vanished . They were face to face again , and looking on each other , as intently and awfully as at the time of the bestowal of the gift , across the boy who still lay on the ground between them , at the Phantom ’s feet . “
31876	31894	31873	31874	Terrible instructor	682	” said the Chemist , sinking on his knee before it , in an attitude of supplication , “
31976	31977	31978	31978	You	684	” “
31988	32002	32003	32003	I	0	” the phantom interposed , and pointed with its finger to the boy . “
32006	32011	32003	32003	I	0	” returned the Chemist . “
32047	32048	32036	32036	I	0	” “
32051	32061	32036	32036	I	0	” said the Phantom , pointing to the boy , “
32202	32213	32197	32200	hundreds and by thousands	694	” Redlaw shrank , appalled , from what he heard . “
32218	32223	32197	32200	hundreds and by thousands	694	” said the Phantom , “
32315	32341	32345	32346	a father	701	” It seemed to look down upon the boy in his sleep . Redlaw , too , looked down upon him with a new emotion . “
32348	32353	32345	32346	a father	701	” said the Phantom , “
32451	32484	32487	32487	I	0	” The Chemist clasped his hands , and looked , with trembling fear and pity , from the sleeping boy to the Phantom , standing above him with his finger pointing down . “
32490	32495	32487	32487	I	0	” pursued the Spectre , “
32591	32878	32552	32552	man	1008	” The Chemist stooped upon the ground beside the boy , and , with the same kind of compassion for him that he now felt for himself , covered him as he slept , and no longer shrank from him with abhorrence or indifference . Soon , now , the distant line on the horizon brightened , the darkness faded , the sun rose red and glorious , and the chimney stacks and gables of the ancient building gleamed in the clear air , which turned the smoke and vapour of the city into a cloud of gold . The very sun - dial in his shady corner , where the wind was used to spin with such unwindy constancy , shook off the finer particles of snow that had accumulated on his dull old face in the night , and looked out at the little white wreaths eddying round and round him . Doubtless some blind groping of the morning made its way down into the forgotten crypt so cold and earthy , where the Norman arches were half buried in the ground , and stirred the dull sap in the lazy vegetation hanging to the walls , and quickened the slow principle of life within the little world of wonderful and delicate creation which existed there , with some faint knowledge that the sun was up . The Tetterbys were up , and doing . Mr. Tetterby took down the shutters of the shop , and , strip by strip , revealed the treasures of the window to the eyes , so proof against their seductions , of Jerusalem Buildings . Adolphus had been out so long already , that he was halfway on to “
32882	33210	32552	32552	man	1008	” Five small Tetterbys , whose ten round eyes were much inflamed by soap and friction , were in the tortures of a cool wash in the back kitchen ; Mrs. Tetterby presiding . Johnny , who was pushed and hustled through his toilet with great rapidity when Moloch chanced to be in an exacting frame of mind ( which was always the case ) , staggered up and down with his charge before the shop door , under greater difficulties than usual ; the weight of Moloch being much increased by a complication of defences against the cold , composed of knitted worsted - work , and forming a complete suit of chain - armour , with a head - piece and blue gaiters . It was a peculiarity of this baby to be always cutting teeth . Whether they never came , or whether they came and went away again , is not in evidence ; but it had certainly cut enough , on the showing of Mrs. Tetterby , to make a handsome dental provision for the sign of the Bull and Mouth . All sorts of objects were impressed for the rubbing of its gums , notwithstanding that it always carried , dangling at its waist ( which was immediately under its chin ) , a bone ring , large enough to have represented the rosary of a young nun . Knife - handles , umbrella - tops , the heads of walking - sticks selected from the stock , the fingers of the family in general , but especially of Johnny , nutmeg - graters , crusts , the handles of doors , and the cool knobs on the tops of pokers , were among the commonest instruments indiscriminately applied for this baby ’s relief . The amount of electricity that must have been rubbed out of it in a week , is not to be calculated . Still Mrs. Tetterby always said “
33224	33439	33222	33222	herself	1216	” and still it never did come through , and the child continued to be somebody else . The tempers of the little Tetterbys had sadly changed with a few hours . Mr. and Mrs. Tetterby themselves were not more altered than their offspring . Usually they were an unselfish , good - natured , yielding little race , sharing short commons when it happened ( which was pretty often ) contentedly and even generously , and taking a great deal of enjoyment out of a very little meat . But they were fighting now , not only for the soap and water , but even for the breakfast which was yet in perspective . The hand of every little Tetterby was against the other little Tetterbys ; and even Johnny ’s hand — the patient , much - enduring , and devoted Johnny — rose against the baby ! Yes , Mrs. Tetterby , going to the door by mere accident , saw him viciously pick out a weak place in the suit of armour where a slap would tell , and slap that blessed child . Mrs. Tetterby had him into the parlour by the collar , in that same flash of time , and repaid him the assault with usury thereto . “
33448	33453	33440	33440	You	722	” said Mrs. Tetterby . “
33462	33463	33455	33455	you	722	” “
33474	33484	33467	33467	her	726	” retorted Johnny , in a loud rebellious voice , “
33497	33498	33492	33492	you	722	” “
33504	33516	33492	33492	you	722	” said Mrs. Tetterby , relieving him of his dishonoured load . “
33522	33526	33492	33492	you	722	” said Johnny . “
33560	33596	33597	33597	I	0	” Mr. Tetterby , who had arrived upon the scene of action , rubbed his chin thoughtfully , instead of correcting the rebel , and seemed rather struck by this view of a military life . “
33614	33624	33607	33608	the child	1216	” said Mrs. Tetterby , looking at her husband , “
33644	33665	33637	33638	a slave	731	” some indistinct association with their weak descent on the tobacco trade perhaps suggested this aggravated expression to Mrs. Tetterby . “
33696	33715	33689	33689	Lord	733	” said Mrs. Tetterby , shaking the baby with an irritability hardly suited to so pious an aspiration , “
33724	33766	33721	33721	her	1216	” Not being able to discover , and not rendering the subject much clearer by shaking it , Mrs. Tetterby put the baby away in a cradle , and , folding her arms , sat rocking it angrily with her foot . “
33775	33783	33773	33773	Dolphus	57	” said Mrs. Tetterby to her husband . “
33791	33792	33787	33787	you	0	” “
33802	33807	33794	33794	I	0	” Mr. Tetterby replied . “
33817	33822	33808	33808	I	0	” said Mrs. Tetterby . “
33834	33968	33829	33829	I	0	” said Mr. Tetterby . A diversion arose here among Johnny and his five younger brothers , who , in preparing the family breakfast table , had fallen to skirmishing for the temporary possession of the loaf , and were buffeting one another with great heartiness ; the smallest boy of all , with precocious discretion , hovering outside the knot of combatants , and harassing their legs . Into the midst of this fray , Mr. and Mrs. Tetterby both precipitated themselves with great ardour , as if such ground were the only ground on which they could now agree ; and having , with no visible remains of their late soft - heartedness , laid about them without any lenity , and done much execution , resumed their former relative positions . “
33981	33986	33969	33969	You	0	” said Mrs. Tetterby . “
33996	34005	33829	33829	I	0	” returned Mr. Tetterby , with excessive discontent . “
34008	34013	33829	33829	I	0	” said Mrs. Tetterby . “
34016	34017	33829	33829	I	0	” “
34024	34028	33969	33969	You	0	” said Tetterby . “
34042	34043	33969	33969	You	0	” “
34046	34051	33969	33969	You	0	” suggested Mrs. Tetterby . “
34057	34062	33969	33969	You	0	” replied her husband . “
34076	34081	33969	33969	You	0	” said Mrs. Tetterby . “
34132	34136	34122	34122	I	0	” grumbled Tetterby . “
34156	34196	34147	34147	I	0	” To judge from the dissatisfied expression of her face and manner , Mrs. Tetterby appeared to entertain the same opinions as her husband ; but she opposed him , nevertheless , for the gratification of quarrelling with him . “
34205	34210	34212	34212	you	0	” said Mrs. Tetterby , “
34249	34250	34256	34256	you	0	” “
34259	34264	34256	34256	you	0	” returned her husband . “
34280	34281	34275	34275	I	0	” “
34288	34293	34275	34275	I	0	” said Mrs. Tetterby . “
34298	34325	34275	34275	I	0	” The question sounded some discordant note in Mr. Tetterby ’s breast . He ruminated dejectedly , and passed his hand across and across his forehead . “
34328	34333	34334	34334	I	0	” murmured Mr. Tetterby . “
34354	34382	34275	34275	I	0	” He turned to the screen , and traced about it with his finger , until he found a certain paragraph of which he was in quest . “
34396	34407	34389	34391	the family favourites	740	” said Tetterby , in a forlorn and stupid way , “
34516	34520	34512	34512	I	0	” said Tetterby ; “
34534	34535	34521	34521	I	0	” “
34543	34551	34540	34540	he	1221	” said Mrs. Tetterby , watching him . “
34578	34579	34570	34570	dear	1067	” “
34585	34621	34570	34570	dear	1067	” her husband sourly inquired . Mrs. Tetterby shook her head ; and without replying in words , raised a complete sea - storm about the baby , by her violent agitation of the cradle . “
34635	34640	34641	34641	I	0	” said her husband . “
34648	34653	34641	34641	I	0	” said his wife . “
34662	34674	34657	34657	I	0	” pursued Mr. Tetterby , as sulkily and surlily as she , “
34702	34703	34704	34704	I	0	” “
34723	34728	34718	34718	I	0	” said his wife . “
34741	34742	34739	34739	Tetterby	50	” “
34753	34758	34748	34748	I	0	” muttered the newsman , “
34807	34808	34809	34809	He	752	” “
34837	34842	34832	34832	he	752	” muttered Mrs. Tetterby . “
34857	34862	34843	34843	I	0	” muttered Mr. Tetterby . “
34884	35100	34877	34877	I	0	” said Mrs. Tetterby with elaboration . In this mood they sat down to breakfast . The little Tetterbys were not habituated to regard that meal in the light of a sedentary occupation , but discussed it as a dance or trot ; rather resembling a savage ceremony , in the occasionally shrill whoops , and brandishings of bread and butter , with which it was accompanied , as well as in the intricate filings off into the street and back again , and the hoppings up and down the door - steps , which were incidental to the performance . In the present instance , the contentions between these Tetterby children for the milk - and - water jug , common to all , which stood upon the table , presented so lamentable an instance of angry passions risen very high indeed , that it was an outrage on the memory of Dr. Watts . It was not until Mr. Tetterby had driven the whole herd out at the front door , that a moment ’s peace was secured ; and even that was broken by the discovery that Johnny had surreptitiously come back , and was at that instant choking in the jug like a ventriloquist , in his indecent and rapacious haste . “
35112	35122	35101	35102	These children	754	” said Mrs. Tetterby , after banishing the culprit . “
35132	35133	35129	35129	I	0	” “
35137	35142	35129	35129	I	0	” said Mr. Tetterby , “
35159	35201	35151	35151	They	608	” He was at that moment taking up the cup which Mrs. Tetterby had rudely pushed towards him , and Mrs. Tetterby was lifting her own cup to her lips , when they both stopped , as if they were transfixed . “
35208	35217	35206	35206	Father	1063	” cried Johnny , running into the room . “
35227	35329	35220	35221	Mrs. William	23	” And if ever , since the world began , a young boy took a baby from a cradle with the care of an old nurse , and hushed and soothed it tenderly , and tottered away with it cheerfully , Johnny was that boy , and Moloch was that baby , as they went out together ! Mr. Tetterby put down his cup ; Mrs. Tetterby put down her cup . Mr. Tetterby rubbed his forehead ; Mrs. Tetterby rubbed hers . Mr. Tetterby ’s face began to smooth and brighten ; Mrs. Tetterby ’s began to smooth and brighten . “
35336	35343	35332	35332	Lord	761	” said Mr. Tetterby to himself , “
35361	35362	35332	35332	Lord	761	” “
35381	35393	35374	35374	I	0	” sobbed Mrs. Tetterby , with her apron to her eyes . “
35399	35404	35396	35397	a brute	763	” said Mr. Tetterby , “
35421	35422	35424	35424	Dolphus	57	” “
35427	35432	35433	35433	I	0	” returned his wife . “
35443	35448	35435	35435	I’ve	0	” said Mr. Tetterby , “
35460	35461	35458	35458	Sophy	61	” “
35476	35487	35474	35474	Dolf	63	” cried his wife in a great burst of grief . “
35491	35496	35489	35489	Sophia	61	” said Mr. Tetterby , “
35519	35520	35516	35516	I	0	” “
35533	35538	35539	35541	My little woman	331	” cried Mrs. Tetterby . “
35543	35548	35539	35541	My little woman	331	” said her husband , “
35599	35600	35591	35591	I	0	” “
35612	35617	35618	35618	Sophia	61	” cried his wife . “
35620	35625	35618	35618	Sophia	61	” said Mr. Tetterby , “
35647	35648	35643	35645	My little woman	331	” “
35656	35663	35649	35650	Mrs. William	23	” screamed Johnny at the door . “
35672	35683	35684	35684	I	0	” gasped Mr. Tetterby , supporting himself by his chair , “
35725	35736	35719	35719	I	0	” said Mr. Tetterby , with severe self - accusation , “
35822	35846	35849	35849	Dolf	63	” Mrs. Tetterby , in a whirlwind of laughing and crying , caught his face within her hands , and held it there . “
35851	35855	35849	35849	Dolf	63	” she cried . “
36029	36030	36027	36027	Dolf	63	” “
36038	36171	36035	36036	Mrs. William	23	” cried Johnny . So she was , and all the children with her ; and so she came in , they kissed her , and kissed one another , and kissed the baby , and kissed their father and mother , and then ran back and flocked and danced about her , trooping on with her in triumph . Mr. and Mrs. Tetterby were not a bit behind - hand in the warmth of their reception . They were as much attracted to her as the children were ; they ran towards her , kissed her hands , pressed round her , could not receive her ardently or enthusiastically enough . She came among them like the spirit of all goodness , affection , gentle consideration , love , and domesticity . “
36192	36204	36176	36176	you	782	” said Milly , clapping her hands in a pleasant wonder . “
36213	36249	36176	36176	you	782	” More shouting from the children , more kissing , more trooping round her , more happiness , more love , more joy , more honour , on all sides , than she could bear . “
36253	36257	36176	36176	you	782	” said Milly , “
36283	36284	36276	36276	I	0	” “
36290	36295	36276	36276	I	0	” cried Mr. Tetterby . “
36301	36306	36307	36310	Who can help it	784	” cried Mrs. Tetterby . “
36312	36362	36363	36363	I	0	” echoed the children , in a joyful chorus . And they danced and trooped about her again , and clung to her , and laid their rosy faces against her dress , and kissed and fondled it , and could not fondle it , or her , enough . “
36369	36377	36379	36379	I	0	” said Milly , drying her eyes , “
36519	36520	36521	36521	She	789	” “
36525	36547	36521	36521	She	789	” said Mr. Tetterby . Mrs. Tetterby said she was right . All the children cried out that she was right . “
36557	36561	36521	36521	She	789	” said Milly . “
36829	36835	36796	36796	his	1517	” said Milly , sobbing . “
36853	36911	36912	36919	Kind nurse , gentlest , best of creatures	798	” While she was speaking , Redlaw had come in , and , after pausing for a moment to observe the group of which she was the centre , had silently ascended the stairs . Upon those stairs he now appeared again ; remaining there , while the young student passed him , and came running down . “
36921	36938	36912	36919	Kind nurse , gentlest , best of creatures	798	” he said , falling on his knee to her , and catching at her hand , “
36944	36945	36912	36919	Kind nurse , gentlest , best of creatures	798	” “
36952	36957	36912	36919	Kind nurse , gentlest , best of creatures	798	” cried Milly innocently , “
36981	37017	37018	37018	I	0	” The guileless , simple way in which she said it , and in which she put her hands before her eyes and wept for very happiness , was as touching as it was delightful . “
37023	37027	37018	37018	I	0	” he said . “
37132	37133	37117	37117	you	801	” “

37237	37249	37217	37217	You	801	” She beckoned him aside , and whispered in his ear . “

37336	37340	37332	37333	some one	1056	” said Milly . “
37344	37363	37364	37364	Hush	75	” asked the student , glancing round involuntarily towards Redlaw , who had come down from the stairs . “
37368	37372	37376	37378	no one else	466	” said Milly . “
37380	37381	37376	37378	no one else	466	” “
37384	37388	37390	37390	you	0	” said Milly , “
37393	37394	37390	37390	you	0	” “
37399	37414	37390	37390	you	0	” Before he could say more , she put her hand upon his mouth . “
37419	37423	37424	37426	The young lady	806	” said Milly . “
37501	37505	37495	37495	She	806	” said Milly . “
37513	37514	37495	37495	She	806	” “
37523	37524	37520	37520	she	806	” “
37531	37542	37527	37527	she	806	” said Milly , advancing her lips to his ear , “
37557	37573	37527	37527	she	806	” He pressed her hand , and was darting off , but she detained him . “
37608	37906	37601	37601	he	24	” The young man assured her , by a look , that her caution was not ill - bestowed ; and as he passed the Chemist on his way out , bent respectfully and with an obvious interest before him . Redlaw returned the salutation courteously and even humbly , and looked after him as he passed on . He drooped his head upon his hand too , as trying to reawaken something he had lost . But it was gone . The abiding change that had come upon him since the influence of the music , and the Phantom ’s reappearance , was , that now he truly felt how much he had lost , and could compassionate his own condition , and contrast it , clearly , with the natural state of those who were around him . In this , an interest in those who were around him was revived , and a meek , submissive sense of his calamity was bred , resembling that which sometimes obtains in age , when its mental powers are weakened , without insensibility or sullenness being added to the list of its infirmities . He was conscious that , as he redeemed , through Milly , more and more of the evil he had done , and as he was more and more with her , this change ripened itself within him . Therefore , and because of the attachment she inspired him with ( but without other hope ) , he felt that he was quite dependent on her , and that she was his staff in his affliction . So , when she asked him whether they should go home now , to where the old man and her husband were , and he readily replied “
37907	38169	38177	38177	they	817	yes”—being anxious in that regard — he put his arm through hers , and walked beside her ; not as if he were the wise and learned man to whom the wonders of Nature were an open book , and hers were the uninstructed mind , but as if their two positions were reversed , and he knew nothing , and she all . He saw the children throng about her , and caress her , as he and she went away together thus , out of the house ; he heard the ringing of their laughter , and their merry voices ; he saw their bright faces , clustering around him like flowers ; he witnessed the renewed contentment and affection of their parents ; he breathed the simple air of their poor home , restored to its tranquillity ; he thought of the unwholesome blight he had shed upon it , and might , but for her , have been diffusing then ; and perhaps it is no wonder that he walked submissively beside her , and drew her gentle bosom nearer to his own . When they arrived at the Lodge , the old man was sitting in his chair in the chimney - corner , with his eyes fixed on the ground , and his son was leaning against the opposite side of the fire - place , looking at him . As she came in at the door , both started , and turned round towards her , and a radiant change came upon their faces . “
38188	38203	38177	38177	they	817	” cried Milly , clapping her hands in an ecstasy , and stopping short . “
38209	38286	38177	38177	they	817	” Pleased to see her ! Pleasure was no word for it . She ran into her husband ’s arms , thrown wide open to receive her , and he would have been glad to have her there , with her head lying on his shoulder , through the short winter ’s day . But the old man could n’t spare her . He had arms for her too , and he locked her in them . “
38299	38305	38293	38293	Mouse	39	” said the old man . “
38343	38344	38341	38341	William	23	” “
38354	38359	38350	38350	myself	0	” returned his son . “
38382	38383	38378	38378	you	1063	” “
38391	38443	38388	38389	my boy	1137	” returned the old man . It was quite a sight to see Mr. William shaking hands with his father , and patting him on the back , and rubbing him gently down with his hand , as if he could not possibly do enough to show an interest in him . “
38465	38487	38458	38458	you	1063	” said William , shaking hands with him again , and patting him again , and rubbing him gently down again . “
38501	38502	38458	38458	you	1063	” “
38520	38528	38504	38506	a wonderful man	825	” said Mr. William , with enthusiasm . “
38618	38666	38667	38667	I	0	” Mr. William might never have left off repeating this inquiry , and shaking hands with him again , and patting him again , and rubbing him down again , if the old man had not espied the Chemist , whom until now he had not seen . “
38675	38679	38672	38673	Mr. Redlaw	24	” said Philip , “
38790	38796	38787	38788	Mr. Redlaw	24	” The Chemist answered yes . “
38799	38805	38806	38806	She	840	” said the old man . “
38845	38857	38838	38838	you	24	” The Chemist looked at him , and shook his head . “
38863	38873	38860	38861	a sister	1176	” he said vacantly . He knew no more . “
38878	38884	38860	38861	a sister	1176	” pursued the old man , “
39092	39142	39143	39143	Philip	34	” Tears more painful , and more bitter than he had ever shed in all his life , coursed down Redlaw ’s face . Philip , fully occupied in recalling his story , had not observed him until now , nor Milly ’s anxiety that he should not proceed . “
39145	39156	39143	39143	Philip	34	” said Redlaw , laying his hand upon his arm , “
39196	39197	39176	39176	You	34	” “
39201	39207	39176	39176	You	34	” cried the old man . “
39221	39226	39208	39208	I	0	” said the Chemist , “
39238	39303	39230	39230	I	0	” To see old Philip ’s pity for him , to see him wheel his own great chair for him to rest in , and look down upon him with a solemn sense of his bereavement , was to know , in some degree , how precious to old age such recollections are . The boy came running in , and ran to Milly . “
39309	39313	39306	39307	the man	101	” he said , “
39327	39328	39319	39319	I	0	” “
39335	39340	39332	39332	he	101	” asked Mr. William . “
39343	39379	39332	39332	he	101	” said Milly . Obedient to a sign from her , he and his old father softly withdrew . As they went out , unnoticed , Redlaw beckoned to the boy to come to him . “
39386	39395	39380	39380	I	0	” he answered , holding to her skirts . “
39400	39409	39396	39396	You	1206	” said Redlaw , with a faint smile . “
39438	39526	39527	39528	Mr. Redlaw	24	” The boy still held back at first , but yielding little by little to her urging , he consented to approach , and even to sit down at his feet . As Redlaw laid his hand upon the shoulder of the child , looking on him with compassion and a fellow - feeling , he put out his other hand to Milly . She stooped down on that side of him , so that she could look into his face , and after silence , said : “
39536	39537	39531	39531	I	0	” “
39540	39550	39531	39531	I	0	” he answered , fixing his eyes upon her . “
39561	39562	39551	39551	Your	0	” “
39569	39570	39564	39564	I	0	” “
39575	39576	39572	39572	you	24	” “
39610	39611	39581	39581	I	0	” “
39617	39625	39614	39614	I	0	” he said , with some hesitation . “
39631	39651	39652	39653	This person	868	” He smoothed the boy ’s hair — looking at her fixedly the while , and shook his head . “
39655	39680	39652	39653	This person	868	” said Milly , in her clear , soft voice , which her mild eyes , looking at him , made clearer and softer , “
39720	39764	39765	39765	He	868	” He took his hand from the boy , and laying it on the back of that hand of hers , whose timid and yet earnest touch addressed him no less appealingly than her voice and eyes , looked more intently on her . “
39792	39793	39794	39794	I	0	” “
39799	39800	39794	39794	I	0	” “
39805	39806	39810	39811	the man	101	” “
39819	39820	39814	39814	he	101	” “
39823	39824	39814	39814	he	101	” “
39834	39856	39857	39857	I	0	” He shook his head , and softly beat upon the hand he held , as though mutely asking her commiseration . “
39867	39869	39873	39873	me	0	” said Milly,—“You
39884	39885	39879	39879	you	0	” “
39892	39893	39879	39879	you	0	” “
40020	40047	40051	40051	me	0	” she rose up , hastily , and going out for a moment , returned , accompanied by the wreck that Redlaw had beheld last night . “
40053	40058	40051	40051	me	0	” asked the Chemist . “
40064	40069	40059	40059	I	0	” returned the other , “
40087	40139	40049	40049	you	0	” The Chemist looked at the man , standing in self - abasement and degradation before him , and would have looked longer , in an ineffectual struggle for enlightenment , but that Milly resumed her late position by his side , and attracted his attentive gaze to her own face . “
40152	40171	40049	40049	you	0	” she whispered , stretching out her arm towards him , without looking from the Chemist ’s face . “
40224	40225	40226	40226	I	0	” “
40231	40235	40226	40226	I	0	” he answered . “
40241	40288	40236	40236	I	0	” His eyes wandered to the figure standing near the door , but came back speedily to her , on whom he gazed intently , as if he strove to learn some lesson from every tone of her voice , and every beam of her eyes . “
40299	40303	40295	40295	you	0	” said Milly ; “
40341	40342	40318	40318	I	0	” “
40345	40346	40318	40318	I	0	” “
40353	40354	40318	40318	I	0	” “
40361	40370	40356	40356	me	0	” said Redlaw , lifting up his eyes , “
40380	40381	40356	40356	me	0	” “
40385	40389	40356	40356	me	0	” said Milly , “
40427	40465	40466	40466	He	885	” He looked at the figure by the door , and fastened his attentive eyes on her again ; a ray of clearer light appeared to him to shine into his mind , from her bright face . “
40615	40631	40637	40637	I	0	” He took her head between her hands , and kissed it , and said : “
40672	40711	40712	40712	You	895	” As she rose , and turned her beaming face towards the fallen man , implying that her mediation had been successful , he advanced a step , and without raising his eyes , addressed himself to Redlaw . “
40717	40721	40712	40712	You	895	” he said , “
40765	40804	40763	40763	me	0	” The Chemist entreated Milly , by a gesture , to come nearer to him ; and , as he listened looked in her face , as if to find in it the clue to what he heard . “
40867	40897	40864	40864	I	0	” Redlaw , keeping her close at his side , turned his face towards the speaker , and there was sorrow in it . Something like mournful recognition too . “
40974	40996	40997	40997	I	0	” Redlaw made a hasty motion with his hand , as if he would have put that subject on one side . “
41000	41006	40997	40997	I	0	” the other went on , “
41035	41036	41015	41015	I	0	” “
41045	41053	41040	41040	he	900	” sobbed Milly , under her breath . “
41058	41059	41040	41040	he	900	” “
41161	41177	41178	41178	I	0	” He turned towards the door , and stopped a moment on his way forth . “
41231	41370	41223	41223	I	0	” Going out , he raised his eyes to Redlaw for the first time . Redlaw , whose steadfast gaze was fixed upon him , dreamily held out his hand . He returned and touched it — little more — with both his own ; and bending down his head , went slowly out . In the few moments that elapsed , while Milly silently took him to the gate , the Chemist dropped into his chair , and covered his face with his hands . Seeing him thus , when she came back , accompanied by her husband and his father ( who were both greatly concerned for him ) , she avoided disturbing him , or permitting him to be disturbed ; and kneeled down near the chair to put some warm clothing on the boy . “
41387	41393	41381	41381	I	0	” exclaimed her admiring husband . “
41411	41412	41400	41401	Mrs. William	23	” “
41417	41423	41424	41424	you	905	” said the old man ; “
41434	41435	41430	41430	William	23	” “
41449	41456	41430	41430	William	23	” said Mr. William , tenderly , “
41509	41510	41511	41511	I	0	” “
41524	41528	41521	41521	William	23	” she answered . “
41536	41537	41529	41529	I	0	” “
41549	41550	41529	41529	I	0	” “
41591	41592	41589	41589	William	23	” “
41603	41610	41596	41597	an angel	914	” said Mr. William , softly . “
41615	41616	41596	41597	an angel	914	” “
41666	41670	41671	41671	I	0	” said Milly , “
41734	41745	41753	41753	me	0	” Redlaw raised his head , and looked towards her . “
41755	41759	41753	41753	me	0	” she continued , “
41877	41901	41902	41902	Children	608	” Her quiet voice was quieter than ever , as she took her husband ’s arm , and laid her head against it . “
42040	42052	42038	42038	Mother	359	” Redlaw fell upon his knees , with a loud cry . “
42056	42060	42054	42054	Thou	932	” he said , “
42105	42129	42130	42130	He	80	” Then , he folded her to his heart ; and Milly , sobbing more than ever , cried , as she laughed , “
