I wo n't stay in this dead country and decay with it . I 've had it on my mind sometime . I 'm going to sell out here for whatever I can get , and buy a wagon and team and put you and the children in it and start . ”
1779	1810	1823	1823	Hawkins	365	“ Anywhere that suits you , suits me , Si . And the children ca n't be any worse off in Missouri than , they are here , I reckon . ”

1850	1909	1823	1823	Hawkins	365	“ Do you see these papers ? Well , they are evidence that I have taken up Seventy - five Thousand Acres of Land in this county -- think what an enormous fortune it will be some day ! Why , Nancy , enormous do n't express it -- the word 's too tame ! I tell your Nancy---- ”

1917	2072	2075	2075	he	850	“ Wait , Nancy , wait -- let me finish -- I've been secretly bailing and fuming with this grand inspiration for weeks , and I must talk or I 'll burst ! I have n't whispered to a soul -- not a word -- have had my countenance under lock and key , for fear it might drop something that would tell even these animals here how to discern the gold mine that 's glaring under their noses . Now all that is necessary to hold this land and keep it in the family is to pay the trifling taxes on it yearly -- five or ten dollars -- the whole tract would not sell for over a third of a cent an acre now , but some day people will be glad to get it for twenty dollars , fifty dollars , a hundred dollars an acre ! What should you say to ”
2095	2102	2075	2075	he	850	“ a thousand dollars an acre ! “
2245	2455	2457	2457	He	859	“ Even you and I will see the day that steamboats will come up that little Turkey river to within twenty miles of this land of ours -- and in high water they 'll come right to it ! And this is not all , Nancy -- it is n't even half ! There 's a bigger wonder -- the railroad ! These worms here have never even heard of it -- and when they do they 'll not believe in it . But it 's another fact . Coaches that fly over the ground twenty miles an hour -- heavens and earth , think of that , Nancy ! Twenty miles an hour . It makes a man 's brain whirl . Some day , when you and I are in our graves , there 'll be a railroad stretching hundreds of miles -- all the way down from the cities of the Northern States to New Orleans -- and its got to run within thirty miles of this land -- may be even touch a corner of it . Well , do you know , they 've quit burning wood in some places in the Eastern States ? And what do you suppose they burn ? Coal ! ”
2464	2868	2457	2457	He	859	“ There 's world -- worlds of it on this land ! You know that black stuff that crops out of the bank of the branch?--well , that 's it . You 've taken it for rocks ; so has every body here ; and they 've built little dams and such things with it . One man was going to build a chimney out of it . Nancy I expect I turned as white as a sheet ! Why , it might have caught fire and told everything . I showed him it was too crumbly . Then he was going to build it of copper ore -- splendid yellow forty - per - cent . ore ! There 's fortunes upon fortunes of copper ore on our land ! It scared me to death , the idea of this fool starting a smelting furnace in his house without knowing it , and getting his dull eyes opened . And then he was going to build it of iron ore ! There 's mountains of iron ore here , Nancy -- whole mountains of it . I would n't take any chances . I just stuck by him -- I haunted him -- I never let him alone till he built it of mud and sticks like all the rest of the chimneys in this dismal country . Pine forests , wheat land , corn land , iron , copper , coal -- wait till the railroads come , and the steamboats ! We 'll never see the day , Nancy -- never in the world -- never , never , never , child . We 've got to drag along , drag along , and eat crusts in toil and poverty , all hopeless and forlorn -- but they 'll ride in coaches , Nancy ! They 'll live like the princes of the earth ; they 'll be courted and worshiped ; their names will be known from ocean to ocean ! Ah , well - a - day ! Will they ever come back here , on the railroad and the steamboat , and say , ' This one little spot shall not be touched -- this hovel shall be sacred -- for here our father and our mother suffered for us , thought for us , laid the foundations of our future as solid as the hills ! ' ”
2869	2896	2904	2904	she	860	“ You are a great , good , noble soul , Si Hawkins , and I am an honored woman to be the wife of such a man”--and
2908	3000	2904	2904	she	860	“ We will go to Missouri . You are out of your place , here , among these groping dumb creatures . We will find a higher place , where you can walk with your own kind , and be understood when you speak -- not stared at as if you were talking some foreign tongue . I would go anywhere , anywhere in the wide world with you . I would rather my body would starve and die than your mind should hunger and wither away in this lonely land . ”
3001	3046	3047	3047	He	861	“ Spoken like yourself , my child ! But we 'll not starve , Nancy . Far from it . I have a letter from Beriah Sellers -- just came this day . A letter that -- I'll read you a line from it ! ”
3148	3989	3991	3991	he	863	“ I was afraid of it -- was afraid of it . Trying to make our fortune in Virginia , Beriah Sellers nearly ruined us and we had to settle in Kentucky and start over again . Trying to make our fortune in Kentucky he crippled us again and we had to move here . Trying to make our fortune here , he brought us clear down to the ground , nearly . He 's an honest soul , and means the very best in the world , but I 'm afraid , I 'm afraid he 's too flighty . He has splendid ideas , and he 'll divide his chances with his friends with a free hand , the good generous soul , but something does seem to always interfere and spoil everything . I never did think he was right well balanced . But I do n't blame my husband , for I do think that when that man gets his head full of a new notion , he can out - talk a machine . He 'll make anybody believe in that notion that 'll listen to him ten minutes -- why I do believe he would make a deaf and dumb man believe in it and get beside himself , if you only set him where he could see his eyes tally and watch his hands explain . What a head he has got ! When he got up that idea there in Virginia of buying up whole loads of negroes in Delaware and Virginia and Tennessee , very quiet , having papers drawn to have them delivered at a place in Alabama and take them and pay for them , away yonder at a certain time , and then in the meantime get a law made stopping everybody from selling negroes to the south after a certain day -- it was somehow that way -- mercy how the man would have made money ! Negroes would have gone up to four prices . But after he 'd spent money and worked hard , and traveled hard , and had heaps of negroes all contracted for , and everything going along just right , he could n't get the laws passed and down the whole thing tumbled . And there in Kentucky , when he raked up that old numskull that had been inventing away at a perpetual motion machine for twenty - two years , and Beriah Sellers saw at a glance where just one more little cog - wheel would settle the business , why I could see it as plain as day when he came in wild at midnight and hammered us out of bed and told the whole thing in a whisper with the doors bolted and the candle in an empty barrel . Oceans of money in it -- anybody could see that . But it did cost a deal to buy the old numskull out -- and then when they put the new cog wheel in they 'd overlooked something somewhere and it was n't any use -- the troublesome thing would n't go . That notion he got up here did look as handy as anything in the world ; and how him and Si did sit up nights working at it with the curtains down and me watching to see if any neighbors were about . The man did honestly believe there was a fortune in that black gummy oil that stews out of the bank Si says is coal ; and he refined it himself till it was like water , nearly , and it did burn , there 's no two ways about that ; and I reckon he 'd have been all right in Cincinnati with his lamp that he got made , that time he got a house full of rich speculators to see him exhibit only in the middle of his speech it let go and almost blew the heads off the whole crowd . I have n't got over grieving for the money that cost yet . I am sorry enough Beriah Sellers is in Missouri , now , but I was glad when he went . I wonder what his letter says . But of course it 's cheerful ; he 's never down - hearted -- never had any trouble in his life -- didn't know it if he had . It 's always sunrise with that man , and fine and blazing , at that -- never gets noon , though -- leaves off and rises again . Nobody can help liking the creature , he means so well -- but I do dread to come across him again ; he 's bound to set us all crazy , of course . Well , there goes old widow Hopkins -- it always takes her a week to buy a spool of thread and trade a hank of yarn . Maybe Si can come with the letter , now . ”
3994	4020	3991	3991	he	863	“ Widow Hopkins kept me -- I have n't any patience with such tedious people . Now listen , Nancy -- just listen at this : “
4186	4205	4161	4161	Mum	377	“ It 's the same old boy , Nancy , jest the same old boy -- ain't he ? ”
4206	4234	4161	4161	Mum	377	“ Yes , I think there 's a little of the old sound about his voice yet . I suppose you -- you'll still go , Si ? ”
4235	4287	4161	4161	Mum	377	“ Go ! Well , I should think so , Nancy . It 's all a chance , of course , and , chances have n't been kind to us , I 'll admit -- but whatever comes , old wife , they 're provided for . Thank God for that ! ”
4288	4291	4161	4161	Mum	377	“ Amen , ”
4426	4443	4417	4417	He	374	“ Come , come , little chap , you must n't be going to sleep before sundown ”
4464	4485	4486	4487	The boy	877	“ Ah , I 'm sorry I spoke so , my boy . Tell me -- is anything the matter ? ”
4653	4999	4637	4639	An old lady	886	“ His mother , po ' thing . Died of the fever , last night . Tha warn't no sich thing as saving of her . But it 's better for her -- better for her . Husband and the other two children died in the spring , and she hain't ever hilt up her head sence . She jest went around broken - hearted like , and never took no intrust in anything but Clay -- that 's the boy thar . She jest worshiped Clay -- and Clay he worshiped her . They did n't ' pear to live at all , only when they was together , looking at each other , loving one another . She 's ben sick three weeks ; and if you believe me that child has worked , and kep ' the run of the med'cin , and the times of giving it , and sot up nights and nussed her , and tried to keep up her sperits , the same as a grown - up person . And last night when she kep ' a sinking and sinking , and turned away her head and did n't know him no mo ' , it was fitten to make a body 's heart break to see him climb onto the bed and lay his cheek agin hern and call her so pitiful and she not answer . But bymeby she roused up , like , and looked around wild , and then she see him , and she made a great cry and snatched him to her breast and hilt him close and kissed him over and over agin ; but it took the last po ' strength she had , and so her eyelids begin to close down , and her arms sort o ' drooped away and then we see she was gone , po ' creetur . And Clay , he -- Oh , the po ' motherless thing -- I cain't talk about it -- I cain't bear to talk about it . ”
5118	5213	5111	5113	The old lady	890	“ She always loved that kind o ' flowers . He fetched 'em for her every morning , and she always kissed him . They was from away north somers -- she kep ' school when she fust come . Goodness knows what 's to become o ' that po ' boy . No father , no mother , no kin folks of no kind . Nobody to go to , nobody that k'yers for him -- and all of us is so put to it for to get along and families so large . ”
5228	5291	5225	5225	He	374	“ Friends , I am not very well provided for , myself , but still I would not turn my back on a homeless orphan . If he will go with me I will give him a home , and loving regard -- I will do for him as I would have another do for a child of my own in misfortune . ”

5486	5578	5483	5483	She	839	“ If you 've done wrong , Si Hawkins , it 's a wrong that will shine brighter at the judgment day than the rights that many a man has done before you . And there is n't any compliment you can pay me equal to doing a thing like this and finishing it up , just taking it for granted that I 'll be willing to it . Willing ? Come to me ; you poor motherless boy , and let me take your grief and help you carry it . ”

7661	8073	7654	7654	he	973	” He did go to the woods and pray ; but he went so far that he doubted , himself , if the Lord heard him when He went by . CHAPTER IV . --Seventhly , Before his Voyage , He should make his peace with God , satisfie his Creditors if he be in debt ; Pray earnestly to God to prosper him in his Voyage , and to keep him from danger , and , if he be ' sui juris ' he should make his last will , and wisely order all his affairs , since many that go far abroad , return not home . ( This good and Christian Counsel is given by Martinus Zeilerus in his Apodemical Canons before his Itinerary of Spain and Portugal . ) Early in the morning Squire Hawkins took passage in a small steamboat , with his family and his two slaves , and presently the bell rang , the stage - plank was hauled in , and the vessel proceeded up the river . The children and the slaves were not much more at ease after finding out that this monster was a creature of human contrivance than they were the night before when they thought it the Lord of heaven and earth . They started , in fright , every time the gauge - cocks sent out an angry hiss , and they quaked from head to foot when the mud - valves thundered . The shivering of the boat under the beating of the wheels was sheer misery to them . But of course familiarity with these things soon took away their terrors , and then the voyage at once became a glorious adventure , a royal progress through the very heart and home of romance , a realization of their rosiest wonder - dreams . They sat by the hour in the shade of the pilot house on the hurricane deck and looked out over the curving expanses of the river sparkling in the sunlight . Sometimes the boat fought the mid - stream current , with a verdant world on either hand , and remote from both ; sometimes she closed in under a point , where the dead water and the helping eddies were , and shaved the bank so closely that the decks were swept by the jungle of over - hanging willows and littered with a spoil of leaves ; departing from these “
8075	8087	7654	7654	he	973	” she regularly crossed the river every five miles , avoiding the “
8089	8109	7654	7654	he	973	” of the great binds and thus escaping the strong current ; sometimes she went out and skirted a high “
8111	8153	7654	7654	he	973	” sand - bar in the middle of the stream , and occasionally followed it up a little too far and touched upon the shoal water at its head -- and then the intelligent craft refused to run herself aground , but “
8155	8221	7654	7654	he	973	” the bar , and straightway the foamy streak that streamed away from her bows vanished , a great foamless wave rolled forward and passed her under way , and in this instant she leaned far over on her side , shied from the bar and fled square away from the danger like a frightened thing -- and the pilot was lucky if he managed to “
8225	8278	7654	7654	he	973	” before she drove her nose into the opposite bank ; sometimes she approached a solid wall of tall trees as if she meant to break through it , but all of a sudden a little crack would open just enough to admit her , and away she would go plowing through the “
8280	8370	7654	7654	he	973	” with just barely room enough between the island on one side and the main land on the other ; in this sluggish water she seemed to go like a racehorse ; now and then small log cabins appeared in little clearings , with the never - failing frowsy women and girls in soiled and faded linsey - woolsey leaning in the doors or against woodpiles and rail fences , gazing sleepily at the passing show ; sometimes she found shoal water , going out at the head of those “
8372	8677	7654	7654	he	973	” or crossing the river , and then a deck - hand stood on the bow and hove the lead , while the boat slowed down and moved cautiously ; sometimes she stopped a moment at a landing and took on some freight or a passenger while a crowd of slouchy white men and negroes stood on the bank and looked sleepily on with their hands in their pantaloons pockets,--of course -- for they never took them out except to stretch , and when they did this they squirmed about and reached their fists up into the air and lifted themselves on tip - toe in an ecstasy of enjoyment . When the sun went down it turned all the broad river to a national banner laid in gleaming bars of gold and purple and crimson ; and in time these glories faded out in the twilight and left the fairy archipelagoes reflecting their fringing foliage in the steely mirror of the stream . At night the boat forged on through the deep solitudes of the river , hardly ever discovering a light to testify to a human presence -- mile after mile and league after league the vast bends were guarded by unbroken walls of forest that had never been disturbed by the voice or the foot - fall of man or felt the edge of his sacrilegious axe . An hour after supper the moon came up , and Clay and Washington ascended to the hurricane deck to revel again in their new realm of enchantment . They ran races up and down the deck ; climbed about the bell ; made friends with the passenger - dogs chained under the lifeboat ; tried to make friends with a passenger - bear fastened to the verge - staff but were not encouraged ; “
8681	8733	8735	8735	his	976	” on the hog - chains ; in a word , exhausted the amusement - possibilities of the deck . Then they looked wistfully up at the pilot house , and finally , little by little , Clay ventured up there , followed diffidently by Washington . The pilot turned presently to “
8740	8844	8846	8846	George	391	” saw the lads and invited them in . Now their happiness was complete . This cosy little house , built entirely of glass and commanding a marvelous prospect in every direction was a magician 's throne to them and their enjoyment of the place was simply boundless . They sat them down on a high bench and looked miles ahead and saw the wooded capes fold back and reveal the bends beyond ; and they looked miles to the rear and saw the silvery highway diminish its breadth by degrees and close itself together in the distance . Presently the pilot said : “
8853	8890	8850	8851	the Amaranth	392	” A spark appeared , close to the water , several miles down the river . The pilot took his glass and looked at it steadily for a moment , and said , chiefly to himself : “
8915	8925	8910	8911	the Amaranth	392	” He bent over a speaking tube and said : “
8933	8947	8948	8948	I	0	” A hollow , unhuman voice rumbled up through the tube in answer : “
8954	8955	8951	8952	Second engineer	978	” “
8988	9023	8978	8978	she	392	” The pilot took hold of a rope that stretched out forward , jerked it twice , and two mellow strokes of the big bell responded . A voice out on the deck shouted : “
9035	9036	8978	8978	she	392	” “
9046	9051	9052	9052	I	0	” said the pilot , “
9078	9079	9084	9084	sir	980	” “
9086	9088	9084	9084	sir	980	” The “
9091	9107	9108	9108	Jim	394	” was the captain -- he is always called so , on steamboats and ships ; “
9109	9152	9153	9153	I	0	” was the other pilot . Within two minutes both of these men were flying up the pilothouse stairway , three steps at a jump . Jim was in his shirt sleeves,--with his coat and vest on his arm . He said : “
9163	9170	9108	9108	Jim	394	” He took it and looked : “
9194	9207	9188	9189	the Amaranth	392	” The captain took a good long look , and only said : “
9210	9228	9188	9189	the Amaranth	392	” George Davis , the pilot on watch , shouted to the night - watchman on deck : “
9234	9235	9242	9242	sir	980	” “
9244	9245	9242	9242	sir	980	” “
9252	9259	9261	9262	the mate	983	” The captain shouted , now : “
9291	9292	9297	9297	sir	980	” “
9299	9326	9297	9297	sir	980	” A riot of shouting and trampling floated up from below , presently , and the uneasy steering of the boat soon showed that she was getting “
9332	9395	9297	9297	sir	980	” The three men in the pilot house began to talk in short , sharp sentences , low and earnestly . As their excitement rose , their voices went down . As fast as one of them put down the spy - glass another took it up -- but always with a studied air of calmness . Each time the verdict was : “
9401	9409	9396	9396	She	392	” The captain spoke through the tube : “
9416	9417	9413	9413	you	980	” “
9438	9511	9428	9428	she	392	” The boat was straining and groaning and quivering like a monster in pain . Both pilots were at work now , one on each side of the wheel , with their coats and vests off , their bosoms and collars wide open and the perspiration flowing down heir faces . They were holding the boat so close to the shore that the willows swept the guards almost from stem to stern . “
9515	9519	9428	9428	she	392	” whispered George . “
9523	9531	9428	9428	she	392	” said Jim , under his breath . “
9536	9581	9582	9582	Lord	988	” The boat sprang away from the bank like a deer , and darted in a long diagonal toward the other shore . She closed in again and thrashed her fierce way along the willows as before . The captain put down the glass : “
9597	9598	9599	9599	Jim	394	” “
9601	9624	9599	9599	Jim	394	” said George , looking straight ahead , watching the slightest yawing of the boat and promptly meeting it with the wheel , “
9635	9636	9599	9599	Jim	394	” “
9662	9663	9711	9711	She	392	” “
9670	9671	9711	9711	She	392	” “
9716	9851	9711	9711	She	392	it!”--meaning the Amaranth . In another instant the Boreas plunged into what seemed a crooked creek , and the Amaranth 's approaching lights were shut out in a moment . Not a whisper was uttered , now , but the three men stared ahead into the shadows and two of them spun the wheel back and forth with anxious watchfulness while the steamer tore along . The chute seemed to come to an end every fifty yards , but always opened out in time . Now the head of it was at hand . George tapped the big bell three times , two leadsmen sprang to their posts , and in a moment their weird cries rose on the night air and were caught up and repeated by two men on the upper deck : “
9857	9858	9711	9711	She	392	” “
9866	9867	9711	9711	She	392	” “
9871	9872	9711	9711	She	392	” “
9876	9877	9878	9878	Mark	399	” “
9887	9888	9878	9878	Mark	399	” “
9892	9893	9878	9878	Mark	399	” “
9896	9935	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” Davis pulled a couple of ropes -- there was a jingling of small bells far below , the boat 's speed slackened , and the pent steam began to whistle and the gauge - cocks to scream : “
9941	9942	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” “
9954	9955	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” “
9961	9962	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” “
9966	9967	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” “
9974	10004	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” Another jingling of little bells and the wheels ceased turning altogether . The whistling of the steam was something frightful now -- it almost drowned all other noises . “
10011	10025	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” George had the wheel hard down and was standing on a spoke . “
10029	10061	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” The boat hesitated -- seemed to hold her breath , as did the captain and pilots -- and then she began to fall away to starboard and every eye lighted : “
10072	10100	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” The wheel flew to port so fast that the spokes blended into a spider - web -- the swing of the boat subsided -- she steadied herself---- “
10104	10105	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” “
10113	10114	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” “
10120	10134	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” Bang ! She hit the bottom ! George shouted through the tube : “
10145	10175	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” Pow - wow - chow ! The escape - pipes belched snowy pillars of steam aloft , the boat ground and surged and trembled -- and slid over into---- “
10185	10186	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” “
10190	10191	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” “
10198	10202	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” ( to signify “
10207	10239	9937	9939	the mark twain	993	” ) And away she went , flying up the willow shore , with the whole silver sea of the Mississippi stretching abroad on every hand . No Amaranth in sight ! “
10255	10283	10246	10246	we	995	” said the captain . And just at that moment a red glare appeared in the head of the chute and the Amaranth came springing after them ! “
10289	10290	10286	10286	I	0	” “
10300	10301	10291	10291	Jim	394	” “
10355	10356	10335	10335	He	400	” “
10431	10432	10428	10429	old man	999	” “
10446	10463	10435	10435	I	0	” The Amaranth was within three hundred yards of the Boreas , and still gaining . The “
10466	10472	10475	10475	she	1000	” spoke through the tube : “
10480	10481	10475	10475	she	1000	” “
10491	10492	10489	10489	sir	980	” “
10498	10499	10489	10489	sir	980	” “
10516	10517	10489	10489	sir	980	” “
10538	10566	10489	10489	sir	980	” Soon the boat was plunging and quivering and screaming more madly than ever . But the Amaranth 's head was almost abreast the Boreas 's stern : “
10576	10577	10569	10569	your	980	” “
10586	10587	10569	10569	your	980	” “
10619	10630	10489	10489	sir	980	” The boat was a moving earthquake by this time : “
10636	10637	10489	10489	sir	980	” “
10668	10669	10489	10489	sir	980	” “
10677	10678	10679	10679	Bully	401	” “
10702	11173	10693	10693	he	1005	” The Amaranth drew steadily up till her jack - staff breasted the Boreas 's wheel - house -- climbed along inch by inch till her chimneys breasted it -- crept along , further and further , till the boats were wheel to wheel -- and then they closed up with a heavy jolt and locked together tight and fast in the middle of the big river under the flooding moonlight ! A roar and a hurrah went up from the crowded decks of both steamers -- all hands rushed to the guards to look and shout and gesticulate -- the weight careened the vessels over toward each other -- officers flew hither and thither cursing and storming , trying to drive the people amidships -- both captains were leaning over their railings shaking their fists , swearing and threatening -- black volumes of smoke rolled up and canopied the scene,--delivering a rain of sparks upon the vessels -- two pistol shots rang out , and both captains dodged unhurt and the packed masses of passengers surged back and fell apart while the shrieks of women and children soared above the intolerable din---- And then there was a booming roar , a thundering crash , and the riddled Amaranth dropped loose from her hold and drifted helplessly away ! Instantly the fire - doors of the Boreas were thrown open and the men began dashing buckets of water into the furnaces -- for it would have been death and destruction to stop the engines with such a head of steam on . As soon as possible the Boreas dropped down to the floating wreck and took off the dead , the wounded and the unhurt -- at least all that could be got at , for the whole forward half of the boat was a shapeless ruin , with the great chimneys lying crossed on top of it , and underneath were a dozen victims imprisoned alive and wailing for help . While men with axes worked with might and main to free these poor fellows , the Boreas 's boats went about , picking up stragglers from the river . And now a new horror presented itself . The wreck took fire from the dismantled furnaces ! Never did men work with a heartier will than did those stalwart braves with the axes . But it was of no use . The fire ate its way steadily , despising the bucket brigade that fought it . It scorched the clothes , it singed the hair of the axemen -- it drove them back , foot by foot -- inch by inch -- they wavered , struck a final blow in the teeth of the enemy , and surrendered . And as they fell back they heard prisoned voices saying : “
11192	11199	11200	11200	I	0	” And one poor fellow said : “
11292	11512	11533	11533	I	0	” The Boreas stood away out of danger , and the ruined steamer went drifting down the stream an island of wreathing and climbing flame that vomited clouds of smoke from time to time , and glared more fiercely and sent its luminous tongues higher and higher after each emission . A shriek at intervals told of a captive that had met his doom . The wreck lodged upon a sandbar , and when the Boreas turned the next point on her upward journey it was still burning with scarcely abated fury . When the boys came down into the main saloon of the Boreas , they saw a pitiful sight and heard a world of pitiful sounds . Eleven poor creatures lay dead and forty more lay moaning , or pleading or screaming , while a score of Good Samaritans moved among them doing what they could to relieve their sufferings ; bathing their chinless faces and bodies with linseed oil and lime water and covering the places with bulging masses of raw cotton that gave to every face and form a dreadful and unhuman aspect . A little wee French midshipman of fourteen lay fearfully injured , but never uttered a sound till a physician of Memphis was about to dress his hurts . Then he said : “
11527	11528	11518	11518	You	0	” “
11540	11541	11533	11533	I	0	” “
11558	11559	11533	11533	I	0	” “
11561	11562	11533	11533	I	0	” “
11594	11662	11663	11663	You	1017	” The physician -- himself a man who had seen service in the navy in his time -- touched his hat to this little hero , and passed on . The head engineer of the Amaranth , a grand specimen of physical manhood , struggled to his feet a ghastly spectacle and strode toward his brother , the second engineer , who was unhurt . He said : “
11731	11861	11712	11712	my	0	” And he tore a ring from his finger , stripping flesh and skin with it , threw it down and fell dead ! But these things must not be dwelt upon . The Boreas landed her dreadful cargo at the next large town and delivered it over to a multitude of eager hands and warm southern hearts -- a cargo amounting by this time to 39 wounded persons and 22 dead bodies . And with these she delivered a list of 96 missing persons that had drowned or otherwise perished at the scene of the disaster . A jury of inquest was impaneled , and after due deliberation and inquiry they returned the inevitable American verdict which has been so familiar to our ears all the days of our lives--“NOBODY
11865	12589	11712	11712	my	0	” * * [ The incidents of the explosion are not invented . They happened just as they are told.--The Authors . ] CHAPTER V. Il veut faire secher de la neige au four et la vendre pour du sel blanc . When the Boreas backed away from the land to continue her voyage up the river , the Hawkinses were richer by twenty - four hours of experience in the contemplation of human suffering and in learning through honest hard work how to relieve it . And they were richer in another way also . In the early turmoil an hour after the explosion , a little black - eyed girl of five years , frightened and crying bitterly , was struggling through the throng in the Boreas ' saloon calling her mother and father , but no one answered . Something in the face of Mr. Hawkins attracted her and she came and looked up at him ; was satisfied , and took refuge with him . He petted her , listened to her troubles , and said he would find her friends for her . Then he put her in a state - room with his children and told them to be kind to her ( the adults of his party were all busy with the wounded ) and straightway began his search . It was fruitless . But all day he and his wife made inquiries , and hoped against hope . All that they could learn was that the child and her parents came on board at New Orleans , where they had just arrived in a vessel from Cuba ; that they looked like people from the Atlantic States ; that the family name was Van Brunt and the child 's name Laura . This was all . The parents had not been seen since the explosion . The child 's manners were those of a little lady , and her clothes were daintier and finer than any Mrs. Hawkins had ever seen before . As the hours dragged on the child lost heart , and cried so piteously for her mother that it seemed to the Hawkinses that the moanings and the wailings of the mutilated men and women in the saloon did not so strain at their heart - strings as the sufferings of this little desolate creature . They tried hard to comfort her ; and in trying , learned to love her ; they could not help it , seeing how she clung , to them and put her arms about their necks and found no solace but in their kind eyes and comforting words : There was a question in both their hearts -- a question that rose up and asserted itself with more and more pertinacity as the hours wore on -- but both hesitated to give it voice -- both kept silence -- and -- waited . But a time came at last when the matter would bear delay no longer . The boat had landed , and the dead and the wounded were being conveyed to the shore . The tired child was asleep in the arms of Mrs. Hawkins . Mr. Hawkins came into their presence and stood without speaking . His eyes met his wife 's ; then both looked at the child -- and as they looked it stirred in its sleep and nestled closer ; an expression of contentment and peace settled upon its face that touched the mother - heart ; and when the eyes of husband and wife met again , the question was asked and answered . When the Boreas had journeyed some four hundred miles from the time the Hawkinses joined her , a long rank of steamboats was sighted , packed side by side at a wharf like sardines , in a box , and above and beyond them rose the domes and steeples and general architectural confusion of a city -- a city with an imposing umbrella of black smoke spread over it . This was St. Louis . The children of the Hawkins family were playing about the hurricane deck , and the father and mother were sitting in the lee of the pilot house essaying to keep order and not greatly grieved that they were not succeeding . “

12907	12927	12890	12890	Nancy	373	” The children had stopped playing , for the moment , and drawn near to listen . Hawkins said : “
12951	12952	12953	12953	I	0	” “
13046	13047	13048	13051	The same old chap!--always	1045	” “
13079	13080	13081	13081	I	0	” “

13225	13660	13217	13219	the Obedstown folk	1054	” A smaller steamboat received the Hawkinses and their fortunes , and bore them a hundred and thirty miles still higher up the Mississippi , and landed them at a little tumble - down village on the Missouri shore in the twilight of a mellow October day . The next morning they harnessed up their team and for two days they wended slowly into the interior through almost roadless and uninhabited forest solitudes . And when for the last time they pitched their tents , metaphorically speaking , it was at the goal of their hopes , their new home . By the muddy roadside stood a new log cabin , one story high -- the store ; clustered in the neighborhood were ten or twelve more cabins , some new , some old . In the sad light of the departing day the place looked homeless enough . Two or three coatless young men sat in front of the store on a dry - goods box , and whittled it with their knives , kicked it with their vast boots , and shot tobacco - juice at various marks . Several ragged negroes leaned comfortably against the posts of the awning and contemplated the arrival of the wayfarers with lazy curiosity . All these people presently managed to drag themselves to the vicinity of the Hawkins ' wagon , and there they took up permanent positions , hands in pockets and resting on one leg ; and thus anchored they proceeded to look and enjoy . Vagrant dogs came wagging around and making inquiries of Hawkins 's dog , which were not satisfactory and they made war on him in concert . This would have interested the citizens but it was too many on one to amount to anything as a fight , and so they commanded the peace and the foreign dog coiled his tail and took sanctuary under the wagon . Slatternly negro girls and women slouched along with pails deftly balanced on their heads , and joined the group and stared . Little half dressed white boys , and little negro boys with nothing whatever on but tow - linen shirts with a fine southern exposure , came from various directions and stood with their hands locked together behind them and aided in the inspection . The rest of the population were laying down their employments and getting ready to come , when a man burst through the assemblage and seized the new - comers by the hands in a frenzy of welcome , and exclaimed -- indeed almost shouted : “
14165	14423	14425	14426	the fellow	1090	” And the Colonel took the lead , with Laura astride his neck , and the newly - inspired and very grateful immigrants picked up their tired limbs with quite a spring in them and dropped into his wake . Presently they were ranged about an old - time fire - place whose blazing logs sent out rather an unnecessary amount of heat , but that was no matter -- supper was needed , and to have it , it had to be cooked . This apartment was the family bedroom , parlor , library and kitchen , all in one . The matronly little wife of the Colonel moved hither and thither and in and out with her pots and pans in her hands , happiness in her heart and a world of admiration of her husband in her eyes . And when at last she had spread the cloth and loaded it with hot corn bread , fried chickens , bacon , buttermilk , coffee , and all manner of country luxuries , Col . Sellers modified his harangue and for a moment throttled it down to the orthodox pitch for a blessing , and then instantly burst forth again as from a parenthesis and clattered on with might and main till every stomach in the party was laden with all it could carry . And when the new - comers ascended the ladder to their comfortable feather beds on the second floor -- to wit the garret -- Mrs. Hawkins was obliged to say : “
14473	14785	14456	14456	they	1091	” Within a week or two the Hawkinses were comfortably domiciled in a new log house , and were beginning to feel at home . The children were put to school ; at least it was what passed for a school in those days : a place where tender young humanity devoted itself for eight or ten hours a day to learning incomprehensible rubbish by heart out of books and reciting it by rote , like parrots ; so that a finished education consisted simply of a permanent headache and the ability to read without stopping to spell the words or take breath . Hawkins bought out the village store for a song and proceeded to reap the profits , which amounted to but little more than another song . The wonderful speculation hinted at by Col . Sellers in his letter turned out to be the raising of mules for the Southern market ; and really it promised very well . The young stock cost but a trifle , the rearing but another trifle , and so Hawkins was easily persuaded to embark his slender means in the enterprise and turn over the keep and care of the animals to Sellers and Uncle Dan'l . All went well : Business prospered little by little . Hawkins even built a new house , made it two full stories high and put a lightning rod on it . People came two or three miles to look at it . But they knew that the rod attracted the lightning , and so they gave the place a wide berth in a storm , for they were familiar with marksmanship and doubted if the lightning could hit that small stick at a distance of a mile and a half oftener than once in a hundred and fifty times . Hawkins fitted out his house with “
14787	14822	15182	15183	Squire ”	6257	” furniture from St. Louis , and the fame of its magnificence went abroad in the land . Even the parlor carpet was from St. Louis -- though the other rooms were clothed in the “
14824	14835	14456	14456	they	1091	” carpeting of the country . Hawkins put up the first “
14837	14948	15182	15183	Squire ”	6257	” fence that had ever adorned the village ; and he did not stop there , but whitewashed it . His oil - cloth window - curtains had noble pictures on them of castles such as had never been seen anywhere in the world but on window - curtains . Hawkins enjoyed the admiration these prodigies compelled , but he always smiled to think how poor and cheap they were , compared to what the Hawkins mansion would display in a future day after the Tennessee Land should have borne its minted fruit . Even Washington observed , once , that when the Tennessee Land was sold he would have a “
14950	15181	15182	15183	Squire ”	6257	” carpet in his and Clay 's room like the one in the parlor . This pleased Hawkins , but it troubled his wife . It did not seem wise , to her , to put one 's entire earthly trust in the Tennessee Land and never think of doing any work . Hawkins took a weekly Philadelphia newspaper and a semi - weekly St. Louis journal -- almost the only papers that came to the village , though Godey 's Lady 's Book found a good market there and was regarded as the perfection of polite literature by some of the ablest critics in the place . Perhaps it is only fair to explain that we are writing of a by gone age -- some twenty or thirty years ago . In the two newspapers referred to lay the secret of Hawkins 's growing prosperity . They kept him informed of the condition of the crops south and east , and thus he knew which articles were likely to be in demand and which articles were likely to be unsalable , weeks and even months in advance of the simple folk about him . As the months went by he came to be regarded as a wonderfully lucky man . It did not occur to the citizens that brains were at the bottom of his luck . His title of “
15183	15214	15215	15215	Judge	1092	” came into vogue again , but only for a season ; for , as his wealth and popularity augmented , that title , by imperceptible stages , grew up into “
15217	15225	15215	15215	Judge	1092	” indeed it bade fair to swell into “
15227	15250	15182	15183	Squire ”	6257	” bye and bye . All strangers of consequence who visited the village gravitated to the Hawkins Mansion and became guests of the “
15253	16113	15182	15183	Squire ”	6257	” Hawkins had learned to like the people of his section very much . They were uncouth and not cultivated , and not particularly industrious ; but they were honest and straightforward , and their virtuous ways commanded respect . Their patriotism was strong , their pride in the flag was of the old fashioned pattern , their love of country amounted to idolatry . Whoever dragged the national honor in the dirt won their deathless hatred . They still cursed Benedict Arnold as if he were a personal friend who had broken faith -- but a week gone by . CHAPTER VI . We skip ten years and this history finds certain changes to record . Judge Hawkins and Col . Sellers have made and lost two or three moderate fortunes in the meantime and are now pinched by poverty . Sellers has two pairs of twins and four extras . In Hawkins 's family are six children of his own and two adopted ones . From time to time , as fortune smiled , the elder children got the benefit of it , spending the lucky seasons at excellent schools in St. Louis and the unlucky ones at home in the chafing discomfort of straightened circumstances . Neither the Hawkins children nor the world that knew them ever supposed that one of the girls was of alien blood and parentage : Such difference as existed between Laura and Emily is not uncommon in a family . The girls had grown up as sisters , and they were both too young at the time of the fearful accident on the Mississippi to know that it was that which had thrown their lives together . And yet any one who had known the secret of Laura 's birth and had seen her during these passing years , say at the happy age of twelve or thirteen , would have fancied that he knew the reason why she was more winsome than her school companion . Philosophers dispute whether it is the promise of what she will be in the careless school - girl , that makes her attractive , the undeveloped maidenhood , or the mere natural , careless sweetness of childhood . If Laura at twelve was beginning to be a beauty , the thought of it had never entered her head . No , indeed . Her mind was filled with more important thoughts . To her simple school - girl dress she was beginning to add those mysterious little adornments of ribbon - knots and ear - rings , which were the subject of earnest consultations with her grown friends . When she tripped down the street on a summer 's day with her dainty hands propped into the ribbon - broidered pockets of her apron , and elbows consequently more or less akimbo with her wide Leghorn hat flapping down and hiding her face one moment and blowing straight up against her fore head the next and making its revealment of fresh young beauty ; with all her pretty girlish airs and graces in full play , and that sweet ignorance of care and that atmosphere of innocence and purity all about her that belong to her gracious time of life , indeed she was a vision to warm the coldest heart and bless and cheer the saddest . Willful , generous , forgiving , imperious , affectionate , improvident , bewitching , in short -- was Laura at this period . Could she have remained there , this history would not need to be written . But Laura had grown to be almost a woman in these few years , to the end of which we have now come -- years which had seen Judge Hawkins pass through so many trials . When the judge 's first bankruptcy came upon him , a homely human angel intruded upon him with an offer of $ 1,500 for the Tennessee Land . Mrs. Hawkins said take it . It was a grievous temptation , but the judge withstood it . He said the land was for the children -- he could not rob them of their future millions for so paltry a sum . When the second blight fell upon him , another angel appeared and offered $ 3,000 for the land . He was in such deep distress that he allowed his wife to persuade him to let the papers be drawn ; but when his children came into his presence in their poor apparel , he felt like a traitor and refused to sign . But now he was down again , and deeper in the mire than ever . He paced the floor all day , he scarcely slept at night . He blushed even to acknowledge it to himself , but treason was in his mind -- he was meditating , at last , the sale of the land . Mrs. Hawkins stepped into the room . He had not spoken a word , but he felt as guilty as if she had caught him in some shameful act . She said : “
16161	16162	16165	16165	Nancy	373	” “
16171	16172	16169	16169	Johnson----	414	” “

16442	16457	16429	16429	I	0	” And she gave way and put her face in her hands and cried . “
16521	16522	16507	16507	somebody	5942	” “
16530	16536	16538	16538	me	0	” said Mrs. Hawkins excitedly . “
16540	16583	16538	16538	me	0	” Mrs. Hawkins was out of the room in a moment . Within a minute she was back again with a business - looking stranger , whom she seated , and then she took her leave again . Hawkins said to himself , “
16635	16640	16641	16641	I	0	” The stranger said : “
16694	16719	16681	16681	they	1116	” Hawkins 's heart bounded within him . His whole frame was racked and wrenched with fettered hurrahs . His first impulse was to shout “
16731	16780	16783	16783	I	0	” But a something flitted through his mind , and his opened lips uttered nothing . The enthusiasm faded away from his eyes , and the look of a man who is thinking took its place . Presently , in a hesitating , undecided way , he said : “
16916	16917	16914	16914	you	980	” “
17028	17038	17074	17074	his	1128	” He was about to rise . Hawkins said , “
17043	17056	17074	17074	his	1128	” Hawkins thought again . And the substance of his thought was : “
17227	17245	17284	17287	this underhanded mercenary creature	1136	” [ here Hawkins got up and began to pace the floor with excited eyes and with gesturing hands]--“something
17314	17325	17326	17326	I	0	” He stopped and turned toward the stranger ; saying : “
17399	17466	17388	17388	I	0	” The stranger looked amused , and there was a pretty well defined touch of surprise in his expression , too , but Hawkins never noticed it . Indeed he scarcely noticed anything or knew what he was about . The man left ; Hawkins flung himself into a chair ; thought a few moments , then glanced around , looked frightened , sprang to the door---- “
17504	17538	17499	17499	I	0	” He plunged his hands into his hair and leaned his elbows on his knees , and fell to rocking himself back and forth in anguish . Mrs. Hawkins sprang in , beaming : “
17543	17544	17541	17541	Si	374	” “
17571	17572	17562	17562	I	0	” “
17581	17582	17575	17575	Si	374	” “
17589	17590	17575	17575	Si	374	” “
17624	17625	17619	17619	he	1139	” “
17637	17638	17628	17628	He	1139	” “
17664	17665	17662	17662	Si	374	” “
17753	17762	17763	17763	You	373	” Mrs. Hawkins looked up white and despairing : “
17794	17795	17788	17788	you	373	” “
17834	17835	17824	17824	he	5852	” “
17872	17886	17858	17858	I	0	” A shade of uneasiness came into Hawkins 's face . He said : “
17902	17903	17893	17893	you	373	” “
17939	17940	17941	17941	Nancy	373	” “
18005	18125	18126	18126	Washington	382	” The next instant he left the house on a run . But the man was no longer in the town . Nobody knew where he belonged or whither he had gone . Hawkins came slowly back , watching wistfully but hopelessly for the stranger , and lowering his price steadily with his sinking heart . And when his foot finally pressed his own threshold , the value he held the entire Tennessee property at was five hundred dollars -- two hundred down and the rest in three equal annual payments , without interest . There was a sad gathering at the Hawkins fireside the next night . All the children were present but Clay . Mr. Hawkins said : “
18207	18251	18278	18278	He	375	” He stopped , and was conscious of a blush . There was silence for a moment , and then Washington -- now a lank , dreamy - eyed stripling between twenty - two and twenty - three years of age -- said : “
18293	18294	18298	18298	he	375	” “
18375	18376	18367	18367	Washington	382	” “
18391	18392	18367	18367	Washington	382	” “
18421	18422	18423	18423	Father	418	” “
18458	18459	18452	18452	you	382	” “
18502	18503	18493	18493	your	382	” “
18533	18534	18529	18529	I	0	” “
18566	18567	18547	18547	you	382	” “
18619	18620	18625	18625	you	382	” “
18632	18633	18625	18625	you	382	” “
18674	18675	18676	18676	Emily	385	” “
18685	18689	18692	18692	sir	980	” said Hawkins . “
18724	18725	18715	18716	Mrs. Buckner	419	” “
18732	18733	18730	18730	child	5824	” “
18758	18759	18751	18751	she	419	” “
18773	18855	18762	18762	Laura	403	” Emily and Laura were about the same age -- between seventeen and eighteen . Emily was fair and pretty , girlish and diffident -- blue eyes and light hair . Laura had a proud bearing , and a somewhat mature look ; she had fine , clean - cut features , her complexion was pure white and contrasted vividly with her black hair and eyes ; she was not what one calls pretty -- she was beautiful . She said : “
18905	18929	18883	18883	I	0	” She spoke it like a princess . Mrs. Hawkins smiled proudly and kissed her , saying in a tone of fond reproof : “
18972	19468	19470	19470	yourself	1178	” The girl 's eyes beamed affection under her mother 's caress . Then she straightened up , folded her white hands in her lap and became a splendid ice - berg . Clay 's dog put up his brown nose for a little attention , and got it . He retired under the table with an apologetic yelp , which did not affect the iceberg . Judge Hawkins had written and asked Clay to return home and consult with him upon family affairs . He arrived the evening after this conversation , and the whole household gave him a rapturous welcome . He brought sadly needed help with him , consisting of the savings of a year and a half of work -- nearly two hundred dollars in money . It was a ray of sunshine which ( to this easy household ) was the earnest of a clearing sky . Bright and early in the morning the family were astir , and all were busy preparing Washington for his journey -- at least all but Washington himself , who sat apart , steeped in a reverie . When the time for his departure came , it was easy to see how fondly all loved him and how hard it was to let him go , notwithstanding they had often seen him go before , in his St. Louis schooling days . In the most matter - of - course way they had borne the burden of getting him ready for his trip , never seeming to think of his helping in the matter ; in the same matter - of - course way Clay had hired a horse and cart ; and now that the good - byes were ended he bundled Washington 's baggage in and drove away with the exile . At Swansea Clay paid his stage fare , stowed him away in the vehicle , and saw him off . Then he returned home and reported progress , like a committee of the whole . Clay remained at home several days . He held many consultations with his mother upon the financial condition of the family , and talked once with his father upon the same subject , but only once . He found a change in that quarter which was distressing ; years of fluctuating fortune had done their work ; each reverse had weakened the father 's spirit and impaired his energies ; his last misfortune seemed to have left hope and ambition dead within him ; he had no projects , formed no plans -- evidently he was a vanquished man . He looked worn and tired . He inquired into Clay 's affairs and prospects , and when he found that Clay was doing pretty well and was likely to do still better , it was plain that he resigned himself with easy facility to look to the son for a support ; and he said , “
19490	20103	19488	19488	Clay	405	” The younger children , also , seemed relieved of all fears and distresses , and very ready and willing to look to Clay for a livelihood . Within three days a general tranquility and satisfaction reigned in the household . Clay 's hundred and eighty or ninety , dollars had worked a wonder . The family were as contented , now , and as free from care as they could have been with a fortune . It was well that Mrs. Hawkins held the purse otherwise the treasure would have lasted but a very little while . It took but a trifle to pay Hawkins 's outstanding obligations , for he had always had a horror of debt . When Clay bade his home good - bye and set out to return to the field of his labors , he was conscious that henceforth he was to have his father 's family on his hands as pensioners ; but he did not allow himself to chafe at the thought , for he reasoned that his father had dealt by him with a free hand and a loving one all his life , and now that hard fortune had broken his spirit it ought to be a pleasure , not a pain , to work for him . The younger children were born and educated dependents . They had never been taught to do anything for themselves , and it did not seem to occur to them to make an attempt now . The girls would not have been permitted to work for a living under any circumstances whatever . It was a southern family , and of good blood ; and for any person except Laura , either within or without the household to have suggested such an idea would have brought upon the suggester the suspicion of being a lunatic . CHAPTER VII . Via , Pecunia ! when she 's run and gone And fled , and dead , then will I fetch her again With aqua vita , out of an old hogshead ! While there are lees of wine , or dregs of beer , I 'll never want her ! Coin her out of cobwebs , Dust , but I 'll have her ! raise wool upon egg - shells , Sir , and make grass grow out of marrow - bones , To make her come ! B. Jonson . Bearing Washington Hawkins and his fortunes , the stage - coach tore out of Swansea at a fearful gait , with horn tooting gaily and half the town admiring from doors and windows . But it did not tear any more after it got to the outskirts ; it dragged along stupidly enough , then -- till it came in sight of the next hamlet ; and then the bugle tooted gaily again and again the vehicle went tearing by the horses . This sort of conduct marked every entry to a station and every exit from it ; and so in those days children grew up with the idea that stage - coaches always tore and always tooted ; but they also grew up with the idea that pirates went into action in their Sunday clothes , carrying the black flag in one hand and pistolling people with the other , merely because they were so represented in the pictures -- but these illusions vanished when later years brought their disenchanting wisdom . They learned then that the stagecoach is but a poor , plodding , vulgar thing in the solitudes of the highway ; and that the pirate is only a seedy , unfantastic “
20106	20197	19488	19488	Clay	405	” when he is out of the pictures . Toward evening , the stage - coach came thundering into Hawkeye with a perfectly triumphant ostentation -- which was natural and proper , for Hawkey a was a pretty large town for interior Missouri . Washington , very stiff and tired and hungry , climbed out , and wondered how he was to proceed now . But his difficulty was quickly solved . Col . Sellers came down the street on a run and arrived panting for breath . He said : “
20740	21061	20716	20716	I	0	” True enough ; but holding on too long had utterly ruined both of them ; and the saddest part of it was , that they never had had so much money to lose before , for Sellers 's sale of their mule crop that year in New Orleans had been a great financial success . If he had kept out of sugar and gone back home content to stick to mules it would have been a happy wisdom . As it was , he managed to kill two birds with one stone -- that is to say , he killed the sugar speculation by holding for high rates till he had to sell at the bottom figure , and that calamity killed the mule that laid the golden egg -- which is but a figurative expression and will be so understood . Sellers had returned home cheerful but empty - handed , and the mule business lapsed into other hands . The sale of the Hawkins property by the Sheriff had followed , and the Hawkins hearts been torn to see Uncle Dan'l and his wife pass from the auction - block into the hands of a negro trader and depart for the remote South to be seen no more by the family . It had seemed like seeing their own flesh and blood sold into banishment . Washington was greatly pleased with the Sellers mansion . It was a two - story - and - a - half brick , and much more stylish than any of its neighbors . He was borne to the family sitting room in triumph by the swarm of little Sellerses , the parents following with their arms about each other 's waists . The whole family were poorly and cheaply dressed ; and the clothing , although neat and clean , showed many evidences of having seen long service . The Colonel 's “
21063	21143	21149	21149	Washington	382	” hat was napless and shiny with much polishing , but nevertheless it had an almost convincing expression about it of having been just purchased new . The rest of his clothing was napless and shiny , too , but it had the air of being entirely satisfied with itself and blandly sorry for other people 's clothes . It was growing rather dark in the house , and the evening air was chilly , too . Sellers said : “
21222	21588	21219	21219	you	1209	” By this time the Colonel was conveying a lighted match into a poor little stove . Then he propped the stove door to its place by leaning the poker against it , for the hinges had retired from business . This door framed a small square of isinglass , which now warmed up with a faint glow . Mrs. Sellers lit a cheap , showy lamp , which dissipated a good deal of the gloom , and then everybody gathered into the light and took the stove into close companionship . The children climbed all over Sellers , fondled him , petted him , and were lavishly petted in return . Out from this tugging , laughing , chattering disguise of legs and arms and little faces , the Colonel 's voice worked its way and his tireless tongue ran blithely on without interruption ; and the purring little wife , diligent with her knitting , sat near at hand and looked happy and proud and grateful ; and she listened as one who listens to oracles and , gospels and whose grateful soul is being refreshed with the bread of life . Bye and bye the children quieted down to listen ; clustered about their father , and resting their elbows on his legs , they hung upon his words as if he were uttering the music of the spheres . A dreary old hair - cloth sofa against the wall ; a few damaged chairs ; the small table the lamp stood on ; the crippled stove -- these things constituted the furniture of the room . There was no carpet on the floor ; on the wall were occasional square - shaped interruptions of the general tint of the plaster which betrayed that there used to be pictures in the house -- but there were none now . There were no mantel ornaments , unless one might bring himself to regard as an ornament a clock which never came within fifteen strokes of striking the right time , and whose hands always hitched together at twenty - two minutes past anything and traveled in company the rest of the way home . “
21592	21603	21604	21604	I	0	” said Sellers , and got up and wound it . “
21821	21854	21858	21858	her	1019	” Washington hoped that this might be true , for the din was distracting -- though the family , one and all , seemed filled with joy ; and the more the clock “
21860	21906	21910	21911	his grandmother	1222	” as the Colonel expressed it , and the more insupportable the clatter became , the more enchanted they all appeared to be . When there was silence , Mrs Sellers lifted upon Washington a face that beamed with a childlike pride , and said : “
21913	21944	21910	21911	his grandmother	1222	” The look and the tone were a plain call for admiring surprise , and therefore Washington said ( it was the only thing that offered itself at the moment :) “
21947	21948	21981	21981	she	1019	” “
21959	21966	21957	21957	father	6129	” exclaimed one of the twins . “
22032	22087	22030	22030	father	6129	” All the children chimed in , now , with one general Babel of information about deceased -- nobody offering to read the riot act or seeming to discountenance the insurrection or disapprove of it in any way -- but the head twin drowned all the turmoil and held his own against the field : “
22255	22459	22464	22464	my	0	” But Sellers began to speak now , and the storm ceased . He began to tell about an enormous speculation he was thinking of embarking some capital in -- a speculation which some London bankers had been over to consult with him about -- and soon he was building glittering pyramids of coin , and Washington was presently growing opulent under the magic of his eloquence . But at the same time Washington was not able to ignore the cold entirely . He was nearly as close to the stove as he could get , and yet he could not persuade himself that he felt the slightest heat , notwithstanding the isinglass ' door was still gently and serenely glowing . He tried to get a trifle closer to the stove , and the consequence was , he tripped the supporting poker and the stove - door tumbled to the floor . And then there was a revelation -- there was nothing in the stove but a lighted tallow - candle ! The poor youth blushed and felt as if he must die with shame . But the Colonel was only disconcerted for a moment -- he straightway found his voice again : “
22779	23288	23289	23289	I	0	” Washington said with his blue lips that he would , but he said in his secret heart that he would promote no such iniquity . He tried to believe in the healthfulness of the invention , and succeeded tolerably well ; but after all he could not feel that good health in a frozen body was any real improvement on the rheumatism . CHAPTER VIII . --Whan pe horde is thynne , as of seruyse , Nought replenesshed with grete diuersite Of mete & amp ; drinke , good chere may then suffise With honest talkyng---- The Book of Curtesye . MAMMON . Come on , sir . Now , you set your foot on shore In Novo Orbe ; here 's the rich Peru : And there within , sir , are the golden mines , Great Solomon 's Ophir!---- B. Jonson The supper at Col . Sellers 's was not sumptuous , in the beginning , but it improved on acquaintance . That is to say , that what Washington regarded at first sight as mere lowly potatoes , presently became awe - inspiring agricultural productions that had been reared in some ducal garden beyond the sea , under the sacred eye of the duke himself , who had sent them to Sellers ; the bread was from corn which could be grown in only one favored locality in the earth and only a favored few could get it ; the Rio coffee , which at first seemed execrable to the taste , took to itself an improved flavor when Washington was told to drink it slowly and not hurry what should be a lingering luxury in order to be fully appreciated -- it was from the private stores of a Brazilian nobleman with an unrememberable name . The Colonel 's tongue was a magician 's wand that turned dried apples into figs and water into wine as easily as it could change a hovel into a palace and present poverty into imminent future riches . Washington slept in a cold bed in a carpetless room and woke up in a palace in the morning ; at least the palace lingered during the moment that he was rubbing his eyes and getting his bearings -- and then it disappeared and he recognized that the Colonel 's inspiring talk had been influencing his dreams . Fatigue had made him sleep late ; when he entered the sitting room he noticed that the old hair - cloth sofa was absent ; when he sat down to breakfast the Colonel tossed six or seven dollars in bills on the table , counted them over , said he was a little short and must call upon his banker ; then returned the bills to his wallet with the indifferent air of a man who is used to money . The breakfast was not an improvement upon the supper , but the Colonel talked it up and transformed it into an oriental feast . Bye and bye , he said : “
23583	23592	23578	23581	quiet men at work	1263	” [ he was very impressive here , ] “
23773	23774	23776	23776	Colonel	406	” “
23785	23793	23776	23776	Colonel	406	” said Washington , his eyes blazing . “
23939	23966	23925	23925	you	1066	” A sweet , compassionate smile played about the Colonel 's features , and he leaned over the table with the air of a man who is “
23971	23980	23925	23925	you	1066	” and do it without the least trouble : “
24106	24121	24128	24128	I	0	” Washington nodded three or four times impatiently , and his glowing eyes said , “
24130	24131	24128	24128	I	0	” ----“for
24169	24181	24143	24143	They	1280	” [ voice down to an impressive whisper , now , ] “
24287	24304	24307	24307	your	1066	” [ An eloquent pause , while the marvelous vision settled into W. 's focus . ] “
24335	24344	24373	24373	they	1293	” Washington finally got his breath and said : “
24401	24402	24373	24373	they	1293	” “
24431	24461	24428	24428	you	382	” In the presence of so many millions , Washington could not keep from blushing when he had to confess that he had but eighteen dollars in the world . “
24666	24818	24826	24826	Washington	382	“ The first year sell , say , ten thousand bottles in Missouri , seven thousand in Iowa , three thousand in Arkansas , four thousand in Kentucky , six thousand in Illinois , and say twenty - five thousand in the rest of the country . Total , fifty five thousand bottles ; profit clear of all expenses , twenty thousand dollars at the very lowest calculation . All the capital needed is to manufacture the first two thousand bottles -- say a hundred and fifty dollars -- then the money would begin to flow in . The second year , sales would reach 200,000 bottles -- clear profit , say , $ 75,000 - -and in the meantime the great factory would be building in St. Louis , to cost , say , $ 100,000 . The third year we could easily sell 1,000,000 bottles in the United States and---- ”
24819	24824	24826	24826	Washington	382	“ O , splendid ! ”
24828	24836	24826	24826	Washington	382	“ Let 's commence right away -- let's---- ”
24837	24871	24826	24826	Washington	382	“ ----1,000,000 bottles in the United States -- profit at least $ 350,000 - -and then it would begin to be time to turn our attention toward the real idea of the business . ”
24872	24888	24826	24826	Washington	382	“ The real idea of it ! Ai n't $ 350,000 a year a pretty real---- ”
24889	25240	25241	25241	Washington	382	“ Stuff ! Why what an infant you are , Washington -- what a guileless , short - sighted , easily - contented innocent you are , my poor little country - bred know - nothing ! Would I go to all that trouble and bother for the poor crumbs a body might pick up in this country ? Now do I look like a man who----does my history suggest that I am a man who deals in trifles , contents himself with the narrow horizon that hems in the common herd , sees no further than the end of his nose ? Now you know that that is not me -- couldn't be me . You ought to know that if I throw my time and abilities into a patent medicine , it 's a patent medicine whose field of operations is the solid earth ! its clients the swarming nations that inhabit it ! Why what is the republic of America for an eye - water country ? Lord bless you , it is nothing but a barren highway that you 've got to cross to get to the true eye - water market ! Why , Washington , in the Oriental countries people swarm like the sands of the desert ; every square mile of ground upholds its thousands upon thousands of struggling human creatures -- and every separate and individual devil of them 's got the ophthalmia ! It 's as natural to them as noses are -- and sin . It 's born with them , it stays with them , it 's all that some of them have left when they die . Three years of introductory trade in the orient and what will be the result ? Why , our headquarters would be in Constantinople and our hindquarters in Further India ! Factories and warehouses in Cairo , Ispahan , Bagdad , Damascus , Jerusalem , Yedo , Peking , Bangkok , Delhi , Bombay -- and Calcutta ! Annual income -- well , God only knows how many millions and millions apiece ! ”

This money will not be for me , alone , but for all of us . I want all to share alike ; and there is going to be far more for each than one person can spend . Break it to father cautiously -- you understand the need of that -- break it to him cautiously , for he has had such cruel hard fortune , and is so stricken by it that great good news might prostrate him more surely than even bad , for he is used to the bad but is grown sadly unaccustomed to the other . Tell Laura -- tell all the children . And write to Clay about it if he is not with you yet . You may tell Clay that whatever I get he can freely share in - freely . He knows that that is true -- there will be no need that I should swear to that to make him believe it . Good - bye -- and mind what I say : Rest perfectly easy , one and all of you , for our troubles are nearly at an end . ”

29709	29760	29661	29661	he	444	“ He seems entirely alone in the world , and his heart is so wrapped up in this thing that I believe that if it proved a false hope , it would kill him ; I have persuaded him to wait a little while and go west when I go . ”
29769	30167	29661	29661	he	444	“ He is better one day and worse the next , and is out of his mind a good deal of the time . Lately his case has developed a something which is a wonder to the hired nurses , but which will not be much of a marvel to you if you have read medical philosophy much . It is this : his lost memory returns to him when he is delirious , and goes away again when he is himself - just as old Canada Joe used to talk the French patois of his boyhood in the delirium of typhus fever , though he could not do it when his mind was clear . Now this poor gentleman 's memory has always broken down before he reached the explosion of the steamer ; he could only remember starting up the river with his wife and child , and he had an idea that there was a race , but he was not certain ; he could not name the boat he was on ; there was a dead blank of a month or more that supplied not an item to his recollection . It was not for me to assist him , of course . But now in his delirium it all comes out : the names of the boats , every incident of the explosion , and likewise the details of his astonishing escape -- that is , up to where , just as a yawl - boat was approaching him ( he was clinging to the starboard wheel of the burning wreck at the time ) , a falling timber struck him on the head . But I will write out his wonderful escape in full to - morrow or next day . Of course the physicians will not let me tell him now that our Laura is indeed his child -- that must come later , when his health is thoroughly restored . His case is not considered dangerous at all ; he will recover presently , the doctors say . But they insist that he must travel a little when he gets well -- they recommend a short sea voyage , and they say he can be persuaded to try it if we continue to keep him in ignorance and promise to let him see L. as soon as he returns . ”
30182	30310	29661	29661	he	444	“ It is the most unaccountable thing in the world ; the mystery remains as impenetrable as ever ; I have hunted high and low for him , and inquired of everybody , but in vain ; all trace of him ends at that hotel in New York ; I never have seen or heard of him since , up to this day ; he could hardly have sailed , for his name does not appear upon the books of any shipping office in New York or Boston or Baltimore . How fortunate it seems , now , that we kept this thing to ourselves ; Laura still has a father in you , and it is better for her that we drop this subject here forever . ”

I think she is a fine girl every way , and so would you if you knew her as well as I do ; but you know how it is when a girl once gets talked about -- it 's all up with her -- the world wo n't ever let her alone , after that . ”

He is prosperous , too , I hear ; has been a doctor a year , now , and has had two patients -- no , three , I think ; yes , it was three . I attended their funerals . Well , other people have hoped and been disappointed ; I am not alone in that . I wish you could stay to dinner , Maria -- we are going to have sausages ; and besides , I wanted to talk to you about Hawkeye and make you promise to come and see us when we are settled there . ”

You ca n't please us any better than that , Washington ; the little woman will tell you so herself . We do n't pretend to style . Plain folks , you know -- plain folks . Just a plain family dinner , but such as it is , our friends are always welcome , I reckon you know that yourself , Washington . Run along , children , run along ; Lafayette,--[**In those old days the average man called his children after his most revered literary and historical idols ; consequently there was hardly a family , at least in the West , but had a Washington in it -- and also a Lafayette , a Franklin , and six or eight sounding names from Byron , Scott , and the Bible , if the offspring held out . To visit such a family , was to find one 's self confronted by a congress made up of representatives of the imperial myths and the majestic dead of all the ages . There was something thrilling about it , to a stranger , not to say awe inspiring.]--stand off the cat 's tail , child , ca n't you see what you 're doing?--Come , come , come , Roderick Dhu , it is n't nice for little boys to hang onto young gentlemen 's coat tails -- but never mind him , Washington , he 's full of spirits and do n't mean any harm . Children will be children , you know . Take the chair next to Mrs. Sellers , Washington -- tut , tut , Marie Antoinette , let your brother have the fork if he wants it , you are bigger than he is . ”

32928	33200	33201	33201	Washington	382	“ Let me help you , Washington -- Lafayette , pass this plate to Washington -- ah , well , well , my boy , things are looking pretty bright , now , I tell you . Speculation -- my ! the whole atmosphere 's full of money . I would'nt take three fortunes for one little operation I 've got on hand now -- have anything from the casters ? No ? Well , you 're right , you 're right . Some people like mustard with turnips , but -- now there was Baron Poniatowski -- Lord , but that man did know how to live!--true Russian you know , Russian to the back bone ; I say to my wife , give me a Russian every time , for a table comrade . The Baron used to say , ' Take mustard , Sellers , try the mustard,--a man ca n't know what turnips are in perfection without , mustard , ' but I always said , ' No , Baron , I 'm a plain man and I want my food plain -- none of your embellishments for Beriah Sellers -- no made dishes for me ! And it 's the best way -- high living kills more than it cures in this world , you can rest assured of that.--Yes indeed , Washington , I 've got one little operation on hand that -- take some more water -- help yourself , wo n't you?--help yourself , there 's plenty of it.--You'll find it pretty good , I guess . How does that fruit strike you ? ”
33254	33421	33237	33237	he	382	“ I thought you 'd like them . Examine them -- examine them -- they'll bear it . See how perfectly firm and juicy they are -- they ca n't start any like them in this part of the country , I can tell you . These are from New Jersey -- I imported them myself . They cost like sin , too ; but lord bless me , I go in for having the best of a thing , even if it does cost a little more -- it 's the best economy , in the long run . These are the Early Malcolm -- it 's a turnip that ca n't be produced except in just one orchard , and the supply never is up to the demand . Take some more water , Washington -- you ca n't drink too much water with fruit -- all the doctors say that . The plague ca n't come where this article is , my boy ! ”
33422	33428	33214	33214	He	382	“ Plague ? What plague ? ”
33429	33449	33237	33237	he	382	“ What plague , indeed ? Why the Asiatic plague that nearly depopulated London a couple of centuries ago . ”
33450	33467	33237	33237	he	382	“ But how does that concern us ? There is no plague here , I reckon . ”
33468	33751	33214	33214	He	382	“ Sh ! I 've let it out ! Well , never mind -- just keep it to yourself . Perhaps I ought n't said anything , but its bound to come out sooner or later , so what is the odds ? Old McDowells would n't like me to -- to -- bother it all , I 'll jest tell the whole thing and let it go . You see , I 've been down to St. Louis , and I happened to run across old Dr. McDowells -- thinks the world of me , does the doctor . He 's a man that keeps himself to himself , and well he may , for he knows that he 's got a reputation that covers the whole earth -- he wo n't condescend to open himself out to many people , but lord bless you , he and I are just like brothers ; he wo n't let me go to a hotel when I 'm in the city -- says I 'm the only man that 's company to him , and I do n't know but there 's some truth in it , too , because although I never like to glorify myself and make a great to - do over what I am or what I can do or what I know , I do n't mind saying here among friends that I am better read up in most sciences , maybe , than the general run of professional men in these days . Well , the other day he let me into a little secret , strictly on the quiet , about this matter of the plague . “
34024	34050	34018	34022	a fighting cock next day	1524	” Fifteen or twenty minutes later the Colonel 's tongue was still chattering away -- he had piled up several future fortunes out of several incipient “
34052	34159	34018	34022	a fighting cock next day	1524	” which he had blundered into within the past week , and was now soaring along through some brilliant expectations born of late promising experiments upon the lacking ingredient of the eye - water . And at such a time Washington ought to have been a rapt and enthusiastic listener , but he was not , for two matters disturbed his mind and distracted his attention . One was , that he discovered , to his confusion and shame , that in allowing himself to be helped a second time to the turnips , he had robbed those hungry children . He had not needed the dreadful “
34162	34243	34018	34022	a fighting cock next day	1524	” and had not wanted it ; and when he saw the pathetic sorrow in their faces when they asked for more and there was no more to give them , he hated himself for his stupidity and pitied the famishing young things with all his heart . The other matter that disturbed him was the dire inflation that had begun in his stomach . It grew and grew , it became more and more insupportable . Evidently the turnips were “
34246	34544	34018	34022	a fighting cock next day	1524	” He forced himself to sit still as long as he could , but his anguish conquered him at last . He rose in the midst of the Colonel 's talk and excused himself on the plea of a previous engagement . The Colonel followed him to the door , promising over and over again that he would use his influence to get some of the Early Malcolms for him , and insisting that he should not be such a stranger but come and take pot - luck with him every chance he got . Washington was glad enough to get away and feel free again . He immediately bent his steps toward home . In bed he passed an hour that threatened to turn his hair gray , and then a blessed calm settled down upon him that filled his heart with gratitude . Weak and languid , he made shift to turn himself about and seek rest and sleep ; and as his soul hovered upon the brink of unconciousness , he heaved a long , deep sigh , and said to himself that in his heart he had cursed the Colonel 's preventive of rheumatism , before , and now let the plague come if it must -- he was done with preventives ; if ever any man beguiled him with turnips and water again , let him die the death . If he dreamed at all that night , no gossiping spirit disturbed his visions to whisper in his ear of certain matters just then in bud in the East , more than a thousand miles away that after the lapse of a few years would develop influences which would profoundly affect the fate and fortunes of the Hawkins family . CHAPTER XII . “
34556	34560	34018	34022	a fighting cock next day	1524	” Henry said . “
34575	34579	34570	34570	I	0	” replied Philip . “
34601	34619	34590	34590	You	0	” If there be any place and time in the world where and when it seems easy to “
34623	35144	35145	35145	he	1526	” it is in Broadway on a spring morning , when one is walking city - ward , and has before him the long lines of palace - shops with an occasional spire seen through the soft haze that lies over the lower town , and hears the roar and hum of its multitudinous traffic . To the young American , here or elsewhere , the paths to fortune are innumerable and all open ; there is invitation in the air and success in all his wide horizon . He is embarrassed which to choose , and is not unlikely to waste years in dallying with his chances , before giving himself to the serious tug and strain of a single object . He has no traditions to bind him or guide him , and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed , and make a new way for himself . Philip Sterling used to say that if he should seriously set himself for ten years to any one of the dozen projects that were in his brain , he felt that he could be a rich man . He wanted to be rich , he had a sincere desire for a fortune , but for some unaccountable reason he hesitated about addressing himself to the narrow work of getting it . He never walked Broadway , a part of its tide of abundant shifting life , without feeling something of the flush of wealth , and unconsciously taking the elastic step of one well - to - do in this prosperous world . Especially at night in the crowded theatre -- Philip was too young to remember the old Chambers ' Street box , where the serious Burton led his hilarious and pagan crew -- in the intervals of the screaming comedy , when the orchestra scraped and grunted and tooted its dissolute tunes , the world seemed full of opportunities to Philip , and his heart exulted with a conscious ability to take any of its prizes he chose to pluck . Perhaps it was the swimming ease of the acting , on the stage , where virtue had its reward in three easy acts , perhaps it was the excessive light of the house , or the music , or the buzz of the excited talk between acts , perhaps it was youth which believed everything , but for some reason while Philip was at the theatre he had the utmost confidence in life and his ready victory in it . Delightful illusion of paint and tinsel and silk attire , of cheap sentiment and high and mighty dialogue ! Will there not always be rosin enough for the squeaking fiddle - bow ? Do we not all like the maudlin hero , who is sneaking round the right entrance , in wait to steal the pretty wife of his rich and tyrannical neighbor from the paste - board cottage at the left entrance ? and when he advances down to the foot - lights and defiantly informs the audience that , “
35160	35784	35145	35145	he	1526	” do we not all applaud so as to drown the rest of the sentence ? Philip never was fortunate enough to hear what would become of a man who should lay his hand on a woman with the exception named ; but he learned afterwards that the woman who lays her hand on a man , without any exception whatsoever , is always acquitted by the jury . The fact was , though Philip Sterling did not know it , that he wanted several other things quite as much as he wanted wealth . The modest fellow would have liked fame thrust upon him for some worthy achievement ; it might be for a book , or for the skillful management of some great newspaper , or for some daring expedition like that of Lt . Strain or Dr. Kane . He was unable to decide exactly what it should be . Sometimes he thought he would like to stand in a conspicuous pulpit and humbly preach the gospel of repentance ; and it even crossed his mind that it would be noble to give himself to a missionary life to some benighted region , where the date - palm grows , and the nightingale 's voice is in tune , and the bul - bul sings on the off nights . If he were good enough he would attach himself to that company of young men in the Theological Seminary , who were seeing New York life in preparation for the ministry . Philip was a New England boy and had graduated at Yale ; he had not carried off with him all the learning of that venerable institution , but he knew some things that were not in the regular course of study . A very good use of the English language and considerable knowledge of its literature was one of them ; he could sing a song very well , not in time to be sure , but with enthusiasm ; he could make a magnetic speech at a moment 's notice in the class room , the debating society , or upon any fence or dry - goods box that was convenient ; he could lift himself by one arm , and do the giant swing in the gymnasium ; he could strike out from his left shoulder ; he could handle an oar like a professional and pull stroke in a winning race . Philip had a good appetite , a sunny temper , and a clear hearty laugh . He had brown hair , hazel eyes set wide apart , a broad but not high forehead , and a fresh winning face . He was six feet high , with broad shoulders , long legs and a swinging gait ; one of those loose - jointed , capable fellows , who saunter into the world with a free air and usually make a stir in whatever company they enter . After he left college Philip took the advice of friends and read law . Law seemed to him well enough as a science , but he never could discover a practical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law , and all the clients who stopped with this new clerk in the ante - room of the law office where he was writing , Philip invariably advised to settle -- no matter how , but settle -- greatly to the disgust of his employer , who knew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized processes , with the attendant fees . Besides Philip hated the copying of pleadings , and he was certain that a life of “
35786	35788	35148	35148	his	1526	” and “
35790	36231	35148	35148	his	1526	” and whipping the devil round the stump , would be intolerable . [ Note : these few paragraphs are nearly an autobiography of the life of Charles Dudley Warner whose contributions to the story start here with Chapter XII . D.W. ] His pen therefore , and whereas , and not as aforesaid , strayed off into other scribbling . In an unfortunate hour , he had two or three papers accepted by first - class magazines , at three dollars the printed page , and , behold , his vocation was open to him . He would make his mark in literature . Life has no moment so sweet as that in which a young man believes himself called into the immortal ranks of the masters of literature . It is such a noble ambition , that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow foundation . At the time of this history , Philip had gone to New York for a career . With his talent he thought he should have little difficulty in getting an editorial position upon a metropolitan newspaper ; not that he knew anything about newspaper work , or had the least idea of journalism ; he knew he was not fitted for the technicalities of the subordinate departments , but he could write leaders with perfect ease , he was sure . The drudgery of the newspaper office was too distasteful , and besides it would be beneath the dignity of a graduate and a successful magazine writer . He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder . To his surprise he found that every situation in the editorial department of the journals was full , always had been full , was always likely to be full . It seemed to him that the newspaper managers did n't want genius , but mere plodding and grubbing . Philip therefore read diligently in the Astor library , planned literary works that should compel attention , and nursed his genius . He had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the Dorking Convention , then in session , make a sketch of the men and women on the platform , and take it to the editor of the Daily Grapevine , and see what he could get a line for it . One day he had an offer from some country friends , who believed in him , to take charge of a provincial daily newspaper , and he went to consult Mr. Gringo -- Gringo who years ago managed the Atlas -- about taking the situation . “
36237	36241	35148	35148	his	1526	” says Gringo , “
36250	36251	36253	36253	they	1528	” “
36263	36264	36253	36253	they	1528	” “
36287	36288	36289	36289	I	0	” “
36295	36301	36253	36253	they	1528	” said Philip , stoutly , “
36332	36333	36326	36326	I	0	” “
36339	36351	36326	36326	I	0	” said Gringo , turning away with a shade of contempt , “
36374	36670	36671	36671	Philip	646	” But Philip did afford it , and he wrote , thanking his friends , and declining because he said the political scheme would fail , and ought to fail . And he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world . It was in this time of rather impatient waiting that Philip was one morning walking down Broadway with Henry Brierly . He frequently accompanied Henry part way down town to what the latter called his office in Broad Street , to which he went , or pretended to go , with regularity every day . It was evident to the most casual acquaintance that he was a man of affairs , and that his time was engrossed in the largest sort of operations , about which there was a mysterious air . His liability to be suddenly summoned to Washington , or Boston or Montreal or even to Liverpool was always imminent . He never was so summoned , but none of his acquaintances would have been surprised to hear any day that he had gone to Panama or Peoria , or to hear from him that he had bought the Bank of Commerce . The two were intimate at that time,--they had been classmates -- and saw a great deal of each other . Indeed , they lived together in Ninth Street , in a boarding - house , there , which had the honor of lodging and partially feeding several other young fellows of like kidney , who have since gone their several ways into fame or into obscurity . It was during the morning walk to which reference has been made that Henry Brierly suddenly said , “
36683	36684	36685	36685	I	0	” “
36695	36703	36685	36685	I	0	” replied Philip , with some hesitation , “
36708	36709	36685	36685	I	0	” “
36761	36762	36748	36748	I	0	” “

36861	36862	36909	36909	engineer	1545	” “
36912	36913	36906	36906	We	1542	” “
36919	36932	36906	36906	We	1542	” was Philip 's next question , after some moments of silence . “
36942	36943	36906	36906	We	1542	” “
37014	37217	37255	37255	I	0	” The two young men who were by this time full of the adventure , went down to the Wall street office of Henry 's uncle and had a talk with that wily operator . The uncle knew Philip very well , and was pleased with his frank enthusiasm , and willing enough to give him a trial in the western venture . It was settled therefore , in the prompt way in which things are settled in New York , that they would start with the rest of the company next morning for the west . On the way up town these adventurers bought books on engineering , and suits of India - rubber , which they supposed they would need in a new and probably damp country , and many other things which nobody ever needed anywhere . The night was spent in packing up and writing letters , for Philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends . If they disapprove , thought he , I 've done my duty by letting them know . Happy youth , that is ready to pack its valise , and start for Cathay on an hour 's notice . “
37222	37235	37255	37255	I	0	” calls out Philip from his bed - room , to Henry , “
37242	37243	37255	37255	I	0	” “
37264	37265	37258	37258	We	1548	” “
37286	38167	37278	37278	I	0	” Philip wrote a long letter , first of all , to his mother , full of love and glowing anticipations of his new opening . He would n't bother her with business details , but he hoped that the day was not far off when she would see him return , with a moderate fortune , and something to add to the comfort of her advancing years . To his uncle he said that he had made an arrangement with some New York capitalists to go to Missouri , in a land and railroad operation , which would at least give him a knowledge of the world and not unlikely offer him a business opening . He knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter . It was to Ruth Bolton that Philip wrote last . He might never see her again ; he went to seek his fortune . He well knew the perils of the frontier , the savage state of society , the lurking Indians and the dangers of fever . But there was no real danger to a person who took care of himself . Might he write to her often and , tell her of his life . If he returned with a fortune , perhaps and perhaps . If he was unsuccessful , or if he never returned -- perhaps it would be as well . No time or distance , however , would ever lessen his interest in her . He would say good - night , but not good - bye . In the soft beginning of a Spring morning , long before New York had breakfasted , while yet the air of expectation hung about the wharves of the metropolis , our young adventurers made their way to the Jersey City railway station of the Erie road , to begin the long , swinging , crooked journey , over what a writer of a former day called a causeway of cracked rails and cows , to the West . CHAPTER XIII . What ever to say be toke in his entente , his langage was so fayer & amp ; pertynante , yt semeth unto manys herying not only the worde , but veryly the thyng . Caxton 's Book of Curtesye . In the party of which our travelers found themselves members , was Duff Brown , the great railroad contractor , and subsequently a well - known member of Congress ; a bluff , jovial Bost'n man , thick - set , close shaven , with a heavy jaw and a low forehead -- a very pleasant man if you were not in his way . He had government contracts also , custom houses and dry docks , from Portland to New Orleans , and managed to get out of congress , in appropriations , about weight for weight of gold for the stone furnished . Associated with him , and also of this party , was Rodney Schaick , a sleek New York broker , a man as prominent in the church as in the stock exchange , dainty in his dress , smooth of speech , the necessary complement of Duff Brown in any enterprise that needed assurance and adroitness . It would be difficult to find a pleasanter traveling party , one that shook off more readily the artificial restraints of Puritanic strictness , and took the world with good - natured allowance . Money was plenty for every attainable luxury , and there seemed to be no doubt that its supply would continue , and that fortunes were about to be made without a great deal of toil . Even Philip soon caught the prevailing spirit ; Barry did not need any inoculation , he always talked in six figures . It was as natural for the dear boy to be rich as it is for most people to be poor . The elders of the party were not long in discovering the fact , which almost all travelers to the west soon find out ; that the water was poor . It must have been by a lucky premonition of this that they all had brandy flasks with which to qualify the water of the country ; and it was no doubt from an uneasy feeling of the danger of being poisoned that they kept experimenting , mixing a little of the dangerous and changing fluid , as they passed along , with the contents of the flasks , thus saving their lives hour by hour . Philip learned afterwards that temperance and the strict observance of Sunday and a certain gravity of deportment are geographical habits , which people do not usually carry with them away from home . Our travelers stopped in Chicago long enough to see that they could make their fortunes there in two week 's time , but it did not seem worth while ; the west was more attractive ; the further one went the wider the opportunities opened . They took railroad to Alton and the steamboat from there to St. Louis , for the change and to have a glimpse of the river . “
38173	38210	37278	37278	I	0	” cried Henry , dancing out of the barber 's room , and coming down the deck with a one , two , three step , shaven , curled and perfumed after his usual exquisite fashion . “
38215	38237	37278	37278	I	0	” asked Philip , looking out upon the dreary and monotonous waste through which the shaking steamboat was coughing its way . “
38271	38272	38252	38252	I	0	” “
38278	38279	38280	38280	He	467	” “
38322	38323	38313	38320	the big Delegate to Congress from out west	1553	” “
38357	38358	38373	38374	the Delegate	1558	” “
38377	38378	38373	38374	the Delegate	1558	” “
38398	38399	38373	38374	the Delegate	1558	” “
38464	38465	38456	38456	He	1558	” “
38484	38488	38489	38489	Harry	393	” added Philip . “
38491	38499	38489	38489	Harry	393	” said Philip , after a pause , “
38517	38518	38519	38519	I	0	” “
38525	38856	38519	38519	I	0	” The fact was Harry had got himself up in what he thought a proper costume for a new country , and was in appearance a sort of compromise between a dandy of Broadway and a backwoodsman . Harry , with blue eyes , fresh complexion , silken whiskers and curly chestnut hair , was as handsome as a fashion plate . He wore this morning a soft hat , a short cutaway coat , an open vest displaying immaculate linen , a leathern belt round his waist , and top - boots of soft leather , well polished , that came above his knees and required a string attached to his belt to keep them up . The light hearted fellow gloried in these shining encasements of his well shaped legs , and told Philip that they were a perfect protection against prairie rattle - snakes , which never strike above the knee . The landscape still wore an almost wintry appearance when our travelers left Chicago . It was a genial spring day when they landed at St. Louis ; the birds were singing , the blossoms of peach trees in city garden plots , made the air sweet , and in the roar and tumult on the long river levee they found an excitement that accorded with their own hopeful anticipations . The party went to the Southern Hotel , where the great Duff Brown was very well known , and indeed was a man of so much importance that even the office clerk was respectful to him . He might have respected in him also a certain vulgar swagger and insolence of money , which the clerk greatly admired . The young fellows liked the house and liked the city ; it seemed to them a mighty free and hospitable town . Coming from the East they were struck with many peculiarities . Everybody smoked in the streets , for one thing , they noticed ; everybody “
38860	39195	39441	39442	the court	1217	” in an open manner whenever he wished to do so or was asked , as if the habit needed no concealment or apology . In the evening when they walked about they found people sitting on the door - steps of their dwellings , in a manner not usual in a northern city ; in front of some of the hotels and saloons the side walks were filled with chairs and benches -- Paris fashion , said Harry -- upon which people lounged in these warm spring evenings , smoking , always smoking ; and the clink of glasses and of billiard balls was in the air . It was delightful . Harry at once found on landing that his back - woods custom would not be needed in St. Louis , and that , in fact , he had need of all the resources of his wardrobe to keep even with the young swells of the town . But this did not much matter , for Harry was always superior to his clothes . As they were likely to be detained some time in the city , Harry told Philip that he was going to improve his time . And he did . It was an encouragement to any industrious man to see this young fellow rise , carefully dress himself , eat his breakfast deliberately , smoke his cigar tranquilly , and then repair to his room , to what he called his work , with a grave and occupied manner , but with perfect cheerfulness . Harry would take off his coat , remove his cravat , roll up his shirt - sleeves , give his curly hair the right touch before the glass , get out his book on engineering , his boxes of instruments , his drawing paper , his profile paper , open the book of logarithms , mix his India ink , sharpen his pencils , light a cigar , and sit down at the table to “
39201	39350	39441	39442	the court	1217	” with the most grave notion that he was mastering the details of engineering . He would spend half a day in these preparations without ever working out a problem or having the faintest conception of the use of lines or logarithms . And when he had finished , he had the most cheerful confidence that he had done a good day 's work . It made no difference , however , whether Harry was in his room in a hotel or in a tent , Philip soon found , he was just the same . In camp he would get himself up in the most elaborate toilet at his command , polish his long boots to the top , lay out his work before him , and spend an hour or longer , if anybody was looking at him , humming airs , knitting his brows , and “
39352	39376	39377	39377	You	1565	” at engineering ; and if a crowd of gaping rustics were looking on all the while it was perfectly satisfactory to him . “
39380	39396	39377	39377	You	1565	” he says to Philip one morning at the hotel when he was thus engaged , “
39418	39419	39420	39420	I	0	” “
39431	39435	39422	39422	you	1565	” queried Philip . “
39543	39544	39545	39545	I	0	” “
39555	39565	39545	39545	I	0	” continued Larry , in a burst of generosity , “
39657	39658	39640	39640	Schaick	468	” “
39668	39669	39640	39640	Schaick	468	” “
39764	39765	39769	39769	you	1565	” “
39773	39796	39769	39769	you	1565	” asked Philip , to whom a salary of two thousand would have seemed wealth , before he started on this journey . “
39809	39927	39800	39800	I	0	” said Harry , in his most airy manner . A few evenings after their arrival at the Southern , Philip and Harry made the acquaintance of a very agreeable gentleman , whom they had frequently seen before about the hotel corridors , and passed a casual word with . He had the air of a man of business , and was evidently a person of importance . The precipitating of this casual intercourse into the more substantial form of an acquaintanceship was the work of the gentleman himself , and occurred in this wise . Meeting the two friends in the lobby one evening , he asked them to give him the time , and added : “
39972	40139	39969	39970	Beriah Sellers	375	“ Ah ! by the way -- New York , did you say ? That reminds me ; just met some gentlemen from your State , a week or two ago -- very prominent gentlemen -- in public life they are ; you must know them , without doubt . Let me see -- let me see . Curious those names have escaped me . I know they were from your State , because I remember afterward my old friend Governor Shackleby said to me -- fine man , is the Governor -- one of the finest men our country has produced -- said he , ' Colonel , how did you like those New York gentlemen?--not many such men in the world,--Colonel Sellers , ' said the Governor -- yes , it was New York he said -- I remember it distinctly . I ca n't recall those names , somehow . But no matter . Stopping here , gentlemen -- stopping at the Southern ? ”
40150	40152	39969	39970	Beriah Sellers	375	“ Mr. ”
40170	40172	40175	40175	their	1587	“ Colonel ”
40198	40267	40268	40268	Philip	646	“ Yes , yes , the Southern is fair . I myself go to the Planter 's , old , aristocratic house . We Southern gentlemen do n't change our ways , you know . I always make it my home there when I run down from Hawkeye -- my plantation is in Hawkeye , a little up in the country . You should know the Planter 's . ”
40311	40328	40330	40331	the three	1592	“ You may believe it , sir , an uncommonly pleasant lodging . Shall we walk ? ”
40362	40445	40624	40624	he	6205	“ Yes , born East myself , raised all along , know the West -- a great country , gentlemen . The place for a young fellow of spirit to pick up a fortune , simply pick it up , it 's lying round loose here . Not a day that I do n't put aside an opportunity ; too busy to look into it . Management of my own property takes my time . First visit ? Looking for an opening ? ”
40446	40452	40454	40454	Harry	393	“ Yes , looking around , ”
40456	40483	40454	40454	Harry	393	“ Ah , here we are . You 'd rather sit here in front than go to my apartments ? So had I. An opening eh ? ”
40490	40549	40454	40454	Harry	393	“ Ah , just so . The country is opening up , all we want is capital to develop it . Slap down the rails and bring the land into market . The richest land on God Almighty 's footstool is lying right out there . If I had my capital free I could plant it for millions . ”
40550	40561	40563	40563	Philip	646	“ I suppose your capital is largely in your plantation ? ”
40565	40607	40563	40563	Philip	646	“ Well , partly , sir , partly . I 'm down here now with reference to a little operation -- a little side thing merely . By the way gentlemen , excuse the liberty , but it 's about my usual time”--
40632	40649	40624	40624	he	6205	“ I 'm rather particular about the exact time -- have to be in this climate . ”
40666	40674	40661	40662	the Colonel	6205	“ Gentlemen , will you take something ? ”
40703	40707	40709	40710	the Colonel	6205	“ Not that , ”
40742	40746	40732	40732	he	1604	“ not that , ”
40754	40790	40791	40793	The hospitable gentleman	1605	“ That Otard if you please . Yes . Never take an inferior liquor , gentlemen , not in the evening , in this climate . There . That 's the stuff . My respects ! ”
40808	40829	40732	40732	he	1604	thing--“when a man has his own cellar to go to , he is apt to get a little fastidious about his liquors”--called
40861	40896	40842	40842	he	1605	“ I always smoke this sort , gentlemen ; they are a little more expensive , but you 'll learn , in this climate , that you 'd better not economize on poor cigars . ”
40980	41033	40954	40954	he	6205	“ By George , that 's annoying . By George , that 's mortifying . Never had anything of that kind happen to me before . I 've left my pocket - book . Hold ! Here 's a bill , after all . No , thunder , it 's a receipt . ”
41034	41038	41040	41040	Philip	646	“ Allow me , ”
41073	41078	41059	41059	he	6205	“ hanging it up , ”
41108	41115	41099	41101	Col . Sellers	375	“ next time , next time . ”
41557	41560	41550	41551	her mother	6128	“ Ruth ? ”
41561	41566	41568	41570	the young student	1638	“ Well , mother , ”
41581	41594	41568	41570	the young student	1638	“ I wanted to talk with thee a little about thy plans . ”
41595	41625	41550	41551	her mother	6128	“ Mother ; thee knows I could n't stand it at Westfield ; the school stifled me , it 's a place to turn young people into dried fruit . ”
41626	41630	41632	41633	Margaret Bolton	476	“ I know , ”
41641	41663	41632	41633	Margaret Bolton	476	“ thee chafes against all the ways of Friends , but what will thee do ? Why is thee so discontented ? ”
41664	41687	41550	41551	her mother	6128	“ If I must say it , mother , I want to go away , and get out of this dead level . ”
41703	41766	41699	41700	her mother	6128	“ I am sure thee is little interfered with ; thee dresses as thee will , and goes where thee pleases , to any church thee likes , and thee has music . I had a visit yesterday from the society 's committee by way of discipline , because we have a piano in the house , which is against the rules . ”
41767	41851	41699	41700	her mother	6128	“ I hope thee told the elders that father and I are responsible for the piano , and that , much as thee loves music , thee is never in the room when it is played . Fortunately father is already out of meeting , so they ca n't discipline him . I heard father tell cousin Abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now . ”
41852	41901	41979	41979	Ruth	439	“ Thy ways greatly try me , Ruth , and all thy relations . I desire thy happiness first of all , but thee is starting out on a dangerous path . Is thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world 's people ? ”
41902	41909	41910	41910	Ruth	439	“ I have not asked him , ”
41947	41978	41979	41979	Ruth	439	“ And when thee has got the education thee wants , and lost all relish for the society of thy friends and the ways of thy ancestors , what then ? ”
42002	42012	41979	41979	Ruth	439	“ Mother , I 'm going to study medicine ? ”
42024	42067	42013	42014	Margaret Bolton	476	“ Thee , study medicine ! A slight frail girl like thee , study medicine ! Does thee think thee could stand it six months ? And the lectures , and the dissecting rooms , has thee thought of the dissecting rooms ? ”
42068	42071	42073	42073	Ruth	443	“ Mother , ”
42076	42123	42073	42073	Ruth	443	“ I have thought it all over . I know I can go through the whole , clinics , dissecting room and all . Does thee think I lack nerve ? What is there to fear in a person dead more than in a person living ? ”
42124	42151	42013	42014	Margaret Bolton	476	“ But thy health and strength , child ; thee can never stand the severe application . And , besides , suppose thee does learn medicine ? ”
42152	42158	42013	42014	Margaret Bolton	476	“ I will practice it . ”
42159	42162	42073	42073	Ruth	443	“ Here ? ”
42163	42166	42013	42014	Margaret Bolton	476	“ Here . ”
42167	42176	42013	42014	Margaret Bolton	476	“ Where thee and thy family are known ? ”
42177	42184	42013	42014	Margaret Bolton	476	“ If I can get patients . ”
42185	42204	42221	42221	she	6128	“ I hope at least , Ruth , thee will let us know when thee opens an office , ”
42512	42523	42525	42528	one of the girls	6276	“ Is thee going to the Yearly Meeting , Ruth ? ”
42530	42537	42539	42541	that demure person	1670	“ I have nothing to wear , ”
42543	42631	42539	42541	that demure person	1670	“ If thee wants to see new bonnets , orthodox to a shade and conformed to the letter of the true form , thee must go to the Arch Street Meeting . Any departure from either color or shape would be instantly taken note of . It has occupied mother a long time , to find at the shops the exact shade for her new bonnet . Oh , thee must go by all means . But thee wo n't see there a sweeter woman than mother . ”
42632	42639	42746	42746	her	443	“ And thee wo n't go ? ”
42640	42741	42539	42541	that demure person	1670	“ Why should I ? I 've been again and again . If I go to Meeting at all I like best to sit in the quiet old house in Germantown , where the windows are all open and I can see the trees , and hear the stir of the leaves . It 's such a crush at the Yearly Meeting at Arch Street , and then there 's the row of sleek - looking young men who line the curbstone and stare at us as we come out . No , I do n't feel at home there . ”
42775	42784	42786	42787	Eli Bolton	479	“ Thee has another letter from young Sterling , ”
42789	42800	42786	42787	Eli Bolton	479	“ Yes . Philip has gone to the far west . ”
42801	42805	42746	42746	her	443	“ How far ? ”
42806	42845	42539	42541	that demure person	1670	“ He does n't say , but it 's on the frontier , and on the map everything beyond it is marked ' Indians ' and ' desert , ' and looks as desolate as a Wednesday Meeting . ”
42846	42874	42786	42787	Eli Bolton	479	“ Humph . It was time for him to do something . Is he going to start a daily newspaper among the Kick - a - poos ? ”
42875	42890	42746	42746	her	443	“ Father , thee 's unjust to Philip . He 's going into business . ”
42891	42905	42539	42541	that demure person	1670	“ What sort of business can a young man go into without capital ? ”
42906	42916	42918	42918	Ruth	443	“ He does n't say exactly what it is , ”
42923	42953	42918	42918	Ruth	443	“ but it 's something about land and railroads , and thee knows , father , that fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how , in a new country . ”
42954	43031	42539	42541	that demure person	1670	“ I should think so , you innocent puss , and in an old one too . But Philip is honest , and he has talent enough , if he will stop scribbling , to make his way . But thee may as well take care of theeself , Ruth , and not go dawdling along with a young man in his adventures , until thy own mind is a little more settled what thee wants . ”
43073	43135	43064	43064	she	443	“ I wish I could go west , or south , or somewhere . What a box women are put into , measured for it , and put in young ; if we go anywhere it 's in a box , veiled and pinioned and shut in by disabilities . Father , I should like to break things and get loose ! ”
43150	43180	43064	43064	she	443	“ Thee will no doubt break things enough when thy time comes , child ; women always have ; but what does thee want now that thee has n't ? ”

What would happen to me if thee should lose thy property and die ? What one useful thing could I do for a living , for the support of mother and the children ? And if I had a fortune , would thee want me to lead a useless life ? ”
43268	43277	43064	43064	she	443	“ Has thy mother led a useless life ? ”
43278	43290	43064	43064	she	443	“ Somewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything , ”

Thee has trained her thyself at home , in her enfeebled childhood , and thee knows how strong her will is , and what she has been able to accomplish in self - culture by the simple force of her determination . She never will be satisfied until she has tried her own strength . ”

43947	44003	43936	43936	Margaret	476	“ that she were in the way to fall in love and marry by and by . I think that would cure her of some of her notions . I am not sure but if she went away , to some distant school , into an entirely new life , her thoughts would be diverted . ”
44027	44069	44009	44009	he	479	“ Perhaps thee remembers that thee had notions also , before we were married , and before thee became a member of Meeting . I think Ruth comes honestly by certain tendencies which thee has hidden under the Friend 's dress . ”

44114	44164	44112	44112	Eli	479	“ there is a fair beginning of a Woman 's Medical College in the city . Quite likely she will soon find that she needs first a more general culture , and fall in with thy wish that she should see more of the world at some large school . ”

Then get the towns on the line to issue their bonds for stock , and sell their bonds for enough to complete the road , and partly stock it , especially if we mortgage each section as we complete it . We can then sell the rest of the stock on the prospect of the business of the road through an improved country , and also sell the lands at a big advance , on the strength of the road . All we want , ”

44941	45027	45029	45030	the contractor	1718	“ Why , yes , Miss , of course , in a great enterprise for the benefit of the community there will little things occur , which , which -- and , of course , the poor ought to be looked to ; I tell my wife , that the poor must be looked to ; if you can tell who are poor -- there 's so many impostors . And then , there 's so many poor in the legislature to be looked after , ”

45251	45310	45201	45201	Ruth	443	“ O , child , thee must n't be too observing . Mr. Bigler is one of the most important men in the state ; nobody has more influence at Harrisburg . I do n't like him any more than thee does , but I 'd better lend him a little money than to have his ill will . ”
45311	45357	45201	45201	Ruth	443	“ Father , I think thee'd better have his ill - will than his company . Is it true that he gave money to help build the pretty little church of St. James the Less , and that he is , one of the vestrymen ? ”
45358	45421	45201	45201	Ruth	443	“ Yes . He is not such a bad fellow . One of the men in Third street asked him the other day , whether his was a high church or a low church ? Bigler said he did n't know ; he 'd been in it once , and he could touch the ceiling in the side aisle with his hand . ”

56200	56232	56245	56245	he	6205	“ George , how can you joke so cruelly ? I will go any where with you . I will wait any where . I ca n't go back to Hawkeye . ”
56233	56243	56245	56245	he	6205	“ Well , go where you like . Perhaps , ”
56250	56264	56270	56270	She	403	“ you would do as well to wait here , for another colonel . ”
56276	56287	56294	56295	the officer	2215	“ What does this mean ? Where are you going ? ”
56288	56292	56294	56295	the officer	2215	“ It means , ”
56301	56323	56270	56270	She	403	“ that you have n't anything to show for a legal marriage , and that I am going to New Orleans . ”
56324	56354	56365	56365	Laura	403	“ It 's a lie , George , it 's a lie . I am your wife . I shall go . I shall follow you to New Orleans . ”

56802	56810	57165	57165	Harry	506	“ KEEP OUT OF HERE , SIR ! ”
57160	57163	57165	57165	Harry	506	“ Gad , ”
57170	57217	57269	57269	he	6205	“ she 's a superb creature , she 'd make a stir in New York , money or no money . There are men I know would give her a railroad or an opera house , or whatever she wanted -- at least they 'd promise . ”
57272	57325	57532	57533	the Colonel	6205	“ No nonsense , Mr. Brierly . Nonsense wo n't do in Hawkeye , not with my friends . The Hawkins ' blood is good blood , all the way from Tennessee . The Hawkinses are under the weather now , but their Tennessee property is millions when it comes into market . ”
57326	57520	57532	57533	the Colonel	6205	“ Of course , Colonel . Not the least offense intended . But you can see she is a fascinating woman . I was only thinking , as to this appropriation , now , what such a woman could do in Washington . All correct , too , all correct . Common thing , I assure you in Washington ; the wives of senators , representatives , cabinet officers , all sorts of wives , and some who are not wives , use their influence . You want an appointment ? Do you go to Senator X ? Not much . You get on the right side of his wife . Is it an appropriation ? You 'd go straight to the Committee , or to the Interior office , I suppose ? You 'd learn better than that . It takes a woman to get any thing through the Land Office : I tell you , Miss Laura would fascinate an appropriation right through the Senate and the House of Representatives in one session , if she was in Washington , as your friend , Colonel , of course as your friend . ”
57521	57530	57537	57537	Harry	393	“ Would you have her sign our petition ? ”
57540	57591	57836	57836	he	393	“ Women do n't get anything by petitioning Congress ; nobody does , that 's for form . Petitions are referred somewhere , and that 's the last of them ; you ca n't refer a handsome woman so easily , when she is present . They prefer 'em mostly . ”
57831	57835	57850	57850	he	6205	“ too visionary , ”
57859	57919	58673	58673	she	403	“ He 's got his plans , sir . God bless my soul , at his age , I was full of plans . But experience sobers a man , I never touch any thing now that has n't been weighed in my judgment ; and when Beriah Sellers puts his judgment on a thing , there it is . ”

58695	58700	58702	58703	that martyr	2310	“ Oh , yes , ”
58707	58731	58673	58673	she	403	“ it 's all well enough , if you do n't have too much of it , but it only has one object . ”
58732	58737	58702	58703	that martyr	2310	“ What is that ? ”
58738	58777	58801	58801	Laura	403	“ If a woman does n't know , it 's useless to tell her . What do you suppose I am staying in Hawkeye for , week after week , when I ought to be with my corps ? ”
58778	58799	58801	58801	Laura	403	“ I suppose it 's your business with Col . Sellers about Napoleon , you 've always told me so , ”
58812	58834	58840	58840	Laura	403	“ And now I tell you that is all arranged , I suppose you 'll tell me I ought to go ? ”
58835	58838	58840	58840	Laura	403	“ Harry ! ”
58855	58874	58885	58885	Harry	393	“ Why should I want you to go away ? The only person in Hawkeye who understands me . ”
58875	58883	58885	58885	Harry	393	“ But you refuse to understand me , ”
58892	58904	58958	58958	she	403	“ You are like an iceberg , when we are alone . ”
58942	58956	59083	59083	Harry	393	“ Did I ever show any want of confidence in you , Harry ? ”
59073	59082	59083	59083	Harry	393	“ You should be a winter in Washington , ”
59086	59094	59034	59034	Laura	403	“ But I have no acquaintances there . ”
59095	59118	59083	59083	Harry	393	“ Do n't know any of the families of the congressmen ? They like to have a pretty woman staying with them . ”
59119	59123	59083	59083	Harry	393	“ Not one . ”
59124	59143	59149	59149	Laura	403	“ Suppose Col . Sellers should , have business there ; say , about this Columbus River appropriation ? ”
59144	59147	59149	59149	Laura	403	“ Sellers ! ”
59152	59250	59257	59257	Laura	403	“ You need n't laugh . Queerer things have happened . Sellers knows everybody from Missouri , and from the West , too , for that matter . He 'd introduce you to Washington life quick enough . It does n't need a crowbar to break your way into society there as it does in Philadelphia . It 's democratic , Washington is . Money or beauty will open any door . If I were a handsome woman , I should n't want any better place than the capital to pick up a prince or a fortune . ”
59251	59255	59257	59257	Laura	403	“ Thank you , ”
59259	59276	59378	59378	he	375	“ But I prefer the quiet of home , and the love of those I know ; ”
59405	59707	60115	60115	she	2327	“ Well , maybe . If the people of Napoleon want me to go to Washington , and look after that matter , I might tear myself from my home . It 's been suggested to me , but -- not a word of it to Mrs. Sellers and the children . Maybe they would n't like to think of their father in Washington . But Dilworthy , Senator Dilworthy , says to me , ' Colonel , you are the man , you could influence more votes than any one else on such a measure , an old settler , a man of the people , you know the wants of Missouri ; you 've a respect for religion too , says he , and know how the cause of the gospel goes with improvements : Which is true enough , Miss Laura , and has n't been enough thought of in connection with Napoleon . He 's an able man , Dilworthy , and a good man . A man has got to be good to succeed as he has . He 's only been in Congress a few years , and he must be worth a million . First thing in the morning when he stayed with me he asked about family prayers , whether we had 'em before or after breakfast . I hated to disappoint the Senator , but I had to out with it , tell him we did n't have 'em , not steady . He said he understood , business interruptions and all that , some men were well enough without , but as for him he never neglected the ordinances of religion . He doubted if the Columbus River appropriation would succeed if we did not invoke the Divine Blessing on it . ”
60104	60114	60140	60140	she	2327	“ We shall see you again , Mr. Sterling , ”
60176	60179	60382	60383	the Colonel	6205	“ Ruth . ”
60372	60380	60382	60383	the Colonel	6205	“ You are known here , sir , ”
60385	60448	60602	60602	he	478	“ and Hawkeye is proud of you . You will find every door open , and a welcome at every hearthstone . I should insist upon your going to my house , if you were not claimed by your older friend Gen. Boswell . But you will mingle with our people , and you will see here developments that will surprise you . ”
60598	60601	60602	60602	he	478	“ Providence , ”
60605	60639	60651	60653	Col . Sellers	439	“ has placed them in our hands , and although you and I , General , might have chosen a different destiny for them , under the Constitution , yet Providence knows best . ”
60640	60649	60651	60653	Col . Sellers	439	“ You ca n't do much with 'em , ”
60655	60702	60602	60602	he	478	“ They are a speculating race , sir , disinclined to work for white folks without security , planning how to live by only working for themselves . Idle , sir , there 's my garden just a ruin of weeds . Nothing practical in 'em . ”
60703	60720	60602	60602	he	478	“ There is some truth in your observation , Colonel , but you must educate them . ”
60721	60756	60651	60653	Col . Sellers	439	“ You educate the niggro and you make him more speculating than he was before . If he wo n't stick to any industry except for himself now , what will he do then ? ”
60757	60776	60602	60602	he	478	“ But , Colonel , the negro when educated will be more able to make his speculations fruitful . ”
60777	60823	60829	60830	the Senator	7173	“ Never , sir , never . He would only have a wider scope to injure himself . A niggro has no grasp , sir . Now , a white man can conceive great operations , and carry them out ; a niggro ca n't . ”
60824	60827	60829	60830	the Senator	7173	“ Still , ”
60832	60885	60896	60897	the Colonel	6205	“ granting that he might injure himself in a worldly point of view , his elevation through education would multiply his chances for the hereafter -- which is the important thing after all , Colonel . And no matter what the result is , we must fulfill our duty by this being . ”
60886	60893	60896	60897	the Colonel	6205	“ I 'd elevate his soul , ”
60899	60942	61047	61047	he	7173	“ that 's just it ; you ca n't make his soul too immortal , but I would n't touch him , himself . Yes , sir ! make his soul immortal , but do n't disturb the niggro as he is . ”
61063	61066	61126	61126	He	7173	“ Order ! ”
61132	61214	61126	61126	He	7173	“ Fellow citizens : It gives me great pleasure to thus meet and mingle with you , to lay aside for a moment the heavy duties of an official and burdensome station , and confer in familiar converse with my friends in your great state . The good opinion of my fellow citizens of all sections is the sweetest solace in all my anxieties . I look forward with longing to the time when I can lay aside the cares of office-- ”
61216	61220	61126	61126	He	7173	“ dam sight , ”
61231	61236	61126	61126	He	7173	“ put him out . ”
61238	61361	61423	61423	he	7173	“ My friends , do not remove him . Let the misguided man stay . I see that he is a victim of that evil which is swallowing up public virtue and sapping the foundation of society . As I was saying , when I can lay down the cares of office and retire to the sweets of private life in some such sweet , peaceful , intelligent , wide - awake and patriotic place as Hawkeye ( applause ) . I have traveled much , I have seen all parts of our glorious union , but I have never seen a lovelier village than yours , or one that has more signs of commercial and industrial and religious prosperity--(more applause ) . ”
61418	61422	61423	61423	he	7173	“ I trust , ”
61426	61438	61446	61447	the Senator	7173	“ that there are children within the sound of my voice , ”
61453	61482	61567	61568	the Senator	7173	“ the genius of American Liberty , walking with the Sunday School in one hand and Temperance in the other up the glorified steps of the National Capitol . ”
61575	61580	61592	61593	the Colonel	6205	“ Is this Napoleon ? ”
61581	61590	61592	61593	the Colonel	6205	“ This is the nucleus , the nucleus , ”
61599	61615	61567	61568	the Senator	7173	“ Here is the deepo , the church , the City Hall and so on . ”
61616	61634	61662	61663	the citizens	6194	“ Ah , I see . How far from here is Columbus River ? Does that stream empty---- ”
61635	61658	61662	61663	the citizens	6194	“ That , why , that 's Goose Run . Thar ai n't no Columbus , thout'n it 's over to Hawkeye , ”
61675	61692	61699	61700	the Colonel	6205	“ A railroad come here last summer , but it haint been here no mo ' . ”
61693	61698	61699	61700	the Colonel	6205	“ Yes , sir , ”
61705	61782	61699	61700	the Colonel	6205	“ in the old records Columbus River is called Goose Run . You see how it sweeps round the town -- forty - nine miles to the Missouri ; sloop navigation all the way pretty much drains this whole country ; when it 's improved steamboats will run right up here . It 's got to be enlarged , deepened . You see by the map . Columbus River . This country must have water communication ! ”
61783	61795	61804	61804	your	0	“ You 'll want a considerable appropriation , Col . Sellers . “
61809	61810	61699	61700	the Colonel	6205	” “
61816	61820	61844	61844	I	0	” said Harry , “
61842	61843	61844	61844	I	0	” “
61847	61852	61961	61961	You	2403	” nodded the Senator . “
61885	61960	61961	61961	You	2403	” The Senator , himself , to do him justice , was not very much interested in the country or the stream , but he favored the appropriation , and he gave the Colonel and Mr. Brierly to understand that he would endeavor to get it through . Harry , who thought he was shrewd and understood Washington , suggested an interest . But he saw that the Senator was wounded by the suggestion . “
61971	61975	62318	62318	I	0	” he said . “
62024	62317	62318	62318	I	0	” This aspect of the subject was not again alluded to . The Senator possessed himself of the facts , not from his observation of the ground , but from the lips of Col . Sellers , and laid the appropriation scheme away among his other plans for benefiting the public . It was on this visit also that the Senator made the acquaintance of Mr. Washington Hawkins , and was greatly taken with his innocence , his guileless manner and perhaps with his ready adaptability to enter upon any plan proposed . Col . Sellers was pleased to see this interest that Washington had awakened , especially since it was likely to further his expectations with regard to the Tennessee lands ; the Senator having remarked to the Colonel , that he delighted to help any deserving young man , when the promotion of a private advantage could at the same time be made to contribute to the general good . And he did not doubt that this was an opportunity of that kind . The result of several conferences with Washington was that the Senator proposed that he should go to Washington with him and become his private secretary and the secretary of his committee ; a proposal which was eagerly accepted . The Senator spent Sunday in Hawkeye and attended church . He cheered the heart of the worthy and zealous minister by an expression of his sympathy in his labors , and by many inquiries in regard to the religious state of the region . It was not a very promising state , and the good man felt how much lighter his task would be , if he had the aid of such a man as Senator Dilworthy . “
62328	62333	62566	62568	an old fool	2413	” said the Senator , “
62382	62565	62566	62568	an old fool	2413	” The good man could not but be a little flattered , and if sometimes , thereafter , in his discouraging work , he allowed the thought that he might perhaps be called to Washington as chaplain of the Senate , to cheer him , who can wonder . The Senator 's commendation at least did one service for him , it elevated him in the opinion of Hawkeye . Laura was at church alone that day , and Mr. Brierly walked home with her . A part of their way lay with that of General Boswell and Senator Dilworthy , and introductions were made . Laura had her own reasons for wishing to know the Senator , and the Senator was not a man who could be called indifferent to charms such as hers . That meek young lady so commended herself to him in the short walk , that he announced his intentions of paying his respects to her the next day , an intention which Harry received glumly ; and when the Senator was out of hearing he called him “
62570	62571	62566	62568	an old fool	2413	” “
62574	62578	62595	62595	He	2414	” said Laura , “
62606	63006	63028	63028	he	2418	” The Senator did call next day , and the result of his visit was that he was confirmed in his impression that there was something about him very attractive to ladies . He saw Laura again and again during his stay , and felt more and more the subtle influence of her feminine beauty , which every man felt who came near her . Harry was beside himself with rage while the Senator remained in town ; he declared that women were always ready to drop any man for higher game ; and he attributed his own ill - luck to the Senator 's appearance . The fellow was in fact crazy about her beauty and ready to beat his brains out in chagrin . Perhaps Laura enjoyed his torment , but she soothed him with blandishments that increased his ardor , and she smiled to herself to think that he had , with all his protestations of love , never spoken of marriage . Probably the vivacious fellow never had thought of it . At any rate when he at length went away from Hawkeye he was no nearer it . But there was no telling to what desperate lengths his passion might not carry him . Laura bade him good bye with tender regret , which , however , did not disturb her peace or interfere with her plans . The visit of Senator Dilworthy had become of more importance to her , and it by and by bore the fruit she longed for , in an invitation to visit his family in the National Capital during the winter session of Congress . CHAPTER XXI . O lift your natures up : Embrace our aims : work out your freedom . Girls , Knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed ; Drink deep until the habits of the slave , The sins of emptiness , gossip and spite And slander , die . The Princess . Whether medicine is a science , or only an empirical method of getting a living out of the ignorance of the human race , Ruth found before her first term was over at the medical school that there were other things she needed to know quite as much as that which is taught in medical books , and that she could never satisfy her aspirations without more general culture . “
63037	63044	63056	63056	he	2418	” once asked an old practitioner . “
63062	64197	63056	63056	he	2418	” The close application to her special study was beginning to tell upon Ruth 's delicate health also , and the summer brought with it only weariness and indisposition for any mental effort . In this condition of mind and body the quiet of her home and the unexciting companionship of those about her were more than ever tiresome . She followed with more interest Philip 's sparkling account of his life in the west , and longed for his experiences , and to know some of those people of a world so different from here , who alternately amused and displeased him . He at least was learning the world , the good and the bad of it , as must happen to every one who accomplishes anything in it . But what , Ruth wrote , could a woman do , tied up by custom , and cast into particular circumstances out of which it was almost impossible to extricate herself ? Philip thought that he would go some day and extricate Ruth , but he did not write that , for he had the instinct to know that this was not the extrication she dreamed of , and that she must find out by her own experience what her heart really wanted . Philip was not a philosopher , to be sure , but he had the old fashioned notion , that whatever a woman 's theories of life might be , she would come round to matrimony , only give her time . He could indeed recall to mind one woman -- and he never knew a nobler -- whose whole soul was devoted and who believed that her life was consecrated to a certain benevolent project in singleness of life , who yielded to the touch of matrimony , as an icicle yields to a sunbeam . Neither at home nor elsewhere did Ruth utter any complaint , or admit any weariness or doubt of her ability to pursue the path she had marked out for herself . But her mother saw clearly enough her struggle with infirmity , and was not deceived by either her gaiety or by the cheerful composure which she carried into all the ordinary duties that fell to her . She saw plainly enough that Ruth needed an entire change of scene and of occupation , and perhaps she believed that such a change , with the knowledge of the world it would bring , would divert Ruth from a course for which she felt she was physically entirely unfitted . It therefore suited the wishes of all concerned , when autumn came , that Ruth should go away to school . She selected a large New England Seminary , of which she had often heard Philip speak , which was attended by both sexes and offered almost collegiate advantages of education . Thither she went in September , and began for the second time in the year a life new to her . The Seminary was the chief feature of Fallkill , a village of two to three thousand inhabitants . It was a prosperous school , with three hundred students , a large corps of teachers , men and women , and with a venerable rusty row of academic buildings on the shaded square of the town . The students lodged and boarded in private families in the place , and so it came about that while the school did a great deal to support the town , the town gave the students society and the sweet influences of home life . It is at least respectful to say that the influences of home life are sweet . Ruth 's home , by the intervention of Philip , was in a family -- one of the rare exceptions in life or in fiction -- that had never known better days . The Montagues , it is perhaps well to say , had intended to come over in the Mayflower , but were detained at Delft Haven by the illness of a child . They came over to Massachusetts Bay in another vessel , and thus escaped the onus of that brevet nobility under which the successors of the Mayflower Pilgrims have descended . Having no factitious weight of dignity to carry , the Montagues steadily improved their condition from the day they landed , and they were never more vigorous or prosperous than at the date of this narrative . With character compacted by the rigid Puritan discipline of more than two centuries , they had retained its strength and purity and thrown off its narrowness , and were now blossoming under the generous modern influences . Squire Oliver Montague , a lawyer who had retired from the practice of his profession except in rare cases , dwelt in a square old fashioned New England mansion a quarter of a mile away from the green . It was called a mansion because it stood alone with ample fields about it , and had an avenue of trees leading to it from the road , and on the west commanded a view of a pretty little lake with gentle slopes and nodding were now blossoming under the generous modern influences . But it was just a plain , roomy house , capable of extending to many guests an unpretending hospitality . The family consisted of the Squire and his wife , a son and a daughter married and not at home , a son in college at Cambridge , another son at the Seminary , and a daughter Alice , who was a year or more older than Ruth . Having only riches enough to be able to gratify reasonable desires , and yet make their gratifications always a novelty and a pleasure , the family occupied that just mean in life which is so rarely attained , and still more rarely enjoyed without discontent . If Ruth did not find so much luxury in the house as in her own home , there were evidences of culture , of intellectual activity and of a zest in the affairs of all the world , which greatly impressed her . Every room had its book - cases or book - shelves , and was more or less a library ; upon every table was liable to be a litter of new books , fresh periodicals and daily newspapers . There were plants in the sunny windows and some choice engravings on the walls , with bits of color in oil or water - colors ; the piano was sure to be open and strewn with music ; and there were photographs and little souvenirs here and there of foreign travel . An absence of any “
64201	64457	63056	63056	he	2418	” in the corners with rows of cheerful shells , and Hindoo gods , and Chinese idols , and nests of useless boxes of lacquered wood , might be taken as denoting a languidness in the family concerning foreign missions , but perhaps unjustly . At any rate the life of the world flowed freely into this hospitable house , and there was always so much talk there of the news of the day , of the new books and of authors , of Boston radicalism and New York civilization , and the virtue of Congress , that small gossip stood a very poor chance . All this was in many ways so new to Ruth that she seemed to have passed into another world , in which she experienced a freedom and a mental exhilaration unknown to her before . Under this influence she entered upon her studies with keen enjoyment , finding for a time all the relaxation she needed , in the charming social life at the Montague house . It is strange , she wrote to Philip , in one of her occasional letters , that you never told me more about this delightful family , and scarcely mentioned Alice who is the life of it , just the noblest girl , unselfish , knows how to do so many things , with lots of talent , with a dry humor , and an odd way of looking at things , and yet quiet and even serious often -- one of your “
64459	64636	64640	64641	Philip Sterling	646	” New England girls . We shall be great friends . It had never occurred to Philip that there was any thing extraordinary about the family that needed mention . He knew dozens of girls like Alice , he thought to himself , but only one like Ruth . Good friends the two girls were from the beginning . Ruth was a study to Alice ; the product of a culture entirely foreign to her experience , so much a child in some things , so much a woman in others ; and Ruth in turn , it must be confessed , probing Alice sometimes with her serious grey eyes , wondered what her object in life was , and whether she had any purpose beyond living as she now saw her . For she could scarcely conceive of a life that should not be devoted to the accomplishment of some definite work , and she had no doubt that in her own case everything else would yield to the professional career she had marked out . “
64643	64672	64694	64694	He	646	” said Ruth one day as the girls sat at their sewing . Ruth never embroidered , and never sewed when she could avoid it . Bless her . “
64703	64704	64694	64694	He	646	” “
64707	64708	64748	64748	he	646	” “
64761	64762	64764	64764	you	2427	” “
64770	64771	64778	64778	he	646	” “
64783	64789	64808	64808	He	646	” replied Alice looking up . “
64826	64827	64808	64808	He	646	” “
64835	64839	64848	64848	I	0	” pursued Ruth , “
64846	64847	64919	64919	I	0	” “
64924	65316	65723	65724	Philip Sterling	646	” The fact was that Alice was a person who invited confidences , because she never betrayed them , and gave abundant sympathy in return . There are persons , whom we all know , to whom human confidences , troubles and heart - aches flow as naturally as streams to a placid lake . This is not a history of Fallkill , nor of the Montague family , worthy as both are of that honor , and this narrative can not be diverted into long loitering with them . If the reader visits the village to - day , he will doubtless be pointed out the Montague dwelling , where Ruth lived , the cross - lots path she traversed to the Seminary , and the venerable chapel with its cracked bell . In the little society of the place , the Quaker girl was a favorite , and no considerable social gathering or pleasure party was thought complete without her . There was something in this seemingly transparent and yet deep character , in her childlike gaiety and enjoyment of the society about her , and in her not seldom absorption in herself , that would have made her long remembered there if no events had subsequently occurred to recall her to mind . To the surprise of Alice , Ruth took to the small gaieties of the village with a zest of enjoyment that seemed foreign to one who had devoted her life to a serious profession from the highest motives . Alice liked society well enough , she thought , but there was nothing exciting in that of Fallkill , nor anything novel in the attentions of the well - bred young gentlemen one met in it . It must have worn a different aspect to Ruth , for she entered into its pleasures at first with curiosity , and then with interest and finally with a kind of staid abandon that no one would have deemed possible for her . Parties , picnics , rowing - matches , moonlight strolls , nutting expeditions in the October woods,--Alice declared that it was a whirl of dissipation . The fondness of Ruth , which was scarcely disguised , for the company of agreeable young fellows , who talked nothings , gave Alice opportunity for no end of banter . “
65328	65722	65726	65727	Henry Brierly	393	” she would ask . And Ruth laughed her merriest laugh , and then looked sober again . Perhaps she was thinking , after all , whether she knew herself . If you should rear a duck in the heart of the Sahara , no doubt it would swim if you brought it to the Nile . Surely no one would have predicted when Ruth left Philadelphia that she would become absorbed to this extent , and so happy , in a life so unlike that she thought she desired . But no one can tell how a woman will act under any circumstances . The reason novelists nearly always fail in depicting women when they make them act , is that they let them do what they have observed some woman has done at sometime or another . And that is where they make a mistake ; for a woman will never do again what has been done before . It is this uncertainty that causes women , considered as materials for fiction , to be so interesting to themselves and to others . As the fall went on and the winter , Ruth did not distinguish herself greatly at the Fallkill Seminary as a student , a fact that apparently gave her no anxiety , and did not diminish her enjoyment of a new sort of power which had awakened within her . CHAPTER XXII . In mid - winter , an event occurred of unusual interest to the inhabitants of the Montague house , and to the friends of the young ladies who sought their society . This was the arrival at the Sassacua Hotel of two young gentlemen from the west . It is the fashion in New England to give Indian names to the public houses , not that the late lamented savage knew how to keep a hotel , but that his warlike name may impress the traveler who humbly craves shelter there , and make him grateful to the noble and gentlemanly clerk if he is allowed to depart with his scalp safe . The two young gentlemen were neither students for the Fallkill Seminary , nor lecturers on physiology , nor yet life assurance solicitors , three suppositions that almost exhausted the guessing power of the people at the hotel in respect to the names of “
65731	65833	65726	65727	Henry Brierly	393	” on the register . They were handsome enough fellows , that was evident , browned by out - door exposure , and with a free and lordly way about them that almost awed the hotel clerk himself . Indeed , he very soon set down Mr. Brierly as a gentleman of large fortune , with enormous interests on his shoulders . Harry had a way of casually mentioning western investments , through lines , the freighting business , and the route through the Indian territory to Lower California , which was calculated to give an importance to his lightest word . “
65857	65864	65873	65873	you	980	” said Harry to the clerk ; “
65883	66138	65873	65873	you	980	” Harry usually had the best of everything , wherever he went , as such fellows always do have in this accommodating world . Philip would have been quite content with less expensive quarters , but there was no resisting Harry 's generosity in such matters . Railroad surveying and real - estate operations were at a standstill during the winter in Missouri , and the young men had taken advantage of the lull to come east , Philip to see if there was any disposition in his friends , the railway contractors , to give him a share in the Salt Lick Union Pacific Extension , and Harry to open out to his uncle the prospects of the new city at Stone 's Landing , and to procure congressional appropriations for the harbor and for making Goose Run navigable . Harry had with him a map of that noble stream and of the harbor , with a perfect net - work of railroads centering in it , pictures of wharves , crowded with steamboats , and of huge grain - elevators on the bank , all of which grew out of the combined imaginations of Col . Sellers and Mr. Brierly . The Colonel had entire confidence in Harry 's influence with Wall street , and with congressmen , to bring about the consummation of their scheme , and he waited his return in the empty house at Hawkeye , feeding his pinched family upon the most gorgeous expectations with a reckless prodigality . “
66151	66158	66457	66457	We	2454	” says the Colonel to Harry ; “
66198	66456	66457	66457	We	2454	” Harry did not find that eagerness to lend money on Stone 's Landing in Wall street which Col . Sellers had expected , ( it had seen too many such maps as he exhibited ) , although his uncle and some of the brokers looked with more favor on the appropriation for improving the navigation of Columbus River , and were not disinclined to form a company for that purpose . An appropriation was a tangible thing , if you could get hold of it , and it made little difference what it was appropriated for , so long as you got hold of it . Pending these weighty negotiations , Philip has persuaded Harry to take a little run up to Fallkill , a not difficult task , for that young man would at any time have turned his back upon all the land in the West at sight of a new and pretty face , and he had , it must be confessed , a facility in love making which made it not at all an interference with the more serious business of life . He could not , to be sure , conceive how Philip could be interested in a young lady who was studying medicine , but he had no objection to going , for he did not doubt that there were other girls in Fallkill who were worth a week 's attention . The young men were received at the house of the Montagues with the hospitality which never failed there . “
66465	66471	66475	66476	Mr. Brierly	393	” exclaimed the Squire heartily , “
66489	66490	66475	66476	Mr. Brierly	393	” “
66507	66527	66537	66537	you	2455	” cried Philip , as he looked about the cheerful house and went through a general hand - shaking . “
66545	66557	66567	66567	your	2455	” Alice said , with her father 's frankness of manner ; “
66575	66609	66641	66641	Phil	646	” Philip 's color came , as it had an awkward way of doing in his tell - tale face , but before he could stammer a reply , Harry came in with , “
66650	66651	66660	66660	Sellers	439	” “
66662	66666	66708	66708	I	0	” retorted Philip , “
66706	66707	66708	66708	I	0	” “
66729	66926	66929	66929	Phil	646	” was Harry 's reflection ; at which the Squire laughed , and said he quite agreed with him . The old gentleman understood Stone 's Landing a good deal better than he would have done after an hour 's talk with either of it 's expectant proprietors . At this moment , and while Philip was trying to frame a question that he found it exceedingly difficult to put into words , the door opened quietly , and Ruth entered . Taking in the group with a quick glance , her eye lighted up , and with a merry smile she advanced and shook hands with Philip . She was so unconstrained and sincerely cordial , that it made that hero of the west feel somehow young , and very ill at ease . For months and months he had thought of this meeting and pictured it to himself a hundred times , but he had never imagined it would be like this . He should meet Ruth unexpectedly , as she was walking alone from the school , perhaps , or entering the room where he was waiting for her , and she would cry “
66931	67032	67035	67035	you	646	” and then check herself , and perhaps blush , and Philip calm but eager and enthusiastic , would reassure her by his warm manner , and he would take her hand impressively , and she would look up timidly , and , after his long absence , perhaps he would be permitted to-- Good heavens , how many times he had come to this point , and wondered if it could happen so . Well , well ; he had never supposed that he should be the one embarrassed , and above all by a sincere and cordial welcome . “
67042	67049	67060	67060	I	0	” were Ruth 's first words ; “
67058	67059	67060	67060	I	0	” “
67065	67072	67075	67076	Mr. Brierly	393	” Philip at length blundered out , “
67084	67190	67062	67062	your	646	” And Ruth welcomed Harry with a friendliness that Philip thought was due to his friend , to be sure , but which seemed to him too level with her reception of himself , but which Harry received as his due from the other sex . Questions were asked about the journey and about the West , and the conversation became a general one , until Philip at length found himself talking with the Squire in relation to land and railroads and things he could n't keep his mind on especially as he heard Ruth and Harry in an animated discourse , and caught the words “
67194	67196	67062	67062	your	646	” and “
67199	67201	67701	67701	I	0	” and “
67204	67700	67754	67754	you	2472	” and knew that Harry was giving his imagination full range in the world of fashion . Harry knew all about the opera , green room and all ( at least he said so ) and knew a good many of the operas and could make very entertaining stories of their plots , telling how the soprano came in here , and the basso here , humming the beginning of their airs -- tum - ti - tum - ti - ti -- suggesting the profound dissatisfaction of the basso recitative -- down - among - the - dead - men -- and touching off the whole with an airy grace quite captivating ; though he could n't have sung a single air through to save himself , and he had n't an ear to know whether it was sung correctly . All the same he doted on the opera , and kept a box there , into which he lounged occasionally to hear a favorite scene and meet his society friends . If Ruth was ever in the city he should be happy to place his box at the disposal of Ruth and her friends . Needless to say that she was delighted with the offer . When she told Philip of it , that discreet young fellow only smiled , and said that he hoped she would be fortunate enough to be in New York some evening when Harry had not already given the use of his private box to some other friend . The Squire pressed the visitors to let him send for their trunks and urged them to stay at his house , and Alice joined in the invitation , but Philip had reasons for declining . They staid to supper however , and in the evening Philip had a long talk apart with Ruth , a delightful hour to him , in which she spoke freely of herself as of old , of her studies at Philadelphia and of her plans , and she entered into his adventures and prospects in the West with a genuine and almost sisterly interest ; an interest , however , which did not exactly satisfy Philip -- it was too general and not personal enough to suit him . And with all her freedom in speaking of her own hopes , Philip could not , detect any reference to himself in them ; whereas he never undertook anything that he did not think of Ruth in connection with it , he never made a plan that had not reference to her , and he never thought of anything as complete if she could not share it . Fortune , reputation these had no value to him except in Ruth 's eyes , and there were times when it seemed to him that if Ruth was not on this earth , he should plunge off into some remote wilderness and live in a purposeless seclusion . “
67704	67708	67754	67754	you	2472	” said Philip ; “
67756	67768	67754	67754	you	2472	“ It never occurred to me whether I would or not , ”
67774	67816	67817	67817	Philip	646	“ One of our graduates went to Chicago , and has a nice practice there . I do n't know where I shall go . It would mortify mother dreadfully to have me driving about Philadelphia in a doctor 's gig . ”
67825	67846	67883	67883	she	439	“ And does it seem as necessary to you to do it as it did before you came to Fallkill ? ”
67901	67932	68129	68129	Alice	522	“ Oh , I do n't think I should come to Fallkill to practice , but I must do something when I am through school ; and why not medicine ? ”
68122	68127	68129	68129	Alice	522	“ I should think , ”
68131	68154	68162	68162	Harry	393	“ you would rather stay in New York than to try the rough life at the West you have been speaking of . ”
68155	68160	68162	68162	Harry	393	“ Oh , adventure , ”
68164	68240	68254	68255	Mr. Philip	512	“ I get tired of New York . And besides I got involved in some operations that I had to see through . Parties in New York only last week wanted me to go down into Arizona in a big diamond interest . I told them , no , no speculation for me . I 've got my interests in Missouri ; and I would n't leave Philip , as long as he stays there . ”
68268	68287	68294	68294	Harry	393	“ What the deuce , Harry , did you go on in that style to the Montagues for ? ”
68288	68292	68294	68294	Harry	393	“ Go on ? ”
68296	68372	68254	68255	Mr. Philip	512	“ Why should n't I try to make a pleasant evening ? And besides , ai n't I going to do those things ? What difference does it make about the mood and tense of a mere verb ? Did n't uncle tell me only last Saturday , that I might as well go down to Arizona and hunt for diamonds ? A fellow might as well make a good impression as a poor one . ”
68373	68388	68294	68294	Harry	393	“ Nonsense . You 'll get to believing your own romancing by and by . ”
68389	68424	68294	68294	Harry	393	“ Well , you 'll see . When Sellers and I get that appropriation , I 'll show you an establishment in town and another on the Hudson and a box at the opera . ”
68425	68446	68254	68255	Mr. Philip	512	“ Yes , it will be like Col . Sellers ' plantation at Hawkeye . Did you ever see that ? ”
68447	68471	68480	68480	Philip	646	“ Now , do n't be cross , Phil . She 's just superb , that little woman . You never told me . ”
68472	68478	68480	68480	Philip	646	“ Who 's just superb ? ”
68493	68504	68785	68785	she	439	“ Well , Mrs. Montague , if you must know . ”
68811	68862	68920	68920	Philip	646	“ Ruth is a dear girl , Philip , and has as much firmness of purpose as ever , but do n't you see she has just discovered that she is fond of society ? Do n't you let her see you are selfish about it , is my advice . ”
68914	68918	68922	68922	himself	646	“ Confound it , ”
68924	68932	69021	69021	She	439	“ she 's in a perfect twitter . ”
69024	69026	69061	69061	she	439	“ Thee ”
69063	69065	69179	69179	Ruth	439	“ thee ”
69169	69178	69194	69194	she	439	“ Farewell Philip . Good night Mr. Brierly , ”
69207	69238	69340	69340	I	0	“ O see ye not yon narrow road So thick beset wi ' thorns and briers ? That is the Path of Righteousness , Though after it but few inquires . “
69272	69339	69344	69344	myself	0	” Thomas the Rhymer . Phillip and Harry reached New York in very different states of mind . Harry was buoyant . He found a letter from Col . Sellers urging him to go to Washington and confer with Senator Dilworthy . The petition was in his hands . It had been signed by everybody of any importance in Missouri , and would be presented immediately . “
69346	69351	69451	69451	I	0	” wrote the Colonel , “
69456	69516	69451	69451	I	0	” Harry took letters to several congressmen from his uncle and from Mr. Duff Brown , each of whom had an extensive acquaintance in both houses where they were well known as men engaged in large private operations for the public good and men , besides , who , in the slang of the day , understood the virtues of “
69523	70097	69451	69451	I	0	” Senator Dilworthy introduced the petition into the Senate with the remark that he knew , personally , the signers of it , that they were men interested , it was true , in the improvement of the country , but he believed without any selfish motive , and that so far as he knew the signers were loyal . It pleased him to see upon the roll the names of many colored citizens , and it must rejoice every friend of humanity to know that this lately emancipated race were intelligently taking part in the development of the resources of their native land . He moved the reference of the petition to the proper committee . Senator Dilworthy introduced his young friend to influential members , as a person who was very well informed about the Salt Lick Extension of the Pacific , and was one of the Engineers who had made a careful survey of Columbus River ; and left him to exhibit his maps and plans and to show the connection between the public treasury , the city of Napoleon and legislation for the benefit off the whole country . Harry was the guest of Senator Dilworthy . There was scarcely any good movement in which the Senator was not interested . His house was open to all the laborers in the field of total abstinence , and much of his time was taken up in attending the meetings of this cause . He had a Bible class in the Sunday school of the church which he attended , and he suggested to Harry that he might take a class during the time he remained in Washington . Mr. Washington Hawkins had a class . Harry asked the Senator if there was a class of young ladies for him to teach , and after that the Senator did not press the subject . Philip , if the truth must be told , was not well satisfied with his western prospects , nor altogether with the people he had fallen in with . The railroad contractors held out large but rather indefinite promises . Opportunities for a fortune he did not doubt existed in Missouri , but for himself he saw no better means for livelihood than the mastery of the profession he had rather thoughtlessly entered upon . During the summer he had made considerable practical advance in the science of engineering ; he had been diligent , and made himself to a certain extent necessary to the work he was engaged on . The contractors called him into their consultations frequently , as to the character of the country he had been over , and the cost of constructing the road , the nature of the work , etc . Still Philip felt that if he was going to make either reputation or money as an engineer , he had a great deal of hard study before him , and it is to his credit that he did not shrink from it . While Harry was in Washington dancing attendance upon the national legislature and making the acquaintance of the vast lobby that encircled it , Philip devoted himself day and night , with an energy and a concentration he was capable of , to the learning and theory of his profession , and to the science of railroad building . He wrote some papers at this time for the “
70106	70131	69451	69451	I	0	” upon the strength of materials , and especially upon bridge - building , which attracted considerable attention , and were copied into the English “
70135	70345	69451	69451	I	0	” They served at any rate to raise Philip in the opinion of his friends the contractors , for practical men have a certain superstitious estimation of ability with the pen , and though they may a little despise the talent , they are quite ready to make use of it . Philip sent copies of his performances to Ruth 's father and to other gentlemen whose good opinion he coveted , but he did not rest upon his laurels . Indeed , so diligently had he applied himself , that when it came time for him to return to the West , he felt himself , at least in theory , competent to take charge of a division in the field . CHAPTER XXIV . The capital of the Great Republic was a new world to country - bred Washington Hawkins . St. Louis was a greater city , but its floating population did not hail from great distances , and so it had the general family aspect of the permanent population ; but Washington gathered its people from the four winds of heaven , and so the manners , the faces and the fashions there , presented a variety that was infinite . Washington had never been in “
70347	70581	69451	69451	I	0	” in St. Louis , and he knew nothing of the ways of its wealthier citizens and had never inspected one of their dwellings . Consequently , everything in the nature of modern fashion and grandeur was a new and wonderful revelation to him . Washington is an interesting city to any of us . It seems to become more and more interesting the oftener we visit it . Perhaps the reader has never been there ? Very well . You arrive either at night , rather too late to do anything or see anything until morning , or you arrive so early in the morning that you consider it best to go to your hotel and sleep an hour or two while the sun bothers along over the Atlantic . You can not well arrive at a pleasant intermediate hour , because the railway corporation that keeps the keys of the only door that leads into the town or out of it take care of that . You arrive in tolerably good spirits , because it is only thirty - eight miles from Baltimore to the capital , and so you have only been insulted three times ( provided you are not in a sleeping car -- the average is higher there ): once when you renewed your ticket after stopping over in Baltimore ; once when you were about to enter the “
70585	70641	69451	69451	I	0	” without knowing it was a lady 's car ; and once when you asked the conductor at what hour you would reach Washington . You are assailed by a long rank of hackmen who shake their whips in your face as you step out upon the sidewalk ; you enter what they regard as a “
70644	72039	69451	69451	I	0	” in the capital , and you wonder why they do not take it out of service and put it in the museum : we have few enough antiquities , and it is little to our credit that we make scarcely any effort to preserve the few we have . You reach your hotel , presently -- and here let us draw the curtain of charity -- because of course you have gone to the wrong one . You being a stranger , how could you do otherwise ? There are a hundred and eighteen bad hotels , and only one good one . The most renowned and popular hotel of them all is perhaps the worst one known to history . It is winter , and night . When you arrived , it was snowing . When you reached the hotel , it was sleeting . When you went to bed , it was raining . During the night it froze hard , and the wind blew some chimneys down . When you got up in the morning , it was foggy . When you finished your breakfast at ten o'clock and went out , the sunshine was brilliant , the weather balmy and delicious , and the mud and slush deep and all - pervading . You will like the climate when you get used to it . You naturally wish to view the city ; so you take an umbrella , an overcoat , and a fan , and go forth . The prominent features you soon locate and get familiar with ; first you glimpse the ornamental upper works of a long , snowy palace projecting above a grove of trees , and a tall , graceful white dome with a statue on it surmounting the palace and pleasantly contrasting with the background of blue sky . That building is the capitol ; gossips will tell you that by the original estimates it was to cost $ 12,000,000 , and that the government did come within $ 21,200,000 of building it for that sum . You stand at the back of the capitol to treat yourself to a view , and it is a very noble one . You understand , the capitol stands upon the verge of a high piece of table land , a fine commanding position , and its front looks out over this noble situation for a city -- but it do n't see it , for the reason that when the capitol extension was decided upon , the property owners at once advanced their prices to such inhuman figures that the people went down and built the city in the muddy low marsh behind the temple of liberty ; so now the lordly front of the building , with , its imposing colonades , its projecting graceful wings , its picturesque groups of statuary , and its long terraced ranges of steps , flowing down in white marble waves to the ground , merely looks out upon a sorrowful little desert of cheap boarding houses . So you observe , that you take your view from the back of the capitol . And yet not from the airy outlooks of the dome , by the way , because to get there you must pass through the great rotunda : and to do that , you would have to see the marvelous Historical Paintings that hang there , and the bas - reliefs -- and what have you done that you should suffer thus ? And besides , you might have to pass through the old part of the building , and you could not help seeing Mr. Lincoln , as petrified by a young lady artist for $ 10,000 - -and you might take his marble emancipation proclamation , which he holds out in his hand and contemplates , for a folded napkin ; and you might conceive from his expression and his attitude , that he is finding fault with the washing . Which is not the case . Nobody knows what is the matter with him ; but everybody feels for him . Well , you ought not to go into the dome anyhow , because it would be utterly impossible to go up there without seeing the frescoes in it -- and why should you be interested in the delirium tremens of art ? The capitol is a very noble and a very beautiful building , both within and without , but you need not examine it now . Still , if you greatly prefer going into the dome , go . Now your general glance gives you picturesque stretches of gleaming water , on your left , with a sail here and there and a lunatic asylum on shore ; over beyond the water , on a distant elevation , you see a squat yellow temple which your eye dwells upon lovingly through a blur of unmanly moisture , for it recalls your lost boyhood and the Parthenons done in molasses candy which made it blest and beautiful . Still in the distance , but on this side of the water and close to its edge , the Monument to the Father of his Country towers out of the mud -- sacred soil is the customary term . It has the aspect of a factory chimney with the top broken off . The skeleton of a decaying scaffolding lingers about its summit , and tradition says that the spirit of Washington often comes down and sits on those rafters to enjoy this tribute of respect which the nation has reared as the symbol of its unappeasable gratitude . The Monument is to be finished , some day , and at that time our Washington will have risen still higher in the nation 's veneration , and will be known as the Great - Great - Grandfather of his Country . The memorial Chimney stands in a quiet pastoral locality that is full of reposeful expression . With a glass you can see the cow - sheds about its base , and the contented sheep nimbling pebbles in the desert solitudes that surround it , and the tired pigs dozing in the holy calm of its protecting shadow . Now you wrench your gaze loose , and you look down in front of you and see the broad Pennsylvania Avenue stretching straight ahead for a mile or more till it brings up against the iron fence in front of a pillared granite pile , the Treasury building - an edifice that would command respect in any capital . The stores and hotels that wall in this broad avenue are mean , and cheap , and dingy , and are better left without comment . Beyond the Treasury is a fine large white barn , with wide unhandsome grounds about it . The President lives there . It is ugly enough outside , but that is nothing to what it is inside . Dreariness , flimsiness , bad taste reduced to mathematical completeness is what the inside offers to the eye , if it remains yet what it always has been . The front and right hand views give you the city at large . It is a wide stretch of cheap little brick houses , with here and there a noble architectural pile lifting itself out of the midst -- government buildings , these . If the thaw is still going on when you come down and go about town , you will wonder at the short - sightedness of the city fathers , when you come to inspect the streets , in that they do not dilute the mud a little more and use them for canals . If you inquire around a little , you will find that there are more boardinghouses to the square acre in Washington than there are in any other city in the land , perhaps . If you apply for a home in one of them , it will seem odd to you to have the landlady inspect you with a severe eye and then ask you if you are a member of Congress . Perhaps , just as a pleasantry , you will say yes . And then she will tell you that she is “
72042	72358	73150	73162	button - holed ” Congressmen in the interest of the Columbus River scheme	7732	” Then you show her her advertisement in the morning paper , and there she stands , convicted and ashamed . She will try to blush , and it will be only polite in you to take the effort for the deed . She shows you her rooms , now , and lets you take one -- but she makes you pay in advance for it . That is what you will get for pretending to be a member of Congress . If you had been content to be merely a private citizen , your trunk would have been sufficient security for your board . If you are curious and inquire into this thing , the chances are that your landlady will be ill - natured enough to say that the person and property of a Congressman are exempt from arrest or detention , and that with the tears in her eyes she has seen several of the people 's representatives walk off to their several States and Territories carrying her unreceipted board bills in their pockets for keepsakes . And before you have been in Washington many weeks you will be mean enough to believe her , too . Of course you contrive to see everything and find out everything . And one of the first and most startling things you find out is , that every individual you encounter in the City of Washington almost -- and certainly every separate and distinct individual in the public employment , from the highest bureau chief , clear down to the maid who scrubs Department halls , the night watchmen of the public buildings and the darkey boy who purifies the Department spittoons -- represents Political Influence . Unless you can get the ear of a Senator , or a Congressman , or a Chief of a Bureau or Department , and persuade him to use his “
72360	72392	73150	73162	button - holed ” Congressmen in the interest of the Columbus River scheme	7732	” in your behalf , you can not get an employment of the most trivial nature in Washington . Mere merit , fitness and capability , are useless baggage to you without “
72395	72509	73150	73162	button - holed ” Congressmen in the interest of the Columbus River scheme	7732	” The population of Washington consists pretty much entirely of government employees and the people who board them . There are thousands of these employees , and they have gathered there from every corner of the Union and got their berths through the intercession ( command is nearer the word ) of the Senators and Representatives of their respective States . It would be an odd circumstance to see a girl get employment at three or four dollars a week in one of the great public cribs without any political grandee to back her , but merely because she was worthy , and competent , and a good citizen of a free country that “
72515	72591	73150	73162	button - holed ” Congressmen in the interest of the Columbus River scheme	7732	” Washington would be mildly thunderstruck at such a thing as that . If you are a member of Congress , ( no offence , ) and one of your constituents who does n't know anything , and does not want to go into the bother of learning something , and has no money , and no employment , and ca n't earn a living , comes besieging you for help , do you say , “
72613	72627	73150	73162	button - holed ” Congressmen in the interest of the Columbus River scheme	7732	” Oh , no : You take him to a Department and say , “
72643	73145	73150	73162	button - holed ” Congressmen in the interest of the Columbus River scheme	7732	salary”--and the thing is done . You throw him on his country . He is his country 's child , let his country support him . There is something good and motherly about Washington , the grand old benevolent National Asylum for the Helpless . The wages received by this great hive of employees are placed at the liberal figure meet and just for skilled and competent labor . Such of them as are immediately employed about the two Houses of Congress , are not only liberally paid also , but are remembered in the customary Extra Compensation bill which slides neatly through , annually , with the general grab that signalizes the last night of a session , and thus twenty per cent . is added to their wages , for -- for fun , no doubt . Washington Hawkins ' new life was an unceasing delight to him . Senator Dilworthy lived sumptuously , and Washington 's quarters were charming -- gas ; running water , hot and cold ; bath - room , coal - fires , rich carpets , beautiful pictures on the walls ; books on religion , temperance , public charities and financial schemes ; trim colored servants , dainty food -- everything a body could wish for . And as for stationery , there was no end to it ; the government furnished it ; postage stamps were not needed -- the Senator 's frank could convey a horse through the mails , if necessary . And then he saw such dazzling company . Renowned generals and admirals who had seemed but colossal myths when he was in the far west , went in and out before him or sat at the Senator 's table , solidified into palpable flesh and blood ; famous statesmen crossed his path daily ; that once rare and awe - inspiring being , a Congressman , was become a common spectacle -- a spectacle so common , indeed , that he could contemplate it without excitement , even without embarrassment ; foreign ministers were visible to the naked eye at happy intervals ; he had looked upon the President himself , and lived . And more ; this world of enchantment teemed with speculation -- the whole atmosphere was thick with it -- and that indeed was Washington Hawkins ' native air ; none other refreshed his lungs so gratefully . He had found paradise at last . The more he saw of his chief the Senator , the more he honored him , and the more conspicuously the moral grandeur of his character appeared to stand out . To possess the friendship and the kindly interest of such a man , Washington said in a letter to Louise , was a happy fortune for a young man whose career had been so impeded and so clouded as his . The weeks drifted by;--Harry Brierly flirted , danced , added lustre to the brilliant Senatorial receptions , and diligently “
73147	73149	73226	73227	old Dilworthy	478	” and “
73153	73225	73226	73227	old Dilworthy	478	” Congressmen in the interest of the Columbus River scheme ; meantime Senator Dilworthy labored hard in the same interest -- and in others of equal national importance . Harry wrote frequently to Sellers , and always encouragingly ; and from these letters it was easy to see that Harry was a pet with all Washington , and was likely to carry the thing through ; that the assistance rendered him by “
73228	73236	73297	73297	Providence	417	” was pretty fair -- pretty fair ; “
73245	73296	73310	73311	ABNER DILWORTHY	478	” said Harry . Washington wrote Sellers officially , now and then . In one of his letters it appeared that whereas no member of the House committee favored the scheme at first , there was now needed but one more vote to compass a majority report . Closing sentence : “
73304	73309	73318	73319	WASHINGTON HAWKINS	382	” ( Signed , ) “
73323	73580	73318	73319	WASHINGTON HAWKINS	382	” At the end of a week , Washington was able to send the happy news , officially , as usual,--that the needed vote had been added and the bill favorably reported from the Committee . Other letters recorded its perils in Committee of the whole , and by and by its victory , by just the skin of its teeth , on third reading and final passage . Then came letters telling of Mr. Dilworthy 's struggles with a stubborn majority in his own Committee in the Senate ; of how these gentlemen succumbed , one by one , till a majority was secured . Then there was a hiatus . Washington watched every move on the board , and he was in a good position to do this , for he was clerk of this committee , and also one other . He received no salary as private secretary , but these two clerkships , procured by his benefactor , paid him an aggregate of twelve dollars a day , without counting the twenty percent extra compensation which would of course be voted to him on the last night of the session . He saw the bill go into Committee of the whole and struggle for its life again , and finally worry through . In the fullness of time he noted its second reading , and by and by the day arrived when the grand ordeal came , and it was put upon its final passage . Washington listened with bated breath to the “
73583	73584	73318	73319	WASHINGTON HAWKINS	382	” “
73587	73588	73318	73319	WASHINGTON HAWKINS	382	” “
73591	73592	73318	73319	WASHINGTON HAWKINS	382	” “
73595	73667	73678	73678	Providence	417	” of the voters , for a few dread minutes , and then could bear the suspense no longer . He ran down from the gallery and hurried home to wait . At the end of two or three hours the Senator arrived in the bosom of his family , and dinner was waiting . Washington sprang forward , with the eager question on his lips , and the Senator said : “
73686	73707	73757	73757	I	0	” CHAPTER XXV . Washington sent grand good news to Col . Sellers that night . To Louise he wrote : “
73752	73756	74140	74140	I	0	” Harry wrote : “
74147	74211	74454	74454	I	0	” The great news lifted Sellers into the clouds . He went to work on the instant . He flew hither and thither making contracts , engaging men , and steeping his soul in the ecstasies of business . He was the happiest man in Missouri . And Louise was the happiest woman ; for presently came a letter from Washington which said : “
74461	74680	74935	74936	a feeler	2547	” And she did tell her father and mother , but they said , let it be kept still for the present . The careful father also told her to write Washington and warn him not to speculate with the money , but to wait a little and advise with one or two wise old heads . She did this . And she managed to keep the good news to herself , though it would seem that the most careless observer might have seen by her springing step and her radiant countenance that some fine piece of good fortune had descended upon her . Harry joined the Colonel at Stone 's Landing , and that dead place sprang into sudden life . A swarm of men were hard at work , and the dull air was filled with the cheery music of labor . Harry had been constituted engineer - in - general , and he threw the full strength of his powers into his work . He moved among his hirelings like a king . Authority seemed to invest him with a new splendor . Col . Sellers , as general superintendent of a great public enterprise , was all that a mere human being could be -- and more . These two grandees went at their imposing “
74682	74744	74935	74936	a feeler	2547	” with the air of men who had been charged with the work of altering the foundations of the globe . They turned their first attention to straightening the river just above the Landing , where it made a deep bend , and where the maps and plans showed that the process of straightening would not only shorten distance but increase the “
74747	74933	74935	74936	a feeler	2547	” They started a cut - off canal across the peninsula formed by the bend , and such another tearing up of the earth and slopping around in the mud as followed the order to the men , had never been seen in that region before . There was such a panic among the turtles that at the end of six hours there was not one to be found within three miles of Stone 's Landing . They took the young and the aged , the decrepit and the sick upon their backs and left for tide - water in disorderly procession , the tadpoles following and the bull - frogs bringing up the rear . Saturday night came , but the men were obliged to wait , because the appropriation had not come . Harry said he had written to hurry up the money and it would be along presently . So the work continued , on Monday . Stone 's Landing was making quite a stir in the vicinity , by this time . Sellers threw a lot or two on the market , “
74938	75057	74935	74936	a feeler	2547	” and they sold well . He re - clothed his family , laid in a good stock of provisions , and still had money left . He started a bank account , in a small way -- and mentioned the deposit casually to friends ; and to strangers , too ; to everybody , in fact ; but not as a new thing -- on the contrary , as a matter of life - long standing . He could not keep from buying trifles every day that were not wholly necessary , it was such a gaudy thing to get out his bank - book and draw a check , instead of using his old customary formula , “
75061	75173	74935	74936	a feeler	2547	” Harry sold a lot or two , also -- and had a dinner party or two at Hawkeye and a general good time with the money . Both men held on pretty strenuously for the coming big prices , however . At the end of a month things were looking bad . Harry had besieged the New York headquarters of the Columbus River Slack - water Navigation Company with demands , then commands , and finally appeals , but to no purpose ; the appropriation did not come ; the letters were not even answered . The workmen were clamorous , now . The Colonel and Harry retired to consult . “
75180	75185	75193	75193	Company	2548	” said the Colonel . “
75191	75192	75193	75193	Company	2548	” “
75197	75198	75193	75193	Company	2548	” “
75203	75204	75205	75205	You	0	” “
75209	75210	75205	75205	You	0	” “
75220	75221	75205	75205	You	0	” “
75225	75226	75247	75247	I	0	” “
75232	75246	75247	75247	I	0	” Then there was a long pause . Finally both spoke at once : “
75252	75253	75263	75263	yours	0	” “
75259	75260	75263	75263	yours	0	” “
75265	75269	75263	75263	yours	0	” said Harry . “
75285	75286	75263	75263	yours	0	” “
75305	75306	75309	75309	I	0	” “
75312	75317	75354	75354	they	2549	” said the Colonel ; “
75350	75351	75362	75362	Everybody	5858	” “
75376	75453	75362	75362	Everybody	5858	” So the orders were given and the men appeased , though they grumbled a little at first . The orders went well enough for groceries and such things at a fair discount , and the work danced along gaily for a time . Two or three purchasers put up frame houses at the Landing and moved in , and of course a far - sighted but easy - going journeyman printer wandered along and started the “
75459	75473	75362	75362	Everybody	5858	Repository”--a paper with a Latin motto from the Unabridged dictionary , and plenty of “
75475	76000	75362	75362	Everybody	5858	” conversational tales and double - leaded poetry -- all for two dollars a year , strictly in advance . Of course the merchants forwarded the orders at once to New York -- and never heard of them again . At the end of some weeks Harry 's orders were a drug in the market -- nobody would take them at any discount whatever . The second month closed with a riot.--Sellers was absent at the time , and Harry began an active absence himself with the mob at his heels . But being on horseback , he had the advantage . He did not tarry in Hawkeye , but went on , thus missing several appointments with creditors . He was far on his flight eastward , and well out of danger when the next morning dawned . He telegraphed the Colonel to go down and quiet the laborers -- he was bound east for money -- everything would be right in a week -- tell the men so -- tell them to rely on him and not be afraid . Sellers found the mob quiet enough when he reached the Landing . They had gutted the Navigation office , then piled the beautiful engraved stock - books and things in the middle of the floor and enjoyed the bonfire while it lasted . They had a liking for the Colonel , but still they had some idea of hanging him , as a sort of make - shift that might answer , after a fashion , in place of more satisfactory game . But they made the mistake of waiting to hear what he had to say first . Within fifteen minutes his tongue had done its work and they were all rich men.--He gave every one of them a lot in the suburbs of the city of Stone 's Landing , within a mile and a half of the future post office and railway station , and they promised to resume work as soon as Harry got east and started the money along . Now things were blooming and pleasant again , but the men had no money , and nothing to live on . The Colonel divided with them the money he still had in bank -- an act which had nothing surprising about it because he was generally ready to divide whatever he had with anybody that wanted it , and it was owing to this very trait that his family spent their days in poverty and at times were pinched with famine . When the men 's minds had cooled and Sellers was gone , they hated themselves for letting him beguile them with fine speeches , but it was too late , now -- they agreed to hang him another time -- such time as Providence should appoint . CHAPTER XXVI . Rumors of Ruth 's frivolity and worldliness at Fallkill traveled to Philadelphia in due time , and occasioned no little undertalk among the Bolton relatives . Hannah Shoecraft told another cousin that , for her part , she never believed that Ruth had so much more “
76002	76042	75362	75362	Everybody	5858	” than other people ; and Cousin Hulda added that she always thought Ruth was fond of admiration , and that was the reason she was unwilling to wear plain clothes and attend Meeting . The story that Ruth was “
76044	76223	75362	75362	Everybody	5858	” to a young gentleman of fortune in Fallkill came with the other news , and helped to give point to the little satirical remarks that went round about Ruth 's desire to be a doctor ! Margaret Bolton was too wise to be either surprised or alarmed by these rumors . They might be true ; she knew a woman 's nature too well to think them improbable , but she also knew how steadfast Ruth was in her purposes , and that , as a brook breaks into ripples and eddies and dances and sports by the way , and yet keeps on to the sea , it was in Ruth 's nature to give back cheerful answer to the solicitations of friendliness and pleasure , to appear idly delaying even , and sporting in the sunshine , while the current of her resolution flowed steadily on . That Ruth had this delight in the mere surface play of life that she could , for instance , be interested in that somewhat serious by - play called “
76226	76748	75362	75362	Everybody	5858	” or take any delight in the exercise of those little arts of pleasing and winning which are none the less genuine and charming because they are not intellectual , Ruth , herself , had never suspected until she went to Fallkill . She had believed it her duty to subdue her gaiety of temperament , and let nothing divert her from what are called serious pursuits : In her limited experience she brought everything to the judgment of her own conscience , and settled the affairs of all the world in her own serene judgment hall . Perhaps her mother saw this , and saw also that there was nothing in the Friends ' society to prevent her from growing more and more opinionated . When Ruth returned to Philadelphia , it must be confessed -- though it would not have been by her -- that a medical career did seem a little less necessary for her than formerly ; and coming back in a glow of triumph , as it were , and in the consciousness of the freedom and life in a lively society and in new and sympathetic friendship , she anticipated pleasure in an attempt to break up the stiffness and levelness of the society at home , and infusing into it something of the motion and sparkle which were so agreeable at Fallkill . She expected visits from her new friends , she would have company , the new books and the periodicals about which all the world was talking , and , in short , she would have life . For a little while she lived in this atmosphere which she had brought with her . Her mother was delighted with this change in her , with the improvement in her health and the interest she exhibited in home affairs . Her father enjoyed the society of his favorite daughter as he did few things besides ; he liked her mirthful and teasing ways , and not less a keen battle over something she had read . He had been a great reader all his life , and a remarkable memory had stored his mind with encyclopaedic information . It was one of Ruth 's delights to cram herself with some out of the way subject and endeavor to catch her father ; but she almost always failed . Mr. Bolton liked company , a house full of it , and the mirth of young people , and he would have willingly entered into any revolutionary plans Ruth might have suggested in relation to Friends ' society . But custom and the fixed order are stronger than the most enthusiastic and rebellious young lady , as Ruth very soon found . In spite of all her brave efforts , her frequent correspondence , and her determined animation , her books and her music , she found herself settling into the clutches of the old monotony , and as she realized the hopelessness of her endeavors , the medical scheme took new hold of her , and seemed to her the only method of escape . “
76779	76780	76840	76840	Thee	2554	” “
76838	76839	76844	76844	I	0	” “
76856	76867	76889	76889	thee	2554	” said Ruth , with a look of vast experience . “
76903	76904	76917	76917	Mother	443	” “
76908	76916	76973	76973	Thee	2554	” replied Ruth with a little laugh . “
76961	76972	77000	77000	Thee	2554	” Margaret Bolton smiled at this new - fangled philosophy . “
77009	77010	77047	77047	thee	2554	” “
77044	77045	77047	77047	thee	2554	” “
77057	77058	77066	77067	Henry Brierly	393	” “
77078	77079	77090	77090	Philip	646	” “
77092	77106	77113	77113	thee	2554	” Ruth looked up surprised and with a plain question in her eyes . “
77115	77116	77113	77113	thee	2554	” “
77120	77141	77164	77166	That odious man	2570	” and if there was any shade of disappointment in her tone , probably Ruth herself did not know it . “
77162	77163	77187	77187	Father	418	” “
77183	77184	77207	77207	he	418	” “
77219	77220	77224	77224	Philip	646	” “
77230	77231	77263	77263	He	6129	” “
77278	77279	77296	77296	He	6129	” “
77291	77295	77393	77393	Pennybacker	535	” said Ruth . “
77315	77392	77401	77401	he	535	” Ruth was interested in it nevertheless , and perhaps mainly because Philip was to be connected with the enterprise . Mr. Bigler came to dinner with her father next day , and talked a great deal about Mr. Bolton 's magnificent tract of land , extolled the sagacity that led him to secure such a property , and led the talk along to another railroad which would open a northern communication to this very land . “
77421	77422	77450	77450	You	2580	” “
77448	77449	77450	77450	You	2580	” “
77458	77463	77517	77517	he	535	” replied Mr. Bigler , “
77523	77548	77517	77517	he	535	” And Mr. Bigler laughed . When Mr. Bigler had gone , Ruth asked her father about Philip 's connection with the land scheme . “
77554	77559	78069	78070	Brother Plum	510	” said Mr. Bolton . “
77646	78068	78459	78459	I	0	” All his life Eli Bolton had been giving young fellows a lift , and shouldering the loses when things turned out unfortunately . His ledger , take - it - altogether , would not show a balance on the right side ; but perhaps the losses on his books will turn out to be credits in a world where accounts are kept on a different basis . The left hand of the ledger will appear the right , looked at from the other side . Philip , wrote to Ruth rather a comical account of the bursting up of the city of Napoleon and the navigation improvement scheme , of Harry 's flight and the Colonel 's discomfiture . Harry left in such a hurry that he had n't even time to bid Miss Laura Hawkins good - bye , but he had no doubt that Harry would console himself with the next pretty face he saw -- a remark which was thrown in for Ruth 's benefit . Col . Sellers had in all probability , by this time , some other equally brilliant speculation in his brain . As to the railroad , Philip had made up his mind that it was merely kept on foot for speculative purposes in Wall street , and he was about to quit it . Would Ruth be glad to hear , he wondered , that he was coming East ? For he was coming , in spite of a letter from Harry in New York , advising him to hold on until he had made some arrangements in regard to contracts , he to be a little careful about Sellers , who was somewhat visionary , Harry said . The summer went on without much excitement for Ruth . She kept up a correspondence with Alice , who promised a visit in the fall , she read , she earnestly tried to interest herself in home affairs and such people as came to the house ; but she found herself falling more and more into reveries , and growing weary of things as they were . She felt that everybody might become in time like two relatives from a Shaker establishment in Ohio , who visited the Boltons about this time , a father and son , clad exactly alike , and alike in manners . The son ; however , who was not of age , was more unworldly and sanctimonious than his father ; he always addressed his parent as “
78072	78458	78459	78459	I	0	” and bore himself , altogether in such a superior manner that Ruth longed to put bent pins in his chair . Both father and son wore the long , single breasted collarless coats of their society , without buttons , before or behind , but with a row of hooks and eyes on either side in front . It was Ruth 's suggestion that the coats would be improved by a single hook and eye sewed on in the small of the back where the buttons usually are . Amusing as this Shaker caricature of the Friends was , it oppressed Ruth beyond measure ; and increased her feeling of being stifled . It was a most unreasonable feeling . No home could be pleasanter than Ruth 's . The house , a little out of the city ; was one of those elegant country residences which so much charm visitors to the suburbs of Philadelphia . A modern dwelling and luxurious in everything that wealth could suggest for comfort , it stood in the midst of exquisitely kept lawns , with groups of trees , parterres of flowers massed in colors , with greenhouse , grapery and garden ; and on one side , the garden sloped away in undulations to a shallow brook that ran over a pebbly bottom and sang under forest trees . The country about was the perfection of cultivated landscape , dotted with cottages , and stately mansions of Revolutionary date , and sweet as an English country - side , whether seen in the soft bloom of May or in the mellow ripeness of late October . It needed only the peace of the mind within , to make it a paradise . One riding by on the Old Germantown road , and seeing a young girl swinging in the hammock on the piazza and , intent upon some volume of old poetry or the latest novel , would no doubt have envied a life so idyllic . He could not have imagined that the young girl was reading a volume of reports of clinics and longing to be elsewhere . Ruth could not have been more discontented if all the wealth about her had been as unsubstantial as a dream . Perhaps she so thought it . “
78462	78470	78473	78473	I	0	” she once said to her father , “
78482	78483	78485	78485	thee	2593	” “
78495	78496	78502	78502	father	6129	” “
78504	78514	78521	78522	that Bigler	2596	” continued Ruth , not to be put off , “
78534	78548	78553	78554	Such men	1827	” Mr. Bolton smiled , as men do when they talk with women about “
78550	78552	78624	78624	father	6129	” . “
78620	78621	78666	78666	thee	2593	” “
78668	78669	78672	78672	thee	2593	” “
78677	78678	78731	78731	somebody	5942	” “
78741	78906	78911	78912	Mr. Bolton	440	” Mr. Bolton was not sorry to divert the talk from his own affairs , and he did not think it worth while to tell his family of a performance that very day which was entirely characteristic of him . Ruth might well say that she felt as if she were living in a house of cards , although the Bolton household had no idea of the number of perils that hovered over them , any more than thousands of families in America have of the business risks and contingences upon which their prosperity and luxury hang . A sudden call upon Mr. Bolton for a large sum of money , which must be forthcoming at once , had found him in the midst of a dozen ventures , from no one of which a dollar could be realized . It was in vain that he applied to his business acquaintances and friends ; it was a period of sudden panic and no money . “
78914	78918	78930	78930	I	0	” said Plumly . “
78939	79011	78919	78920	Good God	378	” And yet that day Mr. Small ( Pennybacker , Bigler and Small ) came to Mr. Bolton with a piteous story of ruin in a coal operation , if he could not raise ten thousand dollars . Only ten , and he was sure of a fortune . Without it he was a beggar . Mr. Bolton had already Small 's notes for a large amount in his safe , labeled “
79014	79175	78919	78920	Good God	378	” he had helped him again and again , and always with the same result . But Mr. Small spoke with a faltering voice of his family , his daughter in school , his wife ignorant of his calamity , and drew such a picture of their agony , that Mr. Bolton put by his own more pressing necessity , and devoted the day to scraping together , here and there , ten thousand dollars for this brazen beggar , who had never kept a promise to him nor paid a debt . Beautiful credit ! The foundation of modern society . Who shall say that this is not the golden age of mutual trust , of unlimited reliance upon human promises ? That is a peculiar condition of society which enables a whole nation to instantly recognize point and meaning in the familiar newspaper anecdote , which puts into the mouth of a distinguished speculator in lands and mines this remark:--“I

It was a hard blow to poor Sellers to see the work on his darling enterprise stop , and the noise and bustle and confusion that had been such refreshment to his soul , sicken and die out . It was hard to come down to humdrum ordinary life again after being a General Superintendent and the most conspicuous man in the community . It was sad to see his name disappear from the newspapers ; sadder still to see it resurrected at intervals , shorn of its aforetime gaudy gear of compliments and clothed on with rhetorical tar and feathers . But his friends suffered more on his account than he did . He was a cork that could not be kept under the water many moments at a time . He had to bolster up his wife 's spirits every now and then . On one of these occasions he said : “
79444	79445	79462	79462	you	375	” “
79464	79465	79536	79536	Polly	422	” “

79712	79885	79705	79706	a man	795	“ In the future , Beriah ? But do n't we live in the future most too much , Beriah ? We do somehow seem to manage to live on next year 's crop of corn and potatoes as a general thing while this year is still dragging along , but sometimes it 's not a robust diet,--Beriah . But do n't look that way , dear -- don't mind what I say . I do n't mean to fret , I do n't mean to worry ; and I do n't , once a month , do I , dear ? But when I get a little low and feel bad , I get a bit troubled and worrisome , but it do n't mean anything in the world . It passes right away . I know you 're doing all you can , and I do n't want to seem repining and ungrateful -- for I 'm not , Beriah -- you know I 'm not , do n't you ? ”

And I know that I would be a dog not to work for you and think for you and scheme for you with all my might . And I 'll bring things all right yet , honey -- cheer up and do n't you fear . The railroad---- ”
79966	80000	79705	79706	a man	795	“ Oh , I had forgotten the railroad , dear , but when a body gets blue , a body forgets everything . Yes , the railroad -- tell me about the railroad . ”

VERY AGREEABLE CHAPTER XXVIII . Whatever may have been the language of Harry 's letter to the Colonel , the information it conveyed was condensed or expanded , one or the other , from the following episode of his visit to New York : He called , with official importance in his mien , at No.-- Wall street , where a great gilt sign betokened the presence of the head - quarters of the “
81955	81997	82009	82009	He	2682	” He entered and gave a dressy porter his card , and was requested to wait a moment in a sort of ante - room . The porter returned in a minute ; and asked whom he would like to see ? “
82007	82008	82019	82019	he	2682	” “
82027	82035	82036	82040	Engineer - in - Chief	2685	” That a copper - plate card with “
82041	82139	82036	82040	Engineer - in - Chief	2685	” on it should be received with such tranquility as this , annoyed Mr. Brierly not a little . But he had to submit . Indeed his annoyance had time to augment a good deal ; for he was allowed to cool his heels a full half hour in the ante - room before those gentlemen emerged and he was ushered into the presence . He found a stately dignitary occupying a very official chair behind a long green morocco - covered table , in a room sumptuously carpeted and furnished , and well garnished with pictures . “
82153	82154	82157	82157	sir	980	” “
82159	82176	82186	82188	the Chief Superintendent	2689	” said Harry , throwing as much chill into his manner as his ruffled dignity prompted . “

83007	83018	83085	83085	they	821	” Then he threw himself into his chair and said : “

84686	84712	84739	84739	you	0	” The president went to a private safe , unlocked it and got out some letters and certain slips of paper . Then he said : “
84751	84801	84807	84807	You	0	” Harry was stupefied . There were things there that made his brain swim . Presently , at the bottom of one of the letters he saw a signature that restored his equilibrium ; it even brought the sunshine of a smile to his face . The president said : “

85474	85514	85471	85471	he	393	“ We send many missionaries to lift up the benighted races of other lands . How much cheaper and better it would be if those people could only come here and drink of our civilization at its fountain head . ”

Conductor Slum , who is too old a bird to be caught with chaff , courteously informed her that the car was full , and when she insisted on remaining , he persuaded her to go into the car where she belonged . Thereupon a young sprig , from the East , blustered like a Shanghai rooster , and began to sass the conductor with his chin music . That gentleman delivered the young aspirant for a muss one of his elegant little left - handers , which so astonished him that he began to feel for his shooter . Whereupon Mr. Slum gently raised the youth , carried him forth , and set him down just outside the car to cool off . Whether the young blood has yet made his way out of Bascom 's swamp , we have not learned . Conductor Slum is one of the most gentlemanly and efficient officers on the road ; but he ai n't trifled with , not much .

I do long to know whether I am only simply a large - sized pigmy among these pigmies here , who tumble over so easily when one strikes them , or whether I am really-- . ”
89611	89698	89815	89816	the Senator	7173	continued:--“He said I could be useful in the great cause of philanthropy , and help in the blessed work of uplifting the poor and the ignorant , if he found it feasible to take hold of our Land . Well , that is neither here nor there ; what I want , is to go to Washington and find out what I am . I want money , too ; and if one may judge by what she hears , there are chances there for a-- . ”

90158	90162	90164	90165	the Colonel	6205	“ Bless me ! ”
90167	90405	90827	90827	he	393	“ I have about made up my mind to go there myself . You see we 've got to get another appropriation through , and the Company want me to come east and put it through Congress . Harry 's there , and he 'll do what he can , of course ; and Harry 's a good fellow and always does the very best he knows how , but then he 's young -- rather young for some parts of such work , you know -- and besides he talks too much , talks a good deal too much ; and sometimes he appears to be a little bit visionary , too , I think the worst thing in the world for a business man . A man like that always exposes his cards , sooner or later . This sort of thing wants an old , quiet , steady hand -- wants an old cool head , you know , that knows men , through and through , and is used to large operations . I 'm expecting my salary , and also some dividends from the company , and if they get along in time , I 'll go along with you Laura -- take you under my wing -- you must n't travel alone . Lord I wish I had the money right now . --But there 'll be plenty soon -- plenty . ”

But if the government will buy this land , it will set up the Hawkins family -- make Laura an heiress -- and I should n't wonder if Beriah Sellers would set up his carriage again . Dilworthy looks at it different , of course . He 's all for philanthropy , for benefiting the colored race . There 's old Balsam , was in the Interior -- used to be the Rev. Orson Balsam of Iowa -- he 's made the riffle on the Injun ; great Injun pacificator and land dealer . Balaam'a got the Injun to himself , and I suppose that Senator Dilworthy feels that there is nothing left him but the colored man . I do reckon he is the best friend the colored man has got in Washington . ”
91292	91297	91298	91298	she	439	“ Why , Phil , ”
91302	91341	91359	91359	Philip	646	“ what puts you in the dumps to day ? You are as solemn as the upper bench in Meeting . I shall have to call Alice to raise your spirits ; my presence seems to depress you . ”

91384	91440	91472	91472	Philip	646	“ No , I confess I can not . If you really are so low , as to think I am absent when I am present , it 's a frightful case of aberration ; I shall ask father to bring out Dr. Jackson . Does Alice appear to be present when she is absent ? ”
91441	91470	91472	91472	Philip	646	“ Alice has some human feeling , anyway . She cares for something besides musty books and dry bones . I think , Ruth , when I die , ”
91482	91495	91509	91509	Ruth	439	“ I 'll leave you my skeleton . You might like that . ”

91515	91532	91472	91472	Philip	646	“ But you must n't do it without consulting Alice . She might not like it . ”
91533	91558	91509	91509	Ruth	439	“ I do n't know why you should bring Alice up on every occasion . Do you think I am in love with her ? ”
91559	91608	91867	91867	she	522	“ Bless you , no . It never entered my head . Are you ? The thought of Philip Sterling in love is too comical . I thought you were only in love with the Ilium coal mine , which you and father talk about half the time . ”
91856	91866	91867	91867	she	522	“ I can tell you one thing , Philip , ”

92306	92329	92337	92337	Philip	646	“ Thy friend , Henry Brierly , appears to be a very worldly minded young man . Does he believe in anything ? ”
92330	92335	92337	92337	Philip	646	“ Oh , yes , ”
92340	92354	92416	92416	Harry	393	“ he believes in more things than any other person I ever saw . ”

92418	92484	92492	92492	Philip	646	“ was bred a physician , and practiced a little before he went into Wall street . I always had a leaning to the study . There was a skeleton hanging in the closet of my father 's study when I was a boy , that I used to dress up in old clothes . Oh , I got quite familiar with the human frame . ”
92485	92490	92492	92492	Philip	646	“ You must have , ”
92494	92526	92541	92541	Harry	393	“ Was that where you learned to play the bones ? He is a master of those musical instruments , Ruth ; he plays well enough to go on the stage . ”

92579	92613	92620	92620	Ruth	439	“ I have it in mind . I believe I would begin attending lectures this winter if it were n't for being wanted in Washington . But medicine is particularly women 's province . ”
92614	92618	92620	92620	Ruth	439	“ Why so ? ”
92625	92674	92576	92576	Harry	393	“ Well , the treatment of disease is a good deal a matter of sympathy . A woman 's intuition is better than a man 's . Nobody knows anything , really , you know , and a woman can guess a good deal nearer than a man . ”
92675	92684	92690	92690	Harry	393	“ You are very complimentary to my sex . ”
92685	92688	92690	92690	Harry	393	“ But , ”
92693	92745	92787	92787	Ruth	439	“ I should want to choose my doctor ; an ugly woman would ruin me , the disease would be sure to strike in and kill me at sight of her . I think a pretty physician , with engaging manners , would coax a fellow to live through almost anything . ”
92746	92758	92690	92690	Harry	393	“ I am afraid you are a scoffer , Mr. Brierly . ”
92759	92785	93242	93242	Philip	646	“ On the contrary , I am quite sincere . Was n't it old what 's his name that said only the beautiful is useful ? ”

And as to its being her first visit , why bang it , she knows that I knew it was . Does she think I have turned idiot ? Curious girl , anyway . But how they do swarm about her ! She is the reigning belle of Washington after this night . She 'll know five hundred of the heaviest guns in the town before this night 's nonsense is over . And this is n't even the beginning . Just as I used to say -- she'll be a card in the matter of -- yes sir ! She shall turn the men 's heads and I 'll turn the women 's ! What a team that will be in politics here . I would n't take a quarter of a million for what I can do in this present session -- no indeed I would n't . Now , here -- I do n't altogether like this . That insignificant secretary of legation is -- why , she 's smiling on him as if he -- and now on the Admiral ! Now she 's illuminating that stuffy Congressman from Massachusetts -- vulgar ungrammatcal shovel - maker -- greasy knave of spades . I do n't like this sort of thing . She does n't appear to be much distressed about me -- she has n't looked this way once . All right , my bird of Paradise , if it suits you , go on . But I think I know your sex .

97776	97846	97664	97664	Laura	403	“ It is a very just remark . The general held similar views . He considered snow in winter proper ; sultriness in summer legitimate ; frosts in the autumn the same , and rains in spring not objectionable . He was not an exacting man . And I call to mind now that he always admired thunder . You remember , child , your father always admired thunder ? ”
97847	97852	97864	97864	Laura	403	“ He adored it . ”

I dote on Paris ; I 'd druther scrimp along on ten thousand dollars a year there , than suffer and worry here on a real decent income . ”
100331	100363	100330	100331	Miss Gashly--“Well	590	Gashly--“Well then , I wish you 'd take us back , mother ; I 'm sure I hate this stoopid country enough , even if it is our dear native land . ”
100366	100374	100399	100400	Miss Emmeline--“Oh	593	Gashly--“What and leave poor Johnny Peterson behind ? ”
100386	100398	100399	100400	Miss Emmeline--“Oh	593	Gashly--“Sister , I should think you 'd be ashamed of yourself ! ”
100400	100440	100456	100457	Mrs. G.--“Let	8139	Emmeline--“Oh , you need n't ruffle your feathers so : I was only joking . He do n't mean anything by coming to the house every evening -- only comes to see mother . Of course that 's all ! ”
100449	100455	100472	100473	Mrs. Oreille--“What	8141	confused--“Emmeline , how can you ! ”
100457	100471	100472	100473	Mrs. Oreille--“What	8141	G.--“Let your sister alone , Emmeline . I never saw such a tease ! ”
100473	100534	100740	100741	Mrs. O.--“Not	8153	Oreille--“What lovely corals you have , Miss Hawkins ! Just look at them , Bridget , dear . I 've a great passion for corals -- it 's a pity they 're getting a little common . I have some elegant ones -- not as elegant as yours , though -- but of course I do n't wear them now . ”
100535	100739	100740	100741	Mrs. O.--“Not	8153	Laura--“I suppose they are rather common , but still I have a great affection for these , because they were given to me by a dear old friend of our family named Murphy . He was a very charming man , but very eccentric . We always supposed he was an Irishman , but after he got rich he went abroad for a year or two , and when he came back you would have been amused to see how interested he was in a potato . He asked what it was ! Now you know that when Providence shapes a mouth especially for the accommodation of a potato you can detect that fact at a glance when that mouth is in repose -- foreign travel can never remove that sign . But he was a very delightful gentleman , and his little foible did not hurt him at all . We all have our shams -- I suppose there is a sham somewhere about every individual , if we could manage to ferret it out . I would so like to go to France . I suppose our society here compares very favorably with French society does it not , Mrs. Oreille ? ”
100741	100760	100777	100778	Mrs. O.--“Very	597	O.--“Not by any means , Miss Hawkins ! French society is much more elegant -- much more so . ”
100761	100776	100740	100741	Mrs. O.--“Not	8153	Laura--“I am sorry to hear that . I suppose ours has deteriorated of late . ”
100778	100827	100777	100778	Mrs. O.--“Very	597	O.--“Very much indeed . There are people in society here that have really no more money to live on than what some of us pay for servant hire . Still I wo n't say but what some of them are very good people -- and respectable , too . ”
100828	100866	100740	100741	Mrs. O.--“Not	8153	Laura--“The old families seem to be holding themselves aloof , from what I hear . I suppose you seldom meet in society now , the people you used to be familiar with twelve or fifteen years ago ? ”
100868	100875	100909	100913	Hon . Mrs. Higgins--“Is Francois	598	O.--“Oh , no - hardly ever . ”
100912	100922	100966	100967	Mrs. H:--“I	600	Higgins--“Is Francois ' health good now , Mrs. Oreille ? ”
100927	100965	101078	101079	Mrs. O.--“No	604	intervention)--“Not very . A body could n't expect it . He was always delicate -- especially his lungs -- and this odious climate tells on him strong , now , after Parry , which is so mild . ”
100967	101077	101146	101147	Mrs. G.--“Yes	606	H:--“I should think so . Husband says Percy'll die if he do n't have a change ; and so I 'm going to swap round a little and see what can be done . I saw a lady from Florida last week , and she recommended Key West . I told her Percy could n't abide winds , as he was threatened with a pulmonary affection , and then she said try St. Augustine . It 's an awful distance -- ten or twelve hundred mile , they say but then in a case of this kind -- a body ca n't stand back for trouble , you know . ”
101079	101145	101240	101241	Mrs. H.--“Well	608	O.--“No , of course that 's off . If Francois do n't get better soon we 've got to look out for some other place , or else Europe . We 've thought some of the Hot Springs , but I do n't know . It 's a great responsibility and a body wants to go cautious . Is Hildebrand about again , Mrs. Gashly ? ”
101147	101239	101320	101321	Mrs. O.	611	G.--“Yes , but that 's about all . It was indigestion , you know , and it looks as if it was chronic . And you know I do dread dyspepsia . We 've all been worried a good deal about him . The doctor recommended baked apple and spoiled meat , and I think it done him good . It 's about the only thing that will stay on his stomach now - a - days . We have Dr. Shovel now . Who 's your doctor , Mrs. Higgins ? ”
101241	101319	101327	101328	Mrs. H.--“As	613	H.--“Well , we had Dr. Spooner a good while , but he runs so much to emetics , which I think are weakening , that we changed off and took Dr. Leathers . We like him very much . He has a fine European reputation , too . The first thing he suggested for Percy was to have him taken out in the back yard for an airing , every afternoon , with nothing at all on . ”
101324	101326	101421	101422	Mrs. O.	611	G.--“What ! ”
101328	101420	101482	101483	Mrs. O.--“Yes	614	H.--“As true as I 'm sitting here . And it actually helped him for two or three days ; it did indeed . But after that the doctor said it seemed to be too severe and so he has fell back on hot foot - baths at night and cold showers in the morning . But I do n't think there can be any good sound help for him in such a climate as this . I believe we are going to lose him if we do n't make a change . ”
101423	101478	101482	101483	Mrs. O.--“Yes	614	“ I suppose you heard of the fright we had two weeks ago last Saturday ? No ? Why that is strange -- but come to remember , you 've all been away to Richmond . Francois tumbled from the sky light -- in the second - story hall clean down to the first floor-- ”
101479	101481	101482	101483	Mrs. O.--“Yes	614	Everybody--“Mercy ! ”
101483	101492	101496	101497	Mrs. O.	611	O.--“Yes indeed -- and broke two of his ribs-- ”
101493	101495	101482	101483	Mrs. O.--“Yes	614	Everybody--“What ! ”
101498	101621	101629	101630	Mrs. O--“Well	616	“ Just as true as you live . First we thought he must be injured internally . It was fifteen minutes past 8 in the evening . Of course we were all distracted in a moment -- everybody was flying everywhere , and nobody doing anything worth anything . By and by I flung out next door and dragged in Dr. Sprague ; President of the Medical University no time to go for our own doctor of course -- and the minute he saw Francois he said , ' Send for your own physician , madam ; ' said it as cross as a bear , too , and turned right on his heel , and cleared out without doing a thing ! ”
101622	101628	101701	101702	Mrs. O.--“Yes	614	Everybody--“The mean , contemptible brute ! ”
101630	101697	101701	101702	Mrs. O.--“Yes	614	O--“Well you may say it . I was nearly out of my wits by this time . But we hurried off the servants after our own doctor and telegraphed mother -- she was in New York and rushed down on the first train ; and when the doctor got there , lo and behold you he found Francois had broke one of his legs , too ! ”
101698	101700	101701	101702	Mrs. O.--“Yes	614	Everybody--“Goodness ! ”
101702	101903	102145	102146	Mrs. O.--“It	618	O.--“Yes . So he set his leg and bandaged it up , and fixed his ribs and gave him a dose of something to quiet down his excitement and put him to sleep -- poor thing he was trembling and frightened to death and it was pitiful to see him . We had him in my bed -- Mr. Oreille slept in the guest room and I laid down beside Francois -- but not to sleep bless you no . Bridget and I set up all night , and the doctor staid till two in the morning , bless his old heart.--When mother got there she was so used up with anxiety , that she had to go to bed and have the doctor ; but when she found that Francois was not in immediate danger she rallied , and by night she was able to take a watch herself . Well for three days and nights we three never left that bedside only to take an hour 's nap at a time . And then the doctor said Francois was out of danger and if ever there was a thankful set , in this world , it was us . ”
101944	102144	101943	101944	Mrs. Gashly--“I	617	Gashly--“I do believe I should a died if I had been in your place , Mrs. Oreille . The time Hildebrand was so low with the pneumonia Emmeline and me were all alone with him most of the time and we never took a minute 's sleep for as much as two days and nights . It was at Newport and we would n't trust hired nurses . One afternoon he had a fit , and jumped up and run out on the portico of the hotel with nothing in the world on and the wind a blowing like ice and we after him scared to death ; and when the ladies and gentlemen saw that he had a fit , every lady scattered for her room and not a gentleman lifted his hand to help , the wretches ! Well after that his life hung by a thread for as much as ten days , and the minute he was out of danger Emmeline and me just went to bed sick and worn out . I never want to pass through such a time again . Poor dear Francois -- which leg did he break , Mrs. Oreille ! ”
102146	102173	102145	102146	Mrs. O.--“It	618	O.--“It was his right hand hind leg . Jump down , Francois dear , and show the ladies what a cruel limp you 've got yet . ”

102276	102287	102322	102323	Mrs. G.--“No	620	“ Poor little creature ! You might have lost him ! ”
102289	102306	102322	102323	Mrs. G.--“No	620	O.--“O pray do n't mention it , Miss Hawkins -- it gives me such a turn ! ”
102307	102321	102337	102338	Mrs. H.--“Percy	622	Laura--“And Hildebrand and Percy -- are they -- are they like this one ? ”
102323	102336	102337	102338	Mrs. H.--“Percy	622	G.--“No , Hilly has considerable Skye blood in him , I believe . ”
102338	102394	102989	102989	she	403	H.--“Percy 's the same , only he is two months and ten days older and has his ears cropped . His father , Martin Farquhar Tupper , was sickly , and died young , but he was the sweetest disposition.--His mother had heart disease but was very gentle and resigned , and a wonderful ratter . ”
102992	103000	103124	103124	she	403	“ give and take was fair play , ”

104810	104819	104793	104793	she	403	“ But will it be soon , Laura ? ”
104820	104831	104793	104793	she	403	“ It will not be very long , I think . ”
104832	104840	104793	104793	she	403	“ But what makes you think so ? ”
104841	104857	104793	104793	she	403	“ I have reasons -- and good ones . Just wait , and be patient . ”
104858	104873	104793	104793	she	403	“ But is it going to be as much as people say it is ? ”
104874	104882	104793	104793	she	403	“ What do they say it is ? ”
104883	104892	104793	104793	she	403	“ Oh , ever so much . Millions ! ”
104893	104903	104793	104793	she	403	“ Yes , it will be a great sum . ”
104904	104916	104793	104793	she	403	“ But how great , Laura ? Will it be millions ? ”
104917	104942	104793	104793	she	403	“ Yes , you may call it that . Yes , it will be millions . There , now -- does that satisfy you ? ”
104943	105045	104793	104793	she	403	“ Splendid ! I can wait . I can wait patiently -- ever so patiently . Once I was near selling the land for twenty thousand dollars ; once for thirty thousand dollars ; once after that for seven thousand dollars ; and once for forty thousand dollars -- but something always told me not to do it . What a fool I would have been to sell it for such a beggarly trifle ! It is the land that 's to bring the money , is n't it Laura ? You can tell me that much , ca n't you ? ”
105046	105062	104793	104793	she	403	“ Yes , I do n't mind saying that much . It is the land . “
105088	105089	105195	105195	Laura	403	” “
105181	105194	105198	105198	you	403	” Then after a pause -- he did not notice Laura 's smiles “
105216	105251	105279	105279	you	403	” Laura laughed a good old - fashioned laugh that had more of her former natural self about it than any sound that had issued from her mouth in many weeks . She said : “
105296	105420	105279	105279	you	403	” --and she kissed her brother good bye and left him weltering in his dreams , so to speak . He got up and walked the floor feverishly during two hours ; and when he sat down he had married Louise , built a house , reared a family , married them off , spent upwards of eight hundred thousand dollars on mere luxuries , and died worth twelve millions . CHAPTER XXXV . Laura went down stairs , knocked at / the study door , and entered , scarcely waiting for the response . Senator Dilworthy was alone -- with an open Bible in his hand , upside down . Laura smiled , and said , forgetting her acquired correctness of speech , “
105426	105427	105279	105279	you	403	” “
105436	105448	105479	105484	the committee of the whole things	3510	” and the Senator closed the book and laid it down . “

105516	105527	105528	105529	uncle ”	8231	” The Senator beamed again . He liked to be called “
105529	105535	105537	105537	you	0	” by this beautiful woman . “
105548	105549	105564	105564	he	624	” “

105872	105884	106008	106008	I	0	” Laura looked a little incredulous , and the Senator proceeded . “
105996	106007	106024	106024	he	624	” The Senator spoke with feeling , and then added , “
106019	106020	106024	106024	he	624	” “

106142	106152	106139	106139	I	0	” handing the Senator a printed list of names . “

106164	106172	106139	106139	I	0	” running his eye down the list . “

106413	106421	106426	106426	He	627	” asked Laura glancing furtively at him . “
106424	106425	106466	106466	Balloon	627	” “
106453	106465	106476	106476	I	0	” The Senator laughed , but rather feebly , and said , “
106474	106475	106482	106482	He	627	” “
106497	106502	106511	106511	he	627	” , continued Laura . “

106524	106534	106542	106542	his	627	” said the Senator , with a grave look , “

106549	106559	106542	106542	his	627	” repeated Laura , with indignation in her face . “

106605	106606	106674	106674	child	5824	” “

106726	106779	107340	107340	Colonel	1066	” And humming a cheery opera air , she departed to her room to dress for going out . Before she did that , however , she took out her note book and was soon deep in its contents ; marking , dashing , erasing , figuring , and talking to herself . “
107097	107339	107402	107402	I	0	” Laura dressed and went out , thinking she was perhaps too early for Mr. Buckstone to come from the house , but as he lodged near the bookstore she would drop in there and keep a look out for him . While Laura is on her errand to find Mr. Buckstone , it may not be out of the way to remark that she knew quite as much of Washington life as Senator Dilworthy gave her credit for , and more than she thought proper to tell him . She was acquainted by this time with a good many of the young fellows of Newspaper Row ; and exchanged gossip with them to their mutual advantage . They were always talking in the Row , everlastingly gossiping , bantering and sarcastically praising things , and going on in a style which was a curious commingling of earnest and persiflage . Col . Sellers liked this talk amazingly , though he was sometimes a little at sea in it -- and perhaps that did n't lessen the relish of the conversation to the correspondents . It seems that they had got hold of the dry - goods box packing story about Balloon , one day , and were talking it over when the Colonel came in . The Colonel wanted to know all about it , and Hicks told him . And then Hicks went on , with a serious air , “

107585	107586	108042	108043	the Colonel--“I	8274	” “
107625	107663	108042	108043	the Colonel--“I	8274	“ John Jay and Benjamin Franklin were well enough in their day , but the nation has made progress since then . Balloon is a man we know and can depend on to be true to himself . ”
107664	107702	108042	108043	the Colonel--“I	8274	“ Yes , and Balloon has had a good deal of public experience . He is an old friend of mine . He was governor of one of the territories a while , and was very satisfactory . ”
107703	107811	108042	108043	the Colonel--“I	8274	“ Indeed he was . He was ex - officio Indian agent , too . Many a man would have taken the Indian appropriation and devoted the money to feeding and clothing the helpless savages , whose land had been taken from them by the white man in the interests of civilization ; but Balloon knew their needs better . He built a government saw - mill on the reservation with the money , and the lumber sold for enormous prices -- a relative of his did all the work free of charge -- that is to say he charged nothing more than the lumber would bring . ”
107812	107833	108042	108043	the Colonel--“I	8274	“ But the poor Injuns -- not that I care much for Injuns -- what did he do for them ? ”
107834	107894	108042	108043	the Colonel--“I	8274	“ Gave them the outside slabs to fence in the reservation with . Governor Balloon was nothing less than a father to the poor Indians . But Balloon is not alone , we have many truly noble statesmen in our country 's service like Balloon . The Senate is full of them . Do n't you think so Colonel ? ”
107895	107960	108042	108043	the Colonel--“I	8274	“ Well , I dunno . I honor my country 's public servants as much as any one can . I meet them , Sir , every day , and the more I see of them the more I esteem them and the more grateful I am that our institutions give us the opportunity of securing their services . Few lands are so blest . ”
107961	108039	108042	108043	the Colonel--“I	8274	“ That is true , Colonel . To be sure you can buy now and then a Senator or a Representative but they do not know it is wrong , and so they are not ashamed of it . They are gentle , and confiding and childlike , and in my opinion these are qualities that ennoble them far more than any amount of sinful sagacity could . I quite agree with you , Col . Sellers . ”
108040	108041	108042	108043	the Colonel--“I	8274	“ Well”--hesitated
108043	108152	108408	108409	The clerk	6757	Colonel--“I am afraid some of them do buy their seats -- yes , I am afraid they do -- but as Senator Dilworthy himself said to me , it is sinful,--it is very wrong -- it is shameful ; Heaven protect me from such a charge . That is what Dilworthy said . And yet when you come to look at it you can not deny that we would have to go without the services of some of our ablest men , sir , if the country were opposed to -- to -- bribery . It is a harsh term . I do not like to use it . ”
108240	108254	108408	108409	The clerk	6757	“ Can I -- was there any particular book you wished to see ? ”
108255	108262	108408	108409	The clerk	6757	“ Have you Taine 's England ? ”
108263	108267	108276	108278	The young gentleman	3586	“ Beg pardon ? ”
108268	108275	108290	108290	he	3586	“ Taine 's Notes on England . ”
108308	108314	108290	108290	he	3586	“ Ah -- I see , ”
108319	108335	108349	108350	The clerk	6757	smile]--“Train , you mean -- not Taine . George Francis Train . No , ma'm we-- ”
108336	108348	108349	108350	The clerk	6757	“ I mean Taine -- if I may take the liberty . ”
108356	108371	108408	108409	The clerk	6757	“ Taine . . . . Taine . . . . Is it hymns ? ”
108372	108407	108478	108479	the proprietor	3589	“ No , it is n't hymns . It is a volume that is making a deal of talk just now , and is very widely known -- except among parties who sell it . ”
108482	108491	108478	108479	the proprietor	3589	“ Is it an American book , ma'm ? ”
108492	108505	108478	108479	the proprietor	3589	“ No , it is an American reprint of an English translation . ”
108506	108531	108478	108479	the proprietor	3589	“ Oh ! Yes -- yes -- I remember , now . We are expecting it every day . It is n't out yet . ”
108532	108548	108478	108479	the proprietor	3589	“ I think you must be mistaken , because you advertised it a week ago . ”
108549	108558	108582	108582	She	6757	“ Why no -- can that be so ? ”
108559	108581	108712	108712	he	3597	“ Yes , I am sure of it . And besides , here is the book itself , on the counter . ”

108773	108776	108838	108838	he	3597	“ Venetian Life ”
108817	108837	108838	108838	he	3597	“ Now here is a work that we 've sold a lot of . Everybody that 's read it likes it”--and
108845	108882	108889	108889	her	403	“ it 's a book that I can recommend--'The Pirate 's Doom , or the Last of the Buccaneers . ' I think it 's one of the best things that 's come out this season . ”
108899	108903	108914	108914	she	6757	“ Venetian Life . ”
108904	108913	108947	108947	he	6757	“ I believe I do not want it , ”
108949	109097	109351	109352	the clerk	6757	“ Have you ever read this , ma'm ? I am sure you 'll like it . It 's by the author of ' The Hooligans of Hackensack . ' It is full of love troubles and mysteries and all sorts of such things . The heroine strangles her own mother . Just glance at the title please,--'Gonderil the Vampire , or The Dance of Death . ' And here is ' The Jokist 's Own Treasury , or , The Phunny Phellow 's Bosom Phriend . ' The funniest thing!--I've read it four times , ma'm , and I can laugh at the very sight of it yet . And ' Gonderil,'--I assure you it is the most splendid book I ever read . I know you will like these books , ma'm , because I 've read them myself and I know what they are . ”
109098	109162	109351	109352	the clerk	6757	“ Oh , I was perplexed -- but I see how it is , now . You must have thought I asked you to tell me what sort of books I wanted -- for I am apt to say things which I do n't really mean , when I am absent minded . I suppose I did ask you , did n't I ? ”
109163	109167	109351	109352	the clerk	6757	“ No ma'm,--but I-- ”
109168	109222	109351	109352	the clerk	6757	“ Yes , I must have done it , else you would not have offered your services , for fear it might be rude . But do n't be troubled -- it was all my fault . I ought not to have been so heedless -- I ought not to have asked you . ”
109223	109272	109351	109352	the clerk	6757	“ But you did n't ask me , ma'm . We always help customers all we can . You see our experience -- living right among books all the time -- that sort of thing makes us able to help a customer make a selection , you know . ”
109273	109289	109351	109352	the clerk	6757	“ Now does it , indeed ? It is part of your business , then ? ”
109290	109297	109351	109352	the clerk	6757	“ Yes'm , we always help . ”
109298	109344	109351	109352	the clerk	6757	“ How good it is of you . Some people would think it rather obtrusive , perhaps , but I don't -- I think it is real kindness -- even charity . Some people jump to conclusions without any thought -- you have noticed that ? ”
109345	109349	109351	109352	the clerk	6757	“ O yes , ”
109367	109381	109351	109352	the clerk	6757	“ Oh yes , indeed , I 've often noticed that , ma'm . ”
109382	109549	109351	109352	the clerk	6757	“ Yes , they jump to conclusions with an absurd heedlessness . Now some people would think it odd that because you , with the budding tastes and the innocent enthusiasms natural to your time of life , enjoyed the Vampires and the volume of nursery jokes , you should imagine that an older person would delight in them too -- but I do not think it odd at all . I think it natural -- perfectly natural in you . And kind , too . You look like a person who not only finds a deep pleasure in any little thing in the way of literature that strikes you forcibly , but is willing and glad to share that pleasure with others -- and that , I think , is noble and admirable -- very noble and admirable . I think we ought all to share our pleasures with others , and do what we can to make each other happy , do not you ? ”
109550	109570	109351	109352	the clerk	6757	“ Oh , yes . Oh , yes , indeed . Yes , you are quite right , ma'm . ”
109590	109778	109351	109352	the clerk	6757	“ Yes , indeed . Many people would think that what a bookseller -- or perhaps his clerk -- knows about literature as literature , in contradistinction to its character as merchandise , would hardly , be of much assistance to a person -- that is , to an adult , of course -- in the selection of food for the mind -- except of course wrapping paper , or twine , or wafers , or something like that -- but I never feel that way . I feel that whatever service you offer me , you offer with a good heart , and I am as grateful for it as if it were the greatest boon to me . And it is useful to me -- it is bound to be so . It can not be otherwise . If you show me a book which you have read -- not skimmed over or merely glanced at , but read -- and you tell me that you enjoyed it and that you could read it three or four times , then I know what book I want-- ”
109779	109782	110013	110013	she	3605	“ Thank you!--th-- ”
109783	110011	110403	110403	SHE	403	--“to avoid . Yes indeed . I think that no information ever comes amiss in this world . Once or twice I have traveled in the cars -- and there you know , the peanut boy always measures you with his eye , and hands you out a book of murders if you are fond of theology ; or Tupper or a dictionary or T. S. Arthur if you are fond of poetry ; or he hands you a volume of distressing jokes or a copy of the American Miscellany if you particularly dislike that sort of literary fatty degeneration of the heart -- just for the world like a pleasant spoken well - meaning gentleman in any bookstore . But here I am running on as if business men had nothing to do but listen to women talk . You must pardon me , for I was not thinking.--And you must let me thank you again for helping me . I read a good deal , and shall be in nearly every day and I would be sorry to have you think me a customer who talks too much and buys too little . Might I ask you to give me the time ? Ah - two - twenty - two . Thank you very much . I will set mine while I have the opportunity . ”
110405	110407	110403	110403	SHE	403	“ PARDON ”
110410	110419	110612	110616	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	“ IT 'S HE ! IT 'S HE ! ”
110625	110657	110591	110591	She	403	“ I do n't know how I ever dared to send you a note , Mr. Buckstone , for you have the reputation of not being very partial to our sex . ”
110658	110687	110612	110616	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	“ Why I am sure my reputation does me wrong , then , Miss Hawkins . I have been married once -- is that nothing in my favor ? ”
110688	110728	110747	110748	the chairman	3624	“ Oh , yes -- that is , it may be and it may not be . If you have known what perfection is in woman , it is fair to argue that inferiority can not interest you now . ”
110729	110745	110747	110748	the chairman	3624	“ Even if that were the case it could not affect you , Miss Hawkins , ”
110751	110767	110612	110616	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	“ Fame does not place you in the list of ladies who rank below perfection . ”
110797	110841	110870	110870	Laura	403	“ I wish in all sincerity that I could be worthy of such a felicitous compliment as that . But I am a woman , and so I am gratified for it just as it is , and would not have it altered . ”
110842	110869	110870	110870	Laura	403	“ But it is not merely a compliment -- that is , an empty complement -- it is the truth . All men will endorse that . ”
110877	110935	110612	110616	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	“ It is very kind of you to say it . It is a distinction indeed , for a country - bred girl like me to be so spoken of by people of brains and culture . You are so kind that I know you will pardon my putting you to the trouble to come this evening . ”
110936	110983	110612	110616	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	“ Indeed it was no trouble . It was a pleasure . I am alone in the world since I lost my wife , and I often long for the society of your sex , Miss Hawkins , notwithstanding what people may say to the contrary . ”
110984	111104	110870	110870	Laura	403	“ It is pleasant to hear you say that . I am sure it must be so . If I feel lonely at times , because of my exile from old friends , although surrounded by new ones who are already very dear to me , how much more lonely must you feel , bereft as you are , and with no wholesome relief from the cares of state that weigh you down . For your own sake , as well as for the sake of others , you ought to go into society oftener . I seldom see you at a reception , and when I do you do not usually give me very much of your attention . ”
111105	111170	110612	110616	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	“ I never imagined that you wished it or I would have been very glad to make myself happy in that way.--But one seldom gets an opportunity to say more than a sentence to you in a place like that . You are always the centre of a group -- a fact which you may have noticed yourself . But if one might come here-- ”
111171	111209	110612	110616	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	“ Indeed you would always find a hearty welcome , Mr. Buckstone . I have often wished you would come and tell me more about Cairo and the Pyramids , as you once promised me you would . ”
111210	111233	110612	110616	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	“ Why , do you remember that yet , Miss Hawkins ? I thought ladies ' memories were more fickle than that . ”
111234	111272	110612	110616	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	“ Oh , they are not so fickle as gentlemen 's promises . And besides , if I had been inclined to forget , I -- did you not give me something by way of a remembrancer ? ”
111273	111277	110612	110616	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	“ Did I ? ”
111278	111281	110612	110616	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	“ Think . ”
111282	111301	110612	110616	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	“ It does seem to me that I did ; but I have forgotten what it was now . ”
111302	111319	110612	110616	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	“ Never , never call a lady 's memory fickle again ! Do you recognize this ? ”
111320	111343	111377	111377	she	403	“ A little spray of box ! I am beaten -- I surrender . But have you kept that all this time ? ”
111393	111414	111415	111416	Mr. Buckstone	626	“ I forgot myself . I have been very foolish . I beg that you will forget this absurd thing . ”
111435	111455	111377	111377	she	403	“ Please let me keep it , Miss Hawkins . I set a very high value upon it now . ”
111456	111497	111377	111377	she	403	“ Give it to me , Mr. Buckstone , and do not speak so . I have been sufficiently punished for my thoughtlessness . You can not take pleasure in adding to my distress . Please give it to me . ”
111498	111551	111415	111416	Mr. Buckstone	626	“ Indeed I do not wish to distress you . But do not consider the matter so gravely ; you have done yourself no wrong . You probably forgot that you had it ; but if you had given it to me I would have kept it -- and not forgotten it . ”
111552	111573	111377	111377	she	403	“ Do not talk so , Mr. Buckstone . Give it to me , please , and forget the matter . ”
111574	111608	111377	111377	she	403	“ It would not be kind to refuse , since it troubles you so , and so I restore it . But if you would give me part of it and keep the rest-- ”
111609	111630	111664	111664	Laura	403	“ So that you might have something to remind you of me when you wished to laugh at my foolishness ? ”
111631	111663	111684	111684	she	403	“ Oh , by no means , no ! Simply that I might remember that I had once assisted to discomfort you , and be reminded to do so no more . ”
111689	111696	111697	111697	She	403	“ If I were sure that you-- ”
111706	111731	111805	111805	Laura	403	“ This is silly ! We will change the subject . No , do not insist -- I must have my way in this . ”
111813	112041	112049	112049	he	626	“ He is fairly hooked , poor thing . I can play him at my leisure and land him when I choose . He was all ready to be caught , days and days ago -- I saw that , very well . He will vote for our bill -- no fear about that ; and moreover he will work for it , too , before I am done with him . If he had a woman 's eyes he would have noticed that the spray of box had grown three inches since he first gave it to me , but a man never sees anything and never suspects . If I had shown him a whole bush he would have thought it was the same . Well , it is a good night 's work : the committee is safe . But this is a desperate game I am playing in these days -- a wearing , sordid , heartless game . If I lose , I lose everything -- even myself . And if I win the game , will it be worth its cost after all ? I do not know . Sometimes I doubt . Sometimes I half wish I had not begun . But no matter ; I have begun , and I will never turn back ; never while I live . ”
112053	112170	112211	112211	she	3628	“ She is shrewd and deep , and plays her cards with considerable discretion -- but she will lose , for all that . There is no hurry ; I shall come out winner , all in good time . She is the most beautiful woman in the world ; and she surpassed herself to - night . I suppose I must vote for that bill , in the end maybe ; but that is not a matter of much consequence the government can stand it . She is bent on capturing me , that is plain ; but she will find by and by that what she took for a sleeping garrison was an ambuscade . ”
112228	112238	112211	112211	she	3628	“ Do n't you think he is distinguished looking ? ”
112239	112251	112211	112211	she	3628	“ What ! That gawky looking person , with Miss Hawkins ? ”
112252	112279	112211	112211	she	3628	“ There . He 's just speaking to Mrs. Schoonmaker . Such high - bred negligence and unconsciousness . Nothing studied . See his fine eyes . ”
112280	112312	112211	112211	she	3628	“ Very . They are moving this way now . Maybe he is coming here . But he looks as helpless as a rag baby . Who is he , Blanche ? ”
112313	112349	112211	112211	she	3628	“ Who is he ? And you 've been here a week , Grace , and do n't know ? He 's the catch of the season . That 's Washington Hawkins -- her brother . ”
112350	112356	112211	112211	she	3628	“ No , is it ? ”
112357	112460	112211	112211	she	3628	“ Very old family , old Kentucky family I believe . He 's got enormous landed property in Tennessee , I think . The family lost everything , slaves and that sort of thing , you know , in the war . But they have a great deal of land , minerals , mines and all that . Mr. Hawkins and his sister too are very much interested in the amelioration of the condition of the colored race ; they have some plan , with Senator Dilworthy , to convert a large part of their property to something another for the freedmen . ”
112461	112495	112831	112831	Blanche	649	“ You do n't say so ? I thought he was some guy from Pennsylvania . But he is different from others . Probably he has lived all his life on his plantation . ”
112822	112829	112905	112906	Mr. Hawkins	382	“ They are coming this way , ”
112886	112904	113016	113016	Blanche	649	“ Good morning , Miss Hawkins . Delighted . Mr. Hawkins . My friend , Miss Medlar . ”
112999	113014	113032	113032	Washington	382	“ Do n't you find it very warm to - day , Mr. Hawkins ? ”
113024	113030	113044	113044	Blanche	649	“ It 's awful hot , ”
113034	113042	113058	113058	she	649	“ It 's warm for the season , ”
113047	113057	113058	113058	she	649	“ But I suppose you are accustomed to it , ”
113083	113095	113103	113103	Washington	382	“ Washington weather generally can not be very congenial to you ? ”
113096	113101	113103	113103	Washington	382	“ It 's congenial , ”
113107	113114	113058	113058	she	649	“ when it 's not congealed . ”
113115	113139	113148	113148	Grace	650	“ That 's very good . Did you hear , Grace , Mr. Hawkins says it 's congenial when it 's not congealed . ”
113140	113146	113164	113164	Washington	382	“ What is , dear ? ”
113173	113183	113058	113058	she	649	“ Did you see those Japs , Miss Leavitt ? ”
113184	113224	113164	113164	Washington	382	“ Oh , yes , are n't they queer . But so high - bred , so picturesque . Do you think that color makes any difference , Mr. Hawkins ? I used to be so prejudiced against color . ”
113225	113243	113262	113262	Washington	382	“ Did you ? I never was . I used to think my old mammy was handsome . ”
113244	113261	113295	113295	Washington	382	“ How interesting your life must have been ! I should like to hear about it . ”
113280	113294	113295	113295	Washington	382	“ Have you been at the Capitol to - day , Mr. Hawkins ? ”
113299	113306	113262	113262	Washington	382	“ Is anything uncommon going on ? ”
113307	113337	113350	113350	Laura	403	“ They say it was very exciting . The Alabama business you know . Gen. Sutler , of Massachusetts , defied England , and they say he wants war . ”
113338	113348	113350	113350	Laura	403	“ He wants to make himself conspicuous more like , ”
113352	113376	113262	113262	Washington	382	“ He always , you have noticed , talks with one eye on the gallery , while the other is on the speaker . ”
113377	113428	113439	113439	Washington	382	“ Well , my husband says , its nonsense to talk of war , and wicked . He knows what war is . If we do have war , I hope it will be for the patriots of Cuba . Do n't you think we want Cuba , Mr. Hawkins ? ”
113429	113437	113439	113439	Washington	382	“ I think we want it bad , ”
113441	113474	113516	113516	she	403	“ And Santo Domingo . Senator Dilworthy says , we are bound to extend our religion over the isles of the sea . We 've got to round out our territory , and-- ”
113506	113515	113516	113516	she	403	“ How stupid and tiresome these people are , ”
113519	113524	113699	113699	her	403	“ Let 's go . ”
113705	113722	113738	113738	she	403	“ Why , what is it , sis ? Your face is as white as paper . ”
113723	113736	113750	113750	Washington	382	“ It 's he , it 's he . Come , come , ”
113743	113748	113793	113793	she	403	“ It 's who ? ”
113759	113792	113825	113825	she	403	“ It 's nobody , it 's nothing . Did I say he ? I was faint with the heat . Do n't mention it . Do n't you speak of it , ”
113820	113824	113825	113825	she	403	“ My God , ”
113828	113988	114221	114221	he	7173	“ this will never do . I should have killed him , if I could . The scoundrel still lives , and dares to come here . I ought to kill him . He has no right to live . How I hate him . And yet I loved him . Oh heavens , how I did love that man . And why did n't he kill me ? He might better . He did kill all that was good in me . Oh , but he shall not escape . He shall not escape this time . He may have forgotten . He will find that a woman 's hate does n't forget . The law ? What would the law do but protect him and make me an outcast ? How all Washington would gather up its virtuous skirts and avoid me , if it knew . I wonder if he hates me as I do him ? ”
114225	114230	114290	114290	they	3683	“ Laura , darling , ”
114294	114297	114601	114601	she	403	“ fast , ”
114593	114600	114601	114601	she	403	“ Your receptions are always delightful , ”
114607	114617	114683	114684	Mrs. Schoonmaker	648	“ the pleasant people all seem to come here . ”
114618	114654	114674	114674	Laura	403	“ It 's pleasant to hear you say so , Miss Hawkins . I believe my friends like to come here . Though society in Washington is mixed ; we have a little of everything . ”
114655	114672	114683	114684	Mrs. Schoonmaker	648	“ I suppose , though , you do n't see much of the old rebel element ? ”
114697	114699	114705	114705	she	648	“ rebels ”
114718	114807	114705	114705	she	648	“ You know we do n't say ' rebel ' anymore . Before we came to Washington I thought rebels would look unlike other people . I find we are very much alike , and that kindness and good nature wear away prejudice . And then you know there are all sorts of common interests . My husband sometimes says that he does n't see but confederates are just as eager to get at the treasury as Unionists . You know that Mr. Schoonmaker is on the appropriations . ”
114808	114815	114916	114916	Laura	403	“ Does he know many Southerners ? ”
114816	114915	114926	114926	she	403	“ Oh , yes . There were several at my reception the other day . Among others a confederate Colonel -- a stranger -- handsome man with gray hair , probably you did n't notice him , uses a cane in walking . A very agreeable man . I wondered why he called . When my husband came home and looked over the cards , he said he had a cotton claim . A real southerner . Perhaps you might know him if I could think of his name . Yes , here 's his card -- Louisiana . ”
114941	114951	114971	114971	her	403	“ No , he is no friend of ours . ”
114986	115020	115255	115263	one who acknowledges the playing of that martial air	3709	“ A Lady at Senator Dilworthy 's would like to see Col . George Selby , on business connected with the Cotton Claims . Can he call Wednesday at three o'clock P. M. ? ”
115265	115273	115279	115280	the Colonel	6205	“ See , the Conquering Hero Comes ! ”
115274	115277	115279	115280	the Colonel	6205	“ Gad , ”
115284	115308	115410	115410	She	403	“ Old Hickory ought to get down and give his seat to Gen. Sutler -- but they 'd have to tie him on . ”
115416	115425	115432	115432	himself	6205	“ Col . Selby , is it not ? ”
115446	115452	115410	115410	She	403	“ Laura ? My God ! ”
115453	115459	115432	115432	himself	6205	“ Yes , your wife ! ”
115460	115479	115514	115514	Laura	403	“ Oh , no , it ca n't be . How came you here ? I thought you were-- ”
115480	115513	115639	115639	she	403	“ You thought I was dead ? You thought you were rid of me ? Not so long as you live , Col . Selby , not so long as you live , ”
115631	115638	115639	115639	she	403	“ You have ruined my life , ”
115642	115696	115702	115703	the Colonel	6205	“ and I was so young , so ignorant , and loved you so . You betrayed me , and left me , mocking me and trampling me into the dust , a soiled cast - off . You might better have killed me then . Then I should not have hated you . ”
115697	115700	115702	115703	the Colonel	6205	“ Laura , ”
115716	115772	115782	115782	Laura	403	“ do n't say that . Reproach me . I deserve it . I was a scoundrel . I was everything monstrous . But your beauty made me crazy . You are right . I was a brute in leaving you as I did . But what could I do ? I was married , and-- ”
115773	115780	115799	115799	he	6205	“ And your wife still lives ? ”
115802	115805	115799	115799	he	6205	“ no , ”
115816	115823	115874	115874	she	403	“ Yes . She is here . ”
115891	115951	116064	116064	He	6205	“ And you dare come with her , here , and tell me of it , here and mock me with it ! And you think I will have it ; George ? You think I will let you live with that woman ? You think I am as powerless as that day I fell dead at your feet ? ”
116080	116128	116195	116195	she	403	“ Laura , stop ! think ! Suppose I loved you yet ! Suppose I hated my fate ! What can I do ? I am broken by the war . I have lost everything almost . I had as lief be dead and done with it . ”
116203	116215	116233	116233	She	403	“ Oh ! my God , I thought I hated him ! ”
116252	116261	116977	116977	she	403	“ And you do love me a little ? ”
116967	116976	116977	116977	she	403	“ I shall see him to - morrow , ”
116980	116995	117003	117004	the Colonel	6205	“ and the next day , and the next . He is mine now . ”
116996	117001	117018	117018	he	6205	“ Damn the woman , ”
117014	117017	117018	117018	he	6205	“ Or , ”
117029	117039	117546	117546	he	442	“ I wish my wife was in New Orleans . ”
117536	117545	117546	117546	he	442	“ The President 's table is well enough , ”
117562	117733	117831	117831	he	442	“ well enough for a man on a salary , but God bless my soul , I should like him to see a little old - fashioned hospitality -- open house , you know . A person seeing me at home might think I paid no attention to what was in the house , just let things flow in and out . He 'd be mistaken . What I look to is quality , sir . The President has variety enough , but the quality ! Vegetables of course you ca n't expect here . I 'm very particular about mine . Take celery , now -- there 's only one spot in this country where celery will grow . But I am surprised about the wines . I should think they were manufactured in the New York Custom House . I must send the President some from my cellar . I was really mortified the other day at dinner to see Blacque Bey leave his standing in the glasses . ”
117819	117824	117831	117831	he	442	“ accepting the situation . ”
117825	117830	117831	117831	he	442	“ I 'm whipped , ”
117840	118018	118142	118145	the “ Specials ”	8444	“ the government was too many for me ; I 'm cleaned out , done for , except my plantation and private mansion . We played for a big thing , and lost it , and I do n't whine , for one . I go for putting the old flag on all the vacant lots . I said to the President , says I , ' Grant , why do n't you take Santo Domingo , annex the whole thing , and settle the bill afterwards . That 's my way . I 'd take the job to manage Congress . The South would come into it . You 've got to conciliate the South , consolidate the two debts , pay 'em off in greenbacks , and go ahead . That 's my notion . Boutwell 's got the right notion about the value of paper , but he lacks courage . I should like to run the treasury department about six months . I 'd make things plenty , and business look up . ' ”
118143	118145	118219	118219	he	375	“ Specials ”
118213	118218	118362	118363	Senator Dilworthy	478	“ New York Tribune , ”
118352	118360	118362	118363	Senator Dilworthy	478	“ We must create a public opinion , ”
118365	118390	118573	118573	he	382	“ My only interest in it is a public one , and if the country wants the institution , Congress will have to yield . ”
118417	118565	118619	118620	the Colonel	6205	“ We understand that a philanthropic plan is on foot in relation to the colored race that will , if successful , revolutionize the whole character of southern industry . An experimental institution is in contemplation in Tennessee which will do for that state what the Industrial School at Zurich did for Switzerland . We learn that approaches have been made to the heirs of the late Hon . Silas Hawkins of Missouri , in reference to a lease of a portion of their valuable property in East Tennessee . Senator Dilworthy , it is understood , is inflexibly opposed to any arrangement that will not give the government absolute control . Private interests must give way to the public good . It is to be hoped that Col . Sellers , who represents the heirs , will be led to see the matter in this light . ”
118608	118617	118619	118620	the Colonel	6205	“ May be three , may be four , ”
118622	118633	118643	118643	Washington	382	“ it 's worth more than the bank of England . ”
118634	118641	118643	118643	Washington	382	“ If they will not lease , ”
118645	118672	118718	118719	the Colonel	6205	“ let 'em make it two millions for an undivided half . I 'm not going to throw it away , not the whole of it . ”
118711	118716	118718	118719	the Colonel	6205	“ What is that ? ”
118730	118753	118764	118765	the Colonel	6205	“ A mountain of coal ; that 's all . He 's going to run a tunnel into it in the Spring . ”
118754	118761	118764	118765	the Colonel	6205	“ Does he want any capital ? ”
118785	118810	118764	118765	the Colonel	6205	“ No . Old man Bolton 's behind him . He has capital , but I judged that he wanted my experience in starting . ”
118811	118876	118884	118884	Harry	393	“ If he wants me , tell him I 'll come , after Congress adjourns . I should like to give him a little lift . He lacks enterprise -- now , about that Columbus River . He does n't see his chances . But he 's a good fellow , and you can tell him that Sellers wo n't go back on him . ”
118877	118882	118884	118884	Harry	393	“ By the way , ”
118886	118941	118970	118970	Selby	442	“ who is that rather handsome party that 's hanging ' round Laura ? I see him with her everywhere , at the Capitol , in the horse cars , and he comes to Dilworthy 's . If he were n't lame , I should think he was going to run off with her . ”
118942	118969	118989	118990	the Selby	442	“ Oh , that 's nothing . Laura knows her business . He has a cotton claim . Used to be at Hawkeye during the war . “
118993	118994	118989	118990	the Selby	442	” “
119002	119006	119038	119038	I	0	” said Harry , “
119043	119090	119370	119371	That woman	3661	” Jealousy had no doubt sharpened this young gentleman 's observation . Laura could not have treated him with more lofty condescension if she had been the Queen of Sheba , on a royal visit to the great republic . And he resented it , and was “
119092	119369	119387	119387	she	3661	” when he was with her , and ran her errands , and brought her gossip , and bragged of his intimacy with the lovely creature among the fellows at Newspaper Row . Laura 's life was rushing on now in the full stream of intrigue and fashionable dissipation . She was conspicuous at the balls of the fastest set , and was suspected of being present at those doubtful suppers that began late and ended early . If Senator Dilworthy remonstrated about appearances , she had a way of silencing him . Perhaps she had some hold on him , perhaps she was necessary to his plan for ameliorating the condition of the colored race . She saw Col . Selby , when the public knew and when it did not know . She would see him , whatever excuses he made , and however he avoided her . She was urged on by a fever of love and hatred and jealousy , which alternately possessed her . Sometimes she petted him , and coaxed him and tried all her fascinations . And again she threatened him and reproached him . What was he doing ? Why had he taken no steps to free himself ? Why did n't he send his wife home ? She should have money soon . They could go to Europe -- anywhere . What did she care for talk ? And he promised , and lied , and invented fresh excuses for delay , like a cowardly gambler and roue as he was , fearing to break with her , and half the time unwilling to give her up . “
119379	119385	119387	119387	she	3661	” he said to himself , “
119394	119836	119839	119839	you	3820	” He told his wife that this woman was a lobbyist , whom he had to tolerate and use in getting through his claims , and that he should pay her and have done with her , when he succeeded . CHAPTER XLI . Henry Brierly was at the Dilworthy 's constantly and on such terms of intimacy that he came and went without question . The Senator was not an inhospitable man , he liked to have guests in his house , and Harry 's gay humor and rattling way entertained him ; for even the most devout men and busy statesmen must have hours of relaxation . Harry himself believed that he was of great service in the University business , and that the success of the scheme depended upon him to a great degree . He spent many hours in talking it over with the Senator after dinner . He went so far as to consider whether it would be worth his while to take the professorship of civil engineering in the new institution . But it was not the Senator 's society nor his dinners -- at which this scapegrace remarked that there was too much grace and too little wine -- which attracted him to the house . The fact was the poor fellow hung around there day after day for the chance of seeing Laura for five minutes at a time . For her presence at dinner he would endure the long bore of the Senator 's talk afterwards , while Laura was off at some assembly , or excused herself on the plea of fatigue . Now and then he accompanied her to some reception , and rarely , on off nights , he was blessed with her company in the parlor , when he sang , and was chatty and vivacious and performed a hundred little tricks of imitation and ventriloquism , and made himself as entertaining as a man could be . It puzzled him not a little that all his fascinations seemed to go for so little with Laura ; it was beyond his experience with women . Sometimes Laura was exceedingly kind and petted him a little , and took the trouble to exert her powers of pleasing , and to entangle him deeper and deeper . But this , it angered him afterwards to think , was in private ; in public she was beyond his reach , and never gave occasion to the suspicion that she had any affair with him . He was never permitted to achieve the dignity of a serious flirtation with her in public . “
119844	119851	119839	119839	you	3820	” he once said , reproachfully . “
119856	119868	119884	119884	you	0	” asked Laura in a sweet voice , lifting her eyebrows . “
119896	119897	119927	119927	you	0	” “
119932	119933	119960	119962	Col . Selby	391	” “
119968	119991	119996	119998	Col . Selby	391	” Laura looked up quickly , as if about to return an indignant answer to such impertinence , but she only said , “
120004	120005	120015	120015	Your	0	” “
120030	120031	120034	120034	people	5798	” “
120037	120042	120052	120052	You	0	” asked Laura calmly . “
120065	120066	120086	120086	You	0	” “
120094	120114	120117	120117	they	5798	” throwing into her eyes a look of trust and tenderness that melted away all his petulance and distrust . “
120120	120121	120239	120239	Laura	646	” “
120241	120262	120264	120264	you	0	” continued Harry , fancying that he was now upon such terms that his , advice , would be heeded . “
120269	120270	120310	120310	you	0	” “
120307	120308	120310	120310	you	0	” “
120314	120324	120378	120378	Selby	391	” Laura asked , as indifferently as she could . “
120385	120397	120407	120407	you	0	” Laura started ; in spite of her self - control . “
120412	120413	120568	120568	You	3843	” “
120487	120567	120574	120574	Laura	646	” Laura heard all this in a kind of stupor , looking straight at Harry , without seeing him . Is it possible , she was thinking , that this base wretch , after all his promises , will take his wife and children and leave me ? Is it possible the town is saying all these things about me ? And a look of bitterness coming into her face -- does the fool think he can escape so ? “
120576	120593	120574	120574	Laura	646	” said Harry , not comprehending in the least what was going on in her mind . “
120596	120609	120648	120648	you	0	” she said , forcing herself to come back to his presence . “
120657	121117	122007	122007	Ruth	439	” And she rose from her chair and gave him her pretty hand , which the silly fellow took , and kissed and clung to . And he said many silly things , before she disengaged herself gently , and left him , saying it was time to dress , for dinner . And Harry went away , excited , and a little hopeful , but only a little . The happiness was only a gleam , which departed and left him thoroughly miserable . She never would love him , and she was going to the devil , besides . He could n't shut his eyes to what he saw , nor his ears to what he heard of her . What had come over this thrilling young lady - killer ? It was a pity to see such a gay butterfly broken on a wheel . Was there something good in him , after all , that had been touched ? He was in fact madly in love with this woman . It is not for us to analyze the passion and say whether it was a worthy one . It absorbed his whole nature and made him wretched enough . If he deserved punishment , what more would you have ? Perhaps this love was kindling a new heroism in him . He saw the road on which Laura was going clearly enough , though he did not believe the worst he heard of her . He loved her too passionately to credit that for a moment . And it seemed to him that if he could compel her to recognize her position , and his own devotion , she might love him , and that he could save her . His love was so far ennobled , and become a very different thing from its beginning in Hawkeye . Whether he ever thought that if he could save her from ruin , he could give her up himself , is doubtful . Such a pitch of virtue does not occur often in real life , especially in such natures as Harry 's , whose generosity and unselfishness were matters of temperament rather than habits or principles . He wrote a long letter to Laura , an incoherent , passionate letter , pouring out his love as he could not do in her presence , and warning her as plainly as he dared of the dangers that surrounded her , and the risks she ran of compromising herself in many ways . Laura read the letter , with a little sigh may be , as she thought of other days , but with contempt also , and she put it into the fire with the thought , “
121123	122006	122007	122007	Ruth	439	” Harry was in the habit of writing to Philip freely , and boasting also about his doings , as he could not help doing and remain himself . Mixed up with his own exploits , and his daily triumphs as a lobbyist , especially in the matter of the new University , in which Harry was to have something handsome , were amusing sketches of Washington society , hints about Dilworthy , stories about Col . Sellers , who had become a well - known character , and wise remarks upon the machinery of private legislation for the public - good , which greatly entertained Philip in his convalescence . Laura 's name occurred very often in these letters , at first in casual mention as the belle of the season , carrying everything before her with her wit and beauty , and then more seriously , as if Harry did not exactly like so much general admiration of her , and was a little nettled by her treatment of him . This was so different from Harry 's usual tone about women , that Philip wondered a good deal over it . Could it be possible that he was seriously affected ? Then came stories about Laura , town talk , gossip which Harry denied the truth of indignantly ; but he was evidently uneasy , and at length wrote in such miserable spirits that Philip asked him squarely what the trouble was ; was he in love ? Upon this , Harry made a clean breast of it , and told Philip all he knew about the Selby affair , and Laura 's treatment of him , sometimes encouraging him -- and then throwing him off , and finally his belief that she would go to the bad if something was not done to arouse her from her infatuation . He wished Philip was in Washington . He knew Laura , and she had a great respect for his character , his opinions , his judgment . Perhaps he , as an uninterested person in whom she would have some confidence , and as one of the public , could say some thing to her that would show her where she stood . Philip saw the situation clearly enough . Of Laura he knew not much , except that she was a woman of uncommon fascination , and he thought from what he had seen of her in Hawkeye , her conduct towards him and towards Harry , of not too much principle . Of course he knew nothing of her history ; he knew nothing seriously against her , and if Harry was desperately enamored of her , why should he not win her if he could . If , however , she had already become what Harry uneasily felt she might become , was it not his duty to go to the rescue of his friend and try to save him from any rash act on account of a woman that might prove to be entirely unworthy of him ; for trifler and visionary as he was , Harry deserved a better fate than this . Philip determined to go to Washington and see for himself . He had other reasons also . He began to know enough of Mr. Bolton 's affairs to be uneasy . Pennybacker had been there several times during the winter , and he suspected that he was involving Mr. Bolton in some doubtful scheme . Pennybacker was in Washington , and Philip thought he might perhaps find out something about him , and his plans , that would be of service to Mr. Bolton . Philip had enjoyed his winter very well , for a man with his arm broken and his head smashed . With two such nurses as Ruth and Alice , illness seemed to him rather a nice holiday , and every moment of his convalescence had been precious and all too fleeting . With a young fellow of the habits of Philip , such injuries can not be counted on to tarry long , even for the purpose of love - making , and Philip found himself getting strong with even disagreeable rapidity . During his first weeks of pain and weakness , Ruth was unceasing in her ministrations ; she quietly took charge of him , and with a gentle firmness resisted all attempts of Alice or any one else to share to any great extent the burden with her . She was clear , decisive and peremptory in whatever she did ; but often when Philip opened his eyes in those first days of suffering and found her standing by his bedside , he saw a look of tenderness in her anxious face that quickened his already feverish pulse , a look that remained in his heart long after he closed his eyes . Sometimes he felt her hand on his forehead , and did not open his eyes for fear she would take it away . He watched for her coming to his chamber ; he could distinguish her light footstep from all others . If this is what is meant by women practicing medicine , thought Philip to himself , I like it . “
122009	122023	122024	122024	I	0	” said he one day when he was getting to be quite himself , “
122029	122030	122040	122041	women physicians	3848	” “
122035	122036	122040	122041	women physicians	3848	” “
122043	122044	122052	122054	Mrs. Dr. Longstreet	666	” “
122056	122057	122071	122071	I	0	” “
122089	122090	122099	122099	Philip	646	” “
122101	122111	122099	122099	Philip	646	” said Ruth putting her finger on his lips . “
122131	122132	122142	122142	Thee	0	” “
122147	122210	122910	122910	he	3854	” and Ruth closed his lips , with a smile on her own that broadened into a merry laugh as she ran away . Philip was not weary , however , of making these attempts , he rather enjoyed it . But whenever he inclined to be sentimental , Ruth would cut him off , with some such gravely conceived speech as , “
122248	122905	122910	122910	he	3854	” As Philip convalesced , Alice more and more took Ruth 's place as his entertainer , and read to him by the hour , when he did not want to talk -- to talk about Ruth , as he did a good deal of the time . Nor was this altogether unsatisfactory to Philip . He was always happy and contented with Alice . She was the most restful person he knew . Better informed than Ruth and with a much more varied culture , and bright and sympathetic , he was never weary of her company , if he was not greatly excited by it . She had upon his mind that peaceful influence that Mrs. Bolton had when , occasionally , she sat by his bedside with her work . Some people have this influence , which is like an emanation . They bring peace to a house , they diffuse serene content in a room full of mixed company , though they may say very little , and are apparently unconscious of their own power . Not that Philip did not long for Ruth 's presence all the same . Since he was well enough to be about the house , she was busy again with her studies . Now and then her teasing humor came again . She always had a playful shield against his sentiment . Philip used sometimes to declare that she had no sentiment ; and then he doubted if he should be pleased with her after all if she were at all sentimental ; and he rejoiced that she had , in such matters what he called the airy grace of sanity . She was the most gay serious person he ever saw . Perhaps he was not so much at rest or so contented with her as with Alice . But then he loved her . And what have rest and contentment to do with love ? CHAPTER XLII . Mr. Buckstone 's campaign was brief -- much briefer than he supposed it would be . He began it purposing to win Laura without being won himself ; but his experience was that of all who had fought on that field before him ; he diligently continued his effort to win her , but he presently found that while as yet he could not feel entirely certain of having won her , it was very manifest that she had won him . He had made an able fight , brief as it was , and that at least was to his credit . He was in good company , now ; he walked in a leash of conspicuous captives . These unfortunates followed Laura helplessly , for whenever she took a prisoner he remained her slave henceforth . Sometimes they chafed in their bondage ; sometimes they tore themselves free and said their serfdom was ended ; but sooner or later they always came back penitent and worshiping . Laura pursued her usual course : she encouraged Mr. Buckstone by turns , and by turns she harassed him ; she exalted him to the clouds at one time , and at another she dragged him down again . She constituted him chief champion of the Knobs University bill , and he accepted the position , at first reluctantly , but later as a valued means of serving her -- he even came to look upon it as a piece of great good fortune , since it brought him into such frequent contact with her . Through him she learned that the Hon . Mr. Trollop was a bitter enemy of her bill . He urged her not to attempt to influence Mr. Trollop in any way , and explained that whatever she might attempt in that direction would surely be used against her and with damaging effect . She at first said she knew Mr. Trollop , “
122915	122968	123061	123061	you	3854	Blank;”--[**Her private figure of speech for Brother -- or Son - in - law]--but Mr. Buckstone said that he was not able to conceive what so curious a phrase as Blank - Blank might mean , and had no wish to pry into the matter , since it was probably private , he “
123008	123058	123061	123061	you	3854	” It seemed that nothing could be done . Laura was seriously troubled . Everything was looking well , and yet it was plain that one vigorous and determined enemy might eventually succeed in overthrowing all her plans . A suggestion came into her mind presently and she said : “
123074	123075	123212	123212	he	3854	” “
123208	123209	123222	123222	he	3854	” “
123226	123353	123371	123371	you	644	” Visitors interrupted the conversation and Mr. Buckstone took his leave . It was not of the least moment to Laura that her question had not been answered , inasmuch as it concerned a thing which did not interest her ; and yet , human being like , she thought she would have liked to know . An opportunity occurring presently , she put the same question to another person and got an answer that satisfied her . She pondered a good while that night , after she had gone to bed , and when she finally turned over to go to sleep , she had thought out a new scheme . The next evening at Mrs. Gloverson 's party , she said to Mr. Buckstone : “
123368	123369	123385	123385	you--	3864	” “
123386	123387	123402	123402	I	0	” “

123444	123458	123473	123473	I	0	” She then went into the details . At length Mr. Buckstone said : “
123511	123512	123531	123531	I	0	” “
123529	123530	123559	123559	you	644	” “
123568	123569	123559	123559	you	644	” “
123576	123577	123603	123603	I	0	” “
123601	123602	123624	123626	a good fellow	8032	” “
123628	123672	123737	123737	his	644	” A moment or two later the two sworn friends of the Pension bill were talking together , earnestly , and seemingly unconscious of the moving throng about them . They talked an hour , and then Mr. Buckstone came back and said : “
123743	123823	123865	123865	he	644	” A fortnight elapsed , and the University bill had gathered to itself many friends , meantime . Senator Dilworthy began to think the harvest was ripe . He conferred with Laura privately . She was able to tell him exactly how the House would vote . There was a majority -- the bill would pass , unless weak members got frightened at the last , and deserted -- a thing pretty likely to occur . The Senator said : “
123898	123899	123922	123922	He	644	” “
123929	123930	124074	124074	I	0	” “
124072	124073	124106	124106	you	2606	” “
124109	124116	124119	124120	the gentleman	6791	” The door - bell rang . “
124123	124163	124180	124180	You	644	” said Laura . Senator Dilworthy retired to his study . Laura welcomed Mr. Trollop , a grave , carefully dressed and very respectable looking man , with a bald head , standing collar and old fashioned watch seals . “
124187	124188	124199	124200	Miss Hawkins	403	” “
124202	124203	124235	124235	I	0	” “

124379	124384	124387	124387	I	0	” said Laura tranquilly . “

124770	124780	124830	124831	Miss Hawkins	403	” But the gentleman seemed somewhat uneasy , nevertheless . “
124818	124829	124836	124836	you	403	” Mr. Trollop winced -- then he said with dignity : “
124846	124847	125056	125057	a knave	3901	” “
125045	125046	125064	125064	I	0	” “

125553	125566	125667	125667	you	644	” exclaimed Mr. Trollop , rising from his seat in a passion . “
125615	125662	125673	125673	me	0	is!”--and she displayed a sheet of manuscript . Mr. Trollop turned immediately back from the threshold . It might have been gladness that flashed into his face ; it might have been something else ; but at any rate there was much astonishment mixed with it . “
125675	125676	125667	125667	you	644	” “
125696	125705	125759	125759	You	0	” The gentleman wavered . Then he said : “
125725	125740	125748	125748	you	0	” Laura tore off a couple of lines from the bottom of the sheet . “
125743	125747	125816	125816	you	0	” she said , “
125827	125837	125949	125950	Miss Hawkins	403	” She read the page . Mr. Trollop said : “
125952	125953	125971	125971	your	0	” “
125974	125975	125971	125971	your	0	” “

126125	126139	126192	126192	you	403	” Then she said , much as if she were talking to herself : “
126185	126186	126192	126192	you	403	” “
126200	126201	126225	126229	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	” “
126250	126251	126225	126229	the Hon . Mr. Buckstone	626	” “
126262	126272	126314	126314	Pshaw	672	” and Mr. Trollop affected a laugh of derision . “
126312	126313	126314	126314	Pshaw	672	” “
126340	126341	126362	126362	you	403	” “
126383	126400	126435	126435	I	0	” Mr. Trollop did not laugh this time ; he seemed seriously perplexed . He said : “
126433	126434	126455	126457	Your private secretary	3938	” “
126463	126464	126468	126468	you	403	” “
126480	126481	126495	126496	Mr. Trollop	644	” “
126498	126499	126515	126515	I	0	” “
126511	126512	126525	126525	you	403	” “
126536	126574	126525	126525	you	403	” Mr. Trollop did not spring to his feet and smite his brow with his hand while a cold sweat broke out all over him and the color forsook his face -- no , he only said , “
126578	126627	126670	126670	you	403	” and looked greatly astonished . Laura handed him her commonplace - book and called his attention to the fact that the handwriting there and the handwriting of this speech were the same . He was shortly convinced . He laid the book aside and said , composedly : “
126677	126678	126795	126795	I	0	” “
126798	126799	126803	126803	you	403	” “

126865	126866	126948	126949	Mr. Trollop	644	” “
126941	126942	127091	127092	Mr. Trollop	644	” “
127115	127162	127165	127165	I	0	” Mr Trollop opened his eyes rather widely at this novel aspect of the case . He got up and walked the floor and gave himself a moment for reflection . Then he stopped and studied Laura 's face a while , and ended by saying : “
127179	127180	127230	127230	I	0	” “
127239	127240	127273	127273	I	0	” “

127380	127394	127405	127405	I	0	” Laura looked at him inquiringly a moment , and then she comprehended . “
127414	127437	127499	127499	I	0	” She picked up the page of manuscript , but she reconsidered her intention of handing it to him , and said , “
127466	127498	127567	127567	I	0	” Mr. Trollop looked disappointed . But presently made his adieux , and had got as far as the hall , when something occurred to Laura . She said to herself , “
127557	127566	127598	127598	I	0	” She called him back , and said : “
127615	127616	127626	127627	Miss Hawkins	403	” “
127637	127638	127686	127686	I	0	” “

127731	127741	127722	127722	you	644	” She mentioned the names of several prominent Congressmen . “
127744	127748	127920	127921	a brother	1113	” said she , “
127914	127915	127928	127935	That same old brother - in - law	3982	” “

127999	128006	128068	128068	I	0	” said the gentleman , facetiously , “
128082	128118	128364	128364	her	3988	” Arrived at home , Mr. Trollop sat down and thought it all over -- something after this fashion : it is about the shape it might have taken if he had spoken it aloud . “
128413	128453	128492	128492	I	0	” As soon as Mr. Trollop had taken his leave , Laura ran to Senator Dilworthy and began to speak , but he interrupted her and said distressfully , without even turning from his writing to look at her : “
128486	128487	128492	128492	I	0	” “
128494	128503	128515	128515	I	0	” The Senator sprang up , all aglow : “

128749	128768	128769	128769	Everybody	5858	” Laura reflected a while , when she was alone , and then fell to laughing , peacefully . “
128772	128777	128856	128856	he	644	me,”--so ran her thought . “
128877	129025	129045	129049	the Speaker of the House	4009	“ But what a coward the man was , to believe I would have exposed that page in the rotunda , and so exposed myself . However , I do n't know -- I do n't know . I will think a moment . Suppose he voted no ; suppose the bill failed ; that is to suppose this stupendous game lost forever , that I have played so desperately for ; suppose people came around pitying me -- odious ! And he could have saved me by his single voice . Yes , I would have exposed him ! What would I care for the talk that that would have made about me when I was gone to Europe with Selby and all the world was busy with my history and my dishonor ? It would be almost happiness to spite somebody at such a time . ”

129723	129928	129719	129720	the Senator	7173	“ Oh , not at all , not at all , my child . It is just what we want . Persecution is the one thing needful , now -- all the other forces are secured . Give us newspaper persecution enough , and we are safe . Vigorous persecution will alone carry a bill sometimes , dear ; and when you start with a strong vote in the first place , persecution comes in with double effect . It scares off some of the weak supporters , true , but it soon turns strong ones into stubborn ones . And then , presently , it changes the tide of public opinion . The great public is weak - minded ; the great public is sentimental ; the great public always turns around and weeps for an odious murderer , and prays for him , and carries flowers to his prison and besieges the governor with appeals to his clemency , as soon as the papers begin to howl for that man 's blood.--In a word , the great putty - hearted public loves to ' gush , ' and there is no such darling opportunity to gush as a case of persecution affords . ”
129929	129961	129719	129720	the Senator	7173	“ Well , uncle , dear ; if your theory is right , let us go into raptures , for nobody can ask a heartier persecution than these editorials are furnishing . ”
129962	130154	129719	129720	the Senator	7173	“ I am not so sure of that , my daughter . I do n't entirely like the tone of some of these remarks . They lack vim , they lack venom . Here is one calls it a ' questionable measure . ' Bah , there is no strength in that . This one is better ; it calls it ' highway robbery . ' That sounds something like . But now this one seems satisfied to call it an ' iniquitous scheme ' . ' Iniquitous ' does not exasperate anybody ; it is weak -- puerile . The ignorant will imagine it to be intended for a compliment . But this other one -- the one I read last -- has the true ring : ' This vile , dirty effort to rob the public treasury , by the kites and vultures that now infest the filthy den called Congress'--that is admirable , admirable ! We must have more of that sort . But it will come -- no fear of that ; they 're not warmed up , yet . A week from now you 'll see . ”
130155	130179	129719	129720	the Senator	7173	“ Uncle , you and Brother Balaam are bosom friends -- why do n't you get his paper to persecute us , too ? ”
130180	130248	130260	130261	Mr. Buckstone	626	“ It is n't worth while , my daughter . His support does n't hurt a bill . Nobody reads his editorials but himself . But I wish the New York papers would talk a little plainer . It is annoying to have to wait a week for them to warm up . I expected better things at their hands -- and time is precious , now . ”

It is contended , now , that he has been a friend to the bill , in secret , since the day it was introduced , and has had bankable reasons for being so ; but he himself declares that he has gone over because the malignant persecution of the bill by the newspapers caused him to study its provisions with more care than he had previously done , and this close examination revealed the fact that the measure is one in every way worthy of support . ( Pretty thin ! ) It can not be denied that this desertion has had a damaging effect . Jex and Fluke have returned to their iniquitous allegiance , with six or eight others of lesser calibre , and it is reported and believed that Tubbs and Huffy are ready to go back . It is feared that the University swindle is stronger to - day than it has ever been before . ”

142359	142364	142443	142444	the Colonel	6205	“ Are you cold ? ”
142365	142395	142345	142345	she	4569	“ It is pretty chilly . The stone floor is like ice . It chills me through to step on it . I have to sit on the bed . ”
142396	142410	142443	142444	the Colonel	6205	“ Poor thing , poor thing . And can you eat any thing ? ”
142411	142436	142443	142444	the Colonel	6205	“ No , I am not hungry . I do n't know that I could eat any thing , I ca n't eat that . ”
142437	142441	142443	142444	the Colonel	6205	“ Oh dear , ”
142446	142460	142472	142472	he	6205	“ it 's dreadful . But cheer up , dear , cheer up ; ”
142468	142471	142472	142472	he	6205	“ But , ”
142476	142525	142526	142526	Laura	646	“ we 'll stand by you . We 'll do everything for you . I know you could n't have meant to do it , it must have been insanity , you know , or something of that sort . You never did anything of the sort before . ”
142533	142559	142642	142642	Laura	646	“ Yes , it was something of that sort . It 's all a whirl . He was a villain ; you do n't know . ”
142560	142641	142750	142750	he	6205	“ I 'd rather have killed him myself , in a duel you know , all fair . I wish I had . But do n't you be down . We 'll get you the best counsel , the lawyers in New York can do anything ; I 've read of cases . But you must be comfortable now . We 've brought some of your clothes , at the hotel . What else , can we get for you ? ”
142754	142785	142917	142917	Philip	646	“ You 've got a big establishment here , a credit to the city . I 've got a friend in there -- I shall see you again , sir . ”
142908	142910	143430	143430	she	4616	“ improvement ”
143453	143457	143681	143681	he	478	“ momentary insanity . ”
143673	143680	143681	143681	he	478	“ We shall all need mercy , ”
143684	143754	143927	143927	Laura	700	“ Laura as an inmate of my family was a most exemplary female , amiable , affectionate and truthful , perhaps too fond of gaiety , and neglectful of the externals of religion , but a woman of principle . She may have had experiences of which I am ignorant , but she could not have gone to this extremity if she had been in her own right mind . ”
143936	143948	144391	144391	he	440	“ mother , I did not know what I was doing . ”
144383	144390	144395	144395	Philip	646	“ You see , Mr. Bolton , ”
144402	144455	144466	144466	Philip	646	“ it puts us all out . It looks as if politics was played out . We 'd counted on the year of Simon 's re - election . And , now , he 's reelected , and I 've yet to see the first man who 's the better for it . ”
144456	144464	144466	144466	Philip	646	“ You do n't mean to say , ”
144468	144477	144495	144496	Mr. Bigler	440	“ that he went in without paying anything ? ”
144478	144493	144495	144496	Mr. Bigler	440	“ Not a cent , not a dash cent , as I can hear , ”
144500	144529	144395	144395	Philip	646	“ I call it a swindle on the state . How it was done gets me . I never saw such a tight time for money in Harrisburg . ”
144530	144551	144554	144554	I	0	“ Were there no combinations , no railroad jobs , no mining schemes put through in connection with the election ? “
144557	144567	144495	144496	Mr. Bigler	440	” said Bigler , shaking his head in disgust . “
144590	144591	144495	144496	Mr. Bigler	440	” “
144594	144598	144637	144637	You	0	” suggested Philip , “
144635	144636	144637	144637	You	0	” “
144641	144647	144637	144637	You	0	” said Mr. Bolton smiling , “
144672	144673	144637	144637	You	0	” “
144678	144683	144803	144803	We	4656	” interrupted Mr. Bigler , “
144743	144802	144803	144803	We	4656	” It was melancholy , but Mr. Bigler was not a man to be crushed by one misfortune , or to lose his confidence in human nature , on one exhibition of apparent honesty . He was already on his feet again , or would be if Mr. Bolton could tide him over shoal water for ninety days . “
144812	144819	145192	145192	Philip	646	” he explained to Mr. Bolton , “
144848	145191	145192	145192	Philip	646	” Mr. Bigler made some figures ; contract so much , cost of work and materials so much , profits so much . At the end of three months the city would owe the company three hundred and seventy - five thousand dollars - two hundred thousand of that would be profits . The whole job was worth at least a million to the company -- it might be more . There could be no mistake in these figures ; here was the contract , Mr. Bolton knew what materials were worth and what the labor would cost . Mr. Bolton knew perfectly well from sore experience that there was always a mistake in figures when Bigler or Small made them , and he knew that he ought to send the fellow about his business . Instead of that , he let him talk . They only wanted to raise fifty thousand dollars to carry on the contract -- that expended they would have city bonds . Mr. Bolton said he had n't the money . But Bigler could raise it on his name . Mr. Bolton said he had no right to put his family to that risk . But the entire contract could be assigned to him -- the security was ample -- it was a fortune to him if it was forfeited . Besides Mr. Bigler had been unfortunate , he did n't know where to look for the necessaries of life for his family . If he could only have one more chance , he was sure he could right himself . He begged for it . And Mr. Bolton yielded . He could never refuse such appeals . If he had befriended a man once and been cheated by him , that man appeared to have a claim upon him forever . He shrank , however , from telling his wife what he had done on this occasion , for he knew that if any person was more odious than Small to his family it was Bigler . “
145196	145203	145231	145231	He	4662	” Mrs. Bolton said that evening , “
145229	145230	145245	145245	He	4662	” “
145237	145244	145260	145260	thee	646	” replied Mr. Bolton , uneasily . “
145268	145269	145260	145260	thee	646	” “
145304	145324	145260	145260	thee	646	” Mrs. Bolton looked grave and anxious , but she did not complain or remonstrate ; she knew what a “
145327	145410	145413	145413	thee	0	” meant , but she knew there was no help for it . If Mr. Bolton had been on his way to market to buy a dinner for his family with the only dollar he had in the world in his pocket , he would have given it to a chance beggar who asked him for it . Mrs. Bolton only asked ( and the question showed that she was no mere provident than her husband where her heart was interested ) , “
145426	145427	145696	145696	sir	980	” “
145499	145693	145710	145710	you	980	” Philip could not but feel that he was treated very much like one of the Bolton - family -- by all except Ruth . His mother , when he went home after his recovery from his accident , had affected to be very jealous of Mrs. Bolton , about whom and Ruth she asked a thousand questions -- an affectation of jealousy which no doubt concealed a real heartache , which comes to every mother when her son goes out into the world and forms new ties . And to Mrs. Sterling , a widow , living on a small income in a remote Massachusetts village , Philadelphia was a city of many splendors . All its inhabitants seemed highly favored , dwelling in ease and surrounded by superior advantages . Some of her neighbors had relations living in Philadelphia , and it seemed to them somehow a guarantee of respectability to have relations in Philadelphia . Mrs. Sterling was not sorry to have Philip make his way among such well - to - do people , and she was sure that no good fortune could be too good for his deserts . “
145698	145709	145728	145729	this woman	3719	” said Ruth , when Philip came from New York , “
145737	145738	145728	145729	this woman	3719	” “
145743	145751	145784	145784	I	0	” replied Philip , a little annoyed , “
145810	145811	145825	145825	I	0	” “
145823	145824	145830	145830	she	3719	” “
145842	145847	145830	145830	she	3719	“ Not like Alice ? ”
145848	145886	145830	145830	she	3719	“ Well , she is brilliant ; she was called the handsomest woman in Washington -- dashing , you know , and sarcastic and witty . Ruth , do you believe a woman ever becomes a devil ? ”
145887	145907	145830	145830	she	3719	“ Men do , and I do n't know why women should n't . But I never saw one . ”
145908	145928	145830	145830	she	3719	“ Well , Laura Hawkins comes very near it . But it is dreadful to think of her fate . ”
145929	145952	145830	145830	she	3719	“ Why , do you suppose they will hang a woman ? Do you suppose they will be so barbarous as that ? ”
145953	145990	145998	145998	Ruth	439	“ I was n't thinking of that -- it 's doubtful if a New York jury would find a woman guilty of any such crime . But to think of her life if she is acquitted . ”
145991	145996	145998	145998	Ruth	439	“ It is dreadful , ”
146002	146084	146092	146092	Philip	646	“ but the worst of it is that you men do not want women educated to do anything , to be able to earn an honest living by their own exertions . They are educated as if they were always to be petted and supported , and there was never to be any such thing as misfortune . I suppose , now , that you would all choose to have me stay idly at home , and give up my profession . ”
146085	146090	146092	146092	Philip	646	“ Oh , no , ”
146096	146130	145998	145998	Ruth	439	“ I respect your resolution . But , Ruth , do you think you would be happier or do more good in following your profession than in having a home of your own ? ”
146131	146143	146092	146092	Philip	646	“ What is to hinder having a home of my own ? ”
146144	146184	146092	146092	Philip	646	“ Nothing , perhaps , only you never would be in it -- you would be away day and night , if you had any practice ; and what sort of a home would that make for your husband ? ”
146185	146209	145998	145998	Ruth	439	“ What sort of a home is it for the wife whose husband is always away riding about in his doctor 's gig ? ”
146210	146226	146318	146318	he	646	“ Ah , you know that is not fair . The woman makes the home . ”
146304	146317	146318	146318	he	646	“ I should work with a great deal better heart , Ruth , ”
146327	146338	146389	146389	Philip	646	“ if I knew you cared for me a little . ”
146377	146388	146389	146389	Philip	646	“ It 's not much of a place , Ilium , ”
146409	146427	146459	146459	She	439	“ and I shall have plenty of time to think over the responsibility I have taken , and-- ”
146470	146479	146482	146482	she	439	“ Thee must n't lose heart , Philip . ”
146489	146521	146870	146871	the miners	4678	“ Thee knows I graduate in the summer and shall have my diploma . And if any thing happens -- mines explode sometimes -- thee can send for me . Farewell . ”
146873	146876	147241	147243	the learned counsel	4718	“ signs . ”
147261	147267	147367	147367	his	4719	“ We 've struck it ! ”
147301	147322	147363	147364	The foreman	4719	“ What ! Where is it ? When ? Coal ? Let me see it . What quality is it ? ”
147338	147362	147430	147430	his	646	“ Harry , wake up , my boy , the coal train is coming . Struck it , eh ? Let 's see ? ”
147434	147445	147430	147430	his	646	“ Now , Roberts , you are sure about this ? ”
147446	147455	147430	147430	his	646	“ What -- sure that it 's coal ? ”
147456	147469	147430	147430	his	646	“ O , no , sure that it 's the main vein . ”
147470	147481	147430	147430	his	646	“ Well , yes . We took it to be that ”
147482	147489	147430	147430	his	646	“ Did you from the first ? ”
147490	147533	147430	147430	his	646	“ I ca n't say we did at first . No , we did n't . Most of the indications were there , but not all of them , not all of them . So we thought we 'd prospect a bit . ”
147534	147537	147430	147430	his	646	“ Well ? ”
147538	147579	147430	147430	his	646	“ It was tolerable thick , and looked as if it might be the vein -- looked as if it ought to be the vein . Then we went down on it a little . Looked better all the time . ”
147580	147587	147430	147430	his	646	“ When did you strike it ? ”
147588	147593	147430	147430	his	646	“ About ten o'clock . ”
147594	147604	147430	147430	his	646	“ Then you 've been prospecting about four hours . ”
147605	147617	147430	147430	his	646	“ Yes , been sinking on it something over four hours . ”
147618	147636	147430	147430	his	646	“ I 'm afraid you could n't go down very far in four hours -- could you ? ”
147637	147656	147430	147430	his	646	“ O yes -- it 's a good deal broke up , nothing but picking and gadding stuff . ”
147657	147673	147430	147430	his	646	“ Well , it does look encouraging , sure enough -- but then the lacking indications-- ”
147674	147702	147430	147430	his	646	“ I 'd rather we had them , Mr. Sterling , but I 've seen more than one good permanent mine struck without 'em in my time . ”
147703	147711	147430	147430	his	646	“ Well , that is encouraging too . ”
147712	147748	147430	147430	his	646	“ Yes , there was the Union , the Alabama and the Black Mohawk -- all good , sound mines , you know -- all just exactly like this one when we first struck them . ”
147749	147780	147430	147430	his	646	“ Well , I begin to feel a good deal more easy . I guess we 've really got it . I remember hearing them tell about the Black Mohawk . ”
147781	147809	147832	147832	Philip	646	“ I 'm free to say that I believe it , and the men all think so too . They are all old hands at this business . ”
147810	147830	147891	147891	Harry	393	“ Come Harry , let 's go up and look at it , just for the comfort of it , ”
147885	147889	147891	147891	Harry	393	“ Of course , ”
147893	147915	147891	147891	Harry	393	“ there will have to be a branch track built , and a ' switch - back ' up the hill . ”
147916	147973	147982	147982	Harry	393	“ Yes , there will be no trouble about getting the money for that now . We could sell - out tomorrow for a handsome sum . That sort of coal does n't go begging within a mile of a rail - road . I wonder if Mr. Bolton would rather sell out or work it ? ”
147974	147980	147982	147982	Harry	393	“ Oh , work it , ”
147984	147998	148014	148014	Philip	646	“ probably the whole mountain is coal now you 've got to it . ”
147999	148012	148014	148014	Philip	646	“ Possibly it might not be much of a vein after all , ”
148016	148050	148219	148219	she	439	“ Possibly it is ; I 'll bet it 's forty feet thick . I told you . I knew the sort of thing as soon as I put my eyes on it . ”
148227	148234	148350	148350	he	440	“ P. S.--We have found coal . ”
148344	148349	148350	148350	he	440	“ I am afraid , ”
148356	148381	148393	148394	Mrs. Bolton	566	“ that we shall have to give up our house . I do n't care for myself , but for thee and the children . ”
148382	148391	148393	148394	Mrs. Bolton	566	“ That will be the least of misfortunes , ”
148398	148437	148350	148350	he	440	“ if thee can clear thyself from debt and anxiety , which is wearing thee out , we can live any where . Thee knows we were never happier than when we were in a much humbler home . ”
148438	148536	148759	148759	Ruth	439	“ The truth is , Margaret , that affair of Bigler and Small 's has come on me just when I could n't stand another ounce . They have made another failure of it . I might have known they would ; and the sharpers , or fools , I do n't know which , have contrived to involve me for three times as much as the first obligation . The security is in my hands , but it is good for nothing to me . I have not the money to do anything with the contract . ”
148743	148757	148759	148759	Ruth	439	“ Perhaps , I shall be the stay of the family , yet , ”
148767	148807	148820	148821	Mr. Bolton	440	“ When we move into a little house in town , will thee let me put a little sign on the door : DR . RUTH BOLTON ? Mrs. Dr. Longstreet , thee knows , has a great income . ”
148808	148818	148898	148898	He	440	“ Who will pay for the sign , Ruth ? ”
148862	148897	148934	148934	he	440	“ Oh , here is one from Philip . Poor fellow . I shall feel his disappointment as much as my own bad luck . It is hard to bear when one is young . ”
148929	148933	148934	148934	he	440	“ Read that , ”

149354	149368	149351	149351	he	646	“ but we look upon it as an indication of better further in . ”

149733	149742	149743	149744	Mr. Bolton	440	“ You must not look at it so ! ”
149748	149824	149898	149898	He	646	“ You have neither helped nor hindered -- but you know you may help by and by . It would have all happened just so , if we had never begun to dig that hole . That is only a drop . Work away . I still have hope that something will occur to relieve me . At any rate we must not give up the mine , so long as we have any show . ”

152007	152115	152121	152121	Alice	505	“ the chances are that a man can not get into congress now without resorting to arts and means that should render him unfit to go there ; of course there are exceptions ; but do you know that I could not go into politics if I were a lawyer , without losing standing somewhat in my profession , and without raising at least a suspicion of my intentions and unselfishness ? Why , it is telegraphed all over the country and commented on as something wonderful if a congressman votes honestly and unselfishly and refuses to take advantage of his position to steal from the government . ”
152116	152119	152121	152121	Alice	505	“ But , ”
152123	152179	152238	152238	Philip	646	“ I should think it a noble ambition to go to congress , if it is so bad , and help reform it . I do n't believe it is as corrupt as the English parliament used to be , if there is any truth in the novels , and I suppose that is reformed . ”
152180	152236	152238	152238	Philip	646	“ I 'm sure I do n't know where the reform is to begin . I 've seen a perfectly capable , honest man , time and again , run against an illiterate trickster , and get beaten . I suppose if the people wanted decent members of congress they would elect them . Perhaps , ”
152243	152251	152291	152291	Alice	505	“ the women will have to vote . ”
152252	152289	152319	152319	Philip	646	“ Well , I should be willing to , if it were a necessity , just as I would go to war and do what I could , if the country could n't be saved otherwise , ”
152308	152318	152319	152319	Philip	646	“ If I were a young gentleman in these times-- ”
152323	152355	152366	152366	Alice	505	“ It 's just what Ruth used to say , ' if she were a man . ' I wonder if all the young ladies are contemplating a change of sex . ”
152356	152364	152366	152366	Alice	505	“ No , only a changed sex , ”
152368	152389	152395	152395	Philip	646	“ we contemplate for the most part young men who do n't care for anything they ought to care for . ”
152390	152393	152395	152395	Philip	646	“ Well , ”
152400	152432	152366	152366	Alice	505	“ I care for some things , you and Ruth for instance ; perhaps I ought not to . Perhaps I ought to care for Congress and that sort of thing . ”
152433	152448	152366	152366	Alice	505	“ Do n't be a goose , Philip . I heard from Ruth yesterday . ”
152449	152456	152395	152395	Philip	646	“ Can I see her letter ? ”
152457	152482	152492	152492	Philip	646	“ No , indeed . But I am afraid her hard work is telling on her , together with her anxiety about her father . ”
152483	152490	152492	152492	Philip	646	“ Do you think , Alice , ”
152508	152519	152525	152525	Alice	505	“ that Ruth prefers her profession to -- to marriage ? ”
152520	152523	152525	152525	Alice	505	“ Philip , ”
152545	152566	152706	152709	a school - girl	4869	“ you are as blind as a bat ; Ruth would cut off her right hand for you this minute . ”
152711	152717	152773	152774	the Squire	784	hand--“Philip , June , 186- . ”
152768	152771	152773	152774	the Squire	784	“ But , ”
152776	152787	152773	152774	the Squire	784	“ do you mean to abandon your land in Pennsylvania ? ”
152805	152821	152773	152774	the Squire	784	“ Has n't it good timber , and does n't the railroad almost touch it ? ”
152822	152837	152773	152774	the Squire	784	“ I ca n't do anything with it now . Perhaps I can sometime . ”
152838	152851	152914	152914	Philip	646	“ What is your reason for supposing that there is coal there ? ”
152852	152913	152773	152774	the Squire	784	“ The opinion of the best geologist I could consult , my own observation of the country , and the little veins of it we found . I feel certain it is there . I shall find it some day . I know it . If I can only keep the land till I make money enough to try again . ”
152943	152951	152959	152960	the Squire	784	“ Does n't it look like it ? ”
152952	152957	153066	153067	the Squire	784	“ It certainly does , ”
153053	153064	153066	153067	the Squire	784	“ I do n't see that there is much risk , ”
153072	153110	153206	153206	he	519	“ The timber is worth more than the mortgage ; and if that coal seam does run there , it 's a magnificent fortune . Would you like to try it again in the spring , Phil ? ”
153191	153205	153206	153206	he	519	“ To be sure , I only care about it for the boy , ”
153221	153226	153362	153363	the children	788	“ take a chance . ”
153351	153360	153532	153532	she	439	“ Philip has come , Philip has come , ”
153516	153521	153532	153532	she	439	“ Philip has come . ”
153522	153531	153567	153567	Ruth	439	“ I am glad for father 's sake , ”
153537	153565	153567	153567	Ruth	439	“ that thee has come . I can see that he depends greatly upon what thee can do . He thinks women wo n't hold out long , ”
153577	153588	153632	153632	his	646	“ And are n't you tired sometimes of the struggle ? ”
153589	153618	153629	153629	Philip	646	“ Tired ? Yes , everybody is tired I suppose . But it is a glorious profession . And would you want me to be dependent , Philip ? ”
153619	153627	153653	153653	Ruth	439	“ Well , yes , a little , ”
153641	153651	153666	153666	he	646	“ On what , for instance , just now ? ”
153661	153665	153721	153721	he	646	“ Why , on-- ”
153713	153720	153721	153721	he	646	“ I do n't mean depend , ”
153725	153742	153855	153855	she	439	“ But I love you , that 's all . Am I nothing -- to you ? ”
153868	153871	153914	153915	young Eli	479	“ Everything . ”
153903	153912	153924	153924	Ruth	439	“ Oh ! Philip , come out here , ”
153946	153951	153924	153924	Ruth	439	“ Philip has come . ”
153959	153964	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	Harry--“The trial begins tomorrow . ”
154087	154090	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Well , ”
154095	154203	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ I do n't know but you are more or less right , there . Now let 's figure up a little on , the preliminaries . I think Congress always tries to do as near right as it can , according to its lights . A man ca n't ask any fairer than that . The first preliminary it always starts out on , is to clean itself , so to speak . It will arraign two or three dozen of its members , or maybe four or five dozen , for taking bribes to vote for this and that and the other bill last winter . ”
154204	154215	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ It goes up into the dozens , does it ? ”
154216	154350	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Well , yes ; in a free country likes ours , where any man can run for Congress and anybody can vote for him , you ca n't expect immortal purity all the time -- it ai n't in nature . Sixty or eighty or a hundred and fifty people are bound to get in who are not angels in disguise , as young Hicks the correspondent says ; but still it is a very good average ; very good indeed . As long as it averages as well as that , I think we can feel very well satisfied . Even in these days , when people growl so much and the newspapers are so out of patience , there is still a very respectable minority of honest men in Congress . ”
154351	154367	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Why a respectable minority of honest men ca n't do any good , Colonel . ”
154368	154376	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Oh , yes it can , too ”
154377	154382	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Why , how ? ”
154383	154393	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Oh , in many ways , many ways . ”
154394	154401	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ But what are the ways ? ”
154402	154442	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Well -- I do n't know -- it is a question that requires time ; a body ca n't answer every question right off - hand . But it does do good . I am satisfied of that . ”
154443	154461	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ All right , then ; grant that it does good ; go on with the preliminaries . ”
154462	154496	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ That is what I am coming to . First , as I said , they will try a lot of members for taking money for votes . That will take four weeks . ”
154497	154543	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Yes , that 's like last year ; and it is a sheer waste of the time for which the nation pays those men to work -- that is what that is . And it pinches when a body 's got a bill waiting . ”
154544	154647	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ A waste of time , to purify the fountain of public law ? Well , I never heard anybody express an idea like that before . But if it were , it would still be the fault of the minority , for the majority do n't institute these proceedings . There is where that minority becomes an obstruction -- but still one ca n't say it is on the wrong side.--Well , after they have finished the bribery cases , they will take up cases of members who have bought their seats with money . That will take another four weeks . ”
154648	154666	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Very good ; go on . You have accounted for two - thirds of the session . ”
154667	154741	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Next they will try each other for various smaller irregularities , like the sale of appointments to West Point cadetships , and that sort of thing -- mere trifling pocket - money enterprises that might better be passed over in silence , perhaps , but then one of our Congresses can never rest easy till it has thoroughly purified itself of all blemishes -- and that is a thing to be applauded . ”
154742	154756	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ How long does it take to disinfect itself of these minor impurities ? ”
154757	154766	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Well , about two weeks , generally . ”
154767	154838	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ So Congress always lies helpless in quarantine ten weeks of a session . That 's encouraging . Colonel , poor Laura will never get any benefit from our bill . Her trial will be over before Congress has half purified itself.--And does n't it occur to you that by the time it has expelled all its impure members there may not be enough members left to do business legally ? ”
154839	154850	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Why I did not say Congress would expel anybody . ”
154851	154859	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Well wo n't it expel anybody ? ”
154860	154879	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Not necessarily . Did it last year ? It never does . That would not be regular . ”
154880	154894	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Then why waste all the session in that tomfoolery of trying members ? ”
154895	154909	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ It is usual ; it is customary ; the country requires it . ”
154910	154921	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Then the country is a fool , I think . ”
154922	154937	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Oh , no . The country thinks somebody is going to be expelled . ”
154938	154953	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Well , when nobody is expelled , what does the country think then ? ”
154954	155000	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ By that time , the thing has strung out so long that the country is sick and tired of it and glad to have a change on any terms . But all that inquiry is not lost . It has a good moral effect . ”
155001	155012	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Who does it have a good moral effect on ? ”
155013	155104	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Well -- I do n't know . On foreign countries , I think . We have always been under the gaze of foreign countries . There is no country in the world , sir , that pursues corruption as inveterately as we do . There is no country in the world whose representatives try each other as much as ours do , or stick to it as long on a stretch . I think there is something great in being a model for the whole civilized world , Washington . ”
155105	155118	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ You do n't mean a model ; you mean an example . ”
155119	155158	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Well , it 's all the same ; it 's just the same thing . It shows that a man ca n't be corrupt in this country without sweating for it , I can tell you that . ”
155159	155176	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Hang it , Colonel , you just said we never punish anybody for villainous practices . ”
155177	155215	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ But good God we try them , do n't we ! Is it nothing to show a disposition to sift things and bring people to a strict account ? I tell you it has its effect . ”
155216	155255	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Oh , bother the effect!--What is it they do do ? How do they proceed ? You know perfectly well -- and it is all bosh , too . Come , now , how do they proceed ? ”
155256	155456	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Why they proceed right and regular -- and it ai n't bosh , Washington , it ai n't bosh . They appoint a committee to investigate , and that committee hears evidence three weeks , and all the witnesses on one side swear that the accused took money or stock or something for his vote . Then the accused stands up and testifies that he may have done it , but he was receiving and handling a good deal of money at the time and he does n't remember this particular circumstance -- at least with sufficient distinctness to enable him to grasp it tangibly . So of course the thing is not proven -- and that is what they say in the verdict . They do n't acquit , they do n't condemn . They just say , ' Charge not proven . ' It leaves the accused in a kind of a shaky condition before the country , it purifies Congress , it satisfies everybody , and it does n't seriously hurt anybody . It has taken a long time to perfect our system , but it is the most admirable in the world , now . ”
155457	155511	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ So one of those long stupid investigations always turns out in that lame silly way . Yes , you are correct . I thought maybe you viewed the matter differently from other people . Do you think a Congress of ours could convict the devil of anything if he were a member ? ”
155512	155602	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ My dear boy , do n't let these damaging delays prejudice you against Congress . Do n't use such strong language ; you talk like a newspaper . Congress has inflicted frightful punishments on its members -- now you know that . When they tried Mr. Fairoaks , and a cloud of witnesses proved him to be -- well , you know what they proved him to be -- and his own testimony and his own confessions gave him the same character , what did Congress do then?--come ! ”
155603	155611	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Well , what did Congress do ? ”
155612	155675	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ You know what Congress did , Washington . Congress intimated plainly enough , that they considered him almost a stain upon their body ; and without waiting ten days , hardly , to think the thing over , they rose up and hurled at him a resolution declaring that they disapproved of his conduct ! Now you know that , Washington . ”
155676	155719	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ It was a terrific thing -- there is no denying that . If he had been proven guilty of theft , arson , licentiousness , infanticide , and defiling graves , I believe they would have suspended him for two days . ”
155720	155761	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ You can depend on it , Washington . Congress is vindictive , Congress is savage , sir , when it gets waked up once . It will go to any length to vindicate its honor at such a time . ”
155762	155834	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Ah well , we have talked the morning through , just as usual in these tiresome days of waiting , and we have reached the same old result ; that is to say , we are no better off than when we began . The land bill is just as far away as ever , and the trial is closer at hand . Let 's give up everything and die . ”
155835	155880	154092	154093	the Colonel	6205	“ Die and leave the Duchess to fight it out all alone ? Oh , no , that wo n't do . Come , now , do n't talk so . It is all going to come out right . Now you 'll see . ”
155881	155930	156028	156028	He	382	“ It never will , Colonel , never in the world . Something tells me that . I get more tired and more despondent every day . I do n't see any hope ; life is only just a trouble . I am so miserable , these days ! ”
156031	156063	156075	156075	he	382	“ Do n't give up the ship , my boy -- don't do it . The wind 's bound to fetch around and set in our favor . I know it . ”
156100	156215	156222	156223	The Colonel	6205	“ Lord bless us , this is all nonsense ! Night does n't last always ; day has got to break some time or other . Every silver lining has a cloud behind it , as the poet says ; and that remark has always cheered me ; though -- I never could see any meaning to it . Everybody uses it , though , and everybody gets comfort out of it . I wish they would start something fresh . Come , now , let 's cheer up ; there 's been as good fish in the sea as there are now . It shall never be said that Beriah Sellers-- Come in ? ”
156233	156449	156222	156223	The Colonel	6205	“ I said it ! Never give up the ship ! The trial 's postponed till February , and we 'll save the child yet . Bless my life , what lawyers they have in New - York ! Give them money to fight with and the ghost of an excuse , and they : would manage to postpone anything in this world , unless it might be the millennium or something like that . Now for work again my boy . The trial will last to the middle of March , sure ; Congress ends the fourth of March . Within three days of the end of the session they will be done putting through the preliminaries then they will be ready for national business . Our bill will go through in forty - eight hours , then , and we 'll telegraph a million dollars to the jury -- to the lawyers , I mean -- and the verdict of the jury will be ' Accidental murder resulting from justifiable insanity'--or something to , that effect , something to that effect.--Everything is dead sure , now . Come , what is the matter ? What are you wilting down like that , for ? You must n't be a girl , you know . ”
156450	156590	156702	156702	he	4910	“ Oh , Colonel , I am become so used to troubles , so used to failures , disappointments , hard luck of all kinds , that a little good news breaks me right down . Everything has been so hopeless that now I ca n't stand good news at all . It is too good to be true , anyway . Do n't you see how our bad luck has worked on me ? My hair is getting gray , and many nights I do n't sleep at all . I wish it was all over and we could rest . I wish we could lie down and just forget everything , and let it all be just a dream that is done and ca n't come back to trouble us any more . I am so tired . ”
156591	156700	156714	156715	his companion	4365	“ Ah , poor child , do n't talk like that - cheer up -- there 's daylight ahead . Do n't give up . You 'll have Laura again , and -- Louise , and your mother , and oceans and oceans of money -- and then you can go away , ever so far away somewhere , if you want to , and forget all about this infernal place . And by George I 'll go with you ! I 'll go with you -- now there 's my word on it . Cheer up . I 'll run out and tell the friends the news . ”
156725	156771	156783	156783	he	4910	“ I think you are the best soul and the noblest I ever knew , Colonel Sellers ! and if the people only knew you as I do , you would not be tagging around here a nameless man -- you would be in Congress . ”
156795	156855	156884	156884	he	382	“ I have always been a friend of your family , Washington , and I think I have always tried to do right as between man and man , according to my lights . Now I do n't think there has ever been anything in my conduct that should make you feel justified in saying a thing like that . ”
156889	156912	156884	156884	he	382	“ Why , honestly , I only meant to compliment him -- indeed I would not have hurt him for the world . ”
156926	156928	157166	157166	he	382	“ preliminaries ”
157160	157164	157841	157842	Mr. Dilworthy	529	“ the season , ”
157833	157839	157982	157982	He	529	“ If this person Noble , ”
157860	157981	158178	158179	Mr. Dilworthy	529	“ merely desired to sacrifice me.--I would willingly offer up my political life on the altar of my dear State 's weal , I would be glad and grateful to do it ; but when he makes of me but a cloak to hide his deeper designs , when he proposes to strike through me at the heart of my beloved State , all the lion in me is roused -- and I say , Here I stand , solitary and alone , but unflinching , unquailing , thrice armed with my sacred trust ; and whoso passes , to do evil to this fair domain that looks to me for protection , must do so over my dead body . ”
158184	158199	158596	158597	Elderly people	4998	“ I feel a good deal relieved , now , a great deal relieved . ”

I have been asking myself as I sat here , Where am I ? Am I in some far - off monarchy , looking upon little princes and princesses ? No . Am I in some populous centre of my own country , where the choicest children of the land have been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize ? No . Am I in some strange foreign clime where the children are marvels that we know not of ? No . Then where am I ? Yes -- where am I ? I am in a simple , remote , unpretending settlement of my own dear State , and these are the children of the noble and virtuous men who have made me what I am ! My soul is lost in wonder at the thought ! And I humbly thank Him to whom we are but as worms of the dust , that he has been pleased to call me to serve such men ! Earth has no higher , no grander position for me . Let kings and emperors keep their tinsel crowns , I want them not ; my heart is here ! “

When he arrived at the State capital at midnight Mr. Noble came and held a three - hours ' conference with him , and then as he was about leaving said : “

The case of the State of New York against Laura Hawkins was finally set down for trial on the 15th day of February , less than a year after the shooting of George Selby . If the public had almost forgotten the existence of Laura and her crime , they were reminded of all the details of the murder by the newspapers , which for some days had been announcing the approaching trial . But they had not forgotten . The sex , the age , the beauty of the prisoner ; her high social position in Washington , the unparalled calmness with which the crime was committed had all conspired to fix the event in the public mind , although nearly three hundred and sixty - five subsequent murders had occurred to vary the monotony of metropolitan life . No , the public read from time to time of the lovely prisoner , languishing in the city prison , the tortured victim of the law 's delay ; and as the months went by it was natural that the horror of her crime should become a little indistinct in memory , while the heroine of it should be invested with a sort of sentimental interest . Perhaps her counsel had calculated on this . Perhaps it was by their advice that Laura had interested herself in the unfortunate criminals who shared her prison confinement , and had done not a little to relieve , from her own purse , the necessities of some of the poor creatures . That she had done this , the public read in the journals of the day , and the simple announcement cast a softening light upon her character . The court room was crowded at an early hour , before the arrival of judges , lawyers and prisoner . There is no enjoyment so keen to certain minds as that of looking upon the slow torture of a human being on trial for life , except it be an execution ; there is no display of human ingenuity , wit and power so fascinating as that made by trained lawyers in the trial of an important case , nowhere else is exhibited such subtlety , acumen , address , eloquence . All the conditions of intense excitement meet in a murder trial . The awful issue at stake gives significance to the lightest word or look . How the quick eyes of the spectators rove from the stolid jury to the keen lawyers , the impassive judge , the anxious prisoner . Nothing is lost of the sharp wrangle of the counsel on points of law , the measured decision 's of the bench ; the duels between the attorneys and the witnesses . The crowd sways with the rise and fall of the shifting testimony , in sympathetic interest , and hangs upon the dicta of the judge in breathless silence . It speedily takes sides for or against the accused , and recognizes as quickly its favorites among the lawyers . Nothing delights it more than the sharp retort of a witness and the discomfiture of an obnoxious attorney . A joke , even if it be a lame one , is no where so keenly relished or quickly applauded as in a murder trial . Within the bar the young lawyers and the privileged hangers - on filled all the chairs except those reserved at the table for those engaged in the case . Without , the throng occupied all the seats , the window ledges and the standing room . The atmosphere was already something horrible . It was the peculiar odor of a criminal court , as if it were tainted by the presence , in different persons , of all the crimes that men and women can commit . There was a little stir when the Prosecuting Attorney , with two assistants , made his way in , seated himself at the table , and spread his papers before him . There was more stir when the counsel of the defense appeared . They were Mr. Braham , the senior , and Mr. Quiggle and Mr. O'Keefe , the juniors . Everybody in the court room knew Mr. Braham , the great criminal lawyer , and he was not unaware that he was the object of all eyes as he moved to his place , bowing to his friends in the bar . A large but rather spare man , with broad shoulders and a massive head , covered with chestnut curls which fell down upon his coat collar and which he had a habit of shaking as a lion is supposed to shake his mane . His face was clean shaven , and he had a wide mouth and rather small dark eyes , set quite too near together . Mr. Braham wore a brown frock coat buttoned across his breast , with a rose - bud in the upper buttonhole , and light pantaloons . A diamond stud was seen to flash from his bosom ; and as he seated himself and drew off his gloves a heavy seal ring was displayed upon his white left hand . Mr. Braham having seated himself , deliberately surveyed the entire house , made a remark to one of his assistants , and then taking an ivory - handled knife from his pocket began to pare his finger nails , rocking his chair backwards and forwards slowly . A moment later Judge O'Shaunnessy entered at the rear door and took his seat in one of the chairs behind the bench ; a gentleman in black broadcloth , with sandy hair , inclined to curl , a round , reddish and rather jovial face , sharp rather than intellectual , and with a self - sufficient air . His career had nothing remarkable in it . He was descended from a long line of Irish Kings , and he was the first one of them who had ever come into his kingdom -- the kingdom of such being the city of New York . He had , in fact , descended so far and so low that he found himself , when a boy , a sort of street Arab in that city ; but he had ambition and native shrewdness , and he speedily took to boot - polishing , and newspaper hawking , became the office and errand boy of a law firm , picked up knowledge enough to get some employment in police courts , was admitted to the bar , became a rising young politician , went to the legislature , and was finally elected to the bench which he now honored . In this democratic country he was obliged to conceal his royalty under a plebeian aspect . Judge O'Shaunnessy never had a lucrative practice nor a large salary but he had prudently laid away money -- believing that a dependant judge can never be impartial -- and he had lands and houses to the value of three or four hundred thousand dollars . Had he not helped to build and furnish this very Court House ? Did he not know that the very “
161493	161522	160236	160236	You	9014	” which his judgeship used cost the city the sum of one thousand dollars ? As soon as the judge was seated , the court was opened with the “
161528	161953	160236	160236	You	9014	” of the officer in his native language , the case called , and the sheriff was directed to bring in the prisoner . In the midst of a profound hush Laura entered , leaning on the arm of the officer , and was conducted to a seat by her counsel . She was followed by her mother and by Washington Hawkins , who were given seats near her . Laura was very pale , but this pallor heightened the lustre of her large eyes and gave a touching sadness to her expressive face . She was dressed in simple black , with exquisite taste , and without an ornament . The thin lace vail which partially covered her face did not so much conceal as heighten her beauty . She would not have entered a drawing room with more self - poise , nor a church with more haughty humility . There was in her manner or face neither shame nor boldness , and when she took her seat in full view of half the spectators , her eyes were downcast . A murmur of admiration ran through the room . The newspaper reporters made their pencils fly . Mr. Braham again swept his eyes over the house as if in approval . When Laura at length raised her eyes a little , she saw Philip and Harry within the bar , but she gave no token of recognition . The clerk then read the indictment , which was in the usual form . It charged Laura Hawkins , in effect , with the premeditated murder of George Selby , by shooting him with a pistol , with a revolver , shotgun , rifle , repeater , breech - loader , cannon , six - shooter , with a gun , or some other weapon ; with killing him with a slung - shot , a bludgeon , carving knife , bowie knife , pen knife , rolling pin , car , hook , dagger , hair pin , with a hammer , with a screw - driver , with a nail , and with all other weapons and utensils whatsoever , at the Southern hotel and in all other hotels and places wheresoever , on the thirteenth day of March and all other days of the Christian era wheresoever . Laura stood while the long indictment was read ; and at the end , in response to the inquiry , of the judge , she said in a clear , low voice ; “
161957	161981	160236	160236	You	9014	” She sat down and the court proceeded to impanel a jury . The first man called was Michael Lanigan , saloon keeper . “

162007	162012	162014	162014	you	5064	” said Mr. Lanigan . “

162240	162271	162273	162273	you	5064	” Mr. Braham submitted that the man was disqualified . Judge thought not . Point argued . Challenged peremptorily , and set aside . Ethan Dobb , cart - driver . “

Have neither formed nor expressed an opinion . Never had heard of the case . Believed in hangin ' for them that deserved it . Could read if it was necessary . Mr. Braham objected . The man was evidently bloody minded . Challenged peremptorily . Larry O'Toole , contractor . A showily dressed man of the style known as “

162618	162619	162659	162660	the man	5861	” “
162629	162656	162659	162660	the man	5861	” ( Laughter from the crowd , approving smiles from his Honor and Mr. Braham . ) Juror sworn in . Mr. Braham whispered to O'Keefe , “
162662	162685	162687	162687	you	5064	” Avery Hicks , pea - nut peddler . Did he ever hear of this case ? The man shook his head . “
162690	162691	162687	162687	you	5064	” “
162694	162695	162659	162660	the man	5861	” “
162702	162703	162771	162771	you	5064	” “
162706	162725	162771	162771	you	5064	” He was about to be sworn , when the district attorney turning to him carelessly , remarked , “
162733	162734	162748	162748	I	0	” “
162737	162747	162752	162752	you	5064	” said the man , pointing to the door . “
162759	162760	162748	162748	I	0	” “
162764	162769	162771	162771	you	5064	” explained the man . “
162777	162783	162791	162792	Fresh baked	733	” roared the prosecuting officer . “
162789	162790	162804	162804	you	5064	” “
162807	162813	162832	162832	him	5086	” The man was discharged . “
162825	162829	162832	162832	him	5086	” whispered Braham . “
162849	163054	163274	163275	Henry Brierly	393	” The result of the whole day 's work was the selection of only two jurors . These however were satisfactory to Mr. Braham . He had kept off all those he did not know . No one knew better than this great criminal lawyer that the battle was fought on the selection of the jury . The subsequent examination of witnesses , the eloquence expended on the jury are all for effect outside . At least that is the theory of Mr. Braham . But human nature is a queer thing , he admits ; sometimes jurors are unaccountably swayed , be as careful as you can in choosing them . It was four weary days before this jury was made up , but when it was finally complete , it did great credit to the counsel for the defence . So far as Mr. Braham knew , only two could read , one of whom was the foreman , Mr. Braham 's friend , the showy contractor . Low foreheads and heavy faces they all had ; some had a look of animal cunning , while the most were only stupid . The entire panel formed that boasted heritage commonly described as the “
163060	163273	163274	163275	Henry Brierly	393	” The District Attorney , Mr. McFlinn , opened the case for the state . He spoke with only the slightest accent , one that had been inherited but not cultivated . He contented himself with a brief statement of the case . The state would prove that Laura Hawkins , the prisoner at the bar , a fiend in the form of a beautiful woman , shot dead George Selby , a Southern gentleman , at the time and place described . That the murder was in cold blood , deliberate and without provocation ; that it had been long premeditated and threatened ; that she had followed the deceased from Washington to commit it . All this would be proved by unimpeachable witnesses . The attorney added that the duty of the jury , however painful it might be , would be plain and simple . They were citizens , husbands , perhaps fathers . They knew how insecure life had become in the metropolis . Tomorrow our own wives might be widows , their own children orphans , like the bereaved family in yonder hotel , deprived of husband and father by the jealous hand of some murderous female . The attorney sat down , and the clerk called ? “

Requested by the District Attorney to tell the jury all he knew about the killing , he narrated the circumstances substantially as the reader already knows them . He accompanied Miss Hawkins to New York at her request , supposing she was coming in relation to a bill then pending in Congress , to secure the attendance of absent members . Her note to him was here shown . She appeared to be very much excited at the Washington station . After she had asked the conductor several questions , he heard her say , “
163690	163694	163702	163702	Nobody	5874	” Witness asked her “
163697	163701	163702	163702	Nobody	5874	” and she replied “
163704	163869	163959	163960	civil engineer	1541	” Did not see her during the night . They traveled in a sleeping car . In the morning she appeared not to have slept , said she had a headache . In crossing the ferry she asked him about the shipping in sight ; he pointed out where the Cunarders lay when in port . They took a cup of coffee that morning at a restaurant . She said she was anxious to reach the Southern Hotel where Mr. Simons , one of the absent members , was staying , before he went out . She was entirely self - possessed , and beyond unusual excitement did not act unnaturally . After she had fired twice at Col . Selby , she turned the pistol towards her own breast , and witness snatched it from her . She had been a great deal with Selby in Washington , appeared to be infatuated with him . ( Cross - examined by Mr. Braham . ) “
163877	163897	163959	163960	civil engineer	1541	” ( Mr. Braham had in perfection this lawyer 's trick of annoying a witness , by drawling out the “
163900	163935	163950	163951	Civil Engineer	1541	” as if unable to recall the name , until the witness is sufficiently aggravated , and then suddenly , with a rising inflection , flinging his name at him with startling unexpectedness . ) “

163955	163956	163989	163989	sir	980	” “
163978	163986	163989	163989	sir	980	” ( Smiles by the jury ) . “
163991	163997	164001	164001	you	980	” said Harry , reddening . “
164006	164007	164013	164013	I	0	” “
164022	164023	164037	164037	you	980	” “

164073	164076	164079	164079	sir	980	” Admitted . “
164081	164086	164089	164089	friends	5905	” said Harry hesitatingly , “
164091	164092	164093	164093	You	980	” “
164099	164116	164142	164142	You	980	” ( sarcastically . ) The jury were beginning to hate this neatly dressed young sprig . “
164130	164141	164154	164154	She	700	” Harry blushed and stammered and looked at the judge . “
164148	164153	164156	164156	she	700	” said His Honor . “
164162	164163	164173	164173	you	980	” “
164195	164205	164210	164210	sir	980	” roared Mr. Braham in a voice of thunder . “
164216	164221	164226	164226	sir	980	” protested the witness . “
164228	164234	164226	164226	sir	980	” said Mr. Braham severely . “
164238	164244	164246	164246	you	980	” said the District Attorney . “
164264	164265	164246	164246	you	980	” “
164270	164275	164246	164246	you	980	” answered Harry earnestly . “
164284	164464	164661	164661	I	0	” nodded Mr. Braham to the jury . The prosecution then put upon the stand the other witnesses of the shooting at the hotel , and the clerk and the attending physicians . The fact of the homicide was clearly established . Nothing new was elicited , except from the clerk , in reply to a question by Mr. Braham , the fact that when the prisoner enquired for Col . Selby she appeared excited and there was a wild look in her eyes . The dying deposition of Col . Selby was then produced . It set forth Laura 's threats , but there was a significant addition to it , which the newspaper report did not have . It seemed that after the deposition was taken as reported , the Colonel was told for the first time by his physicians that his wounds were mortal . He appeared to be in great mental agony and fear ; and said he had not finished his deposition . He added , with great difficulty and long pauses these words . “
164507	164660	164669	164670	Good God	5115	” That was all . He fainted and did not revive again . The Washington railway conductor testified that the prisoner had asked him if a gentleman and his family went out on the evening train , describing the persons he had since learned were Col . Selby and family . Susan Cullum , colored servant at Senator Dilworthy 's , was sworn . Knew Col . Selby . Had seen him come to the house often , and be alone in the parlor with Miss Hawkins . He came the day but one before he was shot . She let him in . He appeared flustered like . She heard talking in the parlor , ' peared like it was quarrelin ' . Was afeared sumfin ' was wrong : Just put her ear to -- the -- keyhole of the back parlor - door . Heard a man 's voice , “
164672	164685	164693	164693	you	0	” quite beggin ' like . Heard -- young Miss ' voice , “
164705	164721	164789	164789	Lord	8678	” Then he rushes outen the house , I goes in -- and I says , “
164727	164788	164693	164693	you	0	” She was a standin ' like a tiger , her eyes flashin ' . I come right out . This was the substance of Susan 's testimony , which was not shaken in the least by severe cross - examination . In reply to Mr. Braham 's question , if the prisoner did not look insane , Susan said , “
164801	164966	164693	164693	you	0	” Washington Hawkins was sworn . The pistol , identified by the officer as the one used in the homicide , was produced Washington admitted that it was his . She had asked him for it one morning , saying she thought she had heard burglars the night before . Admitted that he never had heard burglars in the house . Had anything unusual happened just before that ? Nothing that he remembered . Did he accompany her to a reception at Mrs. Shoonmaker 's a day or two before ? Yes . What occurred ? Little by little it was dragged out of the witness that Laura had behaved strangely there , appeared to be sick , and he had taken her home . Upon being pushed he admitted that she had afterwards confessed that she saw Selby there . And Washington volunteered the statement that Selby , was a black - hearted villain . The District Attorney said , with some annoyance ; “
164975	165308	165793	165793	Bear	740	” The defence declined to examine Mr. Hawkins at present . The case for the prosecution was closed . Of the murder there could not be the least doubt , or that the prisoner followed the deceased to New York with a murderous intent . On the evidence the jury must convict , and might do so without leaving their seats . This was the condition of the case two days after the jury had been selected . A week had passed since the trial opened ; and a Sunday had intervened . The public who read the reports of the evidence saw no chance for the prisoner 's escape . The crowd of spectators who had watched the trial were moved with the most profound sympathy for Laura . Mr. Braham opened the case for the defence . His manner was subdued , and he spoke in so low a voice that it was only by reason of perfect silence in the court room that he could be heard . He spoke very distinctly , however , and if his nationality could be discovered in his speech it was only in a certain richness and breadth of tone . He began by saying that he trembled at the responsibility he had undertaken ; and he should altogether despair , if he did not see before him a jury of twelve men of rare intelligence , whose acute minds would unravel all the sophistries of the prosecution , men with a sense of honor , which would revolt at the remorseless persecution of this hunted woman by the state , men with hearts to feel for the wrongs of which she was the victim . Far be it from him to cast any suspicion upon the motives of the able , eloquent and ingenious lawyers of the state ; they act officially ; their business is to convict . It is our business , gentlemen , to see that justice is done . “
165430	165782	166269	166269	Gentlemen	1585	“ Gentlemen , I shall ask you to go with me away from this court room and its minions of the law , away from the scene of this tragedy , to a distant , I wish I could say a happier day . The story I have to tell is of a lovely little girl , with sunny hair and laughing eyes , traveling with her parents , evidently people of wealth and refinement , upon a Mississippi steamboat . There is an explosion , one of those terrible catastrophes which leave the imprint of an unsettled mind upon the survivors . Hundreds of mangled remains are sent into eternity . When the wreck is cleared away this sweet little girl is found among the panic stricken survivors in the midst of a scene of horror enough to turn the steadiest brain . Her parents have disappeared . Search even for their bodies is in vain . The bewildered , stricken child -- who can say what changes the fearful event wrought in her tender brain -- clings to the first person who shows her sympathy . It is Mrs. Hawkins , this good lady who is still her loving friend . Laura is adopted into the Hawkins family . Perhaps she forgets in time that she is not their child . She is an orphan . No , gentlemen , I will not deceive you , she is not an orphan . Worse than that . There comes another day of agony . She knows that her father lives . Who is he , where is he ? Alas , I can not tell you . Through the scenes of this painful history he flits here and there a lunatic ! If he seeks his daughter , it is the purposeless search of a lunatic , as one who wanders bereft of reason , crying where is my child ? Laura seeks her father . In vain just as she is about to find him , again and again - he disappears , he is gone , he vanishes . “
166037	166268	166457	166458	Mrs. Hawkins	365	“ Years pass . She is in Washington , apparently the happy favorite of a brilliant society . Her family have become enormously rich by one of those sudden turns in fortune that the inhabitants of America are familiar with -- the discovery of immense mineral wealth in some wild lands owned by them . She is engaged in a vast philanthropic scheme for the benefit of the poor , by the use of this wealth . But , alas , even here and now , the same relentless fate pursued her . The villain Selby appears again upon the scene , as if on purpose to complete the ruin of her life . He appeared to taunt her with her dishonor , he threatened exposure if she did not become again the mistress of his passion . Gentlemen , do you wonder if this woman , thus pursued , lost her reason , was beside herself with fear , and that her wrongs preyed upon her mind until she was no longer responsible for her acts ? I turn away my head as one who would not willingly look even upon the just vengeance of Heaven . ( Mr. Braham paused as if overcome by his emotions . Mrs. Hawkins and Washington were in tears , as were many of the spectators also . The jury looked scared . ) “
166348	166456	166457	166458	Mrs. Hawkins	365	” When Mr. Braham sat down , he felt that he had the jury with him . A burst of applause followed , which the officer promptly , suppressed . Laura , with tears in her eyes , turned a grateful look upon her counsel . All the women among the spectators saw the tears and wept also . They thought as they also looked at Mr. Braham , how handsome he is ! Mrs. Hawkins took the stand . She was somewhat confused to be the target of so many , eyes , but her honest and good face at once told in Laura 's favor . “
166460	166465	166467	166467	you	365	” said Mr. Braham , “
166481	166482	166483	166483	I	0	” “
166486	166496	166510	166510	I	0	” said Mr. McFlinn ; rising to his feet . “
166526	166527	166530	166530	you	365	” “
166539	166544	166548	166549	the court	1217	” asked the judge . “
166551	166559	166618	166618	your	365	” said Mr. Braham , rising impressively , “
166668	166669	166618	166618	your	365	” “
166678	166684	166727	166728	the court	1217	” said the District Attorney . “
166717	166718	166727	166728	the court	1217	” “
166721	166726	166727	166728	the court	1217	” suggested the judge , “
166745	166746	166727	166728	the court	1217	” “
166755	166756	166727	166728	the court	1217	” “
166759	167079	167081	167081	she	5148	” And argument his honor did hear , or pretend to , for two whole days , from all the counsel in turn , in the course of which the lawyers read contradictory decisions enough to perfectly establish both sides , from volume after volume , whole libraries in fact , until no mortal man could say what the rules were . The question of insanity in all its legal aspects was of course drawn into the discussion , and its application affirmed and denied . The case was felt to turn upon the admission or rejection of this evidence . It was a sort of test trial of strength between the lawyers . At the end the judge decided to admit the testimony , as the judge usually does in such cases , after a sufficient waste of time in what are called arguments . Mrs. Hawkins was allowed to go on . CHAPTER LVI . Mrs. Hawkins slowly and conscientiously , as if every detail of her family history was important , told the story of the steamboat explosion , of the finding and adoption of Laura . Silas , that is Mr. Hawkins , and she always loved Laura , as if she had been their own child . She then narrated the circumstances of Laura 's supposed marriage , her abandonment and long illness , in a manner that touched all hearts . Laura had been a different woman since then . Cross - examined . At the time of first finding Laura on the steamboat , did she notice that Laura 's mind was at all deranged ? She could n't say that she did . After the recovery of Laura from her long illness , did Mrs. Hawkins think there were any signs of insanity about her ? Witness confessed that she did not think of it then . Re - Direct examination . “
167087	167088	167081	167081	she	5148	” “
167095	167205	167081	167081	she	5148	” Washington Hawkins corroborated his mother 's testimony as to Laura 's connection with Col . Selby . He was at Harding during the time of her living there with him . After Col . Selby 's desertion she was almost dead , never appeared to know anything rightly for weeks . He added that he never saw such a scoundrel as Selby . ( Checked by District attorney . ) Had he noticed any change in Laura after her illness ? Oh , yes . Whenever , any allusion was made that might recall Selby to mind , she looked awful -- as if she could kill him . “
167209	167214	167081	167081	she	5148	” said Mr. Braham , “
167227	167228	167081	167081	she	5148	” “
167233	167345	167346	167347	Mr. Sellers	547	” said Washington in confusion . All this was objected to by the district attorney , but it was got before the jury , and Mr. Braham did not care how much it was ruled out after that . Beriah Sellers was the next witness called . The Colonel made his way to the stand with majestic , yet bland deliberation . Having taken the oath and kissed the Bible with a smack intended to show his great respect for that book , he bowed to his Honor with dignity , to the jury with familiarity , and then turned to the lawyers and stood in an attitude of superior attention . “
167352	167357	167358	167359	Beriah Sellers	375	” began Mr. Braham . “
167363	167374	167386	167390	a friend of the family	5153	” was the courteous acknowledgment that the lawyer was correct . “
167392	167393	167453	167454	Mr. Sellers	547	” “
167447	167448	167459	167461	a Major Lackland	5158	” “
167463	167464	167558	167558	I	0	” “
167560	167561	167574	167574	Colonel	1066	” “
167576	167599	167659	167659	I	0	” There was an almost imperceptible sense of pleasure betrayed in the Colonel 's face at this prompt acknowledgment of his title . “
167662	167666	167679	167680	the counsel	9055	sir”---- The Judge . “
167682	167683	167687	167687	your	1066	” “
167692	167700	167721	167721	I	0	” continued the Colonel in confidential explanation , “
167725	167737	167739	167739	you	1066	sir”-- A bundle of letters was here handed to the witness . “
167747	167748	167864	167864	Colonel	1066	” “
167862	167863	168114	168115	Your Honor	5139	” “
167879	168113	168117	168117	I	0	” The letters were a portion of the correspondence of Major Lackland with Silas Hawkins ; parts of them were missing and important letters were referred to that were not here . They related , as the reader knows , to Laura 's father . Lackland had come upon the track of a man who was searching for a lost child in a Mississippi steamboat explosion years before . The man was lame in one leg , and appeared to be flitting from place to place . It seemed that Major Lackland got so close track of him that he was able to describe his personal appearance and learn his name . But the letter containing these particulars was lost . Once he heard of him at a hotel in Washington ; but the man departed , leaving an empty trunk , the day before the major went there . There was something very mysterious in all his movements . Col . Sellers , continuing his testimony , said that he saw this lost letter , but could not now recall the name . Search for the supposed father had been continued by Lackland , Hawkins and himself for several years , but Laura was not informed of it till after the death of Hawkins , for fear of raising false hopes in her mind . Here the District Attorney arose and said , “
168133	168137	168294	168294	You	5199	” Mr. Braham . “
168228	168293	168674	168674	your	5215	” The wrangle continued , waxing hotter and hotter . The Colonel seeing the attention of the counsel and Court entirely withdrawn from him , thought he perceived here his opportunity , turning and beaming upon the jury , he began simply to talk , but as the grandeur of his position grew upon him -- his talk broadened unconsciously into an oratorical vein . “
168676	168771	168782	168783	The witness	9220	” By this time the Colonel had become so warmed up , that his voice , had reached a pitch above that of the contending counsel ; the lawyers suddenly stopped , and they and the Judge turned towards the Colonel and remained for several seconds too surprised at this novel exhibition to speak . In this interval of silence , an appreciation of the situation gradually stole over the audience , and an explosion of laughter followed , in which even the Court and the bar could hardly keep from joining . Sheriff . “
168777	168781	168782	168783	The witness	9220	” The Judge . “
168793	168804	168834	168834	sir	980	” The Colonel turned courteously to the Judge and said , “
168839	168843	168858	168858	You	5215	” The Judge . “
168856	168857	168902	168902	sir	980	” “
168894	168898	168905	168906	Mr. Braham	714	” The Judge . “
168908	168909	168915	168915	you	375	” “
168927	168928	168915	168915	you	375	” “
168937	168940	169013	169013	Question	745	“ State why ”
168941	168971	169013	169013	Question	745	“ I have never heard of his death , sir . It has never come to my knowledge . In fact , sir , as I once said to Governor-- ”
168972	169012	169013	169013	Question	745	“ Will you state to the jury what has been the effect of the knowledge of this wandering and evidently unsettled being , supposed to be her father , upon the mind of Miss Hawkins for so many years ! ”
169025	169034	169046	169046	his	6205	“ Major Sellers , what is your occupation ? ”
169067	169080	169046	169046	his	6205	“ A gentleman , sir . My father used to always say , sir”--
169081	169097	169046	169046	his	6205	“ Capt . Sellers , did you ever see this man , this supposed father ? ”
169098	169120	169046	169046	his	6205	“ No , Sir . But upon one occasion , old Senator Thompson said to me , its my opinion , Colonel Sellers”--
169121	169133	169046	169046	his	6205	“ Did you ever see any body who had seen him ? ”
169134	169147	169046	169046	his	6205	“ No , sir : It was reported around at one time , that”--
169148	169153	169389	169389	his	714	“ That is all . ”
169353	169357	169446	169446	he	391	“ sum up . ”
169458	169462	169446	169446	he	391	“ upper classes . ”
169469	169472	169794	169795	The jury	6624	“ upper classes ”
169640	169793	169854	169854	he	9131	“ Gentlemen ; it is enough for me to look upon the life of this most beautiful and accomplished of her sex , blasted by the heartless villainy of man , without seeing , at the end of it ; the horrible spectacle of a gibbet . Gentlemen , we are all human , we have all sinned , we all have need of mercy . But I do not ask mercy of you who are the guardians of society and of the poor waifs , its sometimes wronged victims ; I ask only that justice which you and I shall need in that last , dreadful hour , when death will be robbed of half its terrors if we can reflect that we have never wronged a human being . Gentlemen , the life of this lovely and once happy girl , this now stricken woman , is in your hands . ”
169828	169838	170607	170607	He	529	“ let her go , she has suffered enough . ”
170610	171028	171039	171039	Washington	700	“ Everything is going right , everything 's going perfectly right . Pretty soon the telegrams will begin to rattle in , and then you 'll see , my boy . Let the jury do what they please ; what difference is it going to make ? To - morrow we can send a million to New York and set the lawyers at work on the judges ; bless your heart they will go before judge after judge and exhort and beseech and pray and shed tears . They always do ; and they always win , too . And they will win this time . They will get a writ of habeas corpus , and a stay of proceedings , and a supersedeas , and a new trial and a nolle prosequi , and there you are ! That 's the routine , and it 's no trick at all to a New York lawyer . That 's the regular routine -- everything 's red tape and routine in the law , you see ; it 's all Greek to you , of course , but to a man who is acquainted with those things it 's mere -- I'll explain it to you sometime . Everything 's going to glide right along easy and comfortable now . You 'll see , Washington , you 'll see how it will be . And then , let me think ..... Dilwortby will be elected to - day , and by day , after to - morrow night he will be in New York ready to put in his shovel -- and you have n't lived in Washington all this time not to know that the people who walk right by a Senator whose term is up without hardly seeing him will be down at the deepo to say ' Welcome back and God bless you ; Senator , I 'm glad to see you , sir ! ' when he comes along back re - elected , you know . Well , you see , his influence was naturally running low when he left here , but now he has got a new six - years ' start , and his suggestions will simply just weigh a couple of tons a - piece day after tomorrow . Lord bless you he could rattle through that habeas corpus and supersedeas and all those things for Laura all by himself if he wanted to , when he gets back . ”
171029	171037	171039	171039	Washington	700	“ I had n't thought of that , ”
171043	171062	170607	170607	He	529	“ but it is so . A newly - elected Senator is a power , I know that . ”
171063	171303	171039	171039	Washington	700	“ Yes indeed he is.--Why it , is just human nature . Look at me . When we first came here , I was Mr. Sellers , and Major Sellers , Captain Sellers , but nobody could ever get it right , somehow ; but the minute our bill went , through the House , I was Col . Sellers every time . And nobody could do enough for me , and whatever I said was wonderful , Sir , it was always wonderful ; I never seemed to say any flat things at all . It was Colonel , wo n't you come and dine with us ; and Colonel why do n't we ever see you at our house ; and the Colonel says this ; and the Colonel says that ; and we know such - and - such is so - and - so because my husband heard Col . Sellers say so . Do n't you see ? Well , the Senate adjourned and left our bill high , and dry , and I 'll be hanged if I warn't Old Sellers from that day , till our bill passed the House again last week . Now I 'm the Colonel again ; and if I were to eat all the dinners I am invited to , I reckon I 'd wear my teeth down level with my gums in a couple of weeks . ”
171304	171326	171517	171517	Washington	700	“ Well I do wonder what you will be to - morrow ; Colonel , after the President signs the bill ! ”
171327	171482	171517	171517	Washington	700	“ General , sir?--General , without a doubt . Yes , sir , tomorrow it will be General , let me congratulate you , sir ; General , you 've done a great work , sir;--you've done a great work for the niggro ; Gentlemen allow me the honor to introduce my friend General Sellers , the humane friend of the niggro . Lord bless me ; you 'll ' see the newspapers say , General Sellers and servants arrived in the city last night and is stopping at the Fifth Avenue ; and General Sellers has accepted a reception and banquet by the Cosmopolitan Club ; you 'll see the General 's opinions quoted , too -- and what the General has to say about the propriety of a new trial and a habeas corpus for the unfortunate Miss Hawkins will not be without weight in influential quarters , I can tell you . ”
171483	171515	171578	171578	Braham	714	“ And I want to be the first to shake your faithful old hand and salute you with your new honors , and I want to do it now -- General ! ”
171584	171621	171631	171631	Sellers	754	“ We feel certain that the verdict will be rendered to - day . Be it good or bad , let it find us ready to make the next move instantly , whatever it may be . ”
171622	171629	171631	171631	Sellers	754	“ That 's the right talk , ”
171633	171660	171666	171667	Mr. Dilworthy	529	“ That Braham 's a wonderful man . He was the only man there that really understood me ; he told me so himself , afterwards . ”
171669	171703	171710	171711	the Colonel	6205	“ I have not only brought over the Great Invincible , but through him a dozen more of the opposition . Shall be re - elected to - day by an overwhelming majority . ”
171704	171708	171710	171711	the Colonel	6205	“ Good again ! ”
171713	171847	171666	171667	Mr. Dilworthy	529	“ That man 's talent for organization is something marvelous . He wanted me to go out there and engineer that thing , but I said , No , Dilworthy , I must be on hand here,--both on Laura 's account and the bill's -- but you 've no trifling genius for organization yourself , said I -- and I was right . You go ahead , said I -- you can fix it -- and so he has . But I claim no credit for that -- if I stiffened up his back - bone a little , I simply put him in the way to make his fight -- didn't undertake it myself . He has captured Noble-- . I consider that a splendid piece of diplomacy -- Splendid , Sir ! ”
171858	171886	171892	171892	Washington	700	“ Jury still out . Laura calm and firm as a statue . The report that the jury have brought her in guilty is false and premature . ”
171887	171890	171917	171917	he	5307	“ Premature ! ”
171897	171913	172148	172148	Washington	700	“ Then they all expect that sort of a verdict , when it comes in . ”
172023	172038	172050	172050	Washington	700	“ Court now coming in after brief recess to hear verdict . Jury ready . ”
172039	172048	172050	172050	Washington	700	“ Oh , I wish they would finish ! ”
172052	172061	172050	172050	Washington	700	“ This suspense is killing me by inches ! ”
172067	172082	172096	172097	the Colonel	6205	“ Another hitch somewhere . Jury want a little more time and further instructions . ”
172083	172094	172133	172133	They	1686	“ Well , well , well , this is trying , ”
172104	172132	172148	172148	Washington	700	“ No dispatch from Dilworthy for two hours , now . Even a dispatch from him would be better than nothing , just to vary this thing . ”
172143	172146	172148	172148	Washington	700	“ Come ! ”
172150	172181	172221	172221	Washington	700	“ I ca n't wait for the telegraph boy to come all the way up here . Let 's go down to Newspaper Row -- meet him on the way . ”
172233	172414	172221	172221	Washington	700	“ Tremendous Sensation ! Startling news from Saint 's Rest ! On first ballot for U. S. Senator , when voting was about to begin , Mr. Noble rose in his place and drew forth a package , walked forward and laid it on the Speaker 's desk , saying , ' This contains $ 7,000 in bank bills and was given me by Senator Dilworthy in his bed - chamber at midnight last night to buy -- my vote for him -- I wish the Speaker to count the money and retain it to pay the expense of prosecuting this infamous traitor for bribery . The whole legislature was stricken speechless with dismay and astonishment . Noble further said that there were fifty members present with money in their pockets , placed there by Dilworthy to buy their votes . Amidst unparalleled excitement the ballot was now taken , and J. W. Smith elected U. S. Senator ; Dilworthy receiving not one vote ! Noble promises damaging exposures concerning Dilworthy and certain measures of his now pending in Congress . “
172420	172425	172221	172221	Washington	700	” exclaimed the Colonel . “
172430	172434	172221	172221	Washington	700	” said Washington . “
172437	172542	172843	172843	Colonel	406	” And they did fly . Long before they got there the newsboys were running ahead of them with Extras , hot from the press , announcing the astounding news . Arrived in the gallery of the Senate , the friends saw a curious spectacle -- every Senator held an Extra in his hand and looked as interested as if it contained news of the destruction of the earth . Not a single member was paying the least attention to the business of the hour . The Secretary , in a loud voice , was just beginning to read the title of a bill : “
172608	172610	172843	172843	Colonel	406	” The President--“Third
172616	172828	172899	172899	they	5321	” The two friends shook in their shoes . Senators threw down their extras and snatched a word or two with each other in whispers . Then the gavel rapped to command silence while the names were called on the ayes and nays . Washington grew paler and paler , weaker and weaker while the lagging list progressed ; and when it was finished , his head fell helplessly forward on his arms . The fight was fought , the long struggle was over , and he was a pauper . Not a man had voted for the bill ! Col . Sellers was bewildered and well nigh paralyzed , himself . But no man could long consider his own troubles in the presence of such suffering as Washington 's . He got him up and supported him -- almost carried him indeed -- out of the building and into a carriage . All the way home Washington lay with his face against the Colonel 's shoulder and merely groaned and wept . The Colonel tried as well as he could under the dreary circumstances to hearten him a little , but it was of no use . Washington was past all hope of cheer , now . He only said : “
172905	172985	173132	173133	the doctors	6505	” Arrived at home , Washington fell into a chair and buried his face in his hands and gave full way to his misery . The Colonel did not know where to turn nor what to do . The servant maid knocked at the door and passed in a telegram , saying it had come while they were gone . The Colonel tore it open and read with the voice of a man - of - war 's broadside : “
172997	173130	173321	173321	Gentlemen	1585	” CHAPTER LVIII . The court room was packed on the morning on which the verdict of the jury was expected , as it had been every day of the trial , and by the same spectators , who had followed its progress with such intense interest . There is a delicious moment of excitement which the frequenter of trials well knows , and which he would not miss for the world . It is that instant when the foreman of the jury stands up to give the verdict , and before he has opened his fateful lips . The court assembled and waited . It was an obstinate jury . It even had another question -- this intelligent jury -- to ask the judge this morning . The question was this : “
173156	173320	173334	173334	We	5327	” There was evidently one jury man who did n't want to waste life , and was willing to stake a general average , as the jury always does in a civil case , deciding not according to the evidence but reaching the verdict by some occult mental process . During the delay the spectators exhibited unexampled patience , finding amusement and relief in the slightest movements of the court , the prisoner and the lawyers . Mr. Braham divided with Laura the attention of the house . Bets were made by the Sheriff 's deputies on the verdict , with large odds in favor of a disagreement . It was afternoon when it was announced that the jury was coming in . The reporters took their places and were all attention ; the judge and lawyers were in their seats ; the crowd swayed and pushed in eager expectancy , as the jury walked in and stood up in silence . Judge . “
173330	173333	173334	173334	We	5327	” Foreman . “
173337	173340	173334	173334	We	5327	” Judge . “
173345	173348	173555	173555	him	5328	” Foreman . “
173352	173553	173555	173555	him	5328	” A shout went up from the entire room and a tumult of cheering which the court in vain attempted to quell . For a few moments all order was lost . The spectators crowded within the bar and surrounded Laura who , calmer than anyone else , was supporting her aged mother , who had almost fainted from excess of joy . And now occurred one of those beautiful incidents which no fiction - writer would dare to imagine , a scene of touching pathos , creditable to our fallen humanity . In the eyes of the women of the audience Mr. Braham was the hero of the occasion ; he had saved the life of the prisoner ; and besides he was such a handsome man . The women could not restrain their long pent - up emotions . They threw themselves upon Mr. Braham in a transport of gratitude ; they kissed him again and again , the young as well as the advanced in years , the married as well as the ardent single women ; they improved the opportunity with a touching self - sacrifice ; in the words of a newspaper of the day they “
173559	173625	173629	173629	Braham	714	” It was something sweet to do ; and it would be sweet for a woman to remember in after years , that she had kissed Braham ! Mr. Braham himself received these fond assaults with the gallantry of his nation , enduring the ugly , and heartily paying back beauty in its own coin . This beautiful scene is still known in New York as “
173631	173710	173629	173629	Braham	714	” When the tumult of congratulation had a little spent itself , and order was restored , Judge O'Shaunnessy said that it now became his duty to provide for the proper custody and treatment of the acquitted . The verdict of the jury having left no doubt that the woman was of an unsound mind , with a kind of insanity dangerous to the safety of the community , she could not be permitted to go at large . “
173723	173728	173778	173778	you	5333	” said the Judge , “
173790	174455	174459	174459	Laura	700	” Laura was overwhelmed and terror - stricken . She had expected to walk forth in freedom in a few moments . The revulsion was terrible . Her mother appeared like one shaken with an ague fit . Laura insane ! And about to be locked up with madmen ! She had never contemplated this . Mr. Graham said he should move at once for a writ of ' habeas corpus ' . But the judge could not do less than his duty , the law must have its way . As in the stupor of a sudden calamity , and not fully comprehending it , Mrs. Hawkins saw Laura led away by the officer . With little space for thought she was rapidly driven to the railway station , and conveyed to the Hospital for Lunatic Criminals . It was only when she was within this vast and grim abode of madness that she realized the horror of her situation . It was only when she was received by the kind physician and read pity in his eyes , and saw his look of hopeless incredulity when she attempted to tell him that she was not insane ; it was only when she passed through the ward to which she was consigned and saw the horrible creatures , the victims of a double calamity , whose dreadful faces she was hereafter to see daily , and was locked into the small , bare room that was to be her home , that all her fortitude forsook her . She sank upon the bed , as soon as she was left alone -- she had been searched by the matron -- and tried to think . But her brain was in a whirl . She recalled Braham 's speech , she recalled the testimony regarding her lunacy . She wondered if she were not mad ; she felt that she soon should be among these loathsome creatures . Better almost to have died , than to slowly go mad in this confinement . --We beg the reader 's pardon . This is not history , which has just been written . It is really what would have occurred if this were a novel . If this were a work of fiction , we should not dare to dispose of Laura otherwise . True art and any attention to dramatic proprieties required it . The novelist who would turn loose upon society an insane murderess could not escape condemnation . Besides , the safety of society , the decencies of criminal procedure , what we call our modern civilization , all would demand that Laura should be disposed of in the manner we have described . Foreigners , who read this sad story , will be unable to understand any other termination of it . But this is history and not fiction . There is no such law or custom as that to which his Honor is supposed to have referred ; Judge O'Shaunnessy would not probably pay any attention to it if there were . There is no Hospital for Insane Criminals ; there is no State commission of lunacy . What actually occurred when the tumult in the court room had subsided the sagacious reader will now learn . Laura left the court room , accompanied by her mother and other friends , amid the congratulations of those assembled , and was cheered as she entered a carriage , and drove away . How sweet was the sunlight , how exhilarating the sense of freedom ! Were not these following cheers the expression of popular approval and affection ? Was she not the heroine of the hour ? It was with a feeling of triumph that Laura reached her hotel , a scornful feeling of victory over society with its own weapons . Mrs. Hawkins shared not at all in this feeling ; she was broken with the disgrace and the long anxiety . “
174461	174465	174489	174489	Mother	6171	” she said , “
174487	174488	174489	174489	Mother	6171	” “
174491	174500	174514	174514	I	0	” replied Laura , speaking with some tenderness , “
174523	174554	174575	174575	I	0	” Mrs. Hawkins was sobbing . This was more cruel than anything else , for she had a dim notion of what it would be to leave Laura to herself . “
174581	174596	174566	174566	You	6171	” A boy brought in a telegraphic despatch . Laura took it and read : “
174610	174639	174655	174655	I	0	” For a moment the words swam before her eyes . The next her eyes flashed fire as she handed the dispatch to her mother and bitterly said , “
174660	174661	174566	174566	You	6171	” “
174668	174686	174566	174566	You	6171	” said Mrs. Hawkins , to whom one grief more or less did not much matter now , “
174700	174701	174566	174566	You	6171	” “
174705	174710	174752	174754	J. Adolphe Griller	761	” replied Laura scornfully , “
174728	174751	174766	174766	I	0	” A servant came to the door to say that there was a gentleman below who wished to speak with Miss Hawkins . “
174755	174765	174910	174910	I	0	” was the name Laura read on the card . “
174784	174909	174921	174921	You	5342	” Mr. Griller entered . He was a small man , slovenly in dress , his tone confidential , his manner wholly void of animation , all his features below the forehead protruding -- particularly the apple of his throat -- hair without a kink in it , a hand with no grip , a meek , hang - dog countenance . He was a falsehood done in flesh and blood ; for while every visible sign about him proclaimed him a poor , witless , useless weakling , the truth was that he had the brains to plan great enterprises and the pluck to carry them through . That was his reputation , and it was a deserved one . He softly said : “
174926	174941	174990	174990	I	0	” Laura bowed . Mr. Griller continued to purr , as softly as before . “
174988	174989	174990	174990	I	0	” “
174998	175003	175028	175028	you	0	” said Laura coldly . “
175035	175036	175063	175063	madam	8180	” “
175059	175060	175112	175112	she	5349	” “
175120	175121	175153	175153	woman	1148	” “
175129	175148	175249	175249	I	0	” asked Laura , beginning in spite of herself to be a little interested as well as amused . “
175225	175248	175274	175274	we	5355	” Laura thought . She hesitated . Why not ? It would give her employment , money . She must do something . “
175282	175283	175308	175308	madam	8180	” “
175310	175347	175308	175308	madam	8180	” The close of the trial released Mr. Harry Brierly and left him free to depart upon his long talked of Pacific - coast mission . He was very mysterious about it , even to Philip . “
175355	175359	175415	175415	You	5357	” he said , “
175421	176110	175415	175415	You	5357	” Philip did hear from Harry a few months afterward . Everything promised splendidly , but there was a little delay . Could Phil let him have a hundred , say , for ninety days ? Philip himself hastened to Philadelphia , and , as soon as the spring opened , to the mine at Ilium , and began transforming the loan he had received from Squire Montague into laborers ' wages . He was haunted with many anxieties ; in the first place , Ruth was overtaxing her strength in her hospital labors , and Philip felt as if he must move heaven and earth to save her from such toil and suffering . His increased pecuniary obligation oppressed him . It seemed to him also that he had been one cause of the misfortune to the Bolton family , and that he was dragging into loss and ruin everybody who associated with him . He worked on day after day and week after week , with a feverish anxiety . It would be wicked , thought Philip , and impious , to pray for luck ; he felt that perhaps he ought not to ask a blessing upon the sort of labor that was only a venture ; but yet in that daily petition , which this very faulty and not very consistent young Christian gentleman put up , he prayed earnestly enough for Ruth and for the Boltons and for those whom he loved and who trusted in him , and that his life might not be a misfortune to them and a failure to himself . Since this young fellow went out into the world from his New England home , he had done some things that he would rather his mother should not know , things maybe that he would shrink from telling Ruth . At a certain green age young gentlemen are sometimes afraid of being called milksops , and Philip 's associates had not always been the most select , such as these historians would have chosen for him , or whom at a later , period he would have chosen for himself . It seemed inexplicable , for instance , that his life should have been thrown so much with his college acquaintance , Henry Brierly . Yet , this was true of Philip , that in whatever company he had been he had never been ashamed to stand up for the principles he learned from his mother , and neither raillery nor looks of wonder turned him from that daily habit he had learned at his mother 's knees.--Even flippant Harry respected this , and perhaps it was one of the reasons why Harry and all who knew Philip trusted him implicitly . And yet it must be confessed that Philip did not convey the impression to the world of a very serious young man , or of a man who might not rather easily fall into temptation . One looking for a real hero would have to go elsewhere . The parting between Laura and her mother was exceedingly painful to both . It was as if two friends parted on a wide plain , the one to journey towards the setting and the other towards the rising sun , each comprehending that every step henceforth must separate their lives , wider and wider . CHAPTER LIX . When Mr. Noble 's bombshell fell in Senator Dilworthy 's camp , the statesman was disconcerted for a moment . For a moment ; that was all . The next moment he was calmly up and doing . From the centre of our country to its circumference , nothing was talked of but Mr. Noble 's terrible revelation , and the people were furious . Mind , they were not furious because bribery was uncommon in our public life , but merely because here was another case . Perhaps it did not occur to the nation of good and worthy people that while they continued to sit comfortably at home and leave the true source of our political power ( the “
176113	176136	175415	175415	You	5357	” ) in the hands of saloon - keepers , dog - fanciers and hod - carriers , they could go on expecting “
176138	176242	175415	175415	You	5357	” case of this kind , and even dozens and hundreds of them , and never be disappointed . However , they may have thought that to sit at home and grumble would some day right the evil . Yes , the nation was excited , but Senator Dilworthy was calm -- what was left of him after the explosion of the shell . Calm , and up and doing . What did he do first ? What would you do first , after you had tomahawked your mother at the breakfast table for putting too much sugar in your coffee ? You would “
176251	176383	175415	175415	You	5357	” That is what Senator Dilworthy did . It is the custom . He got the usual amount of suspension . Far and wide he was called a thief , a briber , a promoter of steamship subsidies , railway swindles , robberies of the government in all possible forms and fashions . Newspapers and everybody else called him a pious hypocrite , a sleek , oily fraud , a reptile who manipulated temperance movements , prayer meetings , Sunday schools , public charities , missionary enterprises , all for his private benefit . And as these charges were backed up by what seemed to be good and sufficient , evidence , they were believed with national unanimity . Then Mr. Dilworthy made another move . He moved instantly to Washington and “
176388	176405	176500	176500	One	893	” Even this could not pass without comment . Many papers used language to this effect : “
176514	176553	176668	176668	ours	5375	” Mr. Dilworthy appeared in his place in the Senate and offered a resolution appointing a committee to investigate his case . It carried , of course , and the committee was appointed . Straightway the newspapers said : “
176718	176770	176815	176815	it	5384	” And yet the Senate was roused by the Dilworthy trouble . Many speeches were made . One Senator ( who was accused in the public prints of selling his chances of re - election to his opponent for $ 50,000 and had not yet denied the charge ) said that , “
176802	176807	176833	176833	they	5382	” Another Senator said , “
176847	176909	176946	176947	the Senate,'--then	765	” Another said he was glad the investigation was to be had , for it was high time that the Senate should crush some cur like this man Noble , and thus show his kind that it was able and resolved to uphold its ancient dignity . A by - stander laughed , at this finely delivered peroration ; and said : “
176949	176950	176946	176947	the Senate,'--then	765	” “
176959	176966	176946	176947	the Senate,'--then	765	” said another by - stander . “
176984	177482	177507	177507	I	0	” There being no law against making offensive remarks about U. S. Senators , this conversation , and others like it , continued without let or hindrance . But our business is with the investigating committee . Mr. Noble appeared before the Committee of the Senate ; and testified to the following effect : He said that he was a member of the State legislature of the Happy - Land - of - Canaan ; that on the --- day of ------ he assembled himself together at the city of Saint 's Rest , the capital of the State , along with his brother legislators ; that he was known to be a political enemy of Mr. Dilworthy and bitterly opposed to his re - election ; that Mr. Dilworthy came to Saint 's Rest and reported to be buying pledges of votes with money ; that the said Dilworthy sent for him to come to his room in the hotel at night , and he went ; was introduced to Mr. Dilworthy ; called two or three times afterward at Dilworthy 's request -- usually after midnight ; Mr. Dilworthy urged him to vote for him ; Noble declined ; Dilworthy argued ; said he was bound to be elected , and could then ruin him ( Noble ) if he voted no ; said he had every railway and every public office and stronghold of political power in the State under his thumb , and could set up or pull down any man he chose ; gave instances showing where and how he had used this power ; if Noble would vote for him he would make him a Representative in Congress ; Noble still declined to vote , and said he did not believe Dilworthy was going to be elected ; Dilworthy showed a list of men who would vote for him -- a majority of the legislature ; gave further proofs of his power by telling Noble everything the opposing party had done or said in secret caucus ; claimed that his spies reported everything to him , and that-- Here a member of the Committee objected that this evidence was irrelevant and also in opposition to the spirit of the Committee 's instructions , because if these things reflected upon any one it was upon Mr. Dilworthy . The chairman said , let the person proceed with his statement -- the Committee could exclude evidence that did not bear upon the case . Mr. Noble continued . He said that his party would cast him out if he voted for Mr. Dilworthy ; Dilworthy said that that would inure to his benefit because he would then be a recognized friend of his ( Dilworthy 's ) and he could consistently exalt him politically and make his fortune ; Noble said he was poor , and it was hard to tempt him so ; Dilworthy said he would fix that ; he said , “
177498	177506	177889	177890	Mr. Chairman	5391	” Noble could not say ; Dilworthy said “
177514	177885	177988	177989	The Chairman	3624	” A Committee man said , impatiently , that this stuff was all outside the case , and valuable time was being wasted ; this was all a plain reflection upon a brother Senator . The Chairman said it was the quickest way to proceed , and the evidence need have no weight . Mr. Noble continued . He said he told Dilworthy that $ 5,000 was not much to pay for a man 's honor , character and everything that was worth having ; Dilworthy said he was surprised ; he considered $ 5,000 a fortune -- for some men ; asked what Noble 's figure was ; Noble said he could not think $ 10,000 too little ; Dilworthy said it was a great deal too much ; he would not do it for any other man , but he had conceived a liking for Noble , and where he liked a man his heart yearned to help him ; he was aware that Noble was poor , and had a family to support , and that he bore an unblemished reputation at home ; for such a man and such a man 's influence he could do much , and feel that to help such a man would be an act that would have its reward ; the struggles of the poor always touched him ; he believed that Noble would make a good use of this money and that it would cheer many a sad heart and needy home ; he would give the $ 10,000 ; all he desired in return was that when the balloting began , Noble should cast his vote for him and should explain to the legislature that upon looking into the charges against Mr. Dilworthy of bribery , corruption , and forwarding stealing measures in Congress he had found them to be base calumnies upon a man whose motives were pure and whose character was stainless ; he then took from his pocket $ 2,000 in bank bills and handed them to Noble , and got another package containing $ 5,000 out of his trunk and gave to him also . He---- A Committee man jumped up , and said : “
177922	177987	178849	178851	The Chairman--“The gentleman	9709	“ This is a grave offense , and can not be passed over in silence , sir . By the terms of our instructions we can now proceed to mete out to him such punishment as is meet for one who has maliciously brought disrespect upon a Senator of the United States . We have no need to hear the rest of his evidence . ”
178791	178848	178865	178866	Mr. Noble--“Then	766	Noble--“Senator Dilworthy , your bank account shows that up to that day , and even on that very day , you conducted all your financial business through the medium of checks instead of bills , and so kept careful record of every moneyed transaction . Why did you deal in bank bills on this particular occasion ? ”
178850	178864	178875	178877	The Chairman--“The Committee	9712	Chairman--“The gentleman will please to remember that the Committee is conducting this investigation . ”
178866	178874	178887	178888	Mr. Noble--“Which	767	Noble--“Then will the Committee ask the question ? ”
178876	178886	178898	178899	The Chairman--“Another	9713	Chairman--“The Committee will -- when it desires to know . ”
178888	178897	178920	178921	Mr. Noble--“D	768	Noble--“Which will not be during this century perhaps . ”
178899	178919	178920	178921	Mr. Noble--“D	768	Chairman--“Another remark like that , sir , will procure you the attentions of the Sergeant - at - arms . ”

178938	178946	178920	178921	Mr. Noble--“D	768	Committeemen--“Mr . Chairman , this is Contempt ! ”
178948	178952	178967	178968	Mr. Noble--“Then	766	Noble--“Contempt of whom ? ”
178953	178966	178967	178968	Mr. Noble--“Then	766	“ Of the Committee ! Of the Senate of the United States ! ”
178968	179012	179329	179329	you	5433	Noble--“Then I am become the acknowledged representative of a nation . You know as well as I do that the whole nation hold as much as three - fifths of the United States Senate in entire contempt.--Three - fifths of you are Dilworthys . ”

These letters were the last thing that held me in sympathy with any remnant or belonging of the old life . Henceforth that life and all that appertains to it are as dead to me and as far removed from me as if I were become a denizen of another world . ”
182268	182300	182544	182544	she	5489	“ Do not disturb me . I want no introduction . And do not fear for me ; the moment the hands point to eight I will step upon the platform . ”
182561	182627	182997	182997	she	5489	“ Oh , do not speak ! Take me away - please take me away , out of this dreadful place ! Oh , this is like all my life -- failure , disappointment , misery -- always misery , always failure . What have I done , to be so pursued ! Take me away , I beg of you , I implore you ! ”
182989	182996	182997	182997	she	5489	“ If I could only die ! ”
183000	183069	183854	183855	the Colonel	406	“ If I could only go back , and be as I was then , for one hour -- and hold my father 's hand in mine again , and see all the household about me , as in that old innocent time -- and then die ! My God , I am humbled , my pride is all gone , my stubborn heart repents -- have pity ! ”

184015	184048	184057	184057	Washington	382	“ There , now that 's all right -- the chair 's better . I could n't get another trunk like that -- not another like it in America , I reckon . ”
184049	184055	184057	184057	Washington	382	“ I am afraid not , ”
184067	184085	184099	184099	Washington	382	“ No indeed ; the man is dead that made that trunk and that saddle - bags . ”
184086	184097	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Are his great - grand - children still living ? ”
184113	184150	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Well , I do n't know -- I had n't thought of that -- but anyway they ca n't make trunks and saddle - bags like that , if they are -- no man can , ”
184158	184182	184057	184057	Washington	382	“ Wife did n't like to see me going off with that trunk -- she said it was nearly certain to be stolen . ”
184183	184186	184057	184057	Washington	382	“ Why ? ”
184187	184199	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Why ? Why , are n't trunks always being stolen ? ”
184200	184211	184057	184057	Washington	382	“ Well , yes -- some kinds of trunks are . ”
184212	184234	184057	184057	Washington	382	“ Very well , then ; this is some kind of a trunk -- and an almighty rare kind , too . ”
184235	184243	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Yes , I believe it is . ”
184244	184264	184057	184057	Washington	382	“ Well , then , why should n't a man want to steal it if he got a chance ? ”
184265	184274	184057	184057	Washington	382	“ Indeed I do n't know.--Why should he ? ”
184275	184319	184333	184333	I	0	“ Washington , I never heard anybody talk like you . Suppose you were a thief , and that trunk was lying around and nobody watching -- wouldn't you steal it ? Come , now , answer fair -- wouldn't you steal it ? “
184340	184358	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ You would n't ! Well , that beats me . Now what would you call stealing ? ”
184359	184367	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Why , taking property is stealing . ”
184368	184389	184333	184333	I	0	“ Property ! Now what a way to talk that is : What do you suppose that trunk is worth ? ”
184390	184397	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Is it in good repair ? ”
184398	184415	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Perfect . Hair rubbed off a little , but the main structure is perfectly sound . ”
184416	184422	184333	184333	I	0	“ Does it leak anywhere ? ”
184423	184444	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Leak ? Do you want to carry water in it ? What do you mean by does it leak ? ”
184445	184466	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Why -- a -- do the clothes fall out of it when it is -- when it is stationary ? ”
184467	184507	184333	184333	I	0	“ Confound it , Washington , you are trying to make fun of me . I do n't know what has got into you to - day ; you act mighty curious . What is the matter with you ? ”
184508	184556	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Well , I 'll tell you , old friend . I am almost happy . I am , indeed . It was n't Clay 's telegram that hurried me up so and got me ready to start with you . It was a letter from Louise . ”
184557	184569	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Good ! What is it ? What does she say ? ”
184570	184584	184333	184333	I	0	“ She says come home -- her father has consented , at last . ”
184585	184647	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ My boy , I want to congratulate you ; I want to shake you by the hand ! It 's a long turn that has no lane at the end of it , as the proverb says , or somehow that way . You 'll be happy yet , and Beriah Sellers will be there to see , thank God ! ”
184648	184702	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ I believe it . General Boswell is pretty nearly a poor man , now . The railroad that was going to build up Hawkeye made short work of him , along with the rest . He is n't so opposed to a son - in - law without a fortune , now . ”
184703	184714	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Without a fortune , indeed ! Why that Tennessee Land-- ”
184715	184733	184333	184333	I	0	“ Never mind the Tennessee Land , Colonel . I am done with that , forever and forever-- ”
184734	184744	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Why no ! You ca n't mean to say-- ”
184745	184766	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ My father , away back yonder , years ago , bought it for a blessing for his children , and-- ”

184778	184804	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ It proved a curse to him as long as he lived , and never a curse like it was inflicted upon any man 's heirs-- ”
184805	184817	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ I 'm bound to say there 's more or less truth-- ”
184818	184842	184333	184333	I	0	“ It began to curse me when I was a baby , and it has cursed every hour of my life to this day-- ”
184843	184858	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Lord , lord , but it 's so ! Time and again my wife-- ”
184859	184881	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ I depended on it all through my boyhood and never tried to do an honest stroke of work for my living-- ”
184882	184889	184333	184333	I	0	“ Right again -- but then you-- ”
184890	184951	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ I have chased it years and years as children chase butterflies . We might all have been prosperous , now ; we might all have been happy , all these heart - breaking years , if we had accepted our poverty at first and gone contentedly to work and built up our own wealth by our own toil and sweat-- ”
184952	184972	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ It 's so , it 's so ; bless my soul , how often I 've told Si Hawkins-- ”
184973	185048	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Instead of that , we have suffered more than the damned themselves suffer ! I loved my father , and I honor his memory and recognize his good intentions ; but I grieve for his mistaken ideas of conferring happiness upon his children . I am going to begin my life over again , and begin it and end it with good solid work ! I 'll leave my children no Tennessee Land ! ”
185049	185099	184333	184333	I	0	“ Spoken like a man , sir , spoken like a man ! Your hand , again my boy ! And always remember that when a word of advice from Beriah Sellers can help , it is at your service . I 'm going to begin again , too ! ”
185100	185103	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Indeed ! ”
185104	185193	184152	184153	the Colonel	6205	“ Yes , sir . I 've seen enough to show me where my mistake was . The law is what I was born for . I shall begin the study of the law . Heavens and earth , but that Braham 's a wonderful man -- a wonderful man sir ! Such a head ! And such a way with him ! But I could see that he was jealous of me . The little licks I got in in the course of my argument before the jury-- ”
185194	185205	184333	184333	I	0	“ Your argument ! Why , you were a witness . ”
185206	185458	185703	185703	he	382	“ Oh , yes , to the popular eye , to the popular eye -- but I knew when I was dropping information and when I was letting drive at the court with an insidious argument . But the court knew it , bless you , and weakened every time ! And Braham knew it . I just reminded him of it in a quiet way , and its final result , and he said in a whisper , ' You did it , Colonel , you did it , sir -- but keep it mum for my sake ; and I 'll tell you what you do , ' says he , ' you go into the law , Col . Sellers -- go into the law , sir ; that 's your native element ! ' And into the law the subscriber is going . There 's worlds of money in it!--whole worlds of money ! Practice first in Hawkeye , then in Jefferson , then in St. Louis , then in New York ! In the metropolis of the western world ! Climb , and climb , and climb -- and wind up on the Supreme bench . Beriah Sellers , Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States , sir ! A made man for all time and eternity ! That 's the way I block it out , sir -- and it 's as clear as day -- clear as the rosy - morn ! ”

185784	185791	185792	185792	he	382	“ It shall go for taxes , ”
185795	185805	185847	185847	he	382	“ and never tempt me or mine any more ! ”

186283	186336	186362	186362	he	646	“ But that is nothing ; where coal is , limestone with these fossils in it is pretty certain to lie against its foot casing ; but it does not necessarily follow that where this peculiar rock is coal must lie above it or beyond it ; this sign is not sufficient . ”
186340	186353	186362	186362	he	646	followed:--“There is one infallible sign -- if I could only strike that ! ”
186367	186439	186462	186462	he	646	“ Am I a visionary ? I must be a visionary ; everybody is in these days ; everybody chases butterflies : everybody seeks sudden fortune and will not lay one up by slow toil . This is not right , I will discharge the men and go at some honest work . There is no coal here . What a fool I have been ; I will give it up . ”
186474	186511	186635	186636	their spokesman	5636	“ There is coal there ; I will not give it up ; and coal or no coal I will drive the tunnel clear through the hill ; I will not surrender while I am alive . ”
186639	186830	186635	186636	their spokesman	5636	“ Mr. Sterling , when Tim was down a week with his fall you kept him on half - wages and it was a mighty help to his family ; whenever any of us was in trouble you 've done what you could to help us out ; you 've acted fair and square with us every time , and I reckon we are men and know a man when we see him . We have n't got any faith in that hill , but we have a respect for a man that 's got the pluck that you 've showed ; you 've fought a good fight , with everybody agin you and if we had grub to go on , I 'm d----d if we would n't stand by you till the cows come home ! That is what the boys say . Now we want to put in one parting blast for luck . We want to work three days more ; if we do n't find anything , we wo n't bring in no bill against you . That is what we 've come to say . ”

187434	187468	187480	187480	His	646	“ No , this is useless , this is absurd . If I found anything it would only be one of those little aggravating seams of coal which does n't mean anything , and-- ”
187485	187565	187702	187702	He	646	“ I am conquered . . . . . . I am out of provisions , out of money . . . . I have got to give it up . . . . . . All this hard work lost ! But I am not conquered ! I will go and work for money , and come back and have another fight with fate . Ah me , it may be years , it may , be years . ”
187666	187701	187912	187912	he	646	“ There it is ! How good it looks ! But down there is not up here . Well , I will go home and pack up -- there is nothing else to do . ”
