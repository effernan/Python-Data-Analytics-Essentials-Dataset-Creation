4338	4352	4353	4353	She	379	“ Yes ; but not such a good one — nor so heavy . ”
4358	4386	4353	4353	She	379	“ Is n’t he an armful ? He ’s nearly two pounds heavier than most children of two . When Beechy was his age she weighed only .... ”
4387	4390	4391	4391	Boyne	114	“ Beechy ? ”
4394	4402	4391	4391	Boyne	114	“ I thought you called her Zinnie . ”

4435	4450	4451	4451	she	379	“ Beechy ’s a step — but you have n’t seen the other steps , ”
4455	4464	4453	4453	herself	379	“ I wonder where on earth they are ? ”
4465	4469	4470	4470	he	114	“ The steps ? ”
4477	4537	4538	4538	she	437	“ Bun and Beechy . They only half belong to us , and so does Zinnie . They ’re all three step - children . But we ’re just as devoted to them as if they were altogether ours ; except when Bun is naughty . Bun is my only naughty child — oh , do hold Chip again ! ”
4555	4578	4579	4579	she	437	“ There ’s Bun now — and I never trust him when he ’s by himself ! I _ ca n’t _ , ”
4608	4664	4579	4579	she	437	“ He ’s going to do his menagerie - tricks . Oh , dear — And he ca n’t , with the ship rolling like this . His mother was a lion - tamer . But he ’ll hurt himself , I know he will — oh , Scopy ! Yes ; do take him .... ”
4820	4893	4894	4894	She	416	“ Is n’t Scopy funny ? She ca n’t bear it when Bun falls on Beechy ’s neck like that . She calls it ‘ so foreign and unmanly . ’ And of course they _ are _ foreign ... they ’re Italian ... but I ’m too thankful that Beechy has such an influence over Bun . If it were n’t for her we should have our hands full with him . ”
4905	4923	4924	4924	Boyne	114	“ You must have your hands rather full as it is — I mean even without Bun ? ”
4953	4969	4970	4970	he	114	“ Travelling with them all like this — and without Wheater to help you out , ”
4981	4999	5000	5000	she	416	“ Oh , he ’s not much at helping out ; he loathes to travel with us , ”
5029	5037	5038	5038	she	416	“ But Terry helps — most wonderfully , ”

5088	5101	5085	5085	Boyne	114	“ Yes ; a big boy like that must be a comfort . ”

5181	5229	5230	5230	Joyce	121	“ Well , I do n’t know that Terry ’s proud of Joyce , exactly — but he admires her , of course ; we all do . She ’s so awfully handsome . I do n’t believe even Blanca is going to come up to her . ”
5291	5314	5247	5248	Joyce Mervin	121	“ Do you know that Joyce , as you call her , used to be a great friend of mine years ago ? ”
5328	5381	5382	5382	Boyne	121	“ Oh , was she ? How jolly ! She says she looked exactly like Blanca then . Did she ? Of course she ’s a little thick now — but not nearly as much so as she imagines . She does so fret about it . It ’s her great unhappiness . ”
5385	5395	5382	5382	Boyne	121	“ You mean she has n’t any worse ones ? ”
5396	5421	5458	5459	Joyce Somebody	137	“ Oh , no . Not now . They ’ve been on a new honeymoon since Chip ... have n’t they , old Chippo ? ”
5422	5426	5382	5382	Boyne	121	“ They ... ? ”
5469	5475	5464	5464	he	459	“ Joyce _ who _ ? ”
5569	5583	5632	5632	She	328	“ Yes ; we were friends — really great friends for a winter .... ”
5585	5593	5632	5632	She	328	“ That ’s long , for Joyce , ”
5600	5624	5632	5632	She	328	“ ... such good friends that I should like to tell you my name : Martin Boyne — and to ask what your — ”

5813	5823	5824	5824	he	114	“ And how does she know I never have ? ”
5828	5859	5809	5809	she	326	“ do n’t you have any children — that ’s all I say ! Do you wonder mother and father do n’t care to travel with the lot of us ? ”

6747	6761	6735	6735	she	503	“ I understand from Judith that you ’re a friend of her people . ”
6812	6877	6878	6878	She	503	“ Not that there ’s any particular reason at present ; but it ’s a good deal of a responsibility for Judith to transport the whole party from Biskra to Venice , and we ’re always rather troubled about Terry . Even after four months at Biskra he has n’t picked up as we ’d hoped .... Always a little temperature in the evenings .... ”
6910	6924	6925	6925	Boyne	114	“ You ’re anxious about Terry ? He does look a little drawn . ”
6948	6982	6983	6983	She	503	“ Anxious ? I do n’t like the word ; and Judith would n’t admit it . But we always have our eye on him , the dear boy — and our minds . ”
7002	7022	7023	7023	He	114	“ It is , as you say , a tremendous responsibility for any one as young as Miss Wheater . ”
7030	7056	7023	7023	He	114	“ I can very nearly guess her age , for I used to see a good deal of both her parents before they were married . ”

7164	7179	7180	7180	She	503	“ Ah , poor little Chipstone : he ’s our hope , our consolation . ”
7199	7222	7192	7192	her	503	“ You see , Terry being so delicate — as twins often are — Mr. Wheater was always anxious for another boy . ”
7223	7240	7241	7241	She	503	“ Well , Chip looks like a pretty solid foundation to build one ’s hopes on . ”
7250	7261	7241	7241	She	503	“ He ’s never given us a minute ’s trouble . ”

7358	7387	7338	7338	she	408	“ Yes : those foreign children , with their scenes and their screams and their play - acting . I shall never get used to them — never ! ”
7388	7398	7399	7399	Boyne	114	“ But Zinnie : Zinnie ’s surely not foreign ? ”
7404	7430	7431	7431	She	408	“ Foreign to _ our _ ways , certainly ; really more so than the two others , who , on the father ’s side .... ”

7498	7522	7526	7527	Zinnia Lacrosse	143	“ I do n’t know what her last enormity has been . One of them was marrying Mr. Wheater — and having Zinnie .... ”

7610	7679	7585	7585	she	408	“ It ’s inconceivable , but it ’s so . Mr. Wheater married Zinnia Lacrosse . And Zinnie is their child . The truth is , he was n’t altogether to blame ; I ’ve always stood up for Mr. Wheater . What with his feeling so low after Mrs. Wheater left him , and his wanting another boy so dreadfully ... with all those millions to inherit .... ”
7747	7793	7795	7795	she	518	“ The wilderness ? The real wilderness is the world _ we _ live in ; packing up our tents every few weeks for another move .... And the marriages just like tents — folded up and thrown away when you ’ve done with them . ”

8671	8812	8667	8667	he	145	“ Oh , Chip ; dear Chip ’s a Wheater all right ! The very image of his father , do n’t you think ? But I see that I have n’t yet given you all the threads ; there are so many .... Where was I ? Oh , about Mrs. Wheater ’s separation . You know there ’s no divorce in Italy , and she thought she was tied to the Prince for life . But luckily her lawyers found out that he had been legally married — in some Italian consulate at the other end of the world — to the mother of Bun and Beechy ; and as the woman was still alive , the Prince ’s marriage with Mrs. Wheater had been bigamous , and was immediately annulled , and she became Mrs. Wheater again — ”
8813	8817	8641	8642	Miss Scope	147	“ And then ? ”
8818	8922	9022	9023	the governess	447	“ Then she was dreadfully miserable about it all , and Mr. Wheater was miserable too , because in the meanwhile he ’d found out about the horror he ’d married , and was already suing for a divorce . And Judith , who was thirteen by that time , and as wise and grown up as she is now , begged and entreated her father and mother to meet and talk things over , and see if they could n’t come together again , so that the children would never have to be separated , and sent backward and forward like bundles — ”
8923	8931	8667	8667	he	145	“ She did that ? That child ? ”
8932	9012	8641	8642	Miss Scope	147	“ Judith ’s never been a child — there was no time . So she got Mr. and Mrs. Wheater together , and they were both sore and unhappy over their blunders , and realised what a mess they ’d made — and finally they decided to try again , and they were remarried about three years ago ; and then Chip was born , and of course that has made everything all right again — for the present . ”
9013	9017	9018	9018	Boyne	145	“ The present ? ”
9041	9139	9022	9023	the governess	447	“ If I respect the truth , how can I say more than ‘ the present ’ ? But really I put it that way only for fear ... for fear of the Fates overhearing me .... Everything ’s going as smoothly as can be ; and we should all be perfectly happy if it were n’t for poor Terry , whose health never seems to be what it should .... Mr. and Mrs. Wheater adore Chip , and are very fond of the other children ; and Judith is almost sure it will last this time . ”
9153	9155	9022	9023	the governess	447	“ almost ”
9187	9199	9183	9183	he	145	“ If anything can make it last , you and Judith will ”
9206	9271	9202	9203	the governess	447	“ Oh , it ’s all Judith . And she has all the children behind her . They say they refuse to be separated again . Even the little ones say so . They ’re much more attached to each other than you ’d think , to hear them bickering and wrangling . And they all worship Judith . Even the two foreigners do . ”

9381	9396	9397	9397	She	127	“ One of the most beautiful things in the world . The mosaics alone .... ”
9402	9414	9397	9397	She	127	“ We must go there ! I ’ve seen so little — ”
9415	9432	9371	9371	Judith	127	“ Why , I thought you ’d travelled from one end of Europe to the other . ”
9433	9491	9397	9397	She	127	“ That does n’t show you anything but sleeping - cars and Palace Hotels , does it ? Mother and father never even have a guide - book ; they just ask the hall - porter where to go . And then something always seems to prevent their going . You must show me everything , everything . ”
9492	9501	9397	9397	She	127	“ Well , we ’ll begin with Monreale . ”
9720	9729	9730	9730	Terry	198	“ Well , you ’d better try then , ”
9751	9765	9746	9746	he	198	“ Terry ! What a beast you are ! I did n’t mean — ”

9813	9827	9829	9829	Zinnie	133	“ Well , I want to go where there ’s zoranges to eat , ”
9848	9872	9873	9873	Boyne	145	“ — ’ r if I do n’t , I want something a lot better’nstead , n ’ I mean to have it ! ”
9881	9892	9877	9877	Judith	127	“ We ’d better go to their orange - garden . ”
9893	9897	9898	9898	Terry	198	“ Look here , ”
9901	9993	9898	9898	Terry	198	“ the little ones are mad to hear the end of that story of the old old times , about the two children who ’d never seen a motor . They ’re all so fed up with airships and machinery and X rays and wireless ; and you know you promised to go on with that story some day . Why could n’t we go to the place you want to see , and you ’ll promise and swear to finish the story there , and to have chocolates for tea ? ”
9994	10006	10007	10007	Boyne	145	“ Oh — and oranges ; I ’ll supply the oranges , ”
10010	10041	10007	10007	Boyne	145	“ There ’s a jolly garden next to the cloister , and I ’ll persuade the guardian to let us in , and we ’ll have a picnic tea there . ”
10042	10047	10048	10048	Zinnie	133	“ An’masses of zoranges ? ”
10084	10091	10069	10069	Bun	135	“ Noranges ! Noranges ! NORANGES ! ”
10092	10101	10102	10102	Blanca	128	“ Oh , very well ; I knew — ”

10133	10141	10143	10143	Blanca	128	“ That settles it , of course , ”
10359	10475	10353	10353	Judith	127	“ But when Polycarp and Lullaby drove home in the victoria with the white horse to their mamma ’s palace they found that the zebra door - mat had got up and was eating all the flowers in the drawing - room vases , and the big yellow birds on the wall - paper were all flying about , and making the most dreadful mess scattering seeds about the rooms . But the most wonderful thing was that the cuckoo from the nursery clock was gone too , so that the nurses could n’t tell what time it was , and when the children ought to be put to bed and to get up again .... ”
10476	10483	10485	10485	Bun	135	“ Oh , how perfectly lovely , ”
10491	10496	10488	10488	Beechy	154	“ Lovelly , lovelly .... ”
10497	10502	10504	10504	Judith	127	“ Not at all , ”
10507	10580	10504	10504	Judith	127	“ It was the worst thing that had happened to them yet , for the cook did n’t know what time it was either , and nobody in the house could tell her , so there was no breakfast ready ; and the cook just went off for a ride on the zebra , because she had no carriage of her own , and she said there was nothing else to do . ”
10581	10590	10591	10591	Zinnie	133	“ Why did n’t they tell their father’n’mother ? ”
10598	10618	10620	10620	Bun	135	“ Because they ’d got new ones , who did n’t know about the cuckoo either , I guess , ”
10624	10640	10641	10641	Zinnie	133	“ Then why did n’t the children go with their old fathers an ’ mothers ? ”
10644	10675	10641	10641	Zinnie	133	“ Because their old mother ’s friend , Sally Money , was n’t big enough ... big enough ... big enough ... for her to take them all with her .... ”
10690	10721	10722	10722	Judith	127	“ Big enough to take them all on her back and carry them away with her . But I daresay the new father and mother would have been all right , ”
10725	10767	10722	10722	Judith	127	“ if only the children had been patient and known how to treat them ; only just at first they did n’t ; and besides , at the time I am telling you about , they happened to be away travelling — ”
10768	10782	10868	10868	Scopy	132	“ Then why did n’t the children telephone to them to come back ? ”
10783	10794	10722	10722	Judith	127	“ Because there were n’t any telephones in those days . ”
10795	10808	10810	10810	Zinnie	133	“ No telephones ? Does it say so in the hist’ry books ? ”
10814	10829	10810	10810	Zinnie	133	“ Course it does , you silly . Why , when Scopy was little , ”
10834	10847	10830	10830	Terry	198	“ she lived in a house where there was n’t any telephone . ”
10872	10884	10868	10868	Scopy	132	“ Now , Beatrice , do n’t be _ foreign _ — ”
10893	10909	10868	10868	Scopy	132	“ So there was no way whatever for them to get any breakfast , and — ”
10910	10928	10929	10929	Beechy	154	“ Oh , I know , I know ! They starved to death , _ poverini _ ! ”
10953	10968	10868	10868	Scopy	132	“ Not just yet . For they met on the edge of the wood — ”
10970	10981	10983	10983	Zinnie	133	“ What wood ? There was n’t any wood before , ”
10987	11043	10868	10868	Scopy	132	“ No , but there was one now ; for all the trees and flowers from the wall - papers had come off the wall , and gone out into the garden to grow , so that the big yellow birds should have a wood to build their nests in , and the zebras should — ”
11044	11053	11066	11066	Blanca	128	“ Zebras ! There was only one zebra . ”
11068	11110	11111	11111	Zinnie	133	“ Stupid ! He ’d been married already and had a lot of perfectly lovely norphans and three dear little steps like us , and Mrs. Zebra she had a big family too , no , she had two big families , ”
11124	11160	11111	11111	Zinnie	133	“ Oh , how lovely for the zebra ! Then all the little zebras stayed together always afterward — f’rever and ever . Say they did — oh , Judith , _ say _ it ! ”
11164	11206	11161	11161	Beechy	154	“ Of course they did . ( Zinnie , you must n’t call Blanca stupid . ) But all this time Polycarp and Lullaby were starving , because the clock had stopped and the cook had gone out on the zebra .... ”
11207	11218	11219	11219	Zinnie	133	“ And they were starving — slowly starving to death ... ”
11222	11255	11219	11219	Zinnie	133	“ Yes ; but on the edge of the wood whom did they meet but a great big tall gentleman with a mot — no , I mean a pony - carriage .... ”
11256	11262	11161	11161	Beechy	154	“ What ’s a pony ? ”
11263	11273	11286	11286	Bun	135	“ A little horse about as big as Bun — ”
11275	11284	11286	11286	Bun	135	“ Oh , oh — I’m a pony ! ”
11293	11312	11313	11313	Judith	127	“ And the pony - carriage was full — absolutely brim full of — what do you think ? ”
11324	11335	11313	11313	Judith	127	“ Oranges ! No , noranges — zoranges ! ! ! ”
11364	11373	11361	11361	Nanny	156	“ Now , children , children — now — ”
11374	11381	11383	11383	Boyne	145	“ And this is our chance , ”
11385	11394	11383	11383	Boyne	145	“ to make a dash for the cathedral . ”
11509	11517	11487	11487	Boyne	145	“ Now from here you can see — ”
11627	11642	11602	11602	she	326	“ I suppose I ’m much more ignorant than you could possibly have imagined . ”
11643	11656	11659	11659	her	326	“ You mean that you do n’t particularly care for all this ? ”
11664	11678	11659	11659	her	326	“ I believe all those big people up there frighten me a little . ”
11683	11693	11680	11680	she	326	“ I ’m glad I did n’t bring Chip . ”
11694	11697	11698	11698	He	145	“ Child ! ”
11726	11738	11739	11739	she	326	“ But I do want to admire it , you know , ”
11744	11760	11739	11739	she	326	“ because you do , and Scopy says you know such a lot about everything . ”
11761	11770	11771	11771	he	145	“ It ’s not a question of knowing — ”
11926	11941	11901	11901	he	145	“ Woman — but she ’s not a woman ! She ’s a child . ”
11981	12002	11965	11965	he	145	“ Come along ; it ’s chilly here after our sun - bath . Gardens are best , after all . ”
12025	12040	12041	12041	she	612	“ Some day , I know , I shall want to come back here , ”
12044	12055	12056	12056	he	145	“ Oh , well , we ’ll come back together , ”
12516	12620	12635	12635	he	145	“ ... what you would think . A strange little creature who changes every hour , hardly seems to have any personality of her own except when she ’s mothering her flock . Then she ’s extraordinary : playmate , mother and governess all in one ; and the best of each in its way . As for her very self , when she ’s not with them , you grope for her identity and find an instrument the wind plays on , a looking - glass that reflects the clouds , a queer little sensitive plate , very little and very sensitive — ”
12638	12646	12635	12635	he	145	“ Unluckily not in the least pretty . ”
12648	12799	12635	12635	he	145	“ I ’m so much interested in your picturesque description of the little - girl - mother ( sounds almost as nauseating as ‘ child - wife , ’ does n’t it ? ) who is conducting that heterogeneous family across Europe , while the parents are jazzing at Venice . What an instance of modern manners ; no , not manners — there are none left — but customs ! I ’m sure if I saw the little creature I should fall in love with her — as you are obviously doing . Luckily you ’ll be parting soon , or I should expect to see you arrive here with the girl - bride of the movies and a tribe of six ( or is it seven ? ) adopted children . Do n’t imagine , though , that in that case I should accept the post of governess . ”
12806	12830	12635	12635	he	145	“ Of course she ’s awfully pretty , or you would n’t have taken so much pains to say that she ’s not . ”

13653	13668	13649	13649	he	633	“ Mr. Boyne — could we have a quiet talk , do you think ? ”
13757	13783	13784	13784	Terry	198	“ Why , of course , old man . Come in . You ’ll be better off here than on deck till it gets cooler . ”

14096	14155	14164	14164	Terry	198	“ So they all do it now ; that is , speak of their different sets of parents by their names . And my children have picked up the habit from the others , though in their own case , luckily , it ’s no longer necessary , now that their papa and mamma have come together again . ”
14156	14163	14164	14164	Terry	198	“ I mean father and mother , ”
14167	14190	14164	14164	Terry	198	“ Make them understand that I must be educated . There ’s no time to lose . And _ you _ could . ”
14224	14269	14207	14207	his	198	“ My dear chap — of course I ’ll do anything I can for you . But I do n’t believe I shall be seeing your people this time . I ’m going to jump into the train the minute we get to Venice . ”

14309	14331	14332	14332	Terry	198	“ Oh , I can see that a solid fortnight of the lot of us is a good deal for anybody , ”
14335	14374	14375	14375	Boyne	145	“ All the same , Judy and I did hope you ’d stay in Venice for a day or two . We thought , you see , there were a good many things you could do for us . ”
14382	14416	14375	14375	Boyne	145	“ I should be very glad if I could . But I ’m afraid you overrate my influence . I have n’t seen your parents for years . They ’d hardly remember me . ”
14417	14429	14431	14431	Terry	198	“ That ’s just it : you ’d be a novelty , ”
14434	14465	14431	14431	Terry	198	“ Well — if that ’s an inducement .... Anyhow , you may be sure I ’ll do what I can ... if I find I can alter my plans .... ”
14466	14585	14586	14587	The boy	365	“ Oh , if you could ! You see I ’ve really never had anybody to speak for me . Scopy cuts no ice with them , and of course they think Judy ’s too young to know about education — specially as she ’s never had any herself . She ca n’t even spell , you know . She writes stomach with a _ k _ . And they ’ve let me go on like this , just with nurses and nursery - governesses ( that ’s really all Scopy is ) , as if I was n’t any older than Bun , when I ’m at an age when most fellows are leaving their preparatory schools . ”
14610	14614	14615	14615	he	365	“ Of course , ”
14619	14859	14860	14860	Terry	198	“ Judy says I ’m not fair to them — that I do n’t remember what a lot they ’ve had to spend for me on doctors and climate , and all that . And they did send me to school once , and I had to be taken away because of my beastly temperature .... I know all that . But it _ was _ a sell , when I left school , just to come back again to Scopy and Nanny , and nobody a fellow could put a question to , or get a tip from about what other fellows are learning . Last summer , at St. Moritz , I met a boy not much older than I am who was rather delicate too , and he ’d just got a new father who was a great reader , and who had helped him no end , and got a tutor for him ; and he ’d started Cæsar , and was getting up his Greek verbs — with a temperature every evening too . And I said to Judy : ‘ Now , look at that . ’ And she said , yes , it would be splendid for me to have a tutor . And for two weeks the other fellow ’s father let me work a little with him . But then we had to go away — one of our troubles , ”
14864	14956	14957	14957	He	198	“ is that we ’re so everlastingly going away . But I suppose it ’s always so with children — isn’t it?—with all the different parents they ’re divided up among , and all the parents living in different places , and fighting so about when the children are to go to which , and the lawyers always changing things just as you think they ’re arranged .... Of course a chap must expect to be moving about when he ’s young . But Scopy says that later parents settle down . ”
14980	14993	14967	14967	Boyne	145	“ Oh , but they do — by Jove , they do ! ”
15117	15153	15112	15112	she	147	“ Settle down ? Rather ! People naturally tend to as they get older . Are n’t your own parents proving it already ? Have n’t you all got together again , so to speak ? ”
15181	15184	15185	15185	Terry	198	“ Yes , ”
15188	15245	15246	15246	he	198	“ You ’d think so . But I know children who ’ve thought so too , and been jolly well sold . The trouble is you can never be sure when parents will really begin to feel old . Especially with all these new ways the doctors have of making them young again . But anyhow , ”
15252	15277	15246	15246	he	198	“ if you would put in a word I ’m sure it would count a lot . And Judy is sure it would too . ”
15278	15300	15301	15301	Boyne	145	“ Then of course I will . I ’ll stop over a day or two , and do all I can , ”

Great old times we used to have in the groves of John Harvard , eh , Martin , my boy ? ’ Member that Cambridge girl you used to read poetry to ? _ Poetry ! _ She was a looker , too ! ‘ Come into the garden , Maud ’ .... _ Garden _ they used to call it in those days ! And now I hear you ’re a pal of my son ’s .... Well , no , I do n’t mean Chipstone — ”

All but Chip , that is . Ca n’t part with Chipstone , can we ? Here they all come , Judy in the lead as usual . Hullo , Judy girl ! Chippo , old man , how goes it ? Give us your fist , my son . ”
16756	16842	16746	16746	his	719	“ Catch on to him , will you , Joyce ? Look at old man Chippo ! Must have put on another five pounds since our last meeting — I swear he has ... you just feel this calf of his ! Hard as a tennis ball , it is .... Does you no end of credit , Judy . Here , pass him on to the room next to your mother ’s .... Wish you ’d develop that kind of calf , Terry boy .... ”

17563	17639	17560	17560	she	120	“ I ’ve been going to the galleries with him . It ’s the first time I ’ve ever _ seen _ Venice . Fanny Tradeschi got him out from England to tutor her boys , and then she was bored here , and rushed back to Paris , and left him stranded . His name is Ormerod — Gerald Ormerod . It would be the greatest privilege for Terry if he could be persuaded .... ”
17640	17666	17516	17517	Mrs. Wheater	120	“ Oh , I guess I can persuade him all right . I do n’t believe Fanny remembered to settle with him before she left . ”

Ca n’t for the life of me see why you ’ve stuck yourself down at that frowsy _ pension _ with the children ; I ’m sure I could have bullied the manager here into giving you a room .... Have it your own way , though . And you and Joyce can map out a tour for to - morrow : only no galleries for me , thank you ! Look here — d’ye think I ’d disturb Chipstone Wheater Esqre if I was just to poke my head in and take a look at him on my way out ? Listen — my shoes do n’t creak the least bit .... Oh , hang it , I do n’t care , I ’m going to , anyway .... ”
18010	18022	18023	18023	she	129	“ It ’s impossible to make Cliffe feel _ nuances _ , ”
18039	18058	18059	18059	She	129	“ But now we can have a good talk — just like old times , ca n’t we ? ”
18518	18535	18536	18536	Martin	114	“ Why , there were things I could n’t tell even _ you _ , Martin — ”
18542	18554	18536	18536	Martin	114	“ Things I hope that Judy was n’t told , then ? ”
18569	18620	18555	18556	Mrs. Wheater	120	“ Bless you , you do n’t have to tell the modern child things ! They seem to be born knowing them . Have n’t you found that out , you dear old Rip van Winkle ? Why , Judy ’s like a mother to me , I assure you . ”
18621	18636	18637	18637	Boyne	114	“ She ’s got a pretty big family to mother , has n’t she ? ”
18646	18999	18641	18642	Mrs. Wheater	120	“ Oh , but she loves it , you know ! It ’s her hobby . Why , she tried to be a mother to Zinnia Lacrosse .... Fancy a child of Judy ’s age attempting to keep a movie star straight ! She used to give good advice to Buondelmonte .... But that nightmare ’s over now , and we ’re all together again , and there ’s only Terry , poor darling , to worry about . I _ do _ worry about him , you know , Martin . And is n’t it sweet of him to want to be properly educated ? For Cliffe , of course , education has always just been college sports and racing - motors . That ’s one reason why I ’ve missed so much ... but I am determined that Terry shall have all the opportunities I have n’t had . This tutor I was speaking about , Gerald Ormerod — I wonder if you ’d see him for me to - morrow , Martin ? It ’s no use asking Cliffe — he’d just shout and brag , and spoil the whole thing . Gerald — I’ve got to calling him Gerald because Fanny Tradeschi always did — he comes of very good people , you see , and he ’s almost too sensitive ... too much of an idealist .... I ca n’t tell you what it ’s been to me , these last weeks , to see Venice through the eyes of some one who really cares for beauty .... You ’ll have a talk with him about Terry , Martin dear ? I ’m sure Cliffe would give any salary you advise — and it would be the saving of our poor Terry to be with some one really sensitive and cultivated ... and Bun , too ... he might put some sort of reason into Bun , who ’s beginning to get quite out of hand with Scopy .... And , Martin , do n’t forget : you can fix the salary as high as you like . ”
19142	19145	19141	19144	the “ Fancy Girl	2751	“ Fancy Girl ”
19528	19546	19512	19512	Joyce	121	“ Is this your dear little girl ? We should have known her anywhere from the likeness . ”
19560	19563	19512	19512	Joyce	121	“ Palaces . ”
19564	19578	19553	19553	Blanca	128	“ Ever since she got engaged to the lift - boy at Biarritz .... ”
19579	19582	19583	19583	Boyne	121	“ Engaged ? ”
19586	19597	19583	19583	Boyne	121	“ But , Judy ... but Blanca ’s barely eleven .... ”
19598	19619	19512	19512	Joyce	121	“ Oh , I was engaged myself at Blanca ’s age — to a page at a skating - rink . ”
19648	19826	19626	19626	she	127	“ But that was different . He was a very nice little Swiss boy ; and I only gave him one of my hair - ribbons , and he gave me one of his livery buttons ; and when he went home for his holiday he sent me dried edelweiss , and forget - me - nots pasted on cards . But these modern children are different . Blanca ’s boy wanted a ring with a real stone in it ; and he was a horrid big thing with a fat nose that wriggled . Terry and I could hardly bear it . And when Scopy found out about it she made an awful row , and threatened to write to mother ... so altogether we ’re better off here . In fact I wrote to father that we ’d better put up at a place like this , where the children can rush about and make a noise , and nobody bothers . I think it ’s rather jolly here , do n’t you , Martin ? ”
20202	20243	20185	20186	Mrs. Wheater	120	“ There ’s the little Buondelmonte boy — a sort of step - son ; he ’s rather a handful for the governess , and perhaps you would take him on for part of the time . In that case — ”
20284	20304	20276	20276	he	114	“ He strikes me as clever ; but I do n’t know how hard he ’ll make Terry work . ”
20305	20384	20385	20385	She	127	“ Oh , Terry will make _ him _ work . And as long as Joyce wants it I ’m glad it ’s settled . If she had n’t , father might have kicked at the price . Not that he is n’t awfully generous to us ; but he ca n’t see why people should want to be educated when they do n’t have to . What does it ever _ lead _ to , he says . ”
20392	20469	20470	20470	He	809	“ I do n’t know ; do you ? I ca n’t explain . But if Terry wants it I ’m sure it ’s right . You ’ve read a lot yourself , have n’t you ? I do n’t suppose I shall ever care much about reading ... but what ’s the use of bothering , when I should never have a minute ’s time , no matter how much I cared to do it ? ”
20568	20627	20628	20628	She	127	“ Go to school ? Me ? But when , I ’d like to know ? There ’ll always be some of the children left to look after . Why , I shall be too old for school before Chip is anywhere near Terry ’s age . And besides , I never mean to leave the children—_never _ ! ”
20654	20661	20662	20662	she	127	“ We ’ve all sworn that , ”
20665	20745	20662	20662	she	127	“ We took an awful oath one day at Biskra that we ’d never be separated again , no matter what happened . Even Chip had to hold up his fist and say : ‘ I swear . ’ We did it on Scopy ’s ‘ Cyclopædia of Nursery Remedies . ’ And if things went wrong again , and I was off at one of your schools , who ’d see to it that the oath was kept ? ”
20746	20782	20783	20783	She	127	“ But now that all the children are safely with your own people , could n’t you let the oath take care of itself , and think a little of what ’s best for you ? ”
20801	20811	20785	20785	her	127	“ You ’d like me to go to school ? ”
20822	20826	20812	20812	He	814	“ Most awfully . ”
20833	20840	20827	20827	Her	127	“ Then I should like to . ”
20841	20846	20847	20847	She	127	“ Well , then — ”
20856	20910	20849	20849	her	127	“ I do n’t suppose you ’ll ever understand — you or anybody . How could I leave the children now ? I ’ve got to get them off to Switzerland in another fortnight ; this is no place for Terry . And suppose Mr. Ormerod decides he wo n’t come with us — ”
20911	20930	20931	20931	She	127	“ Wo n’t come with you ? But it ’s precisely what he ’s been engaged to do ! ”
20952	20968	20931	20931	She	127	“ Well , then , suppose it was mother who did n’t want him to ? ”
20969	20992	20937	20937	her	127	“ Your mother ? Why , child , it was she who found him . She knows all about him ; she — ”
20993	21003	21004	21004	Judy	127	“ She jolly well likes doing Venice with him , ”
21058	21070	21047	21047	Judy	127	“ I ’ve said something you do n’t like , Martin ? ”
21071	21105	21106	21106	She	127	“ You ’ve said something exceedingly silly . Something I should hate to hear if you were grown up . But at your age it ’s merely silly , and does n’t matter . ”
21119	21191	21109	21109	her	127	“ My age ? My age ? What do you know about my age ? I ’m as old as your grandmother . I ’m as old as the hills . I suppose you think I ought n’t to say things like that about mother — but what am I to do , when they ’re true , and there ’s no one but you that I can say them to ? ”
21315	21325	21326	21326	he	817	“ There ’s nothing to be done about it , ”
21339	21350	21331	21331	he	817	“ You ’re very foolish not to go to school . ”
21368	21384	21364	21364	her	127	“ Perhaps if you were going to stay here you ’d lend me some books . ”
21385	21403	21404	21404	he	817	“ But I ’m not going to stay here ; I ’m off to - morrow morning , ”
21462	21581	21582	21582	He	821	“ Martin , if you ’d only stay ! There are so many things left undecided .... Father and mother ca n’t make up their minds where to go next , and it ’s always when they ’ve got nothing particular to do that they quarrel . They ca n’t get anybody to go on the yacht with them — not till Cowes . And if they have to chuck the cruise father wants to go to Paris , and mother wants to go motoring in the hill - towns of Italy ( where are they , do you know ? ) And if they get wrangling again what in the world is to become of us children ? ”
21618	21625	21626	21626	He	821	“ Sit down , my dear . ”
21645	21813	21817	21817	his	823	“ You ’re taking all this much too hard , you know . You ’ve too much on your shoulders , and you ’re over - tired : that ’s all . I ’ve been with your father and mother for two days now , and I see no signs of anything going wrong . The only trouble with them is that they ’re too rich . That makes them fretful : it ’s like teething . Every time your father hears he ’s made another million it ’s like cutting a new tooth . They hurt to bite on when one has so many . But he ’ll find people soon to go off for a cruise with him , and then he ’ll have to decide about your summer . Your people must see that this place is not bracing enough for Terry ; and they ’ll want him to settle down somewhere in the mountains , and get to work as soon as possible . ”
21840	21847	21848	21848	she	824	“ But what sort of people ? ”
21856	21862	21848	21848	she	824	“ What sort of people ? ”
21863	21966	21817	21817	his	823	“ To go on the yacht . That ’s another thing . When mother is away from father , and I ’m with her , it ’s easier in some ways — except that then I fret about the other children . When Joyce and father are together they do all sorts of crazy things , just to be in opposition to each other . Take up with horrid people , I mean , people who drink and have rows . And then they get squabbling again , as they did when Buondelmonte sent father the bill for his Rolls - Royce .... ”
21967	21970	22041	22042	the maid	825	“ Buondelmonte ? ”
21971	21990	22041	22042	the maid	825	“ Yes ; but Joyce said we were never to talk about that — she forbade us all . ”
21991	21997	21817	21817	his	823	“ She was quite right . ”
21998	22024	22041	22042	the maid	825	“ Yes ; only it ’s true . And they do get into all sorts of rows and muddles about the people they pick up — ”
22117	22125	22194	22194	She	127	“ To see my daughter Zinnie Wheater , ”
22127	22129	22194	22194	She	127	“ my ”
22134	22136	22194	22194	She	127	“ her ”
22164	22193	22194	22194	She	127	“ Why , it must be Zinnia Lacrosse ! Why , she ’s married again ! It ’s true , then , what Blanca saw in the papers .... ”
22200	22209	22194	22194	She	127	“ Do you suppose she ’s really here ? ”
22210	22217	22265	22266	the newcomer	713	“ Of course I ’m here ! ”
22250	22263	22232	22236	an apparition sparkling with youth	830	“ Hullo , Judy — why , it ’s _ you _ ! ”
22330	22349	22350	22350	she	713	“ Well , old Judy , I ’m glad to see you again .... Who ’s your friend ? ”
22378	22398	22350	22350	she	713	“ He ’s Mr. Boyne . He ’s father ’s friend too . This is Zinnia Lacrosse , Martin . ”
22399	22466	22468	22469	the star	833	“ No , it is n’t , either ! It ’s the Marchioness of Wrench . Only I ’m just called Lady Wrench , except on visiting - cards , and when they put me in the newspapers , or I talk to the servants . And of course you ’ll call me Zinnia just the same , Judy . How d’ye do , Mr. Boyne ? ”
22500	22511	22512	22512	she	833	“ What I ’m after is Zinnie , you know , ”
22515	22542	22543	22543	She	833	“ Wrenny ’s waiting in the gondola — Wrenny ’s my husband — and I ’ve promised to take her out and show her to him . ”
22583	22588	22589	22589	she	833	“ Now , Zinnia , ”
22605	22611	22589	22589	she	833	“ you know perfectly well — ”
22612	22616	22589	22589	she	833	“ Know what ? ”
22617	22639	22589	22589	she	833	“ You know what the agreement is ; and you know Scopy and I are n’t going to listen to anything — ”
22640	22804	22805	22805	Judy	127	“ Fudge , child ! What d’you suppose I ’d want to break the agreement for ? Not that I care such an awful lot for Cliffe ’s old alimony , you know . It do n’t hardly keep me in silk stockings . If I wanted to carry Zinnie off , that would n’t stop me half a second . But I only want to show Wrenny that I can have a baby if I choose . Men are so funny about such things ; he does n’t believe I ’ve ever had one . And of course I can see he ’s got to have an heir . Look here , Judy , ai n’t I always dealt with you white ? Let me see her right away , wo n’t you ? I ’ve got a lovely present for her here , and one for you too — a real beauty .... Ca n’t you understand a mother ’s feelings ? ”
22839	22888	22832	22832	she	127	“ Of course you can see Zinnie . You need n’t get excited about that . Only you ’ll see her here , with me and Mr. Boyne . All your husband has got to do is to get out of the gondola and come into the house . ”
22889	22908	22909	22909	Judith	127	“ If you ’d been brought up like a lady you ’d call him Lord Wrench , Judy . ”
22914	22966	22909	22909	Judith	127	“ Mercy ! Then you ’d better call me Miss Wheater . But if you want to see Zinnie you have n’t got any time to lose , because father ’s going to send for the children in a minute or two , and take them all off on the yacht . ”
22967	22981	23019	23019	she	2835	“ Oh , Judy — but he ca n’t prevent my seeing Zinnie ! ”
22982	22997	23019	23019	she	2835	“ Nobody wants to prevent you , if you ’ll do what I say . ”
23023	23056	23019	23019	she	2835	“ I ’ll try ; but I do n’t believe he ’ll get out of the gondola . He ’s dead lazy . And we wanted to take Zinnie for a row . ”
23077	23085	23086	23086	Judith	127	“ I ’ll go and fetch Zinnie , ”
23124	23214	23215	23215	Judith	127	“ Judy ! That was Zinnia , was n’t it ? I saw her from my window ! Nanny said it was n’t , but I knew it was . She has n’t gone away without seeing her own little Zinnie , has she ? I ’ll never forgive you if she has . Did she bring a present for me ? She always does . Blanca ’s crazy to come down and see her clothes , but Scopy wo n’t let her . She ’s locked her up . ”
23223	23276	23219	23219	her	127	“ Oh , Scopy need n’t have done that . It wo n’t hurt Blanca to see your mother . There , stop pinching me , Zinnie , and do n’t worry . Your mother ’s coming back . She ’s only gone to get her husband to introduce him to you . ”
23277	23364	23372	23372	her	133	“ Her new husband ? What ’s his name ? Nobody ever told me she had a new husband . ’Cos they always say : ‘ You ’re too little to understand . ’ Zif I was n’t Zinnia ’s own little daughter ! Judy , has n’t she got a present for me , do n’t you think ? If it ’s nothing but choc’lates , course I ’ll divvy with the others ; but if it ’s jewelry I need n’t , need I ? ”
23406	23429	23430	23430	she	133	“ There ’s no use her seeing I ’ve had presents already — you do n’t mind , Martin , do you ? ”
23473	23482	23454	23454	Judith	127	“ You nasty false ungrateful little viper you — ”
23483	23490	23492	23492	Zinnie	133	“ Oo - oo - oo , ”
23504	23536	23492	23492	Zinnie	133	“ There — now , Wrenny , you just look at that . I wish I had my lawyers here ! That ’s the way those Wheater people treat my child — ”
23587	23595	23596	23596	he	843	“ Oh , Lord , my dear , ”
23641	23654	23655	23655	she	183	“ What ’s that nasty beast been doing to momma ’s darling ? ”
23666	23691	23655	23655	she	183	“ Whipping you for wanting to see your own mother , I suppose ? You just tell momma what it was and she ’ll .... ”
23741	23773	23724	23724	She	133	“ Oh , Zinnia , are they real ? Blanca says they ca n’t be — she knows they ca n’t , ’cos they ’re twice as big as Joyce ’s . ”
23774	23787	23724	23724	She	133	“ Blanca ? Why , is Blanca here ? Where is she ? ”
23788	23889	23890	23891	Lady Wrench	183	“ Scopy ’s got her locked up , so ’s she ca n’t come down and stare at you , but she found Martin ’s op’ra glasses in his room’n she ’s looking at you through them’n she says they ’re so pow’ful she can count the pearls , and ca n’t she come down , please , Zinnia , ’cos she wants to see f’you’ve got the same Callot model ’s Joyce ’s jess ordered , ’cos it ’ll make Joyce wild’n she ’ll want to get another one instead as quick as she can . Please , Zinnia ! ”
23916	23942	23903	23903	She	183	“ There , Wrenny , what d’you think of that , I ’d like to know ? Is n’t she my really truly little girl ? ”
23999	24011	24012	24012	he	185	“ Yes , I ’ll take my oath she ’s that , ”
24071	24254	24060	24060	she	498	“ Judy thought we wanted to _ steal _ her , Wrenny — think of that ! Oh , I forgot you did n’t know each other — Lord Wrench , Judy Wheater . And this is Mr. Boyne , a friend of Cliffe’s — aren’t you a friend of Cliffe ’s , Mr. Boyne ? My present husband , the Marqu — no ; that ’s wrong , I know — just my husband . But where ’s Blanca , Judy ? Do let her come down , and Terry too ; that ’s a darling ! After all , I ’m their step - mother , ai n’t I ? Or I was , anyhow .... Is Blanca as much of a beauty as ever , Mr. Boyne ? If that girl had more pep I would n’t wonder but what I could do something with her on the screen . Judy , now , would never be any good to us — would she , Wrenny ? Too much of a lady , I always used to tell her .... ”
24255	24263	24264	24265	Lord Wrench	185	“ Shut up : here she is , ”
24345	24464	24320	24321	Miss Scope	147	“ Well , Blanca ! How are you ? How you ’ve grown ! And what a looker you ’re going to be ! Only you ’re so fearfully grand — always was , was n’t she , Judy ? You ’re a lady yourself , but you ai n’t _ such _ a lady . Well , Blanca , shake hands , and let me introduce you to my new husband . Wrenny , this is Blanca , who used to come and stay , with Terry and Judy , when Cliffe and me were married . Where ’s Terry , Blanca ? Why did n’t he come down too ? I ’d love to see him . ”
24465	24474	24476	24476	Blanca	128	“ Terry ’s with his tutor at present , ”
24495	24513	24516	24516	Zinnie	133	“ But he said he would n’t have come down even if he had n’t of been , ”
24527	24554	24516	24516	Zinnie	133	“ He says he is n’t ’ quisitive like Blanca , and he ca n’t be bothered every time somebody comes round to see the steps . ”
24577	24592	24593	24593	she	855	“ Well , I see Terry ’s tutor has n’t taught him manners anyhow , ”
24604	24621	24593	24593	she	855	“ _ In_quisitive , Zinnie ; you ’re really old enough to begin to speak correctly . ”
24622	24637	24638	24638	Zinnie	133	“ No , I ’m not , ’ less Bun and Beechy do too , ”
24641	24648	24649	24650	Miss Scope	147	“ Beatrice and Astorre are foreigners , ”
24654	24675	24649	24650	Miss Scope	147	“ Well , so are you , you old flamingo ! You ’re not a real true Merrican like us ! ”
24676	24679	24681	24681	Blanca	128	“ Zinnie , ”
24694	24701	24681	24681	Blanca	128	“ Terry never said any such thing ”
24723	24778	24720	24720	Judith	127	“ I ’m very sorry , but children who are rude are not to be taken on the yacht today . Father particularly told me to tell you so . Zinnie , if you do n’t apologise at once to Miss Scope I ’m afraid you ’ll have to stay behind alone with Nanny . ”
24779	24810	24811	24812	Lady Wrench	183	“ No , she wo n’t , either , my Zinnie pet wo n’t ! She ’ll go out in the gond’la with her own momma and her new father , ”
24855	24896	24827	24827	She	133	“ Scopy , I ’m not a really naughty Zinnie , say I ’m not—’cos I do n’t want to go out in a bally old gond’la , I want to go’n father ’s steam - yacht , I do ! ”
24909	24931	24932	24932	he	185	“ Jove — she ’s jolly well right , the kid is ! No doubt about her being yours , Zinnia , ”
24946	24981	24982	24982	she	503	“ Zif I could n’t have a yacht of my own any day I like that ’d steam all round that old hulk of Cliffe ’s ! And I will too — you’ll see , ”
24993	25007	24982	24982	she	503	“ Righto . Come along now , and we ’ll pick one out , ”
25015	25022	25023	25023	she	503	“ Well , maybe I will , ”
25052	25101	25041	25041	Blanca	128	“ Your dress is so perfectly lovely , Zinnia ; I think it ’s the prettiest one I ever saw you in . Is n’t it from that Russian place mother ’s always talking about , where it ’s so hard to get them to take new customers ? ”
25111	25189	25102	25103	The star	833	“ You bright child , you ! Well , yes ; it is . But even if your mother could persuade them to take her on she would n’t be able to get this model , because the Grand Duke Anastase designed it expressly for me , and I ’ve got a signed paper saying it ’s the only one of the kind they ’ll ever make . See the way it ’s cut across the shoulders ? ”
25213	25251	25199	25200	Lady Wrench	183	“ I guess anybody that wants to can buy a steam - yacht ; but you can count on one hand with two fingers missing the women that Anastase’ll take the trouble to design a dress for . ”
25252	25264	25265	25266	her husband	411	“ Oh , I say , come on , old girl , ”
25288	25333	25334	25334	She	183	“ Well , goodbye , Zinnie child . Next time I ’ll call for you on my two thousand ton oil - burner . Oh , look here — seen my bag , Wrenny ? I believe I brought some caramels for the child — ”
25383	25419	25420	25420	Blanca	128	“ Here , Zinnie , you put that on , and ask Blanca to look at the pearls under the microscope , and then tell you if they ’re false , like your momma ’s . ”
25426	25464	25420	25420	Blanca	128	“ Oh , Zinnia , I never said yours were false ! Is that what that little brute told you ? I only said , I could n’t be sure they were n’t , at that distance — ”
25470	25544	25545	25545	She	183	“ Well , I should think you ’d have been sure they _ were _ , being so accustomed to your mother ’s . But movie queens do n’t have to wear fake pearls , my pet , ’cos if the real ones get stolen they can always replace ’em . You tell that to Mrs. Cliffe Wheater number three . And you need n’t look so scared — I bear no malice . ”
25554	25573	25574	25574	she	183	“ See , here ’s a ring I brought you : I guess that ’ll bear testing too , ”
25618	25623	25611	25611	She	183	“ Oh , Zinnia , ”
25642	25660	25662	25663	Lady Wrench	183	“ When I give presents I do n’t go to the ten - cent store for them , ”
25673	25796	25797	25797	She	866	“ So long , everybody ! Should n’t wonder if we met again soon by the sad sea waves . Wrenny and I are honeymooning out at the Lido , and maybe you ’ll all be over for the bathing . It ’s getting to be as gay as it is in August . All the smart people are snapping up the bathing tents . The Duke of Mendip ’s got the one next to ours . He ’s Wrenny ’s best friend , you know . By - bye , Judy . Mr. Boyne , hope you ’ll dine with us some night at the Lido Palace to meet the Duke . Ask for the Marchioness of Wrench — you’ll remember ? ”

25885	25892	25893	25893	Boyne	145	“ Well — that ’s over , ”
25913	25916	25917	25917	she	866	“ Yes , ”
25926	25936	25937	25937	she	866	“ Zinnia does n’t really matter , you know , ”
25946	25961	25937	25937	she	866	“ She screams a lot ; but she does n’t mean anything by it . ”
25962	25984	25985	25985	Judith	127	“ Well , I should think you ’d be glad she did n’t , for whatever she meant would be insufferable . ”
25994	26036	25987	25987	her	127	“ We ’re more used to fusses than you are . When there are seven children , and a lot of parents , there ’s always somebody fighting about something . But Zinnia ’s nothing like as bad as she looks . ”
26058	26113	26037	26037	She	866	“ But Blanca got away with my present . Did you see that ? I knew she would ! That ’s what she came down for — to wangle it out of Zinnia . Pretending she thought that old Callot model was one of Anastase ’s ! There ’s nothing mean enough for Blanca ! ”
26144	26192	26132	26132	she	866	“ Not that I care a straw , of course . I ’m too grown up to mind about such rubbish . But I know Blanca must have noticed my ’ nitials on the box . Did n’t you see how quick she was about hiding it ? ”

26795	26838	26779	26779	himself	892	“ We ’ll round up a jolly crowd for you , see if we do n’t . Somebody ’s sure to turn up who ’ll jump at the chance . Judy , ca n’t we hustle around and find him a girl ? ”
26839	26848	26849	26849	Boyne	145	“ Here ’s all the girl I want , ”
26868	26883	26865	26865	her	893	“ Oh , Martin — if you would — oh , ca n’t you ? ”
27383	27396	27397	27397	he	145	“ Hang it all , you ca n’t have it both ways , ”
27538	27548	27549	27549	he	145	“ Bethesda is what you ought to call this , ”
27772	27779	27780	27780	she	162	“ You do really like it ? ”
27815	27828	27829	27829	he	145	“ I like it most of all for being so like you , ”
27866	27881	27860	27860	she	162	“ Like me ? Which — the _ châlet _ or the Cristallo group ? ”
27882	27895	27832	27832	She	162	“ Well , both ; that ’s the funny part of it . ”
27896	27908	27832	27832	She	162	“ It must make me seem a trifle out of drawing . ”
27909	27926	27927	27927	She	162	“ No ; first aloof and aloft , and then again small and sunny and near . ”
27935	27971	27927	27927	She	162	“ Well , I prefer the last part of the picture . I ’d a good deal rather be a sunny balcony than a crystal peak . But I enjoy looking out on the peak . ”
27972	28001	28002	28002	She	162	“ There you are — that ’s what I meant ! It ’s the view from _ you _ that I ’ve missed so , all these years . ”
28020	28029	27927	27927	She	162	“ That will do for our first evening , ”
28033	28042	27927	27927	She	162	“ But I like it , you know ! ”
28047	28075	28044	28044	she	162	“ I ’m glad you came up here after Venice and the millionaires . It ’s all to the good for the mountains — and for me . ”
28967	28976	28962	28963	Judith Wheater	127	“ Perhaps you might lend me some books . ”
29095	29102	29088	29088	she	162	“ How charming is divine philosophy ! ”
29202	29209	29184	29185	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ What were you thinking of ? ”
29253	29276	29277	29277	She	163	“ Seeing you so hard at work reminds me of all the letters I have n’t written since I ’ve been here . ”
29291	29312	29287	29287	she	163	“ Why does n’t he tell me that he ’s no one to write to when he ’s with me ? ”
29317	29345	29314	29314	she	163	“ You know I ’m burdened with any number of fond relations who are consumed with the desire to know how I ’m spending my first holiday . ”
29346	29353	29358	29358	she	163	“ You ’re a wonderful correspondent . ”
29361	29366	29358	29358	she	163	“ So are you . ”

29450	29459	29460	29460	he	958	“ _ Because _ there ’s no moon , ”

31016	31036	31012	31012	She	163	“ You goose . A year from Charles ’s death . It ’s only seven months since he died . ”
31037	31047	30970	30971	Mr. Dobree	200	“ What of that ? You were notoriously unhappy — ”
31048	31055	31056	31056	He	200	“ Oh , _ notoriously _ — ”
31064	31085	31056	31056	He	200	“ I admit the term is inappropriate . But I do n’t suppose anybody thinks your marriage was unmitigated bliss . ”
31086	31100	30970	30971	Mr. Dobree	200	“ Do n’t you see , dear ? That ’s the very reason . ”
31101	31125	30970	30971	Mr. Dobree	200	“ Oh , hang reasons — especially unreasonable ones ! Why have you got to be unhappy now because you were unhappy then ? ”
31126	31148	31056	31056	He	200	“ I ’m not unhappy now . I do n’t think I could be , ever again , if I tried . ”

31395	31418	31387	31387	she	163	“ Why do you particularly want to consider Aunt Julia ? I seem to remember her as a peculiarly stupid old lady . ”
31419	31424	31425	31425	she	163	“ Yes , dear , ”
31428	31441	31425	31425	she	163	“ But it ’s just because she _ is _ peculiarly stupid — ”
31442	31474	31387	31387	she	163	“ If you call that a sufficient reason , we shall never get married . In a family as large as yours there ’ll always be somebody stupid left to consider . ”

31796	31816	31763	31763	her	498	“ Well , then , pack up , and let ’s go straight off to Paris and get married . ”
31817	31850	31763	31763	her	498	“ Martin , you ought to understand . I ca n’t be married before my year of mourning ’s out . For my own sake I ca n’t ; and for yours . ”
31851	31855	31763	31763	her	498	“ Damn mine ! ”

32525	32544	32498	32498	He	145	“ Poor little thing ! I forgot this ; I meant to show it to you days ago . ”
32545	32553	32498	32498	He	145	“ Who ’s the poor little thing ? ”
32644	32651	32652	32652	he	145	“ How lovely she still is , ”
32687	32742	32681	32681	she	127	“ I suppose it ’s from the little Wheater girl you wrote about ? Poor little thing indeed ! It ’s too dreadful . I did n’t know there really _ were _ such people . But who are the Wheaters she speaks of in the postscript , who are not to be told ? ”
32751	32765	32766	32766	He	145	“ Her parents ? Why does she speak of them in that way ? ”
32810	32833	32766	32766	He	145	“ Oh , Martin , it ’s too horrible ! Are you serious ? Did the poor child really tell you that ? ”
32834	32845	32846	32846	She	127	“ The governess did — as a matter of course . ”
32852	32871	32846	32846	She	127	“ The sort of governesses they must have , in a world where the parents are like that ! ”
32872	32894	32896	32896	he	145	“ Well , this particular one is a regular old Puritan brick . She and Judith keep the whole show together . ”

32913	32928	32929	32930	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ She does n’t appear to have grounded her pupils very thoroughly in spelling , ”
32954	32996	32940	32940	she	163	“ There ’s a lot I do n’t begin to understand . Who are these people that Mrs. Wheater wants to invite on the yacht because they know a Duke , and Mr. Wheater wo n’t because it ’s too low ? ”
32997	33047	32934	32934	her	163	“ They ’re Lord and Lady Wrench . Was n’t there a lot in the papers a month or two ago about Lord Wrench ’s marrying a movie star ? He has a racing - stable ; I believe he ’s very rich . Her name was Zinnia Lacrosse . ”
33048	33078	33079	33079	Her	163	“ A perfect name . But why , in the Wheater world , are movie stars regarded as too low ? Too low for what — or for whom ? ”
33087	33104	33079	33079	Her	163	“ Well , this one happens to have been Wheater ’s wife — for a time . ”
33105	33111	32934	32934	her	163	“ His _ wife _ ? ”
33112	33149	32934	32934	her	163	“ Not for long , though . They ’ve been divorced for much longer than they were married . So I suppose Mrs. Wheater does n’t see the use of making a retrospective fuss about it . ”
33150	33169	33079	33079	Her	163	“ Practical woman ! And who ’s the Gerald that she and the other lady are fighting for ? ”
33170	33239	32934	32934	her	163	“ Oh , he ’s the boy ’s tutor ; Terry ’s tutor . Or was to have been . I ’m afraid he ’s a rotter too . But Terry , poor chap , is the best fellow you ever saw . I back him and Judith and Scopy to keep the ship on her course , whatever happens . If only Terry ’s health holds out . ”
33240	33248	32934	32934	her	163	“ And they get him another tutor . ”
33249	33262	33268	33268	her	163	“ As things go , he ’s lucky if he has any . ”
33332	33347	33323	33323	her	163	“ Do n’t the Wheaters _ care _ in the least about their children ? ”
33394	33402	33403	33403	she	163	“ Do n’t they _ care _ ? ”
33406	33499	33403	33403	she	163	“ Oddly enough , I believe they do . I ’m afraid that ’s going to be our difficulty . Why should they have taken on the steps if they had n’t cared ? They certainly seem very fond of the children , whenever they ’re with them . But it ’s one thing to be fond of children , and another to know how to look after them . My impression is that they realised their incapacity long ago , and that ’s why they dumped the whole problem on Judy . ”
33500	33520	33555	33556	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Long ago ? But how old is Judy ? This is the writing of a child of ten . ”
33521	33548	33403	33403	she	163	“ She ’s had no time to learn any other , with six children to look after . But I suppose she ’s fifteen or sixteen . ”
33549	33554	33403	33403	she	163	“ Fifteen or sixteen ! ”
33562	33570	33555	33556	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Young enough to be my daughter . ”
33582	33589	33577	33577	his	1020	“ I wish she had been ! ”
33627	33639	33602	33602	he	1020	“ What are you going to do about it , dearest ? ”
33640	33651	33659	33659	he	1020	“ That ’s what I want you to tell me . ”
33698	33708	33602	33602	he	1020	“ Of course you must write to her father . ”
33709	33724	33602	33602	he	1020	“ Well — perhaps . But doing that wo n’t get us much forrarder . ”
33725	33762	33659	33659	he	1020	“ Not if you appeal to him — point out that the children ought n’t to be kept in Venice any longer ? Did n’t you say he knew the climate was bad for the boy ? ”
33763	33838	33602	33602	he	1020	“ Yes ; and Wheater will respond at once — in words ! He ’ll say : ‘ Damn it , Joyce , Boyne ’s right . What are the children doing here ? We ’ll pack them off to the Engadine to - morrow . ’ Then he ’ll cram my letter into his pocket , and no one will ever see it again , except the valet when he brushes his coat . ”
33839	33859	33602	33602	he	1020	“ But the mother — Joyce , or whatever her name is ? If he tells _ her _ — ”
33860	33868	33659	33659	he	1020	“ Well , there ’s the hitch . ”
33869	33873	33602	33602	he	1020	“ What hitch ? ”
33874	33889	33602	33602	he	1020	“ Supposing she wants to keep the children in Venice on account of Gerald ? ”
33890	33902	33659	33659	he	1020	“ Gerald ? Oh , the tutor ! Oh , Martin — ”
33911	33925	33909	33909	her	1021	“ And you dare to tell me she ’s fond of her children ! ”
33926	33972	33602	33602	he	1020	“ So she is ; awfully fond . But everything rushes past her in a whirl . Life ’s a perpetual film to those people . You ca n’t get up out of your seat in the audience and change the current of a film . ”
33973	33983	33984	33984	He	1022	“ What _ can _ you do about it ? ”
33997	34022	33984	33984	He	1022	“ Ca n’t think . Unless I were to drop down to Venice for a day or two , and try talking to them . ”
34039	34053	34054	34054	he	1022	“ Writing to that kind of people ’s never any sort of good , ”
34107	34113	34089	34089	she	163	“ Go back to Venice ? ”
34124	34171	34121	34121	her	163	“ I do n’t see of what use that would be . It ’s a good deal to ask you to take that stifling journey again . And if you do n’t know what to write , how would you know any better what to say ? ”
34172	34196	34121	34121	her	163	“ Perhaps I should n’t . But at any rate I could feel my way . And I might comfort Judith a little . ”
34197	34206	34207	34207	She	163	“ Poor child ! I wish you could . ”
34213	34273	34274	34274	He	1026	“ But I should try writing first . Do n’t you think so ? Write to her too , of course . Whatever you decide , you ’d better begin by feeling your way . It ’s always awkward to interfere in family matters , and if you turned up again suddenly the Wheaters might think it rather odd . ”
34310	34317	34318	34318	he	1026	“ I daresay you ’re right , ”
34436	34470	34471	34471	he	1026	“ Poor little thing , she ’s always rather overwrought , and very likely she just had a passing panic when she wrote . Hang it , I wish she had n’t written , ”
34498	34512	34513	34513	Boyne	145	“ Of course I ’ve written to her — I wrote last night , ”
34560	34588	34552	34553	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ I ’m so glad , dear . I should have hated to feel that our being so happy here had made you neglect your little friend . ”
34669	34671	34682	34682	he	145	“ Palace ”
34830	34888	34889	34889	Boyne	145	“ The girl in peach - colour , over there by the column — lovely , is n’t she ? Only one has seen her a thousand times , in all the ‘ Vogues ’ and ‘ Tatlers . ’ Oh , Martin , wo n’t it be too awful if beauty ends by being standardised too ? ”
34928	34954	34955	34955	he	145	“ I ’m sure if I owned one of these new beauties I should n’t always be able to pick her out in a crowd , ”
34975	34981	34958	34958	She	163	“ That one you would .... ”
34982	34989	34960	34960	her	163	“ A new beauty ? Where ? ”
34990	35057	35058	35058	He	145	“ Beauty — no . Hardly pretty ... but different . The girl who ’s just come in . Where ’s she vanished to ? Oh , she ’s speaking to the porter . Now she ’s looking this way — but you ca n’t see her from where you ’re sitting . She ’s hardly more than a child ; but the face is interesting . ”
35074	35083	35065	35066	The porter	3050	“ Young lady asking for you , sir . ”
35163	35165	35148	35149	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ different ”
35202	35217	35218	35218	He	145	“ Wait a minute , will you ? It ’s some one I know . ”
35236	35248	35227	35227	Judith	127	“ Child ! Where in the world have you dropped from ? ”
35249	35264	35265	35265	He	145	“ Oh , Martin , Martin ! I was so afraid you ’d gone ! ”
35304	35325	35296	35296	he	145	“ Judy , how in the world did you get here ? Have the heads of the clan come too ? ”
35326	35333	35334	35334	She	127	“ Oh , Martin , Martin ! ”
35364	35388	35389	35389	He	145	“ Is n’t there a writing - room somewhere that we could go to ? There ’s never anybody in them after dinner . ”
35441	35458	35435	35435	her	127	“ Oh , Martin , say you ’re glad ! I must hear you say it ! ”
35459	35470	35427	35427	She	127	“ Glad , child ? Of course I ’m glad . ”
35477	35502	35503	35503	She	127	“ But you look dead - beat , Judy . What ’s the matter ? Has anything gone wrong ? Are your people here ? ”
35518	35552	35503	35503	She	127	“ If you mean father and mother , they ’re in Venice . They do n’t know we ’re here . You must n’t be angry , Martin : we ’ve run away . ”
35553	35562	35435	35435	her	127	“ Run away ? Who ’s run away ? ”
35563	35680	35681	35681	She	1058	“ All of us ; with Scopy and Nanny . I always said we ’d have to , some day . Scopy and Terry and I managed it . We ’re at the _ Pension Rosenglüh _ , down the hill . Father and mother will never guess we ’re here . They think we ’ve gone to America on the Cunarder that touched at Venice yesterday . I left a letter to say we had . Terry was splendid ; he invented it all . We hired motors at Padua to come here . But I ’m afraid he ’s dreadfully done up . This air will put him right though , wo n’t it ? ”
35725	35739	35740	35740	she	1058	“ The air here is something wonderful , Martin , is n’t it ? ”
35751	35759	35740	35740	she	1058	“ There ’s simply nothing like it . ”
35767	35776	35777	35777	she	1058	“ I knew I was right to come , ”
35807	35838	35777	35777	she	1058	“ Judy , you ’re dreadfully done up yourself , and you look famished . It ’s after ten . Have you had anything to eat since you got here ? ”
35839	35869	35909	35909	her	1058	“ I do n’t believe I have . There was n’t time . I had to see the children settled first , and then make sure you were here . ”
35870	35891	35909	35909	her	1058	“ Of course I ’m here . But before we do any more talking you ’ve got to be fed . ”
35892	35904	35909	35909	her	1058	“ Well , it would be nice to have a bite , ”
35914	35925	35905	35905	she	1058	“ Wait here , and I ’ll go and forage . ”
36002	36005	36036	36037	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ salon , ”
36039	36052	36053	36053	he	145	“ Oh , well , she ’s got bored and gone home , ”
36301	36309	36310	36310	she	163	“ Well , we ’re all here , ”
36315	36319	36320	36320	he	145	“ Not Chip ? ”
36325	36345	36320	36320	he	145	“ Chip ? I should think so ! Do you suppose I ’d have stirred an inch without Chip ? ”
36346	36367	36433	36433	her	1069	“ But what the deuce is it all about , child ? Have you gone crazy , all of you ? ”
36368	36392	36433	36433	her	1069	“ Father and mother have . They do , you know . I warned father we ’d run away if it happened again . ”
36393	36397	36433	36433	her	1069	“ What happened ? ”
36398	36430	36431	36431	She	1069	“ Why , what I told you would . But I do n’t suppose you ever got my letter ? I was sure you ’d have answered it if you had . ”
36449	36457	36433	36433	her	1069	“ Tell me all about it now . ”
36458	36531	36433	36433	her	1069	“ Well , everything went to smash . I knew it would . And then all the old shouting began — about detectives , and lawyers , and mother ’s alimony . You know that ’s what the children mean when they talk about mother ’s old friend Sally Money . They ’ve heard about her ever since they can remember . They think mother sends for her whenever anything goes wrong .... ”
36532	36540	36433	36433	her	1069	“ And things have gone thoroughly wrong ? ”
36541	36653	36654	36654	She	1071	“ Worse than ever . They were dividing us up already . Bun and Beechy back to Buondelmonte , because he ’s married a rich American . And Zinnia is ready to take Zinnie . Lord Wrench thinks she ’s so awfully funny . And father would have had Chip , of course , and we three older ones would have begun to be sent back and forth again as we used to be , like the shabby old books Scopy used to get out of the lending library at Biarritz . You could keep the stupid ones as long as you liked , but the jolly ones only a week . ”
36662	36681	36654	36654	She	1071	“ Now , Martin , did n’t I _ have _ to get them all away from it ? ”
36726	36764	36713	36713	He	1072	“ Child , you ’re too tired . All the rest will keep till to - morrow . Put on your hat now , and I ’ll take you down the hill to your _ pension _ . ”
36765	36780	36713	36713	He	1072	“ But , Martin , you ’ll promise and swear to see us through ? ”
36781	36807	36810	36810	he	1072	“ Through everything , bless you . On Scopy ’s book . And now come along , or you ’ll fall asleep in your tracks . ”
36949	36985	36986	36986	She	127	“ Oh , you need n’t ring , Martin . It would wake everybody . I do n’t believe the door ’s locked . I told Scopy to see that I was n’t shut out . ”
37008	37033	37034	37034	she	127	“ Martin , darling , I do n’t believe I ’d ever have dared if I had n’t known you ’d see us through , ”
37041	37048	37049	37049	he	1083	“ The devil you would n’t ! ”
37061	37073	37053	37053	he	1083	“ I ought never to have given her that second cocktail . ”
37080	37105	37077	37077	he	1083	“ Go upstairs as quietly as you can . I ’ll be down in the morning to see how you ’re all getting on . ”
37570	37583	37558	37558	she	127	“ And now she ’s carried it off with a master hand , ”
37692	37698	37681	37681	Terry	198	“ Desperate ? Really desperate ? ”
37699	37720	37729	37729	he	145	“ Oh , Mr. Boyne ! If you ’d been through it twice before , as my poor children have .... ”
37793	37872	37874	37875	Miss Scope	147	“ I think Judith counts very much on your intervention . That ’s the reason she was so anxious to find you still here . And of course she hopes there ’ll be time — time to consider , to choose a course of action . She believes it will be some days before we ’re found out , as you put it . I daresay she ’s told you that she left a letter ... Mr. Boyne , ”
37884	37925	37926	37926	She	147	“ I hope you do n’t think that , in ordinary circumstances , I should ever condone the least deceit . The children will tell you that on that point I ’m inexorable . But these were not ordinary circumstances . ”
37935	37989	37928	37928	her	147	“ Judith said in the letter that we ’d sailed for America . She thinks her father will hurry there to find them , and in that way we shall gain a little time , for the steamer they ’re supposed to be on is not due in New York for ten days . ”
38017	38042	38013	38013	He	145	“ I hope so . But meanwhile what are you all going to live on ? It costs something to feed such an army . ”
38075	38084	38069	38069	she	147	“ Judith , I understand , has means .... ”
38085	38089	38090	38090	Boyne	145	“ Poor woman ! ”
38093	38105	38106	38106	he	145	“ I believe she ’s plumped in all her savings.—I see , ”
38141	38145	38146	38146	he	145	“ I see , ”
38159	38183	38149	38149	He	145	“ You ’re their real mother . If there ’s anything on earth I can do — to the limit of my small capacity—. ”
38209	38228	38229	38229	He	145	“ I know — I know—. Oh , Mr. Boyne , it ’s providential , our finding you . ”
38381	38390	38391	38391	she	147	“ Come up — I’m deep in papers , ”
38396	38416	38417	38417	he	145	“ I came last night , but your lights were out , and I was afraid of the cook , ”
38471	38478	38479	38479	she	147	“ But not afraid of me ? ”
38482	38514	38479	38479	she	147	“ Of you ? I like that ! You deserted me ; it ’s you who ought to be afraid . I ’ve come to make a row , you know . ”
38515	38544	38571	38571	Her	147	“ You ought to have come to thank me for my tact . I saw you ’d run across old friends , and slipped out of the way . ”
38545	38570	38571	38571	Her	147	“ I ’d run across one young friend — Judith Wheater . When I came back to tell you about it you ’d gone . ”
38580	38606	38571	38571	Her	147	“ Your famous little Judith ? Really ? Why , you always speak of her as such a child — I should n’t have guessed .... ”
38607	38618	38571	38571	Her	147	“ You said yourself last night how young she looked — ”
38619	38631	38703	38703	he	1105	“ Yes ; awfully young ; but still — grown up . ”
38632	38681	38682	38682	She	1103	“ Well , she ’s not grown up . She ’s a child — a child tremendously to be pitied . I want to tell you all about it . I want your help and your advice . You do n’t know what a quandary I ’m in . ”
38718	38726	38712	38712	she	1103	“ A quandary — about that child ? ”
38737	38750	38751	38751	He	1105	“ Martin , you do n’t mean ... you ca n’t ... ? ”
38762	38789	38790	38790	He	1105	“ That the quandary ’s _ mine_—about little Judith ? Bless you , what an idea ! Why , she ’s hardly out of the nursery . ”
38836	38844	38845	38845	he	1105	“ This is a very different business , ”
38849	38898	38845	38845	he	1105	“ Not in the least sentimental , but merely squalid . The Wheater _ ménage _ has gone to smash again , and Judy ’s bolted with all the children , to try to prevent their being separated , as they are whenever there ’s a new deal . ”
38931	38938	38927	38927	she	163	“ Bolted — bolted from whom ? ”
38939	38953	38954	38954	She	163	“ From Joyce and Wheater . Gone clean away , without any warning . ”
38979	38995	38959	38959	her	163	“ But bolted with whom ? They ca n’t have gone away all by themselves ? ”
38996	39046	38954	38954	She	163	“ The governess is with them , and the two nurses . In a crisis like this they all stand by Judith . I ’ve just been talking with the governess , and she entirely approves . You see , they ’ve been through this kind of thing before . ”
39047	39053	38954	38954	She	163	“ Through the running away ? ”
39054	39182	38954	38954	She	163	“ No , but through what led up to it . The last time , it appears , Judith told her parents that if they were divorced again she meant to go off with all the children , rather than have them separated from each other as they were before . You see , whenever a smash comes the children are divided up among the ex - parents , and some of them are pretty rotten , I imagine — a blackmailing Italian prince , a rather notorious movie star , and Lord knows who besides . Not to speak of the new elements to be introduced , if Joyce and Wheater both marry again , as I ’ve no doubt they will , in no time . ”
39232	39241	39224	39224	she	163	“ It ’s all too vile for belief . ”
39242	39245	39246	39246	he	145	“ Exactly , ”
39249	39256	39224	39224	she	163	“ And it ’s all true . ”
39257	39266	39224	39224	she	163	“ The horrors those children must know about — ”
39267	39283	39224	39224	she	163	“ It ’s to save them from more horrors that Judith has carried them away . ”
39284	39294	39295	39295	Her	163	“ I see — I see . Poor child ! ”
39301	39333	39295	39295	Her	163	“ Just at first it was all too new to me . But now I ’m beginning to understand . And I suppose she came here hoping you would help her ? ”
39334	39360	39224	39224	she	163	“ I suppose she did n’t have much time to think or choose , but vaguely remembered I was here , as her letter showed . ”
39361	39396	39397	39397	Boyne	145	“ But the money ? Where in the world did they get the money ? You ca n’t transport a nursery - full of children from one place to another without paying for it . ”
39467	39490	39491	39492	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Well , it ’s all hideous and touching and crazy . Where are the poor little things — at your hotel ? ”
39506	39521	39522	39522	Boyne	145	“ I should like you to take me down at once to see them . ”
39619	39640	39605	39605	he	145	“ You ’d better see her first without the others . You might find the seven of them rather overwhelming . ”
39696	39712	39728	39728	he	145	“ If you think she wo n’t be too frightened of a strange old woman ? ”
39799	39803	39804	39804	he	145	“ If only , ”
39809	39821	39804	39804	he	145	“ Judith does n’t begin by saying something that will startle her ”
39984	39993	39994	39994	he	145	“ You look like a pansy this morning , ”
40035	40154	40155	40155	She	1126	“ How horrid of you ! Nasty wired things in wreaths at funerals ! I do n’t feel a bit as if I were at a funeral . It ’s so jolly to be here , and to have found you . You ’ve come to say you ’ll lunch with us , have n’t you ? The children will be mad with joy . It was partly because I promised them we ’d find you here that they agreed to come . Blanca and Zinnie unsettled them at first — they’re always afraid of missing some excitement if they have a row with mother . But I told them we ’d have lots more excitement with you . ”
40172	40211	40155	40155	She	1126	“ I must tell the landlady you ’re coming to lunch . Scopy ’s upstairs with Terry , and she told me to be sure not to forget , so that the cook could give us something extra . ”
40260	40276	40252	40252	Boyne	145	“ And first , I was to ask you what pudding you ’d particularly like . ”
40277	40290	40291	40291	She	127	“ Oh , bless you , any pudding . But about lunch — ”
40303	40330	40291	40291	She	127	“ Or perhaps you ’re here incog . , with a lady , and would rather not come ? I told Scopy I should n’t wonder — ”
40331	40339	40252	40252	Boyne	145	“ Nonsense , Judith ; how absurd — ”
40340	40365	40366	40366	She	127	“ Why absurd ? Why should n’t you be here with a lady ? _ Vous êtes encore très bien , mon cher .... _ ”
40382	40417	40366	40366	She	127	“ Do n’t talk like a manicure , child . As a matter of fact , I have an old friend here who wants very much to see you , and who kindly suggested — ”
40418	40425	40252	40252	Boyne	145	“ An old lady - friend ? ”
40426	40429	40252	40252	Boyne	145	“ Yes . ”
40430	40436	40366	40366	She	127	“ As old as Scopy ? ”
40437	40454	40252	40252	Boyne	145	“ No ; probably not as old as your mother , even . I only meant — ”
40455	40478	40479	40479	Judith	127	“ But if she ’s younger than mother , how can you say she ’s old ? Is she prettier , too ? ”
40484	40497	40479	40479	Judith	127	“ I do n’t know , really ; I have n’t thought — ”
40498	40530	40252	40252	Boyne	145	“ Well , I do n’t believe she ’s as well - dressed . Unless , perhaps , you think Joyce ’s clothes are sometimes just a shade _ too _ — ”
40531	40588	40252	40252	Boyne	145	“ I have n’t thought about that either . What I mean by ‘ old ’ is that Mrs. Sellars and I have been friends for years . She ’s living in a _ châlet _ on the hill above the hotels ; and she wants me to bring you up to lunch with her today . ”
40589	40595	40596	40596	Judith	127	“ Me — only me ? ”
40605	40678	40602	40602	Boyne	145	“ Well , my dear , I ’m sure she would have liked to invite you all , Chip included ; but her house is tiny and could n’t possibly take in the whole party . So , to avoid invidious distinctions , why not come by yourself and make her acquaintance ? I want you awfully to know her , for no one can give you better advice than she can . ”
40691	40716	40679	40679	Judith	127	“ I do n’t want anybody ’s advice but yours , Martin . But of course I ’ll go if you want me to . ”
40717	40779	40815	40815	his	1131	“ It ’s not a question of what I want . But you may be sure if my advice is any good it will be because I ’ve consulted Mrs. Sellars . Two ’s not too many to get you out of this predicament . I sometimes think you do n’t realise what an awful row you ’re all in for . ”
40780	40808	40809	40809	Judith	127	“ If she ’s not as old as mother , and you ’ve never noticed how she ’s dressed , you must be in love with her , ”
40827	40842	40843	40843	he	1131	“ I do n’t see what difference it makes if I am or not , ”
40852	40872	40809	40809	Judith	127	“ The point is that she happens to be one of the kindest and most sensible women I know — ”
40873	40881	40883	40883	Judith	127	“ That ’s what men always think , ”
40899	40910	40911	40911	she	127	“ It ’s a wonderful thing to be in love , ”
40922	40969	40970	40970	she	127	“ Blanca ’s ever so much sharper than I am . She said : ‘ Why ’s Martin in such an awful hurry to rush away from Venice , if he is n’t slipping off on the quiet to meet a friend ? ’ I suppose , ”
40988	41031	40970	40970	she	127	“ it was awfully stupid of me to blunder in on you like this , and you ’re racking your brains to think how you can get rid of us all , and keep out of a row with father and mother . ”
41072	41220	41066	41066	his	145	“ Look here , Judith , I could shake you when you talk such drivel . The only thing I ’m racking my brains about is how to help you to get what you want . To keep you all together , as you are now , and yet not let your father and mother think that I ’ve had anything to do with this performance . You ’re quite right ; I do want to stay on good terms with them , because if I do I may succeed in persuading them that , whatever happens , they ’ve no right to separate you children again . If I do that I shall have done my best for you . But I do n’t see my way to it yet , and that ’s why I want you to come and make friends with Mrs. Sellars . ”
41248	41284	41224	41224	she	1133	“ Of course I ’ll do what you want , Martin . But do n’t you think your friend would perhaps understand better if I had Nanny bring up Chip to see her after lunch ? ”
41285	41294	41295	41295	he	1132	“ Bless you — of course she would , ”
41437	41449	41450	41450	Boyne	145	“ I ’ll bring her down to see him after lunch , ”
41542	41584	41585	41585	Boyne	145	“ If only father and mother will let us stay here I ’m sure I shall be patched up this time . And you ’ll be here for a bit to look after the children , wo n’t you , Martin ? ”
41634	41678	41630	41630	Terry	198	“ That ’s just why Judy and I decided to come here . We knew that if we could get hold of you , you ’d back us up , and help us to make some kind of terms with father and mother . ”
41690	41854	41855	41855	Terry	198	“ You see , Martin , it wo n’t do , separating us again — it really wo n’t . We ’re not going to get any sort of education at this rate . And as for manners ! The children have all been completely demoralised since Zinnia ’s visit . Now they ’ve heard of Buondelmonte ’s marriage , and the steps have gone off their base too ; and as for Blanca she thinks of nothing but dressing - up and flirtation .... As soon as things go wrong between father and mother the children seem to feel it in the air ; even before the actual fighting begins , they all get out of hand . Zinnie gave Bun a black eye the other day because he said he was going to be a Prince again , and live in his father ’s palace in Rome , and have his own Rolls ... a child who hardly knows his letters ! ”
41863	41875	41876	41876	Boyne	145	“ I know , old man . It ’s all wrong , ”
41879	41936	41876	41876	Boyne	145	“ and something ’s got to be done , and done soon . That ’s what I ’m going to try to make your father and mother see . Meanwhile you must make the most of this respite to get a good rest . I promise I ’ll do what I can when the time comes . ”
41937	41945	41946	41946	Terry	198	“ Oh , you need n’t promise , ”
42128	42132	42157	42157	Joyce	197	“ Fancy Girl , ”
42260	42278	42279	42279	Boyne	145	“ What — what ? Marry _ you _ ? Have you all of you gone crazy ? ”
42288	42308	42285	42285	Judith	127	“ I ’m not crazy . And I ’m nearly sixteen . And I suppose I ’m a nairess . ”
42320	42353	42285	42285	Judith	127	“ But you do n’t imagine I ’d leave the children , do you ? Besides , Terry says it would be ridiculous to marry till I can learn how to spell . ”
42354	42364	42366	42366	Boyne	145	“ My God — I should say it would , ”
42393	42398	42382	42382	she	127	“ Judith , look here—. ”
42399	42409	42410	42410	she	127	“ But I do n’t know , after all , ”
42419	42450	42410	42410	she	127	“ Gerald says some of the greatest people never _ could _ spell . Napoleon couldn’t — or Madame de Sévigné — and Shakespeare signed his name differently every time . ”
42451	42465	42466	42466	Boyne	145	“ I see you ’ve taken a course in history since I left , ”
42476	42497	42471	42471	she	127	“ No ; but he told me that one day when he found me crying because of my awful spelling . ”
42498	42537	42410	42410	she	127	“ Well , you ’re quite right to cry about your spelling . And Terry ’s quite right to say that the first thing you want is to have some sort of an education , all of you . ”
42538	42554	42555	42555	she	127	“ Perhaps , then , it would have been better for me to marry Gerald , ”
42566	42570	42571	42571	she	127	“ But no , ”
42575	42593	42571	42571	she	127	“ I never could have kept the children if I had ; so what ’s the use ? ”
42594	42601	42602	42602	Boyne	145	“ Well , here we are , ”
42607	42622	42602	42602	Boyne	145	“ Why , you poor child , how young you are , after all ! ”
42695	42700	42701	42701	she	127	“ Young for what ? ”
42709	42717	42718	42719	the other	548	“ Why — for all your responsibilities , ”
42746	42755	42756	42756	she	127	“ I suppose I ought to be flattered , ”
42759	42798	42756	42756	she	127	“ I know that at your age and mother ’s it ’s thought awfully flattering to be called young . But , you see , I ’m not sixteen yet , so it ’s nothing extraordinary to me . ”
42799	42820	42821	42822	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Your being so young makes it extraordinarily kind of you to come and see an old lady like me , ”
42840	42863	42832	42832	Judith	127	“ Oh , but I wanted to come . Martin says you ’ll be a friend ; and we need friends badly . ”
42872	42927	42864	42865	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Martin ’s quite right . I ’ll be as good a friend as you ’ll let me . I ’m so glad you ’ve come to share my picnic lunch . And Martin will have told you how sorry I was not to have room for the whole party in this tiny house . ”
42928	42931	42933	42933	Judith	127	“ Well , ”
42935	42945	42933	42933	Judith	127	“ he thought you ’d find us rather overwhelming — ”
43055	43057	43044	43044	she	163	“ steps ”
43061	43067	43068	43068	she	163	“ For I assure you , ”
43071	43084	43068	43068	she	163	“ I ’m not as easily overwhelmed as Martin seems to think . ”
43123	43191	43192	43192	She	127	“ Oh , Terry ’s far and away the best of us ; you ’ll love Terry . If only he could have half a chance . I do n’t mean about his health ; father and mother have really done all they could about that . But he ’s never had any proper education , and he is n’t strong enough yet to go to school . ”
43378	43380	43375	43375	her	163	“ luck ”
43392	43394	43458	43459	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ rotten ”
43398	43435	43436	43436	Judith	127	“ But surely it ’s just a passing whim of — of your mother ’s . When it comes to the point , she wo n’t break up everything in order to marry this young man . ”
43441	43457	43436	43436	Judith	127	“ Well , what can mother do — if she ’s in love with him ? ”
43477	43495	43467	43467	she	163	“ Why , she could ... she could ... think of all of you , my dear . ”
43496	43504	43505	43505	Judith	127	“ Oh , she ’ll do that , ”
43508	43534	43505	43505	Judith	127	“ She has already . She and father are fighting over us now . That ’s why we bolted . Has n’t Martin told you ? ”
43535	43561	43563	43564	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ I think Martin felt he ’d rather have you tell me about it yourself — that is , as much as you care to , ”
43581	43644	43570	43570	Judith	127	“ I do n’t know that there ’s anything more to tell . I brought the children away so that we should n’t be separated again . If children do n’t look after each other , who ’s going to do it for them ? You ca n’t expect parents to , when they do n’t know how to look after themselves . ”
43645	43651	43653	43654	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Ah , my dear , ”
43668	43693	43660	43660	she	163	“ Just say that to your mother as you ’ve said it to me , and she ’ll never give you up for anybody . ”
43706	43735	43736	43736	she	163	“ She has before , you know . What are you to do when you fall in love ? That ’s one thing I never mean to do , ”
43744	43750	43751	43751	she	163	“ Besides , you know , ”
43755	43774	43751	43751	she	163	“ one does get used to children . I suppose you ’ve never had any , have you ? ”
43784	43789	43790	43790	Judith	127	“ Oh , well , ”
43794	43866	43790	43790	Judith	127	“ I daresay it ’s not too late . But if you ’d had all of us on your hands , and the three steps besides , you ’d probably take us for granted by this time . Not that mother is n’t fond of us — only she has these heart - storms . That ’s what poor Doll Westway used to call them . And _ she _ knew — ”
43882	43887	43867	43868	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Doll Westway — ? ”
43894	43899	43888	43888	Judith	127	“ You knew her ? ”
43900	43903	43905	43906	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ No , ”
43925	43933	43934	43934	Judith	127	“ She was my very best friend , ”
43938	43956	43934	43934	Judith	127	“ You never saw anybody so lovely to look at . In tea - rose bathing tights — ”
43957	43961	43962	43963	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ My dear , ”
43966	44004	43962	43963	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ do n’t you think it seems a pity to sit indoors in such weather ? If you ’ve finished your coffee , shall we move out on the balcony ? Martin , do find the cigarettes . ”
44084	44094	44095	44095	Judith	127	“ Hullo ! This way — here I am ! ”
44117	44130	44103	44104	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Here ’s somebody too beautiful not to be the celebrated Chip . ”
44190	44195	44186	44186	his	145	“ Damn Aunt Julia . ”
44272	44282	44284	44284	Judith	127	“ Oh , Chip ’s a good enough fellow , ”
44289	44297	44284	44284	Judith	127	“ But wait till you see Terry .... ”
44298	44311	44253	44253	Chip	123	“ Terry could n’t come ; but the rest of us have , ”
44321	44331	44253	44253	Chip	123	“ Good gracious ! If it is n’t Zinnie ! ”
44378	44406	44407	44407	Nanny	156	“ Well , if ever — I never did ! Susan swore to me she ’d never let ’em out of her sight while we was away , ”
44417	44424	44426	44426	Zinnie	133	“ She never did , neither , ”
44429	44474	44426	44426	Zinnie	133	“ She watched us almost all the way ; but we could run faster than her , ’cos she ’s got a shoe’t hurts her , ’ n ’ so after a while she had to give up chasing us . Did n’t she ? ”
44481	44483	44516	44516	Beechy	154	“ steps ”
44531	44549	44550	44550	she	154	“ Oh , my Cheepo , we thought we ’d losted you , and you were dead , ”
44564	44620	44555	44555	Chip	123	“ Yes , ’ n ’ Judy had n’t ought to of sneaked away and left us all like that , ’ n ’ not said anything ’bout coming here , but only ’ ranged for Chip to come and see you , when he ’s the youngest of the bunch — ought she of ? ”
44676	44681	44682	44682	she	163	“ And I suppose , ”
44686	44701	44682	44682	she	163	“ Chipstone was chosen to represent you because he takes up the least room . ”
44702	44714	44716	44716	Bun	135	“ No , he does n’t , either ; I do ! ”
44730	44743	44773	44773	Judith	127	“ I can crawl through a croky hoop , and I can — ”
44744	44771	44773	44773	Judith	127	“ You ca n’t hold your tongue , and Chip can , and that ’s why I brought him , and not the rest of you , ”
44794	44800	44782	44782	Nanny	156	“ Oh , these dreadful children—. ”
44839	44846	44847	44847	Blanca	128	“ I _ am _ so sorry—. ”
44877	44921	44925	44925	she	128	“ Poor Susan told me they ’d run away from her when they found Nanny was coming here with Chip , and I rushed after them , but could n’t catch them . I ’m sorry , but it was n’t my fault . ”
44946	44950	44951	44951	She	128	“ Darling Martin ! ”
44964	44971	44972	44972	she	128	“ I ’m Terry ’s twin , ”
45030	45051	45019	45019	Blanca	128	“ Oh , but when you ’ve seen Terry you wo n’t care for any of the rest of us . ”
45052	45071	45072	45072	Bun	135	“ Yes , she will ; she ’ll care for Beechy and me because we ’re Roman Princes ! ”
45099	45119	45120	45120	she	133	“ My mother could buy ’em all out if she wanted to , ’cos she ’s a movie star , ”
45128	45175	45120	45120	she	133	“ But I ’d never let her , ’cos we all love each other very much , ’ n ’ Judy ’s made us all swear on Scopy ’s book we ’d stay together till we got married . I ’m probably going to marry Bun . ”
45204	45227	45191	45191	Bun	135	“ My _ real _ mother was a lion - tamer ; but that do n’t matter , ’cos she ’s dead . ”
45308	45328	45299	45299	Zinnie	133	“ I s’pose ’ f you ’d known we were coming you ’d have had some presents ready for us—. ”
45358	45369	45353	45354	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Come up to - morrow and you ’ll see ! ”
45512	45519	45508	45508	she	163	“ I ’m glad I came . ”
45562	45610	45549	45549	he	145	“ For God ’s sake wire at once if children with you and Chipstone all right worried to death can not understand insane performance police traced them to Padua where they hired motors for Botzen please ship them all back immediately will wire you funds . Wheater . ”
45611	45627	45628	45628	Boyne	145	“ Damn it — well , I ’ll have to go and see him myself , ”
45685	45694	45675	45675	he	145	“ Too late to wire tonight , anyhow . ”
45696	45706	45707	45707	Boyne	145	“ Here — how was I to answer this ? ”
45871	45877	45865	45866	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ When did this come ? ”
45878	45893	45894	45894	She	163	“ Just now . I found it when I went back to the hotel . ”
45897	45941	45894	45894	She	163	“ Of course the Wheaters were bound to find out within twenty - four hours where they ’d gone . Poor little conspirators ! I wish we could have kept them a day or two longer ... especially with that boy so overdone .... ”
45942	45949	45950	45950	Her	163	“ Well , perhaps we can . ”
45954	45957	45950	45950	Her	163	“ How ? ”
45967	45980	45964	45964	he	145	“ You have n’t told me yet what I ’m to answer . ”
45988	46010	45981	45981	Her	163	“ What _ can _ you answer ? Their father’ll come and fetch them if you do n’t send them back . ”
46011	46019	46034	46034	she	163	“ I certainly sha n’t do that . ”
46020	46028	46029	46029	Her	163	“ Sha n’t — ? Then what ? ”
46054	46065	46045	46045	she	163	“ I confess I ’m curious to hear your alternative . ”
46075	46083	46066	46066	He	145	“ Why should I answer at all ? ”
46084	46121	46034	46034	she	163	“ If you do n’t , Wheater has only to telephone to your hotel , and find out if you ’re still here , and if you ’ve been seen about with a party of children . ”
46122	46144	46034	46034	she	163	“ I sha n’t be here . I ’ll pack off at once — to Pieve di Cadore , or somewhere . ”
46145	46150	46066	46066	He	145	“ And the children ? ”
46151	46159	46034	46034	she	163	“ I ’ll take them with me . ”
46160	46165	46034	46034	she	163	“ Are you serious ? ”
46166	46169	46170	46170	She	1209	“ Absolutely . ”
46179	46218	46170	46170	She	1209	“ Then you ’re a child yourself , dear . How long do you suppose it will be before you ’re run down ? You ’ll only be making things worse for the children — and for yourself . ”
46219	46226	46227	46227	He	1210	“ Hang myself ! But for them—. ”
46233	46249	46227	46227	He	1210	“ Well , damn it ; perhaps . But what have you got to suggest ? ”
46250	46291	46292	46292	He	1210	“ That you should persuade Judith to take them straight back , of course . I ’m awfully sorry for them all — and Terry especially . But as far as I can see there ’s nothing else to do . ”
46302	46309	46310	46310	She	1211	“ I ’ll never do that . ”
46326	46330	46319	46319	her	1211	“ Then what ? ”
46331	46352	46319	46319	her	1211	“ I do n’t know . Not yet . Anyhow , I ’ve got the night to think it over . ”
46353	46367	46368	46368	He	1210	“ All the thinking in the world wo n’t get you any farther . ”
46380	46397	46368	46368	He	1210	“ I ’ve got out of one or two tighter places in my life before now . ”
46398	46406	46407	46407	she	1211	“ I ’ve no doubt you have , ”
46510	46523	46497	46497	he	1210	“ Bad news , Mr. Boyne — oh , I hope not ? ”
46524	46550	46551	46552	Miss Scope	147	“ Well , you did n’t seriously suppose it was going to take Wheater much longer than this to run you down , did you ? ”
46555	46562	46551	46552	Miss Scope	147	“ Are the police after us ? ”
46563	46567	46568	46568	He	1210	“ The police ? ”
46573	46592	46568	46568	He	1210	“ To arrest you for abduction ? If they do , it shall be over my dead body . ”
46608	46628	46629	46629	she	147	“ Whatever Judith did was done with my knowledge and consent — consent ; I do n’t say approval , ”
46636	46654	46629	46629	she	147	“ Of course , of course . But send her down at once , will you please ? ”
46685	46695	46696	46696	He	1210	“ What is it , Martin ? The police ? ”
46705	46735	46696	46696	He	1210	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , child . You ’re as bad as Scopy . You did n’t really believe your father would have you arrested , did you ? ”
46743	46753	46736	46736	She	147	“ What _ is _ he going to do ? ”
46765	46772	46761	46761	she	147	“ You have n’t answered it ? ”
46773	46777	46754	46754	Boyne	145	“ Not yet . ”
46778	46792	46793	46793	Boyne	145	“ Well , we ’ll have to start at once , I suppose . ”
46835	46845	46846	46846	she	147	“ Could n’t we catch a steamer at Trieste ? ”
46868	46874	46846	46846	she	147	“ Trieste ? Why Trieste ? ”
46882	46886	46846	46846	she	147	“ Where to ? ”
46887	46901	46909	46909	she	147	“ Oh , almost anywhere where they ca n’t reach us too quickly . ”
46917	46985	46909	46909	she	147	“ Perhaps , do you know , after all , we ’d better go to America . Do n’t you think so ? There ’s Grandma Mervin — Joyce ’s mother . We might go to her . And meanwhile you can make the Wheaters think we ’re still here , and so they wo n’t be worried , and we shall have time to slip away . ”
47049	47093	47036	47036	he	145	“ Thank you for the part for which I ’m cast . But , my poor child , even if you could get away to America without your parents ’ knowing it , such journeys cost money , and I do n’t suppose — ”
47094	47103	47104	47104	she	147	“ Oh , I ’ve oceans of money , ”
47111	47124	47125	47125	he	145	“ What do you call oceans of money ? Scopy ’s savings ? ”
47133	47138	47129	47129	Judith	127	“ She told you ? ”
47139	47148	47149	47149	Her	147	“ She told me nothing . I guessed . ”
47165	47189	47157	47157	she	147	“ Well , of course I shall pay her back . She ’s sure of that . She knows I ’m a nairess . ”
47190	47208	47129	47129	Judith	127	“ Heroic woman ! But how far do you expect to go on what she ’s contributed ? ”
47216	47236	47129	47129	Judith	127	“ Not very — poor dear Scopy ! But , you see , I ’ve got a lot besides . ”
47237	47243	47244	47244	She	147	“ A lot of money ? ”
47269	47282	47283	47283	she	147	“ Do n’t you call five thousand dollars a lot of money ? ”
47300	47311	47294	47294	she	147	“ You had five thousand dollars — of your own ? ”
47312	47323	47324	47324	Boyne	145	“ No . But I knew where father had them . ”
47338	47343	47324	47324	Boyne	145	“ You knew — ? ”
47344	47382	47294	47294	she	147	“ Do n’t gape at me , Martin . If you like to call it so , I stole the money . He always has a lot about , because it bores him so to write cheques . ”
47383	47394	47294	47294	she	147	“ And you helped yourself — to what you wanted ? ”
47395	47408	47409	47409	She	147	“ It was awfully easy . I knew where the key was . ”
47421	47454	47455	47455	Boyne	145	“ And , anyhow , I knew part of it was intended for our expenses in the Engadine this summer . So it really was n’t exactly like stealing — was it ? ”
47505	47523	47484	47495	the small scarlet figure with rumpled hair and sleep - misted eyes	1218	“ You told your father this , I suppose , in the letter you left for him ? ”
47524	47533	47534	47534	She	147	“ Told him I ’d taken the money ? ”
47537	47556	47534	47534	She	147	“ If I had , there would n’t have been much use in taking it — would there ? ”
47604	47618	47598	47598	he	145	“ Well , I wash my hands of you — all of you . ”
47630	47633	47634	47634	she	127	“ Martin , ”
47641	47649	47634	47634	she	127	“ what are you going to do ? ”
47650	47663	47664	47664	he	145	“ Do ? Nothing . You ’d better answer that telegram yourself , ”
47738	47759	47760	47760	He	145	“ Martin — why do n’t you say you think I ’m a thief , and have done with it ? ”
47766	47791	47760	47760	He	145	“ I think you ’re an unutterable fool . I think the average Andaman islander has a more highly developed moral sense than you . ”
47792	47808	47730	47730	Her	127	“ I do n’t know who they are . But Doll Westway always used to — ”
47809	47814	47760	47760	He	145	“ Used to what ? ”
47815	47842	47843	47843	She	127	“ Go to her mother ’s drawer . There was n’t any other way . They all hate the bother of paying bills — parents do . ”
47853	47863	47843	47843	She	127	“ Miss Scope knows about this , I suppose ? ”
47867	47901	47864	47864	She	127	“ I persuaded her . She hated it awfully — but she saw there was no other way . She ’s saved so little herself — because she has a brother who drinks .... ”
47902	47910	47843	47843	She	127	“ And Terry ? Does Terry know ? ”
47911	47969	47970	47970	He	1220	“ Oh , Martin ! Terry ? How could you think it ? But you do n’t really , do you ? You just said that to frighten me . Oh , Martin ... you ’ll never tell Terry , will you ? I shall die if you do . It does n’t matter about anybody else .... ”
48091	48099	48104	48104	he	1220	“ I ca n’t let her drift , ”
48110	48122	48123	48123	she	1221	“ Martin , tell me what you want me to do , ”
48134	48157	48123	48123	she	1221	“ Sit down at that table and write to your father that you took the money — and why you took it . ”
48166	48172	48173	48173	she	1221	“ If I do n’t , ”
48178	48184	48173	48173	she	1221	“ shall you tell Terry ? ”
48192	48201	48185	48185	He	1220	“ Of course I sha n’t tell Terry ! ”
48202	48210	48211	48211	Boyne	145	“ Very well . Then I will . ”
48230	48236	48237	48237	She	1221	“ That ’s my Judy ! ”
48253	48267	48237	48237	She	1221	“ But if I do , the game ’s up — isn’t it ? ”
48268	48278	48279	48279	Her	1221	“ The game ’s up anyhow , my dear . ”
48283	48295	48296	48296	He	1220	“ You mean you ’re really going to give us away ? ”
48305	48318	48296	48296	He	1220	“ I ’m going to Venice at once to see your father . ”
48319	48327	48363	48363	his	1220	“ To tell him we ’re here ? ”
48328	48332	48333	48333	Her	1221	“ Of course . ”
48382	48401	48402	48402	He	1220	“ Then you give us up altogether ? You do n’t care any longer what becomes of us ? ”
48424	48431	48422	48422	his	1220	“ Judith , look at me . ”
48435	48460	48432	48432	She	1221	“ Ca n’t you understand that I care for only one thing at this moment ? That you should realise what you ’ve done — ”
48461	48466	48467	48467	she	1221	“ About the money ? ”
48470	48478	48467	48467	she	1221	“ Of course . About the money . ”
48479	48490	48432	48432	She	1221	“ You really think that matters more than anything else ? ”
48536	48540	48541	48541	she	1221	“ You see , ”
48550	48697	48541	48541	she	1221	“ if we could only get to Grandma Mervin ’s , I believe she ’d keep us . At any rate , she ’d try to make mother see that we must n’t be separated . I know she would , because in her letters to mother she always calls us ‘ those poor children . ’ She ’s awfully old - fashioned , Grandma Mervin .... And the money , Martin — father wo n’t find out for ever so long that it ’s gone . There was a lot more where I took it from . He always has such heaps with him ; and he never knows how much he ’s spent . Once he had a valet who stole a lot , and he did n’t discover it for months .... And without that money we ca n’t possibly get to America .... ”
48714	48728	48700	48700	himself	145	“ And you ’re gambling on being as lucky as the other thief ? ”
48746	48799	48739	48739	he	145	“ Do n’t you see , child , that this business of the money spoils the whole thing ? You ’ve got to give it back to me ; and I ’ve got to take it to your father . Then I ’ll put up the best fight I can for you . ”
48812	48826	48803	48803	she	1226	“ You will — oh , Martin , darling , you really will ? ”
48846	48853	48854	48854	he	145	“ Now ... now ... now ... ”
48858	48876	48877	48877	she	1226	“ I knew it , Martin ! I knew in my soul you ’d never chuck us , ”
48898	48913	48914	48914	she	1226	“ Martin , I know you ’ll know just what to say to them , ”
48917	48928	48929	48929	he	145	“ Go upstairs , Judith , and get that money , ”
49047	49060	49046	49046	XV	217	“ Damn — damn , damn — oh , _ damn _ ! ”
49162	49165	49166	49166	he	145	“ Damn ! ”
49396	49406	49407	49407	he	145	“ What in hell can I do about it ? ”
49538	49546	49547	49547	he	145	“ Not that I blame the child , ”
49600	49618	49619	49619	Boyne	145	“ That business of the money — you understand , Judith did n’t in the least realise ... ”
49622	49629	49619	49619	Boyne	145	“ Oh , damn the money . ”
49722	49735	49742	49742	him	145	“ I did n’t know the poor little chaps cared so much , ”
49755	49790	49748	49748	Boyne	145	“ They care most awfully for each other — and very much for you and Joyce . What they need beyond everything is a home : a home with you two at its head . ”
49791	49796	49797	49797	Wheater	127	“ Oh , damn , ”
49858	49867	49868	49868	he	145	“ Why ca n’t there not be rows ? ”
49880	49897	49868	49868	he	145	“ There would n’t be , if you and Joyce would only come to an understanding . ”
49905	49912	49868	49868	he	145	“ Joyce — and an understanding ! ”
49913	49990	49991	49991	Boyne	145	“ Well — she ’s awfully fond of the children ; and so are you . And they ’re devoted to both of you , all of them . Why ca n’t you and she agree to bury your differences , and arrange your lives so that you can keep the children together , and give them something that looks like a home , while you both ... well , do whatever you like ... privately .... ”
50017	50029	50030	50030	he	145	“ Joyce does n’t care to do what she likes privately , ”
50036	50052	50030	50030	he	145	“ But the children — I’m sure she does n’t want to part with them . ”
50053	50070	50071	50071	He	145	“ No ; and no more do I. And what ’s more , I wo n’t ! ”
50105	50115	50116	50116	Wheater	127	“ By God , I can dictate my terms , ”
50162	50197	50116	50116	Wheater	127	“ Look here , Cliffe , what ’s the use of threats ? Of course you ’re all - powerful . Between you , Joyce and you can easily destroy these children ’s lives .... ”
50198	50204	50205	50205	Wheater	127	“ Oh , see here ! ”
50208	50236	50205	50205	Wheater	127	“ Destroy their lives . Look at that poor Doll Westway , who was kicked about from pillar to post .... Judith told me her miserable story .... ”
50237	50312	50116	50116	Wheater	127	“ I do n’t see the resemblance . And what ’s more I strongly object to being classed with a down - and - outer like Charlie Westway . Why , man , no law - court in the world would have given a blackguard like that the custody of his children . Whereas mine will always be perfectly safe in my hands , and Joyce knows it ; and so do her lawyers . ”
50313	50371	50372	50372	Boyne	145	“ I daresay ; but the trouble is that the children need Joyce at least as much as they do you . And they need something that neither one of you can give them separately . They need you and Joyce together : that ’s what a home is made of — togetherness ... the mysterious atmosphere .... ”
50389	50394	50395	50395	he	1256	“ Have a drink ? ”
50437	50440	50441	50441	Wheater	127	“ Hi ! ”
50684	50699	50680	50680	Terry	198	“ With all the new ways the doctors have of making parents young again , ”
50732	50755	50714	50714	She	1263	“ It was too clever of Judith to give her father that scare . Now perhaps he ’ll come to his senses . ”
50773	50783	50761	50761	she	1263	“ What do you call coming to his senses ? ”
50784	50802	50803	50803	Her	1263	“ Why , giving all the children to me , of course — to me and Gerald . ”
50847	50881	50840	50840	he	145	“ The trouble is , Joyce , that what they want — what they need — is not you and ... and anybody else ... but just you and Cliffe : their parents . ”
50882	50891	50835	50836	the mother	3034	“ Me and Cliffe ! An edifying spectacle ! ”
50892	50943	50944	50944	She	3034	“ Oh , well , they ’ve discounted all that — at least Judith and Terry have . And they ’re incurably fond of you both . What the younger ones require , of course , is just the even warmth of a home — like any other young animals . ”
50959	50963	50944	50944	She	3034	“ You see , ”
50968	50981	50964	50964	Boyne	145	“ it ’s all these changes of temperature that are killing them . ”
50982	50988	50944	50944	She	3034	“ What changes of temperature ? ”
50989	51034	50964	50964	Boyne	145	“ Well , every time there ’s a new deal — I mean a new step - parent — there ’s necessarily a new atmosphere , is n’t there ? Young things , you know , need sameness — it ’s their vital element . ”
51150	51153	51140	51140	Boyne	145	“ vital element ”
51468	51592	51462	51462	he	411	“ But Cliffe ’s coming too . Oh , you did n’t know ? My dear , he ’s infatuated with Sybil Lullmer . She came here to try and catch Mendip , and failing that she ’s quietly annexed Cliffe instead . Rather funny , is n’t it ? But of course that kind of woman sticks at nothing . With her record , why should she ? And Cliffe has had to make up with Zinnia Wrench because it was the easiest way of being with Sybil .... So you will dine with us , Martin , wo n’t you ? And do tell me — you’re sure Chip ’s perfectly contented ? And you think Cortina will do Terry good ? ”
51708	51721	51722	51722	Joyce	129	“ Do you mean to say you do n’t know Syb Lullmer ? ”
51732	51807	51722	51722	Joyce	129	“ But you must have heard of her as Mrs. Charlie Westway ? She always manages to be in the spot - light . Her daughter Doll committed suicide last year at Deauville . It was all pretty beastly . Syb herself is always chock full of drugs . Does n’t look it , does she ? She might be Judy ’s age ... in this light . What do you think of her ? ”
51808	51815	51816	51817	Mrs. Wheater	120	“ I think she ’s hideous . ”
51820	51850	51816	51817	Mrs. Wheater	120	“ Well , the dress - makers do n’t . They dress her for nothing . Look at her ogling Gerald ! That ’s what makes Cliffe so frantic , ”
51863	51886	51860	51860	she	120	“ A nice step - mother for my children ! Do you wonder I ’m putting up a fight to keep them ? ”
51932	52030	51916	51916	her	222	“ I told Anastase I ’d never speak to him again , or set foot in his place , if ever I caught him selling one of the dresses he ’d designed for me to a respectable woman ; and he said : ‘ Why , I never saw one in my establishment : did you ? ’ And I said to him : ‘ Now you ’ve insulted me , and I ’ll sue you for libel if you do n’t take fifty per cent off my bill . ’ I ’m poor , you see , ”
52075	52086	52087	52088	Mrs. Lullmer	222	“ I got off twenty - five per cent anyhow , ”
52313	52321	52322	52322	he	145	“ Blessed are the pure in heart , ”
52325	52337	52322	52322	he	145	“ for they have so many more things to talk about .... ”

52406	52422	52423	52424	Cliffe Wheater	120	“ I say — why should n’t we go and finish our cigars on board ? ”

52496	52505	52506	52506	Wheater	120	“ To - morrow morning , old man , ”
52515	52526	52509	52509	his	1306	“ we ’ll have it all out about the children .... ”
52531	52534	52509	52509	his	1306	“ morning , ”
52669	52671	52717	52718	Lady Wrench	183	“ Palace ”
52741	52767	52768	52768	She	183	“ Goodness — what you people doing over here , plotting together in a corner ? Look as if you were rehearsing for a film .... ”
52788	52800	52801	52801	Joyce	129	“ I do n’t know what we _ are _ doing , ”
52809	52826	52801	52801	Joyce	129	“ Martin seems to think he ought to tell us how to bring up the children . ”
52878	52888	52889	52889	Wheater	129	“ Something ’s _ got _ to be decided , ”
52893	52901	52889	52889	Wheater	129	“ Oh , well — so long , ”
52906	52965	52903	52904	Lady Wrench	183	“ I ’m off to see Mendip ’s new tent ; the one he ’s just got over from : where is it ? Morocco , I guess he said . But is n’t that a sort of leather ? Somewhere in South Africa , anyhow .... They ’re just rigging it up . It ’s a wonder . ”
52966	52971	52972	52972	Joyce	129	“ A new tent ? ”
52992	53056	53057	53057	Joyce	197	“ Yes ; absolutely different from anything you ’ve ever seen . The very last thing . Sort of black Cubist designs on it . Might give Anastase ideas for a bath - wrap . Hullo , Gerald — that you ? I ’ve been looking for you everywhere ; thought you ’d got drowned . Come along and see Mendip ’s tent . ”
53063	53090	53057	53057	Joyce	197	“ Gerald — Mr. Ormerod ! Please . I want you to stay here . We ’re discussing something about which I may need your advice . ”
53091	53102	53103	53104	her husband	411	“ Oh , look here , Joyce , I say — ”
53117	53137	53138	53138	Wheater	129	“ You do n’t want me to be without advice , I suppose ? You ’ve got Martin ’s . ”
53141	53155	53138	53138	Wheater	129	“ This is n’t going to be a prize fight , is it ? ”
53156	53172	53173	53174	Mrs. Wheater	120	“ I do n’t know . It might . Sit down , please , Gerald . ”
53192	53197	53198	53198	he	179	“ In this heat — ”
53201	53208	53210	53211	Lady Wrench	183	“ Oh , well , s’long , ”
53215	53231	53210	53211	Lady Wrench	183	“ Joyce — Cliffe ! Look here : have you seen Mendip ’s new tent ? ”
53261	53281	53282	53283	Mrs. Wheater	120	“ Do let ’s rush down and take a look at it before cocktails . Come on , Cliffe . ”
53303	53314	53285	53285	her	120	“ See here , Syb ; we ’re talking business . ”
53315	53318	53319	53321	Instantly Mrs. Lullmer	222	“ Business ? ”
53344	53367	53368	53368	she	222	“ Been put on to something good , have you ? I ’m everlastingly broke . For God ’s sake tell me ! ”
53374	53387	53371	53371	Wheater	120	“ No . We ’re only trying to settle about the children . ”
53388	53474	53475	53493	An ethereal sprite , with a pre - Raphaelite bush of fair hair , and a tiny sunburnt body	1322	“ The children ? Do you mean to say you ’re talking about them still ? That reminds me — where ’s my own child ? Pixie , pet ! Ah , there she is . Darling , nip up to my room , will you , and get mummy one of those new lipsticks : no , not _ Baiser Défendu _ , sweet , but _ Nouveau Péché_—you know , the one that fits into the gold bag the Duke gave me yesterday . ”
53514	53539	53540	53541	Mrs. Lullmer	222	“ Pixie ’s such a darling — always does just as I tell her . If only my poor Doll had listened to me ! ”
53572	53580	53581	53581	Boyne	145	“ Well — as I was saying — ”
53637	53666	53667	53667	Wheater	129	“ See here , old Martin — this is no time for business , is it ? I believe Joyce has asked half of these people to lunch , ”
53677	53681	53667	53667	Wheater	129	“ But afterward — ”
53682	53688	53737	53737	She	1084	“ All right . Afterward . ”
53720	53725	53726	53726	Boyne	145	“ Why not here ? ”
53733	53736	53737	53737	She	1084	“ Here ? ”
53761	53765	53766	53766	Boyne	145	“ Why not ? ”
53769	53798	53799	53799	She	1084	“ It ’s cool and quiet , and nobody is likely to bother us . Why should n’t you and Cliffe go into this question with me now ? ”
53804	53835	53799	53799	She	1084	“ Where ’s Cliffe , to begin with ? Oh , out there — under Syb ’s umbrella , of course . _ I ’m _ perfectly willing , naturally — ”
53836	53847	53848	53848	Boyne	145	“ Very well ; I ’ll go and recruit him . ”
53891	53912	53913	53913	Wheater	129	“ I say , Cliffe , Joyce is waiting for you in the Duke ’s tent — for our talk . ”
53926	53936	53937	53937	His	145	“ What talk ? ... Oh , all right . ”
53985	53993	53994	53994	she	222	“ I suppose you do n’t mind — ”
54012	54022	54000	54000	Wheater	129	“ She ’s had so much experience with children . ”
54023	54034	54036	54037	Mrs. Wheater	120	“ All I want is what is best for mine , ”
54050	54069	54070	54070	Wheater	120	“ Martin , you ’ll find Gerald somewhere about . Wo n’t you please tell him to come ? ”
54153	54173	54174	54174	she	183	“ See here , folks , I guess if anybody ’s got a right to be here I have , ”
54181	54196	54174	54174	she	183	“ That is , if you ’re proposing to make plans about my child . ”
54221	54228	54208	54209	Lady Wrench	183	“ Pity Buondelmonte ’s not here , ”
54248	54282	54238	54239	Lady Wrench	183	“ But Wrenny is — I left him this minute at the bar ; and I do n’t see why I should n’t have my own husband ’s advice about my own child . ”
54372	54385	54386	54387	Lord Wrench	185	“ Mendip wants to see how these things are done in America , ”
54415	54425	54411	54411	his	1350	“ Might come in useful — you never know . ”
54426	54446	54447	54448	Joyce Wheater	129	“ I ’m sure _ I _ do n’t know exactly what we ’re supposed to be talking about , ”
54451	54490	54447	54448	Joyce Wheater	129	“ I ’ve said a hundred times that all I care for is what ’s best for the children . Everybody knows I ’ve sacrificed everything for that once before . And what earthly use has it been ? ”
54491	54500	54501	54502	Lady Wrench	183	“ Ah , that ’s what I say , ”
54508	54559	54501	54502	Lady Wrench	183	“ You might cut yourself in pieces for a man , and his dirty lawyers would come and take your child away from you the next day , and haggle over every cent of alimony . But if it comes to money , I ’ll spend as much as anybody — ”
54560	54568	54569	54570	her husband	411	“ Oh , shut up , Zinnia , ”
54580	54602	54603	54603	Boyne	145	“ I do n’t think you ought any of you to look at the matter from a legal stand - point , ”
54606	54649	54603	54603	Boyne	145	“ My friends here are awfully fond of their children , and we all know they want what ’s best for them . The only question is how that best is to be arrived at . It seems to me perfectly simple — ”
54651	54654	54656	54657	the Duke	2416	“ Solomon , ”
54665	54689	54690	54690	Boyne	145	“ No . Exactly the reverse . Division is what I ’m here to fight against — no ; not fight but plead . ”
54696	54713	54690	54690	Boyne	145	“ For God ’s sake , old man , let the lot of them stay together . ”
54714	54737	54738	54738	Wheater	120	“ Why , they _ were _ together ; they would have been , as long as they ’d stayed with me , ”
54754	54789	54745	54745	her	498	“ You do n’t suppose for a minute I ’m going to abandon my children to the kind of future Cliffe Wheater ’s likely to provide for them ? Gerald and I are prepared — ”
54790	54797	54799	54800	Mrs. Lullmer	222	“ So are Cliffe and I , ”
54833	54838	54840	54841	Mrs. Lullmer	222	“ Cliffe and I , ”
54846	54862	54840	54841	Mrs. Lullmer	222	“ Well , and what about me and Wrenny , I ’d like to know ? ”
54868	54881	54863	54864	Lady Wrench	183	“ I guess I can afford the best lawyers in the country — ”
54882	54894	54895	54895	Boyne	145	“ I do n’t see that the law concerns these children , ”
54898	55005	54895	54895	Boyne	145	“ What they need is not to be fought over , but just to be left alone . Judith and Terry understand that perfectly . They know there is probably going to be another change in their parents ’ lives , but they want to remain together , and not be affected by that change . I ’m not here to theorise or criticise — I’m simply here as the children ’s spokesman . They ’re devoted to each other , and they want to stay together . Between you all , ca n’t it be managed somehow — for a time , at any rate ? ”
55006	55066	55067	55068	Mrs. Lullmer	222	“ But my Pixie would be such a perfect little companion for Terry and Blanca . She knows all the very nicest children everywhere . That ’s one of the great advantages of hotel life , is n’t it ? And , after all , Judith may be marrying soon , and then what will become of the others ? ”
55076	55093	55094	55094	Boyne	145	“ Have n’t _ you _ perhaps thought of Judith ’s marrying soon , Mr. Boyne ? ”
55107	55139	55140	55140	She	183	“ I want my Zinnie to have a lovely simple home life , out on our ranch in California . This kicking about in hotels is too horribly demoralising for children . ”
55150	55160	55142	55142	her	183	“ You know something about that , Mrs. Lullmer . ”
55169	55184	55185	55185	she	183	“ Oh , no ; my children were never on a ranch at Hollywood , ”
55188	55193	55195	55196	Lady Wrench	183	“ Hollywood — Hollywood ! ”
55210	55229	55205	55205	her	222	“ Is n’t Hollywood in California ? Stupid of me ! I was never in the West myself . ”
55238	55337	55233	55233	herself	129	“ I ’m sure I do n’t see the use of this . Four of the children are mine and Cliffe ’s . I ’ve always tried to make them all happy . I ’ve treated Zinnie , and Buondelmonte ’s children , exactly like my own ; and this is all the thanks I get for it ! No one could be more competent than Gerald to direct Terry ’s education ; which is something his father never happens to have thought of . But of course everybody here is trying to put me in the wrong .... ”
55345	55434	55338	55339	Mrs. Lullmer	222	“ Oh , no . Do n’t say that , Joyce . All I feel is that perhaps the poor babies have n’t been quite loved enough . You do n’t mind my suggesting it , do you ? If they were mine , I do n’t think I should care so awfully much about making them into high - brows . What I should want would be just to see them all healthy and rosy and happy , and romping about all day like my little Pixie .... ”
55435	55460	55462	55463	Lady Wrench	183	“ With lift - boys and barmen . Yes ; I guess that is about the best preparation for life in the smart set , ”
55470	55512	55466	55467	Mrs. Lullmer	222	“ Yes ; Pixie ’s little friends are all in what I believe you call the ‘ smart set . ’ I confess I think that even more important for a child than learning that Morocco is not in South Africa . ”
55513	55537	55466	55467	Mrs. Lullmer	222	“ Not in South Africa ? Where is it , then , I ’d like to know ? Wrenny , you told me — ”
55538	55541	55543	55544	the Duke	2416	“ Well , ”
55549	55557	55543	55544	the Duke	2416	“ I ’m off for a swim . ”
55685	55706	55679	55680	Mrs. Lullmer	222	“ Mercy , what time is it ? Why , there ’s that diving match off Ella Muncy ’s raft ! ”
55711	55746	55707	55708	Lady Wrench	183	“ I ’ve got fifty pounds on the Grand Duke ; and directly afterward there ’s the mannequin show for the smartest bathing - dresses ; I ’ve given a prize for that myself . ”
55770	55775	55776	55776	she	222	“ Coming , Cliffe ? ”
55780	55796	55776	55776	she	222	“ You ’re one of the judges of the diving match , are n’t you ? ”
55814	55837	55797	55798	Cliffe Wheater	120	“ I did say I ’d be , I believe . Damn it all — I’d no idea it was so late .... ”
55838	55859	55861	55862	Mrs. Lullmer	222	“ It ’s always late in this place . I do n’t see how we any of us stand it , ”
55864	55875	55861	55862	Mrs. Lullmer	222	“ I always say we ’re the real labouring classes . ”
55883	55898	55876	55877	Joyce Wheater	129	“ Very well , then ; I suppose we may consider the matter settled . ”
55899	55911	55912	55912	Wheater	129	“ Settled — settled ? Why , what do you mean ? ”
55919	55945	55912	55912	Wheater	129	“ We came here to decide about the children , I believe . I assume that you agree that I ’m to keep my own . ”
55946	55982	55876	55877	Joyce Wheater	129	“ Keep them ? Keep them ? I agree to no such thing . Martin , here , knows what my conditions are . I ’ve never agreed to any others , and never shall — ”
55983	56041	56042	56045	A bronzed young amphibian	1365	“ Ormerod ! Ormerod ! Where the deuce is Gerald Ormerod ? He ’s next on the diving programme , and Mrs. Muncy ’s just sent word to say that everything ’s being held up — oh , here you are , Gerald ! Come along , for God ’s sake , or I shall catch it .... ”
56079	56099	56100	56101	Joyce Wheater	129	“ Dash it , wake up , old man , or there ’ll be no end of a rumpus . ”
56107	56145	56146	56146	She	129	“ Gerald , Gerald — but of course you must n’t miss your turn ! Cliffe , is the launch there to take us out to the raft ? How can I have forgotten all about it ? ”
56153	56175	56148	56148	herself	129	“ That ’s what always happens — whenever there ’s any question of the children , I forget about everything else .... ”
56186	56379	56176	56176	Wheater	129	“ You see how it is , old man . In this hell of a place there ’s never any time for anything . See here — come along with us to this diving match , wo n’t you ? The sea ’s so calm I ’ve had the launch lying to out there ever since lunch ; we ’ll be out at the raft in no time .... No ? You wo n’t ? Well — sorry ... it ’s a pretty sight . To - morrow then .... Oh , you ’re really off to - morrow morning , are you ? Ca n’t see why you do n’t stay on a day or two , now you ’re here . Of course the children are all right where they are for the present — we all know that . And if you stayed on for a day or two we could go into the whole thing quietly .... No ? Well , then — why , yes , tonight , of course . Tell you what , old man : you and Joyce and I will go out to the “
56382	56399	56456	56456	she	163	” after dinner , and talk the whole thing out by ourselves . That suit you ? ”
56435	56442	56428	56428	He	145	“ All right , do n’t worry ”
56631	56639	56640	56640	His	145	“ _ Willkommen , suesser Daemmerschein ! _ ”
56710	56720	56721	56721	he	145	“ I ’d forgotten that anything had any meaning , ”
56740	56749	56750	56750	She	163	“ Martin — but how tired you look ! ”
56778	56789	56768	56768	She	163	“ I did n’t even know you ’d got back . ”
56801	56824	56825	56825	he	145	“ I did n’t know till the last minute when I could get away — I just jumped into the first train , ”
56876	56879	56880	56880	he	145	“ Dear ! ”
56889	56894	56880	56880	he	145	“ You ’ve failed ? ”
56919	56922	56923	56923	he	145	“ No , ”
56926	56931	56923	56923	he	145	“ I ’ve succeeded ! ”
56932	56934	56935	56935	He	145	“ Oh—. ”
57010	57021	57002	57002	She	163	“ You do n’t look like somebody who has succeeded . ”
57022	57050	56992	56992	she	163	“ I daresay not . I feel rather like one of the fellows they let down into a disused well , and haul up half - asphyxiated .... ”
57051	57057	56992	56992	she	163	“ It was — asphyxiating ? ”
57058	57081	57084	57084	her	163	“ Some of it ; most of it . But I ’m coming to . And I ’ve got what I wanted . ”
57093	57107	57082	57082	He	145	“ How wonderful ! You mean to say you ’ve reconciled the Wheaters ? ”
57108	57130	56992	56992	she	163	“ I ’ve reconciled them to the idea of not separating the children — for the present , at any rate . ”
57131	57138	57082	57082	He	145	“ Oh , Martin — splendid ! ”
57156	57176	57148	57148	Her	163	“ It will do Terry more good than all the Alps and Dolomites piled on top of one another . ”
57177	57186	57187	57187	He	145	“ Yes ; and Judith too , incidentally . ”
57199	57219	57220	57221	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Of course ; but Judith ’s a young lady who is eminently capable of fighting her own battles , ”
57225	57240	57220	57221	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ She ought to be — she ’s had to fight everybody else ’s . ”
57383	57391	57392	57392	she	162	“ Do tell me just what happened , ”
57395	57429	57392	57392	she	162	“ Well — at the very last minute they decided to make me , informally , into the children ’s guardian : a sort of trial - guardian , you might call it . ”
57430	57436	57437	57437	Her	162	“ A trial - guardian ? ”
57457	57469	57437	57437	Her	162	“ What a jolly thing to be a trial - guardian ! ”
57470	57479	57480	57480	Boyne	145	“ Well , I ’m not so sure . ”
57485	57495	57480	57480	Boyne	145	“ It ’s not a joke , you know . ”
57496	57508	57437	57437	Her	162	“ I sha n’t know what it is till you explain . ”
57547	57553	57540	57540	He	145	“ It ’s all right , ”
57593	57599	57600	57600	Boyne	145	“ Oh , by Jove ! ”
57616	57627	57628	57628	He	145	“ Here ’s something I got for you in Venice . ”
57683	57693	57703	57703	he	145	“ Oh , the lovely thing ! For me ? ”
57694	57702	57703	57703	he	145	“ Oh , no ; not that , ”
57736	57741	57721	57721	his	145	“ But , Martin — ”
57742	57744	57745	57745	He	145	“ Here—. ”
57772	57778	57779	57779	He	145	“ This is for you . ”
57801	57808	57809	57809	her	162	“ It ’s much too beautiful , ”
57821	57844	57814	57814	her	162	“ Only , you ’ve put it on the wrong hand — at least , if it ’s meant for our engagement . ”
57845	57856	57857	57857	he	145	“ Looks as if it were , does n’t it ? ”
57867	57904	57863	57863	he	145	“ Yes , that ’s just the trouble — it looks like the engagement ring any other fellow would have given to any other woman . Nothing in the world to do with her and me . ”
57909	57920	57906	57906	he	145	“ I had n’t time to find what I wanted — ”
57935	57945	57946	57946	he	145	“ I wanted something so awfully different for you , ”
57950	57963	57964	57964	she	162	“ Well , your wanting that makes it different — to me , ”
57973	57980	57964	57964	she	162	“ Besides , it ’s lovely . ”
57998	58003	58004	58004	he	145	“ It ’s rotten , ”
58185	58196	58170	58170	She	162	“ And now — do tell me just what happened . ”
58197	58210	58211	58211	He	145	“ Well — first , of course , a lot of talk . ”
58470	58476	58477	58477	Boyne	145	“ But in that crowd , ”
58480	58600	58601	58601	Boyne	145	“ no man is another man ’s enemy for more than a few minutes , and no woman is any other woman ’s rival . Either they forget they ’ve quarrelled , or some social necessity — usually a party that none of them can bear to miss — forces them together , and makes it easier to bury their differences . But generally it ’s a simple case of forgetting . Their memories are as short as a savage ’s , and the feuds that savages remember have dropped out . They recall only the other primitive needs — food , finery , dancing . I suppose we _ are _ relapsing into a kind of bloodless savagery , ”
58736	58744	58733	58733	his	145	“ And your point is , exactly — ”
58794	58867	58792	58792	Terry	198	“ They ’ve agreed to leave the children together , and to leave them here , for the next three or four months . The longest to bring round was Lady Wrench . Her husband has taken a fancy to Zinnie , and he ’s so mortally bored by life in general that his wife clutches at anything that may amuse him . Luckily , according to the terms of the divorce — ”
58868	58872	58873	58874	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Which divorce ? ”
58890	58976	58873	58874	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Wheater _ versus _ Zinnia Lacrosse . It was Wheater who got the divorce from the present Lady Wrench . Legally he has the final say about Zinnie , so the mother had to give in , though she has a right to see the child at stated intervals . But of course my battle royal was over Chipstone ; if the Wheaters had insisted on keeping Chipstone till their own affairs were settled in court the whole combination would have been broken up . ”
58977	58987	58988	58988	Boyne	145	“ And how did you contrive to rescue Chipstone ? ”
59022	59044	59045	59045	He	145	“ By promising to stay here and keep an eye on the children myself . That ’s my trial - guardianship . ”
59057	59060	59045	59045	He	145	“ Martin ! ”
59068	59072	59073	59073	She	163	“ Well — ? ”
59082	59106	59073	59073	She	163	“ But these children — you’d never even heard of them till you met them on board your steamer a few weeks ago .... ”
59107	59114	59073	59073	She	163	“ No ; that ’s true . ”
59115	59125	59073	59073	She	163	“ You ’ve taken over a pretty big responsibility . ”
59126	59131	59073	59073	She	163	“ I like responsibilities . ”
59143	59190	59132	59133	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ It ’s very generous of you to assume this one in such a hurry . Usually one does n’t have to go out of one ’s way to find rather more of them than one can manage . But in this case , I wonder — ”
59191	59195	59073	59073	She	163	“ You wonder ? ”
59196	59235	59073	59073	She	163	“ Well , I had understood from Terry — and also from your friend Judith — that what all the children really want is to go to America : to Mrs. Wheater ’s mother , is n’t it ? ”
59236	59368	59132	59133	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Yes ; that ’s it ; and I hope they ’ll pull it off by - and - by . But at present the Wheaters wo n’t hear of it . I never for a moment supposed they ’d consent to putting the ocean between themselves and Chip . My only chance was to persuade them that , now Terry ’s in the mountains , they ’d better leave him here , and the others with him , till the hot weather ’s over . With those people it ’s always a question of the least resistance — of temporizing and postponing . My plan saved everybody a certain amount of mental effort ; so they all ended by agreeing to it . But of course it ’s merely provisional . ”
59369	59372	59373	59374	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Happily , ”
59391	59410	59373	59374	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ For you must see , dear , that you ’re taking a considerable risk for the future — ”
59411	59415	59132	59133	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ What future ? ”
59416	59450	59451	59451	Boyne	145	“ Why — suppose anything goes wrong during these next few months ? You ’ll be answerable for whatever may happen . With seven children — and one of them already grown up ! ”
59461	59483	59458	59458	his	145	“ If you mean Judith , in some ways she ’s as much of a child as the youngest of them . ”
59492	59525	59484	59485	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ So a man would think , I suppose . But you forget that I ’ve had four days alone with her .... She ’s a young lady with very definite views . ”
59526	59532	59132	59133	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ I should hope so ! ”
59533	59553	59451	59451	Boyne	145	“ I agree with you that it makes her more interesting — but conceivably it might lead to complications . ”
59554	59560	59484	59485	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ What sort of complications ? ”
59561	59609	59132	59133	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ You ought to know better than I do — since you tell me you ’ve been frequenting the late Mrs. Westway at the Lido . Judith does n’t pretend to hide the fact that she lived for a summer in the bosom of that edifying family .... ”
59610	59628	59451	59451	Boyne	145	“ She does n’t know it ’s anything to hide . That ’s what ’s so touching — ”
59629	59661	59662	59662	She	1402	“ And so terrifying . But I wo n’t sit here preaching prudence ; you ’d only hate me for it . And all this time those poor infants are waiting . ”
59721	59760	59761	59761	He	1403	“ Do go down and see them at once , dear . It ’s getting late . I ’ll walk with you to the foot of the hill ; then I must come back and write some letters .... ”
59775	59789	59790	59790	she	1402	“ Yes ; really important letters — one of them to Aunt Julia , ”
59794	59809	59811	59811	she	1402	“ And besides , the children will want to have you all to themselves . ”
59814	59870	59811	59811	she	1402	“ I must say they all behaved beautifully while you were away . They seemed to feel that they must do you credit . And as for Terry — I wish he were mine ! When the break up comes , as of course it will , why should n’t you and I adopt him ? ”
59912	59929	59930	59930	she	1402	“ You ’ll come back and dine ? I ’ve got some news for you too , ”
60160	60170	60171	60172	Miss Scope	147	“ Luckily we ’re the only boarders just now , ”
60268	60286	60287	60287	Zinnie	133	“ And now let ’s kiss him all over again — and it ’s my turn first ! ”
60311	60324	60335	60341	persons of their own age and experience	1419	“ We suppose you ’ve brought some presents for us , Martin . ”
60544	60560	60539	60539	Boyne	145	“ Come and take a turn , and I ’ll tell you all about it . ”
60617	60638	60639	60639	he	145	“ What a pity it ’s getting dark — I believe I could climb to one of those ruby peaks ! ”
60656	60671	60652	60652	she	127	“ Let ’s run back and get Bun ’s lamp ; then we could . ”
60686	60719	60672	60672	Boyne	145	“ Oh , Bun would n’t part with that lamp — not yet . Besides , we ’re very well as we are ; and there ’ll be lots of other opportunities . ”
60720	60736	60737	60737	Her	127	“ There will ? Oh , Martin — they’re really going to let us stay ? ”
60748	60766	60737	60737	Her	127	“ Well , for a time . I made them see it was Terry ’s best chance . ”
60767	60787	60672	60672	Boyne	145	“ Of course it is ! And , Martin — they’ll leave us all together ? Chip and all ? ”
60788	60802	60803	60803	They	1431	“ Every man of you — for the summer , at any rate . ”
60827	60835	60814	60814	he	145	“ There ’s one condition , though — ”
60844	60866	60841	60841	he	145	“ You ’re all to be accountable to me . I ’ve promised your people to keep an eye on you . ”
60867	60879	60880	60880	Her	127	“ You mean you ’re going to stay here with us ? ”
60899	60911	60894	60894	he	145	“ It ’s too much for a child ’s face to express—. ”
60916	60937	60913	60913	he	145	“ Let ’s sit down and watch the sunset . This tree - trunk is a pretty good proscenium box . ”
61056	61069	61049	61049	he	145	“ I suppose father ’s made some arrangement about paying our bills ? ”
61070	61092	61093	61093	She	127	“ Your father ’s opened an account for me : Miss Scope and I are to be your ministers of finance . ”
61124	61137	61121	61121	she	127	“ Was father awfully angry ... you know ... about that money ? ”
61196	61217	61218	61218	She	127	“ Of course your father was angry — thoroughly angry — about the whole thing . Anybody would have been . ”
61225	61235	61220	61220	her	127	“ But I mean about my taking his money ? ”
61236	61250	61220	61220	her	127	“ Well , he ’s forgiven you for that , at any rate . ”
61251	61259	61260	61260	Her	127	“ Has he — really and truly ? ”
61266	61274	61260	61260	Her	127	“ Terry was sure he never would . ”
61283	61293	61294	61294	She	127	“ Terry — then you told him after all ? ”
61302	61307	61294	61294	She	127	“ I had to . ”
61308	61315	61316	61316	He	145	“ Well , I understand that . ”
61324	61331	61316	61316	He	145	“ I ’m glad you did . ”
61332	61387	61294	61294	She	127	“ He was frightfully upset , you know . And furious with me . I was afraid I ’d made him more ill . He would n’t believe me at first . He said if I had no more moral sense than that , the first thing I knew I ’d land in prison . ”
61388	61390	61391	61391	Boyne	145	“ Oh—. ”
61399	61410	61411	61411	Judith	127	“ That did n’t worry me very much , though , ”
61419	61455	61411	61411	Judith	127	“ because I ’ve seen a good deal more of life than Terry , and I ’ve known other girls who ’ve done what I did , and none of them ever went to prison . ”
61493	61506	61490	61490	he	145	“ The worst of it was hurting Terry , was n’t it ? ”
61511	61514	61508	61508	she	127	“ Yes . ”
61578	61596	61565	61565	She	127	“ There might have been a chance if Syb Lullmer had n’t been mixed up in it . ”
61597	61612	61613	61613	Boyne	145	“ I do wish you would n’t call that woman by her Christian name , ”
61625	61635	61616	61616	Judith	127	“ She would n’t mind . Everybody else does . ”
61652	61667	61640	61640	he	145	“ That ’s not what I meant . But she ’s such a beast . ”
61668	61672	61673	61673	Judith	127	“ Oh , well—. ”
61695	61707	61673	61673	Judith	127	“ I rather hope she wo n’t marry father , though . ”
61708	61745	61746	61746	Her	127	“ I hope to God she wo n’t . What I ’m gambling on is that he and your mother will get so homesick for you children that they ’ll patch things up on your account . ”
61753	61766	61746	61746	Her	127	“ They do n’t often , you know ; parents do n’t . ”
61767	61787	61673	61673	Judith	127	“ Well , anyhow , you ’ve got a reprieve , and you must make the most of it . ”
61788	61805	61673	61673	Judith	127	“ I wish you ’d say ‘ we , ’ not ‘ you , ’ Martin . ”
61806	61830	61831	61831	They	1437	“ Why of course it ’s ‘ we , ’ my dear — that is , as long as you all behave yourselves . ”
61939	61945	61946	61946	she	127	“ It ’s lovely here , ”
62014	62046	62005	62005	Judith	127	“ Oh , Martin , how beautifully you do describe things ! The words you find are not like anybody else ’s . Terry says you ought to be a writer . ”
62047	62063	62005	62005	Judith	127	“ Well , in this case , unluckily , somebody found the words before me . ”
62064	62066	62067	62067	Her	127	“ Oh—. ”
62074	62078	62071	62071	She	127	“ Mrs. Sellars ? ”
62088	62112	62079	62079	He	145	“ In a way , yes — but , as a matter of fact , Robert Browning got ahead of both of us . ”
62122	62138	62079	62079	He	145	“ Then she just cribbed it from him ? Is he another friend of hers ? ”
62139	62181	62079	62079	He	145	“ Yes ; and will be of yours some day , I hope . He died long before you were born ; but you ’ll find some of the best of him in one of the books I brought to Terry . ”
62182	62194	62195	62195	she	127	“ Oh , he ’s just an author , you mean , ”
62251	62264	62265	62265	she	127	“ I ’d rather hear you talk than anybody who ’s dead , ”
62268	62286	62287	62287	he	1443	“ All right ; I ’ll make it a rule to give you only my own vintage , ”
62334	62345	62346	62346	he	145	“ Come along , child . Time to go down , ”
62349	62362	62346	62346	he	145	“ Oh , not down yet — up , up , up ! ”
62395	62439	62440	62440	she	127	“ I want to climb and climb — don’t you ? I want to stay up all night , as if we were coming home at sunrise from a ball . It ’s like a great ballroom over there , is n’t it , ”
62448	62459	62440	62440	she	127	“ with the lights pouring out of a million windows ? ”
62732	62742	62743	62743	he	145	“ Oh , by Jove — you must come ! ”
62933	62936	62937	62937	She	127	“ Judith ! ”
62944	62957	62958	62958	She	127	“ Did you really think I had n’t brought you any present ? ”
62965	62979	62958	62958	She	127	“ N — no ; I really thought perhaps you had ; only — ”
62980	62984	63041	63041	he	145	“ Only what ? ”
62985	63018	63036	63036	He	145	“ I thought you ’d forgotten some one else ’s , and had imagined I should n’t much mind your taking mine , because I ’m so much older than the others .... ”
63019	63035	63036	63036	He	145	“ Well , of course I should have imagined that ; but here it is . ”
63065	63070	63054	63054	Judith	127	“ Oh , Martin — ”
63071	63089	63090	63090	She	127	“ There ; own up that you ’d have been fearfully sold if I ’d forgotten you . ”
63094	63107	63090	63090	She	127	“ If you ’d forgotten me I should have died of it . ”
63108	63121	63122	63122	he	145	“ Well — run off with you ; we ’re hours late , ”
63126	63137	63122	63122	he	145	“ May n’t I look at it before you go ? ”
63138	63160	63122	63122	he	145	“ You baby , how could you see in the dark ? Besides , I tell you there ’s no time . ”
63161	63173	63122	63122	he	145	“ Not even time to kiss you for it , Martin ? ”
63174	63177	63178	63178	he	145	“ No , ”
63436	63451	63452	63455	the coward in him	1478	“ If only she does n’t parade it up at the _ châlet _ ! ”
63478	63494	63495	63495	he	145	“ Oh , well , damn — after all , I chose it for her , ”
63549	63576	63577	63577	he	145	“ I ’m afraid it ’s awfully late — I had n’t time to go to the hotel and brush up ; you do n’t mind ? ”
63618	63630	63602	63602	his	145	“ You do n’t mean to say it ’s after nine ? ”
63631	63662	63663	63663	He	145	“ What does it matter ? As a matter of fact , it ’s after half - past . I was only afraid something had gone wrong about the children . ”
63672	63706	63663	63663	He	145	“ Bless you , no ! Everything ’s as right as right . But I had to get the Lido out of my lungs ; and a long tramp was the only way . ”
63721	63756	63757	63757	She	163	“ And what do you think my news is ? You know I said I had something to tell you . Mr. Dobree is coming here to see me — he arrives next week . ”
63773	63780	63781	63781	Boyne	145	“ Oh , damn Mr. Dobree ! ”
63817	63827	63828	63828	Boyne	145	“ Well , this is good enough for me , ”
63951	63968	63931	63931	Blanca	128	“ A new ring ! What a beauty ! I never saw you wear it before . ”
63983	64005	63979	63979	her	163	“ What sharp eyes ! But everybody seems to have had a present from Venice — so why should n’t I ? ”
64023	64035	64012	64012	her	128	“ Is n’t mine sweet ? Nobody finds presents like Martin . ”
64036	64049	64050	64051	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ So I thought when he showed me Judith ’s last night . ”
64084	64133	64064	64064	She	163	“ Such a wonder , that pendant — I never saw one like it . Decidedly , not Venetian ; seventeenth century Spanish , perhaps ? It ’s a puzzle . You ’re lucky , my dear , to have a _ connaisseur _ to choose your presents . ”
64304	64308	64314	64314	he	145	“ The Grammarian ’s Funeral”—“You
64358	64359	64327	64327	she	127	” “
64383	64397	64327	64327	she	127	” Judith glowed , taking up the tale , while Blanca ingenuously added : “
64445	64446	64437	64437	you	145	” “
64462	64483	64437	64437	you	145	” Mrs. Sellars intervened , letting her eyes rest attentively on Boyne ’s before she turned them again to Terry . “
64511	64668	64506	64506	I	0	” It all went off perfectly — and Boyne , when he started the children homeward after lunch , was wondering whether tact were as soothing as a summer breeze , or as terrible as an army with banners . He was to drop the young Wheaters at their _ pension _ , and afterward meet Mrs. Sellars at the post - office for a climb in the direction of Misurina . At the corner of the highroad descending to Cortina he signalled the hotel omnibus , packed in the twins , and walked on with Judith . At the moment he would rather have escaped from the whole party ; but Judith had declared her intention of walking , and he could not do otherwise than go with her . They waited under the trees for the omnibus to sweep on with its load of dust and passengers , and almost at once Judith said : “
64684	64777	64680	64680	you	1500	” The suddenness of the question struck him like a blow , and he realised for the first time that he had never spoken to Rose Sellars about making their engagement known . He had never even asked her if she had broken the news to her formidable aunt , or to the galaxy of minor relatives with whom she maintained her incessant exchange of letters . Her insistence that their marriage should be put off for nearly half a year seemed to make the whole question too remote for immediate decisions . “
64792	64820	64785	64785	her	163	” he thought , reflecting remorsefully that his long exile had made him too careless of the social observances . He turned an irritated eye on Judith . “
64833	64834	64837	64837	your	163	” “
64858	64866	64846	64846	her	163	” Judith replied with a smiling promptness . “
64877	64893	64846	64846	her	163	” Boyne said , temporising ; and then , with an abrupt clutch at simplification ; “
64916	65000	64908	64908	she	163	” He turned his gaze away to the long white road glinting through the trees under which he and Judith were withdrawn . Things happened so suddenly and overwhelmingly in Judith ’s face that he did not feel equal to what might be going on there till he had steadied his gaze by a protracted study of the landscape . When he looked at her again he received the shock of smiling lips and eyes , and two arms thrown filially about him . “
65023	65048	65016	65016	you	0	” Her hug was almost as suffocating as Zinnie ’s , and given — he divined it instantly — with the same wholehearted candour . “
65122	65123	65120	65120	you	0	” “
65130	65141	65120	65120	you	0	” Boyne laughed , but with a touch of vexation . “
65196	65205	65170	65170	you	0	” Judith received this with a puzzled frown . “
65250	65287	65235	65235	I	0	” Boyne shrugged impatiently . Things that seemed funny , and utterly guileless , when she said them to others , shocked him when she commented on his private concerns in the vocabulary of her tribe . “
65323	65343	65344	65344	I	0	” He broke off , feeling that such asseverations led nowhere in particular , and continued at a tangent : “
65373	65379	65403	65403	her	163	” Judith ’s face fell . “
65392	65393	65394	65394	I	0	” “
65409	65439	65403	65403	her	163	” This , again , seemed to land him in a sort of rhetorical blind alley , and he stepped down from it into the dust of the highroad . “
65457	65544	65545	65548	The youngest of them	3522	” He was aware that a settled anger was possessing him , he hardly knew why . Hardly — yet just under the surface of his mind there stirred the uneasy sense that he was perhaps disappointed by Judith ’s prompt congratulations . Half an hour earlier , he would have said that her approval would add the final touch to his happiness ; that there was nothing he wanted more than to have her show herself in fact the child he was perpetually calling her . “
65549	65582	65545	65548	The youngest of them	3522	all”—that was how he had described her to Mrs. Sellars . Was it possible he had not meant what he said ? He was roused by Judith ’s squeeze on his arm . “
65606	65607	65612	65612	Judy	127	” “
65642	65702	65634	65634	mine	0	” After all , he tried to tell himself , Judith ’s knowing of his engagement was already a relief . It would do away with no end of hedging and prevaricating . And he was sure he could trust to Judith ’s discretion ; sure of it without her added pressure on his arm , and the solemn : “
65708	65751	65634	65634	mine	0	” which had become the tribal oath of the little Wheaters . Boyne had sometimes winced at Judith ’s precocious discretion , as another proof of what she had been exposed to ; now he hailed in it a guaranty of peace . “
65776	65813	65819	65820	the children	505	” he repeated to himself , insistently . That very evening , while he and Mrs. Sellars were talking over the likelihood of picking up some kind of a tutor for Terry , she asked irrelevantly : “
65826	65843	65819	65820	the children	505	” Contradictory answers rose to Boyne ’s lips , and he gulped them down to mumble : “
65855	65856	65848	65848	I	0	” “
65863	65864	65860	65860	anybody	2661	” “
65883	65888	65878	65878	I	0	” Mrs. Sellars smiled . “
65917	65918	65878	65878	I	0	” “
65922	65926	65878	65878	I	0	” She pondered . “
65956	65966	65954	65954	her	203	” Boyne , relieved , expressed his complete agreement . “
65969	65973	65974	65974	I	0	” she continued , “
65994	65995	65991	65992	Mr. Dobree	200	” “
66003	66237	66000	66001	Mr. Dobree	200	” Boyne replied emphatically . Two days later Mr. Dobree arrived ; and Boyne learned that an event which seems negligible before it happens may fill the picture when it becomes a fact . The prospect of Mr. Dobree ’s arrival had now become the fact of Mr. Dobree ’s presence ; and Mr. Dobree , though still spare and nimble for a man approaching sixty ( he was ready , and glad , to tell you to what exercises he owed it ) , took up a surprising amount of room . He was like somebody who travels with a lot of unwieldy luggage — his luggage being , as it were , the very absence of it , being his tact , his self - effacingness , his general neatness and compactness . Wherever you turned , you were in the aura of Mr. Dobree ’s retractility , his earnest and insistent dodging out of your way , which seemed to leave behind it a presence more oppressive than any mere physical bulk — so that a dull fat man rooted in your best armchair might have been less in the way than the slim and disappearing Mr. Dobree . Mr. Dobree ’s tact seemed to Boyne like a parody of Mrs. Sellars ’s ; like one of those monstrous blooms into which hybridizers transform a delicate flower . It was a “
66239	66320	66000	66001	Mr. Dobree	200	” tact , a huge , unique , disbudded tact grown under glass , and destined to be labelled , exhibited , given a prize and a name , and a page to itself in the florists ’ catalogues . Such at least was Boyne ’s distorted vision of the new guest at the _ châlet _ . Mr. Dobree ( as became a man with such impedimenta ) was lodged , not at Boyne ’s inn , but at the “
66322	66858	66860	66861	Mrs. Sellars	163	” where Boyne and Mrs. Sellars had once dined . From there a brisk five minutes carried him to the _ châlet _ ; except when his urgent hospitality drew Mrs. Sellars and Boyne to the big hotel . The prompt returning of invitations was a fundamental part of Mr. Dobree ’s code . He seemed to think that hospitality was something a gentleman might borrow , like money , but never , in any circumstances , receive as a gift ; and this obliged Mrs. Sellars to accept his repeated invitations , before , in the battle of their tacts , hers came off victorious , and she made him see that it may be more blessed to receive than to be invited out . The sapphire had vanished from her finger before Mr. Dobree ’s arrival ; and this precaution , for which Boyne blessed her , made him , for Mr. Dobree , simply an old friend , a guest of the Sellars ’s in New York days , whom one could be suitably pleased to meet again . Boyne was less pleased to meet Mr. Dobree . His coming was natural enough ; and so was Mrs. Sellars ’s pleasure at seeing him , since he brought not only the latest news of Aunt Julia but papers which settled satisfactorily the matter of Mr. Sellars ’s will . Boyne had resented what promised to be a tiresome interruption of pleasant habits ; but before long he discovered that Mr. Dobree ’s presence left him free to spend much more time with his young friends of the _ Pension Rosenglüh _ . This made him aware that during the last weeks he had forfeited a certain amount of his liberty , and he found himself perilously pleased to recover it . He assured Mrs. Sellars that it would look very odd to Mr. Dobree , who had come to discuss family matters with his client , if a third person were present at these discussions ; and armed with this argument he proceeded to dispose of his time as he pleased . His liberation gave a new savour to the hours spent with the little Wheaters ; and as for Mr. Dobree ( with whom the children had had only one brief and awe - inspiring encounter ) , he came in very handily as the theme of the games they were always calling on Boyne to invent . To ascertain Mr. Dobree ’s Christian name ( Boyne told them ) had long been his secret ambition ; but hitherto he had not even been able to learn its first letter . A chance glimpse of Mr. Dobree ’s glossy suit - cases showed his initials to be A.D. , and the letter A was one calculated , as Boyne said , to give them a good gallop . Indeed , he found the puzzle so absorbing that one day , when Judith remarked on his unusual absent - mindedness , he had to own that he had not been listening to what she said because all his faculties were still absorbed in the task of guessing Mr. Dobree ’s Christian name . “
66872	66873	66870	66870	her	163	” “
66886	66887	66878	66878	you	1525	” “
66903	66904	66889	66889	she	163	” “
66948	66949	66930	66930	anybody	2661	” “
66957	66974	66976	66976	her	163	” suggested Judith , from whose make - up a taste for abstract speculation was absent . “
66995	66996	66984	66984	she	163	” “
67002	67011	66984	66984	she	163	” cried Terry , plunging into the sport . “
67034	67035	67030	67030	she	163	” “
67073	67074	67071	67071	Terry	198	” “
67097	67101	67090	67090	him	1532	” exulted Terry . “
67123	67134	67121	67121	Aage	242	” This was dismissed with a general shout of incredulity . “
67166	67167	67175	67175	Abel	240	” “
67177	67182	67175	67175	Abel	240	” the assistance chorused . “
67191	67213	67215	67215	her	1533	” Judith grumbled , stretching out at full length on the sunburnt grass - bank on which the party were encamped . “
67224	67228	67232	67232	Adam	243	” Boyne jeered . “
67234	67235	67232	67232	Adam	243	” “
67252	67260	67261	67263	A national hero	1534	” Judith opened her eyes to ask . “
67268	67294	67261	67263	A national hero	1534	” said Blanca , with a diligent frown . Miss Scope , perched higher up the bank , cut through these conjectures with a groan . “
67312	67313	67310	67310	Adam	243	” “
67342	67350	67335	67335	anybody	2661	” Blanca shrugged ; while Zinnie interposed : “
67369	67386	67335	67335	anybody	2661	” Beechy , her face wrinkling up in sympathy at such a privation , wailed out : “
67394	67405	67391	67392	Mr. Dobree	200	” ; and Boyne , recognizing the difficulty , pursued : “
67424	67456	67420	67420	I	0	” This drew him into a discussion with Terry regarding the relative seniority of the Biblical and Virgilian heroes , in the intervals of which Miss Scope continued to demand despairingly : “
67478	67500	67501	67501	I	0	” Judith lifted her head again from its grassy pillow . With half - closed eyes she murmured to the sky : “
67538	67539	67533	67536	a very rich man	1546	” “
67559	67564	67545	67545	you	0	” Zinnie promptly inferred . “
67574	67582	67583	67583	Annibal	245	” Judith retorted , closing her eyes . “
67604	67656	67598	67599	a Prince	3206	” shouted Bun , leaping back into the game . XX Mrs. Sellars ’s social discipline was too perfect to permit her , even in emergencies , to neglect one obligation for another ; and after Mr. Dobree had been for a week at Cortina she said one day to Boyne : “
67674	67754	67672	67672	them	788	” He assured her that they were all right , but had probably been too shy to present themselves at the _ châlet _ since Mr. Dobree ’s arrival ; to which Mrs. Sellars replied , with the faintest hint of tartness , that she had never had occasion to suspect the little Wheaters of being shy , and that , furthermore , Mr. Dobree did not happen to be staying at the _ châlet _ . Boyne smiled . “
67781	67799	67800	67800	I	0	” He saw that she scented irony in this , and was not wholly pleased with it . “
67875	67942	67867	67868	Mr. Dobree	200	” Boyne felt that , for all the parties concerned , the undertaking might prove formidable . He pointed out that , if Zinnie and the two Buondelmonte children were included in an all - day expedition , Miss Scope ’s presence would be necessary , since otherwise all Judith ’s energies would be absorbed in keeping the party in order ; and Mrs. Sellars acquiesced : “
67953	67981	67867	67868	Mr. Dobree	200	” Boyne was secretly beginning to be of the same mind ; but Mrs. Sellars could no longer criticise his young friends without rousing his instinctive opposition . “
68002	68012	67999	67999	you	0	” he said impatiently ; and his betrothed rejoined : “
68048	68066	68037	68037	he	200	” Boyne gave her a quick look , in which he was conscious that his resentment flamed . “
68094	68095	68099	68099	his	200	” “
68167	68202	68155	68155	Judith	127	” Boyne had removed his eyes from Mrs. Sellars ’s face , and was staring out at the familiar outline of the great crimson mountains beyond the balcony . A phrase of Stevenson ’s about “
68208	68211	68155	68155	Judith	127	” ( from “
68217	68276	68155	68155	Judith	127	” he thought ? ) strayed through his mind as he gazed . It was hateful to him to think that he might hereafter come to associate those archangelic summits with Mrs. Lullmer ’s smooth impervious face , and Mr. Dobree ’s knowledge of the inner history of the Westway divorce . He turned back to Mrs. Sellars . “
68287	68304	68279	68279	you	1562	” he asked abruptly . She gave back his irritated stare with one of genuine surprise . “
68314	68315	68309	68309	You	1562	” “
68321	68341	68342	68342	I	0	” His sweeping gesture gathered up in one contemptuous handful the vast panorama of mountain , vale and forest . “
68376	68392	68393	68393	I	0	” Mrs. Sellars was silent for a moment ; then her hand fell on his . “
68418	68429	68460	68461	Mr. Dobree	200	” Boyne jumped up , drawing abruptly away from her . “
68435	68455	68456	68456	Gammon	248	” He walked across the room , turned back , and awkwardly laid an answering caress on her hair . “
68472	68474	68460	68461	Mr. Dobree	200	” ( “
68477	68484	68460	68461	Mr. Dobree	200	” he cursed himself inwardly . ) “
68508	68520	68522	68522	my	0	” He saw the light of reassurance in her averted cheek . “
68545	68556	68543	68543	I	0	” He laughed , and her faint laugh echoed his . “
68566	68575	68557	68558	Mr. Dobree	200	” she volunteered . Boyne pulled himself together . “
68619	68661	68608	68608	I	0	” He flattered himself that his simulation of buoyancy had produced the desired effect , and that his parting from Mrs. Sellars was unclouded . But halfway down the hill he stood suddenly still in the path , and exclaimed aloud : “
68671	68801	68608	68608	I	0	” The picnic was beautifully successful — one of those smooth creaseless well - oiled successes as to which one feels that at any moment it may slip from one ’s hold and reveal the face of failure . A very Janus of a picnic , Boyne thought .... To the chief actors , however , it presented no such duality , but was the perfect image of what constitutes A Good Time For The Young People , when made out of the happy union of tact and money . To Mr. Dobree it was certainly that , and he was justified in feeling that if you order the two roomiest and most balloon - tired motors obtainable , and fill enough hampers with the most succulent delicacies of a “
68803	69041	69042	69042	She	1571	” restaurant , and are actuated throughout by the kindliest desire to give pleasure , happiness will automatically follow . As regards the younger members of the party , it undoubtedly did . Terry was strong enough to enjoy the long day on the heights without fear of Miss Scope ’s thermometer ; Blanca was impressed by the lavish fare which replaced their habitual bread and chocolate ; and the small children were in the state of effervescence induced by freedom from lessons and the sense of being the central figures of the day . And Judith — ? After lunch the younger members of the party trailed away with Miss Scope to hunt for wild strawberries while the others sat pillowed in moss beside a silver waterfall . Boyne , supine against his boulder , studied the scene and meditated from behind a screen of pipe smoke . Judith , a little way off , leaned luxuriously against her mossy cushion , her hat tossed aside , her head resting in the curve of an immature arm . Her profile looked small and clear against the auburn tremor of bracken turned inward by the rush of the water . A live rose burned in her cheeks , darkening her eyebrows and lashes , and putting a velvet shadow under her closed lids . She had fallen asleep , and sleep surrendered her unguarded to her watchers . “
69061	69433	69054	69054	she	1571	” Boyne asked himself , suddenly disturbed , not by her increased prettiness ( the measure of that varied from hour to hour ) but by some new quality in it . He turned his eyes away , and they fell on Mr. Dobree , who sat facing him in the studied _ abandon _ of a picnicker unused to picnics . Mr. Dobree ’s inexhaustible wardrobe had supplied him with just the slightly shabby homespun suit and slightly faded hat adapted to the occasion ; and Boyne wondered whether it were this change of dress which made him also seem different . But no : the difference was deeper . Despite his country clothes , Mr. Dobree did not look easier or less urban ; he merely looked more excited and off his guard . His clear cautious eyes had grown blurred and furtive ; one could almost see a faint line stretching from them to the recumbent Judith . Along that line it was manifest that Mr. Dobree ’s thoughts were racing ; and Boyne knew they were the same thoughts as his own . The discovery shocked him indescribably . But he remembered that the levelling tendencies of modern life have levelled differences of age with the rest ; and that Mr. Dobree was , to all intents and purposes , but little older than himself . Moreover , he was still brisk and muscular ; his glance was habitually alert ; in spite of his silver hair there seemed no reason why he should not share with Boyne the contemplation of Judith ’s defenceless beauty . But if this was Boyne ’s conclusion it was apparently not Mr. Dobree ’s . As Boyne continued to observe him , Mr. Dobree ’s habitual pinkness turned to a red which suffused even his temples and eyelids , so that his carefully brushed white hair looked like a sunlit cloud against an angry sky . But with whom was Mr. Dobree angry ? Why , with himself , manifestly . His eyes still rested on the dreaming Judith ; but the rest of his face looked as if every muscle were tightened in the effort to pull the eyes away . “
69444	69676	69438	69438	he	1572	” Boyne thought , calling to mind — with a faint recoil from the reminder — that he also , once or twice , had been vaguely afraid of himself when he had looked too long at Judith . Had his eyes been like that , he wondered ? And the muscles of his face been stretched in the effort to detach the eyes ? The thing was not pleasant to visualise ; and he disliked Mr. Dobree the more for serving as his mirror .... But suddenly Mr. Dobree was on his feet , his whole attention given to Mrs. Sellars . Again Boyne followed his change of direction with a start . Mrs. Sellars — but then she had been there all the time ! Shadowed by her spreading hat , her light body bedded in the turf , she looked almost as young and sylvan as Judith . But somehow she had been merged in the landscape , all broken up into a dapple of sun and shade , of murmurs and soughings : her way of fitting into things sometimes had this effect of effacing her . She lifted her head , and in the shade of the hat - brim Boyne caught a delicate watchfulness of brows and lips , as of tiny live things under a protecting leaf . Mr. Dobree was challenging her jauntily . “
69716	69723	69694	69695	Mr. Boyne	145	” The words said clearly enough : “
69733	69742	69694	69695	Mr. Boyne	145	” and Mrs. Sellars ’s gay little answer : “
69756	69763	69764	69764	I	0	” seemed to declare as clearly : “
69780	69807	69772	69772	you	1573	” She was on her feet before his hands could help her up ; something light and bounding in her seemed to spring to his call . “
69814	70021	70022	70022	Martin	193	” she cried , starting ahead of him up the boulder - strewn way . Boyne heard their voices mounting the streamside , mingling with the noise of the water , fading and flashing out again like the glimpses of her dress through the beech - leaves . He lay without moving , watching the smoke of his pipe rise in wavering spirals , twisted out of shape by puffs of air from the waterfall . With Mr. Dobree ’s withdrawal the ideas suggested by his presence had gone too ; Judith Wheater seemed once more a little girl . Though perplexities and uncertainties still lingered on the verge of Boyne ’s mind his central self was anchored in a deep circle of peace . Every fibre of him was alive to the exquisite moment ; but he had no need to fly from it , no fear of its flying from him . Judith ’s sleep was a calm pool in which he rested . He fancied he must have been watching her for a long time , his thoughts enclosing her in a sort of calm fraternal vigilance , when she opened her eyes and turned them on him , still dewy with sleep . “
70024	70041	70042	70042	Darling	3107	” she hailed him drowsily ; then , fully awake , she sat up and exclaimed : “
70061	70158	70052	70052	I	0	” She was always startling Boyne , but she had perhaps never startled him more than by this question ; for even as she spoke he had been half unconsciously putting it to himself . He remembered , as something already far off , picturesque and unreal as a youthful folly , his resentment of Mrs. Sellars ’s delay in fixing a date for their marriage . Was it only two or three weeks ago that he had sent her , with a basket of gentians picked on a lofty upland , a quotation from Marvell ’s “
70161	70206	70052	70052	I	0	” ? Now all that seemed an undergraduate ’s impatience . She had taught him that they were very well as they were , and if he still asked himself when they were to be married , the question had imperceptibly taken another form . “
70222	70276	70052	70052	I	0	” was the way he now instinctively put it . He too sat up , and gazed into Judith ’s sleepy eyes . As he did so he was aware that an uncomfortable redness ( which did not , he hoped , resemble Mr. Dobree ’s ) was creeping up to his temples . “
70305	70321	70292	70292	I	0	” he grumbled in an ill - assured voice . Judith brushed the rebuff aside . “
70338	70355	70292	70292	I	0	” she continued , as if affectionately resolved to break down the barrier of his reserve . “
70373	70374	70366	70366	you	0	” “
70382	70390	70375	70375	You	0	” A quick shadow crossed her face . “
70398	70399	70391	70391	You	0	” “
70428	70455	70414	70414	I	0	” Her eyes grew wide at this , and continued to fix him with a half mocking gravity , while her lips rounded into a smile . “
70476	70523	70465	70466	Mrs. Sellars	163	” Boyne burst out laughing . How could one ever keep serious for two minutes with any of these preposterous children ? And once more he told himself that Judith was as preposterous , and as much of a child , as the youngest of them . “
70541	70569	70529	70529	you	3107	” she adjured him , as if his very life depended on his following her advice . He leaned on his elbow and examined her with deliberation . “
70578	70587	70529	70529	you	3107	” She shook her head , still smiling . “
70611	70613	70602	70602	you	193	” ( “
70617	70622	70615	70615	you	193	” Boyne interjected . ) “
70648	70649	70651	70651	your	193	” “
70661	70670	70655	70655	I	0	” After a moment he added with severity : “
70680	70706	70673	70674	Mrs. Sellars	163	” The girl stood up , and crossing the mossy space between them , dropped down beside him and laid her hand on his arm . “
70745	70746	70730	70730	I	0	” “
70756	70769	70749	70749	you	193	” Boyne answered , turning away from her to relight his pipe . “
70862	70887	70858	70858	you	193	” she urged , as if straining her utmost to reach some human chord in him . He met the question with another laugh . “
70904	70921	70901	70901	you	193	” She coloured a little at the insinuation ; and perceiving this , he hastened on : “
70952	70961	70964	70964	Martin	193	” Her face became all sympathy and interrogation . “
70980	71027	70966	70966	you	193	” Her look and intonation showed that she would have been genuinely distressed if they had . A pang like neuralgia shot through Boyne — yet a pang that was not all bitter . He took her hand , and laid what she had once called a “
71031	71035	71040	71040	dear	2469	” on it . “
71076	71151	71065	71065	you	2469	” She met this in silence , as something manifestly final . Folding her arms behind her , she let her head droop back on them , and her gaze wandered lazily skyward through the flicker of boughs . Boyne had got his pipe going again . Gradually the tumult in his mind subsided . He sank back lazily at her side , tilting his hat over his brows , and saying to himself : “
71164	71718	71065	71065	you	2469	” Directly in the line of his vision , Judith ’s sandalled feet lay in a bed of bracken , crossed like a resting Mercury ’s . He could almost see the little tufted wings at the heels . For the moment his imagination was imprisoned in a circle close about them . XXI That evening , when the children , weary but still jubilant , had been dropped at the _ Pension Rosenglüh _ , and Boyne had joined Mrs. Sellars for a late dinner at the _ châlet _ , the first thing that struck him was that his sapphire had reappeared on her hand . He wondered afterward how it was that he , in general so unobservant of such details , had noticed that she had resumed the modest stone ; and concluded that it was because of Judith ’s ridiculous cross - examination about the date of his marriage . He almost suspected that , baffled by his evasiveness , the pertinacious child had ended by addressing herself to Mrs. Sellars , and that the latter , thus challenged , had put on her ring . But no — though Judith was sometimes lacking in tact ( as she herself acknowledged ) this indiscretion could not be imputed to her , for the reason that Mrs. Sellars — Boyne remembered it only now — had not reappeared on the scene till it was time to pack the sleepy picnickers into the motors . She and Mr. Dobree had been a long time away . They had apparently prolonged their walk , and , incidentally , had failed to find the promised strawberries — or else had consumed them on the spot . And on the way home Judith and Mrs. Sellars had not been in the same car . Why , then , had Mrs. Sellars suddenly put on her ring ? Boyne would only suppose that she had decided , for reasons unknown to him , to announce their engagement that night to Mr. Dobree , who was no doubt going to join them at dinner . The idea obscurely irritated Boyne ; he felt bored in advance by the neat and obvious things Mr. Dobree would consider it becoming to say . Boyne ’s whole view of Mrs. Sellars ’s friend had been changed by his sudden glimpse of the man who had looked out of Mr. Dobree ’s eyes at Judith . Before that , Boyne had pigeon - holed him as the successful lawyer , able in his profession , third - rate in other capacities , with a methodically planned existence of which professional affairs filled the larger part , and the rest was divided up like a carefully - weighed vitamin diet ( Mr. Dobree was strong on vitamins ) between exercise , society , philanthropy and travel . Now , a long way off down this fair perspective , a small , an almost invisible Dobree , lurked and prowled , staring as he had stared at Judith . A sudden irritation filled Boyne at the thought of what , unknown to Mrs. Sellars , peered and grimaced behind her legal counsellor . It was as if Mr. Dobree had unconsciously evoked for him some tragic allegory of Judith ’s future .... “
71730	71752	71725	71725	we	1591	” Boyne ’s question sounded abrupt in his own ears , but was received by Mrs. Sellars with her usual equanimity . “
71770	71805	71765	71765	He	2832	” Boyne felt relieved , yet vaguely baffled . If Dobree was n’t coming ( he immediately thought ) , why the devil was n’t he ? And what was he up to instead ? “
71835	71836	71823	71823	he	2832	” “
71867	71905	71861	71861	he	2832	” This seemed to dispose of the matter , and Boyne , still faintly disturbed , followed his betrothed to the dining - table , at which of late he had so seldom sat alone with her . “
71915	72002	71908	71908	you	0	” she asked , smiling at him across the bowl of wild roses which stood between them . It was indeed uncommonly pleasant to be alone with her again . She gratified him , at the outset , by praising the behaviour of the children on the picnic ; and as they talked he began to think that his growing irritability , and his odd reluctance to look forward to their future together , had been caused only by the intrusion of irrelevant problems and people . “
72014	72110	72111	72111	Judith	127	” he thought , reassured . Dinner over , they drifted out onto the balcony in the old way , and he lit his cigar , and yielded to the sense of immediate wellbeing . He saw that Rose Sellars knew he was glad to be alone with her , and that the knowledge put her at her ease , and made her want to say and do whatever would maintain that mood in him . There was something pathetic in the proud creature ’s eagerness to be exactly what he wished her to be . “
72132	72179	72183	72183	he	200	” she said softly , after a silence . It was as if she had flung a boulder into the very middle of the garden - plot she had just been at such pains to lay out . Boyne met the remark with an exasperated laugh . “
72194	72195	72183	72183	he	200	” “
72205	72214	72198	72198	she	127	” Mrs. Sellars conceded , still more gently . “
72245	72246	72247	72247	Martin	193	” “
72250	72251	72247	72247	Martin	193	” “
72303	72304	72306	72306	her	127	” “
72314	72354	72311	72312	Mr. Dobree	200	” Mrs. Sellars gave way to a mild mirth . His words certainly sounded absurd enough when she echoed them ; but Boyne , for the moment , was beyond heeding anything but the tumult in his own veins . “
72358	72362	72311	72312	Mr. Dobree	200	” he continued . “
72431	72444	72424	72424	I	0	” Mrs. Sellars waited a little before answering ; then she said : “
72503	72504	72500	72501	Mr. Dobree	200	” “
72512	72520	72508	72508	you	0	” Boyne agreed with an ironic shrug . “
72551	72552	72536	72536	she	127	” “
72578	72579	72567	72567	he	200	” “
72587	72588	72584	72584	you	0	” “
72624	72669	72616	72616	you	0	” Mrs. Sellars fell silent again . He saw the faint lines of perplexity weaving their net over her face , and reflected that when a woman is no longer young she can preserve her air of freshness only in the intervals of feeling . “
72675	72703	72706	72706	her	2422	” he thought , vexed with himself for having upset the delicate balance of her serenity . But now she was smiling again , a little painfully . “
72713	72714	72706	72706	her	2422	” “
72723	72728	72706	72706	her	2422	” The smile persisted . “
72762	72763	72755	72755	he	200	” “
72768	72782	72755	72755	he	200	” Boyne murmured at this touch of feminine vanity . Mrs. Sellars continued : “
72837	72860	72823	72823	he	200	” The words dropped from her with a serene detachment , as if they had been her luminous little smile made audible . “
72876	72914	72918	72919	Marry Dobree	250	” she added , with one of her old - fashioned impulses of reserve . It was Boyne ’s turn to find no answer . For some time he sat gazing into the summer darkness without speaking . “
72923	72924	72921	72921	you	0	” “
72938	72943	72931	72931	he	200	” she softly bantered . “
72973	73028	72967	72967	he	200	” she added , with a faint sigh in which deprecation and satisfaction were perceptibly mingled . If it was her little triumph she took it meekly , even generously — but nevertheless , he saw , with a complete consciousness of what it meant . Boyne laughed again , this time at himself . “
73043	73081	73034	73034	you	0	” Mrs. Sellars murmured , a faint note of vexation in her voice . Again he found no reply , and she continued , with the distant air she assumed when echoing axioms current in her youth : “
73094	73095	72967	72967	he	200	” “
73100	73182	72967	72967	he	200	” Boyne agreed good - humouredly . He rubbed his hand across his forehead , as if to brush away some inner confusion . But it was no use ; he could n’t straighten his thoughts out . He could n’t shake off the fact that his surprise and derision had not concerned Rose Sellars at all — that his laugh had simply mocked his own power of self - deception , and uttered his relief at finding himself so deceived . “
73190	73214	72967	72967	he	200	” The words escaped him unawares . In the dusk he felt the shadowy figure at his side stiffen and withdraw from him . “
73225	73337	73339	73339	you	1612	” said Mrs. Sellars , turning back toward the lamplight . Boyne , still in the bewilderment of his own thoughts , followed her into the room . He noticed that she had grown unusually pale . She sat down beside the table , and began turning over the letters and papers which the evening post had brought . Boyne stood in front of the fireplace , his hands in his pockets , watching her movements as one letter after another slipped through her fingers . But all he could see was the sapphire ring , re - established , enthroned , proclaiming his own destiny to all concerned and unconcerned . “
73347	73354	73339	73339	you	1612	” She looked up at him . “
73364	73365	73339	73339	you	1612	” “
73379	73380	73393	73393	Dobree	200	” “
73385	73386	73393	73393	Dobree	200	” “
73402	73418	73393	73393	Dobree	200	” She weighed this , and then laughed a little , but without much gaiety . “
73434	73442	73393	73393	Dobree	200	” He continued to look at her . “
73449	73479	73444	73444	you	1612	” The colour rose to her forehead . She dropped the letters , and composed her hands on them as if in the effort to control a secret agitation . “
73499	73522	73496	73497	Mr. Dobree	200	” He hesitated , feeling ( and now he hated himself for feeling ) that it was a moment for going warily . “
73579	73589	73575	73575	you	1612	” he reminded her , as she remained silent . “
73597	73601	73594	73594	my	0	” She pondered . “
73615	73616	73609	73610	Mr. Dobree	200	” “
73631	73632	73594	73594	my	0	” “
73657	73700	73645	73648	all the Wheater children	1616	” She spoke the words ever so lightly , as if she had barely pencilled them on a smooth page . Boyne was startled . He could see no analogy , but did not know how to explain that there was none . “
73724	73733	73721	73721	Judith	127	” He smiled a little at the reminiscence . “
73740	73769	73736	73737	Mr. Dobree	200	” he added , with a return of ease . After all , he was carrying it off very well , he thought — though what he meant by “
73771	73789	73721	73721	Judith	127	” he would have been put to it to say . Mrs. Sellars gave another little laugh . “
73814	73817	73821	73821	you	0	is”—she paused a moment—“he
73829	73868	73826	73827	Judith Wheater	127	” Instantly all the resentments and suspicions which Boyne had dismissed rushed back on him . He had been right , then — he had not mistaken the signs and portents . As if they were ever mistakable ! “
73872	73895	73896	73896	Martin	193	” he said in a low voice . Mrs. Sellars dropped one of the letters which she had absently taken up again . “
73898	73899	73896	73896	Martin	193	” “
73924	73941	73948	73948	he	200	” He broke off , and then began again , on a fresh wave of indignation : “
74023	74105	74106	74106	Martin	193	” Boyne ’s words sounded in his own ears as if they were being megaphoned at him across the width of the room . He dropped down into the nearest chair , hot , angry , ashamed , with a throat as dry as if he had been haranguing an open - air meeting on a dusty day . Opposite him , Mrs. Sellars remained with her hands suspended above the letters . The sapphire burned at him across the interval . “
74118	74135	74136	74136	I	0	” she exclaimed . She paused a moment , and then added in a quieter voice : “
74144	74173	74136	74136	I	0	” They sat and looked at each other without speaking . At length Boyne rose , and started to move around the table to where she was sitting . “
74178	74337	74136	74136	I	0	” he began . She held up her hand , and the gesture , though evidently meant only to check the words on his lips , had the effect also of arresting his advance . He felt self - conscious and clumsy , and dimly resented her making him feel so . He was sure it was she who had been ridiculous , not he ; yet , curiously enough , the conviction brought him no solace . Again they faced each other , guardedly , apprehensively , as if something fragile and precious , which they had been carrying together , had slipped between their fingers and been broken . He felt that , if he glanced at the floor , he might see the glittering fragments .... Mrs. Sellars was the first to recover her self - possession . She rose in her turn , and going up to Boyne laid her hand on his arm . “
74349	74399	74136	74136	I	0	” She looked at him through moist lashes , and he felt himself a brute for not instantly taking her in his arms and obliterating their discussion with a kiss . But there lay the glittering fragments , and he could not seem to reach to her across them . “
74409	74414	74404	74404	she	1630	” he reflected savagely . “
74431	74452	74425	74425	I	0	” She was clasping his arm , pleading with lifted eyes and lips . Her self - abasement humiliated him . “
74469	74473	74464	74464	she	1630	” he wondered . “
74499	74503	74504	74504	His	200	” He smiled . “
74511	74519	74524	74524	he	200	” She smiled back a little wearily . “
74561	74568	74542	74542	your	0	” Boyne felt himself hardening again . “
74592	74602	74584	74584	You	0	” She seized at this with a distressing humility . “
74649	74673	74616	74616	you	0	” Her arms stole up to his shoulders , her hands met behind his neck , and she drew his head down softly . “
74683	74759	74616	74616	you	0	” As their lips touched he shut his eyes , and tried , with a violent effort of the will , to recall what her kiss would have meant to him on the far - off day when the news of Sellars ’s death had overtaken him somewhere in the Nubian desert , and in the middle of the night he had started awake , still clutching the letter , and crying out to himself : “
74763	74934	74616	74616	you	0	” XXII Next day , when Boyne thought over the scene of the previous night , he found for it all the excuses which occur to a sensible man in the glow of his morning bath . It was all the result of idling and lack of hard exercise ; when a working man has had too long a holiday , and resting has become dawdling , Satan proverbially intervenes . But though at first Boyne assumed all the blame , by the time he began to shave he had handed over a part to Mrs. Sellars . After all , it was because of her old - fashioned scruples , her unwillingness to marry him at once , and let him get back to work , that they were still loitering in the Dolomites . It probably was n’t safe for middle - aged people to have too much leisure in which to weigh each other ’s faults and merits . But then , again , suddenly he thought : “
74957	75059	74616	74616	you	0	” It was undoubtedly because Mrs. Sellars had insisted on prolonging their engagement that Boyne had become involved in the Wheater problem ; but when he reached this point in his retrospect he found he could not preserve his impartiality . It was impossible to face the thought of what might have happened to the little Wheaters if chance had not put him in their way .... After all , then , everything was for the best . All he had to do was to persuade Mrs. Sellars of it ( which ought not to be difficult , since it was a “
75061	75118	75119	75119	You	1640	” of her own devising ) , and to banish from his mind the disturbing figure of Mr. Dobree . Perhaps — on second thoughts — his irritability of the previous evening had been partly due to the suspicion that Mrs. Sellars , for all her affected indifference , was flattered by Mr. Dobree ’s proposal . “
75124	75195	75119	75119	You	1640	” Boyne concluded , and shrugged that possibility away too . The thought that he might have had to desert his young friends in their hour of distress , and had been able , instead , to stay and help them , effaced all other considerations . So successfully did he talk himself over to this view that only one cloud remained on his horizon . Mrs. Sellars had said : “
75227	75838	75119	75119	You	1640	” ; and in saying it she had put her finger on Boyne ’s inmost apprehension . He had told himself the same thing a hundred times ; but to hear it from any one else made the danger seem more pressing . It reminded him that the little Wheaters ’ hold on him was not half as frail as his own on them , and that it was folly to indulge the illusion that he could really direct or control their fate . And meanwhile — ? Well , he could only mark time ; thank heaven it was still his to mark ! The Lido season had not yet reached its climax , and till it declined and fell he was free to suppose that its devotees would linger on , hypnotized . As between taking steps for an immediate divorce , and figuring to the last in the daily round of entertainment , Boyne felt sure that not one of the persons concerned would hesitate . They could settle questions of business afterward ; and it was purely as business that they regarded a matter in which the extent of the alimony was always the chief point of debate . And what could replace the excitement of a Longhi ball at the Fenice , or of a Marriage of the Doge to the Adriatic , mimed in a reconstituted Bucentaur by the rank and fashion of half Europe ? No one would be leaving Venice yet . But , all the same , the days were flying . The increasing number of arrivals at Cortina , the growing throng of motors on all the mountain ways , showed that before long fashion would be moving from the seashore to the mountains ; and when the Lido broke up , what might not break up with it ? Boyne felt that the question must at last be faced ; that he must have a talk about it that very day with Judith . It was more than a month since Judith and her flock had appeared at Cortina ; and the various parents concerned had promised Boyne that the children should be left in the Dolomites till the summer was over . But what was such a promise worth , and what did the phrase mean on lips so regardless of the seasons ? Nothing — Boyne knew it . He was conscious now that , during the last four weeks , he had never gone down to the _ Pension Rosenglüh _ without expecting to be told that a summons or a command had come from the Lido . But so far there had been none . The children were protected by the fact that there was no telephone at the _ pension _ , and that none of their parents was capable — except under the most extreme pressure — of writing a letter . When it was impossible to telephone they could , indeed , telegraph ; but even the inditing of a telegram required a concentration of mind which , Boyne knew , would become increasingly difficult as the Lido season culminated . Telegrams did , of course , come , especially in the first days , both to Boyne and to Judith : long messages from Joyce about clothes and diet , rambling communications from Lady Wrench , setting forth her rights and grievances in terms which , by the time they had passed through two Italian telegraph - offices , were as confused as the thoughts in her own mind ; and lastly , a curt wire from Cliffe Wheater to Boyne : “
75853	75862	75849	75849	Chipstone	142	” To all these communications Boyne returned a comprehensive “
75866	75891	75849	75849	Chipstone	142	” and , acting on his advice , Judith did the same , merely adding particulars as to the children ’s health and happiness . “
75899	75905	75896	75896	you	1645	” she explained to Boyne , “
75927	76068	75920	75920	I	0	” She and Terry still cherished the hope that in the autumn she would be permitted to take the children out to Grandma Mervin , in America ; or that , failing permission , she would be encouraged by Boyne to carry them off secretly . With this in view , she and Miss Scope saved up every penny they could of the allowance which Cliffe Wheater had agreed to make , and which Boyne dealt out to them once a week . But all these arrangements were so precarious , so dependent on the moods of unreasonable and uncertain people , that it seemed a miracle that the little party at the _ Pension Rosenglüh _ was still undisturbed . Certainly , if it had been possible to reach them by telephone they would have been scattered long ago . “
76084	76100	76078	76078	they	1647	” Boyne had warned Judith from the first ; but she had always answered hopefully : “
76145	76398	76399	76401	A stupid woman	1651	” Cowes , in due course , had been relinquished , the Lido exerting too strong a counter - attraction ; but after a few more weeks that show also would be packed away in the lumber - room of spent follies . The fact of having these questions always on his mind kept Boyne from being unduly disturbed by his discussion of the previous evening with Mrs. Sellars . In the wholesome light of morning a sentimental flurry between two sensible people who were deeply attached to each other seemed as nothing compared to the ugly reality perpetually hanging over the little Wheaters ; and he felt sure that Mrs. Sellars would take the same view . She did not disappoint him . When he presented himself at the luncheon hour the very air of the little sitting - room breathed a new serenity ; it was as if she had been out early to fill it with flowers . Boyne was not used to delicate readjustments in his sentimental relations . For so many years now his feeling for Rose Sellars had been something apart , like a beautiful picture on the wall of a quiet room ; and his other amorous episodes had been too brief and simple for any great amount of manœuvring . He was therefore completely reassured by the gaiety and simplicity of her welcome , and thought to himself once again that there was everything to be said in favour of a long social acquiescence . “
76440	76606	76399	76401	A stupid woman	1651	” There was nothing of the blue - bottle about Mrs. Sellars ; and she was timorously anxious that Boyne should know it . But her timidity was not base ; if she submitted , she submitted proudly . The only sign she gave of a latent embarrassment was in her too great ease , her too blithe determination to deny it . But even this was minimised by the happy fact that she had a piece of news for him . She did not tell him what it was till lunch was over , and they were finishing their coffee in the sitting - room : she knew the importance of not disturbing a man ’s train of thought — even agreeably — while he is in the act of enjoying good food . Boyne had lit his cigar , and was meditating on the uniform excellence of the coffee she managed to give him , when she said , with a little laugh : “
76636	76714	76624	76624	She	203	” Boyne had pictured Aunt Julia — when he could spare the time for such an evocation — as something solid , ponderous , essentially immovable . She represented for him the obstinate stability of old New York in the flux of new experiments . It was like being told that Trinity Church , for instance , was taking a Loretto - flight across the Atlantic to see him . Mrs. Sellars laughed at his incredulous stare . “
76768	76818	76761	76762	Aunt Julia	203	” They agreed that such resurrections were not uncommon , and Mrs. Sellars went so far as to declare that , if she did n’t get to Paris in time to meet Aunt Julia , she was prepared to have the latter charter an aeroplane and descend on Cortina . “
76842	76959	76828	76828	I	0	” She went on to say that she would have to leave in a day or two , as Aunt Julia , who was accustomed to having her path smoothed for her , had requested that hotel rooms fulfilling all her somewhat complicated requirements should be made ready for her arrival , a six - cylinder motor with balloon tires and an irreproachable chauffeur engaged to meet her at the station , and a doctor and a masseuse be found in attendance when she arrived — as a result of which precautions she hoped , after an interval of repose , to be well enough to occupy herself with her niece ’s plans . Boyne gasped . “
76971	76972	76960	76961	Good Lord	1660	” “
76986	77086	76983	76984	Aunt Julia	203	” said Aunt Julia ’s niece with a certain deference . Boyne laughed , and agreed that Mrs. Sellars could not prudently refuse such a summons . Somehow it no longer offended him that she should obey it from motives so obviously interested . He could not have said why , but it now seemed to him natural enough that she should hold herself at the disposal of a rich old aunt . He wondered whether it was because her departure would serve to relieve a passing tension ; but he dismissed this as a bit of idle casuistry . “
77114	77130	77097	77097	she	1661	” Mrs. Sellars cast a wistful look about her . After a pause she said : “
77154	77180	77136	77136	I	0	” in a tone suggesting that she had rather expected Boyne to say it for her , and that he had somehow missed a cue . “
77209	77233	77195	77195	You	0	” She smiled a little perplexedly : evidently other plans were in her mind , plans she had pictured him as instinctively divining . “
77252	77253	77256	77256	I	0	” “
77262	77281	77256	77256	I	0	” The perplexity lifted from her smile : it seemed to reach out to him like a promise . “
77322	77352	77307	77308	the doctor	1137	” Boyne listened in astonishment . It had never seriously occurred to him that he was to be involved in the ceremony of establishing Aunt Julia on European soil . “
77378	77379	77380	77380	You	0	” “
77428	77429	77420	77420	I	0	” “
77433	77438	77420	77420	I	0	” She nodded gaily . “
77481	77549	77550	77550	You	0	” The words fell on a silence which Boyne , for the moment , found it impossible to break . Mrs. Sellars stood by her writing - table , her slender body leaning to him , her face lit with one of those gleams of lost youth which he had once found so exquisite and poignant . He found it so now , but with another poignancy . “
77564	77571	77615	77615	she	1673	” He broke off , the words “
77575	77604	77605	77605	I	0	” choking on his lips . Through a mist of bewilderment he saw the tender mockery of her smile , and knew how much courage it disguised . ( “
77620	77622	77615	77615	she	1673	” ) “
77639	77665	77624	77624	you	0	” She came close , clasped her hands about his arm , lifted her delicate face , still alight with expectation . The face said : “
77676	77728	77729	77729	Martin	193	” and he thought again of the glittering fragments he had seen at his feet the night before . He detached her hands , and lifted them , one after another , to his kiss . If only some word — if only the right word — would come to him ! “
77742	77759	77729	77729	Martin	193	” she suddenly challenged him . He held her hands against his breast , caressing them . “
77796	77842	77857	77857	you	193	” No ; he could n’t go on ; the words strangled him . He was too sure that she was aware they did not express what he was thinking , were spoken only to gain time . But with a gentle tenacity she pursued : “
77973	77982	77983	77983	I	0	” Her arms stole up and drew him . “
78056	78068	78075	78075	her	203	” He listened in a kind of stupor , saying inwardly : “
78106	78142	78143	78143	Dear	2469	” The silence prolonged itself , on her side stretched and straining , on his built up like a wall , opaque , impenetrable . From beyond it came her little far - off laugh . “
78155	78166	78167	78167	Rose	162	” Evidently there had to be an answer to that . “
78169	78213	78167	78167	Rose	162	” he began . Pretty as her name was , he hardly ever called her by it ; he had always felt her too close to him to need a name . She looked up in surprise . He made a fresh start . “
78224	78233	78215	78215	you	2469	” A little tremor ran across her face . “
78237	78238	78239	78239	You	2469	” “
78262	78284	78285	78285	I	0	” The tremor ceased , and her face once more became smooth and impenetrable . He found himself repeating to vacancy : “
78289	78305	78306	78306	You	2469	” She drew quietly away , and sat down at a little distance from him . “
78318	78319	78306	78306	You	2469	” “
78362	78363	78343	78343	I	0	” “
78380	78396	78397	78397	Martin	193	” She leaned forward , her face drawn with the valiant effort of her smile . “
78468	78478	78479	78479	We	1689	” Boyne paused a moment ; then he said : “
78506	78507	78508	78508	My	0	” “
78531	78558	78559	78559	Martin	193	” She stood up , trembling a little . She was very pale , and her thin eyebrows drew a straight black bar across her forehead . “
78573	78574	78561	78561	I	0	” “
78589	78590	78581	78581	you	193	” “
78602	78628	78593	78593	I	0	” He stood leaning against the chimney , as far from her as the little room allowed . A tide of resistance rose in him . “
78637	78654	78655	78655	Martin	193	” He was conscious that she was making an intense effort to steady her quivering nerves . “
78665	78666	78667	78667	You	0	” “
78672	78677	78678	78678	You	193	” he said patiently . “
78689	78696	78678	78678	You	193	” she flashed back , crimsoning . “
78703	78707	78678	78678	You	193	” he pleaded . “
78710	78714	78678	78678	You	193	” She paused . “
78728	78729	78678	78678	You	193	” “
78817	78841	78847	78847	you	193	” She received this with bent head and hands clasped stiffly across her knee ; but suddenly her self - control broke down . “
78865	78866	78867	78867	I	0	” “
78872	78877	78867	78867	I	0	” he said simply . “
78888	78889	78883	78883	you	0	” “
78912	78913	78905	78905	I	0	” “
78948	78949	78950	78950	Rose	162	” “
78955	78962	78950	78950	Rose	162	” he interrupted , very low . “
78986	78987	78988	78988	I	0	” “
78995	78996	78988	78988	I	0	” “
79024	79025	79026	79026	I	0	” “
79036	79037	79026	79026	I	0	” “
79062	79063	79064	79064	I	0	” “
79079	79080	79072	79072	I	0	” “
79114	79140	79099	79099	you	0	” He lifted his hands to his face , and covered his eyes , as if from some intolerable vision she had summoned to them . “
79159	79160	79154	79154	’s	1698	” “
79168	79187	79165	79165	I	0	” She got up and came close to him again ; he felt her hands on his arm . “
79223	79224	79190	79190	Martin	193	” “
79227	79228	79190	79190	Martin	193	” “
79272	79315	79269	79269	I	0	” He dropped his hands , and turned his discouraged eyes on her . But he could only feel that he and she were farther apart than when he had last looked at her ; all the rest was confusion and obscurity . “
79365	79366	79360	79360	I	0	” “
79371	79372	79360	79360	I	0	” “
79386	79747	79748	79748	Rose	162	” he repeated doggedly . For a time the two continued to stand in silence , with eyes averted , like people straining to catch some far - off sound which will signal relief from a pressing peril . Then , slowly , Boyne turned to Mrs. Sellars . His eyes rested on her profile , so thin , drawn , bloodless , that a fresh pang shot through him . He had often mocked at himself as a man who , in spite of all his wanderings , had never had a real adventure ; but now he saw that he himself had been one , had been Rose Sellars ’s Great Adventure , the risk and the enchantment of her life . While she had continued , during the weary years of her marriage , to be blameless , exemplary , patient and heroically gay , the thought of Boyne was storing up treasures for her which she would one day put out her hand and take — no matter how long she might have to wait . Her patience , Boyne knew , was endless — it was as long as her hair . She had trained herself to go on waiting for happiness , day after day , month after month , year after year , with the same air of bright unruffled vigilance , like a tireless animal waiting for its prey . One day her prey , her happiness , would appear , and she would snap it up ; and on that day there would be no escape from her .... It was terrible , it was hideous , to be picturing her distress as something grasping and predatory ; it was more painful still to be entering so acutely into her feelings while a central numbness paralysed his own . All around this numbness there was a great margin of pity and of comprehension ; but he knew this was not the region by way of which he could reach her . She who had always lived the life of reason would never forgive him if he called upon her reason now .... “
79750	79782	79783	79783	Dear	2469	” he appealed to her . She turned and he saw her face , composed , remodelled , suffused with a brilliancy like winter starlight . Her lips formed a smiling : “
79785	79786	79787	79787	Rose	162	” “
79789	79799	79787	79787	Rose	162	” She took his hand with the lightest pressure . “
79950	79965	79945	79945	you	162	” She paused , a little breathlessly , and then resumed her eager monologue . “
80008	80053	80056	80057	my dear	2807	” She had caught at the last splinter of the rock of Reason still visible above the flood ; and there she clung , dauntless , unbeaten , uttering the right , the impartial word with lips that pined and withered for his kiss .... “
80059	80063	80056	80057	my dear	2807	” he murmured . “
80068	80069	80056	80057	my dear	2807	” “
80076	80962	80056	80057	my dear	2807	” Before he could take her in his arms she had slipped out of reach , and softly , adroitly closed the door on him . Alone on the landing he was left with the sense that that deft gesture had shut him up with her forever . XXIII It was growing more and more evident to Boyne that he could recover his old vision of Mrs. Sellars only when they were apart . He began to think this must be due to his having loved her so long from a distance , having somehow , in consequence of their separation , established with her an ideal relation to which her slightest misapprehension , her least failure to say just what he expected , was a recurring menace . At first the surprise of finding her , after his long absence , so much younger and more vivid than his remembrance , the glow of long - imagined caresses , the whole enchanting harmony of her presence , had hushed the inner discord . But though she was dearer to him than ever , all free communication seemed to have ceased between them — he could regain it only during those imaginary conversations in which it was he who sustained both sides of the dialogue . This was what happened when he had walked off the pain and bewilderment of their last talk . For two hours he tramped the heights , unhappy , confused , struggling between the sense of her unreasonableness and of his own predicament ; then gradually there stole back on him the serenity always associated with the silent sessions of his thought and hers . On what seemed to him the fundamental issues — questions of fairness , kindness , human charity in the widest meaning — when had she ever failed him in these wordless talks ? His position with regard to the Wheater children ( had n’t he admitted it to her ? ) was unreasonable , indefensible , was whatever else she chose to call it ; yes , but it was also human , and that would touch her in the end . He had no doubt that when they met the next day she would have her little solution ready , and be prepared to smile with him over their needless perturbation . The thought of her deep submissive passion , which contrasted so sharply with his own uneasy self - assertiveness , was the only anxiety that remained with him . He knew now how much she loved him — but did he know how much he loved her ? Supposing , for instance , that on getting back to his hotel , now , this very evening , he should find a line telling him that she had decided for both their sakes to break their engagement : well , could he honestly say that it would darken earth and heaven for him ? Mortified , hurt , at a loose end — all this he would be ; already the tender flesh of his vanity was shrinking , and under it he felt the thrust of wounded affection . But that was all — in the balance how little ! He got back late to the hotel , and walked unheedingly past the letter - rack toward which , at that hour , it was usual to glance for the evening mail . The porter called to him , waving a letter . The envelope bore the New York post - mark , and in the upper corner Boyne recognised the name of the big firm of contracting engineers to whom he had owed some of his most important jobs . They still wrote now and then to consult him : no doubt this letter , which had been forwarded by his London bankers , was of that nature . He pushed it into his pocket , deciding to read it after he had dined . And then he proceeded to dine , alone in a corner of the unfashionable restaurant of his hotel , of which the tables with their thick crockery and clumsy water - carafes seemed like homely fragments of a recently - disjoined _ table d’hôte _ , the long old - fashioned hotel table at which travellers used to be seated in his parents ’ day . A coarse roll lay by his plate , the table bore a bunch of half - faded purply - pink cosmos in an opaque blue vase : everything about him was ugly and impersonal , yet he hugged himself for not being at the _ châlet _ table , with its air of exquisite rusticity , its bowl of cunningly - disposed wild flowers , the shaded candles , the amusing food . Yes ; and he was glad , too , not to be sharing the little Wheaters ’ pudding at the _ Pension Rosenglüh _ ; he was suddenly aware of an intense unexpected satisfaction in being for once alone , his own master , with no one that he need be on his guard against or at his best before ; no one to be tormented or enchanted by , no one to listen to and answer . “
80970	81183	80965	80965	I	0	” he thought , emptying his plateful of savourless soup with an appetite he was almost ashamed of . The moral of it , obviously , was that he had been idle too long , that what he was thirsting for at this very moment was not more rest but more work , and that the idea of giving up his life of rough and toilsome activity for the security of an office in New York , as he had aspired to do a few short months ago , now seemed intolerable . Too old for the fatigue and hardships of an engineer ’s life ? Why , it was the fatigues and the hardships which , physically speaking , had given the work its zest , just as the delicate mathematical calculations had provided its intellectual stimulus . The combination of two such sources of interest , so rare in other professions , was apparently what he needed to keep him straight , curb his excitable imagination , discipline his nerves , and make him wake up every morning to a steady imperturbable view of life . After dinner , sitting in the dreary little lounge , as he lit his pipe and pulled the letter from his pocket he thought : “
81199	81303	81304	81304	God	214	” It was nothing of the sort , of course : merely an inquiry for the address of a young engineer who had been Boyne ’s assistant a few years earlier , and whom the firm in question had lost sight of . They had been struck with Boyne ’s estimate of the young man ’s ability , and thought they might have an interesting piece of work for him , if he happened to be available , and was not scared by hardships and responsibility . Boyne put the letter into his pocket , leaned back in his chair , and thought : “
81319	81736	81306	81306	I	0	” His mind turned round and round this thought for the rest of the evening . Perhaps he could make Mrs. Sellars understand that , after all , he had made a mistake in supposing he had reached the age for sedentary labours . Once they were married she would surely see that , for his soul ’s sake , and until the remainder of his youth was used up , she must let him go off on these remote exciting expeditions which seemed the only cure for — for what ? Well , for the creeping grayness of age , no doubt . The fear of that must be what ailed him . At any rate he must get away ; he must . As soon as the fate of the little Wheaters was decided , and he and Rose were married , and he had established her in New York , he must get back into the glorious soul - releasing world of girders and abutments , of working stresses , curvatures and grades . She had talked of having her little plan ready for him the next day . Well , he would have one for her , at any rate ; this big comprehensive one . First , the Wheater tribe transplanted ( he did n’t yet see how ) to the safe shelter of Grandma Mervin ’s wing ; then his own marriage ; then — flight ! He worked himself into a glow of eloquence , as he always did in these one - sided talks , which never failed to end in convincing Mrs. Sellars because he unconsciously eliminated from them all the objections she might possibly have raised .... He went to bed with a sense of fresh air in his soul , as if the mere vision of escape had freed him .... Mrs. Sellars had not said at what hour she expected him the next day ; so he decided to wait till lunch , and drop in on her then , as his habit was when they had no particular expedition in view . In the morning he usually strolled down to see how the _ Rosenglüh _ refugees were getting on ; but on this occasion he left them to themselves , and did not go out till he made for the _ châlet _ . As he approached it he was startled by a queer sense of something impending . Oh , not another “
81738	81983	81310	81310	his	1712	” ; Rose was much too intelligent for that . What he felt was just an uneasy qualm , as if the new air in his soul ’s lungs were being gradually pumped out of them again . He glanced up at the balcony , lifting his hand to signal to her ; but she was not there . He pushed open the hall door and ran up the short flight of stairs . The little sitting - room was empty : it looked speckless and orderly as a tomb . He noticed at once that the littered writing - table was swept and garnished , and that no scent of viands greeted him through the dining - room door . She had gone — he became suddenly sure that she had gone . But why ? But when ? Above all , why without a word ? It was so unlike her to do anything abrupt and unaccountable that his vague sense of apprehension returned . He sat down in the armchair he always occupied , as if the familiar act must re - evoke her , call her back into the seat opposite , in the spirit if not in the flesh . But the room remained disconcertingly , remained even spiritually empty . He had the sense that she had gone indeed , and had taken her soul with her ; and the discovery made a queer unexpected void in him . “
81989	81995	81996	81996	Rose	162	” he heard himself exclaiming . “
81998	82065	81996	81996	Rose	162	” he called out ; there was no answer . He stood up , and his wandering eye travelled from the table to the mantelpiece . On its shelf he saw a letter addressed to himself . He seized it and tore it open ; and all at once the accents of the writer ’s reasonableness floated out into the jangled air of the little room . “
82186	82283	82284	82284	He	1713	“ Besides ( I ’ll confess ) I want to keep the picture of our happiness here intact , not frayed and rubbed by more discussion , even the friendliest . You ’ll understand , I know . This being together has been something so complete , so exquisite , that I want to carry it away with me in its perfection .... I ’ll write in a few days . Till then , if you can , think of me as I think of you . No heart could ask more of another . Rose . ”
82405	82409	82414	82414	she	1714	“ fraying and rubbing ”
82656	82661	82662	82662	His	1713	“ dinner - roar . ”
82692	82703	82704	82704	he	1713	“ Have the wild animals left a morsel for me ? ”
82991	82998	82999	83000	Miss Scope	147	“ And nothing new in that , ”
83457	83470	83471	83471	he	145	“ The fact is , we ’re none of us grown up , ”
83647	83649	83639	83639	Blanca	128	“ lovely ”
83739	83741	83733	83733	Zinnie	133	“ clever ”
84159	84172	84173	84173	he	145	“ Two or three weeks ’ respite , anyhow ; and then , ”
84176	84195	84173	84173	he	145	“ who knows ? I may be able to carry them all back to New York with me . ”
84434	84444	84445	84445	he	145	“ It ’s to say she ’s coming back , ”
84542	84552	84525	84525	she	3780	“ But even if it were not , dear , ”
84557	84626	84525	84525	she	3780	“ I should n’t allow that to alter my plans — our plans — and I ’m prepared to have you carry me off under Aunt Julia ’s nose ( formidable though that feature is ) , if she should refuse her sanction . But she wo n’t ; and the important question is what we intend to do , and not what she may think about it . ”
84661	85160	84654	84654	He	145	“ But it ’s more important still that we should come to a clear understanding about our future — isn’t it , dearest ? I feel that I made such an understanding impossible the other day by my unreasonableness , my impatience , my apparent inability to see your point of view . But I did see it , even then ; and I see it much more clearly now that I have studied the question at a sufficient distance to focus it properly . Of course we both know that , whatever decision we reach , some of the numerous papas and mammas of your little friends may upset it at a moment ’s notice ; but meanwhile I have a plan to propose . What you want — isn’t it?—is to guard these poor children as long as possible from the unsettling and demoralising influence of continual change . I quite see your idea ; and it seems to me that those most exposed to such risks are the ones we ought to try to help . By your own showing , Mr. Wheater will never give up Chipstone for long ; Zinnie , and Prince Buondelmonte ’s funny little pair , are bound to be claimed by their respective parents now that they have settled down to wealth and domesticity . As for the enchanting Judith , though you persist in not seeing it , she will be grown up and married in a year or two ; and meanwhile , if the Wheaters do divorce , she will probably choose to remain with her mother , as she did before . The twins , in fact , seem to me the chief victims . They are old enough to understand what is going on , and not old enough to make themselves lives of their own ; and above all they are at an age when disintegrating influences are likely to do the most harm . You have often told me that poor Terry ’s health has been an obstacle between him and his father ( what a horrible idea that it should be so ! ) , and that the bouncing Chip has cut him out . Terry needs care and sympathy more than any of them ; and I am sure you will feel , as I do , that it would be unthinkable to separate dear little Blanca from the brother she adores . What I propose , then , is that you should ask Mr. and Mrs. Wheater to give up the twins — regarding us in any capacity you like , either as their friends , or as their legal guardians , if that is better — till they come of age . I will gladly take a share in looking after them , and I believe that between us we can turn them into happy useful members of society . If you agree , I am ready to — ”
85187	85193	85194	85194	he	145	“ Dear little Blanca indeed ! ”
85198	85204	85194	85194	he	145	“ Useful members of society ! ”
85311	85326	85328	85328	his	145	“ She chooses her because she knows she need never be jealous of her , ”
85812	85821	85810	85810	himself	145	“ to get the Lido out of his lungs ”
85987	86001	85984	85985	Mrs. Sellars	163	“ Though of course I should hate it like anything , I suppose .... ”
86110	86124	86096	86097	the porter	3050	“ There was a lady here — she left a parcel for you . ”
86125	86134	86096	86097	the porter	3050	“ A lady ? Where ’s the parcel ? ”
86135	86171	86096	86097	the porter	3050	“ Up in your room . I had to help her to carry it up . It was awkward getting it round the turn of the stairs . She left a letter for you too . ”
86515	86519	86507	86507	Boyne	145	“ Darling Martin , “
86615	86640	86613	86613	Blanca	128	” Under the last of the rudimentary signatures , Chipstone had scrawled his mark ; and below it was a scribbled postscript from Judith : “
86678	86706	86676	86676	Judith	127	” In the midnight silence Boyne sat and laughed and laughed until a nervous spinster in the next room banged on the wall and called out venomously : “
86717	86893	86676	86676	Judith	127	” BOOK IV XXV Boyne had been wrong in imagining that Mrs. Sellars might come back unannounced to assure herself of the effect of her letter . She did not do so ; and after two days he decided that he could no longer put off sending some kind of answer . Only , what could he say ? Being with the children all day and every day , sharing their meals , their games and scrambles , had gradually detached his thoughts from Mrs. Sellars , reducing her once more to the lovely shadow she had so long been ; with the difference that she was now a shadow irrevocably , whereas before he had always believed she might become substantial . Finally he girt himself to the task ; and at once his irritation , his impatience , seemed to materialise her again , as if she were fated to grow real only when she thwarted or opposed him . He wondered if that were another of the peculiarities of being in love . “
86915	86929	86912	86912	I	0	” he reflected , not altogether satisfied with this explanation . He wrote : “
87168	87188	87480	87480	you	0	” He broke off , flung down the pen , and sat hopelessly staring at what he had written . “
87198	87395	87480	87480	you	0	” he groaned . The truth was that , even in his most rebellious moments , he could not trick himself into the idea that he had a grievance against Mrs. Sellars . In reality it was the other way round . When he had gone to Venice to negotiate with the Wheaters about the future of their mutinous family he had gone as an affianced man . In pledging himself to his strange guardianship he had virtually pledged Mrs. Sellars also , and without even making his promise depend on her consent . He had simply assumed that because she loved him she would approve of whatever he did , would accept any situation he chose to put her in . He had behaved , in short , like a romantic boy betrothed to a dreamer of his own age . All this was true , and it was true also that Mrs. Sellars had never reproached him with it . The sense of her magnanimity deprived his argument of all its force , and benumbed his angry pen . He pushed away the letter , pulled out another sheet , and scrawled on it : “
87413	87476	87477	87477	I	0	” Yes , a telegram was better : easier to write , at any rate .... He tore up the letter , put on his hat , and walked down to the post - office with his message . For its answer he had only twenty - four hours to wait ; and when Mrs. Sellars ’s telegram came it merely said : “
87484	87619	87477	87477	I	0	” Well , that was not unsatisfactory , as far as it went ; but when two days more had elapsed , it was not a letter but a small registered packet which the postman put into Boyne ’s hands . Even in the act of signing the receipt , at his very first glance , he had guessed what the packet contained . He went up to his room , a little dizzy with the abruptness of the event , and angrily ripped off seal and string , revealing the morocco box he had expected to find there . For a minute or two he sat looking at the box , almost as unconscious of what he was feeling as a man in the first minute or two after being stabbed or shot . “
87625	87632	87477	87477	I	0	” he said aloud . But what “
87634	87699	87700	87700	I	0	” was going to be he had as yet no notion . It was a wound , of course — but was it mortal ? He did n’t know . Suddenly , with a mumbled curse at his own plight , he snapped the box open and saw a thin slip of paper twisted about the sapphire ring . On the paper he read : “
87735	87800	87721	87733	some woman who can make you as happy as you have made me	1840	” He pitched the box and the paper aside , and hid his face in his hands . After all he must have loved her , he supposed — or at least the vision of her which their long separation had created .... He was roused by a knock , and looking up with dazed eyes saw Judith Wheater standing doubtfully on the threshold . “
87820	87834	87812	87812	you	193	” She came in and closed the door without waiting for his answer . “
87842	87855	87836	87836	I	0	” she questioned , passing her cool hand softly over his hair . “
87860	87906	87836	87836	I	0	” He wondered whether her sharp eyes had already detected the open ring - box , and the paper signed with Rose ’s name . But to try to conceal them would only attract her attention . He put up his hand and pressed hers . “
87918	87922	87911	87911	I	0	” he said . “
87932	87970	87924	87924	I	0	” she interrupted reluctantly . She was bending over him with the look she had when one of the children fell and scraped a knee , and Boyne could not help smiling up into her anxious eyes . “
87990	87991	87924	87924	I	0	” “
88012	88013	88014	88014	You	0	” “
88018	88047	88014	88014	You	0	” In the struggle which had been going on in his mind since he had received Mrs. Sellars ’s letter he had completely forgotten the passage of time . “
88053	88057	88050	88050	you	0	” he exclaimed . “
88100	88126	88085	88085	I	0	” He fumbled for a box , and shoved it across the table to Judith , who had settled down comfortably into his only armchair . “
88141	88142	88085	88085	I	0	” “
88157	88191	88149	88149	you	0	” he rejoined , suddenly conscious of the ears of the acrimonious spinster next door , and wondering if he ought not to propose to Judith to finish her visit in the garden . “
88208	88224	88200	88200	you	193	” she declared with her rich candour ; and Boyne laughed in spite of himself . “
88239	88268	88225	88225	I	0	” he remarked , lighting a cigarette ; and Judith thrust her thin shoulder - blades into the chair back , crossed her legs , and sighed contentedly : “
88272	88273	88225	88225	I	0	” “
88283	88284	88288	88288	mother	2490	” “
88293	88333	88288	88288	mother	2490	” The laugh died on Boyne ’s lips . The expected menace — here it was ! He knew Joyce never wrote unless she had news of overwhelming importance , and usually of a disagreeable nature , to impart . “
88339	88344	88336	88336	she	2490	” he asked apprehensively . “
88392	88393	88394	88394	She	2490	” “
88403	88414	88366	88366	she	2490	” Judith shrugged away his anticipations with a faint smile . “
88441	88442	88433	88433	she	195	” “
88452	88453	88433	88433	she	195	” “
88462	88463	88491	88491	mother	2490	” “
88519	88535	88507	88507	they	1849	” Judith scanned him half - humorously through the veil of her cigarette - smoke . “
88544	88545	88507	88507	they	1849	” “
88570	88571	88575	88575	she	2712	” “
88608	88617	88620	88620	she	2712	” Boyne was silent , and Judith added : “
88649	88728	88633	88633	she	2712	” The load dropped from Boyne ’s heart . If Mrs. Wheater was leaving for Paris without suggesting that the children should join her , it was at least a respite — how long a one he could n’t guess , but at any rate enough to provide an excuse for deferring action . That was as far as his hopes dared venture . But he met Judith ’s eyes , and was surprised at their untroubled serenity . “
88735	88744	88731	88731	you	1854	” he began ; and she rejoined immediately : “
88754	88814	88731	88731	you	1854	” Immediately the sense of his responsibility descended on him with a redoubled weight . To have taken the risks he had for these children was mad enough ; but to find that his doing so had deified him in their imagination , made them regard him as a sort of human sanctuary , turned his apprehensions to dismay . “
88856	88868	88852	88852	I	0	” She gave him all her confidence in a radiant look . “
88897	88917	88918	88918	I	0	” She paused , and then began again , with a shade of hesitation that was new in her : “
89076	89155	89156	89156	My	0	” The abruptness of Judith ’s transitions from embittered shrewdness to nursery simplicity was always disconcerting . When ways and means had to be considered , the disenchanted maiden for whom life seemed to have no surprises became once more the helpless little girl in the hands of nurses and governesses . At such moments , Boyne thought , she was like a young Daphne , half emerging into reality , half caught in the foliage of fairyland . “
89160	89199	89156	89156	My	0	” She always responded to every change in his intonation ; and as he spoke he saw the shadow in her eyes before it reached her lips . Trying to keep a smile on them , she interrupted : “
89208	89209	89201	89201	I	0	” “
89226	89242	89243	89243	Martin	193	” She sprang up , and moved toward him with one of her impulsive darts . “
89299	89300	89281	89281	you	193	” “
89336	89342	89324	89324	you	193	” She shook her head . “
89396	89410	89411	89411	grandma	1869	” Judith added , with a sudden spring back to her wistful maturity , “
89419	89420	89411	89411	grandma	1869	” “
89464	89465	89455	89456	your mother	2712	” “
89492	89512	89486	89490	a whole crowd of people	1876	” In spite of himself , Boyne again drew a breath of relief . If Wheater was off on the “
89515	89551	89564	89564	they	1878	” with a band of cronies , and his wife rushing to Paris to start divorce proceedings , there might indeed be no need for an immediate decision . Never had procrastination seemed so sweet . “
89587	89595	89564	89564	they	1878	” Judith responded with a joyful laugh . “
89618	89676	89678	89678	you	2807	” Again a little shiver of apprehension ran over Boyne ; but he dissembled it by joining in her laugh . The more precarious was the tie between himself and the little Wheaters , the more precious seemed the days he could still hope to spend with them ; he would not cloud another with vain fears . “
89711	89722	89707	89709	the little Wheaters	130	” She stood looking at him with her happiest eyes . “
89775	89776	89749	89749	he	198	” “
89783	89791	89792	89792	I	0	” he grinned ; and added sardonically : “
89814	89855	89858	89858	Martin	193	” She moved obediently toward the door , but stopped short halfway with an exclamation of surprise . Boyne , who was rummaging in a corner for his stick , turned about to see her standing before the ancient cradle . “
89869	89910	89911	89911	Jove	119	” A reproachful flush rose to her face , and was momentarily reflected in his own . Hang it — why was he always such an untidy fellow ? And why was a cradle so uncommonly handy to hold boots ? “
89923	89938	89919	89921	that confounded chambermaid	1881	” But he broke off in confusion as he caught Judith ’s incredulous eye . “
89958	89984	89947	89947	I’ve	1882	” he cried defiantly . Her face softened , and she met his banter with the wistful tentative gaze that he called her Monreale look . “
90005	90009	90002	90002	I	0	” she explained . “
90050	90096	90035	90035	Blanca	128	” Boyne was flinging the boots out of the cradle with an angry hand , and made no answer to this suggestion . Judith stood and watched him for a few moments ; then she went to his side and slipped her arm through his . “
90108	90112	90101	90101	I	0	” she exclaimed . “
90117	90126	90035	90035	Blanca	128	” He swung around on her , exasperated . “
90215	90216	90225	90225	you	0	” “
90232	90236	90225	90225	you	0	” she wailed . “
90292	90293	90318	90318	Martin	193	” “
90320	90326	90318	90318	Martin	193	” she flung out breathlessly , “
90343	90355	90327	90327	you	0	” Temptation suddenly twitched through him . It was as if saying “
90357	90425	90440	90440	I	0	” to her question might be the magic formula of freedom . After all , there lay the ring ; he _ was _ free , technically — had only to utter the words to make them true . But he thrust his hands into his pockets and stood sullenly planted before the corner of the table on which he had tossed the open ring - box . “
90431	90439	90440	90440	I	0	” he thought . Aloud he said : “
90460	90461	90440	90440	I	0	” “
90465	90469	90440	90440	I	0	” He nodded . “
90472	90577	90440	90440	I	0	” she sighed , relieved . It was evident that she identified herself whole - heartedly with his sentimental troubles , of whatever nature and by whomsoever they were caused . She was still looking up at him , her face full of compunction and perplexity , and suddenly he put his arm about her and bent his head to her lips . They looked round and glowing , as they did in laughter or emotion ; they drew his irresistibly . But he turned his head aside , and his kiss fell harmlessly on her cheek , near the tear - hung lashes . “
90601	90622	90594	90594	we	1892	” He saw that she was still trembling , and took her by the arm in the old brotherly way . “
90625	90629	90594	90594	we	1892	” he repeated , “
90635	90651	90594	90594	we	1892	” In the doorway she paused and flung a last tragic glance at the cradle . “
90676	90859	90669	90669	you	1891	” she sighed . XXVI To Boyne the calm of the next day brought no reassurance . Too many uncertainties hung close . After a night of pondering he had sent back the ring to Mrs. Sellars , with a brief line saying that she was of course free if she chose to be , but that he could not so regard himself till they had had a talk , and she had convinced him that she would be happier if their engagement ended . He knew that he was merely using an old formula , the accepted one in such cases , and he longed to get away from it , to be spontaneous , honest , himself . But as he wrote it became clear to him that he was terribly sorry for Rose Sellars , terribly sorry for having disappointed her ; and that such phrases — the kind he had been brought up on — were the devices of decent people who hated to give pain , and were even capable of self - sacrifice to avoid it . “
90872	90892	90669	90669	you	1891	” he thought ; and the thought softened the close of his letter , and impelled him to add : “
90912	91453	90908	90908	I	0	” This done , the whole problem vanished to the background of his mind . He was hardly aware that he was no longer thinking of it . His life of practical activities and swift decisions had given him the habit of easily dismissing matters once dealt with . He flattered himself that he could thus dispose of sentimental cares as easily as of professional problems ; and to a certain extent it was true . Behind the close - knit foreground of his daily life there had hung for years the mirage of Rose Sellars ; but that mirage was now the phantom of a phantom , and he averted his eyes lest he should find that it had faded into nothing . After Mrs. Wheater ’s letter to Judith there came no more alarms to the _ Pension Rosenglüh _ ; and the days slipped by in a security which seemed satisfying to Judith , and even to Miss Scope . But summer was waning in the high valleys of the Dolomites ; tourists were scattering , the big hotels preparing to close . By - and - by a cold sparkle began to fill the air in the early mornings , and at night the temperature fell to freezing . On the lower slopes the larches were turning to pale gold , and the bare cliffs burned with an intenser fire against a sky as hard as metal . The very magic of the hastening days warned Boyne that they could not last , and that the change in the landscape symbolized another , as imminent , in the fortunes of his party . Mrs. Sellars had written again — sweetly and reasonably — saying that she intended to remain for the present with Aunt Julia , who was settled in Paris for two or three months . If Boyne really wished for another talk , she added , she hoped he would be able to come before long ; but in any case he could count on her affectionate understanding . She closed her letter with a friendly message to the children . Boyne had been afraid that Judith would revert again to the subject of his private anxieties ; but she contrived , by a visible effort which made him feel for the first time that she was really growing up , to keep off the forbidden topic . His own return to a more equable mood no doubt helped her ; and so did the presence of the younger children and their preceptors . Boyne half unconsciously avoided being alone with Judith ; and the shortening days and freshening temperature curtailed their expeditions , and gave more time for games and romps around the cheerful stove in the children ’s dining - room . It was there that , one rainy afternoon , he found himself sitting with the younger children . Judith had gone with Miss Scope and Nanny to Toblach , to fit out the family with autumn underclothes , Terry was upstairs , working with his tutor , Chip asleep in Susan ’s care ; and Blanca , in the corner nearest the stove , was brooding over a torn copy of “
91456	91472	90908	90908	I	0	” with the passionate frown she always bent on the study of fashion - plates . “
91482	91486	90908	90908	I	0	” she said . “
91497	91520	91487	91487	I	0	” Zinnie lifted her head from the rapt contemplation of an electric engine which Bun was putting together under Boyne ’s directions . “
91539	91562	91563	91563	She	1898	” she remarked . Beechy , whose attention was also riveted on the motions of Bun ’s agile fingers , interrupted indignantly : “
91571	91572	91573	91574	The lady	503	” “
91579	91586	91576	91577	What lady	1903	” Boyne interposed , vaguely apprehensive . “
91595	91606	91607	91607	You	1904	” Blanca re - entered the conversation with a sniff . “
91725	91753	91719	91719	Chanel	256	” Blanca paused , reduced to silence by the hopelessness of the attempt to fit her words to her meaning . Boyne looked up from the engine . “
91771	91772	91762	91762	you	1904	” “
91780	91815	91777	91777	you—_you	1904	” cried Zinnie , executing a double handspring she had lately learned from Bun , to the despair of Beechy , who was so fat that she invariably collapsed midway of the same attempt . “
91823	91827	91816	91816	I	0	” Zinnie added , “
91834	91835	91836	91836	You	0	” “
91842	91876	91877	91877	Girls	1909	” cried Blanca , bounding from her seat . Bun , flat on his stomach , his legs in the air , his curls mixed with the engine , chanted over his shoulder : “
91886	91887	91877	91877	Girls	1909	” “
91894	91981	91888	91889	Nasty rotters	1910	” sympathised Beechy , always ready to champion her brother , and not as yet very clear as to her own sex . Zinnie ’s reprisals were checked by the discovery that the landlady ’s gold - fish aquarium , which usually stood in the larger and colder public dining - room , had been brought in and placed on a stand before the window . She tiptoed off to inspect this forbidden Paradise while Boyne got to his feet and picked up the electric wire . “
92002	92008	91996	91996	Bun	135	” He turned to Zinnie . “
92029	92030	92025	92025	she	1914	” “
92037	92061	92025	92025	she	1914	” ejaculated Blanca with a shrug . She turned to Boyne , drawing her lids together with her pretty cat - like smile . “
92080	92081	92073	92074	la dame	1916	” “
92096	92142	92144	92145	Mr. Boyne	145	” commented Zinnie , still watchfully circling about the aquarium . The door opened , and a maid came in with a card which she handed hesitatingly to Boyne . The name on it was : _ Princess Buondelmonte _ , and underneath was written : “
92153	92176	92144	92145	Mr. Boyne	145	” Boyne crammed the card into his pocket without speaking , conscious that the eyes of all the children were upon him . “
92192	92196	92199	92199	her	503	” Zinnie piped . “
92221	92236	92209	92209	She	503	” Blanca , at his side , had slid an insinuating hand in his . “
92287	92293	92285	92285	Judy	127	” Boyne checked her firmly . “
92318	92599	92310	92310	I’ll	0	” He thanked his stars that the lady had sent in her card instead of confiding her name to the maid . He could not imagine what his noble visitor wanted of him , but the very sight of the name had let loose all his fears . As he left the room he turned and sent a last glance toward the group sprawling around the engine , which had after all refused to start — orange curls mixed with brown and dusky , sunburnt legs kicking high , voices mixed in breathless controversy . How healthy and jolly they all looked ! And how good they smelt , with that mixed smell of woollen garments , and soap , and the fruity fragrance of young bodies tumbled about together . As Boyne looked back at them he thought how funny and dear they were , and how different the world might have been if Rose Sellars had freed herself when he and she were still young .... A lady with a slim straight back was standing in the sitting - room , attentively examining the stuffed eagle above the stove . She turned at Boyne ’s entrance and revealed a small oval face , somewhat pale , with excessively earnest gray eyes , and a well - modelled nose and brow . It puzzled him to discover why an assemblage of such agreeable features did not produce an effect of beauty ; but a second glance suggested that it was because their owner had never thought about being beautiful . That she had graver preoccupations was immediately evident from the tone of her slow and carefully - modulated speech . “
92603	92648	92600	92601	Mr. Boyne	145	” she asked , as though she feared he might deny his identity , and was immediately prepared , if he did , to disprove the denial ; and on his saying that he was , she continued , with a touch of nervousness : “
92662	92663	92664	92664	Your	145	” “
92668	92683	92687	92688	the Prince	549	” Boyne echoed in astonishment ; and she corrected herself with a slight blush . “
92716	92762	92704	92704	I	0	” Boyne pushed an armchair forward , and she sat down , crossing her feet neatly , and satisfying herself that the skirt which Zinnie described as long was so adjusted as not to reveal too much of the pretty legs above her slender ankles . “
92773	92787	92771	92771	Beatrice	150	” Boyne heard her with dismay , but kept up a brave exterior . “
92814	92826	92798	92799	Mrs. Wheater	120	” Princess Buondelmonte met this with a smile of faint incredulity . “
92864	92873	92845	92846	Mrs. Wheater	120	” She paused a moment , and added : “
92883	92884	92875	92875	I	0	” “
92889	92903	92887	92887	Princess	1936	” Boyne exclaimed . She raised her handsome eyebrows slightly , and said : “
92908	92909	92904	92904	You	1931	” “
92923	92924	92918	92918	I	0	” “
92946	92947	92929	92929	you	1931	” “
92953	92954	92929	92929	you	1931	” “
92963	92976	92977	92977	I	0	” She crimsoned suddenly , and then grew even paler than before . “
92987	93003	92981	92981	you	1931	” She broke off , and he saw that her eyes had filled with tears . “
93019	93064	93010	93010	I	0	” she added a little breathlessly , as though throwing herself on his mercy in a conflict she felt to be unequal if it should turn on Prince Buondelmonte ’s merits as a father . Boyne felt so sorry for her that he answered : “
93115	93116	93150	93151	Prince Buondelmonte	152	” “
93119	93123	93150	93151	Prince Buondelmonte	152	” she interrupted . “
93179	93192	93196	93196	they	1251	” She leaned forward , her grave almost terrified eyes on Boyne . “
93246	93328	93329	93329	I	0	” Boyne heard her with a growing wonder . She spoke slowly but fluently , not as if repeating a lesson learned by rote , but as though she were sustaining a thesis with the ease of a practised orator . There was something didactic — perhaps forensic , rather — in her glib command of her subject . He saw that she was trembling with nervousness , yet that her nerves would never control her ; and his heart sank . “
93340	93344	93332	93332	I	0	” he said , “
93419	93434	93437	93437	I	0	” Princess Buondelmonte listened attentively , her brows drawn together in a cautious frown . “
93488	93501	93502	93502	I	0	” she paused , and added with an air of modest dignity : “
93554	93587	93534	93535	my grandfather	1955	” She stopped again , glanced half proudly , half shyly at Boyne , as though to see how much this glimpse of her genealogy had impressed him , and then pursued : “
93663	93682	93683	93683	I	0	” No adequate answer occurred to Boyne , and she rose from her seat with an impatient gesture . “
93714	93715	93710	93711	Prince Buondelmonte	152	” “
93723	93727	93710	93711	Prince Buondelmonte	152	” Boyne exclaimed . “
93732	93733	93710	93711	Prince Buondelmonte	152	” “
93763	93767	93771	93772	Prince Buondelmonte	152	” She interrupted : “
93841	93857	93826	93826	He	152	” The Princess paused , and added , with a genuine tremor in her voice : “
93881	93995	93876	93876	she	120	” If the Princess ’s aim had been to reduce her interlocutor to silence , she had at last succeeded . Boyne sat speechless , wondering how much the granddaughter of Dr. Judson Tring believed of what she was saying , and to what extent her astounding version of the case was the result of patient schooling on her husband ’s part . He concluded that she was incapable of deliberate deception , and fully convinced of the truth of her assertions ; and he knew this would make it all the harder to reason with her . For a few moments the two faced each other without speaking ; then Boyne said : “
94037	94044	94024	94024	he	152	” The Princess again interrupted him . “
94133	94270	94271	94271	Princess	1936	” Boyne stood up impatiently . The talk was assuming more and more the tone of a legal debate ; conducted on such lines there seemed no reason for its ever ending . If one accepted the Princess ’s premises — and Boyne had no way of disproving them — it was difficult to question her conclusions . All he could do was to plead his lack of authority . He reminded his visitor that Mrs. Wheater , to whom , for whatever reason , their father had confided Bun and Beechy , had , in her turn , passed them over to their present guardians , who were therefore answerable to her , and her only . The Princess ’s lips parted nervously on the first syllable of a new protest ; but Boyne interrupted : “
94393	94401	94390	94390	you	0	” The Princess lifted an imperative hand . “
94474	94475	94471	94472	a child	435	” “
94478	94482	94471	94472	a child	435	” Boyne acquiesced ; “
94500	94501	94494	94494	you	145	” “
94509	94520	94505	94505	I	0	” she responded briskly . Her promptness took him aback . “
94526	94533	94523	94523	you	0	” She gave a smiling nod . “
94560	94567	94550	94550	you	145	” Her eyes became severe again . “
94591	94592	94550	94550	you	145	” “
94598	94649	94550	94550	you	145	” Boyne agreed . He was beginning to divine , under her hard mechanical manner , something young and untried , something one might still reach and appeal to ; and he reflected that the sight of the children would perhaps prove to be the simplest way of reaching it . “
94659	94663	94650	94651	The children	505	” he said . “
94685	94706	94675	94675	you	145	” The Princess said , yes , she thought she would like to see them all together at their games . “
94715	94722	94675	94675	you	145	” she explained with a smile . “
94781	94917	94918	94918	God	214	” He led her down the passage and threw open the door of the children ’s dining - room . On the threshold they were met by a burst of angry voices . Everything in the room was noise and confusion , and the opening of the door remained unheeded . In all his experience of the little Wheaters , Boyne had never before seen them engaged in so fierce a conflict : it seemed incredible that the participants should be only four . Some were screaming , some vituperating , some doing both , and butting at each other , head down , at the same time . The floor was strewn with the wreckage of battle , but the agitated movements of the combatants made the origin of the dispute hard to discover . “
94920	94936	94918	94918	God	214	” Boyne ejaculated , stepping back . Zinnie ’s voice rose furiously above the others . “
94967	94972	94975	94975	you	0	” Bun squealed back : “
94994	94995	94992	94992	you	0	” “
95042	95043	95034	95034	Beechy	154	” “
95064	95065	95053	95053	you	0	” “
95092	95093	95077	95077	Beechy	154	” “
95112	95116	95101	95101	Judy’d	259	” Beechy wailed . “
95129	95141	95142	95143	The Tatler	241	” roared Bun . Blanca , reluctantly torn from her study of “
95145	95200	95142	95143	The Tatler	241	” had risen from the stove - corner and was distributing slaps and shakes with a practised hand . As she turned to the door , and saw Boyne and his visitor on the threshold , her arms dropped to her sides , and she swept the shrieking children into a corner behind her . “
95233	95254	95228	95228	I	0	” She addressed herself to Boyne , but , as usual , it was the newcomer who fixed her attention . “
95261	95285	95286	95286	I	0	” she murmured with a deprecating glance . Princess Buondelmonte , pale and erect , stood in the doorway and returned her gaze . “
95295	95312	95286	95286	I	0	” she said coldly . She turned to Boyne , and continued in a trembling voice : “
95384	95395	95396	95396	I	0	” Still nervously , she addressed herself again to Blanca . “
95400	95404	95396	95396	I	0	” she said , “
95430	95441	95427	95427	I	0	” Blanca was looking at her with a captivated stare . “
95462	95463	95455	95455	you	0	” “
95472	95533	95466	95466	I	0	” the visitor assented , with a smile of girlish gratification which made her appear almost as young as Blanca . It was manifest that , however heavily the higher responsibilities weighed on her , she still enjoyed the sound of her new title . But Bun , brushing aside the little girls , had flung himself impetuously upon her . “
95572	95589	95550	95550	he	152	” The visitor stooped down , laying a timid yet resolute hand on his dark head . “
95640	95647	95659	95659	you	0	” Bun ’s face fell perceptibly . “
95678	95696	95667	95667	Beechy	154	” The Princess ’s lips narrowed with the same air of resolution which had informed her hand . “
95751	95752	95735	95736	your father’ll	2023	” “
95762	95768	95758	95758	I	0	” said Bun immovably . XXVII “
95780	95825	95758	95758	I	0	” Judith Wheater had pushed open the door , and stood there , small and pale , in her dripping mackintosh and bedraggled hat . She gave a little laugh , and her gray eyes measured the stranger with a deliberate and freezing scrutiny . “
95837	95841	95826	95826	I	0	” she said , “
95855	95873	95850	95850	you	0	” She glanced away to the ravaged scene , and the frightened excited faces of the children . “
95950	95958	95959	95959	I	0	” She turned to the bewildered visitor . “
95981	96009	96010	96010	Martin	193	” Her eye fell on Boyne , who had drawn back into the dusk of the passage , as if disclaiming any part in the impending drama . “
96012	96017	96020	96020	you	193	” she challenged him , “
96027	96028	96020	96020	you	193	” “
96037	96046	96035	96035	Judith	127	” Judith again scanned her with unrelenting eyes . “
96057	96110	96111	96111	Judith	127	” she said . The Princess stood drooping her high crest a little , as if unused to receiving instructions from one so much smaller and younger than herself . Boyne remembered how Judith had awed and baffled Mrs. Sellars on their first meeting , and his heart swelled with irrational hopes . “
96113	96122	96111	96111	Judith	127	” he cautioned her , below his breath . “
96135	96171	96133	96133	Martin	193	” She led them down the passage , and into the sitting - room . After she had closed the door she pushed forward a chair for the Princess Buondelmonte , and said with emphasis : “
96189	96217	96178	96179	Mr. Boyne	145	” The Princess did not seat herself . She leaned on the back of the chair , and smiled down at the champion of the little Wheaters . “
96236	96237	96238	96238	Me	0	” “
96240	96248	96238	96238	Me	0	” Judith ’s eyes widened in astonishment . “
96268	96317	96318	96318	I	0	” Something in her accent seemed to touch the Princess , who seated herself in the chair on which she had been leaning , made sure that her skirts did not expose more than a decent extent of ankle , and began to speak in a friendlier tone . “
96339	96345	96330	96330	you	193	” Judith paused a moment . “
96366	96375	96356	96356	I	0	” The Princess made a sign of comprehension . “
96390	96391	96356	96356	I	0	” “
96398	96412	96356	96356	I	0	” said Judith decisively . The other hesitated , and she pressed on : “
96429	96430	96427	96427	me	0	” “
96445	96446	96435	96435	you	193	” “
96457	96462	96466	96466	them	505	” Judith flashed back . “
96473	96478	96469	96469	I	0	” the Princess smiled . “
96642	96643	96665	96665	you	193	” “
96648	96657	96665	96665	you	193	” the Princess protested with her dry smile . “
96700	96707	96708	96708	I	0	” Judith gave a contemptuous shrug . “
96712	96716	96708	96708	I	0	” she said , “
96729	97470	96720	96720	you	193	” Was it victory or defeat ? Boyne and Judith sat late in the little sitting - room , asking themselves that , after the Princess Buondelmonte had gone . It had been Boyne ’s idea — and almost his only contribution to the fiery dialogue between the two — that the Princess should be invited to return in the evening and share the children ’s supper . The proposal , seconded by Judith after a swift glance at Boyne , seemed to surprise their visitor , and to disarm her growing hostility . The encounter with Judith had not tended to soften her feelings , and for a moment it looked as if things were taking a dangerous turn ; but Boyne had intervened with the suggestion that the Princess , having seen the children at their worst , should be given a chance to meet them in pleasanter circumstances . He added that he would be glad of another talk with her ; and as she did not leave till the next day , and was staying at an hotel near his own , he asked if he might walk back there with her , and fetch her down again for supper . She accepted both suggestions , and after a mollified farewell to Judith , started up the hill with Boyne . He saw that she was still inwardly agitated , and clutching desperately at what remained of her resolution ; and he put in a pacifying word in excuse of Judith ’s irritability , and assured the Princess that the Wheaters would make no difficulty in recognising the Prince ’s legal right to his children . The real question , he went on , was surely quite different ; was one of delicacy , of good taste , if you chose to call it so . Mrs. Wheater had taken in Beechy and Bun when their father was not able to ; she had given them the same advantages as her own children ( the Princess , at this , sounded an ironic murmur ) , and had shown them the same affection ; though all she had done , Boyne hastened to add , was as nothing to the patient unflagging devotion of their step - sister — who technically was n’t even a step - sister . On that theme Boyne did not have to choose his words . They poured out with a vehemence surprising even to himself . The Princess , he supposed — whatever her educational theories were — would agree that the first thing young children needed was to be loved enough ; above all , children exposed as they were in the Wheater world , where every new divorce and remarriage thrust them again into unfamiliar surroundings . Through all these changes , Boyne pointed out , Judith had clung to her little flock , loving them , and teaching them to love each other ; she had even inspired governesses and nurses with her own passionate fidelity , so that in a welter of change the group had remained together , protected and happy . If only , Boyne pleaded , they could be left as they were for a few years longer ; perhaps if they could it would be found , when they finally rejoined their respective families , that under Judith ’s care they had been better prepared for life than if their parents had insisted on separating them . The Princess listened attentively to his arguments , but said little in reply ; Boyne suspected that she had been taught not to commit herself unless she was on familiar ground , and apparently she was unfamiliar with the kind of plea he made . The sentiments he appealed to seemed to have a sort of romantic interest for her , as feudal ruins might have for an intelligent traveller ; but he saw that there were no words for them in her vocabulary . When they went back to the _ Pension Rosenglüh _ for supper the children , headed by Terry and Blanca , presented a picture of such roseate harmony that the Princess was evidently struck . To complete the impression , Chip , who was always brought down at this hour to say goodnight , walked in led by Nanny , placed a confiding palm in the strange lady ’s , said “
97473	97487	97488	97490	ike Oody’s”—for Chip	123	” and wound his fingers in her hair , which he pronounced to be “
97489	97720	97721	97721	We	2046	Oody’s”—for Chip was beginning to generalise and to co - ordinate , though his educators could not have put a name to the process , any more than the Princess could to the instinctive motions of the heart . Supper , on the whole , was a success . The children were unusually well - behaved ; even Zinnie subdued herself to the prevailing tone . Bun and Beechy , seated one on each side of their new step - mother , and visibly awed by her proximity , demeaned themselves with a restraint which the Princess made several timid attempts to break down . It was evident that what she had said about the prohibition of fire - arms still rankled in Bun , and both children were prim and non - committal , as they always were — to a degree unknown to the others — once their distrust was aroused . The Princess , to conceal her embarrassment , discoursed volubly about the historic interest of the ancestral palace which her husband had succeeded in repurchasing , and promised Bun that one of its spacious apartments should be fitted up as a modern playroom , in which he would learn to replace his artless antics by the newest feats in scientific gymnastics . Bun ’s eyes glittered ; but after a reflective silence he shook his head . “
97725	97729	97721	97721	We	2046	” he said , “
97757	97776	97777	97777	We	2046	” This solemn self - reminder caused Beechy ’s eyes to fill , and Zinnie to cry out : “
97789	97795	97784	97784	villains	2047	” The Princess looked distressed . “
97807	97826	97798	97798	you	2048	” she asked , pronouncing the words as if they were explosives and must be handled with caution . “
97833	97844	97827	97827	I	0	” Bun explained , with an effort at greater accuracy . “
97862	97881	97846	97846	I	0	” his step - mother continued , turning with a reproachful smile to Zinnie , who promptly rejoined : “
97893	97921	97846	97846	I	0	” ; which caused the Princess to blush and lower her grave eyes . To hide her constraint she addressed a question to the company in general . “
97944	97973	97846	97846	I	0	” None of the younger children could pronounce the name of the book , and they therefore preserved a respectful silence ; but Terry interrupted with a laugh : “
97999	98009	98010	98010	I	0	” The Princess received this with a dubious frown . “
98033	98055	98057	98057	me	0	” Miss Scope sat rigid and majestic at the opposite table - end . Thus directly challenged , she replied reassuringly : “
98085	98086	98082	98083	my grandmother	2059	” “
98105	98111	98082	98083	my grandmother	2059	” Miss Scope smiled undauntedly . “
98169	98180	98183	98183	your	0	” This gave her interlocutor ’s dismay a new turn . “
98198	98237	98186	98186	You	0	” Miss Scope replied with undisguised pride that that was what she did mean ; and the Princess laid down her fork with the air of one about to spring up and do battle against such deplorable abuses . “
98242	98256	98258	98258	I	0	” she began ; then broke off to add in a lower tone : “
98265	98296	98258	98258	I	0	” her glance at Miss Scope ’s white head seemed to say that the whole business was an old unhappy far - off thing , and she resumed more hopefully : “
98310	98362	98363	98363	You	2069	” She met Miss Scope ’s horrified stare , and glanced nervously about the table , as if realising that the subject , even at Lohengrin , might hardly be considered suitable for juvenile ears . To relieve her embarrassment she leaned across Bun and addressed herself once more to Zinnie . “
98392	98412	98382	98382	I	0	” she said , in an affable attempt to change the conversation . Zinnie ’s face sparkled with curiosity . “
98432	98433	98424	98424	she	2712	” “
98438	98452	98424	98424	she	2712	” The Princess hesitated , with a puzzled look , and Judith intervened : “
98461	98462	98453	98453	Zinnie	133	” “
98472	98485	98453	98453	Zinnie	133	” Zinnie insidiously put in , addressing the Princess ; and added : “
98501	98502	98503	98503	Zinnie	133	” “
98505	98518	98503	98503	Zinnie	133	” came reprovingly from Miss Scope . The Princess shook her head . “
98574	98602	98557	98557	she	3270	” Zinnie grew scarlet with excitement and gratification ; such notice lifted her at once above the other children . But an afterthought soon damped her pride . “
98621	98626	98613	98613	she	3270	” she objected doubtfully . “
98659	98665	98667	98668	your mother	2712	” continued the Princess illogically , “
98687	98697	98707	98707	She	3270	” This seemed to plunge Zinnie into fresh perplexity . “
98730	98731	98723	98723	you	2069	” “
98738	98743	98732	98732	You	2069	” said the Princess . “
98746	98751	98752	98752	I	0	” Zinnie corrected herself . “
98760	98765	98752	98752	I	0	” the Princess explained . “
98772	98776	98767	98767	we	2079	” said Zinnie , “
98801	98802	98796	98796	you	0	” “
98831	98847	98820	98820	she	3270	” The Princess again leaned over , and laid a persuasive hand on Zinnie ’s . “
98873	98964	98850	98850	you	0	” There was a pause of suspense . Boyne signed to Judith to keep silent , and the children , taking the cue , remained with spoons above their pudding , and eyes agape , while this perfidious proposal was submitted . Zinnie , from crimson , had grown almost pale ; the orange spirals of her bushy head seemed to droop with her drooping lips . Her head sank on her neck , and she twisted about in its crease of plumpness the necklace her mother had given her . “
98976	98983	98850	98850	you	0	” she questioned back with caution . “
99046	99101	99034	99034	I	0	” Zinnie hung her head still lower . If it had been possible for a Wheater child to be shy , she would have appeared so ; but in reality she was only struggling with a problem beyond her powers . At last she raised her head , and looked firmly at the Princess . “
99111	99155	99034	99034	I	0	” she said . Boyne burst out laughing , and the Princess nervously joined him , perhaps to cover the appearance of defeat . Having so obviously failed to inspire the children with confidence , she once more addressed herself to Miss Scope . “
99186	99187	99173	99173	you	2085	” “
99191	99230	99231	99231	I	0	” Miss Scope gave an incredulous gasp , and her charges , evidently struck by the question , again remained with suspended spoons , and eyes eagerly fixed on the Princess . Miss Scope gave a curt laugh . “
99261	99277	99245	99245	you	2085	” she said drily . This seemed to cause the Princess more disappointment than surprise . “
99347	99359	99338	99338	We	2086	” She turned with a smile to her step - son . “
99384	99405	99372	99372	I	0	” Bun received this unsmilingly , and Beechy burst into passionate weeping and flung her arms jealously about her brother . “
99436	99453	99419	99419	You	2089	” she added in a final wail , her desperate eyes entreating her step - mother . “
99464	99512	99459	99459	I	0	” the Princess murmured ; and Judith hurriedly explained that Blanca had been operated upon for appendicitis the previous year , and that the use of the word in connection with her illness had had an intimidating effect on the younger children , and especially on Beechy . “
99522	99665	99459	99459	I	0	” the Princess said with a baffled sigh . No one found an answer , and supper being over , Judith proposed that they should return to the sitting - room . The children followed , marshalled by Miss Scope , and the Princess again tried to engage them in talk ; but she could not break down the barrier of mistrust which had been set up . Finally she suggested that they should all play a game together — a quiet writing game she thought would be interesting . A table was cleared , and paper and pencils found with some difficulty , and distributed among the children , the youngest of whom were lifted up onto sofa - cushions to make their seats high enough for collaboration . The Princess explained that the game they were going to play was called “
99668	99911	99459	99459	I	0	” and that it had been introduced into the Vocational Department of Juvenile Psychology at Lohengrin in order to direct children ’s minds as early as possible to the choice of a career . First of all , she continued , each was to write down what he or she would most like to be or to do ; then they were to fold the papers , and Mr. Boyne was to shake them up in his hat , and read them out in turn , and as he read the children were to try to guess who had made each choice . The game did not start with as much _ élan _ as its organiser had perhaps hoped . The children were still oppressed by her presence , and all of them but Terry hated writing , and were unused to abstract speculations on the future ; moreover , they probably felt that if they were to state with sincerity what they wanted to be their aspirations would be received with the friendly ridicule which grown ups manifest when children express their real views . All this made for delay and hesitation , and it was only Terry ’s persuasion , and the fear of disobeying the tall authoritative lady who had suddenly invaded their lives , which finally set their pencils going . Boyne received the papers , shook them up conscientiously , and began to read them out . “
99926	99945	99946	99947	An Ambassadoress”—Blanca	4022	” Zinnie ’s burning blush revealed her as the author of this ambition , and Boyne read on : “
99947	99964	99965	99967	A great Poet	2093	Ambassadoress”—Blanca , of course ; and the added vowel certainly gave the word a new stateliness . “
99977	99999	99965	99967	A great Poet	2093	” in Terry ’s concise hand , showed him torn between a first plunge into Conan Doyle , and rapturous communion with “
100007	100012	99965	99967	A great Poet	2093	” Boyne read on : “
100018	100025	100026	100028	A Crow Bat”—an	261	” laboriously printed out by Beechy ; “
100028	100037	100038	100044	A noble character ” ( bless Scopy	4023	Bat”—an aspiration obviously to be ascribed to Bun : “
100041	100065	100066	100067	An exploarer	2096	” ( bless Scopy ! As if she was n’t one already — ) ; and lastly , in Judith ’s rambling script : “
100069	100309	100066	100067	An exploarer	2096	” At the reading of that , something darted through Boyne like a whirr of wings . The ambitions expressed did not long serve to disguise the choosers , and there was a prompt chorus of attributions as Boyne read out one slip after the other . The Princess had apparently hoped that something more striking would result . She said the game usually promoted discussion , and she hoped the next stage in it would lead to freer self - expression . The children , she explained , were now to say in turn why — that is , on what grounds — they wanted to be this or that . But an awestruck silence met her invitation to debate , and Beechy again began to show signs of emotion . The Princess seemed much distressed , but was assured by Miss Scope that this breach of manners was due only to over - excitement , and the strain of sitting up later than usual — she hoped the Princess would excuse her , but really the children had better go to bed . At this suggestion all the faces round the table lit up except Zinnie ’s , which was clouded by a pout . She slipped down from her cushions with the others , but when her turn came to file by the Princess for goodnight , she held up the march - past to ask : “
100321	100488	100490	100490	you	2097	” She was swept off in Miss Scope ’s clutch , and the Princess , after a timid attempt at endearment , imperfectly responded to , when Bun and Beechy took leave , sat down for a talk with Boyne and Judith . Much as she had evidently seen to disapprove of in the bringing - up of the little Wheaters she was in a less aggressive mood than in the afternoon ; something she had been unprepared for , and had only half understood , in the relation of the children to each other and to their elders , seemed imperceptibly to have shaken her convictions . Though she continued to repeat the same phrases , it was with less emphasis ; and she listened more patiently to Boyne ’s arguments , and to Judith ’s entreaties . Judith was presently called away to say goodnight to the children , and as soon as the Princess and Boyne were alone , the former began abruptly : “
100542	100554	100573	100573	his	2839	” She coloured at the avowal , and went on hastily : “
100598	100632	100633	100633	I	0	” Her voice broke , and Boyne suddenly felt the same pity for her as when she had shown her fear that he might be hinting a criticism of Prince Buondelmonte ’s past . “
100644	100714	100642	100642	me	0	” he stammered . Judith came back , and the Princess , still a little rigid from the effort at self - control , began at once to thank her for her kindness , and to say that she was afraid it was time to go . She would tell Prince Buondelmonte , she added , with an effort at cordiality , that the children seemed very well ( _ “
100719	101154	100642	100642	me	0	” she explained ) , and she would give him the assurance — she hoped she might?—that some sort of understanding as to their future would soon be reached . Victory or defeat ? Judith and Boyne , sitting late , asked each other which it was , but found no answer . XXVIII All the next day the rain continued . It was one of those steady business - like rains which seem , in mountain places , not so much a caprice of the weather as the drop - curtain punctually let down by Nature between one season and the next . Behind its closely woven screen one had the sense of some tremendous annual scene - shifting , the upheaval and overturning of everything in sight , from the clouds bursting in snow on the cliff - tops to the mattresses and blankets being beaten and aired in the hotel windows . These images were doubtless born of Boyne ’s own mood . When he opened his shutters on the morning after the Princess Buondelmonte ’s apparition it seemed to him as if she herself had hung that cold gray mist before the window . He was afraid of everything now — of what the post might bring , of what his own common - sense might dictate to him , above all , of seeing Judith again , and having his apprehensions doubled by hers . The worst of it was that , even should all their tormentors agree to leave them in peace , they could not — more particularly on Terry ’s account — delay on that height through the coming weeks of storm and rain . Moreover , all the hotels and _ pensions _ , which would reopen later for the season of winter sports , were preparing to close for their yearly cleaning and renovating . After the middle of October there would be no demand for accommodation till the arrival of the Christmas lugers and ski - ers . If it proved possible to keep the little Wheaters together any longer the best plan would probably be to transport them to Riva or Meran till winter and fine weather were established together in the mountains . Boyne turned over these things with the nervous minuteness with which one makes plans for some one who is dying , and will never survive to see them carried out . It seemed to give him faith in the future , a sense of factitious security , as it sometimes does , beside a deathbed , to think : “
101170	101425	101162	101163	the doctor	1137	” Judith and Miss Scope shared his idea about Meran or Riva , and for some time had been talking vaguely of going down to look for rooms . But the ever - recurring difficulty of persuading a boarding - house keeper to lodge seven children made them decide that it would be best to try to hire an inexpensive villa . The episode of the gold - fish and the rabbit had not endeared them to their present landlady , and they felt the hopelessness of trying to ingratiate themselves with another , in a place where they were unknown , and where the autumn season would be at its height . It had therefore been decided that Judith , Miss Scope and Boyne should motor to Meran that very week to look over the ground . But on reflection Boyne hesitated to leave the children alone with their nurses , even for so short an absence . With Joyce in Paris , once more reorganising her life , and the Princess Buondelmonte returning to Rome unsatisfied , danger threatened on all sides . Any one of these cross - blasts might dash to earth the frail nest which had resisted the summer ’s breezes ; and Boyne , heavy - hearted , set out to call another council at the _ Pension Rosenglüh _ . As he left the hotel a telegram was handed to him . He glanced first at the signature — Sarah Mervin — then read what went before . “
101451	101453	101454	101455	A lawyer	2105	” .... “
101459	101467	101454	101455	A lawyer	2105	” Boyne growled as he pocketed it . “
101480	101501	101502	101503	These people	3398	” Fresh bitterness filled him as he saw one more prop withdrawn from under the crazy structure of his hopes . “
101505	101509	101502	101503	These people	3398	” he reflected , “
101536	101635	101636	101636	I	0	” But in his heart he was not much surprised . Mrs. Mervin was no longer young , and it is natural for ageing people to shrink from responsibilities . Besides , she might well plead that it was no business of hers to take in children she had never seen , and whose parents were eager , and financially able , to care for them . On second thoughts , it really did not need Judith ’s bald hint as to the allowance her grandmother received from Cliffe Wheater to account for the poor lady ’s attitude . “
101647	101862	101636	101636	I	0	” the impartial Boyne was obliged to admit in the course of his interminable argument with the other , the passionate and unreasonable one . What a Utopia he and Judith had been dreaming ! He wondered now how he could have lent himself to such pure folly .... Well , the dream was over , and his was the grim business of making her see it .... Heavily he went down the hill through the rain . At the _ pension _ Judith was watching for him from the window . She opened the door and led him into the sitting - room , where a sulky fire smouldered , puffing out acrid smoke . The landlady said it was always like that — the stove always smoked on the first day of the autumn rains , unless there was a little wind to make a draught . And there was not a breath today ; the only way was to leave a window open , Judith explained as she turned to Boyne . Her face was colourless and anxious ; he could see that she had been treading the wheel of the same problems as himself . The sight made him resolve to try and hide his own apprehensions a little longer . “
101884	101885	101865	101866	old Judy	127	” “
101895	101899	101892	101893	the Princess	3874	” He nodded . “
101910	101931	101902	101902	her	127	” Her eyes brightened , as they always did at his challenge ; but it was only a passing animation . “
101940	101950	101951	101951	I	0	” she questioned . The question took him unprepared . “
101958	101959	101956	101956	you	0	” “
101967	102144	101963	101963	mother	2490	” She produced the paper and thrust it feverishly into his hand . Boyne ’s anger rose — evidently ; he thought , old Mrs. Mervin had waited to communicate with her daughter before answering him . What cowardice , what treachery ! He pictured all these grown up powers and principalities leagued together against the handful of babes he commanded , and the bitterness of surrender entered into him . It was not that any of these parents really wanted their children . If they had , the break up of Judith ’s dream , though tragic , would have been too natural to struggle against . But it was simply that the poor little things had become a bone of contention , that the taking or keeping possession of them was a matter of pride or of expediency , like fighting for a goal in some exciting game , or clinging to all one ’s points in an acrimoniously - disputed law - suit . Boyne unfolded Mrs. Wheater ’s telegram , and read : “
102170	102257	102168	102168	Mother	195	” The vague phrasing made it impossible to guess whether the message were the result of a cable from Mrs. Mervin , or simply embodied a new whim of Joyce ’s . Boyne , on the whole , inclined to the latter view , and felt half ready to exonerate Mrs. Mervin . After all , perhaps she had kept faith with him , and her message was only the result of her own scruples . He tossed the telegram onto the table with a shrug . “
102268	102349	102350	102351	salaried assistants	1951	” Yes ; it appeared she had . Nanny , the day before , had received a letter from Mrs. Wheater ’s maid Marguerite , an experienced person who wielded a facile but rambling pen . This letter Judith had coaxed from Nanny , unknown to Miss Scope ; for Miss Scope , even in the extremest emergencies , would not admit the possibility of her charges using , as a means of information , what the Princess would have called “
102353	102409	102350	102351	salaried assistants	1951	” Marguerite ’s news , if vague , was ample . It appeared that Mrs. Wheater had met in Venice a gentleman a good deal older than herself , whose name the maid could not even approximately spell , but who was quite different from any of the other gentlemen in her mistress ’s circle . “
102415	102416	102417	102417	She	2115	” “
102428	102432	102417	102417	She	2115	” Judith explained . “
102444	102445	102436	102436	her	2115	” “
102467	102534	102457	102457	she	2115	” Judith went into this with the lucid impartiality she always applied to the analysis of her parents ’ foibles . She reminded Boyne that Joyce never stuck long to one thing , and that she had decided to marry Gerald chiefly in order to annoy her husband , and to have an excuse for detaining the young tutor at the Lido when the children left . “
102545	102549	102542	102542	Gerald	175	” Judith commented , “
102569	102603	102566	102566	you	2121	” But , after all , she pursued , her mother had much more sense than her poor father , who was always the prey of women like Zinnia Lacrosse or Sybil Lullmer . “
102799	102800	102776	102776	he	2130	” “
102814	102828	102776	102776	he	2130	” Boyne groaned . Judith made no answer , and he went on : “
102842	102843	102839	102840	the Princess	3874	” “
102853	102880	102851	102851	grandma	1869	” Judith rejoined , half hopefully . Boyne hesitated a moment ; then he said to himself that there was no use in any farther postponement . “
102889	102900	102901	102901	You	0	” he said . Judith ’s eyes were again illuminated . “
102936	102997	102998	102998	Judy	127	” Silently — for no words came to him — he gave her the cable , and walked away to the window to be out of sight of her face . For a while he stood watching the gray curtain of failure that hung there between him and his golden weeks ; then he pulled himself together and turned back . “
103000	103007	102998	102998	Judy	127	” She handed him the cable . “
103019	103026	103017	103017	you	127	” he said . She nodded . “
103037	103046	103017	103017	you	127	” he continued , in an unconvinced voice , “
103055	103078	103079	103079	Martin	193	” She pondered on this for a few moments without answering . Then , with one of her sudden changes of tone : “
103081	103087	103091	103091	she	127	” she broke out impetuously , “
103153	103175	103183	103183	she	127	” Every line of her face , from lifted eyebrows to parted lips , was a passionate demand for his assent . “
103279	103301	103268	103268	she	127	” she paused , and her eyes looked as the rain did when the sun was trying to break through it . “
103307	103312	103268	103268	she	127	” she began again , “
103523	103650	103651	103651	Judy	127	” Once again her grown up cares had vanished in the childish pride of recounting Chip ’s achievements . Would it always be like this , Boyne wondered , or would life gradually close the gates of the fairyland which was still so close to her ? He would have given most of his chances of happiness to help her keep open that communication with her childhood . And what if he were the one being who could do it ? The question wound itself through his thoughts like a persuasive hand insinuating itself into his . This heart - break of separation that was upon her — what if he alone had the power to ease it ? He stood looking down at her perplexedly . “
103677	103678	103709	103709	you	0	” “
103683	103705	103709	103709	you	0	” she palpitated . But under his gaze her radiance gradually faded , and her lips began to tremble a little . “
103721	103722	103709	103709	you	0	” “
103737	103738	103734	103735	your mother	2712	” “
103753	103754	103749	103749	I	0	” “
103759	103793	103758	103758	dear—.	2163	” He sat down , and drew her to the sofa beside him , speaking as he might have to a child on a holiday who was fighting the summons back to school . “
103826	103856	103865	103865	she	2168	” How dry and flat his phrases sounded , compared with the words he longed to say to her ! She drew back into the corner of the sofa . “
103876	103903	103873	103873	she	2168	” She was grown up again now , measuring him with angry suspicious eyes , and flinging out her accusations in her mother ’s shrillest voice . “
103922	103923	103924	103924	I	0	” “
103954	103955	103956	103956	I	0	” “
103978	104145	103970	103972	the Princess Buondelmonte	257	” She made no answer , and they sat in silence in their respective corners of the sofa , each gazing desperately into a future of which nothing could be divined except that it was the end of their hopes . Suddenly Judith flung herself face down against the knobby cushions and broke into weeping . Boyne , for a few minutes , remained numb and helpless ; then he moved closer , and bending over drew her into his arms . She seemed hardly aware of his nearness ; she simply went on crying , with hard uneven sobs , pressing her face against his shoulder as if it were the sofa - cushion . He held her in silence , not venturing to speak , or even to brush back her tumbled hair , while he pictured , with the acuity of his older and less articulate grief , what must be passing before her as the fibres of her heart were torn away . “
104157	104299	104300	104300	Judy—.	264	” he thought , wincing at the ugly details which must enter into her vision of the future , details he could only guess at , while she saw them with all the precision of experience . Yes , it was too cruel ; but what could he or she do ? He continued to hold her in silence , listening to the beat of the rain on the half - open window , and smelling the cold grave - yard smell of the autumn earth , while her sobs ran through him in shocks of anguish . Gradually her weeping subsided , and Boyne took courage to lift his hand and pass it once or twice over her hair . She lay in his hold as quietly as a frightened bird , and presently he bent his head and whispered : “
104301	104384	104385	104385	Judy	127	” Why not ? he thought ; his heart was beating with reckless bounds . He was free , after all , if it came to that ; free to chuck his life away on any madness ; and madness this was , he knew . Well , he ’d had enough of reason for the rest of his days ; and a man is only as old as he feels .... He bent so close that his lips brushed her ear . “
104398	104414	104385	104385	Judy	127	” In a flash she was out of his arms , and ecstatically facing him . “
104426	104535	104536	104536	Judith	127	” Ah , how hard her questions were to answer ! Boyne drew her down again beside him . Crying was a laborious and disfiguring business to her , and her face was so drawn and tear - stained that she looked almost old ; but its misery was shot through with hope . If he could have kept her there , not speaking , only answering her with endearments , how easy , how exquisite it would have been ! But her face was tense with expectation , and he had to find words , for he knew that his silence would have no meaning for her . “
104538	104546	104536	104536	Judith	127	” he began ; but she interrupted : “
104561	104579	104580	104580	Martin	193	” He made no answer , and she flung herself against him with a cry of alarm . “
104593	104607	104584	104584	You	193	” He held her hands , but his own had begun to tremble . “
104658	104674	104677	104677	Martin	193	” He broke off , his voice failing before the sudden sunrise in her eyes . “
104679	104700	104677	104677	Martin	193	” She lifted his hands one by one to her wet cheeks , and held them there in silent bliss . “
104712	104713	104709	104710	Mrs. Sellars	163	” “
104734	104744	104745	104745	My	0	” Her eyes still bathed him in their radiance . “
104751	104794	104745	104745	My	0	” She leaned close as she said it , and he dared not move , in his new awe of her nearness — so subtly had she changed from the child of his familiar endearments to the woman he passionately longed for .... “
104797	104816	104795	104795	Darling	3107	” she said again ; then , with a face in which the bridal light seemed already kindled , “
104844	105037	104822	104822	you	193	” XXIX Boyne felt like a man who has blundered along in the dark to the edge of a precipice . He trembled inwardly with the effort of recovery , and the shock of finding himself flung back into his old world . Judith , in a rush of gratitude , had thrown her arms about him ; and he shrank from her touch , from the warm smell of her hair , from everything about her which he had to think back into terms of childhood and comradeship , while every vein in his body still ached for her . There was nothing he would have dreaded as much as her detecting the least trace of what he was feeling . His first care must be to hide the break in their perfect communion — the fact that for a moment she had been for him the woman she would some day be for another man , in a future he could never share . He undid her hands and walked away to the window . When he turned to her again he had struggled back to some sort of composure . “
105057	105067	105044	105044	you	2459	” He tried to smile as he said it . “
105143	105161	105137	105137	I	0	” He broke off , reading in her unsatisfied eyes the hopelessness of piling up vague assurances .... “
105164	105186	105137	105137	I	0	” she assented , in a voice grown as small and colourless as her face . He stood before her miserably . “
105197	105198	105195	105195	you	2459	” “
105204	105208	105199	105199	I	0	” She hesitated . “
105218	105297	105215	105215	I	0	” His nerves began to twitch again . Could he bear to go into the question with her once more — and what would be the use if he did ? The immediate future must somehow or other be dealt with ; but the last few minutes had deprived him of all will and energy . He had the desolate sense of her knowing that he had failed her , and yet not being able to guess why . “
105307	105329	105300	105300	I	0	” he repeated . She remained silent , constrained by his constraint ; and he saw the disappointment in her eyes . “
105336	105344	105330	105330	You	0	” Still she looked at him perplexedly . “
105380	105473	105377	105377	you	0	” His senseless irritation grew upon him . Could such total simplicity be unfeigned ? Could she have such a power of awaking passion without any inkling of its meaning ? He hated himself for doubting it . In time — a short time , perhaps — her rich nature would come to its ripeness ; but as yet the only full - grown faculties in it were her love for her brothers and sisters , and her faith in the few people who had shown her kindness in a world unkindly . “
105478	105492	105474	105474	I	0	” she continued , after pausing for an answer which did not come . “
105502	105509	105510	105510	You	0	” Boyne gave a nervous laugh . “
105516	105517	105510	105510	You	0	” “
105530	105726	105520	105520	you	0	” He stood motionless , his hands in his pockets , staring down at the knots in the wooden floor , as he had stared at them on the day when she had owned to having taken her father ’s money — but in a mental perturbation how much deeper ! A few minutes before , it had seemed like profanation to brush her with the thought of his love ; now , faced by her despair , by her sense of being left alone to fight her battles , he asked himself whether it might not be fairer , even kinder , to speak . At the thought his heart again began to beat excitedly . Perhaps he had been too impetuous , too inarticulate . What if , after all , a word from him could wake the sleeping music ? The difficulty was to find a beginning . What would have been so simple if kisses could have told it , seemed tortuous or brutal when put in words . He shrank not so much from the possibility of hurting her as from the sudden fear of her hurting him beyond endurance . “
105729	105733	105520	105520	you	0	” he began , “
105739	105740	105737	105737	you	127	” “
105757	105768	105741	105741	I	0	” she said , with an obvious effort at truthfulness . “
105781	105801	105811	105811	I	0	” he laughed . She continued to fix her bewildered eyes on him , as if seeking a clue . “
105813	105818	105811	105811	I	0	” she added hopefully . “
105834	105875	105830	105830	you	0	” He remembered then that she had spoken to him with perfect simplicity of Gerald Ormerod ’s desire to marry her , as of the most natural thing in the world ; and his own scruples began to seem absurd . “
105888	105907	105884	105884	she	0	” he thought with a touch of self - derision . He cleared his throat , and continued : “
105923	105959	105912	105912	I	0	” The word was out now ; it went sounding on and on inside of his head while he awaited her answer . When she spoke it was with an air of indifference and disappointment . “
105982	106014	106015	106015	You	0	” It was clear that she regarded the subject as irrelevant ; her tone seemed to remind him that he and she had long since dealt with and disposed of it . “
106028	106036	106015	106015	You	0	” she grumbled . He pressed on : “
106047	106057	106043	106043	you	0	” He had to pause to steady his voice . “
106077	106078	106082	106082	me	0	” “
106084	106092	106082	106082	me	0	” At the word her listlessness vanished . “
106131	106132	106133	106133	I	0	” “
106154	106161	106148	106148	you	0	” He cleared his throat again . “
106182	106183	106174	106175	a fellow	2420	” “
106188	106193	106195	106195	I	0	” He laughed again . “
106198	106243	106195	106195	I	0	” For a moment she looked at him perplexedly ; then her eyes cleared , and for the first time she joined in his laugh . Hers seemed to bubble up , fresh and limpid , from the very depths of her little girlhood . “
106251	106261	106195	106195	I	0	” she said . There was a bottomless silence . “
106267	106298	106195	106195	I	0	” Boyne grinned . He stared at her without speaking ; then , like a blind man feeling his way , he picked up his hat and mackintosh , said : “
106308	106333	106195	106195	I	0	” and walked out stiffly into the passage . On the doorstep , still aware of her nearness , he added a little dizzily : “
106363	106745	106195	106195	I	0	” He felt her little disconsolate figure standing alone behind him in the rain , and hurried away as if to put himself out of its reach forever . XXX It was still raining when the Wheater colony left Cortina ; it was raining when the train in which Boyne and Judith were travelling reached Paris . During the days intervening between the receipt of Mrs. Wheater ’s telegram and the clattering halt of the express in the gare de Lyon , Boyne could not remember that the rain had ever stopped . But he had not had time to do much remembering — not even of the havoc within himself . After the struggle necessary to convince Judith that she must go to Paris and take Chip with her — since disobedience to her mother ’s summons might put them irretrievably in the wrong — he had first had to help her decide what should be done with the other children . Once brought round to his view , she had immediately risen to the emergency , as she always did when practical matters were at stake . She and Boyne were agreed that it would be imprudent to leave the children at Cortina , where the Princess , or even Lady Wrench , might take advantage of their absence to effect a raid on the _ pension _ . It took a three days ’ hunt to find a villa in a remote suburb of Riva where they could be temporarily installed without much risk of being run down by an outraged parent . Boyne put the _ Rosenglüh _ landlady off the scent by giving her the address of Mrs. Wheater ’s Paris banker , and letting it be understood that Judith was off to Paris to prepare for the children ’s arrival ; and Blanca and Terry , still deep in Conan Doyle , gleefully contributed misleading details . The excitement of departure , and the business of establishing the little Wheaters in their new quarters , left no time , between Boyne and Judith , for less pressing questions ; and Boyne saw that , once their plan was settled , Judith was almost as much amused as the twins by its secret and adventurous side . “
106761	107210	106749	106751	a Dr. Watson	266	” she chuckled , as she and Boyne , with Chip and Susan , scrambled into the Paris express at Verona . It was not till they were in the train that Boyne saw the cloud of apprehension descend on her again . But then fatigue intervened , and she fell asleep against his shoulder as peacefully as Chip , who was curled up opposite with his head in Susan ’s lap . As they sat there , Boyne remembered how , on the day of Mr. Dobree ’s picnic , he had watched her sleeping by the waterfall , a red glow in her cheeks , velvet shadows under her lashes . Now her face was pinched and sallow , the lids were swollen with goodbye tears ; she seemed farther from him than she had ever been , yet more in need of him ; and at the thought something new and tranquillizing entered into him . He had caught a glimpse of a joy he would never reach , and he knew that his eyes would always dazzle with it ; but the obligation of giving Judith the help she needed kept his pain in that deep part of the soul where the great renunciations lie . In Paris he left his companions at the door of the _ Nouveau Luxe _ , where Mrs. Wheater was established , drove to his own modest hotel on the left bank , and turned in for a hard tussle of thinking . He could no longer put off dealing with his own case , for Mrs. Sellars was still in Paris . He had not meant to let her know of his arrival till the next day ; he needed the interval to get the fatigue and confusion out of his brain . But meanwhile he must map out some kind of a working plan ; must clear up his own mind , and consider how to make it clear to her . And after an unprofitable attempt at rest and sleep , and a weary tramp in the rain through the dusky glittering streets , he suddenly decided on immediate action , and turned into a telephone booth to call up Mrs. Sellars . She was at home and answered immediately . Aunt Julia was resting , she said ; if he would come at once they could talk without fear of interruption . He caught the tremor of joy in her voice when he spoke her name — but how like her , how perfect of her , to ask no questions , to waste no time in exclamations ; just quietly and simply to say “
107212	107444	106749	106751	a Dr. Watson	266	” ! The healing touch of her reasonableness again came to his rescue . He would have liked to find her close at hand , on the very threshold of the telephone booth ; at the rate at which his thoughts were spinning he knew he would have to go over the whole affair again in his transit to her hotel . But there was no remedy for that ; he could only trust to her lucidity to help him out . Aunt Julia ’s apartment was in a hotel of the rue de Rivoli , with a row of windows overhanging the silvery reaches of the Tuileries gardens and the vista of domes and towers beyond . The room was large , airy , full of flowers . A fire burned on the hearth ; Rose Sellars ’s touch was everywhere . And a moment later she stood there before him , incredibly slim and young - looking in her dark dress and close little hat . Slightly paler , perhaps , and thinner — but as she moved forward with her easy step the impression vanished . He felt only her mastery of life and of herself , and thought how much less she needed him than did the dishevelled child he had just left . The thought widened the distance between them , and brought Judith abruptly closer . “
107451	107453	107448	107448	I	0	” he said—“and
107458	107536	107537	107537	Dear	2469	” He had prepared a dozen opening phrases — but the sudden intrusion of Judith ’s face dashed them all from his lips . He was returning to ask forgiveness of the woman to whom he still considered himself engaged , and his first word , after an absence prolonged and unaccountable , was to remind her of the cause of their breach . He saw the narrowing of her lips , and then her victorious smile . “
107550	107571	107544	107544	I	0	” she said , holding out her hand . But he was still struggling in the coil of his blunder . “
107588	107652	107653	107653	You	0	” he stammered . She freed her hand , and turned on the electric switch of the nearest lamp . As she bent to it he saw that the locks escaping on each temple were streaked with gray . The sight seemed to lengthen the days of their separation into months and years . He felt like a stranger coming back to her . “
107658	107668	107653	107653	You	0	” he began . She looked at him gravely . “
107677	107678	107672	107672	I	0	” “
107686	107696	107682	107682	you	0	” he said confusedly . She shook her head . “
107719	107766	107682	107682	you	0	” She pointed to an armchair , sat down herself , and took off her hat . In the lamplight , under the graying temples , her face looked changed and aged , like her hair . But it was varnished over by her undaunted smile . “
107785	107810	107776	107776	I	0	” She leaned her head thoughtfully on her hand , in the attitude he had loved in the little sitting - room at Cortina . “
107817	107821	107814	107815	a ghost	2196	” he said . “
107842	107843	107814	107815	a ghost	2196	” “
107848	107891	107814	107815	a ghost	2196	” He looked about the pleasant firelit room , saw her work - basket in its usual place near the hearth , her books heaped up on a table , and a familiar litter of papers on a desk in the window . “
107895	107908	107814	107815	a ghost	2196	” he repeated . She waited a moment , and then said : “
107921	107922	107911	107911	you	0	” “
107938	107977	107936	107936	I	0	” He got up , walked across the room , glanced half - curiously at the titles of some of the books , and came back and leaned against the mantelpiece . She sat looking up at him . “
107980	107981	107936	107936	I	0	” “
107988	107989	107984	107984	I	0	” “
107995	107996	107990	107990	You	0	” “
108004	108022	108023	108023	I	0	” He dropped back into his chair and threw his head back , staring at the ceiling . “
108036	108037	108030	108030	I	0	” “
108051	108098	108048	108048	you	0	” she said . What he really wanted was not to tell her anything , but to get up again , and resume his inarticulate wanderings about the room . With an effort of the will he remained seated , and turned his eyes to hers . “
108117	108140	108105	108105	I	0	” But no ; that sort of talk was useless . He had better try to do what she had asked him . “
108181	108311	108315	108315	you	2201	” His tongue was loosened , and he found it easier to go on . After all , Mrs. Sellars was right ; the story of the children must be disposed of first . After that he might see more clearly into his own case and hers . He went on with his halting narrative , and she listened in silence — that rare silence of hers which was all alertness and sympathy . She smiled a little over the Princess Buondelmonte ’s invasion , and sighed and frowned when he mentioned that Lady Wrench was also impending . When he came to Mrs. Wheater ’s summons , and his own insistence that Judith and Chip should immediately obey it , she lifted her eyes , and said approvingly : “
108320	108321	108323	108323	I	0	” “
108346	108355	108331	108331	I	0	” She gave a little smile of reassurance . “
108389	108390	108380	108380	I	0	” “
108394	108395	108380	108380	I	0	” “
108456	108477	108478	108478	You	2201	” Boyne listened with a sudden start of attention . He felt like some one shaken out of a lethargy . “
108493	108494	108485	108485	I	0	” “
108534	108535	108537	108537	Dobree	200	” “
108540	108556	108537	108537	Dobree	200	” He stared , incredulous , as if he must have heard the wrong name . “
108688	108707	108683	108683	I	0	” He tried to answer , but again found himself benumbed . Her eyes continued to challenge him . “
108715	108719	108683	108683	I	0	” she smiled . “
108730	108749	108754	108754	you	200	” She waited for him to continue , but he was silent again , and she questioned suddenly : “
108757	108786	108754	108754	you	200	” He looked at her with a confused stare , as if her face had become that of a stranger , as familiar faces do in a dream . “
108789	108791	108792	108792	Dobree	200	” he said—“this
108794	108798	108799	108799	You	200	” She kindled . “
108843	108847	108839	108841	a good man	2213	” she added . “
108850	108899	108900	108900	I	0	” he said , hardly hearing her . All the torture of his hour of madness about Mr. Dobree had returned to him . He would have liked to leap up on the instant , and go and find him , and fight it out with his fists .... “
108905	108910	108900	108900	I	0	” she continued nervously , “
108918	108925	108900	108900	I	0	” He made a weary gesture . “
108935	108936	108900	108900	I	0	” “
108991	108992	108988	108988	you	193	” “
109007	109008	109009	109009	I	0	” “
109048	109049	109042	109042	she	386	” “
109054	109055	109042	109042	she	386	” “
109119	109120	109121	109121	I	0	” “
109125	109129	109121	109121	I	0	” he acceded . “
109133	109146	109147	109147	I	0	” She paused , and then repeated , with a sharper stress : “
109156	109214	109147	109147	I	0	” He looked about him with the same estranged stare with which his eyes had rested on her face . Something clear and impenetrable as a pane of crystal seemed to cut him off from her , and from all that surrounded her . He had been to the country from which travellers return with another soul . “
109220	109386	109216	109216	I	0	” Ah , he knew that well enough ! What he wanted , at the moment , was just some opiate to dull the dogged ache of body and soul — to close his ears against that laugh of Judith ’s , and all his senses to her nearness . He was caught body and soul — that was it ; and real loving was not the delicate distraction , the food for dreams , he had imagined it when he thought himself in love with Rose Sellars ; it was this perpetual obsession , this clinging nearness , this breaking on the rack of every bone , and tearing apart of every fibre . And his apprenticeship to it was just beginning .... Well , there was one thing certain ; it was that he must get away , as soon as he could , from the friendly room and Rose ’s forgiving presence . He tried to blunder into some sort of explanation . “
109399	109489	109490	109490	She	2220	” he began abruptly . Mrs. Sellars was silent ; but it was not one of her speaking silences . It was like a great emptiness slowly widening between them . For a moment he thought she meant to force on him the task of bridging it over ; then he saw that she was struggling with a pain as benumbing as his own . She could not think of anything to say any more than he could , and her helplessness moved him , and brought her nearer . “
109501	109529	109490	109490	She	2220	” he thought ; but his pity for her did not help him to find words . At length he got up and held out his hand . “
109570	109571	109639	109639	You	0	” “
109574	109638	109639	109639	You	0	” she assented , very low . She did not take the hand he held out — perhaps did not even see it . When two people part who have loved each other it is as if what happens between them befell in a great emptiness — as if the tearing asunder of the flesh must turn at last into a disembodied anguish . “
109645	110540	109639	109639	You	0	” she said , as he reached the door . He gave a little laugh as he came back to get it . XXXI The next day Boyne lunched at the _ Nouveau Luxe _ alone with Mrs. Wheater and Judith . He had wondered if it would occur to Joyce that it might be preferable to lunch upstairs , in her own rooms ; but it had not ; and his mind was too dulled with pain for him to care much for his surroundings . No crowd could make him feel farther away from Judith than the unseeing look in her own eyes . Mrs. Wheater was dressed with a Quaker - like austerity which made her look younger and handsomer than when he had last seen her , in the rakish apparel of the Lido . She had acquired another new voice , as she did with each new phase ; this time it was subdued and somewhat melancholy , but less studied than the fluty tones she had affected in Venice . Altogether , Boyne had to admit that she had improved — that Mr. Dobree ’s influence had achieved what others had failed to do . After lunch they went upstairs , and Joyce proposed to Judith that , as the rain had stopped , she should take Chipstone and Susan to the Bois de Boulogne . She herself wanted to have a quiet talk with dear Martin — Judith could send the motor back to pick her up at four ; no , at half - past three . She had promised to go to a wonderful loan exhibition of Incunabula with Mr. Dobree .... Judith nodded and disappeared , with a faint smile at Boyne . Mr. Dobree had opened her eyes to so many marvels , Joyce continued when they were alone . Incunabula , for instance — would Boyne believe that she had never before heard of their existence ? Mr. Dobree had thought she must be joking when she asked him what they were . But Martin knew how much chance she had had of cultivating herself in Cliffe ’s society .... Yes , and she was beginning to collect books — first editions — and to form a real library . Did n’t he think it would be a splendid thing for the children — especially for Terry ? She blushed to think that while the family travelled over Europe in steam - yachts and Blue Trains and Rolls - Royces , poor Terry had had to feed on the rubbish Scopy could pick up for him in hotel libraries , or the _ cabinets de lecture _ of frowsy watering - places . Mr. Dobree had been horrified when he found that Cliffe , with all his millions , had never owned a library ! But then he did n’t know Cliffe . Joyce went on to unfold her plans for the future . She spoke , as usual , as if they were fixed and immutable in every detail . She had decided to buy a place in the country — near either Paris or Dinard , she was n’t sure which . Probably Dinard on account of Terry ’s health . The climate was mild ; and it was said that there were educational advantages . If the sea was too strong for him she could find a house somewhere inland . But they must be near a town on account of the children ’s education , and yet not in it because of the demoralising influences , and the lack of good air . In a few days she was going down to look about her at Dinard .... Boyne knew , she supposed , that she had begun divorce proceedings ? Of course she ought to have done it long ago — but in that _ milieu _ one ’s moral sense got absolutely blunted . Evidence — ? Heavens ! She already had more than enough to make her own terms . Horrors and horrors .... There was no doubt , Mr. Dobree said , that the courts would give her the custody of all the children . And from now on they would be the sole object of her life . Did n’t Boyne agree that , at her age , there could n’t be a more perfect conclusion ? Oh , yes , she knew — she looked younger than she really was ... but there were gray streaks in her hair already ; had n’t he noticed ? And she was n’t going to dye it ; not she ! She was going to let herself turn frankly into an _ old woman _ . She did n’t mind the idea a bit . Middle - age was so full of duties and interests of its own ; she had a perfect horror of the women who are always dyeing and drugging themselves , in the hopeless attempt to keep young — like that pitiable Syb Lullmer , for instance . She had learned , thank heaven , that there were other things in life . And her first object , of course , was to get the children away from hotels and hotel contacts — from all the _ Nouveaux Luxes _ and the “
110543	110795	109639	109639	You	0	” She was counting the minutes till she could create a real home for them , and make them so happy that they would never want to leave it .... She knew Boyne would approve .... The monologue ended by her expressing her gratitude for all he had done for the children , and her delight at being reunited to Judith and Chip — Chip , oh , he was a wonder , so fat and tall , and walking and talking like a boy of four . And Judith told her it was all thanks to Boyne .... Mrs. Wheater seemed genuinely sorry to think that Bun and Beechy would probably have to return to their father . But perhaps , she added , if the new Princess Buondelmonte was so full of good intentions , and so determined to have her own way , the two children might get a fairly decent bringing - up . Buondelmonte was n’t as young as he had been , and might be glad to settle down , if his wife made him comfortable , and let him have enough money to gamble at his club . And as for Zinnie — Joyce shrugged , and doubted if either her mother or Cliffe would really take Zinnie on , when it came to the point . She was rather a handful , Zinnie was ; no one but Judy could control her . Still , grieved as Joyce would be to give up the “
110798	111235	109639	109639	You	0	” poor little souls , she was too much used to human ingratitude not to foresee that they might be taken from her at any moment . But her own children — no ! Never again . Of that Boyne might be assured . She had learned her lesson , her eyes had been opened to her own folly and imprudence ; and Mr. Dobree had absolutely promised her — oh , by the way , was n’t Martin going to stay and see Mr. Dobree , who would be turning up at any minute now to take her to see the Incunabula ? She thought he and Martin had met at Cortina , had n’t they ? Yes , she remembered ; Mr. Dobree had been so struck by Martin ’s devotion to the children . She hoped so much they might meet again and make friends .... Boyne thanked her , and thought perhaps another time ... but he was leaving Paris , probably ; he could n’t wait then .... He got himself out of the room in a confusion of excuses .... All day he wandered through the streets , inconsolably . His will - power seemed paralysed . He was determined to get away from Paris at once , to go to New York first , in quest of a job , and then to whatever end of the world the job should call him . There was no object in his lingering where he was for another hour . He and Rose Sellars had said their last word to each other — and to Judith herself what more had he to say ? Yet he could not submit his mind to the idea that his happy unreal life of the last weeks was over ; that he would never again enter the _ pension _ at Cortina , and see the little Wheaters flocking about him in a tumult of welcome , begging for a romp , a game , a story , clamouring to have their quarrels arbitrated , demanding to be taken on a picnic — with Judith serene above the tumult , or laughing and twittering with the rest .... When he grew too tired to walk farther he turned in at a post - office , and wrote a cable which he had been revolving for some hours . It was addressed to the New York contractors who had written to ask if he could trace the young engineer who had been his assistant . Luckily he had not been able to , and he cabled : “
111259	111376	111256	111257	Cable bankers	2224	” This message despatched , he turned to the telephone booth , rang up the _ Nouveau Luxe _ , and asked to speak to Miss Wheater . Interminable minutes passed after he had put in his call ; Mrs. Wheater ’s maid was found first , who did n’t know where Judith was , or how to find her ; then Susan , who said Judith had come back , and gone out again , and that all she knew was that the ladies were going to dine out that evening with Mr. Dobree , and go to the theatre . Then , just as Boyne was turning away discouraged , Judith ’s own voice : “
111391	111392	111256	111257	Cable bankers	2224	” “
111408	111587	111588	111588	Martin	193	” He suddenly found he had decided that without knowing it . She exclaimed in astonishment , and asked where she was to meet him ; and he acquiesced in her suggestion that it should be at a tea - room near her hotel , as it was so late that she would soon have to hurry back for dinner . He jumped into a taxi , secured a table in a remote corner of the tea - room , and met her on the threshold a moment later . It was already long after six , and the rooms were emptying ; in a few minutes they would have the place to themselves . Judith , a little flushed with the haste of her arrival , looked gracefully grown up in her dark coat edged with fur , a pretty antelope bag in her gloved hand . The bareheaded girl of the Dolomites , in sports ’ frock and russet shoes , had been replaced by a demure young woman who seemed to Boyne almost a stranger . “
111598	111706	111590	111590	You	193	” she began at once , not noticing his request that she should choose between tea - cakes and _ éclairs _ . He said he was , for a few days at any rate ; the mere sound of her voice , the look in her eyes , had nearly dissolved his plans again , and his own voice was unsteady . The fact that it was only for a few days seemed to reassure Judith . He ’d be back by the end of the week , she hoped , would n’t he ? Yes — oh , yes , he said — very probably . “
111720	111734	111712	111713	the children’ll	2225	” she announced ; and , turning her attention to the trays presented : “
111749	111750	111751	111752	The children	505	” “
111754	111755	111751	111752	The children	505	” “
111856	111941	111841	111841	he	200	” She spoke serenely , almost lightly , as if all her anxieties had been dispelled . Could it be that the mere change of scene , the few hours spent with her mother , had so completely reassured her ? She , who had always measured Joyce with such precocious insight , was it possible that she was deluded by her now ? Or had she too succumbed to Mr. Dobree ’s mysterious influence ? Boyne looked at her careless face and wondered . “
111963	111982	111957	111957	you	200	” She seemed a little puzzled , and wrinkled her brows in the effort to find a reason . “
112080	112089	112071	112071	He	200	” She turned her radiant eyes on Boyne . “
112146	112327	112114	112114	You	193	” Yes , of course he would , Boyne said ; on Scopy ’s book he would . She lit up at that , asking where they ’d better go , and finally settling that , if the rain ever held up , a day at Versailles would be jollier than anything .... But it must be soon , she reminded him ; because in a few days Mrs. Wheater was going to carry them all off to Dinard . Yes , she pursued , she really did feel that Mr. Dobree , just in a few weeks , had gained more influence over her mother than any one else ever had . Judith had had a long talk with him that morning , and he had told her frankly that he was doing it all out of interest in the children , and because he wanted to help her — wasn’t that dear of him ? Anyhow , they were all going to stand together , grown ups and children , and put up a last big fight . ( “
112333	112510	112114	112114	You	193	” Boyne interpolated with a strained smile . ) And they were to have a big house in the country , with lots of dogs and horses , she continued . And the children were never to go to hotels any more . And Terry was to have a really first - rate tutor , and be sent to school in Switzerland as soon as he was strong enough ; in another year , perhaps . Boyne sat watching her with insatiable eyes . She looked so efficient , so experienced — yet what could be surer proof of her childishness than this suddenly revived faith in the future ? He saw that whoever would promise to keep the children together would gain a momentary hold over her — as he once had , alas ! And he saw also that the mere change of scene , the excitement of the flight from Cortina , the encouragement which her mother ’s new attitude gave her , were so many balloons lifting her up into the blue .... “
112522	112527	112518	112518	you	2237	” she began again . “
112555	112565	112566	112566	I	0	” She looked at him with her hesitating smile . “
112583	112589	112581	112581	darling	3107	” she broke off decisively , “
112597	112598	112599	112599	Lord	2241	” “
112614	112672	112673	112673	Faust	268	” He found the voice and laugh she expected , gave her back her banter , discussed and fixed with her the day and hour of the party . And all the while there echoed in his ears , more insistently than anything she was saying , a line or two from the chorus of Lemures , in “
112675	112742	112673	112673	Faust	268	” which Rose had read aloud one evening at Cortina . _ Who made the room so mean and bare — Where are the chairs , the tables where ? It was lent for a moment only — _ A moment only : not a bad title for the history of his last few months ! A moment only ; and he had always known it . “
112746	112750	112599	112599	Lord	2241	” he thought , “
112815	112898	112905	112905	she	2245	“ _ L’addition , mademoiselle ? _ Good Lord , child ; four _ éclairs _ ? And a Dobree dinner in the offing ! Ah , thrice - happy infancy , as the poet said .... Yes , here ’s your umbrella . Take my arm , and we ’ll nip round on foot to the back door of the _ Luxe _ . You ’ve eaten so much that I have n’t got enough left to pay for a taxi .... ”
112916	112930	112905	112905	she	2245	“ Thursday morning , then , you ’ll fetch us all at ten ? ”
112936	112945	112932	112932	he	2246	“ On Scopy ’s book , I will ! ”
113005	113016	113053	113055	The busy man	2252	“ Job yours please sail immediately for Rio particulars on arrival ”
113526	113529	113530	113530	he	145	“ Come , ”
113536	113544	113530	113530	he	145	“ let ’s get back into the sun—. ”
113608	113618	113605	113605	Beechy	154	“ Martin , now ’s the time for presents ! ”
113648	113660	113661	113661	Boyne	145	“ Little devils — as if I could ever leave them ! ”
113664	113669	113671	113672	the steward	359	“ Tea , sir ? ”
113674	113678	113671	113672	the steward	359	“ Ham sandwiches ? ”
114866	114878	114861	114861	he	145	“ Gala Dinner and Dance tonight at the _ Mirasol _ . ”
114894	114896	114861	114861	he	145	“ Palace ”
115428	115438	115415	115415	she	133	“ May I look at the pictures with you ? ”
115469	115481	115466	115466	her	133	“ Martin — why , I believe it ’s old Martin ! ”
115482	115501	115502	115502	he	145	“ Yes , it ’s old Martin — but you ’re a new Zinnie , are n’t you ? ”
115546	115569	115570	115570	she	133	“ Well , it ’s a long time since I saw you . I ’m lots older — and you are too , ”
115574	115595	115570	115570	she	133	“ I do n’t believe you ’d have known me if I had n’t spoken to you , would you ? ”
115596	115607	115608	115608	he	145	“ Not if you had n’t had that burning bush , ”
115652	115659	115660	115660	he	145	“ Well , how ’s everybody ? ”
115667	115673	115675	115675	Zinnie	133	“ Oh , awfully well , ”
115677	115687	115688	115688	she	133	“ But you do n’t look very well yourself , ”
115698	115721	115688	115688	she	133	“ Never mind about me . Are you here together , all of you — or have the others stayed at Dinard ? ”
115722	115725	115726	115726	She	133	“ Dinard ? ”
115735	115751	115726	115726	She	133	“ Was n’t your mother going to buy a house in the country near Dinard ? ”
115752	115769	115771	115771	Zinnie	133	“ Was she ? I dunno . We ’ve never had a house of our own , ”
115773	115777	115771	115771	Zinnie	133	“ Never anywhere ? ”
115778	115812	115726	115726	She	133	“ No . I guess it would only bother mother to have a house . She likes hotels better . She ’s married again , you know ; and she ’s getting fat . ”
115813	115816	115856	115856	her	133	“ Married ? ”
115817	115836	115838	115838	Zinnie	133	“ Did n’t you know about that either ? How funny ! She ’s married to Mr. Dobree , ”
115863	115884	115853	115853	she	133	“ I guess you ’ve had a fever , have n’t you — or else something bad with your liver ? ”
115885	115907	115908	115908	His	145	“ Nothing of the sort . I was never better . But you ’re all here , then , I suppose ? ”
115921	115929	115931	115931	Zinnie	133	“ Yes ; we ’re all here , ”
115934	116003	115931	115931	Zinnie	133	“ At least Terry ’s at school in Switzerland , you see ; and Blanca ’s at a convent in Paris , ’cos she got engaged again to a lift - boy who was a worse rotter than the first ; and Bun and Beechy are in Rome , in their father ’s palace . They hate writing , so we do n’t actually know how they are . ”
116004	116007	116008	116008	Boyne	145	“ Ah — ”
116023	116029	116030	116030	he	145	“ But Chip ’s here ? ”
116040	116049	116033	116033	Zinnie	133	“ No , he is n’t here either . ”
116059	116064	116065	116065	she	133	“ He ’s buried , ”
116068	116072	116065	116065	she	133	“ Buried — ? ”
116073	116162	116033	116033	Zinnie	133	“ Did n’t you know that either ? You ’ve been ever so far away , I suppose . Chip got menin — meningitis , is n’t it ? We were at Chamonix , for Terry . The doctors could n’t do anything . It was last winter — no , the winter before . We all cried awfully ; we wore black for three months . And so after that mother decided she ’d better marry Mr. Dobree ; because she was too lonely , she said . ”
116163	116168	116065	116065	she	133	“ Ah , lonely — ”
116169	116243	116065	116065	she	133	“ Yes ; and so after a while we came to Paris and she was married . It must have been two years ago , because the steps were with us still ; and Beechy and I wore little pink dresses at the wedding , and Bun was page . I wonder you did n’t see our photographs in the ‘ Herald . ’ Do n’t you ever read the ‘ Herald ’ ? ”
116244	116248	116249	116249	Boyne	145	“ Not often , ”
116267	116283	116284	116284	she	133	“ And it ’s then we found out what Mr. Dobree ’s Christian name is , ”
116288	116360	116284	116284	she	133	“ We had work doing it ; but Terry managed to see the papers he had to sign the day of the wedding , and so we found out . His name ’s Azariah . We never thought of that , did we ? It ’s the name of a man who made millions in mines ; so I s’pose when he died he left all his money to Mr. Dobree . ”
116361	116367	116453	116453	Zinnie	133	“ Made millions in mines ? ”
116368	116401	116453	116453	Zinnie	133	“ Well , that ’s what Scopy said . She said : ‘ Not know that ? You little heathens ! Why , of course , Azariah was a minor prophet . ’ ”
116402	116410	116411	116411	Boyne	145	“ Oh , of course ; naturally , ”
116434	116452	116453	116453	Zinnie	133	“ So we think that ’s why he ’s so rich , and why mother married him , ”
116505	116521	116522	116522	she	133	“ Have a chocolate ? The ones in gold paper have got liqueur in ’em , ”
116542	116564	116565	116565	she	133	“ Martin , darling , are n’t those _ Abdullahs _ you ’re smoking ? Will you let me have one ? ”
116572	116587	116565	116565	she	133	“ Let you have one ? You do n’t mean to say you smoke ? ”
116588	116599	116600	116600	Boyne	145	“ No ; but I have a friend who does . ”
116635	116643	116644	116644	she	133	“ It ’s awfully sweet of you , ”
116647	116685	116644	116644	she	133	“ You always were an old darling . Do n’t you want to come upstairs and see mother ? She was a little tired after lunch , so I do n’t believe she ’s gone out yet . ”
116697	116733	116734	116734	he	145	“ Sorry , my dear ; but I ’m afraid I ca n’t . I — fact is , I ’m just here for a few hours ... taking the train back to Bordeaux presently , ”
116737	116759	116760	116760	Boyne	145	“ Oh , are you ? That ’s too bad . Mother will be awfully sorry — and so will Judy . ”
116770	116780	116762	116762	his	145	“ Ah , she ’s here too — Judy ? ”
116787	116872	116781	116781	Zinnie	133	“ Course she is . Only just today she ’s off on an excursion with some P’ruvians . They ’ve got an awfully long name — I ca n’t remember it . They have two Rolls - Royces . She wo n’t be back not till just before dinner . She ’ll have to be back then , because she ’s got a new dress for the dance tonight . It ’s a pity you ca n’t come back and see her in it . ”
116873	116886	116887	116887	He	145	“ Yes — it ’s a pity . But I ca n’t . ”
116903	116908	116909	116909	he	145	“ Goodbye , child , ”
116922	116928	116929	116929	She	133	“ Kiss me , Zinnie . ”
116945	116948	116949	116949	he	145	“ Goodbye , ”
117066	117077	117062	117062	himself	145	“ She ’s got a new dress for the dance . ”
117574	117602	117569	117569	he	145	“ But it ’s nearly three years since I saw her . She ’s grown up now — perhaps I ’m looking at her without knowing her .... ”
118176	118181	118187	118187	her	127	“ _ Judith ! _ ”
