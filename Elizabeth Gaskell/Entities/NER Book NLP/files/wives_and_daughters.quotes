17216	17888	17189	17190	Mrs. Goodenough	175	" But the fact was certain ; although he might frequently ask Mrs. Brown to give him something to eat in the housekeeper 's room -- he had no time for all the fuss and ceremony of luncheon with my lady -- he was always welcome to the grandest circle of visitors in the house . He might lunch with a duke any day that he chose ; given that a duke was forthcoming at the Towers . His accent was Scotch , not provincial . He had not an ounce of superfluous flesh on his bones ; and leanness goes a great way to gentility . His complexion was sallow , and his hair black ; in those days , the decade after the conclusion of the great continental war , to be sallow and black - a - vised was of itself a distinction ; he was not jovial ( as my lord remarked with a sigh , but it was my lady who endorsed the invitations ) , sparing of his words , intelligent , and slightly sarcastic . Therefore he was perfectly presentable . His Scotch blood ( for that he was of Scottish descent there could be no manner of doubt ) gave him just the kind of thistly dignity which made every one feel that they must treat him with respect ; so on that head he was assured . The grandeur of being an invited guest to dinner at the Towers from time to time , gave him but little pleasure for many years , but it was a form to be gone through in the way of his profession , without any idea of social gratification . But when Lord Hollingford returned to make the Towers his home , affairs were altered . Mr. Gibson really heard and learnt things that interested him seriously , and that gave fresh flavour to his reading . From time to time he met the leaders of the scientific world ; odd - looking , simple - hearted men , very much in earnest about their own particular subjects , and not having much to say on any other . Mr. Gibson found himself capable of appreciating such persons , and also perceived that they valued his appreciation , as it was honestly and intelligently given . Indeed , by - and - by , he began to send contributions of his own to the more scientific of the medical journals , and thus partly in receiving , partly in giving out information and accurate thought , a new zest was added to his life . There was not much intercourse between Lord Hollingford and himself ; the one was too silent and shy , the other too busy , to seek each other 's society with the perseverance required to do away with the social distinction of rank that prevented their frequent meetings . But each was thoroughly pleased to come into contact with the other . Each could rely on the other 's respect and sympathy with a security unknown to many who call themselves friends ; and this was a source of happiness to both ; to Mr. Gibson the most so , of course ; for his range of intelligent and cultivated society was the smaller . Indeed , there was no one equal to himself among the men with whom he associated , and this he had felt as a depressing influence , although he never recognized the cause of his depression . There was Mr. Ashton , the vicar , who had succeeded Mr. Browning , a thoroughly good and kind - hearted man , but one without an original thought in him ; whose habitual courtesy and indolent mind led him to agree to every opinion , not palpably heterodox , and to utter platitudes in the most gentlemanly manner . Mr. Gibson had once or twice amused himself , by leading the vicar on in his agreeable admissions of arguments "
17893	17898	17189	17190	Mrs. Goodenough	175	" and of statements as "
17903	18110	17189	17190	Mrs. Goodenough	175	" till he had planted the poor clergyman in a bog of heretical bewilderment . But then Mr. Ashton 's pain and suffering at suddenly finding out into what a theological predicament he had been brought , his real self - reproach at his previous admissions , were so great that Mr. Gibson lost all sense of fun , and hastened back to the Thirty - nine Articles with all the good - will in life , as the only means of soothing the vicar 's conscience . On any other subject , except that of orthodoxy , Mr. Gibson could lead him any lengths ; but then his ignorance on most of them prevented bland acquiescence from arriving at any results which could startle him . He had some private fortune , and was not married , and lived the life of an indolent and refined bachelor ; but though he himself was no very active visitor among his poorer parishioners , he was always willing to relieve their wants in the most liberal , and , considering his habits , occasionally in the most self - denying manner , whenever Mr. Gibson , or any one else , made them clearly known to him .

On the whole , they went on in the most amicable way ; only beyond the gregarious feeling common to most men , they had very little actual pleasure in each other 's society . Perhaps the man of all others to whom Mr. Gibson took the most kindly -- at least , until Lord Hollingford came into the neighbourhood -- was a certain Squire Hamley . He and his ancestors had been called squire as long back as local tradition extended . But there was many a greater land - owner in the county , for Squire Hamley 's estate was not more than eight hundred acres or so . But his family had been in possession of it long before the Earls of Cumnor had been heard of ; before the Hely - Harrisons had bought Coldstone Park ; no one in Hollingford knew the time when the Hamleys had not lived at Hamley .

18669	19428	18656	18657	The Church	1166	" At any rate , the Hamleys were a very old family , if not aborigines . They had not increased their estate for centuries ; they had held their own , if even with an effort , and had not sold a rood of it for the last hundred years or so . But they were not an adventurous race . They never traded , or speculated , or tried agricultural improvements of any kind . They had no capital in any bank ; nor what perhaps would have been more in character , hoards of gold in any stocking . Their mode of life was simple , and more like that of yeomen than squires . Indeed Squire Hamley , by continuing the primitive manners and customs of his forefathers , the squires of the eighteenth century , did live more as a yeoman , when such a class existed , than as a squire of this generation . There was a dignity in this quiet conservatism that gained him an immense amount of respect both from high and low ; and he might have visited at every house in the county had he so chosen . But he was very indifferent to the charms of society ; and perhaps this was owing to the fact that the squire , Roger Hamley , who at present lived and reigned at Hamley , had not received so good an education as he ought to have done . His father , Squire Stephen , had been plucked at Oxford , and , with stubborn pride , he had refused to go up again . Nay , more ! he had sworn a great oath , as men did in those days , that none of his children to come should ever know either university by becoming a member of it . He had only one child , the present Squire , and he was brought up according to his father 's word ; he was sent to a petty provincial school , where he saw much that he hated , and then turned loose upon the estate as its heir . Such a bringing up did not do him all the harm that might have been anticipated . He was imperfectly educated , and ignorant on many points ; but he was aware of his deficiency , and regretted it in theory . He was awkward and ungainly in society , and so kept out of it as much as possible ; and he was obstinate , violent - tempered , and dictatorial in his own immediate circle . On the other side , he was generous , and true as steel ; the very soul of honour , in fact . He had so much natural shrewdness , that his conversation was always worth listening to , although he was apt to start by assuming entirely false premises , which he considered as incontrovertible as if they had been mathematically proved ; but , given the correctness of his premises , nobody could bring more natural wit and sense to bear upon the arguments based upon them . He had married a delicate fine London lady ; it was one of those perplexing marriages of which one can not understand the reasons . Yet they were very happy , though possibly Mrs. Hamley would not have sunk into the condition of a chronic invalid , if her husband had cared a little more for her various tastes , or allowed her the companionship of those who did . After his marriage he was wo nt to say he had got all that was worth having out of the crowd of houses they called London . It was a compliment to his wife which he repeated until the year of her death ; it charmed her at first , it pleased her up to the last time of her hearing it ; but , for all that , she used sometimes to wish that he would recognize the fact that there might still be something worth hearing and seeing in the great city . But he never went there again , and though he did not prohibit her going , yet he showed so little sympathy with her when she came back full of what she had done on her visit that she ceased caring to go . Not but what he was kind and willing in giving his consent , and in furnishing her amply with money . "
19504	19513	19497	19497	thy	1167	" Then when she came back it was , "
19631	20682	20687	20688	little woman	1173	" Mrs. Hamley was a great reader , and had considerable literary taste . She was gentle and sentimental ; tender and good . She gave up her visits to London ; she gave up her sociable pleasure in the company of her fellows in education and position . Her husband , owing to the deficiencies of his early years , disliked associating with those to whom he ought to have been an equal ; he was too proud to mingle with his inferiors . He loved his wife all the more dearly for her sacrifices for him ; but , deprived of all her strong interests , she sank into ill - health ; nothing definite ; only she never was well . Perhaps if she had had a daughter it would have been better for her : but her two children were boys , and their father , anxious to give them the advantages of which he himself had suffered the deprivation , sent the lads very early to a preparatory school . They were to go on to Rugby and Cambridge ; the idea of Oxford was hereditarily distasteful in the Hamley family . Osborne , the eldest -- so called after his mother 's maiden name -- was full of taste , and had some talent . His appearance had all the grace and refinement of his mother 's . He was sweet - tempered and affectionate , almost as demonstrative as a girl . He did well at school , carrying away many prizes ; and was , in a word , the pride and delight of both father and mother ; the confidential friend of the latter , in default of any other . Roger was two years younger than Osborne ; clumsy and heavily built , like his father ; his face was square , and the expression grave , and rather immobile . He was good , but dull , his schoolmasters said . He won no prizes , but brought home a favourable report of his conduct . When he caressed his mother , she used laughingly to allude to the fable of the lap - dog and the donkey ; so thereafter he left off all personal demonstration of affection . It was a great question as to whether he was to follow his brother to college after he left Rugby . Mrs. Hamley thought it would be rather a throwing away of money , as he was so little likely to distinguish himself in intellectual pursuits ; anything practical -- such as a civil engineer -- would be more the kind of life for him . She thought that it would be too mortifying for him to go to the same college and university as his brother , who was sure to distinguish himself -- and , to be repeatedly plucked , to come away wooden - spoon at last . But his father persevered doggedly , as was his wo nt , in his intention of giving both his sons the same education ; they should both have the advantages of which he had been deprived . If Roger did not do well at Cambridge it would be his own fault . If his father did not send him thither , some day or other he might be regretting the omission , as the Squire had done himself for many a year . So Roger followed his brother Osborne to Trinity , and Mrs. Hamley was again left alone , after the year of indecision as to Roger 's destination , which had been brought on by her urgency . She had not been able for many years to walk beyond her garden ; the greater part of her life was spent on a sofa , wheeled to the window in summer , to the fireside in winter . The room which she inhabited was large and pleasant ; four tall windows looked out upon a lawn dotted over with flower - beds , and melting away into a small wood , in the centre of which there was a pond , filled with water - lilies . About this unseen pond in the deep shade Mrs. Hamley had written many a pretty four - versed poem since she lay on her sofa , alternately reading and composing verse . She had a small table by her side on which there were the newest works of poetry and fiction ; a pencil and blotting - book , with loose sheets of blank paper ; a vase of flowers always of her husband 's gathering ; winter and summer , she had a sweet fresh nosegay every day . Her maid brought her a draught of medicine every three hours , with a glass of clear water and a biscuit ; her husband came to her as often as his love for the open air and his labours out - of - doors permitted ; but the event of her day , when her boys were absent , was Mr. Gibson 's frequent professional visits . He knew there was real secret harm going on all this time that people spoke of her as a merely fanciful invalid ; and that one or two accused him of humouring her fancies . But he only smiled at such accusations . He felt that his visits were a real pleasure and lightening of her growing and indescribable discomfort ; he knew that Squire Hamley would have been only too glad if he had come every day ; and he was conscious that by careful watching of her symptoms he might mitigate her bodily pain . Besides all these reasons , he took great pleasure in the Squire 's society . Mr. Gibson enjoyed the other 's unreasonableness ; his quaintness ; his strong conservatism in religion , politics , and morals . Mrs. Hamley tried sometimes to apologize for , or to soften away , opinions which she fancied were offensive to the doctor , or contradictions which she thought too abrupt ; but at such times her husband would lay his great hand almost caressingly on Mr. Gibson 's shoulder , and soothe his wife 's anxiety , by saying , "
20755	20941	20748	20748	he	1176	" One of Mrs. Hamley 's often - expressed wishes had been , that Molly might come and pay her a visit . Mr. Gibson always refused this request of hers , though he could hardly have given his reasons for these refusals . He did not want to lose the companionship of his child , in fact ; but he put it to himself in quite a different way . He thought her lessons and her regular course of employment would be interrupted . The life in Mrs. Hamley 's heated and scented room would not be good for the girl ; Osborne and Roger Hamley would be at home , and he did not wish Molly to be thrown too exclusively upon them for young society ; or they would not be at home , and it would be rather dull and depressing for his girl to be all the day long with a nervous invalid . But at length the day came when Mr. Gibson rode over , and volunteered a visit from Molly ; an offer which Mrs. Hamley received with the "
20948	21007	21008	21010	the young gentlemen	1178	" as she expressed it ; and of which the duration was unspecified . The cause for the change in Mr. Gibson 's wishes just referred to was as follows:--It has been mentioned that he took pupils , rather against his inclination , it is true ; but there they were , a Mr. Wynne and Mr. Coxe , "
21012	21021	21008	21010	the young gentlemen	1178	" as they were called in the household ; "
21028	21068	21022	21023	Mr. Gibson	158	" as they were termed in the town . Mr. Wynne was the elder , the more experienced one , who could occasionally take his master 's place , and who gained experience by visiting the poor , and the "
21072	21153	21154	21159	young gentlemen " to deal with	7625	" Mr. Gibson used to talk over his practice with Mr. Wynne , and try and elicit his opinions in the vain hope that , some day or another , Mr. Wynne might start an original thought . The young man was cautious and slow ; he would never do any harm by his rashness , but at the same time he would always be a little behind his day . Still Mr. Gibson remembered that he had had far worse "
21156	21380	21381	21381	He	1180	" to deal with ; and was content with , if not thankful for , such an elder pupil as Mr. Wynne . Mr. Coxe was a boy of nineteen or so , with brilliant red hair , and a tolerably red face , of both of which he was very conscious and much ashamed . He was the son of an Indian officer , an old acquaintance of Mr. Gibson 's . Major Coxe was at some unpronounceable station in the Punjaub , at the present time ; but the year before he had been in England , and had repeatedly expressed his great satisfaction at having placed his only child as a pupil to his old friend , and had in fact almost charged Mr. Gibson with the guardianship as well as the instruction of his boy , giving him many injunctions which he thought were special in this case ; but which Mr. Gibson with a touch of annoyance assured the major were always attended to in every case , with every pupil . But when the poor major ventured to beg that his boy might be considered as one of the family , and that he might spend his evenings in the drawing - room instead of the surgery , Mr. Gibson turned upon him with a direct refusal . "

21421	21428	21417	21417	himself	1184	" asked the major , ruefully . "
21500	21609	21610	21610	you	1186	" Major Coxe was not quite sure whether Mr. Gibson was not laughing at him in his sleeve ; but things were so far arranged , and the real advantages were so great , that he thought it was best to take no notice , but even to submit to the indignity of pill - making . He was consoled for all these rubs by Mr. Gibson 's manner at last when the supreme moment of final parting arrived . The doctor did not say much ; but there was something of real sympathy in his manner that spoke straight to the father 's heart , and an implied "
21627	21742	21610	21610	you	1186	" in each of the few last words . Mr. Gibson knew his business and human nature too well to distinguish young Coxe by any overt marks of favouritism ; but he could not help showing the lad occasionally that he regarded him with especial interest as the son of a friend . Besides this claim upon his regard , there was something about the young man himself that pleased Mr. Gibson . He was rash and impulsive , apt to speak , hitting the nail on the head sometimes with unconscious cleverness , at other times making gross and startling blunders . Mr. Gibson used to tell him that his motto would always be "
21747	21928	21610	21610	you	1186	" and to this Mr. Coxe once made answer that he thought it was the best motto a doctor could have ; for if he could not cure the patient , it was surely best to get him out of his misery quietly , and at once . Mr. Wynne looked up in surprise , and observed that he should be afraid that such putting out of misery might be looked upon as homicide by some people . Mr. Gibson said in a dry tone , that for his part he should not mind the imputation of homicide , but that it would not do to make away with profitable patients in so speedy a manner ; and that he thought that as long as they were willing and able to pay two - and - sixpence for the doctor 's visit , it was his duty to keep them alive ; of course , when they became paupers the case was different . Mr. Wynne pondered over this speech ; Mr. Coxe only laughed . At last Mr. Wynne said,-- "

21998	22010	21995	21996	Mr. Wynne	214	" said Mr. Gibson , leaving the surgery as he spoke . "

22232	22394	22395	22395	Bethia	220	" CHAPTER V. CALF - LOVE . One day , for some reason or other , Mr. Gibson came home unexpectedly . He was crossing the hall , having come in by the garden - door -- the garden communicated with the stable - yard , where he had left his horse -- when the kitchen door opened , and the girl who was underling in the establishment , came quickly into the hall with a note in her hand , and made as if she was taking it upstairs ; but on seeing her master she gave a little start , and turned back as if to hide herself in the kitchen . If she had not made this movement , so conscious of guilt , Mr. Gibson , who was anything but suspicious , would never have taken any notice of her . As it was , he stepped quickly forwards , opened the kitchen door , and called out "
22396	22407	22395	22395	Bethia	220	" so sharply that she could not delay coming forwards . "
22413	22422	22395	22395	Bethia	220	" he said . She hesitated a little . "

He turned into the empty dining - room , shut the door , broke the seal of the note , and began to read it . It was a flaming love - letter from Mr. Coxe ; who professed himself unable to go on seeing her day after day without speaking to her of the passion she had inspired -- an "
22818	22909	22713	22713	We	1211	" he called it ; on reading which Mr. Gibson laughed a little . Would she not look kindly at him ? would she not think of him whose only thought was of her ? and so on , with a very proper admixture of violent compliments to her beauty . She was fair , not pale ; her eyes were loadstars , her dimples marks of Cupid 's finger , & amp;c . Mr. Gibson finished reading it ; and began to think about it in his own mind . "
23057	23122	23123	23123	I	0	" ( Mrs. Gibson 's name was Mary , so he must have been referring to some one else . ) Then his thoughts wandered back to other days , though he still held the open note in his hand . By - and - by his eyes fell upon it again , and his mind came back to bear upon the present time . "
23175	23208	23211	23211	master	7444	" After a little more consideration in the same strain , Mr. Gibson went and sat down at the writing - table and wrote the following formula:-- _ Master Coxe . _ ( "
23220	23279	23211	23211	master	7444	" said Mr. Gibson to himself as he wrote the word . ) Rx . Verecundi¾ i oz . Fidelitatis Domestic¾ i oz . Reticenti¾ gr . iij . M. Capiat hanc dosim ter die in aqu pur. R. GIBSON , _ Ch . _ Mr. Gibson smiled a little sadly as he re - read his words . "
23283	23335	23280	23281	Poor Jeanie	225	" he said aloud . And then he chose out an envelope , enclosed the fervid love - letter , and the above prescription ; sealed it with his own sharply - cut seal - ring , R. G. , in old English letters , and then paused over the address . "
23355	23416	23280	23281	Poor Jeanie	225	" So the direction on the envelope was-- _ Edward Coxe , Esq . _ Then Mr. Gibson applied himself to the professional business which had brought him home so opportunely and unexpectedly , and afterwards he went back through the garden to the stables ; and just as he had mounted his horse , he said to the stable - man,--"Oh
23454	23550	23552	23552	I	0	" The slight smile upon his face , as he rode out of the gates , died away as soon as he found himself in the solitude of the lanes . He slackened his speed , and began to think . It was very awkward , he considered , to have a motherless girl growing up into womanhood in the same house with two young men , even if she only met them at meal - times ; and all the intercourse they had with each other was merely the utterance of such words as , "
23558	23569	23552	23552	I	0	" or , as Mr. Wynne would persevere in saying , "
23575	23941	23948	23948	he	1223	potatoes?"--a form of speech which grated daily more and more upon Mr. Gibson 's ears . Yet Mr. Coxe , the offender in this affair which had just occurred , had to remain for three years more as a pupil in Mr. Gibson 's family . He should be the very last of the race . Still there were three years to be got over ; and if this stupid passionate calf - love of his lasted , what was to be done ? Sooner or later Molly would become aware of it . The contingencies of the affair were so excessively disagreeable to contemplate , that Mr. Gibson determined to dismiss the subject from his mind by a good strong effort . He put his horse to a gallop , and found that the violent shaking over the lanes -- paved as they were with round stones , which had been dislocated by the wear and tear of a hundred years -- was the very best thing for the spirits , if not for the bones . He made a long round that afternoon , and came back to his home imagining that the worst was over , and that Mr. Coxe would have taken the hint conveyed in the prescription . All that would be needed was to find a safe place for the unfortunate Bethia , who had displayed such a daring aptitude for intrigue . But Mr. Gibson reckoned without his host . It was the habit of the young men to come in to tea with the family in the dining - room , to swallow two cups , munch their bread or toast , and then disappear . This night Mr. Gibson watched their countenances furtively from under his long eye - lashes , while he tried against his wo nt to keep up a dgag manner , and a brisk conversation on general subjects . He saw that Mr. Wynne was on the point of breaking out into laughter , and that red - haired , red - faced Mr. Coxe was redder and fiercer than ever , while his whole aspect and ways betrayed indignation and anger . "
23950	24038	23948	23948	he	1223	" thought Mr. Gibson to himself ; and he girded up his loins for the battle . He did not follow Molly and Miss Eyre into the drawing - room as he usually did . He remained where he was , pretending to read the newspaper , while Bethia , her face swelled up with crying , and with an aggrieved and offended aspect , removed the tea - things . Not five minutes after the room was cleared , came the expected tap at the door . "

Mr. Coxe hung his head a little , and meditated . "

25757	25789	25746	25746	We	1291	" Mr. Coxe came forward eagerly , and almost squeezed Mr. Gibson 's ring into his finger . As he was leaving the room , he said , a little uneasily , "

25839	26112	26113	26113	You	1293	" Then Mr. Gibson rang for his horse , and went out on the last visits of the day . He used to reckon that he rode the world around in the course of the year . There were not many surgeons in the county who had so wide a range of practice as he ; he went to lonely cottages on the borders of great commons ; to farm - houses at the end of narrow country lanes that led to nowhere else , and were overshadowed by the elms and beeches overhead . He attended all the gentry within a circle of fifteen miles round Hollingford ; and was the appointed doctor to the still greater families who went up to London every February -- as the fashion then was -- and returned to their acres in the early weeks of July . He was , of necessity , a great deal from home , and on this soft and pleasant summer evening he felt the absence as a great evil . He was startled at discovering that his little one was growing fast into a woman , and already the passive object of some of the strong interests that affect a woman 's life ; and he -- her mother as well as her father -- so much away that he could not guard her as he would have wished . The end of his cogitations was that ride to Hamley the next morning , when he proposed to allow his daughter to accept Mrs. Hamley 's last invitation -- an invitation that had been declined at the time . "
26148	26253	26140	26140	I	0	" he had said . But Mrs. Hamley was only too much charmed with the prospect of having a young girl for a visitor ; one whom it would not be a trouble to entertain ; who might be sent out to ramble in the gardens , or told to read when the invalid was too much fatigued for conversation ; and yet one whose youth and freshness would bring a charm , like a waft of sweet summer air , into her lonely shut - up life . Nothing could be pleasanter , and so Molly 's visit to Hamley was easily settled . "
26265	26276	26259	26259	Roger	211	" said Mrs. Hamley , in her low soft voice . "
26315	26383	26307	26307	I	0	" Mr. Gibson was very glad in his heart that the young men of the house were out of the way ; he did not want his little Molly to be passing from Scylla to Charybdis ; and , as he afterwards scoffed at himself for thinking , he had got an idea that all young men were wolves in chase of his one ewe - lamb .

After a while he said,--"It

She bought a lilac print , because it would wash , and would be cool and pleasant for the mornings ; and this Betty could make at home before Saturday . And for high - days and holidays -- by which was understood afternoons and Sundays -- Miss Rose persuaded her to order a gay - coloured flimsy plaid silk , which she assured her was quite the latest fashion in London , and which Molly thought would please her father 's Scotch blood . But when he saw the scrap which she had brought home as a pattern , he cried out that the plaid belonged to no clan in existence , and that Molly ought to have known this by instinct . It was too late to change it , however , for Miss Rose had promised to cut the dress out as soon as Molly left her shop . Mr. Gibson had hung about the town all the morning instead of going away on his usual distant rides . He passed his daughter once or twice in the street , but he did not cross over when he was on the opposite side -- only gave her a look or a nod , and went on his way , scolding himself for his weakness in feeling so much pain at the thought of her absence for a fortnight or so .

Of course the news of Miss Gibson 's approaching departure had spread through the household before the one o'clock dinner - time came ; and Mr. Coxe 's dismal countenance was a source of much inward irritation to Mr. Gibson , who kept giving the youth sharp glances of savage reproof for his melancholy face , and want of appetite ; which he trotted out , with a good deal of sad ostentation ; all of which was lost upon Molly , who was too full of her own personal concerns to have any thought or observation to spare from them , excepting once or twice when she thought of the many days that must pass over before she should again sit down to dinner with her father . When she named this to him after the meal was over , and they were sitting together in the drawing - room , waiting for the sound of the wheels of the Hamley carriage , he laughed , and said,-- "
28947	28955	28936	28936	you	1356	" Then they heard the approaching carriage . "
28960	28969	28958	28958	papa	7226	" said Molly , catching at his hand , "

29011	29564	29565	29565	I	0	" Yes ; she had got her keys , and her purse ; and her little box was put up on the seat by the coachman ; and her father handed her in ; the door was shut , and she drove away in solitary grandeur , looking back and kissing her hand to her father , who stood at the gate , in spite of his dislike of sentiment , as long as the carriage could be seen . Then he turned into the surgery , and found Mr. Coxe had had his watching too , and had , indeed , remained at the window gazing , moonstruck , at the empty road , up which the young lady had disappeared . Mr. Gibson startled him from his reverie by a sharp , almost venomous , speech about some small neglect of duty a day or two before . That night Mr. Gibson insisted on passing by the bedside of a poor girl whose parents were worn - out by many wakeful anxious nights succeeding to hard - working days . Molly cried a little , but checked her tears as soon as she remembered how annoyed her father would have been at the sight of them . It was very pleasant driving quickly along in the luxurious carriage , through the pretty green lanes , with dog - roses and honeysuckles so plentiful and rathe in the hedges , that she once or twice was tempted to ask the coachman to stop till she had gathered a nosegay . She began to dread the end of her little journey of seven miles ; the only drawback to which was , that her silk was not a true clan - tartan , and a little uncertainty as to Miss Rose 's punctuality . At length they came to a village ; straggling cottages lined the road , an old church stood on a kind of green , with the public - house close by it ; there was a great tree , with a bench all round the trunk , midway between the church gates and the little inn . The wooden stocks were close to the gates . Molly had long passed the limit of her rides , but she knew this must be the village of Hamley , and that they must be very near to the hall . They swung in at the gates of the park in a few minutes , and drove up through meadow - grass , ripening for hay,--it was no grand aristocratic deer - park this -- to the old red - brick hall ; not three hundred yards from the high - road . There had been no footman sent with the carriage , but a respectable servant stood at the door , even before they drew up , ready to receive the expected visitor , and take her into the drawing - room where his mistress lay awaiting her . Mrs. Hamley rose from her sofa to give Molly a gentle welcome ; she kept the girl 's hand in hers after she had finished speaking , looking into her face , as if studying it , and unconscious of the faint blush she called up on the otherwise colourless cheeks . "

29722	30285	29703	29703	I	0	" She rose languidly , and wrapping her light shawl round her yet elegant figure , led the way upstairs . Molly 's bedroom opened out of Mrs. Hamley 's private sitting - room ; on the other side of which was her own bedroom . She showed Molly this easy means of communication , and then , telling her visitor she would await her in the sitting - room , she closed the door , and Molly was left at leisure to make acquaintance with her surroundings . First of all , she went to the window to see what was to be seen . A flower - garden right below ; a meadow of ripe grass just beyond , changing colour in long sweeps , as the soft wind blew over it ; great old forest - trees a little on one side ; and , beyond them again , to be seen only by standing very close to the side of the window - sill , or by putting her head out , if the window was open , the silver shimmer of a mere , about a quarter of a mile off . On the opposite side to the trees and the mere , the look - out was bounded by the old walls and high - peaked roofs of the extensive farm - buildings . The deliciousness of the early summer silence was only broken by the song of the birds , and the nearer hum of bees . Listening to these sounds , which enhanced the exquisite sense of stillness , and puzzling out objects obscured by distance or shadow , Molly forgot herself , and was suddenly startled into a sense of the present by a sound of voices in the next room -- some servant or other speaking to Mrs. Hamley . Molly hurried to unpack her box , and arrange her few clothes in the pretty old - fashioned chest of drawers , which was to serve her as dressing - table as well . All the furniture in the room was as old - fashioned and as well - preserved as it could be . The chintz curtains were Indian calico of the last century -- the colours almost washed out , but the stuff itself exquisitely clean . There was a little strip of bedside carpeting , but the wooden flooring , thus liberally displayed , was of finely - grained oak , so firmly joined , plank to plank , that no grain of dust could make its way into the interstices . There were none of the luxuries of modern days ; no writing - table , or sofa , or pier - glass . In one corner of the walls was a bracket , holding an Indian jar filled with pot - pourri ; and that and the climbing honeysuckle outside the open window scented the room more exquisitely than any toilette perfumes . Molly laid out her white gown ( of last year 's date and size ) upon the bed , ready for the ( to her new ) operation of dressing for dinner , and having arranged her hair and dress , and taken out her company worsted - work , she opened the door softly , and saw Mrs. Hamley lying on the sofa .

30485	30638	30478	30478	I	0	" So she began . Molly was not so much absorbed in listening but that she could glance round the room . The character of the furniture was much the same as in her own . Old - fashioned , of handsome material , and faultlessly clean , the age and the foreign appearance of it gave an aspect of comfort and picturesqueness to the whole apartment . On the walls there hung some crayon sketches -- portraits . She thought she could make out that one of them was a likeness of Mrs. Hamley , in her beautiful youth . And then she became interested in the poem , and dropped her work , and listened in a manner that was after Mrs. Hamley 's own heart . When the reading of the poem was ended , Mrs. Hamley replied to some of Molly 's words of admiration , by saying : "
30676	30721	30672	30673	Mrs. Hemans	232	" To be nearly as good as Mrs. Hemans ' was saying as much to the young ladies of that day , as saying that poetry is nearly as good as Tennyson 's would be in this . Molly looked up with eager interest . "

The elder was sitting down , reading intently . The younger was standing by him , and evidently trying to call the attention of the reader off to some object out of doors -- out of the window of the very room in which they were sitting , as Molly discovered when she began to recognize the articles of furniture faintly indicated in the picture .

Molly was rather dismayed by the offers of the maid whom Mrs. Hamley had sent to assist her . "
31434	31441	31426	31426	they	1391	" she kept thinking to herself . "
31466	31557	31456	31456	I	0	" She looked at herself in the glass with some anxiety , for the first time in her life . She saw a slight , lean figure , promising to be tall ; a complexion browner than cream - coloured , although in a year or two it might have that tint ; plentiful curly black hair , tied up in a bunch behind with a rose - coloured ribbon ; long , almond - shaped , soft gray eyes , shaded both above and below by curling black eyelashes . "
31566	31578	31562	31562	I	0	" thought Molly , as she turned away from the glass ; "
31586	31855	31581	31581	I	0	" She would have been sure , if , instead of inspecting herself with such solemnity , she had smiled her own sweet merry smile , and called out the gleam of her teeth , and the charm of her dimples . She found her way downstairs into the drawing - room in good time ; she could look about her , and learn how to feel at home in her new quarters . The room was forty - feet long or so , fitted up with yellow satin at some distant period ; high spindle - legged chairs and pembroke - tables abounded . The carpet was of the same date as the curtains , and was thread - bare in many places ; and in others was covered with drugget . Stands of plants , great jars of flowers , old Indian china and cabinets gave the room the pleasant aspect it certainly had . And to add to it , there were five high , long windows on one side of the room , all opening to the prettiest bit of flower - garden in the grounds -- or what was considered as such -- brilliant - coloured , geometrically - shaped beds , converging to a sun - dial in the midst . The Squire came in abruptly , and in his morning dress ; he stood at the door , as if surprised at the white - robed stranger in possession of his hearth . Then , suddenly remembering himself , but not before Molly had begun to feel very hot , he said-- "
31903	31941	31942	31942	I	0	" By this time , they had met in the middle of the room , and he was shaking Molly 's hand with vehement friendliness , intended to make up for his not knowing her at first . "
31950	31960	31961	31961	Madam	237	" said he , looking at his soiled gaiters . "
32012	32331	32009	32010	Miss Gibson	187	" He did not stay to wait for her answer , but hastened away to perform his toilette . They dined at a small table in a great large room . There were so few articles of furniture in it , and the apartment itself was so vast , that Molly longed for the snugness of the home dining - room ; nay , it is to be feared that , before the stately dinner at Hamley Hall came to an end , she even regretted the crowded chairs and tables , the hurry of eating , the quick unformal manner in which everybody seemed to finish their meal as fast as possible , and to return to the work they had left . She tried to think that at six o'clock all the business of the day was ended , and that people might linger if they chose . She measured the distance from the sideboard to the table with her eye , and made allowances for the men who had to carry things backwards and forwards ; but , all the same , this dinner appeared to her a wearisome business , prolonged because the Squire liked it , for Mrs. Hamley seemed tired out . She ate even less than Molly , and sent for fan and smelling - bottle to amuse herself with , until at length the table - cloth was cleared away , and the dessert was put upon a mahogany table , polished like a looking - glass . The Squire had hitherto been too busy to talk , except about the immediate concerns of the table , and one or two of the greatest breaks to the usual monotony of his days ; a monotony in which he delighted , but which sometimes became oppressive to his wife . Now , however , peeling his orange , he turned to Molly-- "

She could not help dwelling on the danger which she fancied she had escaped , and was astonished at her own stupidity at never having imagined such a possibility as her father 's second marriage . She felt that she was answering Mrs. Hamley 's remarks in a very unsatisfactory manner . "
32972	33167	32966	32966	papa	7226	" she suddenly exclaimed . There they were coming across the flower - garden from the stable - yard , her father switching his boots with his riding whip , in order to make them presentable in Mrs. Hamley 's drawing - room . He looked so exactly like his usual self , his home - self , that the seeing him in the flesh was the most efficacious way of dispelling the phantom fears of a second wedding , which were beginning to harass his daughter 's mind ; and the pleasant conviction that he could not rest till he had come over to see how she was going on in her new home , stole into her heart , although he spoke but little to her , and that little was all in a joking tone . After he had gone away , the Squire undertook to teach her cribbage , and she was happy enough now to give him all her attention . He kept on prattling while they played ; sometimes in relation to the cards ; at others telling her of small occurrences which he thought might interest her . "
33263	33406	33407	33407	I	0	" And so on , till the butler came in with a solemn look , placed a large prayer - book before his master , who huddled the cards away in a hurry , as if caught in an incongruous employment ; and then the maids and men trooped in to prayers -- the windows were still open , and the sounds of the solitary corncrake , and the owl hooting in the trees , mingled with the words spoken . Then to bed ; and so ended the day . Molly looked out of her chamber window -- leaning on the sill , and snuffing up the night odours of the honeysuckle . The soft velvet darkness hid everything that was at any distance from her ; although she was as conscious of their presence as if she had seen them . "
33416	33466	33409	33409	I	0	" was in Molly 's thoughts , as she turned away at length , and began to prepare for bed . Before long the Squire 's words , relating to her father 's second marriage , came across her , and spoilt the sweet peace of her final thoughts . "

33491	33624	33626	33626	his	1427	" One by one , each of these was rejected for sufficient reasons . Yet the unsatisfied question rankled in her mind , and darted out of ambush to disturb her dreams . Mrs. Hamley did not come down to breakfast ; and Molly found out with a little dismay , that the Squire and she were to have it by themselves . On this first morning he put aside his newspapers -- one an old established Tory journal , with all the local and county news , which was the most interesting to him ; the other the _ Morning Chronicle _ , which he called his dose of bitters , and which called out many a strong expression and tolerably pungent oath . To - day , however , he was "
33629	33731	33626	33626	his	1427	" as he afterwards explained to Molly ; and he plunged about , trying to find ground for a conversation . He could talk of his wife and his sons , his estate , and his mode of farming ; his tenants , and the mismanagement of the last county election . Molly 's interests were her father , Miss Eyre , her garden and pony ; in a fainter degree Miss Brownings , the Cumnor Charity School , and the new gown that was to come from Miss Rose 's ; into the midst of which the one great question , "
33745	33861	33626	33626	his	1427	" kept popping up into her mouth , like a troublesome Jack - in - the - box . For the present , however , the lid was snapped down upon the intruder as often as he showed his head between her teeth . They were very polite to each other during the meal ; and it was not a little tiresome to both . When it was ended the Squire withdrew into his study to read the untasted newspapers . It was the custom to call the room in which Squire Hamley kept his coats , boots , and gaiters , his different sticks and favourite spud , his gun and fishing - rods , "
33865	33990	33626	33626	his	1427	" There was a bureau in it , and a three - cornered arm - chair , but no books were visible . The greater part of them were kept in a large , musty - smelling room , in an unfrequented part of the house ; so unfrequented that the housemaid often neglected to open the window - shutters , which looked into a part of the grounds over - grown with the luxuriant growth of shrubs . Indeed , it was a tradition in the servants ' hall that , in the late squire 's time -- he who had been plucked at college -- the library windows had been boarded up to avoid paying the window - tax . And when the "
33993	34174	33626	33626	his	1427	" were at home the housemaid , without a single direction to that effect , was regular in her charge of this room ; opened the windows and lighted fires daily , and dusted the handsomely - bound volumes , which were really a very fair collection of the standard literature in the middle of the last century . All the books that had been purchased since that time were held in small book - cases between each two of the drawing - room windows , and in Mrs. Hamley 's own sitting - room upstairs . Those in the drawing - room were quite enough to employ Molly ; indeed , she was so deep in one of Sir Walter Scott 's novels that she jumped as if she had been shot , when an hour or so after breakfast the Squire came to the gravel - path outside one of the windows , and called to ask her if she would like to come out of doors and go about the garden and home - fields with him .

Molly , too , plucked away her thoughts from the seventeenth century ; and , somehow or other , that one question , which had so haunted her before , came out of her lips before she was aware -- a literal impromptu,-- "

[ Illustration ( untitled ) ] If Squire Hamley had been unable to tell Molly who had ever been thought of as her father 's second wife , fate was all this time preparing an answer of a pretty positive kind to her wondering curiosity . But fate is a cunning hussy , and builds up her plans as imperceptibly as a bird builds her nest ; and with much the same kind of unconsidered trifles . The first "
36074	36124	35944	35944	one	601	" of an event was the disturbance which Jenny ( Mr. Gibson 's cook ) chose to make at Bethia 's being dismissed . Bethia was a distant relation and protge of Jenny 's , and she chose to say it was Mr. Coxe the tempter who ought to have "
36129	36481	35944	35944	one	601	" not Bethia the tempted , the victim . In this view there was quite enough plausibility to make Mr. Gibson feel that he had been rather unjust . He had , however , taken care to provide Bethia with another situation , to the full as good as that which she held in his family . Jenny , nevertheless , chose to give warning ; and though Mr. Gibson knew full well from former experience that her warnings were words , not deeds , he hated the discomfort , the uncertainty,--the entire disagreeableness of meeting a woman at any time in his house , who wore a grievance and an injury upon her face as legibly as Jenny took care to do . Down into the middle of this small domestic trouble came another , and one of greater consequence . Miss Eyre had gone with her old mother , and her orphan nephews and nieces , to the sea - side , during Molly 's absence , which was only intended at first to last for a fortnight . After about ten days of this time had elapsed , Mr. Gibson received a beautifully written , beautifully worded , admirably folded , and most neatly sealed letter from Miss Eyre . Her eldest nephew had fallen ill of scarlet fever , and there was every probability that the younger children would be attacked by the same complaint . It was distressing enough for poor Miss Eyre -- this additional expense , this anxiety -- the long detention from home which the illness involved . But she said not a word of any inconvenience to herself ; she only apologized with humble sincerity for her inability to return at the appointed time to her charge in Mr. Gibson 's family ; meekly adding , that perhaps it was as well , for Molly had never had the scarlet fever , and even if Miss Eyre had been able to leave the orphan children to return to her employments , it might not have been a safe or a prudent step . "
36487	36514	35944	35944	one	601	" said Mr. Gibson , tearing the letter in two , and throwing it into the hearth , where he soon saw it burnt to ashes . "
36541	36597	36598	36598	Molly	221	" Apparently , he forgot Mr. Coxe 's powers of making mischief ; but indeed he might have traced that evil back to the unconscious Molly . The martyr - cook 's entrance to take away the breakfast things , which she announced by a heavy sigh , roused Mr. Gibson from thought to action . "
36607	36611	36598	36598	Molly	221	" he resolved . "
36699	36752	36679	36679	I	0	" He found Mrs. Hamley lying on a sofa placed under the shadow of the great cedar - tree on the lawn . Molly was flitting about her , gardening away under her directions ; tying up the long sea - green stalks of bright budded carnations , snipping off dead roses . "
36759	36797	36757	36757	papa	7226	" she cried out , joyfully , as he rode up to the white paling which separated the trim lawn and trimmer flower - garden from the rough park - like ground in front of the house . "
36811	36822	36823	36823	We	1511	" said Mrs. Hamley , raising herself on her elbow . "
36849	36958	36959	36959	I	0	" So Mr. Gibson rode round to the stables , left his horse there , and made his way through the house to the open - air summer - parlour under the cedar - tree , where there were chairs , table , books , and tangled work . Somehow , he rather disliked asking for Molly to prolong her visit ; so he determined to swallow his bitter first , and then take the pleasure of the delicious day , the sweet repose , the murmurous , scented air . Molly stood by him , her hand on his shoulder . He sate opposite to Mrs. Hamley . "

37173	37260	37160	37160	I	0	" An uncomfortable suspicion flashed across his mind . He pulled her round , and looked straight and piercingly into her innocent face . Her colour came at his unwonted scrutiny , but her sweet eyes were filled with wonder , rather than with any feeling which he dreaded to find . For an instant he had doubted whether young red - headed Mr. Coxe 's love might not have called out a response in his daughter 's breast ; but he was quite clear now . "
37331	37410	37411	37411	I	0	" Molly knew him well enough to be certain that the prolongation of her visit at Hamley was quite a decided affair in his mind ; and then she was smitten with a sense of ingratitude . She left her father , and went to Mrs. Hamley , and bent over her and kissed her ; but she did not speak . Mrs. Hamley took hold of her hand , and made room on the sofa for her . "

38058	38204	38047	38047	she	1547	" It was quite true that the Squire had become very fond of Molly . The charm of having a young girl dancing and singing inarticulate ditties about the house and garden , was indescribable in its novelty to him . And then Molly was so willing and so wise ; ready both to talk and to listen at the right times . Mrs. Hamley was quite right in speaking of her husband 's fondness for Molly . But either she herself chose a wrong time for telling him of the prolongation of the girl 's visit , or one of the fits of temper to which he was liable , but which he generally strove to check in the presence of his wife , was upon him ; at any rate , he received the news in anything but a gracious frame of mind .

38845	38960	38833	38833	He	211	" All that afternoon the Squire tried to steer clear of Molly , to whom he felt himself to have been an inhospitable traitor . But she was so perfectly unconscious of his shyness of her , and so merry and sweet in her behaviour as a welcome guest , never distrusting him for a moment , however gruff he might be , that by the next morning she had completely won him round , and they were quite on the old terms again . At breakfast this very morning , a letter was passed from the Squire to his wife , and back again , without a word as to its contents ; but-- "

38969	39047	38833	38833	He	211	" Little did Molly apply these expressions to the piece of news Mrs. Hamley told her in the course of the day ; namely , that her son Osborne had received an invitation to stay with a friend in the neighbourhood of Cambridge , and perhaps to make a tour on the Continent with him subsequently ; and that , consequently , he would not accompany his brother when Roger came home . Molly was very sympathetic . "

39191	39785	39799	39799	mistress	1588	" Molly was a little puzzled by this speech , but soon put it out of her head . It was a disappointment to her , too , that she should not see this beautiful , brilliant young man , his mother 's hero . From time to time her maiden fancy had dwelt upon what he would be like ; how the lovely boy of the picture in Mrs. Hamley 's dressing - room would have changed in the ten years that had elapsed since the likeness was taken ; if he would read poetry aloud ; if he would even read his own poetry . However , in the never - ending feminine business of the day , she soon forgot her own disappointment ; it only came back to her on first wakening the next morning , as a vague something that was not quite so pleasant as she had anticipated , and then was banished as a subject of regret . Her days at Hamley were well filled up with the small duties that would have belonged to a daughter of the house had there been one . She made breakfast for the lonely squire , and would willingly have carried up madam 's , but that daily piece of work belonged to the squire , and was jealously guarded by him . She read the smaller print of the newspapers aloud to him , city articles , money and corn markets included . She strolled about the gardens with him , gathering fresh flowers , meanwhile , to deck the drawing - room against Mrs. Hamley should come down . She was her companion when she took her drives in the close carriage ; they read poetry and mild literature together in Mrs. Hamley 's sitting - room upstairs . She was quite clever at cribbage now , and could beat the squire if she took pains . Besides these things , there were her own independent ways of employing herself . She used to try to practise an hour daily on the old grand piano in the solitary drawing - room , because she had promised Miss Eyre she would do so . And she had found her way into the library , and used to undo the heavy bars of the shutters if the housemaid had forgotten this duty , and mount the ladder , sitting on the steps , for an hour at a time , deep in some book of the old English classics . The summer days were very short to this happy girl of seventeen . CHAPTER VIII . DRIFTING INTO DANGER . On Thursday , the quiet country household was stirred through all its fibres with the thought of Roger 's coming home . Mrs. Hamley had not seemed quite so well , or quite in such good spirits for two or three days before ; and the squire himself had appeared to be put out without any visible cause . They had not chosen to tell Molly that Osborne 's name had only appeared very low down in the mathematical tripos . So all that their visitor knew was that something was out of tune , and she hoped that Roger 's coming home would set it to rights , for it was beyond the power of her small cares and wiles . On Thursday , the housemaid apologized to her for some slight negligence in her bedroom , by saying she had been busy scouring Mr. Roger 's rooms . "
39850	39884	39885	39887	the eldest son	1108	" Molly was amused at this testimony to the rights of heirship ; but somehow she herself had fallen into the family manner of thinking that nothing was too great or too good for "
39889	40168	39885	39887	the eldest son	1108	" In his father 's eyes , Osborne was the representative of the ancient house of Hamley of Hamley , the future owner of the land which had been theirs for a thousand years . His mother clung to him because they two were cast in the same mould , both physically and mentally -- because he bore her maiden name . She had indoctrinated Molly with her faith , and , in spite of her amusement at the housemaid 's speech , the girl visitor would have been as anxious as any one to show her feudal loyalty to the heir , if indeed it had been he that was coming . After luncheon , Mrs. Hamley went to rest , in preparation for Roger 's return ; and Molly also retired to her own room , feeling that it would be better for her to remain there until dinner - time , and so to leave the father and mother to receive their boy in privacy . She took a book of MS . poems with her ; they were all of Osborne Hamley 's composition ; and his mother had read some of them aloud to her young visitor more than once . Molly had asked permission to copy one or two of those which were her greatest favourites ; and this quiet summer afternoon she took this copying for her employment , sitting at the pleasant open window , and losing herself in dreamy out - looks into the gardens and woods , quivering in the noon - tide heat . The house was so still , in its silence it might have been the "
40172	40524	39885	39887	the eldest son	1108	" the booming buzz of the blue flies , in the great staircase window , seemed the loudest noise in - doors . And there was scarcely a sound out - of - doors but the humming of bees , in the flower - beds below the window . Distant voices from the far - away fields where they were making hay -- the scent of which came in sudden wafts distinct from that of the nearer roses and honeysuckles -- these merry piping voices just made Molly feel the depth of the present silence . She had left off copying , her hand weary with the unusual exertion of so much writing , and she was lazily trying to learn one or two of the poems off by heart . I asked of the wind , but answer made it none , Save its accustomed sad and solitary moan-- she kept saying to herself , losing her sense of whatever meaning the words had ever had , in the repetition which had become mechanical . Suddenly there was the snap of a shutting gate ; wheels crackling on the dry gravel , horses ' feet on the drive ; a loud cheerful voice in the house , coming up through the open windows , the hall , the passages , the staircase , with unwonted fulness and roundness of tone . The entrance - hall downstairs was paved with diamonds of black and white marble ; the low wide staircase that went in short flights around the hall , till you could look down upon the marble floor from the top story of the house , was uncarpeted -- uncovered . The Squire was too proud of his beautifully - joined oaken flooring to cover this stair - case up unnecessarily ; not to say a word of the usual state of want of ready money to expend upon the decorations of his house . So , through the undraperied hollow square of the hall and staircase every sound ascended clear and distinct ; and Molly heard the Squire 's glad "
40531	40725	40528	40528	he	1595	" and madam 's softer , more plaintive voice ; and then the loud , full , strange tone , which she knew must be Roger 's . Then there was an opening and shutting of doors , and only a distant buzz of talking . Molly began again-- I asked of the wind , but answer made it none . And this time she had nearly finished learning the poem , when she heard Mrs. Hamley come hastily into her sitting - room that adjoined Molly 's bedroom , and burst out into an irrepressible half - hysterical fit of sobbing . Molly was too young to have any complication of motives which should prevent her going at once to try and give what comfort she could . In an instant she was kneeling at Mrs. Hamley 's feet , holding the poor lady 's hands , kissing them , murmuring soft words ; which , all unmeaning as they were of aught but sympathy with the untold grief , did Mrs. Hamley good . She checked herself , smiling sadly at Molly through the midst of her thick - coming sobs . "
40731	40738	40729	40729	Osborne	213	" said she , at last . "
40747	40748	40739	40739	Roger	211	" "

40902	40915	40892	40892	he	7531	" There was a fresh fit of the sobbing crying . Molly burst out,--"I

40959	40964	40965	40965	Roger	211	" said Mrs. Hamley . "
41194	41226	41227	41227	You	1613	" So talking out what was in her heart , Mrs. Hamley became more composed ; and at length she dismissed Molly to dress for dinner , with a kiss , saying,-- "
41308	41779	41298	41302	a stranger in the household	1619	" Molly thought over all that she had heard , as she was dressing and putting on the terrible , over - smart plaid gown in honour of the new arrival . Her unconscious fealty to Osborne was not in the least shaken by his having come to grief at Cambridge . Only she was indignant -- with or without reason -- against Roger , who seemed to have brought the reality of bad news as an offering of first - fruits on his return home . She went down into the drawing - room with anything but a welcome to him in her heart . He was standing by his mother ; the Squire had not yet made his appearance . Molly thought that the two were hand in hand when she first opened the door , but she could not be quite sure . Mrs. Hamley came a little forwards to meet her , and introduced her in so fondly intimate a way to her son , that Molly , innocent and simple , knowing nothing but Hollingford manners , which were anything but formal , half put out her hand to shake hands with one of whom she had heard so much -- the son of such kind friends . She could only hope he had not seen the movement , for he made no attempt to respond to it ; only bowed . He was a tall powerfully - made young man , giving the impression of strength more than elegance . His face was rather square , ruddy - coloured ( as his father had said ) , hair and eyes brown -- the latter rather deep - set beneath his thick eyebrows ; and he had a trick of wrinkling up his eyelids when he wanted particularly to observe anything , which made his eyes look even smaller still at such times . He had a large mouth , with excessively mobile lips ; and another trick of his was , that when he was amused at anything , he resisted the impulse to laugh , by a droll manner of twitching and puckering up his mouth , till at length the sense of humour had its way , and his features relaxed , and he broke into a broad sunny smile ; his beautiful teeth -- his only beautiful feature -- breaking out with a white gleam upon the red - brown countenance . These two tricks of his -- of crumpling up the eyelids , so as to concentrate the power of sight , which made him look stern and thoughtful ; and the odd twitching of the lips that was preliminary to a smile , which made him look intensely merry -- gave the varying expressions of his face a greater range "
41790	41819	41298	41302	a stranger in the household	1619	" than is common with most men . To Molly , who was not finely discriminative in her glances at the stranger this first night , he simply appeared "
41826	41828	41298	41302	a stranger in the household	1619	" and "
41841	42208	41298	41302	a stranger in the household	1619	" He certainly did not seem to care much what impression he made upon his mother 's visitor . He was at that age when young men admire a formed beauty more than a face with any amount of future capability of loveliness , and when they are morbidly conscious of the difficulty of finding subjects of conversation in talking to girls in a state of feminine hobbledehoyhood . Besides , his thoughts were full of other subjects , which he did not intend to allow to ooze out in words , yet he wanted to prevent any of that heavy silence which he feared might be impending -- with an angry and displeased father , and a timorous and distressed mother . He only looked upon Molly as a badly - dressed , and rather awkward girl , with black hair and an intelligent face , who might help him in the task he had set himself of keeping up a bright general conversation during the rest of the evening ; might help him -- if she would , but she would not . She thought him unfeeling in his talkativeness ; his constant flow of words upon indifferent subjects was a wonder and a repulsion to her . How could he go on so cheerfully while his mother sat there , scarcely eating anything , and doing her best , with ill - success , to swallow down the tears that would keep rising to her eyes ; when his father 's heavy brow was deeply clouded , and he evidently cared nothing -- at first at least -- for all the chatter his son poured forth ? Had Mr. Roger Hamley no sympathy in him ? She would show that she had some , at any rate . So she quite declined the part , which he had hoped she would have taken , of respondent , and possible questioner ; and his work became more and more like that of a man walking in a quagmire . Once the Squire roused himself to speak to the butler ; he felt the need of outward stimulus -- of a better vintage than usual . "
42221	42259	41298	41302	a stranger in the household	1619	" He spoke low ; he had no spirit to speak in his usual voice . The butler answered in the same tone . Molly sitting near them , and silent herself , heard what they said . "
42286	42298	42280	42281	Mr. Osborne	234	" The Squire turned round with a growl in his voice . "
42315	42322	42312	42312	I	0	" The butler went away wondering . "
42326	43069	42323	42324	Mr. Osborne	234	" likes and dislikes had been the law of the house in general until now . If he had liked any particular food or drink , any seat or place , any special degree of warmth or coolness , his wishes were to be attended to ; for he was the heir , and he was delicate , and he was the clever one of the family . All the out - of - doors men would have said the same . Mr. Osborne wished a tree cut down , or kept standing , or had such - and - such a fancy about the game , or desired something unusual about the horses ; and they had all to attend to it as if it were law . But to - day the Burgundy with the yellow seal was to be brought ; and it was brought . Molly testified with quiet vehemence of action ; she never took wine , so she need not have been afraid of the man 's pouring it into her glass ; but as an open mark of fealty to the absent Osborne , however little it might be understood , she placed the palm of her small brown hand over the top of the glass , and held it there , till the wine had gone round , and Roger and his father were in full enjoyment of it . After dinner , too , the gentlemen lingered long over their dessert , and Molly heard them laughing ; and then she saw them loitering about in the twilight out - of - doors ; Roger hatless , his hands in his pockets , lounging by his father 's side , who was now able to talk in his usual loud and cheerful way , forgetting Osborne . _ V¾ victis ! _ [ Illustration : V ® VICTIS ! ] And so in mute opposition on Molly 's side , in polite indifference , scarcely verging upon kindliness on his , Roger and she steered clear of each other . He had many occupations in which he needed no companionship , even if she had been qualified to give it . The worst was , that she found he was in the habit of occupying the library , her favourite retreat , in the mornings before Mrs. Hamley came down . She opened the half - closed door a day or two after his return home , and found him busy among books and papers , with which the large leather - covered table was strewn ; and she softly withdrew before he could turn his head and see her , so as to distinguish her from one of the housemaids . He rode out every day , sometimes with his father about the outlying fields , sometimes far away for a good gallop . Molly would have enjoyed accompanying him on these occasions , for she was very fond of riding ; and there had been some talk of sending for her habit and grey pony when first she came to Hamley ; only the Squire , after some consideration , had said he so rarely did more than go slowly from one field to another , where his labourers were at work , that he feared she would find such slow work -- ten minutes riding through heavy land , twenty minutes sitting still on horseback , listening to the directions he should have to give to his men -- rather dull . Now , when if she had had her pony here she might have ridden out with Roger , without giving him any trouble -- she would have taken care of that -- nobody seemed to think of renewing the proposal . Altogether it was pleasanter before he came home . Her father rode over pretty frequently ; sometimes there were long unaccountable absences , it was true ; when his daughter began to fidget after him , and to wonder what had become of him . But when he made his appearance he had always good reasons to give ; and the right she felt that she had to his familiar household tenderness ; the power she possessed of fully understanding the exact value of both his words and his silence , made these glimpses of intercourse with him inexpressibly charming . Latterly her burden had always been , "
43078	43618	43076	43076	papa	7226	" It was not that she was unhappy , or uncomfortable ; she was passionately fond of Mrs. Hamley , she was a favourite of the Squire 's , and could not as yet fully understand why some people were so much afraid of him ; and as for Roger , if he did not add to her pleasure , he scarcely took away from it . But she wanted to be at home once more . The reason why she could not tell ; but this she knew full well . Mr. Gibson reasoned with her till she was weary of being completely convinced that it was right and necessary for her to stay where she was . And then with an effort she stopped the cry upon her tongue , for she saw that its repetition harassed her father . During this absence of hers Mr. Gibson was drifting into matrimony . He was partly aware of whither he was going ; and partly it was like the soft floating movement of a dream . He was more passive than active in the affair ; though , if his reason had not fully approved of the step he was tending to -- if he had not believed that a second marriage was the very best way of cutting the Gordian knot of domestic difficulties , he could have made an effort without any great trouble , and extricated himself without pain from the mesh of circumstances . It happened in this manner:--Lady Cumnor having married her two eldest daughters , found her labours as a chaperone to Lady Harriet , the youngest , considerably lightened by co - operation ; and , at length , she had leisure to be an invalid . She was , however , too energetic to allow herself this indulgence constantly ; only she permitted herself to break down occasionally after a long course of dinners , late hours , and London atmosphere : and then , leaving Lady Harriet with either Lady Cuxhaven or Lady Agnes Manners , she betook herself to the comparative quiet of the Towers , where she found occupation in doing her benevolence , which was sadly neglected in the hurly - burly of London . This particular summer she had broken down earlier than usual , and longed for the repose of the country . She believed that her state of health , too , was more serious than previously ; but she did not say a word of this to her husband or daughters ; reserving her confidence for Mr. Gibson 's ears . She did not wish to take Lady Harriet away from the gaieties of town which she was thoroughly enjoying , by any complaint of hers , which might , after all , be ill - founded ; and yet she did not quite like being without a companion in the three weeks or a month that might intervene before her family would join her at the Towers , especially as the annual festivity to the school visitors was impending ; and both the school and the visit of the ladies connected with it , had rather lost the zest of novelty .

THE WIDOWER AND THE WIDOW . Mrs. Kirkpatrick was only too happy to accept Lady Cumnor 's invitation . It was what she had been hoping for , but hardly daring to expect , as she believed that the family were settled in London for some time to come . The Towers was a pleasant and luxurious house in which to pass her holidays ; and though she was not one to make deep plans , or to look far ahead , she was quite aware of the prestige which her being able to say she had been staying with "
46601	47468	46599	46600	Lady Cumnor	159	" at the Towers , was likely to give her and her school in the eyes of a good many people ; so she gladly prepared to join her ladyship on the 17th . Her wardrobe did not require much arrangement ; if it had done , the poor lady would not have had much money to appropriate to the purpose . She was very pretty and graceful ; and that goes a great way towards carrying off shabby clothes ; and it was her taste more than any depth of feeling , that had made her persevere in wearing all the delicate tints -- the violets and grays -- which , with a certain admixture of black , constitute half - mourning . This style of becoming dress she was supposed to wear in memory of Mr. Kirkpatrick ; in reality because it was both lady - like and economical . Her beautiful hair was of that rich auburn that hardly ever turns gray ; and partly out of consciousness of its beauty , and partly because the washing of caps is expensive , she did not wear anything on her head ; her complexion had the vivid tints that often accompany the kind of hair which has once been red ; and the only injury her skin had received from advancing years was that the colouring was rather more brilliant than delicate , and varied less with every passing emotion . She could no longer blush ; and at eighteen she had been very proud of her blushes . Her eyes were soft , large , and china - blue in colour ; they had not much expression or shadow about them , which was perhaps owing to the flaxen colour of her eyelashes . Her figure was a little fuller than it used to be , but her movements were as soft and sinuous as ever . Altogether , she looked much younger than her age , which was not far short of forty . She had a very pleasant voice , and read aloud well and distinctly , which Lady Cumnor liked . Indeed , for some inexplicable reason , she was a greater , more positive favourite with Lady Cumnor than with any of the rest of the family , though they all liked her up to a certain point , and found it agreeably useful to have any one in the house who was so well acquainted with their ways and habits ; so ready to talk , when a little trickle of conversation was required ; so willing to listen , and to listen with tolerable intelligence , if the subjects spoken about did not refer to serious solid literature , or science , or politics , or social economy . About novels and poetry , travels and gossip , personal details , or anecdotes of any kind , she always made exactly the remarks which are expected from an agreeable listener ; and she had sense enough to confine herself to those short expressions of wonder , admiration , and astonishment , which may mean anything , when more recondite things were talked about . It was a very pleasant change to a poor unsuccessful schoolmistress to leave her own house , full of battered and shabby furniture ( she had taken the good - will and furniture of her predecessor at a valuation , two or three years before ) , where the look - out was as gloomy , and the surrounding as squalid , as is often the case in the smaller streets of a country town , and to come bowling through the Towers Park in the luxurious carriage sent to meet her ; to alight , and feel secure that the well - trained servants would see after her bags , and umbrella , and parasol , and cloak , without her loading herself with all these portable articles , as she had had to do while following the wheelbarrow containing her luggage in going to the Ashcombe coach - office that morning ; to pass up the deep - piled carpets of the broad shallow stairs into my lady 's own room , cool and deliciously fresh , even on this sultry day , and fragrant with great bowls of freshly gathered roses of every shade of colour . There were two or three new novels lying uncut on the table ; the daily papers , the magazines . Every chair was an easy - chair of some kind or other ; and all covered with French chintz that mimicked the real flowers in the garden below . She was familiar with the bedroom called hers , to which she was soon ushered by Lady Cumnor 's maid . It seemed to her far more like home than the dingy place she had left that morning ; it was so natural to her to like dainty draperies , and harmonious colouring , and fine linen , and soft raiment . She sate down in the arm - chair by the bed - side , and wondered over her fate something in this fashion-- "
47786	48020	47783	47784	a widow	7268	" Then there was the contrast between the dinners which she had to share with her scholars at Ashcombe -- rounds of beef , legs of mutton , great dishes of potatoes , and large batter - puddings , with the tiny meal of exquisitely cooked delicacies , sent up on old Chelsea china , that was served every day to the earl and countess and herself at the Towers . She dreaded the end of her holidays as much as the most home - loving of her pupils . But at this time that end was some weeks off , so Clare shut her eyes to the future , and tried to relish the present to its fullest extent . A disturbance to the pleasant , even course of the summer days came in the indisposition of Lady Cumnor . Her husband had gone back to London , and she and Mrs. Kirkpatrick had been left to the very even tenor of life , which was according to my lady 's wish just now . In spite of her languor and fatigue , she had gone through the day when the school visitors came to the Towers , in full dignity , dictating clearly all that was to be done , what walks were to be taken , what hothouses to be seen , and when the party were to return to the "
48023	48086	47783	47784	a widow	7268	" She herself remained indoors , with one or two ladies who had ventured to think that the fatigue or the heat might be too much for them , and who had therefore declined accompanying the ladies in charge of Mrs. Kirkpatrick , or those other favoured few to whom Lord Cumnor was explaining the new buildings in his farm - yard . "
48092	48184	47783	47784	a widow	7268	" as her hearers afterwards expressed it , Lady Cumnor told them all about her married daughters ' establishments , nurseries , plans for the education of their children , and manner of passing the day . But the exertion tired her ; and when every one had left , the probability is that she would have gone to lie down and rest , had not her husband made an unlucky remark in the kindness of his heart . He came up to her and put his hand on her shoulder . "
48196	48212	48188	48188	you	1755	" he said . She braced her muscles , and drew herself up , saying coldly,-- "
48227	48378	48221	48221	I	0	" And her fatigue showed itself during the rest of the evening in her sitting particularly upright , and declining all offers of easy - chairs or foot - stools , and refusing the insult of a suggestion that they should all go to bed earlier . She went on in something of this kind of manner as long as Lord Cumnor remained at the Towers . Mrs. Kirkpatrick was quite deceived by it , and kept assuring Lord Cumnor that she had never seen dear Lady Cumnor looking better , or so strong . But he had an affectionate heart , if a blundering head ; and though he could give no reason for his belief , he was almost certain his wife was not well . Yet he was too much afraid of her to send for Mr. Gibson without her permission . His last words to Clare were-- "
48418	48423	48417	48417	Bradley	267	" ( Lady Cumnor 's "
48425	48432	48417	48417	Bradley	267	woman,"--she disliked the new - fangledness of "

48462	48491	48492	48492	him	158	pretence,"--and then the idea he had had in London of the fitness of a match between the two coming into his head just now , he could not help adding,--"Get
48553	48654	48548	48548	he	158	" But Clare was just as great a coward about doing anything for Lady Cumnor which she had not expressly ordered , as Lord Cumnor himself . She knew she might fall into such disgrace if she sent for Mr. Gibson without direct permission , that she might never be asked to stay at the Towers again ; and the life there , monotonous in its smoothness of luxury as it might be to some , was exactly to her taste . She in her turn tried to put upon Bradley the duty which Lord Cumnor had put upon her . "
48658	48664	48548	48548	he	158	" she said one day , "
48686	48687	48675	48676	Lord Cumnor	162	" "

48866	48886	48852	48852	She	725	" But a day or two after this conversation took place , Lady Cumnor startled Mrs. Kirkpatrick , by saying suddenly,--"Clare
48932	49021	48920	48920	He	158	" Mr. Gibson had been far too busy in his profession to have time for mere visits of ceremony , though he knew quite well he was neglecting what was expected of him . But the district of which he may be said to have had medical charge was full of a bad kind of low fever , which took up all his time and thought , and often made him very thankful that Molly was out of the way in the quiet shades of Hamley . His domestic "
49023	49118	49119	49119	Gibson	158	" had not healed over in the least , though he was obliged to put the perplexities on one side for the time . The last drop -- the final straw , had been an impromptu visit of Lord Hollingford 's , whom he had met in the town one forenoon . They had had a good deal to say to each other about some new scientific discovery , with the details of which Lord Hollingford was well acquainted , while Mr. Gibson was ignorant and deeply interested . At length Lord Hollingford said suddenly,-- "
49151	49414	49416	49419	a man like me	1767	" Now Mr. Gibson was only too much pleased to show hospitality to one whom he liked and respected so much as Lord Hollingford , and he gladly took him home with him to the early family dinner . But it was just at the time when the cook was sulking at Bethia 's dismissal -- and she chose to be unpunctual and careless . There was no successor to Bethia as yet appointed to wait at the meals . So , though Mr. Gibson knew well that bread - and - cheese , cold beef , or the simplest food available , would have been welcome to the hungry lord , he could not get either these things for luncheon , or even the family dinner , at anything like the proper time , in spite of all his ringing , and as much anger as he liked to show , for fear of making Lord Hollingford uncomfortable . At last dinner was ready , but the poor host saw the want of nicety -- almost the want of cleanliness , in all its accompaniments -- dingy plate , dull - looking glass , a table - cloth that , if not absolutely dirty , was anything but fresh in its splashed and rumpled condition , and compared it in his own mind with the dainty delicacy with which even a loaf of brown bread was served up at his guest 's home . He did not apologize directly , but , after dinner , just as they were parting , he said,--"You
49456	49492	49517	49517	somebody	7311	" He made no allusion to the comfortless meal of which they had both partaken , though it was full in his mind . Nor was it absent from Lord Hollingford 's as he made reply,-- "
49525	49526	49522	49523	Miss Gibson	187	" "
49540	49541	49536	49538	a motherless girl	1775	" "
49676	49697	49668	49668	you	187	" Mr. Gibson had thought of this advice several times since it was given ; but it was a case of "

49717	49804	49668	49668	you	187	" Not Miss Browning , nor Miss Phoebe , nor Miss Goodenough . Among his country patients there were two classes pretty distinctly marked : farmers , whose children were unrefined and uneducated ; squires , whose daughters would , indeed , think the world was coming to a pretty pass , if they were to marry a country surgeon . But the first day on which Mr. Gibson paid his visit to Lady Cumnor , he began to think it possible that Mrs. Kirkpatrick was his "
49807	50445	49668	49668	you	187	" He rode away with slack rein , thinking over what he knew of her , more than about the prescriptions he should write , or the way he was going . He remembered her as a very pretty Miss Clare : the governess who had the scarlet fever ; that was in his wife 's days , a long time ago ; he could hardly understand Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's youthfulness of appearance when he thought how long . Then he had heard of her marriage to a curate ; and the next day ( or so it seemed , he could not recollect the exact duration of the interval ) , of his death . He knew , in some way , that she had been living ever since as a governess in different families ; but that she had always been a great favourite with the family at the Towers , for whom , quite independent of their rank , he had a true respect . A year or two ago he had heard that she had taken the good - will of a school at Ashcombe ; a small town close to another property of Lord Cumnor 's , in the same county . Ashcombe was a larger estate than that near Hollingford , but the old Manor - house there was not nearly so good a residence as the Towers ; so it was given up to Mr. Preston , the land - agent for the Ashcombe property , just as Mr. Sheepshanks was for that at Hollingford . There were a few rooms at the Manor - house reserved for the occasional visits of the family , otherwise Mr. Preston , a handsome young bachelor , had it all to himself . Mr. Gibson knew that Mrs. Kirkpatrick had one child , a daughter , who must be much about the same age as Molly . Of course she had very little , if any , property . But he himself had lived carefully , and had a few thousands well invested ; besides which , his professional income was good , and increasing rather than diminishing every year . By the time he had arrived at this point in his consideration of the case , he was at the house of the next patient on his round , and he put away all thought of matrimony and Mrs. Kirkpatrick for the time . Once again , in the course of the day , he remembered with a certain pleasure that Molly had told him some little details connected with her unlucky detention at the Towers five or six years ago , which had made him feel at the time as if Mrs. Kirkpatrick had behaved very kindly to his little girl . So there the matter rested for the present , as far as he was concerned . Lady Cumnor was out of health ; but not so ill as she had been fancying herself during all those days when the people about her dared not send for the doctor . It was a great relief to her to have Mr. Gibson to decide for her what she was to do ; what to eat , drink , avoid . Such decisions _ ab extra _ , are sometimes a wonderful relief to those whose habit it has been to decide , not only for themselves , but for every one else ; and occasionally the relaxation of the strain which a character for infallible wisdom brings with it , does much to restore health . Mrs. Kirkpatrick thought in her secret soul that she had never found it so easy to get on with Lady Cumnor ; and Bradley and she had never done singing the praises of Mr. Gibson , "
50454	50574	50577	50577	Clare	172	" Reports were duly sent up to my lord , but he and his daughters were strictly forbidden to come down . Lady Cumnor wished to be weak and languid , and uncertain both in body and mind , without family observation . It was a condition so different to anything she had ever been in before , that she was unconsciously afraid of losing her prestige , if she was seen in it . Sometimes she herself wrote the daily bulletins ; at other times she bade Clare do it , but she would always see the letters . Any answers she received from her daughters she used to read herself , occasionally imparting some of their contents to "
50579	50675	50577	50577	Clare	172	" But anybody might read my lord 's letters . There was no great fear of family secrets oozing out in his sprawling lines of affection . But once Mrs. Kirkpatrick came upon a sentence in a letter from Lord Cumnor , which she was reading out loud to his wife , that caught her eye before she came to it , and if she could have skipped it and kept it for private perusal , she would gladly have done so . My lady was too sharp for her , though . In her opinion "
50686	50708	50577	50577	Clare	172	" the truth being that she was not always quick at resources , though tolerably unscrupulous in the use of them . "
50733	50740	50577	50577	Clare	172	" Lady Cumnor read , half aloud,-- "

50873	51092	50839	50840	Lord Cumnor	162	" She wondered what Lady Cumnor thought of it . Lord Cumnor wrote as if there was really a chance . It was not an unpleasant idea ; it brought a faint smile out upon her face , as she sat by Lady Cumnor , while the latter took her afternoon nap . CHAPTER X. A CRISIS . [ Illustration ( untitled ) ] Mrs. Kirkpatrick had been reading aloud till Lady Cumnor fell asleep , the book rested on her knee , just kept from falling by her hold . She was looking out of the window , not seeing the trees in the park , nor the glimpses of the hills beyond , but thinking how pleasant it would be to have a husband once more;--some one who would work while she sate at her elegant ease in a prettily - furnished drawing - room ; and she was rapidly investing this imaginary breadwinner with the form and features of the country surgeon , when there was a slight tap at the door , and almost before she could rise , the object of her thoughts came in . She felt herself blush , and she was not displeased at the consciousness . She advanced to meet him , making a sign towards her sleeping ladyship . "

He was only going to make one or two medical inquiries ; she found that out very speedily , and considered the conversation as rather flat to her , though it might be instructive to him . She was not aware that he finally made up his mind to propose , during the time that she was speaking -- answering his questions in many words , but he was accustomed to winnow the chaff from the corn ; and her voice was so soft , her accent so pleasant , that it struck him as particularly agreeable after the broad country accent he was perpetually hearing . Then the harmonious colours of her dress , and her slow and graceful movements , had something of the same soothing effect upon his nerves that a cat 's purring has upon some people 's . He began to think that he should be fortunate if he could win her , for his own sake . Yesterday he had looked upon her more as a possible stepmother for Molly ; to - day he thought more of her as a wife for himself . The remembrance of Lord Cumnor 's letter gave her a very becoming consciousness ; she wished to attract , and hoped that she was succeeding .

52662	52708	52655	52655	I	0	" There was nothing for it , in Mr. Gibson 's opinion , but to make a clean breast of it , and tell her ladyship all . He turned round , and took hold of Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's hand , and said out straight , "

But Lady Cumnor was imperious now , as always . "
53193	53247	53248	53248	I	0	" So there was nothing for it but for them to return to the library ; Mrs. Kirkpatrick pouting a little , and Mr. Gibson feeling more like his own cool , sarcastic self , by many degrees , than he had done when last in that room . She began , half crying,-- "

53321	53365	53306	53306	he	1837	" Altogether , this second tte--tte , done to command , was not so satisfactory as the first ; and Mr. Gibson was quite alive to the necessity of proceeding on his round to see his patients before very much time had elapsed . "

53478	53959	53960	53960	Molly	221	" And then he lost himself in recapitulating Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's good qualities , and the advantages to be gained to his daughter from the step he had just taken . It was too late to go round by Hamley that afternoon . The Towers and the Towers ' round lay just in the opposite direction to Hamley . So it was the next morning before Mr. Gibson arrived at the Hall , timing his visit as well as he could so as to have half - an - hour 's private talk with Molly before Mrs. Hamley came down into the drawing - room . He thought that his daughter would require sympathy after receiving the intelligence he had to communicate ; and he knew there was no one more fit to give it than Mrs. Hamley . It was a brilliantly hot summer 's morning ; men in their shirtsleeves were in the fields getting in the early harvest of oats ; as Mr. Gibson rode slowly along , he could see them over the tall hedge - rows , and even hear the soothing measured sound of the fall of the long swathes , as they were mown . The labourers seemed too hot to talk ; the dog , guarding their coats and cans , lay panting loudly on the other side of the elm , under which Mr. Gibson stopped for an instant to survey the scene , and gain a little delay before the interview that he wished was well over . In another minute he had snapped at himself for his weakness , and put spurs to his horse . He came up to the Hall at a good sharp trot ; it was earlier than the usual time of his visits , and no one was expecting him ; all the stable - men were in the fields , but that signified little to Mr. Gibson ; he walked his horse about for five minutes or so before taking him into the stable , and loosened his girths , examining him with perhaps unnecessary exactitude . He went into the house by a private door , and made his way into the drawing - room , half expecting , however , that Molly would be in the garden . She had been there , but it was too hot and dazzling now for her to remain out of doors , and she had come in by the open window of the drawing - room . Oppressed with the heat , she had fallen asleep in an easy - chair , her bonnet and open book upon her knee , one arm hanging listlessly down . She looked very soft , and young , and childlike ; and a gush of love sprang into her father 's heart as he gazed at her . "
53962	53985	53986	53986	Molly	221	" said he , gently , taking the little brown hand that was hanging down , and holding it in his own . "
53988	54025	53986	53986	Molly	221	" She opened her eyes , that for one moment had no recognition in them . Then the light came brilliantly into them and she sprang up , and threw her arms round his neck , exclaiming,-- "
54054	54098	54045	54045	I	0	" Mr. Gibson turned a little paler than he had been before . He still held her hand , and drew her to a seat by him on a sofa , without speaking . There was no need ; she was chattering away . "
54162	54204	54206	54206	you	7226	" She pulled her hand away , and used both it and the other to turn her father 's head , so that he should exactly see the very bit she meant . She was rather struck by his unusual silence . "

54301	54323	54298	54299	little woman	1173	" ( He felt that he was doing his business very awkwardly , but he was determined to plunge on . ) "

54335	54359	54333	54333	I	0	" said she ; but her tone was changed , and she was evidently uneasy , as with the presage of an instinct . "
54368	54377	54362	54362	you	1173	" said he , again taking her hand , "
54422	54423	54413	54413	I	0	" "
54430	54446	54427	54428	Miss Eyre	201	" said she , sick with the strengthening indefinite presage of what was to come . "

54528	54551	54520	54520	You	201	" said she , helping him out , with a quiet dry voice , and gently drawing her hand out of his . "
54585	54775	54570	54570	You	201	" She did not answer . She could not tell what words to use . She was afraid of saying anything , lest the passion of anger , dislike , indignation -- whatever it was that was boiling up in her breast -- should find vent in cries and screams , or worse , in raging words that could never be forgotten . It was as if the piece of solid ground on which she stood had broken from the shore , and she was drifting out to the infinite sea alone . Mr. Gibson saw that her silence was unnatural , and half - guessed at the cause of it . But he knew that she must have time to reconcile herself to the idea , and still believed that it would be for her eventual happiness . He had , besides , the relief of feeling that the secret was told , the confidence made , which he had been dreading for the last twenty - four hours . He went on recapitulating all the advantages of the marriage ; he knew them off by heart now . "
54879	54894	54895	54895	She	1861	" No remark from her on this little bit of playfulness . He went on,-- "
54977	54987	54942	54942	she	1861	" Still she was silent . At length she said,-- "
55007	55080	55083	55083	papa	7226	" Out of the bitterness of her heart she spoke , but she was roused out of her assumed impassiveness by the effect produced . Her father started up , and quickly left the room , saying something to himself -- what , she could not hear , though she ran after him , followed him through dark stone passages , into the glare of the stable - yard , into the stables-- "
55103	55135	55136	55136	I	0	" He led his horse out . She did not know if he heard her words . Just as he mounted , he turned round upon her with a grey grim face-- "
55230	56326	55228	55228	Molly	221	" For many minutes after he had ridden away -- long after the sound of his horse 's hoofs on the round stones of the paved lane , beyond the home - meadows , had died away -- Molly stood there , shading her eyes , and looking at the empty space of air in which his form had last appeared . Her very breath seemed suspended ; only , two or three times , after long intervals , she drew a miserable sigh , which was caught up into a sob . She turned away at last , but could not go into the house , could not tell Mrs. Hamley , could not forget how her father had looked and spoken -- and left her . She went out through a side - door -- it was the way by which the gardeners passed when they took the manure into the garden -- and the walk to which it led was concealed from sight as much as possible by shrubs and evergreens and over - arching trees . No one would know what became of her -- and , with the ingratitude of misery , she added to herself , no one would care . Mrs. Hamley had her own husband , her own children , her close home interests -- she was very good and kind , but there was a bitter grief in Molly 's heart , with which the stranger could not intermeddle . She went quickly on to the bourne which she had fixed for herself -- a seat almost surrounded by the drooping leaves of a weeping - ash -- a seat on the long broad terrace walk on the other side of the wood , that overlooked the pleasant slope of the meadows beyond . The walk had probably been made to command this sunny , peaceful landscape , with trees , and a church spire , two or three red - tiled roofs of old cottages , and a purple bit of rising ground in the distance ; and at some previous date , when there might have been a large family of Hamleys residing at the Hall , ladies in hoops , and gentlemen in bag - wigs with swords by their sides , might have filled up the breadth of the terrace , as they sauntered , smiling , along . But no one ever cared to saunter there now . It was a deserted walk . The squire or his sons might cross it in passing to a little gate that led to the meadow beyond ; but no one loitered there . Molly almost thought that no one knew of the hidden seat under the ash - tree but herself ; for there were not more gardeners employed upon the grounds than were necessary to keep the kitchen - gardens and such of the ornamental part as was frequented by the family , or in sight of the house , in good order . When she had once got to the seat she broke out with suppressed passion of grief . She did not care to analyze the sources of her tears and sobs -- her father was going to be married again -- her father was angry with her ; she had done very wrong -- he had gone away displeased ; she had lost his love ; he was going to be married -- away from her -- away from his child -- his little daughter -- forgetting her own dear , dear mother . So she thought in a tumultuous kind of way , sobbing till she was wearied out , and had to gain strength by being quiet for a time , to break forth into her passion of tears afresh . She had cast herself on the ground -- that natural throne for violent sorrow -- and leant up against the old moss - grown seat ; sometimes burying her face in her hands ; sometimes clasping them together , as if by the tight painful grasp of her fingers she could deaden mental suffering . She did not see Roger Hamley returning from the meadows , nor hear the click of the little white gate . He had been out dredging in ponds and ditches , and had his wet sling - net , with its imprisoned treasures of nastiness , over his shoulder . He was coming home to lunch , having always a fine midday appetite , though he pretended to despise the meal in theory . But he knew that his mother liked his companionship then ; she depended much upon her luncheon , and was seldom downstairs and visible to her family much before the time . So he overcame his theory , for the sake of his mother , and had his reward in the hearty relish with which he kept her company in eating . He did not see Molly as he crossed the terrace - walk on his way homewards . He had gone about twenty yards along the small wood - path at right angles to the terrace , when , looking among the grass and wild plants under the trees , he spied out one which was rare , one which he had been long wishing to find in flower , and saw it at last , with those bright keen eyes of his . Down went his net , skilfully twisted so as to retain its contents , while it lay amid the herbage , and he himself went with light and well - planted footsteps in search of the treasure . He was so great a lover of nature that , without any thought , but habitually , he always avoided treading unnecessarily on any plant ; who knew what long - sought growth or insect might develop itself in that which now appeared but insignificant ? His steps led him in the direction of the ash - tree seat , much less screened from observation on this side than on the terrace . He stopped ; he saw a light - coloured dress on the ground -- somebody half - lying on the seat , so still just then , he wondered if the person , whoever it was , had fallen ill or fainted . He paused to watch . In a minute or two the sobs broke out again -- the words . It was Miss Gibson crying out in a broken voice,-- "
56340	56512	56331	56331	papa	7226	" For a minute or two he thought it would be kinder to leave her fancying herself unobserved ; he had even made a retrograde step or two , on tip - toe ; but then he heard the miserable sobbing again . It was farther than his mother could walk , or else , be the sorrow what it would , she was the natural comforter of this girl , her visitor . However , whether it was right or wrong , delicate or obtrusive , when he heard the sad voice talking again , in such tones of uncomforted , lonely misery , he turned back , and went to the green tent under the ash - tree . She started up when he came thus close to her ; she tried to check her sobs , and instinctively smoothed her wet tangled hair back with her hands . He looked down upon her with grave , kind sympathy , but he did not know exactly what to say . "
56519	56557	56558	56558	I	0	" said she , trying to believe that he did not see the traces of her tears and the disturbance of her features -- that he had not seen her lying , sobbing her heart out there . "
56633	56680	56754	56754	you	1882	" She had exhausted herself so much with crying , that she felt as if she could neither stand nor walk just yet . She sate down on the seat , and sighed , and turned so pale , he thought she was going to faint . "
56685	56752	56754	56754	you	1882	" said he,--quite unnecessarily , for she could not have stirred,--and he was off like a shot to some spring of water that he knew of in the wood , and in a minute or two he returned with careful steps , bringing a little in a broad green leaf , turned into an impromptu cup . Little as it was , it did her good . "
56756	56760	56754	56754	you	1882	" she said : "
56776	56777	56778	56778	You	1882	" "

56808	56852	56793	56793	me	0	" So they remained in silence for a little while ; he , breaking off and examining one or two abnormal leaves of the ash - tree , partly from the custom of his nature , partly to give her time to recover . "
56861	56980	56793	56793	me	0	" said she , at length . She could not have said why she told him this ; an instant before she spoke , she had no intention of doing so . He dropped the leaf he held in his hand , turned round , and looked at her . Her poor wistful eyes were filling with tears as they met his , with a dumb appeal for sympathy . Her look was much more eloquent than her words . There was a momentary pause before he replied , and then it was more because he felt that he must say something than that he was in any doubt as to the answer to the question he asked . "
56987	57005	56981	56981	You	1885	" She did not take her eyes away from his , as her quivering lips formed the word "
57008	57090	56981	56981	You	1885	" though her voice made no sound . He was silent again now ; looking on the ground , kicking softly at a loose pebble with his foot . His thoughts did not come readily to the surface in the shape of words ; nor was he apt at giving comfort till he saw his way clear to the real source from which consolation must come . At last he spoke,--almost as if he was reasoning out the matter with himself . "
57135	57152	57131	57131	I	0	" said he , in a different tone of voice , and looking at Molly afresh , "

57261	57287	57254	57254	he	1253	" Roger began kicking the pebble again . He had not got hold of the right end of the clue . Suddenly he looked up . "
57452	57504	57450	57450	you	1890	" She was listening , but she had no heart to say anything . Yet she was interested in this little story of Harriet -- a girl who had been so much to her father , more than Molly in this early youth of hers could have been to Mr. Gibson . "
57509	57516	57450	57450	you	1890	" she sighed out at last . "
57531	57554	57525	57525	she	179	" Roger answered , with something of severe brevity . Molly needed the bracing . She began to cry again a little . "
57562	57563	57564	57564	He	7226	" "
57679	57680	57685	57685	she	813	" "
57690	57807	57685	57685	she	813	" murmured Molly , a waft of recollection bringing to her mind the details of her day at the Towers long ago . Roger did not want to hear Molly 's reasons for this doubting speech . He felt as if he had no right to hear more of Mr. Gibson 's family life , past , present , or to come , than was absolutely necessary for him , in order that he might comfort and help the crying girl , whom he had come upon so unexpectedly . And besides , he wanted to go home , and be with his mother at lunch - time . Yet he could not leave her alone . "
57903	58093	58094	58094	You	1922	" He appeared to be waiting for her to get up and come along with him , as indeed he was . But he meant her to perceive that he should not leave her ; so she rose up languidly , too languid to say how much she should prefer being left alone , if he would only go away without her . She was very weak , and stumbled over the straggling root of a tree that projected across the path . He , watchful though silent , saw this stumble , and putting out his hand held her up from falling . He still held her hand when the occasion was past ; this little physical failure impressed on his heart how young and helpless she was , and he yearned to her , remembering the passion of sorrow in which he had found her , and longing to be of some little tender bit of comfort to her , before they parted -- before their tte--tte walk was merged in the general familiarity of the household life . Yet he did not know what to say . "
58101	58123	58094	58094	You	1922	" he burst out at length , as they were nearing the drawing - room windows and the garden - door . "

58235	58353	58229	58229	I	0	" under her breath , and then she broke away , and ran indoors , and upstairs to the solitude of her own room . He went straight to his mother , who was sitting before the untasted luncheon , as much annoyed by the mysterious unpunctuality of her visitor as she was capable of being with anything ; for she had heard that Mr. Gibson had been , and was gone , and she could not discover if he had left any message for her ; and her anxiety about her own health , which some people esteemed hypochondriacal , always made her particularly craving for the wisdom which might fall from her doctor 's lips .

She had bathed her eyes , and arranged her hair ; and was making a great struggle to keep from crying , and to bring her voice into order . She was unwilling to distress Mrs. Hamley by the sight of pain and suffering . She did not know that she was following Roger 's injunction to think more of others than of herself -- but so she was . Mrs. Hamley was not sure if it was wise in her to begin on the piece of news she had just heard from her son ; but she was too full of it herself to talk of anything else . "

His mother had such sweet power of sympathy , that she would draw the sting out of the girl 's heart when she had her alone .

Her sorrow was not now for the fact that her father was going to be married again , but for her own ill - behaviour . If Roger was not tender in words , he was in deeds . Unreasonable and possibly exaggerated as Molly 's grief had appeared to him , it was real suffering to her ; and he took some pains to lighten it , in his own way , which was characteristic enough . That evening he adjusted his microscope , and put the treasures he had collected in his morning 's ramble on a little table ; and then he asked his mother to come and admire . Of course Molly came too , and this was what he had intended . He tried to interest her in his pursuit , cherished her first little morsel of curiosity , and nursed it into a very proper desire for further information . Then he brought out books on the subject , and translated the slightly pompous and technical language into homely every - day speech . Molly had come down to dinner , wondering how the long hours till bedtime would ever pass away : hours during which she must not speak on the one thing that would be occupying her mind to the exclusion of all others ; for she was afraid that already she had wearied Mrs. Hamley with it during their afternoon tte--tte . But prayers and bedtime came long before she expected ; she had been refreshed by a new current of thought , and she was very thankful to Roger . And now there was to - morrow to come , and a confession of penitence to be made to her father . But Mr. Gibson did not want speech or words . He was not fond of expressions of feeling at any time , and perhaps , too , he felt that the less said the better on a subject about which it was evident that his daughter and he were not thoroughly and impulsively in harmony . He read her repentance in her eyes ; he saw how much she had suffered ; and he had a sharp pang at his heart in consequence .

Mr. Gibson believed that Cynthia Kirkpatrick was to return to England to be present at her mother 's wedding ; but Mrs. Kirkpatrick had no such intention . She was not what is commonly called a woman of determination ; but somehow what she disliked she avoided , and what she liked she tried to do , or to have . So although in the conversation , which she had already led to , as to the when and the how she was to be married , she had listened quietly to Mr. Gibson 's proposal that Molly and Cynthia should be the two bridesmaids , still she had felt how disagreeable it would be to her to have her young daughter flashing out her beauty by the side of the faded bride , her mother ; and as the further arrangements for the wedding became more definite , she saw further reasons in her own mind for Cynthia 's remaining quietly at her school at Boulogne . Mrs. Kirkpatrick had gone to bed that first night of her engagement to Mr. Gibson , fully anticipating a speedy marriage . She looked to it as a release from the thraldom of keeping school -- keeping an unprofitable school , with barely pupils enough to pay for house rent and taxes , food , washing , and the requisite masters . She saw no reason for ever going back to Ashcombe , except to wind up her affairs , and to pack up her clothes . She hoped that Mr. Gibson 's ardour would be such that he would press on the marriage , and urge her never to resume her school drudgery , but to relinquish it now and for ever . She even made up a very pretty , very passionate speech for him in her own mind ; quite sufficiently strong to prevail upon her , and to overthrow the scruples which she felt she ought to have , at telling the parents of her pupils that she did not intend to resume school , and that they must find another place of education for their daughters , in the last week but one of the midsummer holidays . It was rather like a douche of cold water on Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's plans , when the next morning at breakfast Lady Cumnor began to decide upon the arrangements and duties of the two middle - aged lovers .

To Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's dismay , she found that Mr. Gibson had no more idea than Lady Cumnor of her breaking faith with the parents of her pupils . Though he really was at a serious loss as to what was to become of Molly till she could be under the protection of his new wife at her own home , and though his domestic worries teased him more and more every day , he was too honourable to think of persuading Mrs. Kirkpatrick to give up school a week sooner than was right for his sake . He did not even perceive how easy the task of persuasion would be ; with all her winning wiles she could scarcely lead him to feel impatience for the wedding to take place at Michaelmas . "

This plan did not quite suit Mrs. Kirkpatrick : but she thought it best not to oppose it , until she had a presentable excuse to give , and perhaps also some reason would naturally arise out of future circumstances ; so at this time she only smiled , and softly pressed the hand she held in hers . It is a question whether Mrs. Kirkpatrick or Molly wished the most for the day to be over which they were to spend together at the Towers . Mrs. Kirkpatrick was rather weary of girls as a class . All the trials of her life were connected with girls in some way . She was very young when she first became a governess , and had been worsted in her struggles with her pupils , in the first place she ever went to . Her elegance of appearance and manner , and her accomplishments , more than her character and acquirements , had rendered it easier for her than for most to obtain good "
61561	61659	61365	61365	She	265	" and she had been absolutely petted in some ; but still she was constantly encountering naughty or stubborn , or over - conscientious , or severe - judging , or curious and observant girls . And again , before Cynthia was born , she had longed for a boy , thinking it possible that if some three or four intervening relations died , he might come to be a baronet ; and instead of a son , lo and behold it was a daughter ! Nevertheless , with all her dislike to girls in the abstract as "
61665	61683	61684	61685	young ladies	2000	" ( and her aversion was not diminished by the fact of her having kept a school for "
61686	61808	61809	61809	I	0	" at Ashcombe ) , she really meant to be as kind as she could be to her new step - daughter , whom she remembered principally as a black - haired , sleepy child , in whose eyes she had read admiration of herself . Mrs. Kirkpatrick accepted Mr. Gibson principally because she was tired of the struggle of earning her own livelihood ; but she liked him personally -- nay , she even loved him in her torpid way , and she intended to be good to his daughter , though she felt as if it would have been easier for her to have been good to his son . Molly was bracing herself up in her way too . "
61828	61907	61821	61821	I	0	" she kept repeating all the way to the Towers . But there was no selfishness in wishing that the day was come to an end , and that she did very heartily . Mrs. Hamley sent her thither in the carriage , which was to wait and bring her back at night . Mrs. Hamley wanted Molly to make a favourable impression , and she sent for her to come and show herself before she set out . "

Her father was to meet her there ; but he had been detained , and she had to face Mrs. Kirkpatrick by herself , the recollection of her last day of misery at the Towers fresh in her mind as if it had been yesterday . Mrs. Kirkpatrick was as caressing as could be . She held Molly 's hand in hers , as they sate together in the library , after the first salutations were over . She kept stroking it from time to time , and purring out inarticulate sounds of loving satisfaction , as she gazed in the blushing face . [ Illustration : THE NEW MAMMA . ] "

She had not watched and loved him so long without believing that she understood him better than any one else : though how he had come to like Mrs. Kirkpatrick enough to wish to marry her , was an unsolved problem that she unconsciously put aside as inexplicable . Mrs. Kirkpatrick went on,--"All

Every small occurrence is an event in the day of a convalescent invalid , and a little while ago Molly would have met with patronizing appreciation , where now she had to encounter criticism . Of Lady Cumnor 's character as an individual she knew nothing ; she only knew she was going to see and be seen by a live countess ; nay , more , by "
63863	63885	63890	63891	Lady Cumnor	159	" of Hollingford . Mrs. Kirkpatrick led her into Lady Cumnor 's presence by the hand , and in presenting her , said,--"My

63968	64036	64041	64041	I	0	" Molly very heartily hoped that she might never be known any better by the stern - looking lady who sate so upright in the easy chair , prepared for lounging , and which therefore gave all the more effect to the stiff attitude . Lady Cumnor luckily took Molly 's silence for acquiescent humility , and went on speaking after a further little pause of inspection . "
64099	64103	64105	64105	she	159	Clare!"--a sudden thought striking her,--"you
64190	64526	64527	64527	I	0	" Now it would be difficult to say which of Lady Cumnor 's two hearers was the most dismayed at the idea which had taken possession of her . Mrs. Kirkpatrick had no fancy for being encumbered with a step - daughter before her time . If Molly came to be an inmate of her house , farewell to many little background economies , and a still more serious farewell to many little indulgences , that were innocent enough in themselves , but which Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's former life had caused her to look upon as sins to be concealed : the dirty dog's - eared delightful novel from the Ashcombe circulating library , the leaves of which she turned over with a pair of scissors ; the lounging - chair which she had for use at her own home , straight and upright as she sate now in Lady Cumnor 's presence ; the dainty morsel , savoury and small , to which she treated herself for her own solitary supper,--all these and many other similarly pleasant things would have to be foregone if Molly came to be her pupil , parlour - boarder , or visitor , as Lady Cumnor was planning . One -- two things Clare was instinctively resolved upon : to be married at Michaelmas , and not to have Molly at Ashcombe . But she smiled as sweetly as if the plan proposed was the most charming project in the world , while all the time her poor brains were beating about in every bush for the reasons or excuses of which she should make use at some future time . Molly , however , saved her all this trouble . It was a question which of the three was the most surprised by the words which burst out of her lips . She did not mean to speak , but her heart was very full , and almost before she was aware of her thought she heard herself saying,-- "
64572	64607	64608	64608	I	0	" she went on , her eyes full of tears ; and , turning to Mrs. Kirkpatrick , she put her hand into her future stepmother 's with the prettiest and most trustful action . "
64649	64766	64767	64767	my	0	" Mrs. Kirkpatrick fondled the hand thus placed in hers , and was grateful to the girl for her outspoken opposition to Lady Cumnor 's plan . Clare was , however , exceedingly unwilling to back up Molly by any words of her own until Lady Cumnor had spoken and given the cue . But there was something in Molly 's little speech , or in her straightforward manner , that amused instead of irritating Lady Cumnor in her present mood . Perhaps she was tired of the silkiness with which she had been shut up for so many days . She put up her glasses , and looked at them both before speaking . Then she said--"Upon
64835	64988	64989	64989	You	2077	" Molly almost felt as if she could make a friend of the stiff old countess , for her clearness of sight as to the plan proposed being a trial ; but she was afraid , in her new - born desire of thinking for others , of Mrs. Kirkpatrick being hurt . She need not have feared as far as outward signs went , for the smile was still on that lady 's pretty rosy lips , and the soft fondling of her hand never stopped . Lady Cumnor was more interested in Molly the more she looked at her ; and her gaze was pretty steady through her gold - rimmed eye - glasses . She began a sort of catechism ; a string of very straightforward questions , such as any lady under the rank of countess might have scrupled to ask , but which were not unkindly meant . "

65226	65724	65726	65726	you	2086	" Molly did not speak , but it was by a strong effort that she kept silence . Mrs. Kirkpatrick fondled her hand more perseveringly than ever , hoping thus to express a sufficient amount of sympathy to prevent her from saying anything injudicious . But the caress had become wearisome to Molly , and only irritated her nerves . She took her hand out of Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's , with a slight manifestation of impatience . It was , perhaps , fortunate for the general peace that just at this moment Mr. Gibson was announced . It is odd enough to see how the entrance of a person of the opposite sex into an assemblage of either men or women calms down the little discordances and the disturbance of mood . It was the case now ; at Mr. Gibson 's entrance my lady took off her glasses , and smoothed her brow ; Mrs. Kirkpatrick managed to get up a very becoming blush , and as for Molly , her face glowed with delight , and the white teeth and pretty dimples came out like sunlight on a landscape . Of course , after the first greeting , my lady had to have a private interview with her doctor ; and Molly and her future stepmother wandered about in the gardens with their arms round each other 's waists , or hand in hand , like two babes in the wood ; Mrs. Kirkpatrick active in such endearments , Molly passive , and feeling within herself very shy and strange ; for she had that particular kind of shy modesty which makes any one uncomfortable at receiving caresses from a person towards whom the heart does not go forth with an impulsive welcome . Then came the early dinner ; Lady Cumnor having hers in the quiet of her own room , to which she was still a prisoner . Once or twice during the meal , the idea crossed Molly 's mind that her father disliked his position as a middle - aged lover being made so evident to the men in waiting as it was by Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's affectionate speeches and innuendos . He tried to banish every tint of pink sentimentalism from the conversation , and to confine it to matter of fact ; and when Mrs. Kirkpatrick would persevere in referring to such things as had a bearing on the future relationship of the parties , he insisted upon viewing them in the most matter - of - fact way ; and this continued even after the men had left the room . An old rhyme Molly had heard Betty use , would keep running in her head and making her uneasy,-- Two is company , Three is trumpery . But where could she go to in that strange house ? What ought she to do ? She was roused from this fit of wonder and abstraction by her father 's saying--"What
65755	65842	65738	65738	she	159	" Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's countenance fell . If only Molly would be so good as to testify again , as she had done before Lady Cumnor ! But if the proposal was made by her father , it would come to his daughter from a different quarter than it had done from a strange lady , be she ever so great . Molly did not say anything ; she only looked pale , and wistful , and anxious . Mrs. Kirkpatrick had to speak for herself . "

65949	66243	65929	65929	I	0	" said Mr. Gibson , eagerly . For the more he knew of his future wife , the more he felt it necessary to remember that , with all her foibles , she would be able to stand between Molly and any such adventures as that which had occurred lately with Mr. Coxe ; so that one of the good reasons for the step he had taken was always present to him , while it had slipped off the smooth surface of Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's mirror - like mind without leaving any impression . She now recalled it , on seeing Mr. Gibson 's anxious face . But what were Molly 's feelings at these last words of her father 's ? She had been sent from home for some reason , kept a secret from her , but told to this strange woman . Was there to be perfect confidence between these two , and she to be for ever shut out ? Was she , and what concerned her -- though how she did not know -- to be discussed between them for the future , and she to be kept in the dark ? A bitter pang of jealousy made her heart - sick . She might as well go to Ashcombe , or anywhere else , now . Thinking more of others ' happiness than of her own was very fine ; but did it not mean giving up her very individuality , quenching all the warm love , the true desires , that made her herself ? Yet in this deadness lay her only comfort ; or so it seemed . Wandering in such mazes , she hardly knew how the conversation went on ; a third was indeed "
66246	66424	65929	65929	I	0	" where there was entire confidence between the two who were company , from which the other was shut out . She was positively unhappy , and her father did not appear to see it ; he was absorbed with his new plans and his new wife that was to be . But he did notice it ; and was truly sorry for his little girl : only he thought that there was a greater chance for the future harmony of the household , if he did not lead Molly to define her present feelings by putting them into words . It was his general plan to repress emotion by not showing the sympathy he felt . Yet , when he had to leave , he took Molly 's hand in his , and held it there , in such a different manner to that in which Mrs. Kirkpatrick had done ; and his voice softened to his child as he bade her good - by , and added the words ( most unusual to him ) , "

Then she tried in vain to smooth her face into smiles , and do away with the other signs of her grief . She only hoped she could run upstairs to her own room without notice , and bathe her eyes in cold water before she was seen . But at the Hall - door she was caught by the squire and Roger coming in from an after - dinner stroll in the garden , and hospitably anxious to help her to alight . Roger saw the state of things in an instant , and saying,-- "
66599	66639	66584	66585	My mother	1883	" he led the way to the drawing - room . But Mrs. Hamley was not there ; the Squire had stopped to speak to the coachman about one of the horses ; they two were alone . Roger said,-- "

66674	66690	66672	66672	you	0	" said she , her lips trembling , and on the point of crying again . "

66727	66838	66721	66721	you	0	" said he , gravely . He was gratified by her simple confession of having borne his words of advice in mind , and tried to act up to them . He was but a very young man , and he was honestly flattered ; perhaps this led him on to offer more advice , and this time it was evidently mingled with sympathy . He did not want to draw out her confidence , which he felt might very easily be done with such a simple girl ; but he wished to help her by giving her a few of the principles on which he had learnt to rely .

66947	66993	66940	66940	I	0	" There was an unconscious depth in what she said , that Roger did not know how to answer at the moment ; it was easier to address himself to the assertion of the girl of seventeen , that she should never be happy again . "

Nor did he tell himself why a sudden pleasure came over him as he gazed at her simple expressive face -- and for a moment lost the sense of what she was saying , in the sensation of pity for her sad earnestness . In an instant more he was himself again . Only it is pleasant to the wisest , most reasonable youth of one or two and twenty to find himself looked up to as a Mentor by a girl of seventeen . "
67261	67279	67311	67311	she	1883	" Molly opened her eyes wide at this . Had she been talking metaphysics without knowing it ? "
67320	67569	67311	67311	she	1883	" And the _ tte--tte _ was merged in a trio . Mrs. Hamley lay down ; she had not been well all day -- she had missed Molly , she said,--and now she wanted to hear of all the adventures that had occurred to the girl at the Towers . Molly sate on a stool close to the head of the sofa , and Roger , though at first he took up a book and tried to read that he might be no restraint , soon found his reading all a pretence : it was so interesting to listen to Molly 's little narrative , and , besides , if he could give her any help in her time of need , was it not his duty to make himself acquainted with all the circumstances of her case ? And so they went on during all the remaining time of Molly 's stay at Hamley . Mrs. Hamley sympathized , and liked to hear details ; as the French say , her sympathy was given _ en dtail _ , the Squire 's _ en gros _ . He was very sorry for her evident grief , and almost felt guilty , as if he had had a share in bringing it about , by the mention he had made of the possibility of Mr. Gibson 's marrying again , when first Molly came on her visit to them . He said to his wife more than once,-- "
67717	68016	68017	68017	I	0	" Roger tried hard to find out a reasonable and right method of comfort , for he , too , in his way , was sorry for the girl , who bravely struggled to be cheerful , in spite of her own private grief , for his mother 's sake . He felt as if high principle and noble precept ought to perform an immediate work . But they do not , for there is always the unknown quantity of individual experience and feeling , which offer a tacit resistance , the amount incalculable by another , to all good counsel and high decree . But the bond between the Mentor and his Telemachus strengthened every day . He endeavoured to lead her out of morbid thought into interest in other than personal things ; and , naturally enough , his own objects of interest came readiest to hand . She felt that he did her good , she did not know why or how ; but after a talk with him , she always fancied that she had got the clue to goodness and peace , whatever befell . CHAPTER XII . PREPARING FOR THE WEDDING . [ Illustration ( untitled ) ] Meanwhile the love - affairs between the middle - aged couple were prospering well , after a fashion ; after the fashion that they liked best , although it might probably have appeared dull and prosaic to younger people . Lord Cumnor had come down in great glee at the news he had heard from his wife at the Towers . He , too , seemed to think he had taken an active part in bringing about the match by only speaking about it . His first words on the subject to Lady Cumnor were,-- "

She had a harder task in setting aside Mr. Gibson 's desire to have Cynthia over for the wedding , even if she went back to her school at Boulogne directly after the ceremony . At first she had said that it would be delightful , a charming plan ; only she feared that she must give up her own wishes to have her child near her at such a time , on account of the expense of the double journey . But Mr. Gibson , economical as he was in his habitual expenditure , had a really generous heart . He had already shown it , in entirely relinquishing his future wife 's life - interest in the very small property the late Mr. Kirkpatrick had left , in favour of Cynthia ; while he arranged that she should come to his home as a daughter as soon as she left the school she was at . The life - interest was about thirty pounds a year . Now he gave Mrs. Kirkpatrick three five - pound notes , saying that he hoped they would do away with the objections to Cynthia 's coming over to the wedding ; and at the time Mrs. Kirkpatrick felt as if they would , and caught the reflection of his strong wish , and fancied it was her own . If the letter could have been written and the money sent off that day while the reflected glow of affection lasted , Cynthia would have been bridesmaid to her mother . But a hundred little interruptions came in the way of letter - writing ; and by the next day maternal love had diminished ; and the value affixed to the money had increased : money had been so much needed , so hardly earned in Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's life ; while the perhaps necessary separation of mother and child had lessened the amount of affection the former had to bestow . So she persuaded herself , afresh , that it would be unwise to disturb Cynthia at her studies ; to interrupt the fulfilment of her duties just after the _ semestre _ had begun afresh ; and she wrote a letter to Madame Lefevre so well imbued with this persuasion , that an answer which was almost an echo of her words was returned , the sense of which being conveyed to Mr. Gibson , who was no great French scholar , settled the vexed question , to his moderate but unfeigned regret . But the fifteen pounds were not returned . Indeed , not merely that sum , but a great part of the hundred which Lord Cumnor had given her for her trousseau , was required to pay off debts at Ashcombe ; for the school had been anything but flourishing since Mrs. Kirkpatrick had had it . It was really very much to her credit that she preferred clearing herself from debt to purchasing wedding finery . But it was one of the few points to be respected in Mrs. Kirkpatrick that she had always been careful in payment to the shops where she dealt ; it was a little sense of duty cropping out . Whatever other faults might arise from her superficial and flimsy character , she was always uneasy till she was out of debt . Yet she had no scruple in appropriating her future husband 's money to her own use , when it was decided that it was not to be employed as he intended . What new articles she bought for herself , were all such as would make a show , and an impression upon the ladies of Hollingford . She argued with herself that linen , and all under - clothing , would never be seen ; while she knew that every gown she had , would give rise to much discussion , and would be counted up in the little town . So her stock of underclothing was very small , and scarcely any of it new ; but it was made of dainty material , and was finely mended up by her deft fingers , many a night long after her pupils were in bed ; inwardly resolving all the time she sewed , that hereafter some one else should do her plain - work . Indeed , many a little circumstance of former subjection to the will of others rose up before her during these quiet hours , as an endurance or a suffering never to occur again . So apt are people to look forward to a different kind of life from that to which they have been accustomed , as being free from care and trial ! She recollected how , one time during this very summer at the Towers , after she was engaged to Mr. Gibson , when she had taken above an hour to arrange her hair in some new mode carefully studied from Mrs. Bradley 's fashion - book -- after all , when she came down , looking her very best , as she thought , and ready for her lover , Lady Cumnor had sent her back again to her room , just as if she had been a little child , to do her hair over again , and not to make such a figure of fun of herself ! Another time she had been sent to change her gown for one in her opinion far less becoming , but which suited Lady Cumnor 's taste better . These were little things ; but they were late samples of what in different shapes she had had to endure for many years ; and her liking for Mr. Gibson grew in proportion to her sense of the evils from which he was going to serve as a means of escape . After all , that interval of hope and plain - sewing , intermixed though it was with tuition , was not disagreeable . Her wedding - dress was secure . Her former pupils at the Towers were going to present her with that ; they were to dress her from head to foot on the auspicious day . Lord Cumnor , as has been said , had given her a hundred pounds for her trousseau , and had sent Mr. Preston a carte - blanche order for the wedding - breakfast in the old hall in Ashcombe Manor - house . Lady Cumnor -- a little put out by the marriage not being deferred till her grandchildren 's Christmas holidays -- had nevertheless given Mrs. Kirkpatrick an excellent English - made watch and chain ; more clumsy but more serviceable than the little foreign elegance that had hung at her side so long , and misled her so often . Her preparations were thus in a very considerable state of forwardness , while Mr. Gibson had done nothing as yet towards any new arrangement or decoration of his house for his intended bride . He knew he ought to do something . But what ? Where to begin , when so much was out of order , and he had so little time for superintendence ? At length he came to the wise decision of asking one of the Miss Brownings , for old friendship 's sake , to take the trouble of preparing what was immediately requisite ; and resolved to leave all the more ornamental decorations that he proposed , to the taste of his future wife . But before making his request to the Miss Brownings , he had to tell them of his engagement , which had hitherto been kept a secret from the townspeople , who had set down his frequent visits at the Towers to the score of the countess 's health . He felt how he should have laughed in his sleeve at any middle - aged widower who came to him with a confession of the kind he had now to make to Miss Brownings , and disliked the idea of the necessary call : but it was to be done , so one evening he went in "
70078	70126	68659	68659	her	172	" as they called it , and told them his story . At the end of the first chapter -- that is to say , at the end of the story of Mr. Coxe 's calf - love , Miss Browning held up her hands in surprise . "

Phoebe played nervously with the strings of her black silk apron . Like the Caliph in the Eastern story , a whole lifetime of possibilities passed through her mind in an instant , of which possibilities the question of questions was , Could she leave her sister ? Attend , Phoebe , to the present moment , and listen to what is being said before you distress yourself with a perplexity which will never arise . "

The disposal of money involved patronage of trades people , such as she had exercised in her father 's lifetime , but had had very little chance of showing since his death . Her usual good - humour was quite restored by this proof of confidence in her taste and economy , while Miss Phoebe 's imagination dwelt rather on the pleasure of a visit from Molly . CHAPTER XIII . MOLLY GIBSON 'S NEW FRIENDS . Time was speeding on ; it was now the middle of August,--if anything was to be done to the house , it must be done at once . Indeed , in several ways Mr. Gibson 's arrangements with Miss Browning had not been made too soon . The squire had heard that Osborne might probably return home for a few days before going abroad ; and , though the growing intimacy between Roger and Molly did not alarm him in the least , yet he was possessed by a very hearty panic lest the heir might take a fancy to the surgeon 's daughter ; and he was in such a fidget for her to leave the house before Osborne came home , that his wife lived in constant terror lest he should make it too obvious to their visitor . Every young girl of seventeen or so , who is at all thoughtful , is very apt to make a Pope out of the first person who presents to her a new or larger system of duty than that by which she has been unconsciously guided hitherto . Such a Pope was Roger to Molly ; she looked to his opinion , to his authority on almost every subject , yet he had only said one or two things in a terse manner which gave them the force of precepts -- stable guides to her conduct -- and had shown the natural superiority in wisdom and knowledge which is sure to exist between a highly educated young man of no common intelligence , and an ignorant girl of seventeen , who yet was well capable of appreciation . Still , although they were drawn together in this very pleasant relationship , each was imagining some one very different for the future owner of their whole heart -- their highest and completest love . Roger looked to find a grand woman , his equal , and his empress ; beautiful in person , serene in wisdom , ready for counsel , as was Egeria . Molly 's little wavering maiden fancy dwelt on the unseen Osborne , who was now a troubadour , and now a knight , such as he wrote about in one of his own poems ; some one like Osborne , perhaps , rather than Osborne himself , for she shrank from giving a personal form and name to the hero that was to be . The squire was not unwise in wishing her well out of the house before Osborne came home , if he was considering her peace of mind . Yet , when she went away from the hall he missed her constantly ; it had been so pleasant to have her there fulfilling all the pretty offices of a daughter ; cheering the meals , so often tte--tte betwixt him and Roger , with her innocent wise questions , her lively interest in their talk , her merry replies to his banter . And Roger missed her too . Sometimes her remarks had probed into his mind , and excited him to the deep thought in which he delighted ; at other times he had felt himself of real help to her in her hours of need , and in making her take an interest in books , which treated of higher things than the continual fiction and poetry which she had hitherto read . He felt something like an affectionate tutor suddenly deprived of his most promising pupil ; he wondered how she would go on without him ; whether she would be puzzled and disheartened by the books he had lent her to read ; how she and her stepmother would get along together ? She occupied his thoughts a good deal those first few days after she left the hall . Mrs. Hamley regretted her more , and longer than did the other two . She had given her the place of a daughter in her heart ; and now she missed the sweet feminine companionship , the playful caresses , the never - ceasing attentions ; the very need of sympathy in her sorrows , that Molly had shown so openly from time to time ; all these things had extremely endeared her to the tender - hearted Mrs. Hamley . Molly , too , felt the change of atmosphere keenly ; and she blamed herself for so feeling even more keenly still . But she could not help having a sense of refinement , which had made her appreciate the whole manner of being at the Hall . By her dear old friends the Miss Brownings she was petted and caressed so much that she became ashamed of noticing the coarser and louder tones in which they spoke , the provincialism of their pronunciation , the absence of interest in things , and their greediness of details about persons . They asked her questions which she was puzzled enough to answer about her future stepmother ; her loyalty to her father forbidding her to reply fully and truthfully . She was always glad when they began to make inquiries as to every possible affair at the Hall . She had been so happy there ; she had liked them all , down to the very dogs , so thoroughly , that it was easy work replying : she did not mind telling them everything , even to the style of Mrs. Hamley 's invalid dress ; nor what wine the squire drank at dinner . Indeed , talking about these things helped her to recall the happiest time in her life . But one evening , as they were all sitting together after tea in the little upstairs drawing - room , looking into the High Street -- Molly discoursing away on the various pleasures of Hamley Hall , and just then telling of all Roger 's wisdom in natural science , and some of the curiosities he had shown her , she was suddenly pulled up by this little speech,-- "
73325	73416	73419	73419	he	211	" said Miss Browning , in a way intended to convey a great deal of meaning to her sister and none at all to Molly . But-- The man recovered of the bite ; The dog it was that died . Molly was perfectly aware of Miss Browning 's emphatic tone , though at first she was perplexed as to its cause ; while Miss Phoebe was just then too much absorbed in knitting the heel of her stocking to be fully alive to her sister 's nods and winks . "
73426	73455	73419	73419	he	211	" said Molly , slowly , pondering over Miss Browning 's manner , and unwilling to say more until she had satisfied herself to what the question tended . "
73558	73559	73562	73562	he	211	" "

73744	73765	73729	73729	Molly	221	" Molly had been once or twice called saucy and impertinent , and certainly a little sauciness came out now . "
73816	73867	73806	73806	her	2210	" Molly was flaming with indignation ; but she had appealed to the wrong person for justice . Miss Phoebe tried to make peace after the fashion of weak - minded people , who would cover over the unpleasant sight of a sore , instead of trying to heal it . "
73959	74220	73939	73939	you	168	" So Miss Browning and Molly went on till evening , each chafed and angry with the other . They wished each other good - night , going through the usual forms in the coolest manner possible . Molly went up to her little bedroom , clean and neat as a bedroom could be , with draperies of small delicate patchwork -- bed - curtains , window - curtains , and counterpane ; a japanned toilette - table , full of little boxes , with a small looking - glass affixed to it , that distorted every face that was so unwise as to look in it . This room had been to the child one of the most dainty and luxurious places ever seen , in comparison with her own bare , white - dimity bedroom ; and now she was sleeping in it , as a guest , and all the quaint adornments she had once peeped at as a great favour , as they were carefully wrapped up in cap - paper , were set out for her use . And yet how little she had deserved this hospitable care ; how impertinent she had been ; how cross she had felt ever since ! She was crying tears of penitence and youthful misery when there came a low tap to the door . Molly opened it , and there stood Miss Browning , in a wonderful erection of a nightcap , and scantily attired in a coloured calico jacket over her scrimpy and short white petticoat . "

The faint grey of the dining - room walls , which had harmonized well enough with the deep crimson of the moreen curtains , and which when well cleaned looked thinly coated rather than dirty , was now exchanged for a pink salmon - colour of a very glowing hue ; and the new curtains were of that pale sea - green just coming into fashion .

74598	74842	74581	74581	He	7323	" Molly could just remember , in faint clear lines of distinctness , the being taken into this very room to bid farewell to her dying mother . She could see the white linen , the white muslin , surrounding the pale , wan wistful face , with the large , longing eyes , yearning for one more touch of the little soft warm child , whom she was too feeble to clasp in her arms , already growing numb in death . Many a time when Molly had been in this room since that sad day , had she seen in vivid fancy that same wan wistful face lying on the pillow , the outline of the form beneath the clothes ; and the girl had not shrunk from such visions , but rather cherished them , as preserving to her the remembrance of her mother 's outward semblance . Her eyes were full of tears , as she followed Miss Browning into this room to see it under its new aspect . Nearly everything was changed -- the position of the bed and the colour of the furniture ; there was a grand toilette - table now , with a glass upon it , instead of the primitive substitute of the top of a chest of drawers , with a mirror above upon the wall , sloping downwards ; these latter things had served her mother during her short married life .

He had commissioned his future wife to get her what was requisite ; and presently a very smart dressmaker came over from the county - town to try on a dress , which was both so simple and so elegant as at once to charm Molly . When it came home all ready to put on , Molly had a private dressing - up for the Miss Brownings ' benefit ; and she was almost startled when she looked into the glass , and saw the improvement in her appearance .

75612	76042	76043	76047	the little Gibson - girl	2259	" Mr. Gibson and Molly drove over to Ashcombe , the night before the wedding , in the one yellow post - chaise that Hollingford possessed . They were to be Mr. Preston 's , or , rather , my lord 's guests at the Manor - house . The Manor - house came up to its name , and delighted Molly at first sight . It was built of stone , had many gables and mullioned windows , and was covered over with Virginian creeper and late - blowing roses . Molly did not know Mr. Preston , who stood in the doorway to greet her father . She took standing with him as a young lady at once , and it was the first time she had met with the kind of behaviour -- half complimentary , half flirting -- which some men think it necessary to assume with every woman under five - and - twenty . Mr. Preston was very handsome , and knew it . He was a fair man , with light - brown hair and whiskers ; grey , roving , well - shaped eyes , with lashes darker than his hair ; and a figure rendered easy and supple by the athletic exercises in which his excellence was famous , and which had procured him admission into much higher society than he was otherwise entitled to enter . He was a capital cricketer ; was so good a shot , that any house desirous of reputation for its bags on the 12th or the 1st , was glad to have him for a guest . He taught young ladies to play billiards on a wet day , or went in for the game in serious earnest when required . He knew half the private theatrical plays off by heart , and was invaluable in arranging impromptu charades and tableaux . He had his own private reasons for wishing to get up a flirtation with Molly just at this time ; he had amused himself so much with the widow when she first came to Ashcombe , that he fancied that the sight of him , standing by her less polished , less handsome , middle - aged husband , might be too much of a contrast to be agreeable . Besides , he had really a strong passion for some one else ; some one who would be absent ; and that passion it was necessary for him to conceal . So that , altogether , he had resolved , even had "
76048	76234	76043	76047	the little Gibson - girl	2259	" ( as he called her ) been less attractive than she was , to devote himself to her for the next sixteen hours . They were taken by their host into a wainscoted parlour , where a wood fire crackled and burnt , and the crimson curtains shut out the waning day and the outer chill . Here the table was laid for dinner ; snowy table - linen , bright silver , clear sparkling glass , wine and an autumnal dessert on the sideboard . Yet Mr. Preston kept apologizing to Molly for the rudeness of his bachelor home , for the smallness of the room , the great dining - room being already appropriated by his housekeeper , in preparation for the morrow 's breakfast . And then he rang for a servant to show Molly to her room . She was taken into a most comfortable chamber ; a wood fire on the hearth , candles lighted on the toilette - table , dark woollen curtains surrounding a snow - white bed , great vases of china standing here and there . "

76295	76334	76289	76289	I	0	" Molly , quite aware of the fact that she had but her white muslin gown for the wedding besides that she had on , dismissed the good woman , and was thankful to be left to herself . "
76336	76601	76292	76292	her	179	" was it called ? Why , it was nearly eight o'clock ; and preparations for bed seemed a more natural employment than dressing at this hour of night . All the dressing she could manage was the placing of a red damask rose or two in the band of her grey stuff gown , there being a great nosegay of choice autumnal flowers on the toilette - table . She did try the effect of another crimson rose in her black hair , just above her ear ; it was very pretty , but too coquettish , and so she put it back again . The dark - oak panels and wainscoting of the whole house seemed to glow in warm light ; there were so many fires in different rooms , in the hall , and even one on the landing of the staircase . Mr. Preston must have heard her step , for he met her in the hall , and led her into a small drawing - room , with closed folding - doors on one side , opening into the larger drawing - room , as he told her . This room into which she entered reminded her a little of Hamley -- yellow - satin upholstery of seventy or a hundred years ago , all delicately kept and scrupulously clean ; great Indian cabinets , and china jars , emitting spicy odours ; a large blazing fire , before which her father stood in his morning dress , grave and thoughtful , as he had been all day . "

76799	77104	77110	77113	Mademoiselle de St. Quentin	289	" Then they went in to dinner . Molly thought everything that was served was delicious , and cooked to the point of perfection ; but they did not seem to satisfy Mr. Preston , who apologized to his guests several times for the bad cooking of this dish , or the omission of a particular sauce to that ; always referring to bachelor 's housekeeping , bachelor 's this and bachelor 's that , till Molly grew quite impatient at the word . Her father 's depression , which was still continuing and rendering him very silent , made her uneasy ; yet she wished to conceal it from Mr. Preston ; and so she talked away , trying to obviate the sort of personal bearing which their host would give to everything . She did not know when to leave the gentlemen , but her father made a sign to her ; and she was conducted back to the yellow drawing - room by Mr. Preston , who made many apologies for leaving her there alone . She enjoyed herself extremely , however , feeling at liberty to prowl about , and examine all the curiosities the room contained . Among other things was a Louis Quinze cabinet with lovely miniatures in enamel let into the fine woodwork . She carried a candle to it , and was looking intently at these faces when her father and Mr. Preston came in . Her father still looked care - worn and anxious ; he came up and patted her on the back , looked at what she was looking at , and then went off to silence and the fire . Mr. Preston took the candle out of her hand , and threw himself into her interests with an air of ready gallantry . "

Lord Cumnor and Lady Harriet drove over from the Towers , so the hour for the ceremony was as late as possible . Lord Cumnor came in order to officiate as the bride 's father , and was in more open glee than either bride or bridegroom , or any one else . Lady Harriet came as a sort of amateur bridesmaid , to "

They went from the Manor - house in two carriages to the church in the park , Mr. Preston and Mr. Gibson in one , and Molly , to her dismay , shut up with Lord Cumnor and Lady Harriet in the other . Lady Harriet 's gown of white muslin had seen one or two garden - parties , and was not in the freshest order ; it had been rather a freak of the young lady 's at the last moment . She was very merry , and very much inclined to talk to Molly , by way of finding out what sort of a little personage Clare was to have for her future daughter . She began:-- "

The earl drove on alone to fetch her from her own house , not a quarter of a mile distant . It was pleasant to her to be led to the hymeneal altar by a belted earl , and pleasant to have his daughter as a volunteer bridesmaid . Mrs. Kirkpatrick in this flush of small gratifications , and on the brink of matrimony with a man whom she liked , and who would be bound to support her without any exertion of her own , looked beamingly happy and handsome . A little cloud came over her face at the sight of Mr. Preston,--the sweet perpetuity of her smile was rather disturbed as he followed in Mr. Gibson 's wake . But his face never changed ; he bowed to her gravely , and then seemed absorbed in the service . Ten minutes , and all was over . The bride and bridegroom were driving together to the Manor - house , Mr. Preston was walking thither by a short cut , and Molly was again in the carriage with my lord , rubbing his hands and chuckling , and Lady Harriet , trying to be kind and consolatory , when her silence would have been the best comfort . Molly found out , to her dismay , that the plan was for her to return with Lord Cumnor and Lady Harriet when they went back to the Towers in the evening . In the meantime Lord Cumnor had business to do with Mr. Preston , and after the happy couple had driven off on their week 's holiday tour , she was to be left alone with the formidable Lady Harriet . When they were by themselves after all the others had been thus disposed of , Lady Harriet sate still over the drawing - room fire , holding a screen between it and her face , but gazing intently at Molly for a minute or two . Molly was fully conscious of this prolonged look , and was trying to get up her courage to return the stare , when Lady Harriet suddenly said,-- "

While she was hesitating , and slowly tending towards consent , Lady Harriet spoke,-- "

Lord Cumnor was standing on the steps , waiting to hand his daughter out of the carriage . Lady Harriet stopped to kiss Molly on the forehead , and to say,-- "

They were full of welcome , full of curiosity . All through the long day they had been missing their bright young visitor , and three or four times in every hour they had been wondering and settling what everybody was doing at that exact minute . What had become of Molly during all the afternoon , had been a great perplexity to them ; and they were very much oppressed with a sense of the great honour she had received in being allowed to spend so many hours alone with Lady Harriet . They were , indeed , more excited by this one fact than by all the details of the wedding , most of which they had known of beforehand , and talked over with much perseverance during the day . Molly began to feel as if there was some foundation for Lady Harriet 's inclination to ridicule the worship paid by the good people of Hollingford to their liege lord , and to wonder with what tokens of reverence they would receive Lady Harriet if she came to pay her promised visit . She had never thought of concealing the probability of this call until this evening ; but now she felt as if it would be better not to speak of the chance , as she was not at all sure that the promise would be fulfilled . Before Lady Harriet 's call was paid , Molly received another visit . Roger Hamley came riding over one day with a note from his mother , and a wasps'-nest as a present from himself . Molly heard his powerful voice come sounding up the little staircase , as he asked if Miss Gibson was at home from the servant - maid at the door ; and she was half amused and half annoyed as she thought how this call of his would give colour to Miss Browning 's fancies .

He knew the Miss Brownings slightly , and talked pleasantly to them while Molly read Mrs. Hamley 's little missive of sympathy and good wishes relating to the wedding ; then he turned to her , and though Miss Brownings listened with all their ears , they could not find out anything remarkable either in the words he said or the tone in which they were spoken .

One was talking about the pretty muslin gown which Molly had sent to the wash only that morning , and contriving how it could be had back again in time for her to wear ; and the other , Miss Phoebe , totally inattentive to her sister 's speaking for a wonder , was piping out a separate strain of her own , and singing Roger Hamley 's praises .

He was gone -- all the gentlemen were gone before the carriage , which came to fetch Molly on Thursday , reached Hamley Hall . But Molly was almost glad , she was so much afraid of being disappointed . Besides , she had her dear Mrs. Hamley the more to herself ; the quiet sit in the morning - room , talking poetry and romance ; the midday saunter into the garden , brilliant with autumnal flowers and glittering dew - drops on the gossamer webs that stretched from scarlet to blue , and thence to purple and yellow petals . As they were sitting at lunch , a strange man 's voice and step were heard in the hall ; the door was opened , and a young man came in , who could be no other than Osborne . He was beautiful and languid - looking , almost as frail in appearance as his mother , whom he strongly resembled . This seeming delicacy made him appear older than he was . He was dressed to perfection , and yet with easy carelessness . He came up to his mother , and stood by her , holding her hand , while his eyes sought Molly , not boldly or impertinently , but as if appraising her critically . "

82895	83291	83292	83292	Osborne	234	" Molly was trying to reconcile the ideal with the real . The ideal was agile , yet powerful , with Greek features and an eagle - eye , capable of enduring long fasting , and indifferent as to what he ate . The real was almost effeminate in movement , though not in figure ; he had the Greek features , but his blue eyes had a cold , weary expression in them . He was dainty in eating , and had anything but a Homeric appetite . However , Molly 's hero was not to eat more than Ivanhoe , when he was Friar Tuck 's guest ; and , after all , with a little alteration , she began to think Mr. Osborne Hamley might turn out a poetical , if not a chivalrous hero . He was extremely attentive to his mother , which pleased Molly , and , in return , Mrs. Hamley seemed charmed with him to such a degree that Molly once or twice fancied that mother and son would have been happier in her absence . Yet , again , it struck on the shrewd , if simple girl , that Osborne was mentally squinting at her in the conversation which was directed to his mother . There were little turns and ' fioriture ' of speech which Molly could not help feeling were graceful antics of language not common in the simple daily intercourse between mother and son . But it was flattering rather than otherwise to perceive that a very fine young man , who was a poet to boot , should think it worth while to talk on the tight rope for her benefit . And before the afternoon was ended , without there having been any direct conversation between Osborne and Molly , she had reinstated him on his throne in her imagination ; indeed , she had almost felt herself disloyal to her dear Mrs. Hamley when , in the first hour after her introduction , she had questioned his claims on his mother 's idolatry . His beauty came out more and more , as he became animated in some discussion with her ; and all his attitudes , if a little studied , were graceful in the extreme . Before Molly left , the squire and Roger returned from Canonbury . "

My word ! sister was up on her feet directly ; and she dropped her curtsey , and made her excuses for sleeping , as fast as might be , while I went off to put on my best cap , for sister might well say I was out of my wits to go on chatting to an earl 's daughter in an old black silk skull - cap . Black silk , too ! when , if I 'd only known she was coming , I might have put on my new brown silk one , lying idle in my top drawer . And when I came back , sister was ordering tea for her ladyship,--our tea , I mean . So I took my turn at talk , and sister slipped out to put on her Sunday silk . But I do n't think we were quite so much at our ease with her ladyship as when I sat pulling out my lace in my skull - cap . And she was quite struck with our tea , and asked where we got it , for she had never tasted any like it before ; and I told her we gave only 3_s . _ 4_d . _ a pound for it , at Johnson's--(sister says I ought to have told her the price of our company - tea , which is 5_s . _ a pound , only that was not what we were drinking ; for , as ill - luck would have it , we 'd none of it in the house)--and she said she would send us some of hers , all the way from Russia or Prussia , or some out - of - the - way place , and we were to compare and see which we liked best ; and if we liked hers best , she could get it for us at 3_s . _ a pound . And she left her love for you ; and , though she was going away , you were not to forget her . Sister thought such a message would set you up too much , and told me she would not be chargeable for the giving it you . ' But , ' I said , ' a message is a message , and it 's on Molly 's own shoulders if she 's set up by it . Let us show her an example of humility , sister , though we have been sitting cheek - by - jowl in such company . ' So sister humphed , and said she 'd a headache , and went to bed .

90644	90704	90580	90580	Molly	221	" Oh ! I 'm not sure ; perhaps at the new year -- perhaps not till Easter . I must get this drawing - room all new furnished first ; and then I mean to fit up her room and yours just alike . They are just the same size , only on opposite sides of the passage . "

90769	90817	90758	90758	Molly	221	" Yes , dear ! You shall have yours done as well . A little French bed , and a new paper , and a pretty carpet , and a dressed - up toilet - table and glass , will make it look quite a different place . "
90818	90844	90580	90580	Molly	221	" But I do n't want it to look different . I like it as it is . Pray do n't do anything to it . "
90845	90876	90580	90580	Molly	221	" What nonsense , child ! I never heard anything more ridiculous ! Most girls would be glad to get rid of furniture only fit for the lumber - room . "

90927	91058	90924	90924	she	199	" It 's very much to your credit that you should have such feelings , I 'm sure . But do n't you think sentiment may be carried too far ? Why , we should have no new furniture at all , and should have to put up with worm - eaten horrors . Besides , my dear , Hollingford will seem very dull to Cynthia , after pretty , gay France , and I want to make the first impressions attractive . I 've a notion I can settle her down near here ; and I want her to come in a good temper ; for , between ourselves , my dear , she is a little , leetle wilful . You need not mention this to your papa . "
91059	91078	90924	90924	she	199	" But ca n't you do Cynthia 's room , and not mine ? Please let mine alone . "
91079	91118	90924	90924	she	199	" No , indeed ! I could n't agree to that . Only think what would be said of me by everybody ; petting my own child and neglecting my husband 's ! I could n't bear it . "

91126	91226	90924	90924	she	199	" In such a tittle - tattle place as Hollingford ! Really , Molly , you are either very stupid or very obstinate , or else you do n't care what hard things may be said about me : and all for a selfish fancy of your own ! No ! I owe myself the justice of acting in this matter as I please . Every one shall know I 'm not a common stepmother . Every penny I spend on Cynthia I shall spend on you too ; so it 's no use talking any more about it . "

91757	91802	91750	91751	Mrs. Gibson	199	" Lady Harriet only went to see you out of a desire of amusement . She would only make fun of Miss Brownings , and those two will be quoting her and talking about her , just as if she was their intimate friend . "
91803	91826	91750	91751	Mrs. Gibson	199	" I do n't think she did make fun of them . She really seemed as if she had been very kind . "

91953	91976	91750	91751	Mrs. Gibson	199	" Upon my word ! with all my long acquaintance with Lady Harriet , I should never have ventured on such impertinence . "

Then he has gone and failed miserably in his degree , after all that he said , and that his mother said ; and I , like a fool , went and boasted about my clever son . I ca n't understand it . I never expected anything extraordinary from Roger ; but Osborne-- ! And then it has thrown madam into one of her bad fits of illness ; and she seems to have a fancy for you , child ! Your father came to see her this morning . Poor thing , she 's very poorly , I 'm afraid ; and she told him how she should like to have you about her , and he said I might fetch you . You 'll come , wo n't you , my dear ? She 's not a poor woman , such as many people think it 's the only charity to be kind to , but she 's just as forlorn of woman 's care as if she was poor -- worse , I daresay . "

92883	92950	92880	92880	she	199	" The visiting here is not all one could wish for so young a girl -- no young people , no dances , nothing of gaiety ; but it is wrong in you , Molly , to speak against such kind friends of your father 's as I understand these Cockerells are . Do n't give so bad an impression of yourself to the kind Squire . "
92951	92960	92880	92880	she	199	" Let her alone ! let her alone ! "

93013	93050	93010	93011	Mrs. Gibson	199	" An engagement is an engagement with me ; and I consider that she is not only engaged to Mrs. Cockerell , but to me -- bound to accompany me , in my husband 's absence . "
93183	93245	93254	93254	his	7531	" Well ! it 's no use . Poor madam ; she wo n't like it . She 'll be disappointed ! But it 's but for one evening!--but for one evening ! She may come to - morrow , may n't she ? Or will the dissipation of such an evening as she describes , be too much for her ? "
93264	93302	93258	93259	Mrs. Gibson	199	" She shall be ready at any time you name . I am so sorry : my foolish shyness is in fault , I believe ; but still you must acknowledge that an engagement is an engagement . "
93303	93387	93177	93177	he	7531	" Did I ever say an engagement was an elephant , madam ? However , there 's no use saying any more about it , or I shall forget my manners . I 'm an old tyrant , and she -- lying there in bed , poor girl -- has always given me my own way . So you 'll excuse me , Mrs. Gibson , wo n't you ; and let Molly come along with me at ten to - morrow morning ? "
93388	93391	93393	93394	Mrs. Gibson	199	" Certainly , "
93409	93493	93405	93405	she	199	" Now , my dear , I must never have you exposing me to the ill - manners of such a man again ! I do n't call him a squire ; I call him a boor , or a yeoman at best . You must not go on accepting or rejecting invitations as if you were an independent young lady , Molly . Pay me the respect of a reference to my wishes another time , if you please , my dear ! "
93494	93502	93504	93504	Molly	221	" Papa had said I might go , "
93510	93607	93504	93504	Molly	221	" As I am now your mamma , your references must be to me , for the future . But as you are to go you may as well look well dressed . I will lend you my new shawl for this visit , if you like it , and my set of green ribbons . I am always indulgent when proper respect is paid to me . And in such a house as Hamley Hall , no one can tell who may be coming and going , even if there is sickness in the family . "
93608	93647	93673	93673	she	2661	" Thank you . But I do n't want the shawl and the ribbons , please : there will be nobody there except the family . There never is , I think ; and now that she is so ill"--Molly

93776	93923	93773	93773	she	2661	" First , you insist upon your knowing Lady Harriet better than I do -- I , who have known her for eighteen or nineteen years at least . Then you jump at invitations without ever consulting me , or thinking of how awkward it would be for me to go stumping into a drawing - room all by myself ; following my new name , too , which always makes me feel uncomfortable , it is such a sad come - down after Kirkpatrick ! And then , when I offer you some of the prettiest things I have got , you say it does not signify how you are dressed . What can I do to please you , Molly ? I , who delight in nothing more than peace in a family , to see you sitting there with despair upon your face ? "

94483	94518	94519	94519	he	7531	" But never fear , my dear one ; here 's the doctor 's daughter , nearly as good as the doctor himself . Have you had your medicine ? Your beef - tea ? "
94592	94683	94581	94581	she	213	" Now , dear child , tell me all ; it 's no breach of confidence , for I sha n't mention it again , and I sha n't be here long . How does it all go on -- the new mother , the good resolutions ? let me help you if I can . I think with a girl I could have been of use -- a mother does not know boys . But tell me anything you like and will ; do n't be afraid of details . "
94799	94810	94794	94795	Mrs. Hamley	213	" And you and Mrs. Gibson get on happily together ? "

94819	94838	94817	94817	Molly	221	" You know we did n't know much of each other before we were put to live together . "
94839	94857	94794	94795	Mrs. Hamley	213	" I did n't like what the Squire told me last night . He was very angry . "
94884	94892	94894	94895	Mrs. Hamley	213	" Ah ! I see , Molly , "
94897	94919	94894	94895	Mrs. Hamley	213	" you wo n't tell me your sorrows , and yet , perhaps , I could have done you some good . "
94920	94926	94928	94928	Molly	221	" I do n't like , "
94935	94984	94928	94928	Molly	221	" I think papa would n't like it . And , besides , you have helped me so much -- you and Mr. Roger Hamley . I often think of the things he said ; they come in so usefully , and are such a strength to me . "
94985	95045	95046	95046	Molly	221	" Ah , Roger ! yes . He is to be trusted . Oh , Molly ! I 've a great deal to say to you myself , only not now . I must have my medicine and try to go to sleep . Good girl ! You are stronger than I am , and can do without sympathy . "
95173	95661	95171	95171	she	213	" Osborne has so disappointed us ! I can not understand it yet . And the Squire was so terribly angry ! I can not think how all the money was spent -- advances through money - lenders , besides bills . The Squire does not show me how angry he is now , because he 's afraid of another attack ; but I know how angry he is . You see he has been spending ever so much money in reclaiming that land at Upton Common , and is very hard pressed himself . But it would have doubled the value of the estate , and so we never thought anything of economies which would benefit Osborne in the long run . And now the Squire says he must mortgage some of the land ; and you ca n't think how it cuts him to the heart . He sold a great deal of timber to send the two boys to college . Osborne -- oh ! what a dear , innocent boy he was : he was the heir , you know ; and he was so clever , every one said he was sure of honours and a fellowship , and I do n't know what all ; and he did get a scholarship , and then all went wrong . I do n't know how . That is the worst . Perhaps the Squire wrote too angrily , and that stopped up confidence . But he might have told me . He would have done , I think , Molly , if he had been here , face to face with me . But the Squire , in his anger , told him not to show his face at home till he had paid off the debts he had incurred out of his allowance . Out of two hundred and fifty a year to pay off more than nine hundred , one way or another ! And not to come home till then ! Perhaps Roger will have debts too ! He had but two hundred ; but , then , he was not the eldest son . The Squire has given orders that the men are to be turned off the draining - works ; and I lie awake thinking of their poor families this wintry weather . But what shall we do ? I 've never been strong , and , perhaps , I 've been extravagant in my habits ; and there were family traditions as to expenditure , and the reclaiming of this land . Oh ! Molly , Osborne was such a sweet little baby , and such a loving boy : so clever , too ! You know I read you some of his poetry : now , could a person who wrote like that do anything very wrong ? And yet I 'm afraid he has . "
95662	95677	95679	95679	Molly	221	" Do n't you know , at all , how the money has gone ? "
95681	95818	95171	95171	she	213	" No ! not at all . That 's the sting . There are tailors ' bills , and bills for book - binding and wine and pictures -- those come to four or five hundred ; and though this expenditure is extraordinary -- inexplicable to such simple folk as we are -- yet it may be only the luxury of the present day . But the money for which he will give no account,--of which , indeed , we only heard through the Squire 's London agents , who found out that certain disreputable attorneys were making inquiries as to the entail of the estate;--oh ! Molly , worse than all -- I do n't know how to bring myself to tell you -- as to the age and health of the Squire , his dear father"--(she
95840	95902	95826	95826	she	221	her)--"who held him in his arms , and blessed him , even before I had kissed him ; and thought always so much of him as his heir and first - born darling . How he has loved him ! How I have loved him ! I sometimes have thought of late that we 've almost done that good Roger injustice . "
95903	95951	95953	95953	Molly	221	" No ! I 'm sure you 've not : only look at the way he loves you . Why , you are his first thought : he may not speak about it , but any one may see it . And dear , dear Mrs. Hamley , "
95974	96036	95953	95953	Molly	221	" do n't you think that it would be better not to misjudge Mr. Osborne Hamley ? We do n't know what he has done with the money : he is so good ( is he not ? ) that he may have wanted it to relieve some poor person -- some tradesman , for instance , pressed by creditors -- some-- "
96037	96043	96045	96046	Mrs. Hamley	213	" You forget , dear , "
96064	96085	96086	96086	Molly	221	" that all the other bills come from tradesmen , who complain piteously of being kept out of their money . "
96097	96127	96095	96095	she	221	" I daresay they imposed upon him . I 'm sure I 've heard stories of young men being made regular victims of by the shopkeepers in great towns . "

96204	96277	96095	96095	she	221	" Never mind , Molly , what you call him ; only go on talking . It seems to do me good to hear the hopeful side taken . The Squire has been so hurt and displeased : strange - looking men coming into the neighbourhood , too , questioning the tenants , and grumbling about the last fall of timber , as if they were calculating on the Squire 's death . "
96278	96323	96095	96095	she	221	" That 's just what I was going to speak about . Does n't it show that they are bad men ? and would bad men scruple to impose upon him , and to tell lies in his name , and to ruin him ? "
96324	96341	96095	96095	she	221	" Do n't you see , you only make him out weak , instead of wicked ? "
96342	96420	96095	96095	she	221	" Yes ; perhaps I do . But I do n't think he is weak . You know yourself , dear Mrs. Hamley , how very clever he really is . Besides , I would rather he was weak than wicked . Weak people may find themselves all at once strong in heaven , when they see things quite clearly ; but I do n't think the wicked will turn themselves into virtuous people all at once . "
96421	96432	96434	96435	Mrs. Hamley	213	" I think I 've been very weak , Molly , "
96443	96487	96434	96435	Mrs. Hamley	213	" I 've made such an idol of my beautiful Osborne ; and he turns out to have feet of clay , not strong enough to stand firm on the ground . And that 's the best view of his conduct , too ! "
96659	96789	96654	96654	his	7858	" You see , miss , me and cook had planned a dinner as would tempt master to eat ; but when you say , ' No , thank you , ' when I hand you anything , master never so much as looks at it . But if you takes a thing , and eats with a relish , why first he waits , and then he looks , and by - and - by he smells ; and then he finds out as he 's hungry , and falls to eating as natural as a kitten takes to mewing . That 's the reason , miss , as I gave you a nudge and a wink , which no one knows better nor me was not manners . "
96903	96996	96893	96894	Dr. Nicholls	316	" It 's nonsense thinking her so ill as that -- you know it 's only the delicacy she 's had for years ; and if you ca n't do her any good in such a simple case -- no pain -- only weakness and nervousness -- it is a simple case , eh?--don't look in that puzzled way , man!--you'd better give her up altogether , and I 'll take her to Bath or Brighton , or somewhere for change , for in my opinion it 's only moping and nervousness .

97113	97233	97110	97111	the Squire	7531	" Of course we must all die ; and she must too . But the cleverest doctor in England sha n't go about coolly meting out the life of such as her . I daresay I shall die first . I hope I shall . But I 'll knock any one down who speaks to me of death sitting within me . And , besides , I think all doctors are ignorant quacks , pretending to knowledge they have n't got . Ay , you may smile at me . I do n't care . Unless you can tell me I shall die first , neither you nor your Dr. Nicholls shall come prophesying and croaking about this house . "

Roger will know . And , Molly , they are sure to come home as soon as they hear my report of their mother 's state . I wish you 'd tell the Squire what I 've done . It 's not a pleasant piece of work ; and I 'll tell madam myself in my own way . I 'd have told him if he 'd been at home ; but you say he was obliged to go to Ashcombe on business . "

98390	98393	98387	98387	Molly	221	" Yes . "
98429	98441	98443	98443	he	7531	" Roger would have been down from Cambridge on the 18th , "
98445	98457	98481	98481	he	7531	" And he has sent for Osborne , too ! Did he know,"--he
98487	98516	98481	98481	he	7531	" It 's right , quite right . I understand . It has come at length . Come ! come ! Osborne has brought it on , though , "

98549	98564	98567	98567	he	7531	" but for that . I ca n't forgive him ; I can not . "
98593	98637	98587	98587	he	7531	" Go to her , my dear ; I cannot -- not just yet . But I will soon . Just this bit ; and after that I wo n't lose a moment . You 're a good girl . God bless you ! "
98703	98707	98686	98687	Mrs. Gibson	199	" right of way "
98712	98726	98727	98728	her father	711	" You shall come back to - morrow , or the next day , "
98732	98758	98727	98728	her father	711	" But mamma seems to think people will put a bad construction on your being so much away from home so soon after our marriage . "
98759	98781	98686	98687	Mrs. Gibson	199	" Oh , papa , I 'm afraid Mrs. Hamley will miss me ! I do so like being with her . "
98782	98839	98727	98728	her father	711	" I do n't think it is likely she will miss you as much as she would have done a month or two ago . She sleeps so much now , that she is scarcely conscious of the lapse of time . I 'll see that you come back here again in a day or two . "
98927	98983	98909	98909	her	221	" What a time she lingers ! Your papa never expected she would last half so long after that attack . It must be very wearing work to them all ; I declare you look quite another creature since you were there . One can only wish it may n't last , for their sakes . "
98984	98996	98998	98998	Molly	221	" You do n't know how the Squire values every minute , "
99000	99183	98998	98998	Molly	221	" Why , you say she sleeps a great deal , and does n't talk much when she 's awake , and there 's not the slightest hope for her . And yet , at such times , people are kept on the tenter - hooks with watching and waiting . I know it by my dear Kirkpatrick . There really were days when I thought it never would end . But we wo n't talk any more of such dismal things ; you 've had quite enough of them , I 'm sure , and it always makes me melancholy to hear of illness and death ; and yet your papa seems sometimes as if he could talk of nothing else . I 'm going to take you out to - night , though , and that will give you something of a change ; and I 've been getting Miss Rose to trim up one of my old gowns for you ; it 's too tight for me . There 's some talk of dancing,--it 's at Mrs. Edwards ' . "
99184	99194	99196	99196	Molly	221	" Oh , mamma , I can not go ! "
99198	99224	99196	99196	Molly	221	" I 've been so much with her ; and she may be suffering so , or even dying -- and I to be dancing ! "
99225	99313	98998	98998	Molly	221	" Nonsense ! You 're no relation , so you need not feel it so much . I would n't urge you , if she was likely to know about it and be hurt ; but as it is , it 's all fixed that you are to go ; and do n't let us have any nonsense about it . We might sit twirling our thumbs , and repeating hymns all our lives long , if we were to do nothing else when people were dying . "
99314	99320	99322	99322	Molly	221	" I can not go , "
99397	99432	99433	99433	Molly	221	" I suppose I can have some lunch ? I went away at six this morning , and there 's nothing in the dining - room . I have to go off again directly . "
99448	99456	99458	99458	she	199	" Where are you going , Molly ? "
99462	99471	99458	99458	she	199	" Only to see about papa 's lunch . "
99472	99491	99505	99506	her father	711	" There are servants to do it ; and I do n't like your going into the kitchen . "
99492	99503	99505	99506	her father	711	" Come , Molly ! sit down and be quiet , "
99508	99635	99505	99506	her father	711	" One comes home wanting peace and quietness -- and food too . If I am to be appealed to , which I beg I may not be another time , I settle that Molly stops at home this evening . I shall come back late and tired . See that I have something ready to eat , goosey , and then I 'll dress myself up in my best , and go and fetch you home , my dear . I wish all these wedding festivities were well over . Ready , is it ? Then I 'll go into the dining - room and gorge myself . A doctor ought to be able to eat like a camel , or like Major Dugald Dalgetty . "
100107	100119	100096	100096	she	221	" Tell me all Roger says . He will tell you . "
100197	100207	100208	100208	she	221	" I 've been wanting to see you alone , "
100211	100248	100208	100208	she	221	" Your mother does so want some news of your brother Osborne . She told me last week to ask you about him , but I did not like to speak of him before your father . "
100249	100259	100323	100323	He	2772	" She has hardly ever named him to me . "
100260	100322	100323	100323	He	2772	" I do n't know why ; for to me she used to talk of him perpetually . I have seen so little of her this week , and I think she forgets a great deal now . Still , if you do n't mind , I should like to be able to tell her something if she asks me again . "
100341	100349	100351	100351	he	2772	" What does she want to know ? "
100356	100369	100351	100351	he	2772	" Does she know that Osborne is coming soon -- any day ? "
100370	100382	100323	100323	He	2772	" Yes . But she wants to know where he is . "
100383	100408	100323	100323	He	2772	" I ca n't tell you . I do n't exactly know . I believe he 's abroad , but I 'm not sure . "
100409	100420	100351	100351	he	2772	" But you 've sent papa 's letter to him ? "
100421	100496	100351	100351	he	2772	" I 've sent it to a friend of his who will know better than I do where he 's to be found . You must know that he is n't free from creditors , Molly . You ca n't have been one of the family , like a child of the house almost , without knowing that much . For that and for other reasons I do n't exactly know where he is . "
100497	100511	100323	100323	He	2772	" I will tell her so . You are sure he will come ? "
100512	100576	100323	100323	He	2772	" Quite sure . But , Molly , I think my mother may live some time yet ; do n't you ? Dr. Nicholls said so yesterday when he was here with your father . He said she had rallied more than he had ever expected . You 're not afraid of any change that makes you so anxious for Osborne 's coming ? "
100577	100647	100351	100351	he	2772	" No . It 's only for her that I asked . She did seem so to crave for news of him . I think she dreamed of him ; and then when she wakened it was a relief to her to talk about him to me . She always seemed to associate me with him . We used to speak so much of him when we were together . "
100648	100674	100323	100323	He	2772	" I do n't know what we should any of us have done without you . You 've been like a daughter to my mother . "
100675	100682	100684	100684	Molly	221	" I do so love her , "
100688	100765	100684	100684	Molly	221	" Yes ; I see . Have you ever noticed that she sometimes calls you ' Fanny ? ' It was the name of a little sister of ours who died . I think she often takes you for her . It was partly that , and partly that at such a time as this one ca n't stand on formalities , that made me call you Molly . I hope you do n't mind it ? "
100766	100792	100323	100323	He	2772	" No ; I like it . But will you tell me something more about your brother ? She really hungers for news of him . "
100793	100864	100323	100323	He	2772	" She 'd better ask me herself . Yet , no ! I am so involved by promises of secrecy , Molly , that I could n't satisfy her if she once began to question me . I believe he 's in Belgium , and that he went there about a fortnight ago , partly to avoid his creditors . You know my father has refused to pay his debts ? "
100865	100877	100684	100684	Molly	221	" Yes : at least , I knew something like it . "
100878	100917	100323	100323	He	2772	" I do n't believe my father could raise the money all at once without having recourse to steps which he would exceedingly recoil from . Yet for the time it places Osborne in a very awkward position . "
100918	100939	100323	100323	He	2772	" I think what vexes your father a good deal is some mystery as to how the money was spent . "
100940	100954	100956	100956	Roger	211	" If my mother ever says anything about that part of the affair , "
100960	100998	100956	100956	Roger	211	" assure her from me that there 's nothing of vice or wrong - doing about it . I ca n't say more : I 'm tied . But set her mind at ease on that point . "
100999	101014	101016	101016	Molly	221	" I 'm not sure if she remembers all her painful anxiety about this , "
101018	101090	101016	101016	Molly	221	" She used to speak a great deal to me about him before you came , when your father seemed so angry . And now , whenever she sees me she wants to talk on the old subject ; but she does n't remember so clearly . If she were to see him , I do n't believe she would recollect why she was uneasy about him while he was absent . "
101091	101104	101106	101106	Roger	211	" He must be here soon . I expect him every day , "
101110	101123	101125	101125	Molly	221	" Do you think your father will be very angry with him ? "
101143	101149	101151	101151	Roger	211	" I do n't know , "
101153	101270	101151	101151	Roger	211	" My mother 's illness may alter him ; but he did n't easily forgive us formerly . I remember once -- but that is nothing to the purpose . I ca n't help fancying that he has put himself under some strong restraint for my mother 's sake , and that he wo n't express much . But it does n't follow that he will forget it . My father is a man of few affections , but what he has are very strong ; he feels anything that touches him on these points deeply and permanently . That unlucky valuing of the property ! It has given my father the idea of post - obits-- "
101271	101276	101278	101278	Molly	221	" What are they ? "
101280	101307	101314	101314	she	221	" Raising money to be paid on my father 's death , which , of course , involves calculations as to the duration of his life . "
101308	101312	101314	101314	she	221	" How shocking ! "
101316	101402	101403	101403	he	2775	" I 'm as sure as I am of my own life that Osborne never did anything of the kind . But my father expressed his suspicions in language that irritated Osborne ; and he does n't speak out , and wo n't justify himself even as much as he might ; and , much as he loves me , I 've but little influence over him , or else he would tell my father all . Well , we must leave it to time , "
101408	101427	101428	101428	He	2775	" My mother would have brought us all right , if she 'd been what she once was . "
101636	101657	101626	101626	she	213	" My dear child , she 's getting past wanting any one ! The keenness of earthly feelings is deadened . "
101658	101735	101736	101737	Mr. Gibson	158	" Papa , that is worst of all . I can not bear it . I wo n't believe it . She may not ask for me again , and may quite forget me ; but I 'm sure , to the very last , if the medicines do n't stupefy her , she will look round for the squire and her children . For poor Osborne most of all ; because he 's in sorrow . "
101755	101807	101753	101753	he	158	" I do n't like to take you away while you even fancy you can be of use or comfort to one who has been so kind to you ; but , if she has n't wanted you before Friday , will you be convinced , will you come home willingly ? "
101808	101830	101832	101832	Molly	221	" If I go then , I may see her once again , even if she has n't asked for me ? "
101834	101874	101753	101753	he	158	" Yes , of course . You must make no noise , no step ; but you may go in and see her . I must tell you , I 'm almost certain she wo n't ask for you . "
101875	101899	101753	101753	he	158	" But she may , papa . I will go home on Friday , if she does not . I think she will . "
102087	102117	102125	102125	he	2788	" How is she ? You will tell me -- you must know the truth ! I 've travelled day and night since I got your father 's letter . "
102141	102147	102149	102149	Molly	221	" She 's very ill , "
102151	102172	102173	102173	He	2788	" That you know ; but I do n't think she suffers much pain . She has wanted you sadly . "
102177	102185	102173	102173	He	2788	" My father forbade me to come . "
102186	102190	102192	102192	Molly	221	" I know ! "
102202	102229	102192	102192	Molly	221	" Your brother was away , too . I think no one knew how ill she was -- she had been an invalid for so long . "
102230	102283	102192	102192	Molly	221	" You know-- Yes ! she told you a great deal -- she was very fond of you . And God knows how I loved her . If I had not been forbidden to come home , I should have told her all . Does my father know of my coming now ? "
102284	102287	102289	102289	Molly	221	" Yes , "
102291	102301	102289	102289	Molly	221	" I told him papa had sent for you . "
102420	102426	102440	102440	he	7531	" You here , sir ! "
102506	102515	102522	102522	his	2702	" For I think I forget everything now ! "
102529	102563	102522	102522	his	2702	" For the life of me , I ca n't remember whether we 've had dinner or not ; these long nights , and all this sorrow and watching , quite bewilder me . "
102564	102604	102522	102522	his	2702	" Perhaps , sir , you will take some dinner with Mr. Osborne . Mrs. Morgan is sending up his directly . You hardly sate down at dinner - time , sir , you thought my mistress wanted something . "
102605	102638	102522	102522	his	2702	" Ay ! I remember now . No ! I wo n't have any more . Give Mr. Osborne what wine he chooses . Perhaps _ he _ can eat and drink . "
102789	102802	102803	102803	he	234	" You 're sure I may n't see her to - night ? "
102814	102882	102883	102883	Osborne	213	" No , indeed . I will go up again if you like it . But Mrs. Jones , the nurse Dr. Nicholls sent , is a very decided person . I went up while you were at dinner , and Mrs. Hamley had just taken her drops , and was on no account to be disturbed by seeing any one , much less by any excitement . "
102904	102939	102883	102883	Osborne	213	" I wish Roger would come . He seems to be the only one to give me a welcome . Does my father always live upstairs in my mother 's rooms , Miss Gibson ? "
102940	102962	103098	103098	he	2807	" He has done since her last attack . I believe he reproaches himself for not having been enough alarmed before . "
102963	103013	103098	103098	he	2807	" You heard all the words he said to me ; they were not much of a welcome , were they ? And my dear mother , who always -- whether I was to blame or not -- I suppose Roger is sure to come home to - night ? "
103014	103018	102883	102883	Osborne	213	" Quite sure . "
103019	103046	103098	103098	he	2807	" You are staying here , are you not ? Do you often see my mother , or does this omnipotent nurse keep you out too ? "
103047	103081	103098	103098	he	2807	" Mrs. Hamley has n't asked for me for three days now , and I do n't go into her room unless she asks . I 'm leaving on Friday , I believe . "
103082	103094	103098	103098	he	2807	" My mother was very fond of you , I know . "
103115	103131	103098	103098	he	2807	" I suppose -- do you know whether she is quite conscious -- quite herself ? "
103132	103137	103139	103139	Molly	221	" Not always conscious , "
103143	103163	103139	103139	Molly	221	" She has to take so many opiates . But she never wanders , only forgets , and sleeps . "
103164	103171	103173	103173	he	2807	" Oh , mother , mother ! "
104201	104221	104222	104222	She	221	" Am I in your way ? I only came here for a minute to look for some books . "
104239	104279	104222	104222	She	221	" Not at all . It is I who am disturbing you . I must just write a letter for the post , and then I shall be gone . Is not this open door too cold for you ? "
104280	104292	104293	104293	She	221	" Oh , no . It is so fresh and pleasant . "
104401	104421	104422	104422	Osborne	213	" Here 's a letter from your wife , Osborne . I went past the post - office and thought-- "
104431	104445	104446	104446	Roger	211	" Roger ! what have you done ! Do n't you see her ? "
104497	104527	104492	104492	she	221	" I am so sorry ! I did n't wish to hear it , but I could n't help it . You will trust me , wo n't you ? "
104540	104549	104532	104532	she	221	eyes--"Please say you know I shall not tell . "
104550	104557	104559	104559	Osborne	213	" We ca n't help it , "
104563	104584	104559	104559	Osborne	213	" Only Roger , who knew of what importance it was , ought to have looked round him before speaking . "
104585	104590	104592	104592	Roger	211	" So I should , "
104594	104619	104621	104621	he	211	" I 'm more vexed with myself than you can conceive . Not but what I 'm as sure of you as of myself , "
104627	104632	104634	104634	Osborne	213	" Yes ; but , "
104636	104666	104634	104634	Osborne	213	" you see how many chances there are that even the best - meaning persons may let out what it is of such consequence to me to keep secret . "
104667	104675	104677	104677	Roger	211	" I know you think it so , "
104679	104701	104677	104677	Roger	211	" Well , do n't let us begin that old discussion again -- at any rate , before a third person . "
104735	104768	104733	104733	she	221	" I 'm going away . Perhaps I ought not to have been here . I 'm very sorry -- very . But I 'll try and forget what I 've heard . "
104769	104776	104778	104778	Osborne	213	" You ca n't do that , "
104783	104848	104778	104778	Osborne	213	" But will you promise me never to speak about it to any one -- not even to me , or to Roger ? Will you try to act and speak as if you had never heard it ? I 'm sure , from what Roger has told me about you , that if you give me this promise I may rely upon it . "
104849	104856	104858	104858	Molly	221	" Yes ; I will promise , "
104886	104927	104883	104883	She	213	" I think I should have done so , even without a promise . But it is , perhaps , better to bind oneself . I will go away now . I wish I 'd never come into this room . "
105243	105253	105223	105223	she	213	" The drawing - room must be refurnished when Osborne marries"--or

105327	105722	105305	105306	Mrs. Osborne	213	"--These , and similar speeches had given Molly the impression of the future Mrs. Osborne as of some beautiful grand young lady , whose very presence would make the old Hall into a stately , formal mansion , instead of the pleasant , unceremonious home that it was at present . Osborne , too , who had spoken with such languid criticism to Mrs. Gibson about various country belles , and even in his own home was apt to give himself airs -- only at home his airs were poetically fastidious , while with Mrs. Gibson they had been socially fastidious -- what unspeakably elegant beauty had he chosen for his wife ? Who had satisfied him ; and yet satisfying him , had to have her marriage kept in concealment from his parents ? At length Molly tore herself up from her wonderings . It was of no use : she could not find out ; she might not even try . The blank wall of her promise blocked up the way . Perhaps it was not even right to wonder , and endeavour to remember slight speeches , casual mentions of a name , so as to piece them together into something coherent . Molly dreaded seeing either of the brothers again ; but they all met at dinner - time as if nothing had happened . The Squire was taciturn , either from melancholy or displeasure . He had never spoken to Osborne since his return , excepting about the commonest trifles , when intercourse could not be avoided ; and his wife 's state oppressed him like a heavy cloud coming over the light of his day . Osborne put on an indifferent manner to his father , which Molly felt sure was assumed ; but it was not conciliatory for all that . Roger , quiet , steady , and natural , talked more than all the others ; but he too was uneasy , and in distress on many accounts . To - day he principally addressed himself to Molly ; entering into rather long narrations of late discoveries in natural history , which kept up the current of talk without requiring much reply from any one . Molly had expected Osborne to look something different from usual -- conscious , or ashamed , or resentful , or even "
105723	106107	106109	106110	any one	7236	married"--but he was exactly the Osborne of the morning -- handsome , elegant , languid in manner and in look ; cordial with his brother , polite towards her , secretly uneasy at the state of things between his father and himself . She would never have guessed the concealed romance which lay _ perdu _ under that every - day behaviour . She had always wished to come into direct contact with a love - story : here she had , and she only found it very uncomfortable ; there was a sense of concealment and uncertainty about it all ; and her honest straightforward father , her quiet life at Hollingford , which , even with all its drawbacks , was above - board , and where everybody knew what everybody was doing , seemed secure and pleasant in comparison . Of course she felt great pain at quitting the Hall , and at the mute farewell she had taken of her sleeping and unconscious friend . But leaving Mrs. Hamley now was a different thing to what it had been a fortnight ago . Then she was wanted at any moment , and felt herself to be of comfort . Now her very existence seemed forgotten by the poor lady whose body appeared to be living so long after her soul . She was sent home in the carriage , loaded with true thanks from every one of the family . Osborne ransacked the greenhouses for flowers for her ; Roger had chosen her out books of every kind . The Squire himself kept shaking her hand , without being able to speak his gratitude , till at last he took her in his arms , and kissed her as he would have done a daughter . CHAPTER XIX . CYNTHIA 'S ARRIVAL . Molly 's father was not at home when she returned ; and there was no one to give her a welcome . Mrs. Gibson was out paying calls , the servants told Molly . She went upstairs to her own room , meaning to unpack and arrange her borrowed books . Rather to her surprise she saw the chamber , corresponding to her own , being dusted ; water and towels too were being carried in . "

Molly 's depressed spirits sprang up again with bright elasticity . She longed for Mrs. Gibson 's return , to ask her all about it : it must be very sudden , for Mr. Gibson had said nothing of it at the Hall the day before . No quiet reading now ; the books were hardly put away with Molly 's usual neatness . She went down into the drawing - room , and could not settle to anything . At last Mrs. Gibson came home , tired out with her walk and her heavy velvet cloak . Until that was taken off , and she had rested herself for a few minutes , she seemed quite unable to attend to Molly 's questions . "

107058	107115	107055	107055	she	265	" she cried out at last . Her father was walking by the side of a tall young lady ; William the gardener was wheeling along a great cargo of baggage . Molly flew to the front - door , and had it wide open to admit the new - comer some time before she arrived . "
107141	107219	107136	107136	sisters	856	" Molly saw the beautiful , tall , swaying figure , against the light of the open door , but could not see any of the features that were , for the moment , in shadow . A sudden gush of shyness had come over her just at the instant , and quenched the embrace she would have given a moment before . But Cynthia took her in her arms , and kissed her on both cheeks . "
107224	107277	107222	107222	mamma	7255	" she said , looking beyond Molly on to the stairs where Mrs. Gibson stood , wrapped up in a shawl , and shivering in the cold . She ran past Molly and Mr. Gibson , who rather averted their eyes from this first greeting between mother and child . Mrs. Gibson said-- "
107293	107294	107287	107287	You	7255	" "
107300	107304	107305	107305	I	0	" said Cynthia . "

107337	107571	107333	107333	we	2900	" said Mrs. Gibson , in rather a meaning way . Indeed there were evidently hidden allusions in their seeming commonplace speeches . When they all came into the full light and repose of the drawing - room , Molly was absorbed in the contemplation of Cynthia 's beauty . Perhaps her features were not regular ; but the changes in her expressive countenance gave one no time to think of that . Her smile was perfect ; her pouting charming ; the play of the face was in the mouth . Her eyes were beautifully shaped , but their expression hardly seemed to vary . In colouring she was not unlike her mother ; only she had not so much of the red - haired tints in her complexion ; and her long - shaped , serious grey eyes were fringed with dark lashes , instead of her mother 's insipid flaxen ones . Molly fell in love with her , so to speak , on the instant . She sate there warming her feet and hands , as much at her ease as if she had been there all her life ; not particularly attending to her mother -- who , all the time , was studying either her or her dress -- measuring Molly and Mr. Gibson with grave observant looks , as if guessing how she should like them . "

107610	107636	107637	107637	Molly	221	" He looked round at his wife , at Cynthia 's mother , but she did not seem inclined to leave the warm room again . "

107756	107788	107723	107723	I	0	" said Cynthia , getting hold of both Molly 's hands , and looking steadily into her face , but in such a manner that she did not dislike the inspection . "
107831	107857	107822	107822	I	0	" [ Illustration : FIRST IMPRESSIONS . ] Molly could not help smiling at the way this was said . Cynthia replied to her smile . "
107919	108287	109009	109009	They	2911	" Molly went into her own room , waiting to show Cynthia down to the dining - room . Not that , in the moderate - sized house , there was any difficulty in finding the way . A very little trouble in conjecturing would enable a stranger to discover any room . But Cynthia had so captivated Molly , that she wanted to devote herself to the new - comer 's service . Ever since she had heard of the probability of her having a sister--(she called her a sister , but whether it was a Scotch sister , or a sister _  la mode de Brtagne _ , would have puzzled most people)--Molly had allowed her fancy to dwell much on the idea of Cynthia 's coming ; and in the short time since they had met , Cynthia 's unconscious power of fascination had been exercised upon her . Some people have this power . Of course , its effects are only manifested in the susceptible . A school - girl may be found in every school who attracts and influences all the others , not by her virtues , nor her beauty , nor her sweetness , nor her cleverness , but by something that can neither be described nor reasoned upon . It is the something alluded to in the old lines:-- Love me not for comely grace , For my pleasing eye and face ; No , nor for my constant heart,-- For these may change , and turn to ill , And thus true love may sever . But love me on , and know not why , So hast thou the same reason still To dote upon me ever . A woman will have this charm , not only over men but over her own sex ; it can not be defined , or rather it is so delicate a mixture of many gifts and qualities that it is impossible to decide on the proportions of each . Perhaps it is incompatible with very high principle ; as its essence seems to consist in the most exquisite power of adaptation to varying people and still more various moods ; "
108295	109008	109009	109009	They	2911	" At any rate , Molly might soon have been aware that Cynthia was not remarkable for unflinching morality ; but the glamour thrown over her would have prevented Molly from any attempt at penetrating into and judging her companion 's character , even had such processes been the least in accordance with her own disposition . Cynthia was very beautiful , and was so well aware of this fact that she had forgotten to care about it ; no one with such loveliness ever appeared so little conscious of it . Molly would watch her perpetually as she moved about the room , with the free stately step of some wild animal of the forest -- moving almost , as it were , to the continual sound of music . Her dress , too , though now to our ideas it would be considered ugly and disfiguring , was suited to her complexion and figure , and the fashion of it subdued within due bounds by her exquisite taste . It was inexpensive enough , and the changes in it were but few . Mrs. Gibson professed herself shocked to find that Cynthia had but four gowns , when she might have stocked herself so well , and brought over so many useful French patterns , if she had but patiently waited for her mother 's answer to the letter which she had sent , announcing her return by the opportunity madame had found for her . Molly was hurt for Cynthia at all these speeches ; she thought they implied that the pleasure which her mother felt in seeing her a fortnight sooner after her two years ' absence was inferior to that which she would have received from a bundle of silver - paper patterns . But Cynthia took no apparent notice of the frequent recurrence of these small complaints . Indeed , she received much of what her mother said with a kind of complete indifference , that made Mrs. Gibson hold her rather in awe ; and she was much more communicative to Molly than to her own child . With regard to dress , however , Cynthia soon showed that she was her mother 's own daughter in the manner in which she could use her deft and nimble fingers . She was a capital workwoman ; and , unlike Molly , who excelled in plain sewing , but had no notion of dressmaking or millinery , she could repeat the fashions she had only seen in passing along the streets of Boulogne , with one or two pretty rapid movements of her hands , as she turned and twisted the ribbons and gauze her mother furnished her with . So she refurbished Mrs. Gibson 's wardrobe ; doing it all in a sort of contemptuous manner , the source of which Molly could not quite make out . Day after day the course of these small frivolities was broken in upon by the news Mr. Gibson brought of Mrs. Hamley 's nearer approach to death . Molly -- very often sitting by Cynthia , and surrounded by ribbon , and wire , and net -- heard the bulletins like the toll of a funeral bell at a marriage feast . Her father sympathized with her . It was the loss of a dear friend to him too ; but he was so accustomed to death , that it seemed to him but as it was , the natural end of all things human . To Molly , the death of some one she had known so well and loved so much , was a sad and gloomy phenomenon . She loathed the small vanities with which she was surrounded , and would wander out into the frosty garden , and pace the walk , which was both sheltered and concealed by evergreens . At length -- and yet it was not so long , not a fortnight since Molly had left the Hall -- the end came . Mrs. Hamley had sunk out of life as gradually as she had sunk out of consciousness and her place in this world . The quiet waves closed over her , and her place knew her no more . "

109035	109179	109027	109027	he	211	" Mr. Gibson had come in very late , and was having a solitary dinner in the dining - room . Molly was sitting near him to keep him company . Cynthia and her mother were upstairs . The latter was trying on a head - dress which Cynthia had made for her . Molly remained downstairs after her father had gone out afresh on his final round among his town patients . The fire was growing very low , and the lights were waning . Cynthia came softly in , and taking Molly 's listless hand , that hung down by her side , sat at her feet on the rug , chafing her chilly fingers without speaking . The tender action thawed the tears that had been gathering heavily at Molly 's heart , and they came dropping down her cheeks . "

But there was no ill - nature , and , in a general way , no attempt at procuring any advantage for herself in all her deviations ; and there was often such a latent sense of fun in them that Molly could not help being amused with them in fact , though she condemned them in theory . Cynthia 's playfulness of manner glossed such failings over with a kind of charm ; and yet , at times , she was so soft and sympathetic that Molly could not resist her , even when she affirmed the most startling things . The little account she made of her own beauty pleased Mr. Gibson extremely ; and her pretty deference to him won his heart . She was restless too , till she had attacked Molly 's dress , after she had remodelled her mother 's . "
110542	110555	110345	110345	I	0	" said she as she began upon one of Molly 's gowns . "

All the time she worked , she sang ; she had a sweet voice in singing , as well as in speaking , and used to run up and down her gay French _ chansons _ without any difficulty ; so flexible in the art was she . Yet she did not seem to care for music . She rarely touched the piano , on which Molly practised with daily conscientiousness . Cynthia was always willing to answer questions about her previous life , though , after the first , she rarely alluded to it of herself ; but she was a most sympathetic listener to all Molly 's innocent confidences of joys and sorrows : sympathizing even to the extent of wondering how she could endure Mr. Gibson 's second marriage , and why she did not take some active steps of rebellion . In spite of all this agreeable and pungent variety of companionship at home , Molly yearned after the Hamleys . If there had been a woman in that family she would probably have received many little notes , and heard numerous details which were now lost to her , or summed up in condensed accounts of her father 's visits at the Hall , which , since his dear patient was dead , were only occasional .

He had grown accustomed to his wife by this time , and regarded silence on his own part as a great preservative against long inconsequential arguments . But every time that Mrs. Gibson was struck by Cynthia 's beauty , she thought it more and more advisable that Mr. Osborne Hamley should be cheered up by a quiet little dinner - party . As yet no one but the ladies of Hollingford and Mr. Ashton , the vicar -- that hopeless and impracticable old bachelor -- had seen Cynthia ; and what was the good of having a lovely daughter , if there were none but old women to admire her ? Cynthia herself appeared extremely indifferent upon the subject , and took very little notice of her mother 's constant talk about the gaieties that were possible , and the gaieties that were impossible , in Hollingford . She exerted herself just as much to charm the two Miss Brownings as she would have done to delight Osborne Hamley , or any other young heir . That is to say , she used no exertion , but simply followed her own nature , which was to attract every one of those she was thrown amongst . The exertion seemed rather to be to refrain from doing so , and to protest , as she often did , by slight words and expressive looks against her mother 's words and humours -- alike against her folly and her caresses . Molly was almost sorry for Mrs. Gibson , who seemed so unable to gain influence over her child . One day Cynthia read Molly 's thought . "

Mrs. Gibson and she were sitting together in the drawing - room ; Cynthia was out -- gone into the town a - shopping -- when the door was opened , the name given , and in walked the young man . His entrance seemed to cause more confusion than Molly could well account for . He came in with the same air of easy assurance with which he had received her and her father at Ashcombe Manor - house . He looked remarkably handsome in his riding - dress , and with the open - air exercise he had just had . But Mrs. Gibson 's smooth brows contracted a little at the sight of him , and her reception of him was much cooler than that which she usually gave to visitors . Yet there was a degree of agitation in it , which surprised Molly a little . Mrs. Gibson was at her everlasting worsted - work frame when Mr. Preston entered the room ; but somehow in rising to receive him , she threw down her basket of crewels , and , declining Molly 's offer to help her , she would pick up all the reels herself , before she asked her visitor to sit down . He stood there , hat in hand , affecting an interest in the recovery of the worsted which Molly was sure he did not feel ; for all the time his eyes were glancing round the room , and taking note of the details in the arrangement .

She looked up . He was playing with his hat , almost as if he did not care to have any answer to his question . Yet he was listening acutely , and with a half smile on his face . Mrs. Gibson reddened a little , and hesitated,-- "

112682	112714	112672	112672	she	1247	" asked Molly of herself , yet glad that Mr. Preston 's curiosity was baffled . He still smiled ; but this time he looked up at Mrs. Gibson , as he asked,--"You

112786	113061	112783	112783	I	0	" Just at this moment , Molly heard the familiar sound of the click and opening of the front door . She knew it must be Cynthia ; and , conscious of some mysterious reason which made Mrs. Gibson wish to conceal her daughter 's whereabouts from Mr. Preston , and maliciously desirous to baffle him , she rose to leave the room , and meet Cynthia on the stairs ; but one of the lost crewels of worsted had entangled itself in her gown and feet , and before she had freed herself of the encumbrance , Cynthia had opened the drawing - room door , and stood in it , looking at her mother , at Molly , at Mr. Preston , but not advancing one step . Her colour , which had been brilliant the first moment of her entrance , faded away as she gazed ; but her eyes -- her beautiful eyes -- usually so soft and grave , seemed to fill with fire , and her brows to contract , as she took the resolution to come forward and take her place among the three , who were all looking at her with different emotions . She moved calmly and slowly forwards ; Mr. Preston went a step or two to meet her , his hand held out , and the whole expression of his face that of eager delight . But she took no notice of the outstretched hand , nor of the chair that he offered her . She sate down on a little sofa in one of the windows , and called Molly to her . "
113067	113071	112783	112783	I	0	" said she . "
113087	113332	112783	112783	I	0	" and so she went on , forcing herself to speak about these trifles as if they were all the world to her , and she had no attention to throw away on her mother and her mother 's visitor . Mr. Preston took his cue from her . He , too , talked of the news of the day , the local gossip -- but Molly , who glanced up at him from time to time , was almost alarmed by the bad expression of suppressed anger , almost amounting to vindictiveness , which entirely marred his handsome looks . She did not wish to look again ; and tried rather to back up Cynthia 's efforts at maintaining a separate conversation . Yet she could not help overhearing Mrs. Gibson 's strain after increased civility , as if to make up for Cynthia 's rudeness , and , if possible , to deprecate his anger . She talked perpetually , as though her object were to detain him ; whereas , previous to Cynthia 's return , she had allowed frequent pauses in the conversation , as though to give him the opportunity to take his leave . In the course of the conversation between them the Hamleys came up . Mrs. Gibson was never unwilling to dwell upon Molly 's intimacy with this county family ; and when the latter caught the sound of her own name , her stepmother was saying,-- "

113545	113679	113541	113543	Poor Mrs. Hamley	328	" said she , very softly , as if to herself . Cynthia took her hand , in sympathy with Molly 's sad and tender look , rather than because she understood all that was passing in her mind , nor did she quite understand it herself . A death that had come out of time ; a wonder whether the dead knew what passed upon the earth they had left -- the brilliant Osborne 's failure , Roger 's success ; the vanity of human wishes,--all these thoughts , and what they suggested , were inextricably mingled up in her mind . She came to herself in a few minutes . Mr. Preston was saying all the unpleasant things he could think of about the Hamleys in a tone of false sympathy . "

114069	114201	114202	114202	You	3048	" The only person of whom Cynthia appeared to be wholesomely afraid was Mr. Gibson . When he was present she was more careful in speaking , and showed more deference to her mother . Her evident respect for him , and desire to win his good opinion , made her curb herself before him ; and in this manner she earned his favour as a lively , sensible girl , with just so much knowledge of the world as made her a very desirable companion to Molly . Indeed , she made something of the same kind of impression on all men . They were first struck with her personal appearance ; and then with her pretty deprecating manner , which appealed to them much as if she had said , "
114217	114265	114207	114207	I	0	" It was a way she had ; it meant nothing really ; and she was hardly conscious of it herself ; but it was very captivating all the same . Even old Williams , the gardener , felt it ; he said to his confidante , Molly-- "
114318	115000	114311	114311	she	3050	" If Molly had not had the sweetest disposition in the world she might have become jealous of all the allegiance laid at Cynthia 's feet ; but she never thought of comparing the amount of admiration and love which they each received . Yet once she did feel a little as if Cynthia were poaching on her manor . The invitation to the quiet dinner had been sent to Osborne Hamley , and declined by him . But he thought it right to call soon afterwards . It was the first time Molly had seen any of the family since she left the Hall , just before Mrs. Hamley 's death ; and there was so much that she wanted to ask . She tried to wait patiently till Mrs. Gibson had exhausted the first gush of her infinite nothings ; and then Molly came in with her modest questions . How was the Squire ? Had he returned to his old habits ? Had his health suffered?--putting each inquiry with as light and delicate a touch as if she had been dressing a wound . She hesitated a little , a very little , before speaking of Roger ; for just one moment the thought flitted across her mind , that Osborne might feel the contrast between his own and his brother 's college career too painfully to like to have it referred to ; but then she remembered the generous brotherly love that had always existed between the two , and had just entered upon the subject , when Cynthia in obedience to her mother 's summons , came into the room , and took up her work . No one could have been quieter -- she hardly uttered a word ; but Osborne seemed to fall under her power at once . He no longer gave his undivided attention to Molly . He cut short his answers to her questions ; and by - and - by , without Molly 's rightly understanding how it was , he had turned towards Cynthia , and was addressing himself to her . Molly saw the look of content on Mrs. Gibson 's face ; perhaps it was her own mortification at not having heard all she wished to know about Roger , which gave her a keener insight than usual , but certain it is that all at once she perceived that Mrs. Gibson would not dislike a marriage between Osborne and Cynthia , and considered the present occasion as an auspicious beginning . Remembering the secret which she had been let into so unwillingly , Molly watched his behaviour , almost as if she had been retained in the interest of the absent wife ; but , after all , thinking as much of the possibility of his attracting Cynthia as of the unknown and mysterious Mrs. Osborne Hamley . His manner was expressive of great interest and of strong prepossession in favour of the beautiful girl to whom he was talking . He was in deep mourning , which showed off his slight figure and delicate refined face . But there was nothing of flirting , as far as Molly understood the meaning of the word , in either looks or words . Cynthia , too , was extremely quiet ; she was always much quieter with men than with women ; it was part of the charm of her soft allurement that she was so passive . They were talking of France . Mrs. Gibson herself had passed two or three years of her girlhood there ; and Cynthia 's late return from Boulogne made it a very natural subject of conversation . But Molly was thrown out of it ; and with her heart still unsatisfied as to the details of Roger 's success , she had to stand up at last , and receive Osborne 's good - by , scarcely longer or more intimate than his farewell to Cynthia . As soon as he was gone , Mrs. Gibson began in his praise . "

[ Illustration ( untitled ) ] It appeared as if Mrs. Gibson 's predictions were likely to be verified ; for Osborne Hamley found his way to her drawing - room pretty frequently . To be sure , sometimes prophets can help on the fulfilment of their own prophecies ; and Mrs. Gibson was not passive . Molly was altogether puzzled by his manners and ways . He spoke of occasional absences from the Hall , without exactly saying where he had been . But that was not her idea of the conduct of a married man ; who , she imagined , ought to have a house and servants , and pay rent and taxes , and live with his wife . Who this mysterious wife might be faded into insignificance before the wonder of where she was . London , Cambridge , Dover , nay , even France , were mentioned by him as places to which he had been on these different little journeys . These facts came out quite casually , almost as if he was unaware of what he was betraying . Sometimes he dropped out such sentences as these:--"Ah
116161	116164	116165	116165	I	0	" Or , "
116178	116182	116175	116175	he	194	" & amp;c . "
116204	116409	116175	116175	he	194	" Perhaps , in the rapid flow of conversation , these small revelations were noticed by no one but Molly ; whose interest and curiosity were always hovering over the secret she had become possessed of , in spite of all her self - reproach for allowing her thoughts to dwell on what was still to be kept as a mystery . It was also evident to her that Osborne was not too happy at home . He had lost the slight touch of cynicism which he had affected when he was expected to do wonders at college ; and that was one good result of his failure . If he did not give himself the trouble of appreciating other people , and their performances , at any rate his conversation was not so amply sprinkled with critical pepper . He was more absent , not so agreeable , Mrs. Gibson thought , but did not say . He looked ill in health ; but that might be the consequence of the real depression of spirits which Molly occasionally saw peeping out through all his pleasant surface - talk . Now and then , when he was talking directly to her , he referred to "
116417	116420	116175	116175	he	194	" or , "
116430	117050	117053	117053	Roger	211	" and then his voice sank , and a gloom came over his countenance , and Molly longed to express her own deep sympathy . He did not often mention his father ; and Molly thought she could read in his manner , when he did , that something of the painful restraint she had noticed when she was last at the Hall still existed between them . Nearly every particular she knew of the family interior she had heard from Mrs. Hamley , and she was uncertain how far her father was acquainted with them ; so she did not like to question him too closely ; nor was he a man to be so questioned as to the domestic affairs of his patients . Sometimes she wondered if it was a dream -- that short half - hour in the library at Hamley Hall -- when she had learnt a fact which seemed so all - important to Osborne , yet which made so little difference in his way of life -- either in speech or action . During the twelve or fourteen hours that she had remained at the Hall afterwards , no further allusion had been made to his marriage , either by himself or by Roger . It was , indeed , very like a dream . Probably Molly would have been rendered much more uncomfortable in the possession of her secret if Osborne had struck her as particularly attentive in his devotion to Cynthia . She evidently amused and attracted him , but not in any lively or passionate kind of way . He admired her beauty , and seemed to feel her charm ; but he would leave her side , and come to sit near Molly , if anything reminded him of his mother , about which he could talk to her , and to her alone . Yet he came so often to the Gibsons , that Mrs. Gibson might be excused for the fancy she had taken into her head , that it was for Cynthia 's sake . He liked the lounge , the friendliness , the company of two intelligent girls of beauty and manners above the average ; one of whom stood in a peculiar relation to him , as having been especially beloved by the mother whose memory he cherished so fondly . Knowing himself to be out of the category of bachelors , he was , perhaps , too indifferent as to other people 's ignorance , and its possible consequences . Somehow , Molly did not like to be the first to introduce Roger 's name into the conversation , so she lost many an opportunity of hearing intelligence about him . Osborne was often so languid or so absent that he only followed the lead of talk ; and as an awkward fellow , who had paid her no particular attention , and as a second son , Roger was not pre - eminent in Mrs. Gibson 's thoughts ; Cynthia had never seen him , and the freak did not take her often to speak about him . He had not come home since he had obtained his high place in the mathematical lists : that Molly knew ; and she knew , too , that he was working hard for something -- she supposed a fellowship -- and that was all . Osborne 's tone in speaking of him was always the same : every word , every inflection of the voice breathed out affection and respect -- nay , even admiration ! And this from the _ nil admirari _ brother , who seldom carried his exertions so far . "

Cynthia was standing a little behind Molly when Roger asked for this introduction . She was generally dressed with careless grace . Molly , who was delicate neatness itself , used sometimes to wonder how Cynthia 's tumbled gowns , tossed away so untidily , had the art of looking so well , and falling in such graceful folds . For instance , the pale lilac muslin gown she wore this evening had been worn many times before , and had looked unfit to wear again till Cynthia put it on . Then the limpness became softness , and the very creases took the lines of beauty . Molly , in a daintily clean pink muslin , did not look half so elegantly dressed as Cynthia . The grave eyes that the latter raised when she had to be presented to Roger had a sort of child - like innocence and wonder about them , which did not quite belong to Cynthia 's character . She put on her armour of magic that evening -- involuntarily as she always did ; but , on the other side , she could not help trying her power on strangers . Molly had always felt that she should have a right to a good long talk with Roger when she next saw him ; and that he would tell her , or she should gather from him all the details she so longed to hear about the Squire -- about the Hall -- about Osborne -- about himself . He was just as cordial and friendly as ever with her . If Cynthia had not been there , all would have gone on as she had anticipated ; but of all the victims to Cynthia 's charms he fell most prone and abject . Molly saw it all , as she was sitting next to Miss Phoebe at the tea - table , acting right - hand , and passing cake , cream , sugar , with such busy assiduity that every one besides herself thought that her mind , as well as her hands , was fully occupied . She tried to talk to the two shy girls , as in virtue of her two years ' seniority she thought herself bound to do ; and the consequence was , she went upstairs with the twain clinging to her arms , and willing to swear an eternal friendship . Nothing would satisfy them but that she must sit between them at vingt - un ; and they were so desirous of her advice in the important point of fixing the price of the counters that she could not ever have joined in the animated conversation going on between Roger and Cynthia . Or , rather , it would be more correct to say that Roger was talking in a most animated manner to Cynthia , whose sweet eyes were fixed upon his face with a look of great interest in all he was saying , while it was only now and then she made her low replies . Molly caught a few words occasionally in intervals of business . "

It took all her patience to make up little packets of counters , and settle , as the arbiter of the game , whether it would be better for the round or the oblong counters to be reckoned as six . And when all was done , and every one sate in their places round the table , Roger and Cynthia had to be called twice before they came . They stood up , it is true , at the first sound of their names ; but they did not move -- Roger went on talking , Cynthia listening till the second call ; when they hurried to the table and tried to appear , all on a sudden , quite interested in the great questions of the game -- namely , the price of three dozen counters , and whether , all things considered , it would be better to call the round counters or the oblong half - a - dozen each . Miss Browning , drumming the pack of cards on the table , and quite ready to begin dealing , decided the matter by saying , "

119779	119863	119777	119777	Willie	333	" as he thought it was this boyish sobriquet which prevented Cynthia from attending as much to him as to Mr. Roger Hamley ; he also was charmed by the charmer , who found leisure to give him one or two of her sweet smiles . On his return home to his grand - mamma 's , he gave out one or two very decided and rather original opinions , quite opposed -- as was natural -- to his sisters ' . One was-- "

She had no particular turn for gambling in her ; and whatever her card might be , she regularly put on two counters , indifferent as to whether she won or lost . Cynthia , on the contrary , staked high , and was at one time very rich , but ended by being in debt to Molly something like six shillings . She had forgotten her purse , she said , and was obliged to borrow from the more provident Molly , who was aware that the round game of which Miss Browning had spoken to her was likely to require money . If it was not a very merry affair for all the individuals concerned , it was a very noisy one on the whole . Molly thought it was going to last till midnight ; but punctually , as the clock struck nine , the little maid - servant staggered in under the weight of a tray loaded with sandwiches , cakes , and jelly . This brought on a general move ; and Roger , who appeared to have been on the watch for something of the kind , came and took a chair by Molly . "

The short conversation had been very pleasant , and his manner had had just the brotherly kindness of old times ; but it was not quite the manner he had to Cynthia ; and Molly half thought she would have preferred the latter . He was now hovering about Cynthia , who had declined the offer of refreshments from Willie Orford . Roger was tempting her , and with playful entreaties urging her to take some thing from him . Every word they said could be heard by the whole room ; yet every word was said , on Roger 's part at least , as if he could not have spoken it in that peculiar manner to any one else . At length , and rather more because she was weary of being entreated , than because it was his wish , Cynthia took a macaroon , and Roger seemed as happy as though she had crowned him with flowers . The whole affair was as trifling and commonplace as could be in itself ; hardly worth noticing ; and yet Molly did notice it , and felt uneasy ; she could not tell why . As it turned out , it was a rainy night , and Mrs. Gibson sent a fly for the two girls instead of old Betty 's substitute . Both Cynthia and Molly thought of the possibility of their taking the two Orford girls back to their grandmother 's , and so saving them a wet walk ; but Cynthia got the start in speaking about it ; and the thanks and the implied praise for thoughtfulness were hers . When they got home Mr. and Mrs. Gibson were sitting in the drawing - room , quite ready to be amused by any details of the evening . Cynthia began,-- "

The two girls had usually some nightly conversation in one or other of their bed - rooms ; but to - night Cynthia said something or other about being terribly tired , and hastily shut her door . The very next day , Roger came to pay his promised call . Molly was out in the garden with Williams , planning the arrangement of some new flower - beds , and deep in her employment of placing pegs upon the lawn to mark out the different situations , when , standing up to mark the effect , her eye was caught by the figure of a gentleman , sitting with his back to the light , leaning forwards and talking , or listening , eagerly . Molly knew the shape of the head perfectly , and hastily began to put off her brown - holland gardening apron , emptying the pockets as she spoke to Williams . "

123008	123043	123006	123006	Molly	221	" CHAPTER XXII . THE OLD SQUIRE 'S TROUBLES . Affairs were going on worse at the Hall than Roger had liked to tell . Moreover , very much of the discomfort there arose from "
123047	123419	123006	123006	Molly	221	" as people express it , which is always indescribable and indefinable . Quiet and passive as Mrs. Hamley had always been in appearance , she was the ruling spirit of the house as long as she lived . The directions to the servants , down to the most minute particulars , came from her sitting - room , or from the sofa on which she lay . Her children always knew where to find her ; and to find her , was to find love and sympathy . Her husband , who was often restless and angry from one cause or another , always came to her to be smoothed down and put right . He was conscious of her pleasant influence over him , and became at peace with himself when in her presence ; just as a child is at ease when with some one who is both firm and gentle . But the keystone of the family arch was gone , and the stones of which it was composed began to fall apart . It is always sad when a sorrow of this kind seems to injure the character of the mourning survivors . Yet , perhaps , this injury may be only temporary or superficial ; the judgments so constantly passed upon the way in which people bear the loss of those whom they have deeply loved , appear to be even more cruel , and wrongly meted out , than human judgments generally are . To careless observers , for instance , it would seem as though the Squire was rendered more capricious and exacting , more passionate and authoritative , by his wife 's death . The truth was , that it occurred at a time when many things came to harass him , and some to bitterly disappoint him ; and _ she _ was no longer there to whom he used to carry his sore heart for the gentle balm of her sweet words . So the sore heart ached and smarted intensely ; and often , when he saw how his violent conduct affected others , he could have cried out for their pity , instead of their anger and resentment : "
123431	123954	123006	123006	Molly	221	" How often have such dumb thoughts gone up from the hearts of those who have taken hold of their sorrow by the wrong end , as prayers against sin ! And when the Squire saw that his servants were learning to dread him , and his first - born to avoid him , he did not blame them . He knew he was becoming a domestic tyrant ; it seemed as if all circumstances conspired against him , and as if he was too weak to struggle with them ; else , why did everything in doors and out of doors go so wrong just now , when all he could have done , had things been prosperous , was to have submitted , in very imperfect patience , to the loss of his wife ? But just when he needed ready money to pacify Osborne 's creditors , the harvest had turned out remarkably plentiful , and the price of corn had sunk down to a level it had not touched for years . The Squire had insured his life at the time of his marriage for a pretty large sum . It was to be a provision for his wife , if she survived him , and for their younger children . Roger was the only representative of these interests now ; but the Squire was unwilling to lose the insurance by ceasing to pay the annual sum . He would not , if he could , have sold any part of the estate which he inherited from his father ; and , besides , it was strictly entailed . He had sometimes thought how wise a step it would have been could he have sold a portion of it , and with the purchase - money have drained and reclaimed the remainder ; and at length , learning from some neighbour that Government would make certain advances for drainage , & amp;c . , at a very low rate of interest , on condition that the work was done , and the money repaid , within a given time , his wife had urged him to take advantage of the proffered loan . But now that she was no longer there to encourage him , and take an interest in the progress of the work , he grew indifferent to it himself , and cared no more to go out on his stout roan cob , and sit square on his seat , watching the labourers on the marshy land all overgrown with rushes ; speaking to them from time to time in their own strong nervous country dialect : but the interest to Government had to be paid all the same , whether the men worked well or ill . Then the roof of the Hall let in the melted snow - water this winter ; and , on examination , it turned out that a new roof was absolutely required . The men who had come about the advances made to Osborne by the London money - lender , had spoken disparagingly of the timber on the estate--"Very
124004	124443	123995	123997	young Mr. Hamley	234	" The remarks had come round to the squire 's ears . He loved the trees he had played under as a boy as if they were living creatures ; that was on the romantic side of his nature . Merely looking at them as representing so many pounds sterling , he had esteemed them highly , and had had , until now , no opinion of another by which to correct his own judgment . So these words of the valuers cut him sharp , although he affected to disbelieve them , and tried to persuade himself that he did so . But , after all , these cares and disappointments did not touch the root of his deep resentment against Osborne . There is nothing like wounded affection for giving poignancy to anger . And the Squire believed that Osborne and his advisers had been making calculations , based upon his own death . He hated the idea so much -- it made him so miserable -- that he would not face it , and define it , and meet it with full inquiry and investigation . He chose rather to cherish the morbid fancy that he was useless in this world -- born under an unlucky star -- that all things went badly under his management . But he did not become humble in consequence . He put his misfortunes down to the score of Fate -- not to his own ; and he imagined that Osborne saw his failures , and that his first - born grudged him his natural term of life . All these fancies would have been set to rights could he have talked them over with his wife ; or even had he been accustomed to mingle much in the society of those whom he esteemed his equals ; but , as has been stated , he was inferior in education to those who should have been his mates ; and perhaps the jealousy and _ mauvaise honte _ that this inferiority had called out long ago , extended itself in some measure to the feelings he entertained towards his sons -- less to Roger than to Osborne , though the former was turning out by far the most distinguished man . But Roger was practical ; interested in all out - of - doors things , and he enjoyed the details , homely enough , which his father sometimes gave him of the every - day occurrences which the latter had noticed in the woods and the fields . Osborne , on the contrary , was what is commonly called "
124446	125012	123995	123997	young Mr. Hamley	234	" delicate almost to effeminacy in dress and in manner ; careful in small observances . All this his father had been rather proud of in the days when he looked forward to a brilliant career at Cambridge for his son ; he had at that time regarded Osborne 's fastidiousness and elegance as another stepping - stone to the high and prosperous marriage which was to restore the ancient fortunes of the Hamley family . But now that Osborne had barely obtained his degree ; that all the boastings of his father had proved vain ; that the fastidiousness had led to unexpected expenses ( to attribute the most innocent cause to Osborne 's debts ) , the poor young man 's ways and manners became a subject of irritation to his father . Osborne was still occupied with his books and his writings when he was at home ; and this mode of passing the greater part of the day gave him but few subjects in common with his father when they did meet at meal times , or in the evenings . Perhaps if Osborne had been able to have more out - of - door amusements it would have been better ; but he was short - sighted , and cared little for the carefully observant pursuits of his brother ; he knew but few young men of his own standing in the county ; his hunting even , of which he was passionately fond , had been curtailed this season , as his father had disposed of one of the two hunters he had been hitherto allowed . The whole stable establishment had been reduced ; perhaps because it was the economy which told most on the enjoyment of both the Squire and Osborne , and which , therefore , the former took a savage pleasure in enforcing . The old carriage -- a heavy family coach bought in the days of comparative prosperity -- was no longer needed after madam 's death , and fell to pieces in the cobwebbed seclusion of the coach - house . The best of the two carriage - horses was taken for a gig , which the Squire now set up ; saying many a time to all who might care to listen to him that it was the first time for generations that the Hamleys of Hamley had not been able to keep their own coach . The other carriage - horse was turned out to grass ; being too old for regular work . Conqueror used to come whinnying up to the park palings whenever he saw the Squire , who had always a piece of bread , or some sugar , or an apple for the old favourite ; and would make many a complaining speech to the dumb animal , telling him of the change of times since both were in their prime . It had never been the Squire 's custom to encourage his boys to invite their friends to the Hall . Perhaps this , too , was owing to his _ mauvaise honte _ , and also to an exaggerated consciousness of the deficiencies of his establishment as compared with what he imagined these lads were accustomed to at home . He explained this once or twice to Osborne and Roger when they were at Rugby . "
125128	125630	125114	125114	he	1310	" Then , of course , they must not visit at houses to whose sons the Squire could not or would not return a like hospitality . On all these points Mrs. Hamley had used her utmost influence without avail ; his prejudices were immoveable . As regarded his position as head of the oldest family in three counties , his pride was invincible ; as regarded himself personally -- ill at ease in the society of his equals , deficient in manners , and in education -- his morbid sensitiveness was too sore and too self - conscious to be called humility . Take one instance from among many similar scenes of the state of feeling between him and his eldest son , which , if it could not be called active discord , showed at least passive estrangement . It took place on an evening in the March succeeding Mrs. Hamley 's death . Roger was at Cambridge . Osborne had also been from home , and he had not volunteered any information as to his absence . The Squire believed that Osborne had been either at Cambridge with his brother , or in London ; he would have liked to hear where his son had been , what he had been doing , and whom he had seen , purely as pieces of news , and as some diversion from the domestic worries and cares which were pressing him hard ; but he was too proud to ask any questions , and Osborne had not given him any details of his journey . This silence had aggravated the Squire 's internal dissatisfaction , and he came home to dinner weary and sore - hearted a day or two after Osborne 's return . It was just six o'clock , and he went hastily into his own little business - room on the ground - floor , and , after washing his hands , came into the drawing - room feeling as if he were very late , but the room was empty . He glanced at the clock over the mantel - piece , as he tried to warm his hands at the fire . The fire had been neglected , and had gone out during the day ; it was now piled up with half - dried wood , which sputtered and smoked instead of doing its duty in blazing and warming the room , through which the keen wind was cutting its way in all directions . The clock had stopped , no one had remembered to wind it up , but by the squire 's watch it was already past dinner - time . The old butler put his head into the room , but , seeing the squire alone , he was about to draw it back , and wait for Mr. Osborne , before announcing dinner . He had hoped to do this unperceived , but the squire caught him in the act . "
125637	125643	125114	125114	he	1310	" he called out sharply . "

While he was doing this , Osborne came in dressed in full evening dress . He always moved slowly ; and this , to begin with , irritated the Squire . Then an uncomfortable consciousness of a black coat , drab trousers , checked cotton cravat , and splashed boots , forced itself upon him as he saw Osborne 's point - device costume . He chose to consider it affectation and finery in Osborne , and was on the point of bursting out with some remark , when the butler , who had watched Osborne downstairs before making the announcement , came in to say dinner was ready . "
125886	125911	125684	125684	Thomas--	337	" said Osborne , pulling out his dainty little watch . He was scarcely more unaware than it of the storm that was brewing . "

That watch had been given him by his father when watches were watches long ago . It had given the law to house - clocks , stable - clocks , kitchen - clocks -- nay , even to Hamley Church clock in its day ; and was it now , in its respectable old age , to be looked down upon by a little whipper - snapper of a French watch which could go into a man 's waistcoat pocket , instead of having to be extricated , with due effort , like a respectable watch of size and position , from a fob in the waistband ? No ! not if the whipper - snapper were backed by all the Horse Guards that ever were , with the Life Guards to boot .

But he was always sensitive to any omission of the usual observances , which might excite remark ; and even with his heavy heart he was careful to pick up the fallen chair , and restore it to its place near the bottom of the table ; and afterwards so to disturb the dishes as to make it appear that they had been touched , before ringing for Robinson . When the latter came in , followed by Thomas , Osborne thought it necessary to say to him that his father was not well , and had gone into the study ; and that he himself wanted no dessert , but would have a cup of coffee in the drawing - room .

He stood on the hearth - rug pondering over his situation . He was not exactly aware how hardly his father was pressed for ready - money ; the Squire had never spoken to him on the subject without being angry ; and many of his loose contradictory statements -- all of which , however contradictory they might appear , had their basis in truth -- were set down by his son to the exaggeration of passion . But it was uncomfortable enough to a young man of Osborne 's age to feel himself continually hampered for want of a five - pound note . The principal supplies for the liberal -- almost luxurious table at the Hall , came off the estate ; so that there was no appearance of poverty as far as the household went ; and as long as Osborne was content at home , he had everything he could wish for ; but he had a wife elsewhere -- he wanted to see her continually -- and that necessitated journeys . She , poor thing ! had to be supported -- where was the money for the journeys and for Aime 's modest wants to come from ? That was the puzzle in Osborne 's mind just now . While he had been at college his allowance -- heir of the Hamleys -- had been three hundred , while Roger had to be content with a hundred less . The payment of these annual sums had given the Squire a good deal of trouble ; but he thought of it as a merely temporary inconvenience ; perhaps unreasonably thought so . Osborne was to do great things ; take high honours , get a fellowship , marry a long - descended heiress , live in some of the many uninhabited rooms at the Hall , and help the squire in the management of the estate that would some time be his . Roger was to be a clergyman ; steady , slow Roger was just fitted for that , and when he declined entering the Church , preferring a life of more activity and adventure , Roger was to be -- anything ; he was useful and practical , and fit for all the employments from which Osborne was shut out by his fastidiousness , and his ( pseudo ) genius ; so it was well he was an eldest son , for he would never have done to struggle through the world ; and as for his settling down to a profession , it would be like cutting blocks with a razor ! And now here was Osborne , living at home , but longing to be elsewhere ; his allowance stopped in reality ; indeed , the punctual payment of it during the last year or two had been owing to his mother 's exertions ; but nothing had been said about its present cessation by either father or son ; money matters were too sore a subject between them . Every now and then the Squire threw him a ten - pound note or so ; but the sort of suppressed growl with which it was given , and the entire uncertainty as to when he might receive such gifts , rendered any calculation based upon their receipt exceedingly vague and uncertain . "
129235	129331	129228	129228	I	0	" thought Osborne , as he stood on the hearth - rug , his back to a blazing fire , his cup of coffee sent up in the rare old china that had belonged to the Hall for generations ; his dress finished , as dress of Osborne 's could hardly fail to be . One could hardly have thought that this elegant young man , standing there in the midst of comfort that verged on luxury , should have been turning over that one great problem in his mind ; but so it was .

In spite of Milton , he thought they might ; and he went to fetch his MSS . out of his room . He sate down near the fire , trying to study them with a critical eye , to represent public opinion as far as he could . He had changed his style since the Mrs. Hemans ' days . He was essentially imitative in his poetic faculty ; and of late he had followed the lead of a popular writer of sonnets . He turned his poems over : they were almost equivalent to an autobiographical passage in his life . Arranging them in their order , they came as follows:-- "

129846	129912	129843	129844	The wife	3335	" Yes , and a French wife ; and a Roman Catholic wife -- and a wife who might be said to have been in service ! And his father 's hatred of the French , both collectively and individually -- collectively , as tumultuous brutal ruffians , who murdered their king , and committed all kinds of bloody atrocities -- individually , as represented by "

As for the form of religion in which Mrs. Osborne Hamley had been brought up , it is enough to say that Catholic emancipation had begun to be talked about by some politicians , and that the sullen roar of the majority of Englishmen , at the bare idea of it , was surging in the distance with ominous threatenings ; the very mention of such a measure before the Squire was , as Osborne well knew , like shaking a red flag before a bull . And then he considered that if Aime had had the unspeakable , the incomparable blessing of being born of English parents , in the very heart of England -- Warwickshire , for instance -- and had never heard of priests , or mass , or confession , or the Pope , or Guy Fawkes , but had been born , baptized , and bred in the Church of England , without having ever seen the outside of a dissenting meeting - house , or a papist chapel -- even with all these advantages , her having been a ( what was the equivalent for "

' nursery - governess ' was a term hardly invented ) nursery - maid , with wages paid down once a quarter , liable to be dismissed at a month 's warning , and having her tea and sugar doled out to her , would be a shock to his father 's old ancestral pride that he would hardly ever get over . "
130220	130224	130216	130216	he	3337	" thought Osborne . "
130232	130297	130226	130226	he	3337	" But if the Squire were to see Aime , he would also hear her speak her pretty broken English -- precious to her husband , as it was in it that she had confessed brokenly with her English tongue , that she loved him soundly with her French heart -- and Squire Hamley piqued himself on being a good hater of the French . "
130535	130669	130671	130671	your	3347	" So he let the evening hours flow on and disappear in reveries like these ; winding up with a sudden determination to try the fate of his poems with a publisher , with the direct expectation of getting money for them , and an ulterior fancy that , if successful , they might work wonders with his father . When Roger came home Osborne did not let a day pass before telling his brother of his plans . He never did conceal anything long from Roger ; the feminine part of his character made him always desirous of a confidant , and as sweet sympathy as he could extract . But Roger 's opinion had no effect on Osborne 's actions ; and Roger knew this full well . So when Osborne began with--"I

131324	131642	131643	131643	I	0	" Roger did soon see . His father had slipped into a habit of silence at meal - times -- a habit which Osborne , who was troubled and anxious enough for his own part , had not striven to break . Father and son sate together , and exchanged all the necessary speeches connected with the occasion civilly enough ; but it was a relief to them when their intercourse was over , and they separated -- the father to brood over his sorrow and his disappointment , which were real and deep enough , and the injury he had received from his boy , which was exaggerated in his mind by his ignorance of the actual steps Osborne had taken to raise money . If the money - lenders had calculated the chances of his father 's life or death in making their bargain , Osborne himself had thought only of how soon and how easily he could get the money requisite for clearing him from all imperious claims at Cambridge , and for enabling him to follow Aime to her home in Alsace , and for the subsequent marriage . As yet , Roger had never seen his brother 's wife ; indeed , he had only been taken into Osborne 's full confidence after all was decided in which his advice could have been useful . And now , in the enforced separation , Osborne 's whole thought , both the poetical and practical sides of his mind , ran upon the little wife who was passing her lonely days in farmhouse lodgings , wondering when her bridegroom husband would come to her next . With such an engrossing subject , it was , perhaps , no wonder that he unconsciously neglected his father ; but it was none the less sad at the time , and to be regretted in its consequences . "

But the voluntary companionship of his son was very soothing to the Squire , though not a word might be said . The next speech he made showed the direction of his thoughts ; indeed , his words were always a transparent medium through which the current might be seen . "

[ Illustration ( untitled ) ] All this had taken place before Roger 's first meeting with Molly and Cynthia at Miss Brownings ' ; and the little dinner on the Friday at Mr. Gibson 's , which followed in due sequence . Mrs. Gibson intended the Hamleys to find this dinner pleasant ; and they did . Mr. Gibson was fond of the two young men , both for their parents ' sake and their own , for he had known them since boyhood ; and to those whom he liked Mr. Gibson could be remarkably agreeable . Mrs. Gibson really gave them a welcome -- and cordiality in a hostess is a very becoming mantle for any other deficiencies there may be . Cynthia and Molly looked their best , which was all the duty Mrs. Gibson absolutely required of them , as she was willing enough to take her full share in the conversation . Osborne fell to her lot , of course , and for some time he and she prattled on with all the ease of manner and commonplaceness of meaning which go far to make the "

Yet , every now and then while he listened , he caught his attention wandering to the face of Cynthia , who was placed between his brother and Mr. Gibson . She was not particularly occupied with attending to anything that was going on ; her eyelids were carelessly dropped , as she crumbled her bread on the tablecloth , and her beautiful long eyelashes were seen on the clear tint of her oval cheek . She was thinking of something else ; Molly was trying to understand with all her might . Suddenly Cynthia looked up , and caught Roger 's gaze of intent admiration too fully for her to be unaware that he was staring at her . She coloured a little ; but , after the first moment of rosy confusion at his evident admiration of her , she flew to the attack , diverting his confusion at thus being caught , to the defence of himself from her accusation .

134963	135187	134961	134961	COLIN	351	" ] This choice of a song was exceedingly _ mal-propos _ , had Mrs. Gibson but known it . Osborne and Roger knowing that the wife of the former was a Frenchwoman , and , conscious of each other 's knowledge , felt doubly awkward ; while Molly was as much confused as though she herself were secretly married . However , Cynthia carolled the saucy ditty out , and her mother smiled at it , in total ignorance of any application it might have . Osborne had instinctively gone to stand behind Cynthia , as she sate at the piano , so as to be ready to turn over the leaves of her music if she required it . He kept his hands in his pockets and his eyes fixed on her fingers ; his countenance clouded with gravity at all the merry quips which she so playfully sang . Roger looked grave as well , but was much more at his ease than his brother ; indeed , he was half - amused by the awkwardness of the situation . He caught Molly 's troubled eyes and heightened colour , and he saw that she was feeling this _ contretemps _ more seriously than she needed to do . He moved to a seat by her , and half whispered , "
135197	135214	135216	135216	I	0	" Molly looked up at him as he leant towards her , and replied in the same tone--"Oh

135251	135374	135375	135375	They	3458	" Molly could not tell what to reply to this , so she hung her head and kept silence . Yet she could see that Roger did not change his attitude or remove his hand from the back of his chair , and , impelled by curiosity to find out the cause of his stillness , she looked up at him at length , and saw his gaze fixed on the two who were near the piano . Osborne was saying something eagerly to Cynthia , whose grave eyes were upturned to him with soft intentness of expression , and her pretty mouth half - open , with a sort of impatience for him to cease speaking , that she might reply . "
135381	135393	135375	135375	They	3458	" said Roger , in answer to Molly 's unspoken question . "
135427	135553	135423	135423	they	3458	" It was all very well to ask this civilly , but Molly thought it would have been better to wait for her answer . Instead of waiting , however , Roger went to the piano , and , leaning on it , appeared to join in the light merry talk , while he feasted his eyes as much as he dared by looking at Cynthia . Molly suddenly felt as if she could scarcely keep from crying -- a minute ago he had been so near to her , and talking so pleasantly and confidentially ; and now he almost seemed as if he had forgotten her existence . She thought that all this was wrong ; and she exaggerated its wrongness to herself ; "
135556	135558	135423	135423	they	3458	" and "
135563	135565	135423	135423	they	3458	" and "

135575	135799	135423	135423	they	3458	" were the terms she kept applying to herself ; but it did no good , she was just as naughty at the last as at the first . Mrs. Gibson broke into the state of things which Molly thought was to endure for ever . Her work had been intricate up to this time , and had required a great deal of counting ; so she had had no time to attend to her duties , one of which she always took to be to show herself to the world as an impartial stepmother . Cynthia had played and sung , and now she must give Molly her turn of exhibition . Cynthia 's singing and playing was light and graceful , but anything but correct ; but she herself was so charming , that it was only fanatics for music who cared for false chords and omitted notes . Molly , on the contrary , had an excellent ear , if she had ever been well taught ; and both from inclination and conscientious perseverance of disposition , she would go over an incorrect passage for twenty times . But she was very shy of playing in company ; and when forced to do it , she went through her performance heavily , and hated her handiwork more than any one . "
135810	135815	135808	135808	Molly	221	" said Mrs. Gibson ; "
135828	135855	135808	135808	Molly	221	" Molly looked up at her stepmother with beseeching eyes ; but it only brought out another form of request , still more like a command . "
135886	135909	135880	135880	you	3463	" So there was a disturbance made in the little group at the piano , and Molly sate down to her martyrdom . "

135950	136061	135945	135945	you	3463	" Osborne remained where he was in spite of her appeal , and gave her what little approval she got ; for Mrs. Gibson , exhausted by her previous labour of counting her stitches , fell asleep in her comfortable sofa - corner near the fire ; and Roger , who began at first to talk a little in compliance with Molly 's request , found his conversation with Cynthia so agreeable , that Molly lost her place several times in trying to catch a sudden glimpse of Cynthia sitting at her work , and Roger by her , intent on catching her low replies to what he was saying . "
136069	136087	135945	135945	you	3463	" said Molly , standing up quickly as soon as she had finished the eighteen dreary pages ; "
136100	136484	136089	136089	I	0	" Osborne laughed at her vehemence . Cynthia began to take some part in what was being said , and thus made the conversation general . Mrs. Gibson wakened up gracefully , as was her way of doing all things , and slid into the subjects they were talking about so easily , that she almost succeeded in making them believe she had never been asleep at all . CHAPTER XXV . HOLLINGFORD IN A BUSTLE . All Hollingford felt as if there was a great deal to be done before Easter this year . There was Easter proper , which always required new clothing of some kind , for fear of certain consequences from little birds , who were supposed to resent the impiety of those that did not wear some new article of dress on Easter - day . And most ladies considered it wiser that the little birds should see the new article for themselves , and not have to take it upon trust , as they would have to do if it were merely a pocket - handkerchief , or a petticoat , or any article of under - clothing . So piety demanded a new bonnet , or a new gown ; and was barely satisfied with an Easter pair of gloves . Miss Rose was generally very busy just before Easter in Hollingford . Then this year there was the charity ball . Ashcombe , Hollingford , and Coreham were three neighbouring towns , of about the same number of population , lying at the three equidistant corners of a triangle . In imitation of greater cities with their festivals , these three towns had agreed to have an annual ball for the benefit of the county hospital to be held in turn at each place ; and Hollingford was to be the place this year . It was a fine time for hospitality , and every house of any pretension was as full as it could hold , and flys were engaged long months before . If Mrs. Gibson could have asked Osborne , or in default , Roger Hamley to go to the ball with them and to sleep at their house,--or if , indeed , she could have picked up any stray scion of a "
136487	137065	137066	137067	my lord	592	" to whom such an offer would have been a convenience , she would have restored her own dressing - room to its former use as the spare - room , with pleasure . But she did not think it was worth her while to put herself out for any of the humdrum and ill - dressed women who had been her former acquaintances at Ashcombe . For Mr. Preston it might have been worth while to give up her room , considering him in the light of a handsome and prosperous young man , and a good dancer besides . But there were more lights in which he was to be viewed . Mr. Gibson , who really wanted to return the hospitality shown to him by Mr. Preston at the time of his marriage , had yet an instinctive distaste to the man , which no wish of freeing himself from obligation , nor even the more worthy feeling of hospitality , could overcome . Mrs. Gibson had some old grudges of her own against him , but she was not one to retain angry feelings , or be very active in her retaliation ; she was afraid of Mr. Preston , and admired him at the same time . It was awkward too -- so she said -- to go into a ball - room without any gentleman at all , and Mr. Gibson was so uncertain ! On the whole -- partly for this last - given reason , and partly because conciliation was the best policy , Mrs. Gibson was slightly in favour of inviting Mr. Preston to be their guest . But as soon as Cynthia heard the question discussed -- or rather , as soon as she heard it discussed in Mr. Gibson 's absence , she said that if Mr. Preston came to be their visitor on the occasion , she for one would not go to the ball at all . She did not speak with vehemence or in anger ; but with such quiet resolution that Molly looked up in surprise . She saw that Cynthia was keeping her eyes fixed on her work , and that she had no intention of meeting any one 's gaze , or giving any further explanation . Mrs. Gibson , too , looked perplexed , and once or twice seemed on the point of asking some question ; but she was not angry as Molly had fully expected . She watched Cynthia furtively and in silence for a minute or two , and then said that , after all , she could not conveniently give up her dressing - room ; and , altogether , they had better say no more about it . So no stranger was invited to stay at Mr. Gibson 's at the time of the ball ; but Mrs. Gibson openly spoke of her regret at the unavoidable inhospitality , and hoped that they might be able to build an addition to their house before the next triennial Hollingford ball . Another cause of unusual bustle at Hollingford this Easter was the expected return of the family to the Towers , after their unusually long absence . Mr. Sheepshanks might be seen trotting up and down on his stout old cob , speaking to attentive masons , plasterers , and glaziers about putting everything -- on the outside at least -- about the cottages belonging to "
137069	137500	137501	137503	The dear countess	7214	" in perfect repair . Lord Cumnor owned the greater part of the town ; and those who lived under other landlords , or in houses of their own , were stirred up by the dread of contrast to do up their dwellings . So the ladders of whitewashers and painters were sadly in the way of the ladies tripping daintily along to make their purchases , and holding their gowns up in a bunch behind , after a fashion quite gone out in these days . The housekeeper and steward from the Towers might also be seen coming in to give orders at the various shops ; and stopping here and there at those kept by favourites , to avail themselves of the eagerly - tendered refreshments . Lady Harriet came to call on her old governess the day after the arrival of the family at the Towers . Molly and Cynthia were out walking when she came -- doing some errands for Mrs. Gibson , who had a secret idea that Lady Harriet would call at the particular time she did , and had a not uncommon wish to talk to her ladyship without the corrective presence of any member of her own family . Mrs. Gibson did not give Molly the message of remembrance that Lady Harriet had left for her ; but she imparted various pieces of news relating to the Towers with great animation and interest . The Duchess of Menteith and her daughter , Lady Alice , were coming to the Towers ; would be there the day of the ball ; would come to the ball ; and the Menteith diamonds were famous . That was piece of news the first . The second was that ever so many gentlemen were coming to the Towers -- some English , some French . This piece of news would have come first in order of importance had there been much probability of their being dancing men , and , as such , possible partners at the coming ball . But Lady Harriet had spoken of them as Lord Hollingford 's friends , useless scientific men in all probability . Then , finally , Mrs. Gibson was to go to the Towers next day to lunch ; Lady Cumnor had written a little note by Lady Harriet to beg her to come ; if Mrs. Gibson could manage to find her way to the Towers , one of the carriages in use should bring her back to her own home in the course of the afternoon . "
137505	137576	137501	137503	The dear countess	7214	" said Mrs. Gibson , with soft affection . It was a soliloquy , uttered after a minute 's pause , at the end of all this information . And all the rest of that day her conversation had an aristocratic perfume hanging about it . One of the few books she had brought with her into Mr. Gibson 's house was bound in pink , and in it she studied "
137585	137783	137582	137583	Adolphus George	202	" & amp;c . , & amp;c . , till she was fully up in all the duchess 's connections , and probable interests . Mr. Gibson made his mouth up into a droll whistle when he came home at night , and found himself in a Towers ' atmosphere . Molly saw the shade of annoyance through the drollery ; she was beginning to see it oftener than she liked , not that she reasoned upon it , or that she consciously traced the annoyance to its source ; but she could not help feeling uneasy in herself when she knew her father was in the least put out . Of course a fly was ordered for Mrs. Gibson . In the early afternoon she came home . If she had been disappointed in her interview with the countess she never told her woe , nor revealed the fact that when she first arrived at the Towers she had to wait for an hour in Lady Cumnor 's morning - room , uncheered by any companionship save that of her old friend , Mrs. Bradley , till suddenly , Lady Harriet coming in , she exclaimed , "
137802	137922	137799	137799	mamma	7255	" And , after a little more affectionate conversation , she rushed to find her ladyship , who was perfectly aware of the fact , but too deep in giving the duchess the benefit of her wisdom and experience in trousseaux to be at all aware of the length of time Mrs. Gibson had been passing in patient solitude . At lunch Mrs. Gibson was secretly hurt by my lord 's supposing it to be her dinner , and calling out his urgent hospitality from the very bottom of the table , giving as a reason for it , that she must remember it was her dinner . In vain she piped out in her soft , high voice , "
137947	138078	137939	137939	I	0	" Her voice was lost , and the duchess might go away with the idea that the Hollingford doctor 's wife dined early ; that is to say , if her grace ever condescended to have any idea on the subject at all ; which presupposes that she was cognizant of the fact of there being a doctor at Hollingford , and that he had a wife , and that his wife was the pretty , faded , elegant - looking woman sending away her plate of untasted food -- food which she longed to eat , for she was really desperately hungry after her drive and her solitude . And then after lunch there did come a _ tte--tte _ with Lady Cumnor , which was conducted after this wise:-- "
138294	138381	138282	138282	Brown	266	" Off went Mrs. Gibson , rather unwillingly ; for there were several things she wanted to speak about , and she had not heard half of what she had expected to learn of the family gossip . But all chance was gone ; for when she came back from her fruitless errand , Lady Cumnor and the duchess were in full talk , Lady Cumnor with the missing letter in her hand , which she was using something like a baton to enforce her words . "
138394	138440	138441	138441	Clare	172	" Lady Cumnor was too much of a lady not to apologize for useless trouble , but they were nearly the last words she spoke to Mrs. Gibson , for she had to go out and drive with the duchess ; and the brougham to take "
138442	138493	138494	138494	We	3482	" ( as she persisted in calling Mrs. Gibson ) back to Hollingford followed the carriage to the door . Lady Harriet came away from her _ entourage _ of young men and young ladies , all prepared for some walking expedition , to wish Mrs. Gibson good - by . "
138502	138506	138494	138494	We	3482	" she said . "
138554	138582	138551	138551	you	3483	" Such were the facts , but rose - colour was the medium through which they were seen by Mrs. Gibson 's household listeners on her return . "
138824	138861	138821	138822	Lady Harriet	179	" This last was said in a tone of meditative appreciation . The afternoon of the day on which the ball was to take place , a servant rode over from Hamley with two lovely nosegays , "

Mrs. Gibson was more anxious about her attire than was either of the girls ; it had given her occasion for deep thought and not a few sighs . Her deliberation had ended in her wearing her pearl - grey satin wedding - gown , with a profusion of lace , and white and coloured lilacs . Cynthia was the one who took the affair most lightly . Molly looked upon the ceremony of dressing for a first ball as rather a serious ceremony ; certainly as an anxious proceeding . Cynthia was almost as anxious as herself ; only Molly wanted her appearance to be correct and unnoticed ; and Cynthia was desirous of setting off Molly 's rather peculiar charms -- her cream - coloured skin , her profusion of curly black hair , her beautiful long - shaped eyes , with their shy , loving expression . Cynthia took up so much time in dressing Molly to her mind , that she herself had to perform her toilette in a hurry . Molly , ready dressed , sate on a low chair in Cynthia 's room , watching the pretty creature 's rapid movements , as she stood in her petticoat before the glass , doing up her hair , with quick certainty of effect . At length , Molly heaved a long sigh , and said,-- "

Maria had been officiating as maid to Mrs. Gibson , but she had had intervals of leisure , in which she had rushed upstairs , and , under the pretence of offering her services , had seen the young ladies ' dresses , and the sight of so many nice clothes had sent her into a state of excitement which made her think nothing of rushing upstairs for the twentieth time , with a nosegay still more beautiful than the two previous ones .

Yes ; Mr. Gibson was going,--even if he had to leave them afterwards to attend to any professional call . And Molly suddenly began to admire her father as a handsome man , when she saw him now , in full evening attire . Mrs. Gibson , too -- how pretty she was ! In short , it was true that no better - looking a party than these four people entered the Hollingford ball - room that evening . CHAPTER XXVI . A CHARITY BALL . At the present time there are few people at a public ball besides the dancers and their chaperones , or relations in some degree interested in them . But in the days when Molly and Cynthia were young -- before railroads were , and before their consequences , the excursion - trains , which take every one up to London now - a - days , there to see their fill of gay crowds and fine dresses -- to go to an annual charity - ball , even though all thought of dancing had passed by years ago , and without any of the responsibilities of a chaperone , was a very allowable and favourite piece of dissipation to all the kindly old maids who thronged the country towns of England . They aired their old lace and their best dresses ; they saw the aristocratic magnates of the country side ; they gossipped with their coevals , and speculated on the romances of the young around them in a curious yet friendly spirit . The Miss Brownings would have thought themselves sadly defrauded of the gayest event of the year , if anything had prevented their attending the charity ball , and Miss Browning would have been indignant , Miss Phoebe aggrieved , had they not been asked to Ashcombe and Coreham , by friends at each place , who had , like them , gone through the dancing - stage of life some five - and - twenty years before , but who liked still to haunt the scenes of their former enjoyment , and see a younger generation dance on "

She went first , and remained in the warm cloak - room until her hostess followed ; and then the two ladies went arm - in - arm into the ball - room , finding out convenient seats whence they could watch the arrivals and speak to their passing friends , until Miss Phoebe and Miss Piper entered , and came to take possession of the seats reserved for them by Miss Browning 's care . These two younger ladies came in , also arm - in - arm , but with a certain timid flurry in look and movement very different from the composed dignity of their seniors ( by two or three years ) . When all four were once more assembled together , they took breath , and began to converse . "

Almost before Miss Browning had ended her severe and depreciatory remarks , he had asked his friend Miss Hornblower,-- "

Nor did Miss Browning dissipate the illusion . Lady Harriet had drunk tea with them , and might do it again ; and , at any rate , the little fright she had put her friend into was not a bad return for that praise of Mr. Roscoe , which had offended Miss Browning 's loyalty to Mr. Gibson . Meanwhile Miss Piper and Miss Phoebe , who had not the character of _ esprit - forts _ to maintain , talked of the dresses of the people present , beginning by complimenting each other . "

Mrs. Gibson was secretly a little annoyed at Cynthia 's being one of those to stand up in this early dance , the performers in which were principally the punctual plebeians of Hollingford , who , when a ball was fixed to begin at eight , had no notion of being later , and so losing part of the amusement for which they had paid their money . She imparted some of her feelings to Molly , sitting by her , longing to dance , and beating time to the spirited music with one of her pretty little feet . "

Every great house in the district was expected to be full of guests on these occasions ; but at this early hour , the townspeople had the floor almost entirely to themselves ; the county magnates came dropping in later ; and chiefest among them all was the lord - lieutenant from the Towers . But to - night they were unusually late , and the aristocratic ozone being absent from the atmosphere , there was a flatness about the dancing of all those who considered themselves above the plebeian ranks of the tradespeople . They , however , enjoyed themselves thoroughly , and sprang and bounded till their eyes sparkled and their cheeks glowed with exercise and excitement . Some of the more prudent parents , mindful of the next day 's duties , began to consider at what hour they ought to go home ; but with all there was an expressed or unexpressed curiosity to see the duchess and her diamonds ; for the Menteith diamonds were famous in higher circles than that now assembled ; and their fame had trickled down to it through the medium of ladies'-maids and housekeepers . Mr. Gibson had had to leave the ball - room for a time , as he had anticipated , but he was to return to his wife as soon as his duties were accomplished ; and , in his absence , Mrs. Gibson kept herself a little aloof from the Miss Brownings and those of her acquaintance who would willingly have entered into conversation with her , with the view of attaching herself to the skirts of the Towers ' party , when they should make their appearance . If Cynthia would not be so very ready in engaging herself to every possible partner who asked her to dance , there were sure to be young men staying at the Towers who would be on the look - out for pretty girls : and who could tell to what a dance might lead ? Molly , too , though not so good a dancer as Cynthia , and , from her timidity , less graceful and easy , was becoming engaged pretty deeply ; and , it must be confessed , she was longing to dance every dance , no matter with whom . Even she might not be available for the more aristocratic partners Mrs. Gibson anticipated . She was feeling very much annoyed with the whole proceedings of the evening when she was aware of some one standing by her ; and , turning a little to one side , she saw Mr. Preston keeping guard , as it were , over the seats which Molly and Cynthia had just quitted . He was looking so black that , if their eyes had not met , Mrs. Gibson would have preferred not speaking to him ; as it was , she thought it unavoidable . "

143572	143576	143565	143566	Mr. Preston	260	" said he ; "

143680	143812	143813	143813	You	3601	" Mr. Preston made no reply . He had put his glass in his eye , apparently for the purpose of watching the dancers . If its exact direction could have been ascertained , it would have been found that he was looking intently and angrily at a flying figure in pink muslin : many a one was gazing at Cynthia with intentness besides himself , but no one in anger . Mrs. Gibson was not so fine an observer as to read all this ; but here was a gentlemanly and handsome young man , to whom she could prattle , instead of either joining herself on to objectionable people , or sitting all forlorn until the Towers ' party came . So she went on with her small remarks . "
143821	143822	143818	143819	Mr. Preston	260	" "
143845	143958	143835	143835	I	0	" Mrs. Gibson was silent . An uncomfortable tide of recollections appeared to come over her ; she , like Mr. Preston , watched Cynthia ; the dance was ended , and she was walking round the room in easy unconcern as to what might await her . Presently her partner , Mr. Harry Cholmley , brought her back to her seat . She took that vacant next to Mr. Preston , leaving the one by her mother for Molly 's occupation . The latter returned a moment afterwards to her place . Cynthia seemed entirely unconscious of Mr. Preston 's neighbourhood . Mrs. Gibson leaned forwards , and said to her daughter,-- "

144036	144052	144053	144053	He	3604	" said Molly , eagerly , but with a spice of malice in her mind . "

144166	144244	144159	144159	papa	7226	" said Molly , in a pleading tone of voice ; for she could not quite thoroughly enjoy herself if she was out of harmony with any one . What reply Mrs. Gibson would have made to this speech can not now be ascertained ; for , before she could answer , Mr. Preston stepped a little forwards , and said , in a tone which he meant to be icily indifferent , but which trembled with anger,-- "
144267	144298	144262	144263	Miss Kirkpatrick	265	" Cynthia lifted up her beautiful eyes , and , fixing them on Mr. Preston 's face , said , very quietly , as if only stating a matter of fact,-- "
144341	144557	144329	144329	I	0	" And to the rest of this little conversation , Cynthia appeared to lend no ear ; and she was almost directly claimed by her next partner . Mr. Preston took the seat now left empty much to Molly 's annoyance . At first she feared lest he might be going to ask her to dance ; but , instead , he put out his hand for Cynthia 's nosegay , which she had left on rising , entrusted to Molly . It had suffered considerably from the heat of the room , and was no longer full and fresh ; not so much so as Molly 's , which had not , in the first instance , been pulled to pieces in picking out the scarlet flowers which now adorned Molly 's hair , and which had since been cherished with more care . Enough , however , remained of Cynthia 's to show very distinctly that it was not the one Mr. Preston had sent ; and it was perhaps to convince himself of this , that he rudely asked to examine it . But Molly , faithful to what she imagined would be Cynthia 's wish , refused to allow him to touch it ; she only held it a little nearer . "

144592	144607	144577	144577	She	265	" said Molly , rather intimidated by the tone in which this was said . "
144617	144659	144577	144577	She	265	" Mrs. Gibson was just the person to come to the rescue with her honeyed words on such an occasion as the present . She evidently was rather afraid of Mr. Preston , and wished to keep at peace with him . "

144818	145062	144816	144816	she	265	" said Mr. Preston , with a certain accent of pleasure in his voice , as though he were glad she set so little store by the nosegay ; and he walked off to stand behind Cynthia in the quadrille that was being danced ; and Molly saw him making her reply to him -- against her will , Molly was sure . But , somehow , his face and manner implied power over her . She looked grave , deaf , indifferent , indignant , defiant ; but , after a half - whispered speech to Cynthia , at the conclusion of the dance , she evidently threw him an impatient consent to what he was asking , for he walked off with a disagreeable smile of satisfaction on his handsome face . All this time the murmurs were spreading at the lateness of the party from the Towers , and person after person came up to Mrs. Gibson as if she were the accredited authority as to the earl and countess 's plans . In one sense this was flattering ; but then the acknowledgment of common ignorance and wonder reduced her to the level of the inquirers . Mrs. Goodenough felt herself particularly aggrieved ; she had had her spectacles on for the last hour and a half , in order to be ready for the sight the very first minute any one from the Towers appeared at the door . "
145068	145072	145063	145063	I	0	" she complained , "

145350	145356	145333	145334	the duchess	9940	" sighed out Mrs. Gibson ; "
145433	145824	145411	145412	Lady Harriet	179	" Every one of any pretensions to gentility was painfully affected by the absence of the family from the Towers ; the very fiddlers seemed unwilling to begin playing a dance that might be interrupted by the entrance of the great folks . Miss Phoebe Browning had apologized for them -- Miss Browning had blamed them with calm dignity ; it was only the butchers and bakers and candlestick - makers who rather enjoyed the absence of restraint , and were happy and hilarious . At last , there was a rumbling , and a rushing , and a whispering , and the music stopped ; so the dancers were obliged to do so too ; and in came Lord Cumnor in his state dress , with a fat , middle - aged woman on his arm ; she was dressed almost like a girl -- in a sprigged muslin , with natural flowers in her hair , but not a vestige of a jewel or a diamond . Yet it must be the duchess ; but what was a duchess without diamonds?--and in a dress which farmer Hudson 's daughter might have worn ! Was it the duchess ? Could it be the duchess ? The little crowd of inquirers around Mrs. Gibson thickened , to hear her confirm their disappointing surmise . After the duchess came Lady Cumnor , looking like Lady Macbeth in black velvet -- a cloud upon her brow , made more conspicuous by the lines of age rapidly gathering on her handsome face ; and Lady Harriet , and other ladies , amongst whom there was one dressed so like the duchess as to suggest the idea of a sister rather than a daughter , as far as dress went . There was Lord Hollingford , plain in face , awkward in person , gentlemanly in manner ; and half - a - dozen younger men , Lord Albert Monson , Captain James , and others of their age and standing , who came in looking anything if not critical . This long - expected party swept up to the seats reserved for them at the head of the room , apparently regardless of the interruption they caused ; for the dancers stood aside , and almost dispersed back to their seats , and when "
145828	145891	145411	145412	Lady Harriet	179	" struck up again , not half the former set of people stood up to finish the dance . Lady Harriet , who was rather different to Miss Piper , and no more minded crossing the room alone than if the lookers - on were so many cabbages , spied the Gibson party pretty quickly out , and came across to them .

146126	146222	146111	146112	Miss Gibson	187	" It was a simple question enough ; but Lady Harriet 's speaking at all to Molly had become to Mrs. Gibson almost like shaking a red rag at a bull ; it was the one thing sure to put her out of temper . But she would not have shown this to Lady Harriet for the world ; only she contrived to baffle any endeavours at further conversation between the two , by placing herself betwixt Lady Harriet and Molly , whom the former asked to sit down in the absent Cynthia 's room . "
146260	146277	146280	146281	anybody else	8918	" So she sat down by Mrs. Gibson , and as Mrs. Goodenough afterwards expressed it , "
146283	146436	146280	146281	anybody else	8918	" Mrs. Goodenough said this to excuse herself for a little misadventure she fell into . She had taken a deliberate survey of the grandees at the upper end of the room , spectacles on nose , and had inquired , in no very measured voice , who everybody was , from Mr. Sheepshanks , my lord 's agent , and her very good neighbour , who in vain tried to check her loud ardour for information by replying to her in whispers . But she was rather deaf as well as blind , so his low tones only brought upon him fresh inquiries . Now , satisfied as far as she could be , and on her way to departure , and the extinguishing of fire and candle - light , she stopped opposite to Mrs. Gibson , and thus addressed her by way of renewal of their former subject of conversation:-- "

She was dancing , it was true , with the same lightness and grace as before , but the smooth bounding motion , as of a feather blown onwards by the wind , was gone .

But what was her surprise , after the speeches that had passed before , and the implication of Cynthia 's whole manner to Mr. Preston , to see him come up to her , and , without a word , offer his arm and lead her away to dance . It appeared to strike Mrs. Gibson as something remarkable ; for , forgetting her late passage at arms with Molly , she asked , wonderingly , as if almost distrusting the evidence of her senses,-- "

Once she caught a glimpse of her standing still -- downcast -- listening to Mr. Preston 's eager speech . Again she was walking languidly among the dancers , almost as if she took no notice of those around her . When she and Molly joined each other again , the shade on Cynthia 's face had deepened to gloom . But , at the same time , if a physiognomist had studied her expression , he would have read in it defiance and anger , and perhaps also a little perplexity .

Lady Harriet flew off to Mr. Sheepshanks to secure her respectable young farmer , and Mrs. Gibson remained alone , wishing that Lady Cumnor would send one of her attendant gentlemen for her . It would be so much more agreeable to be sitting even at the fag - end of nobility than here on a bench with everybody ; hoping that everybody would see Molly dancing away with a lord , yet vexed that the chance had so befallen that Molly instead of Cynthia was the young lady singled out ; wondering if simplicity of dress was now become the highest fashion , and pondering on the possibility of cleverly inducing Lady Harriet to introduce Lord Albert Monson to her own beautiful daughter , Cynthia . Molly found Lord Hollingford , the wise and learned Lord Hollingford , strangely stupid in understanding the mystery of "
148603	148989	148396	148397	Lord Hollingford	194	" He was constantly getting hold of the wrong hands , and as constantly stopping when he had returned to his place , quite unaware that the duties of society and the laws of the dance required that he should go on capering till he had arrived at the bottom of the room . He perceived that he had performed his part very badly , and apologized to Molly when once they had arrived at that haven of comparative peace ; and he expressed his regret so simply and heartily that she felt at her ease with him at once , especially when he confided to her his reluctance at having to dance at all , and his only doing it under his sister 's compulsion . To Molly he was an elderly widower , almost as old as her father , and by - and - by they got into very pleasant conversation . She learnt from him that Roger Hamley had just been publishing a paper in some scientific periodical , which had excited considerable attention , as it was intended to confute some theory of a great French physiologist , and Roger 's article proved the writer to be possessed of a most unusual amount of knowledge on the subject . This piece of news was of great interest to Molly ; and , in her questions , she herself evinced so much intelligence , and a mind so well prepared for the reception of information , that Lord Hollingford at any rate would have felt his quest of popularity a very easy affair indeed , if he might have gone on talking quietly to Molly during the rest of the evening . When he took her back to her place , he found Mr. Gibson there , and fell into talk with him , until Lady Harriet once more came to stir him up to his duties . Before very long , however , he returned to Mr. Gibson 's side , and began telling him of this paper of Roger Hamley 's , of which Mr. Gibson had not yet heard . In the midst of their conversation , as they stood close by Mrs. Gibson , Lord Hollingford saw Molly in the distance , and interrupted himself to say , "
149044	149413	149414	149414	Cynthia	265	" Mr. Gibson bowed , much pleased at such a compliment from such a man , were he lord or not . It is very likely that if Molly had been a stupid listener , Lord Hollingford would not have discovered her beauty ; or the converse might be asserted -- if she had not been young and pretty , he would not have exerted himself to talk on scientific subjects in a manner which she could understand . But in whatever way Molly had won his approbation and admiration , there was no doubt that she had earned it somehow . And , when she next returned to her place , Mrs. Gibson greeted her with soft words and a gracious smile ; for it does not require much reasoning power to discover , that if it is a very fine thing to be mother - in - law to a very magnificent three - tailed bashaw , it presupposes that the wife who makes the connection between the two parties is in harmony with her mother . And so far had Mrs. Gibson 's thoughts wandered into futurity . She only wished that the happy chance had fallen to Cynthia 's instead of to Molly 's lot . But Molly was a docile , sweet creature , very pretty , and remarkably intelligent , as my lord had said . It was a pity that Cynthia preferred making millinery to reading ; but perhaps that could be rectified . And there was Lord Cumnor coming to speak to her , and Lady Cumnor nodding to her , and indicating a place by her side . It was not an unsatisfactory ball upon the whole to Mrs. Gibson , although she paid the usual penalty for sitting up beyond her ordinary hour in perpetual glare and movement . The next morning she awoke irritable and fatigued ; and a little of the same feeling oppressed both Cynthia and Molly . The former was lounging in the window - seat , holding a three - days'-old newspaper in her hand , which she was making a pretence of reading , when she was startled by her mother 's saying,-- "

149599	149820	149535	149535	Cynthia	265	" was just as much a mere excuse for Cynthia 's thinking her own thoughts as the newspaper had been . CHAPTER XXVII . FATHER AND SONS . [ Illustration ( untitled ) ] Things were not going on any better at Hamley Hall . Nothing had occurred to change the state of dissatisfied feeling into which the Squire and his eldest son had respectively fallen ; and the long continuance merely of dissatisfaction is sure of itself to deepen the feeling . Roger did all in his power to bring the father and son together ; but sometimes wondered if it would not have been better to leave them alone ; for they were falling into the habit of each making him their confidant , and so defining emotions and opinions which would have had less distinctness if they had been unexpressed . There was little enough relief in the daily life at the Hall to help them all to shake off the gloom ; and it even told on the health of both the Squire and Osborne . The Squire became thinner , his skin as well as his clothes began to hang loose about him , and the freshness of his colour turned to red streaks , till his cheeks looked like Eardiston pippins , instead of resembling "
149833	149996	149535	149535	Cynthia	265	" Roger thought that his father sate indoors and smoked in his study more than was good for him , but it had become difficult to get him far afield ; he was too much afraid of coming across some sign of the discontinued drainage works , or being irritated afresh by the sight of his depreciated timber . Osborne was wrapt up in the idea of arranging his poems for the press , and so working out his wish for independence . What with daily writing to his wife -- taking his letters himself to a distant post - office , and receiving hers there -- touching up his sonnets , & amp;c . , with fastidious care -- and occasionally giving himself the pleasure of a visit to the Gibsons , and enjoying the society of the two pleasant girls there , he found little time for being with his father . Indeed , Osborne was too self - indulgent or "
149999	150048	149535	149535	Cynthia	265	" as he termed it , to bear well with the Squire 's gloomy fits , or too frequent querulousness . The consciousness of his secret , too , made Osborne uncomfortable in his father 's presence . It was very well for all parties that Roger was not "
150051	150178	149535	149535	Cynthia	265	" for , if he had been , there were times when it would have been hard to bear little spurts of domestic tyranny , by which his father strove to assert his power over both his sons . One of these occurred very soon after the night of the Hollingford charity - ball . Roger had induced his father to come out with him ; and the Squire had , on his son 's suggestion , taken with him his long unused spud . The two had wandered far afield ; perhaps the elder man had found the unwonted length of exercise too much for him ; for , as he approached the house , on his return , he became what nurses call in children "

Roger understood the case by instinct , as it were , and bore it all with his usual sweetness of temper . They entered the house by the front door ; it lay straight on their line of march . On the old cracked yellow - marble slab , there lay a card with Lord Hollingford 's name on it , which Robinson , evidently on the watch for their return , hastened out of his pantry to deliver to Roger .

Osborne sate at a table near the fire , pen in hand , looking over one of his poems , and dotting the _ i _ 's , crossing the _ t _ 's , and now and then pausing over the alteration of a word . "

Geoffroi St. H---- was in England now , and was expected to pay a visit at the Towers in the course of the following week . He had expressed a wish to meet the author of the paper which had already attracted the attention of the French comparative anatomists ; and Lord Hollingford added a few words as to his own desire to make the acquaintance of a neighbour whose tastes were so similar to his own ; and then followed a civil message from Lord and Lady Cumnor . Lord Hollingford 's hand was cramped and rather illegible . The squire could not read it all at once , and was enough put out to decline any assistance in deciphering it . At last he made it out . "

151964	153073	151962	151962	yourself	3767	" continued he , pointing out a line or two in a letter he drew from his pocket . Roger suspected that one or two of the words were wrongly spelt ; but their purport was so gentle and loving , and had such a touch of simple , respectful gratitude in them , that he could not help being drawn afresh to the little unseen sister - in - law , whose acquaintance Osborne had made by helping her to look for some missing article of the children 's , whom she was taking for their daily walk in Hyde Park . For Mrs. Osborne Hamley had been nothing more than a French _ bonne _ , very pretty , very graceful , and very much tyrannized over by the rough little boys and girls she had in charge . She was a little orphan girl , who had charmed the heads of a travelling English family , as she had brought madame some articles of lingerie at an hotel ; and she had been hastily engaged by them as _ bonne _ to their children , partly as a pet and plaything herself , partly because it would be so good for the children to learn French from a native ( of Alsace ! ) . By - and - by her mistress ceased to take any particular notice of Aime in the bustle of London and London gaiety ; but though feeling more and more forlorn in a strange land every day , the French girl strove hard to do her duty . One touch of kindness , however , was enough to set the fountain gushing ; and she and Osborne naturally fell into an ideal state of love , to be rudely disturbed by the indignation of the mother , when accident discovered to her the attachment existing between her children 's _ bonne _ and a young man of an entirely different class . Aime answered truly to all her mistress 's questions ; but no worldly wisdom , nor any lesson to be learnt from another 's experience , could in the least disturb her entire faith in her lover . Perhaps Mrs. Townshend did no more than her duty in immediately sending Aime back to Metz , where she had first met with her , and where such relations as remained to the girl might be supposed to be residing . But , altogether , she knew so little of the kind of people or life to which she was consigning her deposed protge that Osborne , after listening with impatient indignation to the lecture which Mrs. Townshend gave him when he insisted on seeing her in order to learn what had become of his love , that the young man set off straight for Metz in hot haste , and did not let the grass grow under his feet until he had made Aime his wife . All this had occurred the previous autumn , and Roger did not know of the step his brother had taken until it was irrevocable . Then came the mother 's death , which , besides the simplicity of its own overwhelming sorrow , brought with it the loss of the kind , tender mediatrix , who could always soften and turn his father 's heart . It is doubtful , however , if even she could have succeeded in this , for the Squire looked high , and over high , for the wife of his heir ; he detested all foreigners , and overmore held all Roman Catholics in dread and abomination something akin to our ancestors ' hatred of witchcraft . All these prejudices were strengthened by his grief . Argument would always have glanced harmless away off his shield of utter unreason ; but a loving impulse , in a happy moment , might have softened his heart to what he most detested in the former days . But the happy moments came not now , and the loving impulses were trodden down by the bitterness of his frequent remorse , not less than by his growing irritability ; so Aime lived solitary in the little cottage near Winchester in which Osborne had installed her when she first came to England as his wife , and in the dainty furnishing of which he had run himself so deeply into debt . For Osborne consulted his own fastidious taste in his purchases rather than her simple childlike wishes and wants , and looked upon the little Frenchwoman rather as the future mistress of Hamley Hall than as the wife of a man who was wholly dependent on others at present . He had chosen a southern county as being far removed from those midland shires where the name of Hamley of Hamley was well and widely known ; for he did not wish his wife to assume , if only for a time , a name which was not justly and legally her own . In all these arrangements he had willingly striven to do his full duty by her ; and she repaid him with passionate devotion and admiring reverence . If his vanity had met with a check , or his worthy desires for college honours had been disappointed , he knew where to go for a comforter ; one who poured out praise till her words were choked in her throat by the rapidity of her thoughts , and who poured out the small vials of her indignation on every one who did not acknowledge and bow down to her husband 's merits . If she ever wished to go to the chteau -- that was his home -- and to be introduced to his family , Aime never hinted a word of it to him . Only she did yearn , and she did plead , for a little more of her husband 's company ; and the good reasons which had convinced her of the necessity of his being so much away when he was present to urge them , failed in their efficacy when she tried to reproduce them to herself in his absence . The afternoon of the day on which Lord Hollingford called Roger was going upstairs , three steps at a time , when , at a turn on the landing , he encountered his father . It was the first time he had seen him since their conversation about the Towers ' invitation to dinner . The Squire stopped his son by standing right in the middle of the passage . "

154893	155797	155803	155803	her	3827	" Osborne bowed . It was very pleasant to him to be petted and flattered , even though he knew all the time that it was only flattery . It was an agreeable contrast to the home that was so dismal to him , to come to this house , where the society of two agreeable girls , and the soothing syrup of their mother 's speeches , awaited him whenever he liked to come . To say nothing of the difference that struck upon his senses , poetical though he might esteem himself , of a sitting - room full of flowers , and tokens of women 's presence , where all the chairs were easy , and all the tables well covered with pretty things , to the great drawing - room at home , where the draperies were threadbare , and the seats uncomfortable , and no sign of feminine presence ever now lent a grace to the stiff arrangement of the furniture . Then the meals , light and well - cooked , suited his taste and delicate appetite so much better than the rich and heavy viands prepared by the servants at the Hall . Osborne was becoming a little afraid of falling into the habit of paying too frequent visits to the Gibsons ( and that , not because he feared the consequences of his intercourse with the two young ladies ; for he never thought of them excepting as friends;--the fact of his marriage was constantly present to his mind , and Aime too securely enthroned in his heart , for him to remember that he might be looked upon by others in the light of a possible husband ) ; but the reflection forced itself upon him occasionally , whether he was not trespassing too often on hospitality which he had at present no means of returning . But Mrs. Gibson , in her ignorance of the true state of affairs , was secretly exultant in the attraction which made him come so often and lounge away the hours in her house and garden . She had no doubt that it was Cynthia who drew him thither ; and if the latter had been a little more amenable to reason , her mother would have made more frequent allusions than she did to the crisis which she thought was approaching . But she was restrained by the intuitive conviction that if her daughter became conscious of what was impending , and was made aware of Mrs. Gibson 's cautious and quiet efforts to forward the catastrophe , the wilful girl would oppose herself to it with all her skill and power . As it was , Mrs. Gibson trusted that Cynthia 's affections would become engaged before she knew where she was , and that in that case she would not attempt to frustrate her mother 's delicate scheming , even though she did perceive it . But Cynthia had come across too many varieties of flirtation , admiration , and even passionate love , to be for a moment at fault as to the quiet friendly nature of Osborne 's attentions . She received him always as a sister might a brother . It was different when Roger returned from his election as Fellow of Trinity . The trembling diffidence , the hardly suppressed ardour of his manner , made Cynthia understand before long with what kind of love she had now to deal . She did not put it into so many words -- no , not even in her secret heart -- but she recognized the difference between Roger 's relation to her and Osborne 's long before Mrs. Gibson found it out . Molly was , however , the first to discover the nature of Roger 's attention . The first time they saw him after the ball , it came out to her observant eyes . Cynthia had not been looking well since that evening ; she went slowly about the house , pale and heavy - eyed ; and , fond as she usually was of exercise and the free fresh air , there was hardly any persuading her now to go out for a walk . Molly watched this fading with tender anxiety , but to all her questions as to whether she had felt over - fatigued with her dancing , whether anything had occurred to annoy her , and all such inquiries , she replied in languid negatives . Once Molly touched on Mr. Preston 's name , and found that this was a subject on which Cynthia was raw ; now , Cynthia 's face lighted up with spirit , and her whole body showed her ill - repressed agitation , but she only said a few sharp words , expressive of anything but kindly feeling towards the gentleman , and then bade Molly never name his name to her again . Still , the latter could not imagine that he was more than intensely distasteful to her friend , as well as to herself ; he could not be the cause of Cynthia 's present indisposition . But this indisposition lasted so many days without change or modification , that even Mrs. Gibson noticed it , and Molly became positively uneasy . Mrs. Gibson considered Cynthia 's quietness and languor as the natural consequence of "
155804	155815	155800	155807	everybody who asked her " at the ball	10331	" at the ball . Partners whose names were in the "
155818	155973	156008	156008	doctors	3828	" would not have produced half the amount of fatigue , according to Mrs. Gibson 's judgment apparently , and if Cynthia had been quite well , very probably she would have hit the blot in her mother 's speech with one of her touches of sarcasm . Then , again , when Cynthia did not rally , Mrs. Gibson grew impatient , and accused her of being fanciful and lazy ; at length , and partly at Molly 's instance , there came an appeal to Mr. Gibson , and a professional examination of the supposed invalid , which Cynthia hated more than anything , especially when the verdict was , that there was nothing very much the matter , only a general lowness of tone , and depression of health and spirits , which would soon be remedied by tonics , and meanwhile , she was not to be roused to exertion . "
155982	156003	156008	156008	doctors	3828	" said Cynthia to Mr. Gibson , after he had pronounced tonics to be the cure for her present state , "
156025	156057	156008	156008	doctors	3828	" She laughed up in his face as she spoke ; she had always a pretty word and smile for him , even in the midst of her loss of spirits . "

156247	156388	156389	156389	Molly	221	" She ended her sentence with another smile , but it was rather faint and watery . Now the first person out of the house to notice Cynthia 's change of look and manner was Roger Hamley -- and yet he did not see her until , under the influence of the nauseous mixture , she was beginning to recover . But his eyes were scarcely off her during the first five minutes he was in the room . All the time he was trying to talk to Mrs. Gibson in reply to her civil platitudes , he was studying Cynthia ; and at the first convenient pause he came and stood before Molly , so as to interpose his person between her and the rest of the room ; for some visitors had come in subsequent to his entrance . "
156432	156520	156403	156403	she	2413	" Now Molly 's love for Cynthia was fast and unwavering , but if anything tried it , it was the habit Roger had fallen into of always calling Cynthia Molly 's sister in speaking to the latter . From any one else it would have been a matter of indifference to her , and hardly to be noticed ; it vexed both ear and heart when Roger used the expression ; and there was a curtness of manner as well as of words in her reply .

But he was too inherently good himself to put any harsh construction on her speech . Just before he went away , while he was ostensibly holding her hand and wishing her good - by , he said to her in a voice too low to be generally heard,-- "
156916	156935	156938	156938	she	2413	" Then , receiving no affirmative look or word from Molly in reply to this suggestion , he went on,--"Or

156971	157049	156966	156966	she	2413	" said Molly . For some reason or other , unknown to the Gibsons , a longer interval than usual occurred between Osborne 's visits , while Roger came almost every day , always with some fresh offering by which he openly sought to relieve Cynthia 's indisposition as far as it lay in his power . Her manner to him was so gentle and gracious that Mrs. Gibson became alarmed , lest , in spite of his "
157051	157239	157240	157241	Mr. Gibson	158	" ( as she was pleased to term it ) , he might come to be preferred to Osborne , who was so strangely neglecting his own interests , in Mrs. Gibson 's opinion . In her quiet way , she contrived to pass many slights upon Roger ; but the darts rebounded from his generous nature that could not have imagined her motives , and fastened themselves on Molly . She had often been called naughty and passionate when she was a child ; and she thought now that she began to understand that she really had a violent temper . What seemed neither to hurt Roger nor annoy Cynthia made Molly 's blood boil ; and now she had once discovered Mrs. Gibson 's wish to make Roger 's visits shorter and less frequent , she was always on the watch for indications of this desire . She read her stepmother 's heart when the latter made allusions to the Squire 's loneliness , now that Osborne was absent from the Hall , and that Roger was so often away amongst his friends during the day,-- "
157300	157589	157288	157288	we	3845	" Or , as soon as Roger came with his bunch of early roses , it was desirable for Cynthia to go and rest in her own room , while Molly had to accompany Mrs. Gibson on some improvised errand or call . Still Roger , whose object was to give pleasure to Cynthia , and who had , from his boyhood , been always certain of Mr. Gibson 's friendly regard , was slow to perceive that he was not wanted . If he did not see Cynthia , that was his loss ; at any rate , he heard how she was , and left her some little thing which he believed she would like , and was willing to risk the chance of his own gratification by calling four or five times in the hope of seeing her once . At last there came a day when Mrs. Gibson went beyond her usual negative snubbiness , and when , in some unwonted fit of crossness , for she was a very placid - tempered person in general , she was guilty of positive rudeness . Cynthia was very much better . Tonics had ministered to a mind diseased , though she hated to acknowledge it ; her pretty bloom and much of her light - heartedness had come back , and there was no cause remaining for anxiety . Mrs. Gibson was sitting at her embroidery in the drawing - room , and the two girls were at the window , Cynthia laughing at Molly 's earnest endeavours to imitate the French accent in which the former had been reading a page of Voltaire . For the duty , or the farce , of settling to "

That Alnaschar vision had fallen to the ground . It was as yet early morning ; a delicious , fresh , lovely June day , the air redolent with the scents of flower - growth and bloom ; and half the time the girls had been ostensibly employed in the French reading they had been leaning out of the open window trying to reach a cluster of climbing roses . They had secured them at last , and the buds lay on Cynthia 's lap , but many of the petals had fallen off ; so , though the perfume lingered about the window - seat , the full beauty of the flowers had passed away . Mrs. Gibson had once or twice reproved them for the merry noise they were making , which hindered her in the business of counting the stitches in her pattern ; and she had set herself a certain quantity to do that morning before going out , and was of that nature which attaches infinite importance to fulfilling small resolutions , made about indifferent trifles without any reason whatever .

She put out her cold , motionless hand to him , with a half - murmured word of welcome , still eyeing her lost embroidery . He took no apparent notice , and passed on to the window . "

Mrs. Gibson , however , had been bold enough to strike the first blow , and she determined to go on as opportunity offered . Molly would perhaps have been more pained if she had not seen Cynthia 's colour rise . She waited for her to speak , if need were ; for she knew that Roger 's defence , if defence were required , might be safely entrusted to Cynthia 's ready wit .

His ruddy colour grew paler for a moment , and he looked grave and not pleased . In another moment the wonted frankness of expression returned . Why should not he , he asked himself , believe her ?

159664	160428	160429	160429	You	3892	" as Mrs. Gibson called any signs of warm feeling , she laid down her book hastily , and ran upstairs to her room , and locked the door in order to breathe freely . There were traces of tears upon her face when she returned into the drawing - room half - an - hour afterwards , walking straight and demurely up to her former place , where Cynthia still sate and gazed idly out of the window , pouting and displeased ; Mrs. Gibson , meanwhile , counting her stitches aloud with great distinctness and vigour . CHAPTER XXIX . BUSH - FIGHTING . During all the months that had elapsed since Mrs. Hamley 's death , Molly had wondered many a time about the secret she had so unwittingly become possessed of that last day in the Hall library . It seemed so utterly strange and unheard - of a thing to her inexperienced mind , that a man should be married , and yet not live with his wife -- that a son should have entered into the holy state of matrimony without his father 's knowledge , and without being recognized as the husband of some one known or unknown by all those with whom he came in daily contact , that she felt occasionally as if that little ten minutes of revelation must have been a vision in a dream . Roger had only slightly referred to it once , and Osborne had kept entire silence on the subject ever since . Not even a look , or a pause , betrayed any allusion to it ; it even seemed to have passed out of their thoughts . There had been the great sad event of their mother 's death to fill their minds on the next occasion of their meeting Molly ; and since then long pauses of intercourse had taken place ; so that she sometimes felt as if both the brothers must have forgotten how she had come to know their important secret . She even found herself often entirely forgetting it , but perhaps the consciousness of it was present to her unawares , and enabled her to comprehend the real nature of Osborne 's feelings towards Cynthia . At any rate , she never for a moment had supposed that his gentle kind manner towards Cynthia was anything but the courtesy of a friend . Strange to say , in these latter days Molly had looked upon Osborne 's relation to herself as pretty much the same as that in which at one time she had regarded Roger 's ; and she thought of the former as of some one as nearly a brother both to Cynthia and herself , as any young man could well be , whom they had not known in childhood , and who was in nowise related to them . She thought that he was very much improved in manner , and probably in character , by his mother 's death . He was no longer sarcastic , or fastidious , or vain , or self - confident . She did not know how often all these styles of talk or of behaviour were put on to conceal shyness or consciousness , and to veil the real self from strangers . Osborne 's conversation and ways might very possibly have been just the same as before , had he been thrown amongst new people ; but Molly only saw him in their own circle in which he was on terms of decided intimacy . Still there was no doubt that he was really improved , though perhaps not to the extent for which Molly gave him credit ; and this exaggeration on her part arose very naturally from the fact , that he , perceiving Roger 's warm admiration for Cynthia , withdrew a little out of his brother 's way ; and used to go and talk to Molly in order not to intrude himself between Roger and Cynthia . Of the two , perhaps , Osborne preferred Molly ; to her he needed not to talk if the mood was not on him -- they were on those happy terms where silence is permissible , and where efforts to act against the prevailing mood of the mind are not required . Sometimes , indeed , when Osborne was in the humour to be critical and fastidious as of yore , he used to vex Roger by insisting upon it that Molly was prettier than Cynthia . "

160660	160877	160626	160626	I	0	" And now both Osborne and Roger had left the neighbourhood . In spite of all that Mrs. Gibson had said about Roger 's visits being ill - timed and intrusive , she began to feel as if they had been a very pleasant variety , now that they had ceased altogether . He brought in a whiff of a new atmosphere from that of Hollingford . He and his brother had been always ready to do numberless little things which only a man can do for women ; small services which Mr. Gibson was always too busy to render . For the good doctor 's business grew upon him . He thought that this increase was owing to his greater skill and experience , and he would probably have been mortified if he could have known how many of his patients were solely biassed in sending for him , by the fact that he was employed at the Towers . Something of this sort must have been contemplated in the low scale of payment adopted long ago by the Cumnor family . Of itself the money he received for going to the Towers would hardly have paid him for horse - flesh , but then , as Lady Cumnor in her younger days had worded it,-- "
160904	161522	161529	161529	you	213	" So the prestige was tacitly sold and paid for ; but neither buyer nor seller defined the nature of the bargain . On the whole , it was as well that Mr. Gibson spent so much of his time from home . He sometimes thought so himself when he heard his wife 's plaintive fret or pretty babble over totally indifferent things , and perceived of how flimsy a nature were all her fine sentiments . Still , he did not allow himself to repine over the step he had taken ; he wilfully shut his eyes and waxed up his ears to many small things that he knew would have irritated him if he had attended to them ; and , in his solitary rides , he forced himself to dwell on the positive advantages that had accrued to him and his through his marriage . He had obtained an unexceptionable chaperone , if not a tender mother , for his little girl ; a skilful manager of his previous disorderly household ; a woman who was graceful and pleasant to look at for the head of his table . Moreover , Cynthia reckoned for something on the favourable side of the balance . She was a capital companion for Molly ; and the two were evidently very fond of each other . The feminine companionship of the mother and daughter was agreeable to him as well as to his child,--when Mrs. Gibson was moderately sensible and not over - sentimental , he mentally added ; and then he checked himself , for he would not allow himself to become more aware of her faults and foibles by defining them . At any rate , she was harmless , and wonderfully just to Molly for a stepmother . She piqued herself upon this indeed , and would often call attention to the fact of her being unlike other women in this respect . Just then sudden tears came into Mr. Gibson 's eyes , as he remembered how quiet and undemonstrative his little Molly had become in her general behaviour to him ; but how once or twice , when they had met upon the stairs , or were otherwise unwitnessed , she had caught him and kissed him -- hand or cheek -- in a sad passionateness of affection . But in a moment he began to whistle an old Scotch air he had heard in his childhood , and which had never recurred to his memory since ; and five minutes afterwards he was too busily treating a case of white swelling in the knee of a little boy , and thinking how to relieve the poor mother , who went out charring all day , and had to listen to the moans of her child all night , to have any thought for his own cares , which , if they really existed , were of so trifling a nature compared to the hard reality of this hopeless woe . Osborne came home first . He returned , in fact , not long after Roger had gone away ; but he was languid and unwell , and , though he did not complain , he felt unequal to any exertion . Thus a week or more elapsed before any of the Gibsons knew that he was at the Hall ; and then it was only by chance that they became aware of it .

There were few signs of the invalid about him ; and what few there were disappeared under the bright pleasant influence of such a welcome as he received from all . Molly and Cynthia had much to tell him of the small proceedings since he went away , or to relate the conclusions of half - accomplished projects . Cynthia was often on the point of some gay , careless inquiry as to where he had been , and what he had been doing ; but Molly , who conjectured the truth , as often interfered to spare him the pain of equivocation -- a pain that her tender conscience would have felt for him , much more than he would have felt it for himself . Mrs. Gibson 's talk was desultory , complimentary , and sentimental , after her usual fashion ; but still , on the whole , though Osborne smiled to himself at much that she said , it was soothing and agreeable . Presently , Dr. Nicholls and Mr. Gibson came in ; the former had had some conference with the latter on the subject of Osborne 's health ; and , from time to time , the skilful old physician 's sharp and observant eyes gave a comprehensive look at Osborne . Then there was lunch , when every one was merry and hungry , excepting the hostess , who was trying to train her midday appetite into the genteelest of all ways , and thought ( falsely enough ) that Dr. Nicholls was a good person to practise the semblance of ill - health upon , and that he would give her the proper civil amount of commiseration for her ailments , which every guest ought to bestow upon a hostess who complains of her delicacy of health . The old doctor was too cunning a man to fall into this trap . He would keep recommending her to try the coarsest viands on the table ; and , at last , he told her if she could not fancy the cold beef to try a little with pickled onions . There was a twinkle in his eye as he said this , that would have betrayed his humour to any observer ; but Mr. Gibson , Cynthia , and Molly were all attacking Osborne on the subject of some literary preference he had expressed , and Dr. Nicholls had Mrs. Gibson quite at his mercy . She was not sorry when luncheon was over to leave the room to the three gentlemen ; and ever afterwards she spoke of Dr. Nicholls as "

Mrs. Gibson had to go out and pay some calls , so she left the three together ; and after a while they adjourned into the garden , Osborne lounging on a chair , while Molly employed herself busily in tying up carnations , and Cynthia gathered flowers in her careless , graceful way .

And then Osborne went away . But Molly had set herself a task to dig up such roots as had already flowered , and to put down some bedding - out plants in their stead . Tired and heated as she was she finished it , and then went upstairs to rest , and change her dress . According to her wo nt , she sought for Cynthia ; there was no reply to her soft knock at the bedroom - door opposite to her own , and , thinking that Cynthia might have fallen asleep , and be lying uncovered in the draught of the open window , she went in softly . Cynthia was lying upon the bed as if she had thrown herself down on it without caring for the ease or comfort of her position . She was very still ; and Molly took a shawl , and was going to place it over her , when she opened her eyes , and spoke,-- "

Again Cynthia was lost in thought ; then , catching the echo of Molly 's last words in her mind , she said,-- "

When she had gone , Cynthia noiselessly locked the door ; and , taking her purse out of her desk , she began to count over her money . She counted it once -- she counted it twice , as if desirous of finding out some mistake which should prove it to be more than it was ; but the end of it all was a sigh . "

165402	165600	165601	165601	I	0	" Osborne had gained one or two ideas as to her treatment of Roger the last time he had called . Roger had not complained of it , or even mentioned it , till that very morning ; when Osborne was on the point of starting , and had urged Roger to accompany him , the latter had told him something of what Mrs. Gibson had said . He spoke rather as if he was more amused than annoyed ; but Osborne could read that he was chagrined at those restrictions placed upon calls which were the greatest pleasure of his life . Neither of them let out the suspicion which had entered both their minds -- the well - grounded suspicion arising from the fact that Osborne 's visits , be they paid early or late , had never yet been met with a repulse . Osborne now reproached himself with having done Mrs. Gibson injustice . She was evidently a weak , but probably a disinterested , woman ; and it was only a little bit of ill - temper on her part which had caused her to speak to Roger as she had done . "
165617	165621	165608	165608	me	0	" said Roger . "
165678	166618	165662	165662	I	0	" Still , Roger did not choose to go again for two or three weeks , and the consequence was that the next time he called the ladies were out . Once again he had the same ill - luck , and then he received a little pretty three - cornered note from Mrs. Gibson:-- MY DEAR SIR , How is it that you are become so formal all on a sudden , leaving cards , instead of awaiting our return ? Fie for shame ! If you had seen the faces of disappointment that I did when the horrid little bits of pasteboard were displayed to our view , you would not have borne malice against me so long ; for it is really punishing others as well as my naughty self . If you will come to - morrow -- as early as you like -- and lunch with us , I 'll own I was cross , and acknowledge myself a penitent.--Yours ever , HYACINTH C. K. GIBSON . There was no resisting this , even if there had not been strong inclination to back up the pretty words . Roger went , and Mrs. Gibson caressed and petted him in her sweetest , silkiest manner . Cynthia looked lovelier than ever to him for the slight restriction that had been laid for a time on their intercourse . She might be gay and sparkling with Osborne ; with Roger she was soft and grave . Instinctively she knew her men . She saw that Osborne was only interested in her because of her position in a family with whom he was intimate ; that his friendship was without the least touch of sentiment ; and that his admiration was only the warm criticism of an artist for unusual beauty . But she felt how different Roger 's relation to her was . To him she was _ the _ one , alone , peerless . If his love was prohibited , it would be long years before he could sink down into tepid friendship ; and to him her personal loveliness was only one of the many charms that made him tremble into passion . Cynthia was not capable of returning such feelings ; she had had too little true love in her life , and perhaps too much admiration to do so ; but she appreciated this honest ardour , this loyal worship that was new to her experience . Such appreciation , and such respect for his true and affectionate nature , gave a serious tenderness to her manner to Roger , which allured him with a fresh and separate grace . Molly sate by , and wondered how it would all end , or , rather , how soon it would all end , for she thought that no girl could resist such reverent passion ; and on Roger 's side there could be no doubt -- alas ! there could be no doubt . An older spectator might have looked far ahead , and thought of the question of pounds , shillings , and pence . Where was the necessary income for a marriage to come from ? Roger had his Fellowship now , it is true ; but the income of that would be lost if he married ; he had no profession , and the life interest of the two or three thousand pounds that he inherited from his mother , belonged to his father . This older spectator might have been a little surprised at the _ empressement _ of Mrs. Gibson 's manner to a younger son , always supposing this said spectator to have read to the depths of her worldly heart . Never had she tried to be more agreeable to Osborne ; and though her attempt was a great failure when practised upon Roger , and he did not know what to say in reply to the delicate flatteries which he felt to be insincere , he saw that she intended him to consider himself henceforward free of the house ; and he was too glad to avail himself of this privilege to examine over - closely into what might be her motives for her change of manner . He shut his eyes , and chose to believe that she was now desirous of making up for her little burst of temper on his previous visit . The result of Osborne 's conference with the two doctors had been certain prescriptions which appeared to have done him much good , and which would in all probability have done him yet more , could he have been free of the recollection of the little patient wife in her solitude near Winchester . He went to her whenever he could ; and , thanks to Roger , money was far more plentiful with him now than it had been . But he still shrank , and perhaps even more and more , from telling his father of his marriage . Some bodily instinct made him dread all agitation inexpressibly . If he had not had this money from Roger , he might have been compelled to tell his father all , and to ask for the necessary funds to provide for the wife and the coming child . But with enough in hand , and a secret , though remorseful , conviction that as long as Roger had a penny his brother was sure to have half of it , made him more reluctant than ever to irritate his father by a revelation of his secret . "
166628	166639	165662	165662	I	0	" he kept saying both to Roger and to himself . "
166656	166952	166652	166652	I	0	Roger"--and then visions of poetical and romantic reconciliations brought about between father and son , through the medium of a child , the offspring of a forbidden marriage , became still more vividly possible to him , and at any rate it was a staving - off of an unpleasant thing . He atoned to himself for taking so much of Roger 's Fellowship money by reflecting that , if Roger married , he would lose this source of revenue ; yet Osborne was throwing no impediment in the way of this event , rather forwarding it by promoting every possible means of his brother 's seeing the lady of his love . Osborne ended his reflections by convincing himself of his own generosity . CHAPTER XXX . OLD WAYS AND NEW WAYS . [ Illustration ( untitled ) ] Mr. Preston was now installed in his new house at Hollingford ; Mr. Sheepshanks having entered into dignified idleness at the house of his married daughter , who lived in the county town . His successor had plunged with energy into all manner of improvements ; and among others , he fell to draining a piece of outlying waste and unreclaimed land of Lord Cumnor 's , which was close to Squire Hamley 's property -- that very piece for which he had had the Government grant , but which now lay neglected , and only half drained , with stacks of mossy tiles , and lines of upturned furrows telling of abortive plans . It was not often that the Squire rode in this direction now - a - days ; but the cottage of a man who had been the squire 's gamekeeper in those more prosperous days when the Hamleys could afford to "
166955	167261	167262	167264	the Whig rascals	3984	" was close to the rush - grown ground . This old servant and tenant was ill , and had sent a message up to the Hall , asking to see the Squire : not to reveal any secret , or to say anything particular , but only from the feudal loyalty , which made it seem to the dying man as if it would be a comfort to shake the hand , and look once more into the eyes of the lord and master whom he had served , and whose ancestors his own forbears had served for so many generations . And the Squire was as fully alive as old Silas to the claims of the tie that existed between them . Though he hated the thought , and still more , should hate the sight of the piece of land , on the side of which Silas 's cottage stood , the Squire ordered his horse , and rode off within half - an - hour of receiving the message . As he drew near the spot he thought he heard the sound of tools , and the hum of many voices , just as he used to hear them a year or two before . He listened with surprise . Yes ! Instead of the still solitude he had expected , there was the clink of iron , the heavy gradual thud of the fall of barrows - ful of soil -- the cry and shout of labourers . But not on his land -- better worth expense and trouble by far than the reedy clay common on which the men were , in fact , employed . He knew it was Lord Cumnor 's property ; and he knew Lord Cumnor and his family had gone up in the world ( "
167266	167419	167262	167264	the Whig rascals	3984	" ) , both in wealth and in station , as the Hamleys had gone down . But all the same -- in spite of long known facts , and in spite of reason -- the Squire 's ready anger rose high at the sight of his neighbour doing what he had been unable to do , and he a Whig , and his family only in the county since Queen Anne 's time . He went so far as to wonder whether they might not -- the labourers he meant -- avail themselves of his tiles , lying so conveniently close to hand . All these thoughts , regrets , and wonders were in his mind as he rode up to the cottage he was bound to , and gave his horse in charge to a little lad , who had hitherto found his morning 's business and amusement in playing at "

But he was old Silas 's grandson , and he might have battered the rude red earthenware to pieces -- a whole stack -- one by one , and the Squire would have said little or nothing . It was only that he would not spare one to a labourer of Lord Cumnor 's . No ! not one . Old Silas lay in a sort of closet , opening out of the family living - room . The small window that gave it light looked right on to the "

Everything about the old man was clean , if coarse ; and , with Death , the leveller , so close at hand , it was the labourer who made the first advances , and put out his horny hand to the Squire .

His daughter - in - law came in at the sound , and told the Squire that he had these coughing - bouts very frequently , and that she thought he would go off in one of them before long . This opinion of hers was spoken simply out before the old man , who now lay gasping and exhausted upon his pillow . Poor people acknowledge the inevitableness and the approach of death in a much more straightforward manner than is customary among more educated folk . The Squire was shocked at her hard - heartedness , as he considered it ; but the old man himself had received much tender kindness from his daughter - in - law ; and what she had just said was no more news to him than the fact that the sun would rise to - morrow .

He sate still a moment , looking at the busy work going on before him , and then at his own half - completed drainage . It was a bitter pill . He had objected to borrowing from Government , in the first instance ; and then his wife had persuaded him to the step ; and after it was once taken , he was as proud as could be of the only concession to the spirit of progress he ever made in his life . He had read and studied the subject pretty thoroughly , if also very slowly , during the time his wife had been influencing him . He was tolerably well up in agriculture , if in nothing else ; and at one time he had taken the lead among the neighbouring landowners , when he first began tile - drainage . In those days people used to speak of Squire Hamley 's hobby ; and at market ordinaries , or county dinners , they rather dreaded setting him off on long repetitions of arguments from the different pamphlets on the subject which he had read . And now the proprietors all around him were draining -- draining ; his interest to Government was running on all the same , though his works were stopped , and his tiles deteriorating in value . It was not a soothing consideration , and the Squire was almost ready to quarrel with his shadow . He wanted a vent for his ill - humour ; and suddenly remembering the devastations on his covers , which he had heard about not a quarter of an hour before , he rode towards the men busy at work on Lord Cumnor 's land . Just before he got up to them he encountered Mr. Preston , also on horseback , come to overlook his labourers . The Squire did not know him personally , but from the agent 's manner of speaking , and the deference that was evidently paid to him , Mr. Hamley saw that he was a responsible person . So he addressed the agent:--"I
168968	168971	168960	168960	you	4021	" Mr. Preston replied,--"Certainly
169008	169062	169063	169063	sir	1189	" The Squire bowed stiffly . He did not like his name to be asked or presumed upon in that manner . An equal might conjecture who he was , or recognize him , but , till he announced himself , an inferior had no right to do more than address him respectfully as "
169065	169075	169063	169063	sir	1189	" That was the Squire 's code of etiquette . "

There was something in the handsome and well - dressed agent 's tone and manner inexpressibly irritating to the squire , and it was not lessened by an involuntary comparison of the capital roadster on which Mr. Preston was mounted with his own ill - groomed and aged cob .

Neither of them saw Roger Hamley , who was just then approaching them with long , steady steps . He had seen his father from the door of old Silas 's cottage , and , as the poor fellow was still asleep , he was coming to speak to his father , and was near enough now to hear the next words . "

"
170073	170113	170065	170065	He	1265	" Mr. Preston turned to Roger , as if appealing from Philip drunk to Philip sober , and spoke in a tone of cool explanation , which , though not insolent in words , was excessively irritating in manner . "

170372	170419	170362	170362	you	1189	" So he endeavoured to wile the Squire away to prevent further words . He was not entirely successful . Mr. Preston was enraged by Roger 's calm and dignified manner , and threw after them this parting shaft , in the shape of a loud soliloquy,-- "
170468	170577	170580	170580	Roger	211	" They were too far off to hear the rest . The Squire was on the point of turning back before this , but Roger took hold of the reins of the old mare , and led her over some of the boggy ground , as if to guide her into sure footing , but , in reality , because he was determined to prevent the renewal of the quarrel . It was well that the cob knew him , and was , indeed , old enough to prefer quietness to dancing ; for Mr. Hamley plucked hard at the reins , and at last broke out with an oath,--"Damn
170602	170656	170599	170599	I	0	" Roger let go ; they were now on firm ground , and he did not wish any watchers to think that he was exercising any constraint over his father ; and this quiet obedience to his impatient commands did more to soothe the Squire than anything else could have effected just then . "
170941	170990	170999	170999	mammy	4079	" He was lashing himself again into an impotent rage , painful to a son to witness ; but just then the little grandchild of old Silas , who had held the Squire 's horse during his visit to the sick man , came running up , breathless : "
171038	171247	171023	171023	she	4079	" So they went to the cottage , the Squire speaking never a word , but suddenly feeling as if lifted out of a whirlwind and set down in a still and awful place . CHAPTER XXXI . A PASSIVE COQUETTE . It is not to be supposed that such an encounter as Mr. Preston had just had with Roger Hamley sweetened the regards in which the two young men henceforward held each other . They had barely spoken to one another before , and but seldom met ; for the land - agent 's employment had hitherto lain at Ashcombe , some sixteen or seventeen miles from Hamley . He was older than Roger by several years ; but during the time he had been in the county Osborne and Roger had been at school and at college . Mr. Preston was prepared to dislike the Hamleys for many unreasonable reasons . Cynthia and Molly had both spoken of the brothers with familiar regard , implying considerable intimacy ; their flowers had been preferred to his on the occasion of the ball ; most people spoke well of them ; and Mr. Preston had an animal 's instinctive jealousy and combativeness against all popular young men . Their "
171248	171643	171645	171645	his	4082	position"--poor as the Hamleys might be -- was far higher than his own in the county ; and , moreover , he was agent to the great Whig lord , whose political interests were diametrically opposed to those of the old Tory squire . Not that Lord Cumnor troubled himself much about his political interests . His family had obtained property and title from the Whigs at the time of the Hanoverian succession ; and so , traditionally , he was a Whig , and had belonged in his youth to Whig clubs , where he had lost considerable sums of money to Whig gamblers . All this was satisfactory and consistent enough . And if Lord Hollingford had not been returned for the county on the Whig interest -- as his father had been before him , until he had succeeded to the title -- it is quite probable Lord Cumnor would have considered the British constitution in danger , and the patriotism of his ancestors ungratefully ignored . But , excepting at elections , he had no notion of making Whig and Tory a party cry . He had lived too much in London , and was of too sociable a nature , to exclude any man who jumped with his humour from the hospitality he was always ready to offer , be the agreeable acquaintance Whig , Tory , or Radical . But in the county of which he was lord - lieutenant , the old party distinction was still a shibboleth by which men were tested as to their fitness for social intercourse , as well as on the hustings . If by any chance a Whig found himself at a Tory dinner - table -- or vice vers--the food was hard of digestion , and wine and viands were criticized rather than enjoyed . A marriage between the young people of the separate parties was almost as unheard - of and prohibited an alliance as that of Romeo and Juliet 's . And of course Mr. Preston was not a man in whose breast such prejudices would die away . They were an excitement to him for one thing , and called out all his talent for intrigue on behalf of the party to which he was allied . Moreover , he considered it as loyalty to his employer to "
171647	171697	171698	171699	That prig	4084	" by any means in his power . He had always hated and despised the Tories in general ; and after that interview on the marshy common in front of Silas 's cottage , he hated the Hamleys and Roger especially , with a very choice and particular hatred . "
171701	171707	171645	171645	his	4082	" as hereafter he always designated Roger--"he
171714	171733	171698	171699	That prig	4084	" he said to himself by way of consolation , after the father and son had left him . "

Mr. Preston had many causes for rejoicing : he might have forgotten this discomfiture , as he chose to feel it , in the remembrance of an increase of income , and in the popularity he enjoyed in his new abode . All Hollingford came forward to do the earl 's new agent honour . Mr. Sheepshanks had been a crabbed , crusty old bachelor , frequenting inn - parlours on market days , not unwilling to give dinners to three or four chosen friends and familiars , with whom , in return , he dined from time to time , and with whom , also , he kept up an amicable rivalry in the matter of wines . But he "
171991	172024	172025	172027	those old women	4094	" as Miss Browning elegantly worded his unwillingness to accept the invitations of the Hollingford ladies . He was even unrefined enough to speak of these invitations to his intimate friends aforesaid as "
172031	172106	172025	172027	those old women	4094	" but , of course , they never heard of this . Little quarter - of - sheet notes , without any envelopes -- that invention was unknown in those days -- but sealed in the corners when folded up instead of gummed as they are fastened at present -- occasionally passed between Mr. Sheepshanks and the Miss Brownings , Mrs. Goodenough or others . From the first - mentioned ladies the form ran as follows:--"Miss
172167	172173	172174	172175	Mrs. Goodenough	175	" Now for Mrs. Goodenough . "
172239	172428	172225	172226	Mrs. Goodenough	175	" No need for the dates of the days of the month . The good ladies would have thought that the world was coming to an end if the invitation had been sent out a week before the party therein named . But not even guinea - fowls for supper could tempt Mr. Sheepshanks . He remembered the made - wines he had tasted in former days at Hollingford parties , and shuddered . Bread - and - cheese , with a glass of bitter - beer , or a little brandy - and - water , partaken of in his old clothes ( which had worn into shapes of loose comfort , and smelt strongly of tobacco ) , he liked better than roast guinea - fowl and birch - wine , even without throwing into the balance the stiff uneasy coat , and the tight neckcloth and tighter shoes . So the ex - agent had been seldom , if ever , seen at the Hollingford tea - parties . He might have had his form of refusal stereotyped , it was so invariably the same . "

172480	172521	172525	172525	he	164	" But now that Mr. Preston had succeeded , and come to live in Hollingford , things were changed . He accepted every civility right and left , and won golden opinions accordingly . Parties were made in his honour , "

172583	172596	172597	172597	Preston	260	" from the friends whom the old steward still retained at Hollingford . "
172622	172633	172613	172613	He	260	" The sagacious old bachelor was right . Mr. Preston was "
172635	172831	172832	172832	She	4107	" something more than mere popularity . He went wherever he had a chance of meeting Cynthia Kirkpatrick . It might be that Molly 's spirits were more depressed at this time than they were in general ; or that Cynthia was exultant , unawares to herself , in the amount of attention and admiration she was receiving from Roger by day , from Mr. Preston in the evening , but the two girls seemed to have parted company in cheerfulness . Molly was always gentle , but very grave and silent . Cynthia , on the contrary , was merry , full of pretty mockeries , and hardly ever silent . When first she came to Hollingford one of her great charms had been that she was such a gracious listener ; now her excitement , by whatever caused , made her too restless to hold her tongue ; yet what she said was too pretty , too witty , not to be a winning and sparkling interruption , eagerly welcomed by those who were under her sway . Mr. Gibson was the only one who observed this change , and reasoned upon it . "
172842	172848	172832	172832	She	4107	" thought he to himself . "
172862	173361	172860	172860	her	4107	" If Molly had not been so entirely loyal to her friend , she might have thought this constant brilliancy a little tiresome when brought into every - day life ; it was not the sunshiny rest of a placid lake , it was rather the glitter of the pieces of a broken mirror , which confuses and bewilders . Cynthia would not talk quietly about anything now ; subjects of thought or conversation seemed to have lost their relative value . There were exceptions to this mood of hers , when she sank into deep fits of silence , that would have been gloomy had it not been for the never varying sweetness of her temper . If there was a little kindness to be done to either Mr. Gibson or Molly , Cynthia was just as ready as ever to do it ; nor did she refuse to do anything her mother wished , however fidgety might be the humour that prompted the wish . But in this latter case Cynthia 's eyes were not quickened by her heart . Molly was dejected , she knew not why . Cynthia had drifted a little apart ; that was not it . Her stepmother had whimsical moods ; and if Cynthia displeased her , she would oppress Molly with small kindnesses and pseudo - affection . Or else everything was wrong , the world was out of joint , and Molly had failed in her mission to set it right , and was to be blamed accordingly . But Molly was of too steady a disposition to be much moved by the changeableness of an unreasonable person . She might be annoyed , or irritated , but she was not depressed . That was not it . The real cause was certainly this . As long as Roger was drawn to Cynthia , and sought her of his own accord , it had been a sore pain and bewilderment to Molly 's heart ; but it was a straightforward attraction , and one which Molly acknowledged , in her humility and great power of loving , to be the most natural thing in the world . She would look at Cynthia 's beauty and grace , and feel as if no one could resist it . And when she witnessed all the small signs of honest devotion which Roger was at no pains to conceal , she thought , with a sigh , that surely no girl could help relinquishing her heart to such tender , strong keeping as Roger 's character ensured . She would have been willing to cut off her right hand , if need were , to forward his attachment to Cynthia ; and the self - sacrifice would have added a strange zest to a happy crisis . She was indignant at what she considered to be Mrs. Gibson 's obtuseness to so much goodness and worth ; and when she called Roger "
173366	173451	173362	173364	a country lout	4108	" or any other depreciative epithet , Molly would pinch herself in order to keep silent . But after all , those were peaceful days compared to the present , when she , seeing the wrong side of the tapestry , after the wo nt of those who dwell in the same house with a plotter , became aware that Mrs. Gibson had totally changed her behaviour to Roger , from some cause unknown to Molly . But he was always exactly the same ; "
173457	173469	173362	173364	a country lout	4108	" as Mrs. Gibson called him , with her usual originality ; "
173483	173844	173362	173364	a country lout	4108	" as Mrs. Hamley had once spoken of him . So the cause of Mrs. Gibson 's altered manner lay not in him . Yet now he was sure of a welcome , let him come at any hour he would . He was playfully reproved for having taken Mrs. Gibson 's words too literally , and for never coming before lunch . But he said he considered her reasons for such words to be valid , and should respect them . And this was done out of his simplicity , and from no tinge of malice . Then in their family conversations at home , Mrs. Gibson was constantly making projects for throwing Roger and Cynthia together , with so evident a betrayal of her wish to bring about an engagement , that Molly chafed at the net spread so evidently , and at Roger 's blindness in coming so willingly to be entrapped . She forgot his previous willingness , his former evidences of manly fondness for the beautiful Cynthia ; she only saw plots of which he was the victim , and Cynthia the conscious if passive bait . She felt as if she could not have acted as Cynthia did ; no , not even to gain Roger 's love . Cynthia heard and saw as much of the domestic background as she did , and yet she submitted to the rle assigned to her ! To be sure , this rle would have been played by her unconsciously ; the things prescribed were what she would naturally have done ; but because they were prescribed -- by implication only , it is true -- Molly would have resisted ; have gone out , for instance , when she was expected to stay at home ; or have lingered in the garden when a long country walk was planned . At last -- for she could not help loving Cynthia , come what would -- she determined to believe that Cynthia was entirely unaware of all ; but it was with an effort that she brought herself to believe it . It may be all very pleasant "
173862	174304	173858	173858	Ne¾ra	402	" but young men at the outset of their independent life have many other cares in this prosaic England to occupy their time and their thoughts . Roger was Fellow of Trinity , to be sure ; and from the outside it certainly appeared as if his position , as long as he chose to keep unmarried , was a very easy one . His was not a nature , however , to sink down into inglorious ease , even had his fellowship income been at his disposal . He looked forward to an active life ; in what direction he had not yet determined . He knew what were his talents and his tastes ; and did not wish the former to lie buried , nor the latter , which he regarded as gifts , fitting him for some peculiar work , to be disregarded or thwarted . He rather liked awaiting an object , secure in his own energy to force his way to it , when once he saw it clearly . He reserved enough of money for his own personal needs , which were small , and for the ready furtherance of any project he might see fit to undertake ; the rest of his income was Osborne 's ; given and accepted in the spirit which made the bond between these two brothers so rarely perfect . It was only the thought of Cynthia that threw Roger off his balance . A strong man in everything else , about her he was as a child . He knew that he could not marry and retain his fellowship ; his intention was to hold himself loose from any employment or profession until he had found one to his mind , so there was no immediate prospect -- no prospect for many years , indeed , that he would be able to marry . Yet he went on seeking Cynthia 's sweet company , listening to the music of her voice , basking in her sunshine , and feeding his passion in every possible way , just like an unreasoning child . He knew that it was folly -- and yet he did it ; and it was perhaps this that made him so sympathetic with Osborne . Roger racked his brains about Osborne 's affairs much more frequently than Osborne troubled himself . Indeed , he had become so ailing and languid of late , that even the Squire made only very faint objections to his desire for frequent change of scene , though formerly he used to grumble so much at the necessary expenditure it involved . "
174314	174323	174326	174326	he	4109	" the Squire said to Roger one day . "

174450	174592	174424	174424	Roger	211	" The Squire dwelt so much upon Osborne 's reserved behaviour to himself , that brooding over this one subject perpetually he became more morose and gloomy than ever in his manner to Osborne , resenting the want of the confidence and affection that he thus repelled . So much so that Roger , who desired to avoid being made the receptacle of his father 's complaints against Osborne -- and Roger 's passive listening was the sedative his father always sought -- had often to have recourse to the discussion of the drainage works as a counter - irritant . The Squire had felt Mr. Preston 's speech about the dismissal of his work - people very keenly ; it fell in with the reproaches of his own conscience , though , as he would repeat to Roger over and over again,--"I

Roger had turned over many plans in his mind , by which he thought that he could obtain sufficient money for the purpose he desired to accomplish . His careful grandfather , who had been a merchant in the city , had so tied up the few thousands he had left to his daughter , that although , in case of her death before her husband 's , the latter might enjoy the life - interest thereof , yet , in case of both their deaths , their second son did not succeed to the property until he was five - and - twenty ; and if he died before that age , the money that would then have been his went to one of his cousins on the maternal side . In short , the old merchant had taken as many precautions about his legacy as if it had been for tens , instead of units of thousands . Of course Roger might have slipped through all these meshes by insuring his life until the specified age ; and , probably , if he had consulted any lawyer , this course would have been suggested to him . But he disliked taking any one into his confidence on the subject of his father 's want of ready money . He had obtained a copy of his grandfather 's will at Doctors ' Commons , and he imagined that all the contingencies involved in it would be patent to the light of nature and common sense . He was a little mistaken in this , but not the less resolved that money in some way he would have in order to fulfil his promise to his father , and for the ulterior purpose of giving the squire some daily interest to distract his thoughts from the regrets and cares that were almost weakening his mind . It was "

And if he , the husband , did not , how much less did Aime , the trustful wife ? Yet who could tell how much misery any shadows of illegality might cast into the future ? One evening Roger , sitting by the languid , careless , dilettante Osborne , began to question him as to the details of the marriage . Osborne knew instinctively at what Roger was aiming . It was not that he did not desire perfect legality in justice to his wife ; it was that he was so indisposed at the time that he hated to be bothered . It was something like the refrain of Gray 's Scandinavian Prophetess : "

But if this ungenerous thought of Osborne 's had been set clearly before his conscience , he would have smote his breast and cried "

177167	177228	177161	177165	the providence of the family	4190	" exclaimed Osborne , suddenly struck by admiration at his brother 's conduct , and forgetting to contrast it with his own . So Roger went up to London and Osborne followed him , and for two or three weeks the Gibsons saw nothing of the brothers . But as wave succeeds to wave , so interest succeeds to interest . "
177232	177642	177161	177165	the providence of the family	4190	" as they were called , came down for their autumn sojourn at the Towers , and again the house was full of visitors , and the Towers ' servants , and carriages , and liveries were seen in the two streets of Hollingford , just as they might have been seen for scores of autumns past . So runs the round of life from day to day . Mrs. Gibson found the chances of intercourse with the Towers rather more personally exciting than Roger 's visits , or the rarer calls of Osborne Hamley . Cynthia had an old antipathy to the great family who had made so much of her mother and so little of her ; and whom she considered as in some measure the cause why she had seen so little of her mother in the days when the little girl had craved for love and found none . Moreover , Cynthia missed her slave , although she did not care for Roger one thousandth part of what he did for her ; yet she had found it not unpleasant to have a man whom she thoroughly respected , and whom men in general respected , the subject of her eye , the glad ministrant to each scarce - spoken wish , a person in whose sight all her words were pearls or diamonds , all her actions heavenly graciousness , and in whose thoughts she reigned supreme . She had no modest unconsciousness about her ; and yet she was not vain . She knew of all this worship ; and when from circumstances she no longer received it , she missed it . The Earl and the Countess , Lord Hollingford and Lady Harriet , lords and ladies in general , liveries , dresses , bags of game , and rumours of riding parties , were as nothing to her compared to Roger 's absence . And yet she did not love him . No , she did not love him . Molly knew that Cynthia did not love him . Molly grew angry with her many and many a time as the conviction of this fact was forced upon her . Molly did not know her own feelings ; Roger had no overwhelming interest in what they might be ; while his very life - breath seemed to depend on what Cynthia felt and thought . Therefore Molly had keen insight into her "
177645	177695	177161	177165	the providence of the family	4190	" heart ; and she knew that Cynthia did not love Roger . Molly could have cried with passionate regret at the thought of the unvalued treasure lying at Cynthia 's feet ; and it would have been a merely unselfish regret . It was the old fervid tenderness : "
177715	177754	177755	177755	I	0	" Cynthia 's love was the moon Roger yearned for ; and Molly saw that it was far away and out of reach , else would she have strained her heart - cords to give it to Roger . "
177760	177767	177755	177755	I	0	" she would say to herself . "
177824	178044	178045	178045	Molly	221	" One day Lady Harriet came to call on the Gibsons , or rather on Mrs. Gibson , for the latter retained her old jealousy if any one else in Hollingford was supposed to be on intimate terms at the great house , or in the least acquainted with their plans . Mr. Gibson might possibly know as much , but then he was professionally bound to secrecy . Out of the house she considered Mr. Preston as her rival , and he was aware that she did so , and delighted in teasing her by affecting a knowledge of family plans and details of affairs of which she was ignorant . Indoors she was jealous of the fancy Lady Harriet had evidently taken for her step - daughter , and she contrived to place quiet obstacles in the way of a too frequent intercourse between the two . These obstacles were not unlike the shield of the knight in the old story ; only instead of the two sides presented to the two travellers approaching it from opposite quarters , one of which was silver , and one of which was gold , Lady Harriet saw the smooth and shining yellow radiance , while poor Molly only perceived a dull and heavy lead . To Lady Harriet it was "

179864	179879	179860	179862	Poor Lady Harriet	179	" and then she purred affectionately . After a pause Lady Harriet started up and said--"I

180593	180628	180631	180631	Apollo	410	" So she rang twice ; with great distinctness , and with a long pause between the rings . Maria brought in coals . But the signal was as well understood by Cynthia as the "
180632	180815	180631	180631	Apollo	410	" was by the servants of Lucullus . The brace of partridges that were to have been for the late dinner were instantly put down to the fire ; and the prettiest china brought out , and the table decked with flowers and fruit , arranged with all Cynthia 's usual dexterity and taste . So that when the meal was announced , and Lady Harriet entered the room , she could not but think her hostess 's apologies had been quite unnecessary ; and be more and more convinced that Clare had done very well for herself . Cynthia now joined the party , pretty and elegant as she always was ; but somehow she did not take Lady Harriet 's fancy ; she only noticed her on account of her being her mother 's daughter . Her presence made the conversation more general , and Lady Harriet gave out several pieces of news , none of them of any great importance to her , but as what had been talked about by the circle of visitors assembled at the Towers . "
180825	180833	180816	180817	Lord Hollingford	194	" she said , amongst other things ; "

181247	181260	181244	181245	Roger Hamley	211	" exclaimed Cynthia , her eyes brightening , and her cheeks flushing . "
181277	181282	181283	181283	Hollingford	194	" said Mrs. Gibson . "
181297	181298	181293	181293	I	0	" "
181306	181310	181302	181304	Mr. Roger Hamley	211	" said Cynthia ; "

181342	181347	181336	181336	Molly	384	" asked Lady Harriet . "
181350	181384	181336	181336	Molly	384	" and she looked into Mrs. Gibson 's face for an answer . Mrs. Gibson in reply gave an intelligent and very expressive glance at Cynthia , who however did not perceive it . "
181391	181407	181336	181336	Molly	384	all,"--and Mrs. Gibson nodded a little at her daughter , as much as to say , "
181414	181474	181336	181336	Molly	384	" Lady Harriet began to look at the pretty Miss Kirkpatrick with fresh interest ; her brother had spoken in such a manner of this young Mr. Hamley that every one connected with the phoenix was worthy of observation . Then , as if the mention of Molly 's name had brought her afresh into her mind , Lady Harriet said,--"And
181502	181503	181493	181493	she	384	" "
181524	181529	181530	181532	The Miss Brownings	169	" said Mrs. Gibson . "
181604	181638	181640	181640	herself	4322	" So Mrs. Gibson , after all her precautions , had to submit to Lady Harriet 's leaving her half - an - hour earlier than she otherwise would have done in order to "
181642	182073	182074	182075	Roger Hamley	211	" ( as Mrs. Gibson expressed it ) by calling on the Miss Brownings . But Molly had left before Lady Harriet arrived . Molly went the long walk to the Holly Farm , to order the damsons , out of a kind of penitence . She had felt conscious of anger at being sent out of the house by such a palpable manoeuvre as that which her stepmother had employed . Of course she did not meet Cynthia , so she went alone along the pretty lanes , with grassy sides and high hedge - banks not at all in the style of modern agriculture . At first she made herself uncomfortable with questioning herself as to how far it was right to leave unnoticed the small domestic failings -- the webs , the distortions of truth which had prevailed in their household ever since her father 's second marriage . She knew that very often she longed to protest , but did not do it , from the desire of sparing her father any discord ; and she saw by his face that he , too , was occasionally aware of certain things that gave him pain , as showing that his wife 's standard of conduct was not as high as he would have liked . It was a wonder to Molly whether this silence was right or wrong . With a girl 's want of toleration , and want of experience to teach her the force of circumstances , and of temptation , she had often been on the point of telling her stepmother some forcible home truths . But , possibly , her father 's example of silence , and often some piece of kindness on Mrs. Gibson 's part ( for after her way , and when in a good temper , she was very kind to Molly ) , made her hold her tongue . That night at dinner , Mrs. Gibson recounted the conversation between herself and Lady Harriet , giving it a very strong individual colouring , as was her wo nt , and telling nearly the whole of what had passed , although implying that there was a great deal said which was so purely confidential , that she was bound in honour not to repeat it . Her three auditors listened to her without interrupting her much -- indeed , without bestowing extreme attention on what she was saying , until she came to the fact of Lord Hollingford 's absence in London , and the reason for it . "
182083	182093	182074	182075	Roger Hamley	211	" exclaimed Mr. Gibson , suddenly awakened into vivacity . "

182143	182163	182134	182134	I	0	" said Mr. Gibson ; and he relapsed into silence , keeping his ears open , however , henceforward . "
182171	182175	182176	182176	We	4325	" asked Cynthia . "
182182	182189	182176	182176	We	4325	" Molly 's lips formed an acquiescing "
182191	182553	182176	182176	We	4325	" to this remark , but no sound was heard . There was a buzzing in her ears as if the others were going on with the conversation , but the words they uttered seemed indistinct and blurred ; they were merely conjectures , and did not interfere with the one great piece of news . To the rest of the party she appeared to be eating her dinner as usual , and , if she were silent , there was one listener the more to Mrs. Gibson 's stream of prattle , and Mr. Gibson 's and Cynthia 's remarks . CHAPTER XXXIII . BRIGHTENING PROSPECTS . [ Illustration ( untitled ) ] It was a day or two afterwards , that Mr. Gibson made time to ride round by Hamley , desirous to learn more exact particulars of this scheme for Roger than he could obtain from any extraneous source , and rather puzzled to know whether he should interfere in the project or not . The state of the case was this:--Osborne 's symptoms were , in Mr. Gibson 's opinion , signs of his having a fatal disease . Dr. Nicholls had differed from him on this head , and Mr. Gibson knew that the old physician had had long experience , and was considered very skilful in the profession . Still he believed that he himself was right , and , if so , the complaint was one which might continue for years in the same state as at present , or might end the young man 's life in an hour -- a minute . Supposing that Mr. Gibson was right , would it be well for Roger to be away where no sudden calls for his presence could reach him -- away for two years ? Yet if the affair was concluded , the interference of a medical man might accelerate the very evil to be feared ; and after all , Dr. Nicholls might be right , and the symptoms might proceed from some other cause . Might ? Yes . Probably did ? No . Mr. Gibson could not bring himself to say "
182555	182820	182176	182176	We	4325	" to this latter form of sentence . So he rode on , meditating ; his reins slack , his head a little bent . It was one of those still and lovely autumn days when the red and yellow leaves are hanging - pegs to dewy , brilliant gossamer - webs ; when the hedges are full of trailing brambles , loaded with ripe blackberries ; when the air is full of the farewell whistles and pipes of birds , clear and short -- not the long full - throated warbles of spring ; when the whirr of the partridge 's wings is heard in the stubble - fields , as the sharp hoof - blows fall on the paved lanes ; when here and there a leaf floats and flutters down to the ground , although there is not a single breath of wind . The country surgeon felt the beauty of the seasons perhaps more than most men . He saw more of it by day , by night , in storm and sunshine , or in the still , soft , cloudy weather . He never spoke about what he felt on the subject ; indeed , he did not put his feelings into words , even to himself . But if his mood ever approached to the sentimental , it was on such days as this . He rode into the stable - yard , gave his horse to a man , and went into the house by a side entrance . In the passage he met the Squire . "

It was a manly , feeling , sensible letter , explaining to the old father in very simple language the services which were demanded by the terms of the will to which he and two or three others were trustees ; the liberal allowance for expenses , the still more liberal reward for performance , which had tempted several men of considerable renown to offer themselves as candidates for the appointment . Lord Hollingford then went on to say that , having seen a good deal of Roger lately , since the publication of his article in reply to the French osteologist , he had had reason to think that in him the trustees would find united the various qualities required in a greater measure than in any of the applicants who had at that time presented themselves . Roger had deep interest in the subject ; much acquired knowledge , and at the same time , great natural powers of comparison , and classification of facts ; he had shown himself to be an observer of a fine and accurate kind ; he was of the right age , in the very prime of health and strength , and unshackled by any family ties . Here Mr. Gibson paused for consideration . He hardly cared to ascertain by what steps the result had been arrived at -- he already knew what that result was ; but his mind was again arrested as his eye caught on the remuneration offered , which was indeed most liberal ; and then he read with attention the high praise bestowed on the son in this letter to the father . The Squire had been watching Mr. Gibson -- waiting till he came to this part -- and he rubbed his hands together as he said,-- "

183717	183953	183708	183708	God	348	" Mr. Gibson read the second letter , from Roger . To a certain degree it was a modest repetition of what Lord Hollingford had said , with an explanation of how he had come to take so decided a step in life without consulting his father . He did not wish him to be in suspense for one reason . Another was that he felt , as no one else could feel for him , that by accepting this offer , he entered upon the kind of life for which he knew himself to be most fitted . And then he merged the whole into business . He said that he knew well the suffering his father had gone through when he had had to give up his drainage works for want of money ; that he , Roger , had been enabled at once to raise money upon the remuneration he was to receive on the accomplishment of his two years ' work ; and that he had also insured his life , in order to provide for the repayment of the money he had raised , in case he did not live to return to England . He said that the sum he had borrowed on this security would at once be forwarded to his father . Mr. Gibson laid down the letter without speaking a word for some time ; then he said,--"He'll

185223	186578	186579	186579	her	4386	" It was all very fine giving the Squire this good advice ; but as Osborne had already formed the very kind of marriage his father most deprecated , it did not act quite as well as Mr. Gibson had hoped . The Squire began the conversation with unusual self - control ; but he grew irritated when Osborne denied his father 's right to interfere in any marriage he might contemplate ; denied it with a certain degree of doggedness and weariness of the subject that drove the Squire into one of his passions ; and although , on after reflection , he remembered that he had his son 's promise and solemn word not to think of either Cynthia or Molly for his wife , yet the father and son had passed through one of those altercations which help to estrange men for life . Each had said bitter things to the other ; and , if the brotherly affection had not been so true between Osborne and Roger , they too might have become alienated , in consequence of the Squire 's exaggerated and injudicious comparison of their characters and deeds . But as Roger in his boyhood had loved Osborne too well to be jealous of the praise and love which the eldest son , the beautiful brilliant lad , had received , to the disparagement of his own plain awkwardness and slowness , so now Osborne strove against any feeling of envy or jealousy with all his might ; but his efforts were conscious , Roger 's had been the simple consequence of affection , and the end to poor Osborne was that he became moody and depressed in mind and body ; but both father and son concealed their feelings in Roger 's presence . When he came home just before sailing , busy and happy , the Squire caught his infectious energy , and Osborne looked up and was cheerful . There was no time to be lost . He was bound to a hot climate , and must take all advantage possible of the winter months . He was to go first to Paris , to have interviews with some of the scientific men there . Some of his outfit , instruments , & amp;c . , were to follow him to Havre , from which port he was to embark , after transacting his business in Paris . The Squire learnt all his arrangements and plans , and even tried in after - dinner conversations to penetrate into the questions involved in the researches his son was about to make . But Roger 's visit home could not be prolonged beyond two days . The last day he rode into Hollingford earlier than he needed to have done to catch the London coach , in order to bid the Gibsons good - by . He had been too actively busy for some time to have leisure to bestow much thought on Cynthia ; but there was no need for fresh meditation on that subject . Her image as a prize to be worked for , to be served for seven years , and seven years more , was safe and sacred in his heart . It was very bad , this going away , and wishing her good - by for two long years ; and he wondered much during his ride how far he should be justified in telling her mother , perhaps in telling her own sweet self , what his feelings were without expecting , nay , indeed reprobating , any answer on her part . Then she would know at any rate how dearly she was beloved by one who was absent ; how in all difficulties or dangers the thought of her would be a polar star , high up in the heavens , and so on , and so on ; for with all a lover 's quickness of imagination and triteness of fancy , he called her a star , a flower , a nymph , a witch , an angel , or a mermaid , a nightingale , a siren , as one or another of her attributes rose up before him . CHAPTER XXXIV . A LOVER 'S MISTAKE . It was afternoon . Molly had gone out for a walk . Mrs. Gibson had been paying some calls . Lazy Cynthia had declined accompanying either . A daily walk was not a necessity to her as it was to Molly . On a lovely day , or with an agreeable object , or when the fancy took her , she could go as far as any one ; but these were exceptional cases ; in general , she was not disposed to disturb herself from her in - door occupations . Indeed , not one of the ladies would have left the house , had they been aware that Roger was in the neighbourhood ; for they were aware that he was to come down but once before his departure , and that his stay at home then would be but for a short time , and they were all anxious to wish him good - by before his long absence . But they had understood that he was not coming to the Hall until the following week , and therefore they had felt themselves at full liberty this afternoon to follow their own devices . Molly chose a walk that had been a favourite with her ever since she was a child . Something or other had happened just before she left home that made her begin wondering how far it was right for the sake of domestic peace to pass over without comment the little deviations from right that people perceive in those whom they live with . Or whether , as they are placed in families for distinct purposes , not by chance merely , there are not duties involved in this aspect of their lot in life,--whether by continually passing over failings , their own standard is not lowered,--the practical application of these thoughts being a dismal sort of perplexity on Molly 's part as to whether her father was quite aware of her stepmother 's perpetual lapses from truth ; and whether his blindness was wilful or not . Then she felt bitterly enough that although she was sure as could be that there was no real estrangement between her and her father , yet there were perpetual obstacles thrown in the way of their intercourse ; and she thought with a sigh that if he would but come in with authority , he might cut his way clear to the old intimacy with his daughter , and that they might have all the former walks and talks , and quips and cranks , and glimpses of real confidence once again ; things that her stepmother did not value , yet which she , like the dog in the manger , prevented Molly 's enjoying . But after all Molly was a girl , not so far removed from childhood ; and in the middle of her grave regrets and perplexities , her eye was caught by the sight of some fine ripe blackberries flourishing away high up on the hedge - bank among scarlet hips and green and russet leaves . She did not care much for blackberries herself ; but she had heard Cynthia say that she liked them ; and besides there was the charm of scrambling and gathering them ; so she forgot all about her troubles , and went climbing up the banks , and clutching at her almost inaccessible prizes , and slipping down again triumphant , to carry them back to the large leaf which was to serve her as a basket . One or two of them she tasted , but they were as vapid to her palate as ever . The skirt of her pretty print gown was torn out of the gathers , and even with the fruit she had eaten "
186590	186737	186579	186579	her	4386	" when having gathered as many and more than she could possibly carry , she set off home , hoping to escape into her room and mend her gown before it had offended Mrs. Gibson 's neat eye . The front door was easily opened from the outside , and Molly was out of the clear light of the open air and in the shadow of the hall , when she saw a face peep out of the dining - room before she quite recognized whose it was ; and then Mrs. Gibson came softly out , sufficiently at least to beckon her into the room . When Molly had entered Mrs. Gibson closed the door . Poor Molly expected a reprimand for her torn gown and untidy appearance , but was soon relieved by the expression of Mrs. Gibson 's face -- mysterious and radiant . "

186980	187504	186968	186968	I	0	" But Molly did not hear these last words . She had escaped upstairs , and shut her door . Instinctively she had carried her leaf full of blackberries -- what would blackberries be to Cynthia now ? She felt as if she could not understand it all ; but as for that matter , what could she understand ? Nothing . For a few minutes her brain seemed in too great a whirl to comprehend anything but that she was being carried on in earth 's diurnal course , with rocks , and stones , and trees , with as little volition on her part as if she were dead . Then the room grew stifling , and instinctively she went to the open casement window , and leant out , gasping for breath . Gradually the consciousness of the soft peaceful landscape stole into her mind , and stilled the buzzing confusion . There , bathed in the almost level rays of the autumn sunlight , lay the landscape she had known and loved from childhood ; as quiet , as full of low humming life as it had been at this hour for many generations . The autumn flowers blazed out in the garden below , the lazy cows were in the meadow beyond , chewing their cud in the green aftermath ; the evening fires had just been made up in the cottages beyond , in preparation for the husband 's home - coming , and were sending up soft curls of blue smoke into the still air ; the children , let loose from school , were shouting merrily in the distance , and she-- Just then she heard nearer sounds ; an opened door , steps on the lower flight of stairs . He could not have gone without even seeing her . He never , never would have done so cruel a thing -- never would have forgotten poor little Molly , however happy he might be ! No ! there were steps and voices , and the drawing - room door was opened and shut once more . She laid down her head on her arms that rested upon the window - sill , and cried,--she had been so distrustful as to have let the idea enter her mind that he could go without wishing her good - by -- her , whom his mother had so loved , and called by the name of his little dead sister . And as she thought of the tender love Mrs. Hamley had borne her she cried the more , for the vanishing of such love for her off the face of the earth . Suddenly the drawing - room door opened , and some one was heard coming upstairs ; it was Cynthia 's step . Molly hastily wiped her eyes , and stood up and tried to look unconcerned ; it was all she had time to do before Cynthia , after a little pause at the closed door , had knocked ; and on an answer being given , had said , without opening the door,--"Molly
187524	187628	187506	187508	Mr. Roger Hamley	211	" Then she went downstairs again , as if anxious just at that moment to avoid even so short a tte--tte with Molly . With a gulp and a fit of resolution , as a child makes up its mind to swallow a nauseous dose of medicine , Molly went instantly downstairs . Roger was talking earnestly to Mrs. Gibson in the bow of the window when Molly entered ; Cynthia was standing near , listening , but taking no part in the conversation . Her eyes were downcast , and she did not look up as Molly drew shyly near . Roger was saying,--"I
187672	187692	187702	187702	you	4398	" suddenly becoming aware of her presence , and turning to her , and taking her hand in both of his,--"I
187749	187798	187747	187747	she	384	" then he looked at Cynthia with passionate delight , and seemed to forget in that gaze that he had left his sentence to Molly half finished . Cynthia did not seem inclined to repeat her saying , whatever it was , but her mother spoke for her . "

Molly felt as if she could never bring herself to name the affair as a common piece of news . So it was only Mrs. Gibson that answered aloud,-- "

188541	188743	188744	188744	I	0	" His voice began to quiver , and it was best to be gone . Mrs. Gibson was pouring out , unheard and unheeded , words of farewell ; Cynthia was re - arranging some flowers in a vase on the table , the defects in which had caught her artistic eye , without the consciousness penetrating to her mind . Molly stood , numb to the heart ; neither glad nor sorry , nor anything but stunned . She felt the slackened touch of the warm grasping hand ; she looked up -- for till now her eyes had been downcast , as if there were heavy weights to their lids -- and the place was empty where he had been ; his quick step was heard on the stair , the front door was opened and shut ; and then as quick as lightning Molly ran up to the front attic -- the lumber - room , whose window commanded the street down which he must pass . The window - clasp was unused and stiff , Molly tugged at it -- unless it was open , and her head put out , that last chance would be gone . "
188756	189010	188753	188753	I	0	" she wailed out , as she was pulling . There he was , running hard to catch the London coach ; his luggage had been left at the George before he came up to wish the Gibsons good - by . In all his hurry , Molly saw him turn round and shade his eyes from the level rays of the westering sun , and rake the house with his glances -- in hopes , she knew , of catching one more glimpse of Cynthia . But apparently he saw no one , not even Molly at the attic casement ; for she had drawn back when he had turned , and kept herself in shadow ; for she had no right to put herself forward as the one to watch and yearn for farewell signs . None came -- another moment -- he was out of sight for years ! [ Illustration : THE LAST TURNING . ] She shut the window softly , and shivered all over . She left the attic and went to her own room ; but she did not begin to take off her out - of - door things till she heard Cynthia 's foot on the stairs . Then she hastily went to the toilet - table , and began to untie her bonnet - strings ; but they were in a knot , and took time to undo . Cynthia 's step stopped at Molly 's door ; she opened it a little and said,--"May

Molly did not turn to meet her , so Cynthia came up behind her , and putting her two hands round Molly 's waist , peeped over her shoulder , putting out her lips to be kissed . Molly could not resist the action -- the mute entreaty for a caress . But , in the moment before , she had caught the reflection of the two faces in the glass ; her own , red - eyed , pale , with lips dyed with blackberry juice , her curls tangled , her bonnet pulled awry , her gown torn -- and contrasted it with Cynthia 's brightness and bloom , and the trim elegance of her dress .

The next she had raised herself , and taken Cynthia 's two hands , and was holding her off a little , the better to read her face . [ Illustration : "

Suddenly she recalled herself to the present time , and her eye caught on the leaf full of blackberries -- the broad , green leaf , so fresh and crisp when Molly had gathered it an hour or so ago , but now soft and flabby , and dying .

THE MOTHER 'S MANOEUVRE . Mr. Gibson was not at home at dinner -- detained by some patient , most probably . This was not an unusual occurrence ; but it _ was _ rather an unusual occurrence for Mrs. Gibson to go down into the dining - room , and sit with him as he ate his deferred meal when he came in an hour or two later . In general , she preferred her easy - chair , or her corner of the sofa , upstairs in the drawing - room , though it was very rarely that she would allow Molly to avail herself of her stepmother 's neglected privilege . Molly would fain have gone down and kept her father company every night that he had these solitary meals ; but for peace and quietness she gave up her own wishes on the matter . Mrs. Gibson took a seat by the fire in the dining - room , and patiently waited for the auspicious moment when Mr. Gibson , having satisfied his healthy appetite , turned from the table , and took his place by her side . She got up , and with unaccustomed attention moved the wine and glasses so that he could help himself without moving from his chair . "

The conjugal interview had not been satisfactory to either . Mr. Gibson had been compelled to face and acknowledge the fact , that the wife he had chosen had a very different standard of conduct from that which he had upheld all his life , and had hoped to have seen inculcated in his daughter . He was more irritated than he chose to show ; for there was so much of self - reproach in his irritation that he kept it to himself , brooded over it , and allowed a feeling of suspicious dissatisfaction with his wife to grow up in his mind , which extended itself by - and - by to the innocent Cynthia , and caused his manner to both mother and daughter to assume a certain curt severity , which took the latter at any rate with extreme surprise . But on the present occasion he followed his wife up to the drawing - room , and gravely congratulated the astonished Cynthia . "

194307	194345	194282	194282	he	8992	" Mr. Gibson looked gravely at her , irresponsive to her winning looks , which at the moment reminded him too forcibly of her mother 's ways . Then he took her hand , and said , seriously enough,--"I
194385	194423	194380	194380	him	8992	" Molly felt as if she could have thanked her father aloud for this testimony to the value of him who was gone away . But Cynthia pouted a little before she smiled up in his face . "

Molly saw Cynthia 's eyes fill with tears , and followed her to the other end of the room , where she had gone to seek some working materials . "

195041	195084	195085	195085	Roger	211	" She said this in so pleading a voice , that if Mr. Gibson had not been thoroughly displeased and annoyed by his previous conversation with her mother , he must have yielded to her . As it was , he said , coldly,--"Telling

195129	195135	195127	195127	Molly	384	" said Cynthia , suddenly ; "
195157	195490	195127	195127	Molly	384	" It was a little lively French duet . Molly sang it carelessly , with heaviness at her heart ; but Cynthia sang it with spirit and apparent merriment ; only she broke down in hysterics at last , and flew upstairs to her own room . Molly , heeding nothing else -- neither her father nor Mrs. Gibson 's words -- followed her , and found the door of her bedroom locked , and for all reply to her entreaties to be allowed to come in , she heard Cynthia sobbing and crying . It was more than a week after the incidents just recorded before Mr. Gibson found himself at liberty to call on the Squire ; and he heartily hoped that long before then , Roger 's letter might have arrived from Paris , telling his father the whole story . But he saw at the first glance that the Squire had heard nothing unusual to disturb his equanimity . He was looking better than he had done for months past ; the light of hope was in his eyes , his face seemed of a healthy ruddy colour , gained partly by his resumption of outdoor employment in the superintendence of the works , and partly because the happiness he had lately had through Roger 's means , caused his blood to flow with regular vigour . He had felt Roger 's going away , it is true ; but whenever the sorrow of parting with him pressed too heavily upon him , he filled his pipe , and smoked it out over a long , slow , deliberate , re - perusal of Lord Hollingford 's letter , every word of which he knew by heart ; but expressions in which he made a pretence to himself of doubting , that he might have an excuse for looking at his son 's praises once again . The first greetings over , Mr. Gibson plunged into his subject . "

Mr. Gibson read it , hardly seeing the words after he had by one rapid glance assured himself that there was no mention of Cynthia in it . "

197407	198328	197397	197397	he	4589	" The Squire was pleased with his own speech and his own thought , and smiled a little as he finished speaking . Mr. Gibson was both pleased and amused ; and he smiled too , anxious as he was to be gone . The next Thursday was soon fixed upon as the day on which Mr. Gibson was to bring his womenkind out to the Hall . He thought that , on the whole , the interview had gone off a good deal better than he had expected , and felt rather proud of the invitation of which he was the bearer . Therefore Mrs. Gibson 's manner of receiving it was an annoyance to him . She , meanwhile , had been considering herself as an injured woman ever since the evening of the day of Roger 's departure ; what business had any one had to speak as if the chances of Osborne 's life being prolonged were infinitely small , if in fact the matter was uncertain ? She liked Osborne extremely , much better than Roger ; and would gladly have schemed to secure him for Cynthia , if she had not shrunk from the notion of her daughter 's becoming a widow . For if Mrs. Gibson had ever felt anything acutely it was the death of Mr. Kirkpatrick ; and , amiably callous as she was in most things , she recoiled from exposing her daughter wilfully to the same kind of suffering which she herself had experienced . But if she had only known Dr. Nicholls ' opinion she would never have favoured Roger 's suit ; never . And then Mr. Gibson himself ; why was he so cold and reserved in his treatment of her since that night of explanation ? She had done nothing wrong ; yet she was treated as though she were in disgrace . And everything about the house was flat just now . She even missed the little excitement of Roger 's visits , and the watching of his attentions to Cynthia . Cynthia too was silent enough ; and as for Molly , she was absolutely dull and out of spirits , a state of mind so annoying to Mrs. Gibson just now , that she vented some of her discontent upon the poor girl , from whom she feared neither complaint nor repartee . CHAPTER XXXVI . DOMESTIC DIPLOMACY . The evening of the day on which Mr. Gibson had been to see the Squire , the three women were alone in the drawing - room , for Mr. Gibson had had a long round and was not as yet come in . They had had to wait dinner for him ; and for some time after his return there was nothing done or said but what related to the necessary business of eating . Mr. Gibson was , perhaps , as well satisfied with his day 's work as any of the four ; for this visit to the Squire had been weighing on his mind ever since he had heard of the state of things between Roger and Cynthia . He did not like the having to go and tell of a love - affair so soon after he had declared his belief that no such thing existed ; it was a confession of fallibility which is distasteful to most men . If the Squire had not been of so unsuspicious and simple a nature , he might have drawn his own conclusions from the apparent concealment of facts , and felt doubtful of Mr. Gibson 's perfect honesty in the business ; but being what he was , there was no danger of such unjust misapprehension . Still Mr. Gibson knew the hot hasty temper he had to deal with , and had expected more violence of language than he really encountered ; and the last arrangement by which Cynthia , her mother , and Molly -- who , as Mr. Gibson thought to himself , and smiled at the thought , was sure to be a peacemaker , and a sweetener of intercourse -- were to go to the Hall and make acquaintance with the Squire , appeared like a great success to Mr. Gibson , for achieving which he took not a little credit to himself . Altogether , he was more cheerful and bland than he had been for many days ; and when he came up into the drawing - room for a few minutes after dinner , before going out again to see his town patients , he whistled a little under his breath , as he stood with his back to the fire , looking at Cynthia , and thinking that he had not done her justice when describing her to the Squire . Now this soft , almost tuneless whistling , was to Mr. Gibson what purring is to a cat . He could no more have done it with an anxious case on his mind , or when he was annoyed by human folly , or when he was hungry , than he could have flown through the air . Molly knew all this by instinct , and was happy without being aware of it , as soon as she heard the low whistle which was no music after all . But Mrs. Gibson did not like this trick of her husband 's ; it was not refined she thought , not even "
198331	198391	197397	197397	he	4589	" if she could have called it by this fine word it would have compensated her for the want of refinement . To - night it was particularly irritating to her nerves ; but since her conversation with Mr. Gibson about Cynthia 's engagement , she had not felt herself in a sufficiently good position to complain . Mr. Gibson began,--"Well
198412	198434	198435	198435	You	384	" Cynthia looked up quickly , questioning with her eyes ; Molly stopped her netting to listen ; no one spoke . "

She did not know why she said it , for she fully intended to go all the time ; but having said it , she was bound to stick to it for a little while ; and , with such a husband as hers , the hard necessity was sure to fall upon her of having to find a reason for her saying . Then it came , quick and sharp . "
198698	198707	198715	198715	he	4597	" said he , turning round upon her . "

198936	198960	198931	198931	you	4602	" said Mr. Gibson , provoked , but not wishing to have a long discussion , especially as he felt his temper going . "
198968	198995	198998	198998	mamma	7255	" said Mrs. Gibson , anxious for an excuse to yield . But her daughter was quite aware of this motive for the question , and replied quietly,--"Not

199016	199084	199000	199000	I	0	" said Mr. Gibson , almost ready to vow that he would never again meddle in any affair in which women were concerned , which would effectually shut him out from all love - affairs for the future . He had been touched by the Squire 's relenting , pleased with what he had thought would give others pleasure , and this was the end of it ! "
199092	199106	199109	199109	I	0	" said Molly , pleading with her eyes as well as her words . "
199134	199135	199136	199136	I	0	" "
199146	199152	199136	199136	I	0	" said Cynthia , demurely . "
199160	199268	199157	199157	mamma	167	" It was very malicious of her . She fully intended to go , and was equally sure that her mother was already planning her dress for the occasion in her own mind . Mr. Gibson , however , who , surgeon though he was , had never learnt to anatomize a woman 's heart , took it all literally , and was excessively angry both with Cynthia and her mother ; so angry that he did not dare to trust himself to speak . He went quickly to the door , intending to leave the room ; but his wife 's voice arrested him ; she said,-- "
199293	199294	199283	199283	I	0	" "
199300	199313	199283	199283	I	0	" he said , short and stern , and left the room . "
199319	199343	199315	199315	I	0	" said she , in the voice of a victim -- those words were meant for him , but he hardly heard them . "

199416	199420	199410	199410	I	0	" said Cynthia . "
199433	199636	199410	199410	I	0	" So they went on the day appointed . Mr. Gibson was aware of the change of plans , and that they were going after all ; but he was so much annoyed by the manner in which his wife had received an invitation that appeared to him so much kinder than he had expected from his previous knowledge of the Squire , and his wishes on the subject of his sons ' marriage , that Mrs. Gibson heard neither interest nor curiosity expressed by her husband as to the visit itself , or the reception they met with . Cynthia 's indifference as to whether the invitation was accepted or not had displeased Mr. Gibson . He was not up to her ways with her mother , and did not understand how much of this said indifference had been assumed in order to countervent Mrs. Gibson 's affectation and false sentiment . But for all his annoyance on the subject , he was , in fact , very curious to know how the visit had gone off , and took the first opportunity of being alone with Molly to question her about the lunch of the day before at Hamley Hall .

200012	200084	200001	200001	she	384	" said Molly , and then she stopped ; she wanted to speak in favour of Cynthia , but somehow she could form no reply that pleased her to this repeated inquiry . He did not seem much to care whether he got an answer or not , for he went on with his own thoughts , and the result was that he asked Molly if Cynthia had heard from Roger . "
200091	200092	200094	200094	she	384	" "
200120	200193	200109	200110	the Squire	7531	" Now Cynthia , rather to Molly 's surprise , had told her that she might read the letter if she liked , and Molly had shrunk from availing herself of the permission , for Roger 's sake . She thought that he would probably have poured out his heart to the one sole person , and that it was not fair to listen , as it were , to his confidences . "
200199	200204	200205	200206	The Squire	7531	" asked Mr. Gibson . "
200225	200226	200219	200221	the young fellow	3032	" "
200235	200354	200355	200355	Molly	384	" Then Molly blushed all over crimson , for it suddenly struck her that Osborne was probably with his wife -- that mysterious wife , of whose existence she was cognizant , but of whom she knew so little , and of whom her father knew nothing . Mr. Gibson noticed the blush with anxiety . What did it mean ? It was troublesome enough to find that one of the Squire 's precious sons had fallen in love within the prohibited ranks ; and what would not have to be said and done if anything fresh were to come out between Osborne and Molly ? He spoke out at once to relieve himself of this new apprehension . "
200414	200463	200403	200403	I	0	" He took her hand as he spoke . She looked up at him with clear , truthful eyes , which filled with tears as she spoke . She did not know why the tears came ; perhaps it was because she was not so strong as formerly . "
200513	200514	200508	200508	I	0	" "
200552	200602	200549	200549	her	4636	" He could not help saying this in the fulness of his heart just then , but he was surprised at the effect these few tender words produced . Molly threw her arms round his neck , and began to sob bitterly , her head lying on his shoulder . "
200607	200624	200549	200549	her	4636	" said he , patting her on the back , and leading her to the sofa , "
200678	200725	200730	200731	dear papa	1846	" he continued , holding her a little away from him that he might look in her face . She smiled at him through her tears ; and he did not see the look of sadness which returned to her face after he had left her . "
200753	200806	200811	200811	dear	7312	" Mr. Gibson knew all implied in these words , and felt that there was no effectual help for the state of things which had arisen from his own act . It was better for them both that they should not speak out more fully . So he kissed her , and said,-- "
200859	201276	201279	201279	he	4644	" His commonplace words acted like an astringent on Molly 's relaxed feelings . He intended that they should do so ; it was the truest kindness to her ; but he walked away from her with a sharp pang at his heart , which he stunned into numbness as soon as he could by throwing himself violently into the affairs and cares of others . CHAPTER XXXVII . A FLUKE , AND WHAT CAME OF IT . [ Illustration ( untitled ) ] The honour and glory of having a lover of her own was soon to fall to Molly 's share ; though , to be sure , it was a little deduction from the honour that the man who came with the full intention of proposing to her , ended by making Cynthia an offer . It was Mr. Coxe , who came back to Hollingford to follow out the purpose he had announced to Mr. Gibson nearly two years before , of inducing Molly to become his wife as soon as he should have succeeded to his uncle 's estate . He was now a rich , though still a red - haired , young man . He came to the George Inn , bringing his horses and his groom ; not that he was going to ride much , but that he thought such outward signs of his riches might help on his suit ; and he was so justly modest in his estimation of himself that he believed that he needed all extraneous aid . He piqued himself on his constancy ; and indeed , considering that he had been so much restrained by his duty , his affection , and his expectations to his crabbed old uncle , that he had not been able to go much into society , and very rarely indeed into the company of young ladies , such fidelity to Molly was very meritorious , at least in his own eyes . Mr. Gibson too was touched by it , and made it a point of honour to give him a fair field , all the time sincerely hoping that Molly would not be such a goose as to lend a willing ear to a youth who could never remember the difference between apophysis and epiphysis . He thought it as well not to tell his wife more of Mr. Coxe 's antecedents than that he had been a former pupil ; who had relinquished ( "
201283	201418	201279	201279	he	4644	" understood ) the medical profession because an old uncle had left him enough of money to be idle . Mrs. Gibson , who felt that she had somehow lost her place in her husband 's favour , took it into her head that she could reinstate herself if she was successful in finding a good match for his daughter Molly . She knew that her husband had forbidden her to try for this end , as distinctly as words could express a meaning ; but her own words so seldom expressed her meaning , or if they did , she held to her opinions so loosely , that she had no idea but that it was the same with other people . Accordingly she gave Mr. Coxe a very sweet and gracious welcome . "
201470	201491	201465	201466	Mr. Gibson	158	" Mr. Coxe felt much flattered , and took the words as a happy omen for his love - affair . "
201497	201504	201493	201494	Miss Gibson	187	" asked he , blushing violently . "
201540	201541	201547	201547	she	187	" "
201602	201740	201594	201594	I	0	" She went on saying agreeable nothings to the young man , who received her attentions with a certain complacency , but was all the time much more engaged in listening to the well - remembered click at the front door,--the shutting it to again with household care , and the sound of the familiar bounding footstep on the stair . At last they came . Cynthia entered first , bright and blooming , fresh colour in her cheeks and lips , fresh brilliance in her eyes . She looked startled at the sight of a stranger , and for an instant she stopped short at the door , as if taken by surprise . Then in came Molly softly behind her , smiling , happy , dimpled ; but not such a glowing beauty as Cynthia . "
201750	201770	201743	201744	Mr. Coxe	215	" said she , going up to him with an outstretched hand , and greeting him with simple friendliness . "
201803	202176	201797	201797	I	0	" he replied , speaking hurriedly , and holding her hand all the time , rather to her discomfiture . Then Mrs. Gibson introduced her daughter , and the two girls spoke of the enjoyment of their walk . Mr. Coxe marred his cause in that very first interview , if indeed he ever could have had any chance , by his precipitancy in showing his feelings , and Mrs. Gibson helped him to mar it by trying to assist him . Molly lost her open friendliness of manner , and began to shrink away from him in a way which he thought was a very ungrateful return for all his faithfulness to her these two years past ; and after all she was not the wonderful beauty his fancy or his love had painted her . That Miss Kirkpatrick was far more beautiful and much easier of access . For Cynthia put on all her pretty airs -- her look of intent interest in what any one was saying to her , let the subject be what it would , as if it was the thing she cared most about in the whole world ; her unspoken deference ; in short , all the unconscious ways she possessed by instinct of tickling the vanity of men . So while Molly quietly repelled him , Cynthia drew him to her by her soft attractive ways ; and his constancy fell before her charms . He was thankful that he had not gone too far with Molly , and grateful to Mr. Gibson for having prohibited all declarations two years ago ; for Cynthia , and Cynthia alone , could make him happy . After a fortnight 's time , during which he had entirely veered round in his allegiance , he thought it desirable to speak to Mr. Gibson . He did so with a certain sense of exultation in his own correct behaviour in the affair , but at the same time feeling rather ashamed of the confession of his own changeableness which was naturally involved . Now it had so happened that Mr. Gibson had been unusually little at home during the fortnight that Mr. Coxe had ostensibly lodged at the "
202179	202407	202408	202409	Mr. Gibson	158	" but in reality had spent the greater part of his time at Mr. Gibson 's house -- so that he had seen very little of his former pupil , and on the whole he had thought him improved , especially after Molly 's manner had made her father pretty sure that Mr. Coxe stood no chance in that quarter . But Mr. Gibson was quite ignorant of the attraction which Cynthia had had for the young man . If he had perceived it , he would have nipped it in the bud pretty quickly , for he had no notion of any girl , even though only partially engaged to one man , receiving offers from others , if a little plain speaking could prevent it . Mr. Coxe had asked for a private interview ; they were sitting in the old surgery , now called the consulting - room , but still retaining so much of its former self as to be the last place in which Mr. Coxe could feel himself at ease . He was red up to the very roots of his red hair , and kept turning his glossy new hat round and round in his fingers , unable to find out the proper way of beginning his sentence , so at length he plunged in , grammar or no grammar .

As soon as she had left the room , Mr. Gibson sat down , and took up a new _ Edinburgh _ lying on the table , as an excuse for conversation . Was there anything in the article that made him say , after a minute or two , to Molly , who sat silent and wondering--"Molly

Most likely she would not have returned if she had known that Mr. Gibson was still there ; but it was such an unheard - of thing for him to be sitting in that room in the middle of the day , reading or making pretence to read , that she had never thought of his remaining . He looked up at her the moment she came in , so there was nothing for it but putting a bold face on it , and going back to her work . "

206054	206410	206030	206030	Roger	211	" said Cynthia , with a pretty consciousness of her power . Molly turned away her head , and was silent ; it was of no use combating the truth , and she tried rather not to feel it -- not to feel , poor girl , that she too had a great weight on her heart , into the cause of which she shrank from examining . That whole winter long she had felt as if her sun was all shrouded over with grey mist , and could no longer shine brightly for her . She wakened up in the morning with a dull sense of something being wrong ; the world was out of joint , and , if she were born to set it right , she did not know how to do it . Blind herself as she would , she could not help perceiving that her father was not satisfied with the wife he had chosen . For a long time Molly had been surprised at his apparent contentment ; sometimes she had been unselfish enough to be glad that he was satisfied ; but still more frequently nature would have its way , and she was almost irritated at what she considered his blindness . Something , however , had changed him now : something that had arisen at the time of Cynthia 's engagement . He had become nervously sensitive to his wife 's failings , and his whole manner had grown dry and sarcastic , not merely to her , but sometimes to Cynthia,--and even -- but this very rarely , to Molly herself . He was not a man to go into passions , or ebullitions of feeling : they would have relieved him , even while degrading him in his own eyes ; but he became hard , and occasionally bitter in his speeches and ways . Molly now learnt to long after the vanished blindness in which her father had passed the first year of his marriage ; yet there were no outrageous infractions of domestic peace . Some people might say that Mr. Gibson "
206415	206423	206030	206030	Roger	211	" he told himself in more homely phrase "
206434	206679	206680	206680	I	0	" and he , from principle , avoided all actual dissensions with his wife , preferring to cut short a discussion by a sarcasm , or by leaving the room . Moreover , Mrs. Gibson had a very tolerable temper of her own , and her cat - like nature purred and delighted in smooth ways , and pleasant quietness . She had no great facility for understanding sarcasm ; it is true it disturbed her , but as she was not quick at deciphering any depth of meaning , and felt it unpleasant to think about it , she forgot it as soon as possible . Yet she saw she was often in some kind of disfavour with her husband , and it made her uneasy . She resembled Cynthia in this : she liked to be liked ; and she wanted to regain the esteem which she did not perceive she had lost for ever . Molly sometimes took her stepmother 's part in secret ; she felt as if she herself could never have borne her father 's hard speeches so patiently ; they would have cut her to the heart , and she must either have demanded an explanation , and probed the sore to the bottom , or sat down despairing and miserable . Instead of which Mrs. Gibson , after her husband had left the room , on these occasions would say in a manner more bewildered than hurt-- "
206726	207243	207245	207245	he	4722	" And thus she went on , groping about to find the means of reinstating herself in his good graces -- really trying , according to her lights , till Molly was often compelled to pity her in spite of herself , and although she saw that her stepmother was the cause of her father 's increased astringency of disposition . For , indeed , he had got into that kind of exaggerated susceptibility with regard to his wife 's faults , which may be best typified by the state of bodily irritation that is produced by the constant recurrence of any particular noise : those who are brought within hearing of it , are apt to be always on the watch for the repetition , if they are once made to notice it , and are in an irritable state of nerves . So that poor Molly had not passed a cheerful winter , independently of any private sorrows that she might have in her own heart . She did not look well , either : she was gradually falling into low health , rather than bad health . Her heart beat more feebly and slower ; the vivifying stimulant of hope -- even unacknowledged hope -- was gone out of her life . It seemed as if there was not , and never could be in this world , any help for the dumb discordancy between her father and his wife . Day after day , month after month , year after year , would Molly have to sympathize with her father , and pity her stepmother , feeling acutely for both , and certainly more than Mrs. Gibson felt for herself . Molly could not imagine how she had at one time wished for her father 's eyes to be opened , and how she could ever have fancied that if they were , he would be able to change things in Mrs. Gibson 's character . It was all hopeless , and the only attempt at a remedy was to think about it as little as possible . Then Cynthia 's ways and manners about Roger gave Molly a great deal of uneasiness . She did not believe that Cynthia cared enough for him ; at any rate , not with the sort of love that she herself would have bestowed , if she had been so happy -- no , that was not it -- if she had been in Cynthia 's place . She felt as if she should have gone to him both hands held out , full and brimming over with tenderness , and been grateful for every word of precious confidence bestowed on her . Yet Cynthia received his letters with a kind of carelessness , and read them with a strange indifference , while Molly sat at her feet , so to speak , looking up with eyes as wistful as a dog 's waiting for crumbs , and such chance beneficences . She tried to be patient on these occasions , but at last she must ask--"Where
207254	207287	207251	207251	he	4722	" By this time Cynthia had put down the letter on the table by her , smiling a little from time to time , as she remembered the loving compliments it contained . "

She saw references made to books , which , with a little trouble , would be accessible to her here in Hollingford . Perhaps the details and the references would make the letter dull and dry to some people , but not to her , thanks to his former teaching and the interest he had excited in her for his pursuits . But , as he said in apology , what had he to write about in that savage land , but his love , and his researches , and travels ? There was no society , no gaiety , no new books to write about , no gossip in Abyssinian wilds . Molly was not in strong health , and perhaps this made her a little fanciful ; but certain it is that her thoughts by day and her dreams by night were haunted by the idea of Roger lying ill and untended in those savage lands . Her constant prayer , "
208022	208041	208010	208010	her	4734	" came from a heart as true as that of the real mother in King Solomon 's judgment . "
208092	208998	208090	208090	God	348	" And then she would burst into tears , and drop asleep at last , sobbing . CHAPTER XXXVIII . MR . KIRKPATRICK , Q.C. Cynthia was always the same with Molly : kind , sweet - tempered , ready to help , professing a great deal of love for her , and probably feeling as much as she did for any one in the world . But Molly had reached to this superficial depth of affection and intimacy in the first few weeks of Cynthia 's residence in her father 's house ; and if she had been of a nature prone to analyse the character of one whom she loved dearly , she might have perceived that , with all Cynthia 's apparent frankness , there were certain limits beyond which her confidence did not go ; where her reserve began , and her real self was shrouded in mystery . For instance , her relations with Mr. Preston were often very puzzling to Molly . She was sure that there had been a much greater intimacy between them formerly at Ashcombe , and that the remembrance of this was often very galling and irritating to Cynthia , who was as evidently desirous of forgetting it as he was anxious to make her remember it . But why this intimacy had ceased , why Cynthia disliked him so extremely now , and many other unexplained circumstances connected with these two facts , were Cynthia 's secrets ; and she effectually baffled all Molly 's innocent attempts during the first glow of her friendship for Cynthia , to learn the girlish antecedents of her companion 's life . Every now and then Molly came to a dead wall , beyond which she could not pass -- at least with the delicate instruments which were all she chose to use . Perhaps Cynthia might have told all there was to tell to a more forcible curiosity , which knew how to improve every slip of the tongue and every fit of temper to its own gratification . But Molly 's was the interest of affection , not the coarser desire of knowing everything for a little excitement ; and as soon as she saw that Cynthia did not wish to tell her anything about that period of her life , Molly left off referring to it . But if Cynthia had preserved a sweet tranquillity of manner and an unvarying kindness for Molly during the winter of which there is question , at present she was the only person to whom the beauty 's ways were unchanged . Mr. Gibson 's influence had been good for her as long as she saw that he liked her ; she had tried to keep as high a place in his good opinion as she could , and had curbed many a little sarcasm against her mother , and many a twisting of the absolute truth when he was by . Now there was a constant uneasiness about her which made her more cowardly than before ; and even her partisan , Molly , could not help being aware of the distinct equivocations she occasionally used when anything in Mr. Gibson 's words or behaviour pressed her too hard . Her repartees to her mother were less frequent than they had been , but there was often the unusual phenomenon of pettishness in her behaviour to her . These changes in humour and disposition , here described all at once , were in themselves a series of delicate alterations of relative conduct spread over many months -- many winter months of long evenings and bad weather , which bring out discords of character , as a dash of cold water brings out the fading colours of an old fresco . During much of this time Mr. Preston had been at Ashcombe ; for Lord Cumnor had not been able to find an agent whom he liked to replace Mr. Preston ; and while the inferior situation remained vacant Mr. Preston had undertaken to do the duties of both . Mrs. Goodenough had had a serious illness ; and the little society at Hollingford did not care to meet while one of their habitual set was scarcely out of danger . So there had been very little visiting ; and though Miss Browning said that the absence of the temptations of society was very agreeable to cultivated minds , after the dissipations of the previous autumn , when there were parties every week to welcome Mr. Preston , yet Miss Phoebe let out in confidence that she and her sister had fallen into the habit of going to bed at nine o'clock , for they found cribbage night after night , from five o'clock till ten , rather too much of a good thing . To tell the truth , that winter , if peaceful , was monotonous in Hollingford ; and the whole circle of gentility there was delighted to be stirred up in March by the intelligence that Mr. Kirkpatrick , the newly - made Q.C. , was coming on a visit for a couple of days to his sister - in - law , Mrs. Gibson . Mrs. Goodenough 's room was the very centre of gossip ; gossip had been her daily bread through her life , gossip was meat and wine to her now . "

Mr. Kirkpatrick had been , like many other men , struggling on in his profession , and encumbered with a large family of his own ; he was ready to do a good turn for his connections , if it occasioned him no loss of time , and if ( which was , perhaps , a primary condition ) he remembered their existence . Cynthia 's visit to Doughty Street nine or ten years ago had not made much impression upon him after he had once suggested its feasibility to his good - natured wife . He was even rather startled every now and then by the appearance of a pretty little girl amongst his own children , as they trooped in to dessert , and had to remind himself who she was . But as it was his custom to leave the table almost immediately and to retreat into a small back - room called his study , to immerse himself in papers for the rest of the evening , the child had not made much impression upon him ; and probably the next time he remembered her existence was when Mrs. Kirkpatrick wrote to him to beg him to receive Cynthia for a night on her way to school at Boulogne . The same request was repeated on her return ; but it so happened that he had not seen her either time ; and only dimly remembered some remarks which his wife had made on one of these occasions , that it seemed to her rather hazardous to send so young a girl so long a journey without making more provision for her safety than Mrs. Kirkpatrick had done . He knew that his wife would fill up all deficiencies in this respect as if Cynthia had been her own daughter ; and thought no more about her until he received an invitation to attend Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's wedding with Mr. Gibson , the highly - esteemed surgeon of Hollingford , & amp;c . & amp;c.--an attention which irritated instead of pleasing him .

210932	211808	210928	210928	She	8908	" said he , meditatively -- such ignorance was possible . But now the great case of Houghton _ v. _ Houghton was a thing of the past ; the hard struggle was over , the comparative table - land of Q. C.-dom gained , and Mr. Kirkpatrick had leisure for family feeling and recollection . One day in the Easter vacation he found himself near Hollingford ; he had a Sunday to spare , and he wrote to offer himself as a visitor to the Gibsons from Friday till Monday , expressing strongly ( what he really felt , in a less degree , ) his wish to make Mr. Gibson 's acquaintance . Mr. Gibson , though often overwhelmed with professional business , was always hospitable ; and moreover , it was always a pleasure to him to get out of the somewhat confined mental atmosphere which he had breathed over and over again , and have a whiff of fresh air : a glimpse of what was passing in the great world beyond his daily limits of thought and action . So he was ready to give a cordial welcome to his unknown relation . Mrs. Gibson was in a flutter of sentimental delight , which she fancied was family affection , but which might not have been quite so effervescent if Mr. Kirkpatrick had remained in his former position of struggling lawyer , with seven children , living in Doughty Street . When the two gentlemen met they were attracted towards each other by a similarity of character , with just enough difference in their opinions to make the experience of each , on which such opinions were based , valuable to the other . To Mrs. Gibson , although the bond between them counted for very little in their intercourse , Mr. Kirkpatrick paid very polite attention ; and was , in fact , very glad that she had done so well for herself as to marry a sensible and agreeable man , who was able to keep her in comfort , and to behave to her daughter in so liberal a manner . Molly struck him as a delicate - looking girl , who might be very pretty if she had a greater look of health and animation : indeed , looking at her critically , there were beautiful points about her face -- long soft grey eyes , black curling eyelashes , rarely - showing dimples , perfect teeth ; but there was a languor over all , a slow depression of manner , which contrasted unfavourably with the brightly - coloured Cynthia , sparkling , quick , graceful , and witty . As Mr. Kirkpatrick expressed it afterwards to his wife , he was quite in love with that girl ; and Cynthia , as ready to captivate strangers as any little girl of three or four , rose to the occasion , forgot all her cares and despondencies , remembered no longer her regret at having lost something of Mr. Gibson 's good opinion , and listened eagerly and made soft replies , intermixed with nave sallies of droll humour , till Mr. Kirkpatrick was quite captivated . He left Hollingford , almost surprised to have performed a duty , and found it a pleasure . For Mrs. Gibson and Molly he had a general friendly feeling ; but he did not care if he never saw them again . But for Mr. Gibson he had a warm respect , a strong personal liking , which he should be glad to have ripen into a friendship , if there was time for it in this bustling world . And he fully resolved to see more of Cynthia ; his wife must know her ; they must have her up to stay with them in London , and show her something of the world . But , on returning home , Mr. Kirkpatrick found so much work awaiting him that he had to lock up embryo friendships and kindly plans in some safe closet of his mind , and give himself up , body and soul , to the immediate work of his profession . But , in May , he found time to take his wife to the Academy Exhibition , and some portrait there striking him as being like Cynthia , he told his wife more about her and his visit to Hollingford than he had ever had leisure to do before ; and the result was that on the next day a letter was sent off to Mrs. Gibson , inviting Cynthia to pay a visit to her cousins in London , and reminding her of many little circumstances that had occurred when she was with them as a child , so as to carry on the clue of friendship from that time to the present . On its receipt , this letter was greeted in various ways by the four people who sate round the breakfast - table . Mrs. Gibson read it to herself first . Then , without telling what its contents were , so that her auditors were quite in the dark as to what her remarks applied , she said,-- "
211867	211908	211910	211910	you	4798	" She said all this in a plaintive , aggrieved tone of voice ; but as no one knew to what she was referring , it was difficult to offer her consolation . Her husband was the first to speak . "

213365	213574	213363	213363	Molly	384	" Molly had left the room before this speech was ended , and Mr. Gibson was occupied with his newspaper ; but Mrs. Gibson finished it to herself very much to her own satisfaction ; for , after all , it was better to have some one of the family going on the visit , though she might not be the right person , than to refuse it altogether , and never to have the opportunity of saying anything about it . As Mr. Gibson was so kind to Cynthia , she too would be kind to Molly , and dress her becomingly , and invite young men to the house ; do all the things , in fact , which Molly and her father did not want to have done , and throw the old stumbling - blocks in the way of their unrestrained intercourse , which was the one thing they desired to have , free and open , and without the constant dread of her jealousy .

She had been wishing downstairs that Cynthia would be less reserved , and not have so many secrets ; but now it seemed almost like treason to have wanted her to be anything but what she was . Never had any one more than Cynthia the power spoken of by Goldsmith when he wrote-- He threw off his friends like a huntsman his pack , For he knew when he liked he could whistle them back . "

At present , however , she confined herself to the practical matter in hand ; and the genius for millinery and dress , inherent in both mother and daughter , soon settled a great many knotty points of contrivance and taste , and then they all three set to work to "
215644	215705	215706	215706	She	4870	" Cynthia 's relations with the Squire had been very stationary ever since the visit she had paid to the Hall the previous autumn . He had received them all at that time with hospitable politeness , and he had been more charmed with Cynthia than he liked to acknowledge to himself when he thought the visit all over afterwards . "
215715	215719	215708	215710	a pretty lass	4871	" thought he , "
216004	216165	215996	215996	he	7648	" So although the Squire was always delighted to receive the little notes which Cynthia sent him every time she heard from Roger , and although this attention on her part was melting the heart he tried to harden , he controlled himself into writing her the briefest acknowledgments . His words were strong in meaning , but formal in expression ; she herself did not think much about them , being satisfied to do the kind actions that called them forth . But her mother criticised them and pondered them . She thought she had hit on the truth when she decided in her own mind that it was a very old - fashioned style , and that he and his house and his furniture all wanted some of the brightening up and polishing which they were sure to receive , when -- she never quite liked to finish the sentence definitely , although she kept repeating to herself that "
216173	216423	215996	215996	he	7648	" To return to the Squire . Occupied as he now was , he recovered his former health , and something of his former cheerfulness . If Osborne had met him half - way , it is probable that the old bond between father and son might have been renewed ; but Osborne either was really an invalid , or had sunk into invalid habits , and made no effort to rally . If his father urged him to go out -- nay , once or twice he gulped down his pride , and asked Osborne to accompany him -- Osborne would go to the window and find out some flaw or speck in the wind or weather , and make that an excuse for stopping in - doors over his books . He would saunter out on the sunny side of the house in a manner that the Squire considered as both indolent and unmanly . Yet if there was a prospect of his leaving home , which he did pretty often about this time , he was seized with a hectic energy : the clouds in the sky , the easterly wind , the dampness of the air , were nothing to him then ; and as the Squire did not know the real secret cause of this anxiety to be gone , he took it into his head that it arose from Osborne 's dislike to Hamley and to the monotony of his father 's society . "
216429	216434	216435	216435	I	0	" thought the Squire . "
216682	217205	217206	217206	Osborne	213	" It is possible that Osborne might have been induced to tell his father of his marriage during their long solitary intercourse , if the Squire , in an unlucky moment , had not given him his confidence about Roger 's engagement with Cynthia . It was on one wet Sunday afternoon , when the father and son were sitting together in the large empty drawing - room . Osborne had not been to church in the morning ; the Squire had , and he was now trying hard to read one of Blair 's sermons . They had dined early ; they always did on Sundays ; and either that , or the sermon , or the hopeless wetness of the day , made the afternoon seem interminably long to the Squire . He had certain unwritten rules for the regulation of his conduct on Sundays . Cold meat , sermon - reading , no smoking till after evening prayers , as little thought as possible as to the state of the land and the condition of the crops , and as much respectable sitting in - doors in his best clothes as was consistent with going to church twice a day , and saying the responses louder than the clerk . To - day it had rained so unceasingly that he had remitted the afternoon church ; but oh , even with the luxury of a nap , how long it seemed before he saw the Hall servants trudging homewards , along the field - path , a covey of umbrellas ! He had been standing at the window for the last half - hour , his hands in his pockets , and his mouth often contracting itself into the traditional sin of a whistle , but as often checked into sudden gravity -- ending , nine times out of ten , in a yawn . He looked askance at Osborne , who was sitting near the fire absorbed in a book . The poor Squire was something like the little boy in the child 's story , who asks all sorts of birds and beasts to come and play with him ; and , in every case , receives the sober answer , that they are too busy to have leisure for trivial amusements . The father wanted the son to put down his book , and talk to him : it was so wet , so dull , and a little conversation would so wile away the time ! But Osborne , with his back to the window where his father was standing , saw nothing of all this , and went on reading . He had assented to his father 's remark that it was a very wet afternoon , but had not carried on the subject into all the varieties of truisms of which it was susceptible . Something more rousing must be started , and this the Squire felt . The recollection of the affair between Roger and Cynthia came into his head , and , without giving it a moment 's consideration , he began,-- "

218498	218885	218887	218887	I	0	" But after his father had left the room Osborne did not take up his book again . He laid it down on the table by him , leant back in his chair , and covered his eyes with his hand . He was in a state of health which made him despondent about many things , though , least of all , about what was most in danger . The long concealment of his marriage from his father made the disclosure of it far , far more difficult than it would have been at first . Unsupported by Roger , how could he explain it all to one so passionate as the Squire ? how tell of the temptation , the stolen marriage , the consequent happiness , and alas ! the consequent suffering?--for Osborne had suffered , and did suffer , greatly in the untoward circumstances in which he had placed himself . He saw no way out of it all , excepting by the one strong stroke of which he felt himself incapable . So with a heavy heart he addressed himself to his book again . Everything seemed to come in his way , and he was not strong enough in character to overcome obstacles . The only overt step he took in consequence of what he had heard from his father , was to ride over to Hollingford the first fine day after he had received the news , and go to see Cynthia and the Gibsons . He had not been there for a long time ; bad weather and languor combined had prevented him . He found them full of preparations and discussions about Cynthia 's visit to London ; and she herself not at all in the sentimental mood proper to respond to his delicate intimations of how glad he was in his brother 's joy . Indeed , it was so long after the time , that Cynthia scarcely perceived that to him the intelligence was recent , and that the first bloom of his emotions had not yet passed away . With her head a little on one side , she was contemplating the effect of a knot of ribbons , when he began , in a low whisper , and leaning forward towards her as he spoke,--"Cynthia
218917	218918	218922	218922	you	0	" "
218925	218975	218922	218922	you	0	" She had her suspicions ; but she was annoyed to think that from one person her secret was passing to another and another , till , in fact , it was becoming no secret at all . Still , Cynthia could always conceal her annoyance when she chose . "

219010	219077	219007	219007	you	0	" This light way of taking his tender congratulation did not quite please Osborne , who was in a sentimental mood , and for a minute or so he remained silent . Then , having finished making her bow of ribbon , she turned to him , and continued in a quick low voice , anxious to take advantage of a conversation between her mother and Molly,-- "
219194	219316	219317	219317	You	4944	" And then she plunged into the talk of the other two , making the conversation general . Osborne was rather discomfited at the non - success of his congratulations ; he had pictured to himself the unbosoming of a love - sick girl , full of rapture , and glad of a sympathizing confidant . He little knew Cynthia 's nature . The more she suspected that she was called upon for a display of emotion , the less would she show ; and her emotions were generally under the control of her will . He had made an effort to come and see her ; and now he leant back in his chair , weary and a little dispirited . "

That was the way in which Mrs. Gibson first broached her intention of accompanying Cynthia up to London for a few days ' visit . She had a trick of producing the first sketch of any new plan before an outsider to the family circle ; so that the first emotions of others , if they disapproved of her projects , had to be repressed , until the idea had become familiar to them . To Molly it seemed too charming a proposal ever to come to pass . She had never allowed herself to recognize the restraint she was under in her stepmother 's presence ; but all at once she found it out when her heart danced at the idea of three whole days -- for that it would be at the least -- of perfect freedom of intercourse with her father ; of old times come back again ; of meals without perpetual fidgetiness after details of ceremony and correctness of attendance . "

221579	221732	221559	221559	I	0	" all Molly 's wishes came to pass ; there was only one little drawback to this week of holiday and happy intercourse with her father . Everybody would ask them out to tea . They were quite like bride and bridegroom ; for the fact was , that the late dinners which Mrs. Gibson had introduced into her own house , were a great inconvenience in the calculations of the small tea - drinkings at Hollingford . How ask people to tea at six , who dined at that hour ? How , when they refused cake and sandwiches at half - past eight , how induce other people who were really hungry to commit a vulgarity before those calm and scornful eyes ? So there had been a great lull of invitations for the Gibsons to Hollingford tea - parties . Mrs. Gibson , whose object was to squeeze herself into "
221736	222152	221559	221559	I	0	" had taken this being left out of the smaller festivities with great equanimity ; but Molly missed the kind homeliness of the parties to which she had gone from time to time as long as she could remember ; and though , as each three - cornered note was brought in , she grumbled a little over the loss of another charming evening with her father , she really was glad to go again in the old way among old friends . Miss Browning and Miss Phoebe were especially compassionate towards her in her loneliness . If they had had their will she would have dined there every day ; and she had to call upon them very frequently in order to prevent their being hurt at her declining the dinners . Mrs. Gibson wrote twice during her week 's absence to her husband . That piece of news was quite satisfactory to the Miss Brownings , who had of late held themselves a great deal aloof from a house where they chose to suppose that their presence was not wanted . In their winter evenings they had often talked over Mr. Gibson 's household , and having little besides conjecture to go upon , they found the subject interminable , as they could vary the possibilities every day . One of their wonders was how Mr. and Mrs. Gibson really got on together ; another was whether Mrs. Gibson was extravagant or not . Now two letters during the week of her absence showed what was in those days considered a very proper amount of conjugal affection . Yet not too much -- at elevenpence - halfpenny postage . A third letter would have been extravagant . Sister looked to sister with an approving nod as Molly named the second letter , which arrived in Hollingford the very day before Mrs. Gibson was to return . They had settled between themselves that two letters would show the right amount of good feeling and proper understanding in the Gibson family : more would have been extravagant ; only one would have been a mere matter of duty . There had been rather a question between Miss Browning and Miss Phoebe as to which person the second letter ( supposing it came ) was to be addressed to . It would be very conjugal to write twice to Mr. Gibson ; and yet it would be very pretty if Molly came in for her share . "

They were not likely to hear from him for a month at least , and before that time had elapsed Cynthia would be at home again . Molly learnt to long for her return before a fortnight of her absence was over . She had had no idea that perpetual tte--ttes with Mrs. Gibson could , by any possibility , be so tiresome as she found them . Perhaps Molly 's state of delicate health , consequent upon her rapid growth during the last few months , made her irritable ; but really often she had to get up and leave the room to calm herself down after listening to a long series of words , more frequently plaintive or discontented in tone than cheerful , and which at the end conveyed no distinct impression of either the speaker 's thought or feeling . Whenever anything had gone wrong , whenever Mr. Gibson had coolly persevered in anything to which she had objected ; whenever the cook had made a mistake about the dinner , or the housemaid broken any little frangible article ; whenever Molly 's hair was not done to her liking , or her dress did not become her , or the smell of dinner pervaded the house , or the wrong callers came , or the right callers did not come -- in fact , whenever anything went wrong , poor Mr. Kirkpatrick was regretted and mourned over , nay , almost blamed , as if , had he only given himself the trouble of living , he could have helped it .

225433	225573	225574	225575	Mrs. Green	447	" said Molly , sudden tears coming into her eyes as a recollection came before her like a picture seen long ago and forgotten for years -- a young mother washing and dressing her little girl ; placing the half - naked darling on her knee , and twining the wet rings of dark hair fondly round her fingers , and then , in an ecstasy of fondness , kissing the little curly head . The receipt of Cynthia 's letters made very agreeable events . She did not write often , but her letters were tolerably long when they did come , and very sprightly in tone . There was constant mention made of many new names , which conveyed no idea to Molly , though Mrs. Gibson would try and enlighten her by running commentaries like the following:-- "
225740	226194	225731	225731	Coleman	451	" No more news of Roger until some time after Cynthia had returned from her London visit . She came back looking fresher and prettier than ever , beautifully dressed , thanks to her own good taste , and her cousin 's generosity , full of amusing details of the gay life she had been enjoying , yet not at all out of spirits at having left it behind her . She brought home all sorts of pretty and dainty devices for Molly ; a neck - ribbon made up in the newest fashion , a pattern for a tippet , a delicate pair of light gloves , embroidered as Molly had never seen gloves embroidered before , and many another little sign of remembrance during her absence . Yet somehow or other , Molly felt that Cynthia was changed in her relation to her . Molly was aware that she had never had Cynthia 's full confidence , for with all her apparent frankness and _ navet _ of manner , Cynthia was extremely reserved and reticent . She knew this much of herself , and had often laughed about it to Molly , and the latter had by this time found out the truth of her friend 's assertion . But Molly did not trouble herself much about it . She too knew that there were many thoughts and feelings that flitted through her mind which she should never think of telling to any one , except perhaps -- if they were ever very much thrown together -- to her father . She knew that Cynthia withheld from her more than thoughts and feelings -- that she withheld facts . But then , as Molly reflected , these facts might involve details of struggle and suffering -- might relate to her mother 's neglect -- and altogether be of so painful a character , that it would be well if Cynthia could forget her childhood altogether , instead of fixing it in her mind by the relation of her grievances and troubles . So it was not now by any want of confidence that Molly felt distanced as it were . It was because Cynthia rather avoided than sought her companionship ; because her eyes shunned the straight , serious , loving look of Molly 's ; because there were certain subjects on which she evidently disliked speaking , not particularly interesting things as far as Molly could perceive , but it almost seemed as if they lay on the road to points to be avoided . Molly felt a sort of sighing pleasure in noticing Cynthia 's changed manner of talking about Roger . She spoke of him tenderly now ; "
226198	226354	226196	226196	Roger	211	" as she called him ; and Molly thought that she must be referring to the illness which he had mentioned in his last letter . One morning in the first week after Cynthia 's return home , just as he was going out , Mr. Gibson ran up into the drawing - room , hat on , booted and spurred , and hastily laid an open pamphlet down before her ; pointing out a particular passage with his finger , but not speaking a word before he rapidly quitted the room . His eyes were sparkling , and had an amused as well as pleased expression . All this Molly noticed , as well as Cynthia 's flush of colour as she read what was thus pointed out to her . Then she pushed it a little on one side , not closing the book , however , and went on with her work . "
226364	226392	226360	226360	I	0	" asked Molly , stretching out her hand for the pamphlet , which lay within her reach . But she did not take it until Cynthia had said-- "

226432	226443	226445	226445	you	265	" said Molly , catching her breath as she read , "

The reading of this letter had been received with the greatest interest , and several subsequent speakers had paid the writer very high compliments . But Molly might have known Cynthia better than to expect an answer responsive to the feelings that prompted her question . Let Cynthia be ever so proud , ever so glad , or so grateful , or even indignant , remorseful , grieved or sorry , the very fact that she was expected by another to entertain any of these emotions , would have been enough to prevent her expressing them .

Cynthia seemed to forget her tears and her troubles , and to throw her whole soul into millinery . Cynthia 's correspondence went on pretty briskly with her London cousins , according to the usual rate of correspondence in those days . Indeed , Mrs. Gibson was occasionally inclined to complain of the frequency of Helen Kirkpatrick 's letters ; for before the penny post came in , the recipient had to pay the postage of letters ; and eleven - pence - halfpenny three times a week came , according to Mrs. Gibson 's mode of reckoning when annoyed , to a sum "
227607	227637	227401	227401	Molly	221	" But these complaints were only for the family ; they saw the wrong side of the tapestry . Hollingford in general , Miss Brownings in particular , heard of "

For she had got many of her notions of the metropolis from the British Essayists , where town is so often represented as the centre of dissipation , corrupting country wives and squires ' daughters , and unfitting them for all their duties by the constant whirl of its not always innocent pleasures . London was a sort of moral pitch , which few could touch and not be defiled . Miss Browning had been on the watch for the signs of deterioration in Cynthia 's character ever since her return home . But , except in a greater number of pretty and becoming articles of dress , there was no great change for the worse to be perceived . Cynthia had been "

Miss Browning , in her secret heart , meant it as a warning against the intimacy she believed that Molly had formed with Mr. Preston ; but as it happened that Molly had never dreamed of any such intimacy , the girl could not imagine why such severity of speech should be addressed to her . Mrs. Gibson , who always took up the points of every word or action where they touched her own self ( and called it sensitiveness ) , broke the silence that followed Miss Browning 's speech by saying , plaintively,-- "

229958	229992	229993	229993	Molly	221	" Mrs. Gibson was always kind to poor people , and she immediately got up and went to her stores to search for the article wanted . Cynthia turned quietly round to Molly . "
230032	230280	230018	230018	I	0	" Mrs. Gibson came back at this moment , and Molly had to stop short again on the brink of Cynthia 's confidence ; uncertain indeed this time , whether she would have been told anything more , and only sure that she had annoyed Cynthia a good deal . But the time was approaching when she would know all . CHAPTER XLII . THE STORM BURSTS . The autumn drifted away through all its seasons . The golden corn - harvest , the walks through the stubble - fields , and rambles into hazel - copses in search of nuts ; the stripping of the apple - orchards of their ruddy fruit , amid the joyous cries and shouts of watching children ; and the gorgeous tulip - like colouring of the later time had now come on with the shortening days . There was comparative silence in the land , excepting for the distant shots , and the whirr of the partridges as they rose up from the field . Ever since Miss Browning 's unlucky conversation , things had been ajar in the Gibsons ' house . Cynthia seemed to keep every one out at ( mental ) arms'-length ; and particularly avoided any private talks with Molly . Mrs. Gibson , still cherishing a grudge against Miss Browning for her implied accusation of not looking enough after Molly , chose to exercise a most wearying supervision over the poor girl . It was , "

230324	230613	230292	230292	you	5149	" just as if Molly had really been detected in carrying on some underhand intercourse . She answered every question asked of her with the simple truthfulness of perfect innocence ; but the inquiries ( although she read their motive , and knew that they arose from no especial suspicion of her conduct , but only that Mrs. Gibson might be able to say that she looked well after her stepdaughter ) chafed her inexpressibly . Very often she did not go out at all , sooner than have to give a plan of her intended proceedings , when perhaps she had no plan at all,--only thought of wandering out at her own sweet will , and of taking pleasure in the bright solemn fading of the year . It was a very heavy time for Molly,--zest and life had fled , and left so many of the old delights mere shells of seeming . She thought it was that her youth had fled ; at nineteen ! Cynthia was no longer the same , somehow : and perhaps Cynthia 's change would injure her in the distant Roger 's opinion . Her stepmother seemed almost kind in comparison with Cynthia 's withdrawal of her heart ; Mrs. Gibson worried her , to be sure , with all these forms of watching over her ; but in all her other ways , she , at any rate , was the same . Yet Cynthia herself seemed anxious and care - worn , though she would not speak of her anxieties to Molly . And then the poor girl in her goodness would blame herself for feeling Cynthia 's change of manner ; for as Molly said to herself , "

Her bonnet and cloak were on in two minutes , and she was sitting by her father 's side , the back seat shut up , and the light weight going swiftly and merrily bumping over the stone - paved lanes .

The woods were golden ; the old house of purple - red brick , with its twisted chimneys , rose up from among them facing on to green lawns , and a placid lake ; beyond again were the Malvern Hills . "
231125	231479	231108	231108	You	5161	" To get to Croston Heath , Molly had to go down a narrow lane overshadowed by trees , with picturesque old cottages dotted here and there on the steep sandy banks ; and then there came a small wood , and then there was a brook to be crossed on a plank - bridge , and up the steeper fields on the opposite side were cut steps in the turfy path ; these ended , she was on Croston Heath , a wide - stretching common skirted by labourers ' dwellings , past which a near road to Hollingford lay . The loneliest part of the road was the first -- the lane , the wood , the little bridge , and the clambering through the upland fields . But Molly cared little for loneliness . She went along the lane under the over - arching elm - branches , from which , here and there , a yellow leaf came floating down upon her very dress ; past the last cottage where a little child had tumbled down the sloping bank , and was publishing the accident with frightened cries . Molly stooped to pick it up , and taking it in her arms in a manner which caused intense surprise to take the place of alarm in its little breast , she carried it up the rough flag steps towards the cottage which she supposed to be its home . The mother came running in from the garden behind the house , still holding the late damsons she had been gathering in her apron ; but , on seeing her , the little creature held out its arms to go to her , and she dropped her damsons all about as she took it , and began to soothe it as it cried afresh , interspersing her lulling with thanks to Molly . She called her by her name ; and on Molly asking the woman how she came to know it , she replied that before her marriage she had been a servant of Mrs. Goodenough , and so was "
231490	231687	231690	231690	Molly	221	" After the exchange of two or three more words , Molly ran down into the lane , and pursued her way , stopping here and there to gather a nosegay of such leaves as struck her for their brilliant colouring . She entered the wood . As she turned a corner in the lonely path , she heard a passionate voice of distress ; and in an instant she recognized Cynthia 's tones . She stood still and looked around . There were some thick holly - bushes shining out dark green in the midst of the amber and scarlet foliage . If any one was there , it must be behind these thick bushes . So Molly left the path , and went straight , plunging through the brown tangled growth of ferns and underwood , and turned the holly bushes . There stood Mr. Preston and Cynthia ; he holding her hands tight , each looking as if just silenced in some vehement talk by the rustle of Molly 's footsteps . [ Illustration : THERE STOOD MR . PRESTON AND CYNTHIA . ] For an instant no one spoke . Then Cynthia said,-- "
231700	231783	231692	231692	Molly	221	" Mr. Preston let go Cynthia 's hands slowly , with a look that was more of a sneer than a smile ; and yet he , too , had been strongly agitated , whatever was the subject in dispute . Molly came forward and took Cynthia 's arm , her eyes steadily fixed on Mr. Preston 's face . It was fine to see the fearlessness of her perfect innocence . He could not bear her look , and said to Cynthia,-- "

233419	233495	233408	233408	You	221	" he said . They were nearly on the common now , close to the protection of the cottages , in very hearing of their inmates ; if neither of the other two thought of this , Molly did , and resolved in her mind to call in at one of them , and ask for the labourer 's protection home ; at any rate his presence must put a stop to this miserable altercation . "
233517	233575	233576	233576	Molly	221	" cried Cynthia , unable to contain her words . He bowed and turned back , vanishing rapidly down the field staircase . At any rate that was a relief . Yet the two girls hastened on , as if he was still pursuing them . Once , when Molly said something to Cynthia , the latter replied-- "
233643	234715	234716	234716	You	5198	" So Molly did not say another word till they reached home ; and then , comparatively at ease , inasmuch as no one perceived how late was their return to the house , each of the girls went up into their separate rooms , to rest and calm themselves before dressing for the necessary family gathering at dinner . Molly felt as if she were so miserably shaken that she could not have gone down at all , if her own interests only had been at stake . She sate by her dressing - table , holding her head in her hands , her candles unlighted , and the room in soft darkness , trying to still her beating heart , and to recall all she had heard , and what would be its bearing on the lives of those whom she loved . Roger . Oh , Roger!--far away in mysterious darkness of distance -- loving as he did ( ah , that was love ! that was the love to which Cynthia had referred , as worthy of the name ! ) and the object of his love claimed by another -- false to one she must be ! How could it be ? What would he think and feel if ever he came to know it ? It was of no use trying to imagine his pain -- that could do no good . What lay before Molly was , to try and extricate Cynthia , if she could help her by thought , or advice , or action ; not to weaken herself by letting her fancy run into pictures of possible , probable suffering . When she went into the drawing - room before dinner , she found Cynthia and her mother by themselves . There were candles in the room , but they were not lighted , for the wood - fire blazed merrily if fitfully , and they were awaiting Mr. Gibson 's return , which might be expected at any minute . Cynthia sate in the shade , so it was only by her sensitive ear that Molly could judge of her state of composure . Mrs. Gibson was telling some of her day 's adventures -- whom she had found at home in the calls she had been making ; who had been out ; and the small pieces of news she had heard . To Molly 's quick sympathy Cynthia 's voice sounded languid and weary , but she made all the proper replies , and expressed the proper interest at the right places , and Molly came to the rescue , chiming in , with an effort , it is true ; but Mrs. Gibson was not one to notice slight shades or differences in manner . When Mr. Gibson returned , the relative positions of the parties were altered . It was Cynthia now who raised herself into liveliness , partly from a consciousness that he would have noticed any depression , and partly because Cynthia was one of those natural coquettes , who , from their cradle to their grave , instinctively bring out all their prettiest airs and graces in order to stand well with any man , young or old , who may happen to be present . She listened to his remarks and stories with all the sweet intentness of happier days , till Molly , silent and wondering , could hardly believe that the Cynthia before her was the same girl as she who was sobbing and crying as if her heart would break , but two hours before . It is true she looked pale and heavy - eyed , but that was the only sign she gave of her past trouble , which yet must be a present care , thought Molly . After dinner , Mr. Gibson went out to his town patients ; Mrs. Gibson subsided into her arm - chair , holding a sheet of _ The Times _ before her , behind which she took a quiet and lady - like doze . Cynthia had a book in one hand , with the other she shaded her eyes from the light . Molly alone could neither read , nor sleep , nor work . She sate in the seat in the bow - window ; the blind was not drawn down , for there was no danger of their being overlooked . She gazed into the soft outer darkness , and found herself striving to discern the outlines of objects -- the cottage at the end of the garden -- the great beech - tree with the seat round it -- the wire arches , up which the summer roses had clambered ; each came out faint and dim against the dusky velvet of the atmosphere . Presently tea came , and there was the usual nightly bustle . The table was cleared , Mrs. Gibson roused herself , and made the same remark about dear papa that she had done at the same hour for weeks past . Cynthia too did not look different from usual . And yet what a hidden mystery did her calmness hide ! thought Molly . At length came bed - time , and the customary little speeches . Both Molly and Cynthia went to their own rooms without exchanging a word . When Molly was in hers she had forgotten whether she was to go to Cynthia , or Cynthia to come to her . She took off her gown and put on her dressing - gown , and stood and waited , and even sat down for a minute or two : but Cynthia did not come , so Molly went and knocked at the opposite door , which , to her surprise , she found shut . When she entered the room Cynthia sate by her dressing - table , just as she had come up from the drawing - room . She had been leaning her head on her arms , and seemed almost to have forgotten the tryst she had made with Molly , for she looked up as if startled , and her face did seem full of worry and distress ; in her solitude she made no more exertion , but gave way to thoughts of care .

Molly 's arms were round her in a minute , and she pressed the beautiful head to her bosom , and laid her own cheek upon it , and hushed her up with lulling words , just as if Cynthia were a little child . "
239277	239284	239332	239332	He	7226	" murmured Cynthia . And Molly made reply,--"I

239546	239550	239541	239541	I	0	" said Molly , "
239603	240056	240058	240058	her	5329	" So they wished each other good - night . But when Molly got into her room all her spirit left her ; and she threw herself down on her bed , dressed as she was , for she had no heart left for anything . If Roger ever heard of it all by any chance , she felt how it would disturb his love for Cynthia . And yet was it right to conceal it from him ? She must try and persuade Cynthia to tell it all straight out to him as soon as he returned to England . A full confession on her part would wonderfully lessen any pain he might have on first hearing of it . She lost herself in thoughts of Roger -- how he would feel , what he would say , how that meeting would come to pass , where he was at that very time , and so on , till she suddenly plucked herself up , and recollected what she herself had offered and promised to do . Now that the first fervour was over , she saw the difficulties clearly ; and the foremost of all was how she was to manage to have an interview with Mr. Preston . How had Cynthia managed ? and the letters that had passed between them too ? Unwillingly , Molly was compelled to perceive that there must have been a great deal of underhand work going on beneath Cynthia 's apparent openness of behaviour ; and still more unwillingly she began to be afraid that she herself might be led into the practice . But she would try and walk in a straight path ; and if she did wander out of it , it should only be to save pain to those whom she loved . CHAPTER XLIV . MOLLY GIBSON TO THE RESCUE . It seemed curious enough , after the storms of the night , to meet in smooth tranquillity at breakfast . Cynthia was pale ; but she talked as quietly as usual about all manner of indifferent things , while Molly sate silent , watching and wondering , and becoming convinced that Cynthia must have gone through a long experience of concealing her real thoughts and secret troubles before she could have been able to put on such a semblance of composure . Among the letters that came in that morning was one from the London Kirkpatricks ; but not from Helen , Cynthia 's own particular correspondent . Her sister wrote to apologize for Helen , who was not well , she said : had had the influenza , which had left her very weak and poorly . "

240639	240719	240720	240720	Molly	221	" Whether it was Helen 's illness , or from some other cause , after breakfast Cynthia became very flat and absent , and this lasted all day long . Molly understood now why her moods had been so changeable for many months , and was tender and forbearing with her accordingly . Towards evening , when the two girls were left alone , Cynthia came and stood over Molly , so that her face could not be seen . "
240722	240726	240728	240728	you	221	" said she , "
240787	240882	240883	240883	You	221	" Now it so happened that with every thought she had given to it , Molly disliked the idea of the proposed interview with Mr. Preston more and more ; but it was , after all , her own offer , and she neither could nor would draw back from it ; it might do good ; she did not see how it could possibly do harm . So she gave her consent , and tried to conceal her distaste , which grew upon her more and more as Cynthia hastily arranged the details . "
240942	240981	240936	240936	you	221	" It did strike Molly that Cynthia must have had some experience in making all these arrangements ; and she ventured to ask how he was to be informed of all this . Cynthia only reddened and replied , "
241047	241061	241031	241031	Molly	221	" Molly thought of Roger , and that thought prompted her next speech . "
241099	241106	241107	241107	You	221	" She blushed as she spoke . "
241115	241119	241112	241113	Mr. Preston	260	" said Cynthia . "
241289	241645	241673	241673	her	265	" Loaded with many such messages , which she felt that she should never deliver , not really knowing what she should say , hating the errand , not satisfied with Cynthia 's manner of speaking about her relations to Roger , oppressed with shame and complicity in conduct which appeared to her deceitful , yet willing to bear all and brave all , if she could once set Cynthia in a straight path -- in a clear space , and almost more pitiful to her friend 's great distress and possible disgrace , than able to give her that love which involves perfect sympathy , Molly set out on her walk towards the appointed place . It was a cloudy , blustering day , and the noise of the blowing wind among the nearly leafless branches of the great trees filled her ears , as she passed through the park - gates and entered the avenue . She walked quickly , instinctively wishing to get her blood up , and have no time for thought . But there was a bend in the avenue about a quarter of a mile from the lodge ; after that bend it was a straight line up to the great house , now emptied of its inhabitants . Molly did not like going quite out of sight of the lodge , and she stood facing it , close by the trunk of one of the trees . Presently she heard a step coming over the grass . It was Mr. Preston . He saw a woman 's figure , half - behind the trunk of a tree , and made no doubt that it was Cynthia . But when he came nearer , almost close , the figure turned round , and , instead of the brilliantly coloured face of Cynthia , he met the pale resolved look of Molly . She did not speak to greet him ; but though he felt sure from the general aspect of pallor and timidity that she was afraid of him , her steady gray eyes met his with courageous innocence . "

241675	241756	241667	241667	you	5373	" said Molly , a little surprised . In her simplicity she had believed that Cynthia had named that it was she , Molly Gibson , who would meet Mr. Preston at a given time and place ; but Cynthia had been too worldly - wise for that , and had decoyed him thither by a vaguely worded note , which , while avoiding actual falsehood , had led him to believe that she herself would give him the meeting .

Molly hesitated a little before she spoke . He was determined not to break the silence ; as she had intruded herself into the affair , she should find her situation as awkward as possible . "

He knew that much , and he wondered how she , the girl standing before him , had been clever enough to find it out . He forgot himself for an instant in admiration of her . There she stood , frightened , yet brave , not letting go her hold on what she meant to do , even when things seemed most against her ; and besides , there was something that struck him most of all perhaps , and which shows the kind of man he was -- he perceived that Molly was as unconscious that he was a young man , and she a young woman , as if she had been a pure angel of heaven . Though he felt that he would have to yield , and give up the letters , he was not going to do it at once ; and while he was thinking what to say , so as still to evade making any concession till he had had time to think over it , he , with his quick senses all about him , heard the trotting of a horse cranching quickly along over the gravel of the drive . A moment afterwards , Molly 's perception overtook his . He could see the startled look overspread her face ; and in an instant she would have run away , but before the first rush was made , Mr. Preston laid his hand firmly on her arm . "

Having anything to conceal was so unusual -- almost so unprecedented a circumstance with her that it preyed upon her in every way . It was a nightmare that she could not shake off ; she did so wish to forget it all , and yet every little occurrence seemed to remind her of it . The next morning 's post brought several letters ; one from Roger for Cynthia , and Molly , letterless herself , looked at Cynthia as she read it , with wistful sadness . It appeared to Molly as though Cynthia should have no satisfaction in these letters , until she had told him what was her exact position with Mr. Preston ; yet Cynthia was colouring and dimpling up as she always did at any pretty words of praise , or admiration , or love . But Molly 's thoughts and Cynthia 's reading were both interrupted by a little triumphant sound from Mrs. Gibson , as she pushed a letter she had just received to her husband , with a-- "

In the first place , there was no accompanying the travellers to the inn from which the coach started ; leave - taking in the market - place was quite out of the bounds of Mrs. Gibson 's sense of propriety . Besides this , it was a gloomy , rainy evening , and candles had to be brought in at an unusually early hour . There would be no break for six hours -- no music , no reading ; but the two ladies would sit at their worsted work , pattering away at small - talk , with not even the usual break of dinner ; for , to suit the requirements of those who were leaving , they had already dined early . But Mrs. Gibson really meant to make Molly happy , and tried to be an agreeable companion , only Molly was not well , and was uneasy about many apprehended cares and troubles -- and at such hours of indisposition as she was then passing through , apprehensions take the shape of certainties , lying await in our paths . Molly would have given a good deal to have shaken off all these feelings , unusual enough to her ; but the very house and furniture , and rain - blurred outer landscape , seemed steeped with unpleasant associations , most of them dating from the last few days .

It was on the day following Mr. Gibson 's departure that Mrs. Gibson received one of the notes , not so common now as formerly , from the family in town , asking her to go over to the Towers , and find a book , or a manuscript , or something or other that Lady Cumnor wanted with all an invalid 's impatience . It was just the kind of employment she required for an amusement on a gloomy day , and it put her into a good humour immediately . There was a certain confidential importance about it , and it was a variety , and it gave her the pleasant drive in a fly up the noble avenue , and the sense of being the temporary mistress of all the grand rooms once so familiar to her . She asked Molly to accompany her , out of an access of kindness , but was not at all sorry when Molly excused herself and preferred stopping at home . At eleven o'clock Mrs. Gibson was off , all in her Sunday best ( to use the servant 's expression , which she herself would so have contemned ) , well - dressed in order to impose on the servants at the Towers , for there was no one else to see or to be seen by .

250167	251066	250152	250152	I	0	" said Molly , smiling , and trying to look perfectly indifferent , but going extremely red at the mention of Mr. Preston 's name . It was very difficult for her to keep up any conversation , for her heart was full of Osborne -- his changed appearance , his melancholy words of foreboding , and his confidences about his wife -- French , Catholic , servant . Molly could not help trying to piece these strange facts together by imaginations of her own , and found it very hard work to attend to kind Miss Phoebe 's unceasing patter . She came up to the point , however , when the voice ceased ; and could recall , in a mechanical manner , the echo of the last words , which both from Miss Phoebe 's look , and the dying accent that lingered in Molly 's ear , she perceived to be a question . Miss Phoebe was asking her if she would go out with her . She was going to Grinstead 's , the bookseller of Hollingford ; who , in addition to his regular business , was the agent for the Hollingford Book Society , received their subscriptions , kept their accounts , ordered their books from London , and , on payment of a small salary , allowed the Society to keep their volumes on shelves in his shop . It was the centre of news , and the club , as it were , of the little town . Everybody who pretended to gentility in the place belonged to it . It was a test of gentility , indeed , rather than of education or a love of literature . No shopkeeper would have thought of offering himself as a member , however great his general intelligence and love of reading ; while it boasted on its list of subscribers most of the county families in the neighbourhood , some of whom subscribed to it as a sort of duty belonging to their station , without often using their privilege of reading the books : while there were residents in the little town , such as Mrs. Goodenough , who privately thought reading a great waste of time , that might be much better employed in sewing , and knitting , and pastry - making , but who nevertheless belonged to it as a mark of station , just as these good , motherly women would have thought it a terrible come - down in the world if they had not had a pretty young servant - maid to fetch them home from the tea - parties at night . At any rate , Grinstead 's was a very convenient place for a lounge . In that view of the Book Society every one agreed . Molly went upstairs to get ready to accompany Miss Phoebe ; and on opening one of her drawers she saw Cynthia 's envelope , containing the money she owed to Mr. Preston , carefully sealed up like a letter . This was what Molly had so unwillingly promised to deliver -- the last final stroke to the affair . Molly took it up , hating it . For a time she had forgotten it ; and now it was here , facing her , and she must try and get rid of it . She put it into her pocket for the chances of the walk and the day , and fortune for once seemed to befriend her ; for , on their entering Grinstead 's shop , in which two or three people were now , as always , congregated , making play of examining the books , or business of writing down the titles of new works in the order - book , there was Mr. Preston . He bowed as they came in . He could not help that ; but , at the sight of Molly , he looked as ill - tempered and out of humour as a man well could do . She was connected in his mind with defeat and mortification ; and besides , the sight of her called up what he desired now , above all things , to forget ; namely , the deep conviction , received through Molly 's simple earnestness , of Cynthia 's dislike to him . If Miss Phoebe had seen the scowl upon his handsome face , she might have undeceived her sister in her suppositions about him and Molly . But Miss Phoebe , who did not consider it quite maidenly to go and stand close to Mr. Preston , and survey the shelves of books in such close proximity to a gentleman , found herself an errand at the other end of the shop , and occupied herself in buying writing - paper . Molly fingered her valuable letter , as it lay in her pocket ; did she dare to cross over to Mr. Preston , and give it to him , or not ? While she was still undecided , shrinking always just at the moment when she thought she had got her courage up for action , Miss Phoebe , having finished her purchase , turned round , and after looking a little pathetically at Mr. Preston 's back , said to Molly in a whisper--"I
251087	251126	251127	251127	I	0	" So across the street to Johnson 's they went ; but no sooner had they entered the draper 's shop , than Molly 's conscience smote her for her cowardice , and loss of a good opportunity . "
251133	251464	251127	251127	I	0	" said she , as soon as Miss Phoebe was engaged with her purchases ; and Molly ran across to Grinstead 's , without looking either to the right or the left ; she had been watching the door , and she knew that no Mr. Preston had issued forth . She ran in ; he was at the counter now , talking to Grinstead himself ; Molly put the letter into his hand , to his surprise , and almost against his will , and turned round to go back to Miss Phoebe . At the door of the shop stood Mrs. Goodenough , arrested in the act of entering , staring , with her round eyes , made still rounder and more owl - like by spectacles , to see Molly Gibson giving Mr. Preston a letter , which he , conscious of being watched , and favouring underhand practices habitually , put quickly into his pocket , unopened . Perhaps , if he had had time for reflection he would not have scrupled to put Molly to open shame , by rejecting what she so eagerly forced upon him . There was another long evening to be got through with Mrs. Gibson ; but on this occasion there was the pleasant occupation of dinner , which took up at least an hour ; for it was one of Mrs. Gibson 's fancies -- one which Molly chafed against -- to have every ceremonial gone through in the same stately manner for two as for twenty . So , although Molly knew full well , and her stepmother knew full well , and Maria knew full well , that neither Mrs. Gibson nor Molly touched dessert , it was set on the table with as much form as if Cynthia had been at home , who delighted in almonds and raisins ; or Mr. Gibson been there , who never could resist dates , though he always protested against "
251482	251509	251127	251127	I	0	" And Mrs. Gibson herself apologized , as it were , to Molly to - day , in the same words she had often used to Mr. Gibson,--"It
251547	251780	251532	251532	Maria	221	" All through the evening Molly 's thoughts wandered far and wide , though she managed to keep up a show of attention to what Mrs. Gibson was saying . She was thinking of Osborne , and his abrupt , half - finished confidence , and his ill - looks ; she was wondering when Roger would come home , and longing for his return , as much ( she said to herself ) for Osborne 's sake as for her own . And then she checked herself . What had she to do with Roger ? Why should she long for his return ? It was Cynthia who was doing this ; only somehow he was such a true friend to Molly , that she could not help thinking of him as a staff and a stay in the troublous times which appeared to lie not far ahead -- this evening . Then Mr. Preston and her little adventure with him came uppermost . How angry he looked ! How could Cynthia have liked him even enough to get into this abominable scrape , which was , however , all over now ! And so she ran on in her fancies and imaginations , little dreaming that that very night much talk was going on not half - a - mile from where she sate sewing , that would prove that the "

Its nature is the reverse of that of the dormouse . Warm ambient air , loiterings abroad , gardenings , flowers to talk about , and preserves to make , soothed the wicked imp to slumber in the parish of Hollingford in summer - time . But when evenings grew short , and people gathered round the fires , and put their feet in a circle -- not on the fenders , that was not allowed -- then was the time for confidential conversation ! Or in the pauses allowed for the tea - trays to circulate among the card - tables -- when those who were peaceably inclined tried to stop the warm discussions about "

And as for Mrs. Dawes , she was too anxious to get into the genteelest of all ( Hollingford ) society to object to whatever Miss Browning ( who , in right of being a deceased rector 's daughter , rather represented the selectest circle of the little town ) advocated , whether celibacy , marriage , bigamy , or polygamy . So the remainder of the evening passed over without any further reference to the secret Mrs. Goodenough was burning to disclose , unless a remark made _ propos de rien _ by Miss Browning , during the silence of a deal , could be supposed to have connection with the previous conversation . She said suddenly and abruptly,-- "
252961	253037	252949	252949	I	0	" If she was referring to any prospect of matrimonial danger she saw opening before her fancy , she might have been comforted . But it was a remark of which no one took any notice , all being far too much engaged in the rubber . Only when Miss Browning took her early leave ( for Miss Phoebe had a cold , and was an invalid at home ) , Mrs. Goodenough burst out with-- "

254313	254461	254462	254462	Papa	7226	" So with formal dipping curtseys the ladies separated , but not without thanking Mrs. Dawes for the pleasant evening they had had ; a piece of old - fashioned courtesy always gone through in those days . CHAPTER XLVII . SCANDAL AND ITS VICTIMS . When Mr. Gibson returned to Hollingford , he found an accumulation of business waiting for him , and he was much inclined to complain of the consequences of the two days ' comparative holiday , which had resulted in over - work for the week to come . He had hardly time to speak to his family , he had so immediately to rush off to pressing cases of illness . But Molly managed to arrest him in the hall , standing there with his great coat held out ready for him to put on , but whispering as she did so-- "
254487	254506	254480	254480	he	234	" Mr. Gibson faced about , and looked at her for a moment ; but all he said was-- "
254535	254536	254532	254532	I	0	" "
254539	254562	254532	254532	I	0	" said Molly , for she had only told Mrs. Gibson of Osborne 's call , not of the occasion for it . "
254593	254614	254589	254589	I	0	" Something in her father 's manner disheartened Molly , who had persuaded herself that Osborne 's evident illness was partly "
254617	254795	254589	254589	I	0	" by which she meant imaginary . She had dwelt upon his looks of enjoyment at Miss Phoebe 's perplexity , and thought that no one really believing himself to be in danger could have given the merry glances which he had done ; but after seeing the seriousness of her father 's face , she recurred to the shock she had experienced on first seeing Osborne 's changed appearance . All this time Mrs. Gibson was busy reading a letter from Cynthia which Mr. Gibson had brought from London ; for every opportunity of private conveyance was seized upon when postage was so high ; and Cynthia had forgotten so many things in her hurried packing , that she now sent a list of the clothes which she required . Molly almost wondered that it had not come to her ; but she did not understand the sort of reserve that was springing up in Cynthia 's mind towards her . Cynthia herself struggled with the feeling , and tried to fight against it by calling herself "
254798	255000	254589	254589	I	0	" but the truth was , she believed that she no longer held her former high place in Molly 's estimation and she could not help turning away from one who knew things to her discredit . She was fully aware of Molly 's prompt decision and willing action , where action was especially disagreeable , on her behalf ; she knew that Molly would never bring up the past errors and difficulties ; but still the consciousness that the good , straightforward girl had learnt that Cynthia had been guilty of so much underhand work cooled her regard , and restrained her willingness of intercourse . Reproach herself with ingratitude as she would , she could not help feeling glad to be away from Molly ; it was awkward to speak to her as if nothing had happened ; it was awkward to write to her about forgotten ribbons and laces , when their last conversation had been on such different subjects , and had called out such vehement expressions of feeling . So Mrs. Gibson held the list in her hand , and read out the small fragments of news that were intermixed with notices of Cynthia 's requirements . "
255009	255015	255001	255001	Helen	464	" said Molly at length , "
255028	255029	255017	255017	Cynthia	265	" "
255042	255049	255038	255038	I	0	" replied Mrs. Gibson rather sharply . "
255217	255323	255213	255213	I	0	" Mrs. Gibson here thought fit to sigh before going on with Cynthia 's letter . As far as Molly could make any sense out of this rather incoherent epistle , very incoherently read aloud to her , Cynthia was really pleased , and glad to be of use and comfort to Helen , but at the same time very ready to be easily persuaded into the perpetual small gaieties which abounded in her uncle 's house in London , even at this dead season of the year . Mrs. Gibson came upon Mr. Henderson 's name once , and then went on with a running "
255329	255357	255213	255213	I	0	" to herself , which sounded very mysterious , but which might as well have been omitted , as all that Cynthia really said about him was , "
255402	255652	255388	255389	my uncle	2944	" Then there came a very affectionate , carefully worded message to Molly,--implying a good deal more than was said of loving gratitude for the trouble she had taken on Cynthia 's behalf . And that was all ; and Molly went away a little depressed ; she knew not why . The operation on Lady Cumnor had been successfully performed , and in a few days they hoped to bring her down to the Towers to recruit her strength in the fresh country air . The case was one which interested Mr. Gibson extremely , and in which his opinion had been proved to be right , in opposition to that of one or two great names in London . The consequence was that he was frequently consulted and referred to during the progress of her recovery ; and , as he had much to do in the immediate circle of his Hollingford practice , as well as to write thoughtful letters to his medical brethren in London , he found it difficult to spare the three or four hours necessary to go over to Hamley to see Osborne . He wrote to him , however , begging him to reply immediately and detail his symptoms ; and from the answer he received he did not imagine that the case was immediately pressing . Osborne , too , deprecated his coming over to Hamley for the express purpose of seeing him . So the visit was deferred to that "
255656	255815	255818	255818	her	5657	" which is so often too late . All these days the buzzing gossip about Molly 's meetings with Mr. Preston , her clandestine correspondence , the secret interviews in lonely places , had been gathering strength , and assuming the positive form of scandal . The simple innocent girl , who walked through the quiet streets without a thought of being the object of mysterious implications , became for a time the unconscious black sheep of the town . Servants heard part of what was said in their mistresses ' drawing - rooms , and exaggerated the sayings amongst themselves with the coarse strengthening of expression common with uneducated people . Mr. Preston himself became aware that her name was being coupled with his , though hardly to the extent to which the love of excitement and gossip had carried people 's speeches ; he chuckled over the mistake , but took no pains to correct it . "
255821	255827	255818	255818	her	5657	" said he to himself , "
255836	256246	255818	255818	her	5657	" and he felt himself avenged for the discomfiture which her menace of appealing to Lady Harriet had caused him , and the mortification he had experienced in learning from her plain - speaking lips , how he had been talked over by Cynthia and herself , with personal dislike on the one side , and evident contempt on the other . Besides , if any denial of Mr. Preston 's stirred up an examination as to the real truth , more might come out of his baffled endeavours to compel Cynthia to keep to her engagement to him than he cared to have known . He was angry with himself for still loving Cynthia ; loving her in his own fashion , be it understood . He told himself that many a woman of more position and wealth would be glad enough to have him ; some of them pretty women too . And he asked himself why he was such a confounded fool as to go on hankering after a penniless girl , who was as fickle as the wind ? The answer was silly enough , logically ; but forcible in fact . Cynthia was Cynthia , and not Venus herself could have been her substitute . In this one thing Mr. Preston was more really true than many worthy men ; who , seeking to be married , turn with careless facility from the unattainable to the attainable , and keep their feelings and fancy tolerably loose till they find a woman who consents to be their wife . But no one would ever be to Mr. Preston what Cynthia had been , and was ; and yet he could have stabbed her in certain of his moods . So , Molly , who had come between him and the object of his desire , was not likely to find favour in his sight , or to obtain friendly actions from him . There came a time -- not very distant from the evening at Mrs. Dawes'--when Molly felt that people looked askance at her . Mrs. Goodenough openly pulled her grand - daughter away , when the young girl stopped to speak to Molly in the street , and an engagement which the two had made for a long walk together was cut very short by a very trumpery excuse . Mrs. Goodenough explained her conduct in the following manner to some of her friends:-- "
256410	256438	256392	256392	Annabella	488	" For a good while the Miss Brownings were kept in ignorance of the evil tongues that whispered hard words about Molly . Miss Browning was known to "
256443	256687	256688	256688	Phoebe	168	" and by instinct every one who came in contact with her shrank from irritating that temper by uttering the slightest syllable against the smallest of those creatures over whom she spread the ¾gis of her love . She would and did reproach them herself ; she used to boast that she never spared them : but no one else might touch them with the slightest slur of a passing word . But Miss Phoebe inspired no such terror ; the great reason why she did not hear of the gossip against Molly as early as any one , was that , although she was not the rose , she lived near the rose . Besides , she was of so tender a nature that even thick - skinned Mrs. Goodenough was unwilling to say what would give Miss Phoebe pain ; and it was the new - comer Mrs. Dawes , who in all ignorance alluded to the town 's talk , as to something of which Miss Phoebe must be aware . Then Miss Phoebe poured down her questions , although she protested , even with tears , her total disbelief in all the answers she received . It was a small act of heroism on her part to keep all that she then learnt a secret from her sister Dorothy , as she did for four or five days ; till Miss Browning attacked her one evening with the following speech:-- "

But she had not the long habit of reverence for Miss Browning which would have kept so many Hollingford ladies from justifying themselves if she found fault . Mrs. Dawes stood up for herself and her own veracity , bringing out fresh scandal , which she said she did not believe , but that many did ; and adducing so much evidence as to the truth of what she had said and did believe , that Miss Browning was almost quelled , and sate silent and miserable at the end of Mrs. Dawes ' justification of herself .

Then Miss Browning went home , and said but a few words to Phoebe , who indeed saw well enough that her sister had heard the reports confirmed , and needed no further explanation of the cause of scarcely - tasted dinner , and short replies , and saddened looks . Presently Miss Browning sate down and wrote a short note . Then she rang the bell , and told the little maiden who answered it to take it to Mr. Gibson , and if he was out to see that it was given to him as soon as ever he came home . And then she went and put on her Sunday cap ; and Miss Phoebe knew that her sister had written to ask Mr. Gibson to come and be told of the rumours affecting his daughter . Miss Browning was sadly disturbed at the information she had received , and the task that lay before her ; she was miserably uncomfortable to herself and irritable to Miss Phoebe , and the netting - cotton she was using kept continually snapping and breaking from the jerks of her nervous hands . When the knock at the door was heard,--the well - known doctor 's knock,--Miss Browning took off her spectacles , and dropped them on the carpet , breaking them as she did so ; and then she bade Miss Phoebe leave the room , as if her presence had cast the evil - eye , and caused the misfortune . She wanted to look natural , and was distressed at forgetting whether she usually received him sitting or standing . "

AN INNOCENT CULPRIT . With his head bent down -- as if he were facing some keen - blowing wind -- and yet there was not a breath of air stirring -- Mr. Gibson went swiftly to his own home . He rang at the door - bell ; an unusual proceeding on his part . Maria opened the door . "
260284	260309	260435	260435	Osborne	234	" There was something in Mr. Gibson 's manner that made Maria obey him to the letter , in spite of Molly 's surprised question,-- "
260319	260390	260391	260391	Papa	180	" Mr. Gibson went into the dining - room , and shut the door , for an instant 's solitude . He went up to the chimney - piece , took hold of it , and laid his head on his hands , and tried to still the beating of his heart . The door opened . He knew that Molly stood there before he heard her tone of astonishment . "

260437	260480	260435	260435	Osborne	234	" she asked , breathless . If Mr. Gibson had not been too much agitated to judge calmly , he might have deduced comfort from these three words . But instead of allowing himself to seek for comfort from collateral evidence , he said,--"Molly
260522	260792	260819	260819	you	5731	" Though he had professed to disbelieve all this , and did disbelieve it at the bottom of his soul , his voice was hard and stern , his face was white and grim , and his eyes fixed Molly 's with the terrible keenness of their research . Molly trembled all over , but she did not attempt to evade his penetration . If she was silent for a moment , it was because she was rapidly reviewing her relation with regard to Cynthia in the matter . It was but a moment 's pause of silence ; but it seemed long minutes to one who was craving for a burst of indignant denial . He had taken hold of her two arms just above her wrists , as she had advanced towards him ; he was unconscious of this action ; but , as his impatience for her words grew upon him , he grasped her more and more tightly in his vice - like hands , till she made a little involuntary sound of pain . And then he let go ; and she looked at her soft bruised flesh , with tears gathering fast to her eyes to think that he , her father , should have hurt her so . At the instant it appeared to her stranger that he should inflict bodily pain upon his child , than that he should have heard the truth -- even in an exaggerated form . With a childish gesture she held out her arm to him ; but if she expected pity , she received none . "

Then he raised his eyes to hers for the first time since she had acknowledged the external truth of what he charged her with . Her face was very white , but it bore the impress of the final sincerity of death , when the true expression prevails without the poor disguises of time . "

263112	263877	263107	263107	I	0	" For all Molly 's bravery at the time of this conversation , it was she that suffered more than her father . He kept out of the way of hearing gossip ; but she was perpetually thrown into the small society of the place . Mrs. Gibson herself had caught cold , and moreover was not tempted by the quiet old - fashioned visiting which was going on just about this time , provoked by the visit of two of Mrs. Dawes ' pretty unrefined nieces , who laughed , and chattered , and ate , and would fain have flirted with Mr. Ashton , the vicar , could he have been brought by any possibility to understand his share in the business . Mr. Preston did not accept the invitations to Hollingford tea - drinkings with the same eager gratitude as he had done a year before : or else the shadow which hung over Molly would have extended to him , her co - partner in the clandestine meetings which gave such umbrage to the feminine virtue of the town . Molly herself was invited , because it would not do to pass any apparent slight on either Mr. or Mrs. Gibson ; but there was a tacit and underhand protest against her being received on the old terms . Every one was civil to her , but no one was cordial ; there was a very perceptible film of difference in their behaviour to her from what it was formerly ; nothing that had outlines and could be defined . But Molly , for all her clear conscience and her brave heart , felt acutely that she was only tolerated , not welcomed . She caught the buzzing whispers of the two Miss Oakes 's , who , when they first met the heroine of the prevailing scandal , looked at her askance , and criticised her pretensions to good looks , with hardly an attempt at under - tones . Molly tried to be thankful that her father was not in the mood for visiting . She was even glad that her stepmother was too much of an invalid to come out , when she felt thus slighted , and as it were , degraded from her place . Miss Browning herself , that true old friend , spoke to her with chilling dignity , and much reserve ; for she had never heard a word from Mr. Gibson since the evening when she had put herself to so much pain to tell him of the disagreeable rumours affecting his daughter . Only Miss Phoebe would seek out Molly with even more than her former tenderness ; and this tried Molly 's calmness more than all the slights put together . The soft hand , pressing hers under the table,--the continual appeals to her , so as to bring her back into the conversation , touched Molly almost to shedding tears . Sometimes the poor girl wondered to herself whether this change in the behaviour of her acquaintances was not a mere fancy of hers ; whether , if she had never had that conversation with her father , in which she had borne herself so bravely at the time , she should have discovered the difference in their treatment of her . She never told her father how she felt these perpetual small slights : she had chosen to bear the burden of her own free will ; nay , more , she had insisted on being allowed to do so ; and it was not for her to grieve him now by showing that she shrank from the consequences of her own act . So she never even made an excuse for not going into the small gaieties , or mingling with the society of Hollingford . Only she suddenly let go the stretch of restraint she was living in , when one evening her father told her that he was really anxious about Mrs. Gibson 's cough , and should like Molly to give up a party at Mrs. Goodenough 's , to which they were all three invited , but to which Molly alone was going . Molly 's heart leaped up at the thought of stopping at home , even though the next moment she had to blame herself for rejoicing at a reprieve that was purchased by another 's suffering . However , the remedies prescribed by her husband did Mrs. Gibson good ; and she was particularly grateful and caressing to Molly . "

Lady Cumnor had so far recovered from the violence of her attack , and from the consequent operation , as to be able to be removed to the Towers for change of air ; and accordingly she was brought thither by her whole family with all the pomp and state becoming an invalid peeress . There was every probability that "
264920	265621	265622	265622	I	0	" would make a longer residence at the Towers than they had done for several years , during which time they had been wanderers hither and thither in search of health . Somehow , after all , it was very pleasant and restful to come to the old ancestral home , and every member of the family enjoyed it in his or her own way ; Lord Cumnor most especially . His talent for gossip and his love of small details had scarcely fair play in the hurry of a London life , and were much nipped in the bud during his Continental sojournings , as he neither spoke French fluently , nor understood it easily when spoken . Besides , he was a great proprietor , and liked to know how his land was going on ; how his tenants were faring in the world . He liked to hear of their births , marriages , and deaths , and had something of a royal memory for faces . In short , if ever a peer was an old woman , Lord Cumnor was that peer ; but he was a very good - natured old woman , and rode about on his stout old cob with his pockets full of halfpence for the children , and little packets of snuff for the old people . Like an old woman , too , he enjoyed an afternoon cup of tea in his wife 's sitting - room , and over his gossip 's beverage he would repeat all that he had learnt in the day . Lady Cumnor was exactly in that state of convalescence when such talk as her lord 's was extremely agreeable to her , but she had contemned the habit of listening to gossip so severely all her life , that she thought it due to consistency to listen first , and enter a supercilious protest afterwards . It had , however , come to be a family habit for all of them to gather together in Lady Cumnor 's room on their return from their daily walks , or drives , or rides , and over the fire , sipping their tea at her early meal , to recount the morsels of local intelligence they had heard during the morning . When they had said all that they had to say ( and not before ) , they had always to listen to a short homily from her ladyship on the well - worn texts,--the poorness of conversation about persons,--the probable falsehood of all they had heard , and the degradation of character implied by its repetition . On one of these November evenings they were all assembled in Lady Cumnor 's room . She was lying,--all draped in white , and covered up with an Indian shawl,--on a sofa near the fire . Lady Harriet sate on the rug , close before the wood - fire , picking up fallen embers with a pair of dwarf tongs , and piling them on the red and odorous heap in the centre of the hearth . Lady Cuxhaven , notable from girlhood , was using the blind man 's holiday to net fruit - nets for the walls at Cuxhaven Park . Lady Cumnor 's woman was trying to see to pour out tea by the light of one small wax - candle in the background ( for Lady Cumnor could not bear much light to her weakened eyes ) ; and the great leafless branches of the trees outside the house kept sweeping against the windows , moved by the wind that was gathering . It was always Lady Cumnor 's habit to snub those she loved best . Her husband was perpetually snubbed by her , yet she missed him now that he was later than usual , and professed not to want her tea ; but they all knew that it was only because he was not there to hand it to her , and be found fault with for his invariable stupidity in forgetting that she liked to put sugar in before she took any cream . At length he burst in:-- "

She would not have spoken about the rumour she had heard to any who were not warm friends of Molly 's . If Mr. Sheepshanks had chosen to allude to it when she had been riding with her father , she would very soon have silenced him by one of the haughty looks she knew full well how to assume . But she felt as if she must know the truth , and accordingly she began thus abruptly to Miss Browning : "

267720	267854	267713	267713	I	0	" So she left Miss Phoebe in tears , and locked herself up in her own room . Lady Harriet , meanwhile , was riding homewards by her father 's side , apparently listening to all he chose to say , but in reality turning over the probabilities and possibilities that might account for these strange interviews between Molly and Mr. Preston . It was a case of _ parler de l'ne et l'on en voit les oreilles _ . At a turn in the road they saw Mr. Preston a little way before them , coming towards them on his good horse , _ point device _ , in his riding attire . The earl , in his thread - bare coat , and on his old brown cob , called out cheerfully,-- "
267906	267933	267935	267935	Preston	260	" While they were talking over this bit of land , Lady Harriet came to her resolution . As soon as her father had finished , she said,--"Mr

It was not in the words themselves , nor in the tone in which they were spoken , nor in the look which accompanied them , it was in all ; it implied a doubt of Lady Harriet 's right to question him as she did ; and there was something of defiance in it as well . But this touch of insolence put Lady Harriet 's mettle up ; and she was not one to check herself , in any course , for the opinion of an inferior . "

"
268795	268830	268787	268787	he	260	" continued she , still in that gracious manner which made him feel that he now held a much higher place in her esteem than he had had at the beginning of their interview , "

Lady Harriet had to stand a good many strictures on manners , and proper dignity for a few days after this . However , she consoled herself by calling on the Gibsons ; and , finding that Mrs. Gibson ( who was still an invalid ) was asleep at the time , she experienced no difficulty in carrying off the unconscious Molly for a walk , which Lady Harriet so contrived that they twice passed through all the length of the principal street of the town , loitered at Grinstead 's for half an hour , and wound up by Lady Harriet 's calling on the Miss Brownings , who , to her regret , were not at home .

Mrs. Gibson was slow in recovering her strength after the influenza , and before she was well enough to accept Lady Harriet 's invitation to the Towers , Cynthia came home from London . If Molly had thought her manner of departure was scarcely as affectionate and considerate as it might have been,--if such a thought had crossed Molly 's fancy for an instant , she was repentant for it as soon as ever Cynthia returned , and the girls met together face to face , with all the old familiar affection , going upstairs to the drawing - room , with their arms round each other 's waists , and sitting there together hand in hand . Cynthia 's whole manner was more quiet than it had been , when the weight of her unpleasant secret rested on her mind , and made her alternately despondent or flighty . "

269799	270039	269784	269784	You	0	" said Mrs. Gibson , rather querulously , she being one of those who , when their malady is only trifling , exaggerate it , but when it is really of some consequence , are unwilling to sacrifice any pleasures by acknowledging it . It was well for her in this instance that her husband had wisdom and authority enough to forbid her going to this ball , on which she had set her heart ; but the consequence of his prohibition was an increase of domestic plaintiveness and low spirits , which seemed to tell on Cynthia -- the bright gay Cynthia herself -- and it was often hard work for Molly to keep up the spirits of two other people as well as her own . Ill - health might account for Mrs. Gibson 's despondency , but why was Cynthia so silent , not to say so sighing ? Molly was puzzled to account for it ; and all the more perplexed because from time to time Cynthia kept calling upon her for praise for some unknown and mysterious virtue that she had practised ; and Molly was young enough to believe that , after any exercise of virtue , the spirits rose , cheered up by an approving conscience . Such was not the case with Cynthia , however . She sometimes said such things as these , when she had been particularly inert and desponding:-- "
270078	270081	270065	270065	I	0	" Or , "
270176	270346	270347	270347	I	0	" But Molly had had some experience of Cynthia 's whim of perpetually hinting at a mystery which she did not mean to reveal in the Mr. Preston days , and , although she was occasionally piqued into curiosity , Cynthia 's allusions at something more in the background fell in general on rather deaf ears . One day the mystery burst its shell , and came out in the shape of an offer made to Cynthia by Mr. Henderson -- and refused . Under all the circumstances , Molly could not appreciate the heroic goodness so often alluded to . The revelation of the secret at last took place in this way . Mrs. Gibson breakfasted in bed : she had done so ever since she had had the influenza ; and , consequently , her own private letters always went up on her breakfast - tray . One morning she came into the drawing - room earlier than usual , with an open letter in her hand . "
270378	270441	270371	270371	she	265	" ( holding out the letter to her , with a certain paragraph indicated by her finger ) . Cynthia put her netting on one side , and looked at the writing . Suddenly her face turned scarlet , and then became of a deadly white . She looked at Molly , as if to gain courage from the strong serene countenance . "

270852	270932	270935	270935	Molly	221	" began Molly ; but then she remembered that her stepmother was far from strong , and unable to bear a protest in favour of the right course without irritation . So she changed her speech into a suggestion of remedies for palpitation ; and curbed her impatience to speak out her indignation at the contemplated falsehood to Roger . But when they were alone , and Cynthia began upon the subject , Molly was less merciful . Cynthia said,-- "

270970	270976	270967	270968	Mr. Coxe	215	" said Molly , gravely . "

271048	271318	271012	271012	He	215	" said Molly , simply ; for to her mind the pleasantest and kindest person in the world put in comparison with Roger was as nothing ; he stood by himself . Cynthia 's next words,--and they did not come very soon,--were on quite a different subject , and spoken in rather a pettish tone . Nor did she allude again in jesting sadness to her late efforts at virtue . In a little while Mrs. Gibson was able to accept the often - repeated invitation from the Towers to go and stay there for a day or two . Lady Harriet told her that it would be a kindness to Lady Cumnor to come and bear her company in the life of seclusion the latter was still compelled to lead ; and Mrs. Gibson was flattered and gratified with a dim unconscious sense of being really wanted , not merely deluding herself into a pleasing fiction . Lady Cumnor was in that state of convalescence common to many invalids . The spring of life had begun again to flow , and with the flow returned the old desires and projects and plans , which had all become mere matters of indifference during the worst part of her illness . But as yet her bodily strength was not sufficient to be an agent to her energetic mind , and the difficulty of driving the ill - matched pair of body and will -- the one weak and languid , the other strong and stern,--made her ladyship often very irritable . Mrs. Gibson herself was not quite strong enough for a "

271392	271537	271543	271544	dear mamma	5937	" too long with Lady Cumnor ; but several times when one or the other went to relieve guard they found Clare in tears , and Lady Cumnor holding forth on some point on which she had been meditating during the silent hours of her illness , and on which she seemed to consider herself born to set the world to rights . Mrs. Gibson was always apt to consider these remarks as addressed with a personal direction at some error of her own , and defended the fault in question with a sense of property in it , whatever it might happen to be . The second and the last day of her stay at the Towers , Lady Harriet came in , and found her mother haranguing in an excited tone of voice , and Clare looking submissive and miserable and oppressed .

Lady Harriet had too much experience of her mother 's moods not to lead Mrs. Gibson away almost by main force , she protesting all the while that she did not think there was any truth in the statement , though it was dear Lady Cumnor that said it . Once in her own room , Lady Harriet said , "

272938	272955	272928	272928	she	265	" And so Lady Cumnor really was , in spite of the continual lectures which she gave "
272958	273251	272956	272956	Clare	172	" and which poor Mrs. Gibson turned under as helplessly as the typical worm . Still it was something to have a countess to scold her ; and that pleasure would endure when the worry was past . And then Lady Harriet petted her more than usual to make up for what she had to go through in the convalescent 's room ; and Lady Cuxhaven talked sense to her , with dashes of science and deep thought intermixed , which was very flattering , although generally unintelligible ; and Lord Cumnor , good - natured , good - tempered , kind , and liberal , was full of gratitude to her for her kindness in coming to see Lady Cumnor , and his gratitude took the tangible shape of a haunch of venison , to say nothing of lesser game . When she looked back upon her visit , as she drove home in the solitary grandeur of the Towers ' carriage , there had been but one great enduring rub -- Lady Cumnor 's crossness -- and she chose to consider Cynthia as the cause of that , instead of seeing the truth , which had been so often set before her by the members of her ladyship 's family , that it took its origin in her state of health . Mrs. Gibson did not exactly mean to visit this one discomfort upon Cynthia , nor did she quite mean to upbraid her daughter for conduct as yet unexplained , and which might have some justification ; but , finding her quietly sitting in the drawing - room , she sate down despondingly in her own little easy chair , and in reply to Cynthia 's quick pleasant greeting of-- "

275730	276049	276050	276050	I	0	" [ Illustration ( untitled ) ] Molly had her out - of - door things on , and she crept away as she was bidden . She lifted her heavy weight of heart and body along till she came to a field , not so very far off,--where she had sought the comfort of loneliness ever since she was a child ; and there , under the hedge - bank , she sate down , burying her face in her hands , and quivering all over as she thought of Cynthia 's misery , which she might not try to touch or assuage . She never knew how long she sate there , but it was long past lunch - time when once again she stole up to her room . The door opposite was open wide,--Cynthia had quitted the chamber . Molly arranged her dress and went down into the drawing - room . Cynthia and her mother sate there in the stern repose of an armed neutrality . Cynthia 's face looked made of stone , for colour and rigidity ; but she was netting away as if nothing unusual had occurred . Not so Mrs. Gibson ; her face bore evident marks of tears , and she looked up and greeted Molly 's entrance with a faint smiling notice . Cynthia went on as though she had never heard the opening of the door , or felt the approaching sweep of Molly 's dress . Molly took up a book,--not to read , but to have the semblance of some employment which should not necessitate conversation . There was no measuring the duration of the silence that ensued . Molly grew to fancy it was some old enchantment that weighed upon their tongues and kept them still . At length Cynthia spoke , but she had to begin again before her words came clear . "

Yet when Mr. Gibson came home , after a silent dinner , she asked to speak with him , alone , in his consulting - room ; and there laid bare the exculpation of herself which she had given to Molly many weeks before .

Molly went up to the man , whose thoughts were lost in recollection of the scene he had left at the place he had come from . She laid her hand on the hot damp skin of the horse 's shoulder ; the man started . "

The servants knew no more than she did . Neither she nor they had heard what Cynthia , ever quick of perception , had done . The shutting of the front door had fallen on deaf ears , as far as others were concerned . Upstairs sped Molly to the drawing - room , where Mrs. Gibson stood at the door , listening to the unusual stir in the house . "

278376	278463	278370	278370	He	211	" Jenny had been blamed for coming into the drawing - room instead of Maria , whose place it was , and so had lost the few wits she had . To Molly 's hurried questions her replies had been entirely unsatisfactory . A man had come to the back door -- she could not see who it was -- she had not asked his name : he wanted to speak to master,--master had seemed in a hurry , and only stopped to get his hat . "
278471	278475	278477	278477	he	211	" thought Molly , "
278496	278512	278490	278492	the poor father	6088	" And then a thought came into her head , which she acted upon straight . "
278555	278589	278546	278547	No one	871	" So down into the cluster of collected women Molly came , equipped in her jacket and skirt ; quick determination in her eyes ; controlled quivering about the corners of her mouth . "
278597	278600	278604	278604	you	247	" said Mrs. Gibson--"Molly
278608	278632	278633	278633	I	0	" But Cynthia had understood it at a glance , and was arranging Molly 's hastily assumed dress , as she passed along . "
278677	278755	278775	278775	he	7531	" She heard Mrs. Gibson 's voice following her in remonstrance , but she did not stay for words . She had to wait in the stable - yard , and she wondered how the messenger could bear to eat and drink the food and beer brought out to him by the servants . Her coming out had evidently interrupted the eager talk,--the questions and answers passing sharp to and fro ; but she caught the words , "
278762	278764	278775	278775	he	7531	" and "
278830	278831	278796	278796	he	7531	" "
278835	279001	278796	278796	he	7531	" Molly had never felt that Osborne was really dead till she heard those words . They rode quick under the shadows of the hedgerow trees , but when they slackened speed , to go up a brow , or to give their horses breath , Molly heard those two little words again in her ears ; and said them over again to herself , in hopes of forcing the sharp truth into her unwilling sense . But when they came in sight of the square stillness of the house , shining in the moonlight -- the moon had risen by this time -- Molly caught at her breath , and for an instant she thought she never could go in , and face the presence in that dwelling . One yellow light burnt steadily , spotting the silver shining with its earthly coarseness . The man pointed it out : it was almost the first word he had spoken since they had left Hollingford . "
279068	279536	279049	279049	They	6097	" Molly dropped down from her seat before the man could dismount to help her . She gathered up her skirts and did not stay again to think of what was before her . She ran along the once familiar turns , and swiftly up the stairs , and through the doors , till she came to the last ; then she stopped and listened . It was a deathly silence . She opened the door:--the Squire was sitting alone at the side of the bed , holding the dead man 's hand , and looking straight before him at vacancy . He did not stir or move , even so much as an eyelid , at Molly 's entrance . The truth had entered his soul before this , and he knew that no doctor , be he ever so cunning , could , with all his striving , put the breath into that body again . Molly came up to him with the softest steps , the most hushed breath that ever she could . She did not speak , for she did not know what to say . She felt that he had no more hope from earthly skill , so what was the use of speaking of her father and the delay in his coming ? After a moment 's pause , standing by the old man 's side , she slipped down to the floor , and sat at his feet . Possibly her presence might have some balm in it ; but uttering of words was as a vain thing . He must have been aware of her being there , but he took no apparent notice . There they sate , silent and still , he in his chair , she on the floor ; the dead man , beneath the sheet , for a third . She fancied that she must have disturbed the father in his contemplation of the quiet face , now more than half , but not fully , covered up out of sight . Time had never seemed so without measure , silence had never seemed so noiseless as it did to Molly , sitting there . In the acuteness of her senses she heard a step mounting a distant staircase , coming slowly , coming nearer . She knew it not to be her father 's , and that was all she cared about . Nearer and nearer -- close to the outside of the door -- a pause , and a soft hesitating tap . The great gaunt figure sitting by her side quivered at the sound . Molly rose and went to the door : it was Robinson , the old butler , holding in his hand a covered basin of soup . "
279543	279547	279541	279541	Miss	6106	" said he ; "
279575	279704	279705	279705	He	6107	" He softly removed the cover , and Molly took the basin back with her to her place at the Squire 's side . She did not speak , for she did not well know what to say , or how to present this homely want of nature before one so rapt in grief . But she put a spoonful to his lips , and touched them with the savoury food , as if he had been a sick child , and she the nurse ; and instinctively he took down the first spoonful of the soup . But in a minute he said , with a sort of cry , and almost overturning the basin Molly held , by his passionate gesture as he pointed to the bed,-- "
279713	279795	279705	279705	He	6107	" Then he threw himself across the corpse , and wept in such a terrible manner that Molly trembled lest he also should die -- should break his heart there and then . He took no more notice of her words , of her tears , of her presence , than he did of that of the moon , looking through the unclosed window , with passionless stare . Her father stood by them both before either of them was aware . "
279801	279816	279799	279799	Molly	221	" said he gravely ; but he stroked her head tenderly as she rose . "
279824	280013	279799	279799	Molly	221	" Now she felt the reaction from all her self - control . She trembled with fear as she went along the moonlit passages . It seemed to her as if she should meet Osborne , and hear it all explained ; how he came to die,--what he now felt and thought and wished her to do . She did get down to the dining - room,--the last few steps with a rush of terror,--senseless terror of what might be behind her ; and there she found supper laid out , and candles lit , and Robinson bustling about decanting some wine . She wanted to cry ; to get into some quiet place , and weep away her over - excitement ; but she could hardly do so there . She only felt very much tired , and to care for nothing in this world any more . But vividness of life came back when she found Robinson holding a glass to her lips as she sat in the great leather easy - chair , to which she had gone instinctively as to a place of rest . "
280078	280174	280074	280074	his	7323	" Molly did not say anything . She had not energy enough for resistance . She drank and she ate at the old servant 's bidding ; and then she asked him to leave her alone , and went back to her easy - chair and let herself cry , and so ease her heart . CHAPTER LII . SQUIRE HAMLEY 'S SORROW . It seemed very long before Mr. Gibson came down . He went and stood with his back to the empty fireplace , and did not speak for a minute or two . "

He came in almost like one blind , groping along , and taking hold of chair or table for support or guidance till he reached Mr. Gibson . He did not speak when he held the doctor by the hand ; he only hung down his head , and kept on a feeble shaking of welcome . "
281590	281613	281584	281584	He	6155	" He said this almost as if speaking to a stranger , and informing him of facts of which he was ignorant . "

281706	281768	281688	281688	Roger	467	" He got up and looked at the directions of one or two unopened letters brought by that morning 's post ; among them was one in Cynthia 's handwriting . Both Molly and he saw it at the same time . How long it was since yesterday ! But the Squire took no notice of their proceedings or their looks . "
281807	281838	281839	281839	Roger	467	" The Squire said something in a very low voice . Both father and daughter strained their ears to hear what it was . They both believed it to be , "
281844	281866	281842	281842	Osborne	234	" And Mr. Gibson spoke on that belief . He spoke more quietly than Molly had ever heard him do before . "

282076	282119	282068	282068	you	6169	" Molly began . Her voice sounded high and unnatural to herself , as if some one else was speaking , but she made her words clear . The Squire did not attempt to listen , at first , at any rate . "

282233	282269	282270	282271	His wife	1016	" Now the Squire was all attention ; for the first time his tear - swollen eyes met the eyes of another , and he looked at Molly with searching anxiety , as he repeated , "

282425	282465	282405	282405	he	7226	" She looked at her father , as if questioning him as to the desirableness of telling the few further particulars that she knew . The Squire 's mouth was dry and stiff , but he tried to say , "
282470	282480	282481	282481	He	7226	" And Molly understood the half - formed words . "

There was something touching in the Squire 's wistful looks after Molly as she moved about . A stranger might have imagined her to be his daughter instead of Mr. Gibson 's . The meek , broken - down , considerate ways of the bereaved father never showed themselves more strongly than when he called them back to his chair , out of which he seemed too languid to rise , and said , as if by an after - thought : "

But Mr. Gibson had been slightly dubious of the full legality of the marriage , and had not felt inclined to speak of it to his wife until that had been ascertained one way or another .

286366	286568	286317	286317	you	221	" So Molly went back in the carriage alone , wondering how she should find the Squire ; wondering what discoveries he had made among Osborne 's papers , and at what conviction he would have arrived . CHAPTER LIII . UNLOOKED - FOR ARRIVALS . Robinson opened the door for Molly almost before the carriage had fairly drawn up at the Hall , and told her that the Squire had been very anxious for her return , and had more than once sent him to an upstairs window , from which a glimpse of the hill - road between Hollingford and Hamley could be caught , to know if the carriage was not yet in sight . Molly went into the drawing - room . The Squire was standing in the middle of the floor awaiting her -- in fact , longing to go out and meet her , but restrained by a feeling of solemn etiquette , which prevented his moving about as usual in that house of mourning . He held a paper in his hands , which were trembling with excitement and emotion ; and four or five open letters were strewed on a table near him . "
286574	286578	286579	286579	she	6287	" he began ; "
286660	286733	286775	286775	He	6288	" He sate down in the nearest chair and groaned . Molly took a seat by him , and read the legal paper , the perusal of which was not needed to convince her of the fact of the marriage . She held it in her hand after she had finished reading it , waiting for the Squire 's next coherent words ; for he kept talking to himself in broken sentences . "
286847	286867	286808	286808	They	6296	" He covered his face , and moved himself backward and forward till Molly could bear it no longer . "
286873	286877	286879	286879	I	0	" said she : "
286885	286914	286879	286879	I	0	" At another time she would not have asked ; but she was driven to it now by her impatience of the speechless grief of the old man . "

286961	287041	286943	286943	I	0	" Molly 's knowledge of written French of the present day was not so great as her knowledge of the French of the _ Mmoires de Sully _ , and neither the spelling nor the writing of the letters was of the best ; but she managed to translate into good enough colloquial English some innocent sentences of love , and submission to Osborne 's will -- as if his judgment was infallible,--and of faith in his purposes,--little sentences in "
287044	287110	287195	287196	his wife--	6212	" that went home to the Squire 's heart . Perhaps if Molly had read French more easily she might not have translated them into such touching , homely , broken words . Here and there , there were expressions in English ; these the hungry - hearted Squire had read while waiting for Molly 's return . Every time she stopped , he said , "
287114	287155	287195	287196	his wife--	6212	" He kept his face shaded , and only repeated those two words at every pause . She got up to find some more of Aime 's letters . In examining the papers , she came upon one in particular . "
287167	287172	287195	287196	his wife--	6212	" ( reading aloud ) "

287203	287220	287222	287222	Roger	511	" said the Squire , his voice breaking now , and stretching forth his eager hand . "
287465	287472	287464	287464	Osborne	511	" ( he burst out ) , "
287510	287814	287500	287500	I	0	" From the general tone of the letters , Molly doubted if the mother would consent , so easily as the Squire seemed to expect , to be parted from her child ; the letters were not very wise , perhaps ( though of this Molly never thought ) , but a heart full of love spoke tender words in every line . Still , it was not for Molly to talk of this doubt of hers just then ; but rather to dwell on the probable graces and charms of the little Roger Stephen Osborne Hamley . She let the Squire exhaust himself in wondering as to the particulars of every event , helping him out in conjectures ; and both of them , from their imperfect knowledge of possibilities , made the most curious , fantastic , and improbable guesses at the truth . And so that day passed over , and the night came . There were not many people who had any claim to be invited to the funeral , and of these Mr. Gibson and the Squire 's hereditary man of business had taken charge . But when Mr. Gibson came , early on the following morning , Molly referred the question to him , which had suggested itself to her mind , though apparently not to the Squire 's , what intimation of her loss should be sent to the widow , living solitary near Winchester , watching and waiting , if not for his coming who lay dead in his distant home , at least for his letters . One from her had already come , in her foreign handwriting , to the post - office to which all her communications were usually sent , but of course they at the Hall knew nothing of this . "

288342	288518	288519	288520	the Frenchwoman	6343	" The writing this letter was rather difficult work for Molly , and she tore up two or three copies before she could manage it to her satisfaction ; and at last , in despair of ever doing it better , she sent it off without re - reading it . The next day was easier ; the fact of Osborne 's death was told briefly and tenderly . But when this second letter was sent off , Molly 's heart began to bleed for the poor creature , bereft of her husband , in a foreign land , and he at a distance from her , dead and buried without her ever having had the chance of printing his dear features on her memory by one last long lingering look . With her thoughts full of the unknown Aime , Molly talked much about her that day to the Squire . He would listen for ever to any conjecture , however wild , about the grandchild , but perpetually winced away from all discourse about "
288522	288971	288519	288520	the Frenchwoman	6343	" as he called her ; not unkindly , but to his mind she was simply the Frenchwoman -- chattering , dark - eyed , demonstrative , and possibly even rouged . He would treat her with respect as his son 's widow , and would try even not to think upon the female inveiglement in which he believed . He would make her an allowance to the extent of his duty : but he hoped and trusted he might never be called upon to see her . His solicitor , Gibson , anybody and everybody , should be called upon to form a phalanx of defence against that danger . And all this time a little young grey - eyed woman was making her way,--not towards him , but towards the dead son , whom as yet she believed to be her living husband . She knew she was acting in defiance of his expressed wish ; but he had never dismayed her with any expression of his own fears about his health ; and she , bright with life , had never contemplated death coming to fetch away one so beloved . He was ill -- very ill , the letter from the strange girl said that ; but Aime had nursed her parents , and knew what illness was . The French doctor had praised her skill and neat - handedness as a nurse , and even if she had been the clumsiest of women , was he not her husband -- her all ? And was she not his wife , whose place was by his pillow ? So , without even as much reasoning as has been here given , Aime made her preparations , swallowing down the tears that would overflow her eyes , and drop into the little trunk she was packing so neatly . And by her side , on the ground , sate the child , now nearly two years old ; and for him Aime had always a smile and a cheerful word . Her servant loved her and trusted her ; and the woman was of an age to have had experience of humankind . Aime had told her that her husband was ill , and the servant had known enough of the household history to be aware that as yet Aime was not his acknowledged wife . But she sympathized with the prompt decision of her mistress to go to him directly , wherever he was . Caution comes from education of one kind or another , and Aime was not dismayed by warnings ; only the woman pleaded hard for the child to be left . "
288977	288981	288983	288983	he	6344	" she said ; "
289005	289011	288995	288996	his father	975	" To which Aime replied , "
289032	289057	289029	289029	her	7714	" ( which was not true ; but there was sufficient truth in it to make it believed by both mistress and servant ) , "
289078	289129	289066	289066	he	6350	" So Aime caught the evening coach to London at the nearest cross - road , Martha standing by as chaperon and friend to see her off , and handing her in the large lusty child , already crowing with delight at the sight of the horses . There was a "
289131	289221	289066	289066	he	6350	" shop , kept by a Frenchwoman , whose acquaintance Aime had made in the days when she was a London nursemaid , and thither she betook herself , rather than to an hotel , to spend the few night - hours that intervened before the Birmingham coach started at early morning . She slept or watched on a sofa in the parlour , for spare - bed there was none ; but Madame Pauline came in betimes with a good cup of coffee for the mother , and of "
289224	289246	289247	289247	him	6352	" for the boy ; and they went off again into the wide world , only thinking of , only seeking the "
289249	289422	289247	289247	him	6352	" who was everything human to both . Aime remembered the sound of the name of the village where Osborne had often told her that he alighted from the coach to walk home ; and though she could never have spelt the strange uncouth word , yet she spoke it with pretty slow distinctness to the guard , asking him in her broken English when they should arrive there ? Not till four o'clock . Alas ! and what might happen before then ! Once with him she would have no fear ; she was sure that she could bring him round ; but what might not happen before he was in her tender care ? She was a very capable person in many ways , though so childish and innocent in others . She made up her mind to the course she should pursue when the coach set her down at Feversham . She asked for a man to carry her trunk , and show her the way to Hamley Hall . "

289453	289534	289447	289447	I	0	" said she , hastening off after the wheelbarrow in which her trunk was going , and breathlessly struggling to keep up with it , her heavy child asleep in her arms . Her pulses beat all over her body ; she could hardly see out of her eyes . To her , a foreigner , the drawn blinds of the house , when she came in sight of it , had no significance ; she hurried , stumbled on . "
289542	289550	289540	289540	missus	6353	" asked the boots from the inn . "
289555	289564	289540	289540	missus	6353	" said she . And the front door was "
289569	289848	289540	289540	missus	6353	" Molly was sitting with the Squire in the darkened drawing - room , reading out her translations of Aime 's letters to her husband . The Squire was never weary of hearing them ; the very sound of Molly 's voice soothed and comforted him , it was so sweet and low . And he pulled her up , much as a child does , if on a second reading of the same letter she substituted one word for another . The house was very still this afternoon,--still as it had been now for several days ; every servant in it , however needlessly , moving about on tiptoe , speaking below the breath , and shutting doors as softly as might be . The nearest noise or stir of active life was that of the rooks in the trees , who were beginning their spring chatter of business . Suddenly , through this quiet , there came a ring at the front - door bell that sounded , and went on sounding , through the house , pulled by an ignorant vigorous hand . Molly stopped reading ; she and the Squire looked at each other in surprised dismay . Perhaps a thought of Roger 's sudden ( and impossible ) return was in the mind of each ; but neither spoke . They heard Robinson hurrying to answer the unwonted summons . They listened ; but they heard no more . There was little more to hear . When the old servant opened the door , a lady with a child in her arms stood there . She gasped out her ready - prepared English sentence,-- "
289869	289956	289864	289864	I	0	" Robinson had been aware that there was some mystery , long suspected by the servants , and come to light at last to the master,--he had guessed that there was a young woman in the case ; but when she stood there before him , asking for her dead husband as if he were living , any presence of mind Robinson might have had forsook him ; he could not tell her the truth,--he could only leave the door open , and say to her , "
289965	290005	289960	289960	I	0	" and betake himself to the drawing - room where Molly was , he knew . He went up to her in a flutter and a hurry , and whispered something to her which turned her white with dismay . "

290147	290173	290143	290143	You	0	" Molly stood for a moment or two , irresolute . She , too , shrank from the interview . Robinson put in his word : "
290199	290233	290192	290192	I	0	" At this instant the door softly opened , and right into the midst of them came the little figure in grey , looking ready to fall with the weight of her child . "

290271	290297	290303	290304	my husband	8992	" Molly did not answer , except that at such moments the eyes speak solemnly and comprehensively . Aime read their meaning . All she said was,--"He
290309	290347	290306	290307	my husband	8992	" Her arms relaxed , her figure swayed , the child screamed and held out his arms for help . That help was given him by his grandfather , just before Aime fell senseless on the floor . "
290352	290419	290420	290420	MAMAN	515	" cried the little fellow , now striving and fighting to get back to her , where she lay ; he fought so lustily that the Squire had to put him down , and he crawled to the poor inanimate body , behind which sat Molly , holding the head ; whilst Robinson rushed away for water , wine , and more womankind .

290472	290555	290556	290556	Maman	515	" said Molly , quickly . She was untying the bonnet , and taking off the worn , but neatly mended gloves ; there was the soft luxuriant black hair , shading the pale , innocent face,--the little notable - looking brown hands , with the wedding - ring for sole ornament . The child clustered his fingers round one of hers , and nestled up against her with his plaintive cry , getting more and more into a burst of wailing : "
290560	290639	290556	290556	Maman	515	" At the growing acuteness of his imploring , her hand moved , her lips quivered , consciousness came partially back . She did not open her eyes , but great heavy tears stole out from beneath her eyelashes . Molly held her head against her own breast ; and they tried to give her wine,--which she shrank from -- water , which she did not reject ; that was all . At last she tried to speak . "
290644	290648	290556	290556	Maman	515	" she said , "
290657	290746	290556	290556	Maman	515	" So Molly and the woman lifted her up and carried her away , and laid her on the bed , in the best bed - chamber in the house , and darkened the already shaded light . She was like an unconscious corpse herself , in that she offered neither assistance nor resistance to all that they were doing . But just before Molly was leaving the room to take up her watch outside the door , she felt rather than heard that Aime spoke to her . "
290755	290897	290556	290556	Maman	515	" But when they brought her food herself , she only shrank away and turned her face to the wall without a word . In the hurry , the child had been left with Robinson and the Squire . For some unknown , but most fortunate reason , he took a dislike to Robinson 's red face and hoarse voice , and showed a most decided preference for his grandfather . When Molly came down she found the Squire feeding the child , with more of peace upon his face than there had been for all these days . The boy was every now and then leaving off taking his bread and milk to show his dislike to Robinson by word and gesture : a proceeding which only amused the old servant , while it highly delighted the more favoured Squire . "
290921	290953	290912	290912	I	0	" said Molly , volunteering this account , for the Squire was for the moment too much absorbed in his grandson to ask many questions . Robinson put in his word : "

291032	291037	291002	291002	she	6366	" said the Squire . "
291057	291230	291055	291055	him	6374	" But Molly stole out , and sent off a lad to Hollingford with a note to her father . Her heart had warmed towards the poor stranger , and she felt uncertain as to what ought to be the course pursued in her case . She went up from time to time to look at the girl , scarce older than herself , who lay there with her eyes open , but as motionless as death . She softly covered her over , and let her feel the sympathetic presence from time to time ; and that was all she was allowed to do . The Squire was curiously absorbed in the child , but Molly 's supreme tenderness was for the mother . Not but what she admired the sturdy , gallant , healthy little fellow , whose every limb , and square inch of clothing , showed the tender and thrifty care that had been taken of him . By - and - by the Squire said in a whisper,-- "

291482	291487	291458	291458	she	265	" said the Squire . "
291550	291755	291534	291534	We	6394	" Molly wondered in her heart about this going away , on which the Squire seemed fully resolved . She was sure that he intended to keep the child ; perhaps he had a legal right to do so;--but would the mother ever part from it ? Her father , however , would solve the difficulty,--her father , whom she always looked to as so clear - seeing and experienced . She watched and waited for his coming . The February evening drew on ; the child lay asleep in the Squire 's arms till his grandfather grew tired , and laid him down on the sofa : the large square - cornered yellow sofa upon which Mrs. Hamley used to sit , supported by pillows in a half - reclining position . Since her time it had been placed against the wall , and had served merely as a piece of furniture to fill up the room . But once again a human figure was lying upon it ; a little human creature , like a cherub in some old Italian picture . The Squire remembered his wife as he put the child down . He thought of her as he said to Molly,-- "
291763	291777	291778	291778	she	6396	" But Molly thought of the poor young widow upstairs . Aime was her "
291779	291952	291534	291534	We	6394	" at the first moment . Presently,--but it seemed a long long time first,--she heard the quick prompt sounds which told of her father 's arrival . In he came -- to the room as yet only lighted by the fitful blaze of the fire . CHAPTER LIV . MOLLY GIBSON 'S WORTH IS DISCOVERED . Mr. Gibson came in rubbing his hands after his frosty ride . Molly judged from the look in his eye that he had been fully informed of the present state of things at the Hall by some one . But he simply went up to and greeted the Squire , and waited to hear what was said to him . The Squire was fumbling at the taper on the writing - table , and before he answered much he lighted it , and signing to his friend to follow him , he went softly to the sofa and showed him the sleeping child , taking the utmost care not to arouse it by flare or sound . "
291962	291978	291957	291960	a fine young gentleman	6397	" said Mr. Gibson , returning to the fire rather sooner than the Squire expected . "
292022	292047	292015	292015	she	1887	" He spoke without exactly addressing any one , so that either Molly or the Squire might answer as they liked . The Squire said,-- "
292171	292181	292182	292182	Papa	180	" Molly grew impatient on the mother 's behalf . "
292208	292307	292200	292200	you	180	" Mr. Gibson followed her upstairs , and the Squire came too , thinking that he would do his duty now , and even feeling some self - satisfaction at conquering his desire to stay with the child . They went into the room where she had been taken . She lay quite still in the same position as at first . Her eyes were open and tearless , fixed on the wall . Mr. Gibson spoke to her , but she did not answer ; he lifted her hand to feel her pulse ; she never noticed . "
292322	292552	292200	292200	you	180	" he said to Molly . But when he tried to put the wine into her mouth as she lay there on her side , she made no effort to receive or swallow it , and it ran out upon the pillow . Mr. Gibson left the room abruptly ; Molly chafed the little inanimate hand ; the Squire stood by in dumb dismay , touched in spite of himself by the death - in - life of one so young , and who must have been so much beloved . Mr. Gibson came back two steps at a time ; he was carrying the half - awakened child in his arms . He did not scruple to rouse him into yet further wakefulness -- did not grieve to hear him begin to wail and cry . His eyes were on the figure upon the bed , which at that sound quivered all through ; and when her child was laid at her back , and began caressingly to scramble yet closer , Aime turned round , and took him in her arms , and lulled him and soothed him with the soft wo nt of mother 's love . Before she lost this faint consciousness , which was habit or instinct rather than thought , Mr. Gibson spoke to her in French . The child 's one word of "
292554	292979	292200	292200	you	180	" had given him this clue . It was the language sure to be most intelligible to her dulled brain ; and as it happened,--only Mr. Gibson did not think of that -- it was the language in which she had been commanded , and had learnt to obey . Mr. Gibson 's tongue was a little stiff at first , but by - and - by he spoke it with all his old readiness . He extorted from her short answers at first , then longer ones , and from time to time he plied her with little drops of wine , until some further nourishment should be at hand . Molly was struck by her father 's low tones of comfort and sympathy , although she could not follow what was said quickly enough to catch the meaning of what passed . By - and - by , however , when her father had done all that he could , and they were once more downstairs , he told them more about her journey than they yet knew . The hurry , the sense of acting in defiance of a prohibition , the over - mastering anxiety , the broken night , and fatigue of the journey , had ill prepared her for the shock at last , and Mr. Gibson was seriously alarmed for the consequences . She had wandered strangely in her replies to him ; he had perceived that she was wandering , and had made great efforts to recall her senses ; but Mr. Gibson foresaw that some bodily illness was coming on , and stopped late that night , arranging many things with Molly and the Squire . One -- the only -- comfort arising from her state was the probability that she would be entirely unconscious by the morrow -- the day of the funeral . Worn out by the contending emotions of the day , the Squire seemed now unable to look beyond the wrench and trial of the next twelve hours . He sate with his head in his hands , declining to go to bed , refusing to dwell on the thought of his grandchild -- not three hours ago such a darling in his eyes . Mr. Gibson gave some instructions to one of the maid - servants as to the watch she was to keep by Mrs. Osborne Hamley , and insisted on Molly 's going to bed . When she pleaded the apparent necessity of her staying up , he said,-- "
293121	293122	293126	293126	she	265	" "
293135	293136	293126	293126	she	265	" "
293204	293654	293952	293952	I	0	" He had given Molly 's thoughts a turn , which was what he wanted to do . Molly could not help remembering Mr. Henderson , and his offer , and all the consequent hints ; and wondering , and wishing -- what did she wish ? or had she been falling asleep ? Before she had quite ascertained this point she was asleep in reality . After this , long days passed over in a monotonous round of care ; for no one seemed to think of Molly 's leaving the Hall during the woeful illness that befell Mrs. Osborne Hamley . It was not that her father allowed her to take much active part in the nursing ; the Squire gave him _ carte - blanche _ , and he engaged two efficient hospital nurses to watch over the unconscious Aime ; but Molly was needed to receive the finer directions as to her treatment and diet . It was not that she was wanted for the care of the little boy ; the Squire was too jealous of the child 's exclusive love for that , and one of the housemaids was employed in the actual physical charge of him ; but he needed some one to listen to his incontinence of language , both when his passionate regret for his dead son came uppermost , and also when he had discovered some extraordinary charm in that son 's child ; and again when he was oppressed with the uncertainty of Aime 's long - continued illness . Molly was not so good or so bewitching a listener to ordinary conversation as Cynthia ; but where her heart was interested her sympathy was deep and unfailing . In this case she only wished that the Squire could really feel that Aime was not the encumbrance which he evidently considered her to be . Not that he would have acknowledged the fact , if it had been put before him in plain words . He fought against the dim consciousness of what was in his mind ; he spoke repeatedly of patience when no one but himself was impatient ; he would often say that when she grew better she must not be allowed to leave the Hall until she was perfectly strong , when no one was even contemplating the remotest chance of her leaving her child , excepting only himself . Molly once or twice asked her father if she might not speak to the Squire , and represent the hardship of sending her away -- the improbability that she would consent to quit her boy , and so on ; but Mr. Gibson only replied,-- "
293673	293834	293952	293952	I	0	" It was well that Molly was such a favourite with the old servants ; for she had frequently to restrain and to control . To be sure , she had her father 's authority to back her ; and they were aware that where her own comfort , ease , or pleasure was concerned she never interfered , but submitted to their will . If the Squire had known of the want of attendance to which she submitted with the most perfect meekness , as far as she herself was the only sufferer , he would have gone into a towering rage . But Molly hardly thought of it , so anxious was she to do all she could for others , and to remember the various charges which her father gave her in his daily visits . Perhaps he did not spare her enough ; she was willing and uncomplaining ; but one day after Mrs. Osborne Hamley had "
293839	293918	293952	293952	I	0	" as the nurses called it , when she was lying weak as a new - born baby , but with her faculties all restored , and her fever gone,--when spring buds were blooming out , and spring birds sang merrily,--Molly answered to her father 's sudden questioning that she felt unaccountably weary ; that her head ached heavily , and that she was aware of a sluggishness of thought which it required a painful effort to overcome . "
293924	293940	293952	293952	I	0	" said Mr. Gibson , with a quick pang of anxiety , almost of remorse . "
293963	294029	293960	293960	I	0	" And off he went in search of the Squire . He had a good long walk before he came upon Mr. Hamley in a field of spring wheat , where the women were weeding , his little grandson holding to his finger in the intervals of short walks of inquiry into the dirtiest places , which was all his sturdy little limbs could manage . "
294141	294142	294122	294122	she	7653	" "
294190	294210	294182	294182	I	0	" Mr. Gibson 's voice sounded as if he was choking a little as he said these last words . "
294215	294253	294254	294254	I	0	" said the Squire , setting the child down . He had been holding him in his arms the last few minutes : but now he wanted all his eyes to look into Mr. Gibson 's face . "
294257	294269	294254	294254	I	0	" said he , catching hold of Mr. Gibson 's arm , "

294296	294303	294254	294254	I	0	" said Mr. Gibson , hastily . "
294316	294364	294365	294365	I	0	" and he turned away to go to the house . But the Squire left his field and his weeders , and kept at Mr. Gibson 's side . He wanted to speak , but his heart was so full he did not know what to say . "
294370	294377	294365	294365	I	0	" he got out at last , "
294417	294418	294415	294415	you	158	" "
294424	294732	294415	294415	you	158	" said Mr. Gibson , almost savagely . But any hastiness of temper was instinctively understood by the Squire ; and he was not offended , though he did not speak again till they reached the house . Then he went to order the carriage , and stood by sorrowful enough while the horses were being put in . He felt as if he should not know what to do without Molly ; he had never known her value , he thought , till now . But he kept silence on this view of the case ; which was a praiseworthy effort on the part of one who usually let by - standers see and hear as much of his passing feelings as if he had had a window in his breast . He stood by while Mr. Gibson helped the faintly - smiling , tearful Molly into the carriage . Then the Squire mounted on the step and kissed her hand ; but when he tried to thank her and bless her , he broke down ; and as soon as he was once more safely on the ground , Mr. Gibson cried out to the coachman to drive on . And so Molly left Hamley Hall . From time to time her father rode up to the window , and made some little cheerful and apparently careless remark . When they came within two miles of Hollingford , he put spurs to his horse , and rode briskly past the carriage windows , kissing his hand to the occupant as he did so . He went on to prepare her home for Molly : when she arrived Mrs. Gibson was ready to greet her . Mr. Gibson had given one or two of his bright , imperative orders , and Mrs. Gibson was feeling rather lonely "
294743	294757	294415	294415	you	158	" as she phrased it , to herself as well as to others . "

294907	294971	294974	294974	Hyacinth	390	" He did not leave her till he had seen her laid on a sofa in a darkened room , with some slight pretence of reading in her hand . Then he came away , leading his wife , who turned round at the door to kiss her hand to Molly , and make a little face of unwillingness to be dragged away . "
294976	294991	294974	294974	Hyacinth	390	" said he , as he took his wife into the drawing - room , "

295179	295274	295161	295162	Mr. Henderson	449	" For an instant , Mr. Gibson thought that it was easy enough for his wife to be cheerful , with the pleasant thoughts and evident anticipations she had in her mind , but a little more difficult for him to put off his doleful looks while his own child lay in a state of suffering and illness which might be the precursor of a still worse malady . But he was always a man for immediate action as soon as he had resolved on the course to be taken ; and he knew that "
295290	295371	295372	295372	Molly	221	" The illness which he apprehended came upon Molly ; not violently or acutely , so that there was any immediate danger to be dreaded ; but making a long pull upon her strength , which seemed to lessen day by day , until at last her father feared that she might become a permanent invalid . There was nothing very decided or alarming to tell Cynthia , and Mrs. Gibson kept the dark side from her in her letters . "
295379	295381	295372	295372	Molly	221	" or "
295400	295539	295382	295382	Molly	221	" such little sentences told nothing of Molly 's real state . But then , as Mrs. Gibson said to herself , it would be a pity to disturb Cynthia 's pleasure by telling her much about Molly ; indeed , there was not much to tell , one day was so like another . But it so happened that Lady Harriet,--who came whenever she could to sit awhile with Molly , at first against Mrs. Gibson 's will , and afterwards with her full consent,--for reasons of her own , Lady Harriet wrote a letter to Cynthia , to which she was urged by Mrs. Gibson . It fell out in this manner:--One day , when Lady Harriet was sitting in the drawing - room for a few minutes after she had been with Molly , she said,-- "

295756	295836	295751	295751	she	7255	" said Mrs. Gibson , who also took into consideration the reflection of aristocratic honour that would fall upon Cynthia if she had a letter from Lady Harriet while at Mr. Kirkpatrick 's . So she gave the address , and Lady Harriet wrote . All the first part of the letter was taken up with apology and commissions ; but then , never doubting but that Cynthia was aware of Molly 's state , she went on to say-- "
295898	295989	295990	295990	Cynthia	265	" The day but one after this letter was despatched , Cynthia walked into the drawing - room at home with as much apparent composure as if she had left it not an hour before . Mrs. Gibson was dozing , but believing herself to be reading ; she had been with Molly the greater part of the morning , and now after her lunch , and the invalid 's pretence of early dinner , she considered herself entitled to some repose . She started up as Cynthia came in : "

Cynthia did not reply on the instant ; she poured herself out some water with great deliberation , and then said,-- "

296920	296957	296909	296909	You	7219	" This to Cynthia . Molly 's delight at seeing her showed itself first in a few happy tears ; and then in soft caresses and inarticulate sounds of love . Once or twice she began , "
296964	297134	297141	297142	my dear	7219	" and there she stopped short . But the eloquence of these five words sank deep into Cynthia 's heart . She had returned just at the right time , when Molly wanted the gentle fillip of the society of a fresh and yet a familiar person . Cynthia 's tact made her talkative or silent , gay or grave , as the varying humour of Molly required . She listened , too , with the semblance , if not the reality , of unwearied interest , to Molly 's continual recurrence to all the time of distress and sorrow at Hamley Hall , and to the scenes which had then so deeply impressed themselves upon her susceptible nature . Cynthia instinctively knew that the repetition of all these painful recollections would ease the oppressed memory , which refused to dwell on anything but what had occurred at a time of feverish disturbance of health . So she never interrupted Molly , as Mrs. Gibson had so frequently done , with--"You
297151	297154	297145	297145	us	6484	" or , "
297211	297372	297373	297374	the doctor	1067	" So Molly 's health and spirits improved rapidly after Cynthia 's return : and although she was likely to retain many of her invalid habits during the summer , she was able to take drives , and enjoy the fine weather ; it was only her as yet tender spirits that required a little management . All the Hollingford people forgot that they had ever thought of her except as a darling of the town ; and each in his or her way showed kind interest in her father 's child . Miss Browning and Miss Phoebe considered it quite a privilege that they were allowed to see her a fortnight or three weeks before any one else ; Mrs. Goodenough , spectacles on nose , stirred dainty messes in a silver saucepan for Molly 's benefit ; the Towers sent books , and forced fruit , and new caricatures , and strange and delicate poultry ; humble patients of "

When she was at the worst , he rode over every day to hear the smallest detail , facing even Mrs. Gibson ( his abomination ) if her husband was not at home , to ask and hear , and ask and hear , till the tears were unconsciously stealing down his cheeks . Every resource of his heart , or his house , or his lands was searched and tried , if it could bring a moment 's pleasure to her ; and whatever it might be that came from him , at her very worst time , it brought out a dim smile upon her face . CHAPTER LV . AN ABSENT LOVER RETURNS . [ Illustration ( untitled ) ] And now it was late June ; and to Molly 's and her father 's extreme urgency in pushing , and Mr. and Mrs. Kirkpatrick 's affectionate persistency in pulling , Cynthia had yielded , and had gone back to finish her interrupted visit in London , but not before the bruit of her previous sudden return to nurse Molly had told strongly in her favour in the fluctuating opinion of the little town . Her affair with Mr. Preston was thrust into the shade ; while every one was speaking of her warm heart . Under the gleam of Molly 's recovery everything assumed a rosy hue , as indeed became the time when actual roses were fully in bloom . One morning Mrs. Gibson brought Molly a great basket of flowers , that had been sent from the Hall . Molly still breakfasted in bed , but she had just come down , and was now well enough to arrange the flowers for the drawing - room , and as she did so with these blossoms , she made some comments on each .

But Molly kept her place in the drawing - room all the time , not even going to take her customary siesta , so anxious was she to hear everything about Roger 's return , which as yet appeared to her almost incredible . But it was quite natural in reality ; the long monotony of her illness had made her lose all count of time . When Roger left England , his idea was to coast round Africa on the eastern side until he reached the Cape ; and thence to make what further journey or voyage might seem to him best in pursuit of his scientific objects . To Cape Town all his letters had been addressed of late ; and there , two months before , he had received the intelligence of Osborne 's death , as well as Cynthia 's hasty letter of relinquishment . He did not consider that he was doing wrong in returning to England immediately , and reporting himself to the gentlemen who had sent him out , with a full explanation of the circumstances relating to Osborne 's private marriage and sudden death . He offered , and they accepted his offer , to go out again for any time that they might think equivalent to the five months he was yet engaged to them for . They were most of them gentlemen of property , and saw the full importance of proving the marriage of an eldest son , and installing his child as the natural heir to a long - descended estate . This much information , but in a more condensed form , Mr. Gibson gave to Molly , in a very few minutes . She sat up on her sofa , looking very pretty with the flush on her cheeks , and the brightness in her eyes . "

That he felt all the awkwardness of his position towards Mrs. Gibson -- that he was in reality suffering pain all the time -- was but too evident to Molly ; but , of course , Mrs. Gibson saw nothing of this in her gratification at the proper respect paid to her by one whose name was in the newspapers that chronicled his return , and about whom already Lord Cumnor and the Towers family had been making inquiry . Molly was sitting in her pretty white invalid 's dress , half reading , half dreaming , for the June air was so clear and ambient , the garden so full of bloom , the trees so full of leaf , that reading by the open window was only a pretence at such a time ; besides which , Mrs. Gibson continually interrupted her with remarks about the pattern of her worsted work . It was after lunch -- orthodox calling time , when Maria ushered in Mr. Roger Hamley . Molly started up ; and then stood shyly and quietly in her place while a bronzed , bearded , grave man came into the room , in whom she at first had to seek for the merry boyish face she knew by heart only two years ago . But months in the climates in which Roger had been travelling age as much as years in more temperate regions . And constant thought and anxiety while in daily peril of life deepen the lines of character upon the face . Moreover , the circumstances that had of late affected him personally were not of a nature to make him either buoyant or cheerful . But his voice was the same ; that was the first point of the old friend Molly caught , when he addressed her in a tone far softer than he used in speaking conventional politenesses to her stepmother .

To do something to put an end to it , she looked up , and showed him her beautiful soft grey eyes , which he never remembered to have noticed before . She smiled at him as she blushed still deeper , and said,-- "

When he was at the door he looked back , having , as he thought , a word more to say ; but he quite forgot what it was , for he surprised Molly 's intent gaze , and sudden confusion at discovery , and went away as soon as he could .

He did not see any exact necessity for this , it is true ; but he thought it might be advisable that she should know all the truth in which she was concerned , and he told his wife this . But she took the affair into her own management , and , although she apparently agreed with Mr. Gibson , she never named the affair to Cynthia ; all that she said to her was-- "

302236	302467	302233	302234	THE NEW	525	" The next morning saw Mrs. Gibson in a much more contented frame of mind . She had written and posted her letter , and the next thing was to keep Cynthia in what she called a reasonable state , or , in other words , to try and cajole her into docility . But it was so much labour lost . Cynthia had already received a letter from Mr. Henderson before she came down to breakfast,--a declaration of love , a proposal of marriage as clear as words could make it ; together with an intimation that , unable to wait for the slow delays of the post , he was going to follow her down to Hollingford , and would arrive at the same time that she had done herself on the previous day . Cynthia said nothing about this letter to any one . She came late into the breakfast - room , after Mr. and Mrs. Gibson had finished the actual business of the meal ; but her unpunctuality was quite accounted for by the fact that she had been travelling all the night before . Molly was not as yet strong enough to get up so early . Cynthia hardly spoke , and did not touch her food . Mr. Gibson went about his daily business , and Cynthia and her mother were left alone . "

302833	302910	302911	302911	You	265	" She said this to plague her mother , and lessen Mrs. Gibson 's exuberance of joy , it must be confessed ; for her mind was pretty well made up . But it did not affect Mrs. Gibson , who affixed even less truth to it than there really was . The idea of a residence in a new , strange country , among new , strange people , was not without allurement to Cynthia . "

302972	303181	302962	302962	you	265	" So , kissing her daughter , Mrs. Gibson left the room , intent on the lunch which should impress Mr. Henderson at once with an idea of family refinement . Cynthia went upstairs to Molly ; she was inclined to tell her about Mr. Henderson , but she found it impossible to introduce the subject naturally , so she left it to time to reveal the future as gradually as it might . Molly was tired with a bad night ; and her father , in his flying visit to his darling before going out , had advised her to stay upstairs for the greater part of the morning , and to keep quiet in her own room till after her early dinner , so Time had not a fair chance of telling her what he had in store in his budget . Mrs. Gibson sent an apology to Molly for not paying her her usual morning visit , and told Cynthia to give Mr. Henderson 's probable coming as a reason for her occupation downstairs . But Cynthia did no such thing . She kissed Molly , and sate silently by her , holding her hand ; till at length she jumped up , and said , "
303209	303420	303421	303422	Mrs. Gibson	199	" And Cynthia left her , and went to her own room , locked the door , and began to think . Some one was thinking about her at the same time , and it was not Mr. Henderson . Roger had heard from Mr. Gibson that Cynthia had come home , and he was resolving to go to her at once , and have one strong , manly attempt to overcome the obstacles whatever they might be -- and of their nature he was not fully aware -- that she had conjured up against the continuance of their relation to each other . He left his father -- he left them all -- and went off into the woods , to be alone until the time came when he might mount his horse and ride over to put his fate to the touch . He was as careful as ever not to interfere with the morning hours that were tabooed to him of old ; but waiting was very hard work when he knew that she was so near , and the time so near at hand . Yet he rode slowly , compelling himself to quietness and patience when he was once really on the way to her . "
303429	303454	303421	303422	Mrs. Gibson	199	" he asked of the servant , Maria , who opened the door . She was confused , but he did not notice it . "
303483	303598	303475	303476	Miss Gibson	187	" So he went upstairs , all his nerves on the strain for the coming interview with Cynthia . It was either a relief or a disappointment , he was not sure which , to find only Molly in the room:--Molly , half lying on the couch in the bow - window which commanded the garden ; draped in soft white drapery , very white herself , and a laced half - handkerchief tied over her head to save her from any ill effects of the air that blew in through the open window . He was so ready to speak to Cynthia that he hardly knew what to say to any one else . "
303608	303630	303599	303599	I	0	" he said to Molly , who sat up to receive him , and who suddenly began to tremble with emotion . "
303641	304004	303631	303631	I	0	" said she ; and then she was quite silent , hoping that he might go , and yet somehow wishing him to stay . But he took a chair and placed it near her , opposite to the window . He thought that surely Maria would tell Miss Kirkpatrick that she was wanted , and that at any moment he might hear her light quick footstep on the stairs . He felt he ought to talk , but he could not think of anything to say . The pink flush came out on Molly 's cheeks ; once or twice she was on the point of speaking , but again she thought better of it ; and the pauses between their faint disjointed remarks became longer and longer . Suddenly , in one of these pauses , the merry murmur of distant happy voices in the garden came nearer and nearer ; Molly looked more and more uneasy and flushed , and in spite of herself kept watching Roger 's face . He could see over her into the garden . A sudden deep colour overspread him , as if his heart had sent its blood out coursing at full gallop . Cynthia and Mr. Henderson had come in sight ; he eagerly talking to her as he bent forward to look into her face ; she , her looks half averted in pretty shyness , was evidently coquetting about some flowers , which she either would not give , or would not take . Just then , for the lovers had emerged from the shrubbery into comparatively public life , Maria was seen approaching ; apparently she had feminine tact enough to induce Cynthia to leave her present admirer , and to go a few steps to meet her to receive the whispered message that Mr. Roger Hamley was there , and wished to speak to her . Roger could see her startled gesture ; she turned back to say something to Mr. Henderson before coming towards the house . Now Roger spoke to Molly -- spoke hurriedly , spoke hoarsely .

Cynthia flew to the bell , summoned Maria , water , salts , wine , anything ; and as soon as Molly , gasping and miserable , became conscious again , she wrote a little pencil - note to Mr. Henderson , bidding him return to the "

He comforted himself for the long solitary afternoon by writing to tell all his friends of his happiness , and amongst them uncle and aunt Kirkpatrick , who received his letter by the same post as that discreet epistle of Mrs. Gibson 's , which she had carefully arranged to reveal as much as she wished , and no more .

He was handsome , without being conceited ; gentlemanly , without being foolishly fine . He talked easily , and never said a silly thing . He was perfectly well - appointed , yet never seemed to have given a thought to his dress . He was good - tempered and kind ; not without some of the cheerful flippancy of repartee which belonged to his age and profession , and which his age and profession are apt to take for wit . But he wanted something in Molly 's eyes -- at any rate , in this first interview , and in her heart of hearts she thought him rather commonplace . But of course she said nothing of this to Cynthia , who was evidently as happy as she could be . Mrs. Gibson , too , was in the seventh heaven of ecstasy , and spoke but little ; but what she did say , expressed the highest sentiments in the finest language . Mr. Gibson was not with them for long , but while he was there he was evidently studying the unconscious Mr. Henderson with his dark penetrating eyes . Mr. Henderson behaved exactly as he ought to have done to everybody : respectful to Mr. Gibson , deferential to Mrs. Gibson , friendly to Molly , devoted to Cynthia . The next time Mr. Gibson found Molly alone , he began,--"Well

Trousseaux , and preliminary ceremonies , he gave to the winds . Mr. Gibson , generous as usual , called Cynthia aside a morning or two after her engagement , and put a hundred - pound note into her hands . "

For as soon as Mr. Henderson had made his appearance in Hollingford , she had written a second letter , entreating them not to allude to anything she might have said in her first ; which she said was written in such excitement on discovering the real state of her daughter 's affections , that she had hardly known what she had said , and had exaggerated some things , and misunderstood others : all that she did know now was , that Mr. Henderson had just proposed to Cynthia , and was accepted , and that they were as happy as the day was long , and ( "
306030	306106	305865	305868	your smart young man	6647	" ) made a most lovely couple . So Mr. and Mrs. Kirkpatrick wrote back an equally agreeable letter , praising Mr. Henderson , admiring Cynthia , and generally congratulatory ; insisting into the bargain that the marriage should take place from their house in Hyde Park Street , and that Mr. and Mrs. Gibson and Molly should all come up and pay them a visit . There was a little postscript at the end . "
306158	306461	306151	306151	Helen	464	" This P.S. being in Helen 's handwriting . In her exultation at the general success of everything , and desire for sympathy , Mrs. Gibson read parts of this letter to Molly ; the postscript among the rest . It made a deeper impression on Molly than even the proposed kindness of the visit to London . There were some family consultations ; but the end of them all was that the Kirkpatrick invitation was accepted . There were many small reasons for this , which were openly acknowledged ; but there was one general and unspoken wish to have the ceremony performed out of the immediate neighbourhood of the two men whom Cynthia had previously -- rejected ; that was the word now to be applied to her treatment of them . So Molly was ordered and enjoined and entreated to become strong as soon as possible , in order that her health might not prevent her attending the marriage ; Mr. Gibson himself , though he thought it his duty to damp the exultant anticipations of his wife and her daughter , being not at all averse to the prospect of going to London , and seeing half - a - dozen old friends , and many scientific exhibitions , independently of the very fair amount of liking which he had for his host , Mr. Kirkpatrick himself . CHAPTER LVII . BRIDAL VISITS AND ADIEUX . The whole town of Hollingford came to congratulate and inquire into particulars . Some indeed -- Mrs. Goodenough at the head of this class of malcontents -- thought that they were defrauded of their right to a fine show by Cynthia 's being married in London . Even Lady Cumnor was moved into action . She , who had hardly ever paid calls "

She began a low - toned but nevertheless authoritative conversation with Clare about the details of the wedding , which lasted until she thought it fit to go , when she abruptly plucked Lady Harriet up , and carried her off in the very midst of a description she was giving to Cynthia about the delights of Spa , which was to be one of the resting - places of the newly - married couple on their wedding - tour . Nevertheless she prepared a handsome present for the bride : a Bible and a Prayer - book bound in velvet with silver - clasps ; and also a collection of household account - books , at the beginning of which Lady Cumnor wrote down with her own hand the proper weekly allowance of bread , butter , eggs , meat , and groceries per head , with the London prices of the articles , so that the most inexperienced housekeeper might ascertain whether her expenditure exceeded her means , as she expressed herself in the note which she sent with the handsome , dull present .

She was the only person there when Lady Harriet entered : the room was all in disorder , strewed with presents and paper , and pasteboard boxes , and half - displayed articles of finery . "

309184	309369	309370	309370	She	6739	" Molly 's heart sank within her at the prospect . Except on the one evening of her father 's wedding - day , she had never even seen the outside of the Towers since that unlucky day in her childhood when she had fallen asleep on Clare 's bed . She had a dread of the countess , a dislike to the house ; only it seemed as if it was a solution to the problem of what to do with her , which had been perplexing every one all morning , and so evidently that it had caused her much distress . She kept silence , though her lips quivered from time to time . Oh , if Miss Brownings had not chosen this very time of all others to pay their monthly visit to Miss Hornblower ! If she could only have gone there , and lived with them in their quaint , quiet , primitive way , instead of having to listen , without remonstrance , to hearing plans discussed about her , as if she was an inanimate chattel ! "
309540	309992	309993	309993	I	0	" So Cynthia came in , and demurely received the very proper present , and the equally correct congratulations , without testifying any very great delight or gratitude at either ; for she was quite quick enough to detect there was no great afflux of affection accompanying either . But when she heard her mother quickly recapitulating all the details of the plan for Molly , Cynthia 's eyes did sparkle with gladness ; and almost to Lady Harriet 's surprise , she thanked her as if she had conferred a personal favour upon her , Cynthia . Lady Harriet saw , too , that in a very quiet way , she had taken Molly 's hand , and was holding it all the time , as if loth to think of their approaching separation -- somehow , she and Lady Harriet were brought nearer together by this little action than they had ever been before . If Molly had hoped that her father might have raised some obstacles to the project , she was disappointed . But , indeed , she was satisfied when she perceived how he seemed to feel that , by placing her under the care of Lady Harriet and Parkes , he should be relieved from anxiety ; and how he spoke of this change of air and scene as being the very thing he had been wishing to secure for her ; country air , and absence of excitement as this would be ; for the only other place where he could have secured her these advantages , and at the same time sent her as an invalid , was to Hamley Hall ; and he dreaded the associations there with the beginning of her present illness . So Molly was driven off in state the next day , leaving her own home all in confusion with the assemblage of boxes and trunks in the hall , and all the other symptoms of the approaching departure of the family for London and the wedding . All the morning Cynthia had been with her in her room , attending to the arrangement of Molly 's clothes , instructing her what to wear with what , and rejoicing over the pretty smartnesses , which , having been prepared for her as bridesmaid , were now to serve as adornments for her visit to the Towers . Both Molly and Cynthia spoke about dress as if it was the very object of their lives ; for each dreaded the introduction of more serious subjects ; Cynthia more for Molly than herself . Only when the carriage was announced , and Molly was preparing to go downstairs , Cynthia said,-- "

310017	310021	310008	310008	I	0	" said Molly , "

310061	310098	310052	310052	I	0	" So they parted . Mr. Gibson was there in the hall to hand Molly in . He had ridden hard ; and was now giving her two or three last injunctions as to her health . "
310105	310109	310110	310110	I	0	" said he . "
310159	310321	310322	310322	You	6759	" They drove away , and until they were out of sight of the house , Molly had enough to do to keep returning the kisses of the hand wafted to her by her stepmother out of the drawing - room window , while at the same time her eyes were fixed on a white handkerchief fluttering out of the attic from which she herself had watched Roger 's departure nearly two years before . What changes time had brought ! When Molly arrived at the Towers she was convoyed into Lady Cumnor 's presence by Lady Harriet . It was a mark of respect to the lady of the house , which the latter knew that her mother would expect ; but she was anxious to get it over , and take Molly up into the room which she had been so busy arranging for her . Lady Cumnor was , however , very kind , if not positively gracious . "
310332	310336	310324	310325	Lady Harriet	179	" said she , "
310359	310393	310340	310340	she	179	" It was as near an approach to a joke as Lady Cumnor ever perpetrated , and from it Lady Harriet knew that her mother was pleased by Molly 's manners and appearance . "
310570	310717	310562	310562	he	193	" Molly was only too glad to allow Lady Harriet to decide everything for her . It had begun to rain , and was altogether a gloomy day for August ; and there was a small fire of scented wood burning cheerfully in the sitting - room appropriated to her . High up , it commanded a wide and pleasant view over the park , and from it could be seen the spire of Hollingford Church , which gave Molly a pleasant idea of neighbourhood to home . She was left alone , lying on the sofa -- books near her , wood crackling and blazing , wafts of wind bringing the beating rain against the window , and so enhancing the sense of indoor comfort by the outdoor contrast . Parkes was unpacking for her . Lady Harriet had introduced Parkes to Molly by saying , "
310768	310774	310757	310757	she	537	up,"--Parkes was smiling grimly all the time;--"so
310820	310836	310838	310838	you	221	" Parkes had begun her reign by putting Molly on the sofa , and saying , "
310872	310912	310913	310914	cousin Charles	6775	" For if Lady Harriet used familiar colloquialisms from time to time , she certainly had not learnt it from Parkes , who piqued herself on the correctness of her language . When Molly went down to lunch she found "
310916	311061	310914	310914	Charles	193	" with his aunt , Lady Cumnor . He was a certain Sir Charles Morton , the son of Lady Cumnor 's only sister : a plain , sandy - haired man of thirty - five or so ; immensely rich , very sensible , awkward , and reserved . He had had a chronic attachment , of many years ' standing , to his cousin , Lady Harriet , who did not care for him in the least , although it was the marriage very earnestly desired for her by her mother . Lady Harriet was , however , on friendly terms with him , ordered him about , and told him what to do , and what to leave undone , without having even a doubt as to the willingness of his obedience . She had given him his cue about Molly . "
311126	311471	311473	311473	you	6779	" So Sir Charles began this day at luncheon by taking Molly under his quiet protection . He did not say much to her ; but what he did say was thoroughly friendly and sympathetic ; and Molly began , as he and Lady Harriet intended that she should , to have a kind of pleasant reliance upon him . Then in the evening while the rest of the family were at dinner -- after Molly 's tea and hour of quiet repose , Parkes came and dressed her in some of the new clothes prepared for the Kirkpatrick visit , and did her hair in some new and pretty way , so that when Molly looked at herself in the cheval - glass , she scarcely knew the elegant reflection to be that of herself . She was fetched down by Lady Harriet into the great long formidable drawing - room , which as an interminable place of pacing , had haunted her dreams ever since her childhood . At the further end sat Lady Cumnor at her tapestry work ; the light of fire and candle seemed all concentrated on that one bright part where presently Lady Harriet made tea , and Lord Cumnor went to sleep , and Sir Charles read passages aloud from the _ Edinburgh Review _ to the three ladies at their work . When Molly went to bed she was constrained to admit that staying at the Towers as a visitor was rather pleasant than otherwise ; and she tried to reconcile old impressions with new ones , until she fell asleep . There was another comparatively quiet day before the expected guests began to arrive in the evening . Lady Harriet took Molly a drive in her little pony - carriage ; and for the first time for many weeks Molly began to feel the delightful spring of returning health ; the dance of youthful spirits in the fresh air cleared by the previous day 's rain . CHAPTER LVIII . REVIVING HOPES AND BRIGHTENING PROSPECTS . "
311526	312302	311520	311520	you	6779	" So Molly made her appearance at dinner that day ; and got to know , by sight at least , some of the most distinguished of the visitors at the Towers . The next day was Thursday , Cynthia 's wedding - day ; bright and fine in the country , whatever it might be in London . And there were several letters from the home - people awaiting Molly when she came downstairs to the late breakfast . For , every day , every hour , she was gaining strength and health , and she was unwilling to continue her invalid habits any longer than was necessary . She looked so much better that Sir Charles noticed it to Lady Harriet ; and several of the visitors spoke of her this morning as a very pretty , lady - like , and graceful girl . This was Thursday ; on Friday , as Lady Harriet had told her , some visitors from the more immediate neighbourhood were expected to stay over the Sunday ; but she had not mentioned their names , and when Molly went down into the drawing - room before dinner , she was almost startled by perceiving Roger Hamley in the centre of a group of gentlemen , who were all talking together eagerly , and , as it seemed to her , making him the object of their attention . He made a hitch in his conversation , lost the precise meaning of a question addressed to him , answered it rather hastily , and made his way to where Molly was sitting , a little behind Lady Harriet . He had heard that she was staying at the Towers , but he was almost as much surprised by hers , as she was by his unexpected appearance , for he had only seen her once or twice since his return from Africa , and then in the guise of an invalid . Now in her pretty evening dress , with her hair beautifully dressed , her delicate complexion flushed a little with timidity , yet her movements and manners bespeaking quiet ease , Roger hardly recognized her , although he acknowledged her identity . He began to feel that admiring deference which most young men experience when conversing with a very pretty girl : a sort of desire to obtain her good opinion in a manner very different to his old familiar friendliness . He was annoyed when Sir Charles , whose especial charge she still was , came up to take her in to dinner . He could not quite understand the smile of mutual intelligence that passed between the two , each being aware of Lady Harriet 's plan of sheltering Molly from the necessity of talking , and acting in conformity with her wishes as much as with their own . Roger found himself puzzling , and watching them from time to time during dinner . Again in the evening he sought her out , but found her again pre - occupied with one of the young men staying in the house , who had had the advantage of two days of mutual interest , and acquaintance with the daily events and jokes and anxieties of the family circle . Molly could not help wishing to break off all this trivial talk and to make room for Roger : she had so much to ask him about everything at the Hall ; he was , and had been such a stranger to them all for these last two months , and more . But though each wanted to speak to the other more than to any one else in the room , it so happened that everything seemed to conspire to prevent it . Lord Hollingford carried off Roger to the cluster of middle - aged men ; he was wanted to give his opinion upon some scientific subject . Mr. Ernulphus Watson , the young man referred to above , kept his place by Molly , as the prettiest girl in the room , and almost dazed her by his never - ceasing flow of clever small - talk . She looked so tired and pale at last that the ever - watchful Lady Harriet sent Sir Charles to the rescue , and after a few words with Lady Harriet , Roger saw Molly quietly leave the room ; and a sentence or two which he heard Lady Harriet address to her cousin made him know that it was for the night . Those sentences might bear another interpretation than the obvious one . "
312344	312489	312328	312329	Mr. Watson	540	" Why was Molly in Sir Charles 's charge ? why ? Then Roger remembered many little things that might serve to confirm the fancy he had got into his head ; and he went to bed puzzled and annoyed . It seemed to him such an incongruous , hastily - got - up sort of engagement , if engagement it really was . On Saturday they were more fortunate : they had a long _ tte--tte _ in the most public place in the house -- on a sofa in the hall where Molly was resting at Lady Harriet 's command before going upstairs after a walk . Roger was passing through , and saw her , and came to her . Standing before her , and making pretence of playing with the gold - fish in a great marble basin close at hand,-- "

Roger became annoyed at her so constantly conjecturing what he must be feeling on the subject of Cynthia 's marriage . With sympathetic perception she had discerned that the idea must give him pain ; and perhaps she also knew that he would dislike to show the pain ; but she had not the presence of mind or ready wit to give a skilful turn to the conversation . All this annoyed Roger , he could hardly tell why . He determined to take the metaphorical bull by the horns . Until that was done , his footing with Molly would always be insecure ; as it always is between two friends , who mutually avoid a subject to which their thoughts perpetually recur . "

There was no opportunity for renewed confidences that afternoon . Molly went a quiet decorous drive as fourth with two dowagers and one spinster ; but it was very pleasant to think that she should see him again at dinner , and again to - morrow . On the Sunday evening , as they all were sitting and loitering on the lawn before dinner , Roger went on with what he had to say about the position of his sister - in - law in his father 's house : the mutual bond between the mother and grandfather being the child ; who was also , through jealousy , the bone of contention and the severance . There were many little details to be given in order to make Molly quite understand the difficulty of the situations on both sides ; and the young man and the girl became absorbed in what they were talking about , and wandered away into the shade of the long avenue . Lady Harriet separated herself from a group and came up to Lord Hollingford , who was sauntering a little apart , and putting her arm within his with the familiarity of a favourite sister , she said,-- "

So Miss Brownings came to hear all the details of the wedding from Mrs. Gibson , and the history of Molly 's visit at the Towers as well . But Mrs. Gibson did not like this divided interest , and some of her old jealousy of Molly 's intimacy at the Towers had returned . "

She had to tell it all with a mental squint ; the surest way to spoil a narration . She was also subject to Mrs. Gibson 's perpetual corrections of little statements which she knew to be facts .

Wedding - cake and wine were brought in , and it was Molly 's duty to serve them out . But those last words of Mrs. Goodenough 's tingled in her ears , and she tried to interpret them to her own satisfaction in any way but the obvious one . And that , too , was destined to be confirmed ; for directly after Mrs. Goodenough took her leave , Mrs. Gibson desired Molly to carry away the tray to a table close to an open corner window , where the things might be placed in readiness for any future callers ; and underneath this open window went the path from the house - door to the road . Molly heard Mrs. Goodenough saying to her grand - daughter,-- "
316797	317080	316791	316791	she	199	" and then she passed out of hearing . Molly could have burst out crying , with a full sudden conviction of what Mrs. Goodenough had been alluding to : her sense of the impropriety of Molly 's going to visit at the Hall when Roger was at home . To be sure , Mrs. Goodenough was a commonplace , unrefined woman . Mrs. Gibson did not seem to have even noticed the allusion . Mr. Gibson took it all as a matter of course that Molly should go to the Hall as simply now , as she had done before . Roger had spoken of it in so straightforward a manner as showed he had no conception of its being an impropriety,--this visit,--this visit until now so happy a subject of anticipation . Molly felt as if she could never speak to any one of the idea to which Mrs. Goodenough 's words had given rise ; as if she could never be the first to suggest the notion of impropriety , which presupposed what she blushed to think of . Then she tried to comfort herself by reasoning . If it had been wrong , forward , or indelicate , really improper in the slightest degree , who would have been so ready as her father to put his veto upon it ? But reasoning was of no use after Mrs. Goodenough 's words had put fancies into Molly 's head . The more she bade these fancies begone the more they answered her ( as Daniel O'Rourke did the man in the moon , when he bade Dan get off his seat on the sickle , and go into empty space):--"The
317092	317840	317087	317087	we	6932	" One may smile at a young girl 's miseries of this kind ; but they are very real and stinging miseries to her . All that Molly could do was to resolve on a single eye to the dear old Squire , and his mental and bodily comforts ; to try and heal up any breaches which might have occurred between him and Aime ; and to ignore Roger as much as possible . Good Roger ! Kind Roger ! Dear Roger ! It would be very hard to avoid him as much as was consistent with common politeness ; but it would be right to do it ; and when she was with him she must be as natural as possible , or he might observe some difference ; but what was natural ? How much ought she avoid being with him ? Would he even notice if she was more chary of her company , more calculating of her words ? Alas ! the simplicity of their intercourse was spoilt henceforwards ! She made laws for herself ; she resolved to devote herself to the Squire and to Aime , and to forget Mrs. Goodenough 's foolish speeches ; but her perfect freedom was gone ; and with it half her chance -- that is to say , half her chance would have been lost over any strangers who had not known her before ; they would probably have thought her stiff and awkward , and apt to say things and then retract them . But she was so different from her usual self that Roger noticed the change in her as soon as she arrived at the Hall . She had carefully measured out the days of her visit ; they were to be exactly the same number as she had spent at the Towers . She feared lest if she stayed at the Hall a shorter time the Squire might be annoyed . Yet how charming the place looked in its early autumnal glow as she drove up ! And there was Roger at the hall - door , waiting to receive her , watching for her coming . And now he retreated , apparently to summon his sister - in - law , who came now timidly forwards in her deep widow 's mourning , holding her boy in her arms as if to protect her shyness ; but he struggled down , and ran towards the carriage , eager to greet his friend the coachman , and to obtain a promised ride . Roger did not say much himself ; he wanted to make Aime feel her place as daughter of the house ; but she was too timid to speak much . And she only took Molly by the hand and led her into the drawing - room , where , as if by a sudden impulse of gratitude for all the tender nursing she had received during her illness , she put her arms round Molly and kissed her long and well . And after that they came to be friends . It was nearly lunch - time , and the Squire always made his appearance at that meal , more for the pleasure of seeing his grandson eat his dinner than for any hunger of his own . To - day Molly quickly saw the whole state of the family affairs . She thought that even had Roger said nothing about them at the Towers , she should have seen that neither the father nor the daughter - in - law had as yet found the clue to each other 's characters , although they had now been living for several months in the same house . Aime seemed to forget her English in her nervousness ; and to watch with the jealous eyes of a dissatisfied mother all the proceedings of the Squire towards her little boy . They were not of the wisest kind , it must be owned ; the child sipped the strong ale with evident relish and clamoured for everything which he saw the others enjoying . Aime could hardly attend to Molly for her anxiety as to what her boy was doing and eating ; yet she said nothing . Roger took the end of the table opposite to that at which sat grandfather and grandchild . After the boy 's first wants were gratified the Squire addressed himself to Molly . "
317906	317907	317908	317908	They	6941	" "
317916	317920	317922	317922	you	0	" said Molly ; "

317973	317994	317996	317996	you	6933	" dropping his voice a little , and perhaps supposing that the child 's babble would drown the signification of his words.--"Nay
318012	318013	318016	318016	she	6933	" "
318019	318100	318016	318016	she	6933	" said Molly , in a low voice,--not looking up , however , for fear of catching another glimpse at Aime 's sudden forlornness of expression and deepened colour . She felt grateful , as if for a personal favour , when she heard Roger speaking to Aime the moment afterwards in the tender tones of brotherly friendliness ; and presently these two were sufficiently engaged in a separate conversation to allow Molly and the Squire to go on talking . "
318111	318124	318109	318109	he	6945	" said the Squire , stroking the little Roger 's curly head . "
318143	318144	318141	318141	he	6945	" "
318152	318159	318160	318160	Mamma	167	" said the boy , resolutely . "

318177	318189	318166	318166	I	0	" said the Squire , dropping his voice this time however . "
318200	318477	318480	318480	you	6949	" Molly made a point of turning the conversation from all personal subjects after this , and kept the Squire talking about the progress of his drainage during the rest of lunch . He offered to take her to see it ; and she acceded to the proposal , thinking , meantime , how little she need have anticipated the being thrown too intimately with Roger , who seemed to devote himself to his sister - in - law . But , in the evening , when Aime had gone upstairs to put her boy to bed , and the Squire was asleep in his easy - chair , a sudden flush of memory brought Mrs. Goodenough 's words again to her mind . She was virtually tte--tte with Roger , as she had been dozens of times before , but now she could not help assuming an air of constraint ; her eyes did not meet his in the old frank way ; she took up a book at a pause in the conversation , and left him puzzled and annoyed at the change in her manner . And so it went on during all the time of her visit . If sometimes she forgot , and let herself go into all her old naturalness , by - and - by she checked herself , and became comparatively cold and reserved . Roger was pained at all this -- more pained day after day ; more anxious to discover the cause . Aime , too , silently noticed how different Molly became in Roger 's presence . One day she could not help saying to Molly,-- "
318515	318516	318517	318517	He	211	" "
318522	318526	318517	318517	He	211	" said Molly . "
318537	318538	318530	318530	him	211	" "
318588	318979	318980	318980	I	0	" Molly had grown very fond of Aime ; when the latter was at her ease she had very charming and attaching ways ; but feeling uneasy in her position in the Squire 's house , she was almost repellent to him ; and he , too , put on his worst side to her . Roger was most anxious to bring them together , and had several consultations with Molly as to the best means of accomplishing this end . As long as they talked upon this subject , she spoke to him in the quiet sensible manner which she inherited from her father ; but when their discussions on this point were ended , she fell back into her piquant assumption of dignified reserve . It was very difficult for her to maintain this strange manner , especially when once or twice she fancied that it gave him pain ; and she would go into her own room and suddenly burst into tears on these occasions , and wish that her visit was ended , and that she was once again in the eventless tranquillity of her own home . Yet presently her fancy changed , and she clung to the swiftly passing hours , as if she would still retain the happiness of each . For , unknown to her , Roger was exerting himself to make her visit pleasant . He was not willing to appear as the instigator of all the little plans for each day , for he felt as if , somehow , he did not hold the same place in her regard as formerly . Still , one day Aime suggested a nutting expedition -- another day they gave little Roger the unheard - of pleasure of tea out - of - doors -- there was something else agreeable for a third ; and it was Roger who arranged all these simple pleasures -- such as he knew Molly would enjoy . But to her he only appeared as the ready forwarder of Aime 's devices . The week was nearly gone , when one morning the Squire found Roger sitting in the old library -- with a book before him , it is true , but so deep in thought that he was evidently startled by his father 's unexpected entrance . "
319083	319135	319136	319136	Father	437	" So Roger went out with his father , without saying many words till they were at some distance from the house . Then he brought out a sentence with such abruptness that he repaid his father for the start the latter had given him a quarter of an hour before . "

But the squire was not in such good spirits , and went but heavily into the discussion . At the end of it he said propos de bottes,-- "
319923	319961	319911	319911	you	211	" Roger knew perfectly well to what his father was alluding , but for an instant he was on the point of pretending to misunderstand . At length , however , he said , in a low voice,-- "
319989	320161	319980	319980	I	0	" The Squire was like a child to whom some toy has been refused ; from time to time the thought of his disappointment in this matter recurred to his mind ; and then he took to blaming Cynthia as the primary cause of Roger 's present indifference to womankind . It so happened that on Molly 's last morning at the Hall , she received her first letter from Cynthia -- Mrs. Henderson . It was just before breakfast - time ; Roger was out of doors , Aime had not as yet come down ; Molly was alone in the dining - room , where the table was already laid . She had just finished reading her letter when the Squire came in , and she immediately and joyfully told him what the morning had brought to her . But when she saw the Squire 's face , she could have bitten her tongue out for having named Cynthia 's name to him . He looked vexed and depressed . "
320343	320877	320334	320334	I	0	" he muttered as he went to the side - table to carve the ham , while Molly poured out the tea -- her heart very hot all the time , and effectually silenced for a space . It was with the greatest difficulty that she could keep tears of mortification from falling . She felt altogether in a wrong position in that house , which had been like a home to her until this last visit . What with Mrs. Goodenough 's remarks , and now this speech of the Squire 's , implying -- at least to her susceptible imagination -- that his father had proposed her as a wife to Roger , and that she had been rejected -- she was more glad than she could express , or even think , that she was going home this very morning . Roger came in from his walk while she was in this state of feeling . He saw in an instant that something had distressed Molly ; and he longed to have the old friendly right of asking her what it was . But she had effectually kept him at too great a distance during the last few days for him to feel at liberty to speak to her in the old straightforward brotherly way ; especially now , when he perceived her efforts to conceal her feelings , and the way in which she drank her tea in feverish haste , and accepted bread only to crumble it about her plate , untouched . It was all that he could do to make talk under these circumstances ; but he backed up her efforts as well as he could until Aime came down , grave and anxious : her boy had not had a good night , and did not seem well ; he had fallen into a feverish sleep now , or she could not have left him . Immediately the whole table was in a ferment . The Squire pushed away his plate , and could eat no more ; Roger was trying to extract a detail or a fact out of Aime , who began to give way to tears . Molly quickly proposed that the carriage , which had been ordered to take her home at eleven , should come round immediately -- she had everything ready packed up , she said,--and bring back her father at once . By leaving directly , she said , it was probable they might catch him after he had returned from his morning visits in the town , and before he had set off on his more distant round . Her proposal was agreed to , and she went upstairs to put on her things . She came down all ready into the drawing - room , expecting to find Aime and the Squire there ; but during her absence word had been brought to the anxious mother and grandfather that the child had wakened up in a panic , and both had rushed up to their darling . But Roger was in the drawing - room awaiting Molly , with a large bunch of the choicest flowers . "
320882	320904	320880	320880	Molly	221	" said he , as she was on the point of leaving the room again , on finding him there alone . "

She believed that he could have helped her more than any one to understand how she ought to behave rightly ; he would have disentangled her fancies,--if only he himself had not lain at the very core and centre of all her perplexity and dismay . How could she tell him of Mrs. Goodenough 's words troubling her maiden modesty ? How could she ever repeat what his father had said that morning , and assure him that she , no more than he , wished that their old friendliness should be troubled by the thought of a nearer relationship ?

The day before , he had believed that Molly had come to view all the symptoms of his growing love for her,--symptoms which he thought had been so patent,--as disgusting inconstancy to the inconstant Cynthia ; that she had felt that an attachment which could be so soon transferred to another was not worth having ; and that she had desired to mark all this by her changed treatment of him , and so to nip it in the bud . But this morning her old sweet , frank manner had returned -- in their last interview , at any rate . He puzzled himself hard to find out what could have distressed her at breakfast - time . He even went so far as to ask Robinson whether Miss Gibson had received any letters that morning ; and when he heard that she had had one , he tried to believe that the letter was in some way the cause of her sorrow . So far so good . They were friends again after their unspoken difference ; but that was not enough for Roger . He felt every day more and more certain that she , and she alone , could make him happy . He had felt this , and had partly given up all hope , while his father had been urging upon him the very course he most desired to take . No need for "
321803	322156	322167	322167	I	0	" to love her , he said to himself,--that was already done . And yet he was very jealous on her behalf . Was that love worthy of her which had once been given to Cynthia ? Was not this affair too much a mocking mimicry of the last -- again just on the point of leaving England for a considerable time -- if he followed her now to her own home,--in the very drawing - room where he had once offered to Cynthia ? And then by a strong resolve he determined on this course . They were friends now , and he kissed the rose that was her pledge of friendship . If he went to Africa , he ran some deadly chances ; he knew better what they were now than he had done when he went before . Until his return he would not even attempt to win more of her love than he already had . But once safe home again , no weak fancies as to what might or might not be her answer should prevent his running all chances to gain the woman who was to him the one who excelled all . His was not the poor vanity that thinks more of the possible mortification of a refusal than of the precious jewel of a bride that may be won . Somehow or another , please God to send him back safe , he would put his fate to the touch . And till then he would be patient . He was no longer a boy to rush at the coveted object ; he was a man capable of judging and abiding . Molly sent her father , as soon as she could find him , to the Hall ; and then sate down to the old life in the home drawing - room , where she missed Cynthia 's bright presence at every turn . Mrs. Gibson was in rather a querulous mood , which fastened itself upon the injury of Cynthia 's letter being addressed to Molly , and not to herself . "

For some days there was imminent danger to the little boy ; for some weeks there was a more chronic form of illness to contend with ; but when the immediate danger was over and the warm daily interest was past , Molly began to realize that , from the strict quarantine her father evidently thought it necessary to establish between the two houses , she was not likely to see Roger again before his departure for Africa . Oh ! if she had but made more of the uncared - for days that she had passed with him at the Hall ! Worse than uncared for ; days on which she had avoided him ; refused to converse freely with him ; given him pain by her change of manner ; for she had read in his eyes , heard in his voice , that he had been perplexed and pained , and now her imagination dwelt on and exaggerated the expression of his tones and looks . One evening after dinner , her father said,-- "

It was but what the latter had expected , after all her father had said of the very great danger of infection ; but now that her expectation came in the shape of a final decision , it took away her appetite . She submitted in silence ; but her observant father noticed that after this speech of his , she only played with the food on her plate , and concealed a good deal of it under her knife and fork . "

Molly tried hard to forget it in working away at a cushion she was preparing as a present to Cynthia ; people did worsted - work in those days . One , two , three . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven ; all wrong : she was thinking of something else , and had to unpick it . It was a rainy day , too ; and Mrs. Gibson , who had planned to go out and pay some calls , had to stay indoors . This made her restless and fidgety . She kept going backwards and forwards to different windows in the drawing - room to look at the weather , as if she imagined that while it rained at one window , it might be fine weather at another .

Molly could only peep here and there , dodging now up , now down , now on this side , now on that , of the perpetually - moving arms . She fancied she saw something of a corresponding movement on Roger 's part . At length he went away slowly , slowly , and often looking back , in spite of the tapped watch . Mrs. Gibson at last retreated , and Molly quietly moved into her place to see his figure once more before the turn of the road hid it from her view . He , too , knew where the last glimpse of Mr. Gibson 's house was to be obtained , and once more he turned , and his white handkerchief floated in the air . Molly waved hers high up , with eager longing that it should be seen . And then , he was gone ! and Molly returned to her worsted - work , happy , glowing , sad , content , and thinking to herself how sweet is -- friendship ! When she came to a sense of the present , Mrs. Gibson was saying,-- "

She navely expressed her feelings on this subject to her husband one day when she was really not feeling quite well , and when consequently her annoyances were much more present to her mind than her sources of happiness .

328122	328821	328828	328829	Mrs. Gibson	199	" * * * * * * CONCLUDING REMARKS : [ By the Editor of _ The Cornhill Magazine _ . ] Here the story is broken off , and it can never be finished . What promised to be the crowning work of a life is a memorial of death . A few days longer , and it would have been a triumphal column , crowned with a capital of festal leaves and flowers : now it is another sort of column -- one of those sad white pillars which stand broken in the churchyard . But if the work is not quite complete , little remains to be added to it , and that little has been distinctly reflected into our minds . We know that Roger Hamley will marry Molly , and that is what we are most concerned about . Indeed , there was little else to tell . Had the writer lived , she would have sent her hero back to Africa forthwith ; and those scientific parts of Africa are a long way from Hamley ; and there is not much to choose between a long distance and a long time . How many hours are there in twenty - four when you are all alone in a desert place , a thousand miles from the happiness which might be yours to take -- if you were there to take it ? How many , when from the sources of the Topinambo your heart flies back ten times a day , like a carrier - pigeon , to the one only source of future good for you , and ten times a day returns with its message undelivered ? Many more than are counted on the calendar . So Roger found . The days were weeks that separated him from the time when Molly gave him a certain little flower , and months from the time which divorced him from Cynthia , whom he had begun to doubt before he knew for certain that she was never much worth hoping for . And if such were his days , what was the slow procession of actual weeks and months in those remote and solitary places ? They were like years of a stay - at - home life , with liberty and leisure to see that nobody was courting Molly meanwhile . The effect of this was , that long before the term of his engagement was ended all that Cynthia had been to him was departed from Roger 's mind , and all that Molly was and might be to him filled it full . He returned ; but when he saw Molly again he remembered that to her the time of his absence might not have seemed so long , and was oppressed with the old dread that she would think him fickle . Therefore this young gentleman , so self - reliant and so lucid in scientific matters , found it difficult after all to tell Molly how much he hoped she loved him ; and might have blundered if he had not thought of beginning by showing her the flower that was plucked from the nosegay . How charmingly that scene would have been drawn , had Mrs. Gaskell lived to depict it , we can only imagine : that it _ would _ have been charming -- especially in what Molly did , and looked , and said -- we know . Roger and Molly are married ; and if one of them is happier than the other , it is Molly . Her husband has no need to draw upon the little fortune which is to go to poor Osborne 's boy , for he becomes professor at some great scientific institution , and wins his way in the world handsomely . The squire is almost as happy in this marriage as his son . If any one suffers for it , it is Mr. Gibson . But he takes a partner , so as to get a chance of running up to London to stay with Molly for a few days now and then , and "
328831	329162	328828	328829	Mrs. Gibson	199	" Of what was to happen to Cynthia after her marriage the author was not heard to say much ; and , indeed , it does not seem that anything needs to be added . One little anecdote , however , was told of her by Mrs. Gaskell , which is very characteristic . One day , when Cynthia and her husband were on a visit to Hollingford , Mr. Henderson learned for the first time , through an innocent casual remark of Mr. Gibson 's , that the famous traveller , Roger Hamley , was known to the family . Cynthia had never happened to mention it . How well that little incident , too , would have been described ! But it is useless to speculate upon what would have been done by the delicate strong hand which can create no more Molly Gibsons -- no more Roger Hamleys . We have repeated , in this brief note , all that is known of her designs for the story , which would have been completed in another chapter . There is not so much to regret , then , so far as this novel is concerned ; indeed , the regrets of those who knew her are less for the loss of the novelist than of the woman -- one of the kindest and wisest of her time . But yet , for her own sake _ as _ a novelist alone , her untimely death is a matter for deep regret . It is clear in this novel of _ Wives and Daughters _ , in the exquisite little story that preceded it , _ Cousin Phillis _ , and in _ Sylvia 's Lovers _ , that Mrs. Gaskell had within these five years started upon a new career with all the freshness of youth , and with a mind which seemed to have put off its clay and to have been born again . But that "
329167	329186	328828	328829	Mrs. Gibson	199	" must be taken in a very narrow sense . All minds are tinctured more or less with the "
329189	329596	328828	328829	Mrs. Gibson	199	" in which they are contained ; but few minds ever showed less of base earth than Mrs. Gaskell 's . It was so at all times ; but lately even the original slight tincture seemed to disappear . While you read any one of the last three books we have named , you feel yourself caught out of an abominable wicked world , crawling with selfishness and reeking with base passions , into one where there is much weakness , many mistakes , sufferings long and bitter , but where it is possible for people to live calm and wholesome lives ; and , what is more , you feel that this is at least as real a world as the other . The kindly spirit which thinks no ill looks out of her pages irradiate ; and while we read them , we breathe the purer intelligence which prefers to deal with emotions and passions which have a living root in minds within the pale of salvation , and not with those which rot without it . This spirit is more especially declared in _ Cousin Phillis _ and _ Wives and Daughters_--their author 's latest works ; they seem to show that for her the end of life was not descent amongst the clods of the valley , but ascent into the purer air of the heaven - aspiring hills . We are saying nothing now of the merely intellectual qualities displayed in these later works . Twenty years to come , that may be thought the more important question of the two ; in the presence of her grave we can not think so ; but it is true , all the same , that as mere works of art and observation , these later novels of Mrs. Gaskell 's are among the finest of our time . There is a scene in _ Cousin Phyllis_--where Holman , making hay with his men , ends the day with a psalm -- which is not excelled as a picture in all modern fiction ; and the same may be said of that chapter of this last story in which Roger smokes a pipe with the Squire after the quarrel with Osborne . There is little in either of these scenes , or in a score of others which succeed each other like gems in a cabinet , which the ordinary novel - maker could "
329599	329603	328828	328829	Mrs. Gibson	199	" There is no "
329605	330087	328828	328829	Mrs. Gibson	199	" for _ him _ in half - a - dozen farming men singing hymns in a field , or a discontented old gentleman smoking tobacco with his son . Still less could he avail himself of the miseries of a little girl sent to be happy in a fine house full of fine people ; but it is just in such things as these that true genius appears brightest and most unapproachable . It is the same with the personages in Mrs. Gaskell 's works . Cynthia is one of the most difficult characters which have ever been attempted in our time . Perfect art always obscures the difficulties it overcomes ; and it is not till we try to follow the processes by which such a character as the Tito of _ Romola _ is created , for instance , that we begin to understand what a marvellous piece of work it is . To be sure , Cynthia was not so difficult , nor is it nearly so great a creation as that splendid achievement of art and thought -- of the rarest art , of the profoundest thought . But she also belongs to the kind of characters which are conceived only in minds large , clear , harmonious and just , and which can be portrayed fully and without flaw only by hands obedient to the finest motions of the mind . Viewed in this light , Cynthia is a more important piece of work even than Molly , delicately as she is drawn , and true and harmonious as that picture is also . And what we have said of Cynthia may be said with equal truth of Osborne Hamley . The true delineation of a character like that is as fine a test of art as the painting of a foot or a hand , which also seems so easy , and in which perfection is most rare . In this case the work is perfect . Mrs. Gaskell has drawn a dozen characters more striking than Osborne since she wrote _ Mary Barton _ , but not one which shows more exquisite finish . Another thing we may be permitted to notice , because it has a great and general significance . It may be true that this is not exactly the place for criticism , but since we are writing of Osborne Hamley , we can not resist pointing out a peculiar instance of the subtler conceptions which underlie all really considerable works . Here are Osborne and Roger , two men who , in every particular that can be seized for _ description _ , are totally different creatures . Body and mind they are quite unlike . They have different tastes ; they take different ways : they are men of two sorts which , in the society sense , never "
330089	330138	328828	328829	Mrs. Gibson	199	" each other ; and yet , never did brotherly blood run more manifest than in the veins of those two . To make that manifest without allowing the effort to peep out for a single moment , would be a triumph of art ; but it is a "
330145	330218	328828	328829	Mrs. Gibson	199	" to make their likeness in unlikeness so natural a thing that we no more wonder about it than we wonder at seeing the fruit and the bloom on the same bramble : we have always seen them there together in blackberry season , and do not wonder about it nor think about it at all . Inferior writers , even some writers who are highly accounted , would have revelled in the "
330221	330315	328828	328829	Mrs. Gibson	199	" persuaded that they were doing a fine anatomical dramatic thing by bringing it out at every opportunity . To the author of _ Wives and Daughters _ this sort of anatomy was mere dislocation . She began by having the people of her story born in the usual way , and not built up like the Frankenstein monster ; and thus when Squire Hamley took a wife , it was then provided that his two boys should be as naturally one and diverse as the fruit and the bloom on the bramble .
