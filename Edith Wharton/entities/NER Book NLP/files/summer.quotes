8306	8324	8325	8325	Charity	69	“ There 's been some complaints made , it appears . Miss Hatchard sent for me this morning---- ”
8334	8391	8325	8325	Charity	69	“ I know ! Orma Fry , and that toad of a Targatt girl and Ben Fry , like as not . He 's going round with her . The low - down sneaks -- I always knew they 'd try to have me out ! As if anybody ever came to the library , anyhow ! ”
8392	8403	8325	8325	Charity	69	“ Somebody did yesterday , and you were n't there . ”
8404	8407	8408	8408	she	69	“ Yesterday ? ”
8415	8431	8408	8408	she	69	“ At what time was n't I there yesterday , I 'd like to know ? ”
8432	8438	8439	8439	Charity	69	“ Round about four o'clock . ”
8474	8481	8458	8458	she	69	“ Who came at four o'clock ? ”
8482	8487	8408	8408	she	69	“ Miss Hatchard did . ”
8488	8519	8458	8458	she	69	“ Miss Hatchard ? Why , she ai n't ever been near the place since she 's been lame . She could n't get up the steps if she tried . ”
8520	8635	8636	8636	Charity	69	“ She can be helped up , I guess . She was yesterday , anyhow , by the young fellow that 's staying with her . He found you there , I understand , earlier in the afternoon ; and he went back and told Miss Hatchard the books were in bad shape and needed attending to . She got excited , and had herself wheeled straight round ; and when she got there the place was locked . So she sent for me , and told me about that , and about the other complaints . She claims you 've neglected things , and that she 's going to get a trained librarian . ”
8703	8715	8696	8696	she	69	“ He told Miss Hatchard the books were in bad shape . ”
8826	8833	8834	8834	she	69	“ Well , I 'll go , ”
8838	8845	8834	8834	she	69	“ I 'll go right off . ”
8846	8850	8851	8851	She	69	“ Go where ? ”
8862	8901	8857	8858	Mr. Royall	64	“ Why , out of their old library : straight out , and never set foot in it again . They need n't think I 'm going to wait round and let them say they 've discharged me ! ”
8902	8910	8911	8911	he	64	“ Charity -- Charity Royall , you listen---- ”
9016	9040	9041	9041	she	69	“ I 'm glad I 'll never have to sit in this old vault again when other folks are out in the sun ! ”
9213	9229	9230	9230	she	69	“ What have I ever done to it , that it should hurt me so ? ”
9249	9263	9264	9264	she	69	“ I won't -- I wo n't go there looking like a horror ! ”
9327	9333	9334	9334	he	430	“ I beg your pardon , ”
9337	9346	9334	9334	he	430	“ I thought there was no one here . ”
9356	9373	9347	9347	Charity	69	“ You ca n't come in . The library ai n't open to the public Wednesdays . ”
9374	9389	9428	9430	The young man	173	“ I know it 's not ; but my cousin gave me her key . ”
9390	9427	9428	9430	The young man	173	“ Miss Hatchard 's got no right to give her key to other folks , any more'n I have . I 'm the librarian and I know the by - laws . This is my library . ”
9435	9453	9428	9430	The young man	173	“ Why , I know it is ; I 'm so sorry if you mind my coming . ”
9454	9509	9510	9511	Young Harney	91	“ I suppose you came to see what more you could say to set her against me ? But you need n't trouble : it 's my library today , but it wo n't be this time tomorrow . I 'm on the way now to take her back the key and the register . ”
9529	9535	9536	9536	he	173	“ I do n't understand , ”
9539	9561	9536	9536	he	173	“ There must be some mistake . Why should I say things against you to Miss Hatchard -- or to anyone ? ”
9575	9856	9857	9857	She	433	“ I do n't know why you should . I could understand Orma Fry 's doing it , because she 's always wanted to get me out of here ever since the first day . I ca n't see why , when she 's got her own home , and her father to work for her ; nor Ida Targatt , neither , when she got a legacy from her step - brother on'y last year . But anyway we all live in the same place , and when it 's a place like North Dormer it 's enough to make people hate each other just to have to walk down the same street every day . But you do n't live here , and you do n't know anything about any of us , so what did you have to meddle for ? Do you suppose the other girls'd have kept the books any better'n I did ? Why , Orma Fry do n't hardly know a book from a flat - iron ! And what if I do n't always sit round here doing nothing till it strikes five up at the church ? Who cares if the library 's open or shut ? Do you suppose anybody ever comes here for books ? What they 'd like to come for is to meet the fellows they 're going with if I 'd let 'em . But I would n't let Bill Sollas from over the hill hang round here waiting for the youngest Targatt girl , because I know him ... that 's all ... even if I do n't know about books all I ought to .... ”
9912	9926	9901	9901	he	434	“ But , Miss Royall , I assure you ... I assure you .... ”
9942	9959	9934	9934	she	433	“ If I was you I 'd have the nerve to stick to what I said ! ”
9970	10022	9934	9934	she	433	“ I hope I should if I knew ; but I do n't . Apparently something disagreeable has happened , for which you think I 'm to blame . But I do n't know what it is , because I 've been up on Eagle Ridge ever since the early morning . ”
10023	10076	10077	10078	Young Harney	91	“ I do n't know where you 've been this morning , but I know you were here in this library yesterday ; and it was you that went home and told your cousin the books were in bad shape , and brought her round to see how I 'd neglected them . ”
10083	10206	10077	10078	Young Harney	91	“ Was that what you were told ? I do n't wonder you 're angry . The books are in bad shape , and as some are interesting it 's a pity . I told Miss Hatchard they were suffering from dampness and lack of air ; and I brought her here to show her how easily the place could be ventilated . I also told her you ought to have some one to help you do the dusting and airing . If you were given a wrong version of what I said I 'm sorry ; but I 'm so fond of old books that I 'd rather see them made into a bonfire than left to moulder away like these . ”
10220	10318	10207	10207	Charity	69	“ I do n't care what you say you told her . All I know is she thinks it 's all my fault , and I 'm going to lose my job , and I wanted it more'n anyone in the village , because I have n't got anybody belonging to me , the way other folks have . All I wanted was to put aside money enough to get away from here sometime . D'you suppose if it had n't been for that I 'd have kept on sitting day after day in this old vault ? ”
10331	10369	10370	10370	His	436	“ It is an old vault ; but need it be ? That 's the point . And it 's my putting the question to my cousin that seems to have been the cause of the trouble . ”
10408	10474	10475	10476	The architect	439	“ Of course it 's a bad job to do anything with a building jammed against a hill like this ridiculous mausoleum : you could n't get a good draught through it without blowing a hole in the mountain . But it can be ventilated after a fashion , and the sun can be let in : I 'll show you how if you like .... ”
10532	10557	10526	10526	he	439	“ Look here -- you do n't mean what you said ? You do n't really think I 'd do anything to hurt you ? ”
10578	10589	10590	10590	she	435	“ Oh , what DID you do it for then ? ”
10628	10687	10618	10618	He	439	“ Why , to make things pleasanter for you here ; and better for the books . I 'm sorry if my cousin twisted around what I said . She 's excitable , and she lives on trifles : I ought to have remembered that . Do n't punish me by letting her think you take her seriously . ”
10795	10835	10778	10778	he	439	“ It do n't matter to Miss Hatchard how I take her . Mr. Royall says she 's going to get a trained librarian ; and I 'd sooner resign than have the village say she sent me away . ”
10836	10886	10887	10887	Her	69	“ Naturally you would . But I 'm sure she does n't mean to send you away . At any rate , wo n't you give me the chance to find out first and let you know ? It will be time enough to resign if I 'm mistaken . ”
10900	10918	10919	10919	He	448	“ I do n't want anybody should coax her to keep me if I do n't suit . ”
10923	10943	10944	10944	He	448	“ I give you my word I wo n't do that . Only wait till tomorrow , will you ? ”
10956	10969	10944	10944	He	448	“ You can trust me , you know -- you really can . ”
10991	10998	10982	10982	she	69	“ Oh , I 'll wait . ”

11405	11410	11390	11390	she	69	“ Do n't what ? ”
11419	11431	11432	11432	she	69	“ Do n't stamp on those bramble flowers , you dolt ! ”
11482	11493	11494	11494	she	69	“ Do n't you ever SEE anything , Liff Hyatt ? ”
11521	11534	11518	11518	He	458	“ I seen you ! That 's what I come down for . ”
11535	11540	11541	11541	she	69	“ Down from where ? ”
11563	11572	11555	11555	He	458	“ Been cutting down trees for Dan Targatt . ”
11599	11605	11613	11613	they	461	“ came from the Mountain , ”
11698	11725	11726	11726	he	94	“ They wo n't any of 'em touch you up there , f'ever you was to come up .... But I do n't s'pose you will , ”
11884	11894	11895	11895	she	69	“ I wonder if he 's related to me ? ”
11904	11922	11923	11923	she	69	“ Is there any folks living in the brown house by the swamp , up under Porcupine ? ”
11960	11972	11973	11973	he	94	“ There 's always the same folks in the brown house , ”
11980	11992	11973	11973	he	94	“ They 're from up your way , ai n't they ? ”
11993	12002	12003	12003	he	94	“ Their name 's the same as mine , ”
12015	12047	12007	12007	Charity	69	“ See here , I want to go there some day and take a gentleman with me that 's boarding with us . He 's up in these parts drawing pictures . ”
12074	12089	12090	12090	she	69	“ He wants to see the brown house , and go all over it , ”
12109	12118	12119	12119	he	94	“ Is it a fellow from the city ? ”
12122	12141	12142	12142	She	69	“ Yes . He draws pictures of things . He 's down there now drawing the Bonner house . ”
12159	12164	12165	12165	Liff	94	“ The Bonner house ? ”
12169	12201	12165	12165	Liff	94	“ Yes . You wo n't understand -- and it do n't matter . All I say is : he 's going to the Hyatts ' in a day or two . ”
12209	12218	12202	12202	Liff	94	“ Bash is ugly sometimes in the afternoons . ”
12232	12242	12221	12221	her	69	“ I 'm coming too : you tell him . ”
12243	12269	12221	12221	her	69	“ They wo n't none of them trouble you , the Hyatts wo n't . What d'you want a take a stranger with you though ? ”
12270	12288	12289	12289	He	94	“ I 've told you , have n't I ? You 've got to tell Bash Hyatt . ”
12313	12320	12301	12301	his	94	“ He 's down there now ? ”
12321	12324	12325	12325	He	94	“ Yes . ”
12343	12349	12350	12350	he	94	“ Well , so long , ”
12378	12386	12372	12372	he	94	“ I would n't go there a Sunday ”
12563	12575	12576	12576	she	69	“ I wonder if Liff Hyatt knows who my mother was ? ”
12813	12817	12819	12819	she	69	“ his houses , ”
13192	13195	13204	13204	she	69	“ going with ”
13304	13309	13298	13298	she	69	“ pay for it . ”
13364	13370	13395	13396	Mr. Royall	64	“ going with a city fellow ”
13461	13475	13476	13476	she	69	“ I 'm going to take you to that house up under Porcupine , ”
13479	13542	13476	13476	she	69	“ What house ? Oh , yes ; that ramshackle place near the swamp , with the gipsy - looking people hanging about . It 's curious that a house with traces of real architecture should have been built in such a place . But the people were a sulky - looking lot -- do you suppose they 'll let us in ? ”
13543	13552	13553	13553	she	69	“ They 'll do whatever I tell them , ”
13565	13569	13570	13570	he	514	“ Will they ? ”
13576	13622	13570	13570	he	514	“ Well , I should like to see what 's left inside the house . And I should like to have a talk with the people . Who was it who was telling me the other day that they had come down from the Mountain ? ”
13685	13697	13698	13698	Her	69	“ The Mountain ? I ai n't afraid of the Mountain ! ”
13750	13765	13766	13766	he	514	“ I must go up there some day : I want to see it , ”
13791	13803	13766	13766	he	514	“ What 'd you want to go up the Mountain for ? ”
13804	13888	13895	13895	he	514	“ Why , it must be rather a curious place . There 's a queer colony up there , you know : sort of out - laws , a little independent kingdom . Of course you 've heard them spoken of ; but I 'm told they have nothing to do with the people in the valleys -- rather look down on them , in fact . I suppose they 're rough customers ; but they must have a good deal of character . ”
13970	13978	13979	13979	he	514	“ It 's queer , you know , ”
13982	14011	13979	13979	he	514	“ that , just over there , on top of that hill , there should be a handful of people who do n't give a damn for anybody . ”
14038	14053	14033	14033	him	514	“ I do n't know much about them . Have they always been there ? ”
14054	14206	14033	14033	him	514	“ Nobody seems to know exactly how long . Down at Creston they told me that the first colonists are supposed to have been men who worked on the railway that was built forty or fifty years ago between Springfield and Nettleton . Some of them took to drink , or got into trouble with the police , and went off -- disappeared into the woods . A year or two later there was a report that they were living up on the Mountain . Then I suppose others joined them -- and children were born . Now they say there are over a hundred people up there . They seem to be quite outside the jurisdiction of the valleys . No school , no church -- and no sheriff ever goes up to see what they 're about . But do n't people ever talk of them at North Dormer ? ”
14207	14219	14220	14220	He	521	“ I do n't know . They say they 're bad . ”
14223	14236	14220	14220	He	521	“ Do they ? We 'll go and see , shall we ? ”
14250	14272	14237	14237	She	522	“ You never heard , I suppose -- I come from there . They brought me down when I was little . ”
14273	14276	14277	14277	He	521	“ You ? ”
14291	14311	14277	14277	He	521	“ You 're from the Mountain ? How curious ! I suppose that 's why you 're so different .... ”
14336	14342	14343	14343	she	522	“ Am I ... different ? ”
14350	14355	14356	14356	He	521	“ Oh , awfully ! ”
14370	14373	14374	14374	he	521	“ Come , ”
14377	14383	14374	14374	he	521	“ let 's be off . ”
14397	14412	14384	14384	He	521	“ What a good day ! Where are you going to take me tomorrow ? ”
14864	14882	14883	14883	he	64	“ Here -- go get yourself a Sunday bonnet that 'll make all the other girls mad , ”
15074	15081	15084	15085	Mr. Royall	64	“ The Mountain ? The Mountain ? ”
15088	15295	15296	15296	He	547	“ Why , the Mountain 's a blot -- that 's what it is , sir , a blot . That scum up there ought to have been run in long ago -- and would have , if the people down here had n't been clean scared of them . The Mountain belongs to this township , and it 's North Dormer 's fault if there 's a gang of thieves and outlaws living over there , in sight of us , defying the laws of their country . Why , there ai n't a sheriff or a tax - collector or a coroner'd durst go up there . When they hear of trouble on the Mountain the selectmen look the other way , and pass an appropriation to beautify the town pump . The only man that ever goes up is the minister , and he goes because they send down and get him whenever there 's any of them dies . They think a lot of Christian burial on the Mountain -- but I never heard of their having the minister up to marry them . And they never trouble the Justice of the Peace either . They just herd together like the heathen . ”
15352	15363	15364	15364	he	547	“ I suppose you 've never been up there yourself ? ”
15368	15374	15376	15377	Mr. Royall	64	“ Yes , I have , ”
15383	15425	15376	15377	Mr. Royall	64	“ The wiseacres down here told me I 'd be done for before I got back ; but nobody lifted a finger to hurt me . And I 'd just had one of their gang sent up for seven years too . ”
15426	15433	15334	15336	the young man	173	“ You went up after that ? ”
15434	15640	15641	15641	He	551	“ Yes , sir : right after it . The fellow came down to Nettleton and ran amuck , the way they sometimes do . After they 've done a wood - cutting job they come down and blow the money in ; and this man ended up with manslaughter . I got him convicted , though they were scared of the Mountain even at Nettleton ; and then a queer thing happened . The fellow sent for me to go and see him in gaol . I went , and this is what he says : ' The fool that defended me is a chicken - livered son of a -- and all the rest of it , ' he says . ' I 've got a job to be done for me up on the Mountain , and you 're the only man I seen in court that looks as if he 'd do it . ' He told me he had a child up there -- or thought he had -- a little girl ; and he wanted her brought down and reared like a Christian . I was sorry for the fellow , so I went up and got the child . ”
15652	15665	15666	15666	he	551	“ That 's the only time I ever went up the Mountain , ”
15680	15690	15677	15677	Harney	75	“ And the child -- had she no mother ? ”
15691	15757	15677	15677	Harney	75	“ Oh , yes : there was a mother . But she was glad enough to have her go . She 'd have given her to anybody . They ai n't half human up there . I guess the mother 's dead by now , with the life she was leading . Anyhow , I 've never heard of her from that day to this . ”
15758	15765	15766	15766	Harney	75	“ My God , how ghastly , ”
15806	15810	15801	15810	a mother who was n't “ half human , ”	2117	“ half human , ”
16315	16317	16329	16329	she	69	“ improved ”
16599	16619	16620	16620	she	69	“ I wish he 'd go away : I wish he 'd go tomorrow , and never come back ! ”
16918	16924	16925	16925	he	64	“ Where you going to ? ”
16928	16940	16941	16941	she	69	“ Why -- Mr. Harney 's starting earlier than usual today , ”
16944	16963	16964	16964	She	69	“ Mr. Harney , Mr. Harney ? Ai n't Mr. Harney learned how to drive a horse yet ? ”
17454	17467	17468	17468	she	69	“ He 'd better know what kind of folks I belong to , ”
17501	17509	17491	17491	she	69	“ There 's a storm coming up . ”
17517	17531	17510	17510	He	76	“ Is it that scrap of cloud among the pines that frightens you ? ”
17532	17549	17491	17491	she	69	“ It 's over the Mountain ; and a cloud over the Mountain always means trouble . ”
17550	17584	17585	17585	He	76	“ Oh , I do n't believe half the bad things you all say of the Mountain ! But anyhow , we 'll get down to the brown house before the rain comes . ”
17749	17751	17762	17762	he	76	“ typical ”
17780	17787	17771	17771	he	76	“ We wo n't stay long . ”

18325	18331	18332	18332	she	69	“ I 'm Charity Royall , ”

19222	19247	19217	19217	she	648	“ Those people back there are the kind of folks I come from . They may be my relations , for all I know . ”

19272	19285	19286	19286	She	648	“ I wonder why they came down to that fever - hole . ”
19290	19329	19286	19286	She	648	“ To better themselves ! It 's worse up on the Mountain . Bash Hyatt married the daughter of the farmer that used to own the brown house . That was him by the stove , I suppose . ”
19342	19364	19338	19338	she	648	“ I saw you take out a dollar to give to that poor woman . Why did you put it back ? ”

19389	19413	19414	19414	He	75	“ Was it because you knew they were my folks , and thought I 'd be ashamed to see you give them money ? ”
19424	19428	19414	19414	He	75	“ Oh , Charity---- ”
19448	19470	19471	19471	she	648	“ I ain't -- I ai n't ashamed . They 're my people , and I ai n't ashamed of them , ”

Beautifully done ... Bach and Beethoven ... a lawn - party first ... I saw Miss Balch several times , by the way ... looking extremely handsome .... ”
20838	20843	20855	20855	he	75	“ Oh , really ? ”
20858	20890	20855	20855	he	75	“ You see , my plan is to move these shelves away , and open a round window in this wall , on the axis of the one under the pediment . ”

25357	25421	25353	25354	Mrs. Royall	81	“ Do n't let 's go on like this , Charity . It ca n't do any good to either of us . You were seen going into that fellow 's house ... you were seen coming out of it .... I 've watched this thing coming , and I 've tried to stop it . As God sees me , I have .... ”
25422	25441	25442	25442	He	822	“ Ah , it WAS you , then ? I knew it was you that sent him away ! ”
25449	25462	25442	25442	He	822	“ Did n't he tell you so ? I thought he understood . ”
25471	25567	25463	25463	He	822	“ I did n't name you to him : I 'd have cut my hand off sooner . I just told him I could n't spare the horse any longer ; and that the cooking was getting too heavy for Verena . I guess he 's the kind that 's heard the same thing before . Anyhow , he took it quietly enough . He said his job here was about done , anyhow ; and there did n't another word pass between us .... If he told you otherwise he told you an untruth . ”
25595	25616	25463	25463	He	822	“ I 've told you he did n't tell me anything . I did n't speak with him last night . ”
25617	25625	25463	25463	He	822	“ You did n't speak with him ? ”
25626	25698	25463	25463	He	822	“ No .... It 's not that I care what any of you say ... but you may as well know . Things ai n't between us the way you think ... and the other people in this place . He was kind to me ; he was my friend ; and all of a sudden he stopped coming , and I knew it was you that done it -- YOU ! ”
25711	25732	25733	25734	Mr. Royall	64	“ So I went there last night to find out what you 'd said to him : that 's all . ”
25740	25779	25733	25734	Mr. Royall	64	“ But , then -- if he was n't there , what were you doing there all that time?--Charity , for pity 's sake , tell me . I 've got to know , to stop their talking . ”
25803	25862	25800	25800	his	825	“ Ca n't you see that I do n't care what anybody says ? It 's true I went there to see him ; and he was in his room , and I stood outside for ever so long and watched him ; but I dursn't go in for fear he 'd think I 'd come after him .... ”
25878	25890	25891	25891	she	824	“ As long as I live I 'll never forgive you ! ”
25943	26086	26087	26087	He	827	“ Charity , you say you do n't care ; but you 're the proudest girl I know , and the last to want people to talk against you . You know there 's always eyes watching you : you 're handsomer and smarter than the rest , and that 's enough . But till lately you 've never given them a chance . Now they 've got it , and they 're going to use it . I believe what you say , but they wo n't .... It was Mrs. Tom Fry seen you going in ... and two or three of them watched for you to come out again .... You 've been with the fellow all day long every day since he come here ... and I 'm a lawyer , and I know how hard slander dies . ”
26107	26165	26091	26091	she	828	“ He 's a pleasant fellow to talk to -- I liked having him here myself . The young men up here ai n't had his chances . But there 's one thing as old as the hills and as plain as daylight : if he 'd wanted you the right way he 'd have said so . ”
26196	26403	26193	26193	his	827	“ See here , Charity Royall : I had a shameful thought once , and you 've made me pay for it . Is n't that score pretty near wiped out ? ... There 's a streak in me I ai n't always master of ; but I 've always acted straight to you but that once . And you 've known I would -- you've trusted me . For all your sneers and your mockery you 've always known I loved you the way a man loves a decent woman . I 'm a good many years older than you , but I 'm head and shoulders above this place and everybody in it , and you know that too . I slipped up once , but that 's no reason for not starting again . If you 'll come with me I 'll do it . If you 'll marry me we 'll leave here and settle in some big town , where there 's men , and business , and things doing . It 's not too late for me to find an opening .... I can see it by the way folks treat me when I go down to Hepburn or Nettleton .... ”
26463	26474	26477	26477	him	829	“ Charity -- Charity -- say you 'll do it , ”
26491	26513	26477	26477	him	829	“ Oh , what 's the use of all this ? When I leave here it wo n't be with you . ”
26556	26569	26570	26570	He	829	“ That 's all , is it ? It 's not much . ”
26589	26649	26650	26650	He	829	“ Well , then look here .... You 're right : I 've no claim on you -- why should you look at a broken man like me ? You want the other fellow ... and I do n't blame you . You picked out the best when you seen it ... well , that was always my way . ”
26673	26682	26683	26683	he	829	“ Do you want him to marry you ? ”
26723	26834	26837	26837	him	835	“ Do you want him to -- say ? I 'll have him here in an hour if you do . I ai n't been in the law thirty years for nothing . He 's hired Carrick Fry 's team to take him to Hepburn , but he ai n't going to start for another hour . And I can put things to him so he wo n't be long deciding .... He 's soft : I could see that . I do n't say you wo n't be sorry afterward -- but , by God , I 'll give you the chance to be , if you say so . ”
26949	26969	26970	26970	she	834	“ I do n't want any chance you can give me : I 'm glad he 's going away , ”
26989	26992	26993	26993	he	835	“ Charity ! ”
27195	27201	27202	27202	he	75	“ Are you going out ? ”
27205	27211	27189	27189	he	75	“ May I come in ? ”
27251	27257	27237	27237	she	834	“ Yes : come in . ”
27391	27410	27411	27411	he	75	“ I 'm so sorry it 's good - bye : I suppose you know I 'm leaving , ”
27434	27449	27450	27450	she	834	“ I presume you found your work was over quicker than what you expected , ”
27453	27502	27450	27450	she	834	“ Well , yes -- that is , no : there are plenty of things I should have liked to do . But my holiday 's limited ; and now that Mr. Royall needs the horse for himself it 's rather difficult to find means of getting about . ”
27503	27516	27517	27517	she	834	“ There ai n't any too many teams for hire around here , ”
27526	27546	27547	27547	he	75	“ These days here have been -- awfully pleasant : I wanted to thank you for making them so , ”
27567	27607	27563	27563	he	75	“ You 've been wonderfully kind to me , and I wanted to tell you .... I wish I could think of you as happier , less lonely .... Things are sure to change for you by and by .... ”
27608	27624	27563	27563	he	75	“ Things do n't change at North Dormer : people just get used to them . ”
27655	27668	27647	27647	he	75	“ That 's not true of you . It ca n't be . ”
27702	27709	27710	27710	she	834	“ Well , good - bye , ”
27731	27736	27737	27737	He	75	“ Good - bye . ”
27747	27759	27737	27737	He	75	“ You 'll say good - bye for me to Verena ? ”
28128	28137	28138	28138	she	834	“ I look awful , do n't I ? ”
28155	28175	28176	28176	Charity	69	“ I 'll stitch the roses on right here , so 's you can put it away at once . ”
28230	28245	28246	28246	she	69	“ Do n't you ever feel like going down to Nettleton for a day ? ”
28257	28277	28251	28251	her	74	“ No , I always remember that awful time I went down with Julia -- to that doctor 's . ”
28278	28282	28251	28251	her	74	“ Oh , Ally---- ”
28283	28365	28251	28251	her	74	“ I ca n't help it . The house is on the corner of Wing Street and Lake Avenue . The trolley from the station goes right by it , and the day the minister took us down to see those pictures I recognized it right off , and could n't seem to see anything else . There 's a big black sign with gold letters all across the front--'Private Consultations . ' She came as near as anything to dying .... ”
28366	28370	28371	28371	Charity	69	“ Poor Julia ! ”
28465	28477	28478	28478	She	69	“ Is it sewed ? Let me try it on again . ”

30472	30479	30480	30480	he	75	“ Which do you like best ? ”
30490	30496	30497	30497	She	69	“ I do n't know .... ”
30513	30524	30525	30525	he	75	“ Do n't you think the blue pin 's better ? ”
30571	30586	30587	30587	she	69	“ It 's so lovely I guess I was afraid to look at it , ”
30609	30619	30606	30606	he	75	“ Oh , by Jove , I forgot something , ”
30651	30672	30673	30673	he	75	“ You must n't be afraid of looking at the blue pin any longer , because it belongs to you , ”

32624	32633	32611	32611	Harney	75	“ Have you never seen any good fireworks ? ”

32696	32725	32726	32726	She	69	“ Rather . Did n't you notice that big raft we passed ? It 's wonderful to see the rockets completing their orbits down under one 's feet . ”

36720	36740	36741	36741	he	1158	“ Sister , your Saviour knows everything . Wo n't you come in and lay your guilt before Him ? ”
36785	36795	36796	36796	she	74	“ I on'y wish't I had any to lay ! ”
36818	36828	36811	36813	the young man	173	“ Oh , Sister , do n't speak blasphemy .... ”
37092	37103	37080	37080	Harney	75	“ Charity ! What on earth are you doing here ? ”
37129	37143	37144	37144	he	75	“ Where were you going ? Had you forgotten that I was coming ? ”
37161	37183	37184	37184	she	74	“ I was going away -- I do n't want to see you -- I want you should leave me alone , ”
37209	37218	37194	37194	his	75	“ Going away -- from me , Charity ? ”
37219	37230	37231	37231	He	75	“ From everybody . I want you should leave me . ”
37251	37258	37231	37231	He	75	“ Where were you going ? ' “
37261	37262	37231	37231	He	75	” “
37268	37276	37231	37231	He	75	” She threw her head back defiantly . “
37288	37384	37231	37231	He	75	” As she spoke she became aware of a change in his face . He was no longer listening to her , he was only looking at her , with the passionate absorbed expression she had seen in his eyes after they had kissed on the stand at Nettleton . He was the new Harney again , the Harney abruptly revealed in that embrace , who seemed so penetrated with the joy of her presence that he was utterly careless of what she was thinking or feeling . He caught her hands with a laugh . “
37393	37415	37416	37416	You	1183	” he said gaily . He drew out the little packet of his letters and flourished them before her bewildered eyes . “
37459	37488	37440	37448	the young man who is running the Gospel tent	1187	” He drew back , holding her at arm 's length , and scrutinizing her troubled face with the minute searching gaze of his short - sighted eyes . “
37508	37557	37500	37500	You	1183	” he said ; and before she could answer he had kissed her again , not vehemently , but tenderly , almost fraternally , as if he had guessed her confused pain , and wanted her to know he understood it . He wound his fingers through hers . “
37579	37654	37655	37655	I	0	” He spoke with a boy 's gaiety , carelessly and confidently , as if nothing had happened that could shame or embarrass them ; and for a moment , in the sudden relief of her release from lonely pain , she felt herself yielding to his mood . But he had turned , and was drawing her back along the road by which she had come . She stiffened herself and stopped short . “
37661	37680	37655	37655	I	0	” she said . They looked at each other a moment in silence ; then he answered gently : “
37693	37709	37655	37655	I	0	” She remained motionless , gazing silently at the ground , and he went on : “
37732	37751	37724	37724	you	0	” Still she made no answer , and he continued , in the same tone of tender reassurance : “
37764	37784	37724	37724	you	0	” He took one of the hands that hung by her side and pressed his lips to the palm . “
37806	38145	37801	37801	I	0	” The little old house -- its wooden walls sun - bleached to a ghostly gray -- stood in an orchard above the road . The garden palings had fallen , but the broken gate dangled between its posts , and the path to the house was marked by rose - bushes run wild and hanging their small pale blossoms above the crowding grasses . Slender pilasters and an intricate fan - light framed the opening where the door had hung ; and the door itself lay rotting in the grass , with an old apple - tree fallen across it . Inside , also , wind and weather had blanched everything to the same wan silvery tint ; the house was as dry and pure as the interior of a long - empty shell . But it must have been exceptionally well built , for the little rooms had kept something of their human aspect : the wooden mantels with their neat classic ornaments were in place , and the corners of one ceiling retained a light film of plaster tracery . Harney had found an old bench at the back door and dragged it into the house . Charity sat on it , leaning her head against the wall in a state of drowsy lassitude . He had guessed that she was hungry and thirsty , and had brought her some tablets of chocolate from his bicycle - bag , and filled his drinking - cup from a spring in the orchard ; and now he sat at her feet , smoking a cigarette , and looking up at her without speaking . Outside , the afternoon shadows were lengthening across the grass , and through the empty window - frame that faced her she saw the Mountain thrusting its dark mass against a sultry sunset . It was time to go . She stood up , and he sprang to his feet also , and passed his arm through hers with an air of authority . “
38157	38167	38168	38168	I	0	” She looked at him and shook her head . “
38180	38181	38175	38175	You	69	” “
38188	38197	38185	38185	I	0	” She was silent , and he continued : “
38252	38253	38254	38254	I	0	” “
38263	38286	38254	38254	I	0	” He coloured a little at the retort , as though it had touched him in a way she did not suspect . “
38305	38306	38307	38307	I	0	” “
38337	38338	38322	38322	he	933	” “
38348	38349	38345	38345	you	1194	” “
38361	38372	38345	38345	you	1194	” She lowered her voice and looked away from him . “
38385	38409	38345	38345	you	1194	” Harney stared at her . For a moment he did not seem to seize her meaning ; then his face grew dark . “
38419	38431	38345	38345	you	1194	” His wrath blazed up , crimsoning him to the temples . “
38444	38458	38459	38459	I	0	” he broke off , as if his thoughts recoiled from the discovery . “
38467	38472	38459	38459	I	0	” she repeated doggedly . “
38474	38516	38517	38517	I	0	” he assented . There was a long interval of silence , during which she imagined that he was searching her face for more light on what she had revealed to him ; and a flush of shame swept over her . “
38527	38532	38521	38521	you	0	” she broke out , “
38539	38601	38603	38603	me	0	” But once more , as she spoke , she became aware that he was no longer listening . He came close and caught her to him as if he were snatching her from some imminent peril : his impetuous eyes were in hers , and she could feel the hard beat of his heart as he held her against it . “
38610	38826	38603	38603	me	0	” he said , pushing her hair back as if to draw her whole face up into his kiss . XII ONE afternoon toward the end of August a group of girls sat in a room at Miss Hatchard 's in a gay confusion of flags , turkey - red , blue and white paper muslin , harvest sheaves and illuminated scrolls . North Dormer was preparing for its Old Home Week . That form of sentimental decentralization was still in its early stages , and , precedents being few , and the desire to set an example contagious , the matter had become a subject of prolonged and passionate discussion under Miss Hatchard 's roof . The incentive to the celebration had come rather from those who had left North Dormer than from those who had been obliged to stay there , and there was some difficulty in rousing the village to the proper state of enthusiasm . But Miss Hatchard 's pale prim drawing - room was the centre of constant comings and goings from Hepburn , Nettleton , Springfield and even more distant cities ; and whenever a visitor arrived he was led across the hall , and treated to a glimpse of the group of girls deep in their pretty preparations . “
38837	38852	38603	38603	me	0	” Miss Hatchard would be heard , tapping across the hall on her crutches . “
38985	39150	39160	39160	he	75	” One of the first results of the Old Home Week agitation had , in fact , been the reappearance of Lucius Harney in the village street . He had been vaguely spoken of as being not far off , but for some weeks past no one had seen him at North Dormer , and there was a recent report of his having left Creston River , where he was said to have been staying , and gone away from the neighbourhood for good . Soon after Miss Hatchard 's return , however , he came back to his old quarters in her house , and began to take a leading part in the planning of the festivities . He threw himself into the idea with extraordinary good - humour , and was so prodigal of sketches , and so inexhaustible in devices , that he gave an immediate impetus to the rather languid movement , and infected the whole village with his enthusiasm . “
39172	40507	39160	39160	he	75	” Miss Hatchard would say , lingering on the last word , which was a favourite one . And before leading her visitor back to the drawing - room she would repeat , for the hundredth time , that she supposed he thought it very bold of little North Dormer to start up and have a Home Week of its own , when so many bigger places had n't thought of it yet ; but that , after all , Associations counted more than the size of the population , did n't they ? And of course North Dormer was so full of Associations ... historic , literary ( here a filial sigh for Honorius ) and ecclesiastical ... he knew about the old pewter communion service imported from England in 1769 , she supposed ? And it was so important , in a wealthy materialistic age , to set the example of reverting to the old ideals , the family and the homestead , and so on . This peroration usually carried her half - way back across the hall , leaving the girls to return to their interrupted activities . The day on which Charity Royall was weaving hemlock garlands for the procession was the last before the celebration . When Miss Hatchard called upon the North Dormer maidenhood to collaborate in the festal preparations Charity had at first held aloof ; but it had been made clear to her that her non - appearance might excite conjecture , and , reluctantly , she had joined the other workers . The girls , at first shy and embarrassed , and puzzled as to the exact nature of the projected commemoration , had soon become interested in the amusing details of their task , and excited by the notice they received . They would not for the world have missed their afternoons at Miss Hatchard 's , and , while they cut out and sewed and draped and pasted , their tongues kept up such an accompaniment to the sewing - machine that Charity 's silence sheltered itself unperceived under their chatter . In spirit she was still almost unconscious of the pleasant stir about her . Since her return to the red house , on the evening of the day when Harney had overtaken her on her way to the Mountain , she had lived at North Dormer as if she were suspended in the void . She had come back there because Harney , after appearing to agree to the impossibility of her doing so , had ended by persuading her that any other course would be madness . She had nothing further to fear from Mr. Royall . Of this she had declared herself sure , though she had failed to add , in his exoneration , that he had twice offered to make her his wife . Her hatred of him made it impossible , at the moment , for her to say anything that might partly excuse him in Harney 's eyes . Harney , however , once satisfied of her security , had found plenty of reasons for urging her to return . The first , and the most unanswerable , was that she had nowhere else to go . But the one on which he laid the greatest stress was that flight would be equivalent to avowal . If -- as was almost inevitable -- rumours of the scandalous scene at Nettleton should reach North Dormer , how else would her disappearance be interpreted ? Her guardian had publicly taken away her character , and she immediately vanished from his house . Seekers after motives could hardly fail to draw an unkind conclusion . But if she came back at once , and was seen leading her usual life , the incident was reduced to its true proportions , as the outbreak of a drunken old man furious at being surprised in disreputable company . People would say that Mr. Royall had insulted his ward to justify himself , and the sordid tale would fall into its place in the chronicle of his obscure debaucheries . Charity saw the force of the argument ; but if she acquiesced it was not so much because of that as because it was Harney 's wish . Since that evening in the deserted house she could imagine no reason for doing or not doing anything except the fact that Harney wished or did not wish it . All her tossing contradictory impulses were merged in a fatalistic acceptance of his will . It was not that she felt in him any ascendancy of character -- there were moments already when she knew she was the stronger -- but that all the rest of life had become a mere cloudy rim about the central glory of their passion . Whenever she stopped thinking about that for a moment she felt as she sometimes did after lying on the grass and staring up too long at the sky ; her eyes were so full of light that everything about her was a blur . Each time that Miss Hatchard , in the course of her periodical incursions into the work - room , dropped an allusion to her young cousin , the architect , the effect was the same on Charity . The hemlock garland she was wearing fell to her knees and she sat in a kind of trance . It was so manifestly absurd that Miss Hatchard should talk of Harney in that familiar possessive way , as if she had any claim on him , or knew anything about him . She , Charity Royall , was the only being on earth who really knew him , knew him from the soles of his feet to the rumpled crest of his hair , knew the shifting lights in his eyes , and the inflexions of his voice , and the things he liked and disliked , and everything there was to know about him , as minutely and yet unconsciously as a child knows the walls of the room it wakes up in every morning . It was this fact , which nobody about her guessed , or would have understood , that made her life something apart and inviolable , as if nothing had any power to hurt or disturb her as long as her secret was safe . The room in which the girls sat was the one which had been Harney 's bedroom . He had been sent upstairs , to make room for the Home Week workers ; but the furniture had not been moved , and as Charity sat there she had perpetually before her the vision she had looked in on from the midnight garden . The table at which Harney had sat was the one about which the girls were gathered ; and her own seat was near the bed on which she had seen him lying . Sometimes , when the others were not looking , she bent over as if to pick up something , and laid her cheek for a moment against the pillow . Toward sunset the girls disbanded . Their work was done , and the next morning at daylight the draperies and garlands were to be nailed up , and the illuminated scrolls put in place in the Town Hall . The first guests were to drive over from Hepburn in time for the midday banquet under a tent in Miss Hatchard 's field ; and after that the ceremonies were to begin . Miss Hatchard , pale with fatigue and excitement , thanked her young assistants , and stood in the porch , leaning on her crutches and waving a farewell as she watched them troop away down the street . Charity had slipped off among the first ; but at the gate she heard Ally Hawes calling after her , and reluctantly turned . “
40519	40530	40509	40509	you	1209	” Ally asked , looking at her with wistful admiration . “
40549	40558	40531	40531	I	0	” Charity gazed at her with dazzled eyes . “
40565	40609	40531	40531	I	0	” she said , and hastened away without listening to Ally 's protest . She wanted her dress to be as pretty as the other girls'--wanted it , in fact , to outshine the rest , since she was to take part in the “
40610	41975	40531	40531	I	0	exercises”--but she had no time just then to fix her mind on such matters .... She sped up the street to the library , of which she had the key about her neck . From the passage at the back she dragged forth a bicycle , and guided it to the edge of the street . She looked about to see if any of the girls were approaching ; but they had drifted away together toward the Town Hall , and she sprang into the saddle and turned toward the Creston road . There was an almost continual descent to Creston , and with her feet against the pedals she floated through the still evening air like one of the hawks she had often watched slanting downward on motionless wings . Twenty minutes from the time when she had left Miss Hatchard 's door she was turning up the wood - road on which Harney had overtaken her on the day of her flight ; and a few minutes afterward she had jumped from her bicycle at the gate of the deserted house . In the gold - powdered sunset it looked more than ever like some frail shell dried and washed by many seasons ; but at the back , whither Charity advanced , drawing her bicycle after her , there were signs of recent habitation . A rough door made of boards hung in the kitchen doorway , and pushing it open she entered a room furnished in primitive camping fashion . In the window was a table , also made of boards , with an earthenware jar holding a big bunch of wild asters , two canvas chairs stood near by , and in one corner was a mattress with a Mexican blanket over it . The room was empty , and leaning her bicycle against the house Charity clambered up the slope and sat down on a rock under an old apple - tree . The air was perfectly still , and from where she sat she would be able to hear the tinkle of a bicycle - bell a long way down the road .... She was always glad when she got to the little house before Harney . She liked to have time to take in every detail of its secret sweetness -- the shadows of the apple - trees swaying on the grass , the old walnuts rounding their domes below the road , the meadows sloping westward in the afternoon light -- before his first kiss blotted it all out . Everything unrelated to the hours spent in that tranquil place was as faint as the remembrance of a dream . The only reality was the wondrous unfolding of her new self , the reaching out to the light of all her contracted tendrils . She had lived all her life among people whose sensibilities seemed to have withered for lack of use ; and more wonderful , at first , than Harney 's endearments were the words that were a part of them . She had always thought of love as something confused and furtive , and he made it as bright and open as the summer air . On the morrow of the day when she had shown him the way to the deserted house he had packed up and left Creston River for Boston ; but at the first station he had jumped on the train with a hand - bag and scrambled up into the hills . For two golden rainless August weeks he had camped in the house , getting eggs and milk from the solitary farm in the valley , where no one knew him , and doing his cooking over a spirit - lamp . He got up every day with the sun , took a plunge in a brown pool he knew of , and spent long hours lying in the scented hemlock - woods above the house , or wandering along the yoke of the Eagle Ridge , far above the misty blue valleys that swept away east and west between the endless hills . And in the afternoon Charity came to him . With part of what was left of her savings she had hired a bicycle for a month , and every day after dinner , as soon as her guardian started to his office , she hurried to the library , got out her bicycle , and flew down the Creston road . She knew that Mr. Royall , like everyone else in North Dormer , was perfectly aware of her acquisition : possibly he , as well as the rest of the village , knew what use she made of it . She did not care : she felt him to be so powerless that if he had questioned her she would probably have told him the truth . But they had never spoken to each other since the night on the wharf at Nettleton . He had returned to North Dormer only on the third day after that encounter , arriving just as Charity and Verena were sitting down to supper . He had drawn up his chair , taken his napkin from the side - board drawer , pulled it out of its ring , and seated himself as unconcernedly as if he had come in from his usual afternoon session at Carrick Fry 's ; and the long habit of the household made it seem almost natural that Charity should not so much as raise her eyes when he entered . She had simply let him understand that her silence was not accidental by leaving the table while he was still eating , and going up without a word to shut herself into her room . After that he formed the habit of talking loudly and genially to Verena whenever Charity was in the room ; but otherwise there was no apparent change in their relations . She did not think connectedly of these things while she sat waiting for Harney , but they remained in her mind as a sullen background against which her short hours with him flamed out like forest fires . Nothing else mattered , neither the good nor the bad , or what might have seemed so before she knew him . He had caught her up and carried her away into a new world , from which , at stated hours , the ghost of her came back to perform certain customary acts , but all so thinly and insubstantially that she sometimes wondered that the people she went about among could see her .... Behind the swarthy Mountain the sun had gone down in waveless gold . From a pasture up the slope a tinkle of cow - bells sounded ; a puff of smoke hung over the farm in the valley , trailed on the pure air and was gone . For a few minutes , in the clear light that is all shadow , fields and woods were outlined with an unreal precision ; then the twilight blotted them out , and the little house turned gray and spectral under its wizened apple - branches . Charity 's heart contracted . The first fall of night after a day of radiance often gave her a sense of hidden menace : it was like looking out over the world as it would be when love had gone from it . She wondered if some day she would sit in that same place and watch in vain for her lover .... His bicycle - bell sounded down the lane , and in a minute she was at the gate and his eyes were laughing in hers . They walked back through the long grass , and pushed open the door behind the house . The room at first seemed quite dark and they had to grope their way in hand in hand . Through the window - frame the sky looked light by contrast , and above the black mass of asters in the earthen jar one white star glimmered like a moth . “
41988	41993	40531	40531	I	0	” Harney was explaining , “
42017	42197	42198	42198	She	1212	” He had his arms about her , and his kisses were in her hair and on her lips . Under his touch things deep down in her struggled to the light and sprang up like flowers in sunshine . She twisted her fingers into his , and they sat down side by side on the improvised couch . She hardly heard his excuses for being late : in his absence a thousand doubts tormented her , but as soon as he appeared she ceased to wonder where he had come from , what had delayed him , who had kept him from her . It seemed as if the places he had been in , and the people he had been with , must cease to exist when he left them , just as her own life was suspended in his absence . He continued , now , to talk to her volubly and gaily , deploring his lateness , grumbling at the demands on his time , and good - humouredly mimicking Miss Hatchard 's benevolent agitation . “
42223	42232	42198	42198	She	1212	” Charity was silent , and he added : “
42251	42298	42243	42245	No one else	283	” Charity made no answer : She did not care what part her guardian played in the morrow 's ceremonies . Like all the other figures peopling her meagre world he had grown non - existent to her . She had even put off hating him . “
42309	42313	42300	42300	I	0	” Harney continued . “
42342	42378	42329	42329	you	1212	” Any other girl ? Were there any others ? She had forgotten even that peril , so enclosed did he and she seem in their secret world . Her heart gave a frightened jerk . “
42383	42393	42394	42394	You	1212	” He laughed and took her in his arms . “
42404	42677	42394	42394	You	1212	” He pushed the hair from her forehead , bending her face back , as his way was , and leaning over so that his head loomed black between her eyes and the paleness of the sky , in which the white star floated ... Side by side they sped back along the dark wood - road to the village . A late moon was rising , full orbed and fiery , turning the mountain ranges from fluid gray to a massive blackness , and making the upper sky so light that the stars looked as faint as their own reflections in water . At the edge of the wood , half a mile from North Dormer , Harney jumped from his bicycle , took Charity in his arms for a last kiss , and then waited while she went on alone . They were later than usual , and instead of taking the bicycle to the library she propped it against the back of the wood - shed and entered the kitchen of the red house . Verena sat there alone ; when Charity came in she looked at her with mild impenetrable eyes and then took a plate and a glass of milk from the shelf and set them silently on the table . Charity nodded her thanks , and sitting down , fell hungrily upon her piece of pie and emptied the glass . Her face burned with her quick flight through the night , and her eyes were dazzled by the twinkle of the kitchen lamp . She felt like a night - bird suddenly caught and caged . “
42686	42690	42691	42691	He	1217	” Verena said . “
42698	43466	42691	42691	He	1217	” Charity took no notice . Her soul was still winging through the forest . She washed her plate and tumbler , and then felt her way up the dark stairs . When she opened her door a wonder arrested her . Before going out she had closed her shutters against the afternoon heat , but they had swung partly open , and a bar of moonlight , crossing the room , rested on her bed and showed a dress of China silk laid out on it in virgin whiteness . Charity had spent more than she could afford on the dress , which was to surpass those of all the other girls ; she had wanted to let North Dormer see that she was worthy of Harney 's admiration . Above the dress , folded on the pillow , was the white veil which the young women who took part in the exercises were to wear under a wreath of asters ; and beside the veil a pair of slim white satin shoes that Ally had produced from an old trunk in which she stored mysterious treasures . Charity stood gazing at all the outspread whiteness . It recalled a vision that had come to her in the night after her first meeting with Harney . She no longer had such visions ... warmer splendours had displaced them ... but it was stupid of Ally to have paraded all those white things on her bed , exactly as Hattie Targatt 's wedding dress from Springfield had been spread out for the neighbours to see when she married Tom Fry .... Charity took up the satin shoes and looked at them curiously . By day , no doubt , they would appear a little worn , but in the moonlight they seemed carved of ivory . She sat down on the floor to try them on , and they fitted her perfectly , though when she stood up she lurched a little on the high heels . She looked down at her feet , which the graceful mould of the slippers had marvellously arched and narrowed . She had never seen such shoes before , even in the shop - windows at Nettleton ... never , except ... yes , once , she had noticed a pair of the same shape on Annabel Balch . A blush of mortification swept over her . Ally sometimes sewed for Miss Balch when that brilliant being descended on North Dormer , and no doubt she picked up presents of cast - off clothing : the treasures in the mysterious trunk all came from the people she worked for ; there could be no doubt that the white slippers were Annabel Balch 's .... As she stood there , staring down moodily at her feet , she heard the triple click - click - click of a bicycle - bell under her window . It was Harney 's secret signal as he passed on his way home . She stumbled to the window on her high heels , flung open the shutters and leaned out . He waved to her and sped by , his black shadow dancing merrily ahead of him down the empty moonlit road ; and she leaned there watching him till he vanished under the Hatchard spruces . XIII THE Town Hall was crowded and exceedingly hot . As Charity marched into it third in the white muslin file headed by Orma Fry , she was conscious mainly of the brilliant effect of the wreathed columns framing the green - carpeted stage toward which she was moving ; and of the unfamiliar faces turning from the front rows to watch the advance of the procession . But it was all a bewildering blur of eyes and colours till she found herself standing at the back of the stage , her great bunch of asters and goldenrod held well in front of her , and answering the nervous glance of Lambert Sollas , the organist from Mr. Miles 's church , who had come up from Nettleton to play the harmonium and sat behind it , his conductor 's eye running over the fluttered girls . A moment later Mr. Miles , pink and twinkling , emerged from the background , as if buoyed up on his broad white gown , and briskly dominated the bowed heads in the front rows . He prayed energetically and briefly and then retired , and a fierce nod from Lambert Sollas warned the girls that they were to follow at once with “
43472	44013	42691	42691	He	1217	” It was a joy to Charity to sing : it seemed as though , for the first time , her secret rapture might burst from her and flash its defiance at the world . All the glow in her blood , the breath of the summer earth , the rustle of the forest , the fresh call of birds at sunrise , and the brooding midday languors , seemed to pass into her untrained voice , lifted and led by the sustaining chorus . And then suddenly the song was over , and after an uncertain pause , during which Miss Hatchard 's pearl - grey gloves started a furtive signalling down the hall , Mr. Royall , emerging in turn , ascended the steps of the stage and appeared behind the flower - wreathed desk . He passed close to Charity , and she noticed that his gravely set face wore the look of majesty that used to awe and fascinate her childhood . His frock - coat had been carefully brushed and ironed , and the ends of his narrow black tie were so nearly even that the tying must have cost him a protracted struggle . His appearance struck her all the more because it was the first time she had looked him full in the face since the night at Nettleton , and nothing in his grave and impressive demeanour revealed a trace of the lamentable figure on the wharf . He stood a moment behind the desk , resting his finger - tips against it , and bending slightly toward his audience ; then he straightened himself and began . At first she paid no heed to what he was saying : only fragments of sentences , sonorous quotations , allusions to illustrious men , including the obligatory tribute to Honorius Hatchard , drifted past her inattentive ears . She was trying to discover Harney among the notable people in the front row ; but he was nowhere near Miss Hatchard , who , crowned by a pearl - grey hat that matched her gloves , sat just below the desk , supported by Mrs. Miles and an important - looking unknown lady . Charity was near one end of the stage , and from where she sat the other end of the first row of seats was cut off by the screen of foliage masking the harmonium . The effort to see Harney around the corner of the screen , or through its interstices , made her unconscious of everything else ; but the effort was unsuccessful , and gradually she found her attention arrested by her guardian 's discourse . She had never heard him speak in public before , but she was familiar with the rolling music of his voice when he read aloud , or held forth to the selectmen about the stove at Carrick Fry 's . Today his inflections were richer and graver than she had ever known them : he spoke slowly , with pauses that seemed to invite his hearers to silent participation in his thought ; and Charity perceived a light of response in their faces . He was nearing the end of his address ... “
44018	44022	42691	42691	He	1217	” he said , “
44131	44147	44148	44148	My	0	” He paused , and there was a sense of suspense in the listening hall . “
44231	44241	44224	44224	they	1233	” He looked about him , and repeated gravely : “
44326	44614	44615	44615	He	1242	“ Gentlemen , let us look at things as they are . Some of us have come back to our native town because we 'd failed to get on elsewhere . One way or other , things had gone wrong with us ... what we 'd dreamed of had n't come true . But the fact that we had failed elsewhere is no reason why we should fail here . Our very experiments in larger places , even if they were unsuccessful , ought to have helped us to make North Dormer a larger place ... and you young men who are preparing even now to follow the call of ambition , and turn your back on the old homes -- well , let me say this to you , that if ever you do come back to them it 's worth while to come back to them for their good .... And to do that , you must keep on loving them while you 're away from them ; and even if you come back against your will -- and thinking it 's all a bitter mistake of Fate or Providence -- you must try to make the best of it , and to make the best of your old town ; and after a while -- well , ladies and gentlemen , I give you my recipe for what it 's worth ; after a while , I believe you 'll be able to say , as I can say today : ' I 'm glad I 'm here . ' Believe me , all of you , the best way to help the places we live in is to be glad we live there . ”
44656	44661	44684	44684	they	1245	“ Hear , hear ! ”
44696	44702	44703	44703	He	67	“ That was a MAN talking---- ”
45479	45589	45590	45590	He	2371	“ A rich harvest of hallowed memories .... A sanctified hour to which , in moments of trial , your thoughts will prayerfully return .... And now , O Lord , let us humbly and fervently give thanks for this blessed day of reunion , here in the old home to which we have come back from so far . Preserve it to us , O Lord , in times to come , in all its homely sweetness -- in the kindliness and wisdom of its old people , in the courage and industry of its young men , in the piety and purity of this group of innocent girls---- ”
45617	45622	45608	45608	his	2371	“ Auld Lang Syne . ”
46569	46576	46565	46565	she	69	“ Have you slipped the chain ? ”
46628	46635	46636	46636	she	69	“ What have you come for ? ”
46662	46670	46671	46671	he	64	“ Because I knew you were here , ”
46727	46730	46731	46731	he	64	“ Charity , ”
46734	46750	46731	46731	he	64	“ he 'll be here in a minute . Let me talk to you first . ”
46751	46769	46721	46722	Mr. Royall	64	“ You 've got no right to talk to me . I can do what I please . ”
46770	46781	46731	46731	he	64	“ Yes . What is it you mean to do ? ”
46782	46793	46794	46794	He	64	“ I need n't answer that , or anything else . ”
46852	46860	46861	46861	he	64	“ So this is where you meet , ”
46903	47042	47043	47043	She	1309	“ See here , Charity -- you're always telling me I 've got no rights over you . There might be two ways of looking at that -- but I ai n't going to argue it . All I know is I raised you as good as I could , and meant fairly by you always except once , for a bad half - hour . There 's no justice in weighing that half - hour against the rest , and you know it . If you had n't , you would n't have gone on living under my roof . Seems to me the fact of your doing that gives me some sort of a right ; the right to try and keep you out of trouble . I 'm not asking you to consider any other . ”
47055	47064	47065	47065	she	1309	“ Better wait till I 'm in trouble , ”

47321	47363	47307	47307	he	75	“ Miss Royall is not a child . Is n't it rather absurd to talk of her as if she were ? I believe she considers herself free to come and go as she pleases , without any questions from anyone . ”

I 'm the only one that was fool enough not to know that ; and I guess nobody'll repeat my mistake -- not in Eagle County , anyhow . They all know what she is , and what she came from . They all know her mother was a woman of the town from Nettleton , that followed one of those Mountain fellows up to his place and lived there with him like a heathen . I saw her there sixteen years ago , when I went to bring this child down . I went to save her from the kind of life her mother was leading -- but I 'd better have left her in the kennel she came from .... ”

60209	60235	60197	60198	Mr. Royall	64	“ Yes , there was a mother ; but she was glad to have the child go . She 'd have given her to anybody .... ”
61685	61704	61681	61681	he	64	“ The minister told me he 'd left you up here , so I come up for you . ”
61744	61779	61732	61733	Mr. Royall	64	“ Get along there , Dan .... I gave him a rest at Hamblin ; but I brought him along pretty quick , and it 's a stiff pull up here against the wind . ”
61870	61894	61866	61866	he	64	“ It was a day just like this , only spitting snow , when I come up here for you the first time . ”
61917	61932	61913	61913	he	64	“ I dunno 's you think it was such a good job , either . ”
61933	61939	61940	61940	she	69	“ Yes , I do , ”
61949	61952	61953	61953	he	64	“ Well , ”
61956	61959	61953	61953	he	64	“ I tried---- ”
61977	61987	61988	61988	he	64	“ Ho , there , Dan , step out , ”
61995	62003	62004	62004	he	64	“ We ai n't home yet.--You cold ? ”
62113	62116	62117	62117	he	64	“ Charity , ”
62120	62169	62117	62117	he	64	“ you look fair done up , and North Dormer 's a goodish way off . I 've figured out that we 'd do better to stop here long enough for you to get a mouthful of breakfast and then drive down to Creston and take the train . ”
62178	62185	62172	62172	herself	69	“ The train -- what train ? ”
62210	62219	62220	62220	he	64	“ This is old Mrs. Hobart 's place , ”
62223	62233	62220	62220	he	64	“ She 'll give us something hot to drink . ”
62309	62333	62304	62304	his	64	“ Well , Mrs. Hobart , you got any breakfast for this young lady ? You can see she 's cold and hungry . ”
62350	62359	62360	62360	she	143	“ My , you do look pretty mean , ”
62541	62546	62547	62547	he	64	“ Now , then , ”
62550	62559	62547	62547	he	64	“ if you 're a mind to go along---- ”
62569	62584	62566	62566	he	64	“ We can pick up the noon train for Nettleton if you say so . ”
62645	62728	62729	62729	His	64	“ You and me have spoke some hard things to each other in our time , Charity ; and there 's no good that I can see in any more talking now . But I 'll never feel any way but one about you ; and if you say so we 'll drive down in time to catch that train , and go straight to the minister 's house ; and when you come back home you 'll come as Mrs. Royall . ”
62775	62780	62781	62781	she	69	“ Oh , I can't---- ”
62786	62791	62781	62781	she	69	“ Ca n't what ? ”
62840	62868	62827	62827	She	69	“ I know I ai n't been fair to you always ; but I want to be now .... I want you to know ... I want ... ”
62907	62915	62916	62916	he	64	“ What 's all this about wanting ? ”
62922	62958	62916	62916	he	64	“ Do you know what you really want ? I 'll tell you . You want to be took home and took care of . And I guess that 's all there is to say . ”
62959	62967	62884	62884	He	64	“ No ... it 's not all .... ”
62968	62973	62974	62974	He	64	“ Ai n't it ? ”
62980	63049	62977	62977	his	64	“ Well , I 'll tell you another thing . All I want is to know if you 'll marry me . If there was anything else , I 'd tell you so ; but there ai n't . Come to my age , a man knows the things that matter and the things that do n't ; that 's about the only good turn life does us . ”
63083	63090	63091	63091	he	64	“ Do n't cry , Charity , ”
63112	63116	63117	63117	he	64	“ See here , ”
63121	63146	63117	63117	he	64	“ old Dan 's come a long distance , and we 've got to let him take it easy the rest of the way .... ”
64031	64033	64002	64003	Mr. Royall	64	“ hack ”
64187	64198	64179	64179	he	64	“ Your hair 's got kinder loose with the wind , ”
64470	64515	64516	64516	Charity	69	“ I require and charge you both , as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed , that if either of you know any impediment whereby ye may not be lawfully joined together ... ”
64536	64540	64543	64543	him	64	“ I will ! ”
65158	65167	65168	65168	he	64	“ What are you doing in the dark ? ”
65232	65247	65228	65229	Mr. Royall	64	“ We 'll step down and have some supper , if you say so . ”
65460	65480	65481	65481	he	64	“ You go right along up to bed -- I'm going to sit down here and have my smoke , ”
65647	65660	65661	65661	she	69	“ What have I done ? Oh , what have I done ? ”
66077	66097	66098	66098	He	64	“ I guess while I 'm doing it you 'd better step out and buy yourself whatever you need . ”
66108	66122	66098	66098	He	64	“ You know I always wanted you to beat all the other girls . ”
66153	66176	66177	66177	he	64	“ If it ai n't enough there 's more where that come from -- I want you to beat 'em all hollow , ”
66370	66397	66398	66398	she	69	“ I thought you 'd be back , but you 've come a mite too soon : I told you to be patient and not fret , ”
66416	66426	66427	66427	she	69	“ I 've come to get my blue brooch , ”
66432	66436	66427	66427	she	69	“ Your brooch ? ”
66444	66490	66491	66491	She	69	“ My , yes -- I get so many things of that kind . Well , my dear , you 'll have to wait while I get it out of the safe . I do n't leave valuables like that laying round like the noospaper . ”
66539	66546	66547	66547	she	69	“ Have you got the change ? ”
66565	66584	66547	66547	she	69	“ Change ? What 'd I want to have change for ? I only see two twenties there , ”
66595	66608	66590	66590	Charity	69	“ I thought ... you said it was five dollars a visit .... ”
66609	66667	66668	66668	Charity	69	“ For YOU , as a favour -- I did . But how about the responsibility and the insurance ? I do n't s'pose you ever thought of that ? This pin 's worth a hundred dollars easy . If it had got lost or stole , where 'd I been when you come to claim it ? ”
66690	66725	66726	66726	She	121	“ I did n't ask you for your brooch , my dear . I 'd a good deal ruther folks paid me my regular charge than have 'em put me to all this trouble . ”
66752	66758	66759	66759	she	121	“ Will you take that ? ”
66762	66797	66759	66759	she	121	“ No , I wo n't take that , my dear ; but I 'll take it with its mate , and hand you over a signed receipt if you do n't trust me . ”
66798	66812	66813	66813	Charity	69	“ Oh , but I can't -- it 's all I 've got , ”
66828	66891	66816	66817	Dr. Merkle	121	“ It seems you got married yesterday , up to the ' Piscopal church ; I heard all about the wedding from the minister 's chore - man . It would be a pity , would n't it , to let Mr. Royall know you had an account running here ? I just put it to you as your own mother might . ”
67504	67522	67523	67523	he	75	“ Well , did you rig yourself out handsomely ? I have n't seen any bundles round , ”
67527	67543	67544	67544	she	69	“ Oh , I 'd rather let Ally Hawes make the few things I want , ”
67547	67551	67552	67552	He	75	“ That so ? ”
67577	67608	67571	67571	his	75	“ Well , I wanted you to go back looking stylisher than any of them ; but I guess you 're right . You 're a good girl , Charity . ”
67636	67645	67646	67646	she	69	“ I guess you 're good , too , ”
