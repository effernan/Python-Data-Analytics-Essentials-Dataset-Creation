Still it does not appear ( which is strange ) to have procured for him any lucrative post at court or elsewhere , or to have conferred upon him any other distinction than that which was necessarily included in the countenance of so great a man , and the being invited by him to certain entertainment ’s , so splendid and costly in their nature , that he calls them ‘
3991	6137	3899	3900	his nephew	863	’ It is needless to multiply instances of the high and lofty station , and the vast importance of the Chuzzlewits , at different periods . If it came within the scope of reasonable probability that further proofs were required , they might be heaped upon each other until they formed an Alps of testimony , beneath which the boldest scepticism should be crushed and beaten flat . As a goodly tumulus is already collected , and decently battened up above the Family grave , the present chapter is content to leave it as it is : merely adding , by way of a final spadeful , that many Chuzzlewits , both male and female , are proved to demonstration , on the faith of letters written by their own mothers , to have had chiselled noses , undeniable chins , forms that might have served the sculptor for a model , exquisitely - turned limbs and polished foreheads of so transparent a texture that the blue veins might be seen branching off in various directions , like so many roads on an ethereal map . This fact in itself , though it had been a solitary one , would have utterly settled and clenched the business in hand ; for it is well known , on the authority of all the books which treat of such matters , that every one of these phenomena , but especially that of the chiselling , are invariably peculiar to , and only make themselves apparent in , persons of the very best condition . This history having , to its own perfect satisfaction , ( and , consequently , to the full contentment of all its readers , ) proved the Chuzzlewits to have had an origin , and to have been at one time or other of an importance which can not fail to render them highly improving and acceptable acquaintance to all right - minded individuals , may now proceed in earnest with its task . And having shown that they must have had , by reason of their ancient birth , a pretty large share in the foundation and increase of the human family , it will one day become its province to submit , that such of its members as shall be introduced in these pages , have still many counterparts and prototypes in the Great World about us . At present it contents itself with remarking , in a general way , on this head : Firstly , that it may be safely asserted , and yet without implying any direct participation in the Manboddo doctrine touching the probability of the human race having once been monkeys , that men do play very strange and extraordinary tricks . Secondly , and yet without trenching on the Blumenbach theory as to the descendants of Adam having a vast number of qualities which belong more particularly to swine than to any other class of animals in the creation , that some men certainly are remarkable for taking uncommon good care of themselves . CHAPTER TWO WHEREIN CERTAIN PERSONS ARE PRESENTED TO THE READER , WITH WHOM HE MAY , IF HE PLEASE , BECOME BETTER ACQUAINTED It was pretty late in the autumn of the year , when the declining sun struggling through the mist which had obscured it all day , looked brightly down upon a little Wiltshire village , within an easy journey of the fair old town of Salisbury . Like a sudden flash of memory or spirit kindling up the mind of an old man , it shed a glory upon the scene , in which its departed youth and freshness seemed to live again . The wet grass sparkled in the light ; the scanty patches of verdure in the hedges -- where a few green twigs yet stood together bravely , resisting to the last the tyranny of nipping winds and early frosts -- took heart and brightened up ; the stream which had been dull and sullen all day long , broke out into a cheerful smile ; the birds began to chirp and twitter on the naked boughs , as though the hopeful creatures half believed that winter had gone by , and spring had come already . The vane upon the tapering spire of the old church glistened from its lofty station in sympathy with the general gladness ; and from the ivy - shaded windows such gleams of light shone back upon the glowing sky , that it seemed as if the quiet buildings were the hoarding - place of twenty summers , and all their ruddiness and warmth were stored within . Even those tokens of the season which emphatically whispered of the coming winter , graced the landscape , and , for the moment , tinged its livelier features with no oppressive air of sadness . The fallen leaves , with which the ground was strewn , gave forth a pleasant fragrance , and subduing all harsh sounds of distant feet and wheels created a repose in gentle unison with the light scattering of seed hither and thither by the distant husbandman , and with the noiseless passage of the plough as it turned up the rich brown earth , and wrought a graceful pattern in the stubbled fields . On the motionless branches of some trees , autumn berries hung like clusters of coral beads , as in those fabled orchards where the fruits were jewels ; others stripped of all their garniture , stood , each the centre of its little heap of bright red leaves , watching their slow decay ; others again , still wearing theirs , had them all crunched and crackled up , as though they had been burnt ; about the stems of some were piled , in ruddy mounds , the apples they had borne that year ; while others ( hardy evergreens this class ) showed somewhat stern and gloomy in their vigour , as charged by nature with the admonition that it is not to her more sensitive and joyous favourites she grants the longest term of life . Still athwart their darker boughs , the sunbeams struck out paths of deeper gold ; and the red light , mantling in among their swarthy branches , used them as foils to set its brightness off , and aid the lustre of the dying day . A moment , and its glory was no more . The sun went down beneath the long dark lines of hill and cloud which piled up in the west an airy city , wall heaped on wall , and battlement on battlement ; the light was all withdrawn ; the shining church turned cold and dark ; the stream forgot to smile ; the birds were silent ; and the gloom of winter dwelt on everything . An evening wind uprose too , and the slighter branches cracked and rattled as they moved , in skeleton dances , to its moaning music . The withering leaves no longer quiet , hurried to and fro in search of shelter from its chill pursuit ; the labourer unyoked his horses , and with head bent down , trudged briskly home beside them ; and from the cottage windows lights began to glance and wink upon the darkening fields . Then the village forge came out in all its bright importance . The lusty bellows roared Ha ha ! to the clear fire , which roared in turn , and bade the shining sparks dance gayly to the merry clinking of the hammers on the anvil . The gleaming iron , in its emulation , sparkled too , and shed its red - hot gems around profusely . The strong smith and his men dealt such strokes upon their work , as made even the melancholy night rejoice , and brought a glow into its dark face as it hovered about the door and windows , peeping curiously in above the shoulders of a dozen loungers . As to this idle company , there they stood , spellbound by the place , and , casting now and then a glance upon the darkness in their rear , settled their lazy elbows more at ease upon the sill , and leaned a little further in : no more disposed to tear themselves away than if they had been born to cluster round the blazing hearth like so many crickets . Out upon the angry wind ! how from sighing , it began to bluster round the merry forge , banging at the wicket , and grumbling in the chimney , as if it bullied the jolly bellows for doing anything to order . And what an impotent swaggerer it was too , for all its noise ; for if it had any influence on that hoarse companion , it was but to make him roar his cheerful song the louder , and by consequence to make the fire burn the brighter , and the sparks to dance more gayly yet ; at length , they whizzed so madly round and round , that it was too much for such a surly wind to bear ; so off it flew with a howl giving the old sign before the ale - house door such a cuff as it went , that the Blue Dragon was more rampant than usual ever afterwards , and indeed , before Christmas , reared clean out of its crazy frame . It was small tyranny for a respectable wind to go wreaking its vengeance on such poor creatures as the fallen leaves , but this wind happening to come up with a great heap of them just after venting its humour on the insulted Dragon , did so disperse and scatter them that they fled away , pell - mell , some here , some there , rolling over each other , whirling round and round upon their thin edges , taking frantic flights into the air , and playing all manner of extraordinary gambols in the extremity of their distress . Nor was this enough for its malicious fury ; for not content with driving them abroad , it charged small parties of them and hunted them into the wheel wright ’s saw - pit , and below the planks and timbers in the yard , and , scattering the sawdust in the air , it looked for them underneath , and when it did meet with any , whew ! how it drove them on and followed at their heels ! The scared leaves only flew the faster for all this , and a giddy chase it was ; for they got into unfrequented places , where there was no outlet , and where their pursuer kept them eddying round and round at his pleasure ; and they crept under the eaves of houses , and clung tightly to the sides of hay - ricks , like bats ; and tore in at open chamber windows , and cowered close to hedges ; and , in short , went anywhere for safety . But the oddest feat they achieved was , to take advantage of the sudden opening of Mr Pecksniff ’s front - door , to dash wildly into his passage ; whither the wind following close upon them , and finding the back - door open , incontinently blew out the lighted candle held by Miss Pecksniff , and slammed the front - door against Mr Pecksniff who was at that moment entering , with such violence , that in the twinkling of an eye he lay on his back at the bottom of the steps . Being by this time weary of such trifling performances , the boisterous rover hurried away rejoicing , roaring over moor and meadow , hill and flat , until it got out to sea , where it met with other winds similarly disposed , and made a night of it . In the meantime Mr Pecksniff , having received from a sharp angle in the bottom step but one , that sort of knock on the head which lights up , for the patient ’s entertainment , an imaginary general illumination of very bright short - sixes , lay placidly staring at his own street door . And it would seem to have been more suggestive in its aspect than street doors usually are ; for he continued to lie there , rather a lengthy and unreasonable time , without so much as wondering whether he was hurt or no ; neither , when Miss Pecksniff inquired through the key - hole in a shrill voice , which might have belonged to a wind in its teens , ‘
6141	6211	6212	6212	I	0	’ did he make any reply ; nor , when Miss Pecksniff opened the door again , and shading the candle with her hand , peered out , and looked provokingly round him , and about him , and over him , and everywhere but at him , did he offer any remark , or indicate in any manner the least hint of a desire to be picked up . ‘
6216	6230	6212	6212	I	0	’ cried Miss Pecksniff , to the ideal inflicter of a runaway knock . ‘
6238	6253	6254	6254	You	0	’ Still Mr Pecksniff , perhaps from having caught it already , said nothing . ‘
6255	6261	6263	6264	Miss Pecksniff	241	’re round the corner now , ’
6412	6416	6418	6419	Miss Pecksniff	241	‘ That voice ! ’
6421	6425	6418	6419	Miss Pecksniff	241	‘ My parent ! ’
6458	6461	6462	6462	they	870	‘ Pa ! ’
6467	6483	6462	6462	they	870	‘ Pa ! Speak , Pa ! Do not look so wild my dearest Pa ! ’
6585	6590	6592	6593	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ That ’ll do , ’
6595	6597	6592	6593	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I ’m
6600	6601	6592	6593	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ ‘
6608	6615	6616	6616	He	218	’ cried the youngest Miss Pecksniff . ‘
6620	6720	6616	6616	He	218	’ exclaimed the eldest . With these joyful words they kissed Mr Pecksniff on either cheek ; and bore him into the house . Presently , the youngest Miss Pecksniff ran out again to pick up his hat , his brown paper parcel , his umbrella , his gloves , and other small articles ; and that done , and the door closed , both young ladies applied themselves to tending Mr Pecksniff ’s wounds in the back parlour . They were not very serious in their nature ; being limited to abrasions on what the eldest Miss Pecksniff called ‘
6724	7087	6616	6616	He	218	’ of her parent ’s anatomy , such as his knees and elbows , and to the development of an entirely new organ , unknown to phrenologists , on the back of his head . These injuries having been comforted externally , with patches of pickled brown paper , and Mr Pecksniff having been comforted internally , with some stiff brandy - and - water , the eldest Miss Pecksniff sat down to make the tea , which was all ready . In the meantime the youngest Miss Pecksniff brought from the kitchen a smoking dish of ham and eggs , and , setting the same before her father , took up her station on a low stool at his feet ; thereby bringing her eyes on a level with the teaboard . It must not be inferred from this position of humility , that the youngest Miss Pecksniff was so young as to be , as one may say , forced to sit upon a stool , by reason of the shortness of her legs . Miss Pecksniff sat upon a stool because of her simplicity and innocence , which were very great , very great . Miss Pecksniff sat upon a stool because she was all girlishness , and playfulness , and wildness , and kittenish buoyancy . She was the most arch and at the same time the most artless creature , was the youngest Miss Pecksniff , that you can possibly imagine . It was her great charm . She was too fresh and guileless , and too full of child - like vivacity , was the youngest Miss Pecksniff , to wear combs in her hair , or to turn it up , or to frizzle it , or braid it . She wore it in a crop , a loosely flowing crop , which had so many rows of curls in it , that the top row was only one curl . Moderately buxom was her shape , and quite womanly too ; but sometimes -- yes , sometimes -- she even wore a pinafore ; and how charming THAT was ! Oh ! she was indeed ‘
7091	7617	7732	7734	the moral Pecksniff	875	’ ( as a young gentleman had observed in verse , in the Poet ’s Corner of a provincial newspaper ) , was the youngest Miss Pecksniff ! Mr Pecksniff was a moral man -- a grave man , a man of noble sentiments and speech -- and he had had her christened Mercy . Mercy ! oh , what a charming name for such a pure - souled Being as the youngest Miss Pecksniff ! Her sister ’s name was Charity . There was a good thing ! Mercy and Charity ! And Charity , with her fine strong sense and her mild , yet not reproachful gravity , was so well named , and did so well set off and illustrate her sister ! What a pleasant sight was that the contrast they presented ; to see each loved and loving one sympathizing with , and devoted to , and leaning on , and yet correcting and counter - checking , and , as it were , antidoting , the other ! To behold each damsel in her very admiration of her sister , setting up in business for herself on an entirely different principle , and announcing no connection with over - the - way , and if the quality of goods at that establishment do n’t please you , you are respectfully invited to favour ME with a call ! And the crowning circumstance of the whole delightful catalogue was , that both the fair creatures were so utterly unconscious of all this ! They had no idea of it . They no more thought or dreamed of it than Mr Pecksniff did . Nature played them off against each other ; THEY had no hand in it , the two Miss Pecksniffs . It has been remarked that Mr Pecksniff was a moral man . So he was . Perhaps there never was a more moral man than Mr Pecksniff , especially in his conversation and correspondence . It was once said of him by a homely admirer , that he had a Fortunatus ’s purse of good sentiments in his inside . In this particular he was like the girl in the fairy tale , except that if they were not actual diamonds which fell from his lips , they were the very brightest paste , and shone prodigiously . He was a most exemplary man ; fuller of virtuous precept than a copy book . Some people likened him to a direction - post , which is always telling the way to a place , and never goes there ; but these were his enemies , the shadows cast by his brightness ; that was all . His very throat was moral . You saw a good deal of it . You looked over a very low fence of white cravat ( whereof no man had ever beheld the tie for he fastened it behind ) , and there it lay , a valley between two jutting heights of collar , serene and whiskerless before you . It seemed to say , on the part of Mr Pecksniff , ‘
7637	7730	7732	7734	the moral Pecksniff	875	’ So did his hair , just grizzled with an iron - grey which was all brushed off his forehead , and stood bolt upright , or slightly drooped in kindred action with his heavy eyelids . So did his person , which was sleek though free from corpulency . So did his manner , which was soft and oily . In a word , even his plain black suit , and state of widower and dangling double eye - glass , all tended to the same purpose , and cried aloud , ‘
7736	7758	7732	7734	the moral Pecksniff	875	’ The brazen plate upon the door ( which being Mr Pecksniff ’s , could not lie ) bore this inscription , ‘
7763	7781	7761	7761	ARCHITECT	876	’ to which Mr Pecksniff , on his cards of business , added , AND LAND SURVEYOR . ’
8166	8178	8180	8181	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Even the worldly goods of which we have just disposed , ’
8192	8203	8180	8181	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ even cream , sugar , tea , toast , ham-- ’
8204	8208	8210	8210	Charity	241	‘ And eggs , ’
8216	8220	8222	8223	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ And eggs , ’
8225	8280	8222	8223	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ even they have their moral . See how they come and go ! Every pleasure is transitory . We ca n’t even eat , long . If we indulge in harmless fluids , we get the dropsy ; if in exciting liquids , we get drunk . What a soothing reflection is that ! ’
8281	8291	8293	8296	the eldest Miss Pecksniff	900	‘ Do n’t say WE get drunk , Pa , ’
8298	8307	8309	8310	her father	8909	‘ When I say we , my dear , ’
8312	8350	8352	8353	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I mean mankind in general ; the human race , considered as a body , and not as individuals . There is nothing personal in morality , my love . Even such a thing as this , ’
8376	8394	8361	8361	his	218	‘ slight casual baldness though it be , reminds us that we are but’--he was going to say ‘
8397	8412	8352	8353	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ but recollecting that worms were not remarkable for heads of hair , he substituted ‘
8417	8418	8352	8353	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ ‘
8421	8448	8352	8353	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ cried Mr Pecksniff after a pause , during which he seemed to have been casting about for a new moral , and not quite successfully , ‘
8469	8522	8455	8455	Mercy	244	’ The young lady obeyed , and having done so , resumed her stool , reposed one arm upon her father ’s knee , and laid her blooming cheek upon it . Miss Charity drew her chair nearer the fire , as one prepared for conversation , and looked towards her father . ‘
8525	8571	8455	8455	Mercy	244	’ said Mr Pecksniff , after a short pause , during which he had been silently smiling , and shaking his head at the fire--‘I have again been fortunate in the attainment of my object . A new inmate will very shortly come among us . ’
8572	8578	8580	8580	Charity	241	‘ A youth , papa ? ’
8582	8590	8592	8593	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Ye - es , a youth , ’
8595	8651	8592	8593	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ He will avail himself of the eligible opportunity which now offers , for uniting the advantages of the best practical architectural education with the comforts of a home , and the constant association with some who ( however humble their sphere , and limited their capacity ) are not unmindful of their moral responsibilities . ’
8652	8656	8658	8658	Mercy	244	‘ Oh Pa ! ’
8666	8670	8662	8662	her	244	‘ See advertisement ! ’
8671	8677	8679	8680	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Playful -- playful warbler , ’
8694	8697	8662	8662	her	244	‘ warbler , ’
8800	8807	8809	8811	the younger daughter	906	‘ Is he handsome , Pa ? ’
8813	8817	8819	8820	the eldest	8900	‘ Silly Merry ! ’
8828	8840	8809	8811	the younger daughter	906	‘ What is the premium , Pa ? tell us that . ’
8841	8849	8851	8852	Miss Mercy	244	‘ Oh , good gracious , Cherry ! ’
8867	8884	8851	8852	Miss Mercy	244	‘ what a mercenary girl you are ! oh you naughty , thoughtful , prudent thing ! ’
8922	8928	8930	8931	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ He is well looking , ’
8937	8953	8930	8931	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ well looking enough . I do not positively expect any immediate premium with him . ’
8997	9003	9005	9006	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ But what of that ! ’
9014	9067	9005	9006	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ There is disinterestedness in the world , I hope ? We are not all arrayed in two opposite ranks ; the OFfensive and the DEfensive . Some few there are who walk between ; who help the needy as they go ; and take no part with either side . Umph ! ’
9090	9109	9111	9112	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Oh ! let us not be for ever calculating , devising , and plotting for the future , ’
9137	9176	9125	9126	a man	913	‘ I am weary of such arts . If our inclinations are but good and open - hearted , let us gratify them boldly , though they bring upon us Loss instead of Profit . Eh , Charity ? ’
9270	9275	9277	9278	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Tut , tut , ’
9301	9338	9295	9295	he	218	‘ What folly is this ! Let us take heed how we laugh without reason lest we cry with it . What is the domestic news since yesterday ? John Westlock is gone , I hope ? ’
9339	9344	9346	9346	Charity	241	‘ Indeed , no , ’
9348	9353	9346	9346	Charity	241	‘ And why not ? ’
9358	9387	9346	9346	Charity	241	‘ His term expired yesterday . And his box was packed , I know ; for I saw it , in the morning , standing in the hall . ’
9388	9397	9399	9401	the young lady	8949	‘ He slept last night at the Dragon , ’
9403	9429	9399	9401	the young lady	8949	‘ and had Mr Pinch to dine with him . They spent the evening together , and Mr Pinch was not home till very late . ’
9430	9444	9446	9446	Mercy	244	‘ And when I saw him on the stairs this morning , Pa , ’
9452	9521	9446	9446	Mercy	244	‘ he looked , oh goodness , SUCH a monster ! with his face all manner of colours , and his eyes as dull as if they had been boiled , and his head aching dreadfully , I am sure from the look of it , and his clothes smelling , oh it ’s impossible to say how strong , oh’--here the young lady shuddered--‘of smoke and punch . ’
9522	9527	9532	9532	his	218	‘ Now I think , ’
9550	9635	9532	9532	his	218	‘ I think Mr Pinch might have done better than choose for his companion one who , at the close of a long intercourse , had endeavoured , as he knew , to wound my feelings . I am not quite sure that this was delicate in Mr Pinch . I am not quite sure that this was kind in Mr Pinch . I will go further and say , I am not quite sure that this was even ordinarily grateful in Mr Pinch . ’
9636	9646	9648	9648	Charity	241	‘ But what can anyone expect from Mr Pinch ! ’
9687	9692	9698	9698	his	8909	‘ Aye , aye , ’
9702	9784	9698	9698	his	8909	‘ it is very well to say what can we expect from Mr Pinch , but Mr Pinch is a fellow - creature , my dear ; Mr Pinch is an item in the vast total of humanity , my love ; and we have a right , it is our duty , to expect in Mr Pinch some development of those better qualities , the possession of which in our own persons inspires our humble self - respect . No , ’
9789	9874	9786	9787	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ No ! Heaven forbid that I should say , nothing can be expected from Mr Pinch ; or that I should say , nothing can be expected from any man alive ( even the most degraded , which Mr Pinch is not , no , really ) ; but Mr Pinch has disappointed me ; he has hurt me ; I think a little the worse of him on this account , but not if human nature . Oh , no , no ! ’
9875	9878	9880	9881	Miss Charity	241	‘ Hark ! ’
9899	9946	9949	9949	she	241	‘ There is the creature ! Now mark my words , he has come back with John Westlock for his box , and is going to help him to take it to the mail . Only mark my words , if that is n’t his intention ! ’
9989	9993	9995	9996	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Come in ! ’

10319	10342	10271	10271	he	218	‘ Pray be seated , Mr Pinch . Have the goodness to shut the door , Mr Pinch , if you please . ’
10343	10348	10350	10350	Pinch	221	‘ Certainly , sir , ’

11078	11133	11065	11066	the other	934	‘ Here ’s a pretty fellow ! Wrong ! Wrong I have done him ! He ’ll not even remember the five hundred pounds he had with me under false pretences ; or the seventy pounds a year for board and lodging that would have been dear at seventeen ! Here ’s a martyr ! ’

11144	11259	11141	11142	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ is the root of all evil . I grieve to see that it is already bearing evil fruit in you . But I will not remember its existence . I will not even remember the conduct of that misguided person’--and here , although he spoke like one at peace with all the world , he used an emphasis that plainly said “ I have my eye upon the rascal now”--‘that misguided person who has brought you here to - night , seeking to disturb ( it is a happiness to say , in vain ) the heart ’s repose and peace of one who would have shed his dearest blood to serve him . ’

11315	11376	11378	11379	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ entire and pure forgiveness is not incompatible with a wounded heart ; perchance when the heart is wounded , it becomes a greater virtue . With my breast still wrung and grieved to its inmost core by the ingratitude of that person , I am proud and glad to say that I forgive him . Nay ! I beg , ’
11392	11460	11462	11463	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I beg that individual not to offer a remark ; he will truly oblige me by not uttering one word , just now . I am not sure that I am equal to the trial . In a very short space of time , I shall have sufficient fortitude , I trust to converse with him as if these events had never happened . But not , ’

11509	11546	11550	11550	he	218	‘ Ladies , good evening . Come , Pinch , it ’s not worth thinking of . I was right and you were wrong . That ’s small matter ; you ’ll be wiser another time . ’
11680	11689	11690	11690	he	8974	‘ I ’ll tell you what , Pinch ! ’

11879	11884	11876	11876	HE	218	’ returned the other . ‘

12022	12029	12018	12018	I	0	’ said Pinch , sighing again , ‘

12059	12065	12067	12068	his companion	8974	‘ You a great eater ! ’
12077	12085	12067	12068	his companion	8974	‘ How do you know you are ? ’
12122	12131	12132	12132	he	221	‘ Besides , whether I am or no , ’
12135	12195	12132	12132	he	221	‘ that has little or nothing to do with his thinking me ungrateful . John , there is scarcely a sin in the world that is in my eyes such a crying one as ingratitude ; and when he taxes me with that , and believes me to be guilty of it , he makes me miserable and wretched . ’
12196	12206	12208	12209	the other	934	‘ Do you think he do n’t know that ? ’
12212	12263	12132	12132	he	221	‘ But come , Pinch , before I say anything more to you , just run over the reasons you have for being grateful to him at all , will you ? Change hands first , for the box is heavy . That ’ll do . Now , go on . ’
12264	12270	12272	12272	Pinch	221	‘ In the first place , ’
12274	12288	12272	12272	Pinch	221	‘ he took me as his pupil for much less than he asked . ’
12289	12292	12294	12295	his friend	9006	‘ Well , ’
12305	12312	12294	12295	his friend	9006	‘ What in the second place ? ’
12313	12320	12322	12322	Pinch	221	‘ What in the second place ? ’
12330	12486	12322	12322	Pinch	221	‘ why , everything in the second place . My poor old grandmother died happy to think that she had put me with such an excellent man . I have grown up in his house , I am in his confidence , I am his assistant , he allows me a salary ; when his business improves , my prospects are to improve too . All this , and a great deal more , is in the second place . And in the very prologue and preface to the first place , John , you must consider this , which nobody knows better than I : that I was born for much plainer and poorer things , that I am not a good hand for his kind of business , and have no talent for it , or indeed for anything else but odds and ends that are of no use or service to anybody . ’
12553	12567	12568	12568	he	958	‘ I believe you are one of the best fellows in the world , ’
12571	12575	12568	12568	he	958	‘ Tom Pinch . ’
12576	12581	12583	12583	Tom	249	‘ Not at all , ’
12585	12611	12583	12583	Tom	249	‘ If you only knew Pecksniff as well as I do , you might say it of him , indeed , and say it truly . ’
12612	12623	12625	12626	the other	934	‘ I ’ll say anything of him , you like , ’
12628	12637	12625	12626	the other	934	‘ and not another word to his disparagement . ’
12638	12654	12656	12656	Pinch	249	‘ It ’s for my sake , then ; not his , I am afraid , ’
12663	12713	12656	12656	Pinch	249	‘ For whose you please , Tom , so that it does please you . Oh ! He ’s a famous fellow ! HE never scraped and clawed into his pouch all your poor grandmother ’s hard savings -- she was a housekeeper , was n’t she , Tom ? ’
12714	12717	12719	12720	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Yes , ’
12734	12740	12731	12731	his	249	‘ a gentleman ’s housekeeper . ’
12741	12816	12719	12720	Mr Pinch	221	‘ HE never scraped and clawed into his pouch all her hard savings ; dazzling her with prospects of your happiness and advancement , which he knew ( and no man better ) never would be realised ! HE never speculated and traded on her pride in you , and her having educated you , and on her desire that you at least should live to be a gentleman . Not he , Tom ! ’
12817	12820	12822	12822	Tom	249	‘ No , ’
12842	12847	12833	12833	he	249	‘ Of course not . ’

12858	12995	12855	12856	the youth	938	‘ of course he never did . HE did n’t take less than he had asked , because that less was all she had , and more than he expected ; not he , Tom ! He does n’t keep you as his assistant because you are of any use to him ; because your wonderful faith in his pretensions is of inestimable service in all his mean disputes ; because your honesty reflects honesty on him ; because your wandering about this little place all your spare hours , reading in ancient books and foreign tongues , gets noised abroad , even as far as Salisbury , making of him , Pecksniff the master , a man of learning and of vast importance . HE gets no credit from you , Tom , not he . ’
12996	13005	13007	13007	Pinch	249	‘ Why , of course he do n’t , ’
13021	13030	12855	12856	the youth	938	‘ Pecksniff get credit from me ! Well ! ’
13031	13041	13043	13044	the other	934	‘ Do n’t I say that it ’s ridiculous , ’
13046	13055	13043	13044	the other	934	‘ even to think of such a thing ? ’
13056	13063	13065	13065	Tom	249	‘ Why , it ’s madness , ’
13067	13070	13065	13065	Tom	249	‘ Madness ! ’
13075	13266	13274	13274	he	967	‘ Certainly it ’s madness . Who but a madman would suppose he cares to hear it said on Sundays , that the volunteer who plays the organ in the church , and practises on summer evenings in the dark , is Mr Pecksniff ’s young man , eh , Tom ? Who but a madman would suppose it is the game of such a man as he , to have his name in everybody ’s mouth , connected with the thousand useless odds and ends you do ( and which , of course , he taught you ) , eh , Tom ? Who but a madman would suppose you advertised him hereabouts , much cheaper and much better than a chalker on the walls could , eh , Tom ? As well might one suppose that he does n’t on all occasions pour out his whole heart and soul to you ; that he does n’t make you a very liberal and indeed rather an extravagant allowance ; or , to be more wild and monstrous still , if that be possible , as well might one suppose , ’
13282	13329	13274	13274	he	967	‘ that Pecksniff traded in your nature , and that your nature was to be timid and distrustful of yourself , and trustful of all other men , but most of all , of him who least deserves it . There would be madness , Tom ! ’
13484	13500	13506	13506	Pinch	249	‘ Both hands , Tom . I shall write to you from London , mind ! ’
13501	13504	13506	13506	Pinch	249	‘ Yes , ’

Off went the mail at a canter down the dark road ; the lamps gleaming brightly , and the horn awakening all the echoes , far and wide . ‘
13609	13617	13606	13606	your	221	’ said Pinch , apostrophizing the coach ; ‘

13708	13905	13700	13700	he	973	’ CHAPTER THREE IN WHICH CERTAIN OTHER PERSONS ARE INTRODUCED ; ON THE SAME TERMS AS IN THE LAST CHAPTER Mention has been already made more than once , of a certain Dragon who swung and creaked complainingly before the village alehouse door . A faded , and an ancient dragon he was ; and many a wintry storm of rain , snow , sleet , and hail , had changed his colour from a gaudy blue to a faint lack - lustre shade of grey . But there he hung ; rearing , in a state of monstrous imbecility , on his hind legs ; waxing , with every month that passed , so much more dim and shapeless , that as you gazed at him on one side of the sign - board it seemed as if he must be gradually melting through it , and coming out upon the other . He was a courteous and considerate dragon , too ; or had been in his distincter days ; for in the midst of his rampant feebleness , he kept one of his forepaws near his nose , as though he would say , ‘
13917	16010	13914	13914	my	0	’ while he held out the other in polite and hospitable entreaty . Indeed it must be conceded to the whole brood of dragons of modern times , that they have made a great advance in civilisation and refinement . They no longer demand a beautiful virgin for breakfast every morning , with as much regularity as any tame single gentleman expects his hot roll , but rest content with the society of idle bachelors and roving married men ; and they are now remarkable rather for holding aloof from the softer sex and discouraging their visits ( especially on Saturday nights ) , than for rudely insisting on their company without any reference to their inclinations , as they are known to have done in days of yore . Nor is this tribute to the reclaimed animals in question so wide a digression into the realms of Natural History as it may , at first sight , appear to be ; for the present business of these pages in with the dragon who had his retreat in Mr Pecksniff ’s neighbourhood , and that courteous animal being already on the carpet , there is nothing in the way of its immediate transaction . For many years , then , he had swung and creaked , and flapped himself about , before the two windows of the best bedroom of that house of entertainment to which he lent his name ; but never in all his swinging , creaking , and flapping , had there been such a stir within its dingy precincts , as on the evening next after that upon which the incidents , detailed in the last chapter occurred ; when there was such a hurrying up and down stairs of feet , such a glancing of lights , such a whispering of voices , such a smoking and sputtering of wood newly lighted in a damp chimney , such an airing of linen , such a scorching smell of hot warming - pans , such a domestic bustle and to - do , in short , as never dragon , griffin , unicorn , or other animal of that species presided over , since they first began to interest themselves in household affairs . An old gentleman and a young lady , travelling , unattended , in a rusty old chariot with post - horses ; coming nobody knew whence and going nobody knew whither ; had turned out of the high road , and driven unexpectedly to the Blue Dragon ; and here was the old gentleman , who had taken this step by reason of his sudden illness in the carriage , suffering the most horrible cramps and spasms , yet protesting and vowing in the very midst of his pain , that he would n’t have a doctor sent for , and would n’t take any remedies but those which the young lady administered from a small medicine - chest , and would n’t , in a word , do anything but terrify the landlady out of her five wits , and obstinately refuse compliance with every suggestion that was made to him . Of all the five hundred proposals for his relief which the good woman poured out in less than half an hour , he would entertain but one . That was that he should go to bed . And it was in the preparation of his bed and the arrangement of his chamber , that all the stir was made in the room behind the Dragon . He was , beyond all question , very ill , and suffered exceedingly ; not the less , perhaps , because he was a strong and vigorous old man , with a will of iron , and a voice of brass . But neither the apprehensions which he plainly entertained , at times , for his life , nor the great pain he underwent , influenced his resolution in the least degree . He would have no person sent for . The worse he grew , the more rigid and inflexible he became in his determination . If they sent for any person to attend him , man , woman , or child , he would leave the house directly ( so he told them ) , though he quitted it on foot , and died upon the threshold of the door . Now , there being no medical practitioner actually resident in the village , but a poor apothecary who was also a grocer and general dealer , the landlady had , upon her own responsibility , sent for him , in the very first burst and outset of the disaster . Of course it followed , as a necessary result of his being wanted , that he was not at home . He had gone some miles away , and was not expected home until late at night ; so the landlady , being by this time pretty well beside herself , dispatched the same messenger in all haste for Mr Pecksniff , as a learned man who could bear a deal of responsibility , and a moral man who could administer a world of comfort to a troubled mind . That her guest had need of some efficient services under the latter head was obvious enough from the restless expressions , importing , however , rather a worldly than a spiritual anxiety , to which he gave frequent utterance . From this last - mentioned secret errand , the messenger returned with no better news than from the first ; Mr Pecksniff was not at home . However , they got the patient into bed without him ; and in the course of two hours , he gradually became so far better that there were much longer intervals than at first between his terms of suffering . By degrees , he ceased to suffer at all ; though his exhaustion was occasionally so great that it suggested hardly less alarm than his actual endurance had done . It was in one of his intervals of repose , when , looking round with great caution , and reaching uneasily out of his nest of pillows , he endeavoured , with a strange air of secrecy and distrust , to make use of the writing materials which he had ordered to be placed on a table beside him , that the young lady and the mistress of the Blue Dragon found themselves sitting side by side before the fire in the sick chamber . The mistress of the Blue Dragon was in outward appearance just what a landlady should be : broad , buxom , comfortable , and good looking , with a face of clear red and white , which , by its jovial aspect , at once bore testimony to her hearty participation in the good things of the larder and cellar , and to their thriving and healthful influences . She was a widow , but years ago had passed through her state of weeds , and burst into flower again ; and in full bloom she had continued ever since ; and in full bloom she was now ; with roses on her ample skirts , and roses on her bodice , roses in her cap , roses in her cheeks,--aye , and roses , worth the gathering too , on her lips , for that matter . She had still a bright black eye , and jet black hair ; was comely , dimpled , plump , and tight as a gooseberry ; and though she was not exactly what the world calls young , you may make an affidavit , on trust , before any mayor or magistrate in Christendom , that there are a great many young ladies in the world ( blessings on them one and all ! ) whom you would n’t like half as well , or admire half as much , as the beaming hostess of the Blue Dragon . As this fair matron sat beside the fire , she glanced occasionally with all the pride of ownership , about the room ; which was a large apartment , such as one may see in country places , with a low roof and a sunken flooring , all downhill from the door , and a descent of two steps on the inside so exquisitely unexpected , that strangers , despite the most elaborate cautioning , usually dived in head first , as into a plunging - bath . It was none of your frivolous and preposterously bright bedrooms , where nobody can close an eye with any kind of propriety or decent regard to the association of ideas ; but it was a good , dull , leaden , drowsy place , where every article of furniture reminded you that you came there to sleep , and that you were expected to go to sleep . There was no wakeful reflection of the fire there , as in your modern chambers , which upon the darkest nights have a watchful consciousness of French polish ; the old Spanish mahogany winked at it now and then , as a dozing cat or dog might , nothing more . The very size and shape , and hopeless immovability of the bedstead , and wardrobe , and in a minor degree of even the chairs and tables , provoked sleep ; they were plainly apoplectic and disposed to snore . There were no staring portraits to remonstrate with you for being lazy ; no round - eyed birds upon the curtains , disgustingly wide awake , and insufferably prying . The thick neutral hangings , and the dark blinds , and the heavy heap of bed - clothes , were all designed to hold in sleep , and act as nonconductors to the day and getting up . Even the old stuffed fox upon the top of the wardrobe was devoid of any spark of vigilance , for his glass eye had fallen out , and he slumbered as he stood . The wandering attention of the mistress of the Blue Dragon roved to these things but twice or thrice , and then for but an instant at a time . It soon deserted them , and even the distant bed with its strange burden , for the young creature immediately before her , who , with her downcast eyes intently fixed upon the fire , sat wrapped in silent meditation . She was very young ; apparently no more than seventeen ; timid and shrinking in her manner , and yet with a greater share of self possession and control over her emotions than usually belongs to a far more advanced period of female life . This she had abundantly shown , but now , in her tending of the sick gentleman . She was short in stature ; and her figure was slight , as became her years ; but all the charms of youth and maidenhood set it off , and clustered on her gentle brow . Her face was very pale , in part no doubt from recent agitation . Her dark brown hair , disordered from the same cause , had fallen negligently from its bonds , and hung upon her neck ; for which instance of its waywardness no male observer would have had the heart to blame it . Her attire was that of a lady , but extremely plain ; and in her manner , even when she sat as still as she did then , there was an indefinable something which appeared to be in kindred with her scrupulously unpretending dress . She had sat , at first looking anxiously towards the bed ; but seeing that the patient remained quiet , and was busy with his writing , she had softly moved her chair into its present place ; partly , as it seemed , from an instinctive consciousness that he desired to avoid observation ; and partly that she might , unseen by him , give some vent to the natural feelings she had hitherto suppressed . Of all this , and much more , the rosy landlady of the Blue Dragon took as accurate note and observation as only woman can take of woman . And at length she said , in a voice too low , she knew , to reach the bed : ‘
16030	16031	16024	16024	he	977	’ ‘
16050	16051	16053	16054	a Providence	979	’ ‘
16056	16064	16053	16054	a Providence	979	’ said the landlady of the Dragon , ‘
16078	16079	16066	16066	you	976	’ ‘
16094	16095	16088	16088	We	981	’ ‘
16098	16103	16088	16088	We	981	’ thought the hostess , ‘
16118	16152	16153	16154	The gentleman	977	’ She was so conscious of expressing this in her face , that meeting the young lady ’s eyes immediately afterwards , and being a very honest hostess , she was rather confused . ‘
16165	16182	16153	16154	The gentleman	977	‘ being so bent on having no assistance , must terrify you very much , miss ? ’
16183	16202	16153	16154	The gentleman	977	‘ I have been very much alarmed to - night . He -- he is not my grandfather . ’
16203	16211	16213	16214	the hostess	9135	‘ Father , I should have said , ’
16224	16228	16230	16232	the young lady	8949	‘ Nor my father ’
16234	16237	16238	16238	she	8949	‘ Nor , ’
16256	16266	16238	16238	she	8949	‘ Nor my uncle . We are not related . ’
16267	16272	16274	16275	the landlady	9069	‘ Oh dear me ! ’
16283	16333	16274	16275	the landlady	9069	‘ how could I be so very much mistaken ; knowing , as anybody in their proper senses might that when a gentleman is ill , he looks so much older than he really is ? That I should have called you “ Miss , ” too , ma’am ! ’
16369	16379	16381	16383	the other mildly	990	‘ When I told you we were not related , ’
16394	16414	16381	16383	the other mildly	990	‘ I meant not in any way . Not even by marriage . Did you call me , Martin ? ’
16415	16419	16421	16423	the old man	991	‘ Call you ? ’
16444	16447	16448	16448	She	8949	‘ No . ’
16468	16471	16472	16472	he	991	‘ No , ’
16480	16500	16472	16472	he	991	‘ Why do you ask me ? If I had called you , what need for such a question ? ’
16501	16517	16519	16520	the landlady	9069	‘ It was the creaking of the sign outside , sir , I dare say , ’
16552	16559	16560	16560	he	991	‘ No matter what , ma’am , ’
16563	16585	16560	16560	he	991	‘ it was n’t I. Why how you stand there , Mary , as if I had the plague ! But they ’re
16591	16602	16604	16604	she	9069	’ he added , leaning helplessly backward on his pillow ; ‘
16621	16622	16560	16560	he	991	’ ‘
16632	16635	16637	16641	the good - tempered landlady	994	’m sure , ’
16650	16664	16637	16641	the good - tempered landlady	994	‘ Be of better cheer , sir . These are only sick fancies . ’
16665	16672	16673	16673	he	991	‘ What are only sick fancies ? ’
16676	16696	16673	16673	he	991	‘ What do you know about fancies ? Who told you about fancies ? The old story ! Fancies ! ’
16697	16709	16711	16716	the mistress of the Blue Dragon	9099	‘ Only see again there , how you take one up ! ’
16723	16762	16711	16716	the mistress of the Blue Dragon	9099	‘ Dear heart alive , there is no harm in the word , sir , if it is an old one . Folks in good health have their fancies , too , and strange ones , every day . ’
16847	16855	16856	16856	he	991	‘ Ah ! you begin too soon , ’
16877	16903	16856	16856	he	991	‘ But you lose no time . You do your errand , and you earn your fee . Now , who may be your client ? ’
16980	16983	16984	16984	he	991	‘ Come , ’
16987	17011	16984	16984	he	991	‘ tell me who is it ? Being here , it is not very hard for me to guess , you may suppose . ’
17012	17015	17017	17019	the young lady	8949	‘ Martin , ’
17028	17050	17022	17022	her	8949	‘ reflect how short a time we have been in this house , and that even your name is unknown here . ’
17051	17054	17055	17055	he	991	‘ Unless , ’
17058	17060	17055	17055	he	991	‘ you-- ’
17114	17117	17119	17120	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ There ! ’
17141	17167	17119	17120	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ Now , you will be well again , sir . You forgot , for the moment , that there were none but friends here . ’
17168	17171	17173	17175	the old man	991	‘ Oh ! ’
17190	17218	17181	17181	he	991	‘ why do you talk to me of friends ! Can you or anybody teach me to know who are my friends , and who my enemies ? ’
17219	17223	17225	17226	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ At least , ’
17230	17242	17225	17226	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ this young lady is your friend , I am sure . ’
17243	17252	17254	17256	the old man	991	‘ She has no temptation to be otherwise , ’
17268	17292	17254	17256	the old man	991	‘ I suppose she is . Heaven knows . There , let me try to sleep . Leave the candle where it is . ’
17580	17587	17555	17556	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Good evening , Mrs Lupin ! ’
17588	17595	17596	17596	she	255	‘ Oh dear me , sir ! ’
17604	17614	17596	17596	she	255	‘ I am so very glad you have come . ’
17615	17625	17627	17628	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ And I am very glad I have come , ’
17630	17654	17627	17628	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ if I can be of service . I am very glad I have come . What is the matter , Mrs Lupin ? ’
17655	17673	17675	17677	the tearful hostess	1010	‘ A gentleman taken ill upon the road , has been so very bad upstairs , sir , ’
17679	17698	17700	17701	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ A gentleman taken ill upon the road , has been so very bad upstairs , has he ? ’
17703	17708	17700	17701	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Well , well ! ’
17810	17828	17806	17806	he	218	‘ a verb must agree with its nominative case in number and person , my good friend , ’
17830	17843	17806	17806	he	218	‘ eight times eight are sixty - four , my worthy soul , ’
17857	17861	17863	17864	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ And how , ’
17891	17898	17863	17864	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ and how is he now ? ’
17899	17908	17910	17911	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ He is better , and quite tranquil , ’
17913	17922	17924	17925	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ He is better , and quite tranquil , ’
17927	17936	17924	17925	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Very well ! Ve - ry well ! ’
17987	17991	17992	17992	he	218	‘ I observe , ’
17997	18015	17992	17992	he	218	‘ and through me , morality in general remarks , that he is better and quite tranquil . ’
18016	18028	18030	18031	the hostess	9135	‘ There must be weighty matters on his mind , though , ’
18037	18076	18034	18034	her	9135	‘ for he talks , sir , in the strangest way you ever heard . He is far from easy in his thoughts , and wants some proper advice from those whose goodness makes it worth his having . ’
18077	18080	18082	18083	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Then , ’
18085	18095	18082	18083	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ he is the sort of customer for me . ’
18124	18131	18133	18134	the landlady	9069	‘ I am afraid , sir , ’
18157	18189	18133	18134	the landlady	9069	‘ I am very much afraid , sir , that his conscience is troubled by his not being related to -- or -- or even married to -- a very young lady-- ’
18190	18194	18196	18197	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Mrs Lupin ! ’
18229	18235	18206	18206	his	218	‘ Person ! young person ? ’
18236	18242	18244	18245	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ A very young person , ’
18251	18284	18244	18245	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ --I beg your pardon , sir , but I have been so hurried to - night , that I do n’t know what I say -- who is with him now . ’
18285	18292	18302	18302	he	218	‘ Who is with him now , ’
18344	18352	18302	18302	he	218	‘ Oh dear me , dear me ! ’
18353	18373	18375	18376	the hostess	9135	‘ At the same time I am bound to say , and I do say with all my heart , ’
18380	18390	18375	18376	the hostess	9135	‘ that her looks and manner almost disarm suspicion . ’
18391	18398	18400	18401	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Your suspicion , Mrs Lupin , ’
18404	18409	18400	18401	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ is very natural . ’
18460	18467	18468	18468	he	1025	‘ Your suspicion , Mrs Lupin , ’
18471	18490	18468	18468	he	1025	‘ is very natural , and I have no doubt correct . I will wait upon these travellers . ’
18532	18537	18539	18540	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ Shall I knock ? ’
18549	18552	18554	18555	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ No , ’
18557	18563	18554	18555	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ enter if you please . ’
18602	18607	18609	18610	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I am afraid , ’
18625	18651	18619	18619	his	1025	‘ I am afraid that this looks artful . I am afraid , Mrs Lupin , do you know , that this looks very artful ! ’
18700	18705	18706	18706	he	218	‘ Yes , ma’am , ’
18709	18735	18706	18706	he	218	‘ it is a good book . I was fearful of that beforehand . I am apprehensive that this is a very deep thing indeed ! ’
18736	18742	18747	18747	his	218	‘ What gentleman is this ? ’
18751	18761	18763	18764	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Hush ! do n’t trouble yourself , ma’am , ’
18774	18796	18763	18764	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ This young’--in spite of himself he hesitated when “ person ” rose to his lips , and substituted another word : ‘
18860	19170	19171	19171	You	1038	’ With these impressive words , Mr Pecksniff passed over to the bedside , where , after patting the counterpane once or twice in a very solemn manner , as if by that means he gained a clear insight into the patient ’s disorder , he took his seat in a large arm - chair , and in an attitude of some thoughtfulness and much comfort , waited for his waking . Whatever objection the young lady urged to Mrs Lupin went no further , for nothing more was said to Mr Pecksniff , and Mr Pecksniff said nothing more to anybody else . Full half an hour elapsed before the old man stirred , but at length he turned himself in bed , and , though not yet awake , gave tokens that his sleep was drawing to an end . By little and little he removed the bed - clothes from about his head , and turned still more towards the side where Mr Pecksniff sat . In course of time his eyes opened ; and he lay for a few moments as people newly roused sometimes will , gazing indolently at his visitor , without any distinct consciousness of his presence . There was nothing remarkable in these proceedings , except the influence they worked on Mr Pecksniff , which could hardly have been surpassed by the most marvellous of natural phenomena . Gradually his hands became tightly clasped upon the elbows of the chair , his eyes dilated with surprise , his mouth opened , his hair stood more erect upon his forehead than its custom was , until , at length , when the old man rose in bed , and stared at him with scarcely less emotion than he showed himself , the Pecksniff doubts were all resolved , and he exclaimed aloud : ‘
19176	19209	19171	19171	You	1038	’ His consternation of surprise was so genuine , that the old man , with all the disposition that he clearly entertained to believe it assumed , was convinced of its reality . ‘
19215	19221	19212	19213	Martin Chuzzlewit	221	’ he said , bitterly : ‘
19251	19265	19248	19249	this fellow	1039	’ he said , lying down again , and turning away his face , ‘
19275	19276	19270	19270	he	1039	’ ‘
19280	19285	19288	19288	His	1039	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘
19293	19316	19288	19288	His	1039	’ cried the old man , shaking his grey head to and fro upon the pillow , and throwing up his hands . ‘
19377	19378	19385	19386	Mr Chuzzlewit	237	’ ‘
19388	19428	19385	19386	Mr Chuzzlewit	237	’ said Pecksniff , in a tone that was at once in the sublimest degree compassionate and dispassionate ; for he had by this time recovered from his surprise , and was in full possession of his virtuous self . ‘
19440	19441	19442	19442	You	237	’ ‘
19445	19451	19442	19442	You	237	’ said Martin , contemptuously . ‘
19454	19459	19442	19442	You	237	’ retorted Mr Pecksniff . ‘
19554	19555	19538	19539	Mr Chuzzlewit	237	’ ‘
19561	19567	19538	19539	Mr Chuzzlewit	237	’ muttered the old man . ‘
19573	19585	19538	19539	Mr Chuzzlewit	237	’ said Mr Pecksniff , watchful of the effect he made , ‘
19652	19706	19642	19642	I	0	’ Martin made not any verbal answer ; but he as clearly implied though only by a motion of his legs beneath the bed - clothes , that there was reason in this , and that he could not dispute it , as if he had said as much in good set terms . ‘
19709	19741	19642	19642	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , keeping his hand in his waistcoat as though he were ready , on the shortest notice , to produce his heart for Martin Chuzzlewit ’s inspection , ‘
19833	19938	19828	19828	you	237	’ Having said which , Mr Pecksniff threw himself back in the easy - chair ; so radiant with ingenuous honesty , that Mrs Lupin almost wondered not to see a stained - glass Glory , such as the Saint wore in the church , shining about his head . A long pause succeeded . The old man , with increased restlessness , changed his posture several times . Mrs Lupin and the young lady gazed in silence at the counterpane . Mr Pecksniff toyed abstractedly with his eye - glass , and kept his eyes shut , that he might ruminate the better . ‘
19941	19957	19828	19828	you	237	’ he said at last , opening them suddenly , and looking towards the bed . ‘
19971	19977	19968	19969	Mrs Lupin	255	’ he continued , slowly rising ‘
20012	20051	20053	20053	you	237	’ This last note of interrogation bore reference to another change of posture on the old man ’s part , which brought his face towards Mr Pecksniff for the first time since he had turned away from him . ‘
20065	20074	20075	20075	you	237	’ continued that gentleman , after another pause , ‘
20106	20288	20092	20092	you	237	’ Now if Mr Pecksniff knew , from anything Martin Chuzzlewit had expressed in gestures , that he wanted to speak to him , he could only have found it out on some such principle as prevails in melodramas , and in virtue of which the elderly farmer with the comic son always knows what the dumb girl means when she takes refuge in his garden , and relates her personal memoirs in incomprehensible pantomime . But without stopping to make any inquiry on this point , Martin Chuzzlewit signed to his young companion to withdraw , which she immediately did , along with the landlady leaving him and Mr Pecksniff alone together . For some time they looked at each other in silence ; or rather the old man looked at Mr Pecksniff , and Mr Pecksniff again closing his eyes on all outward objects , took an inward survey of his own breast . That it amply repaid him for his trouble , and afforded a delicious and enchanting prospect , was clear from the expression of his face . ‘
20302	20308	20310	20310	you	1053	’ said the old man , ‘
20312	20352	20310	20310	you	1053	’ Mr Pecksniff replied , by a shrug of his shoulders and an apparent turning round of his eyes in their sockets before he opened them , that he was still reduced to the necessity of entertaining that desire . ‘
20358	20362	20353	20353	You	1053	’ said Martin . ‘
20440	20510	20415	20415	I	0	’ It would be no description of Mr Pecksniff ’s gentleness of manner to adopt the common parlance , and say that he looked at this moment as if butter would n’t melt in his mouth . He rather looked as if any quantity of butter might have been made out of him , by churning the milk of human kindness , as it spouted upwards from his heart . ‘
20524	20530	20531	20531	I	0	’ said the old man , ‘
20602	20636	20637	20637	You	1062	’ A thought arose in Pecksniff ’s mind , which must have instantly mounted to his face , or Martin Chuzzlewit would not have resumed as quickly and as sternly as he did : ‘
20691	20705	20688	20689	kind stranger	1064	’ said the old man , whose every feature darkened as he spoke , ‘
20833	20834	20815	20815	you	1062	’ ‘
20842	20847	20815	20815	you	1062	’ echoed Mr Pecksniff . ‘
20850	20856	20815	20815	you	1062	’ returned the old man , ‘
20940	20950	20951	20951	You	864	’ Mr Pecksniff shook his head , and said , ‘
20955	20956	20951	20951	You	864	’ ‘
20960	20966	20967	20967	I	0	’ cried the old man , ‘
20998	21006	20992	20992	I	0	’ he added , with increasing bitterness , ‘
21141	21153	21184	21184	parent	1086	’ and here he looked closely in his cousin ’s eyes , ‘
21318	21391	21311	21311	they	1089	’ Mr Pecksniff , not at all knowing what it might be best to say in the momentary pause which ensued upon these remarks , made an elaborate demonstration of intending to deliver something very oracular indeed ; trusting to the certainty of the old man interrupting him , before he should utter a word . Nor was he mistaken , for Martin Chuzzlewit having taken breath , went on to say : ‘
21564	21565	21562	21562	you	0	’ ‘
21572	21589	21562	21562	you	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , laying his hand upon his breast , and dropping his eyelids . ‘
21593	21625	21590	21590	I	0	’ cried the old man , looking at him with a keenness which the other seemed to feel , although he did not raise his eyes so as to see it . ‘
21869	21901	21902	21903	Mr Chuzzlewit	237	’ With these words , the old man fell slowly back upon his pillow . Mr Pecksniff as slowly rose , and , with a prefatory hem , began as follows : ‘
21905	21906	21902	21903	Mr Chuzzlewit	237	’ ‘
21911	21916	21902	21903	Mr Chuzzlewit	237	’ interposed the other . ‘
21927	21928	21921	21921	I	0	’ ‘
21937	21942	21929	21929	I	0	’ rejoined Mr Pecksniff , ‘
21972	22052	21967	21967	I	0	’ It is a lamentable fact , that as Mr Pecksniff stood erect beside the bed , in all the dignity of Goodness , and addressed him thus , the old man cast an angry glance towards the candlestick , as if he were possessed by a strong inclination to launch it at his cousin ’s head . But he constrained himself , and pointing with his finger to the door , informed him that his road lay there . ‘
22056	22061	22054	22054	you	864	’ said Mr Pecksniff ; ‘
22150	22178	22145	22145	I	0	’ continued Mr Pecksniff , drawing out his pocket - handkerchief , and winking with both eyes at once , as it were , against his will , ‘
22262	22273	22254	22254	We	1111	’ added Mr Pecksniff , with great tenderness of manner , ‘
22305	22340	22343	22344	Mr Chuzzlewit	237	’ Here he paused for an instant , and concealed his face behind his pocket - handkerchief . Then , smiling faintly , and holding the bed furniture with one hand , he resumed : ‘
22419	22460	22461	22461	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , towering on tiptoe among the curtains , as if he were literally rising above all worldly considerations , and were fain to hold on tight , to keep himself from darting skyward like a rocket , ‘
22502	22511	22500	22500	sir	864	’ repeated Mr Pecksniff , shaking his head . ‘
22547	22561	22544	22544	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , glancing at the pen - and - ink , ‘
22595	22673	22586	22586	you	864	’ So saying , Mr Pecksniff waved his right hand with much solemnity , and once more inserting it in his waistcoat , departed . There was emotion in his manner , but his step was firm . Subject to human weaknesses , he was upheld by conscience . Martin lay for some time , with an expression on his face of silent wonder , not unmixed with rage ; at length he muttered in a whisper : ‘
22743	22787	22734	22734	self	1122	’ He fell to trifling , as he ceased to speak , with the ashes of the burnt paper in the candlestick . He did so , at first , in pure abstraction , but they presently became the subject of his thoughts . ‘
22794	22798	22734	22734	self	1122	’ he said , ‘
22831	22841	22815	22815	I	0	’ he cried , almost writhing in the bed ; ‘
22932	23496	22919	22919	self	1122	’ Universal self ! Was there nothing of its shadow in these reflections , and in the history of Martin Chuzzlewit , on his own showing ? CHAPTER FOUR FROM WHICH IT WILL APPEAR THAT IF UNION BE STRENGTH , AND FAMILY AFFECTION BE PLEASANT TO CONTEMPLATE , THE CHUZZLEWITS WERE THE STRONGEST AND MOST AGREEABLE FAMILY IN THE WORLD That worthy man Mr Pecksniff having taken leave of his cousin in the solemn terms recited in the last chapter , withdrew to his own home , and remained there three whole days ; not so much as going out for a walk beyond the boundaries of his own garden , lest he should be hastily summoned to the bedside of his penitent and remorseful relative , whom , in his ample benevolence , he had made up his mind to forgive unconditionally , and to love on any terms . But such was the obstinacy and such the bitter nature of that stern old man , that no repentant summons came ; and the fourth day found Mr Pecksniff apparently much farther from his Christian object than the first . During the whole of this interval , he haunted the Dragon at all times and seasons in the day and night , and , returning good for evil evinced the deepest solicitude in the progress of the obdurate invalid , in so much that Mrs Lupin was fairly melted by his disinterested anxiety ( for he often particularly required her to take notice that he would do the same by any stranger or pauper in the like condition ) , and shed many tears of admiration and delight . Meantime , old Martin Chuzzlewit remained shut up in his own chamber , and saw no person but his young companion , saving the hostess of the Blue Dragon , who was , at certain times , admitted to his presence . So surely as she came into the room , however , Martin feigned to fall asleep . It was only when he and the young lady were alone , that he would utter a word , even in answer to the simplest inquiry ; though Mr Pecksniff could make out , by hard listening at the door , that they two being left together , he was talkative enough . It happened on the fourth evening , that Mr Pecksniff walking , as usual , into the bar of the Dragon and finding no Mrs Lupin there , went straight upstairs ; purposing , in the fervour of his affectionate zeal , to apply his ear once more to the keyhole , and quiet his mind by assuring himself that the hard - hearted patient was going on well . It happened that Mr Pecksniff , coming softly upon the dark passage into which a spiral ray of light usually darted through the same keyhole , was astonished to find no such ray visible ; and it happened that Mr Pecksniff , when he had felt his way to the chamber - door , stooping hurriedly down to ascertain by personal inspection whether the jealousy of the old man had caused this keyhole to be stopped on the inside , brought his head into such violent contact with another head that he could not help uttering in an audible voice the monosyllable ‘
23499	23920	22919	22919	self	1122	’ which was , as it were , sharply unscrewed and jerked out of him by very anguish . It happened then , and lastly , that Mr Pecksniff found himself immediately collared by something which smelt like several damp umbrellas , a barrel of beer , a cask of warm brandy - and - water , and a small parlour - full of stale tobacco smoke , mixed ; and was straightway led downstairs into the bar from which he had lately come , where he found himself standing opposite to , and in the grasp of , a perfectly strange gentleman of still stranger appearance who , with his disengaged hand , rubbed his own head very hard , and looked at him , Pecksniff , with an evil countenance . The gentleman was of that order of appearance which is currently termed shabby - genteel , though in respect of his dress he can hardly be said to have been in any extremities , as his fingers were a long way out of his gloves , and the soles of his feet were at an inconvenient distance from the upper leather of his boots . His nether garments were of a bluish grey -- violent in its colours once , but sobered now by age and dinginess -- and were so stretched and strained in a tough conflict between his braces and his straps , that they appeared every moment in danger of flying asunder at the knees . His coat , in colour blue and of a military cut , was buttoned and frogged up to his chin . His cravat was , in hue and pattern , like one of those mantles which hairdressers are accustomed to wrap about their clients , during the progress of the professional mysteries . His hat had arrived at such a pass that it would have been hard to determine whether it was originally white or black . But he wore a moustache -- a shaggy moustache too ; nothing in the meek and merciful way , but quite in the fierce and scornful style ; the regular Satanic sort of thing -- and he wore , besides , a vast quantity of unbrushed hair . He was very dirty and very jaunty ; very bold and very mean ; very swaggering and very slinking ; very much like a man who might have been something better , and unspeakably like a man who deserved to be something worse . ‘
23933	23962	23921	23921	You	1127	’ said this gentleman . Mr Pecksniff cast him off , as Saint George might have repudiated the Dragon in that animal ’s last moments , and said : ‘
23985	23986	23972	23974	the good woman	9070	’ ‘
23989	23994	23972	23974	the good woman	9070	’ said the gentleman . ‘
24006	24007	23999	23999	She	9070	’ ‘
24013	24018	24011	24011	sir	864	’ cried Mr Pecksniff . ‘
24050	24051	24041	24041	I	0	’ ‘
24058	24063	24041	24041	I	0	’ interposed the stranger , ‘
24076	24077	24070	24070	he	1134	’ ‘
24083	24092	24080	24080	you	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , with indignant surprise . ‘
24101	24102	24095	24095	you	0	’ ‘
24107	24112	24095	24095	you	0	’ cried the other , ‘
24127	24128	24116	24117	a cousin	1141	’ ‘
24139	24146	24129	24129	I	0	’ replied the man of worth . ‘
24152	24157	24150	24150	Pecksniff	218	’ said the gentleman . ‘
24161	24162	24150	24150	Pecksniff	218	’ ‘
24176	24209	24210	24210	You	0	’ said the gentleman , touching his hat , and subsequently diving behind his cravat for a shirt - collar , which however he did not succeed in bringing to the surface . ‘
24232	24313	24345	24346	Chevy Slyme	257	’ As he said this , he touched the tip of his high nose , by way of intimation that he would let Mr Pecksniff into a secret presently ; and pulling off his hat , began to search inside the crown among a mass of crumpled documents and small pieces of what may be called the bark of broken cigars ; whence he presently selected the cover of an old letter , begrimed with dirt and redolent of tobacco . ‘
24317	24327	24345	24346	Chevy Slyme	257	’ he cried , giving it to Mr Pecksniff . ‘
24337	24342	24332	24333	Chevy Slyme	257	’ said that gentleman . ‘
24353	24368	24350	24350	I	0	’ returned the stranger . Mr Pecksniff shrugged his shoulders as though he would say ‘
24384	24385	24373	24375	such a person	1150	’ ‘
24389	24394	24373	24375	such a person	1150	’ remarked the gentleman . ‘
24403	24421	24373	24375	such a person	1150	’ With that he made another dive for his shirt - collar and brought up a string . ‘
24432	24444	24429	24430	my friend	1151	’ said Mr Pecksniff , shaking his head and smiling composedly . ‘
24495	24496	24470	24471	Mr Slyme	257	’ ‘
24498	24526	24470	24471	Mr Slyme	257	’ cried the gentleman , stretching forth his right arm , which was so tightly wedged into his threadbare sleeve that it looked like a cloth sausage . ‘
24531	24575	24576	24576	I	0	’ He paused to establish himself immediately in front of the fire with his back towards it . Then gathering the skirts of his coat under his left arm , and smoothing his moustache with his right thumb and forefinger , he resumed : ‘
24734	24735	24730	24730	you	864	’ ‘
24741	24754	24736	24736	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , holding out the cover of the letter . ‘
24760	24765	24736	24736	I	0	’ returned the gentleman . ‘
24833	24861	24822	24822	He	257	’ said the gentleman , shaking his forefinger before his nose , and planting his legs wider apart as he looked attentively in Mr Pecksniff ’s face , ‘
24912	24917	24918	24920	Slyme ’s biographer	1169	’ Mr Pecksniff coughed . ‘
24929	24934	24925	24925	he	257	’ resumed the gentleman , ‘
25048	25049	25002	25002	He	257	’ ‘
25053	25065	25002	25002	He	257	’ asked Mr Pecksniff , obviously not quite at his ease , ‘
25101	25102	25114	25114	you	864	’ ‘
25108	25113	25114	25114	you	864	’ returned the gentleman , ‘
25190	25198	25169	25170	Montague Tigg	262	’ Mr Pecksniff gently shook his head . ‘
25202	25207	25169	25170	Montague Tigg	262	’ said the gentleman . ‘
25249	25337	25238	25238	Slyme	257	’ With this announcement he hurried away to the outer door of the Blue Dragon , and almost immediately returned with a companion shorter than himself , who was wrapped in an old blue camlet cloak with a lining of faded scarlet . His sharp features being much pinched and nipped by long waiting in the cold , and his straggling red whiskers and frowzy hair being more than usually dishevelled from the same cause , he certainly looked rather unwholesome and uncomfortable than Shakspearian or Miltonic . ‘
25340	25368	25238	25238	Slyme	257	’ said Mr Tigg , clapping one hand on the shoulder of his prepossessing friend , and calling Mr Pecksniff ’s attention to him with the other , ‘
25464	25502	25449	25462	devilish deep - thoughted fellows , who may be reasoned with to any extent	1188	’ Here Mr Chevy Slyme , whose great abilities seemed one and all to point towards the sneaking quarter of the moral compass , nudged his friend stealthily with his elbow , and whispered in his ear . ‘
25505	25525	25449	25462	devilish deep - thoughted fellows , who may be reasoned with to any extent	1188	’ said Mr Tigg aloud , in the high tone of one who was not to be tampered with . ‘
25571	25696	25566	25567	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ and seeing at this juncture that the expression of Mr Pecksniff ’s face by no means betokened that he shared this certainty , Mr Tigg laid his finger on his nose again for that gentleman ’s private and especial behoof ; calling upon him thereby to take notice that the requisition of small loans was another instance of the peculiarities of genius as developed in his friend Slyme ; that he , Tigg , winked at the same , because of the strong metaphysical interest which these weaknesses possessed ; and that in reference to his own personal advocacy of such small advances , he merely consulted the humour of his friend , without the least regard to his own advantage or necessities . ‘
25703	25725	25699	25699	Chiv	265	’ added Mr Tigg , surveying his adopted brother with an air of profound contemplation after dismissing this piece of pantomime . ‘
25956	25983	25993	25993	I	0	’ With which consolatory deduction from the gloomy premises recited , Mr Tigg roused himself by a great effort , and proceeded in his former strain . ‘
25994	26039	25993	25993	I	0	’m a most confoundedly soft - hearted kind of fellow in my way , and I can not stand by , and see you two blades cutting each other ’s throats when there ’s nothing to be got by it . Mr Pecksniff , you ’re
26048	26231	25993	25993	I	0	’re the nephew -- I say we , meaning Chiv . Perhaps in all essential points you are more nearly related to him than we are . Very good . If so , so be it . But you ca n’t get at him , neither can we . I give you my brightest word of honour , sir , that I ’ve been looking through that keyhole with short intervals of rest , ever since nine o’clock this morning , in expectation of receiving an answer to one of the most moderate and gentlemanly applications for a little temporary assistance -- only fifteen pounds , and MY security -- that the mind of man can conceive . In the meantime , sir , he is perpetually closeted with , and pouring his whole confidence into the bosom of , a stranger . Now I say decisively with regard to this state of circumstances , that it wo n’t do ; that it wo n’t act ; that it ca n’t be ; and that it must not be suffered to continue . ’
26232	26236	26238	26239	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Every man , ’
26241	26369	26371	26371	Pecksniff	218	‘ has a right , an undoubted right , ( which I , for one , would not call in question for any earthly consideration ; oh no ! ) to regulate his own proceedings by his own likings and dislikings , supposing they are not immoral and not irreligious . I may feel in my own breast , that Mr Chuzzlewit does not regard -- me , for instance ; say me -- with exactly that amount of Christian love which should subsist between us . I may feel grieved and hurt at the circumstance ; still I may not rush to the conclusion that Mr Chuzzlewit is wholly without a justification in all his coldnesses . Heaven forbid ! Besides ; how , Mr Tigg , ’
26383	26428	26378	26378	he	218	‘ how could Mr Chuzzlewit be prevented from having these peculiar and most extraordinary confidences of which you speak ; the existence of which I must admit ; and which I can not but deplore -- for his sake ? Consider , my good sir-- ’
26444	26445	26440	26440	you	218	’ ‘
26452	26456	26431	26432	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ rejoined Tigg , ‘
26464	26465	26431	26432	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ ‘
26473	26507	26431	26432	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ Mr Pecksniff answered . As he spoke he drew himself aloft , and seemed to grow more mindful , suddenly , of the moral gulf between himself and the creature he addressed . ‘
26540	26541	26542	26542	You	218	’ ‘
26555	26560	26552	26552	I	0	’ said Mr Tigg . ‘
26571	26584	26585	26585	Mr	1206	’ asked Pecksniff , stopping abruptly on his way to the door . ‘
26590	26616	26585	26585	Mr	1206	’ said Chevy Slyme , Esquire , speaking aloud for the first time , and speaking very sulkily ; shambling with his legs the while . ‘
26656	26657	26641	26641	she	268	’ ‘
26664	26672	26660	26660	my	0	’ cried Mr Pecksniff , looking upwards . ‘
26686	26687	26696	26696	Tigg	261	’ ‘
26698	26712	26696	26696	Tigg	261	’ said Slyme , looking at that gentleman and speaking at Mr Pecksniff . ‘
26733	26748	26731	26731	I	0	‘ em not five minutes ago , when I was waiting round the corner . ’
26749	26756	26758	26759	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Oh , Mammon , Mammon ! ’
26765	26769	26771	26771	Slyme	257	‘ So there , ’
26778	26790	26771	26771	Slyme	257	‘ are his brother and another nephew for you , already . ’
26791	26800	26802	26803	Mr Tigg	261	‘ This is the whole thing , sir , ’
26805	27047	26802	26803	Mr Tigg	261	‘ this is the point and purpose at which I was gradually arriving when my friend Slyme here , with six words , hit it full . Mr Pecksniff , now that your cousin ( and Chiv ’s uncle ) has turned up , some steps must be taken to prevent his disappearing again ; and , if possible , to counteract the influence which is exercised over him now , by this designing favourite . Everybody who is interested feels it , sir . The whole family is pouring down to this place . The time has come when individual jealousies and interests must be forgotten for a time , sir , and union must be made against the common enemy . When the common enemy is routed , you will all set up for yourselves again ; every lady and gentleman who has a part in the game , will go in on their own account and bowl away , to the best of their ability , at the testator ’s wicket , and nobody will be in a worse position than before . Think of it . Do n’t commit yourself now . You ’ll find us at the Half Moon and Seven Stars in this village , at any time , and open to any reasonable proposition . Hem ! Chiv , my dear fellow , go out and see what sort of a night it is . ’
27101	27109	27110	27110	he	261	‘ We must not be too hard , ’
27113	27129	27110	27110	he	261	‘ upon the little eccentricities of our friend Slyme . You saw him whisper me ? ’
27136	27145	27130	27131	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ You heard my answer , I think ? ’
27152	27158	27160	27161	Mr Tigg	261	‘ Five shillings , eh ? ’
27165	27177	27160	27161	Mr Tigg	261	‘ Ah ! what an extraordinary fellow ! Very moderate too ! ’
27184	27188	27178	27179	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Five shillings ! ’
27195	27215	27190	27191	Mr Tigg	261	‘ and to be punctually repaid next week ; that ’s the best of it . You heard that ? ’
27223	27230	27232	27232	Tigg	261	‘ No ! You surprise me ! ’
27234	27260	27268	27268	you	218	‘ That ’s the cream of the thing sir . I never knew that man fail to redeem a promise , in my life . You ’re
27270	27271	27268	27268	you	218	’ ‘
27274	27279	27281	27281	you	218	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
27287	27288	27281	27281	you	218	’ ‘
27292	27297	27299	27299	you	218	’ returned Mr Tigg . ‘
27311	27340	27303	27303	I	0	’ With that he began to whistle ; but a dozen seconds had not elapsed when he stopped short , and looking earnestly at Mr Pecksniff , said : ‘
27351	27352	27342	27342	you	218	’ ‘
27359	27364	27353	27353	I	0	’ Mr Pecksniff rejoined . ‘
27367	27392	27353	27353	I	0	’ cried Tigg , gravely nodding his head as if some ground of objection occurred to him at that moment for the first time , ‘
27417	27418	27403	27403	you	218	’ ‘
27429	27434	27421	27421	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘
27445	27450	27421	27421	I	0	’ urged Mr Tigg . ‘
27459	27460	27421	27421	I	0	’ ‘
27467	27472	27464	27464	we	1213	’ said Mr Tigg , ‘
27486	27487	27421	27421	I	0	’ ‘
27491	27496	27421	27421	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
27502	28318	28319	28319	I	0	’ On receipt of this assurance , Mr Tigg shook him heartily by both hands , protesting with much earnestness , that he was one of the most consistent and remarkable men he had ever met , and that he desired the honour of his better acquaintance . He moreover observed that there were many little characteristics about his friend Slyme , of which he could by no means , as a man of strict honour , approve ; but that he was prepared to forgive him all these slight drawbacks , and much more , in consideration of the great pleasure he himself had that day enjoyed in his social intercourse with Mr Pecksniff , which had given him a far higher and more enduring delight than the successful negotiation of any small loan on the part of his friend could possibly have imparted . With which remarks he would beg leave , he said , to wish Mr Pecksniff a very good evening . And so he took himself off ; as little abashed by his recent failure as any gentleman would desire to be . The meditations of Mr Pecksniff that evening at the bar of the Dragon , and that night in his own house , were very serious and grave indeed ; the more especially as the intelligence he had received from Messrs Tigg and Slyme touching the arrival of other members of the family , were fully confirmed on more particular inquiry . For the Spottletoes had actually gone straight to the Dragon , where they were at that moment housed and mounting guard , and where their appearance had occasioned such a vast sensation that Mrs Lupin , scenting their errand before they had been under her roof half an hour , carried the news herself with all possible secrecy straight to Mr Pecksniff ’s house ; indeed it was her great caution in doing so which occasioned her to miss that gentleman , who entered at the front door of the Dragon just as she emerged from the back one . Moreover , Mr Anthony Chuzzlewit and his son Jonas were economically quartered at the Half Moon and Seven Stars , which was an obscure ale - house ; and by the very next coach there came posting to the scene of action , so many other affectionate members of the family ( who quarrelled with each other , inside and out , all the way down , to the utter distraction of the coachman ) , that in less than four - and - twenty hours the scanty tavern accommodation was at a premium , and all the private lodgings in the place , amounting to full four beds and sofa , rose cent per cent in the market . In a word , things came to that pass that nearly the whole family sat down before the Blue Dragon , and formally invested it ; and Martin Chuzzlewit was in a state of siege . But he resisted bravely ; refusing to receive all letters , messages , and parcels ; obstinately declining to treat with anybody ; and holding out no hope or promise of capitulation . Meantime the family forces were perpetually encountering each other in divers parts of the neighbourhood ; and , as no one branch of the Chuzzlewit tree had ever been known to agree with another within the memory of man , there was such a skirmishing , and flouting , and snapping off of heads , in the metaphorical sense of that expression ; such a bandying of words and calling of names ; such an upturning of noses and wrinkling of brows ; such a formal interment of good feelings and violent resurrection of ancient grievances ; as had never been known in those quiet parts since the earliest record of their civilized existence . At length , in utter despair and hopelessness , some few of the belligerents began to speak to each other in only moderate terms of mutual aggravation ; and nearly all addressed themselves with a show of tolerable decency to Mr Pecksniff , in recognition of his high character and influential position . Thus , by little and little , they made common cause of Martin Chuzzlewit ’s obduracy , until it was agreed ( if such a word can be used in connection with the Chuzzlewits ) that there should be a general council and conference held at Mr Pecksniff ’s house upon a certain day at noon ; which all members of the family who had brought themselves within reach of the summons , were forthwith bidden and invited , solemnly , to attend . If ever Mr Pecksniff wore an apostolic look , he wore it on this memorable day . If ever his unruffled smile proclaimed the words , ‘
28326	28406	28407	28407	I	0	’ that was its mission now . If ever man combined within himself all the mild qualities of the lamb with a considerable touch of the dove , and not a dash of the crocodile , or the least possible suggestion of the very mildest seasoning of the serpent , that man was he . And , oh , the two Miss Pecksniffs ! Oh , the serene expression on the face of Charity , which seemed to say , ‘
28436	28777	28423	28423	I	0	’ And , oh , the gay simplicity of Mercy ; so charming , innocent , and infant - like , that if she had gone out walking by herself , and it had been a little earlier in the season , the robin - redbreasts might have covered her with leaves against her will , believing her to be one of the sweet children in the wood , come out of it , and issuing forth once more to look for blackberries in the young freshness of her heart ! What words can paint the Pecksniffs in that trying hour ? Oh , none ; for words have naughty company among them , and the Pecksniffs were all goodness . But when the company arrived ! That was the time . When Mr Pecksniff , rising from his seat at the table ’s head , with a daughter on either hand , received his guests in the best parlour and motioned them to chairs , with eyes so overflowing and countenance so damp with gracious perspiration , that he may be said to have been in a kind of moist meekness ! And the company ; the jealous stony - hearted distrustful company , who were all shut up in themselves , and had no faith in anybody , and would n’t believe anything , and would no more allow themselves to be softened or lulled asleep by the Pecksniffs than if they had been so many hedgehogs or porcupines ! First , there was Mr Spottletoe , who was so bald and had such big whiskers , that he seemed to have stopped his hair , by the sudden application of some powerful remedy , in the very act of falling off his head , and to have fastened it irrevocably on his face . Then there was Mrs Spottletoe , who being much too slim for her years , and of a poetical constitution , was accustomed to inform her more intimate friends that the said whiskers were ‘
28784	29353	28423	28423	I	0	’ and who could now , by reason of her strong affection for her uncle Chuzzlewit , and the shock it gave her to be suspected of testamentary designs upon him , do nothing but cry -- except moan . Then there were Anthony Chuzzlewit , and his son Jonas ; the face of the old man so sharpened by the wariness and cunning of his life , that it seemed to cut him a passage through the crowded room , as he edged away behind the remotest chairs ; while the son had so well profited by the precept and example of the father , that he looked a year or two the elder of the twain , as they stood winking their red eyes , side by side , and whispering to each other softly . Then there was the widow of a deceased brother of Mr Martin Chuzzlewit , who being almost supernaturally disagreeable , and having a dreary face and a bony figure and a masculine voice , was , in right of these qualities , what is commonly called a strong - minded woman ; and who , if she could , would have established her claim to the title , and have shown herself , mentally speaking , a perfect Samson , by shutting up her brother - in - law in a private madhouse , until he proved his complete sanity by loving her very much . Beside her sat her spinster daughters , three in number , and of gentlemanly deportment , who had so mortified themselves with tight stays , that their tempers were reduced to something less than their waists , and sharp lacing was expressed in their very noses . Then there was a young gentleman , grandnephew of Mr Martin Chuzzlewit , very dark and very hairy , and apparently born for no particular purpose but to save looking - glasses the trouble of reflecting more than just the first idea and sketchy notion of a face , which had never been carried out . Then there was a solitary female cousin who was remarkable for nothing but being very deaf , and living by herself , and always having the toothache . Then there was George Chuzzlewit , a gay bachelor cousin , who claimed to be young but had been younger , and was inclined to corpulency , and rather overfed himself ; to that extent , indeed , that his eyes were strained in their sockets , as if with constant surprise ; and he had such an obvious disposition to pimples , that the bright spots on his cravat , the rich pattern on his waistcoat , and even his glittering trinkets , seemed to have broken out upon him , and not to have come into existence comfortably . Last of all there were present Mr Chevy Slyme and his friend Tigg . And it is worthy of remark , that although each person present disliked the other , mainly because he or she DID belong to the family , they one and all concurred in hating Mr Tigg because he did n’t . Such was the pleasant little family circle now assembled in Mr Pecksniff ’s best parlour , agreeably prepared to fall foul of Mr Pecksniff or anybody else who might venture to say anything whatever upon any subject . ‘
29356	29371	29373	29373	me	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , rising and looking round upon them with folded hands , ‘
29428	29429	29430	29430	I	0	’ ‘
29439	29453	29430	29430	I	0	’ remarked Mr Spottletoe , with his whiskers in a very portentous state ; ‘
29482	29494	29480	29480	sir	864	’ A general murmur echoed this inquiry , and applauded it . ‘
29511	29532	29480	29480	sir	864	’ pursued Mr Spottletoe in a great heat , and giving a violent rap on the table with his knuckles , ‘
29574	29670	29573	29573	sir--	8984	’ Oh yes , indeed ! HE tell . HE ! What ? He was the head , was he ? From the strong - minded woman downwards everybody fell , that instant , upon Mr Spottletoe , who after vainly attempting to be heard in silence was fain to sit down again , folding his arms and shaking his head most wrathfully , and giving Mrs Spottletoe to understand in dumb show , that that scoundrel Pecksniff might go on for the present , but he would cut in presently , and annihilate him . ‘
29676	29686	29671	29671	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff in resumption of his address , ‘
29735	29843	29859	29859	she	1233	’ Here , the eldest daughter of the strong - minded woman rose a little way from her seat , and trembling violently from head to foot , more as it seemed with passion than timidity , expressed a general hope that some people WOULD appear in their own characters , if it were only for such a proceeding having the attraction of novelty to recommend it ; and that when they ( meaning the some people before mentioned ) talked about their relations , they would be careful to observe who was present in company at the time ; otherwise it might come round to those relations ’
29977	29988	29999	29999	she	1233	‘ Those the cap fits , let them wear it , ’
30416	30423	30425	30426	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ It is to be lamented , ’
30438	30497	30425	30426	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ that our friend should have withdrawn himself so very hastily , though we have cause for mutual congratulation even in that , since we are assured that he is not distrustful of us in regard to anything we may say or do while he is absent . Now , that is very soothing , is it not ? ’
30498	30501	30503	30503	Anthony	270	‘ Pecksniff , ’
30523	30524	30520	30521	a hypocrite	1256	’ ‘
30532	30537	30538	30539	A hypocrite	1256	’ demanded Mr Pecksniff . ‘
30541	30542	30538	30539	A hypocrite	1256	’ ‘
30548	30553	30538	30539	A hypocrite	1256	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
30586	30625	30575	30577	Mr Anthony Chuzzlewit	270	’ This was said in a very bland voice , and aside , as being addressed to his daughter ’s private ear . With a cheerfulness of conscience , prompting almost a sprightly demeanour , he then resumed : ‘
30679	30701	30704	30706	my dear madam	1263	’ The strong - minded lady was not at all sure that this was a blessed exception . Quite the contrary . ‘
30708	30713	30704	30706	my dear madam	1263	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘
30740	30741	30772	30772	you	0	’ ‘
30751	30759	30772	30772	you	0	’ said the strong - minded lady , ‘

30895	31038	31039	31039	You	1271	’ In their strong feeling on this point , they , who agreed in nothing else , all concurred as one mind . Good Heaven , that she should harbour designs upon his property ! The strong - minded lady was for poison , her three daughters were for Bridewell and bread - and - water , the cousin with the toothache advocated Botany Bay , the two Miss Pecksniffs suggested flogging . Nobody but Mr Tigg , who , notwithstanding his extreme shabbiness , was still understood to be in some sort a lady ’s man , in right of his upper lip and his frogs , indicated a doubt of the justifiable nature of these measures ; and he only ogled the three Miss Chuzzlewits with the least admixture of banter in his admiration , as though he would observe , ‘
31061	31062	31058	31058	you	1271	’ ‘
31065	31085	31058	31058	you	1271	’ said Mr Pecksniff , crossing his two forefingers in a manner which was at once conciliatory and argumentative ; ‘
31117	31124	31127	31127	I	0	’ one of his ornamental sentences ; ‘
31179	31180	31174	31174	I	0	’ ‘
31183	31195	31174	31174	I	0	’ interposed the strong - minded woman in a loud voice . ‘
31201	31206	31197	31197	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘

31253	31257	31251	31251	Pa	242	’ cried Mercy . ‘
31267	31278	31280	31280	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , smiling upon his assembled kindred , ‘
31316	31321	31251	31251	Pa	242	’ Mr George Chuzzlewit suggested ‘

31328	31333	31251	31251	Pa	242	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘
31346	31368	31344	31344	you	0	’ The nephew with the outline of a countenance , speaking for the first and last time on that occasion , propounded ‘
31371	31372	31344	31344	you	0	’ ‘
31375	31386	31344	31344	you	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , with his own peculiar urbanity , ‘

31560	31570	31573	31573	him	275	’ interposed the strong - minded woman , sternly , ‘
31597	31598	31592	31592	he	275	’ ‘
31612	31619	31609	31610	Mrs Ned	278	’ returned Mr George , angrily , ‘

31699	31707	31693	31693	I	0	’ cried the strong - minded woman . ‘
31718	31730	31715	31716	a cannibal	1296	’ said Mr George Chuzzlewit , greatly stimulated by this retort , ‘
31762	31771	31773	31773	I	0	’ The strong - minded woman immediately rose . ‘
31778	31792	31773	31773	I	0	’ said Mr George , nodding his head violently at every second syllable ; ‘
31957	31958	31959	31959	I	0	’ ‘
31967	31995	31959	31959	I	0	’ cried the strong - minded woman , looking about her with a disdainful smile as she moved towards the door , followed by her three daughters . ‘
32019	32020	32079	32079	It	1312	’ ‘
32028	32039	32041	32042	Miss Charity	241	’ gaze at me , ma’am , if you please , ’
32044	32052	32041	32042	Miss Charity	241	‘ for I wo n’t bear it . ’
32083	32099	32101	32102	Mrs Ned	278	‘ I passed from the memory of a grateful country , you very miserable minx , ’
32104	32157	32101	32102	Mrs Ned	278	‘ when I entered this family ; and I feel now , though I did not feel then , that it served me right , and that I lost my claim upon the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland when I so degraded myself . Now , my dears , if you ’re
32229	32424	32425	32427	My good sir	1257	’ With such departing words , did this strong - minded female paralyse the Pecksniffian energies ; and so she swept out of the room , and out of the house , attended by her daughters , who , as with one accord , elevated their three noses in the air , and joined in a contemptuous titter . As they passed the parlour window on the outside , they were seen to counterfeit a perfect transport of delight among themselves ; and with this final blow and great discouragement for those within , they vanished . Before Mr Pecksniff or any of his remaining visitors could offer a remark , another figure passed this window , coming , at a great rate in the opposite direction ; and immediately afterwards , Mr Spottletoe burst into the chamber . Compared with his present state of heat , he had gone out a man of snow or ice . His head distilled such oil upon his whiskers , that they were rich and clogged with unctuous drops ; his face was violently inflamed , his limbs trembled ; and he gasped and strove for breath . ‘
32429	32434	32425	32427	My good sir	1257	’ cried Mr Pecksniff . ‘
32438	32443	32425	32427	My good sir	1257	’ returned the other ; ‘
32471	32472	32465	32465	him	1317	’ ‘
32478	32483	32459	32459	You	0	’ cried several voices . ‘
32487	32494	32459	32459	You	0	’ cried Spottletoe , still gasping . ‘
32512	32513	32508	32508	HE’ll	1317	’ ‘
32521	32533	32534	32534	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , looking about him in utter amazement . ‘
32545	32546	32538	32538	he	1317	’ ‘
32551	32556	32549	32549	sir	864	’ cried the other . ‘
32623	32624	32621	32621	sir	864	’ ‘
32627	32633	32621	32621	sir	864	’ was the general cry . ‘
32636	32641	32621	32621	sir	864	’ echoed Mr Spottletoe . ‘
32720	33031	33038	33039	MR PECKSNIFF	218	’ Adding to these exclamations a kind of ironical howl , and gazing upon the company for one brief instant afterwards , in a sudden silence , the irritated gentleman started off again at the same tremendous pace , and was seen no more . It was in vain for Mr Pecksniff to assure them that this new and opportune evasion of the family was at least as great a shock and surprise to him as to anybody else . Of all the bullyings and denunciations that were ever heaped on one unlucky head , none can ever have exceeded in energy and heartiness those with which he was complimented by each of his remaining relatives , singly , upon bidding him farewell . The moral position taken by Mr Tigg was something quite tremendous ; and the deaf cousin , who had the complicated aggravation of seeing all the proceedings and hearing nothing but the catastrophe , actually scraped her shoes upon the scraper , and afterwards distributed impressions of them all over the top step , in token that she shook the dust from her feet before quitting that dissembling and perfidious mansion . Mr Pecksniff had , in short , but one comfort , and that was the knowledge that all these his relations and friends had hated him to the very utmost extent before ; and that he , for his part , had not distributed among them any more love than , with his ample capital in that respect , he could comfortably afford to part with . This view of his affairs yielded him great consolation ; and the fact deserves to be noted , as showing with what ease a good man may be consoled under circumstances of failure and disappointment . CHAPTER FIVE CONTAINING A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE INSTALLATION OF MR PECKSNIFF ’S
33040	33430	33038	33039	MR PECKSNIFF	218	’S FAMILY . WITH ALL THE FESTIVITIES HELD ON THAT OCCASION , AND THE GREAT ENJOYMENT OF MR PINCH The best of architects and land surveyors kept a horse , in whom the enemies already mentioned more than once in these pages pretended to detect a fanciful resemblance to his master . Not in his outward person , for he was a raw - boned , haggard horse , always on a much shorter allowance of corn than Mr Pecksniff ; but in his moral character , wherein , said they , he was full of promise , but of no performance . He was always in a manner , going to go , and never going . When at his slowest rate of travelling he would sometimes lift up his legs so high , and display such mighty action , that it was difficult to believe he was doing less than fourteen miles an hour ; and he was for ever so perfectly satisfied with his own speed , and so little disconcerted by opportunities of comparing himself with the fastest trotters , that the illusion was the more difficult of resistance . He was a kind of animal who infused into the breasts of strangers a lively sense of hope , and possessed all those who knew him better with a grim despair . In what respect , having these points of character , he might be fairly likened to his master , that good man ’s slanderers only can explain . But it is a melancholy truth , and a deplorable instance of the uncharitableness of the world , that they made the comparison . In this horse , and the hooded vehicle , whatever its proper name might be , to which he was usually harnessed -- it was more like a gig with a tumour than anything else -- all Mr Pinch ’s thoughts and wishes centred , one bright frosty morning ; for with this gallant equipage he was about to drive to Salisbury alone , there to meet with the new pupil , and thence to bring him home in triumph . Blessings on thy simple heart , Tom Pinch , how proudly dost thou button up that scanty coat , called by a sad misnomer , for these many years , a ‘
33432	33450	33038	33039	MR PECKSNIFF	218	’ one ; and how thoroughly , as with thy cheerful voice thou pleasantly adjurest Sam the hostler ‘
33458	33629	33038	33039	MR PECKSNIFF	218	’ dost thou believe that quadruped desires to go , and would go if he might ! Who could repress a smile -- of love for thee , Tom Pinch , and not in jest at thy expense , for thou art poor enough already , Heaven knows -- to think that such a holiday as lies before thee should awaken that quick flow and hurry of the spirits , in which thou settest down again , almost untasted , on the kitchen window - sill , that great white mug ( put by , by thy own hands , last night , that breakfast might not hold thee late ) , and layest yonder crust upon the seat beside thee , to be eaten on the road , when thou art calmer in thy high rejoicing ! Who , as thou drivest off , a happy , man , and noddest with a grateful lovingness to Pecksniff in his nightcap at his chamber - window , would not cry , ‘
33663	34065	34066	34067	Mr Pinch	221	’ What better time for driving , riding , walking , moving through the air by any means , than a fresh , frosty morning , when hope runs cheerily through the veins with the brisk blood , and tingles in the frame from head to foot ! This was the glad commencement of a bracing day in early winter , such as may put the languid summer season ( speaking of it when it ca n’t be had ) to the blush , and shame the spring for being sometimes cold by halves . The sheep - bells rang as clearly in the vigorous air , as if they felt its wholesome influence like living creatures ; the trees , in lieu of leaves or blossoms , shed upon the ground a frosty rime that sparkled as it fell , and might have been the dust of diamonds . So it was to Tom . From cottage chimneys , smoke went streaming up high , high , as if the earth had lost its grossness , being so fair , and must not be oppressed by heavy vapour . The crust of ice on the else rippling brook was so transparent , and so thin in texture , that the lively water might of its own free will have stopped -- in Tom ’s glad mind it had -- to look upon the lovely morning . And lest the sun should break this charm too eagerly , there moved between him and the ground , a mist like that which waits upon the moon on summer nights -- the very same to Tom -- and wooed him to dissolve it gently . Tom Pinch went on ; not fast , but with a sense of rapid motion , which did just as well ; and as he went , all kinds of things occurred to keep him happy . Thus when he came within sight of the turnpike , and was -- oh a long way off!--he saw the tollman ’s wife , who had that moment checked a waggon , run back into the little house again like mad , to say ( she knew ) that Mr Pinch was coming up . And she was right , for when he drew within hail of the gate , forth rushed the tollman ’s children , shrieking in tiny chorus , ‘
34069	34307	34066	34067	Mr Pinch	221	’ to Tom ’s intense delight . The very tollman , though an ugly chap in general , and one whom folks were rather shy of handling , came out himself to take the toll , and give him rough good morning ; and that with all this , and a glimpse of the family breakfast on a little round table before the fire , the crust Tom Pinch had brought away with him acquired as rich a flavour as though it had been cut from a fairy loaf . But there was more than this . It was not only the married people and the children who gave Tom Pinch a welcome as he passed . No , no . Sparkling eyes and snowy breasts came hurriedly to many an upper casement as he clattered by , and gave him back his greeting : not stinted either , but sevenfold , good measure . They were all merry . They all laughed . And some of the wickedest among them even kissed their hands as Tom looked back . For who minded poor Mr Pinch ? There was no harm in HIM . And now the morning grew so fair , and all things were so wide awake and gay , that the sun seeming to say -- Tom had no doubt he said--‘I ca n’t stand it any longer ; I must have a look , ’
34600	34605	34607	34608	Tom Pinch	249	‘ Why , Mark ? ’
34612	34628	34629	34629	Mark	222	‘ Who ’d have thought of seeing you here ? Well ! this is surprising ! ’
34652	34661	34663	34664	Mr Pinch	221	‘ And how spruce you are , too ! ’
34672	34691	34663	34664	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Really , I did n’t think you were half such a tight - made fellow , Mark ! ’
34692	34732	34735	34735	he	222	‘ Thankee , Mr Pinch . Pretty well for that , I believe . It ’s not my fault , you know . With regard to being spruce , sir , that ’s where it is , you see . ’
34740	34745	34746	34747	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Where what is ? ’
34750	34805	34746	34747	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Where the aggravation of it is . Any man may be in good spirits and good temper when he ’s well dressed . There an’t much credit in that . If I was very ragged and very jolly , then I should begin to feel I had gained a point , Mr Pinch . ’
34806	34831	34833	34833	Pinch	221	‘ So you were singing just now , to bear up , as it were , against being well dressed , eh , Mark ? ’
34835	34846	34848	34848	Mark	222	‘ Your conversation ’s always equal to print , sir , ’
34855	34860	34848	34848	Mark	222	‘ That was it . ’
34861	34864	34866	34866	Pinch	221	‘ Well ! ’
34868	34921	34866	34866	Pinch	221	‘ you are the strangest young man , Mark , I ever knew in my life . I always thought so ; but now I am quite certain of it . I am going to Salisbury , too . Will you get in ? I shall be very glad of your company . ’
34985	35001	35003	35003	Pinch	221	‘ I more than half believed , just now , seeing you so very smart , ’
35005	35017	35003	35003	Pinch	221	‘ that you must be going to be married , Mark . ’
35018	35031	35032	35032	he	1339	‘ Well , sir , I ’ve thought of that , too , ’
35035	35048	35032	35032	he	1339	‘ There might be some credit in being jolly with a wife , ‘
35067	35082	35032	35032	he	1339	’m a’most afraid to try it . I do n’t see my way clear . ’
35083	35085	35032	35032	he	1339	‘ You ’re
35094	35098	35104	35104	I	0	’ said Pinch . ‘

35127	35132	35118	35118	Mark	222	’ said Mr Pinch , ‘

35172	35173	35118	35118	Mark	222	’ ‘
35178	35190	35118	35118	Mark	222	’ said Mr Pinch . At which they both laughed gayly . ‘
35197	35201	35118	35118	Mark	222	’ said Mark , ‘
35289	35300	35288	35288	I	0	’m a - going to leave the Dragon , sir . ’
35301	35308	35310	35311	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Going to leave the Dragon ! ’
35320	35331	35310	35311	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Why , Mark , you take my breath away ! ’

35573	35595	35556	35556	sir	864	’ said Mr Pinch , after a short silence , his usually subdued tone being even now more subdued than ever . ‘
35618	35670	35616	35616	Mark	222	’ Mark looked more fixedly before him , and further off still , as he answered that he did n’t suppose it would be much of an object to her . There were plenty of smart young fellows as would be glad of the place . He knew a dozen himself . ‘

35821	35841	35806	35806	Mark	222	’ returned the other , withdrawing his gaze from the horizon , and looking at his fellow - traveller . ‘

35965	35970	35971	35971	Mark	222	‘ I was thinking , ’
35974	35984	35971	35971	Mark	222	‘ of something in the grave - digging way . ’
35985	35991	35993	35994	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Good gracious , Mark ? ’
35996	36010	36012	36012	Mark	222	‘ It ’s a good damp , wormy sort of business , sir , ’
36019	36071	36012	36012	Mark	222	‘ and there might be some credit in being jolly , with one ’s mind in that pursuit , unless grave - diggers is usually given that way ; which would be a drawback . You do n’t happen to know how that is in general , do you , sir ? ’
36072	36075	36077	36078	Mr Pinch	221	‘ No , ’
36080	36093	36077	36078	Mr Pinch	221	‘ I do n’t indeed . I never thought upon the subject . ’
36094	36112	36114	36114	Mark	222	‘ In case of that not turning out as well as one could wish , you know , ’
36119	36216	36114	36114	Mark	222	‘ there ’s other businesses . Undertaking now . That ’s gloomy . There might be credit to be gained there . A broker ’s man in a poor neighbourhood would n’t be bad perhaps . A jailor sees a deal of misery . A doctor ’s man is in the very midst of murder . A bailiff ’s an’t a lively office nat’rally . Even a tax - gatherer must find his feelings rather worked upon , at times . There ’s lots of trades in which I should have an opportunity , I think . ’
36296	36304	36306	36307	Mr Pinch	221	‘ But bless my soul , Mark , ’

36358	36368	36370	36370	Mark	222	‘ What ’s the good of one , sir ? ’
36372	36377	36379	36380	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Good of one ? ’
36382	36391	36379	36380	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Why , to keep your chest warm . ’
36392	36399	36401	36401	Mark	222	‘ Lord love you , sir ! ’
36403	36456	36401	36401	Mark	222	‘ you do n’t know me . My chest do n’t want no warming . Even if it did , what would no waistcoat bring it to ? Inflammation of the lungs , perhaps ? Well , there ’d be some credit in being jolly , with a inflammation of the lungs . ’
36833	37128	36832	36840	farmers ’ wives in beaver bonnets and red cloaks	9528	’ wives in beaver bonnets and red cloaks , riding shaggy horses purged of all earthly passions , who went soberly into all manner of places without desiring to know why , and who , if required , would have stood stock still in a china shop , with a complete dinner - service at each hoof . Also a great many dogs , who were strongly interested in the state of the market and the bargains of their masters ; and a great confusion of tongues , both brute and human . Mr Pinch regarded everything exposed for sale with great delight , and was particularly struck by the itinerant cutlery , which he considered of the very keenest kind , insomuch that he purchased a pocket knife with seven blades in it , and not a cut ( as he afterwards found out ) among them . When he had exhausted the market - place , and watched the farmers safe into the market dinner , he went back to look after the horse . Having seen him eat unto his heart ’s content he issued forth again , to wander round the town and regale himself with the shop windows ; previously taking a long stare at the bank , and wondering in what direction underground the caverns might be where they kept the money ; and turning to look back at one or two young men who passed him , whom he knew to be articled to solicitors in the town ; and who had a sort of fearful interest in his eyes , as jolly dogs who knew a thing or two , and kept it up tremendously . But the shops . First of all there were the jewellers ’
37312	37320	37354	37354	they	1391	‘ Master Pinch , Grove House Academy , ’
37689	37761	37687	37688	the robbers	1403	’ cave . Which matchless wonders , coming fast on Mr Pinch ’s mind , did so rub up and chafe that wonderful lamp within him , that when he turned his face towards the busy street , a crowd of phantoms waited on his pleasure , and he lived again , with new delight , the happy days before the Pecksniff era . He had less interest now in the chemists ’
37817	38541	38579	38579	I	0	’ , where the newest metropolitan waistcoat patterns were hanging up , which by some strange transformation always looked amazing there , and never appeared at all like the same thing anywhere else . But he stopped to read the playbill at the theatre and surveyed the doorway with a kind of awe , which was not diminished when a sallow gentleman with long dark hair came out , and told a boy to run home to his lodgings and bring down his broadsword . Mr Pinch stood rooted to the spot on hearing this , and might have stood there until dark , but that the old cathedral bell began to ring for vesper service , on which he tore himself away . Now , the organist ’s assistant was a friend of Mr Pinch ’s , which was a good thing , for he too was a very quiet gentle soul , and had been , like Tom , a kind of old - fashioned boy at school , though well liked by the noisy fellow too . As good luck would have it ( Tom always said he had great good luck ) the assistant chanced that very afternoon to be on duty by himself , with no one in the dusty organ loft but Tom ; so while he played , Tom helped him with the stops ; and finally , the service being just over , Tom took the organ himself . It was then turning dark , and the yellow light that streamed in through the ancient windows in the choir was mingled with a murky red . As the grand tones resounded through the church , they seemed , to Tom , to find an echo in the depth of every ancient tomb , no less than in the deep mystery of his own heart . Great thoughts and hopes came crowding on his mind as the rich music rolled upon the air and yet among them -- something more grave and solemn in their purpose , but the same -- were all the images of that day , down to its very lightest recollection of childhood . The feeling that the sounds awakened , in the moment of their existence , seemed to include his whole life and being ; and as the surrounding realities of stone and wood and glass grew dimmer in the darkness , these visions grew so much the brighter that Tom might have forgotten the new pupil and the expectant master , and have sat there pouring out his grateful heart till midnight , but for a very earthy old verger insisting on locking up the cathedral forthwith . So he took leave of his friend , with many thanks , groped his way out , as well as he could , into the now lamp - lighted streets , and hurried off to get his dinner . All the farmers being by this time jogging homewards , there was nobody in the sanded parlour of the tavern where he had left the horse ; so he had his little table drawn out close before the fire , and fell to work upon a well - cooked steak and smoking hot potatoes , with a strong appreciation of their excellence , and a very keen sense of enjoyment . Beside him , too , there stood a jug of most stupendous Wiltshire beer ; and the effect of the whole was so transcendent , that he was obliged every now and then to lay down his knife and fork , rub his hands , and think about it . By the time the cheese and celery came , Mr Pinch had taken a book out of his pocket , and could afford to trifle with the viands ; now eating a little , now drinking a little , now reading a little , and now stopping to wonder what sort of a young man the new pupil would turn out to be . He had passed from this latter theme and was deep in his book again , when the door opened , and another guest came in , bringing with him such a quantity of cold air , that he positively seemed at first to put the fire out . ‘
38551	38573	38579	38579	I	0	’ said the newcomer , courteously acknowledging Mr Pinch ’s withdrawal of the little table , that he might have place : ‘
38582	38635	38579	38579	I	0	’ Though he said this with a vast amount of consideration for Mr Pinch ’s comfort , he dragged one of the great leather - bottomed chairs to the very centre of the hearth , notwithstanding ; and sat down in front of the fire , with a foot on each hob . ‘
38650	38651	38652	38652	You	864	’ ‘
38666	38671	38652	38652	You	864	’ said Mr Pinch . ‘
38681	38682	38686	38686	his	864	’ ‘
38693	38698	38699	38700	Poor fellow	1409	’ thought Mr Pinch . ‘
38709	38967	38968	38968	We	1410	’ The stranger became thoughtful likewise , and sat for five or ten minutes looking at the fire in silence . At length he rose and divested himself of his shawl and great - coat , which ( far different from Mr Pinch ’s ) was a very warm and thick one ; but he was not a whit more conversational out of his great - coat than in it , for he sat down again in the same place and attitude , and leaning back in his chair , began to bite his nails . He was young -- one - and - twenty , perhaps -- and handsome ; with a keen dark eye , and a quickness of look and manner which made Tom sensible of a great contrast in his own bearing , and caused him to feel even more shy than usual . There was a clock in the room , which the stranger often turned to look at . Tom made frequent reference to it also ; partly from a nervous sympathy with its taciturn companion ; and partly because the new pupil was to inquire for him at half after six , and the hands were getting on towards that hour . Whenever the stranger caught him looking at this clock , a kind of confusion came upon Tom as if he had been found out in something ; and it was a perception of his uneasiness which caused the younger man to say , perhaps , with a smile : ‘
38993	38994	38989	38990	a gentleman	871	’ ‘
38999	39004	38997	38997	I	0	’ said Mr Pinch . ‘

39023	39042	39043	39045	The young gentleman	883	’ said Tom in the very same breath ; whereupon the other looked at him with some surprise . ‘
39050	39056	39043	39045	The young gentleman	883	’ remarked Tom , timidly , ‘
39072	39073	39070	39070	Pinch	249	’ ‘
39077	39085	39070	39070	Pinch	249	’ cried the other , jumping up . ‘

39142	39146	39148	39148	you	883	’ said Tom , ‘
39187	39239	39182	39182	I	0	’ said Tom , smiling with an embarrassed frankness peculiarly his , and which was as plainly a confession of his own imperfections , and an appeal to the kindness of the person he addressed , as if he had drawn one up in simple language and committed it to paper : ‘
39275	39276	39277	39277	I	0	’ ‘
39285	39295	39277	39277	I	0	’ returned Martin , shaking hands with him again ; ‘

39325	39333	39335	39335	you	0	’ said Tom , with great pleasure . ‘

39472	39577	39578	39579	Mr Pinch	221	‘ If you like punch , you ’ll allow me to order a glass apiece , as hot as it can be made , that we may usher in our friendship in a becoming manner . To let you into a secret , Mr Pinch , I never was so much in want of something warm and cheering in my life ; but I did n’t like to run the chance of being found drinking it , without knowing what kind of person you were ; for first impressions , you know , often go a long way , and last a long time . ’

39751	39763	39765	39766	the other	934	’re not surprised at my having two names , I suppose ? ’
39775	39780	39765	39766	the other	934	‘ Most people have . ’
39781	39786	39788	39789	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Oh , no , ’
39791	39802	39788	39789	Mr Pinch	221	‘ not at all . Oh dear no ! Well ! ’
39885	39901	39903	39904	Mr Pinch	221	‘ I told them in the stable to be ready for us ten minutes ago , ’
39912	39917	39903	39904	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Shall we go ? ’
39918	39923	39925	39926	the other	934	‘ If you please , ’
39928	39935	39937	39938	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Would you like to drive ? ’
39954	39962	39937	39938	Mr Pinch	221	‘ You shall , if you wish . ’
39963	39972	39974	39974	Martin	221	‘ Why , that depends , Mr Pinch , ’
39978	40012	40013	40013	He	221	‘ upon what sort of a horse you have . Because if he ’s a bad one , I would rather keep my hands warm by holding them comfortably in my greatcoat pockets . ’

40122	40141	40113	40113	Martin	221	‘ By the bye , there ’s a box of mine . Can we manage to take it ? ’
40142	40147	40149	40149	Tom	249	‘ Oh , certainly , ’
40151	40160	40149	40149	Tom	249	‘ Put it in , Dick , anywhere ! ’
40224	40229	40221	40221	Tom	249	‘ Not at all ; ’

40719	40722	40724	40725	his friend	9006	‘ Well , ’
40727	40735	40724	40725	his friend	9006	‘ you ARE a very strange fellow ! ’
40745	40751	40753	40754	Mr Pinch	221	‘ When I say nothing , ’
40758	40817	40753	40754	Mr Pinch	221	‘ I am wrong , and do n’t say what I mean , because I get a great deal of pleasure from it , and the means of passing some of the happiest hours I know . It led to something else the other day ; but you will not care to hear about that I dare say ? ’
40818	40826	40724	40725	his friend	9006	‘ Oh yes I shall . What ? ’
40827	40834	40836	40836	Tom	249	‘ It led to my seeing , ’
40843	40859	40836	40836	Tom	249	‘ one of the loveliest and most beautiful faces you can possibly picture to yourself . ’
40860	40872	40874	40875	his friend	9006	‘ And yet I am able to picture a beautiful one , ’
40879	40890	40874	40875	his friend	9006	‘ or should be , if I have any memory . ’
40891	40894	40896	40896	Tom	249	‘ She came ’
40907	40984	40896	40896	Tom	249	‘ for the first time very early in the morning , when it was hardly light ; and when I saw her , over my shoulder , standing just within the porch , I turned quite cold , almost believing her to be a spirit . A moment ’s reflection got the better of that , of course , and fortunately it came to my relief so soon , that I did n’t leave off playing . ’
40985	40989	40836	40836	Tom	249	‘ Why fortunately ? ’
40990	41046	40874	40875	his friend	9006	‘ Why ? Because she stood there , listening . I had my spectacles on , and saw her through the chinks in the curtains as plainly as I see you ; and she was beautiful . After a while she glided off , and I continued to play until she was out of hearing . ’
41047	41054	40896	40896	Tom	249	‘ Why did you do that ? ’
41055	41061	41063	41063	Tom	249	‘ Do n’t you see ? ’
41065	41080	41063	41063	Tom	249	‘ Because she might suppose I had n’t seen her ; and might return . ’
41081	41086	40896	40896	Tom	249	‘ And did she ? ’
41087	41191	40874	40875	his friend	9006	‘ Certainly she did . Next morning , and next evening too ; but always when there were no people about , and always alone . I rose earlier and sat there later , that when she came , she might find the church door open , and the organ playing , and might not be disappointed . She strolled that way for some days , and always stayed to listen . But she is gone now , and of all unlikely things in this wide world , it is perhaps the most improbable that I shall ever look upon her face again . ’
41192	41202	40896	40896	Tom	249	‘ You do n’t know anything more about her ? ’
41203	41206	40896	40896	Tom	249	‘ No . ’
41207	41218	40874	40875	his friend	9006	‘ And you never followed her when she went away ? ’
41219	41229	41231	41232	Tom Pinch	249	‘ Why should I distress her by doing that ? ’
41234	41281	41283	41283	Tom	249	‘ Is it likely that she wanted my company ? She came to hear the organ , not to see me ; and would you have had me scare her from a place she seemed to grow quite fond of ? Now , Heaven bless her ! ’
41285	41357	41283	41283	Tom	249	‘ to have given her but a minute ’s pleasure every day , I would have gone on playing the organ at those times until I was an old man ; quite contented if she sometimes thought of a poor fellow like me , as a part of the music ; and more than recompensed if she ever mixed me up with anything she liked as well as she liked that ! ’
41699	41719	41655	41655	she	244	’ said Mr Pecksniff , looking up , and gradually exchanging his abstracted face for one of joyful recognition . ‘
41740	41786	41729	41729	I	0	’ With this kind greeting , Mr Pecksniff fairly took him to his arms , and patted him several times upon the back with his right hand the while , as if to express that his feelings during the embrace were too much for utterance . ‘

41868	41875	41859	41859	Martin	221	’ said Mr Pecksniff , smiling , ‘
41887	41989	41882	41882	I	0	’ Oh blessed star of Innocence , wherever you may be , how did you glitter in your home of ether , when the two Miss Pecksniffs put forth each her lily hand , and gave the same , with mantling cheeks , to Martin ! How did you twinkle , as if fluttering with sympathy , when Mercy , reminded of the bonnet in her hair , hid her fair face and turned her head aside ; the while her gentle sister plucked it out , and smote her with a sister ’s soft reproof , upon her buxom shoulder ! ‘

42212	42229	42235	42235	Martin	221	’ he added in a happier tone , as he shook Mr Pinch ’s elbow hard . ‘
42264	42295	42296	42296	You	221	’ With that he took up a lighted candle , and , attended by his young relative , prepared to leave the room . At the door , he stopped . ‘
42305	42334	42302	42303	Tom Pinch	249	’ Aye , cheerfully , though it had been to death , would Tom have followed him ; glad to lay down his life for such a man ! ‘
42337	42350	42302	42303	Tom Pinch	249	’ said Mr Pecksniff , opening the door of an opposite parlour , ‘
42374	42379	42406	42406	Spoker	292	’ opening another door , ‘
42433	42484	42431	42431	myself	0	’ Martin thought it was very like , but scarcely intellectual enough . Mr Pecksniff observed that the same fault had been found with it before . It was remarkable it should have struck his young relation too . He was glad to see he had an eye for art . ‘
42490	42502	42431	42431	myself	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , waving his hand towards the wall , ‘

42592	42709	42841	42841	he	0	’ These latter words were explained by his pointing to a small round table on which were a lamp , divers sheets of paper , a piece of India rubber , and a case of instruments ; all put ready , in case an architectural idea should come into Mr Pecksniff ’s head in the night ; in which event he would instantly leap out of bed , and fix it for ever . Mr Pecksniff opened another door on the same floor , and shut it again , all at once , as if it were a Blue Chamber . But before he had well done so , he looked smilingly round , and said , ‘
42713	42747	42748	42749	My daughters	1217	’ Martin could n’t say why not , because he did n’t know anything at all about it . So Mr Pecksniff answered himself , by throwing open the door , and saying : ‘
42750	42784	42748	42749	My daughters	1217	’ room . A poor first - floor to us , but a bower to them . Very neat . Very airy . Plants you observe ; hyacinths ; books again ; birds . ’
42814	42838	42841	42841	he	0	‘ Such trifles as girls love are here . Nothing more . Those who seek heartless splendour , would seek here in vain . ’
42849	42852	42854	42855	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ This , ’
42869	42932	42933	42933	Tom	249	‘ is a room where some talent has been developed I believe . This is a room in which an idea for a steeple occurred to me that I may one day give to the world . We work here , my dear Martin . Some architects have been bred in this room ; a few , I think , Mr Pinch ? ’
42947	42951	42953	42954	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ You see , ’
42967	43052	43053	43053	he	218	‘ some traces of our doings here . Salisbury Cathedral from the north . From the south . From the east . From the west . From the south - east . From the nor’west . A bridge . An almshouse . A jail . A church . A powder - magazine . A wine - cellar . A portico . A summer - house . An ice - house . Plans , elevations , sections , every kind of thing . And this , ’
43076	43154	43053	43053	he	218	‘ this is your room , of which Mr Pinch here is the quiet sharer . A southern aspect ; a charming prospect ; Mr Pinch ’s little library , you perceive ; everything agreeable and appropriate . If there is any additional comfort you would desire to have here at anytime , pray mention it . Even to strangers , far less to you , my dear Martin , there is no restriction on that point . ’
43210	43215	43217	43218	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ The domestic assistants , ’
43220	43229	43217	43218	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ sleep above ; and that is all . ’
43496	43499	43500	43500	he	218	‘ Martin , ’
43503	43560	43500	43500	he	218	‘ will seat himself between you two , my dears , and Mr Pinch will come by me . Let us drink to our new inmate , and may we be happy together ! Martin , my dear friend , my love to you ! Mr Pinch , if you spare the bottle we shall quarrel . ’
43599	43602	43603	43603	he	218	‘ This , ’
43616	43634	43603	43603	he	218	‘ is a mingling that repays one for much disappointment and vexation . Let us be merry . ’
43643	43662	43603	43603	he	218	‘ It is a poor heart that never rejoices ; and our hearts are not poor . No ! ’
44120	44124	44126	44126	Pecksniff	218	‘ Mr Pinch , ’
44140	44165	44166	44167	Mr Pinch	221	‘ I do n’t see any snuffers in that candlestick . Will you oblige me by going down , and asking for a pair ? ’
44180	44193	44195	44196	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ You will excuse Thomas Pinch ’s want of polish , Martin , ’
44215	44220	44195	44196	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ He means well . ’
44221	44231	44166	44167	Mr Pinch	221	‘ He is a very good fellow , sir . ’
44232	44237	44239	44240	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Oh , yes , ’
44242	44264	44239	44240	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Yes . Thomas Pinch means well . He is very grateful . I have never regretted having befriended Thomas Pinch . ’
44265	44275	44166	44167	Mr Pinch	221	‘ I should think you never would , sir . ’
44276	44279	44281	44282	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ No , ’
44284	44363	44281	44282	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ No . I hope not . Poor fellow , he is always disposed to do his best ; but he is not gifted . You will make him useful to you , Martin , if you please . If Thomas has a fault , it is that he is sometimes a little apt to forget his position . But that is soon checked . Worthy soul ! You will find him easy to manage . Good night ! ’
44364	44370	44374	44375	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Good night , sir . ’
44382	44392	44394	44394	Pecksniff	218	‘ And good night to YOU , Mr Pinch , ’
44396	44410	44394	44394	Pecksniff	218	‘ And sound sleep to you both . Bless you ! Bless you ! ’
44934	44936	44966	44966	He	221	‘ troubled ’
45001	45008	44992	44992	he	221	‘ that he did n’t get on ’
45156	45162	45163	45163	he	218	‘ It is not often , ’
45166	45199	45163	45163	he	218	‘ Martin , that my daughters and I desert our quiet home to pursue the giddy round of pleasures that revolves abroad . But we think of doing so to - day . ’
45200	45205	45207	45209	the new pupil	9471	‘ Indeed , sir ! ’
45211	45214	45216	45217	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Yes , ’
45233	45324	45326	45327	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I have a summons here to repair to London ; on professional business , my dear Martin ; strictly on professional business ; and I promised my girls , long ago , that whenever that happened again , they should accompany me . We shall go forth to - night by the heavy coach -- like the dove of old , my dear Martin -- and it will be a week before we again deposit our olive - branches in the passage . When I say olive - branches , ’
45332	45340	45326	45327	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I mean , our unpretending luggage . ’
45341	45352	45354	45354	Martin	221	‘ I hope the young ladies will enjoy their trip , ’
45356	45361	45326	45327	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Oh ! that I ’m
45366	45374	45354	45354	Martin	221	’ cried Mercy , clapping her hands . ‘
45388	45389	45390	45391	Ardent child	1538	’ ‘
45393	45406	45390	45391	Ardent child	1538	’ said Mr Pecksniff , gazing on her in a dreamy way . ‘
45528	45564	45523	45523	they	1542	’ At this dread allusion to John Westlock , Mr Pinch precipitately choked in his tea ; for he had that very morning received a letter from him , as Mr Pecksniff very well knew . ‘
45574	45584	45565	45565	You	1543	’ said Mr Pecksniff , resuming his former cheerfulness , ‘
45642	45643	45644	45648	A one - eyed calender	1549	’ ‘
45655	45659	45650	45650	I	0	’ faltered Tom . ‘
45671	45679	45668	45668	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , smiling compassionately ; ‘
45743	45851	45724	45724	You	1543	’ There was not the least objection , doubtless , to the young man ’s slaughtering and appropriating to his own use any calf , fat or lean , that he might happen to find upon the premises ; but as no such animal chanced at that time to be grazing on Mr Pecksniff ’s estate , this request must be considered rather as a polite compliment that a substantial hospitality . It was the finishing ornament of the conversation ; for when he had delivered it , Mr Pecksniff rose and led the way to that hotbed of architectural genius , the two - pair front . ‘
45856	45865	45724	45724	You	1543	’ he said , searching among the papers , ‘
45928	45950	45923	45923	you	1543	’ said Mr Pecksniff , folding his hands , and looking at his young relation with an air of pensive interest , ‘
45967	45979	45959	45959	your	1543	’ But Martin by no means appeared to relish this suggestion . ‘
45983	45988	45959	45959	your	1543	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
46036	46037	46027	46027	you	0	’ ‘
46043	46049	46027	46027	you	0	’ said Martin , doubtfully . ‘
46052	46057	46027	46027	you	0	’ said that gentleman . ‘
46062	46108	46110	46111	Mr Pecksniff	218	’re ambitious , and are a very neat draughtsman , you shall -- ha ha!--you shall try your hand on these proposals for a grammar - school ; regulating your plan , of course , by the printed particulars . Upon my word , now , ’
46115	46201	46203	46204	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I shall be very curious to see what you make of the grammar - school . Who knows but a young man of your taste might hit upon something , impracticable and unlikely in itself , but which I could put into shape ? For it really is , my dear Martin , it really is in the finishing touches alone , that great experience and long study in these matters tell . Ha , ha , ha ! Now it really will be , ’
46218	46235	46214	46214	his	218	‘ an amusement to me , to see what you make of the grammar - school . ’
46379	46392	46394	46395	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ When your mind requires to be refreshed by change of occupation , ’
46397	46519	46521	46522	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Thomas Pinch will instruct you in the art of surveying the back garden , or in ascertaining the dead level of the road between this house and the finger - post , or in any other practical and pleasing pursuit . There are a cart - load of loose bricks , and a score or two of old flower - pots , in the back yard . If you could pile them up my dear Martin , into any form which would remind me on my return say of St. Peter ’s at Rome , or the Mosque of St. Sophia at Constantinople , it would be at once improving to you and agreeable to my feelings . And now , ’
46527	46564	46565	46565	Martin	221	‘ to drop , for the present , our professional relations and advert to private matters , I shall be glad to talk with you in my own room , while I pack up my portmanteau . ’
46846	46852	46854	46854	Tom	249	‘ I was almost afraid , ’
46881	47015	46868	46868	he	249	‘ that I should n’t have had time to write it , and that would have been a thousand pities ; postage from such a distance being a serious consideration , when one ’s not rich . She will be glad to see my hand , poor girl , and to hear that Pecksniff is as kind as ever . I would have asked John Westlock to call and see her , and tell her all about me by word of mouth , but I was afraid he might speak against Pecksniff to her , and make her uneasy . Besides , they are particular people where she is , and it might have rendered her situation uncomfortable if she had had a visit from a young man like John . Poor Ruth ! ’
47045	47047	47033	47033	he	249	‘ I ’m
47219	47223	47210	47210	he	9471	’ said Tom ; ‘
47236	47312	47210	47210	he	9471	’ In truth , the new pupil , not at all disconcerted by the honour of having Miss Mercy Pecksniff on his arm , or by the affectionate adieux of that young lady , approached as Mr Pinch spoke , followed by Miss Charity and Mr Pecksniff . As the coach appeared at the same moment , Tom lost no time in entreating the gentleman last mentioned , to undertake the delivery of his letter . ‘
47315	47325	47210	47210	he	9471	’ said Mr Pecksniff , glancing at the superscription . ‘
47362	47621	47359	47360	Mr Pinch	221	’ He made the promise with so much condescension and patronage , that Tom felt he had asked a great deal ( this had not occurred to his mind before ) , and thanked him earnestly . The Miss Pecksniffs , according to a custom they had , were amused beyond description at the mention of Mr Pinch ’s sister . Oh the fright ! The bare idea of a Miss Pinch ! Good heavens ! Tom was greatly pleased to see them so merry , for he took it as a token of their favour , and good - humoured regard . Therefore he laughed too and rubbed his hands and wished them a pleasant journey and safe return , and was quite brisk . Even when the coach had rolled away with the olive - branches in the boot and the family of doves inside , he stood waving his hand and bowing ; so much gratified by the unusually courteous demeanour of the young ladies , that he was quite regardless , for the moment , of Martin Chuzzlewit , who stood leaning thoughtfully against the finger - post , and who after disposing of his fair charge had hardly lifted his eyes from the ground . The perfect silence which ensued upon the bustle and departure of the coach , together with the sharp air of the wintry afternoon , roused them both at the same time . They turned , as by mutual consent , and moved off arm - in - arm . ‘
47627	47631	47359	47360	Mr Pinch	221	’ said Tom ; ‘
47637	47638	47359	47360	Mr Pinch	221	’ ‘
47644	47648	47359	47360	Mr Pinch	221	’ said Martin . ‘
47675	47682	47674	47674	I	0	’m out of spirits , Pinch . ’
47683	47686	47688	47688	Tom	249	‘ Well , ’
47690	47734	47688	47688	Tom	249	‘ now do you know I am in capital spirits today , and scarcely ever felt more disposed to be good company . It was a very kind thing in your predecessor , John , to write to me , was it not ? ’
47735	47740	47742	47742	Martin	221	‘ Why , yes , ’
47745	47768	47742	47742	Martin	221	‘ I should have thought he would have had enough to do to enjoy himself , without thinking of you , Pinch . ’
47769	47780	47781	47781	Tom	249	‘ Just what I felt to be so very likely , ’
47784	47820	47781	47781	Tom	249	‘ but no , he keeps his word , and says , “ My dear Pinch , I often think of you , ” and all sorts of kind and considerate things of that description . ’
47821	47832	47834	47834	Martin	221	‘ He must be a devilish good - natured fellow , ’
47839	47850	47834	47834	Martin	221	‘ because he ca n’t mean that , you know . ’
47851	47861	47863	47863	Tom	249	‘ I do n’t suppose he can , eh ? ’
47873	47884	47863	47863	Tom	249	‘ He says so to please me , you think ? ’
47885	47892	47894	47894	Martin	221	‘ Why , is it likely , ’
47900	47960	47894	47894	Martin	221	‘ that a young man newly escaped from this kennel of a place , and fresh to all the delights of being his own master in London , can have much leisure or inclination to think favourably of anything or anybody he has left behind him here ? I put it to you , Pinch , is it natural ? ’
47999	48006	48007	48007	Martin	221	‘ Of course I know best , ’
48010	48017	48019	48020	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Yes , I feel that , ’
48023	48028	48019	48020	Mr Pinch	221	‘ I said so . ’
48619	48624	48626	48626	Tom	249	‘ That ’s right , ’
48631	48639	48626	48626	Tom	249	‘ Cheer up ! That ’s capital ! ’
48661	48674	48626	48626	Tom	249	‘ I never saw such a fellow as you are , Pinch . ’
48675	48681	48683	48683	Tom	249	‘ Did n’t you though ? ’
48685	48719	48683	48683	Tom	249	‘ Well , it ’s very likely you do find me strange , because I have hardly seen anything of the world , and you have seen a good deal I dare say ? ’
48720	48729	48731	48731	Martin	221	‘ Pretty well for my time of life , ’
48751	48772	48683	48683	Tom	249	‘ Deuce take it , I must talk openly to somebody . I ’ll talk openly to you , Pinch . ’
48773	48776	48778	48778	Tom	249	‘ Do ! ’
48780	48792	48778	48778	Tom	249	‘ I shall take it as being very friendly of you , ’
48793	48795	48683	48683	Tom	249	‘ I ’m
48804	48827	48683	48683	Tom	249	’ inquired Martin , glancing down at Mr Pinch , who was by this time looking at the fire over his leg . ‘
48832	48836	48837	48837	You	1615	’ cried Tom . ‘
48850	48871	48837	48837	You	1615	’ said Martin , beginning with a kind of effort , as if the revelation were not agreeable to him ; ‘
48930	48931	48933	48934	your father	1616	’ ‘
48936	48945	48933	48934	your father	1616	’ inquired Mr Pinch , with open eyes . ‘
48964	48965	48953	48954	no parents	1618	’ ‘
48970	48989	48991	48991	me	0	’ said Tom , touching the young man ’s hand with his own and timidly withdrawing it again . ‘
48993	48994	48991	48991	me	0	’ ‘
49006	49027	49004	49004	Pinch	249	’ pursued the other , stirring the fire again , and speaking in his rapid , off - hand way ; ‘
49053	49091	49092	49092	em	880	’re dead , if you have ever known anything of them . But as I never did know anything about mine personally , you know , why , I ca n’t be expected to be very sentimental about ‘
49104	49130	49095	49095	I	0	’ Mr Pinch was just then looking thoughtfully at the bars . But on his companion pausing in this place , he started , and said ‘
49141	49146	49148	49148	Martin	221	‘ In a word , ’
49150	49245	49148	49148	Martin	221	‘ I have been bred and reared all my life by this grandfather of whom I have just spoken . Now , he has a great many good points -- there is no doubt about that ; I ’ll not disguise the fact from you -- but he has two very great faults , which are the staple of his bad side . In the first place , he has the most confirmed obstinacy of character you ever met with in any human creature . In the second , he is most abominably selfish . ’
49246	49251	49253	49253	Tom	249	‘ Is he indeed ? ’
49255	49261	49263	49264	the other	934	‘ In those two respects , ’
49266	49352	49263	49264	the other	934	‘ there never was such a man . I have often heard from those who know , that they have been , time out of mind , the failings of our family ; and I believe there ’s some truth in it . But I ca n’t say of my own knowledge . All I have to do , you know , is to be very thankful that they have n’t descended to me , and , to be very careful that I do n’t contract ‘
49355	49356	49263	49264	the other	934	’ ‘
49361	49366	49263	49264	the other	934	’ said Mr Pinch . ‘

49376	49395	49399	49399	him	1623	’ resumed Martin , stirring the fire once more , and drawing his chair still closer to it , ‘
49535	49571	49575	49575	you	864	’ he stammered here , and was rather at a loss . Mr Pinch being about the worst man in the world to help anybody out of a difficulty of this sort , said nothing . ‘
49579	49585	49575	49575	you	864	’ resumed Martin , quickly , ‘
49622	49634	49635	49635	I	0	’ Mr Pinch looked up into his face with increased interest . ‘

49855	49859	49815	49815	her	1628	’ Tom answered . ‘
49873	49884	49866	49866	SHE	1628	’ he added , glancing at Martin ’s handsome face . ‘
49892	49901	49866	49866	SHE	1628	’ he rejoined , with a slight frown ; ‘
49943	49944	49935	49935	Her	1628	’ ‘
49950	49954	49935	49935	Her	1628	’ said Tom . ‘
49958	49978	49935	49935	Her	1628	’ and , in his great satisfaction , he took a long sip out of his wine - glass . ‘
49992	49996	49997	49997	I	0	’ pursued Martin , ‘
50131	50151	50152	50152	You	1635	’ Mr Pinch opened his eyes wider , and looked at the fire harder than he had done yet . ‘
50157	50161	50181	50181	Interview	301	’ said Martin , ‘
50276	50277	50314	50315	a fellow	1643	’ ‘
50280	50312	50314	50315	a fellow	1643	’ suggested Tom in perfect good faith . But the suggestion was not so well received as he had expected ; for the young man immediately rejoined , with some irritation , ‘
50321	50322	50319	50319	Pinch	249	’ ‘
50328	50332	50319	50319	Pinch	249	’ said Tom , ‘
50340	50341	50335	50335	you	221	’ ‘
50349	50353	50342	50342	I	0	’ he rejoined . ‘
50395	50396	50376	50376	you	221	’ ‘
50399	50411	50376	50376	you	221	’ cried Tom , screwing up his mouth , and nodding . ‘
50419	50420	50416	50416	I	0	’ ‘
50425	50429	50416	50416	I	0	’ pursued Martin , ‘
50455	50456	50472	50472	he	1644	’ ‘
50461	50465	50472	50472	he	1644	’ said Tom . ‘
50484	50485	50477	50477	I	0	’ ‘
50490	50494	50477	50477	I	0	’ said Tom . ‘
50498	50545	50546	50547	Mr Pinch	221	’ rejoined Martin , throwing himself back in his chair , with a careless wave of both hands , as if the subject were quite settled , and nothing more could be said about it--‘There is an end of the matter , and here am I ! ’
50589	50600	50586	50586	he	221	‘ Pecksniff , of course , you had known before ? ’
50601	50714	50586	50586	he	221	‘ Only by name . No , I had never seen him , for my grandfather kept not only himself but me , aloof from all his relations . But our separation took place in a town in the adjoining country . From that place I came to Salisbury , and there I saw Pecksniff ’s advertisement , which I answered , having always had some natural taste , I believe , in the matters to which it referred , and thinking it might suit me . As soon as I found it to be his , I was doubly bent on coming to him if possible , on account of his being-- ’
50715	50721	50723	50723	Tom	249	‘ Such an excellent man , ’
50729	50739	50723	50723	Tom	249	‘ so he is . You were quite right . ’
50740	50757	50759	50759	Martin	221	‘ Why , not so much on that account , if the truth must be spoken , ’
50761	50898	50759	50759	Martin	221	‘ as because my grandfather has an inveterate dislike to him , and after the old man ’s arbitrary treatment of me , I had a natural desire to run as directly counter to all his opinions as I could . Well ! As I said before , here I am . My engagement with the young lady I have been telling you about is likely to be a tolerably long one ; for neither her prospects nor mine are very bright ; and of course I shall not think of marrying until I am well able to do so . It would never do , you know , for me to be plunging myself into poverty and shabbiness and love in one room up three pair of stairs , and all that sort of thing . ’
50899	50906	50908	50909	Tom Pinch	249	‘ To say nothing of her , ’
50916	50920	50922	50922	Martin	221	‘ Exactly so , ’
50938	51004	50922	50922	Martin	221	‘ To say nothing of her . At the same time , of course it ’s not very hard upon her to be obliged to yield to the necessity of the case ; first , because she loves me very much ; and secondly , because I have sacrificed a great deal on her account , and might have done much better , you know . ’
51014	51017	51012	51012	Tom	249	‘ Certainly ; ’
51040	51055	51057	51057	Martin	221	‘ Now , there is one odd coincidence connected with this love - story , ’
51059	51089	51057	51057	Martin	221	‘ which brings it to an end . You remember what you told me last night as we were coming here , about your pretty visitor in the church ? ’
51090	51095	51097	51097	Tom	249	‘ Surely I do , ’
51125	51128	51119	51119	he	249	‘ Undoubtedly . ’
51129	51134	51097	51097	Tom	249	‘ That was she . ’
51135	51145	51147	51147	Tom	249	‘ I knew what you were going to say , ’
51159	51167	51147	51147	Tom	249	‘ You do n’t tell me so ? ’
51168	51173	51175	51177	the young man	9590	‘ That was she , ’
51179	51224	51175	51177	the young man	9590	‘ After what I have heard from Pecksniff , I have no doubt that she came and went with my grandfather.--Don’t you drink too much of that sour wine , or you ’ll have a fit of some sort , Pinch , I see . ’
51225	51236	51238	51238	Tom	249	‘ It is not very wholesome , I am afraid , ’
51252	51261	51262	51262	Martin	221	‘ So that was she , was it ? ’
51430	51438	51440	51440	Tom	249	‘ All will be well in time , ’
51442	51508	51510	51510	Tom	249	‘ I have no doubt ; and some trial and adversity just now will only serve to make you more attached to each other in better days . I have always read that the truth is so , and I have a feeling within me , which tells me how natural and right it is that it should be . That never ran smooth yet , ’
51537	51627	51521	51521	his	249	‘ what never ran smooth yet , can hardly be expected to change its character for us ; so we must take it as we find it , and fashion it into the very best shape we can , by patience and good - humour . I have no power at all ; I need n’t tell you that ; but I have an excellent will ; and if I could ever be of use to you , in any way whatever , how very glad I should be ! ’
51628	51632	51634	51634	Martin	221	‘ Thank you , ’
51640	51642	51634	51634	Martin	221	‘ You ’re
51661	51681	51658	51658	you	1655	’ he added , after a moment ’s pause , as he drew his chair towards the fire again , ‘
51754	51755	51744	51744	Pinch	249	’ ‘
51761	51767	51744	51744	Pinch	249	’ said Tom , gently . ‘
51814	51815	51793	51793	I	0	’ ‘
51820	51824	51793	51793	I	0	’ demanded Tom . ‘
51829	51830	51793	51793	I	0	’ ‘
51836	51847	51831	51831	I	0	’ cried Tom , catching up the candle with enthusiasm . ‘
51873	51874	51871	51871	Shakespeare	302	’ ‘
51877	51887	51888	51888	He	302	’ replied his friend , yawning and stretching himself . ‘
51948	51949	51935	51935	You	1655	’ ‘
51954	51958	51964	51964	you	1655	’ cried Tom . ‘
52003	52004	51998	51998	you	1655	’ ‘
52012	52015	52007	52007	I	0	’ said Tom ‘
52030	52049	52021	52021	you	1655	’re both in the right humour . Do n’t mind leaving me in the dark . Look sharp ! ’
52122	52131	52132	52132	he	221	‘ Do n’t be too loud , please , ’
52137	52142	52144	52144	Tom	249	‘ No , no , ’
52146	52148	52144	52144	Tom	249	‘ You ’re
52151	52154	52132	52132	he	221	’re not cold ’
52155	52160	52162	52162	Tom	249	‘ Not at all ! ’
52164	52172	52162	52162	Tom	249	‘ I am quite ready , then . ’
52220	52224	52226	52226	Tom	249	‘ Poor fellow ! ’
52247	52280	52231	52231	he	249	‘ He is very young to have so much trouble . How trustful and generous in him to bestow all this confidence in me . And that was she , was it ? ’
52364	52397	52345	52346	Martin Chuzzlewit	221	‘ Why , it ’s nearly out , I declare ! No wonder I dreamed of being frozen . Do call for some coals . What a fellow you are , Pinch ! ’
52818	52828	52830	52831	the head	1672	‘ I am not industrious myself , gents both , ’
52833	52980	52830	52831	the head	1672	‘ but I know how to appreciate that quality in others . I wish I may turn grey and ugly , if it is n’t in my opinion , next to genius , one of the very charmingest qualities of the human mind . Upon my soul , I am grateful to my friend Pecksniff for helping me to the contemplation of such a delicious picture as you present . You remind me of Whittington , afterwards thrice Lord Mayor of London . I give you my unsullied word of honour , that you very strongly remind me of that historical character . You are a pair of Whittingtons , gents , without the cat ; which is a most agreeable and blessed exception to me , for I am not attached to the feline species . My name is Tigg ; how do you do ? ’
53012	53016	53018	53019	Mr Tigg	261	‘ Chevy Slyme ? ’
53033	53065	53018	53019	Mr Tigg	261	‘ You will understand me when I say that I am the accredited agent of Chevy Slyme ; that I am the ambassador from the court of Chiv ? Ha ha ! ’
53066	53069	53071	53071	Martin	221	‘ Heyday ! ’
53083	53093	53071	53071	Martin	221	‘ Pray , what does he want with me ? ’
53094	53103	53018	53019	Mr Tigg	261	‘ If your name is Pinch’--Mr Tigg began . ‘
53107	53114	53071	53071	Martin	221	’ said Martin , checking himself . ‘
53120	53121	53117	53118	Mr Pinch	221	’ ‘
53128	53147	53148	53148	he	221	’ cried Tigg , kissing his hand again , and beginning to follow his head into the room , ‘
53234	53235	53237	53237	you	221	’ ‘
53239	53243	53237	53237	you	221	’ said Tom . ‘
53249	53250	53244	53244	I	0	’ ‘
53256	53261	53244	53244	I	0	’ Mr Tigg rejoined . ‘
53264	53288	53289	53289	I	0	’ he added , shielding his lips with the palm of his hand , and applying them close to Mr Pinch ’s ear , ‘
53296	53297	53289	53289	I	0	’ ‘
53302	53308	53289	53289	I	0	’ said Tom , aloud . ‘
53312	53313	53289	53289	I	0	’ ‘
53317	53328	53289	53289	I	0	’ whispered Tigg in the same cautious manner as before , ‘
53345	53346	53347	53347	He	218	’ ‘
53356	53360	53361	53361	Hush	305	’ said Tom . ‘
53363	53368	53361	53361	Hush	305	’ cried the other . ‘
53394	53395	53384	53384	Pecksniff	218	’ ‘
53399	53405	53384	53384	Pecksniff	218	’ cried Tom quite scared . ‘
53409	53618	53384	53384	Pecksniff	218	’ said Mr Tigg . With which he rapped Tom twice or thrice upon the breast and nodded several times , as though he would say that he saw they understood each other ; that it was unnecessary to mention the circumstance before a third person ; and that he would take it as a particular favour if Tom would slip the amount into his hand , as quietly as possible . Mr Pinch , however , was so very much astounded by this ( to him ) inexplicable deportment , that he at once openly declared there must be some mistake , and that he had been entrusted with no commission whatever having any reference to Mr Tigg or to his friend , either . Mr Tigg received this declaration with a grave request that Mr Pinch would have the goodness to make it again ; and on Tom ’s repeating it in a still more emphatic and unmistakable manner , checked it off , sentence for sentence , by nodding his head solemnly at the end of each . When it had come to a close for the second time , Mr Tigg sat himself down in a chair and addressed the young men as follows : ‘
53786	53791	53802	53802	I	0	’ said Mr Tigg , ‘
53859	53896	53902	53903	gents both	1693	’ Martin and Mr Pinch looked , first at each other , and afterwards at Mr Tigg , who with his arms folded on his breast surveyed them , half in despondency and half in bitterness . ‘
53905	53915	53902	53903	gents both	1693	’ he said , stretching forth his right hand . ‘
54026	54040	54023	54024	gents both	1693	’ said Mr Tigg with a passionate flourish of his hands and head , ‘
54083	54084	54085	54085	I	0	’ ‘
54094	54101	54090	54090	I	0	’ said Tom after a pause , ‘
54152	54153	54149	54150	your friend	9169	’ ‘
54166	54171	54191	54191	Pecksniff	218	’ said Mr Tigg ; ‘
54202	54299	54301	54301	you	0	’ Tom thought of reminding the gentleman ( who , no doubt , in his agitation had forgotten it ) that there was a post - office in the land ; and that possibly if he wrote to some friend or agent for a remittance it might not be lost upon the road ; or at all events that the chance , however desperate , was worth trusting to . But , as his good - nature presently suggested to him certain reasons for abstaining from this hint , he paused again , and then asked : ‘
54312	54313	54301	54301	you	0	’ ‘
54317	54324	54325	54325	You	0	’ said Mr Tigg , rising . ‘
54338	54339	54325	54325	You	0	’ ‘
54343	54347	54325	54325	You	0	’ said Tom . ‘
54351	54360	54361	54361	You	0	’ said Mr Tigg , lifting the sash . ‘
54375	54376	54361	54361	You	0	’ ‘
54382	54386	54361	54361	You	0	’ cried Tom . ‘
54392	54393	54389	54390	Mark Tapley	222	’ ‘
54399	54404	54394	54395	Mark Tapley	222	’ said the gentleman . ‘
54439	54448	54437	54437	sir	864	’ added Mr Tigg , stroking his moustache , ‘
54477	54543	54468	54469	Mrs Tapley	307	’ Mr Pinch was not so dismayed by this terrible threat , but that he had voice enough to call to Mark to come in , and upstairs ; a summons which he so speedily obeyed , that almost as soon as Tom and Mr Tigg had drawn in their heads and closed the window again , he , the denounced , appeared before them . ‘
54549	54554	54547	54547	Mark	222	’ said Mr Pinch . ‘
54570	54571	54572	54573	What gentleman	9188	’ ‘
54577	54581	54575	54575	sir	864	’ said Mark . ‘
54598	54627	54635	54635	Tom	249	’ to whom he made a rough kind of bow--‘and there ’s nothing wrong between Mrs Lupin and either of you , Mr Pinch , I am sure . ’
54628	54633	54635	54635	Tom	249	‘ Nonsense , Mark ! ’
54637	54641	54635	54635	Tom	249	‘ You see Mr-- ’
54642	54645	54647	54648	that gentleman	921	‘ Tigg , ’
54650	54666	54647	54648	that gentleman	921	‘ Wait a bit . I shall crush him soon . All in good time ! ’
54667	54671	54673	54673	Mark	222	‘ Oh HIM ! ’
54682	54709	54673	54673	Mark	222	‘ Yes , I see HIM . I could see him a little better , if he ’d shave himself , and get his hair cut . ’
54728	54734	54736	54736	Mark	222	‘ It ’s no use , ’
54738	54773	54736	54736	Mark	222	‘ If you knock ever so much in that quarter , you ’ll get no answer . I know better . There ’s nothing there but padding ; and a greasy sort it is . ’
54774	54779	54781	54782	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Nay , Mark , ’
54789	54798	54781	54782	Mr Pinch	221	‘ tell me what I ask you . You ’re
54807	54808	54813	54813	sir	864	’ ‘
54815	54823	54827	54827	sir	864	’ cried Mark , with a grin ; ‘
54913	54989	54900	54901	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ em double prices for being a disgrace to the Dragon . That ’s my opinion . I would n’t have any such Peter the Wild Boy as him in my house , sir , not if I was paid race - week prices for it . He ’s enough to turn the very beer in the casks sour with his looks ; he is ! So he would , if it had judgment enough . ’
54990	54992	54998	54998	you	1720	‘ You ’re
55003	55008	55001	55001	Mark	222	’ observed Mr Pinch . ‘
55013	55017	55011	55011	sir	864	’ said Mark , ‘
55114	55151	55169	55169	I.	1728	‘ em ; and all the men was made to be ordered about by him . This not being aggravation enough , he says this morning to me , in his usual captivating way , “ We ’re
55228	55298	55300	55301	Mr Tapley	309	’re very kind to honour us so far , but as we do n’t know any particular good of you , and you do n’t travel with luggage , and Mr Pecksniff an’t at home ( which perhaps you may n’t happen to be aware of , sir ) , we should prefer something more satisfactory ; ” and that ’s where the matter stands . And I ask , ’
55316	55341	55313	55313	his	261	‘ any lady or gentleman , possessing ordinary strength of mind , to say whether he ’s a disagreeable - looking chap or not ! ’
55342	55347	55349	55349	Martin	221	‘ Let me inquire , ’
55367	55377	55349	55349	Martin	221	‘ what the amount of this debt may be ? ’
55378	55389	55391	55391	Mark	222	‘ In point of money , sir , very little , ’
55393	55409	55391	55391	Mark	222	‘ Only just turned of three pounds . But it an’t that ; it ’s the-- ’
55410	55421	55423	55423	Martin	221	‘ Yes , yes , you told us so before , ’
55425	55433	55423	55423	Martin	221	‘ Pinch , a word with you . ’
55434	55439	55441	55441	Tom	249	‘ What is it ? ’
55453	55524	55525	55525	Tom	249	‘ Why , simply -- I am ashamed to say -- that this Mr Slyme is a relation of mine , of whom I never heard anything pleasant ; and that I do n’t want him here just now , and think he would be cheaply got rid of , perhaps , for three or four pounds . You have n’t enough money to pay this bill , I suppose ? ’
55541	55589	55527	55527	his	249	‘ That ’s unfortunate , for I am poor too ; and in case you had had it , I ’d have borrowed it of you . But if we told this landlady we would see her paid , I suppose that would answer the same purpose ? ’
55590	55596	55598	55598	Tom	249	‘ Oh dear , yes ! ’
55600	55608	55598	55598	Tom	249	‘ She knows me , bless you ! ’
55609	55658	55659	55660	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Then let us go down at once and tell her so ; for the sooner we are rid of their company the better . As you have conducted the conversation with this gentleman hitherto , perhaps you ’ll tell him what we purpose doing ; will you ? ’
56312	56315	56317	56318	Mr Tigg	261	‘ Chiv , ’
56326	56365	56317	56318	Mr Tigg	261	‘ my friend Pecksniff not being at home , I have arranged our trifling piece of business with Mr Pinch and friend . Mr Pinch and friend , Mr Chevy Slyme ! Chiv , Mr Pinch and friend ! ’

56605	56617	56619	56620	Mr Slyme	257	‘ Obliged to two strangers for a tavern bill , eh ! ’
56630	56678	56619	56620	Mr Slyme	257	‘ Very pretty ! And crowds of impostors , the while , becoming famous ; men who are no more on a level with me than -- Tigg , I take you to witness that I am the most persecuted hound on the face of the earth . ’
56758	56765	56767	56768	Mr Slyme	257	‘ Ha , ha , ha , ’
56770	56828	56767	56768	Mr Slyme	257	‘ Obliged to two strangers for a tavern bill ! Yet I think I ’ve a rich uncle , Tigg , who could buy up the uncles of fifty strangers ! Have I , or have I not ? I come of a good family , I believe ! Do I , or do I not ? I ’m

56941	56980	56981	56981	I	0	’ Mr Tigg was quite lost in admiration of this noble trait in his friend ’s character ; as he made known to Mr Pinch in a neat little ballet of action , spontaneously invented for the purpose . ‘
56984	56996	56998	56999	Chevy Slyme	257	‘ em know , and I ’ll let all men know , ’
57001	57004	56998	56999	Chevy Slyme	257	‘ that I ’m

57053	57058	57051	57051	Chiv	265	’ murmured Mr Tigg , ‘

57174	57328	57141	57141	I	0	’ He might have added that he hated two sorts of men ; all those who did him favours , and all those who were better off than himself ; as in either case their position was an insult to a man of his stupendous merits . But he did not ; for with the apt closing words above recited , Mr Slyme ; of too haughty a stomach to work , to beg , to borrow , or to steal ; yet mean enough to be worked or borrowed , begged or stolen for , by any catspaw that would serve his turn ; too insolent to lick the hand that fed him in his need , yet cur enough to bite and tear it in the dark ; with these apt closing words Mr Slyme fell forward with his head upon the table , and so declined into a sodden sleep . ‘
57333	57353	57141	57141	I	0	’ cried Mr Tigg , joining the young men at the door , and shutting it carefully behind him , ‘
57456	57488	57489	57489	You	0	’ Mr Pinch was about to contest this latter position with his usual mildness , when , observing that his companion had already gone downstairs , he prepared to follow him . ‘
57497	57501	57494	57495	Mr Pinch	221	’ said Tigg . ‘
57505	57509	57503	57503	you	0	’ answered Tom . ‘

57536	57543	57533	57534	Mr Pinch	221	’ said Tigg , following him . ‘

57584	57627	57628	57628	You	221	’ So he accompanied Mr Tigg to the retreat in question ; on arriving at which place that gentleman took from his hat what seemed to be the fossil remains of an antediluvian pocket - handkerchief , and wiped his eyes therewith . ‘
57636	57641	57628	57628	You	221	’ said Mr Tigg , ‘

57746	57779	57738	57738	You	221	’ Tom had certain ideas of his own upon the subject of glory ; and consequently he was not quite so much excited by this picture as Mr Tigg could have desired . ‘
57784	57789	57790	57793	The school - boy	1789	’ said that gentleman . ‘
57844	57845	57837	57837	you	221	’ ‘
57849	57854	57837	57837	you	221	’ said Mr Pinch . ‘

57876	57885	57872	57872	I	0	’ answered Tom , after a little hesitation . ‘
57893	57904	57886	57886	I	0	’ cried Mr Tigg , detaining him with both hands , ‘
58078	58129	58069	58069	you	221	’ Mr Pinch took from his pocket an old - fashioned red - leather purse with a steel clasp , which had probably once belonged to his deceased grandmother . It held one half - sovereign and no more . All Tom ’s worldly wealth until next quarter - day . ‘
58132	58144	58145	58145	I	0	’ cried Mr Tigg , who had watched this proceeding keenly . ‘
58187	58188	58176	58177	Mr Pinch	221	’ ‘
58194	58198	58199	58199	You	221	’ said Tom . ‘

58237	58254	58231	58232	Seth Pecksniff	313	’ repeated Mr Tigg , taking an exact note of it with a stump of pencil . ‘

58272	58276	58226	58226	Esquire	312	’ observed Tom . ‘
58291	58296	58226	58226	Esquire	312	’ said Mr Tigg . ‘
58317	58318	58311	58311	we	1804	’ ‘
58327	58331	58320	58320	you	221	’ said Tom , ‘
58337	58486	58334	58334	we	1804	’ Mr Tigg added this condition to his memorandum ; read the entry over to himself with a severe frown ; and that the transaction might be the more correct and business - like , appended his initials to the whole . That done , he assured Mr Pinch that everything was now perfectly regular ; and , after squeezing his hand with great fervour , departed . Tom entertained enough suspicion that Martin might possibly turn this interview into a jest , to render him desirous to avoid the company of that young gentleman for the present . With this view he took a few turns up and down the skittle - ground , and did not re - enter the house until Mr Tigg and his friend had quitted it , and the new pupil and Mark were watching their departure from one of the windows . ‘
58504	58514	58487	58487	I	0	’ observed Mark , pointing after their late guests , ‘

58554	58558	58552	58552	Mark	222	’ replied Tom . ‘

58586	58590	58584	58584	sir	864	’ said Mark . ‘

58612	58617	58600	58600	I	0	’ cried Mr Pinch , ‘

58733	58751	58826	58827	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Perhaps you might come out rather too strong for a serious family ’s taste , Mark . ’
58752	58818	58826	58827	Mr Pinch	221	‘ That ’s possible , sir . If I could get into a wicked family , I might do myself justice ; but the difficulty is to make sure of one ’s ground , because a young man ca n’t very well advertise that he wants a place , and wages an’t so much an object as a wicked sitivation ; can he , sir ? ’
58819	58824	58826	58827	Mr Pinch	221	‘ Why , no , ’
58829	58837	58826	58827	Mr Pinch	221	‘ I do n’t think he can . ’
58838	58843	58845	58845	Mark	222	‘ An envious family , ’
58852	58936	58845	58845	Mark	222	‘ or a quarrelsome family , or a malicious family , or even a good out - and - out mean family , would open a field of action as I might do something in . The man as would have suited me of all other men was that old gentleman as was took ill here , for he really was a trying customer . Howsever , I must wait and see what turns up , sir ; and hope for the worst . ’
58937	58945	58947	58948	Mr Pinch	221	‘ You are determined to go then ? ’
58950	58965	58947	58948	Mr Pinch	221	‘ My box is gone already , sir , by the waggon , and I ’m

Mr Pinch imparting to his new friend , as they went , such further particulars of Mark Tapley ’s whimsical restlessness as the reader is already acquainted with . In the meantime Mark , having a shrewd notion that his mistress was in very low spirits , and that he could not exactly answer for the consequences of any lengthened TETE - A - TETE in the bar , kept himself obstinately out of her way all the afternoon and evening . In this piece of generalship he was very much assisted by the great influx of company into the taproom ; for the news of his intention having gone abroad , there was a perfect throng there all the evening , and much drinking of healths and clinking of mugs . At length the house was closed for the night ; and there being now no help for it , Mark put the best face he could upon the matter , and walked doggedly to the bar - door . ‘
59207	59213	59202	59202	I	0	’ said Mark to himself , ‘
59215	59222	58989	58989	I	0	’m done . I feel that I ’m

59236	59250	59230	59230	You	0	’ said Mrs Lupin . Aye , Mark said : There he was . ‘

59290	59301	59287	59287	I	0	’ pursued the landlady , with a most engaging hesitation , ‘

59319	59323	59316	59316	I	0	’ said Mark . ‘
59326	59344	59347	59347	he	222	’ pursued the hostess -- and it really was not an unnatural inquiry--‘why do you desert it ? ’
59514	59522	59524	59524	Mark	222	‘ Why , I tell you what , ’
59620	59650	59617	59617	I	0	’ cried Mr Tapley , shaking his head expressively enough , and looking ( in a momentary state of forgetfulness ) rather hard at the hostess ’s ripe lips . ‘
59661	59687	59652	59653	no man	8938	’ Mrs Lupin said he amazed her . She was astonished how he could say such things . She had never thought it of him . ‘
59699	59715	59716	59716	I	0	’ said Mark , raising his eyebrows with a look of the merriest possible surprise . ‘
59771	59788	59790	59790	I	0	’ he added this in a grave tone , to prevent the possibility of any mistake , ‘
59791	59804	59790	59790	I	0	’m not a - going to make no love , you know . ’
59846	59852	59853	59853	she	9069	‘ Oh , very good ! ’
59856	59875	59853	59853	she	9069	‘ if there is to be no love - making , you had better take your arm away . ’
59876	59883	59885	59885	Mark	222	‘ Lord , why should I ! ’
59887	59893	59885	59885	Mark	222	‘ It ’s quite innocent . ’
59894	59901	59903	59904	the hostess	9135	‘ Of course it ’s innocent , ’
59906	59914	59903	59904	the hostess	9135	‘ or I should n’t allow it . ’
59915	59919	59921	59921	Mark	222	‘ Very well ! ’
59923	59929	59921	59921	Mark	222	‘ Then let it be . ’
59974	59984	59986	59986	Mark	222	‘ Ha ha ! I almost think I am ! ’
59988	60006	59986	59986	Mark	222	‘ though I never thought so before . Why , I can say anything to - night ! ’
60007	60011	59971	59971	she	9069	‘ Say what you ’re
60023	60028	60016	60016	you	222	’ returned the landlady , ‘

60542	60588	60593	60593	she	1849	’ She laughed again at this compliment ; and , once more shaking him by both hands , and bidding him , if he should ever want a friend , to remember her , turned gayly from the little bar and up the Dragon staircase . ‘
60596	60602	60593	60593	she	1849	’ said Mark , listening , ‘
60636	60720	60721	60723	Good - b’ye	251	’ With that piece of comfort , very ruefully uttered , he went , in anything but a jolly manner , to bed . He rose early next morning , and was a - foot soon after sunrise . But it was of no use ; the whole place was up to see Mark Tapley off ; the boys , the dogs , the children , the old men , the busy people and the idlers ; there they were , all calling out ‘
60727	60771	60725	60725	Mark	222	’ after their own manner , and all sorry he was going . Somehow he had a kind of sense that his old mistress was peeping from her chamber - window , but he could n’t make up his mind to look back . ‘
60782	60810	60813	60813	them	1851	’ cried Mark , waving his hat on the top of his walking - stick , as he strode at a quick pace up the little street . ‘

For as Mr Pecksniff justly observed -- when he and his daughters had burrowed their feet deep in the straw , wrapped themselves to the chin , and pulled up both windows -- it is always satisfactory to feel , in keen weather , that many other people are not as warm as you are . And this , he said , was quite natural , and a very beautiful arrangement ; not confined to coaches , but extending itself into many social ramifications . ‘
61105	61111	60940	60942	Good - b’ye	315	’ ( he observed ) , ‘
61164	61189	61299	61299	coaches	9877	’ said Mr Pecksniff with tears in his eyes , as he shook his fist at a beggar who wanted to get up behind , ‘
61201	61287	61299	61299	coaches	9877	’ His children heard with becoming reverence these moral precepts from the lips of their father , and signified their acquiescence in the same , by smiles . That he might the better feed and cherish that sacred flame of gratitude in his breast , Mr Pecksniff remarked that he would trouble his eldest daughter , even in this early stage of their journey , for the brandy - bottle . And from the narrow neck of that stone vessel he imbibed a copious refreshment . ‘
61292	61297	61299	61299	coaches	9877	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
61307	61312	61314	61314	Charity	241	‘ Goodness , Pa ! ’

61332	61355	61326	61327	her parent	8905	‘ are slow coaches ; some of us are fast coaches . Our passions are the horses ; and rampant animals too-- ! ’
61356	61361	61364	61365	the daughters	1869	‘ Really , Pa , ’
61369	61374	61326	61327	her parent	8905	‘ How very unpleasant . ’
61375	61380	61390	61390	he	218	‘ And rampant animals too ’
61428	61591	61421	61421	we	1863	’ When he had said this , Mr Pecksniff , being exhausted , took some further refreshment . When he had done that , he corked the bottle tight , with the air of a man who had effectually corked the subject also ; and went to sleep for three stages . The tendency of mankind when it falls asleep in coaches , is to wake up cross ; to find its legs in its way ; and its corns an aggravation . Mr Pecksniff not being exempt from the common lot of humanity found himself , at the end of his nap , so decidedly the victim of these infirmities , that he had an irresistible inclination to visit them upon his daughters ; which he had already begun to do in the shape of divers random kicks , and other unexpected motions of his shoes , when the coach stopped , and after a short delay the door was opened . ‘
61595	61605	61606	61606	I	0	’ said a thin sharp voice in the dark . ‘

61671	61676	61668	61669	Three passengers	1876	’ returned the guard . ‘

61755	61767	61704	61704	I	0	’ whispered the old man , when they moved on again . ‘
61801	61892	61784	61784	he	1880	’ Whether it occurred to the dutiful son that he had in some degree over - reached himself by contributing to the prolongation of his father ’s days ; or whether the cold had effected his temper ; is doubtful . But he gave his father such a nudge in reply , that that good old gentleman was taken with a cough which lasted for full five minutes without intermission , and goaded Mr Pecksniff to that pitch of irritation , that he said at last -- and very suddenly : ‘
61916	61917	61918	61918	Mine	0	’ ‘
61920	61932	61918	61918	Mine	0	’ said the old man , after a moment ’s pause , ‘
61940	61986	61987	61987	Hem	272	’ The voice and manner , together , now that he spoke out ; the composure of the speaker ; the presence of his son ; and his knowledge of Mr Pecksniff ; afforded a clue to his identity which it was impossible to mistake . ‘
61992	62003	61989	61989	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , returning to his usual mildness , ‘
62075	62082	62069	62069	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , cuttingly ; ‘
62090	62091	62087	62088	a Brute	1893	’ ‘
62096	62102	62087	62088	a Brute	1893	’ said the old man . ‘

62203	62204	62192	62192	you	218	’ ‘

62277	62283	62269	62269	I	0	’ said the old man , ‘
62339	62345	62338	62338	You	219	’re not offended , Pecksniff ? ’
62346	62353	62355	62356	that gentleman	921	‘ Offended , my good sir ! ’
62371	62381	62383	62384	the son	9376	‘ Are you travelling to London , Mr Pecksniff ? ’
62386	62413	62383	62384	the son	9376	‘ Yes , Mr Jonas , we are travelling to London . We shall have the pleasure of your company all the way , I trust ? ’
62414	62426	62428	62428	Jonas	219	‘ Oh ! ecod , you had better ask father that , ’
62430	62441	62428	62428	Jonas	219	‘ I am not a - going to commit myself . ’
62583	62610	62580	62580	he	219	‘ That if it was all the same to him , he would turn him over to father , and have a chat with the gals ; ’

62879	62888	62890	62891	Mr Jonas	219	‘ Lots of beaux in London , cousin ! ’
62898	62903	62905	62907	the young lady	8949	‘ Indeed , sir ! ’
62909	62922	62905	62907	the young lady	8949	‘ They wo n’t hurt us , sir , I dare say . ’
62955	62958	62960	62963	that more prudent damsel	1927	‘ Merry , ’
62965	62984	62960	62963	that more prudent damsel	1927	‘ really I am ashamed of you . How can you go on so ? You wild thing ! ’
62997	63009	63011	63012	Mr Jonas	219	‘ I saw a wildness in her eye , t’other day , ’
63017	63020	63021	63025	the one to sit solemn	1928	‘ But you ’re

63047	63055	63030	63030	You	317	’ cried Merry , in a whisper . ‘
63086	63118	63081	63081	I	0	’ To prevent which fatal consequence , the buoyant creature skipped out of her seat as she spoke , and squeezed her sister into the place from which she had risen . ‘
63125	63130	63081	63081	I	0	’ cried Mr Jonas . ‘
63146	63147	63144	63144	cousin	9914	’ ‘
63155	63159	63144	63144	cousin	9914	’ said Charity . ‘
63170	63175	63176	63176	she	1934	’ said Mr Jonas ; ‘
63220	63221	63212	63213	my father	9140	’ ‘
63227	63228	63224	63225	Mr Jonas	219	’ ‘
63240	63246	63235	63235	you	219	’ said the young gentleman . ‘
63256	63278	63250	63250	you	219	’ Mr Pecksniff hesitating to perform this friendly office , Mr Jonas did it himself ; at the same time crying : ‘
63308	63325	63300	63300	you	9911	’ he asked his neighbour , with characteristic gallantry , as he dropped his voice again . ‘
63328	63332	63300	63300	you	9911	’ answered Charity . ‘
63336	63337	63338	63340	The other one	1940	’ ‘
63342	63351	63338	63340	The other one	1940	’ said Mr Jonas , after a pause . ‘
63359	63360	63361	63361	I	0	’ ‘
63366	63370	63361	63361	I	0	’ replied Charity . ‘
63377	63378	63379	63379	She	1940	’ ‘
63383	63387	63379	63379	She	1940	’ said Jonas ; ‘
63407	63414	63406	63406	You	0	’re the sensible one , cousin ! ’
63415	63420	63422	63422	Charity	241	‘ Tut , tut ! ’
63424	63436	63422	63422	Charity	241	‘ Oh ! But you are ! You know you are ! ’
63437	63444	63446	63447	Miss Charity	241	‘ Mercy is a little giddy , ’
63457	63458	63450	63450	she	1940	’ ‘
63475	63480	63450	63450	she	1940	’ rejoined her cousin . ‘
63487	63488	63450	63450	she	1940	’ ‘
63496	63575	63576	63578	the other one	1940	’ said Charity . But she took it notwithstanding ; and after one or two remarks on the extreme heaviness of the coach , and the number of places it stopped at , they fell into a silence which remained unbroken by any member of the party until supper - time . Although Mr Jonas conducted Charity to the hotel and sat himself beside her at the board , it was pretty clear that he had an eye to ‘
63579	63878	63576	63578	the other one	1940	’ also , for he often glanced across at Mercy , and seemed to draw comparisons between the personal appearance of the two , which were not unfavourable to the superior plumpness of the younger sister . He allowed himself no great leisure for this kind of observation , however , being busily engaged with the supper , which , as he whispered in his fair companion ’s ear , was a contract business , and therefore the more she ate , the better the bargain was . His father and Mr Pecksniff , probably acting on the same wise principle , demolished everything that came within their reach , and by that means acquired a greasy expression of countenance , indicating contentment , if not repletion , which it was very pleasant to contemplate . When they could eat no more , Mr Pecksniff and Mr Jonas subscribed for two sixpenny - worths of hot brandy - and - water , which the latter gentleman considered a more politic order than one shillingsworth ; there being a chance of their getting more spirit out of the innkeeper under this arrangement than if it were all in one glass . Having swallowed his share of the enlivening fluid , Mr Pecksniff , under pretence of going to see if the coach were ready , went secretly to the bar , and had his own little bottle filled , in order that he might refresh himself at leisure in the dark coach without being observed . These arrangements concluded , and the coach being ready , they got into their old places and jogged on again . But before he composed himself for a nap , Mr Pecksniff delivered a kind of grace after meat , in these words : ‘
63979	63987	63965	63965	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff with exquisite tenderness , ‘
64016	64586	64010	64011	a Benefactor	1945	’ As nothing could be added to this , nothing was said ; and Mr Pecksniff , exulting , it may be presumed , in his moral utility , went to sleep again . The rest of the night wore away in the usual manner . Mr Pecksniff and Old Anthony kept tumbling against each other and waking up much terrified , or crushed their heads in opposite corners of the coach and strangely tattooed the surface of their faces -- Heaven knows how -- in their sleep . The coach stopped and went on , and went on and stopped , times out of number . Passengers got up and passengers got down , and fresh horses came and went and came again , with scarcely any interval between each team as it seemed to those who were dozing , and with a gap of a whole night between every one as it seemed to those who were broad awake . At length they began to jolt and rumble over horribly uneven stones , and Mr Pecksniff looking out of window said it was to - morrow morning , and they were there . Very soon afterwards the coach stopped at the office in the city ; and the street in which it was situated was already in a bustle , that fully bore out Mr Pecksniff ’s words about its being morning , though for any signs of day yet appearing in the sky it might have been midnight . There was a dense fog too ; as if it were a city in the clouds , which they had been travelling to all night up a magic beanstalk ; and there was a thick crust upon the pavement like oilcake ; which , one of the outsides ( mad , no doubt ) said to another ( his keeper , of course ) , was Snow . Taking a confused leave of Anthony and his son , and leaving the luggage of himself and daughters at the office to be called for afterwards , Mr Pecksniff , with one of the young ladies under each arm , dived across the street , and then across other streets , and so up the queerest courts , and down the strangest alleys and under the blindest archways , in a kind of frenzy ; now skipping over a kennel , now running for his life from a coach and horses ; now thinking he had lost his way , now thinking he had found it ; now in a state of the highest confidence , now despondent to the last degree , but always in a great perspiration and flurry ; until at length they stopped in a kind of paved yard near the Monument . That is to say , Mr Pecksniff told them so ; for as to anything they could see of the Monument , or anything else but the buildings close at hand , they might as well have been playing blindman ’s buff at Salisbury . Mr Pecksniff looked about him for a moment , and then knocked at the door of a very dingy edifice , even among the choice collection of dingy edifices at hand ; on the front of which was a little oval board like a tea - tray , with this inscription--‘Commercial Boarding - House : M. Todgers . ’
64697	64705	64707	64708	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Still a - bed my man ? ’
64710	64716	64718	64719	the boy	1949	‘ Still a - bed ! ’
64721	64732	64718	64719	the boy	1949	‘ I wish they wos still a - bed . They ’re
64773	64841	64770	64770	you	1949	’ Considering his years , which were tender , the youth may be said to have preferred this question sternly , and in something of a defiant manner . But Mr Pecksniff , without taking umbrage at his bearing put a card in his hand , and bade him take that upstairs , and show them in the meanwhile into a room where there was a fire . ‘
64852	64857	64862	64862	myself	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
64864	65030	65032	65033	the other	934	’ So he led his daughters , without waiting for any further introduction , into a room on the ground - floor , where a table - cloth ( rather a tight and scanty fit in reference to the table it covered ) was already spread for breakfast ; displaying a mighty dish of pink boiled beef ; an instance of that particular style of loaf which is known to housekeepers as a slack - baked , crummy quartern ; a liberal provision of cups and saucers ; and the usual appendages . Inside the fender were some half - dozen pairs of shoes and boots , of various sizes , just cleaned and turned with the soles upwards to dry ; and a pair of short black gaiters , on one of which was chalked -- in sport , it would appear , by some gentleman who had slipped down for the purpose , pending his toilet , and gone up again--‘Jinkins ’s Particular , ’
65132	65139	65549	65550	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ would n’t be driven away . ’
65543	65547	65549	65550	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Mr Pecksniff ! ’
65552	65585	65603	65604	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Welcome to London ! Who would have thought of such a visit as this , after so -- dear , dear!--so many years ! How do you DO , Mr Pecksniff ? ’
65586	65602	65603	65604	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ As well as ever ; and as glad to see you , as ever ; ’
65608	65620	65631	65632	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Why , you are younger than you used to be ! ’
65621	65629	65631	65632	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ YOU are , I am sure ! ’
65634	65636	65631	65632	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ You ’re
65642	65643	65646	65646	you	320	’ ‘
65651	65665	65646	65646	you	320	’ cried Mr Pecksniff , stretching out his hand towards the young ladies . ‘
65673	65674	65696	65697	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ ‘
65679	65691	65720	65721	My daughters	1217	’ exclaimed the lady , raising her hands and clasping them . ‘
65706	65719	65723	65724	Mrs Todgers	322	’ Mr Pecksniff smiled complacently ; shook his head ; and said , ‘
65730	65731	65723	65724	Mrs Todgers	322	’ ‘
65734	65740	65760	65760	em	1217	’ sighed the good lady , ‘
65751	65759	65770	65771	your Pa	1985	‘ em I think I should have known ‘
65776	65817	65770	65771	your Pa	1985	’ She hugged them both ; and being by this time overpowered by her feelings or the inclemency of the morning , jerked a little pocket handkerchief out of the little basket , and applied the same to her face . ‘
65824	65829	65859	65859	you	243	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
65875	65876	65859	65859	you	243	’ ‘
65879	65885	65890	65890	I	0	’ cried Mrs Todgers ecstatically . ‘
65888	65889	65890	65890	I	0	’ ‘
65902	65907	65937	65938	Dear girls	1993	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘
65935	65936	65937	65938	Dear girls	1993	’ ‘
65940	65945	66061	66061	I	0	’ said Mrs Todgers . ‘
65954	66060	66061	66061	I	0	’ Mrs Todgers meant by this that she must embrace them once more , which she accordingly did with great ardour . But the truth was that the house being full with the exception of one bed , which would now be occupied by Mr Pecksniff , she wanted time for consideration ; and so much time too ( for it was a knotty point how to dispose of them ) , that even when this second embrace was over , she stood for some moments gazing at the sisters , with affection beaming in one eye , and calculation shining out of the other . ‘
66070	66078	66094	66094	you	1993	’ said Mrs Todgers , at length . ‘
66098	66301	66094	66094	you	1993	’ Thereupon she embraced them once more , observing that she could not decide which was most like their poor mother ( which was highly probable , seeing that she had never beheld that lady ) , but that she rather thought the youngest was ; and then she said that as the gentlemen would be down directly , and the ladies were fatigued with travelling , would they step into her room at once ? It was on the same floor ; being , in fact , the back parlour ; and had , as Mrs Todgers said , the great advantage ( in London ) of not being overlooked ; as they would see when the fog cleared off . Nor was this a vainglorious boast , for it commanded at a perspective of two feet , a brown wall with a black cistern on the top . The sleeping apartment designed for the young ladies was approached from this chamber by a mightily convenient little door , which would only open when fallen against by a strong person . It commanded from a similar point of sight another angle of the wall , and another side of the cistern . ‘
66307	66312	66315	66316	Mr Jinkins	321	’ said Mrs Todgers . ‘
66319	66419	66420	66420	I	0	’ In the first of these sanctuaries a fire was speedily kindled by the youthful porter , who , whistling at his work in the absence of Mrs Todgers ( not to mention his sketching figures on his corduroys with burnt firewood ) , and being afterwards taken by that lady in the fact , was dismissed with a box on his ears . Having prepared breakfast for the young ladies with her own hands , she withdrew to preside in the other room ; where the joke at Mr Jinkins ’s expense seemed to be proceeding rather noisily . ‘
66430	66441	66448	66448	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , looking in at the door , ‘
66450	66451	66460	66460	Pa	242	’ ‘
66462	66466	66460	66460	Pa	242	’ cried Merry . ‘
66472	66482	66448	66448	I	0	’ said Cherry . ( Both very miserably . ) ‘
66485	66490	66460	66460	Pa	242	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
66518	66552	66460	66460	Pa	242	’ Whether Mr Pecksniff ’s business in London was as strictly professional as he had given his new pupil to understand , we shall see , to adopt that worthy man ’s phraseology , ‘
66558	66564	66870	66870	Todgers	322	’ CHAPTER NINE TOWN AND TODGER ’S
66883	67477	68734	68735	Mrs Todgers	322	’ walk of it . Cautious emigrants from Scotland or the North of England had been known to reach it safely , by impressing a charity - boy , town - bred , and bringing him along with them ; or by clinging tenaciously to the postman ; but these were rare exceptions , and only went to prove the rule that Todgers ’s was in a labyrinth , whereof the mystery was known but to a chosen few . Several fruit - brokers had their marts near Todgers ’s ; and one of the first impressions wrought upon the stranger ’s senses was of oranges -- of damaged oranges -- with blue and green bruises on them , festering in boxes , or mouldering away in cellars . All day long , a stream of porters from the wharves beside the river , each bearing on his back a bursting chest of oranges , poured slowly through the narrow passages ; while underneath the archway by the public - house , the knots of those who rested and regaled within , were piled from morning until night . Strange solitary pumps were found near Todgers ’s hiding themselves for the most part in blind alleys , and keeping company with fire - ladders . There were churches also by dozens , with many a ghostly little churchyard , all overgrown with such straggling vegetation as springs up spontaneously from damp , and graves , and rubbish . In some of these dingy resting - places which bore much the same analogy to green churchyards , as the pots of earth for mignonette and wall - flower in the windows overlooking them did to rustic gardens , there were trees ; tall trees ; still putting forth their leaves in each succeeding year , with such a languishing remembrance of their kind ( so one might fancy , looking on their sickly boughs ) as birds in cages have of theirs . Here , paralysed old watchmen guarded the bodies of the dead at night , year after year , until at last they joined that solemn brotherhood ; and , saving that they slept below the ground a sounder sleep than even they had ever known above it , and were shut up in another kind of box , their condition can hardly be said to have undergone any material change when they , in turn , were watched themselves . Among the narrow thoroughfares at hand , there lingered , here and there , an ancient doorway of carved oak , from which , of old , the sounds of revelry and feasting often came ; but now these mansions , only used for storehouses , were dark and dull , and , being filled with wool , and cotton , and the like -- such heavy merchandise as stifles sound and stops the throat of echo -- had an air of palpable deadness about them which , added to their silence and desertion , made them very grim . In like manner , there were gloomy courtyards in these parts , into which few but belated wayfarers ever strayed , and where vast bags and packs of goods , upward or downward bound , were for ever dangling between heaven and earth from lofty cranes There were more trucks near Todgers ’s than you would suppose whole city could ever need ; not active trucks , but a vagabond race , for ever lounging in the narrow lanes before their masters ’
68717	68732	68763	68763	She	322	‘ Your pa was once a little particular in his attentions , my dears , ’
68737	68762	68810	68813	the two Miss Pecksniffs	870	‘ but to be your ma was too much happiness denied me . You ’d hardly know who this was done for , perhaps ? ’
68801	68808	68824	68825	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ It ’s a speaking likeness ! ’
68815	68822	68828	68828	herself	322	‘ It was considered so once , ’
68837	68851	68878	68878	they	2087	‘ but I hardly thought you would have known it , my loves . ’
68882	68889	68912	68913	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Good gracious ! Mrs Todgers ! ’
68890	68910	68912	68913	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Presiding over an establishment like this , makes sad havoc with the features , my dear Miss Pecksniffs , ’
68915	68936	68878	68878	they	2087	‘ The gravy alone , is enough to add twenty years to one ’s age , I do assure you . ’

69424	69455	69418	69418	her	2116	’ Mrs Todgers laughed immensely at the dear love ’s humour , and declared she was quite afraid of her , that she was . She was so very severe . ‘
69460	69468	69480	69480	I	0	’ cried a voice at the door . ‘
69483	69497	69503	69504	Mrs Todgers	322	’ And then Mr Pecksniff peeped smilingly into the room , and said , ‘
69506	69574	69587	69587	you	218	’ Mrs Todgers almost screamed , for the little door of communication between that room and the inner one being wide open , there was a full disclosure of the sofa bedstead in all its monstrous impropriety . But she had the presence of mind to close this portal in the twinkling of an eye ; and having done so , said , though not without confusion , ‘
69590	69591	69594	69594	we	2118	’ ‘
69599	69606	69631	69633	Poor Thomas Pinch	249	’ said Mr Pecksniff , jocosely , ‘
69635	69636	69638	69638	we	2118	’ ‘
69641	69653	69673	69674	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ returned Mrs Todgers , nodding her head with mysterious intelligence , ‘
69676	69677	69679	69680	Mr Jinkins	321	’ ‘
69688	69722	69724	69725	Mr Jinkins	321	’ asked Mr Pecksniff , putting one arm round Mercy , and the other round Mrs Todgers , whom he seemed , in the abstraction of the moment , to mistake for Charity . ‘
69728	69729	69731	69731	he	321	’ ‘
69748	69755	69760	69760	sir	864	’ said Mrs Todgers , playfully . ‘
69762	69763	69766	69770	a man of superior talents	2124	’ ‘
69772	69777	69811	69812	Mrs Todgers	322	’ observed Mr Pecksniff . ‘
69814	69815	69811	69812	Mrs Todgers	322	’ ‘
69819	69824	69836	69837	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ returned that lady , ‘
69849	70099	70413	70414	the footman	2147	’ With these words she gently eluded Mr Pecksniff ’s grasp , and took Miss Charity into her own embrace ; though whether she was impelled to this proceeding solely by the irrepressible affection she had conceived for that young lady , or whether it had any reference to a lowering , not to say distinctly spiteful expression which had been visible in her face for some moments , has never been exactly ascertained . Be this as it may , Mr Pecksniff went on to inform his daughters of the purport and history of the round - robin aforesaid , which was in brief , that the commercial gentlemen who helped to make up the sum and substance of that noun of multitude signifying many , called Todgers ’s , desired the honour of their presence at the general table , so long as they remained in the house , and besought that they would grace the board at dinner - time next day , the same being Sunday . He further said , that Mrs Todgers being a consenting party to this invitation , he was willing , for his part , to accept it ; and so left them that he might write his gracious answer , the while they armed themselves with their best bonnets for the utter defeat and overthrow of Miss Pinch . Tom Pinch ’s sister was governess in a family , a lofty family ; perhaps the wealthiest brass and copper founders ’
70405	70411	70474	70475	Miss Pinch	298	‘ Visitors for Miss Pinch ! ’
70467	70473	70808	70809	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Visitors for Miss Pinch ! ’
70797	70806	70808	70809	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Do n’t be alarmed , Miss Pinch , ’
70827	70860	70869	70869	he	2161	‘ I have called to see you , in pursuance of a promise given to your brother , Thomas Pinch . My name -- compose yourself , Miss Pinch -- is Pecksniff . ’
70874	70949	71016	71018	the sharp pupil	2164	‘ You see in me , young person , the benefactor of your race ; the patron of your house ; the preserver of your brother , who is fed with manna daily from my table ; and in right of whom there is a considerable balance in my favour at present standing in the books beyond the sky . But I have no pride , for I can afford to do without it ! ’
71006	71014	71016	71018	the sharp pupil	2164	‘ Oh very well , Miss Pinch ! ’
71020	71034	71042	71043	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ crying before strangers , as if you did n’t like the situation ! ’
71035	71040	71042	71043	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Thomas is well , ’
71045	71103	71116	71117	Tom Pinch	249	‘ and sends his love and this letter . I can not say , poor fellow , that he will ever be distinguished in our profession ; but he has the will to do well , which is the next thing to having the power ; and , therefore , we must bear with him . Eh ? ’
71104	71114	71162	71162	she	2120	‘ I know he has the will , sir , ’
71121	71161	71162	71162	she	2120	‘ and I know how kindly and considerately you cherish it , for which neither he nor I can ever be grateful enough , as we very often say in writing to each other . The young ladies too , ’
71172	71182	71189	71190	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I know how much we owe to them . ’
71183	71187	71189	71190	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ My dears , ’
71199	71216	71231	71231	Cherry	241	‘ Thomas ’s sister is saying something you will be glad to hear , I think . ’
71217	71229	71247	71247	they	2166	‘ We ca n’t take any merit to ourselves , papa ! ’
71258	71295	71306	71307	the pupil	1445	‘ Mr Pinch ’s being so well provided for is owing to you alone , and we can only say how glad we are to hear that he is as grateful as he ought to be . ’
71296	71304	71306	71307	the pupil	1445	‘ Oh very well , Miss Pinch ! ’
71310	71323	71334	71337	Tom Pinch ’s sister	2120	‘ Got a grateful brother , living on other people ’s kindness ! ’
71324	71332	71334	71335	Tom Pinch	249	‘ It was very kind of you , ’
71350	71399	71412	71413	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ to come here ; very kind indeed ; though how great a kindness you have done me in gratifying my wish to see you , and to thank you with my own lips , you , who make so light of benefits conferred , can scarcely think . ’
71400	71410	71424	71425	Ruth Pinch	325	‘ Very grateful ; very pleasant ; very proper , ’
71415	71422	71535	71535	Tom	249	‘ It makes me happy too , ’
71470	71533	71535	71535	Tom	249	‘ very happy to think that you will be able to tell him how more than comfortably I am situated here , and how unnecessary it is that he should ever waste a regret on my being cast upon my own resources . Dear me ! So long as I heard that he was happy , and he heard that I was , ’
71539	71569	71599	71600	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ we could both bear , without one impatient or complaining thought , a great deal more than ever we have had to endure , I am very certain . ’
71594	71597	71599	71600	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Ah ! ’
71612	71626	71639	71641	that frosty innocent	2174	‘ certainly . And how do YOU do , my very interesting child ? ’
71627	71637	71654	71655	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Quite well , I thank you , sir , ’
71643	71652	71654	71655	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ A sweet face this , my dears , ’
71662	71667	71732	71734	that good woman	2180	‘ A charming manner ! ’
71718	71730	71732	71734	that good woman	2180	‘ She wanted but a pair of wings , a dear , ’
71736	71751	71753	71753	you	2181	‘ to be a young syrup’--meaning , possibly , young sylph , or seraph . ‘
71767	71779	71794	71794	pa	8971	’ said Mr Pecksniff , producing one of his professional cards , ‘
71788	71789	71794	71794	pa	8971	’ ‘
71796	71800	71794	71794	pa	8971	’ said Merry . ‘
71808	71813	71937	71937	Missis	326	’ added Mr Pecksniff ; ‘
71935	71936	71937	71937	Missis	326	’ ‘
71944	71962	71937	71937	Missis	326	’ said the footman , suddenly appearing , and speaking in exactly the same key as before , ‘
71979	71980	71937	71937	Missis	326	’ ‘
71983	71988	72012	72012	My	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
72025	72049	72012	72012	My	0	’ Some confusion was occasioned for an instant by Mrs Todgers ’s unstrapping her little flat hand - basket , and hurriedly entrusting the ‘
72052	72182	72213	72214	Miss Pinch	298	’ with one of her own cards , which , in addition to certain detailed information relative to the terms of the commercial establishment , bore a foot - note to the effect that M. T. took that opportunity of thanking those gentlemen who had honoured her with their favours , and begged they would have the goodness , if satisfied with the table , to recommend her to their friends . But Mr Pecksniff , with admirable presence of mind , recovered this document , and buttoned it up in his own pocket . Then he said to Miss Pinch -- with more condescension and kindness than ever , for it was desirable the footman should expressly understand that they were not friends of hers , but patrons : ‘
72216	72217	72213	72214	Miss Pinch	298	’ ‘
72221	72228	72213	72214	Miss Pinch	298	’ said Tom ’s sister heartily ; ‘
72233	72234	72213	72214	Miss Pinch	298	’ ‘
72239	72250	72213	72214	Miss Pinch	298	’ he retorted , patting her gently on the head . ‘
72275	72296	72321	72321	you	8989	’ said Mr Pecksniff , looking in his pensive mood hard at the footman , as if he meant him , ‘
72324	72474	72476	72476	you	2202	’ They were not quite ready yet , for they were still caressing the pupil . But they tore themselves away at length ; and sweeping past Miss Pinch with each a haughty inclination of the head and a curtsey strangled in its birth , flounced into the passage . The young man had rather a long job in showing them out ; for Mr Pecksniff ’s delight in the tastefulness of the house was such that he could not help often stopping ( particularly when they were near the parlour door ) and giving it expression , in a loud voice and very learned terms . Indeed , he delivered , between the study and the hall , a familiar exposition of the whole science of architecture as applied to dwelling - houses , and was yet in the freshness of his eloquence when they reached the garden . ‘
72479	72514	72562	72562	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , backing from the steps , with his head on one side and his eyes half - shut that he might the better take in the proportions of the exterior : ‘
72565	72568	72630	72631	Mr Pecksniff	218	’re well ? ’
72619	72628	72630	72631	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I have no doubt , my dears , ’
72643	72672	72640	72640	his	0	‘ that this is the proprietor . I should be glad to know him . It might lead to something . Is he looking this way , Charity ? ’
72673	72681	72689	72690	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ He is opening the window pa ! ’
72682	72687	72689	72690	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Ha , ha ! ’
72693	72701	72730	72731	my dears--	2211	‘ All right ! He has found I ’m
72732	72733	72730	72731	my dears--	2211	’ ‘
72736	72741	72742	72742	Sir	864	’ cried the gentleman . ‘
72747	72757	72758	72758	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , taking off his hat . ‘
72766	72767	72774	72774	you	0	’ ‘
72776	72781	72774	72774	you	0	’ roared the gentleman . ‘
72789	72801	72803	72803	you--	2215	’ said Mr Pecksniff , doubtful of his having heard aright . ‘
72805	72806	72803	72803	you--	2215	’ ‘
72812	72819	72826	72826	sir	864	’ repeated the gentleman , warmly . ‘
72828	72834	72836	72836	you	0	’ Mr Pecksniff smilingly began . ‘
72840	72845	73784	73784	you	2219	’ returned the other , ‘
72880	73782	73784	73784	you	2219	’ With that he clapped down the window again , and disappeared . Mr Pecksniff put on his hat , and walked with great deliberation and in profound silence to the fly , gazing at the clouds as he went , with great interest . After helping his daughters and Mrs Todgers into that conveyance , he stood looking at it for some moments , as if he were not quite certain whether it was a carriage or a temple ; but having settled this point in his mind , he got into his place , spread his hands out on his knees , and smiled upon the three beholders . But his daughters , less tranquil - minded , burst into a torrent of indignation . This came , they said , of cherishing such creatures as the Pinches . This came of lowering themselves to their level . This came of putting themselves in the humiliating position of seeming to know such bold , audacious , cunning , dreadful girls as that . They had expected this . They had predicted it to Mrs Todgers , as she ( Todgers ) could depone , that very morning . To this , they added , that the owner of the house , supposing them to be Miss Pinch ’s friends , had acted , in their opinion , quite correctly , and had done no more than , under such circumstances , might reasonably have been expected . To that they added ( with a trifling inconsistency ) , that he was a brute and a bear ; and then they merged into a flood of tears , which swept away all wandering epithets before it . Perhaps Miss Pinch was scarcely so much to blame in the matter as the Seraph , who , immediately on the withdrawal of the visitors , had hastened to report them at head - quarters , with a full account of their having presumptuously charged her with the delivery of a message afterwards consigned to the footman ; which outrage , taken in conjunction with Mr Pecksniff ’s unobtrusive remarks on the establishment , might possibly have had some share in their dismissal . Poor Miss Pinch , however , had to bear the brunt of it with both parties ; being so severely taken to task by the Seraph ’s mother for having such vulgar acquaintances , that she was fain to retire to her own room in tears , which her natural cheerfulness and submission , and the delight of having seen Mr Pecksniff , and having received a letter from her brother , were at first insufficient to repress . As to Mr Pecksniff , he told them in the fly , that a good action was its own reward ; and rather gave them to understand , that if he could have been kicked in such a cause , he would have liked it all the better . But this was no comfort to the young ladies , who scolded violently the whole way back , and even exhibited , more than once , a keen desire to attack the devoted Mrs Todgers ; on whose personal appearance , but particularly on whose offending card and hand - basket , they were secretly inclined to lay the blame of half their failure . Todgers ’s was in a great bustle that evening , partly owing to some additional domestic preparations for the morrow , and partly to the excitement always inseparable in that house from Saturday night , when every gentleman ’s linen arrived at a different hour in its own little bundle , with his private account pinned on the outside . There was always a great clinking of pattens downstairs , too , until midnight or so , on Saturdays ; together with a frequent gleaming of mysterious lights in the area ; much working at the pump ; and a constant jangling of the iron handle of the pail . Shrill altercations from time to time arose between Mrs Todgers and unknown females in remote back kitchens ; and sounds were occasionally heard , indicative of small articles of iron mongery and hardware being thrown at the boy . It was the custom of that youth on Saturdays , to roll up his shirt sleeves to his shoulders , and pervade all parts of the house in an apron of coarse green baize ; moreover , he was more strongly tempted on Saturdays than on other days ( it being a busy time ) , to make excursive bolts into the neighbouring alleys when he answered the door , and there to play at leap - frog and other sports with vagrant lads , until pursued and brought back by the hair of his head or the lobe of his ear ; thus he was quite a conspicuous feature among the peculiar incidents of the last day in the week at Todgers ’s . He was especially so on this particular Saturday evening , and honoured the Miss Pecksniffs with a deal of notice ; seldom passing the door of Mrs Todgers ’s private room , where they sat alone before the fire , working by the light of a solitary candle , without putting in his head and greeting them with some such compliments as , ‘
73788	73789	73802	73802	he	2220	’ ‘
73797	73801	73802	73802	he	2220	‘ I say , ’
73815	73850	73859	73859	he	2220	‘ young ladies , there ’s soup to - morrow . She ’s a - making it now . An’t she a - putting in the water ? Oh ! not at all neither ! ’
73866	73884	73886	73886	he	2220	‘ I say ! There ’s fowls to - morrow . Not skinny ones . Oh no ! ’
73894	73913	74043	74043	he	2220	‘ There ’s a fish to - morrow . Just come . Do n’t eat none of him ! ’
74060	74066	74082	74082	Mercy	244	‘ rather a spicy sort . ’
74067	74080	74089	74089	Bailey	329	‘ Will it be long , before it ’s ready , Bailey ? ’
74084	74087	74089	74089	Bailey	329	‘ No , ’
74091	74115	74089	74089	Bailey	329	‘ it IS cooked . When I come up , she was dodging among the tender pieces with a fork , and eating of ‘
74118	74161	74089	74089	Bailey	329	’ But he had scarcely achieved the utterance of these words , when he received a manual compliment on the head , which sent him staggering against the wall ; and Mrs Todgers , dish in hand , stood indignantly before him . ‘
74167	74172	74089	74089	Bailey	329	’ said that lady . ‘
74180	74181	74089	74089	Bailey	329	’ ‘
74187	74204	74215	74215	yer	329	’ retorted Bailey , guarding his head , on a principle invented by Mr Thomas Cribb . ‘
74217	74218	74237	74237	I	0	’ ‘
74226	74236	74280	74280	Bailey	329	’ said Mrs Todgers , setting down the dish , ‘
74260	74272	74280	74280	Bailey	329	’m afraid nothing but hanging will ever do him any good . ’
74273	74278	74280	74280	Bailey	329	‘ Wo n’t it ! ’
74282	74306	74317	74318	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Oh ! Yes ! Wot do you go a - lowerin the table - beer for then , and destroying my constitooshun ? ’
74307	74315	74317	74318	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Go downstairs , you vicious boy , ’
74325	74334	74814	74814	Gander	336	‘ Do you hear me ? Go along ! ’

75065	75069	75179	75179	they	9990	‘ Bravo Jink ! ’
75161	75165	75375	75389	the gentleman who had originated the sally about ‘ collars ; ’ which sparkling pleasantry	2275	‘ coming out , ’
75383	75386	75635	75636	Bailey junior	329	‘ collars ; ’

75941	75961	76435	76435	they	9990	‘ they felt now , indeed , that they were in London , and for the first time too . ’
76426	76429	76513	76514	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ No ! ’
76507	76511	76513	76514	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Miss Pecksniff ! ’

76523	76533	76632	76632	She	2314	‘ Oh dear , no more , Mrs Todgers . ’
76657	76666	76799	76799	they	2319	‘ Gentlemen , let us drink the ladies ! ’
76803	76806	76812	76812	He	2318	‘ Father ! ’
76815	76824	77713	77714	the hostess	9135	‘ Mr Pecksniff , and God bless him ! ’
77700	77711	77729	77730	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ And how have they used you downstairs , sir ? ’
77716	77727	77729	77730	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Their conduct has been such , my dear madam , ’
77732	77753	77760	77761	that lady	9988	‘ as I can never think of without emotion , or remember without a tear . Oh , Mrs Todgers ! ’
77754	77758	77760	77761	that lady	9988	‘ My goodness ! ’
77763	77774	77787	77788	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ How low you are in your spirits , sir ! ’
77775	77785	77787	77788	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I am a man , my dear madam , ’
77799	77860	77914	77914	he	218	‘ but I am also a father . I am also a widower . My feelings , Mrs Todgers , will not consent to be entirely smothered , like the young children in the Tower . They are grown up , and the more I press the bolster on them , the more they look round the corner of it . ’
77905	77913	77914	77914	he	218	‘ She was beautiful , Mrs Todgers , ’
77931	77938	77947	77948	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ She had a small property . ’

79581	79590	79640	79640	you	9043	’ said Mr Pecksniff , after a pause . ‘
79643	79667	79970	79970	he	2396	’ said Mr Pecksniff , leaning over the banisters , with an odd recollection of his familiar manner among new pupils at home , ‘
79691	79969	79970	79970	he	2396	’ As it appeared impossible to entertain any reasonable hopes of him after this speech , Mr Jinkins and Mr Gander went upstairs again , and once more got him into bed . But they had not descended to the second floor before he was out again ; nor , when they had repeated the process , had they descended the first flight , before he was out again . In a word , as often as he was shut up in his own room , he darted out afresh , charged with some new moral sentiment , which he continually repeated over the banisters , with extraordinary relish , and an irrepressible desire for the improvement of his fellow creatures that nothing could subdue . Under these circumstances , when they had got him into bed for the thirtieth time or so , Mr Jinkins held him , while his companion went downstairs in search of Bailey junior , with whom he presently returned . That youth having been apprised of the service required of him , was in great spirits , and brought up a stool , a candle , and his supper ; to the end that he might keep watch outside the bedroom door with tolerable comfort . When he had completed his arrangements , they locked Mr Pecksniff in , and left the key on the outside ; charging the young page to listen attentively for symptoms of an apoplectic nature , with which the patient might be troubled , and , in case of any such presenting themselves , to summon them without delay . To which Mr Bailey modestly replied that ‘
79996	80404	80484	80484	I	0	’ CHAPTER TEN CONTAINING STRANGE MATTER , ON WHICH MANY EVENTS IN THIS HISTORY MAY , FOR THEIR GOOD OR EVIL INFLUENCE , CHIEFLY DEPEND But Mr Pecksniff came to town on business . Had he forgotten that ? Was he always taking his pleasure with Todgers ’s jovial brood , unmindful of the serious demands , whatever they might be , upon his calm consideration ? No . Time and tide will wait for no man , saith the adage . But all men have to wait for time and tide . That tide which , taken at the flood , would lead Seth Pecksniff on to fortune , was marked down in the table , and about to flow . No idle Pecksniff lingered far inland , unmindful of the changes of the stream ; but there , upon the water ’s edge , over his shoes already , stood the worthy creature , prepared to wallow in the very mud , so that it slid towards the quarter of his hope . The trustfulness of his two fair daughters was beautiful indeed . They had that firm reliance on their parent ’s nature , which taught them to feel certain that in all he did he had his purpose straight and full before him . And that its noble end and object was himself , which almost of necessity included them , they knew . The devotion of these maids was perfect . Their filial confidence was rendered the more touching , by their having no knowledge of their parent ’s real designs , in the present instance . All that they knew of his proceedings was , that every morning , after the early breakfast , he repaired to the post office and inquired for letters . That task performed , his business for the day was over ; and he again relaxed , until the rising of another sun proclaimed the advent of another post . This went on for four or five days . At length , one morning , Mr Pecksniff returned with a breathless rapidity , strange to observe in him , at other times so calm ; and , seeking immediate speech with his daughters , shut himself up with them in private conference for two whole hours . Of all that passed in this period , only the following words of Mr Pecksniff ’s utterance are known : ‘
80487	80571	80943	80943	Your	2401	’ That same day at noon , an old gentleman alighted from a hackney - coach at the post - office , and , giving his name , inquired for a letter addressed to himself , and directed to be left till called for . It had been lying there some days . The superscription was in Mr Pecksniff ’s hand , and it was sealed with Mr Pecksniff ’s seal . It was very short , containing indeed nothing more than an address ‘
80590	80942	81174	81174	his	221	’ The old gentleman tore off the direction -- scattering the rest in fragments to the winds -- and giving it to the coachman , bade him drive as near that place as he could . In pursuance of these instructions he was driven to the Monument ; where he again alighted , and dismissed the vehicle , and walked towards Todgers ’s . Though the face , and form , and gait of this old man , and even his grip of the stout stick on which he leaned , were all expressive of a resolution not easily shaken , and a purpose ( it matters little whether right or wrong , just now ) such as in other days might have survived the rack , and had its strongest life in weakest death ; still there were grains of hesitation in his mind , which made him now avoid the house he sought , and loiter to and fro in a gleam of sunlight , that brightened the little churchyard hard by . There may have been , in the presence of those idle heaps of dust among the busiest stir of life , something to increase his wavering ; but there he walked , awakening the echoes as he paced up and down , until the church clock , striking the quarters for the second time since he had been there , roused him from his meditation . Shaking off his incertitude as the air parted with the sound of the bells , he walked rapidly to the house , and knocked at the door . Mr Pecksniff was seated in the landlady ’s little room , and his visitor found him reading -- by an accident ; he apologised for it -- an excellent theological work . There were cake and wine upon a little table -- by another accident , for which he also apologised . Indeed he said , he had given his visitor up , and was about to partake of that simple refreshment with his children , when he knocked at the door . ‘
80948	81105	81174	81174	his	221	’ said old Martin , laying down his hat and stick . Mr Pecksniff endeavoured to conceal his agitation as a father when he answered Yes , they were . They were good girls , he said , very good . He would not venture to recommend Mr Chuzzlewit to take the easy - chair , or to keep out of the draught from the door . If he made any such suggestion , he would expose himself , he feared , to most unjust suspicion . He would , therefore , content himself with remarking that there was an easy - chair in the room , and that the door was far from being air - tight . This latter imperfection , he might perhaps venture to add , was not uncommonly to be met with in old houses . The old man sat down in the easy - chair , and after a few moments ’
81110	81142	81154	81155	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ In the first place , let me thank you for coming to London so promptly , at my almost unexplained request ; I need scarcely add , at my cost . ’
81143	81152	81171	81171	Martin	221	‘ At YOUR cost , my good sir ! ’
81164	81169	81171	81171	Martin	221	‘ It is not , ’
81178	81199	81209	81210	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ my habit to put my -- well ! my relatives -- to any personal expense to gratify my caprices . ’
81200	81207	81226	81228	the old man	991	‘ Caprices , my good sir ! ’
81211	81224	81226	81228	the old man	991	‘ That is scarcely the proper word either , in this instance , ’
81230	81237	81265	81265	Martin	221	‘ No . You are right . ’
81258	81263	81265	81265	Martin	221	‘ You are right , ’
81267	81304	81312	81313	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ It is not a caprice . It is built up on reason , proof , and cool comparison . Caprices never are . Moreover , I am not a capricious man . I never was . ’
81305	81310	81323	81325	the other quickly	2404	‘ Most assuredly not , ’
81315	81321	81323	81325	the other quickly	2404	‘ How do you know ? ’
81327	81376	81382	81383	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ You are to begin to know it now . You are to test and prove it , in time to come . You and yours are to find that I can be constant , and am not to be diverted from my end . Do you hear ? ’
81377	81380	81392	81392	Martin	221	‘ Perfectly , ’
81385	81391	81392	81392	Martin	221	‘ I very much regret , ’

I very much regret that I laid open to you what were then my thoughts of you , so freely as I did .

I confide in you to be my ally ; to attach yourself to me by ties of Interest and Expectation’--he laid great stress upon these words , though Mr Pecksniff particularly begged him not to mention it ; ‘

82259	82288	82294	82296	the old man	991	‘ Perhaps , my dears , you had better write them down . Your humble autographs are of no value in themselves , but affection may prize them . ’

82298	82337	82343	82344	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ will expend itself on the living originals . Do not trouble yourselves , my girls , I shall not so easily forget you , Charity and Mercy , as to need such tokens of remembrance . Cousin ! ’

82424	82534	82542	82543	his relative	2426	‘ and you mean well ; but I fear you do n’t know what an old man ’s humours are . You do n’t know what it is to be required to court his likings and dislikings ; to adapt yourself to his prejudices ; to do his bidding , be it what it may ; to bear with his distrusts and jealousies ; and always still be zealous in his service . When I remember how numerous these failings are in me , and judge of their occasional enormity by the injurious thoughts I lately entertained of you , I hardly dare to claim you for my friend . ’
82535	82540	82542	82543	his relative	2426	‘ My worthy sir , ’
82545	82605	82611	82612	the other	934	‘ how CAN you talk in such a painful strain !

82641	82674	82690	82691	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ that while we mourned the heaviness of our misfortune in being confounded with the base and mercenary , still we could not wonder at it . My dears , you remember ? ’

82693	82728	82753	82754	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Occasionally we had the presumption to console ourselves with the remark that Truth would in the end prevail , and Virtue be triumphant ; but not often . My loves , you recollect ? ’

82761	82795	82804	82804	Martin	221	‘ in the little , unassuming village where we take the liberty of dwelling , I said you were mistaken in me , my dear sir ; that was all , I think ? ’

82923	83022	83032	83033	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I am sure of it . I said so . It was disinterested too , in you , to draw that herd of harpies off from me , and be their victim yourself ; most other men would have suffered them to display themselves in all their rapacity , and would have striven to rise , by contrast , in my estimation . You felt for me , and drew them off , for which I owe you many thanks . Although I left the place , I know what passed behind my back , you see ! ’

83068	83069	83080	83080	I	0	’ ‘
83074	83079	83080	83080	I	0	’ rejoined the architect , ‘
83083	83084	83085	83085	He	2430	’ ‘
83089	83093	83085	83085	He	2430	’ said Martin . ‘
83099	83109	83124	83124	He	2430	’ asked Mr Pecksniff , with a quavering mildness . ‘
83117	83123	83124	83124	He	2430	’ the old man answered . ‘
83129	83130	83142	83142	I	0	’ ‘
83134	83141	83261	83261	you	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , eagerly . ‘
83203	83258	83261	83261	you	0	’ The old man glanced at both his fair supporters , but especially at Miss Mercy , whom , indeed , he looked full in the face , with a greater demonstration of interest than had yet appeared in his features . His gaze again encountered Mr Pecksniff , as he said , composedly : ‘
83271	83272	83261	83261	you	0	’ ‘
83276	83298	83306	83306	You	0	’ cried Mr Pecksniff , rubbing his hair up very stiff upon his head , and staring wildly at his daughters . ‘
83304	83305	83306	83306	You	0	’ ‘
83311	83314	83348	83348	you	0	’ repeated Martin ‘
83328	83333	83348	83348	you	0	’ cried Mr Pecksniff . ‘
83349	83357	83368	83370	the old man	991	’re not about to tell me that ! ’
83358	83366	83571	83573	the old man	991	‘ I thought he had suppressed it , ’
83557	83569	83571	83573	the old man	991	‘ I am glad to find you second me so warmly , ’
83586	83615	83625	83626	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I will not deny that it is a pleasure to me to find you so full of zeal . We will consider that topic as disposed of . ’
83616	83623	83625	83626	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ No , my dear sir , ’
83628	83644	83652	83654	the old man	991	‘ not as disposed of , until I have purged my house of this pollution . ’
83645	83650	83652	83654	the old man	991	‘ That will follow , ’
83656	83669	83680	83681	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ in its own time . I look upon that as done . ’
83670	83678	83652	83654	the old man	991	‘ You are very good , sir , ’
83687	83705	83714	83714	Martin	221	‘ You do me honour . You MAY look upon it as done , I assure you . ’
83706	83712	83714	83714	Martin	221	‘ There is another topic , ’
83716	83732	83756	83757	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ on which I hope you will assist me . You remember Mary , cousin ? ’
83733	83754	83756	83757	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ The young lady that I mentioned to you , my dears , as having interested me so very much , ’
83759	83767	83777	83779	the old man	991	‘ Excuse my interrupting you , sir . ’
83768	83775	83796	83797	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I told you her history ? ’
83781	83794	83796	83797	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Which I also mentioned , you will recollect , my dears , ’
83799	83814	83823	83823	Martin	221	‘ Silly girls , Mr Chuzzlewit -- quite moved by it , they were ! ’
83815	83821	83823	83823	Martin	221	‘ Why , look now ! ’
83828	83890	83929	83931	the old man	991	‘ I feared I should have had to urge her case upon you , and ask you to regard her favourably for my sake . But I find you have no jealousies ! Well ! You have no cause for any , to be sure . She has nothing to gain from me , my dears , and she knows it . ’
83912	83927	83929	83931	the old man	991	‘ If I could have anticipated what has come to pass between us four , ’
83934	83964	84151	84151	he	275	‘ but it is too late to think of that . You would receive her courteously , young ladies , and be kind to her , if need were ? ’
84160	84174	84185	84186	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ You know what will be said of this ? Have you reflected ? ’
84175	84184	84185	84186	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Said of what , my dear sir ? ’
84189	84197	84244	84246	the old man	991	‘ Of this new understanding between us . ’
84237	84242	84244	84246	the old man	991	‘ A great many , ’
84248	84285	84380	84381	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Some will say that I dote in my old age ; that illness has shaken me ; that I have lost all strength of mind , and have grown childish . You can bear that ? ’
84311	84379	84445	84446	old Martin	221	‘ Others will say -- I speak of disappointed , angry people only -- that you have lied and fawned , and wormed yourself through dirty ways into my favour ; by such concessions and such crooked deeds , such meannesses and vile endurances , as nothing could repay ; no , not the legacy of half the world we live in . You can bear that ? ’
84435	84443	84626	84628	the old man	991	‘ With the great mass of slanderers , ’
84454	84624	84626	84628	the old man	991	‘ the tale , as I clearly foresee , will run thus : That to mark my contempt for the rabble whom I despised , I chose from among them the very worst , and made him do my will , and pampered and enriched him at the cost of all the rest . That , after casting about for the means of a punishment which should rankle in the bosoms of these kites the most , and strike into their gall , I devised this scheme at a time when the last link in the chain of grateful love and duty , that held me to my race , was roughly snapped asunder ; roughly , for I loved him well ; roughly , for I had ever put my trust in his affection ; roughly , for that he broke it when I loved him most -- God help me!--and he without a pang could throw me off , while I clung about his heart ! Now , ’
84643	84674	84683	84683	Pecksniff	218	‘ is your mind made up to bear this likewise ? Lay your account with having it to bear , and put no trust in being set right by me . ’
84675	84681	84683	84683	Pecksniff	218	‘ My dear Mr Chuzzlewit , ’
84688	84798	84804	84804	Martin	221	‘ for such a man as you have shown yourself to be this day ; for a man so injured , yet so very humane ; for a man so -- I am at a loss what precise term to use -- yet at the same time so remarkably -- I do n’t know how to express my meaning ; for such a man as I have described , I hope it is no presumption to say that I , and I am sure I may add my children also ( my dears , we perfectly agree in this , I think ? ) , would bear anything whatever ! ’
84799	84802	84804	84804	Martin	221	‘ Enough , ’
84806	84821	84683	84683	Pecksniff	218	‘ You can charge no consequences on me . When do you retire home ? ’
84822	84839	84847	84849	the old man	991	‘ Whenever you please , my dear sir . To - night if you desire it . ’
84840	84845	84847	84849	the old man	991	‘ I desire nothing , ’
84851	84875	84925	84925	their	914	‘ that is unreasonable . Such a request would be . Will you be ready to return at the end of this week ? ’
84909	84921	84936	84936	Martin	221	‘ Let us be at home on Saturday , dear pa , ’
84928	84934	84936	84936	Martin	221	‘ Your expenses , cousin , ’
84948	85095	85111	85112	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ may possibly exceed that amount . If so , let me know the balance that I owe you , when we next meet . It would be useless if I told you where I live just now ; indeed , I have no fixed abode . When I have , you shall know it . You and your daughters may expect to see me before long ; in the meantime I need not tell you that we keep our own confidence . What you will do when you get home is understood between us . Give me no account of it at any time ; and never refer to it in any way . I ask that as a favour . I am commonly a man of few words , cousin ; and all that need be said just now is said , I think . ’
85096	85109	85111	85112	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ One glass of wine -- one morsel of this homely cake ? ’
85119	85123	85138	85139	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ My dears-- ! ’
85132	85136	85138	85139	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Poor girls ! ’
85141	85192	85201	85203	the old man	991	‘ You will excuse their agitation , my dear sir . They are made up of feeling . A bad commodity to go through the world with , Mr Chuzzlewit ! My youngest daughter is almost as much of a woman as my eldest , is she not , sir ? ’
85193	85199	85214	85215	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Which IS the youngest ? ’
85205	85212	85257	85258	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Mercy , by five years , ’
85217	85255	85257	85258	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ We sometimes venture to consider her rather a fine figure , sir . Speaking as an artist , I may perhaps be permitted to suggest that its outline is graceful and correct . I am naturally , ’
85280	85302	85314	85314	Martin	221	‘ proud , if I may use the expression , to have a daughter who is constructed on the best models . ’
85303	85312	85322	85323	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ She seems to have a lively disposition , ’
85316	85320	85322	85323	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Dear me ! ’
85325	85377	85384	85386	the old man	991	‘ That is quite remarkable . You have defined her character , my dear sir , as correctly as if you had known her from her birth . She HAS a lively disposition . I assure you , my dear sir , that in our unpretending home her gaiety is delightful . ’
85378	85382	85398	85399	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ No doubt , ’
85388	85396	85398	85399	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Charity , upon the other hand , ’
85401	85450	85458	85458	Martin	221	‘ is remarkable for strong sense , and for rather a deep tone of sentiment , if the partiality of a father may be excused in saying so . A wonderful affection between them , my dear sir ! Allow me to drink your health . Bless you ! ’
85451	85456	85458	85458	Martin	221	‘ I little thought , ’
85460	85483	85514	85514	Martin	221	‘ but a month ago , that I should be breaking bread and pouring wine with you . I drink to you . ’
85506	85512	85514	85514	Martin	221	‘ Now let me go , ’
85530	85537	85787	85787	he	218	‘ My dears , good morning ! ’
85768	85786	85787	85787	he	218	‘ If it was possible to divine any cause for this merriment , even the most remote , ’
85790	85811	85927	85943	the young gentleman who had been the youngest gentleman in company on the day of the festival	2478	‘ I should not reprove you . But when you can have none whatever -- oh , really , really ! ’
85915	85925	85956	85956	he	2478	‘ I do n’t care that ! Mrs Todgers , ’
85945	85954	85956	85956	he	2478	‘ I do n’t care THAT , ma’am , ’
85962	85972	85986	85987	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ for Jinkins . Do n’t suppose I do . ’
85973	85984	85986	85987	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ I am quite certain you do n’t , sir , ’
85989	86030	86046	86048	the youngest gentleman	2341	‘ You have too independent a spirit , I know , to yield to anybody . And quite right . There is no reason why you should give way to any gentleman . Everybody must be well aware of that . ’
86031	86044	86046	86048	the youngest gentleman	2341	‘ I should think no more of admitting daylight into the fellow , ’
86055	86063	86122	86124	the youngest gentleman	2341	‘ than if he was a bulldog . ’
86114	86120	86150	86150	he	2341	‘ Let him be careful , ’
86126	86149	86150	86150	he	2341	‘ I give him warning . No man shall step between me and the current of my vengeance . I know a Cove-- ’
86164	86194	86224	86224	I	0	‘ a gentleman of property , I mean -- who practices with a pair of pistols ( fellows too ) of his own . If I am driven to borrow ‘
86217	86223	86311	86311	he	321	’ Again Mrs Todgers moaned . ‘
86231	86279	86286	86286	HIM	321	’ said the youngest gentleman but now my soul rebels against it , and I wo n’t stand it any longer . I left home originally , because I had that within me which would n’t be domineered over by a sister ; and do you think I ’m
86290	86291	86321	86321	he	321	’ ‘
86315	86319	86321	86321	he	321	’ observed Mrs Todgers ‘
86325	86331	86432	86432	I	0	’ cried the youngest gentleman . ‘
86436	86462	86432	86432	I	0	’ The young gentleman was mistaken in this closing sentence , inasmuch as he never told it to Jinkins , but always to Mrs Todgers . ‘
86465	86469	86548	86549	Mrs Todgers	322	’ he said , ‘
86477	86540	86548	86549	Mrs Todgers	322	’ ears . All I ’ve got to say to you , Mrs Todgers , is , a week ’s notice from next Saturday . The same house ca n’t contain that miscreant and me any longer . If we get over the intermediate time without bloodshed , you may think yourself pretty fortunate . I do n’t myself expect we shall . ’
86541	86546	86548	86549	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Dear , dear ! ’
86551	86619	86627	86629	the youngest gentleman	2341	‘ what would I have given to have prevented this ? To lose you , sir , would be like losing the house ’s right - hand . So popular as you are among the gentlemen ; so generally looked up to ; and so much liked ! I do hope you ’ll think better of it ; if on nobody else ’s account , on mine . ’
86620	86625	86627	86629	the youngest gentleman	2341	‘ There ’s Jinkins , ’
86633	86657	86664	86664	I	0	‘ Your favourite . He ’ll console you , and the gentlemen too , for the loss of twenty such as me . I ’m
86669	86670	86679	86679	sir	864	’ ‘
86681	86693	86741	86741	you	864	’ cried Mrs Todgers , with a show of honest indignation . ‘
86742	86749	86741	86741	you	864	’re not understood in this house . ’
86750	86752	86741	86741	you	864	‘ I ’m
86760	86766	86768	86768	you	864	’ said the youngest gentleman . ‘
86776	86786	86809	86809	You	864	’ returned Mrs Todgers , in the same strain . ‘
86823	86829	86809	86809	You	864	’ The young gentleman coughed . ‘
86833	86838	86917	86918	Mr Jinkins	321	’ said Mrs Todgers , ‘
86927	86932	86950	86950	I	0	’ added Mrs Todgers , ‘
86954	87058	87062	87063	Miss Pecksniffs	243	’ The young gentleman was so much mollified by these and similar speeches on the part of Mrs Todgers , that he and that lady gradually changed positions ; so that she became the injured party , and he was understood to be the injurer ; but in a complimentary , not in an offensive sense ; his cruel conduct being attributable to his exalted nature , and to that alone . So , in the end , the young gentleman withdrew his notice , and assured Mrs Todgers of his unalterable regard ; and having done so , went back to business . ‘
87065	87097	87125	87125	you	243	’ cried that lady , as she came into the back room , and sat wearily down , with her basket on her knees , and her hands folded upon it , ‘
87131	87132	87125	87125	you	243	’ ‘
87135	87142	87125	87125	you	243	’ said the two Miss Pecksniffs . ‘
87157	87162	87212	87212	he	321	’ resumed Mrs Todgers , ‘
87229	87285	87298	87300	that young gentleman	1440	’ The young ladies were greatly entertained by Mrs Todgers ’s account , no less than with certain anecdotes illustrative of the youngest gentleman ’s character , which she went on to tell them . But Mr Pecksniff looked quite stern and angry ; and when she had concluded , said in a solemn voice : ‘
87309	87310	87320	87320	he	1440	’ ‘
87328	87333	87320	87320	he	1440	’ said Mrs Todgers . ‘
87339	87344	87320	87320	he	1440	’ repeated Mr Pecksniff . ‘
87357	87382	87435	87435	I	0	’ said Mrs Todgers . Mr Pecksniff rose from his chair , folded his arms , looked at her , and shook his head . ‘
87433	87434	87448	87448	sir	864	’ ‘
87450	87455	87472	87473	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ faltered Mrs Todgers . ‘
87481	87482	87472	87473	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ ‘
87486	87498	87505	87505	You	864	’ cried that gentleman , laying great stress upon the word . ‘
87509	87521	87505	87505	You	864	’ He was so severe , that Mrs Todgers shed tears . ‘
87525	87530	87564	87565	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ repeated Mr pecksniff . ‘
87550	87551	87564	87565	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ ‘
87567	87577	87581	87581	Calf	349	’ cried Mrs Todgers , taking out her handkerchief . ‘
87583	87589	88081	88082	A gentleman	871	’ cried Mr Pecksniff mournfully . ‘
87627	88080	88081	88082	A gentleman	871	’ He was so subdued and overcome by the reflection , that he immediately took down his hat from its peg in the passage , and went out for a walk , to compose his feelings . Anybody passing him in the street might have known him for a good man at first sight ; for his whole figure teemed with a consciousness of the moral homily he had read to Mrs Todgers . Eighteen shillings a week ! Just , most just , thy censure , upright Pecksniff ! Had it been for the sake of a ribbon , star , or garter ; sleeves of lawn , a great man ’s smile , a seat in parliament , a tap upon the shoulder from a courtly sword ; a place , a party , or a thriving lie , or eighteen thousand pounds , or even eighteen hundred;--but to worship the golden calf for eighteen shillings a week ! oh pitiful , pitiful ! CHAPTER ELEVEN WHEREIN A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN BECOMES PARTICULAR IN HIS ATTENTIONS TO A CERTAIN LADY ; AND MORE COMING EVENTS THAN ONE , CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE The family were within two or three days of their departure from Mrs Todgers ’s , and the commercial gentlemen were to a man despondent and not to be comforted , because of the approaching separation , when Bailey junior , at the jocund time of noon , presented himself before Miss Charity Pecksniff , then sitting with her sister in the banquet chamber , hemming six new pocket - handkerchiefs for Mr Jinkins ; and having expressed a hope , preliminary and pious , that he might be blest , gave her in his pleasant way to understand that a visitor attended to pay his respects to her , and was at that moment waiting in the drawing - room . Perhaps this last announcement showed in a more striking point of view than many lengthened speeches could have done , the trustfulness and faith of Bailey ’s nature ; since he had , in fact , last seen the visitor on the door - mat , where , after signifying to him that he would do well to go upstairs , he had left him to the guidance of his own sagacity . Hence it was at least an even chance that the visitor was then wandering on the roof of the house , or vainly seeking to extricate himself from the maze of bedrooms ; Todgers ’s being precisely that kind of establishment in which an unpiloted stranger is pretty sure to find himself in some place where he least expects and least desires to be . ‘
88086	88095	88099	88099	Bailey	329	’ cried Charity , pausing in her work ; ‘
88101	88102	88110	88110	It	2511	’ ‘
88105	88109	88127	88127	I	0	’ said Bailey . ‘
88131	88250	88259	88259	Bailey	329	’ The remark was rendered somewhat obscure in itself , by reason ( as the reader may have observed ) of a redundancy of negatives ; but accompanied by action expressive of a faithful couple walking arm - in - arm towards a parochial church , mutually exchanging looks of love , it clearly signified this youth ’s conviction that the caller ’s purpose was of an amorous tendency . Miss Charity affected to reprove so great a liberty ; but she could not help smiling . He was a strange boy , to be sure . There was always some ground of probability and likelihood mingled with his absurd behaviour . That was the best of it ! ‘
88261	88266	88269	88269	you	329	’ said Miss Pecksniff . ‘
88276	88298	88269	88269	you	329	’ Mr Bailey smiled at the extreme wildness of such a supposition , and regarded the young ladies with unimpaired affability . ‘
88303	88307	88334	88334	you	329	’ said Charity , ‘
88337	88425	88460	88460	you	0	’ The younger sister plainly considered that this appeal had its origin in the pride of being called upon and asked for ; and that it was intended as an assertion of superiority , and a retaliation upon her for having captured the commercial gentlemen . Therefore , she replied , with great affection and politeness , that it was , no doubt , very strange indeed ; and that she was totally at a loss to conceive what the ridiculous person unknown could mean by it . ‘
88431	88439	88448	88448	you	329	’ said Charity , with some sharpness , ‘
88457	88458	88460	88460	you	0	’ ‘
88462	88471	88484	88484	I	0	’ retorted Merry , singing at her needle . ‘

88496	88500	88502	88502	you	0	’ said Cherry . ‘
88508	88516	88586	88586	you	0	’ said Merry , with engaging candour , ‘
88592	88685	88835	88835	cousin	9914	’ This artless inquiry might have led to turbulent results , but for the strong emotions of delight evinced by Bailey junior , whose relish in the turn the conversation had lately taken was so acute , that it impelled and forced him to the instantaneous performance of a dancing step , extremely difficult in its nature , and only to be achieved in a moment of ecstasy , which is commonly called The Frog ’s Hornpipe . A manifestation so lively , brought to their immediate recollection the great virtuous precept , ‘
88693	88832	88835	88835	cousin	9914	’ in which they had been educated . They forbore at once , and jointly signified to Mr Bailey that if he should presume to practice that figure any more in their presence , they would instantly acquaint Mrs Todgers with the fact , and would demand his condign punishment , at the hands of that lady . The young gentleman having expressed the bitterness of his contrition by affecting to wipe away scalding tears with his apron , and afterwards feigning to wring a vast amount of water from that garment , held the door open while Miss Charity passed out ; and so that damsel went in state upstairs to receive her mysterious adorer . By some strange occurrence of favourable circumstances he had found out the drawing - room , and was sitting there alone . ‘
88837	88841	88864	88864	you	9914	’ he said . ‘
88871	88889	88864	88864	you	9914	’ Miss Charity replied that she was quite well , and gave Mr Jonas Chuzzlewit her hand . ‘
88894	88899	88918	88920	the other one	1940	’ said Mr Jonas , ‘
88922	88923	88930	88930	I	0	’ ‘
88933	88939	88953	88953	you	864	’ returned the young lady . ‘

88972	88987	89006	89008	a cruel girl	2524	’ said Mr Jonas , sitting down beside her on the window - seat . ‘

89022	89026	89051	89051	you	864	’ said Cherry , ‘

89075	89079	89082	89082	you	864	’ answered Cherry . ‘
89085	89095	89103	89103	I	0	’ said Jonas , pondering upon this strange reply . ‘

89156	89160	89163	89163	She	2521	’ inquired Jonas . ‘
89171	89175	89185	89185	she	2521	’ answered Charity . ‘
89187	89195	89196	89196	She	2521	’ said Jonas , lowering his voice . ‘
89201	89205	89185	89185	she	2521	’ said Cherry . ‘
89224	89229	89185	89185	she	2521	’ asked Mr Jonas . ‘
89236	89255	89260	89260	I	0	’ said Cherry , with a demureness of manner that gave a very disinterested character to her assent . ‘
89266	89279	89300	89300	you	2527	’ observed Mr Jonas , as he nudged her with his elbow . ‘

89410	89414	89415	89415	I	0	’ said Charity . ‘

89492	89497	89506	89509	A fine old gentleman	2535	’ replied Miss Charity ; ‘
89504	89505	89506	89509	A fine old gentleman	2535	’ ‘
89511	89525	89552	89552	he	9140	’ repeated Jonas , giving the crown of his hat an angry knock . ‘
89549	89550	89552	89552	he	9140	’ ‘
89556	89562	89552	89552	he	9140	’ said the young lady . ‘

89676	89762	89768	89768	my	0	’ Is any one surprised at Mr Jonas making such a reference to such a book for such a purpose ? Does any one doubt the old saw , that the Devil ( being a layman ) quotes Scripture for his own ends ? If he will take the trouble to look about him , he may find a greater number of confirmations of the fact in the occurrences of any single day , than the steam - gun can discharge balls in a minute . ‘
89771	89775	89900	89900	I	0	’ said Jonas ; ‘
89912	89946	90011	90011	Jonas	219	’ Miss Charity cast her eyes upon her father ’s autograph , which merely said--‘Go , my children , with your cousin . Let there be union among us when it is possible ; ’
90006	90009	90011	90011	Jonas	219	‘ Aha ! ’
90013	90021	90029	90029	Mercy	244	‘ There you are , are you ? ’
90022	90027	90029	90029	Mercy	244	‘ Yes , fright , ’
90031	90049	90059	90060	Mr Jonas	219	‘ here I am ; and I would much rather be anywhere else , I assure you . ’
90050	90057	90059	90060	Mr Jonas	219	‘ You do n’t mean that , ’
90062	90075	90089	90089	Mercy	244	‘ You ca n’t , you know . It is n’t possible . ’
90076	90087	90089	90089	Mercy	244	‘ You can have what opinion you like , fright , ’
90091	90114	90116	90116	she	244	‘ I am content to keep mine ; and mine is that you are a very unpleasant , odious , disagreeable person . ’
90128	90132	90116	90116	she	244	‘ Oh , you ’re
90137	90142	90150	90150	she	2552	’ said Mr Jonas . ‘
90154	90219	90232	90232	her	2552	’ Miss Charity replied in effect , that she was unable to say what the habits and propensities of a regular teaser might be ; and that even if she possessed such information , it would ill become her to admit the existence of any creature with such an unceremonious name in her family ; far less in the person of a beloved sister ; ‘
90222	90230	90232	90232	her	2552	’ added Cherry with an angry glance , ‘
90238	90239	90232	90232	her	2552	’ ‘
90245	90249	90269	90269	I	0	’ said Merry , ‘
90283	90389	90269	90269	I	0	’ This threat had the desired effect of preventing any farther altercation , for Mr Jonas immediately proposed an adjournment , and the same being carried unanimously , they departed from the house straightway . On the doorstep , Mr Jonas gave an arm to each cousin ; which act of gallantry being observed by Bailey junior , from the garret window , was by him saluted with a loud and violent fit of coughing , to which paroxysm he was still the victim when they turned the corner . Mr Jonas inquired in the first instance if they were good walkers and being answered , ‘
90392	90546	90572	90572	they	2558	’ submitted their pedestrian powers to a pretty severe test ; for he showed them as many sights , in the way of bridges , churches , streets , outsides of theatres , and other free spectacles , in that one forenoon , as most people see in a twelvemonth . It was observable in this gentleman , that he had an insurmountable distaste to the insides of buildings , and that he was perfectly acquainted with the merits of all shows , in respect of which there was any charge for admission , which it seemed were every one detestable , and of the very lowest grade of merit . He was so thoroughly possessed with this opinion , that when Miss Charity happened to mention the circumstance of their having been twice or thrice to the theatre with Mr Jinkins and party , he inquired , as a matter of course , ‘
90553	90571	90572	90572	they	2558	’ and being told that Mr Jinkins and party paid , was beyond description entertained , observing that ‘
90580	91307	90572	90572	they	2558	’ and often in the course of the walk , bursting out again into a perfect convulsion of laughter at the surpassing silliness of those gentlemen , and ( doubtless ) at his own superior wisdom . When they had been out for some hours and were thoroughly fatigued , it being by that time twilight , Mr Jonas intimated that he would show them one of the best pieces of fun with which he was acquainted . This joke was of a practical kind , and its humour lay in taking a hackney - coach to the extreme limits of possibility for a shilling . Happily it brought them to the place where Mr Jonas dwelt , or the young ladies might have rather missed the point and cream of the jest . The old - established firm of Anthony Chuzzlewit and Son , Manchester Warehousemen , and so forth , had its place of business in a very narrow street somewhere behind the Post Office ; where every house was in the brightest summer morning very gloomy ; and where light porters watered the pavement , each before his own employer ’s premises , in fantastic patterns , in the dog - days ; and where spruce gentlemen with their hands in the pockets of symmetrical trousers , were always to be seen in warm weather , contemplating their undeniable boots in dusty warehouse doorways ; which appeared to be the hardest work they did , except now and then carrying pens behind their ears . A dim , dirty , smoky , tumble - down , rotten old house it was , as anybody would desire to see ; but there the firm of Anthony Chuzzlewit and Son transacted all their business and their pleasure too , such as it was ; for neither the young man nor the old had any other residence , or any care or thought beyond its narrow limits . Business , as may be readily supposed , was the main thing in this establishment ; insomuch indeed that it shouldered comfort out of doors , and jostled the domestic arrangements at every turn . Thus in the miserable bedrooms there were files of moth - eaten letters hanging up against the walls ; and linen rollers , and fragments of old patterns , and odds and ends of spoiled goods , strewed upon the ground ; while the meagre bedsteads , washing - stands , and scraps of carpet , were huddled away into corners as objects of secondary consideration , not to be thought of but as disagreeable necessities , furnishing no profit , and intruding on the one affair of life . The single sitting - room was on the same principle , a chaos of boxes and old papers , and had more counting - house stools in it than chairs ; not to mention a great monster of a desk straddling over the middle of the floor , and an iron safe sunk into the wall above the fireplace . The solitary little table for purposes of refection and social enjoyment , bore as fair a proportion to the desk and other business furniture , as the graces and harmless relaxations of life had ever done , in the persons of the old man and his son , to their pursuit of wealth . It was meanly laid out now for dinner ; and in a chair before the fire sat Anthony himself , who rose to greet his son and his fair cousins as they entered . An ancient proverb warns us that we should not expect to find old heads upon young shoulders ; to which it may be added that we seldom meet with that unnatural combination , but we feel a strong desire to knock them off ; merely from an inherent love we have of seeing things in their right places . It is not improbable that many men , in no wise choleric by nature , felt this impulse rising up within them , when they first made the acquaintance of Mr Jonas ; but if they had known him more intimately in his own house , and had sat with him at his own board , it would assuredly have been paramount to all other considerations . ‘
91312	91325	91333	91333	I	0	’ said Mr Jonas , dutifully addressing his parent by that title . ‘
91331	91332	91333	91333	I	0	’ ‘
91339	91345	91359	91359	I	0	’ rejoined the old man . ‘
91353	91358	91365	91365	I	0	’ rejoined the son . ‘
91370	91371	91374	91374	I	0	’ ‘
91381	91385	91386	91386	You	0	’ said Anthony . ‘
91393	91402	91423	91423	I	0	’ rejoined his son in a lower tone . ‘
91430	91538	91556	91556	I	0	’ Anthony handed him a battered old office candlestick , with which Mr Jonas preceded the young ladies to the nearest bedroom , where he left them to take off their shawls and bonnets ; and returning , occupied himself in opening a bottle of wine , sharpening the carving - knife , and muttering compliments to his father , until they and the dinner appeared together . The repast consisted of a hot leg of mutton with greens and potatoes ; and the dishes having been set upon the table by a slipshod old woman , they were left to enjoy it after their own manner . ‘
91548	91555	91608	91608	You	0	’ said Mr Jonas to Charity . ‘
91606	91607	91616	91616	Mercy	244	’ ‘
91609	91614	91616	91616	Mercy	244	’re such a fright , ’
91618	91640	91648	91649	Mr Jonas	219	‘ that I know I shall have no appetite if I sit so near you ; but I suppose I must . ’
91641	91646	91671	91672	Miss Pecksniff	244	‘ An’t she lively ? ’
91661	91669	91671	91672	Miss Pecksniff	244	‘ Oh I really do n’t know ! ’
91676	91687	91702	91703	Mr Jonas	219	‘ I am tired of being asked such ridiculous questions . ’
91688	91700	91702	91703	Mr Jonas	219	‘ What ’s that precious old father of mine about now ? ’
91724	91731	91743	91744	old Anthony	270	‘ What are you looking for ? ’
91732	91741	91743	91744	old Anthony	270	‘ I ’ve lost my glasses , Jonas , ’
91746	91757	91743	91744	old Anthony	270	‘ Sit down without your glasses , ca n’t you ? ’
91762	91771	91801	91801	you	1211	‘ You do n’t eat or drink out of ‘
91803	92077	92095	92096	Old Chuffey	354	’ It would seem that he did n’t , for he did n’t come until the father called . As he spoke , the door of a small glass office , which was partitioned off from the rest of the room , was slowly opened , and a little blear - eyed , weazen - faced , ancient man came creeping out . He was of a remote fashion , and dusty , like the rest of the furniture ; he was dressed in a decayed suit of black ; with breeches garnished at the knees with rusty wisps of ribbon , the very paupers of shoestrings ; on the lower portion of his spindle legs were dingy worsted stockings of the same colour . He looked as if he had been put away and forgotten half a century before , and somebody had just found him in a lumber - closet . Such as he was , he came slowly creeping on towards the table , until at last he crept into the vacant chair , from which , as his dim faculties became conscious of the presence of strangers , and those strangers ladies , he rose again , apparently intending to make a bow . But he sat down once more without having made it , and breathing on his shrivelled hands to warm them , remained with his poor blue nose immovable above his plate , looking at nothing , with eyes that saw nothing , and a face that meant nothing . Take him in that state , and he was an embodiment of nothing . Nothing else . ‘
92081	92094	92095	92096	Old Chuffey	354	’ said Mr Jonas , as host and master of the ceremonies : ‘
92098	92099	92095	92096	Old Chuffey	354	’ ‘
92104	92112	92128	92128	he	354	’ inquired one of the young ladies . ‘
92132	92133	92149	92149	Blind	2574	’ ‘
92142	92148	92149	92149	Blind	2574	’ replied the old man . ‘
92151	92157	92162	92162	I	0	’ inquired the young ladies . ‘
92172	92178	92187	92187	you	9911	’ said Jonas , carelessly . ‘
92191	92192	92187	92187	you	9911	’ ‘
92196	92200	92203	92203	he	354	’ replied Anthony . ‘
92207	92208	92211	92211	I	0	’ ‘
92219	92230	92262	92262	He	354	’ said Mr Jonas , apart to the young ladies , ‘
92272	92280	92290	92290	HIM	354	’ he added in a louder voice , ‘
92292	92315	92290	92290	HIM	354	’ He pointed to his honoured parent with the carving - fork , in order that they might know whom he meant . ‘
92320	92325	92337	92337	he	354	’ cried the sisters . ‘
92331	92336	92429	92432	A very good one	2583	’ said Mr Jonas , ‘
92427	92428	92429	92432	A very good one	2583	’ ‘
92434	92438	92441	92441	He	354	’ said Anthony . ‘
92450	92454	92533	92533	he	354	’ observed Jonas ; ‘
92551	92552	92533	92533	he	354	’ ‘
92558	92562	92533	92533	he	354	’ asked Merry . ‘
92567	92580	92612	92612	I	0	’ said Jonas , plying his own knife and fork very fast . ‘
92613	92654	92671	92672	Mr Jonas	219	’m at all sharp set , as I am to - day , I come to him after I ’ve taken the edge off my own hunger , you know . Now , Chuffey , stupid , are you ready ? ’
92659	92669	92671	92672	Mr Jonas	219	‘ Always a perverse old file , he was , ’
92681	92687	92700	92702	the old man	991	‘ Ask him , father . ’
92688	92698	92710	92710	Chuffey	354	‘ Are you ready for your dinner , Chuffey ? ’
92703	92708	92710	92710	Chuffey	354	‘ Yes , yes , ’
92744	92769	92818	92818	Jonas	219	‘ Yes , yes . Quite ready , Mr Chuzzlewit . Quite ready , sir . All ready , all ready , all ready . ’
92807	92816	92818	92818	Jonas	219	‘ He ’ll be very disagreeable , mind , ’
92835	92899	93141	93141	he	2195	‘ He always chokes himself when it an’t broth . Look at him , now ! Did you ever see a horse with such a wall - eyed expression as he ’s got ? If it had n’t been for the joke of it I would n’t have let him come in to - day ; but I thought he ’d amuse you . ’
93147	93202	93316	93323	the old man , brightening up as before	2608	‘ I taught him . I trained him . This is the heir of my bringing - up . Sly , cunning , and covetous , he ’ll not squander my money . I worked for this ; I hoped for this ; it has been the great end and aim of my life . ’
93297	93304	93316	93323	the old man , brightening up as before	2608	‘ peg away at his bread ; ’
93309	93314	93316	93323	the old man , brightening up as before	2608	‘ Aye , aye ! ’
93336	93365	93512	93512	Pecksniff	244	‘ quite right , quite right . He ’s your own son , Mr Chuzzlewit ! Bless him for a sharp lad ! Bless him , bless him ! ’
93433	93489	93512	93512	Pecksniff	244	’ glasses , calling on them not to spare it , as they might be certain there was plenty more where that came from . But he added with some haste after this sally that it was only his joke , and they would n’t suppose him to be in earnest , he was sure . ‘
93494	93498	93586	93586	Jonas	219	’ said Anthony , ‘

93599	93609	93611	93611	you	219	’ observed that hopeful gentleman with his mouth full . ‘
93618	93625	93677	93677	I	0	’ cried Anthony , quite enraptured . ‘
93646	93647	93677	93677	I	0	’ ‘
93650	93659	93677	93677	I	0	’ whispered Mr Jonas to his favourite cousin , ‘

93686	93695	93700	93700	yourself	219	’ said Cherry , in a petulant manner . ‘
93710	93711	93712	93712	She	1940	’ ‘
93721	93726	93730	93730	you	219	’ replied Mr Jonas . ‘
93736	93740	93744	93744	she	1940	’ said Charity . ‘

93760	93764	93757	93757	she	1940	’ asked Jonas . ‘
93778	93842	93757	93757	she	1940	’ returned the young lady . Mr Jonas made no verbal rejoinder , but he glanced at Mercy with an odd expression in his face ; and said THAT would n’t break his heart , she might depend upon it . Then he looked on Charity with even greater favour than before , and besought her , as his polite manner was , to ‘
93848	93849	93860	93860	father	9911	’ ‘
93862	93871	93860	93860	father	9911	’ remarked Jonas , after a short silence . ‘
93876	93886	93860	93860	father	9911	’ asked the father ; grinning already in anticipation . ‘
93890	93895	93919	93920	All others	2625	’ said the son . ‘
93924	93980	93989	93990	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ The delighted father applauded this sentiment to the echo ; and was so much tickled by it , that he was at the pains of imparting the same to his ancient clerk , who rubbed his hands , nodded his palsied head , winked his watery eyes , and cried in his whistling tones , ‘
93991	94806	93989	93990	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ with every feeble demonstration of delight that he was capable of making . But this old man ’s enthusiasm had the redeeming quality of being felt in sympathy with the only creature to whom he was linked by ties of long association , and by his present helplessness . And if there had been anybody there , who cared to think about it , some dregs of a better nature unawakened , might perhaps have been descried through that very medium , melancholy though it was , yet lingering at the bottom of the worn - out cask called Chuffey . As matters stood , nobody thought or said anything upon the subject ; so Chuffey fell back into a dark corner on one side of the fireplace , where he always spent his evenings , and was neither seen nor heard again that night ; save once , when a cup of tea was given him , in which he was seen to soak his bread mechanically . There was no reason to suppose that he went to sleep at these seasons , or that he heard , or saw , or felt , or thought . He remained , as it were , frozen up -- if any term expressive of such a vigorous process can be applied to him -- until he was again thawed for the moment by a word or touch from Anthony . Miss Charity made tea by desire of Mr Jonas , and felt and looked so like the lady of the house that she was in the prettiest confusion imaginable ; the more so from Mr Jonas sitting close beside her , and whispering a variety of admiring expressions in her ear . Miss Mercy , for her part , felt the entertainment of the evening to be so distinctly and exclusively theirs , that she silently deplored the commercial gentlemen -- at that moment , no doubt , wearying for her return -- and yawned over yesterday ’s newspaper . As to Anthony , he went to sleep outright , so Jonas and Cherry had a clear stage to themselves as long as they chose to keep possession of it . When the tea - tray was taken away , as it was at last , Mr Jonas produced a dirty pack of cards , and entertained the sisters with divers small feats of dexterity : whereof the main purpose of every one was , that you were to decoy somebody into laying a wager with you that you could n’t do it ; and were then immediately to win and pocket his money . Mr Jonas informed them that these accomplishments were in high vogue in the most intellectual circles , and that large amounts were constantly changing hands on such hazards . And it may be remarked that he fully believed this ; for there is a simplicity of cunning no less than a simplicity of innocence ; and in all matters where a lively faith in knavery and meanness was required as the ground - work of belief , Mr Jonas was one of the most credulous of men . His ignorance , which was stupendous , may be taken into account , if the reader pleases , separately . This fine young man had all the inclination to be a profligate of the first water , and only lacked the one good trait in the common catalogue of debauched vices -- open - handedness -- to be a notable vagabond . But there his griping and penurious habits stepped in ; and as one poison will sometimes neutralise another , when wholesome remedies would not avail , so he was restrained by a bad passion from quaffing his full measure of evil , when virtue might have sought to hold him back in vain . By the time he had unfolded all the peddling schemes he knew upon the cards , it was growing late in the evening ; and Mr Pecksniff not making his appearance , the young ladies expressed a wish to return home . But this , Mr Jonas , in his gallantry , would by no means allow , until they had partaken of some bread and cheese and porter ; and even then he was excessively unwilling to allow them to depart ; often beseeching Miss Charity to come a little closer , or to stop a little longer , and preferring many other complimentary petitions of that nature in his own hospitable and earnest way . When all his efforts to detain them were fruitless , he put on his hat and greatcoat preparatory to escorting them to Todgers ’s ; remarking that he knew they would rather walk thither than ride ; and that for his part he was quite of their opinion . ‘
94810	94814	94862	94863	the creature	1505	’ said Anthony . ‘
94858	94859	94862	94863	the creature	1505	’ ‘

95137	95168	95264	95265	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ It was pretty clear what was going on THERE , and she was glad of it , for it really was high time that Miss Pecksniff thought of settling . ’
95254	95262	95342	95342	They	2635	‘ Never , my dear Miss Pecksniffs , ’
95280	95341	95370	95371	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ never have I seen an establishment so perfectly broken - hearted as mine is at this present moment of time . I do n’t believe the gentlemen will be the gentlemen they were , or anything like it -- no , not for weeks to come . You have a great deal to answer for , both of you . ’
95361	95368	95370	95371	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Your pious pa , too , ’
95373	95395	95432	95433	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ There ’s a loss ! My dear Miss Pecksniffs , your pa is a perfect missionary of peace and love . ’
95425	95430	95432	95433	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ If I dared , ’
95438	95504	95528	95532	the lady of the house	10540	‘ to violate a confidence which has been reposed in me , and to tell you why I must beg of you to leave the little door between your room and mine open tonight , I think you would be interested . But I must n’t do it , for I promised Mr Jinkins faithfully , that I would be as silent as the tomb . ’
95505	95515	95528	95532	the lady of the house	10540	‘ Dear Mrs Todgers ! What can you mean ? ’
95516	95526	95604	95605	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Why , then , my sweet Miss Pecksniffs , ’
95534	95602	95608	95608	her	322	‘ my own loves , if you will allow me the privilege of taking that freedom on the eve of our separation , Mr Jinkins and the gentlemen have made up a little musical party among themselves , and DO intend , in the dead of this night , to perform a serenade upon the stairs outside the door . I could have wished , I own , ’
95612	95641	95608	95608	her	322	‘ that it had been fixed to take place an hour or two earlier ; because when gentlemen sit up late they drink , and when they drink they ’re
95681	95878	95883	95883	thee	2651	’ The young ladies were at first so much excited by the news , that they vowed they could n’t think of going to bed until the serenade was over . But half an hour of cool waiting so altered their opinion that they not only went to bed , but fell asleep ; and were , moreover , not ecstatically charmed to be awakened some time afterwards by certain dulcet strains breaking in upon the silent watches of the night . It was very affecting -- very . Nothing more dismal could have been desired by the most fastidious taste . The gentleman of a vocal turn was head mute , or chief mourner ; Jinkins took the bass ; and the rest took anything they could get . The youngest gentleman blew his melancholy into a flute . He did n’t blow much out of it , but that was all the better . If the two Miss Pecksniffs and Mrs Todgers had perished by spontaneous combustion , and the serenade had been in honour of their ashes , it would have been impossible to surpass the unutterable despair expressed in that one chorus , ‘
95885	96379	96586	96587	the youth	938	’ It was a requiem , a dirge , a moan , a howl , a wail , a lament , an abstract of everything that is sorrowful and hideous in sound . The flute of the youngest gentleman was wild and fitful . It came and went in gusts , like the wind . For a long time together he seemed to have left off , and when it was quite settled by Mrs Todgers and the young ladies that , overcome by his feelings , he had retired in tears , he unexpectedly turned up again at the very top of the tune , gasping for breath . He was a tremendous performer . There was no knowing where to have him ; and exactly when you thought he was doing nothing at all , then was he doing the very thing that ought to astonish you most . There were several of these concerted pieces ; perhaps two or three too many , though that , as Mrs Todgers said , was a fault on the right side . But even then , even at that solemn moment , when the thrilling sounds may be presumed to have penetrated into the very depths of his nature , if he had any depths , Jinkins could n’t leave the youngest gentleman alone . He asked him distinctly , before the second song began -- as a personal favour too , mark the villain in that -- not to play . Yes ; he said so ; not to play . The breathing of the youngest gentleman was heard through the key - hole of the door . He DIDN’T play . What vent was a flute for the passions swelling up within his breast ? A trombone would have been a world too mild . The serenade approached its close . Its crowning interest was at hand . The gentleman of a literary turn had written a song on the departure of the ladies , and adapted it to an old tune . They all joined , except the youngest gentleman in company , who , for the reasons aforesaid , maintained a fearful silence . The song ( which was of a classical nature ) invoked the oracle of Apollo , and demanded to know what would become of Todgers ’s when CHARITY and MERCY were banished from its walls . The oracle delivered no opinion particularly worth remembering , according to the not infrequent practice of oracles from the earliest ages down to the present time . In the absence of enlightenment on that subject , the strain deserted it , and went on to show that the Miss Pecksniffs were nearly related to Rule Britannia , and that if Great Britain had n’t been an island , there could have been no Miss Pecksniffs . And being now on a nautical tack , it closed with this verse : ‘
96413	96525	96538	96538	you	10147	’ As they presented this beautiful picture to the imagination , the gentlemen gradually withdrew to bed to give the music the effect of distance ; and so it died away , and Todgers ’s was left to its repose . Mr Bailey reserved his vocal offering until the morning , when he put his head into the room as the young ladies were kneeling before their trunks , packing up , and treated them to an imitation of the voice of a young dog in trying circumstances ; when that animal is supposed by persons of a lively fancy , to relieve his feelings by calling for pen and ink . ‘
96531	96536	96586	96587	the youth	938	’ said the youth , ‘
96539	96551	96538	96538	you	10147	’re a - going home , are you , worse luck ? ’
96552	96558	96538	96538	you	10147	‘ Yes , Bailey , we ’re
96562	96566	96586	96587	the youth	938	’ returned Mercy . ‘

96589	96597	96623	96623	Bailey	329	‘ It ’s real , an’t it ? ’
96611	96621	96623	96623	Bailey	329	‘ Oh , is it of course , though ? ’
96625	96678	96685	96685	I	0	‘ I know better than that . Hers an’t . Why , I see it hanging up once , on that nail by the winder . Besides , I have gone behind her at dinner - time and pulled it ; and she never know’d . I say , young ladies , I ’m
96701	96737	96685	96685	I	0	’ Miss Mercy inquired what his plans for the future might be ; in reply to whom Mr Bailey intimated that he thought of going either into top - boots , or into the army . ‘
96742	96752	96685	96685	I	0	’ cried the young ladies , with a laugh . ‘
96755	96759	96777	96777	em	2663	’ said Bailey , ‘
96773	96776	96777	96777	em	2663	’m acquainted with ‘
96787	96797	96809	96809	Mercy	244	‘ em , mind you ! Not at all ! ’
96798	96807	96816	96817	Mr Bailey	329	‘ You ’ll be shot , I see , ’
96811	96814	96816	96817	Mr Bailey	329	‘ Well ! ’
96819	96876	96932	96932	they	2666	‘ wot if I am ? There ’s something gamey in it , young ladies , an’t there ? I ’d sooner be hit with a cannon - ball than a rolling - pin , and she ’s always a - catching up something of that sort , and throwing it at me , when the gentlemans ’
96883	96896	96919	96920	no one	9558	’ said Mr Bailey , stung by the recollection of his wrongs , ‘
96916	96917	96919	96920	no one	9558	’ ‘
96925	96929	96932	96932	they	2666	’ said Mercy . ‘
96935	96940	97020	97020	you	2671	’ retorted the youth . ‘
97002	97012	97056	97056	I	0	’ added Mr Bailey , relenting into a smile , ‘
97059	97318	97326	97326	you	2674	’ The young ladies , on behalf of Mr Pecksniff and themselves , acted on this thoughtful advice ; and in consideration of their private friendship , presented Mr Bailey with a gratuity so liberal that he could hardly do enough to show his gratitude ; which found but an imperfect vent , during the remainder of the day , in divers secret slaps upon his pocket , and other such facetious pantomime . Nor was it confined to these ebullitions ; for besides crushing a bandbox , with a bonnet in it , he seriously damaged Mr Pecksniff ’s luggage , by ardently hauling it down from the top of the house ; and in short evinced , by every means in his power , a lively sense of the favours he had received from that gentleman and his family . Mr Pecksniff and Mr Jinkins came home to dinner arm - in - arm ; for the latter gentleman had made half - holiday on purpose ; thus gaining an immense advantage over the youngest gentleman and the rest , whose time , as it perversely chanced , was all bespoke , until the evening . The bottle of wine was Mr Pecksniff ’s treat , and they were very sociable indeed ; though full of lamentations on the necessity of parting . While they were in the midst of their enjoyment , old Anthony and his son were announced ; much to the surprise of Mr Pecksniff , and greatly to the discomfiture of Jinkins . ‘
97329	97359	97386	97386	Pecksniff	218	’ said Anthony , in a low voice , to Mr Pecksniff , as they took their seats apart at the table , while the rest conversed among themselves . ‘
97396	97397	97386	97386	Pecksniff	218	’ ‘
97404	97409	97386	97386	Pecksniff	218	’ rejoined Mr Pecksniff , ‘
97414	97415	97416	97416	I	0	’ ‘
97423	97429	97447	97447	my	0	’ said the old man , ‘
97452	97458	97445	97445	you	2674	’ Mr Pecksniff , still having ‘
97460	97487	97445	97445	you	2674	’ in his mind , only replied by a motion of his head , which was something between an affirmative bow , and a negative shake . ‘
97490	97494	97445	97445	you	2674	’ said Anthony . ‘
97543	97544	97445	97445	you	2674	’ ‘
97549	97647	97661	97661	He	219	’ assented Mr Pecksniff , in a manner which implied that he himself was misunderstood most cruelly , but would not complain . Anthony glanced at his son as he sat beside Miss Charity , and then at Mr Pecksniff , and then at his son again , very many times . It happened that Mr Pecksniff ’s glances took a similar direction ; but when he became aware of it , he first cast down his eyes , and then closed them ; as if he were determined that the old man should read nothing there . ‘
97654	97660	97661	97661	He	219	’ said the old man . ‘
97664	97674	97661	97661	He	219	’ rejoined Mr Pecksniff in his most candid manner , ‘
97680	97681	97661	97661	He	219	’ ‘
97685	97691	97707	97707	ye	2681	’ said the old man . ‘
97700	97705	97719	97719	he	219	’ returned Mr Pecksniff . ‘
97709	97716	97719	97719	he	219	’ said Anthony in his ear . ‘
97726	97727	97746	97747	young people	2366	’ ‘
97734	97745	97767	97767	sir	864	’ said Mr Pecksniff , with his eyes still closed ; ‘
97769	97770	97767	97767	sir	864	’ ‘
97786	97790	97767	97767	sir	864	’ returned Anthony . ‘
97799	97800	97767	97767	sir	864	’ ‘
97805	97810	97814	97814	You	2681	’ rejoined Mr Pecksniff . ‘
97818	97819	97822	97822	I	0	’ ‘
97826	97834	97905	97905	I	0	’ said the old man , drily . ‘
97887	97904	97977	97977	Pecksniff	218	’ Mr Pecksniff , smiling gently , was about to speak , but Anthony stopped him . ‘
97979	97990	98092	98092	I	0	’ added Anthony , laying his hand upon his sleeve , ‘
98096	98790	98800	98800	Tom	330	’ He rose as he spoke ; and giving Mr Pecksniff a nod of intelligence , moved away from him to where the young people were sitting ; leaving that good man somewhat puzzled and discomfited by such very plain dealing , and not quite free from a sense of having been foiled in the exercise of his familiar weapons . But the night - coach had a punctual character , and it was time to join it at the office ; which was so near at hand that they had already sent their luggage and arranged to walk . Thither the whole party repaired , therefore , after no more delay than sufficed for the equipment of the Miss Pecksniffs and Mrs Todgers . They found the coach already at its starting - place , and the horses in ; there , too , were a large majority of the commercial gentlemen , including the youngest , who was visibly agitated , and in a state of deep mental dejection . Nothing could equal the distress of Mrs Todgers in parting from the young ladies , except the strong emotions with which she bade adieu to Mr Pecksniff . Never surely was a pocket - handkerchief taken in and out of a flat reticule so often as Mrs Todgers ’s was , as she stood upon the pavement by the coach - door supported on either side by a commercial gentleman ; and by the sight of the coach - lamps caught such brief snatches and glimpses of the good man ’s face , as the constant interposition of Mr Jinkins allowed . For Jinkins , to the last the youngest gentleman ’s rock a - head in life , stood upon the coachstep talking to the ladies . Upon the other step was Mr Jonas , who maintained that position in right of his cousinship ; whereas the youngest gentleman , who had been first upon the ground , was deep in the booking - office among the black and red placards , and the portraits of fast coaches , where he was ignominiously harassed by porters , and had to contend and strive perpetually with heavy baggage . This false position , combined with his nervous excitement , brought about the very consummation and catastrophe of his miseries ; for when in the moment of parting he aimed a flower , a hothouse flower that had cost money , at the fair hand of Mercy , it reached , instead , the coachman on the box , who thanked him kindly , and stuck it in his buttonhole . They were off now ; and Todgers ’s was alone again . The two young ladies , leaning back in their separate corners , resigned themselves to their own regretful thoughts . But Mr Pecksniff , dismissing all ephemeral considerations of social pleasure and enjoyment , concentrated his meditations on the one great virtuous purpose before him , of casting out that ingrate and deceiver , whose presence yet troubled his domestic hearth , and was a sacrilege upon the altars of his household gods . CHAPTER TWELVE WILL BE SEEN IN THE LONG RUN , IF NOT IN THE SHORT ONE , TO CONCERN MR PINCH AND OTHERS , NEARLY . MR PECKSNIFF ASSERTS THE DIGNITY OF OUTRAGED VIRTUE . YOUNG MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT FORMS A DESPERATE RESOLUTION Mr Pinch and Martin , little dreaming of the stormy weather that impended , made themselves very comfortable in the Pecksniffian halls , and improved their friendship daily . Martin ’s facility , both of invention and execution , being remarkable , the grammar - school proceeded with great vigour ; and Tom repeatedly declared , that if there were anything like certainty in human affairs , or impartiality in human judges , a design so new and full of merit could not fail to carry off the first prize when the time of competition arrived . Without being quite so sanguine himself , Martin had his hopeful anticipations too ; and they served to make him brisk and eager at his task . ‘
98802	98828	98829	98829	I	0	’ said the new pupil one day , as he stood at a little distance from his drawing , and eyed it with much complacency , ‘

99031	99075	99089	99089	I	0	’ retorted Martin , with a manner as free and easy in its condescension to , not to say in its compassion for , the other , as if he were already First Architect in ordinary to all the Crowned Heads in Europe . ‘
99087	99088	99081	99081	I	0	’ ‘

99370	99430	99439	99439	Tom	249	’ To say that Tom had no idea of playing first fiddle in any social orchestra , but was always quite satisfied to be set down for the hundred and fiftieth violin in the band , or thereabouts , is to express his modesty in very inadequate terms . He was much delighted , therefore , by these observations . ‘
99444	99494	99500	99500	her	2711	’ said Martin . What was that which checked Tom Pinch so suddenly , in the high flow of his gladness ; bringing the blood into his honest cheeks , and a remorseful feeling to his honest heart , as if he were unworthy of his friend ’s regard ? ‘
99503	99515	99528	99528	They	1396	’ said Martin , looking with a smile towards the light ; ‘
99538	99570	99583	99583	mine	0	’ But not a word said Mr Pinch . The words he would have uttered died upon his lips , and found a life more spiritual in self - denying thoughts . ‘
99590	99594	99645	99645	Tom	249	’ pursued Martin . ‘
99601	99644	99666	99666	Martin	221	‘ em after you . Tom , eh ? Well , I do n’t know . Tom ’s not a bad name . Thomas Pinch Chuzzlewit . T. P. C. on his pinafores -- no objection to that , I should say ? ’

99668	99671	99692	99692	Martin	221	‘ Aye ! ’
99678	99690	99709	99709	he	221	‘ I can tell exactly what she would think of you , ’
99716	99762	99770	99770	Tom	249	‘ I know her so well . She would smile , Tom , often at first when you spoke to her , or when she looked at you -- merrily too -- but you would n’t mind that . A brighter smile you never saw . ’
99763	99768	99709	99709	he	221	‘ No , no , ’
99772	99779	99793	99793	Martin	221	‘ I would n’t mind that . ’
99780	99791	99793	99793	Martin	221	‘ She would be as tender with you , Tom , ’
99795	99818	99845	99845	Martin	221	‘ as if you were a child yourself . So you are almost , in some things , an’t you , Tom ? ’
99826	99843	99845	99845	Martin	221	‘ She would always be kind and good - humoured , and glad to see you , ’
99847	99962	99978	99978	Martin	221	‘ and when she found out exactly what sort of fellow you were ( which she ’d do very soon ) , she would pretend to give you little commissions to execute , and to ask little services of you , which she knew you were burning to render ; so that when she really pleased you most , she would try to make you think you most pleased her . She would take to you uncommonly , Tom ; and would understand you far more delicately than I ever shall ; and would often say , I know , that you were a harmless , gentle , well - intentioned , good fellow . ’
99969	99976	99978	99978	Martin	221	‘ In honour of old time , ’
99980	100091	100225	100225	Tom	249	‘ and of her having heard you play the organ in this damp little church down here -- for nothing too -- we will have one in the house . I shall build an architectural music - room on a plan of my own , and it ’ll look rather knowing in a recess at one end . There you shall play away , Tom , till you tire yourself ; and , as you like to do so in the dark , it shall BE dark ; and many ’s the summer evening she and I will sit and listen to you , Tom ; be sure of that ! ’
100211	100223	100303	100303	Tom	249	‘ It ’s a proof of the kindness of human nature , ’
100238	100301	100303	100303	Tom	249	‘ that everybody who comes here , as you have done , is more considerate and affectionate to me than I should have any right to hope , if I were the most sanguine creature in the world ; or should have any power to express , if I were the most eloquent . It really overpowers me . But trust me , ’
100305	100335	100344	100344	Martin	221	‘ that I am not ungrateful -- that I never forget -- and that if I can ever prove the truth of my words to you , I will . ’
100336	100342	100344	100344	Martin	221	‘ That ’s all right , ’
100362	100371	100501	100501	Westlock	247	‘ Very fine talking , Tom ; but I ’m
100413	100414	100501	100501	Westlock	247	’ ‘
100420	100440	100501	100501	Westlock	247	’ asked Tom , seeming to enter a mild protest on behalf of the dignity of an absent person . ‘
100450	100451	100501	100501	Westlock	247	’ ‘
100454	100466	100501	100501	Westlock	247	’ rejoined Tom , in rather a louder tone than usual . ‘
100473	100477	100501	100501	Westlock	247	’ said Martin , ‘
100503	100504	100507	100507	he	247	’ ‘
100514	100525	100526	100526	He	247	’ answered Tom , nodding his head , and smiling . ‘
100532	100536	100549	100549	you	0	’ said Martin . ‘
100555	100556	100549	100549	you	0	’ ‘
100559	100563	100549	100549	you	0	’ said Tom ; ‘

100660	100664	100682	100682	Pinch	221	’ observed Martin , ‘
100684	100685	100690	100690	I	0	’ ‘
100693	100697	100710	100710	I	0	’ said Tom ; ‘
100711	100732	100745	100745	Martin	221	’m afraid you have put me out a little now , for I forget what I was going to say . ’
100733	100743	100758	100758	Tom	249	‘ When John ’s father ’s executors cashed up , ’
100748	100756	100758	100758	Tom	249	‘ Oh yes , to be sure , ’
100760	100935	100942	100942	Martin	221	‘ yes . “ Then , ” says John , “ I ’ll give you a dinner , Pinch , and come down to Salisbury on purpose . ” Now , when John wrote the other day -- the morning Pecksniff left , you know -- he said his business was on the point of being immediately settled , and as he was to receive his money directly , when could I meet him at Salisbury ? I wrote and said , any day this week ; and I told him besides , that there was a new pupil here , and what a fine fellow you were , and what friends we had become . Upon which John writes back this letter’--Tom produced it--‘fixes to - morrow ; sends his compliments to you ; and begs that we three may have the pleasure of dining together ; not at the house where you and I were , either ; but at the very first hotel in the town . Read what he says . ’
100936	100940	100948	100948	his	221	‘ Very well , ’
100952	100959	100942	100942	Martin	221	‘ much obliged to him . I ’m
100962	102187	102197	102198	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ Tom could have wished him to be a little more astonished , a little more pleased , or in some form or other a little more interested in such a great event . But he was perfectly self - possessed ; and falling into his favourite solace of whistling , took another turn at the grammar - school , as if nothing at all had happened . Mr Pecksniff ’s horse being regarded in the light of a sacred animal , only to be driven by him , the chief priest of that temple , or by some person distinctly nominated for the time being to that high office by himself , the two young men agreed to walk to Salisbury ; and so , when the time came , they set off on foot ; which was , after all , a better mode of travelling than in the gig , as the weather was very cold and very dry . Better ! A rare strong , hearty , healthy walk -- four statute miles an hour -- preferable to that rumbling , tumbling , jolting , shaking , scraping , creaking , villanous old gig ? Why , the two things will not admit of comparison . It is an insult to the walk , to set them side by side . Where is an instance of a gig having ever circulated a man ’s blood , unless when , putting him in danger of his neck , it awakened in his veins and in his ears , and all along his spine , a tingling heat , much more peculiar than agreeable ? When did a gig ever sharpen anybody ’s wits and energies , unless it was when the horse bolted , and , crashing madly down a steep hill with a stone wall at the bottom , his desperate circumstances suggested to the only gentleman left inside , some novel and unheard - of mode of dropping out behind ? Better than the gig ! The air was cold , Tom ; so it was , there was no denying it ; but would it have been more genial in the gig ? The blacksmith ’s fire burned very bright , and leaped up high , as though it wanted men to warm ; but would it have been less tempting , looked at from the clammy cushions of a gig ? The wind blew keenly , nipping the features of the hardy wight who fought his way along ; blinding him with his own hair if he had enough to it , and wintry dust if he had n’t ; stopping his breath as though he had been soused in a cold bath ; tearing aside his wrappings - up , and whistling in the very marrow of his bones ; but it would have done all this a hundred times more fiercely to a man in a gig , would n’t it ? A fig for gigs ! Better than the gig ! When were travellers by wheels and hoofs seen with such red - hot cheeks as those ? when were they so good - humouredly and merrily bloused ? when did their laughter ring upon the air , as they turned them round , what time the stronger gusts came sweeping up ; and , facing round again as they passed by , dashed on , in such a glow of ruddy health as nothing could keep pace with , but the high spirits it engendered ? Better than the gig ! Why , here is a man in a gig coming the same way now . Look at him as he passes his whip into his left hand , chafes his numbed right fingers on his granite leg , and beats those marble toes of his upon the foot - board . Ha , ha , ha ! Who would exchange this rapid hurry of the blood for yonder stagnant misery , though its pace were twenty miles for one ? Better than the gig ! No man in a gig could have such interest in the milestones . No man in a gig could see , or feel , or think , like merry users of their legs . How , as the wind sweeps on , upon these breezy downs , it tracks its flight in darkening ripples on the grass , and smoothest shadows on the hills ! Look round and round upon this bare bleak plain , and see even here , upon a winter ’s day , how beautiful the shadows are ! Alas ! it is the nature of their kind to be so . The loveliest things in life , Tom , are but shadows ; and they come and go , and change and fade away , as rapidly as these ! Another mile , and then begins a fall of snow , making the crow , who skims away so close above the ground to shirk the wind , a blot of ink upon the landscape . But though it drives and drifts against them as they walk , stiffening on their skirts , and freezing in the lashes of their eyes , they would n’t have it fall more sparingly , no , not so much as by a single flake , although they had to go a score of miles . And , lo ! the towers of the Old Cathedral rise before them , even now ! and by - and - bye they come into the sheltered streets , made strangely silent by their white carpet ; and so to the Inn for which they are bound ; where they present such flushed and burning faces to the cold waiter , and are so brimful of vigour , that he almost feels assaulted by their presence ; and , having nothing to oppose to the attack ( being fresh , or rather stale , from the blazing fire in the coffee - room ) , is quite put out of his pale countenance . A famous Inn ! the hall a very grove of dead game , and dangling joints of mutton ; and in one corner an illustrious larder , with glass doors , developing cold fowls and noble joints , and tarts wherein the raspberry jam coyly withdrew itself , as such a precious creature should , behind a lattice work of pastry . And behold , on the first floor , at the court - end of the house , in a room with all the window - curtains drawn , a fire piled half - way up the chimney , plates warming before it , wax candles gleaming everywhere , and a table spread for three , with silver and glass enough for thirty -- John Westlock ; not the old John of Pecksniff ’s , but a proper gentleman ; looking another and a grander person , with the consciousness of being his own master and having money in the bank ; and yet in some respects the old John too , for he seized Tom Pinch by both his hands the instant he appeared , and fairly hugged him , in his cordial welcome . ‘
102191	102195	102240	102242	the old pupil	2726	’ said John , ‘
102230	102238	102240	102242	the old pupil	2726	‘ Stand off a moment , Tom , ’
102264	102280	102297	102298	Tom Pinch	249	‘ Let me look at you ! Just the same ! Not a bit changed ! ’
102281	102295	102297	102298	Tom Pinch	249	‘ Why , it ’s not so very long ago , you know , ’
102300	102304	102315	102315	John	247	‘ after all . ’
102305	102313	102315	102315	John	247	‘ It seems an age to me , ’
102317	102330	102414	102415	John Westlock	247	‘ and so it ought to seem to you , you dog . ’
102393	102412	102422	102423	Tom Pinch	249	‘ I have ordered everything for dinner , that we used to say we ’d have , Tom , ’
102417	102420	102422	102423	Tom Pinch	249	‘ No ! ’
102425	102429	102463	102463	John	247	‘ Have you ? ’
102430	102462	103056	103056	Martin	221	‘ Everything . Do n’t laugh , if you can help it , before the waiters . I could n’t when I was ordering it . It ’s like a dream . ’
103051	103054	103056	103056	Martin	221	‘ Yes , ’
103058	103090	103100	103100	John	247	‘ It ’s impossible to like Pinch better than I do , or to do greater justice to his good qualities . He is the most willing fellow I ever saw . ’
103091	103098	103100	103100	John	247	‘ He ’s rather too willing , ’
103108	103117	103125	103125	Martin	221	‘ It ’s quite a fault in him . ’
103118	103123	103125	103125	Martin	221	‘ So it is , ’
103127	103193	103200	103200	John	247	‘ Very true . There was a fellow only a week or so ago -- a Mr Tigg -- who borrowed all the money he had , on a promise to repay it in a few days . It was but half a sovereign , to be sure ; but it ’s well it was no more , for he ’ll never see it again . ’
103194	103198	103200	103200	John	247	‘ Poor fellow ! ’
103212	103234	103125	103125	Martin	221	‘ Perhaps you have not had an opportunity of observing that , in his own pecuniary transactions , Tom ’s proud . ’
103235	103258	103273	103273	Martin	221	‘ You do n’t say so ! No , I have n’t . What do you mean ? Wo n’t he borrow ? ’
103265	103271	103273	103273	Martin	221	‘ That ’s very odd , ’
103281	103292	103304	103305	John Westlock	247	‘ He ’s a strange compound , to be sure . ’
103293	103302	103304	103305	John Westlock	247	‘ As to receiving money as a gift , ’
103307	103315	103326	103326	Martin	221	‘ I think he ’d die first . ’
103316	103324	103326	103326	Martin	221	‘ He ’s made up of simplicity , ’
103328	103332	103340	103340	John	247	‘ Help yourself . ’
103333	103338	103340	103340	John	247	‘ You , however , ’
103356	103396	103402	103402	Martin	221	‘ who are older than the majority of Mr Pecksniff ’s assistants , and have evidently had much more experience , understand him , I have no doubt , and see how liable he is to be imposed upon . ’
103397	103400	103435	103436	John Westlock	247	‘ Certainly , ’
103420	103434	103451	103451	Martin	221	‘ Mr Pecksniff knows that too . So do his daughters . Eh ? ’
103444	103449	103451	103451	Martin	221	‘ By the bye , ’
103453	103488	103495	103497	the old pupil	2726	‘ that reminds me . What ’s your opinion of Pecksniff ? How did he use you ? What do you think of him now?--Coolly , you know , when it ’s all over ? ’
103489	103493	103451	103451	Martin	221	‘ Ask Pinch , ’
103499	103521	103529	103529	Martin	221	‘ He knows what my sentiments used to be upon the subject . They are not changed , I assure you . ’
103522	103527	103529	103529	Martin	221	‘ No , no , ’
103531	103540	103551	103551	John	247	‘ I ’d rather have them from you . ’
103541	103549	103572	103572	Martin	221	‘ But Pinch says they are unjust , ’
103556	103570	103572	103572	Martin	221	‘ Oh ! well ! Then I know what course they take beforehand , ’
103574	103687	103699	103700	John Westlock	247	‘ and , therefore , you can have no delicacy in speaking plainly . Do n’t mind me , I beg . I do n’t like him I tell you frankly . I am with him because it happens from particular circumstances to suit my convenience . I have some ability , I believe , in that way ; and the obligation , if any , will most likely be on his side and not mine . At the lowest mark , the balance will be even , and there ’ll be no obligation at all . So you may talk to me , as if I had no connection with him . ’
103688	103697	103710	103710	Martin	221	‘ If you press me to give my opinion-- ’
103702	103708	103710	103710	Martin	221	‘ Yes , I do , ’
103712	103718	103726	103727	the other	934	‘ You ’ll oblige me . ’
103719	103724	103726	103727	the other	934	‘ --I should say , ’
103729	103744	103750	103750	Martin	221	‘ that he is the most consummate scoundrel on the face of the earth . ’
103745	103748	103750	103750	Martin	221	‘ Oh ! ’
103757	103763	103773	103773	John	247	‘ That ’s rather strong . ’
103764	103771	103773	103773	John	247	‘ Not stronger than he deserves , ’
103775	103916	103917	103917	Martin	221	‘ and if he called upon me to express my opinion of him to his face , I would do so in the very same terms , without the least qualification . His treatment of Pinch is in itself enough to justify them ; but when I look back upon the five years I passed in that house , and remember the hyprocrisy , the knavery , the meannesses , the false pretences , the lip service of that fellow , and his trading in saintly semblances for the very worst realities ; when I remember how often I was the witness of all this and how often I was made a kind of party to it , by the fact of being there , with him for my teacher ; I swear to you that I almost despise myself . ’
103928	103941	103917	103917	Martin	221	‘ I do n’t mean to say that is a right feeling , ’
103945	104060	104067	104067	Martin	221	‘ because it was no fault of mine ; and I can quite understand -- you for instance , fully appreciating him , and yet being forced by circumstances to remain there . I tell you simply what my feeling is ; and even now , when , as you say , it ’s all over ; and when I have the satisfaction of knowing that he always hated me , and we always quarrelled , and I always told him my mind ; even now , I feel sorry that I did n’t yield to an impulse I often had , as a boy , of running away from him and going abroad . ’
104061	104065	104082	104083	John Westlock	247	‘ Why abroad ? ’
104076	104080	104082	104083	John Westlock	247	‘ In search , ’
104089	104124	104134	104134	Martin	221	‘ of the livelihood I could n’t have earned at home . There would have been something spirited in that . But , come ! Fill your glass , and let us forget him . ’
104125	104132	104134	104134	Martin	221	‘ As soon as you please , ’
104136	104225	104232	104233	young Westlock	247	‘ In reference to myself and my connection with him , I have only to repeat what I said before . I have taken my own way with him so far , and shall continue to do so , even more than ever ; for the fact is , to tell you the truth , that I believe he looks to me to supply his defects , and could n’t afford to lose me . I had a notion of that in first going there . Your health ! ’
104226	104230	104232	104233	young Westlock	247	‘ Thank you , ’
104235	104252	104082	104083	John Westlock	247	‘ Yours . And may the new pupil turn out as well as you can desire ! ’
104253	104258	104272	104273	John Westlock	247	‘ What new pupil ? ’
104259	104270	104272	104273	John Westlock	247	‘ The fortunate youth , born under an auspicious star , ’
104277	104305	104232	104233	young Westlock	247	‘ whose parents , or guardians , are destined to be hooked by the advertisement . What ! Do n’t you know that he has advertised again ? ’
104306	104309	104394	104394	Tom	249	‘ No . ’
104310	104393	104472	104472	he	249	‘ Oh , yes . I read it just before dinner in the old newspaper . I know it to be his ; having some reason to remember the style . Hush ! Here ’s Pinch . Strange , is it not , that the more he likes Pecksniff ( if he can like him better than he does ) , the greater reason one has to like HIM ? Not a word more , or we shall spoil his whole enjoyment . ’
104467	104471	104472	104472	he	249	‘ And so , ’
104489	104507	104520	104520	he	249	‘ so you really are a gentleman at last , John . Well , to be sure ! ’
104508	104519	104520	104520	he	249	‘ Trying to be , Tom ; trying to be , ’
104526	104540	104558	104559	Tom Pinch	249	‘ There is no saying what I may turn out , in time . ’
104541	104556	104558	104559	Tom Pinch	249	‘ I suppose you would n’t carry your own box to the mail now ? ’
104563	104574	104582	104582	John	247	‘ although you lost it altogether by not taking it . ’
104575	104580	104582	104582	John	247	‘ Would n’t I ? ’
104584	104616	104622	104622	Pinch	249	‘ That ’s all you know about it , Pinch . It must be a very heavy box that I would n’t carry to get away from Pecksniff ’s , Tom . ’
104617	104620	104622	104622	Pinch	249	‘ There ! ’
104628	104664	104682	104683	John Westlock	247	‘ I told you so . The great fault in his character is his injustice to Pecksniff . You must n’t mind a word he says on that subject . His prejudice is most extraordinary . ’
104665	104680	104689	104689	he	247	‘ The absence of anything like prejudice on Tom ’s part , you know , ’
104699	104738	104749	104749	Tom	249	‘ is perfectly wonderful . If one man ever had a profound knowledge of another , and saw him in a true light , and in his own proper colours , Tom has that knowledge of Mr Pecksniff . ’
104739	104747	104749	104749	Tom	249	‘ Why , of course I have , ’
104751	104814	104827	104828	young Westlock	247	‘ That ’s exactly what I have so often said to you . If you knew him as well as I do -- John , I ’d give almost any money to bring that about -- you’d admire , respect , and reverence him . You could n’t help it . Oh , how you wounded his feelings when you went away ! ’

104830	104899	104999	105000	Mr Pinch	221	‘ I ’d have done my best , Tom , with that end in view , you may depend upon it . But as I could n’t wound him in what he has not , and in what he knows nothing of , except in his ability to probe them to the quick in other people , I am afraid I can lay no claim to your compliment . ’
104952	104998	105028	105028	Tom	249	‘ HIS feelings ! Oh , he ’s a tender - hearted man . HIS feelings ! Oh , he ’s a considerate , conscientious , self - examining , moral vagabond , he is ! HIS feelings ! Oh!--what ’s the matter , Tom ? ’
105019	105026	105028	105028	Tom	249	‘ I ca n’t bear it , ’
105034	105093	104999	105000	Mr Pinch	221	‘ No . I really can not . You must excuse me , John . I have a great esteem and friendship for you ; I love you very much ; and have been perfectly charmed and overjoyed to - day , to find you just the same as ever ; but I can not listen to this . ’
105094	105118	105127	105128	Tom Pinch	249	‘ Why , it ’s my old way , Tom ; and you say yourself that you are glad to find me unchanged . ’
105119	105125	105127	105128	Tom Pinch	249	‘ Not in this respect , ’
105130	105197	105206	105207	the other	934	‘ You must excuse me , John . I can not , really ; I will not . It ’s very wrong ; you should be more guarded in your expressions . It was bad enough when you and I used to be alone together , but under existing circumstances , I ca n’t endure it , really . No . I can not , indeed . ’
105198	105204	105261	105261	Pinch	249	‘ You are quite right ! ’
105214	105246	105261	105261	Pinch	249	‘ and I am quite wrong , Tom , I do n’t know how the deuce we fell on this unlucky theme . I beg your pardon with all my heart . ’
105247	105259	105261	105261	Pinch	249	‘ You have a free and manly temper , I know , ’
105263	105303	105314	105315	young Westlock	247	‘ and therefore , your being so ungenerous in this one solitary instance , only grieves me the more . It ’s not my pardon you have to ask , John . You have done ME nothing but kindnesses . ’
105304	105312	105314	105315	young Westlock	247	‘ Well ! Pecksniff ’s pardon then , ’
105317	105341	105348	105348	Tom	249	‘ Anything Tom , or anybody . Pecksniff ’s pardon -- will that do ? Here ! let us drink Pecksniff ’s health ! ’
105342	105346	105387	105388	John Westlock	247	‘ Thank you , ’
105361	105386	105697	105697	himself	247	‘ Thank you ; I ’ll drink it with all my heart , John . Mr Pecksniff ’s health , and prosperity to him ! ’

105822	105827	105860	105864	a doubtful kind of customer	2763	’ said John Westlock . ‘

105930	105935	105973	105973	Tom	249	’ replied his friend , ‘

106310	106350	106351	106351	I	0	’ cried his friend , shaking him to and fro with both hands , and smiling at him with a cheerful , open countenance , that would have carried conviction to a mind much more suspicious than Tom ’s ; ‘
106359	106360	106368	106368	I	0	’ ‘
106363	106367	106407	106407	I	0	’ cried Tom , ‘

106419	106431	106472	106472	You	247	’ said the other , giving his hand a hearty squeeze ; ‘
106478	106479	106472	106472	You	247	’ ‘
106482	106486	106472	106472	You	247	’ said Tom . ‘
106494	106495	106472	106472	You	247	’ ‘
106499	106503	106526	106526	Pecksniff	218	’ cried Tom ; ‘
106523	106524	106526	106526	Pecksniff	218	’ ‘
106528	106546	106548	106548	Pecksniff	218	’ said his friend , stopping at the door for a moment , and looking gayly back . ‘
106550	106558	106548	106548	Pecksniff	218	’ answered Tom , with great gravity ; ‘
106562	106607	106625	106626	Mr Tigg	261	’ And thus they parted for the night ; John Westlock full of light - heartedness and good humour , and poor Tom Pinch quite satisfied ; though still , as he turned over on his side in bed , he muttered to himself , ‘
106628	107370	107381	107381	you	221	’ They breakfasted together very early next morning , for the two young men desired to get back again in good season ; and John Westlock was to return to London by the coach that day . As he had some hours to spare , he bore them company for three or four miles on their walk , and only parted from them at last in sheer necessity . The parting was an unusually hearty one , not only as between him and Tom Pinch , but on the side of Martin also , who had found in the old pupil a very different sort of person from the milksop he had prepared himself to expect . Young Westlock stopped upon a rising ground , when he had gone a little distance , and looked back . They were walking at a brisk pace , and Tom appeared to be talking earnestly . Martin had taken off his greatcoat , the wind being now behind them , and carried it upon his arm . As he looked , he saw Tom relieve him of it , after a faint resistance , and , throwing it upon his own , encumber himself with the weight of both . This trivial incident impressed the old pupil mightily , for he stood there , gazing after them , until they were hidden from his view ; when he shook his head , as if he were troubled by some uneasy reflection , and thoughtfully retraced his steps to Salisbury . In the meantime , Martin and Tom pursued their way , until they halted , safe and sound , at Mr Pecksniff ’s house , where a brief epistle from that good gentleman to Mr Pinch announced the family ’s return by that night ’s coach . As it would pass the corner of the lane at about six o’clock in the morning , Mr Pecksniff requested that the gig might be in waiting at the finger - post about that time , together with a cart for the luggage . And to the end that he might be received with the greater honour , the young men agreed to rise early , and be upon the spot themselves . It was the least cheerful day they had yet passed together . Martin was out of spirits and out of humour , and took every opportunity of comparing his condition and prospects with those of young Westlock ; much to his own disadvantage always . This mood of his depressed Tom ; and neither that morning ’s parting , nor yesterday ’s dinner , helped to mend the matter . So the hours dragged on heavily enough ; and they were glad to go to bed early . They were not quite so glad to get up again at half - past four o’clock , in all the shivering discomfort of a dark winter ’s morning ; but they turned out punctually , and were at the finger - post full half - an - hour before the appointed time . It was not by any means a lively morning , for the sky was black and cloudy , and it rained hard ; but Martin said there was some satisfaction in seeing that brute of a horse ( by this , he meant Mr Pecksniff ’s Arab steed ) getting very wet ; and that he rejoiced , on his account , that it rained so fast . From this it may be inferred that Martin ’s spirits had not improved , as indeed they had not ; for while he and Mr Pinch stood waiting under a hedge , looking at the rain , the gig , the cart , and its reeking driver , he did nothing but grumble ; and , but that it is indispensable to any dispute that there should be two parties to it , he would certainly have picked a quarrel with Tom . At length the noise of wheels was faintly audible in the distance and presently the coach came splashing through the mud and mire with one miserable outside passenger crouching down among wet straw , under a saturated umbrella ; and the coachman , guard , and horses , in a fellowship of dripping wretchedness . Immediately on its stopping , Mr Pecksniff let down the window - glass and hailed Tom Pinch . ‘
107390	107391	107394	107394	sir	864	’ ‘
107396	107403	107409	107409	sir	864	’ cried Tom , advancing eagerly , ‘
107411	107412	107409	107409	sir	864	’ ‘
107415	107435	107454	107455	Mr Pinch	221	’ said Mr Pecksniff , looking not so much at Martin as at the spot on which he stood . ‘
107457	107582	107585	107585	you	2771	’ Then Mr Pecksniff descended , and helped his daughters to alight ; but neither he nor the young ladies took the slightest notice of Martin , who had advanced to offer his assistance , but was repulsed by Mr Pecksniff ’s standing immediately before his person , with his back towards him . In the same manner , and in profound silence , Mr Pecksniff handed his daughters into the gig ; and following himself and taking the reins , drove off home . Lost in astonishment , Martin stood staring at the coach , and when the coach had driven away , at Mr Pinch , and the luggage , until the cart moved off too ; when he said to Tom : ‘
107596	107597	107605	107606	This fellow	1039	’ ‘
107600	107604	107617	107617	You	2773	’ asked Tom . ‘
107621	107622	107635	107635	I	0	’ ‘
107630	107634	107635	107635	I	0	’ cried Tom . ‘
107642	107643	107635	107635	I	0	’ ‘
107649	107653	107860	107861	Mr Pinch	221	’ said Martin . ‘
107662	107855	107876	107876	You	221	’ And without another word started off at such a pace , that Tom had some difficulty in keeping up with him . He had no care where he went , but walked through little heaps of mud and little pools of water with the utmost indifference ; looking straight before him , and sometimes laughing in a strange manner within himself . Tom felt that anything he could say would only render him the more obstinate , and therefore trusted to Mr Pecksniff ’s manner when they reached the house , to remove the mistaken impression under which he felt convinced so great a favourite as the new pupil must unquestionably be labouring . But he was not a little amazed himself , when they did reach it , and entered the parlour where Mr Pecksniff was sitting alone before the fire , drinking some hot tea , to find that instead of taking favourable notice of his relative and keeping him , Mr Pinch , in the background , he did exactly the reverse , and was so lavish in his attentions to Tom , that Tom was thoroughly confounded . ‘
107867	107875	107896	107897	Mr Pinch	221	’ said Pecksniff , stirring the fire . ‘
107899	107949	107954	107954	Pinch	221	’ Tom saw that Martin looked at Mr Pecksniff as though he could have easily found it in his heart to give HIM an invitation to a very warm place ; but he was quite silent , and standing opposite that gentleman at the table , regarded him attentively . ‘
107956	107960	107983	107983	You	221	’ said Pecksniff . ‘
107981	107982	107985	107985	you	221	’ ‘
107999	108003	107985	107985	you	221	’ said Tom . ‘
108009	108010	108018	108019	Mr Pinch	221	’ ‘
108021	108031	108046	108046	YOU	221	’ said Pecksniff , waving his hand and smiling , ‘
108054	108132	108046	108046	YOU	221	’ Mr Pinch looked from master to pupil , and from pupil to master , and was so perplexed and dismayed that he wanted presence of mind to answer the question . In this awkward interval , Mr Pecksniff ( who was perfectly conscious of Martin ’s gaze , though he had never once glanced towards him ) poked the fire very much , and when he could n’t do that any more , drank tea assiduously . ‘
108138	108150	108167	108167	you	218	’ said Martin at last , in a very quiet voice , ‘
108175	108176	108167	108167	you	218	’ ‘
108180	108200	108299	108300	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ said Mr Pecksniff , turning his eyes on Tom Pinch , even more placidly and gently than before , ‘
108211	108298	108299	108300	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ When he had repeated this inquiry , he looked round the walls of the room as if he were curious to see whether any nails had been left there by accident in former times . Tom was almost at his wit ’s end what to say between the two , and had already made a gesture as if he would call Mr Pecksniff ’s attention to the gentleman who had last addressed him , when Martin saved him further trouble , by doing so himself . ‘
108302	108333	108357	108357	his	218	’ he said , softly rapping the table twice or thrice , and moving a step or two nearer , so that he could have touched him with his hand ; ‘
108367	108368	108369	108369	I	0	’ ‘
108377	108396	108369	108369	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff in a severe voice , as he looked at him for the first time , ‘
108399	108400	108401	108401	You	218	’ ‘
108406	108410	108416	108416	I	0	’ returned Martin ; ‘
108427	108452	108416	108416	I	0	’ Mr Pecksniff made a feint of being deeply interested in his pocketbook , but it shook in his hands ; he trembled so . ‘
108455	108464	108477	108477	you	218	’ retorted Martin , rapping the table again . ‘
108474	108475	108477	108477	you	218	’ ‘
108483	108530	108539	108539	sir	864	’ cried Mr Pecksniff . Martin looked at him , and made no answer ; but a curious observer might have detected an ominous twitching at his mouth , and perhaps an involuntary attraction of his right hand in the direction of Mr Pecksniff ’s cravat . ‘
108541	108546	108583	108583	You	864	’ resumed Mr Pecksniff , ‘
108590	108597	108583	108583	You	864	’ said Mr Pecksniff , rising , ‘
108610	108611	108583	108583	You	864	’ ‘
108615	108624	108639	108639	sir	864	’ said Martin , with a scornful smile . ‘
108633	108634	108672	108672	you	864	’ ‘
108641	108666	108777	108777	I	0	’ cried Mr Pecksniff , trembling from head to foot , and trying to rub his hands , as though he were only cold . ‘
108785	108790	108797	108797	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff ; ‘
108813	108826	108858	108859	young man	2195	’ here he struck himself upon his breast , or moral garden ; ‘
108844	108854	108867	108867	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , stretching out his hand : ‘
108871	108965	108970	108970	Pinch	249	’ With what intention Martin made a stride forward at these words , it is impossible to say . It is enough to know that Tom Pinch caught him in his arms , and that , at the same moment , Mr Pecksniff stepped back so hastily , that he missed his footing , tumbled over a chair , and fell in a sitting posture on the ground ; where he remained without an effort to get up again , with his head in a corner , perhaps considering it the safest place . ‘
108972	108980	109134	109135	Mr Pinch	221	’ cried Martin , shaking him away . ‘
109035	109131	109180	109180	I	0	’ Mr Pinch involuntarily did so . Mr Pecksniff sitting , as has been already mentioned , on the carpet , with his head in an acute angle of the wainscot , and all the damage and detriment of an uncomfortable journey about him , was not exactly a model of all that is prepossessing and dignified in man , certainly . Still he WAS Pecksniff ; it was impossible to deprive him of that unique and paramount appeal to Tom . And he returned Tom ’s glance , as if he would have said , ‘
109178	109179	109180	109180	I	0	’ ‘
109184	109188	109287	109287	your	221	’ said Martin , ‘
109303	109359	109375	109375	Dear	10343	’ He pointed at him as he spoke , with unutterable contempt , and flinging his hat upon his head , walked from the room and from the house . He went so rapidly that he was already clear of the village , when he heard Tom Pinch calling breathlessly after him in the distance . ‘
109365	109374	109385	109385	you	10343	’ he said , when Tom came up . ‘
109379	109383	109385	109385	you	10343	’ cried Tom , ‘
109388	109389	109385	109385	you	10343	’ ‘
109392	109396	109401	109401	I	0	’ he echoed . ‘

109433	109437	109446	109446	I	0	’ cried Tom . ‘
109440	109445	109446	109446	I	0	’ he answered sternly , ‘
109449	109450	109446	109446	I	0	’ ‘
109454	109458	109446	109446	I	0	’ cried Tom . ‘

109472	109476	109482	109482	I	0	’ he said . ‘

109494	109504	109536	109536	My	0	’ cried Tom , in a kind of agony . ‘

109542	109546	109558	109558	God	2805	’ he said . ‘

109569	109582	109667	109667	HE	2806	’ cried Tom , pressing a book upon him in great agitation . ‘
109619	109662	110060	110060	He	221	’ The simple fellow wrung him by the hand , with tears stealing down his cheeks ; and they parted hurriedly upon their separate ways . CHAPTER THIRTEEN SHOWING WHAT BECAME OF MARTIN AND HIS DESPARATE RESOLVE , AFTER HE LEFT MR PECKSNIFF ’S

111120	111125	111138	111138	Martin	221	‘ That ’s bad , ’
111130	111136	111141	111142	the driver	2846	‘ And may be worse , ’
111144	111149	111275	111275	he	2846	‘ That ’s bad , ’
111287	111292	111300	111300	Martin	221	‘ Up or down ? ’
111293	111298	111310	111311	the driver	2846	‘ Which IS up ? ’
111302	111308	111319	111319	Martin	221	‘ London , of course , ’
111313	111317	111333	111333	he	221	‘ Up then , ’
111338	111346	111356	111356	his	2846	‘ Now you know all about it . ’
111365	111367	111356	111356	his	2846	‘ I ’m
111371	111376	111388	111388	you	2846	’ observed the driver ; ‘
111385	111386	111423	111423	he	2856	’ ‘
111390	111417	111423	111423	he	2856	’ cried Martin , stopping short and looking at him . The driver sprinkled the fire with his wet hat until it hissed again and answered , ‘
111426	111427	111423	111423	he	2856	’ ‘
111432	111436	111499	111499	you	2846	’ said Martin , ‘
111507	111508	111499	111499	you	2846	’ ‘
111513	111518	111499	111499	you	2846	’ remarked the driver . ‘
111523	111527	111559	111559	I	0	’ said Martin . ‘
111550	111558	111568	111568	I	0	’ Whereupon he began to whistle again . ‘
111570	111580	111581	111581	You	2846	’ asked the driver , with something like indignation . ‘
111590	111594	111657	111657	I	0	’ rejoined Martin . ‘
111667	111668	111657	111657	I	0	’ ‘
111676	111680	111657	111657	I	0	’ said Martin . ‘
111686	111691	111657	111657	I	0	’ returned the other . ‘
111697	111715	111657	111657	I	0	’ said Martin , handing him the mug , and pulling on his coat with great alacrity ; ‘
111727	111959	111657	111657	I	0	’ In two minutes more he had paid his bill , which amounted to a shilling ; was lying at full length on a truss of straw , high and dry at the top of the van , with the tilt a little open in front for the convenience of talking to his new friend ; and was moving along in the right direction with a most satisfactory and encouraging briskness . The driver ’s name , as he soon informed Martin , was William Simmons , better known as Bill ; and his spruce appearance was sufficiently explained by his connection with a large stage - coaching establishment at Hounslow , whither he was conveying his load from a farm belonging to the concern in Wiltshire . He was frequently up and down the road on such errands , he said , and to look after the sick and rest horses , of which animals he had much to relate that occupied a long time in the telling . He aspired to the dignity of the regular box , and expected an appointment on the first vacancy . He was musical besides , and had a little key - bugle in his pocket , on which , whenever the conversation flagged , he played the first part of a great many tunes , and regularly broke down in the second . ‘
111962	112001	112031	112031	Ned	278	’ said Bill , with a sigh , as he drew the back of his hand across his lips , and put this instrument in his pocket , after screwing off the mouth - piece to drain it ; ‘
112033	112034	112036	112036	he	2860	’ ‘
112039	112043	112058	112058	he	2860	’ asked Martin . ‘
112046	112056	112074	112074	He	2860	’ replied the other , with a contemptuous emphasis . ‘
112080	112081	112082	112082	You	2862	’ ‘
112091	112095	112114	112114	Bill	362	’ observed Martin , ‘
112104	112112	112114	112114	Bill	362	‘ He ’s no more in England , ’
112116	112133	112140	112140	Martin	221	‘ if that ’s what you mean . He went to the U - nited States . ’
112134	112138	112140	112140	Martin	221	‘ Did he ? ’
112146	112149	112161	112161	Bill	362	‘ When ? ’
112150	112159	112161	112161	Bill	362	‘ Five year ago , or then about , ’
112163	112208	112214	112214	Martin	221	‘ He had set up in the public line here , and could n’t meet his engagements , so he cut off to Liverpool one day , without saying anything about it , and went and shipped himself for the U - nited States . ’
112209	112212	112214	112214	Martin	221	‘ Well ? ’
112216	112247	112256	112256	Martin	221	‘ Well ! as he landed there without a penny to bless himself with , of course they wos very glad to see him in the U - nited States . ’
112248	112254	112270	112270	Bill	362	‘ What do you mean ? ’
112262	112268	112270	112270	Bill	362	‘ What do I mean ? ’
112272	112314	112318	112318	Ned	278	‘ Why , THAT . All men are alike in the U - nited States , an’t they ? It makes no odds whether a man has a thousand pound , or nothing , there . Particular in New York , I ’m
112321	112322	112318	112318	Ned	278	’ ‘
112329	112335	112318	112318	Ned	278	’ asked Martin , thoughtfully . ‘
112338	112342	112445	112445	his	2864	’ said Bill . ‘
112448	112449	112459	112459	he	2864	’ ‘
112452	112456	112459	112459	he	2864	’ cried Martin . ‘
112462	112466	112490	112490	He	2864	’ said Bill . ‘
112512	112549	112570	112570	Martin	221	‘ em over with a dutiful letter . I know that , because they was shown down our yard for the old gentleman ’s benefit , that he might treat himself with tobacco in the workus . ’
112550	112568	112570	112570	Martin	221	‘ He was a foolish fellow not to take care of his money when he had it , ’
112574	112577	112594	112594	he	2864	‘ There you ’re
112580	112584	112594	112594	he	2864	’ said Bill , ‘
112614	113314	112594	112594	he	2864	’ Martin said nothing in reply , but soon afterwards fell asleep , and remained so for an hour or more . When he awoke , finding it had ceased to rain , he took his seat beside the driver , and asked him several questions ; as how long had the fortunate guard of the Light Salisbury been in crossing the Atlantic ; at what time of the year had he sailed ; what was the name of the ship in which he made the voyage ; how much had he paid for passage - money ; did he suffer greatly from sea - sickness ? and so forth . But on these points of detail his friend was possessed of little or no information ; either answering obviously at random or acknowledging that he had never heard , or had forgotten ; nor , although he returned to the charge very often , could he obtain any useful intelligence on these essential particulars . They jogged on all day , and stopped so often -- now to refresh , now to change their team of horses , now to exchange or bring away a set of harness , now on one point of business , and now upon another , connected with the coaching on that line of road -- that it was midnight when they reached Hounslow . A little short of the stables for which the van was bound , Martin got down , paid his crown , and forced his silk handkerchief upon his honest friend , notwithstanding the many protestations that he did n’t wish to deprive him of it , with which he tried to give the lie to his longing looks . That done , they parted company ; and when the van had driven into its own yard and the gates were closed , Martin stood in the dark street , with a pretty strong sense of being shut out , alone , upon the dreary world , without the key of it . But in this moment of despondency , and often afterwards , the recollection of Mr Pecksniff operated as a cordial to him ; awakening in his breast an indignation that was very wholesome in nerving him to obstinate endurance . Under the influence of this fiery dram he started off for London without more ado . Arriving there in the middle of the night , and not knowing where to find a tavern open , he was fain to stroll about the streets and market - places until morning . He found himself , about an hour before dawn , in the humbler regions of the Adelphi ; and addressing himself to a man in a fur - cap , who was taking down the shutters of an obscure public - house , informed him that he was a stranger , and inquired if he could have a bed there . It happened by good luck that he could . Though none of the gaudiest , it was tolerably clean , and Martin felt very glad and grateful when he crept into it , for warmth , rest , and forgetfulness . It was quite late in the afternoon when he awoke ; and by the time he had washed and dressed , and broken his fast , it was growing dusk again . This was all the better , for it was now a matter of absolute necessity that he should part with his watch to some obliging pawn - broker . He would have waited until after dark for this purpose , though it had been the longest day in the year , and he had begun it without a breakfast . He passed more Golden Balls than all the jugglers in Europe have juggled with , in the course of their united performances , before he could determine in favour of any particular shop where those symbols were displayed . In the end he came back to one of the first he had seen , and entering by a side - door in a court , where the three balls , with the legend ‘
113318	113369	113396	113396	you	2871	’ were repeated in a ghastly transparency , passed into one of a series of little closets , or private boxes , erected for the accommodation of the more bashful and uninitiated customers . He bolted himself in ; pulled out his watch ; and laid it on the counter . ‘
113376	113395	113462	113462	You	2871	’ said a low voice in the next box to the shopman who was in treaty with him , ‘
113447	113461	113472	113473	the shopman	2874	’ Martin drew back involuntarily , for he knew the voice at once . ‘
113463	113470	113513	113514	Mr Tigg	261	’re always full of your chaff , ’
113501	113511	113513	113514	Mr Tigg	261	‘ I shall never be full of my wheat , ’
113516	113584	113602	113603	the shopman	2874	‘ as long as I come here . Ha , ha ! Not bad ! Make it two - and - six , my dear friend , positively for this occasion only . Half - a - crown is a delightful coin . Two - and - six . Going at two - and - six ! For the last time at two - and - six ! ’
113585	113600	113602	113603	the shopman	2874	‘ It ’ll never be the last time till it ’s quite worn out , ’
113605	113617	113638	113639	Mr Tigg	261	‘ It ’s grown yellow in the service as it is . ’
113618	113636	113638	113639	Mr Tigg	261	‘ Its master has grown yellow in the service , if you mean that , my friend , ’
113641	113664	113602	113603	the shopman	2874	‘ in the patriotic service of an ungrateful country . You are making it two - and - six , I think ? ’
113665	113667	113602	113603	the shopman	2874	‘ I ’m
113671	113676	113691	113691	I	0	’ returned the shopman , ‘
113694	113695	113638	113639	Mr Tigg	261	’ ‘
113701	113706	113638	113639	Mr Tigg	261	’ said Mr Tigg ; ‘
113723	113724	113638	113639	Mr Tigg	261	’ ‘
113729	113730	113638	113639	Mr Tigg	261	’ ‘
113735	113740	113787	113788	the shopman	2874	’ said Mr Tigg ; ‘
113769	113770	113787	113788	the shopman	2874	’ ‘
113774	113785	113787	113788	the shopman	2874	’m not going to put down that , you know , ’
113793	113805	113807	113808	Mr Tigg	261	‘ You may put down what you please , my friend , ’
113810	113920	113996	113997	Mr Tigg	261	‘ The fact is still the same . The apartments for the under - butler and the fifth footman being of a most confounded low and vulgar kind at thirty - eight , Mayfair , I have been compelled , in my regard for the feelings which do them so much honour , to take on lease for seven , fourteen , or twenty - one years , renewable at the option of the tenant , the elegant and commodious family mansion , number fifteen - hundred - and - forty - two Park Lane . Make it two - and - six , and come and see me ! ’
113987	113994	113996	113997	Mr Tigg	261	‘ I wish I may die , ’
114023	114083	114100	114100	Martin	221	‘ but this is one of the most tremendous meetings in Ancient or Modern History ! How are you ? What is the news from the agricultural districts ? How are our friends the P. ’s ? Ha , ha ! David , pay particular attention to this gentleman immediately , as a friend of mine , I beg . ’
114084	114098	114100	114100	Martin	221	‘ Here ! Please to give me the most you can for this , ’
114109	114115	114125	114126	Mr Tigg	261	‘ I want money sorely . ’
114116	114123	114125	114126	Mr Tigg	261	‘ He wants money , sorely ! ’
114131	114235	114257	114257	David	312	‘ David , will you have the goodness to do your very utmost for my friend , who wants money sorely . You will deal with my friend as if he were myself . A gold hunting - watch , David , engine - turned , capped and jewelled in four holes , escape movement , horizontal lever , and warranted to perform correctly , upon my personal reputation , who have observed it narrowly for many years , under the most trying circumstances’--here he winked at Martin , that he might understand this recommendation would have an immense effect upon the shopman ; ‘
114259	114260	114261	114261	I	0	’ ‘
114273	114282	114290	114290	I	0	’ said the shopman to Martin , confidentially . ‘
114296	114297	114290	114290	I	0	’ ‘
114304	114309	114376	114376	lodger	2888	’ cried Mr Tigg . ‘
114378	114496	114376	114376	lodger	2888	’ Here he winked at Martin again , to apprise him that all the forms and ceremonies prescribed by law were now complied with , and nothing remained but the receipt for the money . In point of fact , this proved to be the case , for Martin , who had no resource but to take what was offered him , signified his acquiescence by a nod of his head , and presently came out with the cash in his pocket . He was joined in the entry by Mr Tigg , who warmly congratulated him , as he took his arm and accompanied him into the street , on the successful issue of the negotiation . ‘
114505	114510	114530	114530	I	0	’ said Mr Tigg , ‘
114528	114529	114536	114536	I	0	’ ‘
114540	114550	114563	114563	you	0	’ retorted Martin , releasing his arm and stopping . ‘
114556	114561	114563	114563	you	0	’ said Mr Tigg . ‘

114571	114579	114606	114606	I	0	’ observed Martin , biting his lip , ‘
114611	114623	114661	114661	I	0	’ Mr Tigg was about to speak , but Martin interposed : ‘
114671	114672	114661	114661	I	0	’ ‘
114674	114684	114789	114789	I	0	’ cried Mr Tigg , holding out his hand . ‘
114794	114805	114822	114822	sir	864	’ said Mr Tigg , striking himself upon the breast , ‘
114824	114825	114822	114822	sir	864	’ ‘
114833	114838	114872	114873	the devil	10440	’ said Martin coolly , ‘
114878	114915	114872	114873	the devil	10440	’ said Martin , scarcely able , despite his vexation , to repress a smile as Mr Tigg stood leaning his back against the shutters of a shop window , adjusting his hair with great composure , ‘
114924	114925	114929	114929	me	0	’ ‘
114936	114945	115051	115051	you	864	’ said Mr Tigg , with sudden dignity , ‘
115045	115050	115051	115051	you	864	’ concluded Mr Tigg , ‘
115071	116835	115051	115051	you	864	’ Martin drew that piece of money from his pocket , and tossed it towards him . Mr Tigg caught it , looked at it to assure himself of its goodness , spun it in the air after the manner of a pieman , and buttoned it up . Finally , he raised his hat an inch or two from his head with a military air , and , after pausing a moment with deep gravity , as to decide in which direction he should go , and to what Earl or Marquis among his friends he should give the preference in his next call , stuck his hands in his skirt - pockets and swaggered round the corner . Martin took the directly opposite course ; and so , to his great content , they parted company . It was with a bitter sense of humiliation that he cursed , again and again , the mischance of having encountered this man in the pawnbroker ’s shop . The only comfort he had in the recollection was , Mr Tigg ’s voluntary avowal of a separation between himself and Slyme , that would at least prevent his circumstances ( so Martin argued ) from being known to any member of his family , the bare possibility of which filled him with shame and wounded pride . Abstractedly there was greater reason , perhaps , for supposing any declaration of Mr Tigg ’s to be false , than for attaching the least credence to it ; but remembering the terms on which the intimacy between that gentleman and his bosom friend had subsisted , and the strong probability of Mr Tigg ’s having established an independent business of his own on Mr Slyme ’s connection , it had a reasonable appearance of probability ; at all events , Martin hoped so ; and that went a long way . His first step , now that he had a supply of ready money for his present necessities , was , to retain his bed at the public - house until further notice , and to write a formal note to Tom Pinch ( for he knew Pecksniff would see it ) requesting to have his clothes forwarded to London by coach , with a direction to be left at the office until called for . These measures taken , he passed the interval before the box arrived -- three days -- in making inquiries relative to American vessels , at the offices of various shipping - agents in the city ; and in lingering about the docks and wharves , with the faint hope of stumbling upon some engagement for the voyage , as clerk or supercargo , or custodian of something or somebody , which would enable him to procure a free passage . But finding , soon , that no such means of employment were likely to present themselves , and dreading the consequences of delay , he drew up a short advertisement , stating what he wanted , and inserted it in the leading newspapers . Pending the receipt of the twenty or thirty answers which he vaguely expected , he reduced his wardrobe to the narrowest limits consistent with decent respectability , and carried the overplus at different times to the pawnbroker ’s shop , for conversion into money . And it was strange , very strange , even to himself , to find how , by quick though almost imperceptible degrees , he lost his delicacy and self - respect , and gradually came to do that as a matter of course , without the least compunction , which but a few short days before had galled him to the quick . The first time he visited the pawnbroker ’s , he felt on his way there as if every person whom he passed suspected whither he was going ; and on his way back again , as if the whole human tide he stemmed , knew well where he had come from . When did he care to think of their discernment now ! In his first wanderings up and down the weary streets , he counterfeited the walk of one who had an object in his view ; but soon there came upon him the sauntering , slipshod gait of listless idleness , and the lounging at street - corners , and plucking and biting of stray bits of straw , and strolling up and down the same place , and looking into the same shop - windows , with a miserable indifference , fifty times a day . At first , he came out from his lodging with an uneasy sense of being observed -- even by those chance passers - by , on whom he had never looked before , and hundreds to one would never see again -- issuing in the morning from a public - house ; but now , in his comings - out and goings - in he did not mind to lounge about the door , or to stand sunning himself in careless thought beside the wooden stem , studded from head to heel with pegs , on which the beer - pots dangled like so many boughs upon a pewter - tree . And yet it took but five weeks to reach the lowest round of this tall ladder ! Oh , moralists , who treat of happiness and self - respect , innate in every sphere of life , and shedding light on every grain of dust in God ’s highway , so smooth below your carriage - wheels , so rough beneath the tread of naked feet , bethink yourselves in looking on the swift descent of men who HAVE lived in their own esteem , that there are scores of thousands breathing now , and breathing thick with painful toil , who in that high respect have never lived at all , nor had a chance of life ! Go ye , who rest so placidly upon the sacred Bard who had been young , and when he strung his harp was old , and had never seen the righteous forsaken , or his seed begging their bread ; go , Teachers of content and honest pride , into the mine , the mill , the forge , the squalid depths of deepest ignorance , and uttermost abyss of man ’s neglect , and say can any hopeful plant spring up in air so foul that it extinguishes the soul ’s bright torch as fast as it is kindled ! And , oh ! ye Pharisees of the nineteen hundredth year of Christian Knowledge , who soundingly appeal to human nature , see that it be human first . Take heed it has not been transformed , during your slumber and the sleep of generations , into the nature of the Beasts ! Five weeks ! Of all the twenty or thirty answers , not one had come . His money -- even the additional stock he had raised from the disposal of his spare clothes ( and that was not much , for clothes , though dear to buy , are cheap to pawn)--was fast diminishing . Yet what could he do ? At times an agony came over him in which he darted forth again , though he was but newly home , and , returning to some place where he had been already twenty times , made some new attempt to gain his end , but always unsuccessfully . He was years and years too old for a cabin - boy , and years upon years too inexperienced to be accepted as a common seaman . His dress and manner , too , militated fatally against any such proposal as the latter ; and yet he was reduced to making it ; for even if he could have contemplated the being set down in America totally without money , he had not enough left now for a steerage passage and the poorest provisions upon the voyage . It is an illustration of a very common tendency in the mind of man , that all this time he never once doubted , one may almost say the certainty of doing great things in the New World , if he could only get there . In proportion as he became more and more dejected by his present circumstances , and the means of gaining America receded from his grasp , the more he fretted himself with the conviction that that was the only place in which he could hope to achieve any high end , and worried his brain with the thought that men going there in the meanwhile might anticipate him in the attainment of those objects which were dearest to his heart . He often thought of John Westlock , and besides looking out for him on all occasions , actually walked about London for three days together for the express purpose of meeting with him . But although he failed in this ; and although he would not have scrupled to borrow money of him ; and although he believed that John would have lent it ; yet still he could not bring his mind to write to Pinch and inquire where he was to be found . For although , as we have seen , he was fond of Tom after his own fashion , he could not endure the thought ( feeling so superior to Tom ) of making him the stepping - stone to his fortune , or being anything to him but a patron ; and his pride so revolted from the idea that it restrained him even now . It might have yielded , however ; and no doubt must have yielded soon , but for a very strange and unlooked - for occurrence . The five weeks had quite run out , and he was in a truly desperate plight , when one evening , having just returned to his lodging , and being in the act of lighting his candle at the gas jet in the bar before stalking moodily upstairs to his own room , his landlord called him by his name . Now as he had never told it to the man , but had scrupulously kept it to himself , he was not a little startled by this ; and so plainly showed his agitation that the landlord , to reassure him , said ‘
116842	116843	115051	115051	you	864	’ ‘
116847	116851	116853	116855	Mr Martin Chuzzlewit	2909	’ cried Martin . ‘
116857	116873	117466	117466	I	0	’ said the landlord , reading the superscription of one he held in his hand . ‘
116881	117462	117466	117466	I	0	’ Martin took it from him , thanked him , and walked upstairs . It was not sealed , but pasted close ; the handwriting was quite unknown to him . He opened it and found enclosed , without any name , address , or other inscription or explanation of any kind whatever , a Bank of England note for Twenty Pounds . To say that he was perfectly stunned with astonishment and delight ; that he looked again and again at the note and the wrapper ; that he hurried below stairs to make quite certain that the note was a good note ; and then hurried up again to satisfy himself for the fiftieth time that he had not overlooked some scrap of writing on the wrapper ; that he exhausted and bewildered himself with conjectures ; and could make nothing of it but that there the note was , and he was suddenly enriched ; would be only to relate so many matters of course to no purpose . The final upshot of the business at that time was , that he resolved to treat himself to a comfortable but frugal meal in his own chamber ; and having ordered a fire to be kindled , went out to purchase it forthwith . He bought some cold beef , and ham , and French bread , and butter , and came back with his pockets pretty heavily laden . It was somewhat of a damping circumstance to find the room full of smoke , which was attributable to two causes ; firstly , to the flue being naturally vicious and a smoker ; and secondly , to their having forgotten , in lighting the fire , an odd sack or two and some trifles , which had been put up the chimney to keep the rain out . They had already remedied this oversight , however ; and propped up the window - sash with a bundle of firewood to keep it open ; so that except in being rather inflammatory to the eyes and choking to the lungs , the apartment was quite comfortable . Martin was in no vein to quarrel with it , if it had been in less tolerable order , especially when a gleaming pint of porter was set upon the table , and the servant - girl withdrew , bearing with her particular instructions relative to the production of something hot when he should ring the bell . The cold meat being wrapped in a playbill , Martin laid the cloth by spreading that document on the little round table with the print downwards , and arranging the collation upon it . The foot of the bed , which was very close to the fire , answered for a sideboard ; and when he had completed these preparations , he squeezed an old arm - chair into the warmest corner , and sat down to enjoy himself . He had begun to eat with great appetite , glancing round the room meanwhile with a triumphant anticipation of quitting it for ever on the morrow , when his attention was arrested by a stealthy footstep on the stairs , and presently by a knock at his chamber door , which , although it was a gentle knock enough , communicated such a start to the bundle of firewood , that it instantly leaped out of window , and plunged into the street . ‘
117469	117473	117466	117466	I	0	’ said Martin . ‘
117477	117478	117502	117502	sir	864	’ ‘
117491	117498	117513	117513	Martin	221	’ rejoined a man ’s voice . ‘
117506	117512	117547	117548	his visitor	9196	’re pretty well , sir . ’
117540	117545	117547	117548	his visitor	9196	‘ Tapley , sir , ’
117550	117576	117584	117584	Martin	221	‘ Him as formerly lived at the Dragon , sir , and was forced to leave in consequence of a want of jollity , sir . ’
117577	117582	117584	117584	Martin	221	‘ To be sure ! ’
117586	117595	117611	117611	Mark	222	‘ Why , how did you come here ? ’
117596	117609	117626	117626	Martin	221	‘ Right through the passage , and up the stairs , sir , ’
117613	117624	117635	117635	Mark	222	‘ How did you find me out , I mean ? ’
117628	117633	117635	117635	Mark	222	‘ Why , sir , ’
117637	117651	117695	117695	you	864	‘ I ’ve passed you once or twice in the street , if I ’m
117701	117717	117695	117695	you	864	’ Martin reddened as he pointed to the table , and said , somewhat hastily : ‘
117723	117724	117736	117736	I	0	’ ‘
117731	117735	117744	117744	I	0	’ said Mark , ‘
117746	117759	117778	117778	Martin	221	‘ em downstairs that you expected me , I was let up . ’
117760	117776	117790	117790	Mark	222	‘ Are you charged with any message , that you told them you were expected ? ’
117780	117788	117790	117790	Mark	222	‘ No , sir , I an’t , ’
117792	117808	117876	117876	he	222	‘ That was what you may call a pious fraud , sir , that was . ’
117872	117875	117876	117876	he	222	‘ Tapley , ’
117879	117929	117876	117876	he	222	‘ I ’ll deal openly with you . From all I can judge and from all I have heard of you through Pinch , you are not a likely kind of fellow to have been brought here by impertinent curiosity or any other offensive motive . Sit down . I ’m

117941	117945	117946	117946	I	0	’ said Mark . ‘

117961	117965	117966	117966	I	0	’ retorted Martin , ‘
117973	117974	117978	117978	sir	864	’ ‘
117980	117984	118009	118009	yourself	10358	’ observed Mark . ‘
117997	118007	118024	118024	sir	864	’ and he sat down accordingly upon the bedstead . ‘
118011	118021	118024	118024	sir	864	’ said Martin , handing him the only knife . ‘
118026	118030	118024	118024	sir	864	’ rejoined Mark . ‘
118036	118037	118024	118024	sir	864	’ ‘
118052	118056	118060	118060	sir	864	’ said Martin . ‘

118076	118104	118107	118107	you	864	’ With which reply he gravely helped himself and went on eating . Martin having done the like for a short time in silence , said abruptly : ‘
118112	118113	118118	118118	sir	864	’ ‘
118120	118124	118134	118134	I	0	’ rejoined Mark . ‘
118129	118133	118144	118144	I	0	’ asked Martin . ‘
118139	118143	118152	118152	Martin	221	’ said Mark . ‘
118145	118150	118164	118164	Mark	222	’m sorry for you , ’
118154	118162	118185	118185	He	222	‘ --To attend upon a single gentleman , ’
118166	118184	118192	118192	Martin	221	‘ If from the country the more desirable . Makeshifts would be preferred . Wages no object . ’
118201	118206	118217	118217	Mark	222	‘ If you mean me-- ’
118207	118215	118217	118217	Mark	222	‘ Yes , I do , sir , ’
118219	118250	118258	118258	Mark	222	‘ Then you may judge from my style of living here , of my means of keeping a man - servant . Besides , I am going to America immediately . ’
118251	118256	118295	118295	Martin	221	‘ Well , sir , ’
118265	118293	118321	118321	Mark	222	‘ from all that ever I heard about it , I should say America is a very likely sort of place for me to be jolly in ! ’
118312	118319	118321	118321	Mark	222	‘ Lord bless you , sir , ’
118323	118501	118511	118511	Martin	221	‘ what is the use of us a - going round and round , and hiding behind the corner , and dodging up and down , when we can come straight to the point in six words ? I ’ve had my eye upon you any time this fortnight . I see well enough there ’s a screw loose in your affairs . I know’d well enough the first time I see you down at the Dragon that it must be so , sooner or later . Now , sir here am I , without a sitiwation ; without any want of wages for a year to come ; for I saved up ( I did n’t mean to do it , but I could n’t help it ) at the Dragon -- here am I with a liking for what ’s wentersome , and a liking for you , and a wish to come out strong under circumstances as would keep other men down ; and will you take me , or will you leave me ? ’
118502	118509	118521	118521	Mark	222	‘ How can I take you ? ’
118513	118519	118521	118521	Mark	222	‘ When I say take , ’
118523	118660	118671	118673	a drowned man	2928	‘ I mean will you let me go ? and when I say will you let me go , I mean will you let me go along with you ? for go I will , somehow or another . Now that you ’ve said America , I see clear at once , that that ’s the place for me to be jolly in . Therefore , if I do n’t pay my own passage in the ship you go in , sir , I ’ll pay my own passage in another . And mark my words , if I go alone it shall be , to carry out the principle , in the rottenest , craziest , leakingest tub of a wessel that a place can be got in for love or money . So if I ’m
118695	118696	118671	118673	a drowned man	2928	’ ‘
118702	118706	118717	118717	I	0	’ said Martin . ‘
118712	118716	118671	118673	a drowned man	2928	’ returned Mark . ‘
118718	118787	118717	118717	I	0	’m glad to hear it , because if you do n’t mean to let me go , you ’ll be more comfortable , perhaps , on account of thinking so . Therefore I contradict no gentleman . But all I say is , that if I do n’t emigrate to America in that case , in the beastliest old cockle - shell as goes out of port , I’m-- ’
118788	118798	118717	118717	I	0	‘ You do n’t mean what you say , I ’m
118801	118805	118807	118807	I	0	’ said Martin . ‘
118810	118814	118815	118815	I	0	’ cried Mark . ‘
118822	118826	118830	118830	sir	864	’ rejoined Martin . ‘
118832	118844	118967	118967	Mark	222	’ said Mark , with the same air of perfect satisfaction . ‘
118910	118962	118967	118967	Mark	222	’ This was touching Martin on his weak point , and having him at a great advantage . He could not help thinking , either , what a brisk fellow this Mark was , and how great a change he had wrought in the atmosphere of the dismal little room already . ‘
118969	118973	119003	119003	you	0	’ he said , ‘
118999	119000	119003	119003	you	0	’ ‘
119008	119013	119003	119003	you	0	’ returned Mark Tapley . ‘
119018	119019	119003	119003	you	0	’ ‘
119023	119040	119088	119088	I	0	’ said Martin , leaning his chin upon his hand , and looking at the fire , ‘
119086	119087	119088	119088	I	0	’ ‘
119094	119098	119120	119120	I	0	’ observed Mark , ‘
119125	119226	119234	119234	you	0	’ Martin glanced at him hastily , not feeling quite free from a suspicion that this remark implied a doubt of the successful issue of his plans . But Mr Tapley was eating the boiled beef and bread with such entire good faith and singleness of purpose expressed in his visage that he could not but be satisfied . Another doubt arose in his mind however , as this one disappeared . He produced the blank cover in which the note had been enclosed , and fixing his eyes on Mark as he put it in his hands , said : ‘
119240	119305	119338	119338	Tapley	309	’ Mark turned it over and over ; held it near his eyes ; held it away from him at arm ’s length ; held it with the superscription upwards and with the superscription downwards ; and shook his head with such a genuine expression of astonishment at being asked the question , that Martin said , as he took it from him again : ‘
119340	119350	119388	119388	I	0	’ he added , after a moment ’s thought , ‘
119386	119387	119388	119388	I	0	’ ‘
119395	119399	119490	119490	Mark	222	’ said Mark ; ‘
119465	119488	119490	119490	Mark	222	’re certain to get to the top of , take me along with you at a respectful distance ? Now , sir , ’
119492	119532	119581	119581	Martin	221	‘ it ’s of very little importance to you , I know , there ’s the difficulty ; but it ’s of very great importance to me , and will you be so good as to consider of it ? ’
119604	119627	119635	119635	Mark	222	‘ We ’ll see about it , Tapley . You shall tell me in what disposition you find yourself to - morrow . ’
119628	119633	119635	119635	Mark	222	‘ Then , sir , ’
119641	119657	119635	119635	Mark	222	‘ the job ’s done . Go on , sir , if you please . I ’m
119661	119838	119635	119635	Mark	222	’ Throwing himself back in his arm - chair , and looking at the fire , with now and then a glance at Mark , who at such times nodded his head sagely , to express his profound interest and attention . Martin ran over the chief points in his history , to the same effect as he had related them , weeks before , to Mr Pinch . But he adapted them , according to the best of his judgment , to Mr Tapley ’s comprehension ; and with that view made as light of his love affair as he could , and referred to it in very few words . But here he reckoned without his host ; for Mark ’s interest was keenest in this part of the business , and prompted him to ask sundry questions in relation to it ; for which he apologised as one in some measure privileged to do so , from having seen ( as Martin explained to him ) the young lady at the Blue Dragon . ‘
119857	119863	119635	119635	Mark	222	’ said Mark , energetically , ‘
119869	119870	119873	119873	You	2950	’ ‘
119882	119892	119897	119897	her	2949	’ said Martin , gazing at the fire again . ‘
119904	119905	119908	119908	she	2949	’ ‘
119931	119935	119994	119994	sir	864	’ said Mark , ‘
119960	119989	119994	119994	sir	864	’ Martin withdrew his eyes from the fire ; stared at Mark as if he thought he had suddenly gone mad ; and asked him what he meant . ‘
119996	120000	120016	120016	I	0	’ urged Mark . ‘
120027	120028	120030	120030	you	864	’ ‘
120041	120054	120057	120057	I	0	’ asked Martin , rising hurriedly , and pushing back his chair . ‘
120060	120074	120076	120076	you	864	’ said Mark , rising too , in great amazement from the bedstead . ‘
120087	120088	120098	120098	she	2949	’ ‘
120104	120105	120107	120107	you	864	’ ‘
120111	120112	120107	120107	you	864	’ ‘
120115	120119	120124	120124	you	864	’ cried Mark . ‘

120132	120142	120124	120124	you	864	’ exclaimed Martin , clutching him by both arms , ‘
120156	120157	120124	120124	you	864	’ ‘
120162	120213	120429	120430	Mr Tapley	309	’ cried Mark , giving the little table such a blow with his clenched fist that the slices of beef and ham danced upon it , while all his features seemed , with delight , to be going up into his forehead , and never coming back again any more , ‘
120233	120427	120429	120430	Mr Tapley	309	’ as a Blue Dragon . What ! when I was a - rambling up and down a old churchyard in the City , getting myself into a jolly state , did n’t I see your grandfather a - toddling to and fro for pretty nigh a mortal hour ! Did n’t I watch him into Todgers ’s commercial boarding - house , and watch him out , and watch him home to his hotel , and go and tell him as his was the service for my money , and I had said so , afore I left the Dragon ! Was n’t the young lady a - sitting with him then , and did n’t she fall a - laughing in a manner as was beautiful to see ! Did n’t your grandfather say , “ Come back again next week , ” and did n’t I go next week ; and did n’t he say that he could n’t make up his mind to trust nobody no more ; and therefore would n’t engage me , but at the same time stood something to drink as was handsome ! Why , ’
120441	120468	120543	120543	Mark	222	‘ where ’s the credit of a man ’s being jolly under such circumstances ! Who could help it , when things come about like this ! ’
120534	120541	120543	120543	Mark	222	‘ Do I think I can ? ’
120545	120563	120628	120628	Mark	222	‘ THINK I can ? Here , sit down , sir . Write it out , sir ! ’
120620	120626	120628	120628	Mark	222	‘ Cut away , sir ! ’
120630	120661	120734	120734	Mark	222	‘ Make it strong , sir . Let it be wery pinted , sir . Do I think so ? I should think so . Go to work , sir ! ’
120726	120732	120734	120734	Mark	222	‘ Jolly sort of lodgings , ’
120758	120830	120734	120734	Mark	222	‘ that ’s a comfort . The rain ’s come through the roof too . That an’t bad . A lively old bedstead , I ’ll be bound ; popilated by lots of wampires , no doubt . Come ! my spirits is a - getting up again . An uncommon ragged nightcap this . A very good sign . We shall do yet ! Here , Jane , my dear , ’
120836	120862	120734	120734	Mark	222	‘ bring up that there hot tumbler for my master as was a - mixing when I come in . That ’s right , sir , ’
120866	120898	121211	121211	Martin	221	‘ Go at it as if you meant it , sir . Be very tender , sir , if you please . You ca n’t make it too strong , sir ! ’
121205	121210	121211	121211	Martin	221	‘ Fine weather indeed , ’
121215	121273	121379	121379	Mary	253	‘ to be wandering up and down here in , like a thief ! Fine weather indeed , for a meeting of lovers in the open air , and in a public walk ! I need be departing , with all speed , for another country ; for I have come to a pretty pass in this ! ’
121372	121377	121388	121388	Martin	221	‘ My dear Martin , ’
121381	121386	121460	121460	Martin	221	‘ My dear Mary , ’
121443	121458	121465	121465	he	221	‘ If you have changed at all , my love , since we parted , ’
121474	121485	121806	121806	she	9059	‘ it is only to be more beautiful than ever ! ’
121795	121805	121806	121806	she	9059	‘ What change is there in YOU , Martin , ’
121809	121827	121840	121840	Martin	221	‘ for that concerns me nearest ? You look more anxious and more thoughtful than you used . ’
121828	121838	121864	121865	Mr Tapley	309	‘ Why , as to that , my love , ’
121874	121898	121908	121908	she	9059	‘ it would be strange if I did not ; for my life -- especially of late -- has been a hard one . ’
121899	121907	121864	121865	Mr Tapley	309	‘ I know it must have been , ’
121911	121923	121933	121933	Martin	221	‘ When have I forgotten to think of it and you ? ’
121924	121931	121933	121933	Martin	221	‘ Not often , I hope , ’
121935	121978	121988	121988	she	9059	‘ Not often , I am sure . Not often , I have some right to expect , Mary ; for I have undergone a great deal of vexation and privation , and I naturally look for that return , you know . ’
121979	121987	121988	121988	she	9059	‘ A very , very poor return , ’
121995	122033	122046	122046	Martin	221	‘ But you have it , and will have it always . You have paid a dear price for a poor heart , Martin ; but it is at least your own , and a true one . ’
122034	122044	122112	122112	he	221	‘ Of course I feel quite certain of that , ’
122048	122111	122112	122112	he	221	‘ or I should n’t have put myself in my present position . And do n’t say a poor heart , Mary , for I say a rich one . Now , I am about to break a design to you , dearest , which will startle you at first , but which is undertaken for your sake . I am going , ’
122128	122131	121988	121988	she	9059	‘ abroad . ’
122132	122137	122112	122112	he	221	‘ Abroad , Martin ! ’
122138	122151	122170	122170	she	9059	‘ Only to America . See now . How you droop directly ! ’
122152	122169	122170	122170	she	9059	‘ If I do , or , I hope I may say , if I did , ’
122189	122260	122268	122268	Martin	221	‘ it was for grief to think of what you are resolved to undergo for me . I would not venture to dissuade you , Martin ; but it is a long , long distance ; there is a wide ocean to be crossed ; illness and want are sad calamities in any place , but in a foreign country dreadful to endure . Have you thought of all this ? ’
122261	122266	122372	122372	he	221	‘ Thought of it ! ’
122292	122371	122372	122372	he	221	‘ What am I to do ? It ’s very well to say , “ Have I thought of it ? ” my love ; but you should ask me in the same breath , have I thought of starving at home ; have I thought of doing porter ’s work for a living ; have I thought of holding horses in the streets to earn my roll of bread from day to day ? Come , come , ’
122380	122417	122426	122426	she	2991	‘ do not hang down your head , my dear , for I need the encouragement that your sweet face alone can give me . Why , that ’s well ! Now you are brave again . ’
122418	122425	122465	122465	Martin	221	‘ I am endeavouring to be , ’
122434	122463	122498	122498	She	2991	‘ Endeavouring to be anything that ’s good , and being it , is , with you , all one . Do n’t I know that of old ? ’
122469	122497	122524	122524	Martin	221	‘ So ! That ’s famous ! Now I can tell you all my plans as cheerfully as if you were my little wife already , Mary . ’
122518	122522	122524	122524	Martin	221	‘ You see , ’
122535	122603	122524	122524	Martin	221	‘ that my attempts to advance myself at home have been baffled and rendered abortive . I will not say by whom , Mary , for that would give pain to us both . But so it is . Have you heard him speak of late of any relative of mine or his , called Pecksniff ? Only tell me what I ask you , no more . ’
122604	122623	122631	122631	Martin	221	‘ I have heard , to my surprise , that he is a better man than was supposed . ’
122624	122629	122631	122631	Martin	221	‘ I thought so , ’
122633	122671	122679	122679	Martin	221	‘ And that it is likely we may come to know him , if not to visit and reside with him and -- I think -- his daughters . He HAS daughters , has he , love ? ’
122672	122678	122679	122679	Martin	221	‘ A pair of them , ’
122682	122693	122524	122524	Martin	221	‘ A precious pair ! Gems of the first water ! ’
122694	122701	122725	122725	Martin	221	‘ Ah ! You are jesting ! ’
122702	122723	122725	122725	Martin	221	‘ There is a sort of jesting which is very much in earnest , and includes some pretty serious disgust , ’
122727	122810	122524	122524	Martin	221	‘ I jest in reference to Mr Pecksniff ( at whose house I have been living as his assistant , and at whose hands I have received insult and injury ) , in that vein . Whatever betides , or however closely you may be brought into communication with this family , never forget that , Mary ; and never for an instant , whatever appearances may seem to contradict me , lose sight of this assurance -- Pecksniff is a scoundrel . ’
122811	122814	122900	122900	He	2992	‘ Indeed ! ’
122815	122899	122929	122929	Mark	222	‘ In thought , and in deed , and in everything else . A scoundrel from the topmost hair of his head , to the nethermost atom of his heel . Of his daughters I will only say that , to the best of my knowledge and belief , they are dutiful young ladies , and take after their father closely . This is a digression from the main point , and yet it brings me to what I was going to say . ’
122953	123075	123114	123114	He	2996	‘ Now I am going to America , with great prospects of doing well , and of returning home myself very soon ; it may be to take you there for a few years , but , at all events , to claim you for my wife ; which , after such trials , I should do with no fear of your still thinking it a duty to cleave to him who will not suffer me to live ( for this is true ) , if he can help it , in my own land . How long I may be absent is , of course , uncertain ; but it shall not be very long . Trust me for that . ’
123076	123083	123114	123114	He	2996	‘ In the meantime , dear Martin-- ’
123084	123113	123114	123114	He	2996	‘ That ’s the very thing I am coming to . In the meantime you shall hear , constantly , of all my goings - on . Thus . ’
123132	123224	123114	123114	He	2996	‘ In this fellow ’s employment , and living in this fellow ’s house ( by fellow , I mean Mr Pecksniff , of course ) , there is a certain person of the name of Pinch . Do n’t forget ; a poor , strange , simple oddity , Mary ; but thoroughly honest and sincere ; full of zeal ; and with a cordial regard for me . Which I mean to return one of these days , by setting him up in life in some way or other . ’
123225	123233	123239	123239	Martin	221	‘ Your old kind nature , Martin ! ’
123234	123237	123239	123239	Martin	221	‘ Oh ! ’
123241	123359	123368	123368	Mary	253	‘ that ’s not worth speaking of , my love . He ’s very grateful and desirous to serve me ; and I am more than repaid . Now one night I told this Pinch my history , and all about myself and you ; in which he was not a little interested , I can tell you , for he knows you ! Aye , you may look surprised -- and the longer the better for it becomes you -- but you have heard him play the organ in the church of that village before now ; and he has seen you listening to his music ; and has caught his inspiration from you , too ! ’
123360	123366	123368	123368	Mary	253	‘ Was HE the organist ? ’
123370	123378	123387	123387	Martin	221	‘ I thank him from my heart ! ’
123379	123385	123387	123387	Martin	221	‘ Yes , he was , ’
123389	123424	123433	123433	she	253	‘ and is , and gets nothing for it either . There never was such a simple fellow ! Quite an infant ! But a very good sort of creature , I assure you . ’
123425	123432	123433	123433	she	253	‘ I am sure of that , ’
123439	123444	123459	123459	Martin	221	‘ He must be ! ’
123445	123457	123520	123520	Martin	221	‘ Oh , yes , no doubt at all about it , ’
123467	123518	123520	123520	Martin	221	‘ He is . Well ! It has occurred to me -- but stay . If I read you what I have written and intend sending to him by post to - night it will explain itself . “ My dear Tom Pinch . ” That ’s rather familiar perhaps , ’
123534	123553	123564	123564	Mary	253	‘ but I call him my dear Tom Pinch because he likes it , and it pleases him . ’
123554	123562	123572	123572	Martin	221	‘ Very right , and very kind , ’
123566	123570	123681	123681	Martin	221	‘ Exactly so ! ’
123574	123679	123681	123681	Martin	221	‘ It ’s as well to be kind whenever one can ; and , as I said before , he really is an excellent fellow . “ My dear Tom Pinch -- I address this under cover to Mrs Lupin , at the Blue Dragon , and have begged her in a short note to deliver it to you without saying anything about it elsewhere ; and to do the same with all future letters she may receive from me . My reason for so doing will be at once apparent to you”--I do n’t know that it will be , by the bye , ’
123686	123736	123744	123744	Mary	253	‘ for he ’s slow of comprehension , poor fellow ; but he ’ll find it out in time . My reason simply is , that I do n’t want my letters to be read by other people ; and particularly by the scoundrel whom he thinks an angel . ’
123737	123742	123752	123752	Martin	221	‘ Mr Pecksniff again ? ’
123746	123750	123813	123813	Martin	221	‘ The same , ’
123753	123811	123813	123813	Martin	221	‘ --will be at once apparent to you . I have completed my arrangements for going to America ; and you will be surprised to hear that I am to be accompanied by Mark Tapley , upon whom I have stumbled strangely in London , and who insists on putting himself under my protection’--meaning , my love , ’
123819	123829	123920	123920	Martin	221	‘ our friend in the rear , of course . ’
123909	123918	123920	123920	Martin	221	‘ “ Now , my dear Pinch , ” ’
123927	123965	123886	123886	she	253	‘ “ I am going to repose great trust in you , knowing that I may do so with perfect reliance on your honour and secrecy , and having nobody else just now to trust in . ” ’
123966	123978	123920	123920	Martin	221	‘ I do n’t think I would say that , Martin . ’
123979	123999	123920	123920	Martin	221	‘ Would n’t you ? Well ! I ’ll take that out . It ’s perfectly true , though . ’
124000	124009	124021	124021	Martin	221	‘ But it might seem ungracious , perhaps . ’
124010	124019	124021	124021	Martin	221	‘ Oh , I do n’t mind Pinch , ’
124023	124075	123920	123920	Martin	221	‘ There ’s no occasion to stand on any ceremony with HIM . However , I ’ll take it out , as you wish it , and make the full stop at “ secrecy . ” Very well ! “ I shall not only”--this is the letter again , you know . ’
124076	124080	124214	124214	Martin	221	‘ I understand . ’
124081	124212	124214	124214	Martin	221	‘ “ I shall not only enclose my letters to the young lady of whom I have told you , to your charge , to be forwarded as she may request ; but I most earnestly commit her , the young lady herself , to your care and regard , in the event of your meeting in my absence . I have reason to think that the probabilities of your encountering each other -- perhaps very frequently -- are now neither remote nor few ; and although in our position you can do very little to lessen the uneasiness of hers , I trust to you implicitly to do that much , and so deserve the confidence I have reposed in you . ” You see , my dear Mary , ’
124216	124281	124289	124289	she	3000	‘ it will be a great consolation to you to have anybody , no matter how simple , with whom you can speak about ME ; and the very first time you talk to Pinch , you ’ll feel at once that there is no more occasion for any embarrassment or hesitation in talking to him , than if he were an old woman . ’
124282	124288	124289	124289	she	3000	‘ However that may be , ’
124294	124305	124318	124318	Martin	221	‘ he is your friend , and that is enough . ’
124306	124316	124318	124318	Martin	221	‘ Oh , yes , he ’s my friend , ’
124320	124418	124289	124289	she	3000	‘ certainly . In fact , I have told him in so many words that we ’ll always take notice of him , and protect him ; and it ’s a good trait in his character that he ’s grateful -- very grateful indeed . You ’ll like him of all things , my love , I know . You ’ll observe very much that ’s comical and old - fashioned about Pinch , but you need n’t mind laughing at him ; for he ’ll not care about it . He ’ll rather like it indeed ! ’
124419	124434	124449	124449	he	3001	‘ I do n’t think I shall put that to the test , Martin . ’
124435	124448	124600	124600	Martin	221	‘ You wo n’t if you can help it , of course , ’
124452	124598	124600	124600	Martin	221	‘ but I think you ’ll find him a little too much for your gravity . However , that ’s neither here nor there , and it certainly is not the letter ; which ends thus : “ Knowing that I need not impress the nature and extent of that confidence upon you at any greater length , as it is already sufficiently established in your mind , I will only say , in bidding you farewell and looking forward to our next meeting , that I shall charge myself from this time , through all changes for the better , with your advancement and happiness , as if they were my own . You may rely upon that . And always believe me , my dear Tom Pinch , faithfully your friend , Martin Chuzzlewit . P.S.--I enclose the amount which you so kindly”--Oh , ’
124611	124616	124653	124653	Mark	222	‘ that ’s nothing ! ’
124639	124651	124653	124653	Mark	222	‘ Which I should n’t have said nothing about , sir , ’
124655	124671	124678	124678	Mary	253	‘ if the young lady had n’t begged me to be particular in mentioning it . ’
124672	124676	124678	124678	Mary	253	‘ I did , ’
124680	124750	124756	124756	Martin	221	‘ Thank you . You are quite right . In another minute I shall be ready to return . We have time for a very few words more , dear Martin , and although I had much to say , it must remain unsaid until the happy time of our next meeting . Heaven send it may come speedily and prosperously ! But I have no fear of that . ’
124751	124754	124756	124756	Martin	221	‘ Fear ! ’
124758	124845	124678	124678	Mary	253	‘ Why , who has ? What are a few months ? What is a whole year ? When I come gayly back , with a road through life hewn out before me , then indeed , looking back upon this parting , it may seem a dismal one . But now ! I swear I would n’t have it happen under more favourable auspices , if I could ; for then I should be less inclined to go , and less impressed with the necessity . ’
124846	124861	124934	124934	his	221	‘ Yes , yes . I feel that too . When do you go ? ’
124862	124921	124931	124931	Mary	253	‘ To - night . We leave for Liverpool to - night . A vessel sails from that port , as I hear , in three days . In a month , or less , we shall be there . Why , what ’s a month ! How many months have flown by , since our last parting ! ’
124922	124929	124931	124931	Mary	253	‘ Long to look back upon , ’
124938	124945	124953	124953	Martin	221	‘ but nothing in their course ! ’
124946	124951	125003	125003	he	221	‘ Nothing at all ! ’
124955	125001	125048	125048	his	221	‘ I shall have change of scene and change of place ; change of people , change of manners , change of cares and hopes ! Time will wear wings indeed ! I can bear anything , so that I have swift action , Mary . ’
125057	125059	125209	125210	Mr Tapley	309	‘ self ’
125201	125207	125228	125228	she	253	‘ The quarter ’s gone ! ’
125218	125227	125228	125228	she	253	‘ I shall be ready to return immediately , ’
125231	125327	125339	125339	Martin	221	‘ One thing , dear Martin , I am bound to tell you . You entreated me a few minutes since only to answer what you asked me in reference to one theme , but you should and must know ( otherwise I could not be at ease ) that since that separation of which I was the unhappy occasion , he has never once uttered your name ; has never coupled it , or any faint allusion to it , with passion or reproach ; and has never abated in his kindness to me . ’
125328	125337	125339	125339	Martin	221	‘ I thank him for that last act , ’
125341	125423	125228	125228	she	253	‘ and for nothing else . Though on consideration I may thank him for his other forbearance also , inasmuch as I neither expect nor desire that he will mention my name again . He may once , perhaps -- to couple it with reproach -- in his will . Let him , if he please ! By the time it reaches me , he will be in his grave ; a satire on his own anger , God help him ! ’
125424	125509	125339	125339	Martin	221	‘ Martin ! If you would but sometimes , in some quiet hour ; beside the winter fire ; in the summer air ; when you hear gentle music , or think of Death , or Home , or Childhood ; if you would at such a season resolve to think , but once a month , or even once a year , of him , or any one who ever wronged you , you would forgive him in your heart , I know ! ’
125510	125521	125641	125641	he	3006	‘ If I believed that to be true , Mary , ’
125525	125640	125641	125641	he	3006	‘ I would resolve at no such time to bear him in my mind ; wishing to spare myself the shame of such a weakness . I was not born to be the toy and puppet of any man , far less his ; to whose pleasure and caprice , in return for any good he did me , my whole youth was sacrificed . It became between us two a fair exchange -- a barter -- and no more ; and there is no such balance against me that I need throw in a mawkish forgiveness to poise the scale . He has forbidden all mention of me to you , I know , ’
125645	125652	125228	125228	she	253	‘ Come ! Has he not ? ’
125653	125659	125228	125228	she	253	‘ That was long ago , ’
125663	125683	125700	125700	Martin	221	‘ immediately after your parting ; before you had left the house . He has never done so since . ’
125684	125698	125700	125700	Martin	221	‘ He has never done so since because he has seen no occasion , ’
125702	125835	125228	125228	she	253	‘ but that is of little consequence , one way or other . Let all allusion to him between you and me be interdicted from this time forth . And therefore , love’--he drew her quickly to him , for the time of parting had now come--‘in the first letter that you write to me through the Post Office , addressed to New York ; and in all the others that you send through Pinch ; remember he has no existence , but has become to us as one who is dead . Now , God bless you ! This is a strange place for such a meeting and such a parting ; but our next meeting shall be in a better , and our next and last parting in a worse . ’
125836	125855	125862	125862	Martin	221	‘ One other question , Martin , I must ask . Have you provided money for this journey ? ’
125856	125860	125877	125877	his	221	‘ Have I ? ’
125886	125917	125228	125228	she	253	‘ Have I provided money ? Why , there ’s a question for an emigrant ’s wife ! How could I move on land or sea without it , love ? ’
125918	125924	125877	125877	his	221	‘ I mean , enough . ’
125925	125968	125981	125982	Mr Tapley	309	‘ Enough ! More than enough . Twenty times more than enough . A pocket - full . Mark and I , for all essential ends , are quite as rich as if we had the purse of Fortunatus in our baggage . ’
125969	125979	125994	125994	Mary	253	‘ The half - hour ’s a - going ! ’
125984	125992	126275	126275	Mark	222	‘ Good - bye a hundred times ! ’
126262	126267	126275	126275	Mark	222	‘ Well , Mark ! ’
126268	126273	126275	126275	Mark	222	‘ Well , sir , ’
126282	126312	126275	126275	Mark	222	‘ I see the young lady safe home , and I feel pretty comfortable after it . She sent a lot of kind words , sir , and this , ’
126318	126324	126330	126330	Martin	221	‘ for a parting keepsake . ’
126325	126328	126381	126382	Mark Tapley	222	‘ Diamonds ! ’
126359	126380	126540	126540	Martin	221	‘ Splendid diamonds ! My grandfather is a singular character , Mark . He must have given her this now . ’
126527	126538	126540	126540	Martin	221	‘ She is worthy of the sacrifices I have made , ’
126564	126647	126751	126751	his	222	‘ Well worthy of them . No riches’--here he stroked his chin and mused--‘could have compensated for the loss of such a nature . Not to mention that in gaining her affection I have followed the bent of my own wishes , and baulked the selfish schemes of others who had no right to form them . She is quite worthy -- more than worthy -- of the sacrifices I have made . Yes , she is . No doubt of it . ’

130392	130397	130405	130406	the man	1838	’ said Mr Tapley , ‘

130429	130433	130539	130539	you	3147	’ asked Martin , ‘

130582	130587	130671	130671	you	3147	’ returned his master . ‘
130673	130763	130857	130859	a good fellow	1654	’ he asked , sitting upright in his berth and looking at Mark , with an expression of great earnestness not unmixed with wonder . Mark twisted his face into a tight knot , and with his head very much on one side , pondered upon this question as if he felt it an extremely difficult one to answer . He was relieved from his embarrassment by Martin himself , who said , as he stretched himself upon his back again and resumed the book he had been reading : ‘
130861	131534	130857	130859	a good fellow	1654	’ Mr Tapley set himself to obey these orders with great alacrity , and pending their execution , it may be presumed his flagging spirits revived ; inasmuch as he several times observed , below his breath , that in respect of its power of imparting a credit to jollity , the Screw unquestionably had some decided advantages over the Dragon . He also remarked that it was a high gratification to him to reflect that he would carry its main excellence ashore with him , and have it constantly beside him wherever he went ; but what he meant by these consolatory thoughts he did not explain . And now a general excitement began to prevail on board ; and various predictions relative to the precise day , and even the precise hour at which they would reach New York , were freely broached . There was infinitely more crowding on deck and looking over the ship ’s side than there had been before ; and an epidemic broke out for packing up things every morning , which required unpacking again every night . Those who had any letters to deliver , or any friends to meet , or any settled plans of going anywhere or doing anything , discussed their prospects a hundred times a day ; and as this class of passengers was very small , and the number of those who had no prospects whatever was very large , there were plenty of listeners and few talkers . Those who had been ill all along , got well now , and those who had been well , got better . An American gentleman in the after - cabin , who had been wrapped up in fur and oilskin the whole passage , unexpectedly appeared in a very shiny , tall , black hat , and constantly overhauled a very little valise of pale leather , which contained his clothes , linen , brushes , shaving apparatus , books , trinkets , and other baggage . He likewise stuck his hands deep into his pockets , and walked the deck with his nostrils dilated , as already inhaling the air of Freedom which carries death to all tyrants , and can never ( under any circumstances worth mentioning ) be breathed by slaves . An English gentleman who was strongly suspected of having run away from a bank , with something in his possession belonging to its strong box besides the key , grew eloquent upon the subject of the rights of man , and hummed the Marseillaise Hymn constantly . In a word , one great sensation pervaded the whole ship , and the soil of America lay close before them ; so close at last , that , upon a certain starlight night they took a pilot on board , and within a few hours afterwards lay to until the morning , awaiting the arrival of a steamboat in which the passengers were to be conveyed ashore . Off she came , soon after it was light next morning , and lying alongside an hour or more -- during which period her very firemen were objects of hardly less interest and curiosity than if they had been so many angels , good or bad -- took all her living freight aboard . Among them Mark , who still had his friend and her three children under his close protection ; and Martin , who had once more dressed himself in his usual attire , but wore a soiled , old cloak above his ordinary clothes , until such time as he should separate for ever from his late companions . The steamer -- which , with its machinery on deck , looked , as it worked its long slim legs , like some enormously magnified insect or antediluvian monster -- dashed at great speed up a beautiful bay ; and presently they saw some heights , and islands , and a long , flat , straggling city . ‘
131538	131547	131560	131560	I	0	’ said Mr Tapley , looking far ahead , ‘

133963	133986	134938	134938	sir	864	’ said the colonel , turning to Martin , and drawing a flourish on the surface of the deck with his cane , ‘
133999	134430	134938	134938	sir	864	’ The captain , who had the Sewer below at that moment , lunching expensively in one cabin , while the amiable Stabber was drinking himself into a state of blind madness in another , took a cordial leave of his friend the colonel , and hurried away to dispatch the champagne ; well knowing ( as it afterwards appeared ) that if he failed to conciliate the editor of the Rowdy Journal , that potentate would denounce him and his ship in large capitals before he was a day older ; and would probably assault the memory of his mother also , who had not been dead more than twenty years . The colonel being again left alone with Martin , checked him as he was moving away , and offered in consideration of his being an Englishman , to show him the town and to introduce him , if such were his desire , to a genteel boarding - house . But before they entered on these proceedings ( he said ) , he would beseech the honour of his company at the office of the Rowdy Journal , to partake of a bottle of champagne of his own importation . All this was so extremely kind and hospitable , that Martin , though it was quite early in the morning , readily acquiesced . So , instructing Mark , who was deeply engaged with his friend and her three children , that when he had done assisting them , and had cleared the baggage , he was to wait for further orders at the Rowdy Journal Office , Martin accompanied his new friend on shore . They made their way as they best could through the melancholy crowd of emigrants upon the wharf , who , grouped about their beds and boxes , with the bare ground below them and the bare sky above , might have fallen from another planet , for anything they knew of the country ; and walked for some short distance along a busy street , bounded on one side by the quays and shipping ; and on the other by a long row of staring red - brick storehouses and offices , ornamented with more black boards and white letters , and more white boards and black letters , than Martin had ever seen before , in fifty times the space . Presently they turned up a narrow street , and presently into other narrow streets , until at last they stopped before a house whereon was painted in great characters , ‘
134434	134742	134938	134938	sir	864	’ The colonel , who had walked the whole way with one hand in his breast , his head occasionally wagging from side to side , and his hat thrown back upon his ears , like a man who was oppressed to inconvenience by a sense of his own greatness , led the way up a dark and dirty flight of stairs into a room of similar character , all littered and bestrewn with odds and ends of newspapers and other crumpled fragments , both in proof and manuscript . Behind a mangy old writing - table in this apartment sat a figure with a stump of a pen in its mouth and a great pair of scissors in its right hand , clipping and slicing at a file of Rowdy Journals ; and it was such a laughable figure that Martin had some difficulty in preserving his gravity , though conscious of the close observation of Colonel Diver . The individual who sat clipping and slicing as aforesaid at the Rowdy Journals , was a small young gentleman of very juvenile appearance , and unwholesomely pale in the face ; partly , perhaps , from intense thought , but partly , there is no doubt , from the excessive use of tobacco , which he was at that moment chewing vigorously . He wore his shirt - collar turned down over a black ribbon ; and his lank hair , a fragile crop , was not only smoothed and parted back from his brow , that none of the Poetry of his aspect might be lost , but had , here and there , been grubbed up by the roots ; which accounted for his loftiest developments being somewhat pimply . He had that order of nose on which the envy of mankind has bestowed the appellation ‘
134745	134933	134940	134942	Mr Jefferson Brick	379	’ and it was very much turned up at the end , as with a lofty scorn . Upon the upper lip of this young gentleman were tokens of a sandy down ; so very , very smooth and scant , that , though encouraged to the utmost , it looked more like a recent trace of gingerbread than the fair promise of a moustache ; and this conjecture , his apparently tender age went far to strengthen . He was intent upon his work . Every time he snapped the great pair of scissors , he made a corresponding motion with his jaws , which gave him a very terrible appearance . Martin was not long in determining within himself that this must be Colonel Diver ’s son ; the hope of the family , and future mainspring of the Rowdy Journal . Indeed he had begun to say that he presumed this was the colonel ’s little boy , and that it was very pleasant to see him playing at Editor in all the guilelessness of childhood , when the colonel proudly interposed and said : ‘
134944	135020	135028	135028	I	0	’ Martin could not help starting at this unexpected announcement , and the consciousness of the irretrievable mistake he had nearly made . Mr Brick seemed pleased with the sensation he produced upon the stranger , and shook hands with him , with an air of patronage designed to reassure him , and to let him blow that there was no occasion to be frightened , for he ( Brick ) would n’t hurt him . ‘
135033	135042	135063	135063	you	864	’ quoth the colonel , with a smile . ‘
135069	135070	135063	135063	you	864	’ ‘
135075	135079	135063	135063	you	864	’ said Martin . ‘
135084	135105	135142	135142	my	0	’ repeated the colonel , thoughtfully ; as he took his seat upon the table , and swung his legs . ‘

135145	135149	135150	135150	I--	0	’ said Martin , ‘

135240	135263	135285	135285	Brick	379	’ said Mr Brick , putting on a little blue cloth cap with a glazed front , and quoting his last article . ‘
135273	135283	135295	135295	he	379	‘ --Must sometimes be quaffed in blood , colonel , ’

135354	135372	135378	135379	the colonel	3206	‘ I ca n’t give you any satisfactory information about it ; for the truth is that I-- ’
135373	135376	135378	135379	the colonel	3206	‘ Stop ! ’
135397	135446	135461	135461	Martin	221	‘ That you never heard of Jefferson Brick , sir . That you never read Jefferson Brick , sir . That you never saw the Rowdy Journal , sir . That you never knew , sir , of its mighty influence upon the cabinets of Europe . Yes ? ’
135447	135459	135471	135472	the colonel	3206	‘ That ’s what I was about to observe , certainly , ’
135463	135469	135471	135472	the colonel	3206	‘ Keep cool , Jefferson , ’
135475	135495	135534	135535	the colonel	3206	‘ Do n’t bust ! oh you Europeans ! After that , let ’s have a glass of wine ! ’
135525	135532	135534	135535	the colonel	3206	‘ Mr Jefferson Brick , sir , ’
135553	135560	135568	135570	the war correspondent	3255	‘ will give us a sentiment . ’
135561	135566	135568	135570	the war correspondent	3255	‘ Well , sir ! ’
135572	135614	135630	135630	her	11224	‘ Since you have concluded to call upon me , I will respond . I will give you , sir , The Rowdy Journal and its brethren ; the well of Truth , whose waters are black from being composed of printers ’
135635	135636	135630	135630	her	11224	’ ‘
135641	135650	135656	135656	sir	864	’ cried the colonel , with great complacency . ‘
135665	135666	135656	135656	sir	864	’ ‘
135673	135677	135686	135686	sir	864	’ said Martin . ‘
135688	135698	135702	135703	Jefferson Brick	379	’ observed the colonel , handing him a paper . ‘
135718	135797	135702	135703	Jefferson Brick	379	’ The colonel was by this time seated on the table again . Mr Brick also took up a position on that same piece of furniture ; and they fell to drinking pretty hard . They often looked at Martin as he read the paper , and then at each other . When he laid it down , which was not until they had finished a second bottle , the colonel asked him what he thought of it . ‘
135805	135825	135831	135831	sir	864	’ said Martin . The colonel seemed much flattered by this remark ; and said he hoped it was . ‘
135833	135839	135840	135840	We	3260	’ said Mr Jefferson Brick . ‘

135856	135860	135878	135878	they	3262	’ returned Martin , ‘

135900	135905	135894	135896	the Popular Instructor	3265	’ said the colonel . ‘

135952	135957	135894	135896	the Popular Instructor	3265	’ suggested Mr Brick . ‘
135963	135968	135894	135896	the Popular Instructor	3265	’ remarked the colonel . ‘
135971	135979	136102	136103	the colonel	3206	’ said Martin , after some hesitation , ‘
136030	136046	136064	136064	sir	864	’ he pursued , for the colonel was perfectly calm and quite at his ease , ‘
136060	136061	136064	136064	sir	864	’ ‘
136066	136071	136064	136064	sir	864	’ replied the colonel . ‘

136091	136095	136102	136103	the colonel	3206	’ asked Martin . ‘

136204	136208	136209	136209	You	3269	’ thought Martin . ‘

136232	136253	136268	136268	I	0	’ said the colonel , stooping down to roll the third empty bottle into a corner after the other two , ‘

136272	136276	136283	136283	I	0	’ replied Martin . ‘

136627	136632	136725	136726	The colonel	3206	‘ whipped the universe . ’

136838	136842	136872	136873	Jefferson Brick	379	‘ The master ! ’
136857	136870	136872	136873	Jefferson Brick	379	‘ Oh ! The depressing institutions of that British empire , colonel ! ’
136875	136878	136890	136890	Martin	221	‘ Master ! ’
136879	136888	136912	136913	Jefferson Brick	379	‘ What ’s the matter with the word ? ’
136892	136910	136912	136913	Jefferson Brick	379	‘ I should hope it was never heard in our country , sir ; that ’s all , ’
136915	136948	136960	136960	Martin	221	‘ except when it is used by some degraded Help , as new to the blessings of our form of government , as this Help is . There are no masters here . ’
136949	136958	137442	137444	Mr Jefferson Brick--	379	‘ All “ owners , ” are they ? ’
137445	137450	137462	137463	the colonel	3206	‘ Well , colonel ! ’
137451	137461	137462	137463	the colonel	3206	‘ Here is a gentleman from England , major , ’
137466	137482	137495	137496	the major	11357	‘ who has concluded to locate himself here if the amount of compensation suits him . ’
137483	137493	137509	137509	his	221	‘ I am glad to see you , sir , ’
137512	137521	137528	137528	Martin	221	‘ You are pretty bright , I hope ? ’
137522	137526	137540	137541	the major	11357	‘ Never better , ’
137530	137538	137540	137541	the major	11357	‘ You are never likely to be , ’
137543	137552	137569	137569	Martin	221	‘ You will see the sun shine HERE . ’
137553	137567	137580	137581	the major	11357	‘ I think I remember to have seen it shine at home sometimes , ’
137573	137578	137790	137792	Mr Jefferson Brick	379	‘ I think not , ’
137804	137817	137921	137923	a bold speculator	3358	‘ One of the most remarkable men in our country , sir ! ’
137896	137909	138197	138198	the major	11357	‘ run a moist pen slick through everything , and start fresh . ’
138167	138169	138197	138198	the major	11357	‘ loafed ’

138200	138206	138221	138223	Mr Jefferson Brick	379	‘ At an alarming crisis , ’
138211	138219	138235	138235	Martin	221	‘ At a period of unprecedented stagnation , ’
138225	138233	138235	138235	Martin	221	‘ I am sorry to hear that , ’
138237	138248	138351	138351	Martin	221	‘ It ’s not likely to last , I hope ? ’
138338	138349	138358	138359	the major	11357	‘ It ’s not likely to last , I hope ? ’
138353	138356	138358	138359	the major	11357	‘ Well ! ’
138361	138377	138387	138389	the Rowdy Journal	69	‘ I expect we shall get along somehow , and come right in the end . ’
138378	138385	138400	138402	Mr Jefferson Brick	379	‘ We are an elastic country , ’
138391	138398	138416	138417	the major	11357	‘ We are a young lion , ’
138404	138414	138431	138432	The colonel	3206	‘ We have revivifying and vigorous principles within ourselves , ’
138419	138430	138468	138468	He	3206	‘ Shall we drink a bitter afore dinner , colonel ? ’
138460	138467	139080	139080	Kernell	386	‘ only in the next block . ’
138751	138912	139080	139080	Kernell	386	’ business tour , and who , as his outfit and equipment for this journey , had just such another shiny hat and just such another little pale valise as had composed the luggage of the gentleman who came from England in the Screw . They were walking back very leisurely ; Martin arm - in - arm with Mr Jefferson Brick , and the major and the colonel side - by - side before them ; when , as they came within a house or two of the major ’s residence , they heard a bell ringing violently . The instant this sound struck upon their ears , the colonel and the major darted off , dashed up the steps and in at the street - door ( which stood ajar ) like lunatics ; while Mr Jefferson Brick , detaching his arm from Martin ’s , made a precipitate dive in the same direction , and vanished also . ‘
138916	138920	139080	139080	Kernell	386	’ thought Martin . ‘
138933	139051	139080	139080	Kernell	386	’ But there was no smoke to be seen , nor any flame , nor was there any smell of fire . As Martin faltered on the pavement , three more gentlemen , with horror and agitation depicted in their faces , came plunging wildly round the street corner ; jostled each other on the steps ; struggled for an instant ; and rushed into the house , a confused heap of arms and legs . Unable to bear it any longer , Martin followed . Even in his rapid progress he was run down , thrust aside , and passed , by two more gentlemen , stark mad , as it appeared , with fierce excitement . ‘
139056	139072	139101	139101	Martin	221	’ cried Martin , breathlessly , to a negro whom he encountered in the passage . ‘
139088	139094	139101	139101	Martin	221	‘ side himself , sa . ’
139095	139099	139101	139101	Martin	221	‘ A seat ! ’
139103	139110	139147	139147	his	3400	‘ For a dinnar , sa . ’
139156	139158	139147	139147	his	3400	‘ You ’re
139167	139176	139147	139147	his	3400	’ said Martin clapping him on the back , ‘
139186	139609	139147	139147	his	3400	’ With this sentiment he walked into the dining - room and slipped into a chair next the colonel , which that gentleman ( by this time nearly through his dinner ) had turned down in reserve for him , with its back against the table . It was a numerous company -- eighteen or twenty perhaps . Of these some five or six were ladies , who sat wedged together in a little phalanx by themselves . All the knives and forks were working away at a rate that was quite alarming ; very few words were spoken ; and everybody seemed to eat his utmost in self - defence , as if a famine were expected to set in before breakfast time to - morrow morning , and it had become high time to assert the first law of nature . The poultry , which may perhaps be considered to have formed the staple of the entertainment -- for there was a turkey at the top , a pair of ducks at the bottom , and two fowls in the middle -- disappeared as rapidly as if every bird had had the use of its wings , and had flown in desperation down a human throat . The oysters , stewed and pickled , leaped from their capacious reservoirs , and slid by scores into the mouths of the assembly . The sharpest pickles vanished , whole cucumbers at once , like sugar - plums , and no man winked his eye . Great heaps of indigestible matter melted away as ice before the sun . It was a solemn and an awful thing to see . Dyspeptic individuals bolted their food in wedges ; feeding , not themselves , but broods of nightmares , who were continually standing at livery within them . Spare men , with lank and rigid cheeks , came out unsatisfied from the destruction of heavy dishes , and glared with watchful eyes upon the pastry . What Mrs Pawkins felt each day at dinner - time is hidden from all human knowledge . But she had one comfort . It was very soon over . When the colonel had finished his dinner , which event took place while Martin , who had sent his plate for some turkey , was waiting to begin , he asked him what he thought of the boarders , who were from all parts of the Union , and whether he would like to know any particulars concerning them . ‘
139612	139616	139635	139636	anybody here	3403	’ said Martin , ‘
139653	139654	139656	139656	you	0	’ ‘
139665	139673	139676	139678	Mrs Jefferson Brick	387	’ asked the colonel , with emphasis . ‘
139682	139683	139676	139678	Mrs Jefferson Brick	387	’ ‘
139688	139692	139695	139697	the little girl	3408	’ said Martin , ‘
139706	139707	139710	139710	sir	864	’ ‘
139712	139717	139720	139722	Mrs Jefferson Brick	387	’ cried the colonel . ‘
139724	139739	139749	139751	a young Brick	3410	’ Martin glanced at the colonel ’s face , but he was quite serious . ‘
139759	139763	139771	139771	sir	864	’ said Martin . ‘
139773	139797	139800	139800	sir	864	’ returned the colonel . The matron looked so uncommonly like a child herself , that Martin could not help saying as much . ‘
139802	139807	139823	139824	Jefferson Brick	387	’ returned the colonel , ‘
139821	139822	139823	139824	Jefferson Brick	387	’ ‘
139826	139840	139879	139880	Mr Brick	379	’ he observed after a short silence , in commendation of his correspondent , ‘
139854	139876	139879	139880	Mr Brick	379	’ This had passed almost in a whisper , for the distinguished gentleman alluded to sat on Martin ’s other hand . ‘
139882	139909	139879	139880	Mr Brick	379	’ said Martin , turning to him , and asking a question more for conversation ’s sake than from any feeling of interest in its subject , ‘
139914	139920	139879	139880	Mr Brick	379	’ he was going to say ‘
139922	139941	139954	139954	Jefferson	379	’ but thought it prudent to eschew the word--‘that very short gentleman yonder , with the red nose ? ’
139942	139952	139968	139968	Martin	221	‘ That is Pro -- fessor Mullit , sir , ’
139956	139966	139978	139979	Jefferson Brick	379	‘ May I ask what he is professor of ? ’
139970	139976	139990	139990	Martin	221	‘ Of education , sir , ’
139981	139989	140014	140016	the war correspondent	3255	‘ A sort of schoolmaster , possibly ? ’
139995	140012	140014	140016	the war correspondent	3255	‘ He is a man of fine moral elements , sir , and not commonly endowed , ’
140018	140079	139968	139968	Martin	221	‘ He felt it necessary , at the last election for President , to repudiate and denounce his father , who voted on the wrong interest . He has since written some powerful pamphlets , under the signature of “ Suturb , ” or Brutus reversed . He is one of the most remarkable men in our country , sir . ’
140080	140087	139968	139968	Martin	221	‘ There seem to be plenty of ‘
140090	140094	139968	139968	Martin	221	’ thought Martin , ‘
140099	140398	140421	140421	sir	864	’ Pursuing his inquiries Martin found that there were no fewer than four majors present , two colonels , one general , and a captain , so that he could not help thinking how strongly officered the American militia must be ; and wondering very much whether the officers commanded each other ; or if they did not , where on earth the privates came from . There seemed to be no man there without a title ; for those who had not attained to military honours were either doctors , professors , or reverends . Three very hard and disagreeable gentlemen were on missions from neighbouring States ; one on monetary affairs , one on political , one on sectarian . Among the ladies , there were Mrs Pawkins , who was very straight , bony , and silent ; and a wiry - faced old damsel , who held strong sentiments touching the rights of women , and had diffused the same in lectures ; but the rest were strangely devoid of individual traits of character , insomuch that any one of them might have changed minds with the other , and nobody would have found it out . These , by the way , were the only members of the party who did not appear to be among the most remarkable people in the country . Several of the gentlemen got up , one by one , and walked off as they swallowed their last morsel ; pausing generally by the stove for a minute or so to refresh themselves at the brass spittoons . A few sedentary characters , however , remained at table full a quarter of an hour , and did not rise until the ladies rose , when all stood up . ‘
140404	140416	140421	140421	sir	864	’ asked Martin , in the ear of Mr Jefferson Brick . ‘
140423	140424	140452	140452	We	3423	’ ‘
140436	140451	140454	140456	a busy people	3424	’ asked Martin , who was disposed to enjoy himself after his long voyage . ‘
140468	140891	141109	141118	one of the captains , who was from the West	3435	’ was the reply . So the ladies passed out in single file ; Mr Jefferson Brick and such other married gentlemen as were left , acknowledging the departure of their other halves by a nod ; and there was an end of THEM . Martin thought this an uncomfortable custom , but he kept his opinion to himself for the present , being anxious to hear , and inform himself by , the conversation of the busy gentlemen , who now lounged about the stove as if a great weight had been taken off their minds by the withdrawal of the other sex ; and who made a plentiful use of the spittoons and their toothpicks . It was rather barren of interest , to say the truth ; and the greater part of it may be summed up in one word . Dollars . All their cares , hopes , joys , affections , virtues , and associations , seemed to be melted down into dollars . Whatever the chance contributions that fell into the slow cauldron of their talk , they made the gruel thick and slab with dollars . Men were weighed by their dollars , measures gauged by their dollars ; life was auctioneered , appraised , put up , and knocked down for its dollars . The next respectable thing to dollars was any venture having their attainment for its end . The more of that worthless ballast , honour and fair - dealing , which any man cast overboard from the ship of his Good Name and Good Intent , the more ample stowage - room he had for dollars . Make commerce one huge lie and mighty theft . Deface the banner of the nation for an idle rag ; pollute it star by star ; and cut out stripe by stripe as from the arm of a degraded soldier . Do anything for dollars ! What is a flag to THEM ! One who rides at all hazards of limb and life in the chase of a fox , will prefer to ride recklessly at most times . So it was with these gentlemen . He was the greatest patriot , in their eyes , who brawled the loudest , and who cared the least for decency . He was their champion who , in the brutal fury of his own pursuit , could cast no stigma upon them for the hot knavery of theirs . Thus , Martin learned in the five minutes ’
141093	141097	141111	141112	the captains	3436	‘ a screamer . ’
141098	141107	141111	141112	the captains	3436	‘ We are a busy people , sir , ’
141120	141134	141109	141118	one of the captains , who was from the West	3435	‘ and have no time for reading mere notions . We do n’t mind ‘
141157	141190	141192	141193	any gentleman	9325	’ Here the general , who appeared to grow quite faint at the bare thought of reading anything which was neither mercantile nor political , and was not in a newspaper , inquired ‘
141198	141283	141192	141193	any gentleman	9325	’ Most of the company , considering this a very choice and seasonable idea , lounged out , one by one , to the bar - room in the next block . Thence they probably went to their stores and counting - houses ; thence to the bar - room again , to talk once more of dollars , and enlarge their minds with the perusal and discussion of screamers ; and thence each man to snore in the bosom of his own family . ‘
141288	141300	141592	141592	I	0	’ said Martin , pursuing the current of his own thoughts , ‘
141311	141591	141616	141616	you	0	’ With that , he fell a - musing again on dollars , demagogues , and bar - rooms ; debating within himself whether busy people of this class were really as busy as they claimed to be , or only had an inaptitude for social and domestic pleasure . It was a difficult question to solve ; and the mere fact of its being strongly presented to his mind by all that he had seen and heard , was not encouraging . He sat down at the deserted board , and becoming more and more despondent , as he thought of all the uncertainties and difficulties of his precarious situation , sighed heavily . Now , there had been at the dinner - table a middle - aged man with a dark eye and a sunburnt face , who had attracted Martin ’s attention by having something very engaging and honest in the expression of his features ; but of whom he could learn nothing from either of his neighbours , who seemed to consider him quite beneath their notice . He had taken no part in the conversation round the stove , nor had he gone forth with the rest ; and now , when he heard Martin sigh for the third or fourth time , he interposed with some casual remark , as if he desired , without obtruding himself upon a stranger ’s notice , to engage him in cheerful conversation if he could . His motive was so obvious , and yet so delicately expressed , that Martin felt really grateful to him , and showed him so in the manner of his reply . ‘
141598	141614	141649	141649	I	0	’ said this gentleman with a smile , as he rose and moved towards him , ‘
141659	141660	141661	141661	You	0	’ ‘
141667	141671	141698	141698	his	3206	’ returned Martin , ‘
141720	141739	141698	141698	his	3206	’ he added , remembering that the colonel had whispered him to that effect , before going out . ‘
141744	141750	141827	141827	My	0	’ said the stranger drily . ‘
141817	141826	141827	141827	My	0	’ he added , seeing that Martin reddened . ‘
141831	141840	141852	141852	I	0	’ returned Martin , as they shook hands , ‘
141855	141856	141852	141852	I	0	’ ‘
141859	141869	141878	141878	I	0	’ said the gentleman , sitting down beside him . ‘
141883	141894	141878	141878	I	0	’ said Martin , getting the better of his hesitation , ‘
141904	141905	141908	141908	He	3453	’ ‘
141916	141922	142028	142028	I	0	’ remarked the gentleman quietly . ‘
142026	142027	142028	142028	I	0	’ ‘
142035	142039	142075	142075	he	3461	’ said Martin , ‘
142063	142067	142075	142075	he	3461	‘ Go on , ’
142084	142087	142075	142075	he	3461	‘ Especially , ’
142091	142128	142075	142075	he	3461	‘ as I can already understand that it may have required great courage , even in his time , to write freely on any question which was not a party one in this very free country . ’
142129	142136	142075	142075	he	3461	‘ Some courage , no doubt , ’
142142	142156	142171	142171	Martin	221	‘ Do you think it would require any to do so , now ? ’
142157	142169	142171	142171	Martin	221	‘ Indeed I think it would ; and not a little , ’
142173	142346	142358	142358	Martin	221	‘ You are right . So very right , that I believe no satirist could breathe this air . If another Juvenal or Swift could rise up among us to - morrow , he would be hunted down . If you have any knowledge of our literature , and can give me the name of any man , American born and bred , who has anatomized our follies as a people , and not as this or that party ; and who has escaped the foulest and most brutal slander , the most inveterate hatred and intolerant pursuit ; it will be a strange name in my ears , believe me . In some cases I could name to you , where a native writer has ventured on the most harmless and good - humoured illustrations of our vices or defects , it has been found necessary to announce , that in a second edition the passage has been expunged , or altered , or explained away , or patched into praise . ’
142347	142356	142383	142384	his friend	9006	‘ And how has this been brought about ? ’
142363	142381	142383	142384	his friend	9006	‘ Think of what you have seen and heard to - day , beginning with the colonel , ’
142386	142435	142657	142657	Martin	221	‘ and ask yourself . How THEY came about , is another question . Heaven forbid that they should be samples of the intelligence and virtue of America , but they come uppermost , and in great numbers , and too often represent it . Will you walk ? ’
142568	142609	142815	142815	Martin	221	‘ Oh , but for such , Columbia ’s days were done ; Rank without ripeness , quickened without sun , Crude at the surface , rotten at the core , Her fruits would fall before her spring were o’er ! ’
142807	142813	142815	142815	Martin	221	‘ And speaking of business , ’
142817	142855	142862	142863	his friend	9006	‘ may I ask , in order that I may not be behind - hand with questions either , whether your occupation holds you to this city , or like myself , you are a visitor here ? ’
142856	142860	142815	142815	Martin	221	‘ A visitor , ’
142865	142918	142927	142927	Martin	221	‘ I was “ raised ” in the State of Massachusetts , and reside there still . My home is in a quiet country town . I am not often in these busy places ; and my inclination to visit them does not increase with our better acquaintance , I assure you . ’
142919	142925	142927	142927	Martin	221	‘ You have been abroad ? ’
142929	142933	142958	142958	Martin	221	‘ Oh yes . ’
142934	142956	142973	142974	his friend	9006	‘ And , like most people who travel , have become more than ever attached to your home and native country , ’
142964	142971	142973	142974	his friend	9006	‘ To my home -- yes , ’
142976	142989	142998	142998	Martin	221	‘ To my native country AS my home -- yes , also . ’
142990	142996	142998	142998	Martin	221	‘ You imply some reservation , ’
143000	143003	142998	142998	Martin	221	‘ Well , ’
143009	143109	143115	143115	Martin	221	‘ if you ask me whether I came back here with a greater relish for my country ’s faults ; with a greater fondness for those who claim ( at the rate of so many dollars a day ) to be her friends ; with a cooler indifference to the growth of principles among us in respect of public matters and of private dealings between man and man , the advocacy of which , beyond the foul atmosphere of a criminal trial , would disgrace your own old Bailey lawyers ; why , then I answer plainly , No . ’
143110	143113	143143	143144	his companion	8974	‘ Oh ! ’
143136	143142	143143	143144	his companion	8974	‘ If you ask me , ’
143147	143280	143283	143283	Martin	221	‘ whether I came back here better satisfied with a state of things which broadly divides society into two classes -- whereof one , the great mass , asserts a spurious independence , most miserably dependent for its mean existence on the disregard of humanizing conventionalities of manner and social custom , so that the coarser a man is , the more distinctly it shall appeal to his taste ; while the other , disgusted with the low standard thus set up and made adaptable to everything , takes refuge among the graces and refinements it can bring to bear on private life , and leaves the public weal to such fortune as may betide it in the press and uproar of a general scramble -- then again I answer , No . ’
143285	143288	143333	143334	the other	934	‘ Oh ! ’
143326	143331	143333	143334	the other	934	‘ In a word , ’
143336	143405	143413	143413	Martin	221	‘ I do not find and can not believe and therefore will not allow , that we are a model of wisdom , and an example to the world , and the perfection of human reason , and a great deal more to the same purpose , which you may hear any hour in the day ; simply because we began our political life with two inestimable advantages . ’
143406	143411	143333	143334	the other	934	‘ What were they ? ’
143415	143494	143500	143500	Martin	221	‘ One , that our history commenced at so late a period as to escape the ages of bloodshed and cruelty through which other nations have passed ; and so had all the light of their probation , and none of its darkness . The other , that we have a vast territory , and not -- as yet -- too many people on it . These facts considered , we have done little enough , I think . ’
143495	143498	143513	143514	the other	934	‘ Education ? ’
143504	143511	143584	143584	he	934	‘ Pretty well on that head , ’
143520	143583	143612	143612	Martin	221	‘ still no mighty matter to boast of ; for old countries , and despotic countries too , have done as much , if not more , and made less noise about it . We shine out brightly in comparison with England , certainly ; but hers is a very extreme case . You complimented me on my frankness , you know , ’
143589	143610	143612	143612	Martin	221	‘ Oh ! I am not at all astonished at your speaking thus openly when my country is in question , ’
143614	143630	143690	143690	he	221	‘ It is your plain - speaking in reference to your own that surprises me . ’
143631	143689	143690	143690	he	221	‘ You will not find it a scarce quality here , I assure you , saving among the Colonel Divers , and Jefferson Bricks , and Major Pawkinses ; though the best of us are something like the man in Goldsmith ’s comedy , who would n’t suffer anybody but himself to abuse his master . Come ! ’
143693	143752	143984	143984	he	221	‘ Let us talk of something else . You have come here on some design of improving your fortune , I dare say ; and I should grieve to put you out of heart . I am some years older than you , besides ; and may , on a few trivial points , advise you , perhaps . ’

144338	144348	144307	144307	Mark	222	‘ Nothing gone wrong , I hope , sir ? ’
144349	144359	144369	144370	Mr Tapley	309	‘ No , Mark . Where ’s your friend ? ’
144360	144367	144369	144370	Mr Tapley	309	‘ The mad woman , sir ? ’
144372	144382	144307	144307	Mark	222	‘ Oh ! she ’s all right , sir . ’
144383	144390	144405	144405	Mark	222	‘ Did she find her husband ? ’
144391	144403	144405	144405	Mark	222	‘ Yes , sir . Leastways she ’s found his remains , ’
144410	144420	144307	144307	Mark	222	‘ The man ’s not dead , I hope ? ’
144421	144428	144307	144307	Mark	222	‘ Not altogether dead , sir , ’
144432	144472	144307	144307	Mark	222	‘ but he ’s had more fevers and agues than is quite reconcilable with being alive . When she did n’t see him a - waiting for her , I thought she ’d have died herself , I did ! ’
144473	144481	144405	144405	Mark	222	‘ Was he not here , then ? ’
144482	144567	144576	144577	Mr Bevan	220	‘ HE was n’t here . There was a feeble old shadow come a - creeping down at last , as much like his substance when she know’d him , as your shadow when it ’s drawn out to its very finest and longest by the sun , is like you . But it was his remains , there ’s no doubt about that . She took on with joy , poor thing , as much as if it had been all of him ! ’
144568	144574	144589	144589	Mark	222	‘ Had he bought land ? ’
144579	144587	144589	144589	Mark	222	‘ Ah ! He ’d bought land , ’
144595	144631	144649	144649	Martin	221	‘ and paid for it too . Every sort of nateral advantage was connected with it , the agents said ; and there certainly was ONE , quite unlimited . No end to the water ! ’
144632	144647	144649	144649	Martin	221	‘ It ’s a thing he could n’t have done without , I suppose , ’
144653	144728	144736	144736	Martin	221	‘ Certainly not , sir . There it was , any way ; always turned on , and no water - rate . Independent of three or four slimy old rivers close by , it varied on the farm from four to six foot deep in the dry season . He could n’t say how deep it was in the rainy time , for he never had anything long enough to sound it with . ’

144749	144760	144766	144766	Mark	222	‘ Some Mississippi or Missouri lot , I dare say . ’
144761	144764	144746	144746	he	221	‘ However , ’
144768	144845	144854	144854	Martin	221	‘ he came from I - don’t - know - where - and - all , down to New York here , to meet his wife and children ; and they started off again in a steamboat this blessed afternoon , as happy to be along with each other as if they were going to Heaven .

144912	144922	144924	144924	Martin	221	‘ Do you take me for a blind man , ’
144929	144951	144967	144967	Mark	222	‘ that you think it necessary to tell me that , when his face is the blackest that ever was seen ? ’
144952	144965	145001	145002	Mr Tapley	309	‘ No , no ; when I say a man of colour , ’
144969	144999	145029	145029	Martin	221	‘ I mean that he ’s been one of them as there ’s picters of in the shops . A man and a brother , you know , sir , ’

145524	145528	145556	145556	em	3518	’ he added , ‘
145530	145555	145567	145567	they	3518	’re so fond of Liberty in this part of the globe , that they buy her and sell her and carry her to market with ‘

145589	145599	145630	145631	Mrs Pawkins	383	’ said Martin , wishing to change the theme . ‘
145636	145637	145638	145639	Mrs Pawkins	383	’ ‘
145645	145649	145652	145652	Cicero	396	’ repeated Mark . ‘

145661	145664	145758	145758	Mark	222	’ asked Martin ‘
145672	145757	145768	145768	You	3524	’ rejoined Mark . And the negro grinning assent from under a leathern portmanteau , than which his own face was many shades deeper , hobbled downstairs with his portion of their worldly goods ; Mark Tapley having already gone before with his share . Martin and his friend followed them to the door below , and were about to pursue their walk , when the latter stopped , and asked , with some hesitation , whether that young man was to be trusted ? ‘
145766	145767	145783	145783	He	222	’ ‘
145797	145798	145783	145783	He	222	’ ‘
145805	145811	145829	145829	I	0	’ said Martin , smiling , ‘
145827	145828	145829	145829	I	0	’ ‘
145838	145843	145903	145903	I	0	’ returned the other . ‘
145913	146295	146418	146419	the second	3541	’ Martin called to him immediately to be of their party ; so Cicero and the truck went one way , and they three went another . They walked about the city for two or three hours ; seeing it from the best points of view , and pausing in the principal streets , and before such public buildings as Mr Bevan pointed out . Night then coming on apace , Martin proposed that they should adjourn to Mrs Pawkins ’s establishment for coffee ; but in this he was overruled by his new acquaintance , who seemed to have set his heart on carrying him , though it were only for an hour , to the house of a friend of his who lived hard by . Feeling ( however disinclined he was , being weary ) that it would be in bad taste , and not very gracious , to object that he was unintroduced , when this open - hearted gentleman was so ready to be his sponsor , Martin -- for once in his life , at all events -- sacrificed his own will and pleasure to the wishes of another , and consented with a fair grace . So travelling had done him that much good , already . Mr Bevan knocked at the door of a very neat house of moderate size , from the parlour windows of which , lights were shining brightly into the now dark street . It was quickly opened by a man with such a thoroughly Irish face , that it seemed as if he ought , as a matter of right and principle , to be in rags , and could have no sort of business to be looking cheerfully at anybody out of a whole suit of clothes . Commending Mark to the care of this phenomenon -- for such he may be said to have been in Martin ’s eyes -- Mr Bevan led the way into the room which had shed its cheerfulness upon the street , to whose occupants he introduced Mr Chuzzlewit as a gentleman from England , whose acquaintance he had recently had the pleasure to make . They gave him welcome in all courtesy and politeness ; and in less than five minutes ’
146401	146408	146754	146754	they	9305	’ father , and the young ladies ’
146769	146775	146791	146791	they	9305	‘ Was he quite well ? ’
146779	146788	146791	146791	they	9305	‘ Yes , oh yes . Never better ; ’
146794	146808	146809	146809	Martin	221	‘ his lordship ’s mother , the duchess , was she much changed ? ’
146812	146831	146898	146899	the exotics	3561	‘ Oh dear no , they would know her anywhere , if they saw her to - morrow ; ’
146901	146923	147218	147219	Mr Norris	397	‘ Oh ! well ! it was of no use talking about THEM ; they must be seen to be believed ; ’
147225	147250	147567	147568	Mr Norris	397	‘ that person entertained religious opinions of which he could n’t approve ; and therefore he had n’t the honour of knowing the gentleman . ’
147561	147565	147567	147568	Mr Norris	397	‘ In short , ’
147577	147587	147593	147593	Martin	221	‘ there is a natural antipathy between the races . ’
147588	147591	147593	147593	Martin	221	‘ Extending , ’
147602	147618	147968	147970	many other travellers	3612	‘ to the cruellest of tortures , and the bargain and sale of unborn generations . ’
147980	148028	148034	148034	My	0	‘ specially genteel abroad . There is little doubt that in course of time the Misses Norris would have come to Hebrew , if they had not been interrupted by an announcement from the Irishman , who , flinging open the door , cried in a loud voice-- ‘
148032	148033	148045	148046	The general	9448	’ ‘
148036	148044	148045	148046	The general	9448	’ cried the sisters , desisting suddenly . ‘
148050	148390	148393	148393	I	0	’ As they made the exclamation , the general , attired in full uniform for a ball , came darting in with such precipitancy that , hitching his boot in the carpet , and getting his sword between his legs , he came down headlong , and presented a curious little bald place on the crown of his head to the eyes of the astonished company . Nor was this the worst of it ; for being rather corpulent and very tight , the general being down , could not get up again , but lay there writhing and doing such things with his boots , as there is no other instance of in military history . Of course there was an immediate rush to his assistance ; and the general was promptly raised . But his uniform was so fearfully and wonderfully made , that he came up stiff and without a bend in him like a dead Clown , and had no command whatever of himself until he was put quite flat upon the soles of his feet , when he became animated as by a miracle , and moving edgewise that he might go in a narrower compass and be in less danger of fraying the gold lace on his epaulettes by brushing them against anything , advanced with a smiling visage to salute the lady of the house . To be sure , it would have been impossible for the family to testify purer delight and joy than at this unlooked - for appearance of General Fladdock ! The general was as warmly received as if New York had been in a state of siege and no other general was to be got for love or money . He shook hands with the Norrises three times all round , and then reviewed them from a little distance as a brave commander might , with his ample cloak drawn forward over the right shoulder and thrown back upon the left side to reveal his manly breast . ‘
148396	148401	148393	148393	I	0	’ cried the general , ‘
148412	148413	148393	148393	I	0	’ ‘
148416	148423	148428	148428	general	3618	’ said Mr Norris the father . ‘
148430	148506	148527	148527	I	0	’ Then all the Norrises pressed round the general , inquiring how and where he had been since the date of his letter , and how he had enjoyed himself in foreign parts , and particularly and above all , to what extent he had become acquainted with the great dukes , lords , viscounts , marquesses , duchesses , knights , and baronets , in whom the people of those benighted countries had delight . ‘
148516	148526	148579	148580	Mr Norris	397	’ said the general , holding up his hand . ‘
148530	148573	148579	148580	Mr Norris	397	‘ em all the time , and have got public journals in my trunk with my name printed’--he lowered his voice and was very impressive here--‘among the fashionable news . But , oh , the conventionalities of that a - mazing Europe ! ’
148574	148577	148597	148597	he	9377	‘ Ah ! ’
148601	148616	148631	148632	the general	9448	‘ I ca n’t deny it , sir . I would if I could . ’
148617	148629	148631	148632	the general	9448	‘ The limited diffusion of a moral sense in that country ! ’
148634	148644	148650	148652	all the Norrises	11660	‘ The absence of a moral dignity in man ! ’
148645	148648	148669	148670	the general	9448	‘ Ah ! ’
148659	148667	148669	148670	the general	9448	‘ I could n’t have realised it , ’
148672	148707	148713	148714	Mr Norris	397	‘ without being located on the spot . Norris , your imagination is the imagination of a strong man , but YOU could n’t have realised it , without being located on the spot ! ’
148708	148711	148733	148734	the general	9448	‘ Never , ’
148716	148731	148733	148734	the general	9448	‘ The ex - clusiveness , the pride , the form , the ceremony , ’
148745	148784	148790	148792	the whole family	9305	‘ The artificial barriers set up between man and man ; the division of the human race into court cards and plain cards , of every denomination -- into clubs , diamonds , spades -- anything but heart ! ’
148785	148788	148790	148792	the whole family	9305	‘ Ah ! ’
148794	148800	148807	148808	Mr Norris	397	‘ Too true , general ! ’
148801	148805	148807	148808	Mr Norris	397	‘ But stay ! ’
148818	148828	148790	148792	the whole family	9305	‘ Surely you crossed in the Screw , general ? ’
148829	148836	148846	148848	the young ladies	930	‘ Well ! so I did , ’
148841	148844	148846	148848	the young ladies	930	‘ Possible ! ’
148850	148854	148888	148889	Mr Norris	397	‘ Only think ! ’
148898	148909	148916	148917	the general	9448	‘ A fellow - passenger of yours , I think ? ’
148910	148914	148916	148917	the general	9448	‘ Of mine ? ’
148919	148922	149005	149005	Martin	221	‘ No ! ’
148991	149003	149005	149005	Martin	221	‘ I came over in the same ship as the general , ’
149007	149033	149374	149374	his	221	‘ but not in the same cabin . It being necessary for me to observe strict economy , I took my passage in the steerage . ’

149292	149298	149300	149300	Martin	221	‘ You will allow me , ’
149307	149369	149405	149406	Mr Norris	397	‘ to take my leave . I feel that I am the cause of at least as much embarrassment here , as I have brought upon myself . But I am bound , before I go , to exonerate this gentleman , who , in introducing me to such society , was quite ignorant of my unworthiness , I assure you . ’
149398	149403	149405	149406	Mr Norris	397	‘ Come , come , ’
149425	149470	149644	149644	he	221	‘ the young man has this night beheld a refinement of social manner , and an easy magnificence of social decoration , to which he is a stranger in his own country . Let us hope it may awake a moral sense within him . ’
149647	149657	149666	149666	Martin	221	‘ I hope you exonerate me in another sense ? ’
149658	149664	149644	149644	he	221	‘ How do you mean ? ’
149668	149692	149699	149699	Martin	221	‘ I hope you acquit me of intending or foreseeing the termination of our visit . But I scarcely need ask you that . ’
149693	149697	149699	149699	Martin	221	‘ Scarcely indeed , ’
149701	149728	149644	149644	he	221	‘ I am the more beholden to you for your kindness , when I find what kind of stuff the good citizens here are made of . ’
149729	149733	149644	149644	he	221	‘ I reckon , ’
149738	149768	149780	149780	Martin	221	‘ that they are made of pretty much the same stuff as other folks , if they would but own it , and not set up on false pretences . ’
149769	149778	149789	149790	his friend	9006	‘ In good faith , that ’s true , ’
149782	149787	149789	149790	his friend	9006	‘ I dare say , ’
149792	149820	149644	149644	he	221	‘ you might have such a scene as that in an English comedy , and not detect any gross improbability or anomaly in the matter of it ? ’
149821	149826	149840	149841	his companion	8974	‘ Yes , indeed ! ’
149827	149838	149840	149841	his companion	8974	‘ Doubtless it is more ridiculous here than anywhere else , ’
149843	149898	149911	149911	Martin	221	‘ but our professions are to blame for that . So far as I myself am concerned , I may add that I was perfectly aware from the first that you came over in the steerage , for I had seen the list of passengers , and knew it did not comprise your name . ’
149899	149909	149911	149911	Martin	221	‘ I feel more obliged to you than before , ’
149913	149924	149935	149935	Martin	221	‘ Norris is a very good fellow in his way , ’
149929	149933	149935	149935	Martin	221	‘ Is he ? ’
149938	149980	150002	150002	Martin	221	‘ Oh yes ! there are a hundred good points about him . If you or anybody else addressed him as another order of being , and sued to him IN FORMA PAUPERIS , he would be all kindness and consideration . ’
149981	150000	150235	150235	his	3602	‘ I need n’t have travelled three thousand miles from home to find such a character as THAT , ’

150238	150244	150235	150235	his	3602	‘ To lecture , sir . ’
150245	150264	150272	150273	Mrs Brick	387	‘ I beg your pardon . I forgot . You do n’t go to meeting , I think ? ’
150283	150298	150272	150273	Mrs Brick	387	‘ I do!’--as , indeed , she did nearly every night in the week . ‘
150305	150326	150272	150273	Mrs Brick	387	’ asked Mr Bevan , addressing this lady . The lady raised her eyes in a pious manner , and answered ‘
150329	150382	150388	150388	you	9146	’ She had been much comforted by some good , strong , peppery doctrine , which satisfactorily disposed of all her friends and acquaintances , and quite settled their business . Her bonnet , too , had far outshone every bonnet in the congregation ; so she was tranquil on all accounts . ‘
150394	150406	150410	150411	the Soul	3677	’ said Martin ’s friend , turning again to Mrs Brick . ‘
150416	150417	150410	150411	the Soul	3677	’ ‘

150455	150461	150452	150453	my dear	8944	’ observed the third lady . ‘
150464	150469	150392	150392	ma’am	9146	’ said Mrs Brick . ‘
150474	150475	150392	150392	ma’am	9146	’ ‘
150480	150485	150498	150498	You	9146	’ cried the lady . ‘

150510	150514	150516	150516	you	9146	’ said Bevan . ‘
150523	150527	150516	150516	you	9146	’ answered Martin . ‘
150549	150661	150516	150516	you	9146	’ Martin stopped here , for he saw that the ladies regarded him with no very great favour , though what he had done to deserve the disdainful expression which appeared in their faces he was at a loss to divine . But on their going upstairs to their bedrooms -- which they very soon did -- Mr Bevan informed him that domestic drudgery was far beneath the exalted range of these Philosophers , and that the chances were a hundred to one that not one of the three could perform the easiest woman ’s work for herself , or make the simplest article of dress for any of her children . ‘
150685	150689	150747	150747	you	0	’ he said , ‘

150825	150834	151145	151145	Mark	222	’ said Martin , pursuing the old adage . ‘
150852	151144	151145	151145	Mark	222	’ They shook hands heartily and separated . As soon as Martin was left alone , the excitement of novelty and change which had sustained him through all the fatigues of the day , departed ; and he felt so thoroughly dejected and worn out , that he even lacked the energy to crawl upstairs to bed . In twelve or fifteen hours , how great a change had fallen on his hopes and sanguine plans ! New and strange as he was to the ground on which he stood , and to the air he breathed , he could not -- recalling all that he had crowded into that one day -- but entertain a strong misgiving that his enterprise was doomed . Rash and ill - considered as it had often looked on shipboard , but had never seemed on shore , it wore a dismal aspect , now , that frightened him . Whatever thoughts he called up to his aid , they came upon him in depressing and discouraging shapes , and gave him no relief . Even the diamonds on his finger sparkled with the brightness of tears , and had no ray of hope in all their brilliant lustre . He continued to sit in gloomy rumination by the stove , unmindful of the boarders who dropped in one by one from their stores and counting - houses , or the neighbouring bar - rooms , and , after taking long pulls from a great white waterjug upon the sideboard , and lingering with a kind of hideous fascination near the brass spittoons , lounged heavily to bed ; until at length Mark Tapley came and shook him by the arm , supposing him asleep . ‘
151147	151153	151145	151145	Mark	222	’ he cried , starting . ‘
151159	151174	151230	151230	I	0	’ said that cheerful follower , snuffing with his fingers the candle he bore . ‘

151273	151309	151324	151324	sir	864	‘ But , Lord , I have reason to be ! I ought to have been born here ; that ’s my opinion . Take care how you go’--for they were now ascending the stairs . ‘

151532	151546	151548	151548	Mark	222	‘ I suppose they polish themselves with a dry cloth in this country , ’
151550	151559	151548	151548	Mark	222	‘ They ’ve certainly got a touch of the ‘
151564	151565	151568	151568	you	309	’ ‘
151577	151587	151597	151597	Mark	222	’ said Martin , dropping into one of the chairs ‘
151599	151600	151601	151601	You	864	’ ‘
151613	151618	151695	151695	you	309	’ returned Mr Tapley ; ‘
151636	151692	151695	151695	you	309	’ With which he produced a very large tumbler , piled up to the brim with little blocks of clear transparent ice , through which one or two thin slices of lemon , and a golden liquid of delicious appearance , appealed from the still depths below , to the loving eye of the spectator . ‘
151699	151789	151695	151695	you	309	’ said Martin . But Mr Tapley made no answer ; merely plunging a reed into the mixture -- which caused a pleasant commotion among the pieces of ice -- and signifying by an expressive gesture that it was to be pumped up through that agency by the enraptured drinker . Martin took the glass with an astonished look ; applied his lips to the reed ; and cast up his eyes once in ecstasy . He paused no more until the goblet was drained to the last drop . ‘
151794	151807	151836	151838	the nearest man	3708	’ said Mark , taking it from him with a triumphant face ; ‘
151846	151847	151836	151838	the nearest man	3708	’ ‘
151855	151859	151882	151883	Sherry cobbler	408	’ repeated Martin . ‘
151866	151876	151930	151930	he	864	’ said Mark , tenderly patting the empty glass , ‘
151900	151921	151949	151949	Martin	221	’re equal to having your boots took off , and are , in every particular worth mentioning , another man . ’
151935	151947	151949	151949	Martin	221	‘ Mind ! I am not going to relapse , Mark , ’
151951	151974	151982	151984	the imperturbable Tapley	309	‘ but , good Heaven , if we should be left in some wild part of this country without goods or money ! ’
151975	151980	151982	151984	the imperturbable Tapley	309	‘ Well , sir ! ’
151986	152019	152031	152031	Martin	221	‘ from what we ’ve seen already , I do n’t know whether , under those circumstances , we should n’t do better in the wild parts than in the tame ones . ’
152020	152029	152031	152031	Martin	221	‘ Oh , Tom Pinch , Tom Pinch ! ’
152038	152068	152078	152078	Mark	222	‘ what would I give to be again beside you , and able to hear your voice , though it were even in the old bedroom at Pecksniff ’s ! ’
152069	152076	152078	152078	Mark	222	‘ Oh , Dragon , Dragon ! ’
152082	152188	152197	152197	Martin	221	‘ if there warn’t any water between you and me , and nothing faint - hearted - like in going back , I do n’t know that I might n’t say the same . But here am I , Dragon , in New York , America ; and there are you in Wiltshire , Europe ; and there ’s a fortune to make , Dragon , and a beautiful young lady to make it for ; and whenever you go to see the Monument , Dragon , you must n’t give in on the doorsteps , or you ’ll never get up to the top ! ’
152189	152195	152197	152197	Martin	221	‘ Wisely said , Mark , ’
152199	152205	152232	152232	Mark	222	‘ We must look forward . ’
152206	152230	152252	152252	em	3713	‘ In all the story - books as ever I read , sir , the people as looked backward was turned into stones , ’
152234	152251	152255	152255	I	0	‘ and my opinion always was , that they brought it on themselves , and it served ‘
152267	152268	152269	152269	They	3715	’ ‘
152277	152288	152290	152290	I	0	’ said Martin , as he lay down in bed . ‘
152295	152312	152290	152290	I	0	’ whispered Mark Tapley , when he was out of hearing and in his own room ; ‘
152323	152345	152346	152348	a United Statesman	3718	’re well out of this , when there ’ll be a little more credit in keeping up one ’s jollity , I ’m
152350	152626	152346	152348	a United Statesman	3718	’ Leaving them to blend and mingle in their sleep the shadows of objects afar off , as they take fantastic shapes upon the wall in the dim light of thought without control , be it the part of this slight chronicle -- a dream within a dream -- as rapidly to change the scene , and cross the ocean to the English shore . CHAPTER EIGHTEEN DOES BUSINESS WITH THE HOUSE OF ANTHONY CHUZZLEWIT AND SON , FROM WHICH ONE OF THE PARTNERS RETIRES UNEXPECTEDLY Change begets change . Nothing propagates so fast . If a man habituated to a narrow circle of cares and pleasures , out of which he seldom travels , step beyond it , though for never so brief a space , his departure from the monotonous scene on which he has been an actor of importance , would seem to be the signal for instant confusion . As if , in the gap he had left , the wedge of change were driven to the head , rending what was a solid mass to fragments , things cemented and held together by the usages of years , burst asunder in as many weeks . The mine which Time has slowly dug beneath familiar objects is sprung in an instant ; and what was rock before , becomes but sand and dust . Most men , at one time or other , have proved this in some degree . The extent to which the natural laws of change asserted their supremacy in that limited sphere of action which Martin had deserted , shall be faithfully set down in these pages . ‘
152634	152645	152661	152661	You	3719	’ whimpered old Anthony , drawing near the evening fire , ‘
152659	152660	152661	152661	You	3719	’ ‘
152677	152691	152704	152706	A good lad	3720	’ observed the amiable Jonas , raising his eyes from yesterday ’s newspaper , ‘
152702	152703	152728	152730	A prudent lad	3721	’ ‘
152708	152727	152749	152749	I	0	’ cried the father , breathing on his cold hands , and feebly chafing them against each other . ‘
152747	152748	152763	152763	I	0	’ ‘
152770	152781	152763	152763	I	0	’ said his son , as he resumed the paper . ‘
152784	152790	152763	152763	I	0	’ chuckled the old man . ‘
152799	152800	152763	152763	I	0	’ ‘
152806	152824	152826	152826	you	3719	’ cried Mr Jonas , stopping his honoured parent ’s hand in the use of the poker . ‘
152844	152845	152853	152853	Jonas	219	’ ‘
152855	152861	152853	152853	Jonas	219	’ said the old man . ‘
152867	152872	152887	152887	You	3719	’ bawled his heir . ‘
152885	152886	152887	152887	You	3719	’ ‘
152899	152921	152969	152969	you	3719	’ said Jonas in a voice too low for him to hear , and looking at him with an angry frown . ‘
152974	153040	153113	153115	The old man	991	’ After this dutiful address he took his tea - cup in his hand -- for that meal was in progress , and the father and son and Chuffey were partakers of it . Then , looking steadfastly at his father , and stopping now and then to carry a spoonful of tea to his lips , he proceeded in the same tone , thus : ‘
153046	153112	153129	153129	his	219	’re a nice old man to be talking of want at this time of day . Beginning to talk of want , are you ? Well , I declare ! There is n’t time ? No , I should hope not . But you ’d live to be a couple of hundred if you could ; and after all be discontented . I know you ! ’
153154	153157	153129	153129	his	219	‘ If you ’re
153167	153178	153358	153358	He	10525	’ he grumbled , but in the same subdued key , ‘
153270	153357	153452	153452	Chuffey	354	’ Possibly this general phrase supplied the place of grave , or tomb , or sepulchre , or cemetery , or mausoleum , or other such word which the filial tenderness of Mr Jonas made him delicate of pronouncing . He pursued the theme no further ; for Chuffey , somehow discovering , from his old corner by the fireside , that Anthony was in the attitude of a listener , and that Jonas appeared to be speaking , suddenly cried out , like one inspired : ‘
153373	153447	153472	153472	Chuffey	354	’ Old Chuffey little suspected what depth of application these words had , or that , in the bitter satire which they bore , they might have sunk into the old man ’s very soul , could he have known what words here hanging on his own son ’s lips , or what was passing in his thoughts . But the voice diverted the current of Anthony ’s reflections , and roused him . ‘
153474	153487	153488	153489	Precious old	3733	’ said the old man , with a strange look of discomposure . ‘
153491	153494	153508	153509	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ assented Jonas ‘
153501	153505	153516	153516	sir	864	’ said Chuffey . ‘
153518	153519	153522	153522	He	219	’ ‘
153531	153538	153560	153560	He	219	’ cried Jonas , quite disgusted . ‘
153558	153559	153568	153568	Anthony	409	’ ‘
153563	153566	153568	153568	Anthony	409	’re wrong ! ’
153574	153579	153568	153568	Anthony	409	‘ Tut , tut ! ’
153585	153593	153596	153596	I	0	‘ I know better . I say HE ’S
153599	153632	153596	153596	I	0	’S wrong . He ’s a boy . That ’s what he is . So are you , Mr Chuzzlewit -- a kind of boy . Ha ! ha ! ha ! You ’re
153643	153650	153661	153661	him	219	’re a boy to me ; you ’re
153663	153718	153725	153725	Chuff	411	’ With which extraordinary speech -- for in the case of Chuffey this was a burst of eloquence without a parallel -- the poor old shadow drew through his palsied arm his master ’s hand , and held it there , with his own folded upon it , as if he would defend him . ‘
153727	153757	153725	153725	Chuff	411	’ said Anthony , with as much softness of manner , or , to describe it more correctly , with as little hardness as he was capable of expressing . ‘
153762	153766	153778	153778	I	0	’ cried Chuffey . ‘
153786	153787	153788	153788	I	0	’ ‘
153794	153804	153788	153788	I	0	’ said the old man , shaking his head . ‘
153811	153815	153827	153827	You	0	’ cried Chuffey . ‘
153833	154004	153827	153827	You	0	’ He patted Anthony upon the hand as one might comfort a child , and drawing the old man ’s arm still further through his own , shook his trembling fingers towards the spot where Jonas sat , as though he would wave him off . But , Anthony remaining quite still and silent , he relaxed his hold by slow degrees and lapsed into his usual niche in the corner ; merely putting forth his hand at intervals and touching his old employer gently on the coat , as with the design of assuring himself that he was yet beside him . Mr Jonas was so very much amazed by these proceedings that he could do nothing but stare at the two old men , until Chuffey had fallen into his usual state , and Anthony had sunk into a doze ; when he gave some vent to his emotions by going close up to the former personage , and making as though he would , in vulgar parlance , ‘
154009	154010	154011	154011	They	3742	’ ‘
154019	154027	154056	154056	You	0	’ thought Jonas in a brown study , ‘
154057	154069	154179	154179	Jonas	219	’re legacy hunting , are you , Mister Chuff ? Eh ? ’
154170	154177	154179	154179	Jonas	219	‘ All as right as ever , ’
154197	154250	154370	154370	Jonas	219	‘ Here ’s the will , Mister Chuff . Thirty pound a year for your maintenance , old boy , and all the rest to his only son , Jonas . You need n’t trouble yourself to be too affectionate . You wo n’t get anything by it . What ’s that ? ’
154362	154368	154370	154370	Jonas	219	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’
154375	154391	154400	154401	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Who is it ? Where do you come from ? What do you want ? ’
154392	154395	154404	154404	Pecksniff	218	‘ Matter ! ’
154413	154420	154434	154434	Jonas	219	‘ The matter , Mr Jonas ! ’
154421	154432	154434	154434	Jonas	219	‘ What are you prying and peering about here for ? ’
154438	154498	154509	154509	Pecksniff	218	‘ What do you mean by coming up to town in this way , and taking one unawares ? It ’s precious odd a man ca n’t read the -- the newspaper -- in his own office without being startled out of his wits by people coming in without notice . Why did n’t you knock at the door ? ’
154499	154507	154523	154523	he	218	‘ So I did , Mr Jonas , ’
154511	154522	154530	154530	he	218	‘ but no one heard me . I was curious , ’
154541	154564	154596	154597	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ to find out what part of the newspaper interested you so much ; but the glass was too dim and dirty . ’
154588	154594	154596	154597	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Was it poetry now ? ’
154613	154641	154653	154653	Jonas	219	‘ Or was it politics ? Or was it the price of stock ? The main chance , Mr Jonas , the main chance , I suspect . ’
154642	154651	154653	154653	Jonas	219	‘ You ai n’t far from the truth , ’
154662	154709	154717	154718	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ but how the deuce do you come to be in London again ? Ecod ! it ’s enough to make a man stare , to see a fellow looking at him all of a sudden , who he thought was sixty or seventy mile away . ’
154710	154715	154717	154718	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ So it is , ’
154720	154741	154752	154752	Jonas	219	‘ No doubt of it , my dear Mr Jonas . For while the human mind is constituted as it is-- ’
154742	154750	154717	154718	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Oh , bother the human mind , ’
154755	154763	154773	154774	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ what have you come up for ? ’
154764	154771	154773	154774	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ A little matter of business , ’
154776	154783	154789	154789	Jonas	219	‘ which has arisen quite unexpectedly . ’
154784	154787	154830	154830	Jonas	219	‘ Oh ! ’
154791	154828	154830	154830	Jonas	219	‘ is that all ? Well . Here ’s father in the next room . Hallo father , here ’s Pecksniff ! He gets more addle - pated every day he lives , I do believe , ’
154838	154852	154990	154991	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Do n’t I tell you Pecksniff ’s here , stupid - head ? ’
154980	154988	155040	155041	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ And now , my good sir , ’
154995	155038	155064	155064	Anthony	409	‘ now that we are alone , pray tell me what I can do for you . I say alone , because I believe that our dear friend Mr Chuffey is , metaphysically speaking , a -- shall I say a dummy ? ’
155056	155062	155064	155064	Anthony	409	‘ He neither hears us , ’
155066	155071	155079	155080	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ nor sees us . ’
155072	155077	155079	155080	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Why , then , ’
155082	155138	155155	155157	the old man	991	‘ I will be bold to say , with the utmost sympathy for his afflictions , and the greatest admiration of those excellent qualities which do equal honour to his head and to his heart , that he is what is playfully termed a dummy . You were going to observe , my dear sir-- ? ’
155139	155153	155165	155166	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I was not going to make any observation that I know of , ’
155159	155163	155165	155166	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I was , ’
155170	155180	155188	155189	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Oh ! YOU were ? What was it ? ’
155181	155186	155324	155324	He	218	‘ That I never , ’
155229	155323	155490	155490	he	218	‘ that I never in my life was so astonished as by the receipt of your letter yesterday . That you should do me the honour to wish to take counsel with me on any matter , amazed me ; but that you should desire to do so , to the exclusion even of Mr Jonas , showed an amount of confidence in one to whom you had done a verbal injury -- merely a verbal injury , you were anxious to repair -- which gratified , which moved , which overcame me . ’
155510	155524	155538	155538	himself	218	‘ Will you hold your tongue , sir , and let me speak ? ’
155540	155564	155577	155579	the old man	991	‘ I knew his hand was changed , and that his writing staggered . I said so yesterday . Ahem ! Dear me ! ’
155565	155575	155605	155607	the courteous architect	3762	‘ Jonas is sweet upon your daughter , Pecksniff , ’
155586	155603	155619	155619	Anthony	409	‘ We spoke of that , if you remember , sir , at Mrs Todgers ’s , ’
155609	155617	155619	155619	Anthony	409	‘ You need n’t speak so loud , ’
155621	155623	155704	155704	I	0	‘ I ’m
155630	155703	155704	155704	I	0	’ Mr Pecksniff had certainly raised his voice pretty high ; not so much because he thought Anthony was deaf , as because he felt convinced that his perceptive faculties were waxing dim ; but this quick resentment of his considerate behaviour greatly disconcerted him , and , not knowing what tack to shape his course upon , he made another inclination of the head , yet more submissive that the last . ‘
155708	155714	155716	155716	Jonas	219	’ repeated the old man , ‘
155723	155724	155725	155727	A charming girl	3764	’ ‘
155731	155744	155753	155753	I	0	’ murmured Mr Pecksniff , seeing that he waited for an answer . ‘

155767	155792	155805	155805	you	0	’ cried the old man , advancing his weazen face at least a yard , and starting forward in his chair to do it . ‘
155807	155808	155805	155805	you	0	’ ‘
155813	155818	155823	155825	a good sir	3769	’ Mr Pecksniff began . ‘
155827	155831	155866	155866	she	11810	’ retorted Anthony , ‘
155895	155918	156010	156011	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ His face altered so horribly as he said the word , that Mr Pecksniff really was fain to look another way . ‘
155972	155980	156008	156008	My	0	’ said the old man , hoarsely , ‘
156006	156007	156008	156008	My	0	’ ‘
156013	156017	156010	156011	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ said Pecksniff , ‘

156056	156070	156086	156086	him	219	’ cried Anthony , with something like the snarl of a wild animal . ‘
156088	156095	156096	156096	Death	413	’ pointing to his feeble clerk . ‘
156111	156232	156096	156096	Death	413	’ Mr Pecksniff was so much afraid of the old man , and so completely taken aback by the state in which he found him , that he had not even presence of mind enough to call up a scrap of morality from the great storehouse within his own breast . Therefore he stammered out that no doubt it was , in fairness and decency , Mr Chuffey ’s turn to expire ; and that from all he had heard of Mr Chuffey , and the little he had the pleasure of knowing of that gentleman , personally , he felt convinced in his own mind that he would see the propriety of expiring with as little delay as possible . ‘
156236	156248	156271	156271	Jonas	219	’ said the old man , beckoning him to draw nearer . ‘
156278	156279	156280	156280	I	0	’ ‘
156285	156290	156292	156292	you	0	’ thought Mr Pecksniff , ‘

156310	156316	156396	156396	You	3777	’ said the old man , ‘
156397	156439	156447	156448	Mr Pecksniff	218	’re too deep . In your way of leading him on , you ’ll leave him miles behind . Bah , you man of oil , have I no eyes to see how you have angled with him from the first ? ’
156440	156445	156447	156448	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Now I wonder , ’
156458	156468	156730	156730	he	318	‘ whether this is all he has to say ? ’
156721	156729	156734	156734	he	318	‘ What ! My father asleep again ? ’
156747	156756	156765	156766	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Ah ! and snoring . Only hear ! ’

156776	156795	156806	156806	Pecksniff	218	‘ Yes ; let him alone for that . He ’ll snore for six , at any time . ’
156796	156804	156806	156806	Pecksniff	218	‘ Do you know , Mr Jonas , ’
156808	156824	156834	156834	Jonas	219	‘ that I think your father is -- don’t let me alarm you -- breaking ? ’
156825	156832	156734	156734	he	318	‘ Oh , is he though ? ’
156851	156871	156890	156891	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Ecod , you do n’t know how tough he is . He ai n’t upon the move yet . ’
156872	156888	156904	156904	Jonas	219	‘ It struck me that he was changed , both in his appearance and manner , ’

156913	156934	156734	156734	he	318	‘ He never was better than he is now . How are they all at home ? How ’s Charity ? ’
156935	156943	156734	156734	he	318	‘ Blooming , Mr Jonas , blooming . ’
156944	156954	156961	156962	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ And the other one ; how ’s she ? ’
156955	156959	156961	156962	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Volatile trifler ! ’
156967	157040	157052	157052	Jonas	219	‘ She is well , she is well . Roving from parlour to bedroom , Mr Jonas , like a bee , skimming from post to pillar , like the butterfly ; dipping her young beak into our currant wine , like the humming - bird ! Ah ! were she a little less giddy than she is ; and had she but the sterling qualities of Cherry , my young friend ! ’
157041	157050	157061	157062	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Is she so very giddy , then ? ’
157054	157059	157061	157062	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Well , well ! ’
157068	157094	157107	157107	Jonas	219	‘ let me not be hard upon my child . Beside her sister Cherry she appears so . A strange noise that , Mr Jonas ! ’
157095	157105	157107	157107	Jonas	219	‘ Something wrong in the clock , I suppose , ’
157113	157127	157177	157177	Pecksniff	241	‘ So the other one ai n’t your favourite , ai n’t she ? ’
157160	157175	157475	157475	Jonas	219	‘ Upon my word , Mr Jonas , that is a very extraordinary clock , ’

157492	157516	157523	157524	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ It was a mercy you were present when he was taken ill . Some one might have said it was my doing . ’

157526	157535	157536	157536	he	218	‘ I do n’t know but they might , ’

157580	157598	157611	157612	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ but I -- I never wished him dead . Do you think he ’s very bad ? ’

157616	157635	157637	157637	Jonas	219	‘ Ah ! but he might say that to charge us more , in case of his getting well ’
157639	157667	157963	157963	Jonas	219	‘ You must n’t go away , Pecksniff . Now it ’s come to this , I would n’t be without a witness for a thousand pound . ’

CHAPTER NINETEEN THE READER IS BROUGHT INTO COMMUNICATION WITH SOME PROFESSIONAL PERSONS , AND SHEDS A TEAR OVER THE FILIAL PIETY OF GOOD MR JONAS Mr Pecksniff was in a hackney cabriolet , for Jonas Chuzzlewit had said ‘
158430	158498	158692	158692	Midwife	3821	’ Mankind is evil in its thoughts and in its base constructions , and Jonas was resolved it should not have an inch to stretch into an ell against him . It never should be charged upon his father ’s son that he had grudged the money for his father ’s funeral . Hence , until the obsequies should be concluded , Jonas had taken for his motto ‘
158505	158691	158692	158692	Midwife	3821	’ Mr Pecksniff had been to the undertaker , and was now upon his way to another officer in the train of mourning -- a female functionary , a nurse , and watcher , and performer of nameless offices about the persons of the dead -- whom he had recommended . Her name , as Mr Pecksniff gathered from a scrap of writing in his hand , was Gamp ; her residence in Kingsgate Street , High Holborn . So Mr Pecksniff , in a hackney cab , was rattling over Holborn stones , in quest of Mrs Gamp . This lady lodged at a bird - fancier ’s , next door but one to the celebrated mutton - pie shop , and directly opposite to the original cat’s - meat warehouse ; the renown of which establishments was duly heralded on their respective fronts . It was a little house , and this was the more convenient ; for Mrs Gamp being , in her highest walk of art , a monthly nurse , or , as her sign - board boldly had it , ‘
158694	159270	159355	159355	I	0	’ and lodging in the first - floor front , was easily assailable at night by pebbles , walking - sticks , and fragments of tobacco - pipe ; all much more efficacious than the street - door knocker , which was so constructed as to wake the street with ease , and even spread alarms of fire in Holborn , without making the smallest impression on the premises to which it was addressed . It chanced on this particular occasion , that Mrs Gamp had been up all the previous night , in attendance upon a ceremony to which the usage of gossips has given that name which expresses , in two syllables , the curse pronounced on Adam . It chanced that Mrs Gamp had not been regularly engaged , but had been called in at a crisis , in consequence of her great repute , to assist another professional lady with her advice ; and thus it happened that , all points of interest in the case being over , Mrs Gamp had come home again to the bird - fancier ’s and gone to bed . So when Mr Pecksniff drove up in the hackney cab , Mrs Gamp ’s curtains were drawn close , and Mrs Gamp was fast asleep behind them . If the bird - fancier had been at home , as he ought to have been , there would have been no great harm in this ; but he was out , and his shop was closed . The shutters were down certainly ; and in every pane of glass there was at least one tiny bird in a tiny bird - cage , twittering and hopping his little ballet of despair , and knocking his head against the roof ; while one unhappy goldfinch who lived outside a red villa with his name on the door , drew the water for his own drinking , and mutely appealed to some good man to drop a farthing’s - worth of poison in it . Still , the door was shut . Mr Pecksniff tried the latch , and shook it , causing a cracked bell inside to ring most mournfully ; but no one came . The bird - fancier was an easy shaver also , and a fashionable hair - dresser also , and perhaps he had been sent for , express , from the court end of the town , to trim a lord , or cut and curl a lady ; but however that might be , there , upon his own ground , he was not ; nor was there any more distinct trace of him to assist the imagination of an inquirer , than a professional print or emblem of his calling ( much favoured in the trade ) , representing a hair - dresser of easy manners curling a lady of distinguished fashion , in the presence of a patent upright grand pianoforte . Noting these circumstances , Mr Pecksniff , in the innocence of his heart , applied himself to the knocker ; but at the first double knock every window in the street became alive with female heads ; and before he could repeat the performance whole troops of married ladies ( some about to trouble Mrs Gamp themselves very shortly ) came flocking round the steps , all crying out with one accord , and with uncommon interest , ‘
159303	159354	159371	159372	one lady	3824	’ Acting upon this suggestion , and borrowing the driver ’s whip for the purpose , Mr Pecksniff soon made a commotion among the first floor flower - pots , and roused Mrs Gamp , whose voice -- to the great satisfaction of the matrons -- was heard to say , ‘
159356	159359	159371	159372	one lady	3824	’m coming . ’
159360	159369	159398	159398	another	1114	‘ He ’s as pale as a muffin , ’
159380	159396	159486	159486	she	223	‘ So he ought to be , if he ’s the feelings of a man , ’
159497	159503	159509	159510	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Is it Mrs Perkins ? ’
159504	159507	159509	159510	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ No ! ’
159514	159520	159529	159530	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Nothing of the sort . ’
159521	159527	159529	159530	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ What , Mr Whilks ! ’
159532	159566	159576	159576	Pecksniff	415	‘ Do n’t say it ’s you , Mr Whilks , and that poor creetur Mrs Whilks with not even a pincushion ready . Do n’t say it ’s you , Mr Whilks ! ’
159567	159574	159576	159576	Pecksniff	415	‘ It is n’t Mr Whilks , ’
159578	159615	159692	159692	she	223	‘ I do n’t know the man . Nothing of the kind . A gentleman is dead ; and some person being wanted in the house , you have been recommended by Mr Mould the undertaker . ’
159705	159710	159879	159879	she	223	‘ with his corpses ; ’
159904	159911	159985	159985	She	223	‘ put it in the boot . ’
159966	159984	159985	159985	She	223	‘ And so the gentleman ’s dead , sir ! Ah ! The more ’s the pity . ’
159993	160028	160310	160311	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ But it ’s what we must all come to . It ’s as certain as being born , except that we ca n’t make our calculations as exact . Ah ! Poor dear ! ’
160305	160308	160310	160311	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Ah ! ’
160325	160380	160474	160475	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Ah dear ! When Gamp was summoned to his long home , and I see him a - lying in Guy ’s Hospital with a penny - piece on each eye , and his wooden leg under his left arm , I thought I should have fainted away . But I bore up . ’
160461	160472	160474	160475	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ You have become indifferent since then , I suppose ? ’
160477	160486	160499	160500	that lady	9988	‘ Use is second nature , Mrs Gamp . ’
160487	160497	160474	160475	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ You may well say second nater , sir , ’
160502	160641	160660	160660	she	9988	‘ One ’s first ways is to find sich things a trial to the feelings , and so is one ’s lasting custom . If it was n’t for the nerve a little sip of liquor gives me ( I never was able to do more than taste it ) , I never could go through with what I sometimes has to do . “ Mrs Harris , ” I says , at the very last case as ever I acted in , which it was but a young person , “ Mrs Harris , ” I says , “ leave the bottle on the chimley - piece , and do n’t ask me to take none , but let me put my lips to it when I am so dispoged , and then I will do what I ’m
160697	160704	160856	160857	Mr Mould	420	’ said Mrs Gamp with emphasis , ‘
160762	160838	160960	160961	this gentleman	819	‘ em . But what I always says to them as has the management of matters , Mrs Harris”’--here she kept her eye on Mr Pecksniff--‘“be they gents or be they ladies , is , do n’t ask me whether I wo n’t take none , or whether I will , but leave the bottle on the chimley - piece , and let me put my lips to it when I am so dispoged . ” ’
160944	160958	160960	160961	this gentleman	819	‘ Well , Mrs Gamp , and how are YOU , Mrs Gamp ? ’
160972	160982	161025	161026	the undertaker	11846	‘ Pretty well , I thank you , sir , ’
160987	161023	161044	161044	she	3860	‘ You ’ll be very particular here , Mrs Gamp . This is not a common case , Mrs Gamp . Let everything be very nice and comfortable , Mrs Gamp , if you please , ’
161036	161043	161044	161044	she	3860	‘ It shall be , sir , ’
161050	161062	161075	161076	the undertaker	11846	‘ You knows me of old , sir , I hope . ’
161063	161073	161075	161076	the undertaker	11846	‘ I hope so , too , Mrs Gamp , ’
161078	161085	161104	161104	he	11846	‘ and I think so also . ’
161091	161103	161104	161104	he	11846	‘ This is one of the most impressive cases , sir , ’
161111	161125	161134	161135	that gentleman	921	‘ that I have seen in the whole course of my professional experience . ’
161126	161132	161134	161135	that gentleman	921	‘ Indeed , Mr Mould ! ’
161137	161215	161233	161233	sir	864	‘ Such affectionate regret , sir , I never saw . There is no limitation , there is positively NO limitation’--opening his eyes wide , and standing on tiptoe--‘in point of expense ! I have orders , sir , to put on my whole establishment of mutes ; and mutes come very dear , Mr Pecksniff ; not to mention their drink . To provide silver - plated handles of the very best description , ornamented with angels ’
161242	161243	161249	161251	an excellent man	9014	’ ‘
161253	161258	161249	161251	an excellent man	9014	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘
161275	161279	161371	161371	you	0	’ retorted Mould , ‘
161363	161364	161375	161376	Mr Mould	420	’ ‘
161378	161382	161430	161430	your	0	’ observed Pecksniff . ‘
161416	161429	161459	161460	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ said Mould , waving his hand at the public in general , ‘
161466	161474	161459	161460	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ cried Mould , with bitter sarcasm . ‘
161476	161481	161459	161460	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	‘ em up , hang ‘
161486	161490	161459	161460	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	‘ em and heel ‘
161495	161508	161533	161533	Mould	420	‘ em ready for his son against he ’s old enough to wear ‘
161515	161531	161533	161533	Mould	420	‘ em on yourselves , for they wo n’t fit you . We knew him , ’
161549	161571	161819	161819	he	415	‘ we knew him , and are not to be caught with chaff . Mr Pecksniff , sir , good morning . ’
161815	161818	161819	161819	he	415	‘ Pecksniff , ’
161826	161874	161819	161819	he	415	‘ you shall have the regulation of it all , mind ! You shall be able to tell anybody who talks about it that everything was correctly and nicely done . There is n’t any one you ’d like to ask to the funeral , is there ? ’
161875	161885	161897	161897	Jonas	415	‘ No , Mr Jonas , I think not . ’
161886	161895	161897	161897	Jonas	415	‘ Because if there is , you know , ’
161899	161914	161920	161921	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ ask him . We do n’t want to make a secret of it . ’
161915	161918	161819	161819	he	415	‘ No , ’
161928	161956	161963	161963	Jonas	415	‘ I am not the less obliged to you on that account , Mr Jonas , for your liberal hospitality ; but there really is no one . ’
161957	161961	161963	161963	Jonas	415	‘ Very well , ’
161965	162011	162024	162024	Pecksniff	415	‘ then you , and I , and Chuffey , and the doctor , will be just a coachful . We ’ll have the doctor , Pecksniff , because he knows what was the matter with him , and that it could n’t be helped . ’
162012	162022	162103	162104	that gentleman	921	‘ Where is our dear friend , Mr Chuffey ? ’
162087	162101	162138	162139	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ You may say whatever you wish to say here , Mrs Gamp , ’
162114	162136	162257	162258	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ It is not much as I have to say when people is a - mourning for the dead and gone , ’
162141	162255	162257	162258	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ but what I have to say is TO the pint and purpose , and no offence intended , must be so considered . I have been at a many places in my time , gentlemen , and I hope I knows what my duties is , and how the same should be performed ; in course , if I did not , it would be very strange , and very wrong in sich a gentleman as Mr Mould , which has undertook the highest families in this land , and given every satisfaction , so to recommend me as he does . I have seen a deal of trouble my own self , ’
162269	162304	162412	162413	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ and I can feel for them as has their feelings tried , but I am not a Rooshan or a Prooshan , and consequently can not suffer Spies to be set over me . ’
162330	162410	162412	162413	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ It is not a easy matter , gentlemen , to live when you are left a widder woman ; particular when your feelings works upon you to that extent that you often find yourself a - going out on terms which is a certain loss , and never can repay . But in whatever way you earns your bread , you may have rules and regulations of your own which can not be broke through . Some people , ’
162433	162463	162474	162475	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ may be Rooshans , and others may be Prooshans ; they are born so , and will please themselves . Them which is of other naturs thinks different . ’
162464	162472	162474	162475	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ If I understand this good lady , ’
162481	162495	162501	162501	Jonas	415	‘ Mr Chuffey is troublesome to her . Shall I fetch him down ? ’
162496	162499	162501	162501	Jonas	415	‘ Do , ’
162503	162544	162586	162586	she	223	‘ I was going to tell you he was up there , when she came in . I ’d go myself and bring him down , only -- only I ’d rather you went , if you do n’t mind . ’
162580	162585	162586	162586	she	223	‘ I am sure , ’
162589	162633	162586	162586	she	223	‘ that if it was n’t for his own happiness , I should no more mind him being there , poor dear , than if he was a fly . But them as is n’t used to these things , thinks so much of ‘
162643	162648	162586	162586	she	223	‘ em not to let ‘
162657	162678	162586	162586	she	223	’ said Mrs Gamp , probably in reference to some flowers of speech she had already strewn on Mr Chuffey , ‘
162683	162693	162586	162586	she	223	‘ em names , it ’s only done to rouse ‘
162696	162773	162586	162586	she	223	’ Whatever epithets she had bestowed on the old clerk , they had not roused HIM . He sat beside the bed , in the chair he had occupied all the previous night , with his hands folded before him , and his head bowed down ; and neither looked up , on their entrance , nor gave any sign of consciousness , until Mr Pecksniff took him by the arm , when he meekly rose . ‘
162779	162783	162851	162854	a wale of grief	3898	’ said Chuffey , ‘
162846	162847	162851	162854	a wale of grief	3898	’ ‘
162856	162869	162875	162879	his poor old crazy servant	3899	’ cried Mrs Gamp , possessing herself of the bottle and glass . ‘
162881	162894	162906	162907	Mr Jonas	415	’ said Chuffey , clasping his hands and looking up in anguish . ‘
162904	162905	162914	162915	Mr Jonas	415	’ ‘
162909	162913	162914	162915	Mr Jonas	415	’ returned Pecksniff , ‘
162921	162922	162923	162923	I	0	’ ‘
162927	162935	162969	162969	I	0	’ cried the old man , weeping . ‘
162977	162978	162981	162982	Mr Chuffey	412	’ ‘
162984	162988	162998	162999	Mr Chuffey	412	’ said Pecksniff . ‘
163001	163002	163005	163005	I	0	’ ‘
163008	163014	163038	163039	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ returned the old clerk . ‘
163047	164023	164040	164041	Mrs Gamp	223	’ He yielded to the hand that guided him , as he lapsed into this familiar expression , and submitted to be led away . Mrs Gamp , with the bottle on one knee , and the glass on the other , sat upon a stool , shaking her head for a long time , until , in a moment of abstraction , she poured out a dram of spirits , and raised it to her lips . It was succeeded by a second , and by a third , and then her eyes -- either in the sadness of her reflections upon life and death , or in her admiration of the liquor -- were so turned up , as to be quite invisible . But she shook her head still . Poor Chuffey was conducted to his accustomed corner , and there he remained , silent and quiet , save at long intervals , when he would rise , and walk about the room , and wring his hands , or raise some strange and sudden cry . For a whole week they all three sat about the hearth and never stirred abroad . Mr Pecksniff would have walked out in the evening time , but Mr Jonas was so averse to his being absent for a minute , that he abandoned the idea , and so , from morning until night , they brooded together in the dark room , without relief or occupation . The weight of that which was stretched out , stiff and stark , in the awful chamber above - stairs , so crushed and bore down Jonas , that he bent beneath the load . During the whole long seven days and nights , he was always oppressed and haunted by a dreadful sense of its presence in the house . Did the door move , he looked towards it with a livid face and starting eye , as if he fully believed that ghostly fingers clutched the handle . Did the fire flicker in a draught of air , he glanced over his shoulder , as almost dreading to behold some shrouded figure fanning and flapping at it with its fearful dress . The lightest noise disturbed him ; and once , in the night , at the sound of a footstep overhead , he cried out that the dead man was walking -- tramp , tramp , tramp -- about his coffin . He lay at night upon a mattress on the floor of the sitting - room ; his own chamber having been assigned to Mrs Gamp ; and Mr Pecksniff was similarly accommodated . The howling of a dog before the house , filled him with a terror he could not disguise . He avoided the reflection in the opposite windows of the light that burned above , as though it had been an angry eye . He often , in every night , rose up from his fitful sleep , and looked and longed for dawn ; all directions and arrangements , even to the ordering of their daily meals , he abandoned to Mr Pecksniff . That excellent gentleman , deeming that the mourner wanted comfort , and that high feeding was likely to do him infinite service , availed himself of these opportunities to such good purpose , that they kept quite a dainty table during this melancholy season ; with sweetbreads , stewed kidneys , oysters , and other such light viands for supper every night ; over which , and sundry jorums of hot punch , Mr Pecksniff delivered such moral reflections and spiritual consolation as might have converted a Heathen -- especially if he had had but an imperfect acquaintance with the English tongue . Nor did Mr Pecksniff alone indulge in the creature comforts during this sad time . Mrs Gamp proved to be very choice in her eating , and repudiated hashed mutton with scorn . In her drinking too , she was very punctual and particular , requiring a pint of mild porter at lunch , a pint at dinner , half - a - pint as a species of stay or holdfast between dinner and tea , and a pint of the celebrated staggering ale , or Real Old Brighton Tipper , at supper ; besides the bottle on the chimney - piece , and such casual invitations to refresh herself with wine as the good breeding of her employers might prompt them to offer . In like manner , Mr Mould ’s men found it necessary to drown their grief , like a young kitten in the morning of its existence , for which reason they generally fuddled themselves before they began to do anything , lest it should make head and get the better of them . In short , the whole of that strange week was a round of dismal joviality and grim enjoyment ; and every one , except poor Chuffey , who came within the shadow of Anthony Chuzzlewit ’s grave , feasted like a Ghoul . At length the day of the funeral , pious and truthful ceremony that it was , arrived . Mr Mould , with a glass of generous port between his eye and the light , leaned against the desk in the little glass office with his gold watch in his unoccupied hand , and conversed with Mrs Gamp ; two mutes were at the house - door , looking as mournful as could be reasonably expected of men with such a thriving job in hand ; the whole of Mr Mould ’s establishment were on duty within the house or without ; feathers waved , horses snorted , silk and velvets fluttered ; in a word , as Mr Mould emphatically said , ‘
164032	164033	164040	164041	Mrs Gamp	223	’ ‘
164043	164057	164040	164041	Mrs Gamp	223	’ exclaimed the undertaker as he emptied his glass and smacked his lips . ‘
164065	164066	164078	164078	You	223	’ ‘
164072	164077	164122	164122	you	223	’ repeated Mr Mould . ‘
164128	164129	164146	164146	sir	864	’ ‘
164148	164166	164146	164146	sir	864	’ said Mrs Gamp , tittering , and smoothing down her new black dress with her hands . ‘
164171	164176	164188	164189	Mrs Gamp	223	’ laughed Mr Mould . ‘
164191	164221	164247	164247	I	0	’ But seeing , by the aid of a little shaving - glass which hung opposite , that he looked merry , he composed his features and became sorrowful . ‘
164258	164268	164280	164280	Providence	338	’ said Mrs Gamp , with an apologetic curtsey . ‘
164273	164278	164362	164362	him	819	’ replied Mr Mould , ‘
164364	164365	164362	164362	him	819	’ ‘
164372	164380	164362	164362	him	819	’ cried Mrs Gamp , with enthusiasm . ‘
164385	164390	164499	164499	drivers	3928	’ said the undertaker ; ‘
164452	164477	164598	164599	Mrs Gamp	223	’ said Mr Mould , waving his watch - chain slowly round and round , so that he described one circle after every item ; ‘
164601	164602	164598	164599	Mrs Gamp	223	’ ‘
164610	164615	164598	164599	Mrs Gamp	223	’ said Mrs Gamp , ‘
164627	164633	164646	164647	the undertaker	11846	‘ em out on hire ! ’
164634	164644	164685	164686	Mr Mould	420	‘ Aye , Mrs Gamp , you are right , ’
164649	164683	164685	164686	Mr Mould	420	‘ We should be an honoured calling . We do good by stealth , and blush to have it mentioned in our little bills . How much consolation may I -- even I , ’
164688	164713	164826	164827	Mr Mould	420	‘ have diffused among my fellow - creatures by means of my four long - tailed prancers , never harnessed under ten pund ten ! ’
164819	164824	164826	164827	Mr Mould	420	‘ Well , Tacker , ’
164829	164835	164845	164845	Tacker	432	‘ is all ready below ? ’
164836	164843	164866	164866	they	3940	‘ A beautiful show , sir , ’
164847	164858	164866	164866	they	3940	‘ The horses are prouder and fresher than ever I see ‘
164887	164903	164905	164905	Tom	249	’ said Mr Tacker , heaping that number of black cloaks upon his left arm . ‘
164914	164919	164905	164905	Tom	249	’ asked Mr Mould . ‘
164932	164936	164905	164905	Tom	249	’ said Tacker . ‘
164939	164974	165003	165003	Tacker	432	’ rejoined Mr Mould , putting up his watch , and glancing at himself in the little shaving - glass , that he might be sure his face had the right expression on it ; ‘
165013	165167	165003	165003	Tacker	432	’ Mr Tacker , who from his great experience in the performance of funerals , would have made an excellent pantomime actor , winked at Mrs Gamp without at all disturbing the gravity of his countenance , and followed his master into the next room . It was a great point with Mr Mould , and a part of his professional tact , not to seem to know the doctor ; though in reality they were near neighbours , and very often , as in the present instance , worked together . So he advanced to fit on his black kid gloves as if he had never seen him in all his life ; while the doctor , on his part , looked as distant and unconscious as if he had heard and read of undertakers , and had passed their shops , but had never before been brought into communication with one . ‘
165172	165177	165178	165179	Mr Pecksniff	415	’ said the doctor . ‘
165183	165184	165185	165185	I	0	’ ‘
165192	165197	165198	165198	You	415	’ returned Mr Pecksniff . ‘
165203	165212	165249	165249	you	864	’ said the doctor , taking a pair . ‘
165251	165258	165270	165270	sir	864	’ Mr Pecksniff took some also . ‘
165272	165277	165362	165363	Mr Pecksniff	415	’ resumed the doctor , ‘
165326	165342	165387	165387	I	0	’ Mr Pecksniff having been likewise inducted into a similar garment , the doctor resumed . ‘
165393	165394	165395	165395	We	3948	’ ‘
165400	165408	165422	165423	Mr Pecksniff	415	’ interrupted Mould in a low voice . ‘
165413	165418	165450	165450	I	0	’ said the doctor . ‘
165453	165454	165458	165458	sir	864	’ ‘
165460	165464	165465	165465	I	0	’ returned Mould . ‘
165475	165480	165598	165598	They	3953	’ said the doctor , ‘
165496	165597	165860	165860	I	0	’ But seeing by this time that Mr Jonas and Chuffey were going out at the door , he put a white pocket - handkerchief to his face as if a violent burst of grief had suddenly come upon him , and walked down side by side with Mr Pecksniff . Mr Mould and his men had not exaggerated the grandeur of the arrangements . They were splendid . The four hearse - horses , especially , reared and pranced , and showed their highest action , as if they knew a man was dead , and triumphed in it . ‘
165630	165859	165860	165860	I	0	’ So through the narrow streets and winding city ways , went Anthony Chuzzlewit ’s funeral ; Mr Jonas glancing stealthily out of the coach - window now and then , to observe its effect upon the crowd ; Mr Mould as he walked along , listening with a sober pride to the exclamations of the bystanders ; the doctor whispering his story to Mr Pecksniff , without appearing to come any nearer the end of it ; and poor old Chuffey sobbing unregarded in a corner . But he had greatly scandalized Mr Mould at an early stage of the ceremony by carrying his handkerchief in his hat in a perfectly informal manner , and wiping his eyes with his knuckles . And as Mr Mould himself had said already , his behaviour was indecent , and quite unworthy of such an occasion ; and he never ought to have been there . There he was , however ; and in the churchyard there he was , also , conducting himself in a no less unbecoming manner , and leaning for support on Tacker , who plainly told him that he was fit for nothing better than a walking funeral . But Chuffey , Heaven help him ! heard no sound but the echoes , lingering in his own heart , of a voice for ever silent . ‘
165864	165880	165895	165895	master	10780	’ cried the old man , sinking down upon the grave when all was done . ‘
165897	165898	165903	165904	Mr Chuffey	412	’ ‘
165906	165911	165926	165926	You	412	’ said the doctor , ‘
165932	165933	165989	165990	Mr Chuffey	412	’ ‘
165954	165972	165986	165987	a man	913	’ said Mould , casting an imploring glance upon them , as he helped to raise him , ‘
165983	165984	165989	165990	Mr Chuffey	412	’ ‘
165992	165996	166001	166002	Mr Chuffey	412	’ said Pecksniff . ‘
166004	166008	166001	166002	Mr Chuffey	412	’ said Mould . ‘
166017	166040	166098	166099	Mr Chuffey	412	’ murmured the doctor , in a tone of stately reproof , as he stepped up to the old man ’s side , ‘
166101	166102	166098	166099	Mr Chuffey	412	’ ‘
166109	166122	166133	166133	He	3965	’ cried the old man , clasping his hands with remarkable passion . ‘
166131	166132	166133	166133	He	3965	’ ‘
166144	166151	166133	166133	He	3965	’ said Jonas , turning pale . ‘
166153	166215	166767	166767	Jonas	415	’re not to mind anything he says . I should n’t wonder if he was to talk some precious nonsense . But do n’t you mind him , any of you . I do n’t . My father left him to my charge ; and whatever he says or does , that ’s enough . I ’ll take care of him . ’
166762	166765	166767	166767	Jonas	415	‘ Pecksniff , ’
166798	166811	166820	166822	the affectionate parent	3996	‘ what do you mean to give your daughters when they marry ? ’
166812	166818	166820	166822	the affectionate parent	3996	‘ My dear Mr Jonas , ’
166829	166836	166857	166857	Jonas	415	‘ what a very singular inquiry ! ’
166837	166855	166857	166857	Jonas	415	‘ Now , do n’t you mind whether it ’s a singular inquiry or a plural one , ’
166867	166882	166895	166896	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ but answer it , or let it alone . One or the other . ’
166883	166893	166895	166896	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Hum ! The question , my dear friend , ’
166908	166923	166895	166896	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ is involved with many considerations . What would I give them ? Eh ? ’
166924	166931	166932	166932	em	3998	‘ Ah ! what would you give ‘
166934	166938	166895	166896	Mr Pecksniff	415	’ repeated Jonas . ‘
166943	166948	166932	166932	em	3998	‘ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
166970	167005	167025	167026	Mr Pecksniff	415	’ Mr Jonas was evidently disconcerted , and at a loss how to proceed . It was a good answer . It seemed a deep one , but such is the wisdom of simplicity ! ’
167006	167023	167048	167048	he	415	‘ My standard for the merits I would require in a son - in - law , ’
167033	167047	167048	167048	he	415	‘ is a high one . Forgive me , my dear Mr Jonas , ’
167054	167090	167101	167101	Jonas	415	‘ if I say that you have spoiled me , and made it a fanciful one ; an imaginative one ; a prismatically tinged one , if I may be permitted to call it so . ’
167091	167099	167119	167120	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ What do you mean by that ? ’
167110	167117	167119	167120	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Indeed , my dear friend , ’
167122	167183	167190	167190	Jonas	415	‘ you may well inquire . The heart is not always a royal mint , with patent machinery to work its metal into current coin . Sometimes it throws it out in strange forms , not easily recognized as coin at all . But it is sterling gold . It has at least that merit . It is sterling gold . ’
167184	167188	167205	167206	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Is it ? ’
167200	167203	167119	167120	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Aye ! ’
167212	167278	167374	167374	He	415	‘ it is . To be plain with you , Mr Jonas , if I could find two such sons - in - law as you will one day make to some deserving man , capable of appreciating a nature such as yours , I would -- forgetful of myself -- bestow upon my daughters portions reaching to the very utmost limit of my means . ’

167397	167408	167412	167414	one such son	4007	’ he said , at last , with captivating bluntness , ‘
167425	167448	167451	167451	I	0	’ Mr Pecksniff regarded him at first with inexpressible surprise ; then gradually breaking into a sort of dejected vivacity , said : ‘

167463	167469	167475	167476	Mr Jonas	415	’ asked Jonas , drily . ‘
167478	167486	167544	167544	Ecod	351	’ replied Pecksniff , with moistening eyes . ‘

167625	167652	167655	167655	you	0	’ Again Mr Jonas looked at the landscape ; then at the coachman ; then at the luggage on the roof ; finally at Mr Pecksniff . ‘
167670	167682	167691	167691	Years	435	’ he observed , as he caught that gentleman ’s eye . ‘
167685	167690	167715	167715	Cherry--	436	’ said the parent . ‘
167716	167717	167715	167715	Cherry--	436	’ ‘
167722	167726	167715	167715	Cherry--	436	’ interrupted Jonas . ‘
167753	167770	167771	167773	the best judge	4014	’re not obliged to do it , you know , if you do n’t like . You ’re
167775	167927	167928	167928	I	0	’ There was a warning sulkiness in the manner of this speech , which admonished Mr Pecksniff that his dear friend was not to be trifled with or fenced off , and that he must either return a straight - forward reply to his question , or plainly give him to understand that he declined to enlighten him upon the subject to which it referred . Mindful in this dilemma of the caution old Anthony had given him almost with his latest breath , he resolved to speak to the point , and so told Mr Jonas ( enlarging upon the communication as a proof of his great attachment and confidence ) , that in the case he had put ; to wit , in the event of such a man as he proposing for his daughter ’s hand , he would endow her with a fortune of four thousand pounds . ‘
167939	167945	167984	167984	I	0	’ was his fatherly remark ; ‘
167997	168099	167984	167984	I	0	’ The good man ’s enemies would have divided upon this question into two parties . One would have asserted without scruple that if Mr Pecksniff ’s conscience were his bank , and he kept a running account there , he must have overdrawn it beyond all mortal means of computation . The other would have contended that it was a mere fictitious form ; a perfectly blank book ; or one in which entries were only made with a peculiar kind of invisible ink to become legible at some indefinite time ; and that he never troubled it at all . ‘
168112	168117	168619	168619	he	437	’ repeated Mr Pecksniff , ‘
168146	168608	168619	168619	he	437	’ A question of philosophy arises here , whether Mr Pecksniff had or had not good reason to say that he was specially patronized and encouraged in his undertakings . All his life long he had been walking up and down the narrow ways and by - places , with a hook in one hand and a crook in the other , scraping all sorts of valuable odds and ends into his pouch . Now , there being a special Providence in the fall of a sparrow , it follows ( so Mr Pecksniff , and only such admirable men , would have reasoned ) , that there must also be a special Providence in the alighting of the stone or stick , or other substance which is aimed at the sparrow . And Mr Pecksniff ’s hook , or crook , having invariably knocked the sparrow on the head and brought him down , that gentleman may have been led to consider himself as specially licensed to bag sparrows , and as being specially seized and possessed of all the birds he had got together . That many undertakings , national as well as individual -- but especially the former -- are held to be specially brought to a glorious and successful issue , which never could be so regarded on any other process of reasoning , must be clear to all men . Therefore the precedents would seem to show that Mr Pecksniff had ( as things go ) good argument for what he said and might be permitted to say it , and did not say it presumptuously , vainly , or arrogantly , but in a spirit of high faith and great wisdom . Mr Jonas , not being much accustomed to perplex his mind with theories of this nature , expressed no opinion on the subject . Nor did he receive his companion ’s announcement with one solitary syllable , good , bad , or indifferent . He preserved this taciturnity for a quarter of an hour at least , and during the whole of that time appeared to be steadily engaged in subjecting some given amount to the operation of every known rule in figures ; adding to it , taking from it , multiplying it , reducing it by long and short division ; working it by the rule - of - three direct and inversed ; exchange or barter ; practice ; simple interest ; compound interest ; and other means of arithmetical calculation . The result of these labours appeared to be satisfactory , for when he did break silence , it was as one who had arrived at some specific result , and freed himself from a state of distressing uncertainty . ‘
168637	168638	168619	168619	he	437	’ ‘
168644	168649	168619	168619	he	437	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘
168656	168660	168765	168765	I	0	’ cried Jonas . ‘
168681	168764	168792	168793	this Pecksniff	4021	’ faltered Mr Pecksniff . Jonas only laughed at this , and getting down from the coach - top with great alacrity , cut a cumbersome kind of caper in the road . After which , he went into the public - house , and there ordered spirituous drink to such an extent , that Mr Pecksniff had some doubts of his perfect sanity , until Jonas set them quite at rest by saying , when the coach could wait no longer : ‘
168795	169336	168792	168793	this Pecksniff	4021	’ It was not a joke either , as Mr Pecksniff at first supposed ; for he went off to the coach without further ceremony , and left his respected victim to settle the bill . But Mr Pecksniff was a man of meek endurance , and Mr Jonas was his friend . Moreover , his regard for that gentleman was founded , as we know , on pure esteem , and a knowledge of the excellence of his character . He came out from the tavern with a smiling face , and even went so far as to repeat the performance , on a less expensive scale , at the next ale - house . There was a certain wildness in the spirits of Mr Jonas ( not usually a part of his character ) which was far from being subdued by these means , and , for the rest of the journey , he was so very buoyant -- it may be said , boisterous -- that Mr Pecksniff had some difficulty in keeping pace with him . They were not expected -- oh dear , no ! Mr Pecksniff had proposed in London to give the girls a surprise , and had said he would n’t write a word to prepare them on any account , in order that he and Mr Jonas might take them unawares , and just see what they were doing , when they thought their dear papa was miles and miles away . As a consequence of this playful device , there was nobody to meet them at the finger - post , but that was of small consequence , for they had come down by the day coach , and Mr Pecksniff had only a carpetbag , while Mr Jonas had only a portmanteau . They took the portmanteau between them , put the bag upon it , and walked off up the lane without delay ; Mr Pecksniff already going on tiptoe as if , without this precaution , his fond children , being then at a distance of a couple of miles or so , would have some filial sense of his approach . It was a lovely evening in the spring - time of the year ; and in the soft stillness of the twilight , all nature was very calm and beautiful . The day had been fine and warm ; but at the coming on of night , the air grew cool , and in the mellowing distance smoke was rising gently from the cottage chimneys . There were a thousand pleasant scents diffused around , from young leaves and fresh buds ; the cuckoo had been singing all day long , and was but just now hushed ; the smell of earth newly - upturned , first breath of hope to the first labourer after his garden withered , was fragrant in the evening breeze . It was a time when most men cherish good resolves , and sorrow for the wasted past ; when most men , looking on the shadows as they gather , think of that evening which must close on all , and that to - morrow which has none beyond . ‘
169340	169348	169362	169362	We	4023	’ said Mr Jonas , looking about . ‘
169360	169361	169377	169377	We	4023	’ ‘
169371	169376	169391	169391	Jonas	415	’ observed Mr Pecksniff . ‘
169380	169389	169391	169391	Jonas	415	‘ em by the time we get there , ’
169393	169408	169421	169421	Pecksniff	415	‘ Why the devil do n’t you talk ? What are you thinking of ? ’
169409	169419	169421	169421	Pecksniff	415	‘ To tell you the truth , Mr Jonas , ’
169426	169444	169459	169459	his	415	‘ my mind was running at that moment on our late dear friend , your departed father . ’
169462	169468	169502	169502	Jonas	415	‘ Drop that , Pecksniff ! ’
169493	169500	169502	169502	Jonas	415	‘ Drop it , I say ! ’
169506	169528	169538	169539	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Do you hear ? Drop it , now and for ever . You had better , I give you notice ! ’
169529	169536	169538	169539	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ It was quite a mistake , ’
169545	169563	169576	169576	Jonas	415	‘ though I admit it was foolish . I might have known it was a tender string . ’
169564	169574	169538	169539	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Do n’t talk to me about tender strings , ’
169588	169590	169576	169576	Jonas	415	‘ I ’m
169608	169616	169620	169621	Mr Jonas	415	’ Mr Pecksniff had got out the words ‘
169623	169643	169651	169651	I	0	’ when that young man , with a dark expression in his countenance , cut him short once more : ‘
169646	169650	169657	169657	I	0	’ he said . ‘
169698	169756	169907	169907	we	4028	’ Taking up his part of the load again , when he had said these words , he hurried on so fast that Mr Pecksniff , at the other end of the portmanteau , found himself dragged forward , in a very inconvenient and ungraceful manner , to the great detriment of what is called by fancy gentlemen ‘
169759	169900	169907	169907	we	4028	’ upon his shins , which were most unmercifully bumped against the hard leather and the iron buckles . In the course of a few minutes , however , Mr Jonas relaxed his speed , and suffered his companion to come up with him , and to bring the portmanteau into a tolerably straight position . It was pretty clear that he regretted his late outbreak , and that he mistrusted its effect on Mr Pecksniff ; for as often as that gentleman glanced towards Mr Jonas , he found Mr Jonas glancing at him , which was a new source of embarrassment . It was but a short - lived one , though , for Mr Jonas soon began to whistle , whereupon Mr Pecksniff , taking his cue from his friend , began to hum a tune melodiously . ‘
169909	169920	169907	169907	we	4028	’ said Jonas , when this had lasted some time . ‘
169927	169932	169940	169940	you	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘
169943	169947	169940	169940	you	0	’ asked Jonas . ‘
169952	169957	169977	169977	he	0	’ cried Mr Pecksniff . ‘
169985	169990	170010	170011	Mr Jonas	415	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
170013	170239	170307	170307	he	415	’ It might not have been easy to decide in respect of which of their manifold properties , Jonas , Mr Pecksniff , the carpet - bag , and the portmanteau , could be likened to a clap of thunder . But Mr Jonas giving his assent to this proposal , they stole round into the back yard , and softly advanced towards the kitchen window , through which the mingled light of fire and candle shone upon the darkening night . Truly Mr Pecksniff is blessed in his children -- in one of them , at any rate . The prudent Cherry -- staff and scrip , and treasure of her doting father -- there she sits , at a little table white as driven snow , before the kitchen fire , making up accounts ! See the neat maiden , as with pen in hand , and calculating look addressed towards the ceiling and bunch of keys within a little basket at her side , she checks the housekeeping expenditure ! From flat - iron , dish - cover , and warming - pan ; from pot and kettle , face of brass footman , and black - leaded stove ; bright glances of approbation wink and glow upon her . The very onions dangling from the beam , mantle and shine like cherubs ’
170303	170306	170307	170307	he	415	‘ Pleasant , ’
170310	170334	170359	170359	he	415	‘ pleasant to a father ’s feelings ! My dear girl ! Shall we let her know we are here , Mr Jonas ? ’
170335	170358	170392	170392	he	415	‘ Why , I suppose you do n’t mean to spend the evening in the stable , or the coach - house , ’
170362	170381	170392	170392	he	415	‘ That , indeed , is not such hospitality as I would show to YOU , my friend , ’
170409	170412	170436	170438	the valiant girl	4034	‘ Boh ! ’
170462	170480	170517	170517	Pecksniff	415	‘ Who are you ? What do you want ? Speak ! or I will call my Pa. ’
170500	170515	170540	170540	she	4034	‘ It was thoughtless of us , Mr Jonas , it was very thoughtless , ’
170525	170538	170630	170631	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ My darling , do you see that I am not alone ! ’
170622	170628	170630	170631	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ But call her down , ’
170638	170646	170691	170693	the arch girl	4037	‘ Call her down , my love . ’
170683	170689	170700	170700	she	4034	‘ Oh my goodness me ! ’
170726	170735	170739	170739	you	9926	‘ YOU here , fright ! Well , I ’m
170746	170747	170762	170762	Jonas	415	’ ‘
170751	170760	170769	170771	a wicked one	4040	’re as lively as ever , are you ? ’
170764	170768	170769	170771	a wicked one	4040	‘ Oh ! You ’re
170773	170774	170769	170771	a wicked one	4040	’ ‘
170780	170788	170750	170750	you	9926	’ retorted Merry , pushing him away . ‘
170790	170816	170750	170750	you	9926	’m sure I do n’t know what I shall ever do , if I have to see much of you . Go along , for gracious ’
170819	171076	170750	170750	you	9926	’ Mr Pecksniff striking in here , with a request that Mr Jonas would immediately walk upstairs , he so far complied with the young lady ’s adjuration as to go at once . But though he had the fair Cherry on his arm , he could not help looking back at her sister , and exchanging some further dialogue of the same bantering description , as they all four ascended to the parlour ; where -- for the young ladies happened , by good fortune , to be a little later than usual that night -- the tea - board was at that moment being set out . Mr Pinch was not at home , so they had it all to themselves , and were very snug and talkative , Jonas sitting between the two sisters , and displaying his gallantry in that engaging manner which was peculiar to him . It was a hard thing , Mr Pecksniff said , when tea was done , and cleared away , to leave so pleasant a little party , but having some important papers to examine in his own apartment , he must beg them to excuse him for half an hour . With this apology he withdrew , singing a careless strain as he went . He had not been gone five minutes , when Merry , who had been sitting in the window , apart from Jonas and her sister , burst into a half - smothered laugh , and skipped towards the door . ‘
171079	171083	171092	171092	I	0	’ cried Jonas . ‘
171088	171089	171104	171104	You	0	’ ‘
171096	171103	171127	171127	Jonas	415	’ rejoined Merry , looking back . ‘
171105	171118	171127	171127	Jonas	415	’re very anxious I should stay , fright , ai n’t you ? ’
171119	171125	171127	171127	Jonas	415	‘ Yes , I am , ’
171129	171143	171186	171188	that young lady	9694	‘ Upon my word I am . I want to speak to you . ’
171177	171184	171186	171188	that young lady	9694	‘ Upon my word , Merry , ’
171190	171206	171216	171216	Merry	317	‘ I wonder at you ! There are bounds even to absurdity , my dear . ’
171207	171214	171216	171216	Merry	317	‘ Thank you , my sweet , ’
171224	171245	171300	171300	Jonas	415	‘ Much obliged to it for its advice . Oh ! do leave me alone , you monster , do ! ’
171295	171298	171300	171300	Jonas	415	‘ Now , ’
171308	171320	171344	171346	the playful Merry	317	‘ I have got both arms full , have n’t I ? ’
171321	171342	171360	171360	Jonas	415	‘ One of them will be black and blue to - morrow , if you do n’t let me go , ’
171348	171358	171360	171360	Jonas	415	‘ Ah ! I do n’t mind YOUR pinching , ’
171362	171366	171379	171379	Mercy	244	‘ a bit . ’
171367	171377	171379	171379	Mercy	244	‘ Pinch him for me , Cherry , pray , ’
171381	171398	171411	171411	Jonas	415	‘ I never did hate anybody so much as I hate this creature , I declare ! ’
171399	171409	171411	171411	Jonas	415	‘ No , no , do n’t say that , ’
171413	171432	171439	171439	she	244	‘ and do n’t pinch either , because I want to be serious . I say -- Cousin Charity-- ’
171433	171438	171454	171454	Jonas	415	‘ Well ! what ? ’
171443	171452	171454	171454	Jonas	415	‘ I want to have some sober talk , ’
171456	171486	171527	171527	Jonas	415	‘ I want to prevent any mistakes , you know , and to put everything upon a pleasant understanding . That ’s desirable and proper , ai n’t it ? ’
171508	171525	171527	171527	Jonas	415	‘ She ’ll not believe what I am going to say , will she , cousin ? ’
171534	171557	171566	171566	Jonas	415	‘ Really , Mr Jonas , I do n’t know , until I hear what it is . It ’s quite impossible ! ’
171558	171564	171566	171566	Jonas	415	‘ Why , you see , ’
171568	171601	171631	171631	he	0	‘ her way always being to make game of people , I know she ’ll laugh , or pretend to -- I know that , beforehand . But you can tell her I ’m
171627	171630	171666	171666	Jonas	415	’m sure , ’
171657	171664	171810	171810	you	4046	‘ You see , Cousin Charity , ’
171668	171808	171859	171859	his	415	‘ nobody but you can tell her what pains I took to get into her company when you were both at the boarding - house in the city , because nobody ’s so well aware of it , you know . Nobody else can tell her how hard I tried to get to know you better , in order that I might get to know her without seeming to wish it ; can they ? I always asked you about her , and said where had she gone , and when would she come , and how lively she was , and all that ; did n’t I , cousin ? I know you ’ll tell her so , if you have n’t told her so already , and -- and -- I dare say you have , because I ’m
171811	171818	171884	171884	Jonas	415	’re honourable , ai n’t you ? ’
171867	171882	171977	171977	he	415	‘ Even if you kept it to yourself , and have n’t told her , ’
171886	171975	172045	172045	Merry	317	‘ it do n’t much matter , because you ’ll bear honest witness now ; wo n’t you ? We ’ve been very good friends from the first ; have n’t we ? and of course we shall be quite friends in future , and so I do n’t mind speaking before you a bit . Cousin Mercy , you ’ve heard what I ’ve been saying . She ’ll confirm it , every word ; she must . Will you have me for your husband ? Eh ? ’
172031	172043	172007	172007	she	4048	‘ Let me go away . Let me go after her , ’
172070	172091	172045	172045	Merry	317	‘ Not till you say yes . You have n’t told me . Will you have me for your husband ? ’
172092	172138	172149	172149	Jonas	415	‘ No , I wo n’t . I ca n’t bear the sight of you . I have told you so a hundred times . You are a fright . Besides , I always thought you liked my sister best . We all thought so . ’
172139	172147	172149	172149	Jonas	415	‘ But that was n’t my fault , ’
172151	172161	172172	172172	Jonas	415	‘ Yes it was ; you know it was . ’
172162	172170	172172	172172	Jonas	415	‘ Any trick is fair in love , ’
172174	172189	172045	172045	Merry	317	‘ She may have thought I liked her best , but you did n’t . ’
172190	172194	172045	172045	Merry	317	‘ I did ! ’
172195	172217	172228	172228	Merry	317	‘ No , you did n’t . You never could have thought I liked her best , when you were by . ’
172218	172226	172045	172045	Merry	317	‘ There ’s no accounting for tastes , ’
172230	172255	172045	172045	Merry	317	‘ at least I did n’t mean to say that . I do n’t know what I mean . Let me go to her . ’
172256	172267	172045	172045	Merry	317	‘ Say “ Yes , ” and then I will . ’
172268	172293	172302	172302	Jonas	415	‘ If I ever brought myself to say so , it should only be that I might hate and tease you all my life . ’
172294	172300	172320	172321	a pair	4051	‘ That ’s as good , ’
172304	172319	172508	172508	Children	1396	‘ as saying it right out . It ’s a bargain , cousin . We ’re
172329	172507	172539	172539	Girls	9621	’ This gallant speech was succeeded by a confused noise of kissing and slapping ; and then the fair but much dishevelled Merry broke away , and followed in the footsteps of her sister . Now whether Mr Pecksniff had been listening -- which in one of his character appears impossible ; or divined almost by inspiration what the matter was -- which , in a man of his sagacity is far more probable ; or happened by sheer good fortune to find himself in exactly the right place , at precisely the right time -- which , under the special guardianship in which he lived might very reasonably happen ; it is quite certain that at the moment when the sisters came together in their own room , he appeared at the chamber door . And a marvellous contrast it was -- they so heated , noisy , and vehement ; he so calm , so self - possessed , so cool and full of peace , that not a hair upon his head was stirred . ‘
172510	172538	172549	172550	The wretch	4055	’ said Mr Pecksniff , spreading out his hands in wonder , but not before he had shut the door , and set his back against it . ‘
172547	172548	172570	172570	Mercy	439	’ ‘
172572	172580	172593	172593	HE	4058	’ was his eldest daughter ’s answer . ‘
172587	172592	172599	172599	Jonas	415	’ asked Mr Pecksniff . ‘
172603	172604	172605	172605	Jonas	415	’ ‘
172610	172615	172599	172599	Jonas	415	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘

172631	172635	172645	172645	He	4058	’ cried Charity . ‘

172664	172671	172794	172794	Jonas	415	’ said Mr Pecksniff , gravely . ‘
172739	172793	172802	172802	Jonas	415	’ Uttering this apostrophe in a tone full of grief and lamentation , Mr Pecksniff left the room ( taking care to shut the door behind him ) , and walked downstairs into the parlour . There he found his intended son - in - law , whom he seized by both hands . ‘
172796	172801	172819	172819	I	0	’ cried Mr Pecksniff . ‘
172814	172815	172828	172828	Jonas	415	’ ‘
172820	172826	172828	172828	Jonas	415	’m glad to hear it , ’
172830	172845	173037	173038	Mr Pinch	221	‘ That ’ll do . I say ! As it ai n’t the one you ’re
172898	173036	173037	173038	Mr Pinch	221	’ The grin with which he accompanied this , set off his other attractions to such unspeakable advantage , that even Mr Pecksniff lost his presence of mind for a moment , and looked at the young man as if he were quite stupefied with wonder and admiration . But he quickly regained his composure , and was in the very act of changing the subject , when a hasty step was heard without , and Tom Pinch , in a state of great excitement , came darting into the room . On seeing a stranger there , apparently engaged with Mr Pecksniff in private conversation , Tom was very much abashed , though he still looked as if he had something of great importance to communicate , which would be a sufficient apology for his intrusion . ‘
173040	173044	173063	173064	Mr Pinch	221	’ said Pecksniff , ‘
173066	173067	173073	173073	sir	864	’ ‘
173075	173079	173073	173073	sir	864	’ replied Tom , ‘

173117	173151	173153	173153	I	0	’ The son - in - law that was to be gave him a slight nod -- not actively disdainful or contemptuous , only passively ; for he was in a good humour . ‘

173234	173251	173264	173264	It	4071	’ said Tom , standing , cap in hand , before his patron in the passage ; ‘

173841	173848	173822	173822	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , pondering , ‘

173914	174151	174152	174152	Dear	10343	’ Tom ’s teeth chattered in his head , and he positively staggered with amazement , at witnessing the extraordinary effect produced on Mr Pecksniff by these simple words . The dread of losing the old man ’s favour almost as soon as they were reconciled , through the mere fact of having Jonas in the house ; the impossibility of dismissing Jonas , or shutting him up , or tying him hand and foot and putting him in the coal - cellar , without offending him beyond recall ; the horrible discordance prevailing in the establishment , and the impossibility of reducing it to decent harmony with Charity in loud hysterics , Mercy in the utmost disorder , Jonas in the parlour , and Martin Chuzzlewit and his young charge upon the very doorsteps ; the total hopelessness of being able to disguise or feasibly explain this state of rampant confusion ; the sudden accumulation over his devoted head of every complicated perplexity and entanglement for his extrication from which he had trusted to time , good fortune , chance , and his own plotting , so filled the entrapped architect with dismay , that if Tom could have been a Gorgon staring at Mr Pecksniff , and Mr Pecksniff could have been a Gorgon staring at Tom , they could not have horrified each other half so much as in their own bewildered persons . ‘
174156	174160	174177	174177	I	0	’ cried Tom , ‘
174185	174847	174938	174938	Martin	221	’ But at that moment a loud knocking was heard at the hall door . CHAPTER TWENTY - ONE MORE AMERICAN EXPERIENCES , MARTIN TAKES A PARTNER , AND MAKES A PURCHASE . SOME ACCOUNT OF EDEN , AS IT APPEARED ON PAPER . ALSO OF THE BRITISH LION . ALSO OF THE KIND OF SYMPATHY PROFESSED AND ENTERTAINED BY THE WATERTOAST ASSOCIATION OF UNITED SYMPATHISERS The knocking at Mr Pecksniff ’s door , though loud enough , bore no resemblance whatever to the noise of an American railway train at full speed . It may be well to begin the present chapter with this frank admission , lest the reader should imagine that the sounds now deafening this history ’s ears have any connection with the knocker on Mr Pecksniff ’s door , or with the great amount of agitation pretty equally divided between that worthy man and Mr Pinch , of which its strong performance was the cause . Mr Pecksniff ’s house is more than a thousand leagues away ; and again this happy chronicle has Liberty and Moral Sensibility for its high companions . Again it breathes the blessed air of Independence ; again it contemplates with pious awe that moral sense which renders unto Ceasar nothing that is his ; again inhales that sacred atmosphere which was the life of him -- oh noble patriot , with many followers!--who dreamed of Freedom in a slave ’s embrace , and waking sold her offspring and his own in public markets . How the wheels clank and rattle , and the tram - road shakes , as the train rushes on ! And now the engine yells , as it were lashed and tortured like a living labourer , and writhed in agony . A poor fancy ; for steel and iron are of infinitely greater account , in this commonwealth , than flesh and blood . If the cunning work of man be urged beyond its power of endurance , it has within it the elements of its own revenge ; whereas the wretched mechanism of the Divine Hand is dangerous with no such property , but may be tampered with , and crushed , and broken , at the driver ’s pleasure . Look at that engine ! It shall cost a man more dollars in the way of penalty and fine , and satisfaction of the outraged law , to deface in wantonness that senseless mass of metal , than to take the lives of twenty human creatures ! Thus the stars wink upon the bloody stripes ; and Liberty pulls down her cap upon her eyes , and owns Oppression in its vilest aspect , for her sister . The engine - driver of the train whose noise awoke us to the present chapter was certainly troubled with no such reflections as these ; nor is it very probable that his mind was disturbed by any reflections at all . He leaned with folded arms and crossed legs against the side of the carriage , smoking ; and , except when he expressed , by a grunt as short as his pipe , his approval of some particularly dexterous aim on the part of his colleague , the fireman , who beguiled his leisure by throwing logs of wood from the tender at the numerous stray cattle on the line , he preserved a composure so immovable , and an indifference so complete , that if the locomotive had been a sucking - pig , he could not have been more perfectly indifferent to its doings . Notwithstanding the tranquil state of this officer , and his unbroken peace of mind , the train was proceeding with tolerable rapidity ; and the rails being but poorly laid , the jolts and bumps it met with in its progress were neither slight nor few . There were three great caravans or cars attached . The ladies ’

174948	174966	174974	174974	Mark	222	‘ and so you are glad we have left New York far behind us , are you ? ’
174967	174972	174974	174974	Mark	222	‘ Yes , sir , ’
174976	174983	174995	174995	Martin	221	‘ I am . Precious glad . ’
174984	174993	175006	175006	Mark	222	‘ Were you not “ jolly ” there ? ’

175008	175028	175040	175040	Martin	221	‘ The jolliest week as ever I spent in my life , was that there week at Pawkins ’s . ’
175029	175038	175065	175065	Mark	222	‘ What do you think of our prospects ? ’
175057	175063	175065	175065	Mark	222	‘ Uncommon bright , sir , ’
175067	175105	175065	175065	Mark	222	‘ Impossible for a place to have a better name , sir , than the Walley of Eden . No man could n’t think of settling in a better place than the Walley of Eden . And I ’m
175108	175116	175241	175243	What military officer	4121	’ added Mark , after a pause , ‘
175136	175200	175213	175215	A military officer	4119	’ So far from dwelling upon this agreeable piece of information with the least dismay , Mark ’s face grew radiant as he called it to mind ; so very radiant , that a stranger might have supposed he had all his life been yearning for the society of serpents , and now hailed with delight the approaching consummation of his fondest wishes . ‘
175206	175212	175213	175215	A military officer	4119	’ asked Martin , sternly . ‘
175217	175221	175241	175243	What military officer	4121	’ said Mark . ‘
175229	175240	175247	175247	they	4122	’ cried Martin , laughing heartily in spite of himself . ‘

You ’re

175600	175610	175643	175643	Mark	222	‘ Why did n’t you tell me this before ! ’
175632	175641	175643	175643	Mark	222	‘ I never thought on it , sir , ’
175645	175696	175707	175707	Martin	221	‘ It come in at one ear , and went out at the other . But Lord love us , he was one of another Company , I dare say , and only made up the story that we might go to his Eden , and not the opposition one . ’
175697	175705	175707	175707	Martin	221	‘ There ’s some probability in that , ’
175709	175724	175738	175738	Mark	222	‘ I can honestly say that I hope so , with all my heart . ’
175725	175736	175738	175738	Mark	222	‘ I ’ve not a doubt about it , sir , ’
175765	175777	175783	175783	Martin	221	‘ anyhow , we must live , you know , sir . ’
175778	175781	175783	175783	Martin	221	‘ Live ! ’
175785	175824	175783	175783	Martin	221	‘ Yes , it ’s easy to say live ; but if we should happen not to wake when rattlesnakes are making corkscrews of themselves upon our beds , it may be not so easy to do it . ’
175825	175832	175783	175783	Martin	221	‘ And that ’s a fact , ’
175846	175852	175956	175956	he	871	‘ That ’s dreadful true . ’
175979	175996	176115	176115	he	871	‘ Now you wo n’t overreach me ; you want to , but you wo n’t . ’

176556	176577	176588	176588	Martin	221	‘ How ’s she ? Progressing back’ards , I expect , as usual ? Well ! How ’s Queen Victoria ? ’
176578	176586	176613	176614	the stranger	9262	‘ In good health , I believe , ’
176590	176611	176613	176614	the stranger	9262	‘ Queen Victoria wo n’t shake in her royal shoes at all , when she hears to - morrow named , ’
176616	176619	176545	176545	he	221	‘ No . ’
176620	176632	176657	176658	the stranger	9262	‘ Not that I am aware of . Why should she ? ’
176633	176655	176657	176658	the stranger	9262	‘ She wo n’t be taken with a cold chill , when she realises what is being done in these diggings , ’

176664	176667	176669	176669	Martin	221	‘ No , ’
176671	176682	176683	176685	The strange gentleman	4146	‘ I think I could take my oath of that . ’
176702	176776	176848	176848	he	4148	‘ Well , sir , I tell you this -- there ai n’t a engine with its biler bust , in God A’mighty ’s free U - nited States , so fixed , and nipped , and frizzled to a most e - tarnal smash , as that young critter , in her luxurious location in the Tower of London will be , when she reads the next double - extra Watertoast Gazette . ’
176839	176847	176848	176848	he	4148	‘ Hem ! Mr La Fayette Kettle , ’
176862	176865	176875	176876	Mr Kettle	446	‘ Hush ! ’
176866	176874	176984	176985	the speaker	823	‘ Mr La Fayette Kettle ! Sir ! ’
176879	176982	177001	177001	he	221	‘ In the name of this company , sir , and in the name of our common country , and in the name of that righteous cause of holy sympathy in which we are engaged , I thank you . I thank you , sir , in the name of the Watertoast Sympathisers ; and I thank you , sir , in the name of the Watertoast Gazette ; and I thank you , sir , in the name of the star - spangled banner of the Great United States , for your eloquent and categorical exposition . And if , sir , ’
177010	177104	177131	177134	Mr La Fayette Kettle	446	‘ if , sir , in such a place , and at such a time , I might venture to con - clude with a sentiment , glancing -- however slantin’dicularly -- at the subject in hand , I would say , sir , may the British Lion have his talons eradicated by the noble bill of the American Eagle , and be taught to play upon the Irish Harp and the Scotch Fiddle that music which is breathed in every empty shell that lies upon the shores of green Co - lumbia ! ’
177125	177129	177131	177134	Mr La Fayette Kettle	446	‘ General Choke , ’
177136	177173	177181	177181	Martin	221	‘ you warm my heart ; sir , you warm my heart . But the British Lion is not unrepresented here , sir ; and I should be glad to hear his answer to those remarks . ’
177174	177179	177181	177181	Martin	221	‘ Upon my word , ’
177185	177227	177228	177229	General Choke	447	‘ since you do me the honour to consider me his representative , I have only to say that I never heard of Queen Victoria reading the What’s - his - name Gazette and that I should scarcely think it probable . ’
177244	177262	177287	177287	Martin	221	‘ It is sent to her , sir . It is sent to her . Her mail . ’
177263	177285	177287	177287	Martin	221	‘ But if it is addressed to the Tower of London , it would hardly come to hand , I fear , ’
177289	177297	177308	177309	Mr Tapley	309	‘ for she do n’t live there . ’
177298	177306	177308	177309	Mr Tapley	309	‘ The Queen of England , gentlemen , ’
177324	177371	177377	177377	Martin	221	‘ usually lives in the Mint to take care of the money . She HAS lodgings , in virtue of her office , with the Lord Mayor at the Mansion House ; but do n’t often occupy them , in consequence of the parlour chimney smoking . ’
177372	177375	177377	177377	Martin	221	‘ Mark , ’
177379	177441	177447	177450	Mr La Fayette Kettle	446	‘ I shall be very much obliged to you if you ’ll have the goodness not to interfere with preposterous statements , however jocose they may appear to you . I was merely remarking gentlemen -- though it ’s a point of very little import -- that the Queen of England does not happen to live in the Tower of London . ’
177442	177445	177447	177450	Mr La Fayette Kettle	446	‘ General ! ’
177452	177456	177462	177463	several others	4153	‘ You hear ? ’
177457	177460	177462	177463	several others	4153	‘ General ! ’
177465	177468	177478	177479	General Choke	447	‘ General ! ’
177469	177476	177478	177479	General Choke	447	‘ Hush ! Pray , silence ! ’
177499	177517	177584	177584	you	4159	‘ I have always remarked it as a very extraordinary circumstance , which I impute to the natur ’
177589	177596	177650	177650	she	4161	’ he continued , addressing Martin , ‘

177660	177664	177650	177650	she	4161	’ interposed Kettle . ‘
177679	177690	177710	177710	Your	4159	’ returned the General , in the same benignant way ; ‘
177717	177731	177827	177829	a reading people	4179	’ pursued the General , smiling with a mild consciousness of his knowledge , ‘
177782	177787	177827	177829	a reading people	4179	’ said the General , ‘
177796	177797	177799	177799	you	4159	’ ‘
177804	177808	177811	177811	I	0	’ asked Martin . ‘
177816	177821	177851	177851	I	0	’ said the General , ‘
177849	177850	177851	177851	I	0	’ ‘
177860	177881	177884	177885	General Choke	447	’ returned Martin . But here he was interrupted by Mr La Fayette Kettle , who whispered in his ear : ‘
177887	177888	177884	177885	General Choke	447	’ ‘
177891	177900	177904	177904	he	447	’ returned Martin , in the same tone . ‘
177908	177909	177904	177904	he	447	’ ‘
177920	177928	177939	177939	I	0	’ said Martin , at a venture . ‘
177934	177938	177942	177942	you	864	’ rejoined Kettle . ‘
177949	177950	177951	177951	I	0	’ ‘
177954	177965	177986	177987	Mr Bevan	220	’ said Martin , addressing himself to the General again , ‘
177992	178043	178052	178052	you	864	’ he added , giving it to him . The General took it and read it attentively ; now and then stopping to glance at the two strangers . When he had finished the note , he came over to Martin , sat down by him , and shook hands . ‘
178046	178050	178052	178052	you	864	’ he said , ‘
178059	178060	178067	178068	the agent	4187	’ ‘
178072	178076	178093	178093	I	0	’ replied Martin . ‘
178091	178092	178101	178101	sir	864	’ ‘
178103	178108	178198	178198	We	4193	’ said the General . ‘
178127	178197	178198	178198	We	4193	’ This was serious news to Martin , for his friend had laid great stress upon the General ’s having no connection , as he thought , with any land company , and therefore being likely to give him disinterested advice . The General explained that he had joined the Corporation only a few weeks ago , and that no communication had passed between himself and Mr Bevan since . ‘
178205	178244	178250	178251	the General	9448	’ said Martin anxiously--‘only a few pounds -- but it is our all . Now , do you think that for one of my profession , this would be a speculation with any hope or chance in it ? ’
178245	178248	178250	178251	the General	9448	‘ Well , ’
178255	178279	178291	178291	Martin	221	‘ if there was n’t any hope or chance in the speculation , it would n’t have engaged my dollars , I opinionate . ’

178424	178460	178487	178487	I	0	’ said the General , setting up his umbrella to represent himself , and a villanous - looking umbrella it was ; a very bad counter to stand for the sterling coin of his benevolence , ‘
178502	178521	178524	178527	the Great United States	12224	’ Martin tried to look convinced , but he thought of New York , and found it difficult . ‘

179474	179479	179480	179480	I	0	’ answered Mr Tapley , ‘
179486	179487	179495	179495	you	4270	’ ‘
179497	179507	179539	179539	Mark	222	’ asked Martin , holding up a little bag . ‘
179518	179537	179571	179571	Martin	221	’ Bank said so at least . I never counted it . But THEY know , bless you ! ’
179561	179569	179571	179571	Martin	221	‘ The money we brought with us , ’
179573	179585	179623	179623	Martin	221	‘ is reduced to a few shillings less than eight pounds . ’
179611	179621	179636	179637	Mr Tapley	309	‘ Upon the ring -- HER ring , Mark , ’
179631	179634	179636	179637	Mr Tapley	309	‘ Ah ! ’
179639	179646	179687	179687	Martin	221	‘ Beg your pardon , sir . ’
179647	179685	179696	179696	he	221	‘ --We raised , in English money , fourteen pounds . So , even with that , your share of the stock is still very much the larger of the two you see . Now , Mark , ’
179704	179738	179755	179755	Mark	222	‘ I have thought of a means of making this up to you -- more than making it up to you , I hope -- and very materially elevating your prospects in life . ’
179739	179753	179755	179755	Mark	222	‘ Oh ! do n’t talk of that , you know , sir , ’
179757	179768	179773	179773	sir	864	‘ I do n’t want no elevating , sir . I ’m

179786	179790	179907	179907	I	0	’ said Martin , ‘
179857	179906	179938	179938	I	0	’ Poor Martin ! For ever building castles in the air . For ever , in his very selfishness , forgetful of all but his own teeming hopes and sanguine plans . Swelling , at that instant , with the consciousness of patronizing and most munificently rewarding Mark ! ‘
179914	179936	179977	179977	We	4278	’ Mark rejoined , much more sadly than his custom was , though from a very different cause than Martin supposed , ‘
179975	179976	179977	179977	We	4278	’ ‘
179987	179998	180066	180066	Lord	4286	’ said Martin rising in self - approval and condescension . ‘
180039	180055	180062	180062	Tapley	309	’ said Martin , who never hammered upon an idea that was n’t red hot , ‘
180064	180065	180066	180066	Lord	4286	’ ‘
180072	180076	180103	180103	I	0	’ cried Mark , ‘
180108	180117	180142	180142	You	0	’ he added , in a low voice , ‘
180140	180141	180149	180149	Mark	222	’ ‘
180151	180152	180182	180182	I	0	’ ‘
180193	180194	180182	180182	I	0	’ ‘
180202	180206	180215	180215	Mark	222	’ said Martin . ‘
180226	180460	180846	180846	Gen’ral	454	’ Either he forgot already ( and often afterwards ) , that they were no longer master and servant , or considered this kind of duty to be among the legitimate functions of the Co. But Mark obeyed with his usual alacrity ; and before they parted for the night , it was agreed between them that they should go together to the agent ’s in the morning , but that Martin should decide the Eden question , on his own sound judgment . And Mark made no merit , even to himself in his jollity , of this concession ; perfectly well knowing that the matter would come to that in the end , any way . The General was one of the party at the public table next day , and after breakfast suggested that they should wait upon the agent without loss of time . They , desiring nothing more , agreed ; so off they all four started for the office of the Eden Settlement , which was almost within rifle - shot of the National Hotel . It was a small place -- something like a turnpike . But a great deal of land may be got into a dice - box , and why may not a whole territory be bargained for in a shed ? It was but a temporary office too ; for the Edeners were ‘
180462	180843	180846	180846	Gen’ral	454	’ to build a superb establishment for the transaction of their business , and had already got so far as to mark out the site . Which is a great way in America . The office - door was wide open , and in the doorway was the agent ; no doubt a tremendous fellow to get through his work , for he seemed to have no arrears , but was swinging backwards and forwards in a rocking - chair , with one of his legs planted high up against the door - post , and the other doubled up under him , as if he were hatching his foot . He was a gaunt man in a huge straw hat , and a coat of green stuff . The weather being hot , he had no cravat , and wore his shirt collar wide open ; so that every time he spoke something was seen to twitch and jerk up in his throat , like the little hammers in a harpsichord when the notes are struck . Perhaps it was the Truth feebly endeavouring to leap to his lips . If so , it never reached them . Two grey eyes lurked deep within this agent ’s head , but one of them had no sight in it , and stood stock still . With that side of his face he seemed to listen to what the other side was doing . Thus each profile had a distinct expression ; and when the movable side was most in action , the rigid one was in its coldest state of watchfulness . It was like turning the man inside out , to pass to that view of his features in his liveliest mood , and see how calculating and intent they were . Each long black hair upon his head hung down as straight as any plummet line ; but rumpled tufts were on the arches of his eyes , as if the crow whose foot was deeply printed in the corners had pecked and torn them in a savage recognition of his kindred nature as a bird of prey . Such was the man whom they now approached , and whom the General saluted by the name of Scadder . ‘
180848	180852	180856	180856	you	454	’ he returned , ‘
180858	180859	180883	180884	Mr Scadder	453	’ ‘
180886	180909	180932	180932	sir	864	’ He shook hands with each of them -- nothing is done in America without shaking hands -- then went on rocking . ‘
180928	180929	180936	180936	you	864	’ ‘
180939	180940	180952	180952	you	454	’ ‘
180962	180966	180997	180997	your	864	’ said Scadder . ‘
180991	180992	181017	181017	You	864	’ ‘
181006	181016	181017	181017	You	864	’ returned the General , after pausing for consideration . ‘
181037	181041	181017	181017	You	864	’ said Scadder ; ‘
181049	181055	181062	181062	they	4307	‘ em for Aristocrats of Natur ’
181059	181060	181062	181062	they	4307	’ ‘
181068	181075	181080	181080	sir	864	’ cried the General with warmth . ‘
181082	181083	181080	181080	sir	864	’ ‘
181089	181098	181116	181116	Gen’ral	454	’ returned the agent , in reproachful accents , ‘
181118	181149	181188	181188	They	4312	’ The General whispered Martin that Scadder was the honestest fellow in the world , and that he would n’t have given him offence designedly , for ten thousand dollars . ‘
181171	181187	181220	181221	the General	9448	’ said Scadder in a low voice , looking down the road and rocking still . ‘
181209	181213	181220	181221	the General	9448	’ ! Well ! ’
181214	181218	181220	181221	the General	9448	‘ Mr Scadder , ’
181228	181265	181294	181297	these air partick’ler friends	4319	‘ Sir ! Here is my hand , and here my heart . I esteem you , sir , and ask your pardon . These gentlemen air friends of mine , or I would not have brought ‘
181299	181402	181294	181297	these air partick’ler friends	4319	’ Mr Scadder was so satisfied by this explanation , that he shook the General warmly by the hand , and got out of the rocking - chair to do it . He then invited the General ’s particular friends to accompany him into the office . As to the General , he observed , with his usual benevolence , that being one of the company , he would n’t interfere in the transaction on any account ; so he appropriated the rocking - chair to himself , and looked at the prospect , like a good Samaritan waiting for a traveller . ‘
181405	181457	181468	181468	Eden	96	’ cried Martin , as his eye rested on a great plan which occupied one whole side of the office . Indeed , the office had little else in it , but some geological and botanical specimens , one or two rusty ledgers , a homely desk , and a stool . ‘
181464	181465	181468	181468	Eden	96	’ ‘
181470	181495	181498	181498	I	0	’ said Scadder , picking his teeth with a sort of young bayonet that flew out of his knife when he touched a spring . ‘
181507	181508	181589	181589	me	0	’ ‘
181520	181587	181589	181589	me	0	’ A flourishing city , too ! An architectural city ! There were banks , churches , cathedrals , market - places , factories , hotels , stores , mansions , wharves ; an exchange , a theatre ; public buildings of all kinds , down to the office of the Eden Stinger , a daily journal ; all faithfully depicted in the view before them . ‘
181599	181605	181589	181589	me	0	’ cried Martin turning round . ‘
181613	181618	181621	181621	I	0	’ observed the agent . ‘
181625	181636	181621	181621	I	0	’ said Martin , glancing again at the Public Buildings , ‘
181647	181648	181733	181733	Mark	222	’ ‘
181657	181662	181733	181733	Mark	222	’ replied the agent . ‘
181666	181673	181733	181733	Mark	222	’ This was a great relief . ‘
181681	181685	181733	181733	Mark	222	’ said Martin . ‘
181690	181691	181733	181733	Mark	222	’ ‘
181694	181709	181733	181733	Mark	222	’ said the agent , sticking his toothpick into the weathercock on the top . ‘
181721	181722	181767	181767	Uncommon	455	’ ‘
181735	181766	181767	181767	Uncommon	455	’ whispered Martin nudging him with his elbow . Mark , who , with a very stolid countenance had been eyeing the plan and the agent by turns , merely rejoined ‘
181769	181806	181807	181807	I	0	’ A dead silence ensued , Mr Scadder in some short recesses or vacations of his toothpick , whistled a few bars of Yankee Doodle , and blew the dust off the roof of the Theatre . ‘
181810	181841	181847	181848	several architects	4324	’ said Martin , feigning to look more narrowly at the plan , but showing by his tremulous voice how much depended , in his mind , upon the answer ; ‘
181851	181852	181865	181865	Mark	222	’ ‘
181860	181864	181865	181865	Mark	222	’ said Scadder . ‘
181867	181877	181865	181865	Mark	222	’ whispered Martin , pulling him by the sleeve , ‘
181894	181899	181950	181950	my	0	’ he asked aloud . ‘
181913	181947	181953	181954	young man	2195	’ said Mark . He was on the agent ’s dark side as he said it ; but Scadder instantly changed his place , and brought his active eye to bear upon him . ‘
181956	181960	181953	181954	young man	2195	’ he said . ‘
181964	181970	182036	182036	I	0	’ asked Mark , declining . ‘
181982	182035	182036	182036	I	0	’ said Scadder , holding them out . In a physical point of view they were decidedly dirty . But it being obvious that Mr Scadder offered them for examination in a figurative sense , as emblems of his moral character , Martin hastened to pronounce them pure as the driven snow . ‘
182041	182049	182087	182087	I	0	’ he said , with some irritation , ‘
182092	182093	182111	182111	He	4332	’ ‘
182106	182110	182126	182126	I	0	’ thought Mark . ‘
182129	182170	182171	182171	You	222	’ Mr Scadder said nothing , but he set his back against the plan , and thrust his toothpick into the desk some twenty times ; looking at Mark all the while as if he were stabbing him in effigy . ‘
182180	182195	182171	182171	You	222	’ Martin ventured to observe at length , in a tone of mild propitiation . ‘
182209	182215	182271	182271	Martin	221	’ said the agent sulkily . ‘
182249	182261	182271	182271	Martin	221	’ rowdy ; p’raps a ring - tailed roarer . Now ! ’
182262	182269	182278	182279	the agent	4187	‘ All your doing , Mark ! ’
182273	182276	182278	182279	the agent	4187	‘ P’raps , ’
182281	182342	182271	182271	Martin	221	‘ them ai n’t plants of Eden ’s raising . No ! P’raps that desk and stool ai n’t made from Eden lumber . No ! P’raps no end of squatters ai n’t gone out there . No ! P’raps there ai n’t no such location in the territoary of the Great U - nited States . Oh , no ! ’
182343	182347	182356	182356	Mark	222	‘ I hope you ’re
182358	182421	182422	182422	You	222	’ said Martin . But here , at a most opportune and happy time , the General interposed , and called out to Scadder from the doorway to give his friends the particulars of that little lot of fifty acres with the house upon it ; which , having belonged to the company formerly , had lately lapsed again into their hands . ‘
182433	182438	182422	182422	You	222	’ was the answer . ‘
182453	182497	182422	182422	You	222	’ He grumblingly opened his books notwithstanding , and always keeping his bright side towards Mark , no matter at what amount of inconvenience to himself , displayed a certain leaf for their perusal . Martin read it greedily , and then inquired : ‘
182508	182509	182422	182422	You	222	’ ‘
182514	182518	182422	182422	You	222	’ said Scadder . ‘
182521	182610	182431	182431	Gen’ral	454	’ He turned towards it , and reflected for a short time , as if , having been put upon his mettle , he was resolved to be particular to the very minutest hair ’s breadth of a shade . At length , after wheeling his toothpick slowly round and round in the air , as if it were a carrier pigeon just thrown up , he suddenly made a dart at the drawing , and pierced the very centre of the main wharf , through and through . ‘
182613	182625	182431	182431	Gen’ral	454	’ he said , leaving his knife quivering in the wall ; ‘
182632	182813	182431	182431	Gen’ral	454	’ Martin glanced with sparkling eyes upon his Co. , and his Co. saw that the thing was done . The bargain was not concluded as easily as might have been expected though , for Scadder was caustic and ill - humoured , and cast much unnecessary opposition in the way ; at one time requesting them to think of it , and call again in a week or a fortnight ; at another , predicting that they would n’t like it ; at another , offering to retract and let them off , and muttering strong imprecations upon the folly of the General . But the whole of the astoundingly small sum total of purchase - money -- it was only one hundred and fifty dollars , or something more than thirty pounds of the capital brought by Co. into the architectural concern -- was ultimately paid down ; and Martin ’s head was two inches nearer the roof of the little wooden office , with the consciousness of being a landed proprietor in the thriving city of Eden . ‘
182822	182839	182843	182843	me	0	’ said Scadder , as he gave Martin the necessary credentials on recepit of his money , ‘
182845	182846	182843	182843	me	0	’ ‘
182851	182856	182863	182863	General	3618	’ he replied merrily . ‘
182869	182870	182880	182880	I	0	’ ‘
182884	182897	183272	183272	sir	864	’ said the General , giving him his hand with grave cordiality , ‘
182966	183269	183272	183272	sir	864	’ Martin thanked him , and took leave of Mr Scadder ; who had resumed his post in the rocking - chair , immediately on the General ’s rising from it , and was once more swinging away as if he had never been disturbed . Mark looked back several times as they went down the road towards the National Hotel , but now his blighted profile was towards them , and nothing but attentive thoughtfulness was written on it . Strangely different to the other side ! He was not a man much given to laughing , and never laughed outright ; but every line in the print of the crow ’s foot , and every little wiry vein in that division of his head , was wrinkled up into a grin ! The compound figure of Death and the Lady at the top of the old ballad was not divided with a greater nicety , and had n’t halves more monstrously unlike each other , than the two profiles of Zephaniah Scadder . The General posted along at a great rate , for the clock was on the stroke of twelve ; and at that hour precisely , the Great Meeting of the Watertoast Sympathisers was to be holden in the public room of the National Hotel . Being very curious to witness the demonstration , and know what it was all about , Martin kept close to the General ; and , keeping closer than ever when they entered the Hall , got by that means upon a little platform of tables at the upper end ; where an armchair was set for the General , and Mr La Fayette Kettle , as secretary , was making a great display of some foolscap documents . Screamers , no doubt . ‘
183274	183285	183462	183462	Lion	457	’ he said , as he shook hands with Martin , ‘
183311	183461	183488	183488	me	0	’ Martin certainly thought it possible that the British Lion might have been rather out of his element in that Ark ; but he kept the idea to himself . The General was then voted to the chair , on the motion of a pallid lad of the Jefferson Brick school ; who forthwith set in for a high - spiced speech , with a good deal about hearths and homes in it , and unriveting the chains of Tyranny . Oh but it was a clincher for the British Lion , it was ! The indignation of the glowing young Columbian knew no bounds . If he could only have been one of his own forefathers , he said , would n’t he have peppered that same Lion , and been to him as another Brute Tamer with a wire whip , teaching him lessons not easily forgotten . ‘
183495	183506	183488	183488	me	0	’ said the young Columbian , in a wrestling attitude , ‘
183514	183526	183573	183574	that Lion	4353	’ cried the young Columbian , idealising the dining - table , ‘
183553	183559	183586	183586	he	4353	’ said the young Columbian . ‘
183605	183669	183692	183692	Martin	221	’ When it was found that the Lion did n’t come , but kept out of the way ; that the young Columbian stood there , with folded arms , alone in his glory ; and consequently that the Eagles were no doubt laughing wildly on the mountain tops ; such cheers arose as might have shaken the hands upon the Horse - Guards ’
183686	183691	183698	183699	The Secretary	4356	‘ Who is this ? ’
183736	183748	184009	184010	the General	9448	‘ Perhaps as remarkable a man as any in our country . ’
184004	184007	184009	184010	the General	9448	‘ Thus , ’
184012	184025	184058	184058	its	4369	‘ thus , my friends and fellow - citizens , it runs : ‘
184096	184128	184277	184283	all , exterminated by its destroying hand	4386	’ At the name of Freedom , and at every repetition of that name , all the Sympathisers roared aloud ; cheering with nine times nine , and nine times over . ‘

184433	184614	184615	184616	My friends	9043	’ It happened that just as the General began to read this letter , the railroad train arrived , bringing a new mail from England ; and a packet had been handed in to the Secretary , which during its perusal and the frequent cheerings in homage to freedom , he had opened . Now , its contents disturbed him very much , and the moment the General sat down , he hurried to his side , and placed in his hand a letter and several printed extracts from English newspapers ; to which , in a state of infinite excitement , he called his immediate attention . The General , being greatly heated by his own composition , was in a fit state to receive any inflammable influence ; but he had no sooner possessed himself of the contents of these documents , than a change came over his face , involving such a huge amount of choler and passion , that the noisy concourse were silent in a moment , in very wonder at the sight of him . ‘
184618	184625	184632	184632	we	4400	’ cried the General , rising ; ‘
184640	184641	184632	184632	we	4400	’ ‘
184646	184651	184677	184677	he	10880	’ was the cry . ‘
184655	184673	184813	184813	I	0	’ panted the General , holding up the letter he had read aloud a few minutes before . ‘
184697	184812	184813	184813	I	0	’ If anything beneath the sky be real , those Sons of Freedom would have pistolled , stabbed -- in some way slain -- that man by coward hands and murderous violence , if he had stood among them at that time . The most confiding of their own countrymen would not have wagered then -- no , nor would they ever peril -- one dunghill straw , upon the life of any man in such a strait . They tore the letter , cast the fragments in the air , trod down the pieces as they fell ; and yelled , and groaned , and hissed , till they could cry no longer . ‘
184817	184829	184831	184836	the Watertoast Association of United Sympathisers	4369	’ said the General , when he could make himself heard , ‘
184841	184872	184831	184836	the Watertoast Association of United Sympathisers	4369	’ Down with it ! Away with it ! Do n’t hear of it ! Burn its records ! Pull the room down ! Blot it out of human memory ! ‘
184880	184885	184831	184836	the Watertoast Association of United Sympathisers	4369	’ said the General , ‘
184902	185105	185113	185113	You	4407	’ It was hastily resolved that a piece of plate should be presented to a certain constitutional Judge , who had laid down from the Bench the noble principle that it was lawful for any white mob to murder any black man ; and that another piece of plate , of similar value should be presented to a certain Patriot , who had declared from his high place in the Legislature , that he and his friends would hang without trial , any Abolitionist who might pay them a visit . For the surplus , it was agreed that it should be devoted to aiding the enforcement of those free and equal laws , which render it incalculably more criminal and dangerous to teach a negro to read and write than to roast him alive in a public city . These points adjusted , the meeting broke up in great disorder , and there was an end of the Watertoast Sympathy . As Martin ascended to his bedroom , his eye was attracted by the Republican banner , which had been hoisted from the house - top in honour of the occasion , and was fluttering before a window which he passed . ‘
185108	185112	185113	185113	You	4407	’ said Martin . ‘

He had scarcely got through this correspondence when Captain Kedgick , the landlord , kindly came upstairs to see how he was getting on . The Captain sat down upon the bed before he spoke ; and finding it rather hard , moved to the pillow . ‘
185983	186007	186093	186093	I	0	’ said the Captain , putting his hat a little more on one side , for it was rather tight in the crown : ‘

186136	186142	186150	186150	You	864	’ said the Captain coolly ; ‘

186216	186275	186282	186282	I	0	’ rejoined the Captain . Martin looked despairingly at Mark , who informed him that the Captain meant a written notice that Mr Chuzzlewit would receive the Watertoasters that day , at and after two o’clock which was in effect then hanging in the bar , as Mark , from ocular inspection of the same , could testify . ‘
186285	186294	186308	186309	our Gazette	4442	’ said the Captain , paring his nails . ‘
186318	186337	186343	186343	them	4443	’ Martin was going to be very wroth , but he thought better of it , and said : ‘
186348	186349	186352	186352	THEY’ll	4443	’ ‘
186355	186360	186371	186371	my	0	’ returned the Captain . ‘

186380	186393	186419	186419	they	4443	’ said Martin , seeing that the Captain was about to go ; ‘
186430	186501	186419	186419	they	4443	’ Captain Kedgick put a thumb and three fingers to each side of the brim of his hat ; lifted it a little way off his head ; put it on again carefully ; passed one hand all down his face , beginning at the forehead and ending at the chin ; looked at Martin ; then at Mark ; then at Martin again ; winked , and walked out . ‘
186508	186520	186537	186537	you	0	’ said Martin , bringing his hand heavily upon the table ; ‘
186542	186543	186546	186546	sir	864	’ ‘
186548	186553	186574	186574	I	0	’ returned his partner , ‘
186586	186647	186574	186574	I	0	’ Although this made Martin laugh , it could n’t keep off two o’clock . Punctually , as the hour struck , Captain Kedgick returned to hand him to the room of state ; and he had no sooner got him safe there , than he bawled down the staircase to his fellow - citizens below , that Mr Chuzzlewit was ‘
186650	186863	187158	187158	you	4467	’ Up they came with a rush . Up they came until the room was full , and , through the open door , a dismal perspective of more to come , was shown upon the stairs . One after another , one after another , dozen after dozen , score after score , more , more , more , up they came ; all shaking hands with Martin . Such varieties of hands , the thick , the thin , the short , the long , the fat , the lean , the coarse , the fine ; such differences of temperature , the hot , the cold , the dry , the moist , the flabby ; such diversities of grasp , the tight , the loose , the short - lived , and the lingering ! Still up , up , up , more , more , more ; and ever and anon the Captain ’s voice was heard above the crowd--‘There ’s more below ! there ’s more below . Now , gentlemen you that have been introduced to Mr Chuzzlewit , will you clear gentlemen ? Will you clear ? Will you be so good as clear , gentlemen , and make a little room for more ? ’
187161	187668	187669	187670	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ Even when they began to clear it was no better ; for then a stream of gentlemen , every one with a lady on each arm ( exactly like the chorus to the National Anthem when Royalty goes in state to the play ) , came gliding in -- every new group fresher than the last , and bent on staying to the latest moment . If they spoke to him , which was not often , they invariably asked the same questions , in the same tone ; with no more remorse , or delicacy , or consideration , than if he had been a figure of stone , purchased , and paid for , and set up there for their delight . Even when , in the slow course of time , these died off , it was as bad as ever , if not worse ; for then the boys grew bold , and came in as a class of themselves , and did everything that the grown - up people had done . Uncouth stragglers , too , appeared ; men of a ghostly kind , who being in , did n’t know how to get out again ; insomuch that one silent gentleman with glazed and fishy eyes and only one button on his waistcoat ( which was a very large metal one , and shone prodigiously ) , got behind the door , and stood there , like a clock , long after everybody else was gone . Martin felt , from pure fatigue , and heat , and worry , as if he could have fallen on the ground and willingly remained there , if they would but have had the mercy to leave him alone . But as letters and messages , threatening his public denouncement if he did n’t see the senders , poured in like hail ; and as more visitors came while he took his coffee by himself ; and as Mark , with all his vigilance , was unable to keep them from the door ; he resolved to go to bed -- not that he felt at all sure of bed being any protection , but that he might not leave a forlorn hope untried . He had communicated this design to Mark , and was on the eve of escaping , when the door was thrown open in a great hurry , and an elderly gentleman entered ; bringing with him a lady who certainly could not be considered young -- that was matter of fact ; and probably could not be considered handsome -- but that was matter of opinion . She was very straight , very tall , and not at all flexible in face or figure . On her head she wore a great straw bonnet , with trimmings of the same , in which she looked as if she had been thatched by an unskillful labourer ; and in her hand she held a most enormous fan . ‘
187675	187680	187688	187688	Sir	864	’ said the gentleman . ‘
187686	187687	187688	187688	Sir	864	’ ‘

187707	187711	187719	187719	sir	864	’ thought Martin . ‘
187721	187726	187747	187747	sir	864	’ pursued the gentleman , ‘
187749	187750	187747	187747	sir	864	’ ‘
187757	187761	187762	187762	You	864	’ said Martin . ‘
187768	187777	187795	187795	Sir	864	’ returned the gentleman , with great decision : ‘
187800	187804	187843	187844	Mrs Hominy	472	’ Martin bowed . ‘
187848	187856	187867	187867	sir	864	’ Martin could n’t say he was . ‘
187869	187874	187940	187940	I	0	’ said the gentleman . ‘
187958	187978	187986	187986	I	0	’ Martin could scarcely believe it ; but he had gone , and Mrs Hominy was drinking the milk . ‘
187990	187994	188022	188022	ma’am	9146	’ she observed . ‘
188016	188017	188022	188022	ma’am	9146	’ ‘

188045	188050	188114	188114	Mark	222	’ said Mrs Hominy . ‘
188059	188113	188125	188125	you	222	’ It did not appear that these expressions , although they seemed to conclude with an urgent entreaty , stood in need of any answer ; for Mrs Hominy , untying her bonnet - strings , observed that she would withdraw to lay that article of dress aside , and would return immediately . ‘
188116	188120	188133	188133	Hominy	472	’ said Martin . ‘
188131	188132	188136	188136	sir	864	’ ‘
188138	188183	188322	188323	Mrs Hominy	472	’ returned his partner--‘Broad awake ! Just the sort of woman , sir , as would be discovered with her eyes wide open , and her mind a - working for her country ’s good , at any hour of the day or night . ’
188315	188320	188322	188323	Mrs Hominy	472	‘ Pray , sir ! ’
188325	188332	188345	188345	Martin	221	‘ where do you hail from ? ’
188333	188343	188363	188364	Mrs Hominy	472	‘ I am afraid I am dull of comprehension , ’
188347	188362	188366	188366	her	472	‘ being extremely tired ; but upon my word I do n’t understand you . ’
188378	188389	188366	188366	her	472	‘ They corrupt even the language in that old country ! ’
188407	188413	188419	188419	Martin	221	‘ Where was you rose ? ’
188414	188417	188366	188366	her	472	‘ Oh ! ’
188420	188427	188441	188442	Mrs Hominy	472	‘ I was born in Kent . ’
188428	188439	188451	188451	Martin	221	‘ And how do you like our country , sir ? ’
188444	188449	188451	188451	Martin	221	‘ Very much indeed , ’
188456	188468	188493	188494	Mrs Hominy	472	‘ At least -- that is -- pretty well , ma’am . ’
188469	188491	188509	188509	Martin	221	‘ Most strangers -- and partick’larly Britishers -- are much surprised by what they see in the U - nited States , ’
188496	188507	188509	188509	Martin	221	‘ They have excellent reason to be so , ma’am , ’
188511	188523	188536	188537	Mrs Hominy	472	‘ I never was so much surprised in all my life . ’
188524	188535	188561	188561	Martin	221	‘ Our institutions make our people smart much , sir , ’
188540	188559	188663	188664	Mrs Hominy	472	‘ The most short - sighted man could see that at a glance , with his naked eye , ’
188673	188679	188692	188695	the married Miss Hominy	478	‘ My ever dearest blank , ’
188682	188689	188930	188930	their	11560	‘ The Mother of the Modern Gracchi ’
188933	188941	188930	188930	their	11560	‘ We are no worse than you ! ’
188951	189906	188930	188930	their	11560	‘ vantage - ground enough for that Republic , but yesterday let loose upon her noble course , and but to - day so maimed and lame , so full of sores and ulcers , foul to the eye and almost hopeless to the sense , that her best friends turn from the loathsome creature with disgust . Who , having by their ancestors declared and won their Independence , because they would not bend the knee to certain Public vices and corruptions , and would not abrogate the truth , run riot in the Bad , and turn their backs upon the Good ; and lying down contented with the wretched boast that other Temples also are of glass , and stones which batter theirs may be flung back ; show themselves , in that alone , as immeasurably behind the import of the trust they hold , and as unworthy to possess it as if the sordid hucksterings of all their little governments -- each one a kingdom in its small depravity -- were brought into a heap for evidence against them . Martin by degrees became so far awake , that he had a sense of a terrible oppression on his mind ; an imperfect dream that he had murdered a particular friend , and could n’t get rid of the body . When his eyes opened it was staring him full in the face . There was the horrible Hominy talking deep truths in a melodious snuffle , and pouring forth her mental endowments to such an extent that the Major ’s bitterest enemy , hearing her , would have forgiven him from the bottom of his heart . Martin might have done something desperate if the gong had not sounded for supper ; but sound it did most opportunely ; and having stationed Mrs Hominy at the upper end of the table he took refuge at the lower end himself ; whence , after a hasty meal he stole away , while the lady was yet busied with dried beef and a saucer - full of pickled fixings . It would be difficult to give an adequate idea of Mrs Hominy ’s freshness next day , or of the avidity with which she went headlong into moral philosophy at breakfast . Some little additional degree of asperity , perhaps , was visible in her features , but not more than the pickles would have naturally produced . All that day she clung to Martin . She sat beside him while he received his friends ( for there was another Reception , yet more numerous than the former ) , propounded theories , and answered imaginary objections , so that Martin really began to think he must be dreaming , and speaking for two ; she quoted interminable passages from certain essays on government , written by herself ; used the Major ’s pocket - handkerchief as if the snuffle were a temporary malady , of which she was determined to rid herself by some means or other ; and , in short , was such a remarkable companion , that Martin quite settled it between himself and his conscience , that in any new settlement it would be absolutely necessary to have such a person knocked on the head for the general peace of society . In the meantime Mark was busy , from early in the morning until late at night , in getting on board the steamboat such provisions , tools and other necessaries , as they had been forewarned it would be wise to take . The purchase of these things , and the settlement of their bill at the National , reduced their finances to so low an ebb , that if the captain had delayed his departure any longer , they would have been in almost as bad a plight as the unfortunate poorer emigrants , who ( seduced on board by solemn advertisement ) had been living on the lower deck a whole week , and exhausting their miserable stock of provisions before the voyage commenced . There they were , all huddled together with the engine and the fires . Farmers who had never seen a plough ; woodmen who had never used an axe ; builders who could n’t make a box ; cast out of their own land , with not a hand to aid them : newly come into an unknown world , children in helplessness , but men in wants -- with younger children at their backs , to live or die as it might happen ! The morning came , and they would start at noon . Noon came , and they would start at night . But nothing is eternal in this world ; not even the procrastination of an American skipper ; and at night all was ready . Dispirited and weary to the last degree , but a greater lion than ever ( he had done nothing all the afternoon but answer letters from strangers ; half of them about nothing ; half about borrowing money , and all requiring an instantaneous reply ) , Martin walked down to the wharf , through a concourse of people , with Mrs Hominy upon his arm ; and went on board . But Mark was bent on solving the riddle of this lionship , if he could ; and so , not without the risk of being left behind , ran back to the hotel . Captain Kedgick was sitting in the colonnade , with a julep on his knee , and a cigar in his mouth . He caught Mark ’s eye , and said : ‘
189911	189917	189932	189932	Mark	222	‘ Tarnal brings you here ? ’
189918	189930	189932	189932	Mark	222	‘ I ’ll tell you plainly what it is , Captain , ’
189934	189943	189958	189958	Kedgick	471	‘ I want to ask you a question . ’
189944	189956	189992	189992	Mark	222	‘ A man may ASK a question , so he may , ’
189976	189990	189992	189992	Mark	222	‘ What have they been making so much of him for , now ? ’

190025	190049	190050	190050	You	222	’ asked Mark . The Captain looked at him as if he were half inclined to unburden his mind of a capital joke . ‘
190056	190060	190050	190050	You	222	’ he said . ‘
190063	190067	190050	190050	You	222	’ cried Mark . ‘
190074	190075	190091	190091	He	4520	’ ‘
190083	190090	190109	190109	he	4520	’ said the Captain , whispering . ‘
190102	190108	190109	190109	he	4520	‘ em along of this ; ’
190118	190143	190224	190224	Martin	221	‘ along of this . Scadder is a smart man , and -- and -- nobody as goes to Eden ever comes back alive ! ’
190217	190222	190235	190235	Mark	222	‘ Mark ! Mark ! ’
190226	190233	190235	190235	Mark	222	‘ Here am I , sir ! ’
190254	190272	190419	190419	he	4529	‘ Never was half so jolly , sir . All right . Haul in ! Go ahead ! ’
190407	190418	190419	190419	he	4529	‘ If this were a republic of Intellect and Worth , ’
190422	190441	190454	190455	Mr Tapley	309	‘ instead of vapouring and jobbing , they would not want the levers to keep it in motion . ’
190442	190452	190478	190478	Martin	221	‘ Having good tools , and using bad ones , ’
190457	190477	190478	190478	Martin	221	‘ would look as if they was rather a poor sort of carpenters , sir , would n’t it ? ’
190481	190503	190513	190513	Mark	222	‘ As if their work were infinitely above their powers and purpose , Mark ; and they botched it in consequence . ’
190504	190511	190478	190478	Martin	221	‘ The best on it is , ’
190515	190584	190656	190656	I	0	‘ that when they do happen to make a decent stroke ; such as better workmen , with no such opportunities , make every day of their lives and think nothing of -- they begin to sing out so surprising loud . Take notice of my words , sir . If ever the defaulting part of this here country pays its debts -- along of finding that not paying ‘
190658	190669	190681	190681	Martin	221	‘ em . Take notice of my words , now ! ’
190670	190679	190692	190692	Mark	222	‘ You seem to be growing profoundly sagacious ! ’
190685	190690	190692	190692	Mark	222	‘ Whether that is , ’
190694	190697	190730	190731	a prophet	4536	‘ because I ’m
190733	191204	191222	191222	ma’am	9146	’ He gave no utterance to these sentiments ; but the excessive joviality they inspired within him , and the merriment they brought upon his shining face , were quite enough for Martin . Although he might sometimes profess to make light of his partner ’s inexhaustible cheerfulness , and might sometimes , as in the case of Zephaniah Scadder , find him too jocose a commentator , he was always sensible of the effect of his example in rousing him to hopefulness and courage . Whether he were in the humour to profit by it , mattered not a jot . It was contagious , and he could not choose but be affected . At first they parted with some of their passengers once or twice a day , and took in others to replace them . But by degrees , the towns upon their route became more thinly scattered ; and for many hours together they would see no other habitations than the huts of the wood - cutters , where the vessel stopped for fuel . Sky , wood , and water all the livelong day ; and heat that blistered everything it touched . On they toiled through great solitudes , where the trees upon the banks grew thick and close ; and floated in the stream ; and held up shrivelled arms from out the river ’s depths ; and slid down from the margin of the land , half growing , half decaying , in the miry water . On through the weary day and melancholy night ; beneath the burning sun , and in the mist and vapour of the evening ; on , until return appeared impossible , and restoration to their home a miserable dream . They had now but few people on board , and these few were as flat , as dull , and stagnant , as the vegetation that oppressed their eyes . No sound of cheerfulness or hope was heard ; no pleasant talk beguiled the tardy time ; no little group made common cause against the full depression of the scene . But that , at certain periods , they swallowed food together from a common trough , it might have been old Charon ’s boat , conveying melancholy shades to judgment . At length they drew near New Thermopylae ; where , that same evening , Mrs Hominy would disembark . A gleam of comfort sunk into Martin ’s bosom when she told him this . Mark needed none ; but he was not displeased . It was almost night when they came alongside the landing - place . A steep bank with an hotel like a barn on the top of it ; a wooden store or two ; and a few scattered sheds . ‘
191224	191228	191231	191231	I	0	’ said Martin . ‘
191236	191245	191252	191252	My	0	’ cried the mother of the modern Gracchi . ‘
191250	191251	191252	191252	My	0	’ ‘
191259	191288	191252	191252	My	0	’ said Mrs Hominy . Martin looked for it all round the darkening panorama ; but he could n’t see it , and was obliged to say so . ‘
191294	191306	191252	191252	My	0	’ cried Mrs Hominy , pointing to the sheds just mentioned . ‘
191309	191313	191527	191527	Mark	222	’ exclaimed Martin . ‘
191330	191526	191527	191527	Mark	222	’ said Mrs Hominy , nodding her head with great expression . The married Miss Hominy , who had come on board with her husband , gave to this statement her most unqualified support , as did that gentleman also . Martin gratefully declined their invitation to regale himself at their house during the half hour of the vessel ’s stay ; and having escorted Mrs Hominy and the red pocket - handkerchief ( which was still on active service ) safely across the gangway , returned in a thoughtful mood to watch the emigrants as they removed their goods ashore . Mark , as he stood beside him , glanced in his face from time to time ; anxious to discover what effect this dialogue had had upon him , and not unwilling that his hopes should be dashed before they reached their destination , so that the blow he feared might be broken in its fall . But saving that he sometimes looked up quickly at the poor erections on the hill , he gave him no clue to what was passing in his mind , until they were again upon their way . ‘
191529	191534	191557	191557	sir	864	’ he said then , ‘
191551	191552	191559	191562	Most of ‘ em	12611	’ ‘
191561	191595	191605	191605	Martin	221	‘ em , as you know , have stopped short ; and the few that are left are going further on . What matters that ! More room there for us , sir . ’
191596	191603	191615	191615	he	221	‘ Oh , to be sure ! ’
191607	191612	191625	191625	Mark	222	‘ But I was thinking-- ’
191618	191623	191679	191679	He	221	‘ Yes , sir ? ’
191627	191678	191724	191724	Mark	222	‘ How odd it was that the people should have arranged to try their fortune at a wretched hole like that , for instance , when there is such a much better , and such a very different kind of place , near at hand , as one may say . ’
191714	191722	191729	191729	he	222	‘ Why , you know , sir , ’
191738	191758	191777	191777	we	4543	‘ we must guard against being too sanguine . There ’s no occasion for it , either , because we ’re
191781	191793	191816	191816	man	936	’ Martin looked at him , but answered not a word . ‘
191805	191809	191816	191816	man	936	’ said Mark . ‘
191818	191823	191845	191845	me!--don’t	4547	’ cried Martin angrily , ‘
191854	191883	191845	191845	me!--don’t	4547	’ After that , he turned away , and walked to and fro upon the deck full two hours . Nor did he speak again , except to say ‘
191887	192201	192212	192212	He	4548	’ until next day ; nor even then upon this subject , but on other topics quite foreign to the purpose . As they proceeded further on their track , and came more and more towards their journey ’s end , the monotonous desolation of the scene increased to that degree , that for any redeeming feature it presented to their eyes , they might have entered , in the body , on the grim domains of Giant Despair . A flat morass , bestrewn with fallen timber ; a marsh on which the good growth of the earth seemed to have been wrecked and cast away , that from its decomposing ashes vile and ugly things might rise ; where the very trees took the aspect of huge weeds , begotten of the slime from which they sprung , by the hot sun that burnt them up ; where fatal maladies , seeking whom they might infect , came forth at night in misty shapes , and creeping out upon the water , hunted them like spectres until day ; where even the blessed sun , shining down on festering elements of corruption and disease , became a horror ; this was the realm of Hope through which they moved . At last they stopped . At Eden too . The waters of the Deluge might have left it but a week before ; so choked with slime and matted growth was the hideous swamp which bore that name . There being no depth of water close in shore , they landed from the vessel ’s boat , with all their goods beside them . There were a few log - houses visible among the dark trees ; the best , a cow - shed or a rude stable ; but for the wharves , the market - place , the public buildings-- ‘
192207	192211	192343	192343	Strangers	1079	’ said Mark . ‘
192233	192342	192343	192343	Strangers	1079	’ The man advanced toward them through the thickening gloom , very slowly ; leaning on a stick . As he drew nearer , they observed that he was pale and worn , and that his anxious eyes were deeply sunken in his head . His dress of homespun blue hung about him in rags ; his feet and head were bare . He sat down on a stump half - way , and beckoned them to come to him . When they complied , he put his hand upon his side as if in pain , and while he fetched his breath stared at them , wondering . ‘
192345	192356	192343	192343	Strangers	1079	’ he exclaimed , as soon as he could speak . ‘
192361	192365	192370	192370	sir	864	’ said Mark . ‘
192372	192373	192374	192374	I	0	’ ‘
192382	192387	192413	192413	sir	864	’ he answered faintly . ‘
192404	192410	192413	192413	sir	864	’ pointing to their property . ‘
192415	192419	192423	192423	You	864	’ said Mark , ‘
192438	192453	192467	192468	the man	1838	‘ em up to the -- to the town , could you , sir ? ’
192454	192465	192467	192468	the man	1838	‘ My eldest son would do it if he could , ’
192470	192495	192503	192503	governor	4557	‘ but today he has his chill upon him , and is lying wrapped up in the blankets . My youngest died last week . ’
192496	192498	192503	192503	governor	4557	‘ I ’m
192510	192520	192573	192574	the man	1838	’ said Mark , shaking him by the hand . ‘
192558	192567	192573	192574	the man	1838	‘ em . What a comfort that is ! ’
192568	192571	192573	192574	the man	1838	‘ No , ’
192576	192585	192573	192574	the man	1838	‘ You must look for such folk here , ’
192593	192609	192618	192618	Them	4560	‘ or yonder in the bush , towards the north . We ’ve buried most of ‘
192631	192632	192618	192618	Them	4560	’ ‘
192644	192648	192618	192618	Them	4560	’ said Mark . ‘
192654	192903	192618	192618	Them	4560	’ was the settler ’s answer . Mark showed no more uneasiness than if it had been commended to him as ambrosia ; but he gave the man his arm , and as they went along explained to him the nature of their purchase , and inquired where it lay . Close to his own log - house , he said ; so close that he had used their dwelling as a store - house for some corn ; they must excuse it that night , but he would endeavour to get it taken out upon the morrow . He then gave them to understand , as an additional scrap of local chit - chat , that he had buried the last proprietor with his own hands ; a piece of information which Mark also received without the least abatement of his equanimity . In a word , he conducted them to a miserable cabin , rudely constructed of the trunks of trees ; the door of which had either fallen down or been carried away long ago ; and which was consequently open to the wild landscape and the dark night . Saving for the little store he had mentioned , it was perfectly bare of all furniture ; but they had left a chest upon the landing - place , and he gave them a rude torch in lieu of candle . This latter acquisition Mark planted in the earth , and then declaring that the mansion ‘
192908	193027	193028	193028	Lord	4562	’ hurried Martin off again to help bring up the chest . And all the way to the landing - place and back , Mark talked incessantly ; as if he would infuse into his partner ’s breast some faint belief that they had arrived under the most auspicious and cheerful of all imaginable circumstances . But many a man who would have stood within a home dismantled , strong in his passion and design of vengeance , has had the firmness of his nature conquered by the razing of an air - built castle . When the log - hut received them for the second time , Martin laid down upon the ground , and wept aloud . ‘
193034	193043	193114	193114	I	0	’ cried Mr Tapley , in great terror ; ‘
193128	193174	193175	193175	I	0	’ There is no doubt he spoke the truth , for the extraordinary alarm with which he looked at Martin as he paused upon his knees before the chest , in the act of unlocking it , to say these words , sufficiently confirmed him . ‘
193187	193191	193192	193192	I	0	’ said Martin . ‘
193206	193207	193192	193192	I	0	’ ‘
193212	193229	193385	193385	Mark	222	’ said Mark , with his accustomed cheerfulness , as he proceeded to unpack the chest . ‘
193312	193383	193385	193385	Mark	222	’ in itself ! Here ’s the blankets . Here ’s the axe . Who says we ai n’t got a first - rate fit out ? I feel as if I was a cadet gone out to Indy , and my noble father was chairman of the Board of Directors . Now , when I ’ve got some water from the stream afore the door and mixed the grog , ’
193397	193445	193491	193491	Mark	222	‘ there ’s a supper ready , comprising every delicacy of the season . Here we are , sir , all complete . For what we are going to receive , et cetrer . Lord bless you , sir , it ’s very like a gipsy party ! ’
193484	193489	193491	193491	Mark	222	‘ Now you see , ’
193501	193582	194641	194641	Mark	222	‘ with your knife and mine , I sticks this blanket right afore the door . Or where , in a state of high civilization , the door would be . And very neat it looks . Then I stops the aperture below , by putting the chest agin it . And very neat THAT looks . Then there ’s your blanket , sir . Then here ’s mine . And what ’s to hinder our passing a good night ? ’
194634	194639	194641	194641	Mark	222	‘ These here tools , ’
194662	194698	194641	194641	Mark	222	‘ shall be set out in the open air to show that we come provided . And now , if any gentleman wants a house built , he ’d better give his orders , afore we ’re
194703	194759	194641	194641	Mark	222	’ Considering the intense heat of the weather , this was not a bad morning ’s work ; but without pausing for a moment , though he was streaming at every pore , Mark vanished into the house again , and presently reappeared with a hatchet ; intent on performing some impossibilities with that implement . ‘
194771	194775	194912	194912	sir	864	’ he observed , ‘
194811	194906	194912	194912	sir	864	’ But Martin gave him no answer . He had sat the whole time with his head upon his hands , gazing at the current as it rolled swiftly by ; thinking , perhaps , how fast it moved towards the open sea , the high road to the home he never would behold again . Not even the vigorous strokes which Mark dealt at the tree awoke him from his mournful meditation . Finding all his endeavours to rouse him of no use , Mark stopped in his work and came towards him . ‘
194914	194919	194922	194922	Mark	222	’ said Mr Tapley . ‘
194924	194929	194932	194932	I	0	’ returned his friend , ‘
194945	194946	194949	194949	sir	864	’ ‘
194951	194955	194962	194965	everybody as is here	4618	’ returned Mark , ‘
194974	195018	195024	195024	Martin	221	‘ em with better reason p’raps than you or me . Hold up , sir . Do something . Could n’t you ease your mind , now , do n’t you think , by making some personal obserwations in a letter to Scadder ? ’
195019	195022	195027	195027	his	221	‘ No , ’
195031	195037	194962	194965	everybody as is here	4618	‘ I am past that . ’
195038	195042	195027	195027	his	221	‘ But if you ’re
195047	195051	195027	195027	his	221	’ returned Mark , ‘

195071	195075	195144	195144	I	0	’ said Martin . ‘

195151	195157	195144	195144	I	0	’ returned Mark , tenderly , ‘
195161	195186	195213	195213	you	864	’m sure of it . A touch of fever and ague caught on these rivers , I dare say ; but bless you , THAT ’S
195216	195228	195213	195213	you	864	’ said Mark . He only sighed and shook his head . ‘
195234	195239	195309	195309	he	0	’ said Mark cheerily , ‘
195296	195303	195341	195341	Mark	222	’m away , whatever you do ! ’
195333	195339	195341	195341	Mark	222	‘ Now , Mr Tapley , ’
195356	195422	195449	195450	Mr Jonas	415	‘ just you attend to what I ’ve got to say . Things is looking about as bad as they CAN look , young man . You ’ll not have such another opportunity for showing your jolly disposition , my fine fellow , as long as you live . And therefore , Tapley , Now ’s your time to come out strong ; or Never ! ’
195442	195447	195449	195450	Mr Jonas	415	‘ Hallo , Pecksniff ! ’
195455	195471	195515	195515	he	415	‘ Is n’t somebody a - going to open that precious old door of yours ? ’

195676	195695	195788	195788	he	415	‘ This may be a professional call . Indeed I am pretty sure it is . Thank you . ’
195791	195916	195949	195950	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Mr Chuzzlewit ! Can I believe my eyes ! My dear sir ; my good sir ! A joyful hour , a happy hour indeed . Pray , my dear sir , walk in . You find me in my garden - dress . You will excuse it , I know . It is an ancient pursuit , gardening . Primitive , my dear sir . Or , if I am not mistaken , Adam was the first of our calling . MY Eve , I grieve to say is no more , sir ; but’--here he pointed to his spade , and shook his head as if he were not cheerful without an effort--‘but I do a little bit of Adam still . ’

If I could feel weary upon such a theme , I should have been worn out long ago , my dear sir , by their constant anticipation of this happiness and their repeated allusions to our meeting at Mrs Todgers ’s .

An extremely engaging expression of countenance , Mr Chuzzlewit , my dear sir -- very much so ! ’

196137	196140	196142	196142	Mary	253	‘ Pinch , ’
196144	196155	196169	196169	Pecksniff	415	‘ Mr Pinch would have arrived before us , Pecksniff . ’
196156	196167	196172	196172	his	415	‘ He did arrive before you , my dear sir , ’
196183	196209	196243	196243	I	0	‘ and was about , I dare say , to tell me of your coming , when I begged him first to knock at my daughters ’
196233	196242	196268	196269	Mr Pinch	221	’ said Mr Pecksniff , answering their looks , ‘
196273	196282	196308	196309	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ exclaimed Pecksniff , in his kindest accents . ‘

196322	196326	196348	196349	Old Thomas	249	’ said Tom . ‘
196346	196347	196348	196349	Old Thomas	249	’ ‘
196351	196357	196360	196360	you	249	’ cried his master , pleasantly ‘
196362	196441	196442	196442	Pecksniff	415	’ Tom reported that the young ladies would appear directly , and that the best refreshments which the house afforded were even then in preparation , under their joint superintendence . While he was speaking , the old man looked at him intently , though with less harshness than was common to him ; nor did the mutual embarrassment of Tom and the young lady , to whatever cause he attributed it , seem to escape his observation . ‘
196444	196460	196583	196583	you	1281	’ he said after a pause , rising and taking him aside towards the window , ‘
196532	196559	196583	196583	you	1281	’ Finding him in this gentle mood , Mr Pecksniff began to see another way out of his difficulties , besides the casting overboard of Jonas . ‘
196578	196582	196650	196650	I	0	’ he returned , ‘
196655	196656	196650	196650	I	0	’ ‘
196661	196667	196668	196668	You	1281	’ said the old man . ‘

196680	196693	196846	196846	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , with a melancholy pressure of his hand , ‘
196852	196860	196876	196876	His	864	’ said Mr Pecksniff , smiling dispassionately ; ‘
196874	196875	196876	196876	His	864	’ ‘
196881	196886	196938	196938	his	4645	’ cried old Martin . ‘

196975	196982	196938	196938	his	4645	’ cried Mr Pecksniff , boldly . ‘
196989	196990	196992	196992	I	0	’ ‘
197000	197005	197044	197044	I	0	’ said Martin Chuzzlewit , ‘
197042	197043	197056	197056	I	0	’ ‘
197048	197055	197243	197243	me	0	’ Mr Pecksniff answered , warmly . ‘
197249	197259	197266	197266	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , taking both his hands , ‘
197276	197318	197344	197344	him	270	’ In proof of the character he gave himself , Mr Pecksniff suffered tears of honesty to ooze out of his eyes . The old man gazed at him for a moment with a look of wonder , repeating to himself , ‘
197326	197340	197344	197344	him	270	’ But he mastered his surprise , and said , after a pause : ‘
197346	197347	197353	197353	I	0	’ ‘
197356	197361	197379	197379	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘
197377	197378	197379	197379	I	0	’ ‘
197382	197388	197409	197409	I	0	’ replied the old man , ‘
197417	197418	197437	197437	I	0	’ ‘
197445	197456	197458	197458	you	864	’ said Mr Pecksniff , as he left the room , ‘
197468	197666	197667	197667	Nephew	4700	’ He paved the way to the disclosure so very gently , that a quarter of an hour elapsed before he returned with Mr Jonas . In the meantime the young ladies had made their appearance , and the table had been set out for the refreshment of the travellers . Now , however well Mr Pecksniff , in his morality , had taught Jonas the lesson of dutiful behaviour to his uncle , and however perfectly Jonas , in the cunning of his nature , had learnt it , that young man ’s bearing , when presented to his father ’s brother , was anything but manly or engaging . Perhaps , indeed , so singular a mixture of defiance and obsequiousness , of fear and hardihood , of dogged sullenness and an attempt at enraging and propitiation , never was expressed in any one human figure as in that of Jonas , when , having raised his downcast eyes to Martin ’s face , he let them fall again , and uneasily closing and unclosing his hands without a moment ’s intermission , stood swinging himself from side to side , waiting to be addressed . ‘
197669	197675	197679	197681	a dutiful son	4701	’ said the old man . ‘
197686	197687	197695	197695	I	0	’ ‘
197698	197709	197731	197731	I	0	’ returned Jonas , looking up and down once more . ‘
197735	197736	197731	197731	I	0	’ ‘
197747	197758	197759	197759	Ecod	351	’ said the old man , glancing towards Mr Pecksniff . ‘
197761	197777	197808	197808	You	0	’ said Jonas , looking up again for a moment , and shaking his head , ‘
197806	197807	197808	197808	You	0	’ ‘
197819	197827	197830	197830	your	0	’ said Martin , after a pause . ‘
197833	197845	197830	197830	your	0	’ Jonas did so , and was almost at his ease . ‘
197848	197861	197887	197887	I	0	’ he whispered , as they drew their chairs about the table ; ‘
197890	198389	197887	197887	I	0	’ Mr Pecksniff only answered by a nudge of the elbow , which might either be construed into an indignant remonstrance or a cordial assent ; but which , in any case , was an emphatic admonition to his chosen son - in - law to be silent . He then proceeded to do the honours of the house with his accustomed ease and amiability . But not even Mr Pecksniff ’s guileless merriment could set such a party at their ease , or reconcile materials so utterly discordant and conflicting as those with which he had to deal . The unspeakable jealously and hatred which that night ’s explanation had sown in Charity ’s breast , was not to be so easily kept down ; and more than once it showed itself in such intensity , as seemed to render a full disclosure of all the circumstances then and there , impossible to be avoided . The beauteous Merry , too , with all the glory of her conquest fresh upon her , so probed and lanced the rankling disappointment of her sister by her capricious airs and thousand little trials of Mr Jonas ’s obedience , that she almost goaded her into a fit of madness , and obliged her to retire from table in a burst of passion , hardly less vehement than that to which she had abandoned herself in the first tumult of her wrath . The constraint imposed upon the family by the presence among them for the first time of Mary Graham ( for by that name old Martin Chuzzlewit had introduced her ) did not at all improve this state of things ; gentle and quiet though her manner was . Mr Pecksniff ’s situation was peculiarly trying ; for , what with having constantly to keep the peace between his daughters ; to maintain a reasonable show of affection and unity in his household ; to curb the growing ease and gaiety of Jonas , which vented itself in sundry insolences towards Mr Pinch , and an indefinable coarseness of manner in reference to Mary ( they being the two dependants ) ; to make no mention at all of his having perpetually to conciliate his rich old relative , and to smooth down , or explain away , some of the ten thousand bad appearances and combinations of bad appearances , by which they were surrounded on that unlucky evening -- what with having to do this , and it would be difficult to sum up how much more , without the least relief or assistance from anybody , it may be easily imagined that Mr Pecksniff had in his enjoyment something more than that usual portion of alloy which is mixed up with the best of men ’s delights . Perhaps he had never in his life felt such relief as when old Martin , looking at his watch , announced that it was time to go . ‘
198394	198398	198424	198425	Mr Pinch	221	’ he said , ‘
198434	198435	198424	198425	Mr Pinch	221	’ ‘
198440	198444	198450	198450	Merry	317	’ cried Pecksniff , ‘
198458	198459	198464	198464	you	11832	’ ‘
198470	198474	198497	198497	I	0	’ said Martin ; ‘
198501	198522	198523	198523	I	0	’ Mr Pecksniff already had his hat in his hand , but it was so emphatically said that he paused . ‘
198532	198536	198547	198547	Thomas	249	’ said Martin . ‘
198542	198543	198547	198547	Thomas	249	’ ‘
198551	198555	198564	198564	Thomas	249	’ cried Pecksniff , ‘
198577	198634	198638	198639	Mr Pinch	221	’ Tom was in some need of this injunction , for he felt so nervous , and trembled to such a degree , that he found it difficult to hold the lantern . How much more difficult when , at the old man ’s bidding she drew her hand through his -- Tom Pinch’s -- arm ! ‘
198641	198649	198658	198658	you	11832	’ said Martin , on the way , ‘
198660	198691	198695	198695	you	11832	’ Tom answered , with even more than his usual enthusiasm , that he was under obligations to Mr Pecksniff which the devotion of a lifetime would but imperfectly repay . ‘
198700	198704	198695	198695	you	11832	’ asked Martin . ‘
198710	198714	198715	198717	Mr Jonas Chuzzlewit	219	’ faltered Tom . ‘
198719	198723	198715	198717	Mr Jonas Chuzzlewit	219	’ said Mary . ‘
198729	198744	198757	198757	sir	864	’ cried Tom , greatly relieved , for his mind was running upon Martin . ‘
198759	198760	198941	198941	You	4722	’ ‘
198774	198940	198948	198948	he	4723	’ observed the old man . Tom felt that this was a rebuff for him , and could not but understand it as a left - handed hit at his employer . So he was silent . Mary felt that Mr Pinch was not remarkable for presence of mind , and that he could not say too little under existing circumstances . So SHE was silent . The old man , disgusted by what in his suspicious nature he considered a shameless and fulsome puff of Mr Pecksniff , which was a part of Tom ’s hired service and in which he was determined to persevere , set him down at once for a deceitful , servile , miserable fawner . So HE was silent . And though they were all sufficiently uncomfortable , it is fair to say that Martin was perhaps the most so ; for he had felt kindly towards Tom at first , and had been interested by his seeming simplicity . ‘
198942	198947	198948	198948	he	4723	’re like the rest , ’
198960	198991	199166	199166	Tom	249	‘ You had nearly imposed upon me , but you have lost your labour . You are too zealous a toad - eater , and betray yourself , Mr Pinch . ’
199159	199164	199166	199166	Tom	249	‘ Good gracious me ! ’
199168	199184	199194	199194	Jonas	415	‘ who would have thought of its being you ! You followed us , then ? ’
199185	199192	199194	199194	Jonas	415	‘ What ’s that to you ? ’
199196	199202	199215	199215	Tom	249	‘ Go to the devil ! ’
199203	199213	199225	199225	Jonas	415	‘ You are not very civil , I think , ’
199217	199223	199194	199194	Jonas	415	‘ Civil enough for YOU , ’
199227	199232	199249	199249	Tom	249	‘ Who are you ? ’
199233	199247	199255	199256	a liar	4729	‘ One who has as good a right to common consideration as another , ’
199252	199254	199255	199256	a liar	4729	‘ You ’re
199258	199262	199255	199256	a liar	4729	’ said Jonas . ‘
199281	199303	199314	199314	Tom	249	’re a pretty sort of fellow to talk about your rights , upon my soul ! Ha , ha!--Rights , too ! ’
199304	199312	199314	199314	Tom	249	‘ If you proceed in this way , ’
199318	199337	199349	199350	Mr Jonas	415	‘ you will oblige me to talk about my wrongs . But I hope your joke is over . ’
199338	199347	199349	199350	Mr Jonas	415	‘ It ’s the way with you curs , ’
199352	199417	199426	199426	Tom	249	‘ that when you know a man ’s in real earnest , you pretend to think he ’s joking , so that you may turn it off . But that wo n’t do with me . It ’s too stale . Now just attend to me for a bit , Mr Pitch , or Witch , or Stitch , or whatever your name is . ’
199418	199424	199426	199426	Tom	249	‘ My name is Pinch , ’
199428	199438	199459	199459	Jonas	415	‘ Have the goodness to call me by it . ’
199439	199457	199459	199459	Jonas	415	‘ What ! You must n’t even be called out of your name , must n’t you ! ’
199461	199463	199498	199498	Tom	249	‘ Pauper ’

199486	199496	199498	199498	Tom	249	‘ Never mind what you do in the city , ’
199500	199510	199520	199520	Jonas	415	‘ What have you got to say to me ? ’
199511	199518	199531	199531	Tom	249	‘ Just this , Mister Pinch , ’
199539	199563	199641	199641	you	4731	‘ I advise you to keep your own counsel , and to avoid title - tattle , and not to cut in where you ’re

200420	200470	200482	200483	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ It ’s nothing worth mentioning . I did n’t know the road ; the night ’s very dark ; and just as I came up with Mr Pinch’--he turned his face towards Tom , but not his eyes--‘I ran against a tree . It ’s only skin deep . ’

200531	200548	200760	200760	she	241	‘ Be of some use if you can . If you ca n’t , get out ! ’

202436	202447	202459	202459	Merry	317	‘ Being at the same time engaged to marry him , ’
202453	202457	202459	202459	Merry	317	‘ Oh yes , ’
202461	202504	202566	202566	he	991	‘ But I told the wretch -- my dear Mr Chuzzlewit , I told him when he asked me -- that if I ever did marry him , it should only be that I might hate and tease him all my life . ’

202574	202665	202671	202671	Merry	317	‘ and remember that from your bridal hour to the day which sees you brought as low as these , and laid in such a bed , there will be no appeal against him . Think , and speak , and act , for once , like an accountable creature . Is any control put upon your inclinations ? Are you forced into this match ? Are you insidiously advised or tempted to contract it , by any one ? I will not ask by whom ; by any one ? ’
202666	202669	202671	202671	Merry	317	‘ No , ’

202758	202791	202793	202793	Merry	317	‘ Oh , good gracious ! My dear Mr Chuzzlewit , it would be very hard to make him , though he IS a monster , accountable for other people ’s vanity , ’
202795	202805	202704	202704	Merry	317	‘ And poor dear Cherry is the vainest darling ! ’
202806	202814	202823	202823	Merry	317	‘ It was her mistake , then ? ’
202815	202821	202823	202823	Merry	317	‘ I hope it was , ’
202825	202867	202879	202879	Martin	221	‘ but , all along , the dear child has been so dreadfully jealous , and SO cross , that , upon my word and honour , it ’s impossible to please her , and it ’s of no use trying . ’
202868	202877	202879	202879	Martin	221	‘ Not forced , persuaded , or controlled , ’
202883	202925	202934	202934	Merry	317	‘ And that ’s true , I see . There is one chance yet . You may have lapsed into this engagement in very giddiness . It may have been the wanton act of a light head . Is that so ? ’

203102	203120	203224	203224	Merry	317	‘ that your married life may perhaps be miserable , full of bitterness , and most unhappy ? ’
203137	203222	203224	203224	Merry	317	‘ My dear Mr Chuzzlewit , what shocking words ! Of course , I shall quarrel with him . I should quarrel with any husband . Married people always quarrel , I believe . But as to being miserable , and bitter , and all those dreadful things , you know , why I could n’t be absolutely that , unless he always had the best of it ; and I mean to have the best of it myself . I always do now , ’
203234	203245	203254	203254	Martin	221	‘ for I make a perfect slave of the creature . ’

203258	203288	203345	203345	herself	317	‘ Let it go on ! I sought to know your mind , my dear , and you have shown it me . I wish you joy . Joy ! ’

203347	203384	203391	203391	He	219	‘ What a perfectly hideous monster to be wandering about churchyards in the broad daylight , frightening people out of their wits ! Do n’t come here , Griffin , or I ’ll go away directly . ’

203423	203427	203429	203429	Merry	317	‘ About you , ’

203927	203953	203957	203958	a Griffin	4801	’ He glanced up at her from the ground , almost as darkly as he had looked at Tom Pinch ; but held his peace . ‘

He was enjoying the sweets of domestic repose , and gazing on them with a calm delight . The day being sultry , and the window open , the legs of Mr Mould were on the window - seat , and his back reclined against the shutter . Over his shining head a handkerchief was drawn , to guard his baldness from the flies . The room was fragrant with the smell of punch , a tumbler of which grateful compound stood upon a small round table , convenient to the hand of Mr Mould ; so deftly mixed that as his eye looked down into the cool transparent drink , another eye , peering brightly from behind the crisp lemon - peel , looked up at him , and twinkled like a star . Deep in the City , and within the ward of Cheap , stood Mr Mould ’s establishment . His Harem , or , in other words , the common sitting room of Mrs Mould and family , was at the back , over the little counting - house behind the shop ; abutting on a churchyard small and shady . In this domestic chamber Mr Mould now sat ; gazing , a placid man , upon his punch and home . If , for a moment at a time , he sought a wider prospect , whence he might return with freshened zest to these enjoyments , his moist glance wandered like a sunbeam through a rural screen of scarlet runners , trained on strings before the window , and he looked down , with an artist ’s eye , upon the graves . The partner of his life , and daughters twain , were Mr Mould ’s companions . Plump as any partridge was each Miss Mould , and Mrs M. was plumper than the two together . So round and chubby were their fair proportions , that they might have been the bodies once belonging to the angels ’
205025	205031	205074	205075	Mr Mould	420	‘ We understand each other ; ’
205065	205072	205074	205075	Mr Mould	420	‘ Quite the buzz of insects , ’
205085	205110	205122	205123	Mrs Mould	496	‘ It puts one in mind of the sound of animated nature in the agricultural districts . It ’s exactly like the woodpecker tapping . ’
205111	205120	205150	205151	Mr Mould	420	‘ The woodpecker tapping the hollow ELM tree , ’
205143	205148	205150	205151	Mr Mould	420	‘ Ha , ha ! ’
205153	205202	205242	205243	Mr Mould	420	‘ Not at all bad , my dear . We shall be glad to hear from you again , Mrs M. Hollow elm tree , eh ! Ha , ha ! Very good indeed . I ’ve seen worse than that in the Sunday papers , my love . ’

205259	205297	205307	205307	he	420	‘ It ’s beech in the song . Elm , eh ? Yes , to be sure . Ha , ha , ha ! Upon my soul , that ’s one of the best things I know ? ’
205318	205391	205412	205413	Mrs Mould	496	‘ Elm , eh ? Yes , to be sure . Elm , of course . Ha , ha , ha ! Upon my life , you know , that ought to be sent to somebody who could make use of it . It ’s one of the smartest things that ever was said . Hollow ELM tree , eh ? of course . Very hollow . Ha , ha , ha ! ’
205402	205410	205412	205413	Mrs Mould	496	‘ That ’s Tacker , I know , ’
205415	205449	205459	205459	Tacker	432	‘ by the wheezing he makes . Who that hears him now , would suppose he ’d ever had wind enough to carry the feathers on his head ! Come in , Tacker . ’

205753	205874	205877	205879	some happy creeturs	4832	’ The lady in question was by this time in the doorway , curtseying to Mrs Mould . At the same moment a peculiar fragrance was borne upon the breeze , as if a passing fairy had hiccoughed , and had previously been to a wine - vaults . Mrs Gamp made no response to Mr Mould , but curtseyed to Mrs Mould again , and held up her hands and eyes , as in a devout thanksgiving that she looked so well . She was neatly , but not gaudily attired , in the weeds she had worn when Mr Pecksniff had the pleasure of making her acquaintance ; and was perhaps the turning of a scale more snuffy . ‘
205881	205886	205939	205940	Mrs Gamp	223	’ Mrs Gamp observed , ‘
205921	205938	206039	206039	she	223	’m sure ; for young you are and will be . I says to Mrs Harris , ’
205943	206037	206039	206039	she	223	‘ only t’other day ; the last Monday evening fortnight as ever dawned upon this Piljian ’s Projiss of a mortal wale ; I says to Mrs Harris when she says to me , “ Years and our trials , Mrs Gamp , sets marks upon us all . ”--“Say not the words , Mrs Harris , if you and me is to be continual friends , for sech is not the case . Mrs Mould , ” I says , making so free , I will confess , as use the name , ’
206044	206140	206293	206294	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ “ is one of them that goes agen the obserwation straight ; and never , Mrs Harris , whilst I ’ve a drop of breath to draw , will I set by , and not stand up , do n’t think it . ”--“I ast your pardon , ma’am , ” says Mrs Harris , “ and I humbly grant your grace ; for if ever a woman lived as would see her feller creeturs into fits to serve her friends , well do I know that woman ’s name is Sairey Gamp . ” ’
206284	206291	206293	206294	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ And likeways what a pleasure , ’
206305	206346	206368	206369	Mr Mould	420	‘ to see them two young ladies as I know’d afore a tooth in their pretty heads was cut , and have many a day seen -- ah , the sweet creeturs!--playing at berryins down in the shop , and follerin ’
206371	206391	206409	206410	Mrs Gamp	223	’ as she thus got in a carefully regulated routine to that gentleman , she shook her head waggishly ; ‘

206414	206419	206434	206434	sir	864	’ returned the undertaker . ‘
206436	206448	206463	206463	they	4844	’ said Mrs Gamp , nodding yet more waggishly than before . ‘
206467	206468	206477	206478	Mrs Gamp	223	’ ‘
206480	206495	206508	206509	Mrs Gamp	223	’ said Mould , with a chuckle--‘Not bad in Mrs Gamp , my dear ? ’
206496	206506	206508	206509	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Oh yes , you do know , sir ! ’

206658	206678	206693	206694	Mr Mould	420	’ said Mrs Gamp , wiping her eye with her shawl , and resuming the thread of her discourse . ‘
206696	206718	206734	206735	Mrs Gamp	223	’ Mr Mould winked at Mrs Mould , whom he had by this time taken on his knee , and said : ‘
206745	206746	206754	206754	sir	864	’ ‘
206756	206769	206807	206807	you	223	’ said Mrs Gamp , while both the daughters blushed and tittered . ‘
206808	206828	206843	206844	the undertaker	11846	’re all of one age now . For as to you and Mrs Mould , sir , ever having grandchildren-- ’
206829	206841	206843	206844	the undertaker	11846	‘ Oh ! Fie , fie ! Nonsense , Mrs Gamp , ’
206846	206862	206881	206882	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Devilish smart , though . Ca - pi - tal!’--this was in a whisper . ‘
206887	206946	206959	206960	Mrs Mould	496	’ Mrs Gamp took the chair that was nearest the door , and casting up her eyes towards the ceiling , feigned to be wholly insensible to the fact of a glass of rum being in preparation , until it was placed in her hand by one of the young ladies , when she exhibited the greatest surprise . ‘
206950	206954	207150	207151	Mrs Harris	422	’ she said , ‘
207122	207148	207265	207265	your	9146	‘ ouse , I thought so too . But now , ” I says , “ my half a pint of porter fully satisfies ; perwisin ’
207213	207237	207265	207265	your	9146	’ The precise connection between these observations and the glass of rum , did not appear ; for Mrs Gamp proposing as a toast ‘
207245	207261	207268	207269	Mrs Gamp	223	’ took off the dram in quite a scientific manner , without any further remarks . ‘
207271	207310	207313	207314	Mr Chuffey	412	’ asked Mould again , as that lady wiped her lips upon her shawl , and nibbled a corner off a soft biscuit , which she appeared to carry in her pocket as a provision against contingent drams . ‘

But she is otherways engaged at night , and they are in wants of night - watching ; consequent she says to them , having reposed the greatest friendliness in me for twenty year , “ The soberest person going , and the best of blessings in a sick room , is Mrs Gamp . Send a boy to Kingsgate Street , ” she says , “ and snap her up at any price , for Mrs Gamp is worth her weight and more in goldian guineas . ” My landlord brings the message down to me , and says , “ bein ’

207729	207733	207777	207778	Mrs Gamp	223	’ said would . ‘

207975	207983	208049	208050	Mrs Gamp	223	’ said Mould , with much condescension . ‘
208060	208089	208049	208050	Mrs Gamp	223	’ Mrs Gamp received them , and scenting no more rum in the wind ( for the bottle was locked up again ) rose to take her departure . ‘
208098	208102	208164	208166	the delighted undertaker	4899	’ said Mrs Gamp ‘
208130	208146	208164	208166	the delighted undertaker	4899	’m sure , if I was you , I should be jealous of Mr Mould . ’
208147	208162	208177	208178	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Tut , tut ! Bah , bah ! Go along , Mrs Gamp ! ’
208168	208175	208177	208178	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ As to the young ladies , ’
208184	208221	208235	208235	Mould	420	‘ bless their sweet looks -- how they can ever reconsize it with their duties to be so grown up with such young parents , it an’t for sech as me to give a guess at . ’
208222	208233	208265	208265	he	420	‘ Nonsense , nonsense . Be off , Mrs Gamp ! ’
208254	208264	208328	208328	Mould	420	‘ I ’ll tell you what , my dear , ’
208280	208326	208364	208365	Mrs Mould	496	‘ that ’s a ve - ry shrewd woman . That ’s a woman whose intellect is immensely superior to her station in life . That ’s a woman who observes and reflects in an uncommon manner . She ’s the sort of woman now , ’
208345	208363	208459	208459	she	496	‘ one would almost feel disposed to bury for nothing ; and do it neatly , too ! ’
208461	208467	208694	208695	the gentleman	977	‘ only a little screwed . ’
208686	208692	208702	208703	the landlord	10943	‘ No better , then ? ’
208697	208700	208711	208712	the landlady	9069	‘ Worse ! ’
208705	208709	208723	208727	the chambermaid from the background	4919	‘ Much worse , ’
208714	208721	208746	208747	the gentleman	977	‘ Oh ! a deal badder , ’
208740	208744	208746	208747	the gentleman	977	‘ Poor fellow ! ’
208749	208789	208805	208806	the chambermaid	4925	‘ I am sorry to hear it . The worst of it is , that I have no idea what friends or relations he has , or where they live , except that it certainly is not in London . ’
208811	208842	208853	208854	the gentleman	977	‘ that of all the many wague directions she had ever seen or heerd of ( and they was n’t few in an hotel ) , THAT was the waguest . ’
208843	208851	208853	208854	the gentleman	977	‘ The fact is , you see , ’
208856	208995	209055	209065	the gentleman , who was no other than our old friend	4930	‘ as I told you yesterday when you sent to me , I really know very little about him . We were school - fellows together ; but since that time I have only met him twice . On both occasions I was in London for a boy ’s holiday ( having come up for a week or so from Wiltshire ) , and lost sight of him again directly . The letter bearing my name and address which you found upon his table , and which led to your applying to me , is in answer , you will observe , to one he wrote from this house the very day he was taken ill , making an appointment with him at his own request . Here is his letter , if you wish to see it . ’
209043	209053	209078	209079	the landlord	10943	‘ He has very little luggage , you say ? ’
209070	209076	209078	209079	the landlord	10943	‘ Nothing but a portmanteau , ’
209081	209088	209078	209079	the landlord	10943	‘ and very little in it . ’
209089	209099	209078	209079	the landlord	10943	‘ A few pounds in his purse , though ? ’
209100	209125	209078	209079	the landlord	10943	‘ Yes . It ’s sealed up , and in the cash - box . I made a memorandum of the amount , which you ’re

209205	209210	209194	209194	you	4930	’ replied the landlord , ‘

209249	209254	209221	209221	I	0	’ said the landlady . ‘
209262	209271	209277	209277	I	0	’ said the chambermaid in a bland whisper . ‘
209281	209286	209305	209305	I	0	’ said John Westlock . ‘
209317	209318	209305	209305	I	0	’ ‘
209321	209326	209362	209365	The night - nurse	4939	’ cried Mrs Gamp . ‘
209331	209361	209362	209365	The night - nurse	4939	’ She groaned her admiration so audibly , that they all turned round . Mrs Gamp felt the necessity of advancing , bundle in hand , and introducing herself . ‘
209367	209371	209430	209430	ma’am	9146	’ she observed , ‘
209432	209440	209485	209485	herself	223	’ dropping a curtsey to the landlady , ‘
209491	209504	209485	209485	herself	223	’ the nater of our painful dooty . If they wos made accordin ’
209515	209681	209686	209686	you	0	’ Regarding herself as having now delivered her inauguration address , Mrs Gamp curtseyed all round , and signified her wish to be conducted to the scene of her official duties . The chambermaid led her , through a variety of intricate passages , to the top of the house ; and pointing at length to a solitary door at the end of a gallery , informed her that yonder was the chamber where the patient lay . That done , she hurried off with all the speed she could make . Mrs Gamp traversed the gallery in a great heat from having carried her large bundle up so many stairs , and tapped at the door which was immediately opened by Mrs Prig , bonneted and shawled and all impatience to be gone . Mrs Prig was of the Gamp build , but not so fat ; and her voice was deeper and more like a man ’s . She had also a beard . ‘
209692	209701	209686	209686	you	0	’ Mrs Prig observed , in some displeasure . ‘
209712	209716	209719	209719	I	0	’ said Mrs Gamp ‘
209728	209767	209719	209719	I	0	’ She had begun to make signs of inquiry in reference to the position of the patient and his overhearing them -- for there was a screen before the door -- when Mrs Prig settled that point easily . ‘
209770	209775	209791	209791	you	0	’ she said aloud , ‘
209794	209795	209809	209810	Mrs Gamp	223	’ ‘
209797	209807	209809	209810	Mrs Gamp	223	’ to tell afore you goes , my dear ? ’
209827	209832	209833	209834	Mrs Prig	224	‘ The pickled salmon , ’
209837	209872	209895	209896	Mrs Prig	224	‘ is quite delicious . I can partlck’ler recommend it . Do n’t have nothink to say to the cold meat , for it tastes of the stable . The drinks is all good . ’
209880	209893	209895	209896	Mrs Prig	224	‘ The physic and them things is on the drawers and mankleshelf , ’
209900	209924	210013	210014	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ He took his last slime draught at seven . The easy - chair an’t soft enough . You ’ll want his piller . ’
209999	210012	210013	210014	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ A little dull , but not so bad as might be , ’
210017	210019	210023	210024	a parapidge	4952	‘ I ’m
210043	210079	210023	210024	a parapidge	4952	’ It will be seen from these remarks that Mrs Gamp was looking out of window . When she had exhausted the prospect , she tried the easy - chair , which she indignantly declared was ‘
210085	210337	210352	210352	he	4953	’ Next she pursued her researches among the physic - bottles , glasses , jugs , and tea - cups ; and when she had entirely satisfied her curiosity on all these subjects of investigation , she untied her bonnet - strings and strolled up to the bedside to take a look at the patient . A young man -- dark and not ill - looking -- with long black hair , that seemed the blacker for the whiteness of the bed - clothes . His eyes were partly open , and he never ceased to roll his head from side to side upon the pillow , keeping his body almost quiet . He did not utter words ; but every now and then gave vent to an expression of impatience or fatigue , sometimes of surprise ; and still his restless head -- oh , weary , weary hour!--went to and fro without a moment ’s intermission . Mrs Gamp solaced herself with a pinch of snuff , and stood looking at him with her head inclined a little sideways , as a connoisseur might gaze upon a doubtful work of art . By degrees , a horrible remembrance of one branch of her calling took possession of the woman ; and stooping down , she pinned his wandering arms against his sides , to see how he would look if laid out as a dead man . Her fingers itched to compose his limbs in that last marble attitude . ‘
210340	210351	210352	210352	he	4953	’ said Mrs Gamp , walking away from the bed , ‘
210359	210410	210352	210352	he	4953	’ She now proceeded to unpack her bundle ; lighted a candle with the aid of a fire - box on the drawers ; filled a small kettle , as a preliminary to refreshing herself with a cup of tea in the course of the night ; laid what she called ‘
210417	210476	210480	210481	young woman	4954	’ for the same philanthropic purpose ; and also set forth a small tea - board , that nothing might be wanting for her comfortable enjoyment . These preparations occupied so long , that when they were brought to a conclusion it was high time to think about supper ; so she rang the bell and ordered it . ‘
210483	210499	210625	210625	you	4954	’ said Mrs Gamp to the assistant chambermaid , in a tone expressive of weakness , ‘
210562	210576	210625	210625	you	4954	‘ ouse , will you be so kind as bring it , for I ’m
210580	210616	210620	210621	the doctors	4956	‘ em , and they does a world of good in a sick room . If they draws the Brighton Old Tipper here , I takes THAT ale at night , my love , it bein ’
210670	210720	210620	210621	the doctors	4956	’ Having preferred these moderate requests , Mrs Gamp observed that she would stand at the door until the order was executed , to the end that the patient might not be disturbed by her opening it a second time ; and therefore she would thank the young woman to ‘
210724	210784	210620	210621	the doctors	4956	’ A tray was brought with everything upon it , even to the cucumber and Mrs Gamp accordingly sat down to eat and drink in high good humour . The extent to which she availed herself of the vinegar , and supped up that refreshing fluid with the blade of her knife , can scarcely be expressed in narrative . ‘
210787	210802	210869	210869	She	4963	’ sighed Mrs Gamp , as she meditated over the warm shilling’s - worth , ‘
210861	210868	210922	210923	Mrs Gamp	223	’m sure I never see one ! ’
210910	210920	210922	210923	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ I a’most forgot the piller , I declare ! ’
210929	210942	210922	210923	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ There ! Now he ’s comfortable as he can be , I ’m
210958	211404	210922	210923	Mrs Gamp	223	’ With this view , she went about the construction of an extemporaneous bed in the easy - chair , with the addition of the next easy one for her feet . Having formed the best couch that the circumstances admitted of , she took out of her bundle a yellow night - cap , of prodigious size , in shape resembling a cabbage ; which article of dress she fixed and tied on with the utmost care , previously divesting herself of a row of bald old curls that could scarcely be called false , they were so very innocent of anything approaching to deception . From the same repository she brought forth a night - jacket , in which she also attired herself . Finally , she produced a watchman ’s coat which she tied round her neck by the sleeves , so that she become two people ; and looked , behind , as if she were in the act of being embraced by one of the old patrol . All these arrangements made , she lighted the rush - light , coiled herself up on her couch , and went to sleep . Ghostly and dark the room became , and full of lowering shadows . The distant noises in the streets were gradually hushed ; the house was quiet as a sepulchre ; the dead of night was coffined in the silent city . Oh , weary , weary hour ! Oh , haggard mind , groping darkly through the past ; incapable of detaching itself from the miserable present ; dragging its heavy chain of care through imaginary feasts and revels , and scenes of awful pomp ; seeking but a moment ’s rest among the long - forgotten haunts of childhood , and the resorts of yesterday ; and dimly finding fear and horror everywhere ! Oh , weary , weary hour ! What were the wanderings of Cain , to these ! Still , without a moment ’s interval , the burning head tossed to and fro . Still , from time to time , fatigue , impatience , suffering , and surprise , found utterance upon that rack , and plainly too , though never once in words . At length , in the solemn hour of midnight , he began to talk ; waiting awfully for answers sometimes ; as though invisible companions were about his bed ; and so replying to their speech and questioning again . Mrs Gamp awoke , and sat up in her bed ; presenting on the wall the shadow of a gigantic night constable , struggling with a prisoner . ‘
211411	211419	210922	210923	Mrs Gamp	223	’ she cried , in sharp reproof . ‘
211429	211453	210922	210923	Mrs Gamp	223	’ There was no alteration in the face , or in the incessant motion of the head , but he talked on wildly . ‘
211456	211471	211552	211553	Mrs Gamp	223	’ said Mrs Gamp , coming out of the chair with an impatient shiver ; ‘
211479	211501	211511	211513	the sick man	4966	’ too pleasant to last ! The devil ’s in the night , I think , it ’s turned so chilly ! ’
211502	211509	211511	211513	the sick man	4966	‘ Do n’t drink so much ! ’
211515	211543	211552	211553	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ You ’ll ruin us all . Do n’t you see how the fountain sinks ? Look at the mark where the sparkling water was just now ! ’
211544	211550	211552	211553	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Sparkling water , indeed ! ’
211555	211563	211571	211571	you	4965	‘ I ’ll have a sparkling cup o ’
211577	211609	211635	211636	Mrs Gamp	223	’ He burst into a laugh , which , being prolonged , fell off into a dismal wail . Checking himself , with fierce inconstancy he began to count -- fast . ‘
211622	211633	211642	211642	her	223	’ “ One , two , buckle my shoe , ” ’
211692	211773	211794	211794	their	4969	’ Awaiting this desirable consummation , she sat down so close to the fender ( which was a high one ) that her nose rested upon it ; and for some time she drowsily amused herself by sliding that feature backwards and forwards along the brass top , as far as she could , without changing her position to do it . She maintained , all the while , a running commentary upon the wanderings of the man in bed . ‘
211811	211817	211837	211837	you	4965	’ he cried , anxiously . ‘
211841	211842	211852	211853	Mrs Gamp	223	’ ‘
211847	211850	211852	211853	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ em , ’
211855	211861	211852	211853	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ all the whole kit of ‘
211872	211873	211885	211885	me	0	’ ‘
211887	211888	211889	211889	You	4965	’ ‘
211903	211910	211918	211918	You	4965	’ retorted Mrs Gamp , composedly , ‘
211934	211935	211918	211918	You	4965	’ ‘
211956	211957	211970	211970	They	4970	’ ‘
211964	211969	212018	212019	Mrs Gamp	223	’ said Mrs Gamp . ‘
211971	212010	212018	212019	Mrs Gamp	223	’re coming four abreast , each man with his arm entwined in the next man ’s , and his hand upon his shoulder . What ’s that upon the arm of every man , and on the flag ? ’
212011	212016	212018	212019	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Spiders , p’raps , ’
212021	212037	212018	212019	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Crape ! Black crape ! Good God ! why do they wear it outside ? ’
212038	212042	212018	212019	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Would you have ‘
212051	212056	212062	212062	your	4965	’ Mrs Gamp retorted . ‘
212065	212123	212018	212019	Mrs Gamp	223	’ The fire beginning by this time to impart a grateful warmth , Mrs Gamp became silent ; gradually rubbed her nose more and more slowly along the top of the fender ; and fell into a heavy doze . She was awakened by the room ringing ( as she fancied ) with a name she knew : ‘
212126	212254	212018	212019	Mrs Gamp	223	’ The sound was so distinct and real , and so full of agonised entreaty , that Mrs Gamp jumped up in terror , and ran to the door . She expected to find the passage filled with people , come to tell her that the house in the city had taken fire . But the place was empty ; not a soul was there . She opened the window , and looked out . Dark , dull , dingy , and desolate house - tops . As she passed to her seat again , she glanced at the patient . Just the same ; but silent . Mrs Gamp was so warm now , that she threw off the watchman ’s coat , and fanned herself . ‘
212264	212268	212279	212281	That dratted Chuffey	412	’ she said . ‘
212288	212380	212383	212383	Jonas	219	’ The supposition was probable enough . At any rate , a pinch of snuff , and the song of the steaming kettle , quite restored the tone of Mrs Gamp ’s nerves , which were none of the weakest . She brewed her tea ; made some buttered toast ; and sat down at the tea - board , with her face to the fire . When once again , in a tone more terrible than that which had vibrated in her slumbering ear , these words were shrieked out : ‘
212387	212546	212553	212553	nurse	4971	’ Mrs Gamp dropped the cup she was in the act of raising to her lips , and turned round with a start that made the little tea - board leap . The cry had come from the bed . It was bright morning the next time Mrs Gamp looked out of the window , and the sun was rising cheerfully . Lighter and lighter grew the sky , and noisier the streets ; and high into the summer air uprose the smoke of newly kindled fires , until the busy day was broad awake . Mrs Prig relieved punctually , having passed a good night at her other patient ’s . Mr Westlock came at the same time , but he was not admitted , the disorder being infectious . The doctor came too . The doctor shook his head . It was all he could do , under the circumstances , and he did it well . ‘
212555	212556	212559	212559	sir	864	’ ‘
212561	212566	212574	212574	sir	864	’ said Mrs Gamp . ‘
212570	212571	212574	212574	sir	864	’ ‘

214212	214217	214256	214257	the barber	5034	’ said the youth . ‘
214234	214246	214256	214257	the barber	5034	’ heads was made for men of taste ; not snobs . ’
214247	214254	214256	214257	the barber	5034	‘ Beau - ti - ful ! ’
214260	214282	214291	214292	the youth	938	‘ A grass - green frock - coat , too , bound with gold ; and a cockade in your hat ! ’
214283	214289	214291	214292	the youth	938	‘ I should hope so , ’
214294	214344	214350	214351	the barber	5034	‘ Blow the cockade , though ; for , except that it do n’t turn round , it ’s like the wentilator that used to be in the kitchen winder at Todgers ’s . You ai n’t seen the old lady ’s name in the Gazette , have you ? ’
214345	214348	214350	214351	the barber	5034	‘ No , ’
214353	214359	214372	214372	Bailey	329	‘ Is she a bankrupt ? ’
214360	214370	214372	214372	Bailey	329	‘ If she ai n’t , she will be , ’
214374	214391	214350	214351	the barber	5034	‘ That bis’ness never can be carried on without ME . Well ! How are you ? ’
214392	214396	214350	214351	the barber	5034	‘ Oh ! I ’m

214444	214452	214472	214472	You	5043	’ returned Bailey , with some displeasure . ‘
214492	214539	214472	214472	You	5043	‘ em . That ’s a gentleman ai n’t it ? You would n’t like a ride in a cab , would you ? Why , it would n’t be safe to offer it . You ’d faint away , only to see me a - comin ’
214548	214597	214613	214613	brother	1083	’ To convey a slight idea of the effect of this approach , Mr Bailey counterfeited in his own person the action of a high - trotting horse and threw up his head so high , in backing against a pump , that he shook his hat off . ‘
214607	214611	214669	214669	Poll	510	’ said Bailey , ‘
214638	214650	214669	214669	Poll	510	’ his missis . That ’s a horse , I hope ? ’
214651	214667	214669	214669	Poll	510	‘ Ah ! you ’ll never want to buy any more red polls , now , ’
214682	214705	214714	214714	Bailey	329	‘ You ’ll never want to buy any more red polls now , to hang up over the sink , will you ? ’
214706	214712	214714	214714	Bailey	329	‘ I should think not , ’
214716	214745	214669	214669	Poll	510	‘ Reether so . I would n’t have nothin’ to say to any bird below a Peacock ; and HE’d be wulgar . Well , how are you ? ’

214754	214819	214826	214827	old feller	5049	’ said Poll . He answered the question again because Mr Bailey asked it again ; Mr Bailey asked it again , because -- accompanied with a straddling action of the white cords , a bend of the knees , and a striking forth of the top - boots -- it was an easy horse - fleshy , turfy sort of thing to do . ‘
214829	214862	214879	214880	A woman	10335	’ added Mr Bailey , with the same graceful rakishness . He was quite the man - about - town of the conversation , while the easy - shaver was the child . ‘
214874	214878	214879	214880	A woman	10335	’ said Paul . ‘
214882	214887	214897	214899	The little barber	5053	’ cried Mr Bailey , ‘
214893	214896	214988	214989	the barber	5034	’ note ! ’
214969	214986	214988	214989	the barber	5034	‘ He ’s newly married , and he brings his young wife home to - night , ’
214991	214994	215021	215022	Jonas Chuzzlewit	219	‘ So I ’m
215019	215020	215021	215022	Jonas Chuzzlewit	219	’ ‘
215025	215029	215021	215022	Jonas Chuzzlewit	219	’ said Bailey . ‘
215032	215036	215045	215045	you	0	’ returned Paul : ‘
215049	215050	215045	215045	you	0	’ ‘
215055	215060	215077	215077	they	5066	’ cried Mr Bailey ; ‘
215086	215087	215077	215077	they	5066	’ ‘
215090	215094	215108	215108	she	5050	’ said Paul . ‘
215097	215106	215129	215129	I	0	’ said Mr Bailey , with a wink ; ‘
215146	215695	215711	215711	she	5070	’ Mr Bailey spoke as if he already had a leg and three - quarters in the grave , and this had happened twenty or thirty years ago . Paul Sweedlepipe , the meek , was so perfectly confounded by his precocious self - possession , and his patronizing manner , as well as by his boots , cockade , and livery , that a mist swam before his eyes , and he saw -- not the Bailey of acknowledged juvenility from Todgers ’s Commercial Boarding House , who had made his acquaintance within a twelvemonth , by purchasing , at sundry times , small birds at twopence each -- but a highly - condensed embodiment of all the sporting grooms in London ; an abstract of all the stable - knowledge of the time ; a something at a high - pressure that must have had existence many years , and was fraught with terrible experiences . And truly , though in the cloudy atmosphere of Todgers ’s , Mr Bailey ’s genius had ever shone out brightly in this particular respect , it now eclipsed both time and space , cheated beholders of their senses , and worked on their belief in defiance of all natural laws . He walked along the tangible and real stones of Holborn Hill , an undersized boy ; and yet he winked the winks , and thought the thoughts , and did the deeds , and said the sayings of an ancient man . There was an old principle within him , and a young surface without . He became an inexplicable creature ; a breeched and booted Sphinx . There was no course open to the barber , but to go distracted himself , or to take Bailey for granted ; and he wisely chose the latter . Mr Bailey was good enough to continue to bear him company , and to entertain him , as they went , with easy conversation on various sporting topics ; especially on the comparative merits , as a general principle , of horses with white stockings , and horses without . In regard to the style of tail to be preferred , Mr Bailey had opinions of his own , which he explained , but begged they might by no means influence his friend ’s , as here he knew he had the misfortune to differ from some excellent authorities . He treated Mr Sweedlepipe to a dram , compounded agreeably to his own directions , which he informed him had been invented by a member of the Jockey Club ; and , as they were by this time near the barber ’s destination , he observed that , as he had an hour to spare , and knew the parties , he would , if quite agreeable , be introduced to Mrs Gamp . Paul knocked at Jonas Chuzzlewit ’s ; and , on the door being opened by that lady , made the two distinguished persons known to one another . It was a happy feature in Mrs Gamp ’s twofold profession , that it gave her an interest in everything that was young as well as in everything that was old . She received Mr Bailey with much kindness . ‘
215702	215710	215711	215711	she	5070	’m sure , of you to come , ’
215717	215729	215755	215755	They	5072	‘ as well as bring so nice a friend . But I ’m
215753	215754	215769	215769	she	5070	’ ‘
215756	215763	215769	215769	she	5070	’re late , ai n’t they ? ’
215778	215784	215769	215769	she	5070	‘ Well , sir , considern ’
215793	215896	215899	215900	Mrs Chuzzlewit	516	’ said Mrs Gamp . Mr Bailey inquired whether the Wings of Love had ever won a plate , or could be backed to do anything remarkable ; and being informed that it was not a horse , but merely a poetical or figurative expression , evinced considerable disgust . Mrs Gamp was so very much astonished by his affable manners and great ease , that she was about to propound to her landlord in a whisper the staggering inquiry , whether he was a man or a boy , when Mr Sweedlepipe , anticipating her design , made a timely diversion . ‘
215902	215907	215918	215918	my	0	’ said Paul aloud . ‘
215921	215926	215899	215900	Mrs Chuzzlewit	516	’ observed Mrs Gamp . ‘
215938	215954	215899	215900	Mrs Chuzzlewit	516	’ Mr Bailey received this as a compliment , and said , adjusting his cravat , ‘
215958	215959	215983	215983	Charity	241	’ ‘
215977	215982	215983	215983	Charity	241	’ Mrs Gamp observed . ‘
215985	215989	216001	216001	Cherry	241	’ said Bailey . ‘
215995	216000	216010	216010	Cherry	241	’ cried Mrs Gamp . ‘
216005	216009	216010	216010	Cherry	241	’ said Bailey . ‘
216022	216023	216010	216010	Cherry	241	’ ‘
216034	216043	216010	216010	Cherry	241	’ retorted Mrs Gamp , shaking her head . ‘
216049	216050	216010	216010	Cherry	241	’ ‘
216053	216072	216074	216074	he	5076	’ cried Mr Bailey , slapping a little cloud of pipe - clay out of his left leg , ‘
216083	216186	216217	216217	sir	864	’ As these words were mysterious , Mrs Gamp called upon him to explain , which Mr Bailey proceeded to do ; that lady listening greedily to everything he said . He was yet in the fullness of his narrative when the sound of wheels , and a double knock at the street door , announced the arrival of the newly married couple . Begging him to reserve what more he had to say for her hearing on the way home , Mrs Gamp took up the candle , and hurried away to receive and welcome the young mistress of the house . ‘
216197	216211	216238	216238	She	5080	’ said Mrs Gamp , dropping a curtsey as they entered the hall ; ‘
216236	216237	216238	216238	She	5080	’ ‘
216245	216250	216258	216258	you	5076	’ grumbled Mr Jonas . ‘
216260	216261	216268	216268	you	5076	’ ‘
216271	216281	216321	216321	you	5076	’ said Mrs Gamp , going upstairs before them . ‘
216325	216332	216343	216343	I	0	’ added Mrs Gamp , internally , ‘
216347	216431	216434	216434	you	5076	’ It was true ; she did not . The death that had gone before the bridal seemed to have left its shade upon the house . The air was heavy and oppressive ; the rooms were dark ; a deep gloom filled up every chink and corner . Upon the hearthstone , like a creature of ill omen , sat the aged clerk , with his eyes fixed on some withered branches in the stove . He rose and looked at her . ‘
216440	216451	216434	216434	you	5076	’ said Jonas carelessly , as he dusted his boots ; ‘
216462	216463	216472	216472	sir	864	’ ‘
216474	216479	216495	216495	I	0	’ retorted Mrs Gamp . ‘
216500	216521	216533	216534	Mrs Gamp	223	’ Mr Jonas was not in the best of humours , for he merely said , as he looked round , ‘
216536	216537	216549	216550	the nurse	5087	’ ‘
216539	216547	216571	216572	Mrs Gamp	223	’m a - going immediate , sir , ’
216552	216569	216571	216572	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ unless there ’s nothink I can do for you , ma’am . Ai n’t there , ’
216590	216605	216611	216611	Merry	317	‘ ai n’t there nothink I can do for you , my little bird ? ’
216606	216609	216611	216611	Merry	317	‘ No , ’
216616	216625	216713	216714	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ You had better go away , please ! ’
216695	216712	216713	216714	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Would you be so good , my darling dovey of a dear young married lady , ’
216722	216737	216750	216750	Gamp	223	‘ as put that somewheres where you can keep it in your mind ? I ’m
216761	216791	216875	216876	Mrs Gamp	223	’ quite handy , I will make so bold as call in now and then , and make inquiry how your health and spirits is , my precious chick ! ’
216853	216874	216875	216876	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ But I will say , and I would if I was led a Martha to the Stakes for it , ’
216885	216903	216916	216916	Bailey	329	‘ that she do n’t look much like a merry one at this present moment of time . ’
216904	216914	216923	216924	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Ah ! wait till you hear her laugh ! ’
216918	216921	216923	216924	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Hem ! ’
216932	216938	217098	217098	Jonas	516	‘ I will , child . ’
217084	217096	217113	217113	Merry	317	‘ It ai n’t good enough for you , I suppose ? ’
217104	217111	217113	217113	Merry	317	‘ Why , it IS dull , ’
217121	217128	217113	217113	Merry	317	‘ It ’ll be duller before you ’re
217133	217137	217197	217197	She	516	’ retorted Jonas , ‘

217230	217236	217237	217237	he	412	‘ You are not married ? ’
217241	217245	217262	217262	He	412	‘ Not married ? ’

217472	217475	217546	217546	He	329	‘ Governor . ’
217551	217573	217630	217630	his	329	‘ A barrow , good people , a mere barrow ; nothing to what we could do , if we chose ! ’

217677	217687	218476	218478	The very man	5120	‘ No , you wo n’t , my lad ! ’
217867	217871	218476	218478	The very man	5120	‘ Now , young ‘
217881	217896	217898	217898	they	9873	’ inquiring of elderly ladies who wanted to cross , and ran back again , ‘
217913	218471	218490	218491	Mr Montague	521	’ tempting boys , with friendly words , to get up behind , and immediately afterwards cutting them down ; and the like flashes of a cheerful humour , which he would occasionally relieve by going round St. James ’s Square at a hand gallop , and coming slowly into Pall Mall by another entry , as if , in the interval , his pace had been a perfect crawl . It was not until these amusements had been very often repeated , and the apple - stall at the corner had sustained so many miraculous escapes as to appear impregnable , that Mr Bailey was summoned to the door of a certain house in Pall Mall , and turning short , obeyed the call and jumped out . It was not until he had held the bridle for some minutes longer , every jerk of Cauliflower ’s brother ’s head , and every twitch of Cauliflower ’s brother ’s nostril , taking him off his legs in the meanwhile , that two persons entered the vehicle , one of whom took the reins and drove rapidly off . Nor was it until Mr Bailey had run after it some hundreds of yards in vain , that he managed to lift his short leg into the iron step , and finally to get his boots upon the little footboard behind . Then , indeed , he became a sight to see ; and -- standing now on one foot and now upon the other , now trying to look round the cab on this side , now on that , and now endeavouring to peep over the top of it , as it went dashing in among the carts and coaches -- was from head to heel Newmarket . The appearance of Mr Bailey ’s governor as he drove along fully justified that enthusiastic youth ’s description of him to the wondering Poll . He had a world of jet - black shining hair upon his head , upon his cheeks , upon his chin , upon his upper lip . His clothes , symmetrically made , were of the newest fashion and the costliest kind . Flowers of gold and blue , and green and blushing red , were on his waistcoat ; precious chains and jewels sparkled on his breast ; his fingers , clogged with brilliant rings , were as unwieldly as summer flies but newly rescued from a honey - pot . The daylight mantled in his gleaming hat and boots as in a polished glass . And yet , though changed his name , and changed his outward surface , it was Tigg . Though turned and twisted upside down , and inside out , as great men have been sometimes known to be ; though no longer Montague Tigg , but Tigg Montague ; still it was Tigg ; the same Satanic , gallant , military Tigg . The brass was burnished , lacquered , newly stamped ; yet it was the true Tigg metal notwithstanding . Beside him sat a smiling gentleman , of less pretensions and of business looks , whom he addressed as David . Surely not the David of the -- how shall it be phrased?--the triumvirate of golden balls ? Not David , tapster at the Lombards ’

218493	218536	218574	218574	Montague	521	‘ the office being now established , is eight hundred pounds per annum , with his house - rent , coals , and candles free . His five - and - twenty shares he holds , of course . Is that enough ? ’
218566	218572	218574	218574	Montague	521	‘ If that ’s enough , ’

219286	219310	219324	219324	Tigg	261	‘ Hang it , let a man have some credit . Did n’t I say to you that I ’d saved a few pounds?-- ’
219311	219322	219324	219324	Tigg	261	‘ You said ! Did n’t I say to you , ’

219348	219377	219385	219386	Mr Tigg	261	‘ but that ’s not the idea . Who said , that if we put the money together we could furnish an office , and make a show ? ’
219378	219383	219385	219386	Mr Tigg	261	‘ And who said , ’
219388	219434	219344	219344	David	312	‘ that , provided we did it on a sufficiently large scale , we could furnish an office and make a show , without any money at all ? Be rational , and just , and calm , and tell me whose idea was that . ’
219435	219440	219344	219344	David	312	‘ Why , there , ’
219447	219480	219492	219492	Tigg	261	‘ you had the advantage of me , I admit . But I do n’t put myself on a level with you . I only want a little credit in the business . ’
219481	219490	219492	219492	Tigg	261	‘ All the credit you deserve to have , ’
219494	219557	219565	219566	his friend	9006	‘ The plain work of the company , David -- figures , books , circulars , advertisements , pen , ink , and paper , sealing - wax and wafers -- is admirably done by you . You are a first - rate groveller . I do n’t dispute it . But the ornamental department , David ; the inventive and poetical department-- ’
219558	219563	219565	219566	his friend	9006	‘ Is entirely yours , ’
219568	219612	219628	219628	Tigg	261	‘ No question of it . But with such a swell turnout as this , and all the handsome things you ’ve got about you , and the life you lead , I mean to say it ’s a precious comfortable department too . ’
219613	219626	219635	219635	David	312	‘ Does it gain the purpose ? Is it Anglo - Bengalee ? ’
219630	219633	219646	219646	Tigg	261	‘ Yes , ’
219637	219644	219653	219653	David	312	‘ Could you undertake it yourself ? ’
219648	219651	219662	219662	Tigg	261	‘ No , ’
219655	219660	219662	219662	Tigg	261	‘ Ha , ha ! ’

In like manner , but in a still more stentorian voice , he ushered the chairman through the public office , where some humble clients were transacting business , into an awful chamber , labelled Board - room ; the door of which sanctuary immediately closed , and screened the great capitalist from vulgar eyes . The board - room had a Turkey carpet in it , a sideboard , a portrait of Tigg Montague , Esquire , as chairman ; a very imposing chair of office , garnished with an ivory hammer and a little hand - bell ; and a long table , set out at intervals with sheets of blotting - paper , foolscap , clean pens , and inkstands . The chairman having taken his seat with great solemnity , the secretary supported him on his right hand , and the porter stood bolt upright behind them , forming a warm background of waistcoat . This was the board : everything else being a light - hearted little fiction . ‘
221192	221197	221198	221198	Sir	864	’ said Mr Tigg . ‘
221200	221205	221238	221242	The Chairman of the Board	13072	’ replied the porter . ‘
221223	221237	221316	221316	Jobling	526	’ Bullamy cleared his throat , and bustled out into the office , crying ‘
221259	221315	221344	221344	Jobling	526	’ He soon returned with the gentleman in question ; and at both openings of the board - room door -- at his coming in and at his going out -- simple clients were seen to stretch their necks and stand upon their toes , thirsting to catch the slightest glimpse of that mysterious chamber . ‘
221322	221327	221344	221344	Jobling	526	’ said Mr Tigg , ‘
221357	221358	221362	221362	you	526	’ ‘
221369	221414	221477	221478	Mr Montague	521	’ said the Medical Officer , throwing himself luxuriously into an easy - chair ( they were all easy - chairs in the board - room ) , and taking a handsome gold snuff - box from the pocket of his black satin waistcoat . ‘
221480	221537	221542	221542	myself	0	’ The Medical Officer ( he was the same medical officer who had followed poor old Anthony Chuzzlewit to the grave , and who had attended Mrs Gamp ’s patient at the Bull ) smiled in saying these words ; and casually added , as he brushed some grains of snuff from his shirt - frill , ‘
221553	221554	221568	221568	Sir	864	’ ‘
221557	221567	221568	221568	Sir	864	’ said the Chairman , ringing the little bell . ‘

221599	221671	221728	221729	the doctor	11836	’m quite ashamed . Ha , ha ! if I had been a sharp practitioner , Mr Montague , I should n’t have mentioned it without a fee ; for you may depend upon it , my dear sir , that if you do n’t make a point of taking lunch , you ’ll very soon come under my hands . Allow me to illustrate this . In Mr Crimple ’s leg-- ’
221715	221726	221728	221729	the doctor	11836	‘ In Mr Crimple ’s leg , you ’ll observe , ’
221743	221778	221791	221792	Mr Crimple	527	‘ where Mr Crimple ’s knee fits into the socket , here , there is -- that is to say , between the bone and the socket -- a certain quantity of animal oil . ’
221779	221789	221791	221792	Mr Crimple	527	‘ What do you pick MY leg out for ? ’
221805	221818	221830	221831	the doctor	11836	‘ It ’s the same with other legs , ai n’t it ? ’
221819	221828	221834	221834	his	11836	‘ Never you mind , my good sir , ’
221837	221852	221861	221861	David	312	‘ whether it is the same with other legs , or not the same . ’
221853	221859	221875	221876	the doctor	11836	‘ But I do mind , ’
221863	221873	221875	221876	the doctor	11836	‘ I take a particular case , Mr Montague , ’
221878	221987	222037	222038	the doctor	11836	‘ as illustrating my remark , you observe . In this portion of Mr Crimple ’s leg , sir , there is a certain amount of animal oil . In every one of Mr Crimple ’s joints , sir , there is more or less of the same deposit . Very good . If Mr Crimple neglects his meals , or fails to take his proper quantity of rest , that oil wanes , and becomes exhausted . What is the consequence ? Mr Crimple ’s bones sink down into their sockets , sir , and Mr Crimple becomes a weazen , puny , stunted , miserable man ! ’
222021	222035	222037	222038	the doctor	11836	‘ We know a few secrets of nature in our profession , sir , ’
222040	222128	222152	222153	the doctor	11836	‘ Of course we do . We study for that ; we pass the Hall and the College for that ; and we take our station in society BY that . It ’s extraordinary how little is known on these subjects generally . Where do you suppose , now’--the doctor closed one eye , as he leaned back smilingly in his chair , and formed a triangle with his hands , of which his two thumbs composed the base--‘where do you suppose Mr Crimple ’s stomach is ? ’
222145	222150	222152	222153	the doctor	11836	‘ Not at all , ’
222155	222170	222176	222176	I	0	‘ not at all . Quite a popular mistake ! My good sir , you ’re
222174	222175	222191	222191	I	0	’ ‘
222194	222198	222199	222199	You	11836	’ said Crimple . ‘
222204	222209	222217	222220	a patient of mine	5214	’ replied the doctor ; ‘
222223	222241	222368	222368	your	528	’ touching one of the many mourning rings upon his fingers , and slightly bowing his head , ‘
222365	222366	222368	222368	your	528	’ ‘
222372	222378	222380	222380	your	528	’ cried Bullamy , without . ‘
222390	222391	222380	222380	your	528	’ ‘
222394	222416	222451	222452	Mr Crimple	527	’ said the doctor , jocularly , as he rubbed his hands , and drew his chair nearer to the table . ‘
222454	222830	222451	222452	Mr Crimple	527	’ The resident Director acquiesced rather sulkily , as if the gratification of replenishing his stomach had been impaired by the unsettlement of his preconceived opinions in reference to its situation . But the appearance of the porter and under - porter with a tray covered with a snow - white cloth , which , being thrown back , displayed a pair of cold roast fowls , flanked by some potted meats and a cool salad , quickly restored his good humour . It was enhanced still further by the arrival of a bottle of excellent madeira , and another of champagne ; and he soon attacked the repast with an appetite scarcely inferior to that of the medical officer . The lunch was handsomely served , with a profusion of rich glass plate , and china ; which seemed to denote that eating and drinking on a showy scale formed no unimportant item in the business of the Anglo - Bengalee Directorship . As it proceeded , the Medical Officer grew more and more joyous and red - faced , insomuch that every mouthful he ate , and every drop of wine he swallowed , seemed to impart new lustre to his eyes , and to light up new sparks in his nose and forehead . In certain quarters of the City and its neighbourhood , Mr Jobling was , as we have already seen in some measure , a very popular character . He had a portentously sagacious chin , and a pompous voice , with a rich huskiness in some of its tones that went directly to the heart , like a ray of light shining through the ruddy medium of choice old burgundy . His neckerchief and shirt - frill were ever of the whitest , his clothes of the blackest and sleekest , his gold watch - chain of the heaviest , and his seals of the largest . His boots , which were always of the brightest , creaked as he walked . Perhaps he could shake his head , rub his hands , or warm himself before a fire , better than any man alive ; and he had a peculiar way of smacking his lips and saying , ‘
222833	222852	222875	222875	he	0	’ at intervals while patients detailed their symptoms , which inspired great confidence . It seemed to express , ‘
222857	222873	222896	222896	he	0	’re going to say better than you do ; but go on , go on . ’
222898	222903	222939	222944	the coldest of his male admirers	5228	‘ full of anecdote ; ’
222955	222995	223154	223155	the patient	8896	‘ that whatever Jobling ’s professional skill might be ( and it could not be denied that he had a very high reputation ) , he was one of the most comfortable fellows you ever saw in your life ! ’
223094	223152	223154	223155	the patient	8896	‘ Why , my dear sir , with regard to the Anglo - Bengalee , my information , you see , is limited ; very limited . I am the medical officer , in consideration of a certain monthly payment . The labourer is worthy of his hire ; BIS DAT QUI CITO DAT’--[‘classical scholar , Jobling ! ’
223157	223187	223201	223202	the patient	8896	‘ well - read man!’)--‘and I receive it regularly . Therefore I am bound , so far as my own knowledge goes , to speak well of the establishment . ’
223189	223199	223229	223230	the doctor	11836	‘ Nothing can be fairer than Jobling ’s conduct , ’
223214	223227	223229	223230	the doctor	11836	‘ If you put any question to me , my dear friend , ’
223232	223298	223315	223316	the patient	8896	‘ touching the responsibility or capital of the company , there I am at fault ; for I have no head for figures , and not being a shareholder , am delicate of showing any curiosity whatever on the subject . Delicacy -- your amiable lady will agree with me I am sure -- should be one of the first characteristics of a medical man . ’
223300	223313	223229	223230	the doctor	11836	‘ Nothing can be finer or more gentlemanly than Jobling ’s feeling , ’
223319	223340	223453	223453	him	5242	‘ Very good , my dear sir , so the matter stands . You do n’t know Mr Montague ? I ’m
223459	223471	223517	223517	Jobling	526	’ says the doctor , turning to the patient ’s wife , ‘
223514	223516	223517	223517	Jobling	526	’ [ ‘
223531	223536	223544	223544	I	0	’ thinks the patient ; ‘

223572	223593	223599	223599	Jobling	526	’ said Crimple , looking , when they had finished lunch , over some papers brought in by the porter . ‘

223605	223609	223599	223599	Jobling	526	’ said Tigg , ‘

223635	223640	223709	223710	the doctor	11836	’ said the doctor , ‘

223716	223752	223790	223791	the doctor	11836	‘ caution in behalf of other people . Whether I would repose confidence in this company myself , if I had not been paying money elsewhere for many years -- that ’s quite another question . ’
223783	223788	223790	223791	the doctor	11836	‘ Talking of wine , ’
223793	223837	223854	223854	Tigg	261	‘ reminds me of one of the finest glasses of light old port I ever drank in my life ; and that was at a funeral . You have not seen anything of -- of THAT party , Mr Montague , have you ? ’
223843	223852	223854	223854	Tigg	261	‘ He is not buried , I hope ? ’
223861	223874	223882	223883	the doctor	11836	‘ The honour of his company is not requested if he is . ’
223875	223880	223882	223883	the doctor	11836	‘ Ha , ha ! ’
223885	223901	223907	223907	Tigg	261	‘ No ; not quite . He was honourably connected with that very occasion though . ’
223902	223905	223914	223914	he	261	‘ Oh ! ’
223922	223934	223965	223966	the doctor	11836	‘ I recollect . No . He has not been here . ’
223955	223963	223981	223981	Tigg	261	‘ Talk of the what ’s his name-- ’
223969	223979	223995	223996	the doctor	11836	‘ And he ’s sure to appear , eh ? ’
223983	223993	223995	223996	the doctor	11836	‘ Why , no , Mr Montague , no , ’
223998	224018	224027	224027	Tigg	261	‘ We will not say that in the present case , for this gentleman is very far from it . ’
224019	224025	224027	224027	Tigg	261	‘ So much the better , ’
224029	224061	224070	224070	Jobling	526	‘ So much the more adaptable to the Anglo - Bengalee . Bullamy , clear the table and take the things out by the other door . Mr Crimple , business . ’
224062	224068	224081	224081	Tigg	261	‘ Shall I introduce him ? ’
224072	224079	224111	224111	Jobling	526	‘ I shall be eternally delighted , ’
224105	224109	224135	224135	he	11836	‘ Mr Montague , ’
224113	224134	224135	224135	he	11836	‘ Allow me . My friend Mr Chuzzlewit . My dear friend -- our chairman . Now do you know , ’
224150	224290	224392	224393	the doctor	11836	‘ that ’s a very singular instance of the force of example . It really is a very remarkable instance of the force of example . I say OUR chairman . Why do I say our chairman ? Because he is not MY chairman , you know . I have no connection with the company , farther than giving them , for a certain fee and reward , my poor opinion as a medical man , precisely as I may give it any day to Jack Noakes or Tom Styles . Then why do I say our chairman ? Simply because I hear the phrase constantly repeated about me . Such is the involuntary operation of the mental faculty in the imitative biped man . Mr Crimple , I believe you never take snuff ? Injudicious . You should . ’
224377	224390	224392	224393	the doctor	11836	‘ Now you two gentlemen have business to discuss , I know , ’
224395	224433	224486	224486	sir	864	‘ and your time is precious . So is mine ; for several lives are waiting for me in the next room , and I have a round of visits to make after -- after I have taken ‘
224488	224496	224664	224664	I	0	’ rapping his snuff - box solemnly , ‘
224515	224663	224664	224664	I	0	’ With these words Jobling bolted abruptly out of the room , and proceeded in his own official department , to impress the lives in waiting with a sense of his keen conscientiousness in the discharge of his duty , and the great difficulty of getting into the Anglo - Bengalee ; by feeling their pulses , looking at their tongues , listening at their ribs , poking them in the chest , and so forth ; though , if he did n’t well know beforehand that whatever kind of lives they were , the Anglo - Bengalee would accept them readily , he was far from being the Jobling that his friend considered him ; and was not the original Jobling , but a spurious imitation . Mr Crimple also departed on the business of the morning ; and Jonas Chuzzlewit and Tigg were left alone . ‘
224670	224686	224688	224688	you	9316	’ said Tigg , drawing his chair towards Jonas with a winning ease of manner , ‘
224692	224693	224698	224698	he	9316	’ ‘
224706	224712	224747	224747	I	0	’ cried Jonas , interrupting . ‘
224755	224805	224840	224840	you	5276	’ Jonas said this offensively enough ; for over and above the habitual distrust of his character , it was in his nature to seek to revenge himself on the fine clothes and the fine furniture , in exact proportion as he had been unable to withstand their influence . ‘
224843	224847	224840	224840	you	5276	’ said Jonas . ‘
224852	224862	224954	224954	you	9315	’ cried Tigg , clapping him on the shoulder , ‘
224955	224961	225128	225128	You	5282	’re in our secret . You ’re
224986	225127	225147	225147	I	0	’ It was remarked , on the first introduction of Mr Jonas into these pages , that there is a simplicity of cunning no less than a simplicity of innocence , and that in all matters involving a faith in knavery , he was the most credulous of men . If Mr Tigg had preferred any claim to high and honourable dealing , Jonas would have suspected him though he had been a very model of probity ; but when he gave utterance to Jonas ’s own thoughts of everything and everybody , Jonas began to feel that he was a pleasant fellow , and one to be talked to freely . He changed his position in the chair , not for a less awkward , but for a more boastful attitude ; and smiling in his miserable conceit rejoined : ‘
225151	225152	225147	225147	I	0	’ ‘
225157	225170	225184	225184	I	0	’ said Tigg , nodding confidentially , and showing his white teeth ; ‘
225187	225218	225147	225147	I	0	’ Jonas assented , and said after a short silence , first spreading out his legs , and sticking one arm akimbo to show how perfectly at home he was , ‘
225222	225223	225147	225147	I	0	’ ‘
225231	225239	225147	225147	I	0	’ interposed Tigg , with another grin . ‘
225246	225256	225147	225147	I	0	’ Greatly charmed by this , Jonas began again . ‘
225265	225266	225147	225147	I	0	’ ‘
225269	225273	225147	225147	I	0	’ muttered Tigg . ‘
225277	225278	225344	225344	he	0	’ ‘
225303	225342	225376	225376	Tigg	261	‘ em -- once had , I mean . They started objections they had no right to start , and put questions they had no right to put , and carried things much too high for my taste . ’
225390	225397	225405	225405	Jonas	219	‘ Take a glass of wine . ’
225398	225403	225405	225405	Jonas	219	‘ No , no , ’
225415	225441	225455	225455	Tigg	261	‘ none of that , thankee . No wine over business . All very well for you , but it would n’t do for me . ’
225442	225453	225474	225474	Jonas	219	‘ What an old hand you are , Mr Chuzzlewit ! ’
225486	225488	225476	225476	his	219	‘ You ’re
225492	225499	225548	225548	I	0	’ And then resumed , jocosely : ‘
225549	225580	225596	225596	Tigg	261	’m thinking of insuring her life . It is but fair , you know , that a man should secure some consolation in case of meeting with such a loss . ’
225581	225594	225596	225596	Tigg	261	‘ If anything can console him under such heart - breaking circumstances , ’
225606	225609	225596	225596	Tigg	261	‘ Exactly , ’
225613	225685	225693	225693	Tigg	261	‘ if anything can . Now , supposing I did it here , I should do it cheap , I know , and easy , without bothering her about it ; which I ’d much rather not do , for it ’s just in a woman ’s way to take it into her head , if you talk to her about such things , that she ’s going to die directly . ’
225686	225691	225693	225693	Tigg	261	‘ So it is , ’
225704	225706	225710	225716	Sweet , silly , fluttering little simpletons	5291	‘ You ’re

225722	225726	225710	225716	Sweet , silly , fluttering little simpletons	5291	’ said Jonas , ‘

225780	225790	225710	225716	Sweet , silly , fluttering little simpletons	5291	’ cried Tigg , holding up his jewelled hand . ‘
225801	225802	225710	225716	Sweet , silly , fluttering little simpletons	5291	’ ‘
225811	225815	225710	225716	Sweet , silly , fluttering little simpletons	5291	’ said Jonas . ‘

225842	225854	225869	225872	paid - up capitals	5295	’ said Tigg , referring to some papers on the table , ‘

225898	225917	225980	225980	You	0	’ He turned the papers down again , and moving nearer to him , said in his ear : ‘
225932	225979	225993	225993	You	0	’ It was not much in Jonas ’s way to look straight at anybody ; but thus requested , he made shift to take a tolerable survey of the chairman ’s features . The chairman fell back a little , to give him the better opportunity . ‘
225984	225992	225996	225996	You	0	’ he inquired , elevating his eyebrows . ‘
226002	226003	226008	226008	I	0	’ ‘

226127	226131	226149	226149	he	5300	’ said Jonas . ‘

226250	226262	226263	226263	he	521	‘ Do you find me at all changed since that time ? ’
226266	226270	226271	226271	Jonas	219	‘ Speak plainly . ’

226327	226340	226310	226311	Mr Montague	521	‘ Neat ; perhaps dashing . Do you know whose it is ? ’
226341	226344	226310	226311	Mr Montague	521	‘ No . ’
226345	226354	226367	226367	Jonas	219	‘ Mine . Do you like this room ? ’
226355	226365	226367	226367	Jonas	219	‘ It must have cost a lot of money , ’

226445	226448	226473	226474	his companion	8974	‘ Very , ’
226465	226471	226473	226474	his companion	8974	‘ There are printed calculations , ’

227201	227230	227265	227265	Jonas	219	‘ we grant annuities on the very lowest and most advantageous terms known in the money market ; and the old ladies and gentlemen down in the country buy ‘

227255	227263	227279	227280	Tigg Montague	519	‘ But there ’s responsibility in that , ’

227350	227379	227392	227392	Montague	519	‘ It ’s all very well , while the office is young , but when the policies begin to die -- that ’s what I am thinking of . ’

227394	227420	227429	227429	Jonas	219	‘ to show you how correct your judgment is , we had a couple of unlucky deaths that brought us down to a grand piano . ’

227431	227441	227553	227553	he	219	‘ I give you my sacred word of honour , ’
227446	227552	227553	227553	he	219	‘ that I raised money on every other individual piece of property , and was left alone in the world with a grand piano . And it was an upright - grand too , so that I could n’t even sit upon it . But , my dear fellow , we got over it . We granted a great many new policies that week ( liberal allowance to solicitors , by the bye ) , and got over it in no time . Whenever they should chance to fall in heavily , as you very justly observe they may , one of these days ; then-- ’

227804	227824	227826	227826	Nadgett	535	’ Mr Montague being left alone , pondered for some moments , and then said , raising his voice : ‘

227840	228061	228382	228382	Montague	521	’ And he promptly entered ; shutting the board - room door after him , as carefully as if he were about to plot a murder . He was the man at a pound a week who made the inquiries . It was no virtue or merit in Nadgett that he transacted all his Anglo - Bengalee business secretly and in the closest confidence ; for he was born to be a secret . He was a short , dried - up , withered old man , who seemed to have secreted his very blood ; for nobody would have given him credit for the possession of six ounces of it in his whole body . How he lived was a secret ; where he lived was a secret ; and even what he was , was a secret . In his musty old pocket - book he carried contradictory cards , in some of which he called himself a coal - merchant , in others a wine - merchant , in others a commission - agent , in others a collector , in others an accountant ; as if he really did n’t know the secret himself . He was always keeping appointments in the City , and the other man never seemed to come . He would sit on ‘
228376	228380	228382	228382	Montague	521	‘ Mr Nadgett , ’
228406	228446	228808	228808	Jonas	219	‘ any information about this name , I shall be glad to have myself . Do n’t you mind what it is . Any you can scrape together , bring me . Bring it to me , Mr Nadgett . ’
228759	228806	229045	229045	He	329	‘ To make a swingeing profit , have a lot of chaps to order about , and get into regular good society by one and the same means , and them so easy to one ’s hand , ai n’t such a bad look - out , ’
229065	229071	229089	229089	Bailey	329	‘ Mr Montague at home ? ’
229072	229087	229089	229089	Bailey	329	‘ I should hope he wos at home , and waiting dinner , too , ’

229561	229580	229584	229585	Lord Nobley	538	’ said Wolf , folding his arms and resuming a conversation which the arrival of Jonas had interrupted . ‘

Jonas repaired to the dining room , along with his distinguished host , and took his seat at the board between that individual and his friend the doctor . The rest fell into their places like men who were well accustomed to the house ; and dinner was done full justice to , by all parties . It was a good a one as money ( or credit , no matter which ) could produce . The dishes , wines , and fruits were of the choicest kind . Everything was elegantly served . The plate was gorgeous . Mr Jonas was in the midst of a calculation of the value of this item alone , when his host disturbed him . ‘

230376	230394	230395	230395	Jonas	219	‘ But I like this sort of thing . It ’s the way I spend my money . ’

Pip , in a natural spirit of emulation , then related some instances of his own depth ; and Wolf not to be left behind - hand , recited the leading points of one or two vastly humorous articles he was then preparing . These lucubrations being of what he called ‘
230743	230760	230648	230648	Pip	537	’ were highly approved ; and all the company agreed that they were full of point . ‘
230770	230776	230936	230937	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ Jobling whispered to Jonas ; ‘
230830	230935	230949	230949	Wolf	536	’ It is so pleasant to find real merit appreciated , whatever its particular walk in life may be , that the general harmony of the company was doubtless much promoted by their knowing that the two men of the world were held in great esteem by the upper classes of society , and by the gallant defenders of their country in the army and navy , but particularly the former . The least of their stories had a colonel in it ; lords were as plentiful as oaths ; and even the Blood Royal ran in the muddy channel of their personal recollections . ‘

231011	231109	231120	231120	Pip	537	‘ Oh , yes ; he took my paper regularly for many years . Do you know he said some good things now and then ? He asked a certain Viscount , who ’s a friend of mine -- Pip knows him--“What ’s the editor ’s name , what ’s the editor ’s name ? ” “ Wolf . ” “ Wolf , eh ? Sharp biter , Wolf . We must keep the Wolf from the door , as the proverb says . ” It was very well . And being complimentary , I printed it . ’

231135	231254	231394	231394	Pip	537	‘ The Viscount ’s the boy ! He came into our place one night to take Her home ; rather slued , but not much ; and said , “ Where ’s Pip ? I want to see Pip . Produce Pip!”--“What ’s the row , my lord?”--“Shakspeare ’s an infernal humbug , Pip ! What ’s the good of Shakspeare , Pip ? I never read him . What the devil is it all about , Pip ? There ’s a lot of feet in Shakspeare ’s verse , but there an’t any legs worth mentioning in Shakspeare ’s plays , are there , Pip ? Juliet , Desdemona , Lady Macbeth , and all the rest of ‘

232874	232951	232952	232952	You	5466	’ He was so far recovered as to be able to respond to this appeal , and to come stumbling out of the coach in a heap , to the great hazard of Mr Bailey ’s person . When he got upon the pavement , Mr Bailey first butted at him in front , and then dexterously propped him up behind ; and having steadied him by these means , he assisted him into the house . ‘

I hate myself , for having , been fool enough to strap a pack upon my back for the pleasure of treading on it whenever I choose . Why , things have opened to me , now , so that I might marry almost where I liked . But I would n’t ; I ’d keep single . I ought to be single , among the friends I know . Instead of that , here I am , tied like a log to you . Pah ! Why do you show your pale face when I come home ? Am I never to forget you ? ’

She went up to him , as it seemed , and spoke lovingly ; saying that she would defer to him in everything and would consult his wishes and obey them , and they might be very happy if he would be gentle with her . He answered with an imprecation , and-- Not with a blow ? Yes . Stern truth against the base - souled villain ; with a blow . No angry cries ; no loud reproaches . Even her weeping and her sobs were stifled by her clinging round him . She only said , repeating it in agony of heart , how could he , could he , could he -- and lost utterance in tears . Oh woman , God beloved in old Jerusalem ! The best among us need deal lightly with thy faults , if only for the punishment thy nature will endure , in bearing heavy evidence against us , on the Day of Judgment ! CHAPTER TWENTY - NINE IN WHICH SOME PEOPLE ARE PRECOCIOUS , OTHERS PROFESSIONAL , AND OTHERS MYSTERIOUS ; ALL IN THEIR SEVERAL WAYS It may have been the restless remembrance of what he had seen and heard overnight , or it may have been no deeper mental operation than the discovery that he had nothing to do , which caused Mr Bailey , on the following afternoon , to feel particularly disposed for agreeable society , and prompted him to pay a visit to his friend Poll Sweedlepipe . On the little bell giving clamorous notice of a visitor ’s approach ( for Mr Bailey came in at the door with a lunge , to get as much sound out of the bell as possible ) , Poll Sweedlepipe desisted from the contemplation of a favourite owl , and gave his young friend hearty welcome . ‘

234464	234468	234473	234473	He	5487	’ thought Poll , ‘

234488	234493	234512	234514	The very owl	5488	’ said Mr Bailey ; ‘

234522	234526	234588	234588	Poll	510	’ thought Poll . ‘
234540	234587	234588	234588	Poll	510	’ He happened to have been sharpening his razors , which were lying open in a row , while a huge strop dangled from the wall . Glancing at these preparations , Mr Bailey stroked his chin , and a thought appeared to occur to him . ‘
234590	234594	234721	234721	Poll	510	’ he said , ‘
234624	234715	234721	234721	Poll	510	’ The barber stood aghast ; but Mr Bailey divested himself of his neck - cloth , and sat down in the easy shaving chair with all the dignity and confidence in life . There was no resisting his manner . The evidence of sight and touch became as nothing . His chin was as smooth as a new - laid egg or a scraped Dutch cheese ; but Poll Sweedlepipe would n’t have ventured to deny , on affidavit , that he had the beard of a Jewish rabbi . ‘
234728	234744	234766	234769	The meek little barber	5489	’ said Mr Bailey , screwing up his face for the reception of the lather . ‘
234762	234765	234859	234859	he	5489	‘ em . ’
234852	234858	234864	234865	Mr Bailey	329	‘ Go in and win , ’
234874	234891	234942	234942	he	329	‘ Gently over the stones , Poll . Go a tip - toe over the pimples ! ’
234947	234957	235005	235005	He	329	‘ Reether redder than I could wish , Poll . ’
234987	235004	235099	235099	he	329	‘ that arter late hours nothing freshened up a man so much as a easy shave . ’
235095	235098	235099	235099	he	329	‘ Hallo ! ’

235183	235222	235170	235170	I	0	’ Mr Bailey regarded this as a delicate confession of her attachment , and a hint that no pecuniary gain could recompense her for its being rendered hopeless . He felt flattered . Disinterested affection is always flattering . ‘

235328	235333	235334	235335	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Talk of constitooshun ! ’
235338	235415	235529	235530	Mrs Harris	422	‘ A person ’s constitooshun need be made of bricks to stand it . Mrs Harris jestly says to me , but t’other day , “ Oh !

235443	235488	235529	235530	Mrs Harris	422	’ The barber gave a soft murmur , as much as to say that Mrs Harris ’s remark , though perhaps not quite so intelligible as could be desired from such an authority , did equal honour to her head and to her heart . ‘
235492	235497	235777	235778	Mrs Gamp	223	’ continued Mrs Gamp , ‘

Often and often have I heerd him say , ” I says to Mrs Harris , meaning Mr Gill , “ that he would back his wife agen Moore ’s almanack , to name the very day and hour , for ninepence farden . IS it likely , ma’am , ” I says , “ as she will fail this once ? ” Says Mrs Harris “ No , ma’am , not in the course of natur . But , ” she says , the tears a - fillin in her eyes , “ you knows much betterer than me , with your experienge , how little puts us out . A Punch ’s show , ” she says , “ a chimbley sweep , a newfundlan dog , or a drunkin man a - comin round the corner sharp may do it . ” So it may , Mr Sweedlepipes , ’

235951	235969	235970	235971	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Into Har’fordshire , which is his native air . But native airs nor native graces neither , ’
235974	235981	235990	235992	the wistful barber	5509	‘ wo n’t bring HIM round . ’

236071	236074	236091	236092	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Lor ! ’
236075	236089	236091	236092	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ No . You may make yourself as light as any gash balloon , ’
236094	236100	236057	236058	the barber	5034	‘ But talk , when you ’re
236108	236126	236137	236137	Poll	510	’re in your sleep , of certain things ; and you ’ll be heavy in your mind . ’
236127	236135	236152	236153	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Of what kind of things now ? ’
236148	236151	236152	236153	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Ghosts ? ’

236317	236377	236394	236395	all three	2735	’ During the progress of the foregoing remarks , which Mrs Gamp had addressed exclusively to the barber , Mr Bailey had been tying his cravat , getting on his coat , and making hideous faces at himself in the glass . Being now personally addressed by Mrs Gamp , he turned round , and mingled in the conversation . ‘
236399	236404	236406	236407	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ said Mrs Gamp , ‘

236575	236584	236585	236585	She	5526	’ he checked himself ; adding , only , ‘

236600	236606	236635	236635	sir	864	’ said Mrs Gamp sharply , ‘

236643	236647	236653	236653	I	0	’ answered Bailey , ‘

236654	236659	236682	236682	Poll	510	’m glad on it , ’
236671	236680	236682	236682	Poll	510	‘ They have n’t been married so long , ’
236688	236699	236705	236706	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ that they need be anything but pleasant yet awhile . ’
236700	236703	236719	236720	the barber	5034	‘ No , ’
236714	236717	236719	236720	the barber	5034	‘ Especially , ’
236722	236735	236749	236750	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ when the gentleman bears such a character as you gave him . ’
236736	236747	236749	236750	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ I speak ; as I find , Mr Sweedlepipes , ’
236752	236797	236807	236808	Poll Sweedlepipe	510	‘ Forbid it should be otherways ! But we never knows wot ’s hidden in each other ’s hearts ; and if we had glass winders there , we ’d need keep the shetters up , some on us , I do assure you ! ’
236798	236806	236816	236817	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ But you do n’t mean to say-- ’
236811	236814	236855	236857	the good woman	9070	‘ No , ’
236824	236853	236855	236857	the good woman	9070	‘ I do n’t . Do n’t think I do . The torters of the Imposition should n’t make me own I did . All I says is , ’
236867	236884	236862	236862	her	9070	‘ that the Bull ’s a - waitin , and the precious moments is a - flyin ’
236887	237062	237077	237077	We	5531	’ The little barber having in his eager curiosity a great desire to see Mrs Gamp ’s patient , proposed to Mr Bailey that they should accompany her to the Bull , and witness the departure of the coach . That young gentleman assenting , they all went out together . Arriving at the tavern , Mrs Gamp ( who was full - dressed for the journey , in her latest suit of mourning ) left her friends to entertain themselves in the yard , while she ascended to the sick room , where her fellow - labourer Mrs Prig was dressing the invalid . He was so wasted , that it seemed as if his bones would rattle when they moved him . His cheeks were sunken , and his eyes unnaturally large . He lay back in the easy - chair like one more dead than living ; and rolled his languid eyes towards the door when Mrs Gamp appeared , as painfully as if their weight alone were burdensome to move . ‘
237071	237076	237083	237083	We	5531	’ Mrs Gamp observed . ‘
237081	237082	237083	237083	We	5531	’ ‘
237094	237106	237160	237162	the unfortunate patient	5532	’ returned Mrs Prig , a little chafed in her temper . ‘
237119	237148	237160	237162	the unfortunate patient	5532	’re as cross as two sticks . I never see sich a man . He would n’t have been washed , if he ’d had his own way . ’
237149	237158	237160	237162	the unfortunate patient	5532	‘ She put the soap in my mouth , ’
237165	237174	237160	237162	the unfortunate patient	5532	‘ Could n’t you keep it shut then ? ’
237179	237230	237176	237177	Mrs Prig	224	‘ Who do you think ’s to wash one feater , and miss another , and wear one ’s eyes out with all manner of fine work of that description , for half - a - crown a day ! If you wants to be tittivated , you must pay accordin ’

237238	237243	237236	237236	me	0	’ cried the patient , ‘

237253	237258	237276	237276	I	0	’ said Mrs Prig , ‘

237296	237301	237345	237345	I	0	’ Mrs Gamp observed , ‘
237320	237344	237416	237416	she	5536	’ Here Mrs Prig seized the patient by the chin , and began to rasp his unhappy head with a hair - brush . ‘
237355	237415	237416	237416	she	5536	’ she observed , stopping to look at him . It was just possible that he did n’t for the brush was a specimen of the hardest kind of instrument producible by modern art ; and his very eyelids were red with the friction . Mrs Prig was gratified to observe the correctness of her supposition , and said triumphantly ‘
237421	237510	237511	237511	I	0	’ When his hair was smoothed down comfortably into his eyes , Mrs Prig and Mrs Gamp put on his neckerchief ; adjusting his shirt collar with great nicety , so that the starched points should also invade those organs , and afflict them with an artificial ophthalmia . His waistcoat and coat were next arranged ; and as every button was wrenched into a wrong button - hole , and the order of his boots was reversed , he presented on the whole rather a melancholy appearance . ‘
237519	237526	237511	237511	I	0	’ said the poor weak invalid . ‘
237540	237579	237588	237589	Mrs Gamp	223	’m all on one side ; and you ’ve made one of my legs shorter than the other . There ’s a bottle in my pocket too . What do you make me sit upon a bottle for ? ’
237580	237586	237588	237589	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Deuce take the man ! ’
237595	237662	237588	237589	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ If he ai n’t been and got my night - bottle here . I made a little cupboard of his coat when it hung behind the door , and quite forgot it , Betsey . You ’ll find a ingun or two , and a little tea and sugar in his t’other pocket , my dear , if you ’ll just be good enough to take ‘
237666	237739	237588	237589	Mrs Gamp	223	’ Betsey produced the property in question , together with some other articles of general chandlery ; and Mrs Gamp transferred them to her own pocket , which was a species of nankeen pannier . Refreshment then arrived in the form of chops and strong ale for the ladies , and a basin of beef - tea for the patient ; which refection was barely at an end when John Westlock appeared . ‘
237744	237753	237760	237760	you	5538	’ cried John , sitting down beside him . ‘
237763	237764	237809	237810	Mrs Gamp	223	’ ‘
237772	237773	237809	237810	Mrs Gamp	223	’ ‘
237795	237799	237809	237810	Mrs Gamp	223	’ said John , ‘
237812	237828	237841	237842	Mr Lewsome	560	’ he added , laughing , as he kindly arranged the sick man ’s garments , ‘
237839	237840	237853	237853	sir	864	’ ‘
237855	237862	237919	237920	Mr Westlock	247	’ Mrs Gamp replied with dignity ; ‘
237881	237918	237930	237930	I	0	’ John at that moment was standing close in front of the sick man , in the act of releasing him from the torture of the collars before mentioned , when he said in a whisper : ‘
237958	237988	238028	238028	you	247	’ Quick in all his motions , John was turning round to desire the women to leave the room ; when the sick man held him by the sleeve . ‘
238025	238026	238028	238028	you	247	’ ‘
238030	238034	238037	238037	Lewsome	560	’ cried John . ‘
238043	238044	238210	238210	They	5545	’ ‘
238103	238189	238202	238202	He	5544	’ At first , John gazed at him in great surprise ; but remembering how very much reduced he was , and how recently his brain had been on fire with fever , believed that he was labouring under some imaginary horror or despondent fancy . For farther information on this point , he took an opportunity of drawing Mrs Gamp aside , while Betsey Prig was wrapping him in cloaks and shawls , and asked her whether he was quite collected in his mind . ‘
238196	238201	238248	238248	you	560	’ said Mrs Gamp . ‘
238264	238578	238248	238248	you	560	’ This almost confirmed John in his suspicion ; so , not taking what had passed into any serious account , he resumed his former cheerful manner , and assisted by Mrs Gamp and Betsey Prig , conducted Lewsome downstairs to the coach ; just then upon the point of starting . Poll Sweedlepipe was at the door with his arms tight folded and his eyes wide open , and looked on with absorbing interest , while the sick man was slowly moved into the vehicle . His bony hands and haggard face impressed Poll wonderfully ; and he informed Mr Bailey in confidence , that he would n’t have missed seeing him for a pound . Mr Bailey , who was of a different constitution , remarked that he would have stayed away for five shillings . It was a troublesome matter to adjust Mrs Gamp ’s luggage to her satisfaction ; for every package belonging to that lady had the inconvenient property of requiring to be put in a boot by itself , and to have no other luggage near it , on pain of actions at law for heavy damages against the proprietors of the coach . The umbrella with the circular patch was particularly hard to be got rid of , and several times thrust out its battered brass nozzle from improper crevices and chinks , to the great terror of the other passengers . Indeed , in her intense anxiety to find a haven of refuge for this chattel , Mrs Gamp so often moved it , in the course of five minutes , that it seemed not one umbrella but fifty . At length it was lost , or said to be ; and for the next five minutes she was face to face with the coachman , go wherever he might , protesting that it should be ‘
238582	238648	238740	238741	Mrs Prig	224	’ though she took the question to the House of Commons . At last , her bundle , and her pattens , and her basket , and everything else , being disposed of , she took a friendly leave of Poll and Mr Bailey , dropped a curtsey to John Westlock , and parted as from a cherished member of the sisterhood with Betsey Prig . ‘
238659	238664	238740	238741	Mrs Prig	224	’ Mrs Gamp observed , ‘
238696	238727	238740	238741	Mrs Prig	224	’ be at a large family ’s , where they all takes it reg’lar , one from another , turn and turn about , and has it business - like . ’
238728	238738	238740	238741	Mrs Prig	224	‘ I do n’t care how soon it is , ’
238743	238751	238794	238795	the gentleman	977	‘ nor how many weeks it lasts . ’
238784	238792	238794	238795	the gentleman	977	‘ Take care , take care here ! ’
238797	238810	238819	238820	the nurse	5087	‘ Halloo ! My dear ! Why , it ’s Mrs Gamp ! ’
238811	238817	238819	238820	the nurse	5087	‘ What , Mr Mould ! ’
238822	238838	238794	238795	the gentleman	977	‘ And Mrs Mould ! who would have thought as we should ever have a meetin ’
238842	238845	238857	238857	Mould	420	’m sure ! ’
238846	238855	238857	238857	Mould	420	‘ Going out of town , Mrs Gamp ? ’
238859	238868	238878	238879	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ That ’s unusual , is n’t it ? ’
238869	238876	238896	238896	she	223	‘ It IS unusual , sir , ’
238881	238895	238896	238896	she	223	‘ But only for a day or two at most . The gent , ’
238899	238905	238915	238915	Mould	420	‘ as I spoke about . ’
238906	238913	238915	238915	Mould	420	‘ What , in the coach ! ’
238917	238954	238978	238978	Mould	420	‘ The one you thought of recommending ? Very odd . My dear , this will interest you . The gentleman that Mrs Gamp thought likely to suit us is in the coach , my love . ’
238961	238976	238978	238978	Mould	420	‘ Here , my dear . You can stand upon the door - step , ’
238980	239017	239024	239025	Mrs Mould	496	‘ and take a look at him . Ha ! There he is . Where ’s my glass ? Oh ! all right . I ’ve got it . Do you see him , my dear ? ’
239018	239022	239044	239044	Mould	420	‘ Quite plain , ’
239027	239042	239044	239044	Mould	420	‘ Upon my life , you know , this is a very singular circumstance , ’
239049	239107	239126	239126	Mould	420	‘ This is the sort of thing , my dear , I would n’t have missed on any account . It tickles one . It ’s interesting . It ’s almost a little play , you know . Ah ! There he is ! To be sure . Looks poorly , Mrs M. , do n’t he ? ’
239112	239124	239126	239126	Mould	420	‘ He ’s coming our way , perhaps , after all , ’
239128	239157	239171	239171	He	5559	‘ Who knows ! I feel as if I ought to show him some little attention , really . He do n’t seem a stranger to me . I ’m
239169	239170	239171	239171	He	5559	’ ‘
239178	239183	239185	239185	I	0	’ said Mrs Mould . ‘
239188	239192	239280	239280	your	8944	’ cried Mould . ‘
239288	239294	239302	239302	He	5559	’ Mrs Mould did so . ‘
239297	239301	239324	239325	Mrs Gamp	223	’ said Mould . ‘
239327	239332	239941	239941	Cherry	241	’ waving his hand . ‘
239341	239940	239941	239941	Cherry	241	’ So he did ; for the coach rolled off as the words were spoken . Mr and Mrs Mould , in high good humour , went their merry way . Mr Bailey retired with Poll Sweedlepipe as soon as possible ; but some little time elapsed before he could remove his friend from the ground , owing to the impression wrought upon the barber ’s nerves by Mrs Prig , whom he pronounced , in admiration of her beard , to be a woman of transcendent charms . When the light cloud of bustle hanging round the coach was thus dispersed , Nadgett was seen in the darkest box of the Bull coffee - room , looking wistfully up at the clock -- as if the man who never appeared were a little behind his time . CHAPTER THIRTY PROVES THAT CHANGES MAY BE RUNG IN THE BEST - REGULATED FAMILIES , AND THAT MR PECKNIFF WAS A SPECIAL HAND AT A TRIPLE - BOB - MAJOR As the surgeon ’s first care after amputating a limb , is to take up the arteries the cruel knife has severed , so it is the duty of this history , which in its remorseless course has cut from the Pecksniffian trunk its right arm , Mercy , to look to the parent stem , and see how in all its various ramifications it got on without her . And first of Mr Pecksniff it may be observed , that having provided for his youngest daughter that choicest of blessings , a tender and indulgent husband ; and having gratified the dearest wish of his parental heart by establishing her in life so happily ; he renewed his youth , and spreading the plumage of his own bright conscience , felt himself equal to all kinds of flights . It is customary with fathers in stage - plays , after giving their daughters to the men of their hearts , to congratulate themselves on having no other business on their hands but to die immediately ; though it is rarely found that they are in a hurry to do it . Mr Pecksniff , being a father of a more sage and practical class , appeared to think that his immediate business was to live ; and having deprived himself of one comfort , to surround himself with others . But however much inclined the good man was to be jocose and playful , and in the garden of his fancy to disport himself ( if one may say so ) like an architectural kitten , he had one impediment constantly opposed to him . The gentle Cherry , stung by a sense of slight and injury , which far from softening down or wearing out , rankled and festered in her heart -- the gentle Cherry was in flat rebellion . She waged fierce war against her dear papa , she led her parent what is usually called , for want of a better figure of speech , the life of a dog . But never did that dog live , in kennel , stable - yard , or house , whose life was half as hard as Mr Pecksniff ’s with his gentle child . The father and daughter were sitting at their breakfast . Tom had retired , and they were alone . Mr Pecksniff frowned at first ; but having cleared his brow , looked stealthily at his child . Her nose was very red indeed , and screwed up tight , with hostile preparation . ‘
239943	239948	239941	239941	Cherry	241	’ cried Mr Pecksniff , ‘
239963	239983	239986	239986	Pa	242	’ Miss Pecksniff ’s answer was scarcely a response to this gush of affection , for it was simply , ‘
239988	239989	239986	239986	Pa	242	’ ‘
239992	240003	240015	240016	his daughter	903	’ repeated Mr Pecksniff , in a tone of anguish . ‘
240006	240013	240015	240016	his daughter	903	‘ tis too late , Pa , ’
240019	240039	240047	240048	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ to talk to me like this . I know what it means , and what its value is . ’
240040	240045	240047	240048	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ This is hard ! ’
240056	240090	240104	240104	Cherry	241	‘ This is very hard ! She is my child . I carried her in my arms when she wore shapeless worsted shoes -- I might say , mufflers -- many years ago ! ’
240091	240102	240104	240104	Cherry	241	‘ You need n’t taunt me with that , Pa , ’
240111	240133	240149	240150	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ I am not so many years older than my sister , either , though she IS married to your friend ! ’
240134	240147	240153	240153	his	415	‘ Ah , human nature , human nature ! Poor human nature ! ’
240168	240187	240197	240197	Cherry	241	‘ To think that this discord should arise from such a cause ! oh dear , oh dear ! ’
240188	240195	240197	240197	Cherry	241	‘ From such a cause indeed ! ’
240199	240219	240258	240258	he	415	‘ State the real cause , Pa , or I ’ll state it myself . Mind ! I will ! ’
240261	240300	240306	240306	Cherry	241	‘ You will ! you have . You did yesterday . You do always . You have no decency ; you make no secret of your temper ; you have exposed yourself to Mr Chuzzlewit a hundred times . ’
240301	240304	240306	240306	Cherry	241	‘ Myself ! ’
240313	240323	240333	240334	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Oh indeed ! I do n’t mind that . ’
240324	240331	240358	240359	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Me , too , then , ’
240344	240356	240362	240362	his	415	‘ And since we have come to an explanation , Charity , ’
240366	240394	240402	240402	Charity	241	‘ let me tell you that I wo n’t allow it . None of your nonsense , Miss ! I wo n’t permit it to be done . ’
240395	240400	240413	240413	her	241	‘ I shall do , ’
240420	240464	240466	240466	she	241	‘ I shall do , Pa , what I please and what I have done . I am not going to be crushed in everything , depend upon it . I ’ve been more shamefully used than anybody ever was in this world , ’
240473	240500	240582	240582	he	415	‘ and may expect the worse treatment from you , I know . But I do n’t care for that . No , I do n’t ! ’
240569	240576	240582	240582	he	415	‘ I ’ll do it again ! ’
240591	240641	240669	240669	Cherry	241	‘ if you dare to talk in that loud manner . How do you mean about being shamefully used ? If Mr Jonas chose your sister in preference to you , who could help it , I should wish to know ? What have I to do with it ? ’
240642	240667	240669	240669	Cherry	241	‘ Was n’t I made a convenience of ? Were n’t my feelings trifled with ? Did n’t he address himself to me first ? ’
240675	240690	240702	240703	her parent	8905	‘ and oh , good gracious , that I should live to be shook ! ’
240691	240700	240702	240703	her parent	8905	‘ You ’ll live to be shaken again , ’
240705	240751	240761	240761	Cherry	241	‘ if you drive me to that means of maintaining the decorum of this humble roof . You surprise me . I wonder you have not more spirit . If Mr Jonas did n’t care for you , how could you wish to have him ? ’
240752	240759	240761	240761	Cherry	241	‘ I wish to have him ! ’
240763	240772	240788	240789	her father	8909	‘ I wish to have him , Pa ! ’
240773	240786	240788	240789	her father	8909	‘ Then what are you making all this piece of work for , ’
240791	240801	240812	240812	Cherry	241	‘ if you did n’t wish to have him ? ’
240802	240810	240837	240837	Cherry	241	‘ Because I was treated with duplicity , ’
240814	240835	240837	240837	Cherry	241	‘ and because my own sister and my own father conspired against me . I am not angry with HER , ’
240846	240852	240869	240870	that Wretch	5573	‘ I pity her . I ’m

240891	240900	240920	240920	Pa	242	’ said Mr Pecksniff , with returning resignation ; ‘
240914	240915	240920	240920	Pa	242	’ ‘
240922	240926	241005	241005	she	5574	’ said Charity . ‘
240942	241003	241047	241047	he	415	’re not agreed . I wo n’t submit to it . It ’s better you should know that at once . No ; I wo n’t submit to it indeed , Pa ! I am not quite a fool , and I am not blind . All I have got to say is , I wo n’t submit to it . ’
241042	241046	241047	241047	he	415	‘ My dear , ’
241050	241106	241108	241109	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ if in the short excitement of an angry moment I resorted to an unjustifiable means of suppressing a little outbreak calculated to injure you as well as myself -- it ’s possible I may have done so ; perhaps I did -- I ask your pardon . A father asking pardon of his child , ’
241111	241126	241192	241193	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ is , I believe , a spectacle to soften the most rugged nature . ’
241180	241190	241218	241218	he	415	‘ You labour under some mistake , my child ! ’
241195	241217	241218	241218	he	415	‘ but I will not ask you what it is ; I do n’t desire to know . No , pray ! ’
241229	241243	241262	241262	Cherry	241	‘ let us avoid the subject , my dear , whatever it is ! ’
241244	241260	241262	241262	Cherry	241	‘ It ’s quite right that the subject should be avoided between us , sir , ’
241264	241288	241289	241290	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ But I wish to be able to avoid it altogether , and consequently must beg you to provide me with a home . ’
241299	241306	241315	241315	Cherry	241	‘ A home , my child ! ’
241307	241313	241315	241315	Cherry	241	‘ Another home , papa , ’
241320	241350	241461	241461	he	415	‘ Place me at Mrs Todgers ’s or somewhere , on an independent footing ; but I will not live here , if such is to be the case . ’
241486	241492	241461	241461	he	415	‘ One of my birds , ’
241497	241537	241579	241580	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ has left me for the stranger ’s breast ; the other would take wing to Todgers ’s ! Well , well , what am I ? I do n’t know what I am , exactly . Never mind ! ’
241571	241577	241653	241654	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ But I have ever , ’
241582	241651	241653	241654	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ sacrificed my children ’s happiness to my own -- I mean my own happiness to my children’s -- and I will not begin to regulate my life by other rules of conduct now . If you can be happier at Mrs Todgers ’s than in your father ’s house , my dear , go to Mrs Todgers ’s ! Do not think of me , my girl ! ’
241658	241669	242750	242751	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ I shall get on pretty well , no doubt . ’
242745	242748	242763	242764	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Then , ’
242752	242761	242763	242764	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ what if I married her ! What , ’
242778	242801	243133	243134	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ what if , making sure of his approval first -- he is nearly imbecile , poor gentleman -- I married her ! ’
243124	243131	243183	243185	the old man	991	‘ Well , my good sir , ’
243163	243174	243183	243185	the old man	991	‘ and how is my dear friend this delicious morning ? ’
243175	243181	243192	243193	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Do you mean me ? ’
243187	243190	243192	243193	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Ah ! ’
243195	243216	243226	243228	the old man	991	‘ one of his deaf days , I see . Could I mean any one else , my dear sir ? ’
243217	243224	243226	243228	the old man	991	‘ You might have meant Mary , ’
243230	243253	243265	243266	old Martin	563	‘ Indeed I might . Quite true . I might speak of her as a dear , dear friend , I hope ? ’
243258	243263	243265	243266	old Martin	563	‘ I hope so , ’
243268	243275	243281	243281	Pecksniff	415	‘ I think she deserves it . ’
243276	243279	243281	243281	Pecksniff	415	‘ Think ! ’
243283	243289	243300	243300	Martin	563	‘ think , Mr Chuzzlewit ! ’
243290	243298	243300	243300	Martin	563	‘ You are speaking , I know , ’
243302	243315	243327	243327	Pecksniff	415	‘ but I do n’t catch what you say . Speak up ! ’
243316	243325	243327	243327	Pecksniff	415	‘ He ’s getting deafer than a flint , ’
243329	243353	243363	243365	the old man	991	‘ I was saying , my dear sir , that I am afraid I must make up my mind to part with Cherry . ’
243354	243361	243363	243365	the old man	991	‘ What has SHE been doing ? ’
243367	243378	243380	243381	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ He puts the most ridiculous questions I ever heard ! ’
243383	243392	243395	243395	he	991	‘ He ’s a child to - day . ’
243403	243415	243429	243429	Martin	563	‘ She has n’t been doing anything , my dear friend . ’
243416	243427	243443	243444	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ What are you going to part with her for ? ’
243431	243441	243443	243444	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ She has n’t her health by any means , ’
243446	243493	243500	243500	Martin	563	‘ She misses her sister , my dear sir ; they doted on each other from the cradle . And I think of giving her a run in London for a change . A good long run , sir , if I find she likes it . ’
243494	243498	243500	243500	Martin	563	‘ Quite right , ’
243502	243507	243538	243539	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ It ’s judicious . ’
243508	243536	243538	243539	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ I am glad to hear you say so . I hope you mean to bear me company in this dull part , while she ’s away ? ’
243541	243551	243563	243564	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ I have no intention of removing from it , ’
243557	243561	243679	243679	Martin	563	‘ Then why , ’
243580	243678	243689	243689	he	563	‘ Why , my good sir , ca n’t you come and stay with me ? I am sure I could surround you with more comforts -- lowly as is my Cot -- than you can obtain at a village house of entertainment . And pardon me , Mr Chuzzlewit , pardon me if I say that such a place as the Dragon , however well - conducted ( and , as far as I know , Mrs Lupin is one of the worthiest creatures in this county ) , is hardly a home for Miss Graham . ’
243696	243700	243689	243689	he	563	‘ No . You ’re

243716	243722	243689	243689	he	563	’ Mr Pecksniff eloquently pursued , ‘

243743	243748	243689	243689	he	563	’ said old Martin , ‘

243908	243920	243929	243929	you	0	’ repeated Martin , with a glimmer of his old obstinacy , ‘

243994	244026	244043	244043	sir	864	’ The architect was too much overcome to speak . He tried to drop a tear upon his patron ’s hand , but could n’t find one in his dry distillery . ‘
244034	244040	244060	244060	I	0	’ was his pious exclamation . ‘

244350	244444	244530	244530	he	5657	’ Old Martin blessed him in return , and squeezed his hand . As he turned away , and slowly walked towards the house , Mr Pecksniff stood gazing after him ; being pretty well recovered from his late emotion , which , in any other man , one might have thought had been assumed as a machinery for feeling Martin ’s pulse . The change in the old man found such a slight expression in his figure , that Mr Pecksniff , looking after him , could not help saying to himself : ‘
244458	244477	244496	244496	he	5657	’ Old Martin happening to turn his head , saluted him affectionately . Mr Pecksniff returned the gesture . ‘
244484	244489	244536	244536	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff ; ‘
244548	245009	244536	244536	I	0	’ In sober truth , there did appear to be nothing on which Mr Pecksniff might not have ventured with Martin Chuzzlewit ; for whatever Mr Pecksniff said or did was right , and whatever he advised was done . Martin had escaped so many snares from needy fortune - hunters , and had withered in the shell of his suspicion and distrust for so many years , but to become the good man ’s tool and plaything . With the happiness of this conviction painted on his face , the architect went forth upon his morning walk . The summer weather in his bosom was reflected in the breast of Nature . Through deep green vistas where the boughs arched overhead , and showed the sunlight flashing in the beautiful perspective ; through dewy fern from which the startled hares leaped up , and fled at his approach ; by mantled pools , and fallen trees , and down in hollow places , rustling among last year ’s leaves whose scent woke memory of the past ; the placid Pecksniff strolled . By meadow gates and hedges fragrant with wild roses ; and by thatched - roof cottages whose inmates humbly bowed before him as a man both good and wise ; the worthy Pecksniff walked in tranquil meditation . The bee passed onward , humming of the work he had to do ; the idle gnats for ever going round and round in one contracting and expanding ring , yet always going on as fast as he , danced merrily before him ; the colour of the long grass came and went , as if the light clouds made it timid as they floated through the distant air . The birds , so many Pecksniff consciences , sang gayly upon every branch ; and Mr Pecksniff paid HIS homage to the day by ruminating on his projects as he walked along . Chancing to trip , in his abstraction , over the spreading root of an old tree , he raised his pious eyes to take a survey of the ground before him . It startled him to see the embodied image of his thoughts not far ahead . Mary herself . And alone . At first Mr Pecksniff stopped as if with the intention of avoiding her ; but his next impulse was to advance , which he did at a brisk pace ; caroling as he went so sweetly and with so much innocence that he only wanted feathers and wings to be a bird . Hearing notes behind her , not belonging to the songsters of the grove , she looked round . Mr Pecksniff kissed his hand , and was at her side immediately . ‘
245014	245019	245022	245022	I.	5658	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘
245023	245060	245065	245066	sweet girl	2313	’ She said the morning was so beautiful that she had walked further than she intended , and would return . Mr Pecksniff said it was exactly his case , and he would return with her . ‘
245068	245086	245087	245087	You	2313	’ said Mr Pecksniff . Mary declined it , and walked so very fast that he remonstrated . ‘
245096	245101	245118	245118	you	2313	’ Mr Pecksniff said . ‘
245120	245121	245124	245124	I	0	’ ‘

245212	245216	245234	245234	you	0	’ said Mary , ‘
245244	245245	245234	245234	you	0	’ ‘

245312	245382	245416	245416	Mary	253	’ She tried to say she was sorry to hear it , but burst into tears . Mr Pecksniff now repeated the Todgers performance on a comfortable scale , as if he intended it to last some time ; and in his disengaged hand , catching hers , employed himself in separating the fingers with his own , and sometimes kissing them , as he pursued the conversation thus : ‘
245418	245438	245442	245442	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff in his tenderest tones , indeed they were so very tender that he almost squeaked : ‘
245446	245461	245464	245464	you	0	’ A fantastic thing , that maiden affectation ! She made believe to shudder . ‘
245466	245471	245519	245519	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
245523	245562	245566	245567	a widower	10165	’ She tried to disengage her hand , but might as well have tried to free herself from the embrace of an affectionate boa - constrictor ; if anything so wily may be brought into comparison with Pecksniff . ‘
245569	245595	245708	245708	you	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , examining the rings upon her fingers , and tracing the course of one delicate blue vein with his fat thumb , ‘
245695	245705	245742	245743	each other	8928	’ said Mr Pecksniff , apostrophizing the reluctant prize , ‘
245717	245739	245754	245754	my	0	’ He slapped the hand to punish it ; but relenting , folded it in his waistcoat to comfort it again . ‘

245853	245869	245969	245969	you	415	’ The good man smiled a greasy smile ; and drew her closer to him . ‘
245925	245967	245969	245969	you	415	’ Mr Pecksniff walked on with his arm round her waist , and her hand in his , as contentedly as if they had been all in all to each other , and were joined in the bonds of truest love . ‘

246062	246069	246047	246047	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , sweetly . ‘

246125	246147	246114	246114	he	270	’ Mr Pecksniff raised his heavy eyelids languidly , and let them fall again . It was saying with perfect coolness , ‘

246161	246165	246227	246227	you	415	’ said Mary , ‘

246385	246397	246405	246405	she	5686	’ said Mr Pecksniff , with a playful tightening of his grasp ‘
246410	246454	246405	246405	she	5686	’ Little , indeed ! Her mind was so strangely constituted that she would have preferred the caresses of a toad , an adder , or a serpent -- nay , the hug of a bear -- to the endearments of Mr Pecksniff . ‘

246705	246724	246702	246702	I	0	’ He raised his eyes to hers ; and nodded with an air of banter that was charming . ‘
246727	246733	246840	246840	you	12103	’ he continued , thoughtfully . ‘

247827	249071	249127	249127	He	5711	’ sleep had Tom that night , through dwelling in his bed upon these dreadful changes . When morning dawned he thought he must have dreamed this piece of ambiguity ; but no , on going downstairs he found them packing trunks and cording boxes , and making other preparations for Miss Charity ’s departure , which lasted all day long . In good time for the evening coach , Miss Charity deposited her housekeeping keys with much ceremony upon the parlour table ; took a gracious leave of all the house ; and quitted her paternal roof -- a blessing for which the Pecksniffian servant was observed by some profane persons to be particularly active in the thanksgiving at church next Sunday . CHAPTER THIRTY - ONE MR PINCH IS DISCHARGED OF A DUTY WHICH HE NEVER OWED TO ANYBODY , AND MR PECKSNIFF DISCHARGES A DUTY WHICH HE OWES TO SOCIETY The closing words of the last chapter lead naturally to the commencement of this , its successor ; for it has to do with a church . With the church , so often mentioned heretofore , in which Tom Pinch played the organ for nothing . One sultry afternoon , about a week after Miss Charity ’s departure for London , Mr Pecksniff being out walking by himself , took it into his head to stray into the churchyard . As he was lingering among the tombstones , endeavouring to extract an available sentiment or two from the epitaphs -- for he never lost an opportunity of making up a few moral crackers , to be let off as occasion served -- Tom Pinch began to practice . Tom could run down to the church and do so whenever he had time to spare ; for it was a simple little organ , provided with wind by the action of the musician ’s feet ; and he was independent , even of a bellows - blower . Though if Tom had wanted one at any time , there was not a man or boy in all the village , and away to the turnpike ( tollman included ) , but would have blown away for him till he was black in the face . Mr Pecksniff had no objection to music ; not the least . He was tolerant of everything ; he often said so . He considered it a vagabond kind of trifling , in general , just suited to Tom ’s capacity . But in regard to Tom ’s performance upon this same organ , he was remarkably lenient , singularly amiable ; for when Tom played it on Sundays , Mr Pecksniff in his unbounded sympathy felt as if he played it himself , and were a benefactor to the congregation . So whenever it was impossible to devise any other means of taking the value of Tom ’s wages out of him , Mr Pecksniff gave him leave to cultivate this instrument . For which mark of his consideration Tom was very grateful . The afternoon was remarkably warm , and Mr Pecksniff had been strolling a long way . He had not what may be called a fine ear for music , but he knew when it had a tranquilizing influence on his soul ; and that was the case now , for it sounded to him like a melodious snore . He approached the church , and looking through the diamond lattice of a window near the porch , saw Tom , with the curtains in the loft drawn back , playing away with great expression and tenderness . The church had an inviting air of coolness . The old oak roof supported by cross - beams , the hoary walls , the marble tablets , and the cracked stone pavement , were refreshing to look at . There were leaves of ivy tapping gently at the opposite windows ; and the sun poured in through only one ; leaving the body of the church in tempting shade . But the most tempting spot of all , was one red - curtained and soft - cushioned pew , wherein the official dignitaries of the place ( of whom Mr Pecksniff was the head and chief ) enshrined themselves on Sundays . Mr Pecksniff ’s seat was in the corner ; a remarkably comfortable corner ; where his very large Prayer - Book was at that minute making the most of its quarto self upon the desk . He determined to go in and rest . He entered very softly ; in part because it was a church ; in part because his tread was always soft ; in part because Tom played a solemn tune ; in part because he thought he would surprise him when he stopped . Unbolting the door of the high pew of state , he glided in and shut it after him ; then sitting in his usual place , and stretching out his legs upon the hassocks , he composed himself to listen to the music . It is an unaccountable circumstance that he should have felt drowsy there , where the force of association might surely have been enough to keep him wide awake ; but he did . He had not been in the snug little corner five minutes before he began to nod . He had not recovered himself one minute before he began to nod again . In the very act of opening his eyes indolently , he nodded again . In the very act of shutting them , he nodded again . So he fell out of one nod into another until at last he ceased to nod at all , and was as fast as the church itself . He had a consciousness of the organ , long after he fell asleep , though as to its being an organ he had no more idea of that than he had of its being a bull . After a while he began to have at intervals the same dreamy impressions of voices ; and awakening to an indolent curiosity upon the subject , opened his eyes . He was so indolent , that after glancing at the hassocks and the pew , he was already half - way off to sleep again , when it occurred to him that there really were voices in the church ; low voices , talking earnestly hard by ; while the echoes seemed to mutter responses . He roused himself , and listened . Before he had listened half a dozen seconds , he became as broad awake as ever he had been in all his life . With eyes , and ears , and mouth , wide open , he moved himself a very little with the utmost caution , and gathering the curtain in his hand , peeped out . Tom Pinch and Mary . Of course . He had recognized their voices , and already knew the topic they discussed . Looking like the small end of a guillotined man , with his chin on a level with the top of the pew , so that he might duck down immediately in case of either of them turning round , he listened . Listened with such concentrated eagerness , that his very hair and shirt - collar stood bristling up to help him . ‘
249074	249078	249127	249127	He	5711	’ cried Tom . ‘
249155	249156	249127	249127	He	5711	’ ‘

249439	249443	249516	249516	you	5713	’ Tom pursued ; ‘
249493	249497	249558	249560	an old friar	5717	’ faltered Tom , ‘
249562	249589	249590	249592	Dear Mr Pinch	491	’ If friars bear such hearts as thine , Tom , let friars multiply ; though they have no such rule in all their stern arithmetic . ‘
249594	249603	249670	249670	you	491	’ said Mary , giving him her hand ; ‘

249705	249713	249752	249752	you	491	’ replied Tom , shaking his head , ‘

249769	249773	249764	249764	I	0	’ said Mary , ‘

249784	249788	249764	249764	I	0	’ cried Tom . ‘
249798	249805	249806	249807	With Pecksniff	415	’ The gentleman in question dived . ‘
249809	249817	249859	249859	He	5722	’ rejoined Tom , with cheerful confidence . ‘
249865	249950	250104	250104	he	222	’ Many a man in Mr Pecksniff ’s place , if he could have dived through the floor of the pew of state and come out at Calcutta or any inhabited region on the other side of the earth , would have done it instantly . Mr Pecksniff sat down upon a hassock , and listening more attentively than ever , smiled . Mary seemed to have expressed some dissent in the meanwhile , for Tom went on to say , with honest energy : ‘
250097	250101	250119	250119	Martin	221	’ said Tom ; ‘
250128	250165	250188	250188	Mary	253	‘ em . But I forgot . He prepared you to dislike Pecksniff , of course . So you came with a prejudice , you know , Miss Graham , and are not a fair witness . ’
250182	250186	250188	250188	Mary	253	‘ Mr Pinch , ’
250190	250195	250203	250203	Tom	249	‘ you mistake him . ’
250196	250201	250213	250213	he	249	‘ No , no ! ’
250205	250212	250213	250213	he	249	‘ YOU mistake him . But , ’
250224	250238	250297	250297	Tom	249	‘ what is the matter ? Miss Graham , what is the matter ? ’
250289	250295	250297	250297	Tom	249	‘ What is the matter ? ’
250299	250354	250397	250397	Mary	253	‘ Have I said anything to hurt you ? Has any one said anything to hurt you ? Do n’t cry . Pray tell me what it is . I can not bear to see you so distressed . Mercy on us , I never was so surprised and grieved in all my life ! ’
250384	250395	250397	250397	Mary	253	‘ I would n’t have told you , Mr Pinch , ’
250399	250488	250489	250489	Tom	249	‘ if I could have helped it ; but your delusion is so absorbing , and it is so necessary that we should be upon our guard ; that you should not be compromised ; and to that end that you should know by whom I am beset ; that no alternative is left me . I came here purposely to tell you , but I think I should have wanted courage if you had not chanced to lead me so directly to the object of my coming . ’

250512	250523	250547	250547	Tom	249	‘ That person whom you think the best of men , ’
250540	250545	250547	250547	Tom	249	‘ Lord bless me ! ’
250552	250610	250632	250634	the trembling girl	5735	‘ Wait a moment . That person whom I think the best of men ! You mean Pecksniff , of course . Yes , I see you mean Pecksniff . Good gracious me , do n’t speak without authority . What has he done ? If he is not the best of men , what is he ? ’
250611	250630	250660	250660	Mary	253	‘ The worst . The falsest , craftiest , meanest , cruellest , most sordid , most shameless , ’
250653	250658	250660	250660	Mary	253	‘ What is he , ’
250662	250719	250728	250728	Tom	249	‘ who receiving me in his house as his guest ; his unwilling guest ; knowing my history , and how defenceless and alone I am , presumes before his daughters to affront me so , that if I had a brother but a child , who saw it , he would instinctively have helped me ? ’
250720	250726	250728	250728	Tom	249	‘ He is a scoundrel ! ’
250730	250741	250754	250754	Mary	253	‘ Whoever he may be , he is a scoundrel . ’
250747	250752	250754	250754	Mary	253	‘ What is he , ’
250756	250851	250862	250862	Tom	249	‘ who , when my only friend -- a dear and kind one , too -- was in full health of mind , humbled himself before him , but was spurned away ( for he knew him then ) like a dog . Who , in his forgiving spirit , now that that friend is sunk into a failing state , can crawl about him again , and use the influence he basely gains for every base and wicked purpose , and not for one -- not one -- that ’s true or good ? ’
250852	250860	251044	251046	the agitated girl	5736	‘ I say he is a scoundrel ! ’
250864	251042	251044	251046	the agitated girl	5736	‘ But what is he -- oh , Mr Pinch , what IS he -- who , thinking he could compass these designs the better if I were his wife , assails me with the coward ’s argument that if I marry him , Martin , on whom I have brought so much misfortune , shall be restored to something of his former hopes ; and if I do not , shall be plunged in deeper ruin ? What is he who makes my very constancy to one I love with all my heart a torture to myself and wrong to him ; who makes me , do what I will , the instrument to hurt a head I would heap blessings on ! What is he who , winding all these cruel snares about me , explains their purpose to me , with a smooth tongue and a smiling face , in the broad light of day ; dragging me on , the while , in his embrace , and holding to his lips a hand , ’
251051	251073	251080	251080	Tom	249	‘ which I would have struck off , if with it I could lose the shame and degradation of his touch ? ’
251074	251078	251080	251080	Tom	249	‘ I say , ’
251086	251116	251861	251862	Tom Pinch	249	‘ he is a scoundrel and a villain ! I do n’t care who he is , I say he is a double - dyed and most intolerable villain ! ’
251852	251859	251934	251934	Tom	249	‘ I would n’t have cared , ’
251882	251933	251934	251934	Tom	249	‘ I would n’t have cared for anything he might have done to Me , for I have tried his patience often , and have lived upon his sufferance and have never been the help to him that others could have been . I would n’t have minded , Pecksniff , ’
251943	252019	252441	252442	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ if you had done Me any wrong ; I could have found plenty of excuses for that ; and though you might have hurt me , could have still gone on respecting you . But why did you ever fall so low as this in my esteem ! Oh Pecksniff , Pecksniff , there is nothing I would not have given , to have had you deserve my old opinion of you ; nothing ! ’
252433	252439	252441	252442	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Is Mr Pinch indoors ? ’
252449	252456	252466	252467	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Just come in , sir . ’

252471	252479	252441	252442	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ And gone upstairs , I suppose ? ’
252480	252494	252500	252501	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Yes sir . Gone upstairs . Shall I call him , sir ? ’
252495	252498	252500	252501	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ No , ’
252503	252526	252441	252442	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ no . You need n’t call him , Jane . Thank you , Jane . How are your relations , Jane ? ’
252527	252537	252441	252442	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Pretty well , I thank you , sir . ’
252538	252565	252441	252442	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ I am glad to hear it . Let them know I asked about them , Jane . Is Mr Chuzzlewit in the way , Jane ? ’
252566	252579	252596	252597	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Yes , sir . He ’s in the parlour , reading . ’
252580	252594	252596	252597	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ He ’s in the parlour , reading , is he , Jane ? ’
252599	252615	252764	252765	old Martin	221	‘ Very well . Then I think I ’ll go and see him , Jane . ’
252756	252762	252764	252765	old Martin	221	‘ What is the matter ? ’
252767	252776	252764	252765	old Martin	221	‘ Pecksniff , what ails you , man ? ’
252777	252810	252764	252765	old Martin	221	‘ I am sorry to interrupt you , my dear sir , and I am still more sorry for the cause . My good , my worthy friend , I am deceived . ’
252811	252816	252822	252823	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ You are deceived ! ’
252817	252820	252822	252823	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Ah ! ’
252829	252862	252874	252874	Martin	221	‘ deceived in the tenderest point . Cruelly deceived in that quarter , sir , in which I placed the most unbounded confidence . Deceived , Mr Chuzzlewit , by Thomas Pinch . ’
252863	252872	252874	252874	Martin	221	‘ Oh ! bad , bad , bad ! ’
252881	252893	252947	252948	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Very bad ! I hope not . Are you certain ? ’
252894	252945	252947	252948	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Certain , my good sir ! My eyes and ears are witnesses . I would n’t have believed it otherwise . I would n’t have believed it , Mr Chuzzlewit , if a Fiery Serpent had proclaimed it from the top of Salisbury Cathedral . I would have said , ’
252950	253012	253031	253031	He	221	‘ that the Serpent lied . Such was my faith in Thomas Pinch , that I would have cast the falsehood back into the Serpent ’s teeth , and would have taken Thomas to my heart . But I am not a Serpent , sir , myself , I grieve to say , and no excuse or hope is left me . ’
253051	253062	253084	253085	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ That is almost the worst of all , sir , ’
253067	253082	253084	253085	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ on a subject nearly concerning YOU . Oh ! is it not enough , ’
253090	253107	253115	253120	the old man , changing colour	5777	‘ that these blows must fall on me , but must they also hit my friends ! ’
253108	253113	253115	253120	the old man , changing colour	5777	‘ You alarm me , ’
253122	253138	253149	253150	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ I am not so strong as I was . You terrify me , Pecksniff ! ’

253155	253201	253208	253208	Jane	370	‘ and we will do what is required of us . You shall know all , sir , and shall be righted . But first excuse me , sir , excuse me . I have a duty to discharge , which I owe to society . ’
253211	253223	253250	253252	The honest man	5778	‘ Send Mr Pinch here , if you please , Jane . ’
253264	253268	253271	253271	himself	5778	‘ You see ! ’
253278	253314	253325	253325	Tom	249	‘ Mr Pinch , I have left the vestry - window unfastened . Will you do me the favour to go and secure it ; then bring the keys of the sacred edifice to me ! ’
253315	253323	253325	253325	Tom	249	‘ The vestry - window , sir ? ’
253327	253338	253376	253376	he	12138	‘ You understand me , Mr Pinch , I think , ’
253343	253375	253376	253376	he	12138	‘ Yes , Mr Pinch , the vestry - window . I grieve to say that sleeping in the church after a fatiguing ramble , I overheard just now some fragments , ’
253381	253435	253505	253505	Martin	221	‘ of a dialogue between two parties ; and one of them locking the church when he went out , I was obliged to leave it myself by the vestry - window . Do me the favour to secure that vestry - window , Mr Pinch , and then come back to me . ’
253500	253503	253505	253505	Martin	221	‘ Pecksniff , ’
253511	253532	253542	253543	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ what does all this mean ? You are not going to do anything in haste , you may regret ! ’
253533	253540	253542	253543	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ No , my good sir , ’
253547	253576	254006	254006	Pecksniff	415	‘ No . But I have a duty to discharge which I owe to society ; and it shall be discharged , my friend , at any cost ! ’
253992	254004	254006	254006	Pecksniff	415	‘ Have you fastened the vestry - window , Mr Pinch ? ’
254008	254013	254030	254030	Tom	249	‘ Yes , sir . ’
254014	254029	254100	254100	Pecksniff	415	‘ Thank you . Put down the keys if you please , Mr Pinch . ’

254106	254122	254155	254155	Pecksniff	415	‘ oh , Mr Pinch ! I wonder you can look me in the face ! ’
254149	254153	254164	254164	he	415	‘ Mr Pinch , ’
254173	254198	254216	254216	he	249	‘ I will not dwell upon the past . I will spare you , and I will spare myself , that pain at least . ’
254225	254243	254252	254253	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Thank you , sir . I am very glad you will not refer to the past . ’
254244	254250	254318	254319	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ The present is enough , ’
254259	254316	254318	254319	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ and the sooner THAT is past , the better . Mr Pinch , I will not dismiss you without a word of explanation . Even such a course would be quite justifiable under the circumstances ; but it might wear an appearance of hurry , and I will not do it ; for I am , ’
254326	254348	254401	254401	Pecksniff	415	‘ perfectly self - possessed . Therefore I will say to you , what I have already said to Mr Chuzzlewit . ’
254380	254399	254401	254401	Pecksniff	415	‘ From fragments of a conversation which I overheard in the church , just now , Mr Pinch , ’
254403	254508	254525	254526	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ between yourself and Miss Graham -- I say fragments , because I was slumbering at a considerable distance from you , when I was roused by your voices -- and from what I saw , I ascertained ( I would have given a great deal not to have ascertained , Mr Pinch ) that you , forgetful of all ties of duty and of honour , sir ; regardless of the sacred laws of hospitality , to which you were pledged as an inmate of this house ; have presumed to address Miss Graham with unreturned professions of attachment and proposals of love . ’
254515	254523	254553	254553	Tom	249	‘ Do you deny it , sir ? ’
254546	254551	254553	254553	Tom	249	‘ No , sir , ’
254555	254560	254568	254569	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ I do not . ’
254561	254566	254568	254569	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ You do not , ’
254577	254600	254707	254707	his	415	‘ Oblige me by counting this money , Mr Pinch , and putting your name to this receipt . You do not ? ’
254708	254711	254732	254732	Pecksniff	415	‘ fragments . ’
254717	254730	254742	254742	Tom	249	‘ You find the amount correct , do you , Mr Pinch ? ’
254734	254740	254755	254756	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Quite correct , sir , ’
254744	254753	254755	254756	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ A person is waiting in the kitchen , ’
254758	254783	254875	254876	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ to carry your luggage wherever you please . We part , Mr Pinch , at once , and are strangers from this time . ’
254867	254873	254875	254876	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ I will not say , ’
254881	255046	255071	255071	he	249	‘ what a blow this is . I will not say how much it tries me ; how it works upon my nature ; how it grates upon my feelings . I do not care for that . I can endure as well as another man . But what I have to hope , and what you have to hope , Mr Pinch ( otherwise a great responsibility rests upon you ) , is , that this deception may not alter my ideas of humanity ; that it may not impair my freshness , or contract , if I may use the expression , my Pinions . I hope it will not ; I do n’t think it will . It may be a comfort to you , if not now , at some future time , to know that I shall endeavour not to think the worse of my fellow - creatures in general , for what has passed between us . Farewell ! ’
255082	255094	255104	255104	Pecksniff	415	‘ I think you left something in the church , sir . ’
255095	255102	255104	255104	Pecksniff	415	‘ Thank you , Mr Pinch , ’
255106	255115	255130	255130	Tom	249	‘ I am not aware that I did . ’
255116	255128	255137	255137	Pecksniff	415	‘ This is your double eye - glass , I believe ? ’
255132	255135	255137	255137	Pecksniff	415	‘ Oh ! ’
255145	255160	255168	255168	Tom	249	‘ I am obliged to you . Put it down , if you please . ’
255161	255166	255171	255171	I	0	‘ I found it , ’
255184	255305	255306	255306	I	0	’ So he had . Mr Pecksniff had taken it off when he was bobbing up and down , lest it should strike against the panelling ; and had forgotten it . Going back to the church with his mind full of having been watched , and wondering very much from what part , Tom ’s attention was caught by the door of the state pew standing open . Looking into it he found the glass . And thus he knew , and by returning it gave Mr Pecksniff the information that he knew , where the listener had been ; and that instead of overhearing fragments of the conversation , he must have rejoiced in every word of it . ‘
255313	255328	255306	255306	I	0	’ said Martin , drawing a long breath when Tom had left the room . ‘
255334	255339	255553	255553	Tom	249	’ assented Mr Pecksniff . ‘
255395	255552	256162	256162	You	5823	’ Tom went upstairs ; cleared his shelf of books ; packed them up with his music and an old fiddle in his trunk ; got out his clothes ( they were not so many that they made his head ache ) ; put them on the top of his books ; and went into the workroom for his case of instruments . There was a ragged stool there , with the horsehair all sticking out of the top like a wig : a very Beast of a stool in itself ; on which he had taken up his daily seat , year after year , during the whole period of his service . They had grown older and shabbier in company . Pupils had served their time ; seasons had come and gone . Tom and the worn - out stool had held together through it all . That part of the room was traditionally called ‘
255557	256161	256178	256178	Tom	249	’ It had been assigned to him at first because of its being situated in a strong draught , and a great way from the fire ; and he had occupied it ever since . There were portraits of him on the walls , with all his weak points monstrously portrayed . Diabolical sentiments , foreign to his character , were represented as issuing from his mouth in fat balloons . Every pupil had added something , even unto fancy portraits of his father with one eye , and of his mother with a disproportionate nose , and especially of his sister ; who always being presented as extremely beautiful , made full amends to Tom for any other jokes . Under less uncommon circumstances , it would have cut Tom to the heart to leave these things and think that he saw them for the last time ; but it did n’t now . There was no Pecksniff ; there never had been a Pecksniff ; and all his other griefs were swallowed up in that . So , when he returned into the bedroom , and , having fastened his box and a carpet - bag , put on his walking gaiters , and his great - coat , and his hat , and taken his stick in his hand , looked round it for the last time . Early on summer mornings , and by the light of private candle - ends on winter nights , he had read himself half blind in this same room . He had tried in this same room to learn the fiddle under the bedclothes , but yielding to objections from the other pupils , had reluctantly abandoned the design . At any other time he would have parted from it with a pang , thinking of all he had learned there , of the many hours he had passed there ; for the love of his very dreams . But there was no Pecksniff ; there never had been a Pecksniff , and the unreality of Pecksniff extended itself to the chamber , in which , sitting on one particular bed , the thing supposed to be that Great Abstraction had often preached morality with such effect that Tom had felt a moisture in his eyes , while hanging breathless on the words . The man engaged to bear his box -- Tom knew him well : a Dragon man -- came stamping up the stairs , and made a roughish bow to Tom ( to whom in common times he would have nodded with a grin ) as though he were aware of what had happened , and wished him to perceive it made no difference to HIM . It was clumsily done ; he was a mere waterer of horses ; but Tom liked the man for it , and felt it more than going away . Tom would have helped him with the box , but he made no more of it , though it was a heavy one , than an elephant would have made of a castle ; just swinging it on his back and bowling downstairs as if , being naturally a heavy sort of fellow , he could carry a box infinitely better than he could go alone . Tom took the carpet - bag , and went downstairs along with him . At the outer door stood Jane , crying with all her might ; and on the steps was Mrs Lupin , sobbing bitterly , and putting out her hand for Tom to shake . ‘

256173	256176	256178	256178	Tom	249	‘ No , ’
256180	256200	256210	256211	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ no . I shall walk to Salisbury to - night . I could n’t stay here . For goodness ’

257608	257711	257717	257718	Miss Pecksniff	241	’S AGAIN ; AND OF ANOTHER BLIGHTED PLANT BESIDES THE PLANTS UPON THE LEADS Early on the day next after that on which she bade adieu to the halls of her youth and the scenes of her childhood , Miss Pecksniff , arriving safely at the coach - office in London , was there received , and conducted to her peaceful home beneath the shadow of the Monument , by Mrs Todgers . M. Todgers looked a little worn by cares of gravy and other such solicitudes arising out of her establishment , but displayed her usual earnestness and warmth of manner . ‘
257720	257724	257727	257729	your princely pa	5884	’ said she , ‘
257731	257879	257889	257889	her	5886	’ Miss Pecksniff signified ( in confidence ) that he contemplated the introduction of a princely ma ; and repeated the sentiment that she was n’t blind , and was n’t quite a fool , and would n’t bear it . Mrs Todgers was more shocked by the intelligence than any one could have expected . She was quite bitter . She said there was no truth in man and that the warmer he expressed himself , as a general principle , the falser and more treacherous he was . She foresaw with astonishing clearness that the object of Mr Pecksniff ’s attachment was designing , worthless , and wicked ; and receiving from Charity the fullest confirmation of these views , protested with tears in her eyes that she loved Miss Pecksniff like a sister , and felt her injuries as if they were her own . ‘
257897	257902	257920	257920	you	5885	’ said Mrs Todgers , ‘
257927	257928	257920	257920	you	5885	’ ‘

258236	258246	258326	258326	he	5894	’ said Mrs Todgers , proceeding with her subject , ‘

258357	258362	258378	258378	He	5894	’ observed Miss Pecksniff . ‘
258365	258370	258465	258466	Miss Pecksniff	241	’ said Mrs Todgers , ‘
258427	258464	258479	258480	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ em , all in good nature , when suddenly he rose up , foaming with his fury , and but for being held by three would have had Mr Jinkins ’s life with a bootjack . ’

258482	258605	258610	258610	her	322	‘ now he is the meekest of men . You can almost bring the tears into his eyes by looking at him . He sits with me the whole day long on Sundays , talking in such a dismal way that I find it next to impossible to keep my spirits up equal to the accommodation of the boarders . His only comfort is in female society . He takes me half - price to the play , to an extent which I sometimes fear is beyond his means ; and I see the tears a - standing in his eyes during the whole performance -- particularly if it is anything of a comic nature . The turn I experienced only yesterday , ’
258616	258660	259073	259073	he	2341	‘ when the house - maid threw his bedside carpet out of the window of his room , while I was sitting here , no one can imagine . I thought it was him , and that he had done it at last ! ’

259318	259326	259328	259330	the youngest gentleman	2341	‘ Cheerful , Mrs Todgers ! cheerful ! ’
259332	259346	259365	259366	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ when she reminds me of days for ever fled , Mrs Todgers ! ’
259347	259363	259365	259366	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Then you had better avoid her for a short time , if she does , ’
259368	259384	259395	259395	Moddle	576	‘ and come to know her again , by degrees . That ’s my advice . ’
259385	259393	259395	259395	Moddle	576	‘ But I ca n’t avoid her , ’
259397	259425	259433	259434	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ I have n’t strength of mind to do it . Oh , Mrs Todgers , if you knew what a comfort her nose is to me ! ’
259426	259432	259446	259448	the youngest gentleman	2341	‘ Her nose , sir ! ’

259629	259639	259783	259784	Mr Moddle	577	’m looking on HER brow again , Mrs Todgers . ’

260156	260166	260178	260178	They	5946	‘ Men are so much more timid than we think ‘
260172	260177	260199	260199	he	5948	’ returned Mrs Todgers . ‘

260218	260246	260248	260249	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Oh yes , he was . Oh bless you , yes , my dear . I was very particular in those days , I assure you , ’
260253	260287	260307	260307	Charity	241	‘ No , no . You give Mr Moddle a little encouragement , Miss Pecksniff , if you wish him to speak ; and he ’ll speak fast enough , depend upon it . ’
260288	260305	260307	260307	Charity	241	‘ I am sure I do n’t know what encouragement he would have , Mrs Todgers , ’

260331	260335	260337	260338	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Quite right , ’
260340	260348	260307	260307	Charity	241	‘ That ’s indispensable , my dear . ’
260349	260358	260366	260367	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ And he sits very close to me . ’
260359	260364	260366	260367	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ Also quite correct , ’
260369	260376	260386	260387	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ And he looks at me . ’
260377	260384	260386	260387	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ To be sure he does , ’
260389	260415	260424	260425	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ And he has his arm upon the back of the chair or sofa , or whatever it is -- behind me , you know . ’
260416	260422	260424	260425	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ I should think so , ’
260427	260435	260839	260839	he	577	‘ And then he begins to cry ! ’
260859	260893	261135	261136	Mr Tapley	309	‘ Oh ! what a day this has been ! I ca n’t go back to the office this afternoon . Oh , what a trying day this has been ! Good Gracious ! ’

261138	261222	261287	261287	I	0	‘ as a desolate island would suit me , but I should only have had myself to provide for there , and being naturally a easy man to manage , there would n’t have been much credit in THAT . Now here I ’ve got my partner to take care on , and he ’s something like the sort of man for the purpose . I want a man as is always a - sliding off his legs when he ought to be on ‘
261293	261304	261329	261329	I	0	’ said Mr Tapley , after a moment ’s silence . ‘
261309	261328	261329	261329	I	0	’ He paused to look round , uncertain to which of the log - houses he should repair . ‘
261337	261341	261347	261347	They	5971	’ he observed ; ‘

261606	261610	261665	261665	he	0	’ said Mark . ‘

261701	261786	261665	261665	he	0	’ The woman shed tears , in very joy to see him ; the man shook both his hands and would not let them go ; the two boys hugged his legs ; the sick child in the mother ’s arms stretched out her burning little fingers , and muttered , in her hoarse , dry throat , his well - remembered name . It was the same family , sure enough . Altered by the salubrious air of Eden . But the same . ‘
261797	261806	261820	261820	I	0	’ said Mark , drawing a long breath . ‘
261821	261849	261904	261904	Mark	222	’m a - coming round fast . That ’ll do ! These gentlemen ai n’t my friends . Are they on the visiting list of the house ? ’
261894	261902	261904	261904	Mark	222	‘ I ai n’t superstitious about toads , ’
261911	261956	261959	261962	A very handsome animal	5987	‘ but if you could prevail upon the two or three I see in company , to step out at the same time , my young friends , I think they ’d find the open air refreshing . Not that I at all object to ‘
261967	261978	261959	261962	A very handsome animal	5987	’ said Mr Tapley , sitting down upon a stool ; ‘
262009	262020	262202	262203	the man	1838	‘ em to the best advantage out of doors perhaps . ’
262190	262200	262227	262227	Mark	222	‘ How is it that you have come here ? ’
262214	262225	262227	262227	Mark	222	‘ Why , we come by the steamer last night , ’
262229	262263	262269	262269	We	5997	‘ Our intention is to make our fortuns with punctuality and dispatch ; and to retire upon our property as soon as ever it ’s realised . But how are you all ? You ’re
262267	262268	262269	262269	We	5997	’ ‘
262275	262286	262293	262293	we	5997	’ said the poor woman , bending over her child . ‘
262300	262301	262293	262293	we	5997	’ ‘
262307	262310	262293	262293	we	5997	’ thought Mark ‘
262318	262324	262400	262400	you	5999	’ But he said cheerfully , ‘
262413	262639	262658	262658	Eden	96	’ That must have been a very unreasonable request on the part of Mark Tapley , with which , in their gratitude for his kind offices on board the ship , they would not have complied instantly . The man rose to accompany him without a moment ’s delay . Before they went , Mark took the sick child in his arms , and tried to comfort the mother ; but the hand of death was on it then , he saw . They found Martin in the house , lying wrapped up in his blanket on the ground . He was , to all appearance , very ill indeed , and shook and shivered horribly ; not as people do from cold , but in a frightful kind of spasm or convulsion , that racked his whole body . Mark ’s friend pronounced his disease an aggravated kind of fever , accompanied with ague ; which was very common in those parts , and which he predicted would be worse to - morrow , and for many more to - morrows . He had had it himself off and on , he said , for a couple of years or so ; but he was thankful that , while so many he had known had died about him , he had escaped with life . ‘
262648	262657	262905	262905	I	0	’ thought Mark , surveying his emaciated form . ‘
262662	262889	262905	262905	I	0	’ They had some medicine in their chest ; and this man of sad experience showed Mark how and when to administer it , and how he could best alleviate the sufferings of Martin . His attentions did not stop there ; for he was backwards and forwards constantly , and rendered Mark good service in all his brisk attempts to make their situation more endurable . Hope or comfort for the future he could not bestow . The season was a sickly one ; the settlement a grave . His child died that night ; and Mark , keeping the secret from Martin , helped to bury it , beneath a tree , next day . With all his various duties of attendance upon Martin ( who became the more exacting in his claims , the worse he grew ) , Mark worked out of doors , early and late ; and with the assistance of his friend and others , laboured to do something with their land . Not that he had the least strength of heart or hope , or steady purpose in so doing , beyond the habitual cheerfulness of his disposition , and his amazing power of self - sustainment ; for within himself , he looked on their condition as beyond all hope , and , in his own words , ‘
262893	262897	262909	262909	sir	864	’ in consequence . ‘
262911	262946	262967	262967	I	0	’ he confided to Martin in a leisure moment ; that is to say , one evening , while he was washing the linen of the establishment , after a hard day ’s work , ‘

262981	262993	263006	263006	sir	864	’ Martin retorted with a groan , from underneath his blanket . ‘

263260	263265	263246	263246	you	864	’ said poor Martin . ‘

263311	263320	263370	263370	his	6010	’ said Martin with a thrill of terror . ‘
263334	263368	263370	263370	his	6010	’ Mr Tapley ’s spirits appeared to be stimulated by this remark , although it was not a very flattering one . He proceeded with his washing in a brighter mood ; and observed ‘
263375	263376	263386	263386	sir	864	’ ‘
263388	263399	263508	263508	his	864	’ said Mr Tapley , scrubbing away at the linen , ‘
263457	263505	263710	263711	Mr Co.	451	’re like the cock that went and hid himself to save his life , and was found out by the noise he made . They ca n’t help crowing . They was born to do it , and do it they must , whatever comes of it . ’

263594	263598	263599	263600	Hannibal Chollop	581	’ cried Mark , ‘

263610	263616	263617	263617	He	6018	’ said Martin , feebly . ‘

263637	263707	263748	263748	sir	864	’ Which turned out to be quite true , for he did . His face was almost as hard and knobby as his stick ; and so were his hands . His head was like an old black hearth - broom . He sat down on the chest with his hat on ; and crossing his legs and looking up at Mark , said , without removing his pipe : ‘
263722	263744	263748	263748	sir	864	’ It may be necessary to observe that Mr Tapley had gravely introduced himself to all strangers , by that name . ‘

264134	264186	264201	264201	sir	864	’ He addressed himself to Mark ; because he saw that Martin , who wished him to go , being already half - mad with feverish irritation , which the droning voice of this new horror rendered almost insupportable , had closed his eyes , and turned on his uneasy bed . ‘

265569	265668	265783	265783	I	0	’ Mr Chollop was so delighted at the smartness of his excellent countryman having been too much for the Britisher , and at the Britisher ’s resenting it , that he could contain himself no longer , and broke forth in a shout of delight . But the strangest exposition of this ruling passion was in the other -- the pestilence - stricken , broken , miserable shadow of a man -- who derived so much entertainment from the circumstance that he seemed to forget his own ruin in thinking of it , and laughed outright when he said ‘

At last he rose . ‘

266111	266121	266135	266135	he	222	‘ Come out from under the blanket , sir , ’
266125	266134	266135	266135	he	222	‘ he ’s gone . What ’s this ! ’
266155	266182	266421	266421	he	222	‘ What ’s come of all that chattering and swaggering ? He ’s wandering in his mind to - night , and do n’t know me ! ’
266412	266420	266421	266421	he	222	‘ Floored for the present , sir , ’
266432	266436	266614	266614	sir	864	‘ but jolly ! ’

266621	266929	266946	266946	MYself	0	’ Now , when Martin began to think of this , and to look at Mark as he lay there ; never reproaching him by so much as an expression of regret ; never murmuring ; always striving to be manful and staunch ; he began to think , how was it that this man who had had so few advantages , was so much better than he who had had so many ? And attendance upon a sick bed , but especially the sick bed of one whom we have been accustomed to see in full activity and vigour , being a great breeder of reflection , he began to ask himself in what they differed . He was assisted in coming to a conclusion on this head by the frequent presence of Mark ’s friend , their fellow - passenger across the ocean , which suggested to him that in regard to having aided her , for example , they had differed very much . Somehow he coupled Tom Pinch with this train of reflection ; and thinking that Tom would be very likely to have struck up the same sort of acquaintance under similar circumstances , began to think in what respects two people so extremely different were like each other , and were unlike him . At first sight there was nothing very distressing in these meditations , but they did undoubtedly distress him for all that . Martin ’s nature was a frank and generous one ; but he had been bred up in his grandfather ’s house ; and it will usually be found that the meaner domestic vices propagate themselves to be their own antagonists . Selfishness does this especially ; so do suspicion , cunning , stealth , and covetous propensities . Martin had unconsciously reasoned as a child , ‘
266953	267475	266946	266946	MYself	0	’ So he had grown selfish . But he had never known it . If any one had taxed him with the vice , he would have indignantly repelled the accusation , and conceived himself unworthily aspersed . He never would have known it , but that being newly risen from a bed of dangerous sickness , to watch by such another couch , he felt how nearly Self had dropped into the grave , and what a poor dependent , miserable thing it was . It was natural for him to reflect -- he had months to do it in -- upon his own escape , and Mark ’s extremity . This led him to consider which of them could be the better spared , and why ? Then the curtain slowly rose a very little way ; and Self , Self , Self , was shown below . He asked himself , besides , when dreading Mark ’s decease ( as all men do and must , at such a time ) , whether he had done his duty by him , and had deserved and made a good response to his fidelity and zeal . No . Short as their companionship had been , he felt in many , many instances , that there was blame against himself ; and still inquiring why , the curtain slowly rose a little more , and Self , Self , Self , dilated on the scene . It was long before he fixed the knowledge of himself so firmly in his mind that he could thoroughly discern the truth ; but in the hideous solitude of that most hideous place , with Hope so far removed , Ambition quenched , and Death beside him rattling at the very door , reflection came , as in a plague - beleaguered town ; and so he felt and knew the failing of his life , and saw distinctly what an ugly spot it was . Eden was a hard school to learn so hard a lesson in ; but there were teachers in the swamp and thicket , and the pestilential air , who had a searching method of their own . He made a solemn resolution that when his strength returned he would not dispute the point or resist the conviction , but would look upon it as an established fact , that selfishness was in his breast , and must be rooted out . He was so doubtful ( and with justice ) of his own character , that he determined not to say one word of vain regret or good resolve to Mark , but steadily to keep his purpose before his own eyes solely ; and there was not a jot of pride in this ; nothing but humility and steadfastness ; the best armour he could wear . So low had Eden brought him down . So high had Eden raised him up . After a long and lingering illness ( in certain forlorn stages of which , when too far gone to speak , he had feebly written ‘
267478	267568	266946	266946	MYself	0	’ on a slate ) , Mark showed some symptoms of returning health . They came and went , and flickered for a time ; but he began to mend at last decidedly ; and after that continued to improve from day to day . As soon as he was well enough to talk without fatigue , Martin consulted him upon a project he had in his mind , and which a few months back he would have carried into execution without troubling anybody ’s head but his own . ‘
267575	267579	267672	267672	Mark	222	’ said Martin . ‘

267682	267695	267672	267672	Mark	222	’ returned Mr Tapley , with a significant stress upon the words ; ‘

267975	267981	267983	267983	Mark	222	‘ Why to be sure , ’
267985	268007	268013	268013	Martin	221	‘ he can only say no , and he may say yes . If you do n’t mind trying him , sir-- ’

269251	269255	269257	269258	Mr Tapley	309	’m reg’larly defrauded , ’
269267	269293	269483	269483	Martin	221	‘ It ’s a swindle . I never entered for this sort of service . There ’ll be no credit in being jolly with HIM ! ’
269476	269481	269663	269663	Martin	221	‘ It feels heavy , ’
269653	269661	269666	269666	his	221	‘ Courage ! We shall meet again ! ’
269676	269682	269692	269692	Mark	222	‘ In the Old World ! ’

269697	269716	270148	270148	It	6190	‘ To see them standing side by side , so quiet , is a’most the worst of all ! ’
270122	270129	270146	270146	Martin	221	‘ How do you do sir ? ’
270137	270144	270148	270148	It	6190	‘ How do you do sir ? ’
270183	270191	270198	270198	Martin	221	‘ You air from Europe , sir ? ’
270192	270196	270198	270198	Martin	221	‘ I am , ’
270200	270207	270221	270221	he	221	‘ You air fortunate , sir . ’
270229	270248	270255	270255	Martin	221	‘ You air fortunate , sir , in having an opportunity of beholding our Elijah Pogram , sir . ’
270249	270253	270276	270276	Martin	221	‘ Your Elijahpogram ! ’
270271	270275	270301	270302	the gentleman	977	‘ Yes sir . ’
270294	270299	270301	270302	the gentleman	977	‘ Yes , sir , ’
270304	270319	270301	270302	the gentleman	977	‘ our Elijah Pogram , sir , is , at this minute , identically settin ’
270325	270348	270351	270352	Elijah Pogram	589	’ The gentleman under the umbrella put his right forefinger to his eyebrow , as if he were revolving schemes of state . ‘
270357	270361	270364	270364	sir	864	’ said Martin . ‘
270366	270371	270374	270375	Elijah Pogram	589	’ replied the other . ‘
270377	270378	270374	270375	Elijah Pogram	589	’ ‘
270382	270386	270374	270375	Elijah Pogram	589	’ said Martin . ‘
270391	270415	270423	270424	Toe bust	6197	’ But he had not the least idea who this Elijah Pogram was ; having never heard the name in all his life . ‘
270428	270434	270374	270375	Elijah Pogram	589	’ said his new acquaintance , ‘
270455	270509	270516	270516	Martin	221	’ , sir , in its effects upon the human race , our Fourth of glorious July . Yes , sir , that is the Honourable Elijah Pogram , Member of Congress ; one of the master - minds of our country , sir . There is a brow , sir , there ! ’
270510	270514	270516	270516	Martin	221	‘ Quite remarkable , ’
270518	270588	270598	270598	Martin	221	‘ Yes , sir . Our own immortal Chiggle , sir , is said to have observed , when he made the celebrated Pogram statter in marble , which rose so much con - test and preju - dice in Europe , that the brow was more than mortal . This was before the Pogram Defiance , and was , therefore , a pre - diction , cruel smart . ’
270589	270596	270624	270625	his friend	9006	‘ What is the Pogram Defiance ? ’
270614	270622	270636	270636	Martin	221	‘ An o - ration , sir , ’
270627	270634	270636	270636	Martin	221	‘ Oh ! to be sure , ’
270638	270647	270658	270659	the other	934	‘ What am I thinking of ! It defied-- ’
270648	270656	270658	270659	the other	934	‘ It defied the world , sir , ’
270663	270703	270711	270711	Martin	221	‘ Defied the world in general to com - pete with our country upon any hook ; and devellop’d our internal resources for making war upon the universal airth . You would like to know Elijah Pogram , sir ? ’
270704	270709	270719	270720	the stranger	9262	‘ If you please , ’
270713	270717	270759	270759	I	0	‘ Mr Pogram , ’
270762	270798	270799	270800	Mr Pogram	591	’ The languid Mr Pogram shook hands with Martin , like a clock - work figure that was just running down . But he made amends by chewing like one that was just wound up . ‘
270802	270807	270834	270836	the gifted son	6209	’ said the introducer , ‘
270838	270945	270948	270948	you	864	’ It occurred to Martin that if the Honourable Elijah Pogram had stayed at home , and sent his shoes upon a tour , they would have answered the same purpose ; for they were the only part of him in a situation to see anything . In course of time , however , Mr Pogram rose ; and having ejected certain plugging consequences which would have impeded his articulation , took up a position where there was something to lean against , and began to talk to Martin ; shading himself with the green umbrella all the time . As he began with the words , ‘
270951	270959	270948	270948	you	864	’ Martin took him up and said : ‘
270966	270967	270970	270970	sir	864	’ ‘
270972	271007	271008	271008	Pogram	591	’ said Elijah Pogram . A knot of passengers gathered round to hear what followed ; and Martin heard his friend say , as he whispered to another friend , and rubbed his hands , ‘
271021	271022	271036	271036	I	0	’ ‘
271025	271035	271238	271238	You	864	’ said Martin , after a moment ’s hesitation , ‘
271108	271237	271247	271247	you	864	’ But Mr Pogram was going to make a great speech in the next session about foreign relations , and was going to write strong articles on the subject ; and as he greatly favoured the free and independent custom ( a very harmless and agreeable one ) of procuring information of any sort in any kind of confidence , and afterwards perverting it publicly in any manner that happened to suit him , he had determined to get at Martin ’s opinions somehow or other . For if he could have got nothing out of him , he would have had to invent it for him , and that would have been laborious . He made a mental note of his answer , and went in again . ‘
271251	271269	271247	271247	you	864	’ Martin said what he thought of that part of the country , in pretty strong terms . ‘
271274	271284	271311	271311	sir	864	’ said Pogram , looking round upon the group , ‘
271306	271307	271311	271311	sir	864	’ ‘
271313	271317	271365	271365	I	0	’ cried Martin . ‘
271363	271364	271365	271365	I	0	’ ‘
271376	271393	271422	271422	I	0	’ said Pogram , looking round again and taking himself up where Martin had interrupted him , ‘
271427	271433	271435	271438	a gentleman named Chollop	6224	’ turning to Martin again , ‘
271454	271455	271435	271438	a gentleman named Chollop	6224	’ ‘
271458	271462	271485	271486	The gentleman	977	’ answered Martin ; ‘
271493	271494	271505	271505	him	6224	’ ‘
271507	271511	271534	271534	sir	864	’ observed Mark . ‘
271525	271531	271534	271534	sir	864	’ said Pogram , interrogatively . ‘
271536	271555	271578	271578	Our	6229	’ cried Mark . The Honourable Elijah Pogram glanced at his friends as though he would have said , ‘
271563	271577	271586	271587	a man	913	’ and they rendered tribute to the Pogram genius by a gentle murmur . ‘
271596	271603	271707	271707	Chollop	581	’ said Pogram , with enthusiasm . ‘
271671	271701	271785	271787	one of them	12309	’ , and a child of Freedom ; and his boastful answer to the Despot and the Tyrant is , that his bright home is in the Settin Sun . ’
271792	271816	271828	271828	he	591	‘ that he guessed he had now seen something of the eloquential aspect of our country , and was chawed up pritty small . ’
271833	271843	271849	271849	Mark	222	‘ You do not seem to coincide , sir ? ’
271844	271847	271882	271882	them	6247	‘ Why , ’
271851	271881	271828	271828	he	591	‘ I did n’t like him much ; and that ’s the truth , sir . I thought he was a bully ; and I did n’t admire his carryin ’
271893	271896	271904	271904	Pogram	591	‘ em . ’
271897	271902	271904	271904	Pogram	591	‘ It ’s singler ! ’
271919	271938	271949	271949	Martin	221	‘ It ’s strange ! You observe the settled opposition to our Institutions which pervades the British mind ! ’
271939	271947	271949	271949	Martin	221	‘ What an extraordinary people you are ! ’
271951	272030	272056	272056	he	591	‘ Are Mr Chollop and the class he represents , an Institution here ? Are pistols with revolving barrels , sword - sticks , bowie - knives , and such things , Institutions on which you pride yourselves ? Are bloody duels , brutal combats , savage assaults , shooting down and stabbing in the streets , your Institutions ! Why , I shall hear next that Dishonour and Fraud are among the Institutions of the great republic ! ’
272047	272055	272056	272056	he	591	‘ This morbid hatred of our Institutions , ’
272059	272072	272056	272056	he	591	‘ is quite a study for the psychological observer . He ’s alludin ’
272077	272078	272088	272088	you	589	’ ‘
272091	272097	272442	272442	you	6251	’ said Martin , laughing , ‘
272139	272439	272442	272442	you	6251	’ The bell being rung for dinner at this moment , everybody ran away into the cabin , whither the Honourable Elijah Pogram fled with such precipitation that he forgot his umbrella was up , and fixed it so tightly in the cabin door that it could neither be let down nor got out . For a minute or so this accident created a perfect rebellion among the hungry passengers behind , who , seeing the dishes , and hearing the knives and forks at work , well knew what would happen unless they got there instantly , and were nearly mad ; while several virtuous citizens at the table were in deadly peril of choking themselves in their unnatural efforts to get rid of all the meat before these others came . They carried the umbrella by storm , however , and rushed in at the breach . The Honourable Elijah Pogram and Martin found themselves , after a severe struggle , side by side , as they might have come together in the pit of a London theatre ; and for four whole minutes afterwards , Pogram was snapping up great blocks of everything he could get hold of , like a raven . When he had taken this unusually protracted dinner , he began to talk to Martin ; and begged him not to have the least delicacy in speaking with perfect freedom to him , for he was a calm philosopher . Which Martin was extremely glad to hear ; for he had begun to speculate on Elijah being a disciple of that other school of republican philosophy , whose noble sentiments are carved with knives upon a pupil ’s body , and written , not with pen and ink , but tar and feathers . ‘
272453	272458	272442	272442	you	6251	’ inquired Elijah Pogram . ‘
272464	272520	272521	272521	You	6251	’ said Martin . They were a very pleasant party . No man had spoken a word ; every one had been intent , as usual , on his own private gorging ; and the greater part of the company were decidedly dirty feeders . The Honourable Elijah Pogram looked at Martin as if he thought ‘
272530	272685	272869	272870	Mr Pogram	591	’ and he was soon confirmed in this opinion . Sitting opposite to them was a gentleman in a high state of tobacco , who wore quite a little beard , composed of the overflowing of that weed , as they had dried about his mouth and chin ; so common an ornament that it would scarcely have attracted Martin ’s observation , but that this good citizen , burning to assert his equality against all comers , sucked his knife for some moments , and made a cut with it at the butter , just as Martin was in the act of taking some . There was a juiciness about the deed that might have sickened a scavenger . When Elijah Pogram ( to whom this was an every - day incident ) saw that Martin put the plate away , and took no butter , he was quite delighted , and said , ‘
272705	272706	272869	272870	Mr Pogram	591	’ ‘
272711	272719	272730	272731	A man	913	’ cried Martin , in his turn . ‘
272741	272745	272761	272762	Elijah Pogram	589	’S an Institution ! ’
272746	272759	272769	272769	Martin	221	‘ We have no time to ac - quire forms , sir , ’
272764	272767	272769	272769	Martin	221	‘ Acquire ! ’
272771	272845	272869	272870	Mr Pogram	591	‘ But it ’s not a question of acquiring anything . It ’s a question of losing the natural politeness of a savage , and that instinctive good breeding which admonishes one man not to offend and disgust another . Do n’t you think that man over the way , for instance , naturally knows better , but considers it a very fine and independent thing to be a brute in small matters ? ’
272846	272867	272886	272886	Martin	221	‘ He is a na - tive of our country , and is nat’rally bright and spry , of course , ’
272872	272884	272886	272886	Martin	221	‘ Now , observe what this comes to , Mr Pogram , ’
272888	273030	273103	273104	Captain Kedgick	471	‘ The mass of your countrymen begin by stubbornly neglecting little social observances , which have nothing to do with gentility , custom , usage , government , or country , but are acts of common , decent , natural , human politeness . You abet them in this , by resenting all attacks upon their social offences as if they were a beautiful national feature . From disregarding small obligations they come in regular course to disregard great ones ; and so refuse to pay their debts . What they may do , or what they may refuse to do next , I do n’t know ; but any man may see if he will , that it will be something following in natural succession , and a part of one great growth , which is rotten at the root . ’
273125	273130	273103	273104	Captain Kedgick	471	‘ Why , what the ‘
273133	273138	273147	273147	I	0	’ cried the Captain . ‘
273150	273151	273163	273163	Captain	1494	’ ‘
273168	273172	273173	273173	I	0	’ said Martin . ‘
273186	273191	273193	273194	our people	12523	’ retorted Kedgick coolly . ‘
273203	273204	273210	273211	Captain Kedgick	471	’ ‘
273213	273217	273218	273218	They	12523	’ said Martin . ‘
273229	273239	273246	273246	you	0	’ Kedgick answered , as he shook his head . ‘
273251	273252	273255	273255	you	1494	’ ‘
273258	273262	273275	273276	the Captain	3216	’ cried Martin . ‘
273270	273273	273275	273276	the Captain	3216	‘ em , ’
273278	273284	273292	273292	Martin	221	‘ No you did n’t ! ’
273285	273290	273292	273292	Martin	221	‘ My good friend , ’
273294	273344	273355	273356	the Captain	3216	‘ did I want to receive them ? Was it any act of mine ? Did n’t you tell me they would rile up , and that I should be flayed like a wild cat -- and threaten all kinds of vengeance , if I did n’t receive them ? ’
273345	273353	273355	273356	the Captain	3216	‘ I do n’t know about that , ’
273358	273369	273375	273375	I	0	‘ But when our people ’s frills is out , they ’re
273379	273404	273411	273411	you	3216	’ With that , he fell into the rear to walk with Mark , while Martin and Elijah Pogram went on to the National . ‘
273414	273418	273424	273424	I	0	’ said Mark . ‘
273428	273433	273602	273602	Sir	864	’ the Captain grumbled . ‘
273472	273601	273602	273602	Sir	864	’ Nothing mollified the Captain , who persisted in taking it very ill that they had not both died in Eden . The boarders at the National felt strongly on the subject too ; but it happened by good fortune that they had not much time to think about this grievance , for it was suddenly determined to pounce upon the Honourable Elijah Pogram , and give HIM a le - vee forthwith . As the general evening meal of the house was over before the arrival of the boat , Martin , Mark , and Pogram were taking tea and fixings at the public table by themselves , when the deputation entered to announce this honour ; consisting of six gentlemen boarders and a very shrill boy . ‘
273604	273609	273610	273611	Mr Pogram	591	’ said the spokesman . ‘
273613	273633	273688	273688	sir	864	’ cried the shrill boy . The spokesman thus reminded of the shrill boy ’s presence , introduced him . ‘
273690	273691	273692	273695	Julius Washington Merryweather Bib	596	’ ‘
273697	273705	273799	273799	Sir	864	’ said the gentleman himself TO himself . ‘
273759	273798	273799	273799	Sir	864	’ Each man took one slide forward as he was named ; butted at the Honourable Elijah Pogram with his head ; shook hands , and slid back again . The introductions being completed , the spokesman resumed . ‘
273801	273802	273803	273804	Mr Pogram	591	’ ‘
273806	273812	273803	273804	Mr Pogram	591	’ cried the shrill boy . ‘
273815	273825	273867	273868	Mr Pogram	591	’ said the spokesman , with a hopeless look , ‘
273850	273866	273974	273974	him	591	’ As there was nothing the shrill boy desired more , he immediately stepped forward . ‘
273931	273932	273974	273974	him	591	’ ‘
273935	273939	273974	273974	him	591	’ suggested Buffum . ‘
273956	273957	273974	273974	him	591	’ ‘
273960	273970	273974	273974	him	591	’ cried Colonel Grouper , in a loud voice . ‘
273978	273979	273991	273991	they	6295	’ ‘
273985	273990	274026	274027	Mr Pogram	591	’ pursued the Doctor , ‘
274018	274025	274026	274027	Mr Pogram	591	’ ordinary , at eight o’clock . ’
274033	274037	274043	274044	the Colonel	3206	‘ Fellow countrymen ! ’
274038	274041	274043	274044	the Colonel	3206	‘ Good ! ’
274046	274053	274054	274055	Mr Pogram	591	‘ Hear , him ! Good ! ’
274066	274092	274111	274111	him	591	‘ Your approbation of My labours in the common cause goes to My heart . At all times and in all places ; in the ladies ’

274116	274121	274171	274174	The Com - mittee	6317	’ said the Colonel . ‘
274169	274170	274171	274174	The Com - mittee	6317	’ ‘
274178	274184	274200	274200	sir	864	’ said the shrill boy , ‘
274202	274241	274320	274320	he	864	’ Mr Pogram shook hands with him , and everybody else , once more ; and when they came back again at five minutes before eight , they said , one by one , in a melancholy voice , ‘
274249	274318	274324	274324	he	864	’ and shook hands with Mr Pogram all over again , as if he had been abroad for a twelvemonth in the meantime , and they met , now , at a funeral . But by this time Mr Pogram had freshened himself up , and had composed his hair and features after the Pogram statue , so that any one with half an eye might cry out , ‘

Bright as the scene was ; fresh , and full of motion ; airy , free , and sparkling ; it was nothing to the life and exultation in the breasts of the two travellers , at sight of the old churches , roofs , and darkened chimney stacks of Home . The distant roar that swelled up hoarsely from the busy streets , was music in their ears ; the lines of people gazing from the wharves , were friends held dear ; the canopy of smoke that overhung the town was brighter and more beautiful to them than if the richest silks of Persia had been waving in the air . And though the water going on its glistening track , turned , ever and again , aside to dance and sparkle round great ships , and heave them up ; and leaped from off the blades of oars , a shower of diving diamonds ; and wantoned with the idle boats , and swiftly passed , in many a sportive chase , through obdurate old iron rings , set deep into the stone - work of the quays ; not even it was half so buoyant , and so restless , as their fluttering hearts , when yearning to set foot , once more , on native ground . A year had passed since those same spires and roofs had faded from their eyes . It seemed to them , a dozen years . Some trifling changes , here and there , they called to mind ; and wondered that they were so few and slight . In health and fortune , prospect and resource , they came back poorer men than they had gone away . But it was home . And though home is a name , a word , it is a strong one ; stronger than magician ever spoke , or spirit answered to , in strongest conjuration . Being set ashore , with very little money in their pockets , and no definite plan of operation in their heads , they sought out a cheap tavern , where they regaled upon a smoking steak , and certain flowing mugs of beer , as only men just landed from the sea can revel in the generous dainties of the earth . When they had feasted , as two grateful - tempered giants might have done , they stirred the fire , drew back the glowing curtain from the window , and making each a sofa for himself , by union of the great unwieldy chairs , gazed blissfully into the street . Even the street was made a fairy street , by being half hidden in an atmosphere of steak , and strong , stout , stand - up English beer . For on the window - glass hung such a mist , that Mr Tapley was obliged to rise and wipe it with his handkerchief , before the passengers appeared like common mortals . And even then , a spiral little cloud went curling up from their two glasses of hot grog , which nearly hid them from each other . It was one of those unaccountable little rooms which are never seen anywhere but in a tavern , and are supposed to have got into taverns by reason of the facilities afforded to the architect for getting drunk while engaged in their construction . It had more corners in it than the brain of an obstinate man ; was full of mad closets , into which nothing could be put that was not specially invented and made for that purpose ; had mysterious shelvings and bulkheads , and indications of staircases in the ceiling ; and was elaborately provided with a bell that rung in the room itself , about two feet from the handle , and had no connection whatever with any other part of the establishment . It was a little below the pavement , and abutted close upon it ; so that passengers grated against the window - panes with their buttons , and scraped it with their baskets ; and fearful boys suddenly coming between a thoughtful guest and the light , derided him , or put out their tongues as if he were a physician ; or made white knobs on the ends of their noses by flattening the same against the glass , and vanished awfully , like spectres . Martin and Mark sat looking at the people as they passed , debating every now and then what their first step should be . ‘

281350	281521	281348	281348	you	9043	’ This address , pumped out apparently from Mr Pecksniff ’s very heart , brought the enthusiasm to its highest pitch . The pocket handkerchiefs were waved again ; the charity children were admonished to grow up Pecksniffs , every boy among them ; the Corporation , gentlemen with wands , member for the Gentlemanly Interest , all cheered for Mr Pecksniff . Three cheers for Mr Pecksniff ! Three more for Mr Pecksniff ! Three more for Mr Pecksniff , gentlemen , if you please ! One more , gentlemen , for Mr Pecksniff , and let it be a good one to finish with ! In short , Mr Pecksniff was supposed to have done a great work and was very kindly , courteously , and generously rewarded . When the procession moved away , and Martin and Mark were left almost alone upon the ground , his merits and a desire to acknowledge them formed the common topic . He was only second to the Gentlemanly member . ‘

What a different town Salisbury was in Tom Pinch ’s eyes to be sure , when the substantial Pecksniff of his heart melted away into an idle dream ! He possessed the same faith in the wonderful shops , the same intensified appreciation of the mystery and wickedness of the place ; made the same exalted estimate of its wealth , population , and resources ; and yet it was not the old city nor anything like it . He walked into the market while they were getting breakfast ready for him at the Inn ; and though it was the same market as of old , crowded by the same buyers and sellers ; brisk with the same business ; noisy with the same confusion of tongues and cluttering of fowls in coops ; fair with the same display of rolls of butter , newly made , set forth in linen cloths of dazzling whiteness ; green with the same fresh show of dewy vegetables ; dainty with the same array in higglers ’
281906	282412	281677	281679	Best foot foremost	6495	’ feet , and pies made precious by the pork that once had walked upon them ; still it was strangely changed to Tom . For , in the centre of the market - place , he missed a statue he had set up there as in all other places of his personal resort ; and it looked cold and bare without that ornament . The change lay no deeper than this , for Tom was far from being sage enough to know , that , having been disappointed in one man , it would have been a strictly rational and eminently wise proceeding to have revenged himself upon mankind in general , by mistrusting them one and all . Indeed this piece of justice , though it is upheld by the authority of divers profound poets and honourable men , bears a nearer resemblance to the justice of that good Vizier in the Thousand - and - one Nights , who issues orders for the destruction of all the Porters in Bagdad because one of that unfortunate fraternity is supposed to have misconducted himself , than to any logical , not to say Christian , system of conduct , known to the world in later times . Tom had so long been used to steep the Pecksniff of his fancy in his tea , and spread him out upon his toast , and take him as a relish with his beer , that he made but a poor breakfast on the first morning after his expulsion . Nor did he much improve his appetite for dinner by seriously considering his own affairs , and taking counsel thereon with his friend the organist ’s assistant . The organist ’s assistant gave it as his decided opinion that whatever Tom did , he must go to London ; for there was no place like it . Which may be true in the main , though hardly , perhaps , in itself , a sufficient reason for Tom ’s going there . But Tom had thought of London before , and had coupled with it thoughts of his sister , and of his old friend John Westlock , whose advice he naturally felt disposed to seek in this important crisis of his fortunes . To London , therefore , he resolved to go ; and he went away to the coach - office at once , to secure his place . The coach being already full , he was obliged to postpone his departure until the next night ; but even this circumstance had its bright side as well as its dark one , for though it threatened to reduce his poor purse with unexpected country charges , it afforded him an opportunity of writing to Mrs Lupin and appointing his box to be brought to the old finger - post at the old time ; which would enable him to take that treasure with him to the metropolis , and save the expense of its carriage . ‘
282415	282422	281677	281679	Best foot foremost	6495	’ said Tom , comforting himself , ‘
282434	282646	283308	283308	Yoho	616	’ And it can not be denied that , when he had made up his mind to even this extent , he felt an unaccustomed sense of freedom -- a vague and indistinct impression of holiday - making -- which was very luxurious . He had his moments of depression and anxiety , and they were , with good reason , pretty numerous ; but still , it was wonderfully pleasant to reflect that he was his own master , and could plan and scheme for himself . It was startling , thrilling , vast , difficult to understand ; it was a stupendous truth , teeming with responsibility and self - distrust ; but in spite of all his cares , it gave a curious relish to the viands at the Inn , and interposed a dreamy haze between him and his prospects , in which they sometimes showed to magical advantage . In this unsettled state of mind , Tom went once more to bed in the low four - poster , to the same immovable surprise of the effigies of the former landlord and the fat ox ; and in this condition , passed the whole of the succeeding day . When the coach came round at last with ‘
282648	283267	283632	283632	Tom	249	’ blazoned in letters of gold upon the boot , it gave Tom such a turn , that he was half disposed to run away . But he did n’t do it ; for he took his seat upon the box instead , and looking down upon the four greys , felt as if he were another grey himself , or , at all events , a part of the turn - out ; and was quite confused by the novelty and splendour of his situation . And really it might have confused a less modest man than Tom to find himself sitting next that coachman ; for of all the swells that ever flourished a whip professionally , he might have been elected emperor . He did n’t handle his gloves like another man , but put them on -- even when he was standing on the pavement , quite detached from the coach -- as if the four greys were , somehow or other , at the ends of the fingers . It was the same with his hat . He did things with his hat , which nothing but an unlimited knowledge of horses and the wildest freedom of the road , could ever have made him perfect in . Valuable little parcels were brought to him with particular instructions , and he pitched them into this hat , and stuck it on again ; as if the laws of gravity did not admit of such an event as its being knocked off or blown off , and nothing like an accident could befall it . The guard , too ! Seventy breezy miles a day were written in his very whiskers . His manners were a canter ; his conversation a round trot . He was a fast coach upon a down - hill turnpike road ; he was all pace . A waggon could n’t have moved slowly , with that guard and his key - bugle on the top of it . These were all foreshadowings of London , Tom thought , as he sat upon the box , and looked about him . Such a coachman , and such a guard , never could have existed between Salisbury and any other place . The coach was none of your steady - going , yokel coaches , but a swaggering , rakish , dissipated London coach ; up all night , and lying by all day , and leading a devil of a life . It cared no more for Salisbury than if it had been a hamlet . It rattled noisily through the best streets , defied the Cathedral , took the worst corners sharpest , went cutting in everywhere , making everything get out of its way ; and spun along the open country - road , blowing a lively defiance out of its key - bugle , as its last glad parting legacy . It was a charming evening . Mild and bright . And even with the weight upon his mind which arose out of the immensity and uncertainty of London , Tom could not resist the captivating sense of rapid motion through the pleasant air . The four greys skimmed along , as if they liked it quite as well as Tom did ; the bugle was in as high spirits as the greys ; the coachman chimed in sometimes with his voice ; the wheels hummed cheerfully in unison ; the brass work on the harness was an orchestra of little bells ; and thus , as they went clinking , jingling , rattling smoothly on , the whole concern , from the buckles of the leaders ’
283624	283630	283632	283632	Tom	249	‘ This is kind indeed ! ’
283642	283653	283662	283666	the hostess of the Dragon	6523	‘ I did n’t mean to give you this trouble . ’
283654	283660	283683	283683	Tom	249	‘ Trouble , Mr Pinch ! ’
283668	283681	283683	283683	Tom	249	‘ Well ! It ’s a pleasure to you , I know , ’
283690	283696	283711	283711	Tom	249	‘ Is there any news ? ’
283703	283709	283711	283711	Tom	249	‘ Say you saw me , ’
283713	283755	283770	283771	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ and that I was very bold and cheerful , and not a bit down - hearted ; and that I entreated her to be the same , for all is certain to come right at last . Good - bye ! ’
283756	283768	283781	283781	Tom	249	‘ You ’ll write when you get settled , Mr Pinch ? ’
283773	283779	283781	283781	Tom	249	‘ When I get settled ! ’
283791	283865	283873	283874	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ Oh , yes , I ’ll write when I get settled . Perhaps I had better write before , because I may find that it takes a little time to settle myself ; not having too much money , and having only one friend . I shall give your love to the friend , by the way . You were always great with Mr Westlock , you know . Good - bye ! ’
283866	283871	283873	283874	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ Good - bye ! ’
283889	283897	283913	283913	Tom	249	‘ Take this . Good - bye ! ’
283898	283911	283932	283933	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ Do you want me to carry it to London for you ? ’
283925	283930	283966	283966	She	255	‘ No , no , ’
283935	283965	284009	284009	Tom	249	‘ It ’s only a little something for refreshment on the road . Sit fast , Jack . Drive on , sir . All right ! Good - bye ! ’
283994	284007	284009	284009	Tom	249	‘ And that ’s the last of the old finger - post , ’
284015	284083	284141	284141	Tom	249	‘ where I have so often stood to see this very coach go by , and where I have parted with so many companions ! I used to compare this coach to some great monster that appeared at certain times to bear my friends away into the world . And now it ’s bearing me away , to seek my fortune , Heaven knows where and how ! ’
284126	284139	284141	284141	Tom	249	‘ She is the kindest and most considerate creature in the world , ’
284143	284224	284249	284250	the coachman	9340	‘ Now I KNOW that she particularly told that man of hers not to look at me , on purpose to prevent my throwing him a shilling ! I had it ready for him all the time , and he never once looked towards me ; whereas that man naturally , ( for I know him very well , ) would have done nothing but grin and stare . Upon my word , the kindness of people perfectly melts me . ’
284237	284247	284261	284261	Tom	249	‘ Remarkable fine woman for her time of life , ’
284252	284259	284261	284261	Tom	249	‘ I quite agree with you , ’
284263	284268	284233	284234	The coachman	9340	‘ So she is . ’
284269	284275	284233	284234	The coachman	9340	‘ Finer than many a young ‘
284283	284288	284233	284234	The coachman	9340	’ observed the coachman . ‘
284291	284292	284304	284304	I	0	’ ‘
284299	284303	284304	284304	I	0	’ Tom assented . ‘
284309	284314	284342	284342	You	6530	‘ em myself when they ’re
284318	284341	284363	284363	you	6530	’ remarked the coachman . This was a matter of taste , which Tom did not feel himself called upon to discuss . ‘
284346	284359	284363	284363	you	6530	‘ em possessing correct opinions about refreshment , for instance , when they ’re
284366	284371	284363	284363	you	6530	’ said the coachman ; ‘
284394	284395	284397	284397	you	0	’ ‘
284406	284691	284717	284717	he	6532	’ said Tom , smiling . As the coachman only laughed , and as Tom was curious himself , he unpacked it , and put the articles , one by one , upon the footboard . A cold roast fowl , a packet of ham in slices , a crusty loaf , a piece of cheese , a paper of biscuits , half a dozen apples , a knife , some butter , a screw of salt , and a bottle of old sherry . There was a letter besides , which Tom put in his pocket . The coachman was so earnest in his approval of Mrs Lupin ’s provident habits , and congratulated Torn so warmly on his good fortune , that Tom felt it necessary , for the lady ’s sake , to explain that the basket was a strictly Platonic basket , and had merely been presented to him in the way of friendship . When he had made the statement with perfect gravity ; for he felt it incumbent on him to disabuse the mind of this lax rover of any incorrect impressions on the subject ; he signified that he would be happy to share the gifts with him , and proposed that they should attack the basket in a spirit of good fellowship at any time in the course of the night which the coachman ’s experience and knowledge of the road might suggest , as being best adapted to the purpose . From this time they chatted so pleasantly together , that although Tom knew infinitely more of unicorns than horses , the coachman informed his friend the guard at the end of the next stage , ‘
284724	285064	284717	284717	he	6532	’ Yoho , among the gathering shades ; making of no account the deep reflections of the trees , but scampering on through light and darkness , all the same , as if the light of London fifty miles away , were quite enough to travel by , and some to spare . Yoho , beside the village green , where cricket - players linger yet , and every little indentation made in the fresh grass by bat or wicket , ball or player ’s foot , sheds out its perfume on the night . Away with four fresh horses from the Bald - faced Stag , where topers congregate about the door admiring ; and the last team with traces hanging loose , go roaming off towards the pond , until observed and shouted after by a dozen throats , while volunteering boys pursue them . Now , with a clattering of hoofs and striking out of fiery sparks , across the old stone bridge , and down again into the shadowy road , and through the open gate , and far away , away , into the wold . Yoho ! Yoho , behind there , stop that bugle for a moment ! Come creeping over to the front , along the coach - roof , guard , and make one at this basket ! Not that we slacken in our pace the while , not we ; we rather put the bits of blood upon their metal , for the greater glory of the snack . Ah ! It is long since this bottle of old wine was brought into contact with the mellow breath of night , you may depend , and rare good stuff it is to wet a bugler ’s whistle with . Only try it . Do n’t be afraid of turning up your finger , Bill , another pull ! Now , take your breath , and try the bugle , Bill . There ’s music ! There ’s a tone ! ’
285072	285537	285561	285561	my	0	’ indeed . Yoho ! The skittish mare is all alive to - night . Yoho ! Yoho ! See the bright moon ! High up before we know it ; making the earth reflect the objects on its breast like water . Hedges , trees , low cottages , church steeples , blighted stumps and flourishing young slips , have all grown vain upon the sudden , and mean to contemplate their own fair images till morning . The poplars yonder rustle that their quivering leaves may see themselves upon the ground . Not so the oak ; trembling does not become HIM ; and he watches himself in his stout old burly steadfastness , without the motion of a twig . The moss - grown gate , ill - poised upon its creaking hinges , crippled and decayed swings to and fro before its glass , like some fantastic dowager ; while our own ghostly likeness travels on , Yoho ! Yoho ! through ditch and brake , upon the ploughed land and the smooth , along the steep hillside and steeper wall , as if it were a phantom - Hunter . Clouds too ! And a mist upon the Hollow ! Not a dull fog that hides it , but a light airy gauze - like mist , which in our eyes of modest admiration gives a new charm to the beauties it is spread before ; as real gauze has done ere now , and would again , so please you , though we were the Pope . Yoho ! Why now we travel like the Moon herself . Hiding this minute in a grove of trees ; next minute in a patch of vapour ; emerging now upon our broad clear course ; withdrawing now , but always dashing on , our journey is a counter - part of hers . Yoho ! A match against the Moon ! The beauty of the night is hardly felt , when Day comes rushing up . Yoho ! Two stages , and the country roads are almost changed to a continuous street . Yoho , past market - gardens , rows of houses , villas , crescents , terraces , and squares ; past waggons , coaches , carts ; past early workmen , late stragglers , drunken men , and sober carriers of loads ; past brick and mortar in its every shape ; and in among the rattling pavements , where a jaunty - seat upon a coach is not so easy to preserve ! Yoho , down countless turnings , and through countless mazy ways , until an old Innyard is gained , and Tom Pinch , getting down quite stunned and giddy , is in London ! ‘
285546	285559	285561	285561	my	0	’ said the driver , as he received his fee of Tom . ‘
285564	285568	285591	285591	I	0	’ said Tom , ‘
285606	285607	285610	285610	they	6535	’ ‘
285615	285620	285629	285629	them	6535	’ inquired the driver . ‘
285623	285627	285629	285629	them	6535	’ said Tom . ‘
285631	285880	285629	285629	them	6535	’ returned the driver . His mind was so clearly running on the assumption of Tom ’s having come to town to see an extensive circle of anxious relations and friends , that it would have been pretty hard work to undeceive him . Tom did not try . He cheerfully evaded the subject , and going into the Inn , fell fast asleep before a fire in one of the public rooms opening from the yard . When he awoke , the people in the house were all astir , so he washed and dressed himself ; to his great refreshment after the journey ; and , it being by that time eight o’clock , went forth at once to see his old friend John . John Westlock lived in Furnival ’s Inn , High Holborn , which was within a quarter of an hour ’s walk of Tom ’s starting - point , but seemed a long way off , by reason of his going two or three miles out of the straight road to make a short cut . When at last he arrived outside John ’s door , two stories up , he stood faltering with his hand upon the knocker , and trembled from head to foot . For he was rendered very nervous by the thought of having to relate what had fallen out between himself and Pecksniff ; and he had a misgiving that John would exult fearfully in the disclosure . ‘
285887	285891	285909	285909	I	0	’ thought Tom , ‘

285919	285923	285936	285936	nobody	9017	’ thought Tom . ‘
285941	285975	285936	285936	nobody	9017	’ It is quite certain that nobody came , and that Tom stood looking at the knocker ; wondering whereabouts in the neighbourhood a certain gentleman resided , who was roaring out to somebody ‘
285979	285985	285936	285936	nobody	9017	’ with all his might . ‘
285990	285996	286031	286031	I	0	’ thought Tom at last . ‘
286034	286063	286176	286177	the gentleman	977	’ To be sure he could , by turning the handle ; and to be sure when he did turn it the same voice came rushing out , crying ‘
286166	286174	286176	286177	the gentleman	977	‘ Why , Tom , my boy ! ’
286179	286182	286197	286198	Tom Pinch	249	‘ Tom ! ’
286183	286195	286176	286177	the gentleman	977	‘ How glad I am to see you , Mr Westlock ! ’
286211	286217	286224	286224	John	247	‘ How kind you are ! ’
286218	286222	286224	286224	John	247	‘ Mr Westlock ! ’
286226	286247	286262	286263	Thomas Pinch	249	‘ what do you mean by that , Pinch ? You have not forgotten my Christian name , I suppose ? ’
286248	286260	286262	286263	Thomas Pinch	249	‘ No , John , no . I have not forgotten , ’
286265	286275	286290	286290	John	247	‘ Good gracious me , how kind you are ! ’
286276	286288	286290	286290	John	247	‘ I never saw such a fellow in all my life ! ’
286292	286343	286355	286355	Tom	249	‘ What do you mean by saying THAT over and over again ? What did you expect me to be , I wonder ! Here , sit down , Tom , and be a reasonable creature . How are you , my boy ? I am delighted to see you ! ’
286344	286353	286367	286367	John	247	‘ And I am delighted to see YOU , ’
286357	286365	286367	286367	John	247	‘ It ’s mutual , of course , ’
286369	286540	286620	286620	John	247	‘ It always was , I hope . If I had known you had been coming , Tom , I would have had something for breakfast . I would rather have such a surprise than the best breakfast in the world , myself ; but yours is another case , and I have no doubt you are as hungry as a hunter . You must make out as well as you can , Tom , and we ’ll recompense ourselves at dinner - time . You take sugar , I know ; I recollect the sugar at Pecksniff ’s . Ha , ha , ha ! How IS Pecksniff ? When did you come to town ? DO begin at something or other , Tom . There are only scraps here , but they are not at all bad . Boar ’s Head potted . Try it , Tom . Make a beginning whatever you do . What an old Blade you are ! I am delighted to see you . ’
286615	286618	286620	286620	John	247	‘ There ! ’
286643	286675	286687	286687	Tom	249	‘ Now we are as well off as we are likely to be till dinner . And now let us have the news , Tom . Imprimis , how ’s Pecksniff ? ’
286676	286685	286718	286719	Thomas Pinch	249	‘ I do n’t know how he is , ’

286721	286751	286692	286693	John Westlock	247	‘ and , saving that I wish him no ill , I do n’t care . I have left him , John . I have left him for ever . ’
286752	286755	286836	286836	Tom	249	‘ Voluntarily ? ’
286756	286835	286887	286887	Tom	249	‘ Why , no , for he dismissed me . But I had first found out that I was mistaken in him ; and I could not have remained with him under any circumstances . I grieve to say that you were right in your estimate of his character . It may be a ridiculous weakness , John , but it has been very painful and bitter to me to find this out , I do assure you . ’
286876	286885	286887	286887	Tom	249	‘ It was all a dream of mine , ’
286889	286930	286941	286942	his friend	9006	‘ and it is over . I ’ll tell you how it happened , at some other time . Bear with my folly , John . I do not , just now , like to think or speak about it . ’
286931	286939	286941	286942	his friend	9006	‘ I swear to you , Tom , ’
286958	287015	287023	287023	Tom	249	‘ that when I see , as I do now , how deeply you feel this , I do n’t know whether to be glad or sorry that you have made the discovery at last . I reproach myself with the thought that I ever jested on the subject ; I ought to have known better . ’
287016	287021	287083	287083	Tom	249	‘ My dear friend , ’
287029	287081	287109	287110	The host	5436	‘ it is very generous and gallant in you to receive me and my disclosure in this spirit ; it makes me blush to think that I should have felt a moment ’s uneasiness as I came along . You ca n’t think what a weight is lifted off my mind , ’
287098	287108	287162	287162	John	247	‘ I shall punish the Boar ’s Head dreadfully . ’
287154	287160	287162	287162	John	247	‘ That ’s all right , ’
287174	287197	287207	287207	Tom	249	‘ Now , about our plans . You are going to stay with me , of course . Where ’s your box ? ’
287198	287205	287207	287207	Tom	249	‘ It ’s at the Inn , ’
287209	287214	287225	287226	John Westlock	247	‘ I did n’t intend-- ’
287215	287224	287225	287226	John Westlock	247	‘ Never mind what you did n’t intend , ’
287229	287258	287207	287207	Tom	249	‘ What you DID intend is more to the purpose . You intended , in coming here , to ask my advice , did you not , Tom ? ’
287259	287262	287207	287207	Tom	249	‘ Certainly . ’
287263	287275	287281	287281	Tom	249	‘ And to take it when I gave it to you ? ’
287276	287279	287281	287281	Tom	249	‘ Yes , ’
287285	287305	287207	287207	Tom	249	‘ if it were good advice , which , being yours , I have no doubt it will be . ’
287306	287357	287376	287376	Tom	249	‘ Very well . Then do n’t be an obstinate old humbug in the outset , Tom , or I shall shut up shop and dispense none of that invaluable commodity . You are on a visit to me . I wish I had an organ for you , Tom ! ’
287358	287374	287376	287376	Tom	249	‘ So do the gentlemen downstairs , and the gentlemen overhead I have no doubt , ’
287380	287400	287376	287376	Tom	249	‘ Let me see . In the first place , you will wish to see your sister this morning , ’
287405	287473	287479	287479	Tom	249	‘ and of course you will like to go there alone . I ’ll walk part of the way with you ; and see about a little business of my own , and meet you here again in the afternoon . Put that in your pocket , Tom . It ’s only the key of the door . If you come home first you ’ll want it . ’
287474	287477	287479	287479	Tom	249	‘ Really , ’
287481	287492	287503	287504	John Westlock	247	‘ quartering one ’s self upon a friend in this way-- ’
287493	287501	287503	287504	John Westlock	247	‘ Why , there are two keys , ’
287506	287542	287550	287550	Tom	249	‘ I ca n’t open the door with them both at once , can I ? What a ridiculous fellow you are , Tom ? Nothing particular you ’d like for dinner , is there ? ’
287543	287548	287550	287550	Tom	249	‘ Oh dear no , ’
287552	287575	287589	287589	Pinch	249	‘ Very well , then you may as well leave it to me . Have a glass of cherry brandy , Tom ? ’
287576	287587	287550	287550	Tom	249	‘ Not a drop ! What remarkable chambers these are ! ’
287590	287595	287589	287589	Pinch	249	‘ there ’s everything in ‘
287598	287599	287637	287637	you	249	’ ‘
287644	287645	287637	287637	you	249	’ ‘
287650	287654	287637	287637	you	249	’ cried Tom . ‘
287661	287717	287720	287720	Tom	249	’ Accordingly John Westlock took the French rolls out of his boots , and put his boots on , and dressed himself ; giving Tom the paper to read in the meanwhile . When he returned , equipped for walking , he found Tom in a brown study , with the paper in his hand . ‘
287722	287723	287720	287720	Tom	249	’ ‘
287726	287731	288036	288036	Tom	249	’ said Mr Pinch , ‘
287973	288034	288036	288036	Tom	249	’ walk of the Royal Exchange . Even those letters of the alphabet who are always running away from their friends and being entreated at the tops of columns to come back , never DO come back , if we may judge from the number of times they are asked to do it and do n’t . It really seems , ’
288046	288105	288300	288300	Tom	249	‘ as if people had the same gratification in printing their complaints as in making them known by word of mouth ; as if they found it a comfort and consolation to proclaim “ I want such and such a thing , and I ca n’t get it , and I do n’t expect I ever shall ! ” ’
288290	288298	288311	288312	the porter	5158	‘ Pray does Miss Pinch live here ? ’
288302	288309	288329	288329	he	5158	‘ Miss Pinch is governess here , ’
288334	288350	288361	288361	Tom	249	‘ You are a nice man , YOU are ; where did YOU come from ? ’
288351	288359	288329	288329	he	5158	‘ It ’s the same young lady , ’
288363	288374	288318	288318	he	5158	‘ It ’s quite right . Is she at home ? ’
288375	288382	288318	288318	he	5158	‘ I do n’t know , I ’m
288385	288390	288538	288538	Hollo	622	’ rejoined the porter . ‘
288402	288537	288551	288552	young man	2195	’ said Tom . He had quite a delicacy in offering the suggestion , for the possibility of such a step did not appear to present itself to the porter ’s mind at all . The fact was that the porter in answering the gate - bell had , according to usage , rung the house - bell ( for it is as well to do these things in the Baronial style while you are about it ) , and that there the functions of his office had ceased . Being hired to open and shut the gate , and not to explain himself to strangers , he left this little incident to be developed by the footman with the tags , who , at this juncture , called out from the door steps : ‘
288554	288555	288551	288552	young man	2195	’ ‘
288558	288566	288579	288580	Miss Pinch	298	’ said Tom , hurrying towards him . ‘
288584	288585	288586	288586	She	298	’ ‘
288590	288603	288619	288619	you	0	’ replied the footman . As much as to say to Tom : ‘
288626	288627	288635	288635	you	0	’ ‘
288638	288706	288788	288789	her brother	2157	’ said Tom . The footman , being a lively young man , happened to have his attention caught at that moment by the flight of a pigeon , in which he took so warm an interest that his gaze was rivetted on the bird until it was quite out of sight . He then invited Tom to come in , and showed him into a parlour . ‘
288710	288786	288800	288800	Mother	624	’ said the young man , pausing languidly at the door . It was a good thought ; because without providing the stranger , in case he should happen to be of a warm temper , with a sufficient excuse for knocking him down , it implied this young man ’s estimate of his quality , and relieved his breast of the oppressive burden of rating him in secret as a nameless and obscure individual . ‘
288795	288799	288808	288808	Brother	517	’ said Tom . ‘
288802	288807	288808	288808	Brother	517	’ drawled the footman . ‘
288810	288819	288904	288904	me	0	’ repeated Tom , slightly raising his voice . ‘
288869	288902	288904	288904	me	0	’ The young man ’s interest in Tom ’s observations had ceased long before this time , but he kindly waited until now ; when , shutting the door , he withdrew . ‘
288906	288910	288929	288929	Ruth	325	’ said Tom . ‘
288935	289054	289058	289058	my	0	’ His cogitations were interrupted by the sound of voices in the adjoining room . They seemed to be engaged in high dispute , or in indignant reprimand of some offender ; and gathering strength occasionally , broke out into a perfect whirlwind . It was in one of these gusts , as it appeared to Tom , that the footman announced him ; for an abrupt and unnatural calm took place , and then a dead silence . He was standing before the window , wondering what domestic quarrel might have caused these sounds , and hoping Ruth had nothing to do with it , when the door opened , and his sister ran into his arms . ‘
289061	289080	289108	289108	You	325	’ said Tom , looking at her with great pride , when they had tenderly embraced each other , ‘
289113	289121	289136	289136	you	325	’ said Tom , with inexpressible delight ; ‘
289141	289142	289147	289147	Tom--	625	’ ‘
289148	289149	289158	289158	you	325	’ ‘
289161	289171	289147	289147	Tom--	625	’ said Tom , gently smoothing down her hair . ‘
289187	289197	289204	289204	you	325	’ said Tom , looking at her more intently , ‘
289209	289210	289217	289217	Tom	249	’ ‘
289219	289220	289217	289217	Tom	249	’ ‘
289223	289229	289250	289250	I	0	’ said her brother stoutly . ‘
289251	289310	289379	289379	He	249	’m not with Mr Pecksniff now . I am going to try and settle myself in London ; and if you are not happy here ( as I very much fear you are not , for I begin to think you have been deceiving me with the kindest and most affectionate intention ) you shall not remain here . ’
289384	289394	289433	289433	Ruth	325	‘ there are more Pecksniffs than one , perhaps , ’
289422	289431	289433	289433	Ruth	325	‘ We will talk about it , Tom , ’
289443	289453	289460	289460	Tom	249	‘ I am afraid I can not stay here . ’
289454	289458	289488	289488	Tom	249	‘ Can not ! ’
289462	289487	289531	289531	Tom	249	‘ Why then , you shall not , my love . Heyday ! You are not an object of charity ! Upon my word ! ’
289524	289529	289531	289531	Tom	249	‘ Show the way , ’
289533	289542	289644	289645	Ruth Pinch	325	‘ I ’ll wait upon him at once . ’
289636	289642	289656	289657	the gentleman	977	‘ My brother , sir , ’
289651	289654	289656	289657	the gentleman	977	‘ Oh ! ’
289663	289688	289701	289702	the lady	9983	‘ You really are Miss Pinch ’s brother , I presume ? You will excuse my asking . I do n’t observe any resemblance . ’
289689	289699	289726	289727	the pupil	1445	‘ Miss Pinch has a brother , I know , ’
289704	289724	289738	289739	the gentleman	977	‘ Miss Pinch is always talking about her brother , when she ought to be engaged upon my education , ’
289729	289736	289738	289739	the gentleman	977	‘ Sophia ! Hold your tongue ! ’
289741	289749	289781	289782	the gentleman	977	‘ Sit down , if you please , ’
289768	289779	289834	289840	the brass - and - copper founder	6611	‘ Remain here , if you please , Miss Pinch , ’
289813	289832	289834	289840	the brass - and - copper founder	6611	‘ I am glad you chance to have called to see your sister to - day , sir , ’
289842	289899	289911	289912	the lady	9983	‘ For although I do not approve , as a principle , of any young person engaged in my family in the capacity of a governess , receiving visitors , it happens in this case to be well timed . I am sorry to inform you that we are not at all satisfied with your sister . ’
289900	289909	289937	289938	the pupil	1445	‘ We are very much DISsatisfied with her , ’
289914	289935	289945	289946	her father	8909	‘ I ’d never say another lesson to Miss Pinch if I was to be beat to death for it ! ’
289940	289943	289945	289946	her father	8909	‘ Sophia ! ’
289948	289953	289970	289970	Tom	249	‘ Hold your tongue ! ’
289954	289968	289977	289978	the gentleman	977	‘ Will you allow me to inquire what your ground of dissatisfaction is ? ’
289972	289975	290087	290088	the gentleman	977	‘ Yes , ’
289980	290085	290087	290088	the gentleman	977	‘ I will . I do n’t recognize it as a right ; but I will . Your sister has not the slightest innate power of commanding respect . It has been a constant source of difference between us . Although she has been in this family for some time , and although the young lady who is now present has almost , as it were , grown up under her tuition , that young lady has no respect for her . Miss Pinch has been perfectly unable to command my daughter ’s respect , or to win my daughter ’s confidence . Now , ’
290104	290128	290139	290139	Tom	249	‘ I maintain that there is something radically wrong in that ! You , as her brother , may be disposed to deny it-- ’
290129	290137	290139	290139	Tom	249	‘ I beg your pardon , sir , ’
290141	290168	290175	290176	the gentleman	977	‘ I am not at all disposed to deny it . I am sure that there is something radically wrong ; radically monstrous , in that . ’
290169	290173	290175	290176	the gentleman	977	‘ Good Heavens ! ’
290185	290293	290301	290302	the lady	9983	‘ what do I find to be the case ! what results obtrude themselves upon me as flowing from this weakness of character on the part of Miss Pinch ! What are my feelings as a father , when , after my desire ( repeatedly expressed to Miss Pinch , as I think she will not venture to deny ) that my daughter should be choice in her expressions , genteel in her deportment , as becomes her station in life , and politely distant to her inferiors in society , I find her , only this very morning , addressing Miss Pinch herself as a beggar ! ’
290294	290299	290314	290315	the gentleman	977	‘ A beggarly thing , ’
290307	290312	290314	290315	the gentleman	977	‘ Which is worse , ’
290319	290336	290343	290343	Tom	249	‘ which is worse . A beggarly thing . A low , coarse , despicable expression ! ’
290337	290341	290343	290343	Tom	249	‘ Most despicable , ’
290345	290361	290370	290371	the gentleman	977	‘ I am glad to find that there is a just appreciation of it here . ’
290362	290368	290374	290374	his	977	‘ So just , sir , ’
290382	290445	290455	290455	Tom	249	‘ So just , that , but for my knowing Miss Pinch to be an unprotected young person , an orphan , and without friends , I would , as I assured Miss Pinch , upon my veracity and personal character , a few minutes ago , I would have severed the connection between us at that moment and from that time . ’
290446	290453	290455	290455	Tom	249	‘ Bless my soul , sir ! ’
290473	290517	290527	290528	the lady	9983	‘ do n’t allow such considerations as those to influence you , pray . They do n’t exist , sir . She is not unprotected . She is ready to depart this instant . Ruth , my dear , get your bonnet on ! ’
290518	290525	290455	290455	Tom	249	‘ Oh , a pretty family ! ’
290530	290545	290555	290555	Tom	249	‘ Oh , he ’s her brother ! There ’s no doubt about that ! ’
290546	290553	290555	290555	Tom	249	‘ As little doubt , madam , ’
290557	290587	290455	290455	Tom	249	‘ as that the young lady yonder is the child of your teaching , and not my sister ’s . Ruth , my dear , get your bonnet on ! ’
290588	290596	290455	290455	Tom	249	‘ When you say , young man , ’
290608	290670	290676	290676	Tom	249	‘ with that impertinence which is natural to you , and which I therefore do not condescend to notice further , that the young lady , my eldest daughter , has been educated by any one but Miss Pinch , you -- I need n’t proceed . You comprehend me fully . I have no doubt you are used to it . ’
290671	290674	290676	290676	Tom	249	‘ Sir ! ’
290688	290744	290754	290755	the gentleman	977	‘ If you do not understand what I mean , I will tell you . If you do understand what I mean , I beg you not to repeat that mode of expressing yourself in answer to it . My meaning is , that no man can expect his children to respect what he degrades . ’
290745	290752	290754	290755	the gentleman	977	‘ Ha , ha , ha ! ’
290757	290769	290779	290779	Tom	249	‘ Ca nt ! ca nt ! The common ca nt ! ’
290770	290777	290779	290779	Tom	249	‘ The common story , sir ! ’
290781	290817	290835	290836	the gentleman	977	‘ the story of a common mind . Your governess can not win the confidence and respect of your children , forsooth ! Let her begin by winning yours , and see what happens then . ’
290818	290833	290846	290846	Tom	249	‘ Miss Pinch is getting her bonnet on , I trust , my dear ? ’
290838	290844	290907	290907	Tom	249	‘ I trust she is , ’
290852	290905	290907	290907	Tom	249	‘ I have no doubt she is . In the meantime I address myself to you , sir . You made your statement to me , sir ; you required to see me for that purpose ; and I have a right to answer it . I am not loud or turbulent , ’
290914	290950	290964	290965	the gentleman	977	‘ though I can scarcely say as much for you , in your manner of addressing yourself to me . And I wish , on my sister ’s behalf , to state the simple truth . ’
290951	290962	290964	290965	the gentleman	977	‘ You may state anything you like , young man , ’
290971	290980	290989	290989	Tom	249	‘ My dear , Miss Pinch ’s money . ’
290981	290987	290989	290989	Tom	249	‘ When you tell me , ’
291002	291106	291117	291118	the gentleman	977	‘ that my sister has no innate power of commanding the respect of your children , I must tell you it is not so ; and that she has . She is as well bred , as well taught , as well qualified by nature to command respect , as any hirer of a governess you know . But when you place her at a disadvantage in reference to every servant in your house , how can you suppose , if you have the gift of common sense , that she is not in a tenfold worse position in reference to your daughters ? ’
291107	291115	291117	291118	the gentleman	977	‘ Pretty well ! Upon my word , ’
291120	291126	291137	291137	Tom	249	‘ this is pretty well ! ’
291127	291135	291137	291137	Tom	249	‘ It is very ill , sir , ’
291139	291250	291263	291264	the gentleman	977	‘ It is very bad and mean , and wrong and cruel . Respect ! I believe young people are quick enough to observe and imitate ; and why or how should they respect whom no one else respects , and everybody slights ? And very partial they must grow -- oh , very partial!--to their studies , when they see to what a pass proficiency in those same tasks has brought their governess ! Respect ! Put anything the most deserving of respect before your daughters in the light in which you place her , and you will bring it down as low , no matter what it is ! ’
291251	291261	291294	291294	Tom	249	‘ You speak with extreme impertinence , young man , ’

As to your suspicion and distrust of her ; even of her word ; if she is not above their reach , you have no right to employ her . ’

292029	292082	292108	292108	you	2116	’ Tom ’s sister was not much wiser on such a topic than he was . So she squeezed her little purse into his coat - pocket , and folding the little hand with which she did so on the other little hand with which she clasped his arm , said nothing . ‘
292091	292095	292108	292108	you	2116	’ said Tom , ‘

292219	292345	292126	292126	Tom	249	’ Tom ’s sister would have gone anywhere with him ; so they walked off , arm in arm , as comfortably as possible . Finding , presently , that Islington was not in that neighbourhood , Tom made inquiries respecting a public conveyance thither ; which they soon obtained . As they rode along they were very full of conversation indeed , Tom relating what had happened to him , and Tom ’s sister relating what had happened to her , and both finding a great deal more to say than time to say it in ; for they had only just begun to talk , in comparison with what they had to tell each other , when they reached their journey ’s end . ‘

292374	292758	292759	292759	I	0	’ So they walked off again , quite as happily as if they had just stepped out of a snug little house of their own , to look for lodgings on account of somebody else . Tom ’s simplicity was unabated , Heaven knows ; but now that he had somebody to rely upon him , he was stimulated to rely a little more upon himself , and was , in his own opinion , quite a desperate fellow . After roaming up and down for hours , looking at some scores of lodgings , they began to find it rather fatiguing , especially as they saw none which were at all adapted to their purpose . At length , however , in a singular little old - fashioned house , up a blind street , they discovered two small bedrooms and a triangular parlour , which promised to suit them well enough . Their desiring to take possession immediately was a suspicious circumstance , but even this was surmounted by the payment of their first week ’s rent , and a reference to John Westlock , Esquire , Furnival ’s Inn , High Holborn . Ah ! It was a goodly sight , when this important point was settled , to behold Tom and his sister trotting round to the baker ’s , and the butcher ’s , and the grocer ’s , with a kind of dreadful delight in the unaccustomed cares of housekeeping ; taking secret counsel together as they gave their small orders , and distracted by the least suggestion on the part of the shopkeeper ! When they got back to the triangular parlour , and Tom ’s sister , bustling to and fro , busy about a thousand pleasant nothings , stopped every now and then to give old Tom a kiss or smile upon him , Tom rubbed his hands as if all Islington were his . It was late in the afternoon now , though , and high time for Tom to keep his appointment . So , after agreeing with his sister that in consideration of not having dined , they would venture on the extravagance of chops for supper at nine , he walked out again to narrate these marvellous occurrences to John . ‘

HE RETALIATES UPON A FALLEN FOE Tom ’s evil genius did not lead him into the dens of any of those preparers of cannibalic pastry , who are represented in many standard country legends as doing a lively retail business in the Metropolis ; nor did it mark him out as the prey of ring - droppers , pea and thimble - riggers , duffers , touters , or any of those bloodless sharpers , who are , perhaps , a little better known to the Police . He fell into conversation with no gentleman who took him into a public - house , where there happened to be another gentleman who swore he had more money than any gentleman , and very soon proved he had more money than one gentleman by taking his away from him ; neither did he fall into any other of the numerous man - traps which are set up without notice , in the public grounds of this city . But he lost his way . He very soon did that ; and in trying to find it again he lost it more and more . Now , Tom , in his guileless distrust of London , thought himself very knowing in coming to the determination that he would not ask to be directed to Furnival ’s Inn , if he could help it ; unless , indeed , he should happen to find himself near the Mint , or the Bank of England ; in which case he would step in , and ask a civil question or two , confiding in the perfect respectability of the concern . So on he went , looking up all the streets he came near , and going up half of them ; and thus , by dint of not being true to Goswell Street , and filing off into Aldermanbury , and bewildering himself in Barbican , and being constant to the wrong point of the compass in London Wall , and then getting himself crosswise into Thames Street , by an instinct that would have been marvellous if he had had the least desire or reason to go there , he found himself , at last , hard by the Monument . The Man in the Monument was quite as mysterious a being to Tom as the Man in the Moon . It immediately occurred to him that the lonely creature who held himself aloof from all mankind in that pillar like some old hermit was the very man of whom to ask his way . Cold , he might be ; little sympathy he had , perhaps , with human passion -- the column seemed too tall for that ; but if Truth did n’t live in the base of the Monument , notwithstanding Pope ’s couplet about the outside of it , where in London ( thought Tom ) was she likely to be found ! Coming close below the pillar , it was a great encouragement to Tom to find that the Man in the Monument had simple tastes ; that stony and artificial as his residence was , he still preserved some rustic recollections ; that he liked plants , hung up bird - cages , was not wholly cut off from fresh groundsel , and kept young trees in tubs . The Man in the Monument , himself , was sitting outside the door -- his own door : the Monument - door : what a grand idea!--and was actually yawning , as if there were no Monument to stop his mouth , and give him a perpetual interest in his own existence . Tom was advancing towards this remarkable creature , to inquire the way to Furnival ’s Inn , when two people came to see the Monument . They were a gentleman and a lady ; and the gentleman said , ‘
293576	293584	293585	293586	A Tanner	6654	’ The Man in the Monument replied , ‘
293588	293651	293652	293652	They	6655	’ It seemed a low expression , compared with the Monument . The gentleman put a shilling into his hand , and the Man in the Monument opened a dark little door . When the gentleman and lady had passed out of view , he shut it again , and came slowly back to his chair . He sat down and laughed . ‘

293683	293718	293719	293719	My	0	’ The Man in the Monument was a Cynic ; a worldly man ! Tom could n’t ask his way of HIM . He was prepared to put no confidence in anything he said . ‘

293945	293953	293929	293930	Miss Graham	565	’ cried Charity , with sharp impatience , ‘
293955	293982	293990	293990	Tom	249	’re very easily deceived . You do n’t know the arts of which such a creature is capable . Oh ! it ’s a wicked world . ’

294107	294119	294128	294128	Charity	241	‘ Only at present ! Are you going home again soon ? ’
294120	294126	294181	294181	Cherry	241	‘ No , Mr Pinch , ’
294130	294179	294181	294181	Cherry	241	‘ No , thank you . No ! A mother - in - law who is younger than -- I mean to say , who is as nearly as possible about the same age as one ’s self , would not quite suit my spirit . Not quite ! ’
294188	294199	294210	294210	you	249	‘ I thought from your saying “ at present”’--Tom observed . ‘
294224	294230	294246	294246	you	249	’ said Charity , blushing , ‘
294250	294315	294429	294429	You	221	’ Tom mentioned , to excuse himself , that he had an appointment in Furnival ’s Inn , and that coming from Islington he had taken a few wrong turnings , and arrived at the Monument instead . Miss Pecksniff simpered very much when he asked her if she knew the way to Furnival ’s Inn , and at length found courage to reply . ‘
294439	294457	294463	294463	I	0	’ she said with a curious toss of her head , and anything but an agreeable smile . ‘
294472	294476	294534	294534	She	2521	’ said Tom , ‘
294532	294533	294534	294534	She	2521	’ ‘
294545	294562	294586	294586	You	0	’ said Cherry , gathering up the corners of her mouth , and nodding at Tom . ‘
294584	294585	294586	294586	You	0	’ ‘
294592	294604	294605	294605	I	0	’ cried Tom , who was really concerned by this insinuation . ‘
294609	294613	294630	294631	Mr Pinch	221	’ said Charity . ‘
294653	294660	294677	294677	You	221	’ Here she smiled as before . ‘
294683	294977	294980	294980	Merry	317	’ There was something hidden here , which piqued Tom ’s interest and troubled his tender heart . When , in a moment ’s irresolution , he looked at Charity , he could not but observe a struggle in her face between a sense of triumph and a sense of shame ; nor could he but remark how , meeting even his eyes , which she cared so little for , she turned away her own , for all the splenetic defiance in her manner . An uneasy thought entered Tom ’s head ; a shadowy misgiving that the altered relations between himself and Pecksniff were somehow to involve an altered knowledge on his part of other people , and were to give him an insight into much of which he had had no previous suspicion . And yet he put no definite construction upon Charity ’s proceedings . He certainly had no idea that as he had been the audience and spectator of her mortification , she grasped with eager delight at any opportunity of reproaching her sister with his presence in HER far deeper misery ; for he knew nothing of it , and only pictured that sister as the same giddy , careless , trivial creature she always had been , with the same slight estimation of himself which she had never been at the least pains to conceal . In short , he had merely a confused impression that Miss Pecksniff was not quite sisterly or kind ; and being curious to set it right , accompanied her as she desired . The house - door being opened , she went in before Tom , requesting him to follow her ; and led the way to the parlour door . ‘
294982	294989	295055	295056	Mr Pinch	221	’ she said , looking in , ‘
295031	295054	295059	295059	Papa	569	’ Not more surprised than Tom was , when he looked upon her . Not so much . Not half so much . ‘
295064	295068	295216	295216	me	0	’ said Cherry , ‘
295106	295213	295302	295302	I	0	’ With these words Miss Pecksniff screamed her way out of the parlour , calling on Augustus Moddle to appear ; and left Tom Pinch alone with her sister . If she had always been his kindest friend ; if she had treated him through all his servitude with such consideration as was never yet received by struggling man ; if she had lightened every moment of those many years , and had ever spared and never wounded him ; his honest heart could not have swelled before her with a deeper pity , or a purer freedom from all base remembrance than it did then . ‘
295238	295301	295341	295342	Mr Pinch	221	’ Tom was sorry to hear her speaking in her old manner . He had not expected that . Yet he did not feel it a contradiction that he should be sorry to see her so unlike her old self , and sorry at the same time to hear her speaking in her old manner . The two things seemed quite natural . ‘
295351	295386	295387	295387	We	6674	’ Her bonnet lay beside her on the sofa , and she was very busy with the ribbons as she spoke . Much too busy to be conscious of the work her fingers did . ‘
295391	295423	295491	295492	Mr Pinch	221	’ said Tom.--Tom was right in that , for one person can no more quarrel without an adversary , than one person can play at chess , or fight a duel . ‘

295460	295488	295491	295492	Mr Pinch	221	’ She looked at him for a moment ; dropped her bonnet from her hands ; spread them before her altered face , and burst into tears . ‘
295494	295498	295514	295514	I	0	’ she said , ‘
295523	295561	295601	295601	I	0	’ She spoke as little like her old self now , for certain , as Tom could possibly have wished . But she seemed to be appealing to him reproachfully , and he did not understand her . ‘

295658	295662	295732	295732	I	0	’ said Tom , ‘
295750	295818	295732	295732	I	0	’ After a little while she thanked him , through her tears and sobs , and told him she had never been at once so sorry and so comforted , since she left home . Still she wept bitterly ; and it was the greater pain to Tom to see her weeping , from her standing in especial need , just then , of sympathy and tenderness . ‘
295823	295827	295828	295828	you	221	’ said Tom , ‘

295896	295945	295949	295949	he	249	’ she added , looking hurriedly into his face--‘I sometimes thought he liked you , but suppressed it -- will you promise me to tell him that you saw me here , and that I said I bore in mind the time we talked together in the churchyard ? ’
295952	296004	296059	296059	Mercy	244	‘ Many times since then , when I have wished I had been carried there before that day , I have recalled his words . I wish that he should know how true they were , although the least acknowledgment to that effect has never passed my lips and never will . ’
296041	296057	296059	296059	Mercy	244	‘ If he should ever know this , through your means , dear Mr Pinch , ’
296061	296137	296145	296145	Tom	249	‘ tell him that I sent the message , not for myself , but that he might be more forbearing and more patient , and more trustful to some other person , in some other time of need . Tell him that if he could know how my heart trembled in the balance that day , and what a very little would have turned the scale , his own would bleed with pity for me . ’
296138	296143	296145	296145	Tom	249	‘ Yes , yes , ’
296147	296151	296059	296059	Mercy	244	‘ I will . ’
296152	296331	296494	296495	Mrs Todgers	322	‘ When I appeared to him the most unworthy of his help , I was -- I know I was , for I have often , often , thought about it since -- the most inclined to yield to what he showed me . Oh ! if he had relented but a little more ; if he had thrown himself in my way for but one other quarter of an hour ; if he had extended his compassion for a vain , unthinking , miserable girl , in but the least degree ; he might , and I believe he would , have saved her ! Tell him that I do n’t blame him , but am grateful for the effort that he made ; but ask him for the love of God , and youth , and in merciful consideration for the struggle which an ill - advised and unwakened nature makes to hide the strength it thinks its weakness -- ask him never , never , to forget this , when he deals with one again ! ’
296478	296492	296502	296502	Tom	249	‘ Ah , sir ! You are an old friend , I see , ’

296728	296739	296851	296851	Woman	9079	’ said Mrs Todgers , putting back her handkerchief again , ‘
296749	296850	296986	296988	Mr Thomas Pinch	249	’ Mrs Todgers might have said her best friend . Commercial gentlemen and gravy had tried Mrs Todgers ’s temper ; the main chance -- it was such a very small one in her case , that she might have been excused for looking sharp after it , lest it should entirely vanish from her sight -- had taken a firm hold on Mrs Todgers ’s attention . But in some odd nook in Mrs Todgers ’s breast , up a great many steps , and in a corner easy to be overlooked , there was a secret door , with ‘
296852	296985	297004	297005	Mr Moddle	577	’ written on the spring , which , at a touch from Mercy ’s hand , had flown wide open , and admitted her for shelter . When boarding - house accounts are balanced with all other ledgers , and the books of the Recording Angel are made up for ever , perhaps there may be seen an entry to thy credit , lean Mrs Todgers , which shall make thee beautiful ! She was growing beautiful so rapidly in Tom ’s eyes ; for he saw that she was poor , and that this good had sprung up in her from among the sordid strivings of her life ; that she might have been a very Venus in a minute more , if Miss Pecksniff had not entered with her friend . ‘
296990	297003	297009	297010	my sister	2521	’ said Charity , performing the ceremony of introduction with evident pride . ‘
297012	297013	297025	297025	She	2521	’ ‘
297019	297024	297025	297025	She	2521	’ Mrs Todgers answered . ‘
297032	297033	297025	297025	She	2521	’ ‘
297036	297044	297025	297025	She	2521	’ said Charity , looking at Tom . ‘
297050	297051	297068	297069	Mrs Todgers	322	’ ‘
297071	297075	297068	297069	Mrs Todgers	322	’ observed Moddle . ‘
297080	297090	297109	297109	you	577	’ said Miss Pecksniff , in a low voice . ‘
297112	297213	297109	297109	you	577	’ This was succeeded by some trifling love passages , which appeared to originate with , if not to be wholly carried on by Miss Pecksniff . At any rate , Mr Moddle was much slower in his responses than is customary with young lovers , and exhibited a lowness of spirits which was quite oppressive . He did not improve at all when Tom and he were in the streets , but sighed so dismally that it was dreadful to hear him . As a means of cheering him up , Tom told him that he wished him joy . ‘
297216	297220	297109	297109	you	577	’ cried Moddle . ‘
297225	297226	297109	297109	you	577	’ ‘
297233	297237	297248	297248	YOU	577	’ thought Tom . ‘
297255	297274	297275	297275	I	0	’ said Moddle . Tom admitted that it was a subject in which he certainly felt some interest . ‘
297279	297284	297313	297313	he	249	’ said Mr Moddle . ‘
297295	297298	297371	297371	he	249	’m ready . ’
297404	297434	297450	297451	Tom Pinch	249	‘ Why , Tom , old boy , where on earth have you been ? Your box is here . Get your boots off instantly , and sit down ! ’
297435	297448	297450	297451	Tom Pinch	249	‘ I am sorry to say I ca n’t stay , John , ’
297468	297473	297486	297486	Tom	249	‘ Ca n’t stay ! ’
297474	297484	297486	297486	Tom	249	‘ If you ’ll go on with your dinner , ’
297488	297514	297450	297451	Tom Pinch	249	‘ I ’ll tell you my reason the while . I must n’t eat myself , or I shall have no appetite for the chops . ’
297515	297526	297538	297538	Tom	249	‘ There are no chops here , my food fellow . ’
297527	297536	297695	297695	he	249	‘ No . But there are at Islington , ’
297689	297694	297695	297695	he	249	‘ And now Tom , ’
297703	297734	297743	297743	Tom	249	‘ I have a question to ask you to which I expect a manly and straightforward answer . Do you want any money ? I am pretty sure you do . ’
297735	297741	297695	297695	he	249	‘ I do n’t indeed , ’
297745	297753	297770	297770	Tom	249	‘ I believe you are deceiving me . ’
297754	297769	297770	297770	Tom	249	‘ No . With many thanks to you , I am quite in earnest , ’
297773	297840	297858	297858	John	247	‘ My sister has some money , and so have I. If I had nothing else , John , I have a five - pound note , which that good creature , Mrs Lupin , of the Dragon , handed up to me outside the coach , in a letter begging me to borrow it ; and then drove off as hard as she could go . ’
297841	297856	297858	297858	John	247	‘ And a blessing on every dimple in her handsome face , say I ! ’
297860	297887	297901	297901	Tom	249	‘ though why you should give her the preference over me , I do n’t know . Never mind . I bide my time , Tom . ’
297888	297899	297901	297901	Tom	249	‘ And I hope you ’ll continue to bide it , ’
297905	297928	299625	299626	Mr Nadgett	535	‘ For I owe you more , already , in a hundred other ways , than I can ever hope to pay . ’
299619	299622	299625	299626	Mr Nadgett	535	’ sake . ‘
299628	299676	299680	299681	Mr Nadgett	535	’ Mr Nadgett put his hat upon the ground and coughed . The boy having withdrawn and shut the door , he went to it softly , examined the handle , and returned to within a pace or two of the chair in which Mr Montague sat . ‘
299683	299684	299694	299694	sir	864	’ ‘
299696	299697	299715	299716	Mr Nadgett	535	’ ‘
299718	299719	299733	299733	We	6767	’ ‘
299739	299740	299750	299750	you	535	’ ‘
299756	299757	299783	299783	you	535	’ ‘
299768	299780	299792	299792	yourself	535	’ was his answer , as he put on his spectacles . ‘
299794	299814	299839	299839	you	535	’ Mr Nadgett rubbed his hands slowly , stroked his chin , looked round the room , and said , ‘
299846	299847	299839	299839	you	535	’ ‘
299852	300009	300012	300012	you	535	’ Mr Nadgett picked out a certain chair from among the rest , and having planted it in a particular spot , as carefully as if he had been going to vault over it , placed another chair in front of it ; leaving room for his own legs between them . He then sat down in chair number two , and laid his pocket - book , very carefully , on chair number one . He then untied the pocket - book , and hung the string over the back of chair number one . He then drew both the chairs a little nearer Mr Montague , and opening the pocket - book spread out its contents . Finally he selected a certain memorandum from the rest , and held it out to his employer , who , during the whole of these preliminary ceremonies , had been making violent efforts to conceal his impatience . ‘
300026	300035	300038	300038	you	535	’ said Tigg Montague with a ghastly smile . ‘
300051	300052	300053	300053	I	0	’ ‘
300061	300067	300101	300101	We	6773	’ said Mr Nadgett gravely . ‘
300075	300100	300115	300115	you	535	’ Mr Montague was going to retort , when Nadgett handed him the paper , and said , with quiet exultation in his tone , ‘
300120	300193	300115	300115	you	535	’ The chairman cast his eyes upon it , coldly , and with a smile which did not render any great homage to the slow and methodical habits of his spy . But he had not read half - a - dozen lines when the expression of his face began to change , and before he had finished the perusal of the paper , it was full of grave and serious attention . ‘
300197	300212	300228	300228	you	535	’ said Mr Nadgett , handing him another , and receiving back the first . ‘
300232	300521	300528	300529	Mr Nadgett	535	’ Tigg Montague leaned backward in his chair , and cast upon his emissary such a look of vacant wonder ( not unmingled with alarm ) , that Mr Nadgett considered it necessary to repeat the request he had already twice preferred ; with the view to recalling his attention to the point in hand . Profiting by the hint , Mr Montague went on with Number Two , and afterwards with Numbers Three , and Four , and Five , and so on . These documents were all in Mr Nadgett ’s writing , and were apparently a series of memoranda , jotted down from time to time upon the backs of old letters , or any scrap of paper that came first to hand . Loose straggling scrawls they were , and of very uninviting exterior ; but they had weighty purpose in them , if the chairman ’s face were any index to the character of their contents . The progress of Mr Nadgett ’s secret satisfaction arising out of the effect they made , kept pace with the emotions of the reader . At first , Mr Nadgett sat with his spectacles low down upon his nose , looking over them at his employer , and nervously rubbing his hands . After a little while , he changed his posture in his chair for one of greater ease , and leisurely perused the next document he held ready as if an occasional glance at his employer ’s face were now enough and all occasion for anxiety or doubt were gone . And finally he rose and looked out of the window , where he stood with a triumphant air until Tigg Montague had finished . ‘
300531	300541	300528	300529	Mr Nadgett	535	’ said that gentleman , drawing a long breath . ‘
300550	300551	300558	300559	Mr Nadgett	535	’ ‘
300561	300562	300563	300563	I	0	’ ‘
300572	300582	300588	300588	sir	864	’ he returned as he gathered up his papers . ‘
300590	300591	300599	300600	Mr Nadgett	535	’ ‘
300602	300606	300626	300626	I	0	’ Nadgett bowed . ‘
300641	300642	300626	300626	I	0	’ ‘
300657	300677	300722	300723	Mr Nadgett	535	’ replied Nadgett , as he tied the string about his pocket - book , and put it up . ‘
300699	300700	300722	300723	Mr Nadgett	535	’ ‘
300706	300710	300750	300750	you	535	’ Tigg retorted . ‘
300769	300828	300835	300835	I	0	’ Mr Nadgett softly raised the sash , and peered out from the very corner , as a man might who was looking down into a street from whence a brisk discharge of musketry might be expected at any moment . Drawing in his head with equal caution , he observed , not altering his voice or manner : ‘
300833	300834	300835	300835	I	0	’ ‘
300839	300843	300852	300852	you	535	’ Tigg retorted . ‘
300848	300849	300922	300922	you	535	’ ‘
300871	300912	300936	300937	the Lord	6784	’ It was remarkable how pale and flurried he had become in an instant . There was nothing to account for it . His eye had fallen on his razors ; but what of them ! Mr Chuzzlewit was announced . ‘
300939	300948	301064	301064	My	0	’ he added in a whisper to himself : ‘
300957	301063	301066	301066	Chuzzlewit	219	’ Saying this , he hurriedly took up a couple of hair - brushes , and began to exercise them on his own head , as if his toilet had not been interrupted . Mr Nadgett withdrew to the stove , in which there was a small fire for the convenience of heating curling - irons ; and taking advantage of so favourable an opportunity for drying his pocket - handkerchief , produced it without loss of time . There he stood , during the whole interview , holding it before the bars , and sometimes , but not often , glancing over his shoulder . ‘
301068	301076	301109	301109	Ecod	351	’ cried Montague , as Jonas entered . ‘
301107	301108	301109	301109	Ecod	351	’ ‘
301111	301131	301182	301184	A light sleeper	6789	’ said Jonas , with an air of langour and ill - humour , as he took a chair , ‘
301180	301181	301182	301184	A light sleeper	6789	’ ‘
301186	301191	301224	301224	Hallo	635	’ cried his friend . ‘
301222	301223	301224	301224	Hallo	635	’ ‘
301226	301230	301251	301251	he	6789	’ said Jonas , ‘

301272	301273	301276	301276	He	6789	’ ‘
301285	301289	301296	301296	he	6789	’ said Jonas . ‘

301310	301314	301337	301337	He	6789	’ said Tigg . ‘
301342	301350	301381	301381	He	6789	’ said Tigg , raising his voice , ‘
301379	301380	301381	301381	He	6789	’ ‘
301384	301388	301409	301409	He	6789	’ replied Jonas ; ‘

301425	301429	301485	301485	You	6795	’ said Tigg , ‘
301444	301484	301497	301497	you	6795	’ He had as little occasion for a towel as Jonas had for a start . But Nadgett brought it quickly ; and , having lingered for a moment , fell back upon his old post by the fire . ‘
301492	301496	301516	301516	I	0	’ resumed Tigg , ‘
301514	301515	301528	301528	I	0	’ ‘
301523	301527	301556	301556	I	0	’ said Jonas . ‘
301540	301555	301556	301556	I	0	’ he added , muttering an oath , and rubbing them upon his handkerchief . ‘

301575	301580	301581	301581	They	6797	’ replied his friend . ‘

301645	301649	301700	301703	Hang a light sleeper	6802	’ said Tigg . ‘

301705	301710	301700	301703	Hang a light sleeper	6802	’ exclaimed Jonas pettishly . ‘
301715	301719	301730	301732	A light sleeper	6789	’ interrupted Tigg . ‘
301728	301729	301730	301732	A light sleeper	6789	’ ‘
301739	301747	301730	301732	A light sleeper	6789	’ said Jonas in his sulky way ; ‘

301770	301774	301805	301805	I	0	’ said Tigg , ‘
301808	301821	301857	301857	I	0	’ They were silent for a little time . Then Jonas spoke : ‘

301872	301876	301857	301857	I	0	’ cried Tigg . ‘

301892	301896	302028	302028	I	0	’ retorted Jonas , ‘

302042	302045	302058	302058	Jonas	219	‘ No ! ’
302053	302056	302058	302058	Jonas	219	‘ No ! ’

302117	302144	302265	302265	Tigg	519	’ interrupted Jonas , who became more coarse and quarrelsome as the other remonstrated , which may have been a part of Mr Montague ’s intention ; ‘
302178	302251	302265	302265	Tigg	519	’m not a - going to stand it , as it is now . If you should take it into your honourable head to go abroad with the bank , I do n’t see much to prevent you . Well ! That wo n’t do . I ’ve had some very good dinners here , but they ’d come too dear on such terms ; and therefore , that wo n’t do . ’
302252	302263	302265	302265	Tigg	519	‘ I am unfortunate to find you in this humour , ’
302274	302305	302315	302315	Jonas	219	‘ for I was going to propose to you -- for your own advantage ; solely for your own advantage -- that you should venture a little more with us . ’
302306	302313	302315	302315	Jonas	219	‘ Was you , by G-- ? ’
302322	302329	302380	302380	you	519	‘ Yes . And to suggest , ’
302333	302363	302380	302380	you	519	‘ that surely you have friends ; indeed , I know you have ; who would answer our purpose admirably , and whom we should be delighted to receive . ’
302364	302376	302389	302389	I	0	‘ How kind of you ! You ’d be delighted to receive ‘
302382	302388	302389	302389	I	0	’ said Jonas , bantering . ‘

302409	302413	302464	302464	Montague	519	’ said Jonas ; ‘

302452	302462	302464	302464	Montague	519	‘ It will be very much to your advantage , ’
302478	302492	302503	302503	Jonas	219	‘ It will be very much to your advantage , I assure you . ’
302493	302501	302503	302503	Jonas	219	‘ And you can tell me how , ’

302511	302518	302532	302532	Jonas	219	‘ SHALL I tell you how ? ’
302523	302530	302532	302532	Jonas	219	‘ I think you had better , ’
302534	302562	302568	302568	Montague	519	‘ Strange things have been done in the Assurance way before now , by strange sorts of men , and I mean to take care of myself . ’

But ours , as you say , my good friend , is a strange way ; and we strangely happen , sometimes , to come into the knowledge of very strange events . ’
302870	302876	302877	302877	he	519	‘ You ’ll not object , ’

302972	302979	302899	302899	His	519	‘ Yes , he has money . ’
302980	302996	302899	302899	His	519	‘ Shall I leave Mr Pecksniff to you ? Will you undertake for Mr Pecksniff . ’
302997	303008	302899	302899	His	519	‘ I ’ll try . I ’ll do my best . ’
303009	303014	302899	302899	His	519	‘ A thousand thanks , ’
303025	303041	303425	303425	she	6828	‘ Shall we walk downstairs ? Mr Nadgett ! Follow us , if you please . ’
303440	303442	303476	303477	his sister	2116	‘ chops ’
303466	303474	303476	303477	his sister	2116	‘ I do n’t know , Tom , ’
303481	303506	303532	303532	Tom	638	‘ I am not quite confident , but I think I could make a beef - steak pudding , if I tried , Tom . ’
303507	303530	303570	303571	his sister	2116	‘ In the whole catalogue of cookery , there is nothing I should like so much as a beef - steak pudding ! ’
303546	303569	303620	303620	she	6828	‘ Yes , dear , that ’s excellent ! But if it should happen not to come quite right the first time , ’
303574	303614	303661	303661	Tom	638	‘ if it should happen not to be a pudding exactly , but should turn out a stew , or a soup , or something of that sort , you ’ll not be vexed , Tom , will you ? ’
303656	303659	303661	303661	Tom	638	‘ Why , ’
303662	303723	303740	303741	his sister	2116	‘ this is capital . It gives us a new , and quite an uncommon interest in the dinner . We put into a lottery for a beefsteak pudding , and it is impossible to say what we may get . We may make some wonderful discovery , perhaps , and produce such a dish as never was known before . ’
303724	303738	303740	303741	his sister	2116	‘ I shall not be at all surprised if we do , Tom , ’
303747	303814	303825	303825	Tom	638	‘ or if it should prove to be such a dish as we shall not feel very anxious to produce again ; but the meat must come out of the saucepan at last , somehow or other , you know . We ca n’t cook it into nothing at all ; that ’s a great comfort . So if you like to venture , I will . ’
303815	303823	303825	303825	Tom	638	‘ I have not the least doubt , ’
303827	303884	304412	304412	he	638	‘ that it will come out an excellent pudding , or at all events , I am sure that I shall think it so . There is naturally something so handy and brisk about you , Ruth , that if you said you could make a bowl of faultless turtle soup , I should believe you . ’
304407	304411	304412	304412	he	638	‘ for meat , ’
304418	304426	304539	304539	her	2116	‘ must be humoured , not drove . ’
304525	304533	304556	304556	Tom	638	‘ What are you writing , Tom ? ’
304545	304554	304556	304556	Tom	638	‘ Why , you see , my dear , ’
304571	304621	304643	304643	her	2116	‘ I am very anxious , of course , to obtain some suitable employment ; and before Mr Westlock comes this afternoon , I think I may as well prepare a little description of myself and my qualifications ; such as he could show to any friend of his . ’
304622	304636	304643	304643	her	2116	‘ You had better do the same for me , Tom , also , ’
304646	304674	304556	304556	Tom	638	‘ I should dearly like to keep house for you and take care of you always , Tom ; but we are not rich enough for that . ’
304675	304681	304556	304556	Tom	638	‘ We are not rich , ’
304685	304773	304643	304643	her	2116	‘ certainly ; and we may be much poorer . But we will not part if we can help it . No , no ; we will make up our minds Ruth , that unless we are so very unfortunate as to render me quite sure that you would be better off away from me than with me , we will battle it out together . I am certain we shall be happier if we can battle it out together . Do n’t you think we shall ? ’
304774	304779	304789	304789	Tom	638	‘ Think , Tom ! ’
304780	304787	304789	304789	Tom	638	‘ Oh , tut , tut ! ’
304793	304799	304643	304643	her	2116	‘ You must n’t cry . ’
304800	304826	304836	304836	Tom	638	‘ No , no ; I wo n’t , Tom . But you ca n’t afford it , dear . You ca n’t , indeed . ’
304827	304834	304836	304836	Tom	638	‘ We do n’t know that , ’
304838	304894	304643	304643	her	2116	‘ How are we to know that , yet awhile , and without trying ? Lord bless my soul!’--Tom ’s energy became quite grand--‘there is no knowing what may happen , if we try hard . And I am sure we can live contentedly upon a very little -- if we can only get it . ’
304895	304907	304915	304915	Tom	638	‘ Yes ; that I am sure we can , Tom . ’
304908	304913	304998	304998	Tom	638	‘ Why , then , ’
304917	304996	304998	304998	Tom	638	‘ we must try for it . My friend , John Westlock , is a capital fellow , and very shrewd and intelligent . I ’ll take his advice . We ’ll talk it over with him -- both of us together . You ’ll like John very much , when you come to know him , I am certain . Do n’t cry , do n’t cry . YOU make a beef - steak pudding , indeed ! ’
305006	305018	305102	305102	she	6860	‘ Why , you have n’t boldness enough for a dumpling ! ’
305019	305036	305056	305056	Tom	638	‘ You WILL call it a pudding , Tom . Mind ! I told you not ! ’
305037	305054	305056	305056	Tom	638	‘ I may as well call it that , till it proves to be something else , ’
305058	305072	305413	305413	Tom	638	‘ Oh , you are going to work in earnest , are you ? ’
305423	305434	305482	305482	she	6860	‘ A respectable young man , aged thirty - five , ’
305478	305481	305482	305482	she	6860	‘ Tom , ’
305491	305494	305501	305501	Tom	638	‘ Tom ! ’
305495	305499	305501	305501	Tom	638	‘ What now ? ’
305507	305513	305527	305527	he	638	‘ aged thirty - five ! ’
305514	305524	305560	305563	his busy little sister	6867	‘ Will you look here a moment , please ? ’
305536	305558	305578	305578	Tom	638	‘ I am going to begin , Tom . Do n’t you wonder why I butter the inside of the basin ? ’
305565	305576	305578	305578	Tom	638	‘ Not more than you do , I dare say , ’
305582	305594	305560	305563	his busy little sister	6867	‘ For I believe you do n’t know anything about it . ’
305595	305638	305651	305651	Tom	638	‘ What an infidel you are , Tom ! How else do you think it would turn out easily when it was done ! For a civil - engineer and land - surveyor not to know that ! My goodness , Tom ! ’
305654	305664	305885	305885	Tom	638	‘ respectable young man , aged thirty - five ; ’
305877	305883	305901	305901	she	6867	‘ Where ’s the pudding ? ’
305897	305900	305901	305901	she	6867	‘ Where ! ’
305911	305916	305924	305924	Tom	638	‘ Look at it ! ’
305917	305922	305924	305924	Tom	638	‘ THAT a pudding ! ’
305926	305941	306002	306003	John Westlock	247	‘ It WILL be , you stupid fellow , when it ’s covered in , ’
306008	306022	306030	306030	John--	639	‘ Why , my goodness , John ! How did YOU come in ? ’
306023	306028	306084	306084	John	247	‘ I beg pardon , ’
306031	306082	306084	306084	John	247	’ your sister ’s pardon especially -- but I met an old lady at the street door , who requested me to enter here ; and as you did n’t hear me knock , and the door was open , I made bold to do so . I hardly know , ’
306090	306135	306143	306143	Tom	638	‘ why any of us should be disconcerted at my having accidentally intruded upon such an agreeable domestic occupation , so very agreeably and skillfully pursued ; but I must confess that I am . Tom , will you kindly come to my relief ? ’
306136	306141	306143	306143	Tom	638	‘ Mr John Westlock , ’
306145	306149	306166	306166	John	247	‘ My sister . ’
306150	306164	306166	306166	John	247	‘ I hope that , as the sister of so old a friend , ’
306169	306187	306208	306208	Tom	638	‘ you will have the goodness to detach your first impressions of me from my unfortunate entrance . ’
306188	306206	306315	306315	Tom	638	‘ My sister is not indisposed perhaps to say the same to you on her own behalf , ’
306305	306313	306315	306315	Tom	638	‘ I am delighted to see you , ’
306317	306321	306336	306337	his friend	9006	‘ Sit down . ’
306322	306334	306336	306337	his friend	9006	‘ I can only think of sitting down on one condition , ’
306339	306360	306371	306371	Tom	638	‘ and that is , that your sister goes on with the pudding , as if you were still alone . ’
306361	306369	306371	306371	Tom	638	‘ That I am sure she will , ’
306373	306393	306479	306479	she	6876	‘ On one other condition , and that is , that you stay and help us to eat it . ’
306491	306536	306544	306544	Tom	638	‘ I am here much earlier than I intended , Tom ; but I will tell you , what brings me , and I think I can answer for your being glad to hear it . Is that anything you wish to show me ? ’
306537	306542	306479	306479	she	6876	‘ Oh dear no ! ’
306567	306589	306620	306620	Tom	638	‘ “ A respectable young man , aged thirty - five”--The beginning of a description of myself . That ’s all . ’
306590	306619	306649	306649	Tom	638	‘ I do n’t think you will have occasion to finish it , Tom . But how is it you never told me you had friends in London ? ’
306642	306647	306656	306656	Westlock	247	‘ Friends in London ! ’
306651	306654	306656	306656	Westlock	247	‘ Ah ! ’
306658	306663	306679	306679	Tom	638	‘ to be sure . ’
306664	306677	306656	306656	Westlock	247	‘ Have YOU any friends in London , Ruth , my dear ! ’
306681	306686	306700	306700	Tom	638	‘ No , Tom . ’
306687	306698	306700	306700	Tom	638	‘ I am very happy to hear that I have , ’
306702	306727	306737	306738	the other	934	‘ but it ’s news to me . I never knew it . They must be capital people to keep a secret , John . ’
306728	306735	306737	306738	the other	934	‘ You shall judge for yourself , ’
306740	306771	306789	306789	Tom	638	‘ Seriously , Tom , here is the plain state of the case . As I was sitting at breakfast this morning , there comes a knock at my door . ’
306772	306787	306789	306789	Tom	638	‘ On which you cried out , very loud , “ Come in ! ” ’
306791	306905	306944	306944	he	247	‘ So I did . And the person who knocked , not being a respectable young man , aged thirty - five , from the country , came in when he was invited , instead of standing gaping and staring about him on the landing . Well ! When he came in , I found he was a stranger ; a grave , business - like , sedate - looking , stranger . “ Mr Westlock ? ” said he . “ That is my name , ” said I. “ The favour of a few words with you ? ” said he . “ Pray be seated , sir , ” said I. ’
306947	306956	306962	306962	Tom	638	‘ The pudding having taken a chair , Tom-- ’
306957	306960	306962	306962	Tom	638	‘ What ! ’
306964	306970	306944	306944	he	247	‘ Having taken a chair . ’
306971	306977	306985	306985	John	247	‘ You said a pudding . ’
306978	306983	306985	306985	John	247	‘ No , no , ’
306990	307051	307059	307059	His	6881	‘ a chair . The idea of a stranger coming into my rooms at half - past eight o’clock in the morning , and taking a pudding ! Having taken a chair , Tom , a chair -- amazed me by opening the conversation thus : “ I believe you are acquainted , sir , with Mr Thomas Pinch ? ” ‘
307054	307058	307127	307127	you	6882	’ cried Tom . ‘
307130	307131	307127	307127	you	6882	’ ‘
307134	307142	307203	307203	Tom	249	’ said Tom , nodding his head . ‘
307185	307202	307216	307216	Tom	249	’ “ Then , ” said he , “ I think I can accommodate him . ” ’
307209	307214	307216	307216	Tom	249	‘ Lord bless me ! ’
307218	307232	307242	307243	John Westlock	247	‘ Ruth , my dear , “ think I can accommodate him . ” ’
307233	307240	307261	307261	himself	249	‘ Of course I begged him , ’
307263	307383	307391	307391	Tom	249	‘ to proceed , and said that I would undertake to see you immediately . He replied that he had very little to say , being a man of few words , but such as it was , it was to the purpose -- and so , indeed , it turned out -- for he immediately went on to tell me that a friend of his was in want of a kind of secretary and librarian ; and that although the salary was small , being only a hundred pounds a year , with neither board nor lodging , still the duties were not heavy , and there the post was . Vacant , and ready for your acceptance . ’
307384	307389	307391	307391	Tom	249	‘ Good gracious me ! ’
307393	307415	307427	307428	John Westlock	247	‘ a hundred pounds a year ! My dear John ! Ruth , my love ! A hundred pounds a year ! ’
307416	307425	307427	307428	John Westlock	247	‘ But the strangest part of the story , ’
307451	307481	307489	307489	Tom	638	‘ the strangest part of the story , Miss Pinch , is this . I do n’t know this man from Adam ; neither does this man know Tom . ’
307482	307487	307489	307489	Tom	638	‘ He ca n’t , ’
307495	307511	307519	307519	John	247	‘ if he ’s a Londoner . I do n’t know any one in London . ’
307512	307518	307519	307519	John	247	‘ And on my observing , ’
307531	307607	307620	307620	Tom	638	‘ that I had no doubt he would excuse the freedom I took in inquiring who directed him to me ; how he came to know of the change which had taken place in my friend ’s position ; and how he came to be acquainted with my friend ’s peculiar fitness for such an office as he had described ; he drily said that he was not at liberty to enter into any explanations . ’
307608	307618	307640	307640	John	247	‘ Not at liberty to enter into any explanations ! ’
307627	307639	307640	307640	John	247	‘ “ I must be perfectly aware , ” he said , ’
307643	307680	307688	307688	Tom	249	‘ “ that to any person who had ever been in Mr Pecksniff ’s neighbourhood , Mr Thomas Pinch and his acquirements were as well known as the Church steeple , or the Blue Dragon . ” ’
307681	307686	307802	307802	Tom	249	‘ The Blue Dragon ! ’
307699	307801	307843	307844	his friend	9006	‘ Aye , think of that ! He spoke as familiarly of the Blue Dragon , I give you my word , as if he had been Mark Tapley . I opened my eyes , I can tell you , when he did so ; but I could not fancy I had ever seen the man before , although he said with a smile , “ You know the Blue Dragon , Mr Westlock ; you kept it up there , once or twice , yourself . ” Kept it up there ! So I did . You remember , Tom ? ’
307839	307842	307843	307844	his friend	9006	‘ Unaccountable ? ’
307847	307909	307916	307916	Tom	249	‘ I became afraid of the man . Though it was broad day , and bright sunshine , I was positively afraid of him . I declare I half suspected him to be a supernatural visitor , and not a mortal , until he took out a common - place description of pocket - book , and handed me this card . ’
307910	307914	307916	307916	Tom	249	‘ Mr Fips , ’
307922	307933	307944	307944	John	247	‘ Austin Friars . Austin Friars sounds ghostly , John . ’
307934	307942	307985	307985	Tom	249	‘ Fips do n’t , I think , ’
307948	307984	308070	308070	Ruth	638	‘ But there he lives , Tom , and there he expects us to call this morning . And now you know as much of this strange incident as I do , upon my honour . ’
308065	308068	308070	308070	Ruth	638	‘ Tom , ’
308077	308098	308106	308106	John	247	‘ perhaps Mr Westlock , in his friendship for you , knows more of this than he chooses to tell . ’
308099	308104	308106	308106	John	247	‘ No , indeed ! ’
308110	308165	308180	308180	Ruth	638	‘ It is not so , I assure you . I wish it were . I can not take credit to myself , Miss Pinch , for any such thing . All that I know , or , so far as I can judge , am likely to know , I have told you . ’
308166	308178	308194	308194	John	247	‘ Could n’t you know more , if you thought proper ? ’
308189	308192	308194	308194	John	247	‘ No , ’
308196	308232	308481	308481	he	638	‘ Indeed , no . It is very ungenerous in you to be so suspicious of me when I repose implicit faith in you . I have unbounded confidence in the pudding , Miss Pinch . ’
308477	308480	308481	308481	he	638	‘ Tom , ’
308490	308502	308510	308510	Tom	638	‘ I begin to think you must be somebody ’s son . ’
308503	308509	308513	308513	his	638	‘ I suppose I am , ’
308517	308526	308534	308534	Tom	638	‘ But I mean somebody ’s of consequence . ’
308527	308532	308513	308513	his	638	‘ Bless your heart , ’
308536	308550	308513	308513	his	638	‘ my poor father was of no consequence , nor my mother either . ’
308551	308559	308513	308513	his	638	‘ You remember them perfectly , then ? ’
308560	308621	308628	308628	John	247	‘ Remember them ? oh dear yes . My poor mother was the last . She died when Ruth was a mere baby , and then we both became a charge upon the savings of that good old grandmother I used to tell you of . You remember ! Oh ! There ’s nothing romantic in our history , John . ’

308633	308656	308832	308832	somebody	924	‘ Then there is no way of accounting for my visitor of this morning . So we ’ll not try , Tom . ’
308850	308854	308860	308860	John	247	‘ rather dark . ’
308855	308859	308860	308860	John	247	‘ Dark indeed , ’
308868	308886	308946	308947	Mr Fips	640	‘ Not a bad place to dispose of a countryman in , I should think , Tom . ’
308940	308944	309018	309019	John Westlock	247	‘ Walk in , ’
309005	309016	309029	309030	Mr Fips	640	‘ I have brought my friend Mr Pinch , sir , ’
309021	309027	309155	309155	John	247	‘ Be pleased to sit , ’
309161	309175	309197	309197	Tom	249	‘ And you think it worth your while , sir , do you ? ’
309182	309195	309197	309197	Tom	249	‘ I think it a piece of great good fortune , sir , ’
309199	309210	309218	309219	Mr Fips	640	‘ I am exceedingly obliged to you for the offer . ’
309211	309216	309218	309219	Mr Fips	640	‘ Not to me , ’
309221	309227	309239	309239	Tom	249	‘ I act upon instructions . ’
309228	309237	309239	309239	Tom	249	‘ To your friend , sir , then , ’
309241	309308	309239	309239	Tom	249	‘ To the gentleman with whom I am to engage , and whose confidence I shall endeavour to deserve . When he knows me better , sir , I hope he will not lose his good opinion of me . He will find me punctual and vigilant , and anxious to do what is right . That I think I can answer for , and so , ’
309313	309318	309325	309325	John	247	‘ can Mr Westlock . ’
309319	309323	309370	309371	Mr Fips	640	‘ Most assuredly , ’
309363	309368	309370	309371	Mr Fips	640	‘ The fact is , ’
309373	309388	309433	309433	he	249	‘ that my friend is not , at this present moment , in town . ’
309419	309432	309458	309458	Fips	640	‘ When do you think he will be in town , sir ? ’
309436	309456	309483	309483	Tom	249	‘ I ca n’t say ; it ’s impossible to tell . I really have no idea . But , ’
309485	309499	309519	309520	Mr Fips	640	‘ I do n’t know that it ’s a matter of much consequence . ’
309513	309517	309576	309577	Mr Fips	640	‘ I say , ’
309522	309574	309626	309626	he	640	‘ that I do n’t know it ’s a matter of much consequence . The business lies entirely between yourself and me , Mr Pinch . With reference to your duties , I can set you going ; and with reference to your salary , I can pay it . Weekly , ’
309597	309619	309652	309652	Tom	249	‘ weekly ; in this office ; at any time between the hours of four and five o’clock in the afternoon . ’
309644	309650	309652	309652	Tom	249	‘ You are very good , ’
309662	309677	309696	309697	Mr Fips	640	‘ and nothing can be more satisfactory or straightforward . My attendance will be required-- ’
309678	309694	309696	309697	Mr Fips	640	‘ From half - past nine to four o’clock or so , I should say , ’
309699	309703	309716	309716	Tom	249	‘ About that . ’
309704	309714	309716	309716	Tom	249	‘ I did not mean the hours of attendance , ’
309718	309733	309748	309748	Tom	249	‘ which are light and easy , I am sure ; but the place . ’
309734	309747	309757	309758	Mr Fips	640	‘ Oh , the place ! The place is in the Temple . ’
309752	309755	309757	309758	Mr Fips	640	‘ Perhaps , ’
309760	309769	309777	309777	Tom	249	‘ you would like to see the place ? ’
309770	309775	309819	309820	Mr Fips	640	‘ Oh , dear ! ’
309779	309805	309819	309820	Mr Fips	640	‘ I shall only be too glad to consider myself engaged , if you will allow me ; without any further reference to the place . ’
309806	309817	309819	309820	Mr Fips	640	‘ You may consider yourself engaged , by all means , ’
309822	309849	309859	309860	Mr Fips	640	‘ you could n’t meet me at the Temple Gate in Fleet Street , in an hour from this time , I suppose , could you ? ’
309854	309857	309859	309860	Mr Fips	640	‘ Good , ’
309864	309915	310201	310201	he	640	‘ Then I will show you the place ; and you can begin your attendance to - morrow morning . In an hour , therefore , I shall see you . You too , Mr Westlock ? Very good . Take care how you go . It ’s rather dark . ’
310190	310200	310201	310201	he	640	‘ You had better have a little plug made , ’
310221	310255	310330	310331	Mr Fips	640	‘ It ’s the only way of preventing them from getting stopped up . You ’ll find the lock go the better , too , I dare say , for a little oil . ’
310323	310328	310330	310331	Mr Fips	640	‘ Aye , aye ! ’
310333	310341	310712	310713	Mr Fips	640	‘ The dust lies rather thick here . ’
310719	310760	310712	310713	Mr Fips	640	‘ Before anything else can be done , we must have them put in order , catalogued , and ranged upon the book - shelves , Mr Pinch . That will do to begin with , I think , sir . ’
310781	310803	310809	310809	Fips	640	‘ An occupation full of interest for me , I assure you . It will occupy me , perhaps , until Mr-- ’
310804	310807	310838	310838	Tom	249	‘ Until Mr-- ’
310823	310836	310845	310846	Mr Fips	640	‘ I forgot that you had not mentioned the gentleman ’s name , ’
310840	310843	311009	311009	He	6936	‘ Oh ! ’
310853	311008	311060	311060	Tom	249	‘ did n’t I ? No , by - the - bye , I do n’t think I did . Ah ! I dare say he ’ll be here soon . You will get on very well together , I have no doubt . I wish you success I am sure . You wo n’t forget to shut the door ? It ’ll lock of itself if you slam it . Half - past nine , you know . Let us say from half - past nine to four , or half - past four , or thereabouts ; one day , perhaps , a little earlier , another day , perhaps , a little later , according as you feel disposed , and as you arrange your work . Mr Fips , Austin Friars of course you ’ll remember ? And you wo n’t forget to slam the door , if you please ! ’
311051	311058	311072	311073	John Westlock	247	‘ Why , he ’s gone ! ’
311062	311070	311076	311076	himself	247	‘ And what ’s more , Tom , ’
311091	311114	311387	311387	he	247	‘ he is evidently not coming back again ; so here you are , installed . Under rather singular circumstances , Tom ! ’
311400	311408	311565	311565	his	249	‘ Mr Fips , of Austin Friars . ’
311409	311470	311482	311482	Tom	249	‘ After all , Tom , I begin to think it lies no deeper than this . Fips is an eccentric man ; has some knowledge of Pecksniff ; despises him , of course ; has heard or seen enough of you to know that you are the man he wants ; and engages you in his own whimsical manner . ’
311471	311480	311520	311520	Tom	249	‘ But why in his own whimsical manner ? ’
311484	311519	312205	312205	Ruth	638	‘ Oh ! why does any man entertain his own whimsical taste ? Why does Mr Fips wear shorts and powder , and Mr Fips ’s next - door neighbour boots and a wig ? ’
312208	312213	313614	313614	he	249	‘ Oh ! indeed ! ’
313622	313635	313859	313873	a man , who struck him as having anything uncommon in his dress or aspect	7030	‘ Now I am coming face to face with him at last ! ’
313875	313888	313983	313983	he	640	‘ I should n’t wonder , now , if that were he ! ’
313986	314006	314041	314042	Mr Fips	640	‘ Oh ! by the bye , Mr Pinch , you need n’t mention it , if you please ! ’
314044	314048	314068	314068	Tom	249	‘ Very good , ’
314060	314066	314070	314071	Mr Fips	640	‘ Not on any account , ’
314074	314078	314070	314071	Mr Fips	640	‘ Very good . ’
314079	314087	314070	314071	Mr Fips	640	‘ You were going to say’--Tom hinted . ‘
314092	314096	314112	314112	I	0	’ cried Fips . ‘
314101	314111	314140	314140	I	0	’ However , seeing Tom confused , he added , ‘
314138	314139	314170	314170	you	249	’ ‘
314154	314167	314170	314170	you	249	’ observed Tom , putting his week ’s salary in his pocket . ‘
314172	314176	314194	314194	him	7036	’ said Fips . ‘
314187	314188	314194	314194	him	7036	’ ‘
314213	314217	314194	314194	him	7036	’ faltered Tom . ‘
314221	314230	314249	314249	I	0	’ said Mr Fips , with a yawn . ‘
314237	314248	314249	314249	I	0	’ Tom hastily resolved to try him on another tack . ‘
314258	314262	314194	314194	him	7036	’ he said . ‘
314279	314280	314194	314194	him	7036	’ ‘
314285	314289	314611	314611	they	7039	’ retorted Fips . ‘
314311	314609	315155	315155	they	7039	’ This was the very utmost extent of information Tom could ever get out of HIM . So it was dark enough in all conscience ; and if Mr Fips expressed himself with a double meaning , he had good reason for doing so . But now a circumstance occurred , which helped to divert Tom ’s thoughts from even this mystery , and to divide them between it and a new channel , which was a very Nile in itself . The way it came about was this . Having always been an early riser and having now no organ to engage him in sweet converse every morning , it was his habit to take a long walk before going to the Temple ; and naturally inclining , as a stranger , towards those parts of the town which were conspicuous for the life and animation pervading them , he became a great frequenter of the market - places , bridges , quays , and especially the steam - boat wharves ; for it was very lively and fresh to see the people hurrying away upon their many schemes of business or pleasure , and it made Tom glad to think that there was that much change and freedom in the monotonous routine of city lives . In most of these morning excursions Ruth accompanied him . As their landlord was always up and away at his business ( whatever that might be , no one seemed to know ) at a very early hour , the habits of the people of the house in which they lodged corresponded with their own . Thus they had often finished their breakfast , and were out in the summer air , by seven o’clock . After a two hours ’
315181	315188	315208	315208	I	0	‘ Come along do make haste I ’m
315209	315215	315291	315291	you	7074	’m off directly come along ! ’
315266	315281	315704	315709	a very ill - natured person	7076	‘ oh here ’s a stoppage what ’s the matter do go on there I ’m
315301	315702	315704	315709	a very ill - natured person	7076	’ and so , in a state of mind bordering on distraction , would be last seen drifting slowly through the mist into the summer light beyond , that made it red . Tom ’s ship , however ; or , at least , the packet - boat in which Tom and his sister took the greatest interest on one particular occasion ; was not off yet , by any means ; but was at the height of its disorder . The press of passengers was very great ; another steam - boat lay on each side of her ; the gangways were choked up ; distracted women , obviously bound for Gravesend , but turning a deaf ear to all representations that this particular vessel was about to sail for Antwerp , persisted in secreting baskets of refreshments behind bulk - heads , and water - casks , and under seats ; and very great confusion prevailed . It was so amusing , that Tom , with Ruth upon his arm , stood looking down from the wharf , as nearly regardless as it was in the nature of flesh and blood to be , of an elderly lady behind him , who had brought a large umbrella with her , and did n’t know what to do with it . This tremendous instrument had a hooked handle ; and its vicinity was first made known to him by a painful pressure on the windpipe , consequent upon its having caught him round the throat . Soon after disengaging himself with perfect good humour , he had a sensation of the ferule in his back ; immediately afterwards , of the hook entangling his ankles ; then of the umbrella generally , wandering about his hat , and flapping at it like a great bird ; and , lastly , of a poke or thrust below the ribs , which give him such exceeding anguish , that he could not refrain from turning round to offer a mild remonstrance . Upon his turning round , he found the owner of the umbrella struggling on tip - toe , with a countenance expressive of violent animosity , to look down upon the steam - boats ; from which he inferred that she had attacked him , standing in the front row , by design , and as her natural enemy . ‘
315714	315724	315770	315770	she	7077	’ said Tom . The lady cried out fiercely , ‘
315773	315787	315762	315762	she	7077	‘ If they greased their whiskers less , and minded the duties which they ’re
315797	315801	315879	315879	I	0	’ she observed , ‘
315813	315878	315879	315879	I	0	’ She had been grievously knocked about , no doubt , for her bonnet was bent into the shape of a cocked hat . Being a fat little woman , too , she was in a state of great exhaustion and intense heat . Instead of pursuing the altercation , therefore , Tom civilly inquired what boat she wanted to go on board of ? ‘
315882	315887	315912	315912	they	7085	’ returned the lady , ‘
315916	315917	315912	315912	they	7085	’ ‘
315928	315932	315912	315912	they	7085	’ said Tom . ‘
315951	315952	315975	315975	they	7085	’ ‘
315965	315973	315975	315975	they	7085	’ returned the lady , somewhat softened , ‘
315976	315995	316062	316062	Lord	7089	’re a many in their numbers , ever brought it as a charge again myself that I was anythin ’
316065	316135	316152	316152	me	0	’ By this time , Mrs Gamp ( for it was no other than that experienced practitioner ) had , with Tom ’s assistance , squeezed and worked herself into a small corner between Ruth and the rail ; where , after breathing very hard for some little time , and performing a short series of dangerous evolutions with her umbrella , she managed to establish herself pretty comfortably . ‘
316154	316159	316163	316163	you	0	’ cried Mrs Gamp . ‘
316166	316170	316163	316163	you	0	’ asked Ruth . ‘
316175	316180	316192	316192	I	0	’ Mrs Gamp replied . ‘
316194	316195	316192	316192	I	0	’ ‘
316205	316209	316220	316220	I	0	’ said Ruth . ‘
316223	316306	316220	316220	I	0	’ cried Mrs Gamp ; appearing to confound the prophet with the whale in this miraculous aspiration . Ruth said nothing in reply ; but , as Mrs Gamp , laying her chin against the cool iron of the rail , continued to look intently at the Antwerp boat , and every now and then to give a little groan , she inquired whether any child of hers was going aboard that morning ? Or perhaps her husband , she said kindly . ‘
316310	316320	316362	316363	Mrs Harris	422	’ said Mrs Gamp , casting up her eyes , ‘
316374	316432	316568	316568	Mine	7101	’ round by the tobacker shop , “ Oh Sairey , Sairey , little do we know wot lays afore us ! ” “ Mrs Harris , ma’am , ” I says , “ not much , it ’s true , but more than you suppoge . Our calcilations , ma’am , ” I says , “ respectin ’
316535	316557	316568	316568	Mine	7101	’ in a bedstead unbeknown . Therefore , ma’am , ” I says , “ seek not to proticipate , but take ‘
316570	316575	316568	316568	Mine	7101	’ says Mrs Gamp , ‘
316609	316617	316639	316639	she	7101	’ into wine vaults , and never comin ’
316620	316637	316677	316678	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ till fetched by force , was quite as weak as flesh , if not weaker . ’
316670	316675	316677	316678	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ I would n’t , ’
316680	316707	316741	316742	that lady	9988	‘ I would n’t be a man and have such a think upon my mind!--but nobody as owned the name of man , could do it ! ’
316735	316739	316745	316745	her	9988	‘ My dear , ’
316748	316757	316758	316758	Ruth	638	‘ you are single , ai n’t you ? ’
316764	316767	316774	316775	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Yes . ’
316768	316772	316774	316775	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Worse luck , ’
316777	316803	316829	316829	She	7101	‘ for all parties ! But others is married , and in the marriage state ; and there is a dear young creetur a - comin ’
316807	316828	316903	316904	Mrs Gamp	223	’ to that very package , which is no more fit to trust herself to sea , than nothin’ is ! ’
316895	316901	316907	316907	her	223	‘ Oh , drat you ! ’
316912	316914	316950	316950	your	7111	‘ you ’re
316971	316981	316950	316950	your	7111	’ said Mrs Gamp , shaking her umbrella again , ‘
317003	317089	317116	317116	you	7116	‘ em ( especially them screeching railroad ones ) , than all the other frights that ever was took . I have heerd of one young man , a guard upon a railway , only three years opened -- well does Mrs Harris know him , which indeed he is her own relation by her sister ’s marriage with a master sawyer -- as is godfather at this present time to six - and - twenty blessed little strangers , equally unexpected , and all on ‘
317102	317111	317206	317206	she	7120	’ said Mrs Gamp , resuming her apostrophe , ‘
317140	317204	317216	317216	she	7120	’ It would not have been unnatural to suppose , from the first part of Mrs Gamp ’s lamentations , that she was connected with the stage - coaching or post - horsing trade . She had no means of judging of the effect of her concluding remarks upon her young companion ; for she interrupted herself at this point , and exclaimed : ‘
317238	317245	317260	317260	She	7120	’ said Mrs Gamp , prophetically , ‘
317252	317259	317300	317300	she	7120	’m the witness for the persecution . ’
317291	317299	317300	317300	she	7120	‘ Pray , which is the lady , ’
317303	317312	317318	317319	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ in whom you are so much interested ? ’
317313	317316	317318	317319	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ There ! ’
317321	317329	317300	317300	she	7120	‘ There she goes ! A - crossin ’
317343	317350	317300	317300	she	7120	’ on a bit of orangepeel ! ’
317356	317364	317318	317319	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ What a turn it give me . ’
317365	317395	317404	317405	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Do you mean the lady who is with that man wrapped up from head to foot in a large cloak , so that his face is almost hidden ? ’
317396	317403	317404	317405	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Well he may hide it ! ’
317408	317432	317318	317319	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ He ’s good call to be ashamed of himself . Did you see him a - jerking of her wrist , then ? ’
317433	317444	317462	317463	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ He seems to be hasty with her , indeed . ’
317445	317460	317462	317463	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Now he ’s a - taking of her down into the close cabin ! ’
317467	317494	317716	317716	he	638	‘ What ’s the man about ! The deuce is in him , I think . Why ca n’t he leave her in the open air ? ’
317706	317715	317716	317716	he	638	‘ I beg your pardon , Mr Pinch , ’
317722	317785	317844	317844	Tom	249	‘ I am rather infirm , and out of breath , and my eyes are not very good . I am not as young as I was , sir . You do n’t see a gentleman in a large cloak down yonder , with a lady on his arm ; a lady in a veil and a black shawl ; do you ? ’
317834	317842	317844	317844	Tom	249	‘ A gentleman in a large cloak ! ’
317846	317859	317867	317868	the other	934	‘ and a lady in a black shawl ! Let me see ! ’
317860	317865	317920	317920	he	934	‘ Yes , yes ! ’
317874	317919	317920	317920	he	934	‘ A gentleman muffled up from head to foot -- strangely muffled up for such a morning as this -- like an invalid , with his hand to his face at this minute , perhaps . No , no , no ! not there , ’
317928	317940	317992	317992	Tom	249	‘ the other way ; in that direction ; down yonder . ’
317973	317990	317992	317992	Tom	249	‘ There are so many people , and so much motion , and so many objects , ’
317994	318035	318045	318046	his landlord	10941	‘ that I find it difficult to -- no , I really do n’t see a gentleman in a large cloak , and a lady in a black shawl . There ’s a lady in a red shawl over there ! ’
318036	318043	318045	318046	his landlord	10941	‘ No , no , no ! ’
318052	318102	318108	318108	Tom	249	‘ not there . The other way ; the other way . Look at the cabin steps . To the left . They must be near the cabin steps . Do you see the cabin steps ? There ’s the bell ringing already ! DO you see the steps ? ’
318103	318106	318108	318108	Tom	249	‘ Stay ! ’
318110	318112	318148	318150	The very man	5120	‘ you ’re
318146	318147	318148	318150	The very man	5120	’ ‘
318152	318174	318254	318254	you	10941	’ returned the other , not looking at what Tom pointed out , however , but at Tom ’s own face . ‘
318266	318548	318549	318549	I	0	’ His hands shook , and his face bespoke the utmost interest and agitation , as he pressed the letter upon Tom , and pointed to its destination , like the Tempter in some grim old carving . To hesitate in the performance of a good - natured or compassionate office was not in Tom ’s way . He took the letter ; whispered Ruth to wait till he returned , which would be immediately ; and ran down the steps with all the expedition he could make . There were so many people going down , so many others coming up , such heavy goods in course of transit to and fro , such a ringing of bell , blowing - off of steam , and shouting of men ’s voices , that he had much ado to force his way , or keep in mind to which boat he was going . But he reached the right one with good speed , and going down the cabin - stairs immediately , described the object of his search standing at the upper end of the saloon , with his back towards him , reading some notice which was hung against the wall . As Tom advanced to give him the letter , he started , hearing footsteps , and turned round . What was Tom ’s astonishment to find in him the man with whom he had had the conflict in the field -- poor Mercy ’s husband . Jonas ! Tom understood him to say , what the devil did he want ; but it was not easy to make out what he said ; he spoke so indistinctly . ‘
318557	318561	318707	318707	I	0	’ said Tom ; ‘
318597	318697	318705	318705	I	0	’ He did so , opened it , and read the writing on the inside . The contents were evidently very brief ; not more perhaps than one line ; but they struck upon him like a stone from a sling . He reeled back as he read . His emotion was so different from any Tom had ever seen before that he stopped involuntarily . Momentary as his state of indecision was , the bell ceased while he stood there , and a hoarse voice calling down the steps , inquired if there was any to go ashore ? ‘
318700	318704	318717	318718	that woman	13980	’ cried Jonas , ‘
318727	318786	318799	318799	We	7147	’ He threw open another door as he spoke , and dragged , rather than led , her forth . She was pale and frightened , and amazed to see her old acquaintance ; but had no time to speak , for they were making a great stir above ; and Jonas drew her rapidly towards the deck . ‘
318797	318798	318809	318809	I	0	’ ‘
318804	318808	318844	318844	We	7147	’ said Jonas . ‘
318845	318855	318844	318844	We	7147	’re for the shore . Do you hear ? We ’re
318860	318970	319044	319044	Chuzzlewit	219	’ He turned , even in the madness of his hurry , and scowling darkly back at Tom , shook his clenched hand at him . There are not many human faces capable of the expression with which he accompanied that gesture . He dragged her up , and Tom followed them . Across the deck , over the side , along the crazy plank , and up the steps , he dragged her fiercely ; not bestowing any look on her , but gazing upwards all the while among the faces on the wharf . Suddenly he turned again , and said to Tom with a tremendous oath : ‘
318975	319043	319044	319044	Chuzzlewit	219	’ Before Tom , in his indignation and amazement , could return an answer to a question he so little understood , a gentleman approached Tom behind , and saluted Jonas Chuzzlewit by name . He has a gentleman of foreign appearance , with a black moustache and whiskers ; and addressed him with a polite composure , strangely different from his own distracted and desperate manner . ‘
319050	319064	319134	319134	you	219	’ said the gentleman , raising his hat in compliment to Mrs Chuzzlewit , ‘
319138	319139	319142	319143	Mr Montague	521	’ ‘
319145	319156	319192	319193	the beehive	7155	’ said Jonas , whom the words appeared to choke . ‘
319169	319174	319198	319198	You	219	’ pursued that gentleman , ‘
319213	319220	319198	319198	You	219	’ Jonas maintained a dogged silence . ‘
319225	319229	319276	319280	a very singular old female	7163	’ cried Montague , ‘
319287	319303	319313	319313	anybody	9018	’ said Montague , breaking off in his discourse , and looking at Mrs Gamp , ‘
319317	319318	319322	319322	they	9018	’ ‘
319331	319336	319357	319358	every one	1357	’ said Mrs Gamp , ‘
319339	319355	319418	319418	she	7163	’ your own merry one , sir , and long may it be so ! Wishin ’
319359	319373	319418	319418	she	7163	’ ( she delivered this in the form of a toast or sentiment ) ‘
319383	319416	319426	319426	she	7163	’ , as a little bird has whispered me a certain gent is , which I will not name for fear I give offence where none is doo ! My precious lady , ’
319436	319438	319418	319418	she	7163	‘ you ’re
319444	319445	319452	319452	you	7167	’ ‘
319454	319458	319452	319452	you	7167	’ muttered Jonas . ‘
319467	319468	319452	319452	you	7167	’ ‘
319474	319484	319452	319452	you	7167	’ returned Mrs Gamp , dropping an indignant curtsey , ‘
319498	319674	319828	319829	Mrs Gamp	223	’ down upon a public wharf . Which was the very words she says to me ( although they was the last I ever had to speak ) was these : “ Sairey , ” she says , “ is it a public wharf ? ” “ Mrs Harris , ” I makes answer , “ can you doubt it ? You have know’d me now , ma’am , eight and thirty year ; and did you ever know me go , or wish to go , where I was not made welcome , say the words . ” “ No , Sairey , ” Mrs Harris says , “ contrairy quite . ” And well she knows it too . I am but a poor woman , but I ’ve been sought after , sir , though you may not think it . I ’ve been knocked up at all hours of the night , and warned out by a many landlords , in consequence of being mistook for Fire . I goes out workin ’
319679	319827	319904	319904	he	7170	‘ tis true , but I maintains my independency , with your kind leave , and which I will till death . I has my feelins as a woman , sir , and I have been a mother likeways ; but touch a pipkin as belongs to me , or make the least remarks on what I eats or drinks , and though you was the favouritest young for’ard hussy of a servant - gal as ever come into a house , either you leaves the place , or me . My earnins is not great , sir , but I will not be impoged upon . Bless the babe , and save the mother , is my mortar , sir ; but I makes so free as add to that , Do n’t try no impogician with the Nuss , for she will not abear it ! ’
319897	319903	319904	319904	he	7170	‘ As you ARE here , ’
319907	319925	319960	319960	Montague	521	‘ you had better see to her , and take her home . I am otherwise engaged . ’
319949	319958	319994	319994	Montague	521	‘ I am sorry to take you away , ’
319984	319992	319994	319994	Montague	521	‘ I am , upon my life , ’
319996	320004	320013	320013	Jonas	516	‘ Why did you make it necessary ? ’
320022	320038	320372	320372	she	317	‘ The necessity is none of my making . You have brought it about yourself . ’
320366	320371	320412	320412	she	317	‘ What is it ? ’
320375	320411	320412	320412	she	317	‘ Good heaven , what is it ? Why did he tell me last night to prepare for a long journey , and why have you brought us back like criminals ? Dear Mr Pinch ! ’
320418	320439	320452	320452	Tom	249	‘ be merciful to us . Whatever this dreadful secret is , be merciful , and God will bless you ! ’
320440	320450	320452	320452	Tom	249	‘ If any power of mercy lay with me , ’
320454	320476	321075	321075	Chuzzlewit	219	‘ trust me , you should n’t ask in vain . But I am far more ignorant and weak than you . ’
320670	321069	321075	321075	Chuzzlewit	219	’ duration , without provoking a remark from either ; for it was clear that Jonas did not mean to break the silence which prevailed between them , and that it was not , as yet , his dear friend ’s cue to tempt them into conversation . He had thrown aside his cloak , as having now no motive for concealment , and with that garment huddled on his knees , sat as far removed from his companion as the limited space in such a carriage would allow . There was a striking difference in his manner , compared with what it had been , within a few minutes , when Tom encountered him so unexpectedly on board the packet , or when the ugly change had fallen on him in Mr Montague ’s dressing - room . He had the aspect of a man found out and held at bay ; of being baffled , hunted , and beset ; but there was now a dawning and increasing purpose in his face , which changed it very much . It was gloomy , distrustful , lowering ; pale with anger and defeat ; it still was humbled , abject , cowardly and mean ; but , let the conflict go on as it would , there was one strong purpose wrestling with every emotion of his mind , and casting the whole series down as they arose . Not prepossessing in appearance at the best of times , it may be readily supposed that he was not so now . He had left deep marks of his front teeth in his nether lip ; and those tokens of the agitation he had lately undergone improved his looks as little as the heavy corrugations in his forehead . But he was self - possessed now ; unnaturally self - possessed , indeed , as men quite otherwise than brave are known to be in desperate extremities ; and when the carriage stopped , he waited for no invitation , but leapt hardily out , and went upstairs . The chairman followed him ; and closing the board - room door as soon as they had entered , threw himself upon a sofa . Jonas stood before the window , looking down into the street ; and leaned against the sash , resting his head upon his arms . ‘
321077	321083	321075	321075	Chuzzlewit	219	’ said Montague at length . ‘
321090	321091	321094	321094	you	0	’ ‘
321099	321107	321110	321110	you	0	’ he answered , looking round abruptly ; ‘
321113	321114	321133	321133	Ecod	351	’ ‘
321124	321132	321135	321135	You	351	’ said Montague in an injured tone . ‘
321142	321146	321149	321149	you	351	’ retorted Jonas . ‘
321151	321152	321149	321149	you	351	’ ‘
321157	321177	321220	321220	you	351	’ said his companion , raising his head , and looking at him , but he had turned again . ‘
321216	321217	321233	321233	Who	7194	’ ‘
321231	321232	321286	321286	you	351	’ ‘
321290	321291	321292	321292	I	0	’ ‘
321296	321300	321292	321292	I	0	’ said Jonas , ‘
321305	321306	321307	321307	You	351	’ ‘
321311	321336	321339	321339	Chuzzlewit	219	’ rejoined his friend . Jonas stood quite silent ; still looking down into the street , and resting his head upon his arms . ‘
321341	321345	321374	321374	you	219	’ said Montague , ‘
321370	321371	321381	321381	I	0	’ ‘
321379	321380	321398	321398	You	219	’ ‘

321477	321478	321480	321480	you	219	’ ‘
321485	321499	321480	321480	you	219	’ said Jonas , looking fiercely round , and glancing at the door . ‘
321504	321508	321709	321709	you	0	’ said Montague . ‘
321705	321706	321709	321709	you	0	’ ‘
321716	321728	321709	321709	you	0	’ asked Jonas , who had not yet changed his attitude . ‘
321731	321739	321740	321740	We	7203	’ said Montague , with a laugh . ‘
321747	321748	321762	321762	you	0	’ ‘
321765	321766	321762	321762	you	0	’ ‘
321769	321770	321771	321771	Ecod	351	’ ‘
321773	321779	321791	321791	You	219	’ muttered Jonas , bitterly . ‘
321797	321798	321830	321830	You	219	’ ‘
321825	321829	322129	322129	you	219	’ said Montague . ‘
322139	322211	322129	322129	you	219	’ Jonas left the window , and walked up close to him . He did not look him in the face ; it was not his habit to do that ; but he kept his eyes towards him -- on his breast , or thereabouts -- and was at great pains to speak slowly and distinctly in reply . Just as a man in a state of conscious drunkenness might be . ‘
322219	322223	322224	322224	I	0	’ he said . ‘
322243	322244	322224	322224	I	0	’ ‘
322253	322257	322275	322275	I	0	’ replied Montague . ‘
322280	322281	322297	322297	you	219	’ ‘
322286	322296	322557	322557	Your	7218	’ pursued Jonas , with a still greater effort , ‘
322377	322556	322557	322557	Your	7218	’ If he had raised his eyes to his companion ’s face , he would have seen that Montague was evidently unable to comprehend his meaning . But continuing to stand before him , with his furtive gaze directed as before , and pausing here only to moisten his dry lips with his tongue , the fact was lost upon him . It might have struck a close observer that this fixed and steady glance of Jonas ’s was a part of the alteration which had taken place in his demeanour . He kept it riveted on one spot , with which his thoughts had manifestly nothing to do ; like as a juggler walking on a cord or wire to any dangerous end , holds some object in his sight to steady him , and never wanders from it , lest he trip . Montague was quick in his rejoinder , though he made it at a venture . There was no difference of opinion between him and his friend on THAT point . Not the least . ‘
322561	322579	322593	322593	I	0	’ Jonas proceeded , with a savage sneer that got the better of him for the moment , ‘
322597	322604	322612	322612	Tigg	519	’m no worse than other men . ’
322605	322610	322612	322612	Tigg	519	‘ Not a bit , ’
322614	322620	322630	322630	I	0	‘ Not a bit . We ’re

322636	322643	322661	322661	My	0	’ Jonas went on to say ; ‘
322659	322660	322661	322661	My	0	’ ‘
322664	322668	322661	322661	My	0	’ repeated Montague . ‘
322671	322678	322661	322661	My	0	’ returned the other , gruffly . ‘
322694	322695	322661	322661	My	0	’ ‘
322698	322707	322719	322719	I	0	’ said Montague , without the smallest hesitation . ‘
322726	322756	322812	322812	He	0	’ Now , for the first time , Jonas looked at him . After a pause , he put out his hand , and said , with a laugh : ‘
322767	322811	322818	322818	he	0	’m yours . I do n’t know that I may not be better off here , after all , than if I had gone away this morning . But here I am , and here I ’ll stay now . Take your oath ! ’
322829	322841	322847	322847	Montague	519	‘ Shall I go to Pecksniff ? When ? Say when ! ’
322842	322845	322818	322818	he	0	‘ Immediately ! ’
322849	322858	322864	322864	Jonas	219	‘ He can not be enticed too soon . ’
322859	322862	322818	322818	he	0	‘ Ecod ! ’
322871	322893	322901	322901	Montague	519	‘ There ’s some fun in catching that old hypocrite . I hate him . Shall I go to - night ? ’
322894	322899	322901	322901	Montague	519	‘ Aye ! This , ’
322905	322928	322936	322936	Jonas	219	‘ is like business ! We understand each other now ! To - night , my good fellow , by all means . ’
322929	322934	322936	322936	Jonas	219	‘ Come with me , ’
322938	323008	323042	323042	Jonas	219	‘ We must make a dash ; go down in state , and carry documents , for he ’s a deep file to deal with , and must be drawn on with an artful hand , or he ’ll not follow . I know him . As I ca n’t take your lodgings or your dinners down , I must take you . Will you come to - night ? ’
323030	323040	323042	323042	Jonas	219	‘ We can concert our plans upon the road , ’
323044	323097	323109	323109	Montague	519	‘ We must not go direct to him , but cross over from some other place , and turn out of our way to see him . I may not want to introduce you , but I must have you on the spot . I know the man , I tell you . ’
323098	323107	323121	323121	Jonas	219	‘ But what if the man knows me ? ’
323115	323119	323121	323121	Jonas	219	‘ He know ! ’
323123	323257	323265	323265	Montague	519	‘ Do n’t you run that risk with fifty men a day ! Would your father know you ? Did I know you ? Ecod ! You were another figure when I saw you first . Ha , ha , ha ! I see the rents and patches now ! No false hair then , no black dye ! You were another sort of joker in those days , you were ! You even spoke different then . You ’ve acted the gentleman so seriously since , that you ’ve taken in yourself . If he should know you , what does it matter ? Such a change is a proof of your success . You know that , or you would not have made yourself known to me . Will you come ? ’
323258	323263	323265	323265	Montague	519	‘ My good fellow , ’
323270	323277	323306	323306	He	519	‘ I can trust you alone . ’
323278	323305	323306	323306	He	519	‘ Trust me ! Ecod , you may trust me now , far enough . I ’ll try to go away no more -- no more ! ’
323317	323330	323337	323337	Montague	519	‘ I ca n’t get on without you . Will you come ? ’
323331	323335	323337	323337	Montague	519	‘ I will , ’
323339	323346	323697	323697	he	219	‘ if that ’s your opinion . ’
323702	323707	323800	323801	Mr Nadgett	535	‘ she had better ; ’
323805	323830	323857	323857	he	219	‘ No , but he believed it must be his way as he had been charged with much the same kind of thing before . ’
323875	323884	323893	323893	Nadgett	535	‘ Who gave him my letter this morning ? ’
323885	323891	323893	323893	Nadgett	535	‘ My lodger , sir , ’
323902	323908	323857	323857	he	219	‘ How came that about ? ’
323909	323965	323977	323977	Montague	521	‘ I found him on the wharf , sir . Being so much hurried , and you not arrived , it was necessary to do something . It fortunately occurred to me , that if I gave it him myself I could be of no further use . I should have been blown upon immediately . ’
323966	323975	323977	323977	Montague	521	‘ Mr Nadgett , you are a jewel , ’
323985	323993	324003	324003	Montague	521	‘ What ’s your lodger ’s name ? ’
323994	324002	324003	324003	Montague	521	‘ Pinch , sir . Thomas Pinch . ’
324014	324023	324035	324035	They	7235	‘ From the country , do you know ? ’
324024	324034	324185	324186	the doctor	11836	‘ From Wiltshire , sir , he told me . ’
324159	324183	324185	324186	the doctor	11836	‘ And you are bound for all our sakes to take particular care of your digestion , Mr Chuzzlewit , my dear sir , ’
324196	324301	324316	324316	he	526	‘ for depend upon it , it is worth preserving . It must be in admirable condition , sir ; perfect chronometer - work . Otherwise your spirits could not be so remarkable . Your bosom ’s lord sits lightly on its throne , Mr Chuzzlewit , as what’s - his - name says in the play . I wish he said it in a play which did anything like common justice to our profession , by the bye . There is an apothecary in that drama , sir , which is a low thing ; vulgar , sir ; out of nature altogether . ’
324321	324335	324377	324378	the doctor	11836	‘ This is what I call nature in a medical man , sir ; ’
324372	324375	324377	324378	the doctor	11836	‘ Ah ! ’
324386	324390	324444	324444	doctor	5250	‘ I always take ‘
324412	324440	324453	324453	Ye	219	’ Jonas had opened one of the shining little instruments ; and was scrutinizing it with a look as sharp and eager as its own bright edge . ‘
324451	324452	324453	324453	Ye	219	’ ‘
324457	324469	324480	324481	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ replied the doctor , with the faltering modesty of ownership . ‘
324483	324484	324495	324495	I	0	’ ‘
324498	324509	324535	324535	I	0	’ said Jonas looking at it with a growing interest . ‘
324541	324568	324537	324537	I	0	’ replied the doctor , coughing as if the matter - of - fact were so very dry and literal that he could n’t help it . ‘
324575	324589	324593	324593	you	5250	’ repeated the doctor , putting another glass of wine to his lips . ‘
324606	324610	324617	324617	you	5250	’ demanded Jonas . ‘
324625	324630	324617	324617	you	5250	’ returned the doctor . ‘
324637	324638	324617	324617	you	5250	’ ‘
324648	324659	324617	324617	you	5250	’ cried Jonas , bending forward to look at it . ‘
324662	324667	324617	324617	you	5250	’ said the doctor ; ‘
324673	324719	324617	324617	you	5250	’ Jonas , in his vivacity , made a sudden sawing in the air , so close behind the doctor ’s jugular that he turned quite red . Then Jonas ( in the same strange spirit of vivacity ) burst into a loud discordant laugh . ‘
324724	324733	324617	324617	you	5250	’ said the doctor , shaking his head ; ‘
324743	324801	324807	324807	Jonas	219	‘ em . A very remarkable instance of the skillful use of edge - tools , by the way , occurs to me at this moment . It was a case of murder . I am afraid it was a case of murder , committed by a member of our profession ; it was so artistically done . ’
324802	324805	324807	324807	Jonas	219	‘ Aye ! ’
324809	324814	324822	324822	Jobling	526	‘ How was that ? ’
324815	324820	324822	324822	Jobling	526	‘ Why , sir , ’
324824	324904	324914	324914	Jonas	219	‘ the thing lies in a nutshell . A certain gentleman was found , one morning , in an obscure street , lying in an angle of a doorway -- I should rather say , leaning , in an upright position , in the angle of a doorway , and supported consequently by the doorway . Upon his waistcoat there was one solitary drop of blood . He was dead and cold ; and had been murdered , sir . ’
324905	324912	324924	324925	the doctor	11836	‘ Only one drop of blood ! ’
324916	324922	324924	324925	the doctor	11836	‘ Sir , that man , ’
324927	325030	325039	325039	Jonas	219	‘ had been stabbed to the heart . Had been stabbed to the heart with such dexterity , sir , that he had died instantly , and had bled internally . It was supposed that a medical friend of his ( to whom suspicion attached ) had engaged him in conversation on some pretence ; had taken him , very likely , by the button in a conversational manner ; had examined his ground at leisure with his other hand ; had marked the exact spot ; drawn out the instrument , whatever it was , when he was quite prepared ; and-- ’
325031	325037	325047	325048	the doctor	11836	‘ And done the trick , ’
325041	325045	325047	325048	the doctor	11836	‘ Exactly so , ’
325050	325185	325392	325392	he	219	‘ It was quite an operation in its way , and very neat . The medical friend never turned up ; and , as I tell you , he had the credit of it . Whether he did it or not I ca n’t say . But , having had the honour to be called in with two or three of my professional brethren on the occasion , and having assisted to make a careful examination of the wound , I have no hesitation in saying that it would have reflected credit on any medical man ; and that in an unprofessional person it could not but be considered , either as an extraordinary work of art , or the result of a still more extraordinary , happy , and favourable conjunction of circumstances . ’
325373	325387	325395	325396	Mr Bailey	329	‘ Out of the way , Tom Thumb , and get to bed ! ’
325415	325422	325395	325396	Mr Bailey	329	‘ To bed , sir ! I ’m
325429	325461	325395	325396	Mr Bailey	329	’ said Bailey . He alighted quickly , and walked back into the hall , where Montague was lighting a cigar ; conducting Mr Bailey with him , by the collar . ‘
325479	325480	325395	325396	Mr Bailey	329	’ ‘
325483	325573	325395	325396	Mr Bailey	329	’ said Montague . He gave the boy a shake , and threw him roughly aside . There was more of his familiar self in the action , than in anything he had done that day ; but he broke out laughing immediately afterwards , and making a thrust at the doctor with his hand , in imitation of his representation of the medical friend , went out to the carriage again , and took his seat . His companion followed immediately . Mr Bailey climbed into the rumble . ‘
325581	326377	326882	326882	Jonas	219	’ exclaimed the doctor , as they started . CHAPTER FORTY - TWO CONTINUATION OF THE ENTERPRISE OF MR JONAS AND HIS FRIEND The doctor ’s prognostication in reference to the weather was speedily verified . Although the weather was not a patient of his , and no third party had required him to give an opinion on the case , the quick fulfilment of his prophecy may be taken as an instance of his professional tact ; for , unless the threatening aspect of the night had been perfectly plain and unmistakable , Mr Jobling would never have compromised his reputation by delivering any sentiments on the subject . He used this principle in Medicine with too much success to be unmindful of it in his commonest transactions . It was one of those hot , silent nights , when people sit at windows listening for the thunder which they know will shortly break ; when they recall dismal tales of hurricanes and earthquakes ; and of lonely travellers on open plains , and lonely ships at sea , struck by lightning . Lightning flashed and quivered on the black horizon even now ; and hollow murmurings were in the wind , as though it had been blowing where the thunder rolled , and still was charged with its exhausted echoes . But the storm , though gathering swiftly , had not yet come up ; and the prevailing stillness was the more solemn , from the dull intelligence that seemed to hover in the air , of noise and conflict afar off . It was very dark ; but in the murky sky there were masses of cloud which shone with a lurid light , like monstrous heaps of copper that had been heated in a furnace , and were growing cold . These had been advancing steadily and slowly , but they were now motionless , or nearly so . As the carriage clattered round the corners of the streets , it passed at every one a knot of persons who had come there -- many from their houses close at hand , without hats -- to look up at that quarter of the sky . And now a very few large drops of rain began to fall , and thunder rumbled in the distance . Jonas sat in a corner of the carriage with his bottle resting on his knee , and gripped as tightly in his hand as if he would have ground its neck to powder if he could . Instinctively attracted by the night , he had laid aside the pack of cards upon the cushion ; and with the same involuntary impulse , so intelligible to both of them as not to occasion a remark on either side , his companion had extinguished the lamp . The front glasses were down ; and they sat looking silently out upon the gloomy scene before them . They were clear of London , or as clear of it as travellers can be whose way lies on the Western Road , within a stage of that enormous city . Occasionally they encountered a foot - passenger , hurrying to the nearest place of shelter ; or some unwieldy cart proceeding onward at a heavy trot , with the same end in view . Little clusters of such vehicles were gathered round the stable - yard or baiting - place of every wayside tavern ; while their drivers watched the weather from the doors and open windows , or made merry within . Everywhere the people were disposed to bear each other company rather than sit alone ; so that groups of watchful faces seemed to be looking out upon the night AND THEM , from almost every house they passed . It may appear strange that this should have disturbed Jonas , or rendered him uneasy ; but it did . After muttering to himself , and often changing his position , he drew up the blind on his side of the carriage , and turned his shoulder sulkily towards it . But he neither looked at his companion , nor broke the silence which prevailed between them , and which had fallen so suddenly upon himself , by addressing a word to him . The thunder rolled , the lightning flashed ; the rain poured down like Heaven ’s wrath . Surrounded at one moment by intolerable light , and at the next by pitchy darkness , they still pressed forward on their journey . Even when they arrived at the end of the stage , and might have tarried , they did not ; but ordered horses out immediately . Nor had this any reference to some five minutes ’
326874	326880	326882	326882	Jonas	219	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’
326884	326897	326905	326906	the other	934	‘ Is that your general way of waking out of your sleep ? ’
326898	326903	326905	326906	the other	934	‘ I could swear , ’
326908	326917	326927	326927	Jonas	219	‘ that I have not closed my eyes ! ’
326918	326925	326927	326927	Jonas	219	‘ When you have sworn it , ’
326931	326947	326988	326988	Montague	521	‘ we had better go on again , if you have only stopped for that . ’
326971	326986	326988	326988	Montague	521	‘ I wish we had never started on this journey . This is not , ’
327003	327013	327040	327040	you	934	‘ this is not a night to travel in . ’
327014	327018	327040	327040	you	934	‘ Ecod ! you ’re
327022	327026	327113	327113	him	934	’ returned Jonas , ‘
327071	327111	327121	327121	I	0	’ His companion put his head out of window for a moment , and drawing it in again , observed ( as if that were his cause of anxiety ) , that the boy was drenched to the skin . ‘
327116	327120	327159	327160	the other	934	’ said Jonas . ‘
327122	327145	327159	327160	the other	934	’m glad of it . What the devil are we stopping for ? Are you going to spread him out to dry ? ’
327146	327157	327172	327172	Jonas	219	‘ I have half a mind to take him inside , ’
327165	327170	327231	327231	he	219	‘ Oh ! thankee ! ’
327174	327230	327231	327231	he	219	‘ We do n’t want any damp boys here ; especially a young imp like him . Let him be where he is . He ai n’t afraid of a little thunder and lightning , I dare say ; whoever else is . Go on , driver . We had better have HIM inside perhaps , ’
327237	327242	327252	327252	Montague	521	‘ and the horses ! ’
327243	327250	327252	327252	Montague	521	‘ Do n’t go too fast , ’
327257	327277	327433	327433	you	219	‘ and take care how you go . You were nearly in the ditch when I called to you . ’
327400	327402	327433	327433	you	219	‘ You ’re
327414	327421	327439	327439	Ecod	351	’ said Montague with an effort , ‘
327437	327438	327441	327441	I	0	’ ‘
327448	327478	327573	327573	I	0	’ cried Jonas , shading his eyes , for the moment , from the lightning which was flashing , not in any one direction , but all around them . ‘
327553	327572	327924	327924	he	7283	’ he added with an oath , as he stopped short in a kind of wonder at himself . ‘
327638	327922	327924	327924	he	7283	’ His mirth was of such a savage and extraordinary character , and was , in an inexplicable way , at once so suited to the night , and yet such a coarse intrusion on its terrors , that his fellow - traveller , always a coward , shrunk from him in positive fear . Instead of Jonas being his tool and instrument , their places seemed to be reversed . But there was reason for this too , Montague thought ; since the sense of his debasement might naturally inspire such a man with the wish to assert a noisy independence , and in that licence to forget his real condition . Being quick enough , in reference to such subjects of contemplation , he was not long in taking this argument into account and giving it its full weight . But still , he felt a vague sense of alarm , and was depressed and uneasy . He was certain he had not been asleep ; but his eyes might have deceived him ; for , looking at Jonas now in any interval of darkness , he could represent his figure to himself in any attitude his state of mind suggested . On the other hand , he knew full well that Jonas had no reason to love him ; and even taking the piece of pantomime which had so impressed his mind to be a real gesture , and not the working of his fancy , the most that could be said of it was , that it was quite in keeping with the rest of his diabolical fun , and had the same impotent expression of truth in it . ‘
327932	327937	327924	327924	he	7283	’ thought the swindler , ‘
327944	328013	328029	328029	I	0	’ He resolved that when he should have had his use of Jonas , he would restrain him with an iron curb ; in the meantime , that he could not do better than leave him to take his own way , and preserve his own peculiar description of good - humour , after his own uncommon manner . It was no great sacrifice to bear with him ; ‘
328024	328028	328462	328462	his	7286	’ thought Montague , ‘
328048	328452	328536	328536	Jonas	415	’ Such were his reflections from hour to hour ; his state of mind being one in which the same thoughts constantly present themselves over and over again in wearisome repetition ; while Jonas , who appeared to have dismissed reflection altogether , entertained himself as before . They agreed that they would go to Salisbury , and would cross to Mr Pecksniff ’s in the morning ; and at the prospect of deluding that worthy gentleman , the spirits of his amiable son - in - law became more boisterous than ever . As the night wore on , the thunder died away , but still rolled gloomily and mournfully in the distance . The lightning too , though now comparatively harmless , was yet bright and frequent . The rain was quite as violent as it had ever been . It was their ill - fortune , at about the time of dawn and in the last stage of their journey , to have a restive pair of horses . These animals had been greatly terrified in their stable by the tempest ; and coming out into the dreary interval between night and morning , when the glare of the lightning was yet unsubdued by day , and the various objects in their view were presented in indistinct and exaggerated shapes which they would not have worn by night , they gradually became less and less capable of control ; until , taking a sudden fright at something by the roadside , they dashed off wildly down a steep hill , flung the driver from his saddle , drew the carriage to the brink of a ditch , stumbled headlong down , and threw it crashing over . The travellers had opened the carriage door , and had either jumped or fallen out . Jonas was the first to stagger to his feet . He felt sick and weak , and very giddy , and reeling to a five - barred gate , stood holding by it ; looking drowsily about as the whole landscape swam before his eyes . But , by degrees , he grew more conscious , and presently observed that Montague was lying senseless in the road , within a few feet of the horses . In an instant , as if his own faint body were suddenly animated by a demon , he ran to the horses ’
328531	328534	328536	328536	Jonas	415	‘ Whoop ! ’
328538	328560	328592	328592	Jonas	415	‘ Whoop ! again ! another ! A little more , a little more ! Up , ye devils ! Hillo ! ’
328585	328590	328602	328603	the driver	2846	‘ Hiilo ! Hillo ! ’
328594	328600	328602	328603	the driver	2846	‘ For God ’s sake ! ’
328605	328617	328733	328733	Jonas	415	‘ The gentleman -- in the road -- he’ll be killed ! ’
328722	328731	328733	328733	Jonas	415	‘ Presence of mind , presence of mind ! ’
328741	328750	328764	328765	the man	1838	‘ What would you have done without me ? ’
328751	328762	328768	328768	his	1838	‘ The other gentleman would have done badly without ME , ’
328771	328786	328800	328800	Jonas	415	‘ You should have moved him first . I gave him up for dead . ’
328787	328798	328800	328800	Jonas	415	‘ Presence of mind , you croaker , presence of mind ’
328807	328816	328853	328853	Montague	521	‘ Was he struck , do you think ? ’
328845	328851	328853	328853	Montague	521	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’
328855	328860	328866	328866	Jonas	415	‘ Is anybody hurt ? ’
328861	328864	328866	328866	Jonas	415	‘ Ecod ! ’
328868	328884	328935	328935	Jonas	415	‘ it do n’t seem so . There are no bones broken , after all . ’
328926	328933	328935	328935	Jonas	415	‘ Cuts and bruises , eh ? ’
328937	328951	328984	328987	the post - boy	7300	‘ We ’ve all got them . Only cuts and bruises , eh ? ’
328952	328982	328984	328987	the post - boy	7300	‘ I would n’t have given sixpence for the gentleman ’s head in half - a - dozen seconds more , for all he ’s only cut and bruised , ’
328989	328993	329078	329078	I	0	‘ If ever you ’re
329081	329132	329140	329140	Ecod	351	’ Jonas replied by advising him with a curse to hold his tongue , and to go somewhere , whither he was not very likely to go of his own accord . But Montague , who had listened eagerly to every word , himself diverted the subject , by exclaiming : ‘
329138	329139	329144	329145	that monkey	7305	’ ‘
329147	329151	329144	329145	that monkey	7305	’ said Jonas . ‘
329158	329198	329200	329200	I	0	’ A very brief search settled that question . The unfortunate Mr Bailey had been thrown sheer over the hedge or the five - barred gate ; and was lying in the neighbouring field , to all appearance dead . ‘
329217	329222	329235	329236	this boy	7306	’ cried his master , ‘
329238	329239	329235	329236	this boy	7306	’ ‘
329244	329248	329250	329250	you	0	’ growled Jonas . ‘
329257	329258	329279	329279	you	0	’ ‘
329270	329276	329279	329279	you	0	’ asked Montague , hurriedly . ‘

329287	329297	329407	329407	You	0	’ said Jonas , stooping down over the body , ‘
329324	329406	329431	329433	post - boy	7311	’ But the boy was past holding up , or being held up , or giving any other sign of life than a faint and fitful beating of the heart . After some discussion the driver mounted the horse which had been least injured , and took the lad in his arms as well as he could ; while Montague and Jonas , leading the other horse , and carrying a trunk between them , walked by his side towards Salisbury . ‘

329480	329484	329485	329485	I	0	’ said Jonas . ‘
329492	329509	329518	329518	You	0	’ replied the other , whose looks and manner were in flat contradiction to his words . ‘
329516	329517	329518	329518	You	0	’ ‘
329530	329534	329537	329537	you	0	’ said Jonas . ‘

329562	329839	329874	329874	Chuzzlewit	219	’ As it was clear that he was not to be moved from this determination , Jonas made no other rejoinder than such as his face expressed ; and they proceeded in company . They had three or four good miles to travel ; and the way was not made easier by the state of the road , the burden by which they were embarrassed , or their own stiff and sore condition . After a sufficiently long and painful walk , they arrived at the Inn ; and having knocked the people up ( it being yet very early in the morning ) , sent out messengers to see to the carriage and its contents , and roused a surgeon from his bed to tend the chief sufferer . All the service he could render , he rendered promptly and skillfully . But he gave it as his opinion that the boy was labouring under a severe concussion of the brain , and that Mr Bailey ’s mortal course was run . If Montague ’s strong interest in the announcement could have been considered as unselfish in any degree , it might have been a redeeming trait in a character that had no such lineaments to spare . But it was not difficult to see that , for some unexpressed reason best appreciated by himself , he attached a strange value to the company and presence of this mere child . When , after receiving some assistance from the surgeon himself , he retired to the bedroom prepared for him , and it was broad day , his mind was still dwelling on this theme . ‘
329846	329850	329889	329889	I	0	’ he said , ‘
329897	329906	329874	329874	Chuzzlewit	219	’ he added , wiping his damp forehead . ‘
329919	330360	330444	330444	he	934	’ After examining his chamber , and looking under the bed , and in the cupboards , and even behind the curtains , with unusual caution ( although it was , as has been said , broad day ) , he double - locked the door by which he had entered , and retired to rest . There was another door in the room , but it was locked on the outer side ; and with what place it communicated , he knew not . His fears or evil conscience reproduced this door in all his dreams . He dreamed that a dreadful secret was connected with it ; a secret which he knew , and yet did not know , for although he was heavily responsible for it , and a party to it , he was harassed even in his vision by a distracting uncertainty in reference to its import . Incoherently entwined with this dream was another , which represented it as the hiding - place of an enemy , a shadow , a phantom ; and made it the business of his life to keep the terrible creature closed up , and prevent it from forcing its way in upon him . With this view Nadgett , and he , and a strange man with a bloody smear upon his head ( who told him that he had been his playfellow , and told him , too , the real name of an old schoolmate , forgotten until then ) , worked with iron plates and nails to make the door secure ; but though they worked never so hard , it was all in vain , for the nails broke , or changed to soft twigs , or what was worse , to worms , between their fingers ; the wood of the door splintered and crumbled , so that even nails would not remain in it ; and the iron plates curled up like hot paper . All this time the creature on the other side -- whether it was in the shape of man , or beast , he neither knew nor sought to know -- was gaining on them . But his greatest terror was when the man with the bloody smear upon his head demanded of him if he knew this creatures name , and said that he would whisper it . At this the dreamer fell upon his knees , his whole blood thrilling with inexplicable fear , and held his ears . But looking at the speaker ’s lips , he saw that they formed the utterance of the letter ‘
330362	330419	330427	330427	You	7316	’ ; and crying out aloud that the secret was discovered , and they were all lost , he awoke . Awoke to find Jonas standing at his bedside watching him . And that very door wide open . As their eyes met , Jonas retreated a few paces , and Montague sprang out of bed . ‘
330422	330426	330444	330444	he	934	’ said Jonas . ‘
330428	330434	330444	330444	he	934	’re all alive this morning . ’
330435	330438	330444	330444	he	934	‘ Alive ! ’
330452	330459	330471	330471	Jonas	219	‘ What are you doing here ? ’
330460	330469	330471	330471	Jonas	219	‘ It ’s your room to be sure , ’

330590	330594	330602	330602	I	0	’ said Jonas ; ‘
330606	330679	330602	330602	I	0	’ Montague answered in the affirmative . When Jonas had retired , whistling , through his own room , he opened the door of communication , to take out the key and fasten it on the inner side . But it was taken out already . He dragged a table against the door , and sat down to collect himself , as if his dreams still had some influence upon his mind . ‘
330684	330690	330826	330826	I	0	’ he repeated several times . ‘
330710	330825	330956	330956	me	0	’ His presentiment , or superstition , that it was an evil journey , did not at all deter him from doing the evil for which the journey was undertaken . With this in view , he dressed himself more carefully than usual to make a favourable impression on Mr Pecksniff ; and , reassured by his own appearance , the beauty of the morning , and the flashing of the wet boughs outside his window in the merry sunshine , was soon sufficiently inspirited to swear a few round oaths , and hum the fag - end of a song . But he still muttered to himself at intervals , for all that : ‘
330832	330954	331182	331182	me	0	’ CHAPTER FORTY - THREE HAS AN INFLUENCE ON THE FORTUNES OF SEVERAL PEOPLE . MR PECKSNIFF IS EXHIBITED IN THE PLENITUDE OF POWER ; AND WIELDS THE SAME WITH FORTITUDE AND MAGNANIMITY On the night of the storm , Mrs Lupin , hostess of the Blue Dragon , sat by herself in her little bar . Her solitary condition , or the bad weather , or both united , made Mrs Lupin thoughtful , not to say sorrowful . As she sat with her chin upon her hand , looking out through a low back lattice , rendered dim in the brightest day - time by clustering vine - leaves , she shook her head very often , and said , ‘
330965	331180	331189	331189	me	0	’ It was a melancholy time , even in the snugness of the Dragon bar . The rich expanse of corn - field , pasture - land , green slope , and gentle undulation , with its sparkling brooks , its many hedgerows , and its clumps of beautiful trees , was black and dreary , from the diamond panes of the lattice away to the far horizon , where the thunder seemed to roll along the hills . The heavy rain beat down the tender branches of vine and jessamine , and trampled on them in its fury ; and when the lightning gleamed it showed the tearful leaves shivering and cowering together at the window , and tapping at it urgently , as if beseeching to be sheltered from the dismal night . As a mark of her respect for the lightning , Mrs Lupin had removed her candle to the chimney - piece . Her basket of needle - work stood unheeded at her elbow ; her supper , spread on a round table not far off , was untasted ; and the knives had been removed for fear of attraction . She had sat for a long time with her chin upon her hand , saying to herself at intervals , ‘
331191	331260	331189	331189	me	0	’ She was on the eve of saying so , once more , when the latch of the house - door ( closed to keep the rain out ) , rattled on its well - worn catch , and a traveller came in , who , shutting it after him , and walking straight up to the half - door of the bar , said , rather gruffly : ‘
331270	331416	331189	331189	me	0	’ He had some reason to be gruff , for if he had passed the day in a waterfall , he could scarcely have been wetter than he was . He was wrapped up to the eyes in a rough blue sailor ’s coat , and had an oil - skin hat on , from the capacious brim of which the rain fell trickling down upon his breast , and back , and shoulders . Judging from a certain liveliness of chin -- he had so pulled down his hat , and pulled up his collar , to defend himself from the weather , that she could only see his chin , and even across that he drew the wet sleeve of his shaggy coat , as she looked at him -- Mrs Lupin set him down for a good - natured fellow , too . ‘
331421	331443	331189	331189	me	0	’ observed the hostess cheerfully . The traveller shook himself like a Newfoundland dog , and said it was , rather . ‘

331549	331611	331636	331637	the Dragon	8968	’ Mrs Lupin thanked him ; but in the act of lifting the tankard to his mouth , he changed his mind , and put it down again . Throwing his body back , and looking about him stiffly , as a man does who is wrapped up , and has his hat low down over his eyes , he said : ‘
331626	331633	331636	331637	the Dragon	8968	’ Mrs Lupin complacently made answer , ‘
331639	331640	331665	331672	a young man of the name of Tapley	7333	’ ‘
331659	331664	331695	331696	old buck	7335	’ said the traveller ; ‘

331698	331731	331823	331823	ma’am	9146	’ This was touching Mrs Lupin on a tender point . She turned to trim the candle on the chimney - piece , and said , with her back towards the traveller : ‘
331789	331817	331836	331836	He	642	’ She shook her head , and her voice trembled ; her hand must have done so too , for the light required a deal of trimming . ‘
331825	331835	331836	331836	He	642	’ asked the traveller , in a gentler voice . ‘
331839	331848	331973	331973	I	0	’ said Mrs Lupin , with increased distress , ‘
331928	331970	331973	331973	I	0	’ Quite subdued by this time , Mrs Lupin sobbed , and was retiring to a chair to give her grief free vent , when the traveller caught her in his arms , and she uttered a glad cry of recognition . ‘

332549	332686	332689	332691	the old tailor	7369	’ It would have been very unreasonable to complain of the exhibition of his patriotism with which he followed up this explanation , that it was at all lukewarm or indifferent . When he had given full expression to his nationality , he hurried off to Martin ; while Mrs Lupin , in a state of great agitation and excitement , prepared for their reception . The company soon came tumbling out ; insisting to each other that the Dragon clock was half an hour too fast , and that the thunder must have affected it . Impatient , wet , and weary though they were , Martin and Mark were overjoyed to see these old faces , and watched them with delighted interest as they departed from the house , and passed close by them . ‘
332695	332699	332763	332763	Sam	279	’ whispered Martin . ‘

333134	333342	333345	333345	I	0	’ The kitchen fire burnt clear and red , the table was spread out , the kettle boiled ; the slippers were there , the boot - jack too , sheets of ham were there , cooking on the gridiron ; half - a - dozen eggs were there , poaching in the frying - pan ; a plethoric cherry - brandy bottle was there , winking at a foaming jug of beer upon the table ; rare provisions were there , dangling from the rafters as if you had only to open your mouth , and something exquisitely ripe and good would be glad of the excuse for tumbling into it . Mrs Lupin , who for their sakes had dislodged the very cook , high priestess of the temple , with her own genial hands was dressing their repast . It was impossible to help it -- a ghost must have hugged her . The Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea being , in that respect , all one , Martin hugged her instantly . Mr Tapley ( as if the idea were quite novel , and had never occurred to him before ) , followed , with much gravity , on the same side . ‘
333349	333367	333458	333459	Mark Tapley	222	’ said Mrs Lupin , adjusting her cap and laughing heartily ; yes , and blushing too ; ‘

333732	334049	334062	334062	he	7401	’ She was so positive , that there was nothing for it but to get the supper over as quickly as possible ; and as they had been walking a great many miles , and had fasted since the middle of the day , they did no great violence to their own inclinations in falling on it tooth and nail . It took rather longer to get through than might have been expected ; for , half - a - dozen times , when they thought they had finished , Mrs Lupin exposed the fallacy of that impression triumphantly . But at last , in the course of time and nature , they gave in . Then , sitting with their slippered feet stretched out upon the kitchen hearth ( which was wonderfully comforting , for the night had grown by this time raw and chilly ) , and looking with involuntary admiration at their dimpled , buxom , blooming hostess , as the firelight sparkled in her eyes and glimmered in her raven hair , they composed themselves to listen to her news . Many were the exclamations of surprise which interrupted her , when she told them of the separation between Mr Pecksniff and his daughters , and between the same good gentleman and Mr Pinch . But these were nothing to the indignant demonstrations of Martin , when she related , as the common talk of the neighbourhood , what entire possession he had obtained over the mind and person of old Mr Chuzzlewit , and what high honour he designed for Mary . On receipt of this intelligence , Martin ’s slippers flew off in a twinkling , and he began pulling on his wet boots with that indefinite intention of going somewhere instantly , and doing something to somebody , which is the first safety - valve of a hot temper . ‘
334052	334056	334073	334073	Mark	222	’ said Martin , ‘

334533	334630	334638	334638	Martin	221	‘ if ever there was a dear , good , pleasant , worthy soul alive , Pinch , and no other , is his name . But how do we know that old Mr Chuzzlewit himself was not the cause of difference arising between him and Mr Pecksniff ? No one but themselves can tell ; for Mr Pinch has a proud spirit , though he has such a quiet way ; and when he left us , and was so sorry to go , he scorned to make his story good , even to me . ’
334631	334636	334658	334659	the landlady	9069	‘ Poor old Tom ! ’
334648	334656	334658	334659	the landlady	9069	‘ It ’s a comfort to know , ’
334661	334765	334775	334775	Martin	221	‘ that he has his sister living with him , and is doing well . Only yesterday he sent me back , by post , a little’--here the colour came into her cheeks--‘a little trifle I was bold enough to lend him when he went away ; saying , with many thanks , that he had good employment , and did n’t want it . It was the same note ; he had n’t broken it . I never thought I could have been so little pleased to see a bank - note come back to me as I was to see that . ’
334766	334773	334775	334775	Martin	221	‘ Kindly said , and heartily ! ’

334803	334840	334946	334946	sir	864	‘ which as much belongs to the Dragon as its licence . And now that we have got quite cool and fresh , to the subject again , sir ; what will you do ? If you ’re

335132	335133	335144	335147	A most pernicious willain	7423	’ ‘
335139	335143	335170	335171	Blow Pecksniff	415	’ said Martin . ‘
335173	335185	335239	335239	Pecksniff	415	’ cried Mr Tapley , in the fervour of his eloquence . ‘
335241	335250	335282	335282	he	0	’ repeated Mr Tapley , with ineffable disdain . ‘
335273	335281	335282	335282	he	0	’re not a - calculating for ourselves ; ’
335302	335304	335406	335406	I	0	‘ we ’re
335413	335456	335472	335472	I	0	’ The amazement of Mrs Lupin , and indeed of Mr Tapley himself for that matter , at this impassioned flow of language , was immense . But Martin , after looking thoughtfully at the fire for a short time , said : ‘
335477	335478	335472	335472	I	0	’ ‘
335485	335489	335573	335573	you	864	’ returned Mark . ‘
335575	335584	335636	335636	God	348	’ Mrs Lupin laughed and tossed her head . ‘
335641	335953	335958	335958	sir	864	’ Martin smiled , but felt that it was good advice notwithstanding , and resolved to act upon it . When they had ascertained from Mrs Lupin that Pecksniff had already returned from the great ceremonial at which they had beheld him in his glory ; and when they had fully arranged the order of their proceedings ; they went to bed , intent upon the morrow . In pursuance of their project as agreed upon at this discussion , Mr Tapley issued forth next morning , after breakfast , charged with a letter from Martin to his grandfather , requesting leave to wait upon him for a few minutes . And postponing as he went along the congratulations of his numerous friends until a more convenient season , he soon arrived at Mr Pecksniff ’s house . At that gentleman ’s door ; with a face so immovable that it would have been next to an impossibility for the most acute physiognomist to determine what he was thinking about , or whether he was thinking at all ; he straightway knocked . A person of Mr Tapley ’s observation could not long remain insensible to the fact that Mr Pecksniff was making the end of his nose very blunt against the glass of the parlour window , in an angular attempt to discover who had knocked at the door . Nor was Mr Tapley slow to baffle this movement on the part of the enemy , by perching himself on the top step , and presenting the crown of his hat in that direction . But possibly Mr Pecksniff had already seen him , for Mark soon heard his shoes creaking , as he advanced to open the door with his own hands . Mr Pecksniff was as cheerful as ever , and sang a little song in the passage . ‘
335960	335964	335958	335958	sir	864	’ said Mark . ‘
335967	335972	335982	335982	We	7437	’ cried Mr Pecksniff . ‘
335992	335993	335996	335996	sir	864	’ ‘
335998	336002	336048	336048	sir	864	’ said Mark . ‘
336022	336023	336048	336048	sir	864	’ ‘
336027	336032	336048	336048	sir	864	’ cried Mr Pecksniff . ‘
336039	336040	336045	336045	I	0	’ ‘
336050	336059	336068	336068	sir	864	’ said Mark , pointing out the direction . ‘

336074	336079	336097	336101	The gentleman it comes from	7444	’ returned Mr Pecksniff . ‘
336095	336096	336120	336120	him	7444	’ ‘
336109	336117	336120	336120	him	7444	’ returned Mr Tapley with extreme politeness . ‘
336136	336138	336156	336156	his	415	’ . ’
336139	336151	336178	336179	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ And he said he wanted an answer , did he ? ’
336167	336176	336225	336225	he	415	‘ He shall have an answer . Certainly , ’
336203	336223	336635	336636	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Have the goodness to give him that , with my compliments , if you please . Good morning ! ’
336627	336633	336635	336636	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ No , young man ! ’
336663	336698	336704	336704	Martin	221	‘ No , sir . None of that . Strike here , sir , here ! Launch your arrows at me , sir , if you ’ll have the goodness ; not at Him ! ’
336699	336702	336704	336704	Martin	221	‘ Grandfather ! ’
336706	336718	336730	336731	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Hear me ! I implore you , let me speak ! ’
336719	336728	336730	336731	Mr Pecksniff	415	‘ Would you , sir ? Would you ? ’
336745	336875	336881	336883	the old man	991	‘ Is it not enough , sir , that you come into my house like a thief in the night , or I should rather say , for we can never be too particular on the subject of Truth , like a thief in the day - time ; bringing your dissolute companions with you , to plant themselves with their backs against the insides of parlour doors , and prevent the entrance or issuing forth of any of my household’--Mark had taken up this position , and held it quite unmoved--‘but would you also strike at venerable Virtue ? Would you ? Know that it is not defenceless . I will be its shield , young man . Assail me . Come on , sir . Fire away ! ’
336876	336879	336881	336883	the old man	991	‘ Pecksniff , ’
336890	336897	336907	336908	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Calm yourself . Be quiet . ’
336898	336905	336907	336908	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I ca n’t be calm , ’
336910	336936	336943	336945	the old man	991	‘ and I wo n’t be quiet . My benefactor and my friend ! Shall even my house be no refuge for your hoary pillow ! ’
336937	336941	336943	336945	the old man	991	‘ Stand aside ! ’
336952	336967	336983	336984	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ and let me see what it is I used to love so dearly . ’
336968	336981	336983	336984	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ It is right that you should see it , my friend , ’
336986	337026	337194	337194	he	221	‘ It is well that you should see it , my noble sir . It is desirable that you should contemplate it in its true proportions . Behold it ! There it is , sir . There it is ! ’
337189	337193	337194	337194	he	221	‘ And that , ’
337197	337219	337231	337232	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ is he . Ah ! that is he ! Say what you wish to say . But come no nearer , ’
337220	337229	337231	337232	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ His sense of justice is so fine , ’
337234	337256	337298	337298	Martin	221	‘ that he will hear even him , although he knows beforehand that nothing can come of it . Ingenuous mind ! ’
337293	337296	337298	337298	Martin	221	‘ Grandfather ! ’
337304	337344	337353	337354	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ From a painful journey , from a hard life , from a sick - bed , from privation and distress , from gloom and disappointment , from almost hopelessness and despair , I have come back to you . ’
337345	337351	337353	337354	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Rovers of this sort , ’
337359	337381	337391	337391	Martin	221	‘ very commonly come back when they find they do n’t meet with the success they expected in their marauding ravages . ’
337382	337389	337391	337391	Martin	221	‘ But for this faithful man , ’
337397	337487	337513	337514	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ whom I first knew in this place , and who went away with me voluntarily , as a servant , but has been , throughout , my zealous and devoted friend ; but for him , I must have died abroad . Far from home , far from any help or consolation ; far from the probability even of my wretched fate being ever known to any one who cared to hear it -- oh , that you would let me say , of being known to you ! ’
337502	337511	337537	337538	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Did you speak , my worthy sir ? ’
337528	337535	337537	337538	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I know what you thought , ’
337544	337575	337582	337584	the old man	991	‘ Let him go on my friend . The development of self - interest in the human mind is always a curious study . Let him go on , sir . ’
337576	337580	337612	337612	Martin	221	‘ Go on ! ’
337600	337610	337612	337612	Martin	221	‘ I have been so wretched and so poor , ’

All this tells against me in your mind , I know . I have given you cause to think I have been driven here wholly by want , and have not been led on , in any degree , by affection or regret . When I parted from you , Grandfather , I deserved that suspicion , but I do not now . I do not now . ’

337785	337793	337795	337795	Martin	563	‘ I have little more to say , ’
337797	337839	337846	337847	the Chorus	654	‘ And as I say it now , with little or no hope , Grandfather ; whatever dawn of hope I had on entering the room ; believe it to be true . At least , believe it to be true . ’
337840	337844	337846	337847	the Chorus	654	‘ Beautiful Truth ! ’

337926	337938	337940	337941	the poet	1686	’ pursued the Chorus , soaring up into a lofty flight , ‘

338583	338586	338612	338612	he	563	‘ Yes , ’
338619	338638	338649	338650	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Speak for me , Pecksniff , Thank you . You are true to me . Thank you ! ’

338657	338755	338810	338811	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ or I shall be unequal to the task . It is not agreeable to my feelings , my good sir , to address the person who is now before us , for when I ejected him from this house , after hearing of his unnatural conduct from your lips , I renounced communication with him for ever . But you desire it ; and that is sufficient . Young man ! The door is immediately behind the companion of your infamy . Blush if you can ; begone without a blush , if you ca n’t . ’
338786	338808	338810	338811	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ When I ordered you to leave this house upon the last occasion of your being dismissed from it with disgrace , ’
338813	338884	338940	338941	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ when , stung and stimulated beyond endurance by your shameless conduct to this extraordinarily noble - minded individual , I exclaimed “ Go forth ! ” I told you that I wept for your depravity . Do not suppose that the tear which stands in my eye at this moment , is shed for you . It is shed for him , sir . It is shed for him . ’
338918	338938	338999	339000	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ It is shed for him , sir , whom you seek to make the victim of your arts , ’
338943	338997	339069	339070	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ whom you seek to plunder , to deceive , and to mislead . It is shed in sympathy with him , and admiration of him ; not in pity for him , for happily he knows what you are . You shall not wrong him further , sir , in any way , ’

339369	339374	339398	339400	the old man	991	‘ Not a word ? ’
339383	339396	339398	339400	the old man	991	‘ I remember that I have a word to say , Pecksniff , ’
339402	339441	339561	339561	Martin	563	‘ But a word . You spoke of being indebted to the charitable help of some stranger for the means of returning to England . Who is he ? And what help in money did he render you ? ’
339547	339559	339561	339561	Martin	563	‘ It would be a poor pride and a false humility , ’
339568	339609	339620	339622	the old man	991	‘ to say , I do not wish that to be paid , or that I have any present hope of being able to pay it . But I never felt my poverty so deeply as I feel it now . ’
339610	339618	339655	339656	old Martin	563	‘ Read it to me , Pecksniff , ’
339647	339653	339655	339656	old Martin	563	‘ I think , Pecksniff , ’
339658	339701	339722	339723	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I could wish that to be discharged . I should not like the lender , who was abroad , who had no opportunity of making inquiry , and who did ( as he thought ) a kind action , to suffer . ’
339702	339720	339722	339723	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ An honourable sentiment , my dear sir . Your own entirely . But a dangerous precedent , ’
339725	339731	339742	339744	the old man	991	‘ permit me to suggest . ’
339732	339740	339742	339744	the old man	991	‘ It shall not be a precedent , ’
339746	339773	339780	339781	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ It is the only recognition of him . But we will talk of it again . You shall advise me . There is nothing else ? ’

339784	339811	339822	339824	the old man	991	‘ but for you to recover this intrusion -- this cowardly and indefensible outrage on your feelings -- with all possible dispatch , and smile again . ’
339812	339820	339897	339899	the old man	991	‘ You have nothing more to say ? ’
339857	339895	340062	340062	he	218	‘ You have nothing at all to urge ? You are sure of that ! If you have , no matter what it is , speak freely . I will oppose nothing that you ask of me , ’
340074	340090	340155	340155	Martin	563	‘ You have heard him . Go away . It is all over . Go ! ’
340149	340153	340155	340155	Martin	563	‘ Dear girl ! ’
340157	340176	340106	340106	Martin	563	‘ He has not changed you . Why , what an impotent and harmless knave the fellow is ! ’
340177	340191	340198	340198	Martin	563	‘ You have restrained yourself so nobly ! You have borne so much ! ’
340192	340196	340198	340198	Martin	563	‘ Restrained myself ! ’
340202	340287	340106	340106	Martin	563	‘ You were by , and were unchanged , I knew . What more advantage did I want ? The sight of me was such a bitterness to the dog , that I had my triumph in his being forced to endure it . But tell me , love -- for the few hasty words we can exchange now are precious -- what is this which has been rumoured to me ? Is it true that you are persecuted by this knave ’s addresses ? ’
340288	340324	340367	340367	Martin	563	‘ I was , dear Martin , and to some extent am now ; but my chief source of unhappiness has been anxiety for you . Why did you leave us in such terrible suspense ? ’
340325	340365	340367	340367	Martin	563	‘ Sickness , distance ; the dread of hinting at our real condition , the impossibility of concealing it except in perfect silence ; the knowledge that the truth would have pained you infinitely more than uncertainty and doubt , ’
340386	340449	340106	340106	Martin	563	‘ were the causes of my writing only once . But Pecksniff ? You need n’t fear to tell me the whole tale ; for you saw me with him face to face , hearing him speak , and not taking him by the throat ; what is the history of his pursuit of you ? Is it known to my grandfather ? ’
340450	340453	340106	340106	Martin	563	‘ Yes . ’
340454	340462	340467	340467	she	7517	‘ And he assists him in it ? ’
340463	340466	340477	340477	Martin	563	‘ No , ’

340479	340491	340500	340500	Mary	253	‘ that it leaves his mind unclouded in that one respect ! ’
340492	340498	340500	340500	Mary	253	‘ I do not think , ’
340502	340556	340564	340564	Martin	563	‘ it was known to him at first . When this man had sufficiently prepared his mind , he revealed it to him by degrees . I think so , but I only know it from my own impression : now from anything they told me . Then he spoke to me alone . ’
340557	340562	340564	340564	Martin	563	‘ My grandfather did ? ’
340566	340577	340587	340587	Martin	563	‘ Yes -- spoke to me alone , and told me-- ’
340578	340585	340587	340587	Martin	563	‘ What the hound had said , ’
340589	340595	340564	340564	Martin	563	‘ Do n’t repeat it . ’
340596	340684	340691	340691	Martin	563	‘ And said I knew well what qualities he possessed ; that he was moderately rich ; in good repute ; and high in his favour and confidence . But seeing me very much distressed , he said that he would not control or force my inclinations , but would content himself with telling me the fact . He would not pain me by dwelling on it , or reverting to it ; nor has he ever done so since , but has truly kept his word . ’
340685	340689	340729	340729	she	7518	‘ The man himself?-- ’
340693	340728	340729	340729	she	7518	‘ He has had few opportunities of pursuing his suit . I have never walked out alone , or remained alone an instant in his presence . Dear Martin , I must tell you , ’
340732	340859	340886	340886	she	7519	‘ that the kindness of your grandfather to me remains unchanged . I am his companion still . An indescribable tenderness and compassion seem to have mingled themselves with his old regard ; and if I were his only child , I could not have a gentler father . What former fancy or old habit survives in this , when his heart has turned so cold to you , is a mystery I can not penetrate ; but it has been , and it is , a happiness to me , that I remained true to him ; that if he should wake from his delusion , even at the point of death , I am here , love , to recall you to his thoughts . ’
340876	340885	340886	340886	she	7519	‘ I have sometimes heard , and read , ’
340889	340973	340988	340988	Martin	655	‘ that those whose powers had been enfeebled long ago , and whose lives had faded , as it were , into a dream , have been known to rouse themselves before death , and inquire for familiar faces once very dear to them ; but forgotten , unrecognized , hated even , in the meantime . Think , if with his old impressions of this man , he should suddenly resume his former self , and find in him his only friend ! ’
340974	340986	340988	340988	Martin	655	‘ I would not urge you to abandon him , dearest , ’
340990	341019	341082	341082	Martin	655	‘ though I could count the years we are to wear out asunder . But the influence this fellow exercises over him has steadily increased , I fear . ’
341072	341080	341082	341082	Martin	655	‘ Does the influence extend to fear ? ’
341084	341106	341287	341287	He	655	‘ Is he timid of asserting his own opinion in the presence of this infatuation ? I fancied so just now . ’
341107	341241	341559	341559	Martin	655	‘ I have thought so , often . Often when we are sitting alone , almost as we used to do , and I have been reading a favourite book to him or he has been talking quite cheerfully , I have observed that the entrance of Mr Pecksniff has changed his whole demeanour . He has broken off immediately , and become what you have seen to - day . When we first came here he had his impetuous outbreaks , in which it was not easy for Mr Pecksniff with his utmost plausibility to appease him . But these have long since dwindled away . He defers to him in everything , and has no opinion upon any question , but that which is forced upon him by this treacherous man . ’
341548	341557	341559	341559	Martin	655	‘ A short interview after such an absence ! ’
341563	341592	341604	341604	he	222	‘ But we are well out of the house . We might have placed ourselves in a false position by remaining there , even so long , Mark . ’
341593	341603	341677	341678	Mr Tapley	309	‘ I do n’t know about ourselves , sir , ’
341607	341675	341677	341678	Mr Tapley	309	‘ but somebody else would have got into a false position , if he had happened to come back again , while we was there . I had the door all ready , sir . If Pecksniff had showed his head , or had only so much as listened behind it , I would have caught him like a walnut . He ’s the sort of man , ’
341682	341691	341780	341780	Martin	655	‘ as would squeeze soft , I know . ’
341769	341778	341780	341780	Martin	655	‘ Who may that be , I wonder ! ’
341782	341798	341819	341820	Mr Tapley	309	‘ The face seems familiar to me , but I do n’t know the man . ’
341799	341817	341819	341820	Mr Tapley	309	‘ He seems to have a amiable desire that his face should be tolerable familiar to us , ’
341822	341849	341876	341877	Mr Tapley	309	‘ for he ’s a - staring pretty hard . He ’d better not waste his beauty , for he ai n’t got much to spare . ’
341866	341874	341876	341877	Mr Tapley	309	‘ And a Salisbury carriage , eh ? ’
341879	341925	341968	341970	the good woman	9070	‘ That ’s what he came in depend upon it . What ’s in the wind now ? A new pupil , I should n’t wonder . P’raps it ’s a order for another grammar - school , of the same pattern as the last . ’
341958	341966	341968	341970	the good woman	9070	‘ Miss Pecksniff ’s husband that was , ’
341974	341997	342011	342011	Martin	221	‘ I did n’t know what terms you might be on , and was quite in a worry till you came back . ’
341998	342009	342011	342011	Martin	221	‘ He and I have never interchanged a word yet , ’
342013	342072	342091	342092	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ and as I have no wish to be better or worse acquainted with him , I will not put myself in his way . We passed him on the road , I have no doubt . I am glad he timed his coming as he did . Upon my word ! Miss Pecksniff ’s husband travels gayly ! ’
342073	342089	342091	342092	Mrs Lupin	255	‘ A very fine - looking gentleman with him -- in the best room now , ’
342106	342129	342136	342136	Martin	221	‘ He has ordered everything that can be got for dinner ; and has the glossiest moustaches and whiskers ever you saw . ’
342130	342134	342175	342175	Martin	221	‘ Has he ? ’
342138	342173	342175	342175	Martin	221	‘ why then we ’ll endeavour to avoid him too , in the hope that our self - denial may be strong enough for the sacrifice . It is only for a few hours , ’
342190	342211	342219	342220	the hostess	9135	‘ Our visit has met with no success , my dear Mrs Lupin , and I must go to London . ’
342212	342217	342280	342280	Martin	221	‘ Dear , dear ! ’
342222	342278	342280	342280	Martin	221	‘ Yes , one foul wind no more makes a winter , than one swallow makes a summer . I ’ll try it again . Tom Pinch has succeeded . With his advice to guide me , I may do the same . I took Tom under my protection once , God save the mark ! ’
342287	342315	342546	342546	he	218	‘ and promised I would make his fortune . Perhaps Tom will take me under HIS protection now , and teach me how to earn my bread . ’
342561	342577	342546	342546	he	218	‘ Jonas . My child -- she is well ! There is nothing the matter ? ’
342578	342582	342546	342546	he	218	‘ What , you ’re
342590	342599	342610	342610	you	9590	’ replied his son - in - law . ‘
342612	342613	342610	342610	you	9590	’ ‘
342621	342626	342610	342610	you	9590	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘
342635	342636	342637	342637	She	9590	’ ‘
342642	342649	342610	342610	you	9590	’ retorted Jonas , disengaging himself . ‘
342658	342659	342666	342666	her	9590	’ ‘
342668	342686	342742	342742	She	9590	’ cried Mr Pecksniff , sitting down in the nearest chair , and rubbing up his hair . ‘
342720	342741	342756	342756	She	9590	’ said Mr Pecksniff , inventing a playful little name for her , in the restored lightness of his heart . ‘
342751	342755	342771	342772	a sweetheart	7552	’ returned Jonas . ‘
342777	342778	342771	342772	a sweetheart	7552	’ ‘
342785	342790	342855	342855	Cherry	241	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
342859	342860	342855	342855	Cherry	241	’ ‘
342869	342887	342898	342899	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ observed the son - in - law , for she ai n’t very ornamental in general . ’
342888	342896	342898	342899	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ My girls are now provided for , ’
342901	342917	343017	343017	Jonas	219	‘ They are now happily provided for , and I have not laboured in vain ! ’
343005	343015	343017	343017	Jonas	219	‘ Suppose we talk about something else , now , ’
343021	343032	343038	343039	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ just for a change . Are you quite agreeable ? ’
343033	343036	343038	343039	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Quite , ’
343041	343091	343105	343105	Jonas	219	‘ Ah , you wag , you naughty wag ! You laugh at poor old fond papa . Well ! He deserves it . And he do n’t mind it either , for his feelings are their own reward . You have come to stay with me , Jonas ? ’
343092	343103	343114	343115	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ No . I ’ve got a friend with me , ’
343107	343112	343114	343115	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Bring your friend ! ’
343123	343131	343146	343146	Jonas	219	‘ Bring any number of your friends ! ’
343132	343144	343146	343146	Jonas	219	‘ This ai n’t the sort of man to be brought , ’
343150	343190	343312	343312	Jonas	219	‘ I think I see myself “ bringing ” him to your house , for a treat ! Thank’ee all the same ; but he ’s a little too near the top of the tree for that , Pecksniff . ’
343296	343310	343312	343312	Jonas	219	‘ I ’ll tell you what you may do , if you like , ’
343314	343389	343412	343424	Some young nobleman who has been borrowing money of you at good interest	7570	‘ you may come and dine with us at the Dragon . We were forced to come down to Salisbury last night , on some business , and I got him to bring me over here this morning , in his carriage ; at least , not his own carriage , for we had a breakdown in the night , but one we hired instead ; it ’s all the same . Mind what you ’re
343410	343411	343439	343439	I	0	’ ‘
343428	343438	343445	343447	the gay sprig	7571	’ said Mr Pecksniff , shaking his forefinger facetiously . ‘
343449	343450	343445	343447	the gay sprig	7571	’ ‘
343453	343457	343556	343556	Jonas	219	’ echoed Jonas . ‘
343462	343554	343556	343556	Jonas	219	’re a twentieth part as rich as he is , you may shut up shop ! We should be pretty well off if we could buy his furniture , and plate , and pictures , by clubbing together . A likely man to borrow : Mr Montague ! Why since I was lucky enough ( come ! and I ’ll say , sharp enough , too ) to get a share in the Assurance office that he ’s President of , I ’ve made -- never mind what I ’ve made , ’
343568	343594	343604	343605	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ You know me pretty well , and I do n’t blab about such things . But , Ecod , I ’ve made a trifle . ’
343595	343602	343675	343676	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Really , my dear Jonas , ’
343611	343673	343693	343693	his	218	‘ a gentleman like this should receive some attention . Would he like to see the church ? or if he has a taste for the fine arts -- which I have no doubt he has , from the description you give of his circumstances -- I can send him down a few portfolios . Salisbury Cathedral , my dear Jonas , ’
343700	343778	343847	343847	he	219	‘ is an edifice replete with venerable associations , and strikingly suggestive of the loftiest emotions . It is here we contemplate the work of bygone ages . It is here we listen to the swelling organ , as we stroll through the reverberating aisles . We have drawings of this celebrated structure from the North , from the South , from the East , from the West , from the South - East , from the Nor’West-- ’
343843	343846	343847	343847	he	219	‘ Ecod ! ’
343850	343895	343903	343903	Jonas	219	‘ Pecksniff if I knew how you meant to leave your money , I could put you in the way of doubling it in no time . It would n’t be bad to keep a chance like this snug in the family . But you ’re
343901	343902	343903	343903	Jonas	219	’ ‘
343905	343913	344012	344012	I	0	’ cried Mr Pecksniff , much affected , ‘
344018	344042	344090	344090	his	219	’ Here he gave the hand of his son - in - law a fervent squeeze , as if he would have added , ‘
344057	344084	344090	344090	his	219	’ Mr Jonas only shook his head and laughed , and , seeming to think better of what he had had in his mind , said , ‘
344094	344259	344273	344273	he	14334	’ But as he observed that he would take a walk , Mr Pecksniff insisted on accompanying him , remarking that he could leave a card for Mr Montague , as they went along , by way of gentleman - usher to himself at dinner - time . Which he did . In the course of their walk , Mr Jonas affected to maintain that close reserve which had operated as a timely check upon him during the foregoing dialogue . And as he made no attempt to conciliate Mr Pecksniff , but , on the contrary , was more boorish and rude to him than usual , that gentleman , so far from suspecting his real design , laid himself out to be attacked with advantage . For it is in the nature of a knave to think the tools with which he works indispensable to knavery ; and knowing what he would do himself in such a case , Mr Pecksniff argued , ‘
344280	344415	344273	344273	he	14334	’ The more Jonas repelled him in his hints and inquiries , the more solicitous , therefore , Mr Pecksniff became to be initiated into the golden mysteries at which he had obscurely glanced . Why should there be cold and worldly secrets , he observed , between relations ? What was life without confidence ? If the chosen husband of his daughter , the man to whom he had delivered her with so much pride and hope , such bounding and such beaming joy ; if he were not a green spot in the barren waste of life , where was that oasis to be bound ? Little did Mr Pecksniff think on what a very green spot he planted one foot at that moment ! Little did he foresee when he said , ‘
344421	344614	344273	344273	he	14334	’ how very shortly he would come down with his own ! Inch by inch , in his grudging and ill - conditioned way ; sustained to the life , for the hope of making Mr Pecksniff suffer in that tender place , the pocket , where Jonas smarted so terribly himself , gave him an additional and malicious interest in the wiles he was set on to practise ; inch by inch , and bit by bit , Jonas rather allowed the dazzling prospects of the Anglo - Bengalee establishment to escape him , than paraded them before his greedy listener . And in the same niggardly spirit , he left Mr Pecksniff to infer , if he chose ( which he DID choose , of course ) , that a consciousness of not having any great natural gifts of speech and manner himself , rendered him desirous to have the credit of introducing to Mr Montague some one who was well endowed in those respects , and so atone for his own deficiencies . Otherwise , he muttered discontentedly , he would have seen his beloved father - in - law ‘
344619	344731	344734	344735	respected sir	7577	’ before he would have taken him into his confidence . Primed in this artful manner , Mr Pecksniff presented himself at dinner - time in such a state of suavity , benevolence , cheerfulness , politeness , and cordiality , as even he had perhaps never attained before . The frankness of the country gentleman , the refinement of the artist , the good - humoured allowance of the man of the world ; philanthropy , forbearance , piety , toleration , all blended together in a flexible adaptability to anything and everything ; were expressed in Mr Pecksniff , as he shook hands with the great speculator and capitalist . ‘
344737	344742	344811	344811	Jonas	219	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
344786	344797	344811	344811	Jonas	219	’ said Mr Pecksniff , pressing his hand almost reverentially , ‘
344813	344819	344828	344828	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff aside , ‘
344843	344853	344854	344854	I	0	’ Nothing was more probable , they all agreed . ‘
344859	344864	344888	344889	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ said Mr Pecksniff , ‘
344906	344907	344923	344923	He	977	’ ‘
344914	344922	344923	344923	He	977	’ asked Montague , turning deeply red . ‘
344926	344931	344932	344932	You	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘
344940	344941	344946	344946	you	0	’ ‘
344954	344958	344974	344974	Jonas	219	’ returned Jonas . ‘
344972	344973	344974	344974	Jonas	219	’ ‘
344980	344985	344974	344974	Jonas	219	’ remonstrated Mr Pecksniff . ‘
344988	344989	345010	345010	You	0	’ ‘
345005	345009	345015	345015	You	0	’ said Jonas . ‘
345023	345024	345015	345015	You	0	’ ‘
345034	345038	345015	345015	You	0	’ cried Montague . ‘
345045	345056	345015	345015	You	0	’ and here they all laughed -- especially Mr Pecksniff . ‘
345061	345078	345109	345109	you	0	’ said that gentleman , clapping his son - in - law playfully upon the shoulder . ‘
345120	345121	345134	345134	I	0	’ ‘
345129	345133	345169	345170	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ cried Montague , ‘
345185	345186	345169	345170	Mr Pecksniff	218	’ ‘
345196	345211	345218	345218	WE	7594	’ cried Mr Pecksniff . But they all laughed again -- especially Mr Pecksniff . ‘
345222	345226	345238	345238	You	0	’ said Montague . ‘
345232	345237	345261	345261	you	0	’ cried Mr Pecksniff . ‘
345266	345480	345481	345481	WE	7595	’ Again they all laughed in concert ; and again Mr Pecksniff laughed especially . This was very agreeable indeed . It was confidential , easy , straight - forward ; and still left Mr Pecksniff in the position of being in a gentle way the Mentor of the party . The greatest achievements in the article of cookery that the Dragon had ever performed , were set before them ; the oldest and best wines in the Dragon ’s cellar saw the light on that occasion ; a thousand bubbles , indicative of the wealth and station of Mr Montague in the depths of his pursuits , were constantly rising to the surface of the conversation ; and they were as frank and merry as three honest men could be . Mr Pecksniff thought it a pity ( he said so ) that Mr Montague should think lightly of mankind and their weaknesses . He was anxious upon this subject ; his mind ran upon it ; in one way or another he was constantly coming back to it ; he must make a convert of him , he said . And as often as Mr Montague repeated his sentiment about building fortunes on the weaknesses of mankind , and added frankly , ‘
345485	345492	345511	345511	you	0	’ just as often Mr Pecksniff repeated ‘
345516	345821	346133	346133	he	218	’ laying a greater stress each time on those last words . The frequent repetition of this playful inquiry on the part of Mr Pecksniff , led at last to playful answers on the part of Mr Montague ; but after some little sharp - shooting on both sides , Mr Pecksniff became grave , almost to tears ; observing that if Mr Montague would give him leave , he would drink the health of his young kinsman , Mr Jonas ; congratulating him upon the valuable and distinguished friendship he had formed , but envying him , he would confess , his usefulness to his fellow - creatures . For , if he understood the objects of that Institution with which he was newly and advantageously connected -- knowing them but imperfectly -- they were calculated to do Good ; and for his ( Mr Pecksniff ’s ) part , if he could in any way promote them , he thought he would be able to lay his head upon his pillow every night , with an absolute certainty of going to sleep at once . The transition from this accidental remark ( for it was quite accidental and had fallen from Mr Pecksniff in the openness of his soul ) , to the discussion of the subject as a matter of business , was easy . Books , papers , statements , tables , calculations of various kinds , were soon spread out before them ; and as they were all framed with one object , it is not surprising that they should all have tended to one end . But still , whenever Montague enlarged upon the profits of the office , and said that as long as there were gulls upon the wing it must succeed , Mr Pecksniff mildly said ‘
346125	346132	346133	346133	he	218	‘ Ah , my good friend ! ’
346136	346150	346286	346287	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ not a - bed yet ! Contemplating the stars , Mrs Lupin ? ’
346151	346161	346170	346171	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ It ’s a beautiful starlight night , sir . ’
346162	346168	346170	346171	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ A beautiful starlight night , ’

346208	346217	346228	346229	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Yes , sir . They are gone . ’
346218	346226	346286	346287	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I am glad to hear it , ’

346295	346362	346389	346390	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ you are much mistaken ; my wormy relatives , you are much deceived ! The stars are perfectly contented ( I suppose so ) in their several spheres . Why are not you ? Oh ! do not strive and struggle to enrich yourselves , or to get the better of each other , my deluded friends , but look up there , with me ! ’
346379	346387	346394	346394	his	218	‘ Look up there , with me ! ’
346397	346451	346470	346470	he	2161	‘ With me , a humble individual who is also an insect like yourselves . Can silver , gold , or precious stones , sparkle like those constellations ! I think not . Then do not thirst for silver , gold , or precious stones ; but look up there , with me ! ’
346474	346483	346562	346562	Jonas	219	‘ think of this , my good woman ! ’
346540	346560	346572	346572	Montague	521	‘ You mean to wait at Salisbury over the day after to - morrow , do you , then ? ’
346564	346570	346572	346572	Montague	521	‘ You heard our appointment , ’
346579	346593	346625	346625	Jonas	219	‘ In any case I should have waited to see after the boy . ’
346613	346623	346638	346638	he	521	‘ You do n’t want me , I suppose ? ’
346627	346637	346638	346638	he	521	‘ I want you to put your name here , ’
346648	346703	346767	346767	Jonas	219	‘ as soon as I have filled up the stamp . I may as well have your note of hand for that extra capital . That ’s all I want . If you wish to go home , I can manage Mr Pecksniff now , alone . There is a perfect understanding between us . ’
346748	346765	346767	346767	Jonas	219	‘ What , not a day ’s grace , not a day ’s trust , eh ? ’
346770	346785	346800	346800	Montague	521	‘ Not after the pains I have taken with to - night ’s work ? ’
346786	346798	346800	346800	Montague	521	‘ To night ’s work was a part of our bargain , ’
346802	346808	346818	346818	Jonas	219	‘ and so was this . ’
346809	346816	346818	346818	Jonas	219	‘ You drive a hard bargain , ’
346825	346834	346900	346900	he	219	‘ You know best . Give it here ! ’
346890	346899	346900	346900	he	219	‘ Why , what the devil ’s this ? ’
346903	346908	347014	347014	he	219	‘ It ’s bloody ! ’
347006	347013	347014	347014	he	219	‘ Black enough , this time , ’
347023	347028	347014	347014	he	219	‘ Good - bye . ’

347044	347078	347014	347014	he	219	‘ I shall cross early in the morning to the high road , before you are out of bed ; and catch the day - coach , going up . Good - bye ! ’
347079	347086	347096	347096	Jonas	219	‘ You are in a hurry ! ’
347087	347094	347096	347096	Jonas	219	‘ I have something to do , ’
347098	347103	347104	347105	His friend	9006	‘ Good - bye ! ’
347129	347153	348086	348086	John	247	‘ It happens all the better . It brings about what I wanted , without any difficulty . I shall travel home alone . ’
348076	348084	348086	348086	John	247	‘ I felt sure it was you , ’
348099	348108	348124	348124	John	247	‘ I knew I could n’t be mistaken . ’
348114	348122	348124	348124	John	247	‘ You are waiting for your brother , ’
348126	348133	348532	348532	Tom	638	‘ Let me bear you company . ’
348524	348530	348532	348532	Tom	638	‘ What an extraordinary meeting ! ’
348534	348547	348553	348553	John	247	‘ I should never have dreamed of seeing you two together here . ’
348548	348552	348564	348564	Tom	638	‘ Quite accidental , ’
348559	348562	348564	348564	Tom	638	‘ Exactly , ’
348566	348590	348598	348598	John	247	‘ that ’s what I mean , you know . If it was n’t accidental , there would be nothing remarkable in it . ’
348591	348596	348598	348598	John	247	‘ To be sure , ’
348600	348618	348632	348632	John	247	‘ Such an out - of - the - way place for you to have met in , ’
348625	348631	348707	348707	She	7655	‘ Such an unlikely spot ! ’
348718	348736	348753	348753	he	247	‘ Are you going to stop here all day , you dear , old , blundering Tom ? ’
348749	348752	348753	348753	he	247	‘ John , ’
348756	348795	348835	348836	his friend	9006	‘ if you ’ll give my sister your arm , we ’ll take her between us , and walk on . I have a curious circumstance to relate to you . Our meeting could not have happened better . ’
348830	348833	348835	348836	his friend	9006	‘ Tom , ’
348846	348888	348898	348898	Tom	638	‘ I have a proposition to make . It is , that you and your sister -- if she will so far honour a poor bachelor ’s dwelling -- give me a great pleasure , and come and dine with me . ’
348889	348896	348898	348898	Tom	638	‘ What , to - day ? ’
348900	348938	348952	348952	Tom	638	‘ Yes , to - day . It ’s close by , you know . Pray , Miss Pinch , insist upon it . It will be very disinterested , for I have nothing to give you . ’
348939	348950	348952	348952	Tom	638	‘ Oh ! you must not believe that , Ruth , ’
348954	348995	349005	349008	his dutiful little sister	7660	‘ He is the most tremendous fellow , in his housekeeping , that I ever heard of , for a single man . He ought to be Lord Mayor . Well ! what do you say ? Shall we go ? ’
348996	349003	349017	349017	Tom	638	‘ If you please , Tom , ’
349010	349015	349017	349017	Tom	638	‘ But I mean , ’
349025	349066	349145	349145	John	247	‘ is there anything you ought to wear , and have n’t got ? I am sure I do n’t know , John ; she may not be able to take her bonnet off , for anything I can tell . ’
349133	349143	349145	349145	John	247	‘ If I had known it a little sooner , ’
349147	349180	349187	349187	Tom	638	‘ I would have tried another pudding . Not in rivalry ; but merely to exalt that famous one . I would n’t on any account have had it made with suet . ’
349181	349185	349200	349201	John Westlock	247	‘ Why not ? ’
349189	349198	349200	349201	John Westlock	247	‘ Because that cookery - book advises suet , ’
349203	349213	349221	349221	Tom	638	‘ and ours was made with flour and eggs . ’
349214	349219	349221	349221	Tom	638	‘ Oh good gracious ! ’
349223	349269	349363	349363	he	638	‘ Ours was made with flour and eggs , was it ? Ha , ha , ha ! A beefsteak pudding made with flour and eggs ! Why anybody knows better than that . I know better than that ! Ha , ha , ha ! ’
349372	349386	350062	350062	Tom	638	‘ flour and eggs ! A beefsteak pudding made with flour and eggs ! ’
350046	350060	350062	350062	Tom	638	‘ Did n’t I say he was a tremendous fellow in his housekeeping ? ’
350064	350073	350082	350082	John	247	‘ Bless my soul ! It ’s wonderful . ’
350074	350080	350082	350082	John	247	‘ Ah , Miss Pinch , ’
350084	350118	350130	350130	Tom	638	‘ This is the bright side of the life we lead in such a place . It would be a dismal life , indeed , if it did n’t brighten up to - day ’
350119	350128	350130	350130	Tom	638	‘ Do n’t believe a word he says , ’
350132	350158	350250	350251	Tom Pinch	249	‘ He lives here like a monarch , and would n’t change his mode of life for any consideration . He only pretends to grumble . ’
350246	350248	350250	350251	Tom Pinch	249	‘ Well ’
350253	350284	350351	350351	she	7687	‘ I do n’t know where you can go , John , to be more comfortable . That ’s all I can say . What do YOU say , Ruth ? ’
350332	350350	350365	350365	Tom	638	‘ But you are forgetting what you had to tell , Tom ; what occurred this morning , ’
350358	350363	350365	350365	Tom	638	‘ So I am , ’
350367	350407	350599	350599	Tom	638	‘ We have been so talkative on other topics that I declare I have not had time to think of it . I ’ll tell it you at once , John , in case I should forget it altogether . ’
350586	350597	350599	350599	Tom	638	‘ I shall remonstrate with my landlord , of course , ’
350601	350632	350642	350642	John	247	‘ though he is a very singular secret sort of man , and not likely to afford me much satisfaction ; even if he knew what was in the letter . ’
350633	350641	350642	350642	John	247	‘ Which you may swear he did , ’
350645	350650	350599	350599	Tom	638	‘ You think so ? ’
350651	350658	350664	350664	Tom	638	‘ I am certain of it . ’
350659	350662	350664	350664	Tom	638	‘ Well ! ’
350666	350779	350790	350791	his friend	9006	‘ I shall remonstrate with him when I see him ( he goes in and out in a strange way , but I will try to catch him tomorrow morning ) , on his having asked me to execute such an unpleasant commission . And I have been thinking , John , that if I went down to Mrs What’s - her - name ’s in the City , where I was before , you know -- Mrs Todgers’s -- to - morrow morning , I might find poor Mercy Pecksniff there , perhaps , and be able to explain to her how I came to have any hand in the business . ’
350780	350788	350790	350791	his friend	9006	‘ You are perfectly right , Tom , ’
350800	350908	351552	351552	he	638	‘ You can not do better . It is quite clear to me that whatever the business is , there is little good in it ; and it is so desirable for you to disentangle yourself from any appearance of willful connection with it , that I would counsel you to see her husband , if you can , and wash your hands of it by a plain statement of the facts . I have a misgiving that there is something dark at work here , Tom . I will tell you why , at another time ; when I have made an inquiry or two myself . ’
351547	351551	351552	351552	he	638	‘ Dear me ! ’
351560	351572	351596	351596	Tom	638	‘ I am afraid I have been very inconsiderate and unpolite . ’
351585	351594	351596	351596	Tom	638	‘ Sing something to us , my dear , ’
351598	351607	351761	351761	she	7716	‘ let us hear your voice . Come ! ’
351768	351856	351871	351871	John	247	’ hearts again ; these were the simple means she used to please them . And that these simple means prevailed , and she DID please them , let the still darkened chamber , and its long - deferred illumination witness . The candles came at last , and it was time for moving homeward . Cutting paper carefully , and rolling it about the stalks of those same flowers , occasioned some delay ; but even this was done in time , and Ruth was ready . ‘
351860	351864	351761	351761	she	7716	’ said Tom . ‘
351876	351885	351761	351761	she	7716	’ John thought he would walk with them . ‘
351893	351897	351909	351909	I	0	’ said Tom . ‘
351918	351926	351928	351928	you	247	’ But John said he would rather . ‘
351934	351938	351942	351942	you	247	’ said Tom . ‘
351950	352218	352219	352219	She	7721	’ John being quite sure , gave his arm to Ruth , and led her out . Fiery - face , who was again in attendance , acknowledged her departure with so cold a curtsey that it was hardly visible ; and cut Tom , dead . Their host was bent on walking the whole distance , and would not listen to Tom ’s dissuasions . Happy time , happy walk , happy parting , happy dreams ! But there are some sweet day - dreams , so there are that put the visions of the night to shame . Busily the Temple fountain murmured in the moonlight , while Ruth lay sleeping , with her flowers beside her ; and John Westlock sketched a portrait -- whose?--from memory . CHAPTER FORTY - SIX IN WHICH MISS PECKSNIFF MAKES LOVE , MR JONAS MAKES WRATH , MRS GAMP MAKES TEA , AND MR CHUFFEY MAKES BUSINESS On the next day ’s official duties coming to a close , Tom hurried home without losing any time by the way ; and after dinner and a short rest sallied out again , accompanied by Ruth , to pay his projected visit to Todgers ’s . Tom took Ruth with him , not only because it was a great pleasure to him to have her for his companion whenever he could , but because he wished her to cherish and comfort poor Merry ; which she , for her own part ( having heard the wretched history of that young wife from Tom ) , was all eagerness to do . ‘
352227	352231	352244	352244	Your	7721	’ said Tom , ‘
352258	352259	352260	352260	I	0	’ ‘
352272	352276	352303	352303	she	7721	’ she replied ; ‘
352299	352300	352303	352303	she	7721	’ ‘
352310	352316	352337	352337	I	0	’ cried Tom , confidently . ‘
352343	352379	352337	352337	I	0	’ said his little sister pinching him upon the cheek . Tom laughed , and said that with reference to this particular case he had no doubt at all of finding a disciple in Merry . ‘
352384	352388	352465	352465	You	7725	’ said Tom , ‘
352468	352469	352465	352465	You	7725	’ ‘
352475	352480	352465	352465	You	7725	’ his sister interposed . ‘
352489	352647	352655	352656	Miss Pecksniff	244	’ Tom put this observation off good humouredly , but somewhat gravely too ; and they were soon very chatty again on some other subject . As they were passing through a street in the City , not very far from Mrs Todgers ’s place of residence , Ruth checked Tom before the window of a large Upholstery and Furniture Warehouse , to call his attention to something very magnificent and ingenious , displayed there to the best advantage , for the admiration and temptation of the public . Tom had hazarded some most erroneous and extravagantly wrong guess in relation to the price of this article , and had joined his sister in laughing heartily at his mistake , when he pressed her arm in his , and pointed to two persons at a little distance , who were looking in at the same window with a deep interest in the chests of drawers and tables . ‘
352650	352654	352655	352656	Miss Pecksniff	244	’ Tom whispered . ‘
352671	352672	352675	352675	he	7729	’ ‘
352688	352694	352697	352697	he	7729	’ inquired his little sister . ‘
352708	352711	352713	352713	he	7729	’ said Tom ‘
352720	352721	352722	352722	I	0	’ ‘
352730	352734	352739	352739	they	7731	’ whispered Ruth . ‘
352742	352746	352888	352888	Augustus	577	’ replied Tom . ‘
352755	352887	352888	352888	Augustus	577	’ They could not very well avoid looking at them , however , especially as some obstruction on the pavement , at a little distance , happened to detain them where they were for a few moments . Miss Pecksniff had quite the air of having taken the unhappy Moddle captive , and brought him up to the contemplation of the furniture like a lamb to the altar . He offered no resistance , but was perfectly resigned and quiet . The melancholy depicted in the turn of his languishing head , and in his dejected attitude , was extreme ; and though there was a full - sized four - post bedstead in the window , such a tear stood trembling in his eye as seemed to blot it out . ‘
352893	352898	352888	352888	Augustus	577	’ said Miss Pecksniff , ‘
352913	352914	352888	352888	Augustus	577	’ ‘
352921	352925	352934	352934	They	7731	’ said Augustus . ‘
352932	352933	352934	352934	They	7731	’ ‘
352945	352950	352955	352955	they	7731	’ rejoined Miss Pecksniff . ‘
352959	352963	352955	352955	they	7731	’ said Moddle . ‘
352968	353007	352955	352955	they	7731	’ He appeared , for the moment , to be quite overwhelmed and stupefied by the prospect of his approaching happiness ; but recovering , entered the shop . He returned immediately , saying in a tone of despair ‘
353014	353036	352955	352955	they	7731	’ Miss Pecksniff , turning to receive this announcement , became conscious of the observation of Tom Pinch and his sister . ‘
353041	353062	353222	353222	Augustus	577	’ cried Miss Pecksniff , glancing about her , as if for some convenient means of sinking into the earth . ‘
353091	353221	353224	353225	Mr Pinch	249	’ Miss Pecksniff was quite gracious to Miss Pinch in this triumphant introduction ; exceedingly gracious . She was more than gracious ; she was kind and cordial . Whether the recollection of the old service Tom had rendered her in knocking Mr Jonas on the head had wrought this change in her opinions ; or whether her separation from her parent had reconciled her to all human - kind , or to all that interesting portion of human - kind which was not friendly to him ; or whether the delight of having some new female acquaintance to whom to communicate her interesting prospects was paramount to every other consideration ; cordial and kind Miss Pecksniff was . And twice Miss Pecksniff kissed Miss Pinch upon the cheek . ‘
353234	353241	353242	353242	I	0	’ said Miss Pecksniff , aside . ‘
353251	353261	353262	353262	I	0	’ Ruth begged her not to think of it . ‘
353271	353276	353294	353294	you--	7741	’ simpered Miss Pecksniff . ‘
353295	353309	353310	353314	Twenty - four pound ten	7742	’ Here Miss Pecksniff whispered in his ear . The suffering Moddle repeated : ‘
353316	353317	353324	353324	I	0	’ ‘
353330	353335	353336	353336	I	0	’ said Miss Pecksniff . ‘
353341	353348	353324	353324	I	0	’ Here she whispered him again . ‘
353370	353378	353419	353419	I	0	’ said Moddle , with a sigh . ‘
353383	353418	353428	353429	your sister	1594	’ Miss Pecksniff stopped him from giving any further explanation by laying her hand upon his lips , and betraying a soft embarrassment . She then asked Tom Pinch which way he was going . ‘
353431	353435	353450	353451	Mrs Todgers	322	’ answered Tom , ‘
353464	353465	353471	353471	your	249	’ ‘
353477	353481	353535	353535	You	249	’ said Cherry , ‘

353800	353804	353825	353825	I	0	’ Ruth pleaded . ‘

353834	353847	353831	353831	you	8948	’ Ruth acknowledged that he had impressed her at first sight as looking ‘

353857	353862	353933	353933	you	8948	’ said Miss Pecksniff . ‘
353944	353984	353933	353933	you	8948	’ Ruth thought of several things ; such as his digestion , his tailor , his mother , and the like . But hesitating to give utterance to any one of them , she refrained from expressing an opinion . ‘
353988	353993	354113	354113	him	577	’ said Miss Pecksniff ; ‘
354070	354092	354145	354145	I	0	’ said Miss Pecksniff , with a self - conviction candour that might have adorned the diadem of her own papa . ‘

354324	354338	354479	354479	I	0	’ cried Miss Pecksniff , in a sort of snug and comfortable penitence . ‘
354488	354513	354479	354479	I	0	’ Ruth endeavoured to express some sense of her unbounded and flattering confidence ; and presumed that she was going to be married soon . ‘
354518	354523	354696	354696	I	0	’ returned Miss Pecksniff . ‘
354542	354695	354696	354696	I	0	’ In the same vein of confidence Miss Pecksniff ran through a general inventory of the articles that were already bought with the articles that remained to be purchased ; what garments she intended to be married in , and where the ceremony was to be performed ; and gave Miss Pinch , in short ( as she told her ) , early and exclusive information on all points of interest connected with the event . While this was going forward in the rear , Tom and Mr Moddle walked on , arm in arm , in the front , in a state of profound silence , which Tom at last broke ; after thinking for a long time what he could say that should refer to an indifferent topic , in respect of which he might rely , with some degree of certainty , on Mr Moddle ’s bosom being unruffled . ‘
354699	354703	354731	354732	The drivers	6957	’ said Tom , ‘

354744	354747	354751	354752	some men	8857	’ Tom began-- ‘
354754	354763	354806	354807	such men	5583	’ interrupted Moddle , with a hollow laugh , ‘
354794	354803	354809	354812	One of ‘ em	15316	’ said Augustus , marking Tom ’s astonishment . ‘
354811	354819	354829	354829	Tom	638	‘ em is a friend of mine . ’
354820	354827	354829	354829	Tom	638	‘ Upon my word and honour , ’
354831	354847	354952	354953	Miss Pecksniff	241	‘ this young gentleman is in a state of mind which is very serious indeed ! ’
354941	354950	354977	354977	Tom	249	‘ Walk up , pray , Mr Pinch , ’
354965	354975	354977	354977	Tom	249	‘ I am doubtful whether I should be welcome , ’
354979	355005	355015	355016	Miss Pecksniff	241	‘ or , I ought rather to say , I have no doubt about it . I will send up a message , I think . ’
355006	355013	355015	355016	Miss Pecksniff	241	‘ But what nonsense that is ! ’
355023	355050	355056	355056	Tom	249	‘ He is not at home , I am certain . I know he is not ; and Merry has n’t the least idea that you ever-- ’
355051	355054	355056	355056	Tom	249	‘ No , ’
355058	355084	355100	355101	Miss Pecksniff	241	‘ Nor would I have her know it , on any account . I am not so proud of that scuffle , I assure you . ’
355085	355098	355100	355101	Miss Pecksniff	241	‘ Ah , but then you are so modest , you see , ’
355107	355147	355215	355218	the fair Miss Pecksniff	7787	‘ But pray walk up . If you do n’t wish her to know it , and do wish to speak to her , pray walk up . Pray walk up , Miss Pinch . Do n’t stand here . ’
355207	355213	355215	355218	the fair Miss Pecksniff	7787	‘ Merry , my darling ! ’
355230	355287	355295	355295	she	7787	‘ Here are Mr Pinch and his sister come to see you ! I thought we should find you here , Mrs Todgers ! How do you do , Mrs Gamp ? And how do you do , Mr Chuffey , though it ’s of no use asking you the question , I am well aware . ’
355308	355312	355323	355323	she	7787	‘ Mr Moddle . ’

Which no offence is meant , ladies and gentlemen ; none bein ’
355867	355920	355934	355934	I	0	’ Having contrived , in this happy manner , to invest every member of her audience with an individual share and immediate personal interest in her address , Mrs Gamp dropped several curtseys to Ruth , and smilingly shaking her head a great many times , pursued the thread of her discourse : ‘
355935	355964	356201	356201	he	7813	’m sure . I knows a lady , which her name , I ’ll not deceive you , Mrs Chuzzlewit , is Harris , her husband ’s brother bein ’
356183	356200	356327	356327	yourself	7818	’ said Mrs Gamp , looking round , and chuckling as she dropped a general curtsey , ‘
356265	356325	356405	356407	the old man	991	’ With these words the worthy woman , who appeared to have dropped in to take tea as a delicate little attention , rather than to have any engagement on the premises in an official capacity , crossed to Mr Chuffey , who was seated in the same corner as of old , and shook him by the shoulder . ‘
356335	356340	356345	356346	Mr Chuffey	412	’ said Mrs Gamp . ‘
356348	356349	356350	356350	I	0	’ ‘
356356	356368	356395	356395	Merry	317	’ cried the old man , looking humbly round the room . ‘
356372	356394	356405	356407	the old man	991	’m in the way . I ask pardon , but I ’ve nowhere else to go to . Where is she ? ’
356400	356403	356405	356407	the old man	991	‘ Ah ! ’
356415	356437	356539	356539	Chuffey	412	‘ Here she is . Here she is ! She ’s never hard on poor old Chuffey . Poor old Chuff ! ’
356506	356531	356539	356539	Chuffey	412	‘ You see how misery has changed me . I can feel for a dependant NOW , and set some value on his attachment . ’
356532	356537	356539	356539	Chuffey	412	‘ Aye , aye ! ’

356647	356686	356693	356695	the old man	991	‘ It ’s a pity that you do n’t know wot you say , for you ’d tire your own patience out if you did , and fret yourself into a happy releage for all as knows you . ’
356687	356691	356693	356695	the old man	991	‘ His son , ’
356702	356706	356640	356640	he	638	‘ His son ! ’

357011	357023	357025	357026	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ And quite a family it is to make tea for , ’

357198	357674	357683	357684	No one	9558	’ As the privileges of the side - table -- besides including the small prerogatives of sitting next the toast , and taking two cups of tea to other people ’s one , and always taking them at a crisis , that is to say , before putting fresh water into the tea - pot , and after it had been standing for some time -- also comprehended a full view of the company , and an opportunity of addressing them as from a rostrum , Mrs Gamp discharged the functions entrusted to her with extreme good - humour and affability . Sometimes resting her saucer on the palm of her outspread hand , and supporting her elbow on the table , she stopped between her sips of tea to favour the circle with a smile , a wink , a roll of the head , or some other mark of notice ; and at those periods her countenance was lighted up with a degree of intelligence and vivacity , which it was almost impossible to separate from the benignant influence of distilled waters . But for Mrs Gamp , it would have been a curiously silent party . Miss Pecksniff only spoke to her Augustus , and to him in whispers . Augustus spoke to nobody , but sighed for every one , and occasionally gave himself such a sounding slap upon the forehead as would make Mrs Todgers , who was rather nervous , start in her chair with an involuntary exclamation . Mrs Todgers was occupied in knitting , and seldom spoke . Poor Merry held the hand of cheerful little Ruth between her own , and listening with evident pleasure to all she said , but rarely speaking herself , sometimes smiled , and sometimes kissed her on the cheek , and sometimes turned aside to hide the tears that trembled in her eyes . Tom felt this change in her so much , and was so glad to see how tenderly Ruth dealt with her , and how she knew and answered to it , that he had not the heart to make any movement towards their departure , although he had long since given utterance to all he came to say . The old clerk , subsiding into his usual state , remained profoundly silent , while the rest of the little assembly were thus occupied , intent upon the dreams , whatever they might be , which hardly seemed to stir the surface of his sluggish thoughts . The bent of these dull fancies combining probably with the silent feasting that was going on about him , and some struggling recollection of the last approach to revelry he had witnessed , suggested a strange question to his mind . He looked round upon a sudden , and said : ‘
357681	357682	357683	357684	No one	9558	’ ‘
357686	357694	357700	357700	We	7836	’ said Merry , turning to him . ‘
357705	357706	357700	357700	We	7836	’ ‘
357710	357716	357740	357740	he	7837	’ cried the old man . ‘
357742	357743	357740	357740	he	7837	’ ‘
357748	357757	357765	357765	you	7840	’ said Merry , speaking kindly to him . ‘
357768	357769	357765	357765	you	7840	’ ‘
357772	357784	357793	357793	I	0	’ rejoined the old man , with a cry of grief . ‘
357798	357820	357829	357830	No one	9558	’ He put his hand up to his face for a moment ; and then repeated turning round exactly as before : ‘
357827	357828	357877	357877	You	7840	’ ‘
357832	357876	357882	357882	they	7843	’ said Merry . At first he gazed angrily upon her , as upon a stranger who endeavoured to deceive him ; but peering into her face , and seeing that it was indeed she , he shook his head in sorrowful compassion . ‘
357930	357983	357986	357988	some one dead	7847	’ She made a sign to them not to speak to him , which indeed they had little inclination to do ; and remained silent herself . So did he for a short time ; but then he repeated the same question with an eagerness that had a peculiar terror in it . ‘
357990	357994	358015	358015	Jonas	219	’ he said , ‘
358017	358018	358015	358015	Jonas	219	’ ‘
358023	358066	358147	358147	They	7849	’ she replied . The old man gazed at her as if he doubted what she said , or had not heard her ; and , rising from his chair , walked across the room and upstairs , whispering as he went , ‘
358070	358146	358147	358147	They	7849	’ They heard his footsteps overhead , going up into that corner of the room in which the bed stood ( it was there old Anthony had died ) ; and then they heard him coming down again immediately . His fancy was not so strong or wild that it pictured to him anything in the deserted bedchamber which was not there ; for he returned much calmer , and appeared to have satisfied himself . ‘
358153	358176	358222	358222	I	0	’ he said to Merry in his quavering voice , as he sat down again , and patted her upon the head . ‘
358225	358237	358241	358241	I	0	’ he piped out , clenching his weak , shrivelled hand . ‘
358246	358392	358408	358408	your	864	’ He said this with such trembling gaps and pauses in his want of breath , and said it in his jealous secrecy so closely in her ear , that little or nothing of it was understood by the visitors . But they had heard and seen enough of the old man to be disquieted , and to have left their seats and gathered about him ; thereby affording Mrs Gamp , whose professional coolness was not so easily disturbed , an eligible opportunity for concentrating the whole resources of her powerful mind and appetite upon the toast and butter , tea and eggs . She had brought them to bear upon those viands with such vigour that her face was in the highest state of inflammation , when she now ( there being nothing left to eat or drink ) saw fit to interpose . ‘
358400	358405	358477	358477	they	9018	’ cried Mrs Gamp , ‘
358483	358498	358522	358522	He	412	‘ em on your head , and put a mustard poultige on your back . ‘
358520	358521	358527	358528	Mrs Gamp	223	’ ‘
358530	358534	358527	358528	Mrs Gamp	223	’ said Merry . ‘
358540	358541	358549	358550	Mrs Chuzzlewit	516	’ ‘
358552	358558	358595	358595	she	223	’ replied that zealous lady , ‘
358580	358584	358595	358595	she	223	’ wexagious creetur ! ’
358599	358604	358719	358719	she	223	‘ bothering the old wictim ’
358715	358718	358719	358719	she	223	‘ There ! ’
358745	358752	358813	358813	they	7864	‘ Now , I hope , you ’re
358791	358811	358821	358821	you	412	’ said Mrs Gamp , smiling with the consciousness of at once imparting pleasure and instruction to her auditors , ‘
358823	358961	358964	358965	Mr Pinch	249	’ As this excellent woman had been formerly entrusted with the care of Mr Chuffey on a previous occasion , neither Mrs Jonas nor anybody else had the resolution to interfere directly with her mode of treatment ; though all present ( Tom Pinch and his sister especially ) appeared to be disposed to differ from her views . For such is the rash boldness of the uninitiated , that they will frequently set up some monstrous abstract principle , such as humanity , or tenderness , or the like idle folly , in obstinate defiance of all precedent and usage ; and will even venture to maintain the same against the persons who have made the precedents and established the usage , and who must therefore be the best and most impartial judges of the subject . ‘
358967	358972	359004	359005	Mr Chuffey	412	’ said Miss Pecksniff . ‘
359010	359011	359019	359019	She	2521	’ ‘
359014	359018	359019	359019	She	2521	’ cried Tom . ‘

359040	359050	359138	359139	Mr Pinch	249	’ said Cherry , raising her voice a little ; ‘
359115	359133	359134	359134	I	0	’ Augustus obeyed , and took Mrs Todgers aside to pour his griefs into her friendly bosom . ‘
359141	359155	359322	359322	I	0	’ said Charity , looking after her betrothed and glancing at her sister , ‘
359259	359321	359322	359322	I	0	’ Contented she might have been , but humble she assuredly was not . Her face and manner experienced something so widely different from humility , that Tom could not help understanding and despising the base motives that were working in her breast . He turned away , and said to Ruth , that it was time for them to go . ‘
359329	359335	359386	359386	I	0	’ said Tom to Merry , ‘
359392	359393	359396	359396	you	0	’ ‘
359398	359402	359396	359396	you	0	’ said Merry . ‘
359409	359468	359469	359469	I	0	’ She parted tenderly from Ruth , who with her brother was in the act of leaving the room , when a key was heard in the lock of the door below , and immediately afterwards a quick footstep in the passage . Tom stopped , and looked at Merry . It was Jonas , she said timidly . ‘
359481	359501	359502	359502	I	0	’ said Tom , drawing his sister ’s arm through his , and coming back a step or two . ‘

361378	361404	361414	361414	he	7904	‘ I want to know nothing , Jonas , but what you tell me . All hope of confidence between us has long deserted me ! ’

Do not break my heart too ! ’

362416	362420	362438	362439	Mr Chuzzlewit	270	’ asked Jonas . ‘
362441	362446	362438	362439	Mr Chuzzlewit	270	’ replied the nurse ; ‘

362621	362626	362627	362628	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Nothin’ more likely ! ’
362631	362645	362588	362588	He	270	‘ As well I have experienged , I do assure you , sir . ’
362646	362722	362728	362729	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Well ! Look after him for the present , and -- let me see -- three days from this time let the other woman come here , and we ’ll see if we can make a bargain of it . About nine or ten o’clock at night , say . Keep your eye upon him in the meanwhile , and do n’t talk about it . He ’s as mad as a March hare ! ’
362723	362726	362728	362729	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Madder ! ’
362731	362736	362588	362588	He	270	‘ A deal madder ! ’
362737	362760	362880	362880	he	7935	‘ See to him , then ; take care that he does no harm ; and recollect what I have told you . ’
362875	362879	362880	362880	he	7935	‘ Mr Chuff , ’
362883	362923	362880	362880	he	7935	‘ it ’ll be pretty easy to be even with YOU . It ’s of no use doing things by halves , and as long as I stop here , I ’ll take good care of you . When I ’m
362942	362959	362992	362992	I	0	’ he added , pushing away his untouched plate , and striding moodily to and fro , ‘
362971	362991	363018	363018	He	7939	’ After pacing the little room from end to end several times , he sat down in another chair . ‘
363023	363856	363865	363865	you	7940	’ He paced the room again in the same restless and unsteady way ; and then sat down upon the bedstead , leaning his chin upon his hand , and looking at the table . When he had looked at it for a long time , he remembered his supper ; and resuming the chair he had first occupied , began to eat with great rapacity ; not like a hungry man , but as if he were determined to do it . He drank too , roundly ; sometimes stopping in the middle of a draught to walk , and change his seat and walk again , and dart back to the table and fall to , in a ravenous hurry , as before . It was now growing dark . As the gloom of evening , deepening into night , came on , another dark shade emerging from within him seemed to overspread his face , and slowly change it . Slowly , slowly ; darker and darker ; more and more haggard ; creeping over him by little and little , until it was black night within him and without . The room in which he had shut himself up , was on the ground floor , at the back of the house . It was lighted by a dirty skylight , and had a door in the wall , opening into a narrow covered passage or blind - alley , very little frequented after five or six o’clock in the evening , and not in much use as a thoroughfare at any hour . But it had an outlet in a neighbouring street . The ground on which this chamber stood had , at one time , not within his recollection , been a yard ; and had been converted to its present purpose for use as an office . But the occasion for it died with the man who built it ; and saving that it had sometimes served as an apology for a spare bedroom , and that the old clerk had once held it ( but that was years ago ) as his recognized apartment , it had been little troubled by Anthony Chuzzlewit and Son . It was a blotched , stained , mouldering room , like a vault ; and there were water - pipes running through it , which at unexpected times in the night , when other things were quiet , clicked and gurgled suddenly , as if they were choking . The door into the court had not been open for a long , long time ; but the key had always hung in one place , and there it hung now . He was prepared for its being rusty ; for he had a little bottle of oil in his pocket and the feather of a pen , with which he lubricated the key and the lock too , carefully . All this while he had been without his coat , and had nothing on his feet but his stockings . He now got softly into bed in the same state , and tossed from side to side to tumble it . In his restless condition that was easily done . When he arose , he took from his portmanteau , which he had caused to be carried into that place when he came home , a pair of clumsy shoes , and put them on his feet ; also a pair of leather leggings , such as countrymen are used to wear , with straps to fasten them to the waistband . In these he dressed himself at leisure . Lastly , he took out a common frock of coarse dark jean , which he drew over his own under - clothing ; and a felt hat -- he had purposely left his own upstairs . He then sat himself down by the door , with the key in his hand , waiting . He had no light ; the time was dreary , long , and awful . The ringers were practicing in a neighbouring church , and the clashing of the bells was almost maddening . Curse the clamouring bells , they seemed to know that he was listening at the door , and to proclaim it in a crowd of voices to all the town ! Would they never be still ? They ceased at last , and then the silence was so new and terrible that it seemed the prelude to some dreadful noise . Footsteps in the court ! Two men . He fell back from the door on tiptoe , as if they could have seen him through its wooden panels . They passed on , talking ( he could make out ) about a skeleton which had been dug up yesterday , in some work of excavation near at hand , and was supposed to be that of a murdered man . ‘
363868	365073	363865	363865	you	7940	’ they said to one another as they turned the corner . Hush ! He put the key into the lock , and turned it . The door resisted for a while , but soon came stiffly open ; mingling with the sense of fever in his mouth , a taste of rust , and dust , and earth , and rotting wood . He looked out ; passed out ; locked it after him . All was clear and quiet , as he fled away . CHAPTER FORTY - SEVEN CONCLUSION OF THE ENTERPRISE OF MR JONAS AND HIS FRIEND Did no men passing through the dim streets shrink without knowing why , when he came stealing up behind them ? As he glided on , had no child in its sleep an indistinct perception of a guilty shadow falling on its bed , that troubled its innocent rest ? Did no dog howl , and strive to break its rattling chain , that it might tear him ; no burrowing rat , scenting the work he had in hand , essay to gnaw a passage after him , that it might hold a greedy revel at the feast of his providing ? When he looked back , across his shoulder , was it to see if his quick footsteps still fell dry upon the dusty pavement , or were already moist and clogged with the red mire that stained the naked feet of Cain ! He shaped his course for the main western road , and soon reached it ; riding a part of the way , then alighting and walking on again . He travelled for a considerable distance upon the roof of a stage - coach , which came up while he was afoot ; and when it turned out of his road , bribed the driver of a return post - chaise to take him on with him ; and then made across the country at a run , and saved a mile or two before he struck again into the road . At last , as his plan was , he came up with a certain lumbering , slow , night - coach , which stopped wherever it could , and was stopping then at a public - house , while the guard and coachman ate and drank within . He bargained for a seat outside this coach , and took it . And he quitted it no more until it was within a few miles of its destination , but occupied the same place all night . All night ! It is a common fancy that nature seems to sleep by night . It is a false fancy , as who should know better than he ? The fishes slumbered in the cold , bright , glistening streams and rivers , perhaps ; and the birds roosted on the branches of the trees ; and in their stalls and pastures beasts were quiet ; and human creatures slept . But what of that , when the solemn night was watching , when it never winked , when its darkness watched no less than its light ! The stately trees , the moon and shining stars , the softly stirring wind , the over - shadowed lane , the broad , bright countryside , they all kept watch . There was not a blade of growing grass or corn , but watched ; and the quieter it was , the more intent and fixed its watch upon him seemed to be . And yet he slept . Riding on among those sentinels of God , he slept , and did not change the purpose of his journey . If he forgot it in his troubled dreams , it came up steadily , and woke him . But it never woke him to remorse , or to abandonment of his design . He dreamed at one time that he was lying calmly in his bed , thinking of a moonlight night and the noise of wheels , when the old clerk put his head in at the door , and beckoned him . At this signal he arose immediately -- being already dressed in the clothes he actually wore at that time -- and accompanied him into a strange city , where the names of the streets were written on the walls in characters quite new to him ; which gave him no surprise or uneasiness , for he remembered in his dream to have been there before . Although these streets were very precipitous , insomuch that to get from one to another it was necessary to descend great heights by ladders that were too short , and ropes that moved deep bells , and swung and swayed as they were clung to , the danger gave him little emotion beyond the first thrill of terror ; his anxieties being concentrated on his dress which was quite unfitted for some festival that was about to be holden there , and in which he had come to take a part . Already , great crowds began to fill the streets , and in one direction myriads of people came rushing down an interminable perspective , strewing flowers and making way for others on white horses , when a terrible figure started from the throng , and cried out that it was the Last Day for all the world . The cry being spread , there was a wild hurrying on to Judgment ; and the press became so great that he and his companion ( who was constantly changing , and was never the same man two minutes together , though he never saw one man come or another go ) , stood aside in a porch , fearfully surveying the multitude ; in which there were many faces that he knew , and many that he did not know , but dreamed he did ; when all at once a struggling head rose up among the rest -- livid and deadly , but the same as he had known it -- and denounced him as having appointed that direful day to happen . They closed together . As he strove to free the hand in which he held a club , and strike the blow he had so often thought of , he started to the knowledge of his waking purpose and the rising of the sun . The sun was welcome to him . There were life and motion , and a world astir , to divide the attention of Day . It was the eye of Night -- of wakeful , watchful , silent , and attentive Night , with so much leisure for the observation of his wicked thoughts -- that he dreaded most . There is no glare in the night . Even Glory shows to small advantage in the night , upon a crowded battle - field . How then shows Glory ’s blood - relation , bastard Murder ! Aye ! He made no compromise , and held no secret with himself now . Murder . He had come to do it . ‘

365209	365216	365218	365219	the guard	9892	‘ Not at a handsome man , ’
365221	365251	365547	365547	They	15462	‘ If you want your fortune told , I ’ll tell you a bit of it . You wo n’t be drowned . That ’s a consolation for you . ’
365575	365599	365547	365547	They	15462	’ hoofs . They came on noisily , to where a stile and footpath indicated their point of separation . Here they stopped . ‘
365609	365614	365667	365667	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘

365689	366974	366979	366979	master	10780	’ So long as Mr Pecksniff was in sight , and turned his head at intervals to salute him , Montague stood in the road smiling , and waving his hand . But when his new partner had disappeared , and this show was no longer necessary , he sat down on the stile with looks so altered , that he might have grown ten years older in the meantime . He was flushed with wine , but not gay . His scheme had succeeded , but he showed no triumph . The effort of sustaining his difficult part before his late companion had fatigued him , perhaps , or it may be that the evening whispered to his conscience , or it may be ( as it HAS been ) that a shadowy veil was dropping round him , closing out all thoughts but the presentiment and vague foreknowledge of impending doom . If there be fluids , as we know there are , which , conscious of a coming wind , or rain , or frost , will shrink and strive to hide themselves in their glass arteries ; may not that subtle liquor of the blood perceive , by properties within itself , that hands are raised to waste and spill it ; and in the veins of men run cold and dull as his did , in that hour ! So cold , although the air was warm ; so dull , although the sky was bright ; that he rose up shivering from his seat , and hastily resumed his walk . He checked himself as hastily ; undecided whether to pursue the footpath , which was lonely and retired , or to go back by the road . He took the footpath . The glory of the departing sun was on his face . The music of the birds was in his ears . Sweet wild flowers bloomed about him . Thatched roofs of poor men ’s homes were in the distance ; and an old grey spire , surmounted by a Cross , rose up between him and the coming night . He had never read the lesson which these things conveyed ; he had ever mocked and turned away from it ; but , before going down into a hollow place , he looked round , once , upon the evening prospect , sorrowfully . Then he went down , down , down , into the dell . It brought him to the wood ; a close , thick , shadowy wood , through which the path went winding on , dwindling away into a slender sheep - track . He paused before entering ; for the stillness of this spot almost daunted him . The last rays of the sun were shining in , aslant , making a path of golden light along the stems and branches in its range , which , even as he looked , began to die away , yielding gently to the twilight that came creeping on . It was so very quiet that the soft and stealthy moss about the trunks of some old trees , seemed to have grown out of the silence , and to be its proper offspring . Those other trees which were subdued by blasts of wind in winter time , had not quite tumbled down , but being caught by others , lay all bare and scathed across their leafy arms , as if unwilling to disturb the general repose by the crash of their fall . Vistas of silence opened everywhere , into the heart and innermost recesses of the wood ; beginning with the likeness of an aisle , a cloister , or a ruin open to the sky ; then tangling off into a deep green rustling mystery , through which gnarled trunks , and twisted boughs , and ivy - covered stems , and trembling leaves , and bark - stripped bodies of old trees stretched out at length , were faintly seen in beautiful confusion . As the sunlight died away , and evening fell upon the wood , he entered it . Moving , here and there a bramble or a drooping bough which stretched across his path , he slowly disappeared . At intervals a narrow opening showed him passing on , or the sharp cracking of some tender branch denoted where he went ; then , he was seen or heard no more . Never more beheld by mortal eye or heard by mortal ear ; one man excepted . That man , parting the leaves and branches on the other side , near where the path emerged again , came leaping out soon afterwards . What had he left within the wood , that he sprang out of it as if it were a hell ! The body of a murdered man . In one thick solitary spot , it lay among the last year ’s leaves of oak and beech , just as it had fallen headlong down . Sopping and soaking in among the leaves that formed its pillow ; oozing down into the boggy ground , as if to cover itself from human sight ; forcing its way between and through the curling leaves , as if those senseless things rejected and forswore it and were coiled up in abhorrence ; went a dark , dark stain that dyed the whole summer night from earth to heaven . The doer of this deed came leaping from the wood so fiercely , that he cast into the air a shower of fragments of young boughs , torn away in his passage , and fell with violence upon the grass . But he quickly gained his feet again , and keeping underneath a hedge with his body bent , went running on towards the road . The road once reached , he fell into a rapid walk , and set on toward London . And he was not sorry for what he had done . He was frightened when he thought of it -- when did he not think of it!--but he was not sorry . He had had a terror and dread of the wood when he was in it ; but being out of it , and having committed the crime , his fears were now diverted , strangely , to the dark room he had left shut up at home . He had a greater horror , infinitely greater , of that room than of the wood . Now that he was on his return to it , it seemed beyond comparison more dismal and more dreadful than the wood . His hideous secret was shut up in the room , and all its terrors were there ; to his thinking it was not in the wood at all . He walked on for ten miles ; and then stopped at an ale - house for a coach , which he knew would pass through , on its way to London , before long ; and which he also knew was not the coach he had travelled down by , for it came from another place . He sat down outside the door here , on a bench , beside a man who was smoking his pipe . Having called for some beer , and drunk , he offered it to this companion , who thanked him , and took a draught . He could not help thinking that , if the man had known all , he might scarcely have relished drinking out of the same cup with him . ‘

If you will give me the benefit of your advice and friendly counsel , I may succeed better under your guidance . I will do anything Tom , anything , to gain a livelihood by my own exertions . My hopes do not soar above that , now . ’
371156	371165	371349	371349	Tom	249	‘ Your hopes do not soar above that ! ’
371169	371347	371349	371349	Tom	249	‘ Yes they do . How can you talk so ! They soar up to the time when you will be happy with her , Martin .

But you shall have better advice and counsel ( though you can not have more friendly ) than mine . You shall consult John Westlock . We ’ll go there immediately . It is yet so early that I shall have time to take you to his chambers before I go to business ; they are in my way ; and I can leave you there , to talk over your affairs with him . So come along . Come along . I am a man of occupation now , you know , ’
371356	371408	371422	371422	Martin	221	‘ and have no time to lose . Your hopes do n’t soar higher than that ? I dare say they do n’t . I know you , pretty well . They ’ll be soaring out of sight soon , Martin , and leaving all the rest of us leagues behind . ’

It ’s Mark ’s doing , I have no doubt ; and it serves you right for having such a grumbler for your companion . ’

John Westlock was at home , but , strange to say , was rather embarrassed to see them ; and when Tom was about to go into the room where he was breakfasting , said he had a stranger there . It appeared to be a mysterious stranger , for John shut that door as he said it , and led them into the next room . He was very much delighted , though , to see Mark Tapley ; and received Martin with his own frank courtesy . But Martin felt that he did not inspire John Westlock with any unusual interest ; and twice or thrice observed that he looked at Tom Pinch doubtfully ; not to say compassionately . He thought , and blushed to think , that he knew the cause of this . ‘

372097	372209	372213	372213	you	247	’ John Westlock replied in the negative ; and Martin , expressing himself perfectly satisfied , begged them not to say another word ; though he could not help wondering very much what curious office Tom held , and why he was so secret , and embarrassed , and unlike himself , in reference to it . Nor could he help reverting to it , in his own mind , several times after Tom went away , which he did as soon as this conversation was ended , taking Mr Tapley with him , who , as he laughingly said , might accompany him as far as Fleet Street without injury . ‘

373389	373404	373451	373452	Mr Pinch	249	’ he added by way of soliloquy , as he stood looking after him . ‘
373454	373494	373557	373557	you	247	’ While these confidences were interchanged between Tom Pinch and Mark , Martin and John Westlock were very differently engaged . They were no sooner left alone together than Martin said , with an effort he could not disguise : ‘
373583	373584	373557	373557	you	247	’ ‘
373590	373594	373615	373615	you	247	’ replied John , ‘

373619	373623	373624	373624	You	247	’ said Martin . ‘

373695	373728	373735	373735	Tom	249	’ This was not said warmly , but was energetically spoken too ; for there was no subject in the world ( but one ) on which the speaker felt so strongly . ‘
373737	373741	373845	373845	You	247	’ he pursued , ‘
373849	373867	373902	373902	I	0	’ added John , with a smile , as he subsided into more of his accustomed manner , ‘

373906	373910	373972	373972	I	0	’ said Martin ; ‘
373981	374028	373972	373972	I	0	’ It was so sincerely said , at once so modestly and manfully , that John offered him his hand as if he had not done so before ; and Martin giving his in the same open spirit , all constraint between the young men vanished . ‘
374032	374036	374161	374161	you	247	’ said John , ‘
374072	374159	374161	374161	you	247	’ With this preface , he related all the circumstances connected with his having presided over the illness and slow recovery of the patient at the Bull ; and tacked on to the skirts of that narrative Tom ’s own account of the business on the wharf . Martin was not a little puzzled when he came to an end , for the two stories seemed to have no connection with each other , and to leave him , as the phrase is , all abroad . ‘
374169	374175	374326	374327	This person	6416	’ said John , rising , ‘
374189	374325	374331	374331	Lewsome	560	’ Upon that , he left Martin to himself , in a state of considerable astonishment ; and soon came back again to fulfil his promise . Accompanying him into the next room , Martin found there a third person ; no doubt the stranger of whom his host had spoken when Tom Pinch introduced him . He was a young man ; with deep black hair and eyes . He was gaunt and pale ; and evidently had not long recovered from a severe illness . He stood as Martin entered , but sat again at John ’s desire . His eyes were cast downward ; and but for one glance at them both , half in humiliation and half in entreaty , he kept them so , and sat quite still and silent . ‘
374333	374338	374440	374441	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ said John Westlock , ‘
374392	374425	374725	374727	The young man	9590	’ As he did not move or speak , and John Westlock made a pause , Martin , not knowing what to say , said that he was glad to hear it . ‘
374443	374724	374754	374754	John	247	’ John pursued -- looking attentively at him , and not at Martin--‘he made to me for the first time yesterday , and repeated to me this morning , without the least variation of any essential particular . I have already told you that he informed me before he was removed from the Inn , that he had a secret to disclose to me which lay heavy on his mind . But , fluctuating between sickness and health and between his desire to relieve himself of it , and his dread of involving himself by revealing it , he has , until yesterday , avoided the disclosure . I never pressed him for it ( having no idea of its weight or import , or of my right to do so ) , until within a few days past ; when , understanding from him , on his own voluntary avowal , in a letter from the country , that it related to a person whose name was Jonas Chuzzlewit ; and thinking that it might throw some light on that little mystery which made Tom anxious now and then ; I urged the point upon him , and heard his statement , as you will now , from his own lips . It is due to him to say , that in the apprehension of death , he committed it to writing sometime since , and folded it in a sealed paper , addressed to me ; which he could not resolve , however , to place of his own act in my hands . He has the paper in his breast , I believe , at this moment . ’
374738	374752	374770	374770	he	247	‘ It will be well to leave that in our charge , perhaps , ’
374756	374764	374770	374770	he	247	‘ But do not mind it now . ’
374808	374817	374827	374827	Martin	221	‘ What relation was Mr Anthony Chuzzlewit , who-- ’
374818	374825	374827	374827	Martin	221	‘ --Who died -- to me ? ’
374829	374837	374770	374770	he	247	‘ He was my grandfather ’s brother . ’
374838	374849	374856	374856	Martin	221	‘ I fear he was made away with . Murdered ! ’
374850	374854	374856	374856	Martin	221	‘ My God ! ’
374858	374862	374878	374878	his	9590	‘ By whom ? ’
374884	374891	374898	374898	Martin	221	‘ I fear , by me . ’
374892	374896	374898	374898	Martin	221	‘ By you ? ’
374900	374913	374920	374920	Martin	221	‘ Not by my act , but I fear by my means . ’
374914	374918	374920	374920	Martin	221	‘ Speak out ! ’
374922	374928	374938	374938	Martin	221	‘ and speak the truth . ’
374929	374937	374947	374948	John Westlock	247	‘ I fear this IS the truth . ’
374952	374963	374964	374964	Lewsome	560	‘ Let him tell his story in his own way , ’
374969	375017	375026	375026	Martin	221	‘ I have been bred a surgeon , and for the last few years have served a general practitioner in the City , as his assistant . While I was in his employment I became acquainted with Jonas Chuzzlewit . He is the principal in this deed . ’
375018	375024	375026	375026	Martin	221	‘ What do you mean ? ’
375030	375048	375054	375054	he	221	‘ Do you know he is the son of the old man of whom you have spoken ? ’
375049	375053	375173	375173	He	221	‘ I do , ’
375076	375172	375290	375290	He	8102	‘ I have reason to know it ; for I have often heard him wish his old father dead , and complain of his being wearisome to him , and a drag upon him . He was in the habit of doing so , at a place of meeting we had -- three or four of us -- at night . There was no good in the place you may suppose , when you hear that he was the chief of the party . I wish I had died myself , and never seen it ! ’
375183	375289	375462	375462	He	8103	‘ We met to drink and game ; not for large sums , but for sums that were large to us . He generally won . Whether or no , he lent money at interest to those who lost ; and in this way , though I think we all secretly hated him , he came to be the master of us . To propitiate him we made a jest of his father ; it began with his debtors ; I was one ; and we used to toast a quicker journey to the old man , and a swift inheritance to the young one . ’
375294	375461	375476	375477	John Westlock	247	‘ One night he came there in a very bad humour . He had been greatly tried , he said , by the old man that day . He and I were alone together ; and he angrily told me , that the old man was in his second childhood ; that he was weak , imbecile , and drivelling ; as unbearable to himself as he was to other people ; and that it would be a charity to put him out of the way . He swore that he had often thought of mixing something with the stuff he took for his cough , which should help him to die easily . People were sometimes smothered who were bitten by mad dogs , he said ; and why not help these lingering old men out of their troubles too ? He looked full at me as he said so , and I looked full at him ; but it went no farther that night . ’
375479	375483	375476	375477	John Westlock	247	‘ Go on . ’
375508	375717	375731	375732	John Westlock	247	‘ It may have been a week after that , or it may have been less or more -- the matter was in my mind all the time , but I can not recollect the time , as I should any other period -- when he spoke to me again . We were alone then , too ; being there before the usual hour of assembling . There was no appointment between us ; but I think I went there to meet him , and I know he came there to meet me . He was there first . He was reading a newspaper when I went in , and nodded to me without looking up , or leaving off reading . I sat down opposite and close to him . He said , immediately , that he wanted me to get him some of two sorts of drugs . One that was instantaneous in its effect ; of which he wanted very little . One that was slow and not suspicious in appearance ; of which he wanted more . While he was speaking to me he still read the newspaper . He said “ Drugs , ” and never used any other word . Neither did I. ’
375718	375729	376006	376006	he	8104	‘ This all agrees with what I have heard before , ’
375734	376005	376006	376006	he	8104	‘ I asked him what he wanted the drugs for ? He said for no harm ; to physic cats ; what did it matter to me ? I was going out to a distant colony ( I had recently got the appointment , which , as Mr Westlock knows , I have since lost by my sickness , and which was my only hope of salvation from ruin ) , and what did it matter to me ? He could get them without my aid at half a hundred places , but not so easily as he could get them of me . This was true . He might not want them at all , he said , and he had no present idea of using them ; but he wished to have them by him . All this time he still read the newspaper . We talked about the price . He was to forgive me a small debt -- I was quite in his power -- and to pay me five pounds ; and there the matter dropped , through others coming in . But , next night , under exactly similar circumstances , I gave him the drugs , on his saying I was a fool to think that he should ever use them for any harm ; and he gave me the money . We have never met since . I only know that the poor old father died soon afterwards , just as he would have died from this cause ; and that I have undergone , and suffer now , intolerable misery . Nothing ’
376014	376031	376071	376071	Martin	221	‘ can paint my misery ! It is well deserved , but nothing can paint it . ’
376062	376069	376071	376071	Martin	221	‘ Let him remain at hand , ’
376077	376088	376096	376096	John	247	‘ but out of sight , in Heaven ’s name ! ’
376089	376095	376096	376096	John	247	‘ He will remain here , ’
376099	376104	376750	376750	he	309	‘ Come with me ! ’
376766	378291	378310	378310	his	8127	‘ bating the general zeal of Mr Tapley ’s nature , nothing was made particularly clearer by these offers of service . It was in this position of affairs that Tom ’s account of the strange behaviour of the decayed clerk , on the night of the tea - party , became of great moment , and finally convinced them that to arrive at a more accurate knowledge of the workings of that old man ’s mind and memory , would be to take a most important stride in their pursuit of the truth . So , having first satisfied themselves that no communication had ever taken place between Lewsome and Mr Chuffey ( which would have accounted at once for any suspicions the latter might entertain ) , they unanimously resolved that the old clerk was the man they wanted . But , like the unanimous resolution of a public meeting , which will oftentimes declare that this or that grievance is not to be borne a moment longer , which is nevertheless borne for a century or two afterwards , without any modification , they only reached in this the conclusion that they were all of one mind . For it was one thing to want Mr Chuffey , and another thing to get at him ; and to do that without alarming him , or without alarming Jonas , or without being discomfited by the difficulty of striking , in an instrument so out of tune and so unused , the note they sought , was an end as far from their reach as ever . The question then became , who of those about the old clerk had had most influence with him that night ? Tom said his young mistress clearly . But Tom and all of them shrunk from the thought of entrapping her , and making her the innocent means of bringing retribution on her cruel husband . Was there nobody else ? Why yes . In a very different way , Tom said , he was influenced by Mrs Gamp , the nurse ; who had once had the control of him , as he understood , for some time . They caught at this immediately . Here was a new way out , developed in a quarter until then overlooked . John Westlock knew Mrs Gamp ; he had given her employment ; he was acquainted with her place of residence : for that good lady had obligingly furnished him , at parting , with a pack of her professional cards for general distribution . It was decided that Mrs Gamp should be approached with caution , but approached without delay ; and that the depths of that discreet matron ’s knowledge of Mr Chuffey , and means of bringing them , or one of them , into communication with him , should be carefully sounded . On this service , Martin and John Westlock determined to proceed that night ; waiting on Mrs Gamp first , at her lodgings ; and taking their chance of finding her in the repose of private life , or of having to seek her out , elsewhere , in the exercise of her professional duties . Tom returned home , that he might lose no opportunity of having an interview with Nadgett , by being absent in the event of his reappearance . And Mr Tapley remained ( by his own particular desire ) for the time being in Furnival ’s Inn , to look after Lewsome ; who might safely have been left to himself , however , for any thought he seemed to entertain of giving them the slip . Before they parted on their several errands , they caused him to read aloud , in the presence of them all , the paper which he had about him , and the declaration he had attached to it , which was to the effect that he had written it voluntarily , in the fear of death and in the torture of his mind . And when he had done so , they all signed it , and taking it from him , of his free will , locked it in a place of safety . Martin also wrote , by John ’s advice , a letter to the trustees of the famous Grammar School , boldly claiming the successful design as his , and charging Mr Pecksniff with the fraud he had committed . In this proceeding also , John was hotly interested ; observing , with his usual irreverance , that Mr Pecksniff had been a successful rascal all his life through , and that it would be a lasting source of happiness to him ( John ) if he could help to do him justice in the smallest particular . A busy day ! But Martin had no lodgings yet ; so when these matters were disposed of , he excused himself from dining with John Westlock and was fain to wander out alone , and look for some . He succeeded , after great trouble , in engaging two garrets for himself and Mark , situated in a court in the Strand , not far from Temple Bar . Their luggage , which was waiting for them at a coach - office , he conveyed to this new place of refuge ; and it was with a glow of satisfaction , which as a selfish man he never could have known and never had , that , thinking how much pains and trouble he had saved Mark , and how pleased and astonished Mark would be , he afterwards walked up and down , in the Temple , eating a meat - pie for his dinner . CHAPTER FORTY - NINE IN WHICH MRS HARRIS ASSISTED BY A TEAPOT , IS THE CAUSE OF A DIVISION BETWEEN FRIENDS Mrs Gamp ’s apartment in Kingsgate Street , High Holborn , wore , metaphorically speaking , a robe of state . It was swept and garnished for the reception of a visitor . That visitor was Betsey Prig ; Mrs Prig , of Bartlemy ’s ; or as some said Barklemy ’s , or as some said Bardlemy ’s ; for by all these endearing and familiar appellations , had the hospital of Saint Bartholomew become a household word among the sisterhood which Betsey Prig adorned . Mrs Gamp ’s apartment was not a spacious one , but , to a contented mind , a closet is a palace ; and the first - floor front at Mr Sweedlepipe ’s may have been , in the imagination of Mrs Gamp , a stately pile . If it were not exactly that , to restless intellects , it at least comprised as much accommodation as any person , not sanguine to insanity , could have looked for in a room of its dimensions . For only keep the bedstead always in your mind ; and you were safe . That was the grand secret . Remembering the bedstead , you might even stoop to look under the little round table for anything you had dropped , without hurting yourself much against the chest of drawers , or qualifying as a patient of Saint Bartholomew , by falling into the fire . Visitors were much assisted in their cautious efforts to preserve an unflagging recollection of this piece of furniture , by its size ; which was great . It was not a turn - up bedstead , nor yet a French bedstead , nor yet a four - post bedstead , but what is poetically called a tent ; the sacking whereof was low and bulgy , insomuch that Mrs Gamp ’s box would not go under it , but stopped half - way , in a manner which , while it did violence to the reason , likewise endangered the legs of a stranger . The frame too , which would have supported the canopy and hangings if there had been any , was ornamented with divers pippins carved in timber , which on the slightest provocation , and frequently on none at all , came tumbling down ; harassing the peaceful guest with inexplicable terrors . The bed itself was decorated with a patchwork quilt of great antiquity ; and at the upper end , upon the side nearest to the door , hung a scanty curtain of blue check , which prevented the Zephyrs that were abroad in Kingsgate Street , from visiting Mrs Gamp ’s head too roughly . Some rusty gowns and other articles of that lady ’s wardrobe depended from the posts ; and these had so adapted themselves by long usage to her figure , that more than one impatient husband coming in precipitately , at about the time of twilight , had been for an instant stricken dumb by the supposed discovery that Mrs Gamp had hanged herself . One gentleman , coming on the usual hasty errand , had said indeed , that they looked like guardian angels ‘
378299	378308	378310	378310	his	8127	’ But that , as Mrs Gamp said , ‘
378313	378896	378901	378901	you	8128	’ and he never repeated the sentiment , though he often repeated his visit . The chairs in Mrs Gamp ’s apartment were extremely large and broad - backed , which was more than a sufficient reason for there being but two in number . They were both elbow - chairs , of ancient mahogany ; and were chiefly valuable for the slippery nature of their seats , which had been originally horsehair , but were now covered with a shiny substance of a bluish tint , from which the visitor began to slide away with a dismayed countenance , immediately after sitting down . What Mrs Gamp wanted in chairs she made up in bandboxes ; of which she had a great collection , devoted to the reception of various miscellaneous valuables , which were not , however , as well protected as the good woman , by a pleasant fiction , seemed to think ; for , though every bandbox had a carefully closed lid , not one among them had a bottom ; owing to which cause the property within was merely , as it were , extinguished . The chest of drawers having been originally made to stand upon the top of another chest , had a dwarfish , elfin look , alone ; but in regard of its security it had a great advantage over the bandboxes , for as all the handles had been long ago pulled off , it was very difficult to get at its contents . This indeed was only to be done by one or two devices ; either by tilting the whole structure forward until all the drawers fell out together , or by opening them singly with knives , like oysters . Mrs Gamp stored all her household matters in a little cupboard by the fire - place ; beginning below the surface ( as in nature ) with the coals , and mounting gradually upwards to the spirits , which , from motives of delicacy , she kept in a teapot . The chimney - piece was ornamented with a small almanack , marked here and there in Mrs Gamp ’s own hand with a memorandum of the date at which some lady was expected to fall due . It was also embellished with three profiles : one , in colours , of Mrs Gamp herself in early life ; one , in bronze , of a lady in feathers , supposed to be Mrs Harris , as she appeared when dressed for a ball ; and one , in black , of Mr Gamp , deceased . The last was a full length , in order that the likeness might be rendered more obvious and forcible by the introduction of the wooden leg . A pair of bellows , a pair of pattens , a toasting - fork , a kettle , a pap - boat , a spoon for the administration of medicine to the refractory , and lastly , Mrs Gamp ’s umbrella , which as something of great price and rarity , was displayed with particular ostentation , completed the decorations of the chimney - piece and adjacent wall . Towards these objects Mrs Gamp raised her eyes in satisfaction when she had arranged the tea - board , and had concluded her arrangements for the reception of Betsey Prig , even unto the setting forth of two pounds of Newcastle salmon , intensely pickled . ‘
378910	378920	378903	378903	Betsey	224	’ said Mrs Gamp , apostrophizing her absent friend . ‘
378949	378992	378940	378940	I	0	’m easy pleased ; it is but little as I wants ; but I must have that little of the best , and to the minute when the clock strikes , else we do not part as I could wish , but bearin ’
378999	379059	379086	379087	Betsey Prig	224	’ Her own preparations were of the best , for they comprehended a delicate new loaf , a plate of fresh butter , a basin of fine white sugar , and other arrangements on the same scale . Even the snuff with which she now refreshed herself , was so choice in quality that she took a second pinch . ‘
379070	379085	379086	379087	Betsey Prig	224	’ said Mrs Gamp , hurrying to the stair - head and looking over . ‘

379562	379630	379632	379634	the little barber	5053	‘ What a surprising young chap he was ! How he talked ! and what a deal he know’d ! Shaved in this very chair he was ; only for fun ; it was all his fun ; he was full of it . Ah ! to think that he ’ll never be shaved in earnest ! The birds might every one have died , and welcome , ’
379650	379660	379673	379674	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ sooner than I ’d have heard this news ! ’

379754	379770	379776	379776	her	223	‘ You are in a nice state of confugion , Mr Sweedlepipes , you are ! ’
379779	379821	379776	379776	her	223	‘ and my opinion is , as half - a - dudgeon fresh young lively leeches on your temples , would n’t be too much to clear your mind , which so I tell you . Wot were they a - talkin ’
379831	379832	379776	379776	her	223	’ ‘
379837	379842	379990	379990	they	1612	’ cried the barber . ‘
379991	380029	380040	380041	Mrs Gamp	223	’re looking for him high and low . Their office is a smash ; a swindle altogether . But what ’s a Life Assurance office to a Life ! And what a Life Young Bailey ’s was ! ’
380030	380038	380040	380041	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ He was born into a wale , ’
380047	380079	380085	380085	Poll	510	‘ and he lived in a wale ; and he must take the consequences of sech a sitiwation . But do n’t you hear nothink of Mr Chuzzlewit in all this ? ’
380080	380083	380233	380234	the barber	5034	‘ No , ’

Some believe he was took in , and some believe he was one of the takers - in ; but however that may be , they ca n’t prove nothing against him . This morning he went up of his own accord afore the Lord Mayor or some of them City big - wigs , and complained that he ’d been swindled , and that these two persons had gone off and cheated him , and that he had just found out that Montague ’s name was n’t even Montague , but something else . And they do say that he looked like Death , owing to his losses . But , Lord forgive me , ’
380247	380274	380288	380289	Mrs Prig	224	‘ what ’s his looks to me ! He might have died and welcome , fifty times , and not been such a loss as Bailey ! ’

380363	380385	380416	380417	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ that if perwerse people went off dead , when they was least expected , it warn’t no fault of her’n . ’
380389	380415	380469	380469	her	224	‘ that it was quite aggrawation enough to be made late when one was dropping for one ’s tea , without hearing on it again . ’

381229	381235	381274	381275	Mrs Prig	224	‘ with love and tenderness . ’

381277	381293	381308	381308	Betsey	224	‘ joining business with pleasure , wot is this case in which you wants me ? ’
381311	381317	381330	381331	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ IS it Mrs Harris ? ’

381335	381338	381340	381341	Mrs Prig	224	‘ Well ! ’

381371	381378	381443	381443	women	1237	’ Mrs Gamp retorted , warmly . ‘
381445	381458	381466	381467	Mr Harris	673	’ said Mrs Gamp , shaking her head , and shedding tears , ‘
381503	381552	381466	381467	Mr Harris	673	’ took with fits , the doctor collared him and laid him on his back upon the airy stones , and she was told to ease her mind , his owls was organs . And I have know’d her , Betsey Prig , when he has hurt her feelin ’
381556	381577	381623	381623	her	422	’ of his Ninth that it was one too many , if not two , while that dear innocent was cooin ’
381640	381697	381703	381703	her	422	’ During this touching address , Mrs Prig adroitly feigning to be the victim of that absence of mind which has its origin in excessive attention to one topic , helped herself from the teapot without appearing to observe it . Mrs Gamp observed it , however , and came to a premature close in consequence . ‘
381708	381715	381723	381723	You	8167	’ said Mrs Prig , coldly ; ‘
381721	381722	381723	381723	You	8167	’ ‘
381731	381750	381781	381782	Old Snuffey	674	’ Mrs Gamp replied , after glancing in an expressive and marked manner at the tea - pot , ‘
381779	381780	381868	381868	Chuffey	412	’ ‘
381784	381867	381868	381868	Chuffey	412	’ Mrs Prig observed . Sarah Gamp looked at her with an eye of fire , for she saw in this mistake of Mrs Prig , another willful and malignant stab at that same weakness or custom of hers , an ungenerous allusion to which , on the part of Betsey , had first disturbed their harmony that evening . And she saw it still more clearly , when , politely but firmly correcting that lady by the distinct enunciation of the word ‘
381870	382117	381868	381868	Chuffey	412	’ Mrs Prig received the correction with a diabolical laugh . The best among us have their failings , and it must be conceded of Mrs Prig , that if there were a blemish in the goodness of her disposition , it was a habit she had of not bestowing all its sharp and acid properties upon her patients ( as a thoroughly amiable woman would have done ) , but of keeping a considerable remainder for the service of her friends . Highly pickled salmon , and lettuces chopped up in vinegar , may , as viands possessing some acidity of their own , have encouraged and increased this failing in Mrs Prig ; and every application to the teapot certainly did ; for it was often remarked of her by her friends , that she was most contradictory when most elevated . It is certain that her countenance became about this time derisive and defiant , and that she sat with her arms folded , and one eye shut up , in a somewhat offensive , because obstrusively intelligent , manner . Mrs Gamp observing this , felt it the more necessary that Mrs Prig should know her place , and be made sensible of her exact station in society , as well as of her obligations to herself . She therefore assumed an air of greater patronage and importance , as she went on to answer Mrs Prig a little more in detail . ‘
382123	382128	382190	382190	Betsey	224	’ said Mrs Gamp , ‘
382203	382376	382412	382412	She	224	’ took care on , and has said to me , “ Mrs Gamp , WILL you undertake it ? We could n’t think , ” they says , “ of trusting him to nobody but you , for , Sairey , you are gold as has passed the furnage . Will you undertake it , at your own price , day and night , and by your own self ? ” “ No , ” I says , “ I will not . Do not reckon on it . There is , ” I says , “ but one creetur in the world as I would undertake on sech terms , and her name is Harris . But , ” I says , “ I am acquainted with a friend , whose name is Betsey Prig , that I can recommend , and will assist me . Betsey , ” I says , “ is always to be trusted under me , and will be guided as I could desire . ” ’
382430	382442	382491	382492	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ No , Betsey ! Drink fair , wotever you do ! ’
382495	382500	382508	382509	Betsey Prig	224	‘ Mrs Harris , Betsey-- ’

383169	383319	383149	383149	You	0	’ She was prevented from witnessing the actual retirement of Mrs Prig from the room , notwithstanding the great desire she had expressed to behold it , by that lady , in her angry withdrawal , coming into contact with the bedstead , and bringing down the previously mentioned pippins ; three or four of which came rattling on the head of Mrs Gamp so smartly , that when she recovered from this wooden shower - bath , Mrs Prig was gone . She had the satisfaction , however , of hearing the deep voice of Betsey , proclaiming her injuries and her determination to have nothing to do with Mr Chuffey , down the stairs , and along the passage , and even out in Kingsgate Street . Likewise of seeing in her own apartment , in the place of Mrs Prig , Mr Sweedlepipe and two gentlemen . ‘
383326	383332	383430	383430	He	8186	’ exclaimed the little barber , ‘
383438	383470	383473	383474	Mr Sweedlepipes	556	’ Mrs Gamp had in the meanwhile sunk into her chair , from whence , turning up her overflowing eyes , and clasping her hands , she delivered the following lamentation : ‘
383497	383523	383599	383600	Mrs Gamp	223	’ beknown , wot I have took from Betsey Prig this blessed night , no mortial creetur knows ! If she had abuged me , bein ’

383609	383614	383683	383683	John	247	‘ nor worms forget ! ’

384436	384440	384442	384442	John	247	‘ Quite true , ’

384698	384743	384688	384688	I	0	’ The severely ironical character of this reply was strengthened by a very slow nod , and a still slower drawing down of the corners of Mrs Gamp ’s mouth . She added with extreme stateliness of manner after indulging in a short doze : ‘
384750	384760	384899	384899	herself	13980	’ of you gentlemen , and time is precious . ’

385048	385055	385061	385061	he	221	‘ What shall we do now ? ’
385056	385060	385075	385075	her	13980	‘ Stay here , ’

385284	385292	385293	385293	he	678	‘ And I would n’t , Tom , ’
385301	385332	385777	385777	Tom	638	‘ I would n’t have a shadow on her happy face , or an uneasy thought in her gentle heart , for all the wealth and honours of the universe ! ’

385810	385833	385843	385843	Tom	638	‘ To hear you feign that interest in anything that happens to me , hurts me even more than your ungenerous dealing . ’

Was it true , Tom ! Was it honest ! Was it worthy of what you used to be -- of what I am sure you used to be -- to tempt me , when you had turned against me , into pouring out my heart ! Oh , Tom ! ’
386019	386028	386030	386030	Martin	221	‘ I protest , as I must die , ’
386032	386123	386164	386164	he	221	‘ that I grieve over the loss of what I thought you ; and have no anger in the recollection of my own injuries . It is only at such a time , and after such a discovery , that we know the full measure of our old regard for the subject of it . I swear , little as I showed it -- little as I know I showed it -- that when I had the least consideration for you , Tom , I loved you like a brother . ’

There is no truth whatever in the impression under which you labour . It is a delusion from first to last ; and I warn you that you will deeply regret the wrong you do me . I can honestly say that I have been true to you , and to myself . You will be very sorry for this . Indeed , you will be very sorry for it , Martin . ’

386311	386399	386410	386410	Martin	221	‘ if I had always been what you charge me with being now , and had never had a place in your regard , but had always been despised by you , and had always deserved it , you should tell me in what you have found me to be treacherous ; and on what grounds you proceed . I do not intreat you , therefore , to give me that satisfaction as a favour , Martin , but I ask it of you as a right . ’
386400	386408	386410	386410	Martin	221	‘ My own eyes are my witnesses , ’

386582	386607	386615	386615	Martin	221	‘ of course not . I said so . Why , tut , tut , tut . What a silly little thing you are ! ’
386608	386613	386615	386615	Martin	221	‘ I never meant , ’
386619	386721	386729	386729	Tom	638	‘ to appeal to you against your brother . Do not think me so unmanly and unkind . I merely appealed to you to hear my declaration , that I came here for no purpose of reproach -- I have not one reproach to vent -- but in deep regret . You could not know in what bitterness of regret , unless you knew how often I have thought of Tom ; how long in almost hopeless circumstances , I have looked forward to the better estimation of his friendship ; and how steadfastly I have believed and trusted in him . ’
386722	386727	386729	386729	Tom	638	‘ Tut , tut , ’
386740	386764	386777	386777	Martin	221	‘ He is mistaken . He is deceived . Why should you mind ? He is sure to be set right at last . ’

386794	386799	386800	386800	Martin	221	‘ And it will ! ’
386812	386843	386853	386853	Tom	638	‘ You have chosen for yourself , Tom , and will be relieved by our parting . It is not an angry one . There is no anger on my side-- ’
386844	386851	387059	387059	Martin	221	‘ There is none on mine , ’
386855	387057	387219	387219	Martin	221	‘ --It is merely what you have brought about , and worked to bring about . I say again , you have chosen for yourself . You have made the choice that might have been expected in most people situated as you are , but which I did not expect in you . For that , perhaps , I should blame my own judgment more than you . There is wealth and favour worth having , on one side ; and there is the worthless friendship of an abandoned , struggling fellow , on the other . You were free to make your election , and you made it ; and the choice was not difficult . But those who have not the courage to resist such temptations , should have the courage to avow what they have yielded to them ; and I DO blame you for this , Tom : that you received me with a show of warmth , encouraged me to be frank and plain - spoken , tempted me to confide in you , and professed that you were able to be mine ; when you had sold yourself to others . I do not believe , ’
387182	387183	387219	387219	Martin	221	’ ‘
387187	387211	387224	387224	You	638	’ said Tom ; who , had not removed his mild gaze from Martin ’s face since the commencement of this last address ; ‘
387235	387236	387256	387256	You	638	’ ‘
387241	387255	387350	387350	You	221	’ returned Martin , waving his hand , and moving towards the door . ‘

387411	387458	387459	387459	He	8223	’ And he was gone . Tom led his little sister to her chair , and sat down in his own . He took his book , and read , or seemed to read . Presently he said aloud , turning a leaf as he spoke : ‘
387467	387499	387511	387512	Dear Tom	493	’ And a tear stole down his face , and dropped upon the page . Ruth nestled down beside him on her knees , and clasped her arms about his neck . ‘
387514	387515	387516	387516	I	0	’ ‘
387522	387526	387516	387516	I	0	’ said Tom . ‘

387542	387546	387556	387556	He	8223	’ cried Ruth . ‘

387573	387593	387556	387556	He	8223	’ More closely yet , she nestled down about him ; and wept as if her heart would break . ‘
387600	387604	387607	387607	you	493	’ said Tom . ‘
387615	387630	387679	387679	You	493	’ Then in a burst of tears , it all broke out at last . ‘
387688	387734	387679	387679	You	493	’ Tom made a motion with his hand as if he would have put his sister hurriedly away ; but it clasped upon hers , and all his little history was written in the action . All its pathetic eloquence was in the silent touch . ‘
387740	387744	387952	387952	I	0	’ said Ruth , ‘
387870	387951	388019	388019	My	0	’ And still she hid her face from Tom , and clasped him round the neck , and wept for him , and poured out all her woman ’s heart and soul in the relief and pain of this disclosure . It was not very long before she and Tom were sitting side by side , and she was looking with an earnest quietness in Tom ’s face . Then Tom spoke to her thus , cheerily , though gravely : ‘
387998	388018	388019	388019	My	0	’ Tom ’s eyes glistened when he spoke of her affection ; and he kissed her on the cheek . ‘
388023	388027	388089	388089	you	8944	’ said Tom ; ‘
388094	388125	388156	388156	You	8944	’ She gave Tom such a significant little look , that he was obliged to take it for an answer whether he would or no ; and to go on . ‘
388164	388165	388156	388156	You	8944	’ ‘
388168	388173	388156	388156	You	8944	’ she said directly . ‘
388176	388180	388194	388194	you	8944	’ rejoined Tom , ‘
388197	388206	388220	388220	she	8231	’ said Tom , with a grave smile , ‘
388229	388230	388220	388220	she	8231	’ ‘
388237	388247	388251	388251	me	0	’ Tom shook his head , and smiled again . ‘
388255	388259	388391	388391	you	8944	’ said Tom , ‘

388414	388419	388428	388428	your	638	’ she added timidly , ‘
388433	388455	388428	388428	your	638	’ Tom thought of disputing the position . But it would have been mere folly , and he gave it up . ‘
388459	388463	388754	388754	I	0	’ said Tom , ‘
388741	388746	388832	388832	She	8248	’ said Tom stoutly . ‘
388804	388831	388832	388832	She	8248	’ She could not speak to him , but she loved him , as he well deserved . Even as he deserved , she loved him . ‘
388839	388849	388920	388920	you	8250	’ said Tom , with a glow of pride , ‘
388922	388930	388934	388934	I	0	’ said Tom , with a smile , ‘
388944	389109	389117	389117	I	0	’ They had never taken such a pleasant walk as they took that night . Tom told her all so freely and so simply , and was so desirous to return her tenderness with his fullest confidence , that they prolonged it far beyond their usual hour , and sat up late when they came home . And when they parted for the night there was such a tranquil , beautiful expression in Tom ’s face , that she could not bear to shut it out , but going back on tiptoe to his chamber - door , looked in and stood there till he saw her , and then embracing him again , withdrew . And in her prayers and in her sleep -- good times to be remembered with such fervour , Tom!--his name was uppermost . When he was left alone , Tom pondered very much on this discovery of hers , and greatly wondered what had led her to it . ‘
389112	389116	389204	389204	me	0	’ thought Tom , ‘
389206	389210	389245	389245	she	8251	’ said Tom . ‘
389220	389243	389248	389248	she	8251	’ Tom could not get it out of his head . There it was , when his head was on his pillow . ‘
389257	389269	389786	389786	I	0	’ thought Tom , recalling all the little incidents and circumstances ; ‘
389292	389776	389786	389786	I	0	’ Tom little thought how natural it was . Tom little knew that there was that in Ruth ’s own heart , but newly set there , which had helped her to the reading of his mystery . Ah , Tom ! He did n’t understand the whispers of the Temple Fountain , though he passed it every day . Who so lively and cheerful as busy Ruth next morning ! Her early tap at Tom ’s door , and her light foot outside , would have been music to him though she had not spoken . But she said it was the brightest morning ever seen ; and so it was ; and if it had been otherwise , she would have made it so to Tom . She was ready with his neat breakfast when he went downstairs , and had her bonnet ready for the early walk , and was so full of news , that Tom was lost in wonder . She might have been up all night , collecting it for his entertainment . There was Mr Nadgett not come home yet , and there was bread down a penny a loaf , and there was twice as much strength in this tea as in the last , and the milk - woman ’s husband had come out of the hospital cured , and the curly - headed child over the way had been lost all yesterday , and she was going to make all sorts of preserves in a desperate hurry , and there happened to be a saucepan in the house which was the very saucepan for the purpose ; and she knew all about the last book Tom had brought home , all through , though it was a teaser to read ; and she had so much to tell him that she had finished breakfast first . Then she had her little bonnet on , and the tea and sugar locked up , and the keys in her reticule , and the flower , as usual , in Tom ’s coat , and was in all respects quite ready to accompany him , before Tom knew she had begun to prepare . And in short , as Tom said , with a confidence in his own assertion which amounted to a defiance of the public in general , there never was such a little woman . She made Tom talkative . It was impossible to resist her . She put such enticing questions to him ; about books , and about dates of churches , and about organs and about the Temple , and about all kinds of things . Indeed , she lightened the way ( and Tom ’s heart with it ) to that degree , that the Temple looked quite blank and solitary when he parted from her at the gate . ‘
389789	390120	390138	390138	I	0	’ thought Tom , as he ascended the stairs . Not yet , at any rate , for the door was closed as usual , and Tom opened it with his key . He had got the books into perfect order now , and had mended the torn leaves , and had pasted up the broken backs , and substituted neat labels for the worn - out letterings . It looked a different place , it was so orderly and neat . Tom felt some pride in comtemplating the change he had wrought , though there was no one to approve or disapprove of it . He was at present occupied in making a fair copy of his draught of the catalogue ; on which , as there was no hurry , he was painfully concentrating all the ingenious and laborious neatness he had ever expended on map or plan in Mr Pecksniff ’s workroom . It was a very marvel of a catalogue ; for Tom sometimes thought he was really getting his money too easily , and he had determined within himself that this document should take a little of his superfluous leisure out of him . So with pens and ruler , and compasses and india - rubber , and pencil , and black ink , and red ink , Tom worked away all the morning . He thought a good deal about Martin , and their interview of yesterday , and would have been far easier in his mind if he could have resolved to confide it to his friend John , and to have taken his opinion on the subject . But besides that he knew what John ’s boiling indignation would be , he bethought himself that he was helping Martin now in a matter of great moment , and that to deprive the latter of his assistance at such a crisis of affairs , would be to inflict a serious injury upon him . ‘
390129	390137	390143	390143	myself	0	’ said Tom , with a sigh . ‘
390145	390208	390143	390143	myself	0	’ And to work he went again , more assiduously than ever , with the pens , and the ruler , and the india - rubber , and the pencils , and the red ink , that he might forget it . He had laboured away another hour or more , when he heard a footstep in the entry , down below . ‘
390211	390220	390240	390240	I	0	’ said Tom , looking towards the door ; ‘
390246	390256	390240	390240	I	0	’ The footstep came on , up the stairs . ‘
390269	390275	390281	390281	Nobody	9017	’ said Tom , counting . ‘
390291	390477	390478	390478	You	8256	’ The person did , certainly , but only to take breath ; for up the footstep came again . Forty , forty - one , forty - two , and so on . The door stood open . As the tread advanced , Tom looked impatiently and eagerly towards it . When a figure came upon the landing , and arriving in the doorway , stopped and gazed at him , he rose up from his chair , and half believed he saw a spirit . Old Martin Chuzzlewit ! The same whom he had left at Mr Pecksniff ’s , weak and sinking ! The same ? No , not the same , for this old man , though old , was strong , and leaned upon his stick with a vigorous hand , while with the other he signed to Tom to make no noise . One glance at the resolute face , the watchful eye , the vigorous hand upon the staff , the triumphant purpose in the figure , and such a light broke in on Tom as blinded him . ‘
390483	390487	390478	390478	You	8256	’ said Martin , ‘
390492	390493	390494	390494	I	0	’ ‘
390504	390508	390512	390512	I	0	’ said Tom ; ‘

390586	390604	390693	390693	You	8256	’ He had by this time come up to Tom , and now he grasped his hand . ‘
390743	390783	390855	390855	Tom	249	’ He stopped , even in the passion of his speech -- if that can be called passion which was so resolute and steady -- to press Tom ’s hand again . Then he said , in great excitement : ‘
390812	390854	391246	391246	Jonas	219	’ said the old man , hurriedly -- his eyes and whole face brightening as he spoke--‘will make amends for all . I would n’t have him die or hang himself , for millions of golden pieces ! Close the door ! ’
391229	391244	391246	391246	Jonas	219	‘ He shall be gagged if he speaks , and pinioned if he writes , ’
391258	391273	391669	391669	he	219	‘ He is mad enough for that ; I ’ll go through with it ! ’
391648	391667	392014	392016	the old man	991	‘ Look here ! Do you know of this ? Is it found ? Do you suspect ME ? ’
392001	392012	392165	392165	She	1248	‘ She went to her good friend , Mrs Todgers , ’
392174	392180	392203	392203	She	1248	‘ Left there ! Alone ? ’
392192	392202	392242	392244	the old man	991	‘ Curse you for a fool . Bring candles ! ’
392235	392240	392285	392285	He	219	‘ Give her up ! ’
392246	392284	392312	392314	the old man	991	‘ Come ! Give her up to me ! Tell me what you have done with her . Quick ! I have made no promises on that score . Tell me what you have done with her . ’
392303	392310	392312	392314	the old man	991	‘ You shall not leave me ! ’
392316	392344	392419	392419	Chuffey	412	‘ I am strong enough to cry out to the neighbours , and I will , unless you give her up . Give her up to me ! ’
392406	392417	392419	392419	Chuffey	412	‘ I will know what you have done with her ! ’
392421	392446	392456	392456	Jonas	219	‘ If you hurt a hair of her head , you shall answer it . Poor thing ! Poor thing ! Where is she ? ’
392447	392454	392456	392456	Jonas	219	‘ Why , you old madman ! ’
392468	392478	392499	392499	Chuffey	412	‘ What Bedlam fit has come upon you now ? ’
392479	392497	392499	392499	Chuffey	412	‘ It is enough to make me mad , seeing what I have seen in this house ! ’
392501	392576	392600	392600	he	219	‘ Where is my dear old master ! Where is his only son that I have nursed upon my knee , a child ! Where is she , she who was the last ; she that I ’ve seen pining day by day , and heard weeping in the dead of night ! She was the last , the last of all my friends ! Heaven help me , she was the very last ! ’
392603	392658	392670	392670	Chuffey	412	‘ Did you hear me ask for her ? Did you hear me send for her ? How can I give you up what I have n’t got , idiot ! Ecod , I ’d give her up to you and welcome , if I could ; and a precious pair you ’d be ! ’
392659	392668	392600	392600	he	219	‘ If she has come to any harm , ’
392672	392676	392698	392698	Devil	548	‘ mind ! I ’m
392696	392697	392698	392698	Devil	548	’ ‘
392702	392713	392758	392758	you	8309	’ interrupted Jonas , but in a suppressed voice still ; ‘
392760	392761	392758	392758	you	8309	’ ‘
392764	392770	392851	392851	You	0	’ exclaimed the old man . ‘
392825	392850	392856	392856	you	0	’ he stammered , as he crept back to his chair , and turned a threatening , though a feeble , look upon him . ‘
392858	392862	393029	393029	you	0	’ thought Jonas . ‘
392890	393024	393039	393039	you	0	’ He had made a poor show of playing the bully and evincing a desire to conciliate at the same time , but was so afraid of the old man that great drops had started out upon his brow ; and they stood there yet . His unusual tone of voice and agitated manner had sufficiently expressed his fear ; but his face would have done so now , without that aid , as he again walked to and fro , glancing at him by the candelight . He stopped at the window to think . An opposite shop was lighted up ; and the tradesman and a customer were reading some printed bill together across the counter . The sight brought him back , instantly , to the occupation he had forgotten . ‘
393043	393050	393039	393039	you	0	’ A hand upon the door . ‘
393055	393056	393067	393068	Mrs Gamp	223	’ ‘
393060	393062	393067	393068	Mrs Gamp	223	’ , ’
393070	393105	393150	393150	Jonas	219	‘ though warm , which , bless you , Mr Chuzzlewit , we must expect when cowcumbers is three for twopence . How does Mr Chuffey find his self to - night , sir ? ’
393141	393148	393150	393150	Jonas	219	‘ Get him to his room , ’
393163	393188	393196	393197	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ He has been raving to - night -- stark mad . Do n’t talk while he ’s here , but come down again . ’
393189	393194	393196	393197	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ Poor sweet dear ! ’
393203	393211	393220	393220	Jonas	219	‘ He ’s all of a tremble . ’
393212	393218	393220	393220	Jonas	219	‘ Well he may be , ’
393222	393235	393256	393257	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ after the mad fit he has had . Get him upstairs . ’
393246	393254	393256	393257	Mrs Gamp	223	‘ There ’s my blessed old chick ! ’
393270	393275	393299	393299	you	219	‘ There ’s my darlin ’
393300	393304	393326	393326	Sairey	501	’re a - shakin ’
393328	393329	393326	393326	Sairey	501	’ ‘
393335	393341	393342	393342	She	501	’ inquired the old man . ‘
393349	393354	393366	393366	Sairey	501	’ returned Mrs Gamp . ‘
393368	393470	393582	393582	she	223	’ The good woman had no reference to any female in the world in promising this speedy advent of the person for whom Mr Chuffey inquired , but merely threw it out as a means of pacifying the old man . It had its effect , for he permitted her to lead him away ; and they quitted the room together . Jonas looked out of the window again . They were still reading the printed paper in the shop opposite , and a third man had joined in the perusal . What could it be , to interest them so ? ’
393586	393593	393582	393582	she	223	‘ Mr Chuffey is a - lyin ’
393596	393603	393582	393582	she	223	’ said Mrs Gamp , returning , ‘
393628	393629	393582	393582	she	223	’ ‘
393633	393639	393650	393652	the other woman	15431	’ said Jonas , hoarsely , ‘
393654	393655	393656	393658	The other person	8320	’ ‘
393664	393668	393678	393678	He	8316	’ she answered . ‘
393673	393677	393751	393751	I	0	’ said Jonas . ‘
393749	393750	393751	393751	I	0	’ ‘
393756	393761	393774	393774	she	224	’ said Mrs Gamp . ‘
393771	393772	393774	393774	she	224	’ ‘
393778	393783	393809	393809	her	224	’ said Mrs Gamp ; ‘
393805	393806	393809	393809	her	224	’ ‘
393812	393838	393849	393849	Her	224	’ asked Jonas . Mrs Gamp looked at him in an odd way without returning any answer , but appeared to understand the question too . ‘
393844	393848	393859	393859	Harris	678	’ repeated Jonas . ‘
393852	393857	393859	393859	Harris	678	’ said Mrs Gamp , ‘
393861	393983	394009	394009	You	8323	’ It was extraordinary how much effort it cost Mrs Gamp to pronounce the name she was commonly so ready with . She made some three or four gasps before she could get it out ; and , when she had uttered it , pressed her hand upon her side , and turned up her eyes , as if she were going to faint away . But , knowing her to labour under a complication of internal disorders , which rendered a few drops of spirits indispensable at certain times to her existence , and which came on very strong when that remedy was not at hand , Jonas merely supposed her to be the victim of one of these attacks . ‘
393986	394008	394021	394021	you	8323	’ he said , hastily , for he felt how incapable he was of confining his wandering attention to the subject . ‘
394023	394040	394021	394021	you	8323	’ Mrs Gamp replied in the affirmative , and softly discharged herself of her familiar phrase , ‘
394052	394066	394092	394092	We	8326	’ But she spoke so tremulously that she felt called upon to add , ‘
394080	394091	394196	394196	he	8325	’ Jonas stopped to listen . Then said , hurriedly : ‘
394174	394183	394234	394234	me	0	’ Mrs Gamp assented with a short groan . ‘
394239	394240	394234	394234	me	0	’ ‘
394247	394252	394266	394266	I	0	’ said Mrs Gamp . ‘
394267	394270	394297	394297	she	223	’m busy . ’
394287	394296	394297	394297	she	223	‘ It is your wishes , Mr Chuzzlewit , ’
394307	394317	394372	394372	Martin	563	‘ to see the t’other person . Is it ? ’
394362	394370	394372	394372	Martin	563	‘ Let no one leave the house , ’
394374	394427	394443	394443	Jonas	219	‘ This man is my brother ’s son . Ill - met , ill - trained , ill - begotten . If he moves from the spot on which he stands , or speaks a word above his breath to any person here , open the window , and call for help ! ’
394428	394441	394443	394443	Jonas	219	‘ What right have you to give such directions in this house ? ’
394446	394459	394684	394684	he	563	‘ The right of your wrong - doing . Come in there ! ’
394677	394683	394684	394684	he	563	‘ I know that fellow , ’
394702	394721	394765	394765	you	8343	‘ He ’s the greatest liar alive . What ’s his last tale ? Ha , ha ! You ’re
394768	394789	394825	394825	I	0	’ he added , looking fiercely at John Westlock and Mark Tapley ( the latter had entered with Lewsome ) , ‘
394823	394824	394825	394825	I	0	’ ‘
394830	394838	394890	394890	sir	864	’ cried Mr Tapley , coming forward , ‘
394892	394899	394890	394890	sir	864	’ this was to old Martin . ‘
394903	394929	394955	394955	him	8352	’ wagabond upon his knees ! If he wants noise , he shall have enough of it ; for as sure as he ’s a shiverin ’
394964	394973	395048	395048	he	563	’m a man of my word or not . ’
395041	395047	395048	395048	he	563	‘ This is the man , ’
395057	395061	395052	395052	his	563	‘ Is it ? ’
395062	395088	395052	395052	his	563	‘ You need do no more than look at him to be sure of that , or of the truth of what I have said , ’
395093	395099	395107	395108	old Martin	563	‘ He is my witness . ’
395100	395105	395107	395108	old Martin	563	‘ Oh , brother ! ’
395119	395204	395315	395315	he	563	‘ Oh , brother , brother ! Were we strangers half our lives that you might breed a wretch like this , and I make life a desert by withering every flower that grew about me ! Is it the natural end of your precepts and mine , that this should be the creature of your rearing , training , teaching , hoarding , striving for ; and I the means of bringing him to punishment , when nothing can repair the wasted past ! ’
395235	395314	395315	395315	he	563	‘ But the accursed harvest of our mistaken lives shall be trodden down . It is not too late for that . You are confronted with this man , you monster there ; not to be spared , but to be dealt with justly . Hear what he says ! Reply , be silent , contradict , repeat , defy , do what you please . My course will be the same . Go on ! And you , ’
395320	395335	395347	395349	the old man	991	‘ for the love of your old friend , speak out , good fellow ! ’
395336	395345	395430	395430	Chuffey	412	‘ I have been silent for his love ! ’
395351	395428	395464	395464	he	563	‘ He urged me to it . He made me promise it upon his dying bed . I never would have spoken , but for your finding out so much . I have thought about it ever since ; I could n’t help that ; and sometimes I have had it all before me in a dream ; but in the day - time , not in sleep . Is there such a kind of dream ? ’
395458	395463	395464	395464	he	563	‘ Ah , aye ! ’
395467	395503	395517	395517	Martin	563	‘ He often spoke to me like that . We were at school together , he and I. I could n’t turn against his son , you know -- his only son , Mr Chuzzlewit ! ’
395504	395515	395531	395533	the old man	991	‘ I would to Heaven you had been his son ! ’
395519	395529	395531	395533	the old man	991	‘ You speak so like my dear old master , ’
395539	395618	395663	395663	Chuffey	412	‘ that I almost think I hear him . I can hear you quite as well as I used to hear him . It makes me young again . He never spoke unkindly to me , and I always understood him . I could always see him too , though my sight was dim . Well , well ! He ’s dead , he ’s dead . He was very good to me , my dear old master ! ’
395648	395661	395686	395688	the old man	991	‘ I could n’t turn against his only son , you know , ’
395665	395684	395686	395688	the old man	991	‘ He has nearly driven me to do it sometimes ; he very nearly did tonight . Ah ! ’
395698	395709	395719	395720	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	‘ Where is she ? She ’s not come home ! ’
395710	395717	395719	395720	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	‘ Do you mean his wife ? ’
395722	395725	395762	395762	Jonas	219	‘ Yes . ’
395726	395761	396052	396052	he	8367	‘ I have removed her . She is in my care , and will be spared the present knowledge of what is passing here . She has known misery enough , without that addition . ’
396067	396075	396078	396078	you	219	‘ No , no , no ! you ’re
396079	396098	396107	396111	his old master ’s brother	8368	’re wrong -- all wrong together ! Have patience , for the truth is only known to me ! ’
396099	396105	396107	396111	his old master ’s brother	8368	‘ How can that be , ’
396113	396151	396164	396164	Chuffey	412	‘ after what you have heard ? Besides , you said just now , above - stairs , when I told you of the accusation against him , that you knew he was his father ’s murderer . ’
396152	396162	396219	396219	He	412	‘ Aye , yes ! and so he was ! ’
396168	396218	396271	396272	old Chuffey	412	‘ But not as you suppose -- not as you suppose . Stay ! Give me a moment ’s time . I have it all here -- all here ! It was foul , foul , cruel , bad ; but not as you suppose . Stay , stay ! ’
396266	396269	396271	396272	old Chuffey	412	‘ Yes ! ’
396274	396367	396434	396435	Mr Chuffey	412	‘ yes ! That ’s how it was . It ’s all upon me now . He -- he got up from his bed before he died , to be sure , to say that he forgave him ; and he came down with me into this room ; and when he saw him -- his only son , the son he loved -- his speech forsook him ; he had no speech for what he knew -- and no one understood him except me . But I did -- I did ! ’
396437	396444	396453	396453	Chuffey	412	‘ the sweetest old creetur goin’ . ’
396445	396451	396453	396453	Chuffey	412	‘ He bought the stuff , ’
396476	396599	396698	396698	Chuffey	412	‘ he bought the stuff , no doubt , as you have heard , and brought it home . He mixed the stuff -- look at him!--with some sweetmeat in a jar , exactly as the medicine for his father ’s cough was mixed , and put it in a drawer ; in that drawer yonder in the desk ; he knows which drawer I mean ! He kept it there locked up . But his courage failed him or his heart was touched -- my God ! I hope it was his heart ! He was his only son!--and he did not put it in the usual place , where my old master would have taken it twenty times a day . ’
396688	396696	396913	396913	Jonas	219	‘ I know it every word now ! ’
396700	396912	396948	396950	the old clerk	3736	‘ Every word ! He put it in that drawer , as I have said . He went so often there , and was so secret , that his father took notice of it ; and when he was out , had it opened . We were there together , and we found the mixture -- Mr Chuzzlewit and I. He took it into his possession , and made light of it at the time ; but in the night he came to my bedside , weeping , and told me that his own son had it in his mind to poison him . “ Oh , Chuff , ” he said , “ oh , dear old Chuff ! a voice came into my room to - night , and told me that this crime began with me . It began when I taught him to be too covetous of what I have to leave , and made the expectation of it his great business ! ” Those were his words ; aye , they are his very words ! If he was a hard man now and then , it was for his only son . He loved his only son , and he was always good to me ! ’
396926	396946	396953	396953	he	3736	‘ “ He shall not weary for my death , Chuff ; ” that was what he said next , ’
396958	397126	397181	397181	Chuffey	428	‘ that was what he said next , crying like a little child : “ He shall not weary for my death , Chuff . He shall have it now ; he shall marry where he has a fancy , Chuff , although it do n’t please me ; and you and I will go away and live upon a little . I always loved him ; perhaps he ’ll love me then . It ’s a dreadful thing to have my own child thirsting for my death . But I might have known it . I have sown , and I must reap . He shall believe that I am taking this ; and when I see that he is sorry , and has all he wants , I ’ll tell him that I found it out , and I ’ll forgive him . He ’ll make a better man of his own son , and be a better man himself , perhaps , Chuff ! ” ’
397169	397179	397181	397181	Chuffey	428	‘ My dear old master made believe next day , ’
397183	397297	397355	397355	Chuffey	428	‘ that he had opened the drawer by mistake with a key from the bunch , which happened to fit it ( we had one made and hung upon it ) ; and that he had been surprised to find his fresh supply of cough medicine in such a place , but supposed it had been put there in a hurry when the drawer stood open . We burnt it ; but his son believed that he was taking it -- he knows he did . Once Mr Chuzzlewit , to try him , took heart to say it had a strange taste ; and he got up directly , and went out . ’
397332	397353	397355	397355	Chuffey	428	‘ Mr Chuzzlewit wrote to her father ; I mean the father of the poor thing who ’s his wife , ’
397357	397484	397574	397574	he	219	‘ and got him to come up , intending to hasten on the marriage . But his mind , like mine , went a little wrong through grief , and then his heart broke . He sank and altered from the time when he came to me in the night ; and never held up his head again . It was only a few days , but he had never changed so much in twice the years . “ Spare him , Chuff ! ” he said , before he died . They were the only words he could speak . “ Spare him , Chuff ! ” I promised him I would . I ’ve tried to do it . He ’s his only son . ’
397570	397573	397574	397574	he	219	‘ Well ! ’
397581	397605	397640	397640	Pecksniff	218	‘ Are you satisfied ? or have you any more of your plots to broach ? Why that fellow , Lewsome , can invent ‘
397622	397630	397656	397656	I	0	’ Old Martin looked at him steadily . ‘
397661	397671	397842	397842	you	219	’ said Jonas , looking downward with a smile , ‘
397847	398015	397842	397842	you	219	’ His base triumph , struggling with his cowardice , and shame , and guilt , was so detestable , that they turned away from him , as if he were some obscene and filthy animal , repugnant to the sight . And here that last black crime was busy with him too ; working within him to his perdition . But for that , the old clerk ’s story might have touched him , though never so lightly ; but for that , the sudden removal of so great a load might have brought about some wholesome change even in him . With that deed done , however ; with that unnecessary wasteful danger haunting him ; despair was in his very triumph and relief ; wild , ungovernable , raging despair , for the uselessness of the peril into which he had plunged ; despair that hardened him and maddened him , and set his teeth a - grinding in a moment of his exultation . ‘

398193	398197	398220	398220	he	8396	’ she said , ‘

398468	398474	398476	398476	Nadgett	535	‘ That is the man , ’
398478	398483	398530	398530	Nadgett	535	‘ By the window ! ’
398525	398528	398530	398530	Nadgett	535	‘ Murder , ’

This man , of all men in the world , a spy upon him ; this man , changing his identity ; casting off his shrinking , purblind , unobservant character , and springing up into a watchful enemy ! The dead man might have come out of his grave , and not confounded and appalled him more . The game was up . The race was at an end ; the rope was woven for his neck . If , by a miracle , he could escape from this strait , he had but to turn his face another way , no matter where , and there would rise some new avenger front to front with him ; some infant in an hour grown old , or old man in an hour grown young , or blind man with his sight restored , or deaf man with his hearing given him . There was no chance . He sank down in a heap against the wall , and never hoped again from that moment . ‘

399037	399091	399094	399094	kinsman	8422	’ Jonas moved upon the ground like a man in bodily torture . He uttered a suppressed groan , as if he had been wounded by some cruel weapon ; and plucked at the iron band upon his wrists , as though ( his hands being free ) he would have torn himself . ‘

399119	399125	399126	399126	You	8422	’ asked old Martin sternly . ‘

399137	399185	399126	399126	You	8422	’ Martin turned his scrutinizing gaze upon him . He was sitting lazily across a chair with his arms resting on the back ; eating nuts , and throwing the shells out of window as he cracked them , which he still continued to do while speaking . ‘

399271	399293	399295	399296	his nephew	863	‘ You had better save one or two among them the trouble then and be for them as well as YOURself , ’
399298	399367	399390	399392	the old man	991	‘ Look here at me ! Can you see the man of your family who has more talent in his little finger than all the rest in their united brains , dressed as a police officer without being ashamed ? I took up with this trade on purpose to shame you . I did n’t think I should have to make a capture in the family , though . ’
399368	399388	399390	399392	the old man	991	‘ If your debauchery , and that of your chosen friends , has really brought you to this level , ’
399394	399411	399424	399424	Slyme	257	‘ keep it . You are living honestly , I hope , and that ’s something . ’
399412	399422	399424	399424	Slyme	257	‘ Do n’t be hard upon my chosen friends , ’
399426	399456	399465	399466	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	‘ for they were sometimes your chosen friends too . Do n’t say you never employed my friend Tigg , for I know better . We quarrelled upon it . ’
399457	399463	399465	399466	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	‘ I hired the fellow , ’
399468	399474	399485	399486	his nephew	863	‘ and I paid him . ’
399475	399483	399485	399486	his nephew	863	‘ It ’s well you paid him , ’
399488	399516	399563	399563	Slyme	257	‘ for it would be too late to do so now . He has given his receipt in full ; or had it forced from him rather . ’
399541	399561	399563	399563	Slyme	257	‘ I have always expected that he and I would be brought together again in the course of business , ’
399575	399606	399613	399614	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	‘ but I thought he would be wanted for some swindling job ; it never entered my head that I should hold a warrant for the apprehension of his murderer . ’
399607	399611	399631	399631	Nadgett	535	‘ HIS murderer ! ’
399622	399629	399631	399631	Nadgett	535	‘ His or Mr Montague ’s , ’
399633	399699	399738	399738	he	1838	‘ They are the same , I am told . I accuse him yonder of the murder of Mr Montague , who was found last night , killed , in a wood . You will ask me why I accuse him as you have already asked me how I know so much . I ’ll tell you . It ca n’t remain a secret long . ’
399728	399737	399738	399738	he	1838	‘ I told you I had watched him , ’
399741	399964	399738	399738	he	1838	‘ I was instructed to do so by Mr Montague , in whose employment I have been for some time . We had our suspicions of him ; and you know what they pointed at , for you have been discussing it since we have been waiting here , outside the room . If you care to hear , now it ’s all over , in what our suspicions began , I ’ll tell you plainly : in a quarrel ( it first came to our ears through a hint of his own ) between him and another office in which his father ’s life was insured , and which had so much doubt and distrust upon the subject , that he compounded with them , and took half the money ; and was glad to do it . Bit by bit , I ferreted out more circumstances against him , and not a few . It required a little patience , but it ’s my calling . I found the nurse -- here she is to confirm me ; I found the doctor , I found the undertaker , I found the undertaker ’s man . I found out how the old gentleman there , Mr Chuffey , had behaved at the funeral ; and I found out what this man , ’
399971	400063	400234	400234	Nadgett	535	‘ had talked about in his fever . I found out how he conducted himself before his father ’s death , and how since and how at the time ; and writing it all down , and putting it carefully together , made case enough for Mr Montague to tax him with the crime , which ( as he himself believed until to - night ) he had committed . I was by when this was done . You see him now . He is only worse than he was then . ’
400224	400232	400234	400234	Nadgett	535	‘ From that garret - window opposite , ’
400242	400384	400410	400410	Nadgett	535	‘ I have watched this house and him for days and nights . From that garret - window opposite I saw him return home , alone , from a journey on which he had set out with Mr Montague . That was my token that Mr Montague ’s end was gained ; and I might rest easy on my watch , though I was not to leave it until he dismissed me . But , standing at the door opposite , after dark that same night , I saw a countryman steal out of this house , by a side - door in the court , who had never entered it . I knew his walk , and that it was himself , disguised . I followed him immediately . I lost him on the western road , still travelling westward . ’
400399	400408	400410	400410	Nadgett	535	‘ I could not comprehend what this meant , ’
400412	400575	400582	400582	Slyme	257	‘ but , having seen so much , I resolved to see it out , and through . And I did . Learning , on inquiry at his house from his wife , that he was supposed to be sleeping in the room from which I had seen him go out , and that he had given strict orders not to be disturbed , I knew that he was coming back ; and for his coming back I watched . I kept my watch in the street -- in doorways , and such places -- all that night ; at the same window , all next day ; and when night came on again , in the street once more . For I knew he would come back , as he had gone out , when this part of the town was empty . He did . Early in the morning , the same countryman came creeping , creeping , creeping home . ’
400576	400580	400582	400582	Slyme	257	‘ Look sharp ! ’
400591	400600	400612	400612	Nadgett	535	‘ This is quite irregular , Mr Nadgett . ’
400601	400610	400612	400612	Nadgett	535	‘ I kept at the window all day , ’
400618	400683	400692	400692	Slyme	257	‘ I think I never closed my eyes . At night , I saw him come out with a bundle . I followed him again . He went down the steps at London Bridge , and sunk it in the river . I now began to entertain some serious fears , and made a communication to the Police , which caused that bundle to be-- ’
400684	400690	400692	400692	Slyme	257	‘ To be fished up , ’
400694	400701	400715	400715	Nadgett	535	‘ Be alive , Mr Nadgett . ’
400702	400713	400715	400715	Nadgett	535	‘ It contained the dress I had seen him wear , ’
400717	400828	400836	400836	Mark	222	‘ stained with clay , and spotted with blood . Information of the murder was received in town last night . The wearer of that dress is already known to have been seen near the place ; to have been lurking in that neighbourhood ; and to have alighted from a coach coming from that part of the country , at a time exactly tallying with the very minute when I saw him returning home . The warrant has been out , and these officers have been with me , some hours . We chose our time ; and seeing you come in , and seeing this person at the window-- ’
400829	400834	400836	400836	Mark	222	‘ Beckoned to him , ’
400853	400868	400878	400878	Nadgett	535	‘ to open the door ; which he did with a deal of pleasure . ’
400869	400876	400836	400836	Mark	222	‘ That ’s all at present , ’
400909	400948	400956	400957	that worthy	8439	‘ but there is plenty more to come . You asked me for the facts , so far I have related them , and need not detain these gentlemen any longer . Are you ready , Mr Slyme ? ’
400949	400954	400956	400957	that worthy	8439	‘ And something more , ’
400961	400985	401105	401105	Slyme	257	‘ If you walk round to the office , we shall be there as soon as you . Tom ! Get a coach ! ’

As insensible of being disgraced by having such a nephew as myself , in such a situation , as he was of my being an honour and a credit to the family ! That ’s the return I get for having humbled my spirit -- such a spirit as mine -- to earn a livelihood , is it ? ’
401189	401230	401257	401257	Slyme	257	‘ And such a livelihood too ! When there are hundreds of men , not fit to hold a candle to me , rolling in carriages and living on their fortunes . Upon my soul it ’s a nice world ! ’
401252	401255	401288	401288	Slyme	257	‘ Eh ? ’
401283	401286	401318	401318	Jonas	219	‘ Humph ! ’
401292	401317	401331	401331	Slyme	257	‘ I could n’t hope to disgrace him into anything when you have shot so far ahead of me though . I forgot that . ’

402332	402502	403431	403431	You	8467	’ Slyme gave him no reply , but thrusting the purse upon him and forcing it back into his pocket , called up his men . He whined , and cried , and cursed , and entreated them , and struggled , and submitted , in the same breath , and had no power to stand . They got him away and into the coach , where they put him on a seat ; but he soon fell moaning down among the straw at the bottom , and lay there . The two men were with him . Slyme being on the box with the driver ; and they let him lie . Happening to pass a fruiterer ’s on their way ; the door of which was open , though the shop was by this time shut ; one of them remarked how faint the peaches smelled . The other assented at the moment , but presently stooped down in quick alarm , and looked at the prisoner . ‘
402522	403430	403431	403431	You	8467	’ The hand had shut upon it tight . With that rigidity of grasp with which no living man , in the full strength and energy of life , can clutch a prize he has won . They dragged him out into the dark street ; but jury , judge , and hangman , could have done no more , and could do nothing now . Dead , dead , dead . CHAPTER FIFTY - TWO IN WHICH THE TABLES ARE TURNED , COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN Old Martin ’s cherished projects , so long hidden in his own breast , so frequently in danger of abrupt disclosure through the bursting forth of the indignation he had hoarded up during his residence with Mr Pecksniff , were retarded , but not beyond a few hours , by the occurrences just now related . Stunned , as he had been at first by the intelligence conveyed to him through Tom Pinch and John Westlock , of the supposed manner of his brother ’s death ; overwhelmed as he was by the subsequent narratives of Chuffey and Nadgett , and the forging of that chain of circumstances ending in the death of Jonas , of which catastrophe he was immediately informed ; scattered as his purposes and hopes were for the moment , by the crowding in of all these incidents between him and his end ; still their very intensity and the tumult of their assemblage nerved him to the rapid and unyielding execution of his scheme . In every single circumstance , whether it were cruel , cowardly , or false , he saw the flowering of the same pregnant seed . Self ; grasping , eager , narrow - ranging , overreaching self ; with its long train of suspicions , lusts , deceits , and all their growing consequences ; was the root of the vile tree . Mr Pecksniff had so presented his character before the old man ’s eyes , that he -- the good , the tolerant , enduring Pecksniff -- had become the incarnation of all selfishness and treachery ; and the more odious the shapes in which those vices ranged themselves before him now , the sterner consolation he had in his design of setting Mr Pecksniff right and Mr Pecksniff ’s victims too . To this work he brought , not only the energy and determination natural to his character ( which , as the reader may have observed in the beginning of his or her acquaintance with this gentleman , was remarkable for the strong development of those qualities ) , but all the forced and unnaturally nurtured energy consequent upon their long suppression . And these two tides of resolution setting into one and sweeping on , became so strong and vigorous , that , to prevent themselves from being carried away before it , Heaven knows where , was as much as John Westlock and Mark Tapley together ( though they were tolerably energetic too ) could manage to effect . He had sent for John Westlock immediately on his arrival ; and John , under the conduct of Tom Pinch , had waited on him . Having a lively recollection of Mr Tapley , he had caused that gentleman ’s attendance to be secured , through John ’s means , without delay ; and thus , as we have seen , they had all repaired together to the City . But his grandson he had refused to see until to - morrow , when Mr Tapley was instructed to summon him to the Temple at ten o’clock in the forenoon . Tom he would not allow to be employed in anything , lest he should be wrongfully suspected ; but he was a party to all their proceedings , and was with them until late at night -- until after they knew of the death of Jonas ; when he went home to tell all these wonders to little Ruth , and to prepare her for accompanying him to the Temple in the morning , agreeably to Mr Chuzzlewit ’s particular injunction . It was characteristic of old Martin , and his looking on to something which he had distinctly before him , that he communicated to them nothing of his intentions , beyond such hints of reprisal on Mr Pecksniff as they gathered from the game he had played in that gentleman ’s house , and the brightening of his eyes whenever his name was mentioned . Even to John Westlock , in whom he was evidently disposed to place great confidence ( which may indeed be said of every one of them ) , he gave no explanation whatever . He merely requested him to return in the morning ; and with this for their utmost satisfaction , they left him , when the night was far advanced , alone . The events of such a day might have worn out the body and spirit of a much younger man than he , but he sat in deep and painful meditation until the morning was bright . Nor did he even then seek any prolonged repose , but merely slumbered in his chair , until seven o’clock , when Mr Tapley had appointed to come to him by his desire ; and came -- as fresh and clean and cheerful as the morning itself . ‘
403435	403458	403431	403431	You	8467	’ said Mr Chuzzlewit , opening the door to him in reply to his light knock , which had roused him instantly . ‘
403464	403485	403503	403503	sir	864	’ replied Mr Tapley , whose mind would appear from the context to have been running on the matrimonial service , ‘

403559	403563	403578	403578	he	871	’ returned Mark ; ‘

403590	403595	403598	403598	sir	864	’ Mr Chuzzlewit inquired . ‘

403652	403657	403715	403716	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	’ retorted Mr Tapley . ‘

403709	403713	403715	403716	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	‘ In what ? ’
403718	403724	403740	403741	Mr Tapley	309	‘ Meaning him , sir ? ’
403725	403732	403740	403741	Mr Tapley	309	‘ Meaning both him and me . ’
403733	403738	403740	403741	Mr Tapley	309	‘ Well , sir , ’

I know’d it long afore he spoke to you t’other day , and I must say it . Nobody do n’t know half as much of him as I do . Nobody ca n’t . There was always a deal of good in him , but a little of it got crusted over , somehow . I ca n’t say who rolled the paste of that ‘

403851	403855	403858	403858	you	0	’ said Martin . ‘

403919	403929	403930	403930	I	0	’ said Mr Tapley in a fit of desperation : ‘

403969	403986	404013	404013	Martin	563	’m sorry for it . Do n’t wisit on him , sir , that ’s all . ’
404006	404011	404013	404013	Martin	563	‘ So you think , ’
404015	404033	404041	404042	Mr Tapley	309	‘ that his old faults are , in some degree , of my creation , do you ? ’
404034	404039	404041	404042	Mr Tapley	309	‘ Well , sir , ’
404044	404046	404100	404100	I	0	‘ I ’m
404105	404134	404142	404142	you	563	’ The light of a faint smile seemed to break through the dull steadiness of Martin ’s face , as he looked attentively at him , without replying . ‘
404145	404153	404154	404154	Werry	8478	’ he observed after a long pause . ‘
404158	404163	404165	404165	I	0	’ Mr Tapley replied . ‘

404184	404211	404212	404212	You	563	’ Mr Tapley answered . The old man , with his chin resting on his hand , paced the room twice or thrice before he added : ‘
404219	404220	404212	404212	You	563	’ ‘
404229	404230	404234	404234	he	8485	’ ‘

404324	404336	404344	404344	he	8485	’ His frankness was so genuine that it plainly WAS all . ‘
404339	404343	404361	404361	I	0	’ said Martin , ‘
404359	404360	404361	404361	I	0	’ ‘
404373	404389	404421	404421	sir	864	’ replied Mark , without the loss of any atom of his self - possession ; ‘
404423	404424	404426	404426	you	864	’ ‘
404441	404445	404426	404426	you	864	’ asked Martin . ‘
404451	404455	404426	404426	you	864	’ said Mark . ‘
404463	404467	404504	404504	sir	864	’ said Martin , ‘
404500	404501	404504	404504	sir	864	’ ‘
404506	404511	404512	404512	You	864	’ said Mr Tapley . ‘
404525	404529	404512	404512	You	864	’ Martin suggested . ‘
404536	404541	405533	405533	Mark	222	’ said Mr Tapley , ‘
404546	405527	405533	405533	Mark	222	’ Although he pledged himself to this with perfect confidence , he was in a state of unbounded astonishment even now . Martin appeared to observe it , and to have some sense of the ludicrous bearing of Mr Tapley under these perplexing circumstances ; for , in spite of the composure of his voice and the gravity of his face , the same indistinct light flickered on the latter several times . Mark bestirred himself , however , to execute the offices with which he was entrusted ; and soon lost all tendency to any outward expression of his surprise , in the occupation of being brisk and busy . But when he had put Mr Chuzzlewit ’s clothes in good order for dressing , and when that gentleman was dressed and sitting at his breakfast , Mr Tapley ’s feelings of wonder began to return upon him with great violence ; and , standing beside the old man with a napkin under his arm ( it was as natural and easy to joke to Mark to be a butler in the Temple , as it had been to volunteer as cook on board the Screw ) , he found it difficult to resist the temptation of casting sidelong glances at him very often . Nay , he found it impossible ; and accordingly yielded to this impulse so often , that Martin caught him in the fact some fifty times . The extraordinary things Mr Tapley did with his own face when any of these detections occurred ; the sudden occasions he had to rub his eyes or his nose or his chin ; the look of wisdom with which he immediately plunged into the deepest thought , or became intensely interested in the habits and customs of the flies upon the ceiling , or the sparrows out of doors ; or the overwhelming politeness with which he endeavoured to hide his confusion by handing the muffin ; may not unreasonably be assumed to have exercised the utmost power of feature that even Martin Chuzzlewit the elder possessed . But he sat perfectly quiet and took his breakfast at his leisure , or made a show of doing so , for he scarcely ate or drank , and frequently lapsed into long intervals of musing . When he had finished , Mark sat down to his breakfast at the same table ; and Mr Chuzzlewit , quite silent still , walked up and down the room . Mark cleared away in due course , and set a chair out for him , in which , as the time drew on towards ten o’clock , he took his seat , leaning his hands upon his stick , and clenching them upon the handle , and resting his chin on them again . All his impatience and abstraction of manner had vanished now ; and as he sat there , looking , with his keen eyes , steadily towards the door , Mark could not help thinking what a firm , square , powerful face it was ; or exulting in the thought that Mr Pecksniff , after playing a pretty long game of bowls with its owner , seemed to be at last in a very fair way of coming in for a rubber or two . Mark ’s uncertainty in respect of what was going to be done or said , and by whom to whom , would have excited him in itself . But knowing for a certainty besides , that young Martin was coming , and in a very few minutes must arrive , he found it by no means easy to remain quiet and silent . But , excepting that he occasionally coughed in a hollow and unnatural manner to relieve himself , he behaved with great decorum through the longest ten minutes he had ever known . A knock at the door . Mr Westlock . Mr Tapley , in admitting him , raised his eyebrows to the highest possible pitch , implying thereby that he considered himself in an unsatisfactory position . Mr Chuzzlewit received him very courteously . Mark waited at the door for Tom Pinch and his sister , who were coming up the stairs . The old man went to meet them ; took their hands in his ; and kissed her on the cheek . As this looked promising , Mr Tapley smiled benignantly . Mr Chuzzlewit had resumed his chair before young Martin , who was close behind them , entered . The old man , scarcely looking at him , pointed to a distant seat . This was less encouraging ; and Mr Tapley ’s spirits fell again . He was quickly summoned to the door by another knock . He did not start , or cry , or tumble down , at sight of Miss Graham and Mrs Lupin , but he drew a very long breath , and came back perfectly resigned , looking on them and on the rest with an expression which seemed to say that nothing could surprise him any more ; and that he was rather glad to have done with that sensation for ever . The old man received Mary no less tenderly than he had received Tom Pinch ’s sister . A look of friendly recognition passed between himself and Mrs Lupin , which implied the existence of a perfect understanding between them . It engendered no astonishment in Mr Tapley ; for , as he afterwards observed , he had retired from the business , and sold off the stock . Not the least curious feature in this assemblage was , that everybody present was so much surprised and embarrassed by the sight of everybody else , that nobody ventured to speak . Mr Chuzzlewit alone broke silence . ‘
405535	405539	405533	405533	Mark	222	’ he said ; ‘
405544	405594	405533	405533	Mark	222	’ Mark obeyed . The last appointed footstep sounded now upon the stairs . They all knew it . It was Mr Pecksniff ’s ; and Mr Pecksniff was in a hurry too , for he came bounding up with such uncommon expedition that he stumbled twice or thrice . ‘
405601	405642	405643	405645	My venerable friend	8501	’ he cried upon the upper landing ; and then with open arms came darting in . Old Martin merely looked at him ; but Mr Pecksniff started back as if he had received the charge from an electric battery . ‘
405649	405654	405712	405712	vermin	8503	’ cried Mr Pecksniff . ‘
405658	405709	405712	405712	vermin	8503	’ It seemed to reassure the anxious inquirer . He clasped his hands and , looking upwards with a pious joy , silently expressed his gratitude . He then looked round on the assembled group , and shook his head reproachfully . For such a man severely , quite severely . ‘
405714	405719	405930	405933	Horde of unnatural plunderers	8513	’ said Mr Pecksniff . ‘
405906	405929	405930	405933	Horde of unnatural plunderers	8513	’ As he stopped to fetch his breath , he waved them off , in a solemn manner , with his hand . ‘
405937	405941	406023	406023	you	8515	’ he continued ; ‘
406029	406047	406099	406099	I	0	’ said Mr Pecksniff , addressing himself in a tone of gentle remonstrance to the old man , ‘
406113	406324	406342	406342	I	0	’ He advanced with outstretched arms to take the old man ’s hand . But he had not seen how the hand clasped and clutched the stick within its grasp . As he came smiling on , and got within his reach , old Martin , with his burning indignation crowded into one vehement burst , and flashing out of every line and wrinkle in his face , rose up , and struck him down upon the ground . With such a well - directed nervous blow , that down he went , as heavily and true as if the charge of a Life - Guardsman had tumbled him out of a saddle . And whether he was stunned by the shock , or only confused by the wonder and novelty of this warm reception , he did not offer to get up again ; but lay there , looking about him with a disconcerted meekness in his face so enormously ridiculous , that neither Mark Tapley nor John Westlock could repress a smile , though both were actively interposing to prevent a repetition of the blow ; which the old man ’s gleaming eyes and vigorous attitude seemed to render one of the most probable events in the world . ‘
406336	406340	406423	406423	me	0	’ said Martin ; ‘
406381	406421	406425	406425	rascal	8524	’ Seeing that he still did not rise , Mr Tapley , without any compromise about it , actually did drag him away , and stick him up on the floor , with his back against the opposite wall . ‘
406427	406432	406496	406496	you	8524	’ said Mr Chuzzlewit . ‘
406506	406533	406496	406496	you	8524	’ Mr Pecksniff had cause to stare at him , for the triumph in his face and speech and figure was a sight to stare at . ‘
406537	406553	406593	406593	I	0	’ said the old man , pointing at him , and appealing to the rest . ‘
406574	406590	406596	406596	Martin	563	’ At every repetition of the word he pressed his grandson closer to his breast . ‘
406605	406609	406633	406633	you	563	’ he said , ‘
406641	406657	406691	406691	Mary	253	’ Martin was about to answer , but he stopped him , and went on . ‘
406699	406732	406691	406691	Mary	253	’ As she trembled and was very pale , he sat her in his own chair , and stood beside it with her hand in his ; and Martin standing by him . ‘
406739	406751	406779	406779	I	0	’ said the old man , looking kindly down upon her , ‘
406786	406806	406917	406917	his	8537	’ He drew one hand through Martin ’s arm , and standing so , between them , proceeded thus : ‘
406920	406954	406917	406917	his	8537	’ Mr Pecksniff put his hand into his waistcoat , and slightly shook that part of him to which allusion had been made ; as if to signify that it was still uppermost . ‘
406962	407043	407050	407050	Martin	563	’ said Martin--‘I have learned it in my own experience of my own breast -- which is constantly upon the watch for selfishness in others ; and holding others at a distance , by suspicions and distrusts , wonders why they do n’t approach , and do n’t confide , and calls that selfishness in them . Thus I once doubted those about me -- not without reason in the beginning -- and thus I once doubted you , Martin . ’
407044	407049	407050	407050	Martin	563	‘ Not without reason , ’
407053	407056	407075	407075	Martin	563	‘ either . ’
407057	407073	407075	407075	Martin	563	‘ Listen , hypocrite ! Listen , smooth - tongued , servile , crawling knave ! ’
407077	407220	407231	407232	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Listen , you shallow dog . What ! When I was seeking him , you had already spread your nets ; you were already fishing for him , were ye ? When I lay ill in this good woman ’s house and your meek spirit pleaded for my grandson , you had already caught him , had ye ? Counting on the restoration of the love you knew I bore him , you designed him for one of your two daughters did ye ? Or failing that , you traded in him as a speculation which at any rate should blind me with the lustre of your charity , and found a claim upon me ! Why , even then I knew you , and I told you so . Did I tell you that I knew you , even then ? ’
407221	407229	407231	407232	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I am not angry , sir , ’
407236	407255	407261	407261	Martin	563	‘ I can bear a great deal from you . I will never contradict you , Mr Chuzzlewit . ’
407256	407259	407261	407261	Martin	563	‘ Observe ! ’
407266	407479	407488	407489	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I put myself in that man ’s hands on terms as mean and base , and as degrading to himself , as I could render them in words . I stated them at length to him , before his own children , syllable by syllable , as coarsely as I could , and with as much offence , and with as plain an exposition of my contempt , as words -- not looks and manner merely -- could convey . If I had only called the angry blood into his face , I would have wavered in my purpose . If I had only stung him into being a man for a minute I would have abandoned it . If he had offered me one word of remonstrance , in favour of the grandson whom he supposed I had disinherited ; if he had pleaded with me , though never so faintly , against my appeal to him to abandon him to misery and cast him from his house ; I think I could have borne with him for ever afterwards . But not a word , not a word . Pandering to the worst of human passions was the office of his nature ; and faithfully he did his work ! ’
407480	407486	407488	407489	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I am not angry , ’
407491	407514	407515	407516	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	‘ I am hurt , Mr Chuzzlewit ; wounded in my feelings ; but I am not angry , my good sir . ’
407519	407680	407687	407687	Pecksniff	218	‘ Once resolved to try him , I was resolute to pursue the trial to the end ; but while I was bent on fathoming the depth of his duplicity , I made a sacred compact with myself that I would give him credit on the other side for any latent spark of goodness , honour , forbearance -- any virtue -- that might glimmer in him . For first to last there has been no such thing . Not once . He can not say I have not given him opportunity . He can not say I have ever led him on . He can not say I have not left him freely to himself in all things ; or that I have not been a passive instrument in his hands , which he might have used for good as easily as evil . Or if he can , he Lies ! And that ’s his nature , too . ’
407681	407685	407687	407687	Pecksniff	218	‘ Mr Chuzzlewit , ’
407692	407769	407782	407784	the old man	991	‘ I am not angry , sir . I can not be angry with you . But did you never , my dear sir , express a desire that the unnatural young man who by his wicked arts has estranged your good opinion from me , for the time being ; only for the time being ; that your grandson , Mr Chuzzlewit , should be dismissed my house ? Recollect yourself , my Christian friend . ’
407770	407780	407782	407784	the old man	991	‘ I have said so , have I not ? ’
407788	407878	407931	407932	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	‘ I could not tell how far your specious hypocrisy had deceived him , knave ; and knew no better way of opening his eyes than by presenting you before him in your own servile character . Yes . I did express that desire . And you leaped to meet it ; and you met it ; and turning in an instant on the hand you had licked and beslavered , as only such hounds can , you strengthened , and confirmed , and justified me in my scheme . ’
407921	407930	407931	407932	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	‘ The wretched man who has been murdered , ’
407938	407945	407951	407951	Mark	222	‘ then passing by the name of-- ’
407946	407949	407951	407951	Mark	222	‘ Tigg , ’
407953	408039	408049	408049	Martin	563	‘ Of Tigg ; brought begging messages to me on behalf of a friend of his , and an unworthy relative of mine ; and finding him a man well enough suited to my purpose , I employed him to glean some news of you , Martin , for me . It was from him I learned that you had taken up your abode with yonder fellow . It was he , who meeting you here in town , one evening -- you remember where ? ’
408040	408047	408049	408049	Martin	563	‘ At the pawnbroker ’s shop , ’
408051	408071	408079	408079	Martin	563	‘ Yes ; watched you to your lodging , and enabled me to send you a bank - note . ’
408072	408077	408079	408079	Martin	563	‘ I little thought , ’
408084	408106	408114	408116	the old man	991	‘ that it had come from you ; I little thought that you were interested in my fate . If I had-- ’
408107	408112	408114	408116	the old man	991	‘ If you had , ’
408120	408329	408114	408116	the old man	991	‘ you would have shown less knowledge of me as I seemed to be , and as I really was . I hoped to bring you back , Martin , penitent and humbled . I hoped to distress you into coming back to me . Much as I loved you , I had that to acknowledge which I could not reconcile it to myself to avow , then , unless you made submission to me first . Thus it was I lost you . If I have had , indirectly , any act or part in the fate of that unhappy man , by putting means , however small , within his reach , Heaven forgive me ! I might have known , perhaps , that he would misuse money ; that it was ill - bestowed upon him ; and that sown by his hands it could engender mischief only . But I never thought of him at that time as having the disposition or ability to be a serious impostor , or otherwise than as a thoughtless , idle - humoured , dissipated spendthrift , sinning more against himself than others , and frequenting low haunts and indulging vicious tastes , to his own ruin only . ’
408330	408332	408114	408116	the old man	991	‘ Beggin ’
408338	408357	408114	408116	the old man	991	’ said Mr Tapley , who had Mrs Lupin on his arm by this time , quite agreeably ; ‘
408392	408439	408540	408540	you	8540	’ number of men sir , who as long as they ’ve only got their own shoes and stockings to depend upon , will walk down hill , along the gutters quiet enough and by themselves , and not do much harm . But set any on ‘

408534	408535	408540	408540	you	8540	’ ‘
408546	408551	408617	408617	you	8540	’ said Mr Chuzzlewit , ‘
408633	408647	408617	408617	you	8540	’ Mr Pecksniff laid his hand upon his breast , and bowed again . ‘
408657	408662	409623	409623	Martin	563	’ said Mr Chuzzlewit , ‘
408812	409590	409623	409623	Martin	563	’ And then he told them how he had sometimes thought , in the beginning , that love might grow up between Mary and Martin ; and how he had pleased his fancy with the picture of observing it when it was new , and taking them to task , apart , in counterfeited doubt , and then confessing to them that it had been an object dear to his heart ; and by his sympathy with them , and generous provision for their young fortunes , establishing a claim on their affection and regard which nothing should wither , and which should surround his old age with means of happiness . How in the first dawn of this design , and when the pleasure of such a scheme for the happiness of others was new and indistinct within him , Martin had come to tell him that he had already chosen for himself ; knowing that he , the old man , had some faint project on that head , but ignorant whom it concerned . How it was little comfort to him to know that Martin had chosen Her , because the grace of his design was lost , and because finding that she had returned his love , he tortured himself with the reflection that they , so young , to whom he had been so kind a benefactor , were already like the world , and bent on their own selfish , stealthy ends . How in the bitterness of this impression , and of his past experience , he had reproached Martin so harshly ( forgetting that he had never invited his confidence on such a point , and confounding what he had meant to do with what he had done ) , that high words sprung up between them , and they separated in wrath . How he loved him still , and hoped he would return . How on the night of his illness at the Dragon , he had secretly written tenderly of him , and made him his heir , and sanctioned his marriage with Mary ; and how , after his interview with Mr Pecksniff , he had distrusted him again , and burnt the paper to ashes , and had lain down in his bed distracted by suspicions , doubts , and regrets . And then he told them how , resolved to probe this Pecksniff , and to prove the constancy and truth of Mary ( to himself no less than Martin ) , he had conceived and entered on his plan ; and how , beneath her gentleness and patience , he had softened more and more ; still more and more beneath the goodness and simplicity , the honour and the manly faith of Tom . And when he spoke of Tom , he said God bless him ; and the tears were in his eyes ; for he said that Tom , mistrusted and disliked by him at first , had come like summer rain upon his heart ; and had disposed it to believe in better things . And Martin took him by the hand , and Mary too , and John , his old friend , stoutly too ; and Mark , and Mrs Lupin , and his sister , little Ruth . And peace of mind , deep , tranquil peace of mind , was in Tom ’s heart . The old man then related how nobly Mr Pecksniff had performed the duty in which he stood indebted to society , in the matter of Tom ’s dismissal ; and how , having often heard disparagement of Mr Westlock from Pecksniffian lips , and knowing him to be a friend to Tom , he had used , through his confidential agent and solicitor , that little artifice which had kept him in readiness to receive his unknown friend in London . And he called on Mr Pecksniff ( by the name of Scoundrel ) to remember that there again he had not trapped him to do evil , but that he had done it of his own free will and agency ; nay , that he had cautioned him against it . And once again he called on Mr Pecksniff ( by the name of Hang - dog ) to remember that when Martin coming home at last , an altered man , had sued for the forgiveness which awaited him , he , Pecksniff , had rejected him in language of his own , and had remorsely stepped in between him and the least touch of natural tenderness . ‘
409594	409600	409623	409623	Martin	563	’ said the old man , ‘
409621	409622	409623	409623	Martin	563	’ ‘
409625	409629	409701	409701	you	563	’ he added , ‘
409706	409776	409794	409794	me	0	’ Hold it ! If he clasped it half as tightly as he did her waist . Well , well ! But it was good in him that even then , in his high fortune and happiness , with her lips nearly printed on his own , and her proud young beauty in his close embrace , he had a hand still left to stretch out to Tom Pinch . ‘
409796	409797	409805	409805	I	0	’ ‘
409800	409804	409879	409879	I	0	’ cried Tom . ‘
409841	409878	409879	409879	I	0	’ Joy ! There is not a blessing on earth that Tom did not wish them . There is not a blessing on earth that Tom would not have bestowed upon them , if he could . ‘
409886	409894	409896	409896	yow	8562	’ said Mr Tapley , stepping forward , ‘
409899	409914	409921	409922	old Martin	563	’ , just now , a lady of the name of Lupin , sir . ’
409915	409919	409921	409922	old Martin	563	‘ I was , ’
409923	409936	409945	409945	Martin	563	‘ Yes , sir . It ’s a pretty name , sir ? ’
409937	409943	409969	409969	Mark	222	‘ A very good name , ’
409947	409967	409969	409969	Mark	222	‘ It seems a’most a pity to change such a name into Tapley . Do n’t it , sir ? ’
409971	409983	409991	409992	Mr Tapley	309	‘ That depends upon the lady . What is HER opinion ? ’
409984	409989	409991	409992	Mr Tapley	309	‘ Why , sir , ’
410005	410075	410199	410199	he	218	‘ her opinion is as the name ai n’t a change for the better , but the indiwidual may be , and , therefore , if nobody ai n’t acquainted with no jest cause or impediment , et cetrer , the Blue Dragon will be con - werted into the Jolly Tapley . A sign of my own inwention , sir . Wery new , conwivial , and expressive ! ’
410214	410227	410235	410235	he	218	‘ Mr Chuzzlewit , sir ! you have partaken of my hospitality . ’
410228	410234	410247	410248	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ And paid for it , ’
410238	410245	410247	410248	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ Thank you . That savours , ’
410257	410359	410389	410389	Pecksniff	218	‘ of your old familiar frankness . You have paid for it . I was about to make the remark . You have deceived me , sir . Thank you again . I am glad of it . To see you in the possession of your health and faculties on any terms , is , in itself , a sufficient recompense . To have been deceived implies a trusting nature . Mine is a trusting nature . I am thankful for it . I would rather have a trusting nature , do you know , sir , than a doubting one ! ’
410376	410387	410389	410389	Pecksniff	218	‘ There is hardly any person present , Mr Chuzzlewit , ’
410391	410477	410526	410527	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ by whom I have not been deceived . I have forgiven those persons on the spot . That was my duty ; and , of course , I have done it . Whether it was worthy of you to partake of my hospitality , and to act the part you did act in my house , that , sir , is a question which I leave to your own conscience . And your conscience does not acquit you . No , sir , no ! ’
410516	410524	410526	410527	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ I have been struck this day , ’
410529	410647	410526	410527	Mr Pecksniff	218	‘ with a walking stick ( which I have every reason to believe has knobs upon it ) , on that delicate and exquisite portion of the human anatomy -- the brain . Several blows have been inflicted , sir , without a walking - stick , upon that tenderer portion of my frame -- my heart . You have mentioned , sir , my being bankrupt in my purse . Yes , sir , I am . By an unfortunate speculation , combined with treachery , I find myself reduced to poverty ; at a time , sir , when the child of my bosom is widowed , and affliction and disgrace are in my family . ’
410693	410700	410670	410670	he	218	‘ Cheer up , my boy ! ’
410701	411019	411099	411101	the little man	8568	‘ I know the human mind , although I trust it . That is my weakness . Do I not know , sir’--here he became exceedingly plaintive and was observed to glance towards Tom Pinch--‘that my misfortunes bring this treatment on me ? Do I not know , sir , that but for them I never should have heard what I have heard to - day ? Do I not know that in the silence and the solitude of night , a little voice will whisper in your ear , Mr Chuzzlewit , “ This was not well . This was not well , sir ! ” Think of this , sir ( if you will have the goodness ) , remote from the impulses of passion , and apart from the specialities , if I may use that strong remark , of prejudice . And if you ever contemplate the silent tomb , sir , which you will excuse me for entertaining some doubt of your doing , after the conduct into which you have allowed yourself to be betrayed this day ; if you ever contemplate the silent tomb sir , think of me . If you find yourself approaching to the silent tomb , sir , think of me . If you should wish to have anything inscribed upon your silent tomb , sir , let it be , that I -- ah , my remorseful sir ! that I -- the humble individual who has now the honour of reproaching you , forgave you . That I forgave you when my injuries were fresh , and when my bosom was newly wrung . It may be bitterness to you to hear it now , sir , but you will live to seek a consolation in it . May you find a consolation in it when you want it , sir ! Good morning ! ’

Endeavour to impress that upon her at your leisure , if you please . ’

They went away , but not through London ’s streets ! Through some enchanted city , where the pavements were of air ; where all the rough sounds of a stirring town were softened into gentle music ; where everything was happy ; where there was no distance , and no time . There were two good - tempered burly draymen letting down big butts of beer into a cellar , somewhere ; and when John helped her -- almost lifted her -- the lightest , easiest , neatest thing you ever saw -- across the rope , they said he owed them a good turn for giving him the chance . Celestial draymen ! Green pastures in the summer tide , deep - littered straw yards in the winter , no start of corn and clover , ever , to that noble horse who WOULD dance on the pavement with a gig behind him , and who frightened her , and made her clasp his arm with both hands ( both hands meeting one upon the another so endearingly ! ) , and caused her to implore him to take refuge in the pastry - cook ’s , and afterwards to peep out at the door so shrinkingly ; and then , looking at him with those eyes , to ask him was he sure -- now was he sure -- they might go safely on ! Oh for a string of rampant horses ! For a lion , for a bear , for a mad bull , for anything to bring the little hands together on his arm again ! They talked , of course . They talked of Tom , and all these changes and the attachment Mr Chuzzlewit had conceived for him , and the bright prospects he had in such a friend , and a great deal more to the same purpose . The more they talked , the more afraid this fluttering little Ruth became of any pause ; and sooner than have a pause she would say the same things over again ; and if she had n’t courage or presence of mind enough for that ( to say the truth she very seldom had ) , she was ten thousand times more charming and irresistible than she had been before . ‘
413695	413750	413751	413751	Ye	8617	’ said John . She supposed he would . Never did a bewitching little woman suppose anything in such a faint voice as Ruth supposed that . But seeing that another of those alarming pauses was approaching , she remarked that he would have a beautiful wife . Did n’t Mr Westlock think so ? ‘
413755	413759	413751	413751	Ye	8617	’ said John , ‘

413941	413996	414033	414033	they	8620	‘ Dear Ruth ! Sweet Ruth ! If I had loved you less , I could have told you that I loved you , long ago . I have loved you from the first . There never was a creature in the world more truly loved than you , dear Ruth , by me ! ’

Darling Ruth ! My own good , gentle , winning Ruth ! I hope I know the value of your heart , I hope I know the worth of your angel nature . Let me try and show you that I do ; and you will make me happier , Ruth-- ’

415268	415271	415278	415279	his friend	9006	‘ John ! ’
415272	415276	415278	415279	his friend	9006	‘ Dear Tom , ’
415281	415293	415334	415334	Tom	493	‘ give me your hand . We are brothers , Tom . ’
415316	415333	415437	415438	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	‘ Do n’t speak to me , John . Heaven is very good to us . I-- ’
415425	415435	415437	415438	Mr Chuzzlewit	219	‘ I am glad you chose to - day , ’
415454	415495	415508	415508	John	247	‘ I thought you would . I hoped Tom and I lingered behind a discreet time . It ’s so long since I had any practical knowledge of these subjects , that I have been anxious , I assure you . ’
415496	415506	415508	415508	John	247	‘ Your knowledge is still pretty accurate , sir , ’
415512	415526	415540	415542	the old man	991	‘ if it led you to foresee what would happen to - day . ’
415527	415538	415540	415542	the old man	991	‘ Why , I am not sure , Mr Westlock , ’
415544	415588	415636	415636	he	991	‘ that any great spirit of prophecy was needed , after seeing you and Ruth together . Come hither , pretty one . See what Tom and I purchased this morning , while you were dealing in exchange with that young merchant there . ’
415631	415635	415636	415636	he	991	‘ See here ! ’
415646	415731	415867	415869	the old man	991	‘ what a beautiful necklace . Ah ! How it glitters ! Earrings , too , and bracelets , and a zone for your waist . This set is yours , and Mary has another like it . Tom could n’t understand why I wanted two . What a short - sighted Tom ! Earrings and bracelets , and a zone for your waist ! Ah ! Beautiful ! Let us see how brave they look . Ask Mr Westlock to clasp them on . ’
415852	415865	415867	415869	the old man	991	‘ The set of jewels and the wearer are so well matched , ’
415871	415932	415999	415999	he	991	‘ that I do n’t know which becomes the other most . Mr Westlock could tell me , I have no doubt , but I ’ll not ask him , for he is bribed . Health to wear them , my dear , and happiness to make you forgetful of them , except as a remembrance from a loving friend ! ’
415945	415998	415999	415999	he	991	‘ I must play the part of a father here , Tom , also . There are not many fathers who marry two such daughters on the same day ; but we will overlook the improbability for the gratification of an old man ’s fancy . I may claim that much indulgence , ’
416002	416023	416628	416628	Fips	640	‘ for I have gratified few fancies enough in my life tending to the happiness of others , Heaven knows ! ’
416621	416626	416747	416747	Fips	640	‘ Where is he ? ’
416697	416702	416907	416907	Tom	638	‘ How are you ? ’
416894	416905	416907	416907	Tom	638	‘ They like to be by themselves , of course , ’
416909	416937	416964	416964	John	247	‘ and I came away so naturally , that I have no doubt they are expecting me , every moment , to return . That ’s capital ! ’
416956	416962	416972	416972	Tom	638	‘ May I come in ? ’
416966	416971	416972	416972	Tom	638	‘ Oh , surely ! ’
416975	416999	417007	417007	Tom	638	‘ Do n’t leave us , Tom . Do n’t sit by yourself . We want to make you merry ; not melancholy . ’
417000	417005	417007	417007	Tom	638	‘ My dear friend , ’
417014	417021	417029	417029	Tom	638	‘ Brother , Tom . Brother . ’
417022	417027	417073	417073	he	638	‘ My dear brother , ’
417031	417072	417073	417073	he	638	‘ there is no danger of my being melancholy , how can I be melancholy , when I know that you and Ruth are so blest in each other ! I think I can find my tongue tonight , John , ’
417082	417145	417154	417154	he	638	‘ But I never can tell you what unutterable joy this day has given me . It would be unjust to you to speak of your having chosen a portionless girl , for I feel that you know her worth ; I am sure you know her worth . Nor will it diminish in your estimation , John , which money might . ’
417146	417153	417154	417154	he	638	‘ Which money would , Tom , ’
417157	417251	417256	417256	John	247	‘ Her worth ! Oh , who could see her here , and not love her ! Who could know her , Tom , and not honour her ! Who could ever stand possessed of such a heart as hers , and grow indifferent to the treasure ! Who could feel the rapture that I feel to - day , and love as I love her , Tom , without knowing something of her worth ! Your joy unutterable ! No , no , Tom . It ’s mine , it ’s mine . ‘
417258	417262	417256	417256	John	247	’ said Tom . ‘
417271	417329	417358	417358	Tom	638	’ Their friendly contention was brought to a close by little Ruth herself , who came peeping in at the door . And oh , the look , the glorious , half - proud , half - timid look she gave Tom , when her lover drew her to his side ! As much as to say , ‘
417360	417387	417491	417491	he	638	’ As to Tom , he was perfectly delighted . He could have sat and looked at them , just as they were , for hours . ‘
417496	418382	418387	418387	I	0	’ Well ! He really did not seem to be any particular restraint upon them . Judging from what ensued . Was it folly in Tom to be so pleased by their remembrance of him at such a time ? Was their graceful love a folly , were their dear caresses follies , was their lengthened parting folly ? Was it folly in him to watch her window from the street , and rate its scantiest gleam of light above all diamonds ; folly in her to breathe his name upon her knees , and pour out her pure heart before that Being from whom such hearts and such affections come ? If these be follies , then Fiery Face go on and prosper ! If they be not , then Fiery Face avaunt ! But set the crunched bonnet at some other single gentleman , in any case , for one is lost to thee for ever ! CHAPTER FIFTY - FOUR GIVES THE AUTHOR GREAT CONCERN . FOR IT IS THE LAST IN THE BOOK Todger ’s was in high feather , and mighty preparations for a late breakfast were astir in its commercial bowers . The blissful morning had arrived when Miss Pecksniff was to be united in holy matrimony , to Augustus . Miss Pecksniff was in a frame of mind equally becoming to herself and the occasion . She was full of clemency and conciliation . She had laid in several caldrons of live coals , and was prepared to heap them on the heads of her enemies . She bore no spite nor malice in her heart . Not the least . Quarrels , Miss Pecksniff said , were dreadful things in families ; and though she never could forgive her dear papa , she was willing to receive her other relations . They had been separated , she observed , too long . It was enough to call down a judgment upon the family . She believed the death of Jonas WAS a judgment on them for their internal dissensions . And Miss Pecksniff was confirmed in this belief , by the lightness with which the visitation had fallen on herself . By way of doing sacrifice -- not in triumph ; not , of course , in triumph , but in humiliation of spirit -- this amiable young person wrote , therefore , to her kinswoman of the strong mind , and informed her that her nuptials would take place on such a day . That she had been much hurt by the unnatural conduct of herself and daughters , and hoped they might not have suffered in their consciences . That , being desirous to forgive her enemies , and make her peace with the world before entering into the most solemn of covenants with the most devoted of men , she now held out the hand of friendship . That if the strong - minded women took that hand , in the temper in which it was extended to her , she , Miss Pecksniff , did invite her to be present at the ceremony of her marriage , and did furthermore invite the three red - nosed spinsters , her daughters ( but Miss Pecksniff did not particularize their noses ) , to attend as bridesmaids . The strong - minded women returned for answer , that herself and daughters were , as regarded their consciences , in the enjoyment of robust health , which she knew Miss Pecksniff would be glad to hear . That she had received Miss Pecksniff ’s note with unalloyed delight , because she never had attached the least importance to the paltry and insignificant jealousies with which herself and circle had been assailed ; otherwise than as she had found them , in the contemplation , a harmless source of innocent mirth . That she would joyfully attend Miss Pecksniff ’s bridal ; and that her three dear daughters would be happy to assist , on so interesting , and SO VERY UNEXPECTED -- which the strong - minded woman underlined -- SO VERY UNEXPECTED an occasion . On the receipt of this gracious reply , Miss Pecksniff extended her forgiveness and her invitations to Mr and Mrs Spottletoe ; to Mr George Chuzzlewit the bachelor cousin ; to the solitary female who usually had the toothache ; and to the hairy young gentleman with the outline of a face ; surviving remnants of the party that had once assembled in Mr Pecksniff ’s parlour . After which Miss Pecksniff remarked that there was a sweetness in doing our duty , which neutralized the bitter in our cups . The wedding guests had not yet assembled , and indeed it was so early that Miss Pecksniff herself was in the act of dressing at her leisure , when a carriage stopped near the Monument ; and Mark , dismounting from the rumble , assisted Mr Chuzzlewit to alight . The carriage remained in waiting ; so did Mr Tapley . Mr Chuzzlewit betook himself to Todger ’s . He was shown , by the degenerate successor of Mr Bailey , into the dining - parlour ; where -- for his visit was expected -- Mrs Todgers immediately appeared . ‘
418394	418414	418428	418428	I	0	’ he said . Mrs Todgers , who was greatly flurried by the preparations , replied in the affirmative . ‘
418434	418439	418467	418467	sir	864	’ said Mrs Todgers ; ‘
418469	418470	418467	418467	sir	864	’ ‘
418473	418478	418482	418482	Her	241	’ said Mr Chuzzlewit , ‘
418491	418492	418519	418519	she	8919	’ ‘
418503	418517	418525	418525	she	8919	’ said Mrs Todgers , shaking her head , and dropping her voice . ‘
418536	418537	418539	418539	she	8919	’ ‘
418545	418549	418539	418539	she	8919	’ he inquired . ‘
418555	418556	418539	418539	she	8919	’ ‘
418564	418676	418677	418677	I	0	’ Mrs Todgers conducted him into the little back chamber commanding the prospect of the cistern ; and there , sadly different from when it had first been her lodging , sat poor Merry , in mourning weeds . The room looked very dark and sorrowful ; and so did she ; but she had one friend beside her , faithful to the last . Old Chuffey . When Mr Chuzzlewit sat down at her side , she took his hand and put it to her lips . She was in great grief . He too was agitated ; for he had not seen her since their parting in the churchyard . ‘
418682	418691	418737	418738	Tom Pinch	249	’ he said , in a low voice . ‘
418708	418736	418737	418738	Tom Pinch	249	’ She kissed his hand again ; and retaining it in hers , thanked him in a broken voice , for all his kindness to her since . ‘
418740	418744	418817	418817	You	249	’ said Martin , ‘
418815	418816	418817	418817	You	249	’ ‘
418826	418830	418903	418903	you	249	’ she answered . ‘
418924	418941	418944	418944	I	0	’ He shook his head in doubt , and not without some inward self - reproach . ‘
418947	418951	419120	419120	she	8704	’ she said , ‘
419117	419118	419120	419120	she	8704	’ ‘
419123	419128	419120	419120	she	8704	’ said Mrs Todgers . ‘
419135	419136	419140	419140	I	0	’ ‘
419142	419147	419299	419299	I	0	’ said Mr Chuzzlewit . ‘
419297	419298	419299	419299	I	0	’ ‘
419306	419322	419332	419332	I	0	’ she said , with an instinctive reference to his having forced her marriage on . ‘
419330	419331	419332	419332	I	0	’ ‘
419336	419341	419508	419508	She	1594	’ Mr Chuzzlewit resumed ; ‘
419525	419696	419508	419508	She	1594	’ Mrs Todgers , though most unwilling to part with her , added her persuasions . Even poor old Chuffey ( of course included in the project ) added his . She hurriedly attired herself , and was ready to depart , when Miss Pecksniff dashed into the room . Miss Pecksniff dashed in so suddenly , that she was placed in an embarrassing position . For though she had completed her bridal toilette as to her head , on which she wore a bridal bonnet with orange flowers , she had not completed it as to her skirts , which displayed no choicer decoration than a dimity bedgown . She had dashed in , in fact , about half - way through , to console her sister , in her affliction , with a sight of the aforesaid bonnet ; and being quite unconscious of the presence of a visitor , until she found Mr Chuzzlewit standing face to face with her , her surprise was an uncomfortable one . ‘
419702	419714	419728	419728	sir	864	’ said the old man , eyeing her with strong disfavour . ‘
419724	419725	419728	419728	sir	864	’ ‘
419730	419737	419750	419751	Mrs Todgers	322	’ returned Miss Pecksniff , modestly . ‘
419753	419754	419767	419767	I	0	’ ‘
419758	419763	419779	419779	You	7799	’ said old Martin , ‘
419789	419790	419791	419791	I	0	’ ‘
419799	419811	419889	419889	I	0	’ retorted Cherry ; very red and angry in a moment ; ‘
419879	419886	420010	420011	Your sister	1594	’ said Miss Pecksniff , pointedly ; ‘
420008	420009	420025	420025	she	1594	’ ‘
420044	420049	420075	420075	I	0	’ said Mr Chuzzlewit . ‘
420065	420074	420113	420113	my	0	’ returned Miss Pecksniff , tossing her head . ‘
420116	420117	420120	420121	Miss Pecksniff	241	’ ‘
420123	420131	420166	420166	You	241	’ said the old man , quietly . ‘
420176	420177	420191	420194	every friend in life	8729	’ ‘
420196	420204	420357	420358	Mrs Todgers!--I	697	’ returned Miss Pecksniff , with dignity , ‘
420369	420514	420517	420517	Mark	222	’ After these words the bridal bonnet disappeared ; with as much state as the dimity bedgown left in it . Old Martin gave his arm to the younger sister without speaking ; and led her out . Mrs Todgers , with her holiday garments fluttering in the wind , accompanied them to the carriage , clung round Merry ’s neck at parting , and ran back to her own dingy house , crying the whole way . She had a lean , lank body , Mrs Todgers , but a well - conditioned soul within . Perhaps the good Samaritan was lean and lank , and found it hard to live . Who knows ! Mr Chuzzlewit followed her so closely with his eyes , that , until she had shut her own door , they did not encounter Mr Tapley ’s face . ‘
420519	420530	420542	420542	sir	864	’ he said , as soon as he observed it , ‘
420536	420537	420542	420542	sir	864	’ ‘
420544	420568	420576	420576	I	0	’ returned Mark , pumping at his voice in a most laborious manner , and hardly able to articulate with all his efforts . ‘
420577	420591	420598	420599	old Martin	563	’m blessed if here ai n’t two old neighbours of ourn , sir ! ’
420592	420596	420598	420599	old Martin	563	‘ What neighbours ? ’
420606	420609	420576	420576	I	0	‘ Where ? ’
420610	420616	420576	420576	I	0	‘ I was a - walkin ’
420627	420634	420664	420664	somebody	924	’ said Mr Tapley , breathless , ‘
420673	420674	420664	420664	somebody	924	’ ‘
420680	420703	420712	420712	sir	864	’ exclaimed old Martin , quite as much excited by the spectacle of Mark ’s excitement as that strange person was himself . ‘
420708	420709	420712	420712	sir	864	’ ‘
420714	420719	420741	420741	I	0	’ replied Mr Tapley . ‘
420743	420756	420741	420741	I	0	‘ em ? Lord love their welcome faces , do n’t I know ‘
420759	420794	420829	420829	Mark	222	’ With which ejaculations Mr Tapley not only pointed to a decent - looking man and woman standing by , but commenced embracing them alternately , over and over again , in Monument Yard . ‘
420818	420827	420829	420829	Mark	222	‘ Neighbours in America ! Neighbours in Eden ! ’
420831	420866	420896	420896	he	563	‘ Neighbours in the swamp , neighbours in the bush , neighbours in the fever . Did n’t she nurse us ! Did n’t he help us ! Should n’t we both have died without ‘
420876	420894	420995	420995	he	563	’ back , without a single child for their consolation ! And talk to me of neighbours ! ’
420988	420994	420995	420995	he	563	‘ Get up , behind ! ’
420998	421022	421028	421029	Mr Tapley	309	‘ Get up in the rumble . Come along with me ! Go you on the box , Mark . Home ! Home ! ’
421023	421026	421028	421029	Mr Tapley	309	‘ Home ! ’
421043	421085	421257	421257	him	8748	‘ Exactly my opinion , sir . Home for ever ! Excuse the liberty , sir , I ca n’t help it . Success to the Jolly Tapley ! There ’s nothin’ in the house they sha n’t have for the askin ’
421099	421255	421257	421257	him	8748	’ Home they rolled accordingly , when he had got the old man in again , as fast as they could go ; Mark abating nothing of his fervour by the way , by allowing it to vent itself as unrestrainedly as if he had been on Salisbury Plain . And now the wedding party began to assemble at Todgers ’s . Mr Jinkins , the only boarder invited , was on the ground first . He wore a white favour in his button - hole , and a bran new extra super double - milled blue saxony dress coat ( that was its description in the bill ) , with a variety of tortuous embellishments about the pockets , invented by the artist to do honour to the day . The miserable Augustus no longer felt strongly even on the subject of Jinkins . He had n’t strength of mind enough to do it . ‘
421260	421277	421282	421282	He	8748	’ he had said , in answer to Miss Pecksniff , when she urged the point . ‘
421292	421312	421402	421402	he	274	‘ Tis meet he should be there . Ha , ha ! Oh , yes ! let Jinkins come ! ’
421393	421401	421402	421402	he	274	‘ Glad to know you , sir , ’
421405	421410	421459	421459	Spottletoe	274	‘ Give you joy ! ’
421451	421457	421472	421473	Mr Jinkins	321	‘ Not arrived , sir ! ’
421466	421470	421482	421482	Spottletoe	274	‘ Not yet , ’
421475	421480	421482	421482	Spottletoe	274	‘ Upon my soul ! ’
421484	421542	421584	421584	Spottletoe	274	‘ He begins well ! Upon my life and honour this young man begins well ! But I should very much like to know how it is that every one who comes into contact with this family is guilty of some gross insult to it . Death ! Not arrived yet . Not here to receive us ! ’
421571	421582	421642	421643	the nephew	9288	‘ Do n’t talk to me of Boots , sir ! ’
421590	421632	421642	421643	the nephew	9288	‘ He is bound to come here in his slippers then ; he is bound to come here barefoot . Do n’t offer such a wretched and evasive plea to me on behalf of your friend , as Boots , sir . ’
421633	421640	421642	421643	the nephew	9288	‘ He is not MY friend , ’
421645	421651	421660	421662	the fiery Spottletoe	274	‘ I never saw him . ’
421652	421658	421660	421662	the fiery Spottletoe	274	‘ Very well , sir , ’
421664	421672	421730	421730	Spottletoe	274	‘ Then do n’t talk to me ! ’
421720	421728	421730	421730	Spottletoe	274	‘ How do you do , ma’am ! ’
421743	421753	421811	421812	that lady	9988	‘ I believe you see Mrs Spottletoe , ma’am ? ’
421794	421809	421811	421812	that lady	9988	‘ Mrs Spottletoe is at least more easily seen than the bridegroom , ma’am , ’
421816	421847	421857	421861	the strong - minded woman	9403	‘ That is , unless he has confined his attentions to any particular part or branch of this family , which would be quite in keeping with its usual proceedings . ’
